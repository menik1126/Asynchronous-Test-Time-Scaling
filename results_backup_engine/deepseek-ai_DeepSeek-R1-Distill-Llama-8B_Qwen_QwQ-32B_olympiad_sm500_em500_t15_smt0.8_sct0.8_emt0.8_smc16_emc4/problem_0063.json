The sequence is defined by \\( x_1 = a \\) and \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 \\). Then each \\( y_n \\) is \\( 2^{x_n} - 1 \\). \n\nHmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. So starting with \\( x_1 = a \\), each subsequent term is double the previous term plus one. So it's like a recursive sequence where each term grows exponentially. Then \\( y_n \\) is taking 2 raised to that \\( x_n \\) minus one. That looks like a Mersenne number, right? Because Mersenne primes are numbers of the form \\( 2^p - 1 \\) where \\( p \\) itself is prime.\n\nBut wait, in this case, \\( y_n \\) doesn't necessarily have \\( x_n \\) being prime. So first, maybe I should look at how \\( x_n \\) progresses and see how it relates to \\( y_n \\).\n\nLet me try to compute some terms. Starting with \\( x_1 = a \\), then \\( x_2 = 2a + 1 \\), \\( x_3 = 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3 \\), \\( x_4 = 8a + 7 \\), and so on. So each \\( x_n \\) is \\( 2^{n-1}a + (2^{n-1} - 1) \\). Yeah, because each time you multiply by 2 and add 1, which is a linear recurrence. So the closed-form for \\( x_n \\) is \\( x_n = (2^{n-1})a + 2^{n-1} - 1 \\). \n\nThus, \\( y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1 = 2^{(2^{n-1}a + 2^{n-1} - 1)} - 1 \\). Hmm, that's a massive exponent.
