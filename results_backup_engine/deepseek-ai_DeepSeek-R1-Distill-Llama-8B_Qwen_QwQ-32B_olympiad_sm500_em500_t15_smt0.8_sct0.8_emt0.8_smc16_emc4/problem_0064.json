Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a cubic sequence is a polynomial of degree 3, which means it has the form \\( a_n = n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d \\). The coefficients \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are integers, and \\( n \\) can be any integer, including negatives.\n\nThe question is asking about the product \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\). So, I need to find expressions for \\( a_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} \\), then multiply them together.\n\nLet me write out \\( a_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} \\):\n\n\\( a_{2015} = 2015^3 + b \\cdot 2015^2 + c \\cdot 2015 + d \\)\n\n\\( a_{2016} = 2016^3 + b \\cdot 2016^2 + c \\cdot 2016 + d \\)\n\nSo, their product is:\n\n\\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} = (2015^3 + b \\cdot 2015^2 + c \\cdot 2015 + d)(2016^3 + b \\cdot 2016^2 + c \\cdot 2016 + d) \\)\n\nThat looks complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this rather than expanding everything. Let me think.\n\nI remember that for polynomials, the product of consecutive terms can sometimes be expressed in terms of the polynomial itself. Maybe if I consider the polynomial \\( P(n) = n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d \\), then \\( a_{2015} = P(2015) \\) and \\( a_{2016} = P(2016) \\).

But since \\( k \\) can be any integer, \\( m \\) can be any integer, so the product can be any perfect sixth power. But the problem says \"possible values\", so maybe all perfect sixth powers? But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe part (a) had a different condition. Let me think of another common condition for cubic sequences. Maybe that the cubic sequence has three real roots, but that's not necessarily an integer condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps part (a) required that the cubic sequence has integer roots, so that \\( a_n = (n - r)(n - s)(n - t) \\), where \\( r, s, t \\) are integers. Then, expanding this, \\( a_n = n^3 - (r + s + t)n^2 + (rs + rt + st)n - rst \\). So, in this case, \\( b = -(r + s + t) \\), \\( c = rs + rt + st \\), \\( d = -rst \\). Then, the product \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\) would be \\( (2015 - r)(2015 - s)(2015 - t) \\times (2016 - r)(2016 - s)(2016 - t) \\). But this is still a product of six terms, each of which is an integer. So, the product can be any integer, unless there are constraints on the roots. But since roots can be any integers, the product can be any integer. So that might not restrict it.\n\nAlternatively"
