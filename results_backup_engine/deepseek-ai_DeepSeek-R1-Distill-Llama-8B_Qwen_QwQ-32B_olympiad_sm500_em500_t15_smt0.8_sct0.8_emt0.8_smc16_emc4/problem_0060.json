Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. We have a positive integer a, and we define a sequence where x\u2081 = a, and each subsequent term is x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1. Then, we define y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1. The goal is to find the maximum k where all y\u2081 through y_k are prime numbers.\n\nAlright, so starting with x\u2081 = a, then x\u2082 = 2a + 1, x\u2083 = 2*(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3, and so on. So each term is doubling the previous and adding 1. So the sequence grows exponentially, I suppose.\n\nThen, for each y_n, we calculate 2^{x_n} - 1. So, substituting the x terms:\n\n- y\u2081 = 2^a - 1\n- y\u2082 = 2^{2a + 1} - 1\n- y\u2083 = 2^{4a + 3} - 1\n- y\u2084 = 2^{8a + 7} - 1\n- ...and so on.\n\nWait, actually, let me check that:\n\nx\u2081 = a\n\nx\u2082 = 2x\u2081 + 1 = 2a + 1\n\nx\u2083 = 2x\u2082 + 1 = 2*(2a +1) +1 = 4a +2 +1 = 4a +3\n\nx\u2084 = 2x\u2083 +1 = 2*(4a +3) +1 = 8a +6 +1 = 8a +7\n\nSo that seems right. So x_n is following 2^{n-1}*(a) + (2^{n-1} -1). So for x_n, it's 2^{n-1}*(a +1) -1. Wait, that's an interesting pattern.\n\nSo y_n = 2^{x_n} -1. So y_n is a Mersenne number. Mersenne primes are primes of the form 2^p -1, where p itself"

Because Mersenne primes require the exponent to be prime. So y\u2081 is a Mersenne prime only if a is prime. Hmm. So, a has to be prime for y\u2081 to be prime.\n\nNow, then y\u2082: 2^{2a +1} -1. Is that a Mersenne prime? Well, 2a +1 needs to be prime for y\u2082 to be a Mersenne prime. Wait, not necessarily. Because 2^{2a +1} -1 could be prime even if 2a +1 is composite. But it's more likely that 2a +1 is prime for y\u2082 to be Mersenne prime.\n\nBut wait, for y\u2082 to be prime, not necessarily Mersenne, but it's of the same form. So, 2^{x} -1 is prime. So x has to be prime because if x is composite, then 2^x -1 is composite as well. So, in order for y\u2082 to be prime, x\u2082 = 2a +1 must be prime, right? Because if 2a +1 is composite, y\u2082 is composite too.\n\nSo, to have y\u2082 prime, 2a +1 must be prime. That's similar to the concept of a Mersenne prime.\n\nSimilarly, y\u2083 = 2^{4a +3} -1. So, for y\u2083 to be prime, 4a +3 must be prime. So, we can see a pattern here.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify this. Suppose a is a prime, say a=2.\n\nThen:\n\nx\u2081 = 2\n\ny\u2081 = 2^2 -1 = 3, which is prime.\n\nx\u2082 = 2*2 +1 =5, which is prime.\n\ny\u2082 = 2^5 -1 = 31, which is prime.\n\nx\u2083 = 2*5 +1 =11, which is prime.\n\ny\u2083 = 2^11 -1 = 2047.

Then y\u2083=2^{15}-1=32767. Let me check if that's prime. 32767 divided by 7 is 4681, so 7*4681=32767. So that's composite. So even though x\u2083 is composite, but even if it were prime, but here x\u2083 is composite, so y\u2083 is definitely composite. So with a=3, we have y\u2081 and y\u2082 prime, but y\u2083 is not.

So, 4a +3 must be prime, but also, y\u2083 =2^{4a+3}-1 needs to be prime.\n\nSo, to have y\u2083 prime, 4a +3 must be a prime exponent, which is necessary but not sufficient. So, for example, if a is such that 4a +3 is prime, say 4a +3=5, so a= (5 -3)/4=0.5, not integer. Next, 4a +3=7, so a=1, but a=1 gives y\u2081=1, which isn't prime. So discard a=1.\n\n4a +3=11. So, 4a=8, a=2.\n\nWait, that's the a=2 case again. So x\u2083=4*2 +3=11, which is prime. Then y\u2083=2^{11}-1=2047=23*89. So composite. So y\u2083 is composite.\n\nWait, so even though 4a +3 is prime, y\u2083 is composite. So, that doesn't help.\n\nNext, 4a +3=13, so 4a=10, a=2.5, not integer.\n\n4a +3=17, 4"

Thus, even for a=89, k would be 1.\n\nThus, the only a's that give k=2 are a=2 and a=3.\n\nWait, is there any a that gives k=3? So, y\u2081, y\u2082, y\u2083 all prime. From above, I don't see any. Because y\u2083 is either composite or not known. Wait, but let me think.\n\nIs there any a such that:\n\n- a is prime, so y\u2081 is Mersenne prime.\n\n- 2a +1 is prime, so y\u2082 is Mersenne prime.\n\n- 4a +3 is prime, so y\u2083 is Mersenne prime.\n\nSo, we need a such that a is prime, 2a +1 is prime, and 4a +3 is prime.\n\nLooking for such a.\n\nLet me check a=2:\n\na=2: 2 is prime.\n\n2a+1=5, prime.\n\n4a+3=11, prime.\n\nSo that's good. But y\u2083=2^{11}-1=2047, which is composite. So even though 4a +3 is prime, y\u2083 is not.\n\nWait, so the exponents being prime is necessary but not sufficient for y_n to be prime.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a=3:\n\na=3: prime.\n\n2a+1=7: prime.\n\n4a+3=15: composite.\n\nSo that's bad, since 4a +3 is 15, which is composite, so y\u2083 is definitely composite.\n\nHence, in a=3, y\u2083 is composite.\n\nAlternatively, a=5:\n\na=5: prime.\n\n2a+1=11: prime.\n\n4a +3=23: prime.\n\nSo, for a=5, 4a +3=23, which is prime. So y\u2083=2^{23}-1. Is that prime? Let me check: 2^{23}=8388608, so 8388608 -1=8388607.\n\nI recall that 8388607 is divisible by 47: 47*178481=8388607. So, yes, composite. So"
