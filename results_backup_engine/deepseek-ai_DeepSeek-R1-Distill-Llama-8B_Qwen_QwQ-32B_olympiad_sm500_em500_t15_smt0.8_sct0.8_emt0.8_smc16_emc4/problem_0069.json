Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst off, what exactly is a cubic sequence? I think it means that the nth term is a cubic polynomial in n, right? So each term is a cubic function of the term number n, which can be any integer, positive or negative. That makes sense.\n\nGiven that \\( a_n = n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d \\), I need to figure out something about the product \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\). But wait, the problem mentions part (a). Hmm, I wonder if part (a) has some conditions that might be relevant here? Since it's not stated, maybe it's referring to standard properties of cubic sequences? Or perhaps some condition given in part (a) that I need to consider. Since I don't have part (a) in front of me, maybe I should think about what's commonly asked in such problems.\n\nOften, in problems involving polynomial sequences, especially when dealing with consecutive terms, the difference between terms can be useful. Maybe I can find a relationship between \\( a_{n+1} \\) and \\( a_n \\), and then see how that relates to \\( a_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} \\).\n\nLet me try that.

Therefore, \\( x^2 (x -1)^2 (x^2 - x - 2) \\) can take various values. But perhaps this expression can be factored further or written in a way that reveals its properties.\n\nWait, let me compute \\( x^2 (x -1)^2 (x^2 - x - 2) \\).\n\nLet me compute (x^2 - x -2). That factors as (x - 2)(x +1), as before.\n\nSo, \\( x^2 (x -1)^2 (x -2)(x +1) \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor out the x^2 and (x -1)^2 from the (x -2)(x +1):\n\nWait, but (x -2)(x +1) = x^2 -x -2.\n\nSo,\n\n= x^2 (x -1)^2 (x^2 -x -2)\n\nHmm, I don't see an obvious way to factor this further. Alternatively, maybe consider this as a polynomial in x.\n\nBut wait, since x can be any integer, the expression can be written as x^2 (x -1)^2 (x^2 -x -2). So, perhaps this is a square times something, but maybe not necessarily a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the possible values of the expression \\( x^2 (x -1)^2 (x^2 -x -2) \\) for integer x.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can consider that this expression must be divisible by certain numbers because of the form. For example, let's see for small x:\n\nCase 1: x = 0\n\nThen, the product becomes 0^2 * (-1)^2 * (0 - 0 -2) = 0 * something = 0.\n\nSimilarly, for x = 1, it's 1^2 * 0^2 * ... = 0.\n\nx = 2: 2^2 * 1^2 * (4 -2 -2) = 4 * 1 * 0 = 0.\n\nx = -1: (-1)^2 * (-2)^2 * (1 +1 -2) = 1 * 4 *"
