Here, \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among the four triangles \\( AA_1D_1 \\), \\( BB_1A_1 \\), \\( CC_1B_1 \\), and \\( DD_1C_1 \\), and \\( S_1 \\) is the area of the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem better. We have a convex quadrilateral, so all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) lie somewhere on the sides. The areas of the four triangles formed by connecting these points are considered, and then \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest ones. The goal is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\times \\) area of \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\) is at least \\( S \\).\n\nI think the key here is to find an inequality that relates the areas of these triangles and the area of the inner quadrilateral. Maybe using mass point geometry or some area ratio theorems? Or perhaps it's a problem that can be approached using affine transformations or by normalizing the quadrilateral in some way.\n\nLet me consider a simpler case. What if \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) are the midpoints of the sides? Then the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\) would be the Varignon parallelogram, whose area is half of the original quadrilateral. But in this case, all four triangles would have equal areas, each being one-fourth of the original quadrilateral. So, \\( S \\) would be the sum of the two smallest ones, which are each a quarter, so \\( S = \\frac{1}{2} \\) times the original area"

But in this case, \\( k = 1 \\) is sufficient. However, the problem says \"for any convex quadrilateral,\" so maybe in some cases, a larger \\( k \\) is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial thought was wrong. If all four triangles have the same area, then their sum is twice \\( S \\), which is \\( 2S \\). The area of the inner quadrilateral is \\( S_1 = \\) area of \\( ABCD \\) minus sum of the four triangles. So if four triangles each have area \\( \\frac{1}{4} S_{ABCD} \\), then \\( S_1 = S_{ABCD} - \\frac{1}{4} \\times 4 = S_{ABCD} - S_{ABCD} = 0 \\). That can't be. Wait, that suggests that when all four triangles are equal, the inner quadrilateral has zero area, which makes sense because if \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) are midpoints, the inner quadrilateral is actually a parallelogram with area half of the original. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the Varignon theorem says that the midpoints form a parallelogram with half the area. So if the original quadrilateral has area \\( T \\), then \\( S_1 = \\frac{T}{2} \\). The four triangles each have area \\( \\frac{T}{4} \\), right? Because connecting midpoints divides the quadrilateral into four triangles, each with equal area.\n\nBut then \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas, but in this case, all four areas are equal. So \\( S = \\frac{T}{4} + \\frac{T}{4} = \\frac{T}{2} \\). So the inequality \\( k S_1 \\geq S \\) becomes \\( k \\times \\frac{T}{2} \\geq \\frac{T}{2} \\), which simplifies to \\( k \\geq 1 \\).

So triangle \\( BCA \\) has vertices at (1,0), (1,1), (0,0). The area is 1/2 * base * height. The base can be from (0,0) to (1,0), length 1, and the height is 1 (from (1,1)). So area is 1/2 * 1 * 1 = 1/2.\n\nSo \\( [BB_1A_1] = 1/2 \\).\n\nNow, let me set \\( v = 0 \\), so \\( C_1 = C \\). Then \\( [CC_1B_1] = 0 \\), since \\( C_1 = C \\) and \\( B_1 = C \\).

The base is from (0,1) to (1,1), length 1, and height from (0,1) is zero? Wait, no, triangle with points (0,1), (0,1), (1,1) is degenerate, area zero. Wait, that's confusing.

But this is degenerate, as points overlap. So the area \\( S_1 = 0 \\).\n\nBut the problem states that quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\) must be considered. However, in this case, it's degenerate. I think the problem assumes that the quadrilateral is non-degenerate, i.e., the four points don't lie on a straight line. So maybe this case is not considered, or \\( S_1 = 0 \\), but then \\( S = 0 \\), so the inequality is \\( k * 0 \\geq 0 \\), which holds for any \\( k \\). So this doesn't affect the minimal \\( k \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should avoid degenerate cases. Let me choose points such that \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) form a convex quadrilateral inside. So, perhaps I should avoid setting too many points to be on the vertices.\n\nLet me instead set \\( t = 0.1 \\), \\( u = 0.1 \\), \\( v = 0.1 \\), \\( w = 0.1 \\).
