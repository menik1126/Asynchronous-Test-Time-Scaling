The problem is about finding all positive integers \\( n \\) where a certain condition holds for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\). The condition is that there exists some \\( k \\) (between 1 and \\( n \\), inclusive) and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers such that the sum of \\( P \\) evaluated at the first \\( k \\) integers equals \\( P \\) evaluated at the \\( (k+1) \\)-th integer.\n\nSo, essentially, I need to ensure that no matter what monic polynomial of degree \\( n \\) I pick (with integer coefficients), I can find some \\( k \\) and those \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers where the above equation holds.\n\nI should probably start by testing small values of \\( n \\) to see if they satisfy this condition. Let's start with \\( n = 1 \\).\n\n**Case 1: \\( n = 1 \\)**\n\nHere, \\( P \\) is a linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients.

Therefore, for \\( n = 1 \\), the condition cannot be satisfied because there's no way to have two distinct integers where the polynomial gives the same value.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory.

Let me think. For any integer \\( b \\), I can choose \\( x_1 = t \\) and \\( x_2 = -b - t \\) for some integer \\( t \\). Yes, so as long as \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) are distinct, this works. So, for any quadratic polynomial, there exists a pair \\( x_1, x_2 \\) as required with \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, for \\( n = 2 \\), the condition is satisfied because we can always find such \\( k = 1 \\).

Wait, over integers, being monotonic is different. For example, \\( P(x) = x^3 \\) is increasing, but \\( P(x) = x^3 - x \\) isn't.\n\nBut overall, for a cubic polynomial, even if the leading coefficient is positive, if the lower degree terms make it non-monotonic, there can be multiple roots leading to equal outputs at different inputs.\n\nTherefore, in general, for any cubic polynomial with integer coefficients, there exist at least two distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\).

But for a cubic, it's challenging because the outputs could wrap around modulo some number. Wait, but for integers, the function is not bounded, so it's injective only if it's strictly monotonic.\n\nBut a cubic polynomial is strictly monotonic if its derivative doesn't change sign, which would require that the derivative \\( 3x^2 + 2a x + b \\) has no real roots, i.e., discriminant \\( 4a^2 - 12b < 0 \\), so \\( a^2 < 3b \\).\n\nIf that's not the case, then the derivative changes sign, so the polynomial is not strictly monotonic, hence not injective over the reals, and therefore not injective over integers either.\n\nBut in any case, even if the polynomial is not injective over integers, as shown in the previous example, it can still take the same value at different integer points.\n\nBut wait, is it possible to have a cubic polynomial where \\( P(x) \\) is injective on integers? For example, \\( P(x) = x^3 \\). Let's see: \\( x^3 \\) evaluated at different integers gives different results because each integer has a unique cube.
