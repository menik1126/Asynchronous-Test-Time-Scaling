The key property is that for every integer \\( n \\geq 15 \\) and for each subset \\( A_i \\), there must exist two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) whose sum is \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay, let me break this down. I need to partition all positive integers into \\( k \\) subsets. Each subset needs to have the property that for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there are two numbers in that subset adding up to \\( n \\).\n\nSo, essentially, each subset \\( A_i \\) must be \"dense\" enough such that any number \\( n \\geq 15 \\) can be expressed as the sum of two distinct elements within \\( A_i \\). That means each subset can't be too sparse.\n\nI remember something about partitioning sets and additive bases. An additive basis is a set of numbers such that every number beyond a certain point can be expressed as the sum of a bounded number of elements from the basis. In this case, it seems like each subset \\( A_i \\) must form an additive basis of order 2 for the integers \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nBut wait, in this problem, each subset individually has to cover all \\( n \\geq 15 \\) as sums. So each subset needs to be a basis of order 2 on its own. That's a strong condition.\n\nI wonder if this is related to Schur numbers or Ramsey theory. Schur numbers deal with partitioning integers and ensuring monochromatic solutions to equations like \\( x + y = z \\). But in this case, it's slightly different because we need each color class (subset) to contain a solution for every \\( z \\geq 15 \\).\n\nLet me think about the structure of these subsets. If a subset \\( A_i \\) has to have two numbers that add up to every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), then \\( A_i \\) must be such that for each \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there are \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in \\( A_i \\) with \\( a + b = n \\).\n\nThis is similar to saying"

Here, each individual subset must cover all \\( n \\geq 15 \\). That\u2019s quite restrictive.\n\nI need to figure out how large \\( k \\) can be such that each \\( A_i \\) is still rich enough to cover all these sums.\n\nLet me consider small examples first. Suppose \\( k = 1 \\). Then the entire set of positive integers is one subset. It's definitely possible because for any \\( n \\geq 15 \\), we can find two numbers adding up to \\( n \\) (for example, \\( 1 \\) and \\( n - 1 \\), provided \\( n - 1 \\) is in the set, which it is). So \\( k = 1 \\) works.\n\nWhat about \\( k = 2 \\)? Then I need to partition the positive integers into two subsets \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) such that in each subset, every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) can be expressed as the sum of two elements from that subset.\n\nIs this possible? Let me think. If I can partition the integers into two subsets where each subset is still rich enough to cover all the sums. Maybe coloring numbers based on some property.\n\nWait, there's a concept called \"partitioning into sum sets.\" Maybe each subset needs to be a sumset basis. Alternatively, perhaps considering parity or something else.\n\nWait, if I color numbers based on their parity, that is, even and odd. Then in each subset, say the evens, you can get all even numbers greater than or equal to 2 as sums. Similarly, the odds can get all odd numbers greater than or equal to 2 as sums. But wait, we need to get all integers \\( n \\geq 15 \\), regardless of parity. However, the even subset can only produce even \\( n \\), and the odd subset can produce odd \\( n \\). So for even \\( n \\geq 16 \\), both subsets can produce them, but for odd \\( n \\geq 15 \\), only the odd subset can. Wait, but the problem requires that every subset must have two elements adding up to every \\("

Similarly, the odd subset can't form an even \\( n \\). Therefore, partitioning into evens and odds won't work for \\( k = 2 \\).\n\nHmm, so parity is out. Maybe another partitioning?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using modular arithmetic with a different modulus. Let me think. Suppose I partition numbers into residue classes mod 3. Let's see:\n\nSuppose \\( A_1 \\) is numbers congruent to 0 mod 3, \\( A_2 \\) congruent to 1 mod 3, and \\( A_3 \\) congruent to 2 mod 3. But then, for example, in \\( A_1 \\), the sums would be 0+0=0 mod 3, 0+1=1 mod 3, etc. Wait, but each subset is only one residue class. So in \\( A_1 \\), all elements are 0 mod 3, so their sums are 0 mod 3. Therefore, \\( A_1 \\) can only form numbers congruent to 0 mod 3. Similarly, \\( A_2 \\) (1 mod 3) can form sums like 1+1=2 mod 3, 1+2=0 mod 3, etc. Wait, actually, if you have two elements in \\( A_2 \\), which are 1 mod 3, their sum is 2 mod 3. If you have one 1 mod 3 and another 1 mod 3, their sum is 2 mod 3. To get 0 mod 3, you need two elements from different subsets. But since each subset is only one residue class, the sums within a subset can't reach all residues. Therefore, this partitioning also won't work.\n\nHmm, so maybe modular arithmetic isn't the way to go here. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the problem requires that each subset is a basis of order 2 for the integers starting at 15. So each subset must be such that every number from 15 onwards can be written as a sum of two elements from that subset. So each subset must be \"dense\" enough.\n\nWhat is the minimal density required for a set to be an additive basis"

A complete sequence is one where every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of a bounded number of terms from the sequence. But in this case, it's similar but for each subset individually, the sums must cover all \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nWait, maybe I can model it as each subset being a complement of a set that is a basis of order 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of additive complements. Two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are additive complements if every sufficiently large integer can be expressed as \\( a + b \\) where \\( a \\in A \\) and \\( b \\in B \\). But here, it's about each subset containing a complement for itself.\n\nWait, each subset \\( A_i \\) must have the property that \\( A_i + A_i \\) covers all \\( n \\geq 15 \\).

A covering system is a collection of congruences such that every integer satisfies at least one congruence in the system.

Wait, actually, if you have two subsets, say, A and B, where A contains all even numbers and B contains all odd numbers. Then:\n\n- For subset A (evens): The sums of two evens are even. So A can only form even numbers. So for n even \u226515, that's okay, but for odd n \u226515, A can't form them. So that's bad.\n\n- For subset B (odds): The sums of two odds are even.
