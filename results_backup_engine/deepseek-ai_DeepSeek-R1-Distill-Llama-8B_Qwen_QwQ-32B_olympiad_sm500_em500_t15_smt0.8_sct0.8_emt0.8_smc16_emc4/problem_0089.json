Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a convex quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\). Points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) lie on sides \\( AB, BC, CD, DA \\) respectively. So, each of these points divides their respective sides. Not sure how exactly, but they're somewhere along those sides.\n\nThen, we consider the areas of four triangles: \\( AA_1D_1 \\), \\( BB_1A_1 \\), \\( CC_1B_1 \\), and \\( DD_1C_1 \\). The sum of the two smallest areas among these four triangles is \\( S \\). Additionally, \\( S_1 \\) is the area of the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\).\n\nThe condition is that \\( k S_1 \\geq S \\). And we need the smallest \\( k \\) for which this is always true, regardless of the convex quadrilateral and the choice of points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to find the minimal \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\times \\) (area of inner quadrilateral) \\( \\geq \\) (sum of the two smallest triangle areas). \n\nMaybe it's helpful to think about ratios of areas. Or perhaps find a relation between the inner quadrilateral and the areas of the four surrounding triangles. \n\nSince \\( ABCD \\) is convex, the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) lie on the sides, so the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\) is inside \\( ABCD \\). The four triangles are like the four corner triangles of \\( ABCD \\), each attached to a side.\n\nLet me visualize this: imagine quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\). On each side, a point divides the side into two parts. Connecting these points creates the inner quadrilateral, and the four triangles are around it.\n\nGiven that \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among the four triangles. So, \\( S \\) is"

So, we need an inequality that relates the inner quadrilateral's area to the sum of the two smallest triangles, and find the smallest \\( k \\) such that this holds for any possible configuration.\n\nI wonder if there's a known inequality or theorem related to convex quadrilaterals and areas of such triangles. Or maybe some optimization problem involving ratios of areas.\n\nMaybe it's helpful to consider specific cases, like when the inner quadrilateral is a parallelogram or something symmetric, because in those cases, some areas might be equal, simplifying the problem.\n\nLet's suppose that all four triangles have equal areas. Then \\( S \\) would be twice the area of one triangle. But since the inner quadrilateral's area would then be \\( S_1 = [ABCD] - 4 \\times \\text{(triangle area)} \\). But this is a very special case, maybe not general enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the positions of \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) on the sides. Let me think: if I define variables \\( t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 \\) such that each point divides the side in a certain ratio. For example, \\( A_1 \\) divides \\( AB \\) in the ratio \\( t_1:1-t_1 \\), meaning \\( AA_1 = t_1 AB \\). Similarly for others.\n\nThen, maybe I can express the areas of the four triangles in terms of these \\( t_i \\) variables, and then compute \\( S_1 \\) as the area of the inner quadrilateral. But this might get complicated, as we might need to express areas using determinants or something.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps using barycentric coordinates or affine transformations to normalize the quadrilateral into a simpler shape, like a square, since the problem is about ratios of areas which are affine-invariant. So, maybe without loss of generality, I can assume \\( ABCD \\) is a square or a parallelogram, compute \\( k \\), and then argue it's the same for any convex quadrilateral.\n\nLet me try assuming \\( ABCD \\) is a square.
