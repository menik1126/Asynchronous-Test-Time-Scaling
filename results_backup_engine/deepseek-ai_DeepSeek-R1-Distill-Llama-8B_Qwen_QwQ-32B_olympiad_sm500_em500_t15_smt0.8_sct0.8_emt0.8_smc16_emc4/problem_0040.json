            "output": "Alright, so I came across this interesting problem about polynomials, and I thought it would be a good challenge to work through it step by step. Let me try to unpack what it's asking and figure out how to approach it.\n\nThe problem is: Determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\), and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) satisfying the equation:\n\n\\[\nP(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})\n\\]\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) for which, no matter what monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree \\( n \\) or lower we pick (with integer coefficients), we can always find some \\( k \\) between 1 and \\( n \\), along with \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers, such that the sum of \\( P \\) evaluated at the first \\( k \\) integers equals \\( P \\) evaluated at the \\( (k+1) \\)-th integer.\n\nSo, essentially, for each such polynomial, there's some \\( k \\) where the sum of \\( k \\) polynomial values equals another polynomial value, and all the \\( x_i \\)s are distinct. The question is, for which \\( n \\) is this always possible?\n\nTo tackle this, I think I should start by considering small values of \\( n \\) and see if I can spot a pattern or come up with a conjecture.\n\nLet me start with \\( n = 1 \\). For \\( n = 1 \\), any monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most 1 is linear, so \\( P(x) = x + c \\) for some integer \\( c \\). Let's see if the condition holds.\n\nWe need to find \\( k \\leq 1 \\) (so \\( k = 1 \\)) and two distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\).

Did I misinterpret the problem?\n\nWait, no. Wait, \\( k \\) is a positive integer \\( \\leq n \\), so for \\( n=1 \\), \\( k=1 \\). We need \\( k+1 = 2 \\) distinct integers such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). But for a linear function, that's only possible if \\( x_1 = x_2 \\), which contradicts the distinctness. So does this mean \\( n=1 \\) doesn't satisfy the condition? But that seems counterintuitive because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the condition. Let me think again. For \\( n=1 \\), \\( k \\) can be 1, so we need two distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). But for \\( P(x) = x + c \\), this would require \\( x_1 + c = x_2 + c \\), so \\( x_1 = x_2 \\), which isn't allowed. Therefore, for \\( n=1 \\), the condition fails because we can't have two distinct integers mapping to the same value under a linear function. But that seems odd because I have a feeling that \\( n=1 \\) might actually satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting \\( k \\). Let me check the problem again: \"there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\), and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\)\". So for \\( k=1 \\), we need two distinct integers where the sum of \\( P(x_1) \\) equals \\( P(x_2) \\).

Let me consider \\( n=0 \\), but that's not positive. So perhaps \\( n=1 \\) doesn't work. But I need to verify for \\( n=2 \\).\n\nWait, let me try \\( n=2 \\). So \\( P \\) is a quadratic polynomial, say \\( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\). Let me see if I can find \\( k \\) such that \\( k=1 \\) or \\( k=2 \\) satisfying the condition.\n\nFirst, \\( k=1 \\): So we need two distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). For a quadratic, that's possible if \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) are symmetric around the vertex. Since the quadratic is \\( x^2 + bx + c \\), the vertex is at \\( x = -b/2 \\). So for any integer \\( x \\), there exists another integer \\( x' = -b - x \\) such that \\( P(x) = P(x') \\). So that works. So for \\( k=1 \\), we can find two distinct integers where their \\( P \\) values are equal. Thus, \\( n=2 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, but let me test this. For example, take \\( P(x) = x^2 \\). Then, \\( P(1) = 1 \\) and \\( P(-1) = 1 \\). So, \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = -1 \\), then \\( P(1) = P(-1) \\), so \\( k=1 \\) works.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( P(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x+1)^2 \\), then \\( P(0) = 1 \\) and \\( P(-2) ="

Wait, but for a cubic polynomial, it's not symmetric unless it's of the form \\( P(x) = (x - d)^3 + c \\), which is symmetric about \\( x = d \\). But in general, a cubic is not symmetric, so perhaps for some cases, \\( k=1 \\) might not be sufficient.\n\nWait, but even if it's not symmetric, does \\( P(x) = P(y) \\) have solutions for some \\( x \\neq y \\)? Let me see. For example, take \\( P(x) = x^3 \\). Then \\( P(1) = 1 \\) and \\( P(-1) = -1 \\), which are not equal. So in this case, there's no \\( x \\neq y \\) with \\( P(x) = P(y) \\).
