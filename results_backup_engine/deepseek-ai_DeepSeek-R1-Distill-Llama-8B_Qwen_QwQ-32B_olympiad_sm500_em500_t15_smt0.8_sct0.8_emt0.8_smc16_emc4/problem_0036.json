Let's try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the requirements. We have a polynomial \\( P \\) that's monic, meaning the leading coefficient is 1. It can have integer coefficients, and it can be of degree anywhere from 0 up to \\( n \\). The goal is to show that for each such polynomial, there exists some \\( k \\) between 1 and \\( n \\), and a set of \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers where the sum of \\( P \\) evaluated at the first \\( k \\) integers is equal to \\( P \\) evaluated at the last one.\n\nI think the key here is to consider properties of polynomials with integer coefficients. Monic polynomials with integer coefficients have certain symmetry and divisibility properties, so maybe that can be leveraged.\n\nLet me start by considering small values of \\( n \\) and see what happens.\n\n**Case 1: \\( n = 1 \\)**\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), the polynomial is linear, so \\( P(x) = x + c \\) where \\( c \\) is an integer. Let's see if the condition holds.\n\nWe need to find \\( k \\leq 1 \\). Since \\( k \\) is positive, \\( k = 1 \\). So, we need \\( x_1 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) where \\( x_2 = x_1 + 1 \\) because \\( k = 1 \\), so \\( k + 1 = 2 \\).\n\nWait, but polynomials of degree 1 are injective if the leading coefficient is non-zero, which it is here because it's monic (so leading coefficient is 1). So \\( P(x) = x + c \\) is inject"
