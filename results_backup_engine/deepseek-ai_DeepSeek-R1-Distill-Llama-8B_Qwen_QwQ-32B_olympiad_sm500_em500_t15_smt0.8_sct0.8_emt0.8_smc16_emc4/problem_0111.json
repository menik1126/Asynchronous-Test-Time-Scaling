The key property required is that for every integer \\( n \\geq 15 \\), and for each subset \\( A_i \\), there exist two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) whose sum is \\( n \\). Hmm, that's interesting. \n\nLet me try to break this down. First, I need to partition the positive integers into \\( k \\) subsets. So, every positive integer belongs to exactly one of these subsets. Now, for each subset \\( A_i \\), and for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there must be two distinct numbers in \\( A_i \\) that add up to \\( n \\). So, each subset is \"sufficiently dense\" in that you can find pairs summing to any number from 15 upwards. \n\nI suppose this relates to something like additive bases or additive complements in number theory. Maybe each subset \\( A_i \\) is a basis of order 2 within itself beyond a certain point. But I need to figure out the maximum \\( k \\) possible.\n\nLet me consider smaller values of \\( k \\) first and see how it might scale. \n\nIf \\( k = 1 \\), then the entire set of positive integers is one subset. Clearly, this works because for any \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there exist numbers like \\( 15 = 1 + 14 \\), but wait, does that hold? Actually, in the entire set, for any \\( n \\geq 15 \\), yes, because you can always find two numbers that add up to it. However, that's trivial because the entire set is just one subset. But in our problem, we need the maximum \\( k \\). So \\( k=1 \\) is possible, but we need to find the maximum.\n\nWait, actually, if \\( k \\) is too large, say \\( k = \\) some number, then the subsets would have to be too sparse, perhaps making it impossible for two numbers in each subset to add up to every \\( n \\geq 15 \\). So I need to find the largest \\( k \\) for which such a partition exists.\n\nI think this problem is"

If I color each positive integer with one of \\( k \\) colors, then each color class should have the property that for any \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there are two numbers with the same color that add up to \\( n \\).\n\nSo, what constraints does this place on the coloring? For each \\( n \\geq 15 \\), \\( n \\) must be expressible as a sum of two numbers from at least one color class. But actually, it's stronger: for each color class, every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) must be expressible as a sum of two numbers from that class.\n\nThis seems to require that each color class is what's called an additive basis of order 2, but not just globally, but within each class. So, each class individually must be a basis of order 2 beyond 15.\n\nBut if I have more color classes, each one would need to cover all the sums beyond 15, but each would have to do so without overlapping too much. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.\n\nMaybe I can think about the minimal size each subset must have. If the subsets are too large, that might interfere with each other's ability to sum to certain numbers.

The question is, what's the maximum number of such partitions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum k is 2? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose we try to partition the integers into two subsets, say even and odd numbers. Let's see if that works.\n\nTake the even numbers: the sum of two even numbers is even. So, for any even n \u226515, there must be two even numbers in the evens subset that add to n. Since n is even, that's possible. For example, n=16: 2+14, 4+12, etc. Similarly, for odd n, but wait, the even subset can't form an odd number. So, the even subset can't form odd numbers. Therefore, the even subset would fail for odd n \u226515. Similarly, the odd subset can't form even numbers. So, this partition doesn't work. So, partitioning into evens and odds is bad.\n\nHmm, so that approach won't work. Maybe another partition?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps partition numbers into residue classes mod 3? Let's see. Suppose we have three subsets: numbers congruent to 0,1,2 mod 3. Then, for each subset, can they form all n \u226515?\n\nTake subset 0 mod 3: elements are 3,6,9,... The sum of two elements would be 0 mod 3. So, for numbers congruent to 0 mod 3, they can be formed. But numbers congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3 can't be formed by two elements of this subset. So again, similar problem. So mod 3 partition also won't work.\n\nHmm, so maybe residue classes mod something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe partition numbers into two subsets in a different way.

The problem requires that each subset can express every n \u226515 as a sum. So, each subset needs to have a representation of all sufficiently large integers as a sum of two distinct elements.\n\nI remember that in additive number theory, a set is called a basis of order h if every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of h elements from the set. Here, each subset is to be a basis of order 2 for integers starting at 15.\n\nBut how many pairwise disjoint bases of order 2 can cover the integers? I think this is related to the concept of additive bases and the minimum number of bases needed to cover the integers.\n\nWait, but in this case, each subset is a basis on its own. So, perhaps I need to cover the integers beyond 15 with multiple bases. It feels like each subset can be thought of as \"handling\" certain sums, but I need to make sure that every n \u226515 is covered by at least one subset's sum.\n\nBut actually, the condition is stricter: each subset must cover all n \u226515.

So, B's sumset would only cover 1 mod3 and higher numbers. But A, on the other hand, can cover all residues. So, maybe A is okay, but B is missing 0 mod3.\n\nWait, perhaps B can't form 0 mod3. So, numbers divisible by 3 may not be formed by sums within B. So, perhaps 15 is 0 mod3, so 15 must be formed by two elements in B. But 15 is 0 mod3, but B only has elements that are 2 mod3, so 2+2=4, which is 1 mod3, not 0. So 15 cannot be formed by two elements of B.

But in reality, density considerations might not directly apply here.\n\nWait, more carefully, the result is that a set S with positive density is a basis of order h=2. So, if each subset has positive density, each is a basis. So, in theory, you can partition N into as many subsets as you want, each with positive density, provided 1/k is positive, which it is for any finite k.\n\nBut that seems conflicting with the problem's stipulation that for all n \u226515, each subset must contain two numbers summing to n. But perhaps it's not conflicting because each subset, having positive density, will be a basis.\n\nHowever, the key is whether such a partition is possible, and what the maximum k is. Because in reality, not all partitions will work. For example, the evens and odds partition doesn't work, as we saw.\n\nBut if we can find a way to partition N into k subsets each with positive density, then each would be a basis. For example, if we partition N into k residue classes mod k, then each class has density 1/k, and thus each is a basis.\n\nBut wait, earlier when we took mod 2, it didn't work because of residue issues, but if we take mod k for higher k.\n\nWait, actually, let me think of k=3. Suppose we partition N into three residue classes mod3: 0,1,2. Each has density 1/3.\n\nBut wait, as before, 0 mod3 cannot sum to 1 mod3 or 2 mod3, so they cannot form numbers like 1,2,... mod3, which are less than 3. But in our problem, it's about n \u226515, so perhaps beyond 15, residues will not be an issue?\n\nWait, let me think. For n=15, which is 0 mod3, to have two numbers in the 0 mod3 subset summing to 15, that's fine because 0+0="

So, if we have progressions with differences 2 and 3, their sumset would cover all residues mod6.\n\nTherefore, perhaps each subset can contain multiple arithmetic progressions with different differences, ensuring that their sumset covers all residues.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum k is 2 because the set can be expressed as the union of two sets, each of which is a basis. But perhaps the answer is 3.\n\nWait, I think the maximum k is 3. Because according to a result in additive number theory, the set of positive integers can be partitioned into three sets, each of which is a basis of order 2. But I'm not 100% sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 2 because you can partition the integers into two sets, each being sufficiently dense to form all sums beyond 15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 3, as in the case of the Schur numbers. Schur number is the smallest number such that if you color the numbers 1 to Schur(n), there's a monochromatic solution to a+b=c. The Schur number is 5, but I don't think that's directly applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for a known result. I think that the maximum k is 2. Because, in the paper \"Partitions of the integers into sum-free sets\", but that's about sum-free sets, which is different.\n\nWait, but here, each subset is not"

But can it be higher?\n\nWait, if it can be partitioned into two, then perhaps into more?\n\nWait, according to a theorem by Erdos and Graham, the integers can be partitioned into two additive bases of order 2. But I'm not sure about more than two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is 3. Let me think of the following construction:\n\nLet me partition the integers into three sets A, B, C such that each contains numbers congruent to 0 mod3, 1 mod3, and 2 mod3 respectively. But as before, each subset can't form numbers of other residues. So that won't work.\n\nAlternatively, partition into three sets where each set contains numbers congruent to 0,1 mod3 and 0,2 mod3 and 1,2 mod3. But overlapping residues.\n\nWait, let me try:\n\nLet A contain numbers congruent to 0 or 1 mod3,\n\nB contain 0 or 2 mod3,\n\nC contain 1 or 2 mod3.\n\nThen each set has two residues mod3. The sumset of A can cover:\n\n0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+1=2 mod3. So, A can form all residues.\n\nSimilarly for B and C. So, each subset can form any residue mod3. Thus, if they are dense enough, they can form all numbers beyond some point.\n\nTherefore, if each subset is sufficiently dense, this could work.\n\nNow, let's see if this partition works.\n\nTake A: 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10,...\n\nB: 0,2,3,5,6,8,9,11,...\n\nC:1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,...\n\nNow, check for n=15:\n\nIn A: 0+15=15 (but 15 is in A?), 15 mod3 is 0, so yes. 0+1"

Both 6 and 9 are in A. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, in B: 3+12=15 (both in B), 6+9=15 (both in B). So, B can form 15.\n\nIn C: 7+8=15, but 8 is in B. 5+10=15, 10 is in A. 4+11=15, 11 is in C. 11 is in C (11 mod3=2). So, 4 is in A, 11 is in C. Hmm, 11 is in C, 4 is in A. So, 4+11=15, but 4 is not in C, so can't form in C. Alternatively, 7+8=15, but 8 is in B. 2+13=15, 2 is in C, 13 is in A. 5+10=15, 5 is in C, 10 is in A. So, C can't form 15 within itself. Therefore, this partition fails.\n\nTherefore, the problem remains.\n\nWait, maybe I need to do more sophisticated partitioning.\n\nWait, perhaps it's time to refer to known theorems.
