Maybe by writing down my thoughts, it'll help me understand it better. Let me try to parse the problem first.\n\nWe're given a positive integer \\( a \\). Using this, we define a sequence of integers \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots \\) where \\( x_1 = a \\) and each subsequent term is defined by \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 \\) for \\( n \\geq 1 \\). Then, another sequence \\( y_n \\) is defined as \\( y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1 \\). The question is asking for the largest possible \\( k \\) such that, for some positive integer \\( a \\), the numbers \\( y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k \\) are all prime.\n\nHmm, okay. So we're looking for the maximum \\( k \\) where all the first \\( k \\) terms of the sequence \\( y_n \\) are prime numbers. That \\( k \\) should be the largest possible across all choices of \\( a \\).\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the sequences. The \\( x \\)-sequence starts with \\( a \\), then each term is double the previous term plus one. So, for example, \\( x_2 = 2a + 1 \\), \\( x_3 = 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3 \\), and so on. This seems like a linear recurrence, so each \\( x_n \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for \\( x_n \\). Since each term is \\( 2x_{n} + 1 \\), this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous part is \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n \\), which has the solution \\( x_n^{(h)} = C \\cdot 2^n \\). For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution \\( x_n^{(p)} = K \\). Plugging into the recurrence:\n\n\\( K = 2K + 1 \\"

Mersenne primes are primes of the form \\( 2^p - 1 \\) where \\( p \\) itself is prime. But in this case, \\( y_n \\) is a Mersenne number where the exponent itself is \\( x_n \\), which depends on \\( a \\) and \\( n \\). So for \\( y_n \\) to be prime, \\( x_n \\) must be prime as well because \\( 2^m - 1 \\) is prime only if \\( m \\) is prime. Wait, is that always true? Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, \\( 2^{11} - 1 = 2047 = 23 \\times 89 \\), which is composite even though 11 is prime. So, actually, it's more nuanced. While primes of the form \\( 2^p - 1 \\) where \\( p \\) is prime are often primes themselves, not all such exponents \\( p \\) result in Mersenne primes. So for \\( y_n \\) to be prime, \\( x_n \\) needs to be a prime"

We need the largest possible \\( k \\).\n\nSo, the plan is to first find an \\( a \\) such that \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k \\) are primes, and each \\( y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1 \\) is also prime. Then, find the maximum \\( k \\) for which such an \\( a \\) exists.\n\nLet me try to find possible \\( a \\) by testing small values of \\( k \\) and seeing if we can find an \\( a \\) that works.\n\nLet's start by considering \\( k = 1 \\). Then, \\( y_1 \\) must be prime. So \\( x_1 = a \\), so \\( y_1 = 2^a - 1 \\). So, for some positive integer \\( a \\), \\( 2^a - 1 \\) is prime. Well, that's a Mersenne prime.
