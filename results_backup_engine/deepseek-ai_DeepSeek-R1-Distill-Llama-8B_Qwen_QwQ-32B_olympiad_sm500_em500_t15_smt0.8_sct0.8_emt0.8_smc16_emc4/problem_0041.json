First, I know that monic polynomials have leading coefficient 1. So, for example, a monic polynomial of degree 2 would be \\( P(x) = x^2 + ax + b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers.\n\nThe problem is saying that for any such polynomial \\( P \\) (of degree up to \\( n \\)), I can find some \\( k \\) (from 1 to \\( n \\)) and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers where the sum of \\( P \\) evaluated at the first \\( k \\) integers equals \\( P \\) evaluated at the \\( (k+1) \\)-th integer.\n\nI think I should start by testing small values of \\( n \\) to see if I can spot a pattern or figure out which \\( n \\) satisfy the condition.\n\nLet's start with \\( n = 1 \\). So, \\( P(x) \\) is linear and monic, which means it can be written as \\( P(x) = x + c \\) where \\( c \\) is an integer constant.\n\nI need to find \\( k \\leq 1 \\), so \\( k = 1 \\). That means I need two distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\).\n\nSince \\( P(x) = x + c \\), \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) implies \\( x_1 + c = x_2 + c \\), so \\( x_1 = x_2 \\). But wait, \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) need to be distinct. That's a problem. So, is there a solution?\n\nWait"

Since \\( P \\) is linear, unless it's a constant function, which it's not because it's monic of degree 1, it's going to be injective. So \\( P(x) \\) will take on each integer value exactly once as \\( x \\) varies over the integers.

But since \\( P \\) is injective, this is only possible if \\( x_1 = x_2 \\), which are supposed to be distinct. So, is there a contradiction?\n\nWait, perhaps \\( k \\) doesn't have to be 1? Wait, no, \\( k \\leq n \\), so for \\( n = 1 \\), \\( k \\) can only be 1.\n\nSo, that would mean that for \\( n = 1 \\), the condition cannot be satisfied because you can't have two distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) does not satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"for every monic polynomial\". So, if even one polynomial \\( P \\) doesn't satisfy the condition, then \\( n \\) is out. In this case, since all monic polynomials of degree 1 are just linear functions, none of them will have \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) for distinct \\( x_1, x_2 \\). Thus, \\( n = 1 \\) is not a solution.\n\nHmm, so maybe \\( n \\) has to be at least 2?

But even if it's not, perhaps there exists some \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\) such that \\( P(x1) = P(x2) \\).\n\nAlternatively, since the polynomial tends to infinity as \\( x \\) goes to both positive and negative infinity, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, for any value \\( y \\), there are infinitely many \\( x \\) such that \\( P(x) = y \\). But over integers, it's not exactly the same, but maybe for some \\( y \\), there are multiple integers \\( x \\) with \\( P(x) = y \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any monic quartic, there are two distinct integers \\( x1 \\) and \\( x2 \\) with \\( P(x1) = P(x2) \\). If that's the case, then \\( k = 1 \\) would work, so \\( n = 4 \\) would satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but let me test with a specific quartic. Let's take \\( P(x) = x^4 \\). Then, as before, \\( P(1) = P(-1) = 1 \\). So, that works. For \\( P(x) = x^4 + x \\). Let's see if there are two distinct integers with the same value.\n\nSuppose \\( x^4 + x = y^4 + y \\).\n\nThen, \\( x^4 - y^4 + x - y = 0 \\).\n\nFactor \\( x^4 - y^4 = (x^2 - y^2)(x^2 + y^2) = (x - y)(x + y)(x^2 + y^2) \\).\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( (x - y)(x + y)(x^2 + y^2) + (x - y) = (x - y)[(x + y)(x^2 + y^2) + 1] = 0 \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\neq y \\), the second factor must be zero:\n\n\\( (x +"
