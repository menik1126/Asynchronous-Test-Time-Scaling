Here, \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among the four triangles mentioned, and \\( S_1 \\) is the area of the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\).\n\nFirst, I should try to understand the problem thoroughly. So, we have a convex quadrilateral, and points are selected on each side. These points form four smaller triangles and a central quadrilateral. The areas of these triangles are considered, and \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest ones. The goal is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\) times the area of \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\) is at least as big as \\( S \\).\n\nTo approach this, I think it would help to consider specific cases and possibly use inequalities related to areas in quadrilaterals. Maybe barycentric coordinates or mass point geometry could be useful, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, using coordinate geometry by assigning coordinates to the quadrilateral might help compute areas and find relations between them.\n\nLet me consider a simple case where the quadrilateral is a square. Maybe that symmetry will help. Suppose \\( ABCD \\) is a square with side length 1. Then, placing points on each side at certain positions can allow me to compute the areas of the four triangles and the central quadrilateral.\n\nBut wait, is this approach general enough? Because the problem states it should hold for any convex quadrilateral, not just squares. So, maybe the minimal \\( k \\) is more related to some inequality that holds universally, irrespective of the quadrilateral's shape.\n\nAnother thought: the problem involves four triangles and a quadrilateral. Since the sum \\( S \\) is of the two smallest areas among these four, perhaps the worst case is when three of the triangles are as large as possible, leaving two small ones. Then, we need to ensure that \\( k S_1 \\) is at least the sum of the two"

Since affine transformations preserve ratios of areas, perhaps I can transform any convex quadrilateral into a simpler one, like a square or a parallelogram, to make calculations easier.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to use the concept of division of areas by points on sides. For each side, the point divides it into certain ratios, which relate to the areas of the triangles. For example, on side \\( AB \\), point \\( A_1 \\) can be expressed as a ratio \\( t \\), so \\( AA_1 : A_1B = t : (1 - t) \\). Similarly for the other sides.\n\nIf I can parameterize each point \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) by some ratio along their respective sides, I might express the areas of the four triangles in terms of these parameters. Then, I can write the areas of the triangles and \\( S_1 \\) in terms of these parameters and analyze the inequality.\n\nLet me try to model this. Suppose on side \\( AB \\), \\( A_1 \\) divides \\( AB \\) in the ratio \\( t:1-t \\). Similarly, on \\( BC \\), \\( B_1 \\) divides \\( BC \\) in ratio \\( u:1-u \\); on \\( CD \\), \\( C_1 \\) divides in ratio \\( v:1-v \\); and on \\( DA \\), \\( D_1 \\) divides in ratio \\( w:1-w \\).\n\nThen, the area of triangle \\( AA_1D_1 \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( t \\) and \\( w \\), right? Because it's a triangle with vertices at \\( A \\), \\( A_1 \\), and \\( D_1 \\). Similarly for the others.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\). Let me place \\( A \\) at \\( (0, 0) \\), \\( B \\) at \\( (1, 0) \\), \\( C \\) at \\( (1, 1) \\), and \\( D \\) at \\( (0, 1) \\).
