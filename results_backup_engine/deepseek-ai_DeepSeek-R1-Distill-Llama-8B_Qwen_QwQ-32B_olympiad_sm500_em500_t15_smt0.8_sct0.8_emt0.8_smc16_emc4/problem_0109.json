Let me try to understand and solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states: Determine the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) such that the set of positive integers can be partitioned into \\( k \\) subsets \\( A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{k} \\) with the property that for all integers \\( n \\geq 15 \\) and all \\( i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\), there exist two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) whose sum is \\( n \\).\n\nSo, we need to partition all positive integers into \\( k \\) subsets, each of which is \"additive\" for all \\( n \\geq 15 \\). That means, in each subset \\( A_i \\), for any \\( n \\) starting from 15 upwards, there are two distinct numbers in \\( A_i \\) that add up to \\( n \\).\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible \\( k \\). That is, the maximum number of such subsets we can have.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\n**Understanding the Requirement:**\n\nFor each subset \\( A_i \\), every number \\( n \\geq 15 \\) must be expressible as the sum of two distinct elements from \\( A_i \\). This seems like a covering condition for each subset \\( A_i \\).\n\nSo, each \\( A_i \\) needs to be such that for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), \\( n \\) can be written as \\( a + b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are distinct elements in \\( A_i \\).\n\nThis is similar to the concept of additive bases in number theory, where a basis of order \\( h \\) is a set such that every number can be expressed as the sum of at most \\( h \\) elements from the set. However, here it's specifically for two elements, and also, the two elements must be distinct and belong to the same subset.\n\nBut in our case, we are partitioning the positive integers into \\( k \\) subsets, each of which individually must be able to express all sufficiently large \\( n \\) as sums of two distinct elements.\n\n**First Thoughts:**\n\nI wonder if there's a known theorem or result related"

However, this problem is somewhat dual: instead of avoiding monochromatic triples, each subset must contain such triples for all sufficiently large \\( n \\).\n\nAnother related concept could be additive bases. A classic result in additive number theory is that the set of primes is an additive basis of order 2, meaning every sufficiently large integer can be expressed as the sum of two primes. But here, each subset needs to individually be a basis of order 2.\n\nWait, so perhaps each \\( A_i \\) must be a basis of order 2 for \\( n \\geq 15 \\). Then, if we can partition the integers into multiple such bases, the maximum \\( k \\) would be the answer.\n\nBut how does one partition the integers into multiple additive bases?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's equivalent to having each subset \\( A_i \\) containing numbers that are sufficiently \"dense\" to cover all sums \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nBut how to model this?\n\n**Approach via Partitioning Strategies:**\n\nLet me think about how to construct such subsets.\n\nIf we can find \\( k \\) subsets, each of which is an additive basis, then the partition works. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum \\( k \\) such that the integers can be partitioned into \\( k \\) additive bases each of order 2.\n\nBut what is the minimal size each subset must be? For a set to be a basis of order 2, it needs to be relatively large.\n\nI recall that the minimal size of a basis can vary, but generally, a basis requires that the set has positive density. However, in our case, the subsets can be constructed cleverly.\n\nWait, perhaps considering parity? If we use the even and odd numbers, but that's only two subsets. But can they satisfy the condition?\n\nWait, if we partition into even and odd, then for the even subset, can we get all even numbers \\( n \\geq 16 \\) by summing two even numbers? Well, two even numbers sum to an even number, yes, but each \\( n \\geq 16 \\) is even or odd. Wait, no, the even subset can only produce even sums, so for even \\( n \\geq 16 \\), it"

However, the problem requires that for each subset, all \\( n \\geq 15 \\) must be expressible as a sum from that subset. But the even subset can't produce odd numbers, so that's a problem. Similarly, the odd subset can't produce even numbers. Therefore, partitioning into even and odd subsets won't work because each subset can't cover all \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nTherefore, parity partitioning is out.\n\nHmm, so maybe another approach is needed.\n\n**Considering Modular Arithmetic:**\n\nPerhaps partitioning based on residues modulo some number. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we partition numbers based on their residue modulo \\( m \\). Let's see if this can work.\n\nSuppose we choose \\( m = 3 \\). Then residues 0,1,2. Let's see if each residue class can form the required sums.\n\nTake residue 0 mod 3: numbers like 3,6,9,... To get a sum \\( n \\geq 15 \\), say 15. 15 can be 3+12, 6+9, etc. So that's okay. But for numbers like 16, which is 1 mod 3. Wait, but residue 0 mod 3 can't form 16, since 16 mod 3 is 1. So the residue 0 mod 3 subset can't form numbers congruent to 1 mod 3. Therefore, this approach also fails.\n\nSame problem as parity. Each residue class can only form sums congruent to 0 mod 3, so they can't reach numbers in other residues. So that won't work.\n\nTherefore, perhaps a different partitioning strategy is needed.\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n\nMaybe instead of partitioning based on residues, we can use a greedy approach. Let me think of how to construct such subsets.\n\nSuppose we want each subset to have enough numbers so that for any n \u226515, there are two numbers in the subset adding to n. To do this, each subset must be \"dense\" enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each subset must contain an infinite arithmetic progression?

So for n=28, B cannot form it because the numbers in B only go up to 14. Wait, but n=28 is greater than 15, so B must be able to form 28.

However, this seems counterintuitive because the problem is presented as non-trivial, implying that k>1 is possible.\n\nBut after exhausting various partitioning strategies and repeatedly finding that k=1 is the only viable solution, I must conclude that the answer is k=1.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when k=1, the entire set is the only subset, so it trivially satisfies the condition because every n \u226515 can be expressed as a sum of two numbers (for example, 1 and n-1). So yes, k=1 works.\n\nBut is there a higher k?\n\nGiven all my failed attempts, perhaps k=1 is the maximum.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another approach. Let me consider the following partition:\n\nDefine A1 as {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...}, the powers of 2.\n\nDefine A2 as the rest of the numbers.\n\nNow, check if A1 can form all n \u226515.\n\nWell, the powers of 2 grow exponentially, so the sums would be sparse. For example, for n=15, the possible pairs in A1 are 1+2=3, 1+4=5, 1+8=9, 1+16=17, etc. So 15 cannot be formed by two distinct elements in A1. Therefore, A1 can't form 15.\n\nThus, this partition doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using other exponential sequences.\n\nBut this approach also fails.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nAfter extensive consideration and multiple partitioning strategies, none of which successfully partition the positive integers into more than one subset satisfying the given condition, it appears that the only feasible solution is k=1. Therefore, the greatest positive integer k is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) such that the set of positive integers can be partitioned into \\( k \\) subsets \\("
