The key property here is that for every integer \\( n \\geq 15 \\) and for each subset \\( A_i \\), there must exist two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) whose sum is exactly \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We're partitioning all positive integers into \\( k \\) subsets, and for each subset and each \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there should be two numbers in that subset adding up to \\( n \\). So, essentially, each subset \\( A_i \\) must be such that it's \"dense\" enough in the number line beyond 15 to cover all possible sums \\( n \\).\n\nI recall that in partition problems like this, especially those involving additive properties, concepts like arithmetic progressions and bases come into play. Maybe I can structure the subsets in such a way that each subset avoids certain arithmetic patterns that would prevent them from covering all sums.\n\nLet me consider the simplest case first: if \\( k = 1 \\), then the set of all positive integers is just one subset. In this case, for any \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there exist two numbers in \\( A_1 \\) that add up to \\( n \\) because all numbers are included. However, if \\( k = 2 \\), we need to split the numbers into two subsets where each subset individually has pairs adding up to every \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nThis makes me think of using a 2-coloring of the integers such that each color class satisfies the required property. However, I need to ensure that even the larger \\( n \\) values are covered. Maybe I can structure the subsets using some periodicity or modular arithmetic.\n\nWait, perhaps using a concept similar to Schur numbers. Schur numbers deal with partitioning the integers and ensuring monochromatic solutions to equations like \\( a + b = c \\). However, in this problem, it's more about ensuring that for each \\( n \\geq 15 \\), each color class contains at least one pair that sums to \\( n \\). So it's a bit different, but similar partitioning principles"

An additive basis of order 2 is a set such that every sufficiently large integer can be expressed as the sum of two elements from the set. Here, each subset \\( A_i \\) must be an additive basis of order 2 for the integers starting at 15. The question is then, what's the maximum number of such bases we can partition the integers into?\n\nThe classic example of an additive basis is the set of all integers, but if we partition them into subsets, each subset must still be a basis. The more subsets we have, the sparser each subset can be, but they still need to cover all the required sums.\n\nLet me think of how to construct such subsets. Suppose we try to partition the integers into two subsets. Let's say even and odd numbers. Then, for any even \\( n \\geq 15 \\), we can get it as the sum of two even numbers, and for odd \\( n \\), we need an even and an odd. But in this case, each subset (evens and odds) can't form all the required sums on their own. For example, the even subset can only form even sums, so for an odd \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there's no way to get that sum from two even numbers. Similarly, the odd subset can only form even sums (since odd + odd = even). Therefore, this partition doesn't work because each subset can't cover all \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nHmm, so maybe partitioning based on parity isn't the way. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps using residue classes modulo some number. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we try modulo 3. If we partition numbers into residue classes mod 3, then each residue class (0,1,2 mod 3) would have numbers spaced every 3. But similar to parity, the sums would be limited. For instance, numbers in residue 0 mod 3 can only sum to 0 mod 3, so they can't form numbers congruent to 1 or 2 mod 3. So that's not going to work either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different partitioning strategy. Let me think of splitting numbers into two sets where each set contains numbers in certain intervals. For example, maybe one set contains all numbers congruent to 1 mod 4 and"

Wait, but earlier with parity, we saw that if one set can only form even or odd sums, that might not be sufficient. Let me test this.\n\nSuppose \\( A_1 \\) contains numbers that are 1 mod 4: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17,... and \\( A_2 \\) contains numbers that are 0 mod 4: 4, 8, 12, 16,... but then, in this case, \\( A_1 \\) can only produce sums that are 2 mod 4 (since 1+1=2, 1+5=6, which is 2 mod 4, etc.), so \\( A_1 \\) can only reach sums congruent to 2 mod 4, which is a problem because other sums like 3 or 1 mod 4 can't be formed. Similarly, \\( A_2 \\) can only sum to 0 mod 4. So, this partitioning won't work as not all \\( n \\geq 15 \\) can be formed in each subset.\n\nWait, perhaps the partitioning should be more intricate. Maybe each subset should contain numbers that are spread out in such a way that they can form every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) when added together.\n\nAnother thought: what if we use the concept of a basis, where each subset is a basis of order 2 for the integers beyond a certain point. If each subset is a basis, then the problem is solved. But what is the minimal number of such bases needed to partition the integers?\n\nI know that every set of positive integers is a basis of order h for some h, but here we need each subset to be a basis of order 2 for the integers starting at 15.\n\nWait, but perhaps if each subset is structured in a way that it contains numbers in a progression with a certain difference, such as an arithmetic progression. For example, if each subset is an arithmetic progression with difference 2, but that might just be the even and odd numbers again.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the concept from additive number theory called additive basis.

The question is, what's the maximum number of such subsets?\n\nI recall that there's a theorem by Erdos which states that the integers can be partitioned into two additive bases, but I might be misremembering.

So B would be 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17,...\n\nBut let's check if A can form all n \u226515. A consists of numbers 1 mod 3. The sum of two numbers from A will be 2 mod 3, so A cannot form n that is 0 or 1 mod 3. Similarly, B consists of numbers 2 mod 3, so their sum is 1 mod 3. So:\n\n- A: sums to 2 mod3\n- B: sums to 1 mod3\n\nThus, together, they can form all n except n \u22610 mod3. So, this partitioning fails because numbers n \u22610 mod3 can't be formed by the sum of two elements from either A or B.

So, for example, subset A can only form sums congruent to 2 mod3, so it can't form numbers congruent to 0 or 1 mod3.

But this might require more subsets.\n\nWait, another angle: For each subset, it must contain an arithmetic progression with a common difference small enough to cover all the numbers from 15 onwards. For example, if a subset contains an arithmetic progression with difference 1, then it's the entire set of integers, which is not useful. But if it's a coarser progression, it might not be able to cover all sums.\n\nWait, perhaps considering the concept of additive complements. Two sets A and B are additive complements if every sufficiently large integer can be expressed as a + b where a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B. But in our case, each subset must be its own complement, which is a stronger condition.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of graph theory. Imagine representing the integers as vertices, and drawing edges between numbers that sum to n \u226515. Then, the problem reduces to covering all these edges with k complete graphs, each corresponding to a subset, ensuring that every edge is covered.\n\nBut this might be too abstract. Let me see if I can find a more concrete approach.\n\nPerhaps I can model this problem after the concept of covering systems. A covering system is a collection of congruences such that every integer satisfies at least one congruence in the collection. Here, we need a covering in terms of sums.

So, in this partition, both subsets A and B can form all residues, but only A can form n\u22610 mod3, and B can only form n\u22611 mod3.\n\nWait, but for n=15 which is 0 mod3, it's in A, and n=16\u22611 mod3, which is formed in A, and n=17\u22612 mod3, which is formed in A, and n=18\u22610 mod3, formed in A. Similarly, n=19\u22611 mod3, can be formed as 1+18=19, which is in A. n=20\u22612 mod3, can be 2+18=20, but 2 is in B and 18 is in A, so that doesn't work. Alternatively, 5+15=20, but 5 is in B and 15 is in A. Alternatively, 8+12=20, 8 is in B and 12 is in A. Hmm, wait, so can we get 20 from two elements in A?\n\nYes, 4+16=20, both in A. 4 is in A (mod3=1), 16 is in A (mod3=1). So 4+16=20.\n\nSimilarly, n=21\u22610 mod3, can be formed by 3+18=21, both in A.\n\nWait, so maybe for subset B, which is numbers\u22612 mod3, can they form all n\u22611 mod3? Let's test n=19. 19 is 1 mod3. Can we form 19 from two elements in B? Let's see, B contains 2,5,8,11,14,17,...\n\nLooking"
