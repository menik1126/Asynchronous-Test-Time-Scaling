Here, \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among the four triangles mentioned: \\( AA_1D_1, BB_1A_1, CC_1B_1, \\) and \\( DD_1C_1 \\). \\( S_1 \\) is the area of the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\).\n\nAlright, let me break this down. I need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that no matter how the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) are chosen, the inequality holds. That means \\( k \\) has to be an upper bound for \\( \\frac{S}{S_1} \\) across all possible configurations.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the problem. Imagine a convex quadrilateral, and points on each side dividing them into segments. Then, we have four triangles formed by connecting these points in a particular way, and a quadrilateral in the middle. The areas of these triangles and the middle quadrilateral are related by this inequality.\n\nI recall that in optimization problems involving convex quadrilaterals, sometimes affine transformations can be used to simplify the problem because they preserve ratios of areas and the ratios of lengths along sides. Maybe I can assume without loss of generality that \\( ABCD \\) is a square or some other regular quadrilateral to make calculations easier.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I should express the areas of the triangles and \\( S_1 \\) in terms of the positions of \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) on the sides.\n\nLet me parameterize the positions of each point. Let's denote:\n\n- On side \\( AB \\), let \\( A_1 \\) divide \\( AB \\) in the ratio \\( t : (1 - t) \\), so \\( AA_1 = t \\cdot AB \\) and \\( A_1B = (1 - t) \\cdot AB \\).\n- Similarly, on side"

The area of a triangle can be found using determinants if the coordinates are known, but since I don't have coordinates, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, using vectors could help. But perhaps it's easier to assign coordinates to the quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\) to make the calculations manageable.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to \\( ABCD \\). Let me place \\( A \\) at \\( (0, 0) \\), \\( B \\) at \\( (1, 0) \\), \\( C \\) at \\( (1, 1) \\), and \\( D \\) at \\( (0, 1) \\). So it's a unit square. Wait, but the problem says a general convex quadrilateral. Hmm, but maybe by affine invariance, the ratio \\( k \\) will be the same for any convex quadrilateral. So, perhaps I can assume \\( ABCD \\) is a square for simplicity, and later check if this holds for general quadrilaterals.\n\nIf I assume \\( ABCD \\) is a square, then the area calculations might be easier. So let's do that.\n\nSo, in the unit square:\n\n- \\( A = (0, 0) \\), \\( B = (1, 0) \\), \\( C = (1, 1) \\), \\( D = (0, 1) \\).\n\nLet me define the"
