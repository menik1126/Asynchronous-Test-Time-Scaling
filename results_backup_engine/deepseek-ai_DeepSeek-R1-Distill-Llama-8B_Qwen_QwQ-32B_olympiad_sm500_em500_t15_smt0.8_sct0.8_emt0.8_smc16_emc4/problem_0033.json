Also, all coefficients a_i are integers.\n\nThe condition requires that for such a polynomial P, there exists some k between 1 and n, and k+1 distinct integers, such that the sum of k values of P at these integers equals the value of P at another integer.\n\nSo, for each P, we can find k and the x_i's such that this equation holds.\n\nI need to determine for which positive integers n this is true for every monic polynomial P of degree at most n.\n\nI should probably consider small values of n and see what's happening. Maybe start with n=1, n=2, etc., and see if the condition holds or fails.\n\nLet me try n=1.\n\nCase n=1:\n\nSo, degree at most 1, so P(x) is of the form P(x) = x + c, where c is an integer.\n\nWe need to find k \u22641, so k=1 (since k must be positive). So, k+1=2 distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082).\n\nBut P(x) = x + c, so P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082) implies x\u2081 + c = x\u2082 + c, so x\u2081 = x\u2082.\n\nBut wait, x\u2081 and x\u2082 must be distinct, so this is impossible. So, for n=1, the condition fails. Therefore, n=1 is not a solution.\n\nWait, but n is supposed to be a positive integer, so maybe n=1 is not acceptable. Let's check n=2.\n\nCase n=2:\n\nPolynomials are of the form P(x) = x\u00b2 + a x + b, with integer coefficients.\n\n"

Then k+1=2 distinct integers x\u2081, x\u2082 with P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). But P is quadratic, so it's symmetric around its vertex.\n\nFor P(x) = x\u00b2 + a x + b, the vertex is at x = -a/2. So, points equidistant from the vertex on either side have the same value.\n\nThus, for any P quadratic, there exist infinitely many pairs of integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082), as long as those integers are symmetric around -a/2.\n\nWait, but for a quadratic with integer coefficients, does such a pair necessarily exist with integer x\u2081 and x\u2082?\n\nYes, because if the vertex is at x = m + 0.5, then x\u2081 and x\u2082 can be m - t and m + t for some integer t. So, as long as you can have such symmetric integers, which you can for any integer t.\n\nThus, for k=1, n=2, the condition is satisfied because we can always find x\u2081 and x\u2082 with P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082).\n\nWait, but wait, the problem requires that for each monic polynomial, there exists such x_i's. So for n=2, it works for k=1.\n\nAlternatively, for k=2, it's even more flexible, because we can have two polynomials adding up to another one.\n\nBut regardless, since k=1 works, n=2 satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, but hold on. Maybe in some cases, even though P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082) is possible for k=1, maybe we cannot always find such a pair. Let me think.\n\nSuppose P(x) is x\u00b2. Then P(1) = 1, P(-1) = 1, so 1 and -1 work. Similarly, if P(x) is x\u00b2 + a x + b, then as long as a is even or odd, we can find integers around the vertex.\n\nWait, even for P"

So P(0)=0 and P(-1)=0. So those are two distinct integers with the same value. So that works.\n\nAnother example: P(x) = x\u00b2 + 3x + 2. The vertex is at x = -3/2. So, if we take x = -2 and x = -1, then P(-2) = 4 -6 +2 = 0, and P(-1) = 1 -3 +2 = 0. So again, same value. So that works.\n\nWait, so in general, for any quadratic, there are two integers equidistant from the vertex (which is at a half-integer if a is odd, or integer if a is even). So, in either case, you can find two integers symmetric around the vertex, so their P values are equal. Therefore, for any quadratic, there are two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 with P(x\u2081)=P(x\u2082). Therefore, for n=2, the condition holds because k=1 suffices.\n\nTherefore, n=2 is okay.\n\nNow n=3.\n\nWait, let's check n=3. So polynomials of degree at most 3, monic, with integer coefficients. So P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + c.\n\nWe need to show that for any such P, there exists k \u22643 and k+1 distinct integers such that the sum of k terms equals the (k+1)th term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there exists a P where this is not possible, so n=3 would not be acceptable.\n\nHmm, so perhaps n=3 is not acceptable? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=3 is okay. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose P(x) = x\u00b3. Let's see if there exist integers x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083 such that x\u2081\u00b3 + x\u2082\u00b3 = x\u2083\u00b3. But by Fermat's Last Theorem, there are no non-trivial solutions (other than"

So, in that case, can we have for k=2, the sum of two cubes is another cube?\n\nBut wait, the equation a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 = c\u00b3 has no non-trivial integer solutions. So, for P(x)=x\u00b3, the equation P(x\u2081)+P(x\u2082)=P(x\u2083) has no solution with distinct x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083. So that means, for k=2, it's impossible.\n\nBut can we find another k less than or equal to 3, say k=1?\n\nWait, for k=1, we need two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). So, does x\u00b3 = y\u00b3 have solutions with x \u2260 y? Only if x=\u03c9 and y=\u03c9\u00b2 where \u03c9 is a cube root of unity, but those are not integers. So, in integers, the only solution is x=y. So, for k=1, in this case, it's impossible because for P(x) = x\u00b3, P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082) only when x\u2081=x\u2082.\n\nSo, for P(x)=x\u00b3, neither k=1 nor k=2 works because:\n\nk=1: Only solution is x\u2081 =x\u2082, which are not distinct.\n\nk=2: Fermat's Last Theorem tells us no solutions.\n\nk=3: Let's see, sum of three cubes equals another cube. So, x\u2081\u00b3 +x\u2082\u00b3 +x\u2083\u00b3 = x\u2084\u00b3, with x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083, x\u2084 distinct.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires k+1 distinct integers, so for k=3, we need 4 distinct integers. So, the question is, does there exist four distinct integers x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083, x\u2084 such that x\u2081\u00b3 +x\u2082\u00b3 +x\u2083\u00b3 =x\u2084\u00b3.\n\nWell, I know that 3\u00b3 + 4\u00b3 + 5\u00b3 = 216, which is 6\u00b3. So, 3,4,5,6. Let me check: 3\u00b3=27, 4\u00b3=64, 5\u00b3=125. 27+64=91, 91+125=216, which is 6\u00b3. So,"

So, that works.\n\nWait, so maybe even for P(x)=x\u00b3, the condition is satisfied because k=3 works. So, perhaps n=3 is okay?\n\nWait, but let me check another polynomial. Let's take P(x) =x\u00b3 + x. Let's see if there exists k \u22643 and the required integers.\n\nFirst, check k=1: need two distinct integers with P(x\u2081)=P(x\u2082). So, x\u00b3 +x = y\u00b3 + y. So, x\u00b3 - y\u00b3 +x - y =0. Factor: (x - y)(x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2) + (x - y) = (x - y)(x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2 +1)=0. So, either x=y (which we can't have) or x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2 +1=0. Since x and y are integers, x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2 is non-negative. The minimal value is 0 when x=y=0, but then x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2 +1=1. So, the equation x\u00b2 +xy + y\u00b2 +1=0 has no real solutions, let alone integer ones. Therefore, there are no two distinct integers x and y with P(x)=P(y).
