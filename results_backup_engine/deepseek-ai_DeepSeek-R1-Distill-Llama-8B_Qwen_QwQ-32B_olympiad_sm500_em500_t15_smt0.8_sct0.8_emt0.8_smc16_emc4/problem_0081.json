Hmm, this sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, maybe I should consider the properties of convex quadrilaterals and how areas relate in such shapes. Since it's convex, all the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) lie on the respective sides, and the quadrilateral \\( A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1 \\) is also convex.\n\nI think it might help to assign coordinates to the quadrilateral to make things more concrete. Let me assume \\( A, B, C, D \\) are points in the plane with coordinates \\( A(x_A, y_A) \\), \\( B(x_B, y_B) \\), \\( C(x_C, y_C) \\), and \\( D(x_D, y_D) \\). Then, the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) can be parameterized along the sides.\n\nBut maybe that's getting too ahead of myself. Let me see if there's a more geometric approach first.\n\nSince the inequality involves areas of triangles and the area of a quadrilateral, perhaps I can express everything in terms of ratios or use barycentric coordinates.

Then, see if that \\( k \\) holds for other cases.\n\nLet me try assuming that quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\) is a square. Let's take a square of side length 1 for simplicity.

The area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates.\n\nThe area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} | (0*(0 - (1 - t)) + t*((1 - t) - 0) + 0*(0 - 0) ) | \\).

So the triangle is a right triangle with legs of length \\( t \\) and \\( (1 - t) \\). Wait, actually, no. The triangle is formed by points (0,0), (t,0), and (0,1 - t). The area is indeed \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times t \\times (1 - t) \\).\n\nSimilarly, triangle \\( BB_1 A_"

So this triangle is also a right triangle with legs of length \\( (1 - t) \\) (from \\( B \\) to \\( B_1 \\)) and \\( t \\) (from \\( B_1 \\) to \\( A_1 \\) horizontally). So the area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times (1 - t) \\times t \\).\n\nSame for triangles \\( CC_1 B_1 \\) and \\( DD_1 C_1 \\). Let me compute, say, \\( CC_1 B_1 \\). Point \\( C(1,1) \\), \\( C_1(1 - t, 1) \\), \\( B_1(1, t) \\). The base is along the line from \\( C_1 \\) to \\( C \\), which is leftwards by \\( t \\). The height is from \\( C \\) down to \\( B_1 \\), which is \\( 1 - t \\).

The base is down from \\( D \\) to \\( D_1 \\), length \\( t \\), and the horizontal distance from \\( D_1 \\) to \\( C_1 \\) is \\( 1 - t \\).
