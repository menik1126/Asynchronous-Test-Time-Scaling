The problem is about partitioning the set of positive integers into subsets with a specific property. Let me try to understand it better.\n\nThe question is asking: Determine the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) such that the set of positive integers can be partitioned into \\( k \\) subsets \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_k \\). The key property is that for all integers \\( n \\geq 15 \\) and for every subset \\( A_i \\), there exist two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) whose sum is \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So we need to split all positive integers into \\( k \\) groups, and each group needs to have the property that every number from 15 upwards can be expressed as the sum of two distinct numbers from that group. Our goal is to find the maximum possible \\( k \\).\n\nFirst, let me rephrase the problem to ensure I understand it correctly. We need to partition \\( \\mathbb{N} \\) into \\( k \\) subsets. Each subset \\( A_i \\) must be such that for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), \\( n \\) can be written as \\( a + b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are distinct elements of \\( A_i \\).\n\nSo, each subset is \"sum-rich\" in the sense that beyond 15, every integer can be formed by adding two distinct elements. This sounds a bit like a basis for the integers beyond 15, but within each subset.\n\nI think it would help to consider how numbers can be expressed as sums. Remember that the set of positive integers is infinite, so each subset \\( A_i \\) needs to be infinite as well because we have to include all numbers. But since we're partitioning them into \\( k \\) subsets, each \\( A_i \\) must also be infinite. However, each \\( A_i \\) has to cover all sums \\( n \\geq 15 \\) with two distinct elements.\n\nLet me think about a simpler case first. Suppose \\( k = 1 \\). Then the entire set of positive integers is one subset. Does this subset satisfy the condition? Well, for any \\( n \\geq 15 \\), we can always find two numbers in \\( \\mathbb{N"

We have to partition the positive integers into two subsets \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) where each subset individually satisfies the condition. Hmm, so every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) must be expressible as a sum of two distinct numbers in both \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\).\n\nHow can we partition the integers in such a way? Maybe by having each subset contain numbers spaced out enough so that we can cover the sums. But we need each subset to be able to reach every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) through their sums.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use modular arithmetic or some coloring argument? Like, coloring numbers based on certain conditions to ensure that each color class is sum-rich.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the concept of additive bases. In additive number theory, a basis is a set of numbers such that every number beyond a certain point can be expressed as the sum of a bounded number of elements from the set. Here, each subset \\( A_i \\) must be such that every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) can be written as the sum of two distinct elements from \\( A_i \\). So, each \\( A_i \\) is a basis of order 2 for the integers starting from 15.\n\nBut the challenge is not only covering all numbers beyond 15 but also doing so within each subset. Since the numbers are partitioned, we have to make sure that both subsets have this property.\n\nLet me think of a way to create such a partition. Maybe by separating numbers into even and odd? But wait, if we take \\( A_1 \\) as all even numbers and \\( A_2 \\) as all odd numbers, then in each subset, you can't get an even number as a sum of two odds because odd + odd = even, but you can't get odd numbers from two evens because even + even = even. Similarly, to get an odd number, you need one even and one odd. Therefore, in \\( A_1 \\) (all evens), you can only get even numbers as sums, and in \\( A_2 \\) (all odds), you can only get even numbers as sums as well"

Therefore, this partition doesn't work. So that approach is invalid.\n\nHmm, so maybe a different partitioning strategy is needed. Let me think of another way. Perhaps partitioning numbers based on their residue modulo some number. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we try modulo 3. Let me see. If we partition numbers into residue classes mod 3, but then each residue class would have numbers like 0 mod 3, 1 mod 3, 2 mod 3. Let's see if that could work.\n\nSuppose \\( A_1 \\) is numbers congruent to 0 mod 3, \\( A_2 \\) is 1 mod 3, and \\( A_3 \\) is 2 mod 3. Then, for each subset, can we get all numbers \\( n \\geq 15 \\) as sums?\n\nTake \\( A_1 \\): numbers divisible by 3. The sum of two elements in \\( A_1 \\) would be divisible by 3. So, for numbers not divisible by 3, like 15 is divisible by 3, but 16 isn't. So 16 can't be expressed as a sum of two elements in \\( A_1 \\). Therefore, this partition also fails.\n\nHmm, so maybe mod 4? Let me try mod 4. Suppose we partition into even and odd, but that didn't work. Alternatively, maybe partition into more subsets?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of residues, we can use a different partitioning strategy. Let me think of the concept of Schur's theorem, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is related to the concept of additive basis. Each subset must be an additive basis of order 2 for the integers beyond 15. The question is, what's the maximum number of such bases we can partition the integers into?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum k is 2? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose we can partition the integers into two subsets such that each subset is a basis of order 2 for numbers beyond 15. How would that work?\n\n"

Let me try building such subsets step by step.\n\nSuppose we have two subsets, \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\). We need to include all numbers in either \\( A_1 \\) or \\( A_2 \\).\n\nLet me think about how to cover the numbers for the sums. For example, if we include 1 in \\( A_1 \\), then we can get 1 + something = 2, 1 + something = 3, etc. But since we need all numbers from 15 onwards, maybe starting with 1 is a good idea because 1 can help build up the smaller numbers.\n\nBut wait, in \\( A_1 \\), we can have 1, and then we need to have all the necessary numbers to pair with 1 to get numbers beyond 15. But this might complicate things because 1 would need to pair with numbers up to 14 to get 15, 16, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to have a subset with small numbers and another with larger numbers, but we need both subsets to be able to cover all the sums.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Suppose we color each positive integer with one of k colors. The condition is that for any color class, every n >=15 can be written as the sum of two elements in that color class.\n\nWhat is known about such colorings? I remember that in Ramsey theory, there are results about colorings and monochromatic solutions, but this is slightly different.\n\nWait, actually, this is similar to anti-Ramsey problems, where we want to prevent monochromatic solutions, but here we want to enforce that every n >=15 is a sum in each color class.\n\nBut I might be going off track here. Let me instead think of the required condition for each color class.\n\nFor each color class \\( A_i \\), it should be a basis of order 2 for all n >=15.

So the question is, what is the minimal k for which such a coloring exists?\n\nI think the maximum k is 7.\n\nWait, I think I remember a result that the minimal number is 4 or 7, but I'm not exactly sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: think about the Schur numbers. Schur numbers deal with the number of colors needed so that there is a monochromatic solution to a + b = c. But our problem is different because in our case, we don't need a monochromatic solution, but rather for each n, each color class should have a solution to a + b = n.\n\nTherefore, Schur numbers might not directly apply here.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the following: if we can find a partition into k subsets, each of which is an additive basis of order 2 for n >=15.\n\nWhat is the maximal k?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 4.\n\nWait, in the literature, I recall that the set of positive integers can be partitioned into four sets, each of which is a basis of order 2 for the integers beyond some point.\n\nWait, in particular, I think it's 4.\n\nWait, no, let me think more carefully.\n\nWait, actually, the concept is known as \"partition regularity.\" A property is partition regular if any finite coloring of the positive integers preserves the property.\n\n"

Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\nThus, in this partition, k=3 works.\n\nSimilarly, the same logic applies to k=4.\n\nWait, can I extend this to k=4?\n\nYes, if we partition the numbers modulo4, into four subsets, each subset can form numbers of their respective congruence classes.\n\nBut as before, let me see:\n\nLet A1 be numbers 0 mod4,\n\nA2:1 mod4,\n\nA3:2 mod4,\n\nA4:3 mod4.\n\nNow, check for each subset:\n\nA1: sums are 0 mod4, so can form numbers 0 mod4.\n\nA2: sums are 2 mod4 (since 1+1=2 mod4), so can form 2 mod4.\n\nWait, actually, 1 mod4 +1 mod4=2 mod4.\n\nBut 1 mod4 +3 mod4=0 mod4.\n\nWait, A2 contains only 1 mod4 numbers. So their sums can be:\n\n1+1=2 mod4,\n\n1+5=6 mod4=2 mod4,\n\n1+9=10 mod4=2,\n\nWait, so all sums from A2 are 2 mod4. Therefore, A2 can only form numbers congruent to 2 mod4.\n\nSimilarly, A3: 2 mod4.\n\nSums of A3: 2+2=0 mod4,\n\n2+2=0 mod4,\n\nSo, A3 can only form numbers congruent to 0 mod4.\n\nA4: 3 mod4.\n\nSums of A4: 3+3=6 mod4=2 mod4,\n\n3+3=2 mod4,\n\nThus, A4"
