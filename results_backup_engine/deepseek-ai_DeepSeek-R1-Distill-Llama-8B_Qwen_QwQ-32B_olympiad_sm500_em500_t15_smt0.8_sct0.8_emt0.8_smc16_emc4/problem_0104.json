The key property is that for every integer \\( n \\geq 15 \\) and for each subset \\( A_i \\), there exist two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) whose sum is \\( n \\).\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what this means. Essentially, each subset \\( A_i \\) must be such that every number from 15 upwards can be expressed as the sum of two distinct numbers within that subset. So, no matter which subset I pick, as long as I have a number \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there should be two numbers in that subset that add up to \\( n \\).\n\nNow, I need to figure out how to partition the positive integers into as many subsets as possible, each satisfying this condition. To maximize \\( k \\), the number of subsets, each subset should, in some sense, cover all the necessary sums without overlapping too much.\n\nLet me think about how numbers can be grouped. Maybe if I group numbers in such a way that each subset contains numbers spaced out enough so that their sums cover all the required \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can think about coloring each number with a color such that for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), all pairs that sum to \\( n \\) are covered by at least one color. But since each color corresponds to a subset, I need each such pair to be in the same subset.\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach. Because if two numbers add up to \\( n \\), they need to be in the same subset. So, for each \\( n \\geq 15 \\), all pairs of numbers summing to \\( n \\) must be assigned to the same subset. But that seems too restrictive, as numbers can be part of multiple such pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each number is a vertex, and an edge connects two numbers if their sum is at least 15. Then, the problem reduces to coloring this graph such that every edge is monochromatic. But the question is asking for a partition where each subset \\( A_i \\) is such that within it, every \\("

Wait, maybe that's not exactly the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of each subset \\( A_i \\) as needing to contain, for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), at least one pair of numbers that sum to \\( n \\). So each subset must individually cover all those sums. Therefore, each subset must be a kind of additive basis for the numbers from 15 onwards.\n\nHmm, additive basis. The concept here is similar to additive bases in number theory, where a set is an additive basis of order 2 if every sufficiently large number can be expressed as the sum of two elements from the set. But here, the requirement is stronger because each subset must individually be an additive basis for all numbers \\( n \\geq 15 \\), and the entire set of positive integers is partitioned into such subsets.\n\nTherefore, the question is asking for the maximum number of such subsets (each being an additive basis for \\( n \\geq 15 \\)) that partition the positive integers.\n\nSo, to maximize \\( k \\), we need to partition the integers into as many subsets as possible, each of which is an additive basis for \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nNow, I need to recall some concepts about additive bases. The classic example is the set of all numbers, which is trivially an additive basis. But if we want multiple subsets, each of which is an additive basis, how can we do that?\n\nOne approach might be to use modular arithmetic. For example, partition numbers based on their residue modulo some integer. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we partition numbers into residue classes mod \\( m \\). Then, for each residue class \\( A_i \\), we need that for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there are two numbers in \\( A_i \\) that add up to \\( n \\). Let's see if this is possible.\n\nSuppose we choose \\( m = 2 \\). Then the residues are 0 and 1 mod 2. Let's see if each residue class can be an additive basis for \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nTake the even numbers (0 mod 2). To get an even number \\( n \\geq 15 \\), we can have two even numbers adding to it. But for an odd number \\( n \\geq 15 \\),"

Therefore, the subsets are not good enough. So, \\( m = 2 \\) is insufficient.\n\nWhat about \\( m = 3 \\)? Let's try that.\n\nResidues 0, 1, 2 mod 3.\n\nTake the subset of numbers congruent to 0 mod 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc. Can these numbers, when added together, cover every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) as sums? Let's see:\n\n- For \\( n = 15 \\): 15 can be written as 3 + 12, 6 + 9.\n\n- For \\( n = 16 \\): Can 16 be written as the sum of two multiples of 3? 16 divided by 3 is 5.333, so 3*5=15. 15 + 3 = 18, which is beyond. 12 + 3 = 15. So, 16 cannot be expressed as the sum of two numbers from the 0 mod 3 set. So, that subset doesn't cover all \\( n \\geq 15 \\). Hence, using mod 3 is also insufficient.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the way. Maybe instead of partitioning into residues, I need a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps color the numbers based on some other property. For each number, assign a color such that for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), at least one pair in each color class sums to \\( n \\).\n\nBut, considering the requirement, for each \\( n \\geq 15 \\), in each subset \\( A_i \\), there must be such a pair. So, each subset \\( A_i \\) must individually contain pairs summing to each \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nThat sounds like each subset needs to be a complete additive basis for the integers \\( n \\geq 15 \\). So, in that case, each \\( A_i \\) must be such that \\( A_i + A_i \\) contains all \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nWait, so each subset is a complete additive basis for all \\( n \\geq 15 \\).
