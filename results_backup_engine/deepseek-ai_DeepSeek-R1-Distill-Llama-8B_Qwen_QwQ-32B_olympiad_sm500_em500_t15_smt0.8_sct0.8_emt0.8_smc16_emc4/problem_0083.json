Here, \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among the four triangles \\( AA_1D_1, BB_1A_1, CC_1B_1, DD_1C_1 \\), and \\( S_1 \\) is the area of quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\).\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem better. We have a convex quadrilateral, which means all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the sides don't cross each other. Points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) are on the sides of this quadrilateral. Then, we form four triangles by connecting these points, and also a quadrilateral in the center. The areas of these four triangles can vary depending on where the points are placed, but \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest ones. Our goal is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\) times the area of the central quadrilateral is at least \\( S \\).\n\nI think the key here is to relate the areas of the four triangles and the central quadrilateral. There might be some ratio or proportion that we can exploit. Maybe using barycentric coordinates or area ratios in convex quadrilaterals.\n\nOne approach could be to consider the properties of convex quadrilaterals and how points lying on their sides affect the areas of the resulting triangles and the central quadrilateral. Maybe using affine transformations to normalize the quadrilateral, making calculations easier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe applying the pigeonhole principle because we have four areas and we're summing the two smallest ones. That might help establish a lower bound for \\( S \\) in terms of the total area.\n\nBut I need to be more precise. Let's try to express the areas of the four triangles and the central quadrilateral in terms of the positions of points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\).\n\nLet me parameterize the positions of the points"

Maybe there's a symmetric case where all the ratios are equal, which could lead us to the minimal \\( k \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering a square or a rectangle for simplicity, as symmetry might help in finding the minimal \\( k \\).\n\nLet's assume \\( ABCD \\) is a square for simplicity.
