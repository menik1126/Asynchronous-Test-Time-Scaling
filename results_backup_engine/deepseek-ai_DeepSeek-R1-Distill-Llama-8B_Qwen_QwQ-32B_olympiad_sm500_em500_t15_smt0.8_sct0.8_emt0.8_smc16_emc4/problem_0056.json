The sequence is defined as x\u2081 = a and x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 for n \u2265 1. Then, y_n is defined as 2^{x_n} - 1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the sequence x_n. Starting with x\u2081 = a, each subsequent term is double the previous term plus one. So:\n\nx\u2081 = a\n\nx\u2082 = 2a + 1\n\nx\u2083 = 2*(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 2 + 1 = 4a + 3\n\nx\u2084 = 2*(4a + 3) + 1 = 8a + 6 + 1 = 8a + 7\n\nI see a pattern here. Each term is 2^{n-1} * a + (2^{n-1} - 1). Wait, let me confirm that:\n\nFor n=1, x\u2081 = a = 2^{0}a + (2^{0} - 1) = a + (1 - 1) = a. Yep, that works.\n\nFor n=2, x\u2082 = 2a +1 = 2^{1}a + (2^{1} - 1) = 2a + 1. Good.\n\nn=3: 4a + 3 = 2^{2}a + (2^{2} -1) = 4a + 3. Perfect.\n\nSo, in general, x_n = 2^{n-1} * a + (2^{n-1} - 1). That's a good formula to have.\n\nNow, y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1. So, for each n, y_n is a Mersenne number. Remember, a Mersenne number is 2^p -1 where p is prime. But not all Mersenne numbers are prime. For example, 2^{11} -1 = 2047 = 23*89, which is composite.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for"

So, we need to find a starting a so that y\u2081, y\u2082, ..., y_k are primes, and find the maximum possible k.\n\nSince we're dealing with y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1, each y_n depends on x_n, which is built from a via the recurrence relation. So, a needs to be chosen such that each y_n is prime. We need to find the maximum such k.\n\nLet me start by considering small values of k and see what constraints they impose on a, then see if a can satisfy all of them.\n\nFirst, y\u2081 = 2^{x\u2081} -1 = 2^a -1. So, 2^a -1 must be prime. That means a must be prime. Because if a is composite, say a=4, then 2^4 -1 = 15, which is composite. Thus, a must be prime. So, a must be a prime number.\n\nSo, a is prime. Let me note that down: a \u2208 Primes.\n\nNow, y\u2082 = 2^{x\u2082} -1 = 2^{2a +1} -1. For y\u2082 to be prime, 2^{2a +1} -1 must be prime. Now, 2^{m} -1 is prime only if m is prime, but the converse is not true (as 2^{11} -1 is composite). So, y\u2082 being prime doesn't necessarily require 2a +1 to be prime, but in this case, 2a +1 is an exponent. Wait, no, 2^{something} -1 is prime only if that something is prime (Mersenne primes). But 2a +1 might not be prime.
