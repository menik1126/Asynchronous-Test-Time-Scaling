Here, \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among the four triangles \\( AA_1D_1, BB_1A_1, CC_1B_1, DD_1C_1 \\), and \\( S_1 \\) is the area of the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem better. It seems like it's related to areas in convex quadrilaterals and how certain triangles and the inner quadrilateral relate. The goal is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that the area of this inner quadrilateral times \\( k \\) is at least the sum \\( S \\) of the two smallest triangle areas.\n\nMaybe I can start by considering some specific cases or simpler quadrilaterals where the problem reduces to something manageable.\n\nLet me consider a square as a convex quadrilateral. It's a regular shape, so calculations might be easier.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose \\( ABCD \\) is a square with side length \\( a \\). Then, all sides are equal, and all angles are right angles.\n\nNow, let me choose points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) on each side in such a way that the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\) is also a square or maybe a rectangle. Wait, no, that might not hold unless the points divide the sides proportionally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place the points in such a way that the areas of the four triangles are equal. If all four areas are equal, then \\( S \\) would just be twice the area of one triangle, so \\( S = 2 \\times \\text{area}(AA_1D_1) \\).\n\nBut I need a more systematic approach. Perhaps using coordinates could help. Let me assign coordinates to the square.\n\nLet\u2019s place the square \\( ABCD \\) with coordinates: \\( A = (0, 0) \\), \\( B ="
