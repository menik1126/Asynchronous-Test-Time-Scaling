Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the sequences involved. We have x\u2081 = a, and each subsequent term is defined by x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1. Then, y_n is defined as 2^{x_n} - 1. So, y\u2081 would be 2^{a} - 1, y\u2082 would be 2^{x\u2082} - 1, and so on.\n\nI need to find the largest k where all y\u2081 to y_k are prime. That means I need to figure out what a should be so that as many y's as possible are primes.\n\nLet me try to compute the first few y's for a small a and see what happens. Let's choose a = 1 first.\n\nIf a = 1:\nx\u2081 = 1\ny\u2081 = 2^1 - 1 = 1. Wait, 1 isn't a prime number. So that's out.\n\nNext, a = 2:\nx\u2081 = 2\ny\u2081 = 2^2 - 1 = 3, which is prime.\nx\u2082 = 2*2 + 1 = 5\ny\u2082 = 2^5 - 1 = 31, which is also prime.\nx\u2083 = 2*5 + 1 = 11\ny\u2083 = 2^11 - 1 = 2047. Hmm, is 2047 prime? Let me check. 2047 divided by 23 is 89, right? Because 23*89 = 2047. So, 2047 is not prime. That means for a = 2, we can only get y\u2081 and y\u2082 as primes, so k would be 2.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a larger a that can give more primes. Let's try a = 3.\n\na = 3:\ny\u2081 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7, prime.\nx\u2082 = 2*3 + 1 = 7\ny\u2082 = 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127, which is prime.\nx"

Let me check 7*4681. 7*4000=28000, 7*600=4200, 7*81=567. So adding up: 28000 + 4200 = 32200, plus 567 is 32767. So yes, 32767 is divisible by 7, hence not prime. So for a = 3, we get y\u2081 and y\u2082 as primes, same as a = 2.\n\nHmm, maybe a = 4.\n\na = 4:\ny\u2081 = 2^4 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15. 15 is not prime.

Maybe trying a larger a, but perhaps I can see a pattern.\n\nWait, maybe if I consider a such that y\u2081 = 2^a -1 is prime. So a must be a prime exponent. Let me recall that Mersenne primes are 2^p - 1 where p is prime.\n\nSo for y\u2081 to be prime, a must be a prime number. So a needs to be prime, and y\u2081 is a Mersenne prime.\n\nBut then, even if y\u2081 is a Mersenne prime, y\u2082 may not be. So maybe I can find a where both y\u2081 and y\u2082 are primes, but y\u2083 isn't.\n\nLet me think: for y\u2082 to be prime, 2^{x\u2082} -1 must be prime. But x\u2082 = 2a + 1. So y\u2082 = 2^{2a + 1} -1.\n\nWait, 2^{2a +1} -1. Let me write that as 2*(2^a)^2 -1, which can be factored as (2^a -1)(2^a +1). Wait, is that right? Let me check:\n\n(2^a -1)(2^a +1) = 2^{2a} -1, yes. But y\u2082 is 2^{2a+1} -1.\n\nWait, maybe that's a different expression. Let me compute 2^{2a +1} -1 = 2*4^a -1. Hmm, not sure if that factors easily.\n\nWait, let me consider if y\u2082 can be prime. If y\u2082 is prime, then 2^{2a +1} -1 must be prime. Let's see what that implies.\n\nSo 2^{2a +1} -1 is prime"

So m must be prime, but even then, it's not guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, for y\u2082 to be prime, m = 2a +1 must be prime, and 2^m -1 must also be prime. So, m must be a prime such that 2^m -1 is also prime, i.e., m must be a Mersenne prime exponent.\n\nSo, starting with a, which is prime (so that y\u2081 is prime), then 2a +1 must also be prime (so that m is prime), and then 2^{2a+1} -1 must be prime (so that y\u2082 is prime). So, let's see if there are such a's.\n\nLet me try a = 2:\n\na = 2 (prime). Then m = 2*2 +1 =5 (prime). Then 2^5 -1 =31 (prime). So that works. So y\u2081 and y\u2082 are primes here.\n\nThen, moving to y\u2083. For a=2, x\u2083 = 2*5 +1 =11, so y\u2083 =2^11 -1 =2047, which is composite. So that's why k=2 here.\n\nSimilarly, a=3:\n\na=3 (prime). m=2*3+1=7 (prime). Then 2^7 -1=127 (prime). So y\u2081 and y\u2082 are primes here. Then y\u2083 is 2^15 -1=32767, which is composite.
