Then, there's a sequence defined as \\( x_1 = a \\) and \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 \\) for \\( n \\geq 1 \\). After that, we define another sequence \\( y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1 \\). The question is asking for the largest possible \\( k \\) such that for some positive integer \\( a \\), the numbers \\( y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k \\) are all prime.\n\nAlright, so let me break this down. First, we have the \\( x \\) sequence, which is defined recursively. Starting from \\( x_1 = a \\), each subsequent term is twice the previous term plus one. Then, each \\( y_n \\) is calculated as \\( 2^{x_n} - 1 \\). So, \\( y_n \\) is a Mersenne number, right? Because Mersenne numbers are of the form \\( 2^p - 1 \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, although not all Mersenne numbers are prime.\n\nThe problem wants the largest \\( k \\) such that \\( y_1 \\) through \\( y_k \\) are all prime. So, essentially, we're looking for a starting value \\( a \\) such that the first \\( k \\) terms of the \\( y \\) sequence are primes. And we want the maximum \\( k \\) possible.\n\nFirst, maybe I should compute \\( y_1, y_2, \\ldots \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and see for which \\( a \\) these can be prime.\n\nLet's try to express \\( x_n \\) in terms of \\( a \\). The recursion \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 \\) is a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for \\( x_n \\).\n\nIt seems like each step is doubling the previous term and adding one. So, starting from \\( x_1 = a \\), the next term is \\( 2a + 1 \\), then \\( 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3 \\), then \\( 2(4"

Let me verify that:\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 2^{0}a + (2^{0} - 1) = a + (1 - 1) = a \\). Correct.\n\nFor \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 2^{1}a + (2^{1} - 1) = 2a + 1 \\). Correct.\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 2^{2}a + (2^{2} - 1) = 4a + 3 \\). Correct.\n\nYes, so the general formula for \\( x_n \\) is \\( x_n = 2^{n-1}a + (2^{n-1} - 1) \\). That simplifies to \\( x_n = (2^{n-1})(a + 1) - 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1 = 2^{(2^{n-1}(a + 1) - 1)} - 1 \\).\n\nThat's a mouthful. So, each \\( y_n \\) is a power of two minus one, but the exponent itself is growing exponentially.\n\nNow, if we set \\( y_n \\) to be prime, then each \\( 2^{x_n} - 1 \\) must be prime. So, each \\( x_n \\) must be such that \\( 2^{x_n} - 1 \\) is prime. As I mentioned, Mersenne primes. So, \\( x_n \\) must be a Mersenne prime exponent.\n\nBut for a number like \\( 2^{x_n} - 1 \\) to be prime, \\( x_n \\) itself must be prime because if \\( x_n \\) is composite, say \\( x_n = ab \\), then \\( 2^{ab} - 1 \\) is divisible by \\( 2^a - 1 \\) and \\( 2^b - 1 \\).

So yes, \\( 2^{x_n} - 1 \\) is composite if \\( x_n \\) is composite. Therefore, for \\( y_n \\) to be prime, \\( x_n \\) must be prime.\n\nTherefore, each \\( x_n \\) must be prime.

So, the largest possible \\( k \\) is the maximum number of consecutive Mersenne primes that can be produced by this recursion, given some starting \\( a \\).\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find the maximum \\( k \\) such that for some \\( a \\), the first \\( k \\) terms of \\( x_n \\) are prime. Then, each \\( y_n \\) will be a Mersenne prime.\n\nSo, we can rephrase: what is the longest possible sequence of primes \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k \\) that can be generated by the recursion \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 \\) starting from some prime \\( a \\).
