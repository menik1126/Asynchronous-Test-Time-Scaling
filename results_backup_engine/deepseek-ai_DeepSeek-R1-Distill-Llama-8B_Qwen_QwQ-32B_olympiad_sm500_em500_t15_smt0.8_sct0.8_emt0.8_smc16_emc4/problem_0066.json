I need to find the possible values of a_{2015} multiplied by a_{2016}. The problem mentions part (a), but since I don't have the specifics of what part (a) says, I have to make some assumptions. Maybe part (a) gives some conditions on the constants b, c, and d? Since the problem refers to \"satisfying the condition in part (a),\" I think that part must have some constraints.\n\nLet me think. A cubic sequence is usually defined by four constants: a, b, c, d. Here, the coefficients are a bit different: it's a_n = n\u00b3 + b n\u00b2 + c n + d. So the coefficient of n\u00b3 is 1, which is interesting. Maybe part (a) gives some specific condition on b, c, or d?\n\nWait, if part (a) could be, for example, that the sequence is strictly increasing or something, or maybe related to symmetry? Or perhaps the sequence is required to be integer-valued for all integers n, which it already is, given that n\u00b3 is integer and b, c, d are integers. So that might not be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe part (a) tells us something about the roots of the cubic. Or perhaps it gives a condition on the difference between terms or something like that. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the condition in part (a)\", but without part (a), I can only assume that maybe in part (a), the cubic is required to satisfy a certain property, like being a permutation polynomial or something else. But without knowing, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial conditions for the cubic sequence are given. Maybe for n=0,1,2,3, we have specific values? But the problem doesn't specify, so I have to proceed without that.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, a_{n} is a cubic polynomial: a_n = n\u00b3 + b n\u00b2 + c n + d.\n\nTherefore, a_{2015} = 2015\u00b3 + b*(2015)\u00b2 + c*(2015) + d\n\nSimilarly, a_{2016} = 2016\u00b3 + b*(2016)\u00b2 + c*(2016) + d\n\nWe"

Alternatively, perhaps the cubic is such that the sequence is a permutation of integers? That might impose conditions on b, c, d.\n\nWait, since n ranges over all integers, including negatives, and we have a cubic term, which is odd-powered, so the function is odd if the other coefficients are even, but here, n\u00b3 is already odd, and the other terms: b n\u00b2 is even in n, c n is odd in n, and d is constant.\n\nSo, if b is even and c is even, then a_n would be odd in n, because n\u00b3 is odd, b n\u00b2 is even, c n is even, and d is even or odd?

Determine the possible values of a_{2015} * a_{2016}.\"\n\nWait, if that's the case, then the cubic would have roots at n = k, k+1, k+2 for some integer k. Then the cubic can be written as (n - k)(n - (k+1))(n - (k+2)) = (n - k)(n - k -1)(n - k -2). Expanding this would give a cubic polynomial with leading coefficient 1, so that would be a_n = (n - k)(n - k -1)(n - k -2).
