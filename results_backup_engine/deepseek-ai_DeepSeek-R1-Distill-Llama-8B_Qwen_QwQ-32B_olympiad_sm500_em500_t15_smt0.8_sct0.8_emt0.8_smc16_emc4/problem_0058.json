Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a positive integer a, and we define a sequence of integers x\u2081, x\u2082, etc., where x\u2081 = a, and each subsequent term is defined by x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1. Then, for each n, y_n is defined as 2^{x_n} - 1. The goal is to find the largest k where there exists some a such that y\u2081, y\u2082, ..., y\u2096 are all prime numbers. \n\nOkay, so let me rephrase that to ensure I get it. We have this recursive sequence for x_n, starting with x\u2081 = a. Then y_n is a Mersenne number for each x_n, since it's 2^something minus 1. And we need to find the maximum k where all the first k y_n's are prime.\n\nHmm, so I know that Mersenne primes are primes of the form 2^p - 1, where p itself is prime. So y_n being prime would require not just that 2^{x_n} - 1 is prime, but also that x_n is prime, right? Because if x_n is composite, then 2^{x_n} - 1 is also composite. So that's an important point.\n\nTherefore, x_n must be prime for each y_n to be prime. So, our x sequence needs to generate primes, and for each of those primes, y_n must be Mersenne primes.\n\nWait, but actually, x_n being prime is a necessary condition but not sufficient. Because even if x_n is prime, 2^{x_n} -1 might not be prime. For example, 2^11 -1 is 2047, which is 23*89, so not prime. So, x_n being prime doesn't automatically make y_n prime.\n\nBut in our problem, since we're looking for a starting a, maybe that allows us to find some x sequence where both x_n and y_n are primes for some initial k.\n\nSo, let me think about how the x sequence is built. It's defined recursively as x_{"

Let me see what the first few terms look like in terms of a.\n\nLet me write out the first few terms:\n\nx\u2081 = a\n\nx\u2082 = 2a + 1\n\nx\u2083 = 2(2a +1) +1 = 4a + 3\n\nx\u2084 = 2(4a +3) +1 = 8a +7\n\nx\u2085 = 2(8a +7) +1 = 16a +15\n\nHmm, so each term is 2^{n}a + (2^{n} -1). Let me check that formula. Let's see:\n\nSuppose x_{n} = 2^{n-1}a + (2^{n-1} -1). Let me test for n=1: x\u2081 = a, which is 2^{0}a + (2^0 -1) = a +0, correct. For n=2: x\u2082 = 2a +1, which is 2^{1}a + (2^1 -1) = 2a +1, correct. For n=3: 4a +3 = 2\u00b2a + (2\u00b2 -1) = 4a +3, yes. So the general formula is x_n = 2^{n-1}a + (2^{n-1} -1). \n\nAlternatively, factoring out 2^{n-1}, we can write x_n = 2^{n-1}(a +1) -1. Let me see:\n\n2^{n-1}(a +1) -1 = 2^{n-1}a + 2^{n-1} -1, which is the same as above. So that's another way to write it. Maybe that helps later.\n\nSo, the key is that each x_n is of the form 2^{n-1}(a +1) -1. \n\nNow, since we need each y_n = 2^{x_n} -1 to be prime, and also x_n must be prime (since otherwise y_n would be composite). So, first, for each n from 1 to k, x_n must be prime, and 2^{x"

            "output": "_n} -1 must also be prime.\n\nSo, let's start with the smallest k and try to see what constraints this puts on a.\n\nFirst, for n=1: y\u2081 = 2^{x\u2081} -1 = 2^a -1 must be prime. So a must be such that 2^a -1 is prime. So a must be a prime exponent. Because only if a is prime can 2^a -1 potentially be prime. But as I recall, all Mersenne primes have prime exponents, so that's a necessary condition.\n\nSo a has to be prime. Let's note that.\n\nNow, moving to n=2: y\u2082 = 2^{x\u2082} -1, and x\u2082 = 2a +1. For y\u2082 to be prime, 2^{2a+1} -1 must be prime. Also, x\u2082 must be prime, so 2a +1 must be prime.\n\nSo, first, a is prime, and 2a +1 must also be prime.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: x\u2083 = 2x\u2082 +1 = 4a +3. So x\u2083 must be prime. So 4a +3 must be prime.\n\nAnd y\u2083 = 2^{4a +3} -1 must be prime.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4: x\u2084 = 8a +7, which must be prime, and y\u2084 = 2^{8a +7} -1 must be prime.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding an a such that for k=1,2,3,4,..., all the corresponding y_n are prime, and then find the largest such k.\n\nSo, since we need to find the largest k possible, it's possible that the maximum k is 3 or 4, or maybe more. Let me try to find a suitable a.\n\nSo, let me start with small primes a, because with larger a, the numbers get too big and likely composite.\n\nLet me try a=2, which is the smallest prime.\n\na=2:\n\nx\u2081=2. y\u2081=2^2 -1=3, which is prime.\n\nx\u2082=2*2 +1=5. y\u2082=2^5 -1=31, which is prime.\n\nx\u2083=2*5 +1=11. y\u2083=2^{"
