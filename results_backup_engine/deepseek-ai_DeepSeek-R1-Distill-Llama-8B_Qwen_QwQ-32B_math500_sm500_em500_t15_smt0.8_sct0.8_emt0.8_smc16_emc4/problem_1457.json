A is north of O, B is west, C is south, and D is east. The balloon is at point H directly above O. The ropes HA, HB, HC, and HD are keeping the balloon in place. \n\nRight now, HC is 150 meters and HD is 130 meters. The problem is saying that instead of using both ropes HC and HD, we could replace them with a single rope HP, where P is somewhere along the straight line between C and D. The goal is to find the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this. So, we need to figure out the shortest possible combined length of HP such that it still holds the balloon in place. The savings would then be the difference between the original total rope length (150 + 130 = 280 meters) and the new length of HP.\n\nAlright, so first, let me visualize this. Points C and D are south and east of O, respectively, or wait, no. Let me think. A is north of O, so that would be along the positive y-axis if O is the origin. B is west, so along the negative x-axis, C is south, so along the negative y-axis, and D is east, along the positive x-axis. So, the points form a square around O, I guess?\n\nBut it's not necessarily a square because the distances from O to each point might not be the same. But in this problem, we aren't told the distances from O to A, B, C, or D. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a square? Because A is north, B is west, C is south, D is east. So, if it's a square, the distance from O to A, O to B, O to C, and O to D would all be the same, say length 's'. But the problem doesn't specify that, so maybe it's not a square. But since the problem mentions the distance between C and D is 140 meters, maybe that can help us figure out their positions.\n\nWait, the distance between C and D is 140 meters. If C is south of O and D is east of O, then the line connecting C and D is a diagonal."

Let me define the coordinates of the points:\n\nLet’s denote the coordinates:\n\n- Let O be (0,0)\n\n- Since A is directly north of O, let's say A is at (0, a) for some a.\n\n- Similarly, B is directly west of O, so B is at (-b, 0) for some b.\n\n- C is directly south of O, so C is at (0, -c) for some c.\n\n- D is directly east of O, so D is at (d, 0) for some d.\n\nNow, the distance between C and D is given as 140 meters. The coordinates of C are (0, -c) and D is (d, 0). So the distance CD is sqrt[(d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2] = sqrt(d² + c²) = 140. So that's equation one: d² + c² = 140².\n\nNow, the balloon is at H, directly above O, so H has coordinates (0, 0, h) in 3D, but since we can model this in terms of 2D with the height as vertical, but the ropes from H to each point must be the hypotenuse of the horizontal distance squared plus the height squared. \n\nWait, but the problem says the ropes are HA, HB, HC, and HD. Since H is directly above O, the horizontal distance from H to any point is the distance from O to that point. For example, the rope HA connects H to A, so the length of HA would be sqrt[(horizontal distance OA)^2 + h²]. Similarly, HB would be sqrt[(distance OB)^2 + h²], HC is sqrt[(distance OC)^2 + h²] = 150 meters, and HD is sqrt[(distance OD)^2 + h²] = 130 meters.\n\nGiven that HC and HD have lengths 150 and 130, respectively, let's write those equations:\n\nFirst, the height h of H above O is the same in all cases, right?

So, we need to find the minimal possible length of HP such that it satisfies the constraints from H to both C and D, but what does that mean?\n\nWait, let's think. When we have a balloon held by ropes HA, HB, HC, HD. If we replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, then the balloon must still be in equilibrium, so HP must be such that it can reach both C and D from H. But P is a point on CD, so H must be connected to P such that the rope HP is long enough to reach both C and D.\n\nWait, no, because it's just one rope now. So the balloon is held above O, so the single rope HP must extend from H down to some point P on CD, such that the rope HP is the same as the previous two ropes HC and HD? Or does it mean that the rope HP is tied to both C and D? Hmm, wait, the problem says: \"replaced by a single rope HP where P is a point on the straight line between C and D.\" So it's replacing both HC and HD with HP, which is a single rope tied at H and looped over to point P on CD.\n\nSo, the single rope HP must connect H to P, and P is somewhere along CD.\n\nBut how does this replace HC and HD? Originally, there were four ropes: HA, HB, HC, HD. Now, we are replacing HC and HD with HP, so there are now three ropes: HA, HB, HP. But the problem says H is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, HD. So replacing HC and HD with HP would mean that now H is connected with HA, HB, and HP. So HP must connect H to some point P on CD such that the lengths from H to C and H to D via HP are the same as before?\n\nWait, maybe not. The total length that is being replaced is HC + HD"

So the problem is to find the minimal possible length of HP where P is on CD, so that the balloon remains in place. But how does the position of P affect the ability of the balloon to stay in place?\n\nWait, perhaps the balloon is held in place by the tension in the ropes. If we remove HC and HD and replace them with HP, then the point P must be such that the rope HP can provide the necessary tension to keep H in place. But maybe the problem is just a geometric one where the rope HP must reach from H to P, and since P is on CD, the minimal HP is the shortest distance from H to CD? Wait, but H is above O, so the shortest distance from H to the line CD would be the perpendicular distance from H to CD. But is that the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler: since we are just replacing the two ropes with a single rope, the minimal length of HP would be the straight line from H to P, where P is chosen on CD such that the total rope length is minimized. Since we want to minimize HP, the minimal HP is the shortest distance from H to the line CD. Because the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. So, if we can choose P as the foot of the perpendicular from H to CD, then HP would be the shortest possible, and that would give the maximum saving.\n\nBut let me confirm if that's the case here. Since the balloon is fixed at H, and the rope HP must be anchored at some point P on CD. The minimal length of HP is indeed the perpendicular distance from H to CD. Therefore, the maximum saving would be (HC + HD) - HP_perpendicular.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to calculating the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD, then subtracting that from 280 to get the saving.\n\nBut let me verify this reasoning. Let me think again.\n\nThe original ropes HC and HD are two ropes from H to C and H to D. The total length is 150 + 130 = 280. If we replace them with a single rope HP, where P is on CD, then the length of HP"

The HP is just a single rope that goes from H to P on CD, so that would mean the rope is connected to both H and P, but not necessarily to C and D. So, how does that affect the positions?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the single rope HP is just providing the same support as both HC and HD together. But in reality, the balloon is in equilibrium with four ropes pulling at four points, so when replacing two ropes with one, the single rope must be able to reach both C and D. So, perhaps the minimal HP is the minimal length that connects H to some point P such that the distance from P to both C and D is equal to the original HC and HD?\n\nWait, that might not make much sense. Let me consider forces, perhaps. The problem is about the geometry, though.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the single rope HP must satisfy that the point P is such that the distances from H to C and H to D via HP are the same as the original rope lengths. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. The original setup has the balloon being pulled by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, HD. The balloon is at H, and O is at the origin. If we replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, which is tied to a point P on CD, then the balloon must still be in equilibrium. So, in terms of forces, the sum of the forces from HA, HB, HC, and HD must equal zero. After replacing HC and HD with HP, the forces from HA, HB, and HP must still sum to zero. So, HP must provide the necessary force in the direction from H towards CD.\n\nSo, perhaps HP must be able to pull the balloon with the required forces at point P. But in terms of geometry, perhaps it's equivalent to the original two forces HC and HD. Hmm, but this is getting into forces, which might be beyond the problem's requirement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just a question of minimal length of HP such that it's a superset of the original connections. That is, since HC is 150 and HD is 130, the minimal HP should be able to reach C and D. So, the minimal HP is the minimal rope that can reach both"

So, the rope HP must be able to hold the balloon, but since P is on CD, the point P can be anywhere along CD. The minimal length of HP would be the shortest distance from H to CD, so that's the perpendicular distance. Therefore, the maximum saving is 280 minus that perpendicular distance.\n\nTherefore, I think the key is to compute the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD, then compute 280 minus that distance, which would be the maximum saving.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that approach.\n\nFirst, let's find coordinates of points C and D. Earlier, we found that:\n\nCoordinates of C: (0, -c) = (0, -sqrt(12800)) = (0, -80√2)\n\nCoordinates of D: (d, 0) = (sqrt(6800), 0) = (20√17, 0)\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nWait, c squared was 12800, so c = sqrt(12800). Let me compute sqrt(12800):\n\nsqrt(12800) = sqrt(128 * 100) = sqrt(128)*10 = sqrt(64*2)*10 = 8*sqrt(2)*10 = 80√2. Yes, so c = 80√2.\n\nSimilarly, d squared was 6800, so d = sqrt(6800) = sqrt(100*68) = 10*sqrt(68). sqrt(68) can be simplified as sqrt(4*17) = 2*sqrt(17), so d = 10*2*sqrt(17) = 20√17.

So, HP is exactly 120 meters.\n\nThus, the minimal HP is 120 meters, so the maximum rope saved is 280 - 120 = 160 meters.\n\nTherefore, the greatest length of rope that can be saved is 160 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest length of rope that can be saved is \\boxed{160} meters.\n</think>\n\nGiven five points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), \\( D \\), and \\( O \\) on a flat field, where \\( A \\) is north of \\( O \\), \\( B \\) is west of \\( O \\), \\( C \\) is south of \\( O \\), and \\( D \\) is east of \\( O \\).
