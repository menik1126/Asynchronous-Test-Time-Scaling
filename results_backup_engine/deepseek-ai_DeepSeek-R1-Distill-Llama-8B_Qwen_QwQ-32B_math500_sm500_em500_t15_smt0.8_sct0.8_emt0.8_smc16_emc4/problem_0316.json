            "output": "Okay, I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\) and then sum them up as \\( a + b + c \\). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I should factor the denominator to find those values.\n\nThe denominator is \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\). Let me try factoring this quadratic. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, thinking... 2 and -7: 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect! So, the denominator factors into \\( (x + 2)(x - 7) \\).\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). So, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\). \n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I remember that the rules for horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe numerator is a linear term, degree 1, and the denominator is a quadratic, degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nThe leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1 (from \\( x^2 \\)). So, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\). Therefore, \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nNow, I just need to add these together: \\( a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 2 \\). Let me compute that: -2 +7 is 5, and 5 +2 is 7. So, the sum is 7.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Factoring the denominator: yes, (x+2)(x-7) is correct. For horizontal asymptote, since degree 2 > degree 1, it's indeed the ratio of leading coefficients, which is 2/1=2."

            "output": " Wait, actually, hold on. Wait, when the degree of the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote is y=0, right? Wait, did I make a mistake here?\n\nOh no! I think I messed up the horizontal asymptote part. Let me recall the rules again. \n\nHorizontal asymptote rules:\n\n- If degree of numerator < degree of denominator: horizontal asymptote at y=0.\n\n- If degree of numerator = degree of denominator: horizontal asymptote at ratio of leading coefficients.\n\n- If degree of numerator > degree of denominator: no horizontal asymptote (but maybe an oblique/slant asymptote).\n\nIn this case, numerator degree is 1, denominator is 2. So since numerator degree is less than denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So, my mistake earlier was incorrect. Therefore, c should be 0, not 2. \n\nOh man, that was a critical error. Let me correct that. So, c is 0. \n\nTherefore, the sum is a + b + c = (-2) +7 +0 = 5. \n\nWait, so I need to make sure. Let me confirm again. \n\nThe function is 2x over x² -5x -14. As x approaches infinity, the denominator grows much faster than the numerator. So, the function approaches 0. Therefore, horizontal asymptote is y=0. So yes, c is 0. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be -2 +7 +0 =5. \n\nHmm, so I need to be careful with horizontal asymptote rules. Glad I caught that mistake. \n\nSo, final answer is 5. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), we factor the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7)\n\\]\n\nThe vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, which are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). Thus, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\nNext, we determine the horizontal asymptote. The degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2). According to the rules for"
