Since 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, I can determine how many Blinkets are equivalent to one Drinket and then multiply that by 56.\n\nNext, I'll convert the Blinkets to Trinkets using the provided conversion rate of 4 Trinkets equal to 1 Blinket. After finding the total number of Blinkets, I'll divide by 4 to find the equivalent number of Trinkets.\n\nFinally, by following these steps, I can accurately determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conversion Rates:**\n   - **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**\n   - **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**\n\n2. **Convert Drinkets to Blinkets:**\n   - We need to find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to 1 Drinket.\n   - \\( 3 \\) Blinkets \\( = 7 \\) Drinkets\n   - \\( 1 \\) Drinket \\( = \\frac{3}{7} \\) Blinkets\n\n3. **Multiply by 56 to Find Total Blinkets:**\n   - \\( 56 \\) Drinkets \\( \\times \\frac{3}{7} \\) Blinkets/Drinket \\( = 24 \\) Blinkets\n\n4. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:**\n   - \\( 1 \\) Blinket \\( = \\frac{1}{4} \\) Trinket\n   - \\( 24 \\) Blinkets \\( \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\) Trinkets/Blinket \\( = 6 \\) Trinkets\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{6}"
