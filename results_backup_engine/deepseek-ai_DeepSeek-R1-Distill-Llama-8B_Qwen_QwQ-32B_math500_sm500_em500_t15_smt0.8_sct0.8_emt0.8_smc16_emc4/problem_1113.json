The problem states that \\( y \\) varies inversely as the square root of \\( x \\), which can be written mathematically as \\( y = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}} \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\nNext, I substitute the given values \\( x = 24 \\) and \\( y = 15 \\) into the equation to find the constant \\( k \\). This gives me \\( 15 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{24}} \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), I first calculate the square root of 24, which is approximately 4.899. Then, I multiply both sides of the equation by 4.899 to find that \\( k = 15 \\times 4.899 \\approx 73.485 \\).\n\nNow that I have the constant \\( k \\), I can rewrite the inverse variation equation as \\( y = \\frac{73.485}{\\sqrt{x}} \\). \n\nThe next step is to find the value of \\( x \\) when \\( y = 3 \\). I substitute \\( y = 3 \\) into the equation, giving me \\( 3 = \\frac{73.485}{\\sqrt{x}} \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), I multiply both sides by \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), resulting in \\( 3\\sqrt{x} = 73.485 \\). Then, I divide both sides by 3, so \\( \\sqrt{x} = \\frac{73.485}{3} \\approx 24.495 \\).\n\nFinally, I square both sides to solve for \\( x \\), which gives me \\( x = (24.495)^2 \\approx 595.1 \\).\n\nTherefore, when \\( y = 3 \\), the value of \\( x \\) is approximately 595.1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Relationship**\n\nThe problem states that \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\).
