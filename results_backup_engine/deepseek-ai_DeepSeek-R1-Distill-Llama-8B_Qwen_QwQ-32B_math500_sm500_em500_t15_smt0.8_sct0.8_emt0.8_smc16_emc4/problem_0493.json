            "output": "To determine the volume of the original cube, I need to establish its side length.\n\nThe steel sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is twice that, which is 6 inches. Since the sphere is inscribed within the cube, the cube's side length must be equal to the sphere's diameter. Therefore, the cube's side length is 6 inches.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the cube using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is side length raised to the power of three. Plugging in the side length of 6 inches, the volume is 6³ = 216 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, I'll verify that this side length correctly accommodates the sphere within the cube. The sphere touches the cube exactly at the centers of each face, confirming that 6 inches is indeed the appropriate side length.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the relationship between the sphere and the cube.**\n   - The sphere is inscribed in the cube.\n   - When a sphere is inscribed in a cube, the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's side length.\n\n2. **Calculate the diameter of the sphere.**\n   - The radius of the sphere is 3 inches.\n   - Diameter = 2 × radius = 2 × 3 = 6 inches.\n\n3. **Determine the side length of the cube.**\n   - Since the sphere is inscribed in the cube, the cube's side length is equal to the sphere's diameter.\n   - Therefore, the side length of the cube is 6 inches.\n\n4. **Calculate the volume of the cube.**\n   - The formula for the volume of a cube is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume} = \\text{side length}^3\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the side length:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Volume} = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{216}"
