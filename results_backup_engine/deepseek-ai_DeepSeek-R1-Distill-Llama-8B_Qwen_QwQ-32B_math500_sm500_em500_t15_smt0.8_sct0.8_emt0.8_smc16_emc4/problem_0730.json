Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because logarithms can be tricky, but I think I can handle this by carefully applying the logarithm properties.\n\nFirst, let me look at the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\). I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So, using the property \\(\\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (a \\times c)\\), I can rewrite the left side.\n\nLet me apply that:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = \\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\n\nI also recall that \\(\\log_b z = w\\) is equivalent to \\(z = b^w\\). So, applying that here, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x - y)(x + y) = 6^2\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(x - y)(x + y) = 36\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay, that's a difference of squares. So, \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\). I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\). Again, I can use the definition of logarithms to rewrite this. Remember that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) is the same as \\(b^c = a\\). So, applying that here, I have:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = 5x\n\\]\n\nThat's a nice equation. So, \\(y^2 = 5x\\). I'll note that down.\n\nSo far, I have two equations:\n\n1. \\(x^2 - y^2 = "

Let me substitute equation 2 into equation 1.\n\nSo replacing \\(y^2\\) in equation 1 with \\(5x\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x = 36\n\\]\n\nThat's a quadratic equation in terms of \\(x\\). Let me rearrange it:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\n\\]\n\nI need to solve for \\(x\\). Let's try factoring. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add to -5. Hmm, let me think: 4 and -9. Because 4 * (-9) = -36 and 4 + (-9) = -5. So, yes, that works.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as:\n\n\\[\n(x + 4)(x - 9) = 0\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the possible solutions:\n\n1. \\(x + 4 = 0\\) → \\(x = -4\\)\n2. \\(x - 9 = 0\\) → \\(x = 9\\)\n\nNow, I need to check these solutions to make sure they make sense in the original equations. Let's start with \\(x = -4\\).\n\nIf \\(x = -4\\), then from equation 2, \\(y^2 = 5x = 5*(-4) = -20\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(y^2\\) is a square of a real number, which can't be negative. So \\(y^2 = -20\\) isn't possible. Therefore, \\(x = -4\\) is not a valid solution.\n\nNow, check \\(x = 9\\). Plugging into equation 2: \\(y^2 = 5*9 = 45\\). So, \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\). But since \\(y\\) is inside logarithms in the first equation, it must be positive because logarithms of negative numbers are undefined. So, \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\), which is approximately 6.708, but we can write it as \\(3\\sqrt{5}\\) for exactness.\n\nSo, \\("

Since \\(\\sqrt{45}\\) is about 6.708, \\(9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292\\), which is positive.\n\nSimilarly, \\(x + y = 9 + \\sqrt{45}\\) is definitely positive.\n\nSo, let's compute \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y)\\). Since we know that \\(\\log_6 (a) + \\log_6 (b) = \\log_6 (ab)\\), let's compute \\(ab = (9 - \\sqrt{45})(9 + \\sqrt{45}) = 9^2 - (\\sqrt{45})^2 = 81 - 45 = 36\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\log_6 (36) = 2\\), because \\(6^2 = 36\\).

That's exactly what the second equation states, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, \\(x = 9\\) is the valid solution.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me recap all the steps and ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Combined the two logs into one using logarithm properties: correct.\n2. Converted the log equation into an exponent form: correct.\n3. Substituted into the second equation: correct.\n4. Solved the quadratic equation and checked for extraneous solutions: correct.\n5.
