            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, the perimeter is 6 times the side length. That means the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, since the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, the perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm. A regular octagon has 8 sides, so each side of the octagon is the total perimeter divided by the number of sides.\n\nTo find the length of each side of the octagon, I divide the total perimeter by 8. Therefore, 96 cm divided by 8 equals 12 cm. This calculation shows that each side of the regular octagon is 12 centimeters long.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nA regular octagon has the same perimeter as the regular hexagon shown here with side length 16 cm. How long is each side of the octagon?\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   - A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.\n   - Given that each side is 16 cm, the perimeter \\( P_{\\text{hexagon}} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16 \\, \\text{cm} = 96 \\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the perimeter of the regular octagon.**\n   - Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{octagon}} = P_{\\text{hexagon}} = 96 \\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the length of each side of the regular octagon.**\n   - A regular octagon has 8 equal sides.\n   - Let \\( s \\) be the length of each side of the octagon.\n   - The perimeter \\( P_{\\text{octagon}} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{octagon}} = 8 \\times s\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the known perimeter:\n     \\[\n     96 \\, \\text{cm} = 8 \\times s\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{96 \\, \\text"
