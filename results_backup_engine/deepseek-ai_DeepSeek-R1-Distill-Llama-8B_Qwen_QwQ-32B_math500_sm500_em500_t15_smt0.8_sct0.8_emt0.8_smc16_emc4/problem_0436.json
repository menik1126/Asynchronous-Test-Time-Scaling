Since the sequence starts at 1 and each term increases by 2, the number of terms \\( n \\) can be calculated using the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \\times d\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a_1 = 1 \\), \\( d = 2 \\), and \\( a_n = 199 \\). Plugging in these values:\n\n\\[\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\n198 = 2(n - 1)\n\\]\n\\[\n99 = n - 1\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 100 terms in this sequence.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers. There's a well-known formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = n^2\n\\]\n\nApplying this formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 100^2 = 10,000\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the modulo 7 remainder of this sum, I'll compute \\( 10,000 \\mod 7 \\). Calculating this:\n\n\\[\n10,000 \\div 7 = 1,428 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the modulo 7 remainder is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo 7 remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence and Number of Terms:**\n   \n   The given sequence is the sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 up to 199. The \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence with first term \\(a_1 = 1\\) and common difference \\(d = 2\\) can be expressed as:\n   \n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \n   \\[\n   "
