First, I'll try to understand the function f(i, j) as described.\n\nThe function f is defined recursively, which means it's built using smaller instances of itself. The domain of f is {0,1,2,...} for the first argument (i) and {0,1,2,3,4} for the second argument (j). The codomain is also {0,1,2,3,4}, so all outputs should be remainders modulo 5.\n\nLooking at the definition:\n\n1. If i = 0 and j is between 0 and 4, f(0, j) = mod_5(j + 1). So, for i=0, it's just adding 1 to j and taking the modulus. That seems straightforward.\n\n2. If i >= 1 and j = 0, f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1). So, when j is 0, you decrease i by 1 and set j to 1, then compute f recursively.\n\n3. If i >= 1 and j between 1 and 4, f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). Hmm, this seems more complicated. It's a double recursion because f(i, j) depends on f(i, j - 1), which itself might depend on f(i - 1, ...). This could get tricky.\n\nThe question asks for f(2015, 2). That's a pretty large i value, so I don't think we can compute it directly. Maybe there's a pattern or a cycle that repeats after some steps. Let me try to compute some small values to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n- f(0,0) = mod_5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0,1) = mod_5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0,2) = mod_5(2 + 1) = 3\n- f(0,3) = mod_5(3 + 1) = 4\n- f(0,4) ="
