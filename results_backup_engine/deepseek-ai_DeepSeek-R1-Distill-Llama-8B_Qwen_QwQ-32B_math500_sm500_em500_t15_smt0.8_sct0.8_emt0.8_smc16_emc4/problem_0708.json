            "output": "Okay, so I need to find how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has. Hmm, let me think about what a y-intercept is. I remember that the y-intercepts of a graph are the points where the graph crosses the y-axis. At these points, the value of x is zero because the y-axis is where x equals zero. So, to find the y-intercepts, I should set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for y.\n\nAlright, let me write down the equation again and substitute \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\)\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of y. Quadratic equations are usually in the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\). Comparing my equation to that form, I can see that:\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\) (the coefficient of \\( y^2 \\))\n- \\( b = -4 \\) (the coefficient of y)\n- \\( c = -1 \\) (the constant term)\n\nI need to solve for y, so I can use the quadratic formula, which is \\( y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). Let me plug in the values of a, b, and c into this formula.\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant, which is the part under the square root: \\( b^2 - 4ac \\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\( (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\)\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check:\n\n\\( (-4)^2 = 16 \\)\n\n\\( 4ac = 4 * 1 * (-1) = -4 \\)\n\nSo, \\( b^2 - 4ac = 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\). Yeah, that's correct. So the discriminant is 20.\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (20 > 0), there are two real solutions. That means there are two y-intercepts. Each of these solutions will give me the y-value where the parabola crosses the y-axis.\n\nSo, plugging the discrimin"

Since \\( 20 = 4 * 5 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{4} = 2 \\), so:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5} \\)\n\nSubstituting back in:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\)\n\nNow, I can factor out a 2 from both terms in the numerator:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{2(2 \\pm \\sqrt{5})}{2} \\)\n\nThe 2's cancel out:\n\n\\( y = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{5} \\)\n\nSo, the two y-intercepts are at \\( y = 2 + \\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( y = 2 - \\sqrt{5} \\).\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let's recheck the discriminant:\n\n\\( b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nThen, applying the quadratic formula:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} \\), which simplifies to \\( y = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{5} \\). That looks right.\n\nTherefore, there are two y-intercepts for this parabola. So, the answer should be 2.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of y-intercepts of the parabola \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), we set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\\[ 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\) with \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).
