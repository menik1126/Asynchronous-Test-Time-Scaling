To do this, I'll divide the binary number into groups of three digits starting from the right.\n\nThe binary number is 10101001110. Counting from the right, I have the following groups: 110, 101, 010, and 101.\n\nNext, I'll convert each of these binary triplets into their decimal equivalents. Starting with 110, that's 6 in decimal. Then, 101 is 5, followed by 010, which is 2, and finally another 101, which is also 5.\n\nOnce I have all the decimal equivalents of the base-eight digits, I'll list them together to form the final base-eight number. So, the base-eight number is 1255.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number `10101001110` to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide the binary number into groups of three digits starting from the right.**\n   \n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n   \n   **Note:** If the total number of digits isn't divisible by three, pad the leftmost group with leading zeros.\n\n2. **Convert each three-digit binary group to its decimal equivalent.**\n   \n   - **110**:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0 = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6\n     \\]\n     \n   - **101**:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5\n     \\]\n     \n   - **010**:\n     \\[\n     0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0 = 0 + 2 + 0 = 2\n     \\]\n     \n   - **101**:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Combine the decimal equivalents to form the base-eight number.**\n   \n   ```\n  "
