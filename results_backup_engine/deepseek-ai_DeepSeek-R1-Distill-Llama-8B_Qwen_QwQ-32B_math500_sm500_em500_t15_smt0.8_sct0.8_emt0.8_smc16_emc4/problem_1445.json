I'm a bit nervous about these exponential equations because they can get tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that 3^{2x} can be rewritten. Since 2x is the exponent, that's the same as (3^x)^2, right? So, maybe I can let y equal 3^x. If I do that, then 3^{2x} becomes y squared. So, the equation becomes y² + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, but I still have two variables here: y and x. That doesn't seem helpful yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can also express 10^x in terms of y. Since 10^x is just another exponential term, perhaps I can relate it to y somehow. But I know that 10^x can't be directly expressed as a power of 3, so that might not work. Maybe I need a different substitution.\n\nAlternatively, I can try taking logarithms on both sides, but I need the equation in a form where I can apply them. Let me see, maybe I can rearrange the equation first. Let's move the 10^x to the left side: 3^{2x} - 10^x + 19 = 0. Hmm, but that still doesn't look manageable.\n\nI remember that sometimes when you have two exponential terms with different bases, you can take logarithms after making substitutions. Maybe I'll try that. Let me let a = 3^x and b = 10^x. Then the equation becomes a² + 19 = b. But I'm still stuck because I have two variables here.\n\nWait, maybe I can express b in terms of a. Since 10^x is equal to (10/3)^x * 3^x, right? Because 10^x = 10^x and 3^x is 3^x, so 10^x = (10/3)^x * 3^x. So, if I let (10/3)^x = k, then 10^x = k * 3^x = k * a. So now, my equation becomes a² + 19 = k * a.\n\n"

For x in the negatives, f(x)=3^{2x} +19 is always around 19 plus a small term, while g(x)=10^x approaches 0.

Wait, but then why at x=2, they are equal?\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 3^{2x} is 9^x. So, 9^x vs 10^x. So, 9^x is less than 10^x for all x>0 except when x=0, where they are 1 and 1.

So, the addition of 19 makes the left side catch up to the right side at x=2.\n\nAh, so without the 19, 9^x would always be less than 10^x for x>0.
