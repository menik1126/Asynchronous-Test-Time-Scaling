This can be calculated using the combination formula.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 4 available using the combination formula as well.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to form the group, I'll multiply the number of combinations of boys by the number of combinations of girls.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation, we'll use the combination formula. Combinations are used here because the order of selection does not matter.\n\n1. **Number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total number of ways to form the group:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = \\binom{7}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
