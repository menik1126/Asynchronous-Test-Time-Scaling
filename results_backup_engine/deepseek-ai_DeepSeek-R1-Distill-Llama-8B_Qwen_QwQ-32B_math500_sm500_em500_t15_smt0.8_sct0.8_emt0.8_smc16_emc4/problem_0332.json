Since the order doesn't matter, I'll use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nCalculating the combinations for the boys: C(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!) = 35.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 4 available. Using the same combination formula: C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!2!) = 6.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to choose both the boys and the girls, I'll multiply the two results together: 35 * 6 = 210.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation, we'll use the concept of **combinations**. The order of selection does not matter, so we'll use the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to find the total number of ways to choose the group.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = C(7, 3) \\times C(4, 2) = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
