            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. The problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), it leaves a remainder \\( R(x) \\). And when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), it leaves a remainder \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, I know that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and I need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nAlright, let me break this down. Since \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, it can be written as:\n\\[\nP(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c) + \\text{something}\n\\]\nBut since it's monic, the leading coefficients of the cubic and the remainder should both be 1. Wait, actually, when you divide a polynomial by a quadratic, the remainder is linear or constant, so \\( R(x) \\) must be a linear polynomial, right? So \\( R(x) = mx + n \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), which is also quadratic, the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\), so that would also be a linear polynomial. So both remainders are linear.\n\nHmm, so if I let \\( R(x) = ax + b \\), then the remainders are \\( R(x) \\) and \\( 2R(x) \\). So:\n\\[\nP(x) = Q_1(x)(x - 1)(x - 4) + ax + b\n\\]\nwhen divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), and\n\\[\nP(x) = Q_2(x)(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2(ax + b)\n\\]\nwhen divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\).\n\nSince \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic, both \\( Q_1(x) \\) and \\( Q_2(x) \\) must be linear polynomials because the divisor is quadratic, and the degree of \\( P(x) \\) is 3.\n\nSo, \\( Q"

Which means that my second approach has an error.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I found P(5)=15, and the polynomial was P(x)=x^3 - (5/2)x^2 - (21/2)x +5. Let me check if this polynomial satisfies the conditions.\n\nFirst, check P(0)=5: yes, the constant term is 5.\n\nCheck P(1):\n\n1 -5/2 -21/2 +5 = (1 +5) + (-5/2 -21/2)=6 -26/2=6-13= -7.\n\nAccording to remainder R(x)=ax +b, where in first approach, R(x)=ax +b, with a=-2, b=-5. So R(1)= -2*1 -5= -7, which matches P(1)= -7.\n\nSimilarly, R(4)= -2*4 -5= -13. P(4)=4^3 - (5/2)(16) - (21/2)(4) +5=64 -40 -42 +5= (64+5)=69 - (40+42)=82 → 69-82= -13.

Perhaps because in the first approach, the polynomial is expressed as (x +5/2)(x^2 -5x +4) -2x -5, which is constructed from the remainders, but in the second approach, P(x) is arbitrary with x^3 term, but monic, so I have to include all that.\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach isn't the best way, because P(x) is expressed via remainders, so perhaps it's better to use the first approach.\n\nBut given that, in the first approach, I found P(5)=15, and all the values check out, perhaps the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method.\n\nWait, another thought: since P(x) is a monic cubic, then P(x) can be expressed as:\n\nP(x) = (x - k)(x - m)(x - n) + ax + b\n\nBut I don't think that's necessarily helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since P(x) leaves a remainder R(x) when divided by (x -1)(x -4), we can write P(x) = Q(x)(x -1)(x -4) + R(x), where Q(x) is linear, and R(x) is linear.\n\nSimilarly, P(x) = S(x)(x -2)(x -3) + 2R(x), where S(x) is linear.\n\nSo, if I denote:\n\nP(x) = (x -1)(x -4)Q(x) + R(x),\n\nand P(x) = (x -2)(x -3)S(x) + 2R(x),\n\nthen subtracting these gives:\n\n(x -1)(x -4)Q(x) - (x -2)(x -3)S(x) = R(x) - 2R(x) = -R(x)\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, if I take"
