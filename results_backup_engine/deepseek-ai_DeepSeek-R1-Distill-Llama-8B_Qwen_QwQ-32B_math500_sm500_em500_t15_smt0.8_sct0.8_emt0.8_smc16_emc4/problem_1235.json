            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. Let me write it down again to make sure I got it right: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, cool. So I need to find all the values of x that make this equation true.\n\nFirst off, since there's a square root in there, I remember that the expression inside the square root has to be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, I should probably start by figuring out the domain of this equation. That means finding the values of x for which 11 - 2x is greater than or equal to zero.\n\nLet me write that down: 11 - 2x ≥ 0. To solve for x, I can add 2x to both sides, right? That gives me 11 ≥ 2x. Then, dividing both sides by 2, I get 11/2 ≥ x. So, x is less than or equal to 5.5. That makes sense because if x is more than 5.5, then 11 - 2x would be negative, and the square root wouldn't be a real number. So, x has to be ≤ 5.5. Got it. That's the domain.\n\nNow, onto solving the equation itself. I have x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. I think the usual strategy here is to isolate the square root term and then square both sides to eliminate it. Let me try that.\n\nSo, first, I want to get rid of the 4 on the right side. To do that, I can subtract 4 from both sides. Let's see: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x). Yeah, that seems right. Now, I have x minus 4 equals the square root of (11 - 2x). \n\nThe next step is to get rid of the square root, so I'll square both sides of the equation. Squaring the left side gives (x - 4)^2, and squaring the right side gives (√(11 - 2x))^2, which simplifies to just 11 - 2x. So, now"

            "output": " my equation is:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nAlright, expanding the left side. Let me make sure I do that correctly. (x - 4)^2 is x squared minus 8x plus 16. So, the equation becomes:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nNow, I need to bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Let's subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides. So, subtracting 11 from both sides gives:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 - 11 = -2x\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx² - 8x + 5 = -2x\n\nThen, adding 2x to both sides:\n\nx² - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nHmm, okay. Now I have a quadratic equation: x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. To solve this, I can try factoring it. Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, if I take -1 and -5, their product is 5 (because negative times negative is positive), and their sum is -6. Perfect! So, the equation factors to:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives me the potential solutions:\n\nx - 1 = 0 ⇒ x = 1\n\nx - 5 = 0 ⇒ x = 5\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. But wait, I need to make sure these solutions actually work in the original equation because sometimes when we square both sides of an equation, we can introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nLet me check x = 1 first. Plugging it into the original equation:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nLeft side: x = 1\n\nRight side: √(11 - 2*1) + 4 = √(11 - 2) + 4 = √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, 1 ≠ 7. Hmm, that doesn't work. So, x = 1 is an extraneous solution and should be discarded.\n\nNow"

So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nWait a minute, I got only one solution here, x = 5. But let me think again. Why did x = 1 not work? Maybe I made a mistake in squaring the equation or in the factoring.\n\nLet me go back through my steps. So, original equation: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. Subtracted 4: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x). Squared both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x. Expanded: x² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x. Then, brought all terms to left: x² - 6x + 5 = 0. Factored: (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0. So, solutions x = 1 and x = 5.\n\nPlugging x = 1 in, I get √(11 - 2) + 4 = √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7. So, 1 ≠ 7, which is a problem. So, x = 1 is not a solution.\n\nPlugging x = 5, as above, works. So, seems like only x = 5 is valid.\n\nWait, but I should also consider if there are any other possible solutions. For example, sometimes when squaring both sides, you might not get all solutions because of the domain restrictions.\n\nLet me think. The domain was x ≤ 5.5, which is satisfied by both x = 1 and x = 5. So, both are within the domain. But x = 1 isn't a solution, so I have to be careful.\n\nIs there any other way this could be solved? Maybe I could try a graphical approach, plotting both sides of the equation and seeing where they intersect.\n\nLet me denote the left side as y = x and the right side as y = √(11 - 2x) + 4. So,"

The square root part, √(11 - 2x), is a square root that's decreasing because of the negative coefficient on x inside the root. Then adding 4 shifts it up by 4 units.\n\nThe square root function will have a domain of x ≤ 5.5, as before. The maximum value of the square root part is when x is at its minimum. Wait, actually, when x is as small as possible, the term inside the square root becomes larger. Wait, actually, when x approaches negative infinity, but since the domain is x ≤ 5.5, but x can technically go to negative infinity? Wait, no, actually, the expression inside the square root is 11 - 2x. So, if x is very negative, 11 - 2x becomes very large positive, so the square root would be large. But the right-hand side is √(11 - 2x) + 4, so as x approaches negative infinity, the right-hand side approaches infinity. The left side, y = x, also approaches negative infinity. Hmm, so maybe they cross somewhere?\n\nWait, but in our solutions, we only found x =5. Let me see. Let me try plugging in x = 0. Then, the right side would be √(11 - 0) +4 ≈ sqrt(11) +4 ≈ 3.316 +4 ≈7.316, which is way bigger than 0. So, the right side is higher than the left side at x=0. At x=5, they are equal. At x=5.5, the right side would be sqrt(11 - 11) +4 = 0 +4 =4, and the left side is 5.5, so left side is higher. So, between x=5 and x=5.5, the left side is above the right side. \n\nWhat about when x is less than 5? Let's try x=3. Right side: sqrt(11 -6) +4 = sqrt(5)+4 ≈2.236+4≈6.236. Left side is 3, so"

So, in all these cases, the right side is higher than left side.\n\nWait, that suggests that the two graphs only intersect at x=5? Because at x=5, both are equal. For x less than 5, the right side is higher, and for x greater than 5 but less than 5.5, the left side is higher. So, only one point of intersection at x=5.\n\nBut wait, when I squared the equation, I had quadratic which gave me two roots, but only one was valid. So, that's why I only got x=5. So, in the original equation, the two functions only intersect once, meaning only one solution. So, that makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if the equation could have another solution. Let's suppose there is another value of x where the two sides meet. So, maybe let me try to graph both functions mentally.\n\nThe left side is a straight line, y = x, with a slope of 1. The right side is a square root function, y = √(11 - 2x) +4. Since the square root function is decreasing and the straight line is increasing, they can meet at most once. Therefore, only one solution exists. Hence, x=5 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to solve it in another way, just to confirm.\n\nLet me start again with the equation: x = √(11 - 2x) +4.\n\nI can try substituting x = 5, which works. Let me try another value near 5, like x =4.9.\n\nThen, right side: sqrt(11 - 2*4.9) +4 = sqrt(11 -9.8) +4 = sqrt(1.2) +4 ≈1.095 +4≈5.095. Left side:4.9. So, 5.095 vs 4.9.

But since the original equation requires x to be equal to the right side, which is only at x=5.\n\nHmm, so that's consistent. So, only x=5 is the solution.\n\nWait, but why did the quadratic give me x=1 as a solution? Let me see. When I squared both sides, I might have introduced an extraneous solution. Let me see:\n\nOriginal equation after subtracting 4: x -4 = sqrt(11 -2x). \n\nWhen I square both sides, I get (x-4)^2 = 11 -2x. \n\nBut squaring can sometimes create solutions that don't satisfy the original equation because the square of a negative number is positive. \n\nSo, in the original equation, the right side sqrt(11 -2x) is always non-negative, so the left side x -4 must also be non-negative. Because sqrt(11 -2x) is non-negative, so x -4 must be equal to a non-negative number, so x -4 ≥0 ⇒ x ≥4. \n\nAh! That's an important point. So, in addition to the domain of x ≤5.5, we also have that x must be ≥4. Because the right side sqrt(...) is non-negative, so x -4 must be ≥0. Therefore, x must be ≥4. \n\nTherefore, the domain is actually 4 ≤x ≤5.5. \n\nSo, when I found x=1, which is less than 4, it's not in the domain of the equation after we subtracted 4. So, that's why it's extraneous. \n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x=5, which is between 4 and 5.5. \n\nSo, that's why x=1 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the answer is x=5. \n\nI think that's thorough. Let me just recap:\n\nOriginal equation: x = sqrt(11 -2x) +4.\n\nFirst, domain: 11-2x ≥0 ⇒x ≤5.5. \n\nThen, rearranged to x -4 = sqrt(11 -2"
