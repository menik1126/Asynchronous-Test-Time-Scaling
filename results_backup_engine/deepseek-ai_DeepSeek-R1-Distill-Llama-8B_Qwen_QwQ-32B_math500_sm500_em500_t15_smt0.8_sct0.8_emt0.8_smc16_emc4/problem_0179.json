            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a complex number z = 1 + i, and another complex number w defined as (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). I need to find the absolute value of w, which is denoted as |w|. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a complex number, the absolute value or modulus is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts. So, if I have a complex number, say a + bi, then |a + bi| = sqrt(a² + b²). That part I remember pretty clearly.\n\nSo, in this problem, I need to find |w|, which is the modulus of the complex number w. Since w is given as a fraction involving z, my first thought is that I should probably substitute z into the expression for w and simplify it before I can find its modulus.\n\nLet me write down what w is: w = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). So, to compute this, I can substitute z = 1 + i into both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nFirst, let's compute 3z + 1. Substituting z gives 3*(1 + i) + 1. Let me calculate that: 3*1 is 3, and 3*i is 3i. So, 3*(1 + i) is 3 + 3i. Then, adding 1 gives 3 + 3i + 1, which simplifies to 4 + 3i.\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. Now, the denominator is 5z + 7. Substituting z again, that's 5*(1 + i) + 7. Let's compute that: 5*1 is 5, and 5*i is 5i. So, 5*(1 + i) is 5 + 5i. Adding 7 gives 5 + 5i + 7, which simplifies to 12 + 5i.\n\nSo now, w becomes (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). Now, to find the absolute value of w, I need |w| = |(4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i)|. I remember that for two complex numbers, the modulus"

            "output": " of their quotient is the quotient of their moduli, so |w| = |4 + 3i| / |12 + 5i|. That seems like a useful property to use here, because otherwise, I might have to go through the trouble of rationalizing the denominator or something like that.\n\nLet me verify that property. So, if w = z1/z2, then |w| = |z1| / |z2|. Yes, that's correct. Because the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli. So, that's going to save me some steps instead of having to compute w as a single complex number and then taking its modulus.\n\nSo, let's compute |4 + 3i| first. The modulus is sqrt(4² + 3²) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, |12 + 5i| is sqrt(12² + 5²) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13. So, that's 13.\n\nTherefore, |w| = |4 + 3i| / |12 + 5i| = 5 / 13.\n\nWait, that seems pretty simple. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, maybe I should double-check the calculations.\n\nLet me go back through each step. Starting with 3z + 1: z = 1 + i, so 3*(1 + i) is 3 + 3i, adding 1 gives 4 + 3i. Correct.\n\nThen 5z + 7: 5*(1 + i) is 5 + 5i, adding 7 gives 12 + 5i. That's correct.\n\nThen |4 + 3i| = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5, and |12 + 5i| = sqrt(144 + 25) = 13. So, 5/13. Hmm, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, to cross-verify, I could compute w as a complex number and then compute its modulus. Let me try that approach as well.\n\nSo, w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). To compute this, I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it.\n\nThe"

So, let's do that.\n\n(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) divided by (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i).\n\nFirst, compute the denominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i) = 12² - (5i)² = 144 - 25i². Since i² = -1, this becomes 144 - 25*(-1) = 144 + 25 = 169. So, denominator is 169.\n\nNow, compute numerator: (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i).\n\nUsing FOIL:\n\n4*12 = 48\n\n4*(-5i) = -20i\n\n3i*12 = 36i\n\n3i*(-5i) = -15i²\n\nSo, adding these up: 48 - 20i + 36i -15i².\n\nCombine like terms: 48 + ( -20i + 36i ) + (-15i²).\n\nSo, that's 48 + 16i -15i².\n\nAgain, since i² = -1, -15*(-1) = 15.\n\nSo, this becomes 48 + 15 + 16i = 63 + 16i.\n\nTherefore, w = (63 + 16i)/169.\n\nWhich can be written as (63/169) + (16/169)i.\n\nSo, the real part is 63/169 and the imaginary part is 16/169.\n\nTherefore, |w| = sqrt( (63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2 ).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute (63/169)^2: 63 squared is 3969, and 169 squared is 28561, so 3969/28561.\n\nSimilarly, (16/169)^2: 256/28561.\n\nSo, adding them up: (3969 + 256)/28561 = 4225/28561.\n\nThe square root of that is sqrt(4225)/sqrt(28561). Now, sqrt(4225) is 65, because 65*65 = 4225.\n\nAnd sqrt(28561) is 169, because 169*169 = 28561.\n\nSo, sqrt(4225/28561) ="
