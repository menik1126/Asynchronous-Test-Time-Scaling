He walks 1/2 mile south initially and then another 1/2 mile south, totaling 1 mile south.\n\nNext, I'll calculate his eastward displacement, which is 3/4 mile.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. I'll square both the southward and eastward distances, add them together, and take the square root of the result.\n\nFinally, I'll round the answer to the nearest hundredth.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Total Southward Displacement**\n- Bill walks **$\\frac{1}{2}$** mile south.\n- Then, he walks another **$\\frac{1}{2}$** mile south.\n- **Total Southward Displacement:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Eastward Displacement**\n- Bill walks **$\\frac{3}{4}$** mile east.\n- **Eastward Displacement:**  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Straight-Line Distance from the Starting Point**\n- To find the straight-line distance from the starting point, we can visualize this as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.\n- **Southward Distance (Opposite Side):** 1 mile\n- **Eastward Distance (Adjacent Side):** $\\frac{3}{4}$ mile\n- Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Southward Distance})^2 + (\\text{Eastward Distance})^2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1 + 0.5625}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1.5625}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} \\approx 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer:"
