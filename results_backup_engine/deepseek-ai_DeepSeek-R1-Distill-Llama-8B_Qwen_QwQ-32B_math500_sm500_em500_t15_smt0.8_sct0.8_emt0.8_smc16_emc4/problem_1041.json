I need to find the number of different possible rational roots this polynomial can have. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Rational Root Theorem is useful for finding possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Yeah, that's the one. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, has p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nSo, in this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. That means p can be ±1, right? Because 1 is the only factor of 1. And q can be ±1 and ±2 because those are the factors of 2.\n\nWait, but when we write a rational number in lowest terms, we usually consider q to be positive. So actually, q can be 1 or 2, but since we can have negative denominators, but it's still considered the same as positive. So, I think we consider both 1 and -1 for q. Hmm, but actually, the theorem doesn't specify, but typically, to avoid duplicate roots, we just consider positive denominators. So, in that case, q can be 1 or 2.\n\nSo, for p, factors of the constant term, which is 1, are ±1. So, the possible values for p/q would be ±1/1 and ±1/2. Let me list them out:\n\n1. 1/1 = 1\n2. -1/1 = -1\n3. 1/2\n4. -1/2\n\nSo, that gives us four possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the number of different possible rational roots. So, are there four possible different rational roots?\n\nLet me double-check. The constant term is 1, so the possible roots are ±1. The leading coefficient is 2, so the denominators are 1 and 2. Therefore, combining these, the possible rational roots are indeed 1, -1, 1"

But does that mean that depending on the coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁, some of these roots might not actually be roots? Or is the question asking for all possible candidates that could be roots for some set of coefficients?\n\nHmm, the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots. So, the possible rational roots are the ones given by the Rational Root Theorem, but not all of them might actually be roots for some coefficients. Wait, but the question is about the number of different possible ones, so even if some can't be roots for any coefficients, but the possible ones are the ones given by the theorem. Wait, actually, the theorem gives all possible rational roots, so any rational root must be among those four. Therefore, the possible rational roots are exactly those four, so the number is four. But maybe there's a catch here?\n\nWait, let me think again. The polynomial is of degree 4, so it can have up to four roots. But the question is about the number of different possible rational roots. So, for example, maybe some of these candidates can't actually be roots for any integer coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁. Let me see.\n\nSuppose, for instance, that 1 is a root. Then plugging into the polynomial:\n\n2(1)^4 + a₃(1)^3 + a₂(1)^2 + a₁(1) + 1 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to 2 + a₃ + a₂ + a₁ + 1 = 0 → a₃ + a₂ + a₁ = -3. Since a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, this equation is possible. For example, if a₃ = 0, a₂ = 0, a₁ = -3, then 1 is a root. So 1 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, let's check -1:\n\n2(-1)^4 + a₃(-1)^3 + a₂(-1)^2 + a₁(-1) + 1 = 0\n\nCalculates to 2(1) + a₃(-1) + a₂(1) + a₁(-1) + 1 = 0 → 2"

            "output": " - a₃ + a₂ - a₁ + 1 = 0 → (-a₃ + a₂ - a₁) = -3. Again, possible, as integers can satisfy this equation.\n\nNow, 1/2:\n\n2*(1/2)^4 + a₃*(1/2)^3 + a₂*(1/2)^2 + a₁*(1/2) + 1 = 0.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\n\na₃*(1/8) = a₃/8\n\na₂*(1/4) = a₂/4\n\na₁*(1/2) = a₁/2\n\nPlus 1.\n\nSo, altogether: 1/8 + a₃/8 + a₂/4 + a₁/2 + 1 = 0\n\nMultiply everything by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ + 8 = 0 → a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ = -9.\n\nSince a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, this is possible. For example, let’s choose a₃=1, a₂=0, a₁= (-9 -1 -0)/4 = (-10)/4 = -2.5, which is not an integer. Hmm, okay, let me try a different approach. Let's set a₃=3, then 3 + 2a₂ +4a₁ = -9 → 2a₂ +4a₁ = -12 → a₂ + 2a₁ = -6. Set a₂= -6, a₁=0, then 3 + 2*(-6) +4*0= 3-12= -9. So yes, with a₃=3, a₂=-6, a₁=0, we have 1/2 as a root.\n\nSimilarly, -1/2:\n\n2*(-1/2)^4 + a₃*(-1/2)^3 + a₂*(-1/2)^2 + a₁*(-1/2) + 1 =0\n\nCalculates to:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\n\na₃*(-1/8) = -a₃/8\n\na₂*(1/4) = a₂/4\n\na₁*(-1/"

Hmm, maybe a different set. Let's set a₃=5, then:\n\n-5 +2a₂ -4a₁ = -9 → 2a₂ -4a₁= -4 → a₂ -2a₁= -2.\n\nLet’s choose a₂=0, then 0 -2a₁= -2 → a₁=1. So, a₃=5, a₂=0, a₁=1. Then:\n\n-5 +0 -4*1= -5 -4= -9, which works. So yes, -1/2 is possible.\n\nSo, all four possible rational roots can indeed be roots for some choice of integer coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁. Therefore, all four are possible.\n\nSo, the number of different possible rational roots is four.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I’m not missing anything. The problem says \"different possible rational roots\". So, could there be more? Well, according to the Rational Root Theorem, those four are the only possible candidates. So, since each of them can be achieved with some choice of integer coefficients, then the number is four.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different possible rational roots is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\) with integer coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\), we use the Rational Root Theorem.
