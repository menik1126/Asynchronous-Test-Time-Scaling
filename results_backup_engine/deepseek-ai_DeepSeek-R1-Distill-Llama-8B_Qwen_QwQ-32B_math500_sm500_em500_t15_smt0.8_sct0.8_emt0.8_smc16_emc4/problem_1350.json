The theorem states that when a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is divided by \\( x - a \\), the remainder is \\( f(a) \\).\n\nIn this case, I'm dividing \\( x^6 - 3 \\) by \\( x + 1 \\), which is equivalent to \\( x - (-1) \\). So, \\( a = -1 \\).\n\nNext, I'll substitute \\( a = -1 \\) into the polynomial:\n\\[\n(-1)^6 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the remainder when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\) is \\(-2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\), we can use the **Remainder Theorem**. The theorem states that the remainder of a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) divided by \\( x - a \\) is equal to \\( f(a) \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify \\( a \\):**\n   \n   We are dividing by \\( x + 1 \\), which can be rewritten as \\( x - (-1) \\). Therefore, \\( a = -1 \\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the polynomial at \\( x = a \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   f(a) = (-1)^6 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the quotient and remainder:**\n   \n   The remainder is \\( -2 \\). However, since we are asked for the quotient, we can express the division as:\n   \n   \\[\n   x^6 - 3 = (x + 1) \\cdot Q(x) + (-2)\n   \\]\n   \n   Here, \\( Q(x) \\) is the quotient polynomial.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   The **remainder** when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\) is \\(\\boxed{-2}\\)."
