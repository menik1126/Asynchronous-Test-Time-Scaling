To make it easier, I'll start by calculating \\(5^2\\).\n\nNext, I'll substitute \\(25\\) for \\(5^2\\), so the equation becomes \\(25 - 4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63\\).\n\nNow, I'll rewrite the equation to isolate the term with the variable \\(a\\). This means I'll move \\(25\\) to the other side by subtracting \\(25\\) from both sides, resulting in \\(-4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63 - 25\\).\n\nSimplifying further, I'll calculate \\(63 - 25\\) to get \\(38\\), so the equation becomes \\(-4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 38\\).\n\nTo eliminate the negative sign and the denominator, I'll multiply both sides by \\(3\\) and then by \\(-1\\), which gives me \\(4(5 - a)^2 = -38 \\times 3\\).\n\nCalculating \\(-38 \\times 3\\) yields \\(-114\\), so the equation is now \\(4(5 - a)^2 = -114\\).\n\nDividing both sides by \\(4\\), I get \\((5 - a)^2 = -114 \\div 4\\), which simplifies to \\((5 - a)^2 = -28.5\\).\n\nSince the square of a real number cannot be negative, there are no real solutions for \\(a\\).
