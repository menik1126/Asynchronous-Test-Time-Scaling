Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. We have three positive variables x, y, z. The condition given is xyz multiplied by the sum of x, y, and z equals 1. So, mathematically, that's:\n\nxyz(x + y + z) = 1.\n\nAnd the expression I need to minimize is (x + y)(y + z). Let me write that as well:\n\n(x + y)(y + z).\n\nI think it might help to expand this expression to see if it can be simplified or related to the given condition. Let's do that:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = x*y + x*z + y*y + y*z.\n\nSimplifying, that's:\n\n(xy + xz + y² + yz).\n\nHmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nI remember that for optimization problems involving products and sums, the AM-GM inequality often comes in handy. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me recall: the AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, with equality when all the numbers are equal.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express (x + y)(y + z) in terms that can be bounded using AM-GM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a substitution to reduce the number of variables. Let me think. If I let t = x + y + z, then the condition becomes xyz*t = 1, so xyz = 1/t. Hmm, not sure if that's directly helpful, but perhaps it can be used later.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can fix some variables or set up ratios to simplify the problem. Let's consider symmetry. If we can assume that x = z, does that help? Let me see.\n\nAssume x = z. Then, the condition becomes x*y*x*(x + y + x) = x²y*(2x + y) = 1. So, x²y(2x + y) = 1.\n\nThe expression to minimize becomes (x + y)("

But is it valid to assume x = z?\n\nHmm, maybe not necessarily, but sometimes in symmetric expressions, the minimum occurs at symmetric points. So I can try that path, but I should check later if that gives the minimal value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe setting variables in terms of each other. Let me think of variables substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider expanding (x + y)(y + z):\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let's see:\n\nLet me verify:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = x*y + x*z + y^2 + y*z. But y(x + y + z) is yx + y^2 + yz, so indeed, that's equal to that plus xz. So:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz.\n\nHmm, that's a good breakdown. Let me note that.\n\nSo, (x + y)(y + z) = y(t) + xz where t = x + y + z.\n\nWe know from the condition that xyz*t =1, so t =1/(xyz).\n\nTherefore, substituting t into the expression:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = y*(1/(xyz)) + xz.\n\nSimplify that term:\n\ny/(xyz) = 1/(xz).\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n1/(xz) + xz.\n\nSo, (x + y)(y + z) = xz + 1/(xz).\n\nAh! That's a big simplification! So, the expression reduces to xz + 1/(xz). Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\nStarting with (x+y)(y+z) = y(x+y+z) + xz. Since t = x + y + z, that's y*t + xz. Then, since xyz*t =1, so t=1/(xyz), so substituting that in, we get y/(xyz) + xz. The y cancels in the first term, giving 1/(xz) + xz. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to xz + 1/(xz). So, now, the problem"

Let's see, originally, we had t = x + y + z, and xyz*t =1, but since we've expressed (x + y)(y + z) in terms of x and z, and eliminated y, maybe y can be expressed in terms of x and z?\n\nHmm, maybe we can find a relation between x and z by expressing y in terms of x and z.\n\nWait, in the expression (x + y)(y + z), we set that equal to xz + 1/(xz). But perhaps I should approach it differently. Since we have x, y, z positive, maybe we can consider the variables to be related in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the substitution approach, let me consider that since (x + y)(y + z) is equal to xz + 1/(xz), then perhaps the expression xz + 1/(xz) can be minimized for positive x and z, regardless of y.\n\nWait, but is that valid? Because x, y, z are linked through the condition xyz(x + y + z)=1, so perhaps y is dependent on x and z. Thus, maybe I can't just minimize over x and z independently, but I need to consider the relation with y.\n\nWait, let's see: (x + y)(y + z) = xz + 1/(xz), from above. So, if we can express xz in terms of some variable, say w = xz, then the expression becomes w + 1/w. So, the expression xz + 1/(xz) is equal to w + 1/w, where w is positive since x and z are positive.\n\nNow, w + 1/w is a function that has a known minimum. Let me recall that for positive w, w + 1/w >= 2, with equality when w =1. So, the minimal value of w + 1/w is 2.\n\nBut wait, is this possible in our problem? Because w is xz, so if xz =1, then the expression becomes 2. So, if xz =1, then the expression (x + y)(y + z) would be 2.\n\nBut we need to check"

Let me see if we can choose x and y such that this equation is satisfied.\n\nSuppose we set x = z =1, so that xz =1. Then z=1, so x=1, z=1. Then, the equation becomes y*(1 + y +1) = y*(2 + y) =1.\n\nSo, solving for y: y^2 + 2y -1 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: y = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +4)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(8)]/2 = [-2 ± 2*sqrt(2)]/2 = -1 ± sqrt(2).\n\nSince y must be positive, we take y = -1 + sqrt(2). Wait, sqrt(2) is approx 1.414, so sqrt(2) -1 ≈ 0.414, which is positive. So that works.\n\nTherefore, when x = z =1, y = sqrt(2) -1, then the condition is satisfied, and (x + y)(y + z) = (1 + y)^2. Let's compute that:\n\n(1 + (sqrt(2) -1))^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. So that gives us the minimal value of 2. So, that's promising.\n\nBut wait, is this the minimal value?
