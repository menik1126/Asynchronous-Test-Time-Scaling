This property states that \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n} \\).\n\nApplying it here, the equation becomes \\( 3^{6k} = 3^6 \\).\n\nSince the bases are the same and the equation holds true, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, \\( 6k = 6 \\).\n\nFinally, solving for \\( k \\) gives \\( k = 1 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\) in the equation \\( (3^k)^6 = 3^6 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**:\n   \n   The equation can be simplified using the exponent rule \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n} \\).\n   \n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same (\\( 3 \\) in both terms), the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold true.\n   \n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \n   Divide both sides of the equation by \\( 6 \\) to isolate \\( k \\).\n   \n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1}\n   \\]\n\nThis concludes that \\( k \\) is equal to \\( 1 \\)."
