But let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that each term on the left side has a similar structure: the numerator is an integer, and the denominator is \\(x^2\\) minus that integer. So, each term is of the form \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\), where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.\n\nMaybe I can rewrite each term in a different way to see if there's a pattern or something I can work with. For example, I recall that partial fractions or substitution might be useful here.\n\nWait, but before jumping into substitutions, let me see if I can find a common denominator for all these terms. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). So, the least common denominator (LCD) would be the product of all these denominators, right? That would be \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). That seems really messy, but maybe it's necessary.\n\nBut combining all these fractions into a single equation with that LCD would result in a very large numerator. I'm not sure if that's manageable. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nLooking at the right side, it's a linear equation in \\(x\\): \\(2010x - 4\\). The left side is a sum of four rational functions. Maybe I can consider each side separately or find a substitution that simplifies the equation.\n\nLet me consider a substitution. Let me set \\(y = x^2\\). Then, each term on the left becomes \\(\\frac{k}{y - k}\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, 3, 4\\). So, the left side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\"

Since \\(y = x^2\\), maybe I can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\), but that would involve square roots, which complicates things. Maybe this substitution isn't helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider moving all terms to one side and then analyze the equation. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the left side as \\(L(x)\\) and the right side as \\(R(x)\\). So,\n\n\\[\nL(x) - R(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but this still looks complicated. Maybe I can consider the behavior of the equation. Since the left side has terms with denominators \\(x^2 - k\\), the function \\(L(x)\\) has vertical asymptotes at \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{1}\\), \\(\\pm \\sqrt{2}\\), \\(\\pm \\sqrt{3}\\), \\(\\pm 2\\). The right side is a straight line with a very steep slope (2010). \n\nGiven that the slope is so large, maybe the solutions are near the asymptotes? Or perhaps the equation can be manipulated in a way that allows us to find the sum of roots without solving for each individually?\n\nWait, the question asks for the sum of all complex solutions. In polynomial equations, the sum of roots can be found using Vieta's formula, but this equation isn't a polynomial. However, maybe after some manipulation, it can be transformed into a polynomial equation, and then Vieta's formula can be applied.\n\nLet me try to clear the denominators"

Hmm, maybe this substitution isn't the way to go.\n\nBack to the original equation. Maybe I can try to express the entire left side as a single function and then see if I can equate it to the right side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of substitution, think about the equation graphically: the left side is a sum of four hyperbola-like terms, each with their own vertical asymptotes, and the right side is a straight line. Since the line is so steep, it might intersect the left side in a limited number of points, maybe five or something? Or perhaps only two.\n\nBut I'm supposed to find the sum of all complex solutions.

Is the transformation from y to x correct? Because when we squared y, we introduced potential extraneous solutions, but since we're dealing with complex solutions, all should be accounted for.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut 2/1005 simplifies to 2/1005, but maybe it can be reduced? 2 and 1005 are coprime, since 1005 is 5*201, which is 5*3*67. So, yeah, 2/1005 is the reduced form.\n\nBut let me think again—this is an Olympiad problem. The sum is 2/1005. But 2/"
