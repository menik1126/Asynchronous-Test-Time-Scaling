Let me think... The equation is a quartic, which means it's a fourth-degree polynomial. Solving quartic equations can be tricky, but sometimes they can be factored into quadratics or even linear terms.\n\nLooking at the equation, I notice that the coefficients involve powers of \\( i \\), which makes me think maybe this polynomial is related to some kind of transformation in the complex plane. The presence of \\( z^4 \\) and \\( z^3i \\) terms reminds me of the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\). Let me check that:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 \\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n- \\( z^4 \\) is straightforward.\n- \\( 4z^3i \\) is the second term.\n- \\( 6z^2i^2 \\) simplifies because \\( i^2 = -1 \\), so this becomes \\( -6z^2 \\).\n- \\( 4zi^3 \\) simplifies since \\( i^3 = -i \\), so this is \\( -4zi \\).\n- \\( i^4 = 1 \\).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi + 1 \\).\n\nWait a minute! That's pretty close to our original equation, except for the constant term. Our equation is:\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\).\n\nComparing this to the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\), which is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi + 1 \\), the only difference is the constant term: in our equation it's \\( -i \\) versus \\( +1 \\) in the expansion. So if we subtract 2 from both sides of the original equation, we might get something:\n\nLet me rewrite the original"

So, the four points z are the four roots of \\( w^4 =1 +i \\), each shifted down by i.\n\nTherefore, the four points are located at the four roots of \\( w^4 =1 +i \\), which are equally spaced around a circle of radius \\( |1 +i|^{1/4} = ( \\sqrt{2} )^{1/4} = 2^{1/8} \\), centered at the origin in the w-plane. Then, when we subtract i, we translate this circle down by i in the complex plane (i.e., down by 1 unit in the imaginary direction).\n\nTherefore, the four points form a square rotated by some angle, scaled by 2^{1/8}, and then shifted down by i. The area of the polygon (which is a square) would then be the area of the original square before shifting, since translation doesn't affect area. Wait, but actually, shifting might not affect the shape's area, but the square is centered at the origin in the w-plane, so when shifted down by i, the center moves to -i, but the shape remains a square with the same side length.\n\nWait, but actually, the square is centered at the origin in the w-plane.

The four roots of \\( w^4 =1 +i \\) form a square centered at the origin, with vertices on a circle of radius \\( r = ( \\sqrt{2} )^{1/4} = 2^{1/8} \\). The distance from the center to each vertex is r, so the diagonal of the square is \\( 2r \\). The side length s of a square is \\( s = \\sqrt{2} r \\), but wait, no: the diagonal d of a square is \\( d = s \\sqrt{2} \\), so \\( s = d / \\sqrt{2} \\). Therefore, with diagonal \\( 2r \\), the side length is \\( s = (2r) / \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} r \\). Therefore, the area A is \\( s^2 = ( \\sqrt{2} r )^2 = 2 r^2 \\).\n\nSince \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\), \\( r^2 = 2^{1/4} \\), so area A = \\( 2 * 2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nBut wait, let's think again. Is the diagonal 2r? The square is centered at the origin, and the four points are on a circle of radius r. So, the distance from the center to each vertex is r, so the diagonal of the square is the distance between two opposite vertices, which is 2r. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThus, the area is \\( (2r)^2 / 2 = (4r^2)/2 = 2r^2 \\). Wait, no: Actually, for a square, area is (diagonal)^2 / 2. Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, for a square, if the diagonal is d, then the area is \\( (d^2)/2 \\).\n\nGiven that the diagonal d = 2r, then area is \\( ( (2r)^2 ) / 2 = (4r^2)/2 = 2 r^2 \\). So, yes, same as before.\n\nSince \\( r = 2^{1/8}"

Since the roots are the fourth roots of \\(1 +i \\), which are equally spaced on a circle, so they form a square. So the area is indeed that of the square. But when we shift all points by -i, does that affect the area? No, translation doesn't change the area. So the area remains \\(2^{5/4}\\). Therefore, the answer is 5 +4 +2=11.\n\nBut let me confirm this calculation again.\n\nWait, modulus of \\(1 +i\\) is sqrt(2), so the fourth root is (sqrt(2))^{1/4}= (2^{1/2})^{1/4}=2^{1/8}. So radius r=2^{1/8}. The diagonal of the square is 2r, so area is (2r)^2 /2 = (4*2^{1/4}) /2 = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^(5/4), so p=2, a=5, b=4, so 5+4+2=11. So the answer is 11.\n\nWait, but let me check again if the polygon is indeed a square. The roots of \\( w^4 =1 +i \\) are equally spaced around the circle, so they form a square. Since the angle between each root is 90 degrees (since it's a fourth root), so yes, they form a square.
