Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\nThe prime numbers less than 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll identify the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are those that are not divisible by 2.\n\nThe odd numbers greater than zero are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29.\n\nNow, I'll find the intersection of these two sets. The intersection consists of the numbers that are common to both sets.\n\nLooking at the lists, the numbers that appear in both sets are: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23, 29.\n\nFinally, I'll count these common elements to determine the number of elements in the intersection.\n\nThere are 8 prime numbers less than 30 that are also odd numbers greater than zero.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of the two sets contains 8 elements.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many elements are in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the set of all prime numbers less than 30:**\n   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n   - Prime numbers less than 30 are: **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29**.\n\n2. **Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than zero:**\n   - Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2.\n   - Odd numbers greater than zero are: **1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29**.\n\n3. **Find the intersection of these two sets:**\n   - The intersection consists of numbers that"
