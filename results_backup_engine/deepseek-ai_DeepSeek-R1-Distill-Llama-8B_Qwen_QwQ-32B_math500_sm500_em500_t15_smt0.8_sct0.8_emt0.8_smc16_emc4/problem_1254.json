            "output": "To find the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal, I need to convert the decimal number 999 into base six.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 999 by 6 to find the largest power of 6 that fits into 999. Dividing 999 by 6 gives 166 with a remainder of 3. This means that 6 raised to the power of 2 (36) is the highest power less than 999.\n\nNext, I'll divide 166 by 6 to find the next digit. Dividing 166 by 6 gives 27 with a remainder of 4. This means the next digit in base six is 4.\n\nThen, I'll divide 27 by 6 to find the third digit. Dividing 27 by 6 gives 4 with a remainder of 3. This means the third digit in base six is 3.\n\nFinally, I'll divide 4 by 6 to find the last digit. Dividing 4 by 6 gives 0 with a remainder of 4. This means the last digit in base six is 4.\n\nCombining all the digits from the remainders in the order they were obtained, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 1344.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of \\( 999_{10} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6** to determine the highest power of 6 that fits into 999.\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   So, the first digit (from the left) in base six is **3**, representing \\( 6^2 = 36 \\).\n\n2. **Divide 166 by 6** to find the next digit.\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   The next digit is **4**, representing \\( 6^1 = 6 \\).\n\n3. **Divide 27 by 6** to determine the next digit.\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   The following digit is **3**, representing \\( 6^0 = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Divide 4 by 6** to find the final digit.\n"
