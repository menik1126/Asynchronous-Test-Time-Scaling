This involves multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1 - 2i).\n\nAfter multiplying, the expression becomes (3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) over (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i), which simplifies to (3 - 6i + 4i - 8i²) over (1 - (2i)²).\n\nSimplifying the numerator further, I account for the fact that i² equals -1, so it becomes (3 - 2i + 8) over (1 - (-4)), leading to (11 - 2i) over 5.\n\nFinally, dividing each term by 5, the result is 11/5 - (2/5)i.\n</think>\n\nLet's correct William's calculation step by step.\n\n**Problem:**\nCalculate \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\).\n\n**Step 1: Multiply Numerator and Denominator by the Complex Conjugate of the Denominator**\n\nThe complex conjugate of \\(1 + 2i\\) is \\(1 - 2i\\).
