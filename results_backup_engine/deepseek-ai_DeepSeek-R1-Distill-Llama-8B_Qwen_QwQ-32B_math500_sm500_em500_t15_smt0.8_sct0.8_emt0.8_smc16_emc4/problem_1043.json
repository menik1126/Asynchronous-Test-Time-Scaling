Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFrom what I remember, the Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction p/q, where p and q are integers, must satisfy that p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, let's break that down.\n\nFirst, the possible values for p are the factors of the constant term, which is 1. The factors of 1 are just ±1 because 1 divided by 1 is 1, and 1 divided by -1 is -1. So, p can be either 1 or -1.\n\nNext, the possible values for q are the factors of the leading coefficient, which is 2. The factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. So, q can be 1, -1, 2, or -2.\n\nNow, according to the Rational Root Theorem, each possible rational root is a combination of p divided by q. That means we take each p and divide it by each possible q, which gives us several possible roots. Let me list them out.\n\nStarting with p = 1:\n- 1 divided by 1 is 1\n- 1 divided by -1 is -1\n- 1 divided by 2 is 1/2\n- 1 divided by -2 is -1/2\n\nNow, for p = -1:\n- -1 divided by 1 is -1\n- -1 divided by -1 is 1\n- -1 divided by 2 is -1/2\n- -1 divided by -2 is 1/2\n\nWait a second, some of these are duplicates. For example, when I do -1 divided by -1, I get 1, which is the same as when p was 1 and q was 1. Similarly, 1 divided by 2 is 1/"

            "output": "2, and -1 divided by 2 is -1/2, which are different, but when I switch the signs in the denominator, like 1 divided by -2 is -1/2, which is the same as -1 divided by 2.\n\nSo, let's list out all unique possibilities:\n\n1, -1, 1/2, -1/2\n\nWait, that seems like four different possible rational roots. Let me make sure I haven't missed any or included any extra.\n\nLooking back, p can be ±1, and q can be ±1, ±2. So, the possible roots are:\n\n1/1 = 1\n-1/1 = -1\n1/-1 = -1\n-1/-1 = 1\n1/2\n-1/2\n1/-2 = -1/2\n-1/-2 = 1/2\n\nSo, the unique ones are indeed 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2. So, that's four different possible rational roots.\n\nI think that's all. So, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different possible rational roots is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different possible rational roots for the polynomial\n\n\\[2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0,\\]\n\nwe use the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nFor the given polynomial:\n- The constant term is 1, so the possible values of \\(p\\) (factors of 1) are \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\).\n- The leading coefficient is 2, so the possible values of \\(q\\) (factors of 2) are \\(1\\), \\(-1\\), \\(2\\), and \\(-2\\).\n\nWe then form all possible combinations of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\):\n\n- For \\(p = 1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{-1} = -1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2"
