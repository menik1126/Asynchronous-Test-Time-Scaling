The problem states that matrix M transforms the vector [2, -1] to [9, 3] and [1, -3] to [7, -1]. I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M and express it in the form y = mx + b.\n\nAlright, step one is probably figuring out what matrix M looks like. Since M is a linear transformation from R^2 to R^2, it should be a 2x2 matrix. To find M, I can use the fact that it transforms one vector to another. So if I have a vector v and its image Mv, I can set up equations to find the matrix.\n\nLet me denote matrix M as [a b; c d]. So, when M acts on [2; -1], it gives [9; 3]. That means:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9  \nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, when M acts on [1; -3], it gives [7; -1], so:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7  \nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9  \n2. -2d - b = 3  \n3. a - 3b = 7  \n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nHmm, okay, so equations 1 and 3 involve a and b. Equations 2 and 4 involve c and d. Let me solve for a and b first.\n\nLooking at equations 1 and 3:\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9  \nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nI can solve equation 1 for b: b = 2a - 9\n\nThen plug that into equation 3: a - 3*(2a - 9) = 7  \na - 6a + 27 = 7  \n-5a + 27 = 7  \n-5a = -20  \na = 4\n\nThen b = 2*4 - 9 = 8 - 9 = -1\n\nOkay, so a=4 and b=-"
