There are 360 students in total, and 15 don't take any of the subjects, so 345 students are enrolled in at least one of calculus, physics, or chemistry.\n\nLet me define the variables:\n- Let C represent the number of students taking Calculus.\n- Let P represent the number of students taking Physics.\n- Let Ch represent the number of students taking Chemistry.\n\nFrom the problem, I know:\n- Total students: 360\n- Students not taking any: 15\n- Students taking Calculus: 180\n- Students taking both Calculus and Chemistry: 75\n- Students taking both Physics and Chemistry: 75\n- Students taking both Calculus and Physics: 30\n- Twice as many students take Chemistry as Physics: Ch = 2P\n- Total students enrolled in at least one subject: C + P + Ch - (students taking both Calculus and Physics) - (students taking both Calculus and Chemistry) - (students taking both Physics and Chemistry) + (students taking all three subjects) = 345\n\nNow, I'll plug in the known values:\n180 (C) + P + Ch - 30 (both Calculus and Physics) - 75 (both Calculus and Chemistry) - 75 (both Physics and Chemistry) + (students taking all three) = 345\n\nSince the problem doesn't mention students taking all three subjects, I'll assume there are none. This simplifies the equation to:\n\n180 + P + Ch - 30 - 75 - 75 = 345\n\nCombining like terms:\n180 - 30 - 75 - 75 + P + Ch = 345\n180 - 180 + P + Ch = 345\nP + Ch = 345\n\nGiven that Ch = 2P, I can substitute:\nP + 2P = 345\n3P = 345\nP = 115\n\nSo, 115 students take Physics.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students: 360\n- Students not taking any of the subjects: 15\n- Students taking Calculus (C): 180\n- Students taking both Calculus and Chemistry: 75\n- Students taking both Physics and Chemistry: 75\n- Students taking both Calculus and Physics: 30\n- Students taking Chemistry"
