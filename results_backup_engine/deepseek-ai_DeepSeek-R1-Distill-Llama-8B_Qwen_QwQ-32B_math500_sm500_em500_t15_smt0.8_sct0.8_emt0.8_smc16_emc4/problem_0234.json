Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Bill walks half a mile south. I know that south is one of the cardinal directions, so that means he's moving along the negative y-axis if I consider his starting point as the origin (0,0). So after walking 1/2 mile south, his position would be (0, -1/2).\n\nNext, he walks 3/4 mile east. East is a cardinal direction as well, so that's along the positive x-axis. Adding that to his current position, I just add 3/4 to the x-coordinate. So now, his position is (3/4, -1/2).\n\nThen, he walks another 1/2 mile south. So that's another movement along the negative y-axis. Adding that distance to his current y-coordinate, which was -1/2. So, -1/2 plus another -1/2 equals -1. Wait, no. Hold on, that's not right. Let me double-check. He was at (3/4, -1/2) after the first two moves, and then he walks another 1/2 mile south. So, subtracting 1/2 from his current y-coordinate. So that would be -1/2 - 1/2, which is indeed -1. So now, his position is (3/4, -1).\n\nNow, I need to find the straight-line distance from his starting point, which is at (0,0), to his final position at (3/4, -1). To find the straight-line distance between two points in a plane, I can use the distance formula. The distance formula is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in each coordinate.\n\nSo, the difference in the x-coordinates is 3/4 minus 0, which is 3/4. The difference in the y-coordinates is -1 minus 0, which is -1. But since we square these differences, the negative won't matter.\n\nCalculating the squares: (3/4)^2 is 9/16, and (-1)^2 is 1. So adding those together, 9/16 + 1. Wait, 1 is 16/16, so 9/16"

Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting at (0,0). First move: 1/2 south, so (0, -0.5). Then 3/4 east: (0.75, -0.5). Then another 1/2 south: adding to the y-coordinate, so -0.5 - 0.5 = -1. So final position (0.75, -1). \n\nDistance from origin: sqrt((0.75)^2 + (-1)^2). \n\nCalculating 0.75 squared: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625. \n\n1 squared is 1. \n\nAdding them: 0.5625 + 1 = 1.5625. \n\nSquare root of 1.5625. Hmm, sqrt(1.44) is 1.2, sqrt(1.5625)... Wait, 1.25 squared is 1.5625 because 1.25 * 1.25 = 1.5625. So yes, the square root is 1.25. \n\nSo the distance is 1.25 miles. \n\nWait, but the question says to express the answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. Well, 1.25 is already exact to the hundredth place. So I think that's the answer. \n\nBut let me just confirm once more. Maybe I messed up the directions? Let me see. South is negative y, east is positive x. So first move south: correct. Then east: correct. Then another south: correct. Coordinates are (0.75, -1). Distance formula applied correctly. \n\nHmm, seems okay. So the answer should be 1.25 miles. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the fractions. Let me do it using fractions instead of decimals to see if it's the"

            "output": " same.\n\nSo, 3/4 is 0.75, but let's keep it as a fraction. (3/4)^2 is 9/16. (-1)^2 is 1, which is 16/16. So 9/16 + 16/16 is 25/16. Square root of 25/16 is 5/4, which is 1.25. Same result. \n\nSo yes, definitely 1.25 miles. No need to round since it's exact to the hundredth place.\n</think>\n\nBill's final position is 3/4 mile east and 1 mile south from the origin. Using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 + ( -1 )^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\n\\]\n\nSo, the straight-line distance from his starting point is \\boxed{1.25} miles."
