Plugging in the known values, the equation becomes \\(45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\\).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the equation to solve for \\(h\\).** First, divide both sides of the equation by \\(\\pi\\) to get \\(45 = 9h\\). Then, divide both sides by 9 to find \\(h = 5\\) centimeters.\n\n**Conclusion:** The height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder:**\n   \n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n   where \\( V \\) is the volume, \\( r \\) is the radius, and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n2. **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n   \n   Given that the volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters and the radius \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters, plug these values into the formula:\n   \n   \\[\n   45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the equation to solve for \\( h \\):**\n   \n   Divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\pi \\):\n   \n   \\[\n   45 = 9h\n   \\]\n   \n   Next, divide both sides by 9:\n   \n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   The height \\( h \\) of the cylinder is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{5}\n   \\]"
