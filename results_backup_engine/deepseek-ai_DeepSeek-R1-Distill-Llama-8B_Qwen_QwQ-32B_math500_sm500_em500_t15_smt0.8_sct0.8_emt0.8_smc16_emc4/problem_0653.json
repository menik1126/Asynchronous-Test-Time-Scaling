The problem states that for all real numbers x, the value of P(x) is squeezed between two other quadratic expressions: x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3. So, mathematically, that means:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all real x.\n\nAdditionally, we're told that P(11) = 181. The goal is to find P(16).\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, it has the general form:\n\nP(x) = ax² + bx + c,\n\nwhere a, b, c are real coefficients that we need to determine.\n\nGiven the inequalities, for every x, P(x) must lie between the two given quadratics. So, it's bounded above and below by them. That makes me think that the quadratic we're looking for, P(x), must touch the upper quadratic at some point or maybe they are the same quadratic, but I don't think so because their leading coefficients are different. The lower quadratic has a leading coefficient of 1, and the upper one has 2. So, P(x) must be squeezed between them.\n\nOne approach is to consider the difference between P(x) and the lower bound, and the difference between the upper bound and P(x). Both differences should be non-negative for all x. So, let's write that down.\n\nLet me define two functions:\n\nLower difference: Q(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2).\n\nUpper difference: R(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x).\n\nSince P(x) is sandwiched between these two quadratics for all real x, both Q(x) and R(x) must be non-negative for all x.\n\nSo, Q(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nAnd R(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSo, let's substitute P(x) into these:\n\nQ(x) = (ax² + bx + c) - x² +"

Since they are both quadratics, maybe the difference between P(x) and the lower bound, and the upper bound minus P(x) are both squares? Because if they are perfect squares and non-negative, that could satisfy the discriminant conditions.\n\nWait, if Q(x) and R(x) are non-negative definite, then they could be squares of some linear functions. But since Q and R are quadratics, if they are non-negative everywhere, they must be squares of linear functions or zero. But since Q(x) and R(x) can have different leading coefficients.\n\nWait, but if they are perfect squares, then their discriminant would be zero. However, the inequalities are ≤ 0 for discriminants, so maybe they can be zero or negative. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two quadratics x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² -4x +3 touch the polynomial P(x) at certain points. Since the inequalities hold for all real x, the regions where the two bounds touch P(x) would be at points where P(x) is exactly equal to the upper or lower bound. Since it's a quadratic, maybe they intersect exactly at one point each, or perhaps the entire polynomial coincides with one of the bounds? But the bounds are different.\n\nWait, let's see the two bounding quadratics.\n\nLet me compute the lower quadratic: L(x) = x² - 2x + 2.\n\nUpper quadratic: U(x) = 2x² -4x +3.\n\nLet me see their difference: U(x) - L(x) = (2x² -4x +3) - (x² -2x +2) = x² -2x +1.\n\nWait, this is interesting. The difference between the upper and the lower is x² - 2x +1, which factors as (x -1)^2.\n\nSo, the upper bound is exactly the lower bound plus (x -1)^2. So, U(x) = L(x) + (x -1)^2.\n\nTherefore, the gap between the two bounds is (x -1)^2. Since (x-1)^2 is always non-negative, the difference between upper"
