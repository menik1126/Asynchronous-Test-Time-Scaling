            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here about a quadratic polynomial P(x). The problem says that P(x) is between two other quadratic expressions for all real numbers x: specifically, x² - 2x + 2 is less than or equal to P(x), which is less than or equal to 2x² - 4x + 3. Additionally, we know that P(11) is equal to 181, and we need to find P(16). \n\nOkay, let's start by breaking down what this means. Since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, it has the form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. The problem gives us two inequalities that bound P(x) from below and above. \n\nFirst, the lower bound is given by x² - 2x + 2. So for every real x, P(x) must be greater than or equal to this expression. Similarly, the upper bound is 2x² - 4x + 3, so P(x) must be less than or equal to this for all real x.\n\nSo, mathematically, we can write this as:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ ax² + bx + c ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nThis inequality must hold for all real numbers x. \n\nSince these are quadratic expressions, one approach is to consider the difference between P(x) and the lower bound, and between P(x) and the upper bound, and ensure that these differences are non-negative and non-positive, respectively.\n\nLet me define two new functions:\n\nf(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\n\ng(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c)\n\nSince f(x) is non-negative for all x, and g(x) is non-positive for all x, both f(x) and g(x) must be quadratic functions that open upwards and downwards, respectively, or at least have the same leading coefficient or opposite leading coefficients?\n\nWait, more precisely, since f(x) ≥ 0 for all x, if a - 1 is positive, then f"

            "output": "(x) is a quadratic that opens upwards, so we can ensure it's always non-negative by having its discriminant ≤ 0. Similarly, if a - 1 were zero, then f(x) would become a linear function or a constant. But to ensure f(x) is non-negative everywhere, if it's linear, it would have to be a constant, but since the original inequality is an inequality between quadratics, maybe all cases need to be considered.\n\nSimilarly for g(x) ≤ 0 for all x, the quadratic must open downward (so leading coefficient 2 - a is negative, so a > 2?) but wait, actually, that's not necessarily correct. Wait:\n\nWait, for g(x) ≤ 0 for all x, first, the leading coefficient of g(x) is (2 - a). If this is positive, then the quadratic opens upwards, which would mean it can't be always ≤0 unless it's a single point or the coefficient is negative. Therefore, actually, to have a quadratic that's always ≤0, it needs to open downward (i.e., leading coefficient negative) and have its discriminant ≤0. Similarly, f(x) must open upwards (leading coefficient positive) and have discriminant ≤0.\n\nTherefore, let's formalize this:\n\nFor f(x) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x, we have two conditions:\n\n1. The leading coefficient a - 1 must be ≥ 0,\n\n2. The discriminant (of f(x)) must be ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, for g(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) ≤ 0 for all x:\n\n1. Leading coefficient (2 - a) must be ≤ 0,\n\n2. Discriminant of g(x) must be ≤ 0.\n\nLet me write these down step by step.\n\nFirst, starting with f(x):\n\n1.

So for it to be ≤0 for all x, it must be a constant function? Because otherwise, it will go to -∞ or +∞ as x approaches ±∞. So unless it's a constant function, which would require both the coefficient of x and the constant term to be zero.\n\nSo, if a=2, then in g(x):\n\nThe coefficient of x is (-4 - b), and the constant term is (3 - c).

So, depending on the sign of (3 -c), this term can be positive or negative.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inequalities given in the problem can be interpreted as P(x) being sandwiched between two quadratics, so maybe P(x) is actually equal to both quadratics at some points, which would mean that the inequalities become equalities at those points, so that the difference between P(x) and the lower bound, and the upper bound and P(x) have double roots, so their discriminants are zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal and maximal possible quadratics that satisfy the inequalities are the ones where the inequalities become equalities, so perhaps P(x) is exactly equal to the lower bound or upper bound at some points, but since it's sandwiched between them everywhere, maybe the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is a perfect square, and similarly the difference between the upper bound and P(x) is also a perfect square? \n\nWait, that might be a good approach.

But since it's a quadratic, it's either a perfect square times a positive constant or a sum of squares, but for quadratics, the only way a quadratic is non-negative everywhere is if it's a perfect square or a sum of two squares. But since it's a quadratic, it can be written as k(x - h)^2 where k ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) must be non-positive everywhere, so it can be written as -k(x - h)^2 where k ≥0.
