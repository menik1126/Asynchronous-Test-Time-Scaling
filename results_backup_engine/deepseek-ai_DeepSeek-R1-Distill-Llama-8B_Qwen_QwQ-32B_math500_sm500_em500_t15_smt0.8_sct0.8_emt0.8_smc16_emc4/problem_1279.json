Specifically, \\(256 = 2^8\\).\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, it becomes \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nUsing the power of a power property, \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal, so \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) step by step.\n\n1. **Express 256 as a power of 2:**\n   \n   We know that \\(256 = 2^8\\), since \\(2^8 = 256\\).\n\n   Substituting this into the equation:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the right side using exponent rules:**\n   \n   When a power is raised to another power, you multiply the exponents:\n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \n   Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
