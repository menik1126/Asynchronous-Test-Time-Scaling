Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given:\n\n- The sum of the sequence: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n- The sum of their squares: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n- The sum of their cubes: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\). Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but maybe there are some patterns or formulas that relate these sums.\n\nI remember that for a set of numbers, if we know the sums of powers, sometimes we can relate them to the elementary symmetric sums or use inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder's inequality. Maybe Cauchy-Schwarz can help here. Let me recall Cauchy-Schwarz:\n\n\\( \\left( \\sum a_i^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum b_i^2 \\right) \\geq \\left( \\sum a_i b_i \\right)^2 \\)\n\nBut in this case, I don't have another sequence \\( b_i \\) given, so maybe that's not directly applicable. Let me think about another approach.\n\nWait, I remember that for any real numbers, there's a relationship between the sums of powers and the power sums can be related to the moments of a measure. But that might be too abstract. Maybe a better approach is to consider the case where all \\( a_i \\) are equal. If that's possible, then I can compute \\( n \\).\n\nSo, if all \\( a_i \\) are equal, then each \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\). Let's plug that into the other sums:\n\nSum of squares: \\( n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{96^2}{n} = 144 \\). Let's see:\n\n\\( \\frac{9216}{n} = 144 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\( n = \\frac{9216}{144} = 64 \\)\n\nWait, so"

So there might be other configurations where the terms aren't all equal but still satisfy the given sums. Hmm, so I need to find all possible n where such a sequence exists, then add them up.\n\nHmm, how can I approach this? Maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find constraints on n?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of variance. Let me think of the variance of the sequence.

Let's think.\n\nWait, if n is larger than 64, that means the average \\( \\frac{96}{n} \\) becomes smaller, so the numbers would be more spread out. But the sum of squares is fixed. So, if we spread the numbers more, how does that affect the sum of squares?\n\nI know that for a fixed sum, the sum of squares is minimized when all the numbers are equal. Therefore, if we have n > 64, the sum of squares would increase, but in our case, the sum of squares is fixed at 144, which is lower than the minimal possible for n>64. Therefore, it's impossible for n to be greater than 64 because you can't have a sum of squares lower than the minimal without violating the constraints.\n\nWait, let me clarify that.\n\nSuppose that n > 64. Then, the minimal sum of squares when n=64 is 144. For any n > 64, if we tried to spread the numbers so that some are larger and some are smaller, the sum of squares would have to be larger than 144. But we have the sum of squares fixed at 144. So, that can't happen. Therefore, n cannot be greater than 64.\n\nTherefore, n must be exactly 64.\n\nBut hold on, earlier I assumed that all a_i are equal. What if we have some a_i larger and some smaller? Could that still satisfy the conditions?\n\nWait, but if n is larger than 64, say 65, can the sum of squares still be 144? Let me check with n=65.\n\nIf n=65, then the average is about 96/65 ≈ 1.4769.\n\nThen, if I set some numbers to be higher and some lower, the sum of squares will increase because (sum of squares is minimized when all the same). So, for n=65, the minimal sum of squares would be higher than 144.\n\nBut our sum of squares is 144, which is less than that. So, it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, n must be exactly 64.\n\nWait, but in the first part, I assumed all a_i equal, which gave n=64, and for n=64, the variance is zero. So, the"
