Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have fractions like this, especially with different denominators, you can combine them by finding a common denominator. That common denominator would be the product of the two individual denominators, right? So in this case, the denominators are (x - 3) and (x + 8). So the common denominator would be (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, if I combine the two fractions on the left side, the denominator becomes (x - 3)(x + 8). Then, the numerator will be C times (x + 8) plus D times (x - 3). So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait a second, the denominator on the right side is x² + 5x - 24. I should probably factor that to see if it's related to the common denominator I found. Let me factor x² + 5x - 24. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3. Because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, it factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). That's the same as my common denominator! Great, so that means the denominators on both sides are the same, which is a good sign. So now, I can set the numerators equal to each other because if two fractions are equal, their numerators must be equal when the denominators are the same (and not zero, which is already given).\n\nSo, setting the numerators equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3)"

            "output": " = 4x - 23\n\nOkay, now I need to solve for C and D. Let me expand the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, since this equation must hold for all real x except -8 and 3, the coefficients of corresponding terms must be equal. That means the coefficients of x on both sides should be equal, and the constant terms should be equal as well.\n\nSo, setting up the system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nAlright, now I have two equations with two variables, C and D. I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Maybe substitution is easier here. From the first equation, I can express C in terms of D or vice versa. Let me solve the first equation for C:\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nThen, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n8*(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet me compute that step by step. Multiply 8 by (4 - D):\n\n8*4 = 32\n8*(-D) = -8D\nSo, 32 - 8D\n\nThen subtract 3D:\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = 32 - 11D\n\nSet that equal to -23:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nNow, solve for D:\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo, D is 5. Then, plug back into C = 4 - D:\n\nC = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Therefore, the product CD is (-1)*5 = -5.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my work because sometimes I might make a mistake in signs or arithmetic.\n\nFirst, checking the substitution:\n\nFrom C + D = 4, we had C = 4 - D. Then, substituting into 8C - 3D:\n\n8*(4"

Correct.\n\nSo, the product CD is (-1)*5 = -5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can plug back into the original equation to verify.\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side:\n\nC/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (-1)/(x - 3) + 5/(x +8)\n\nCombine them over the common denominator (x -3)(x +8):\n\n[ -1*(x +8) +5*(x -3) ] / (x -3)(x +8)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-1*(x +8) = -x -8\n\n5*(x -3) =5x -15\n\nSo adding those: (-x -8) + (5x -15) = ( -x +5x ) + (-8 -15 ) = 4x -23\n\nWhich is exactly the numerator on the right side. So yes, the left-hand side becomes (4x -23)/((x -3)(x +8)), which is equal to the right-hand side. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct, and CD = (-1)(5) = -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe product CD is \\boxed{-5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the product \\(CD\\) of the integers \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) for which\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nwe start by noting that the denominator on the right side factors as \\((x + 8)(x - 3)\\).
