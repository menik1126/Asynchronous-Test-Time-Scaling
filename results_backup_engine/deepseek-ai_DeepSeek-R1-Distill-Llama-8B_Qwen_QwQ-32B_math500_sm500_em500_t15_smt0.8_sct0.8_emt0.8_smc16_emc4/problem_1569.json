            "output": "Alright, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of (5 over root 80 plus sqrt 845 over 9 plus sqrt 45) all divided by sqrt 5. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me write it down more clearly to visualize it better.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n√[(5/√80 + √845 / 9 + √45) / √5]\n\nOkay, the goal is to simplify this to a simplified fraction. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are square roots in numerators and denominators. Maybe I can simplify each square root term before dealing with the entire expression. Let me look at each term inside the big square root.\n\nStarting with 5/√80. I can simplify √80 because 80 is not a prime number. Let me factor 80: 80 is 16 times 5, right? 16 is a perfect square, so √80 = √(16×5) = √16 × √5 = 4√5. So 5/√80 becomes 5/(4√5).\n\nWait, 5/(4√5) might be further simplified. Since there's a √5 in the denominator, maybe I can rationalize it. To do that, I can multiply numerator and denominator by √5. So:\n\n(5 × √5) / (4√5 × √5) = (5√5)/(4×5) = (5√5)/20.\n\nSimplifying that, 5 and 20 can be divided by 5: 5/20 = 1/4, so it becomes √5 / 4.\n\nSo, the first term simplifies to √5 / 4.\n\nNext term: √845 / 9. Let me simplify √845. 845 divided by 5 is 169, so 845 = 5 × 169. 169 is 13 squared, so √845 = √(5×13²) = √5 × 13 = 13√5. Therefore, √845 / 9 = 13√5 / 9.\n\nSo the second term is 13√5 / 9.\n\nThird term: √45. Let me simplify that. 45 is 9×5, so √45 = √(9×5) = 3√5.\n\nSo, √45 is 3√5.\n\n"

            "output": "Now, let's rewrite the expression with these simplifications:\n\n√[(√5 / 4 + 13√5 / 9 + 3√5) / √5]\n\nHmm, now all the terms inside the numerator have √5. That's helpful because I can factor that out or find a common denominator. Let me write them out:\n\n√5 / 4 + 13√5 / 9 + 3√5\n\nLet me factor out √5 from each term:\n\n√5 (1/4 + 13/9 + 3)\n\nWait, 3 can be written as 3/1. So, let me convert all these fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) would be 36.\n\nSo, converting each term:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = 52/36\n\n3/1 = 108/36\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169. So, 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the numerator simplifies to √5 × (169/36) = (169√5)/36.\n\nSo now, the entire expression becomes:\n\n√[(169√5 / 36) / √5]\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n√[(169√5) / (36√5)]\n\nBecause dividing by √5 is the same as multiplying by 1/√5.\n\nSimplify the numerator and denominator: √5 cancels out.\n\nSo, we have √[(169 / 36)]\n\nWhich is √169 divided by √36, which is 13/6.\n\nWait, hold on. So, the expression simplifies to 13/6.\n\nWait, let me retrace to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step.\n\nFirst term: 5/√80 became √5/4. Correct.\n\nSecond term: √845 became 13√5, so 13√5 /9. Correct.\n\nThird term: √45 became 3√5. Correct.\n\nAdding them together: √5/4 + 13√5/9 + 3√5.\n\nFactor out √5: √5 (1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Correct.\n\nConvert to common denominator: 36.\n\n1/4 is 9/36, 13/9"

Correct.\n\nSo, √5 × 169/36 is 169√5 / 36.\n\nThen, dividing that by √5: (169√5 / 36) / √5 = 169/36.\n\nTaking the square root of that: √(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nSo, yeah, 13/6 is the simplified fraction.\n\nWait a second, that seems straightforward, but let me just check the initial step.\n\nWait, is 5/√80 equal to √5 /4? Let me recalculate.\n\n5 / √80. √80 is 4√5, so 5/(4√5). Multiply numerator and denominator by √5: (5√5)/(4×5) = √5 /4. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, √845: 13² is 169, 169×5 is 845, so yes, √845 is 13√5. Correct.\n\n√45 is 3√5, correct.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct.\n\nHmm, but wait, the question says \"simplify the following expression to a simplified fraction,\" so 13/6 is already a reduced fraction. So, 13 and 6 have no common factors, so that's the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if I can represent 13/6 as a mixed number, but the question asks for a fraction, so 13/6 is fine.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is simplified step-by-step as follows:\n\n1. **Simplify each square root term:**\n   - \\( \\sqrt{80} = 4\\sqrt{5} \\) so \\( \\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\).\n   - \\( \\sqrt{845} = 13\\sqrt{5} \\) so \\( \\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9} = \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9} \\).\n   - \\( \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5} \\).\n\n2. **Combine the terms inside the numerator:**\n   - \\( \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4} + \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\\"
