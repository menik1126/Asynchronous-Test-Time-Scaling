            "output": "Okay, so I need to find all the integer roots of the equation \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). Hmm, where do I start? I remember that for finding integer roots, the Rational Root Theorem is useful. It says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at the equation, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are the factors of -14 divided by the factors of 1, which simplifies to just the factors of -14. That means the possible integer roots are limited to the divisors of 14. \n\nLet me list the divisors of 14. Since 14 can be factored into \\(1 \\times 14\\) and \\(-1 \\times -14\\), the possible integer roots are \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), and \\(\\pm14\\). Okay, so I'll test each of these numbers in the equation to see if any of them satisfy it.\n\nStarting with \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[\n1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0\n\\]\nWow, that worked! So, 1 is an integer root.\n\nNext, \\(x = -1\\):\n\\[\n(-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14 = -8\n\\]\nNot zero, so -1 is not a root.\n\nHow about \\(x = 2\\):\n\\[\n2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14 = 76\n\\]\nThat's way too big, so 2 isn't a root.\n\nLet's try \\(x = -2\\):\n\\[\n(-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2"

So, -2 is another integer root.\n\nMoving on to \\(x = 7\\):\nThis seems like a big number. Let me compute step by step:\n\\[\n7^4 = 2401\n5 \\times 7^3 = 5 \\times 343 = 1715\n9 \\times 7^2 = 9 \\times 49 = 441\nThen, -7 -14 = -21\nAdding them up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116; 4116 + 441 = 4557; 4557 -21 = 4536\nThat's way too large, so 7 isn't a root.\n\nWhat about \\(x = -7\\):\nCalculating each term:\n\\[\n(-7)^4 = 2401\n5 \\times (-7)^3 = 5 \\times (-343) = -1715\n9 \\times (-7)^2 = 9 \\times 49 = 441\n-(-7) = 7\n-14 stays as is.\n\nAdding them up: 2401 - 1715 = 686; 686 + 441 = 1127; 1127 +7 = 1134; 1134 -14 = 1120\nNot zero, so -7 isn't a root.\n\nNow, checking \\(x =14\\):\nThat's going to be a huge number. Let me calculate:\n14^4 is 14*14*14*14. 14^2 is 196, so 14^4 is 196^2, which is 38,416.\n5*14^3 = 5*2744 = 13,720\n9*14^2 = 9*196 = 1,764\n-14 -14 = -28\nAdding them up: 38,416 + 13,720 = 52,136; 52,136 + 1,764 = 53,900; 53,900 -28 = 53,872\nWay too big, so 14 isn't a root.\n\nLastly, \\(x = -14\\):\nAgain, a massive number:\n(-14)^4 = 38,416\n5*(-"
