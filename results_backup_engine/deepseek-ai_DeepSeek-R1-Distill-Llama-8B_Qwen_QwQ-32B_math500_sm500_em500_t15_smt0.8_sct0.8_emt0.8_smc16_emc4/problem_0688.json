Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I recall that the area of a triangle can be expressed using several formulas. One common formula is (1/2)*base*height, but since we're dealing with sides a, b, c, maybe the formula involving sine of an angle would be more useful here. Specifically, the area can also be written as (1/2)*b*c*sin A, where A is the angle opposite side a. So, that's one expression for the area.\n\nGiven that the area is a² - (b - c)², I can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = a² - (b - c)².\n\nNow, let's simplify the right-hand side. Expanding (b - c)² gives b² - 2bc + c². So, a² - (b² - 2bc + c²) becomes a² - b² + 2bc - c². Hmm, that simplifies to a² - b² - c² + 2bc. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can relate this to the Law of Cosines? Because the Law of Cosines relates the sides of a triangle with one of its angles.\n\nThe Law of Cosines says that a² = b² + c² - 2bc*cos A. Let's write that down:\n\na² = b² + c² - 2bc*cos A.\n\nSo, if I rearrange this, I get a² - b² - c² = -2bc*cos A. That looks interesting because in the area expression, I have a² - b² - c² + 2bc. Let me plug the Law of Cosines result into that.\n\nFrom the area equation:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = a² - (b - c)²\n= a² - (b² - 2bc + c²)\n= a² - b² - c² + 2bc\n= (a² - b² - c²) + 2bc.\n\nBut from the Law of Cosines, a"

So substituting that in:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = (-2bc*cos A) + 2bc.\n\nHmm, let's factor out 2bc on the right-hand side:\n\n= 2bc*(-cos A + 1)\n= 2bc*(1 - cos A).\n\nSo now we have:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 2bc*(1 - cos A).\n\nHmm, let me write that as:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 2bc*(1 - cos A).\n\nI can divide both sides by bc to simplify, assuming bc ≠ 0, which they aren't because they're sides of a triangle.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by bc:\n\n(1/2)*sin A = 2*(1 - cos A).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nsin A = 4*(1 - cos A).\n\nSo, sin A = 4 - 4cos A.\n\nHmm, this is an equation with sin A and cos A. Maybe I can use the identity sin² A + cos² A = 1 to solve for A. Let's see.\n\nLet me write sin A = 4 - 4cos A.\n\nFirst, let's express sin A in terms of cos A. That's already done. Maybe I can write sin A = 4(1 - cos A).\n\nThen, using the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin² A + cos² A = 1.\n\nSubstitute sin A = 4(1 - cos A):\n\n[4(1 - cos A)]² + cos² A = 1.\n\nLet's expand that:\n\n16*(1 - 2cos A + cos² A) + cos² A = 1.\n\nMultiplying through:\n\n16 - 32cos A + 16cos² A + cos² A = 1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n16 - 32cos A + (16cos² A + cos² A) = 1\n16 - 32cos A + 17cos² A = 1.\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n15 - 32cos A + 17cos² A = 0.\n\nSo, this is a quadratic equation in terms of cos A.

The quadratic formula is x = [32 ± sqrt(32² - 4*17*15)] / (2*17).\n\nCalculating discriminant D:\n\nD = 32² - 4*17*15\n= 1024 - 1020\n= 4.\n\nSo, sqrt(D) = 2.\n\nThus, x = [32 ± 2]/34.\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\nx = (32 + 2)/34 = 34/34 = 1,\nand x = (32 - 2)/34 = 30/34 = 15/17.\n\nSo, cos A = 1 or cos A = 15/17.\n\nBut cos A = 1 would imply that angle A is 0 degrees, which isn't possible in a triangle because all angles must be greater than 0 and less than 180. So, cos A must be 15/17.\n\nTherefore, cos A = 15/17.\n\nNow, to find tan A, which is sin A / cos A.\n\nWe already have sin A from earlier:\n\nsin A = 4 - 4cos A\n= 4 - 4*(15/17)\n= 4 - 60/17\n= (68/17 - 60/17)\n= 8/17.\n\nSo, sin A = 8/17, cos A = 15/17.\n\nThus, tan A = sin A / cos A = (8/17) / (15/17) = 8/15.\n\nSo, tan A = 8/15.\n\nLet me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the area formula: (1/2)bc sin A = a² - (b - c)^2.\n\nExpanding (b - c)^2, subtracting from a² gives a² - b² - c² + 2bc.\n\nThen, using the Law of Cosines: a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A, so a² - b² - c² = -2bc cos A. Substituting that gives -2bc cos A + 2bc = 2bc(1 - cos A).\n\nSetting equal to the area expression: (1"

Solving quadratic, discriminant was 4, leading to cos A = 1 or 15/17. Discarding cos A = 1, so cos A = 15/17.\n\nThen, sin A = 4 - 4*(15/17) = 8/17.
