Since the denominator has both 2s and 5s raised to different powers, I should make the exponents equal to ensure the fraction can be expressed as a power of 10 in the denominator.\n\nTo balance the exponents, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^5\\) to increase the power of 2 to match the power of 5. This gives the denominator as \\(10^7\\).\n\nAfter balancing, the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{21 \\cdot 2^5}{10^7}\\). Calculating \\(21 \\cdot 2^5\\) results in 21 multiplied by 32, which equals 672.\n\nFinally, I divide 672 by 10,000,000 to convert the fraction to its decimal form. This gives the terminating decimal 0.0000672.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Prime Factors:**\n   - The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).\n   - For a fraction to have a terminating decimal, the denominator must be of the form \\(10^n = 2^n \\cdot 5^n\\).\n\n2. **Balance the Exponents:**\n   - **Multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^5\\):**\n     - This changes the denominator to \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\cdot 2^5 = 2^{2+5} \\cdot 5^7 = 2^7 \\cdot 5^7 = 10^7\\).\n     - The numerator becomes \\(21 \\cdot 2^5 = 21 \\cdot 32 = 672\\).\n\n3. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   - Now, the fraction is \\(\\frac{672}{10^7}\\).\n   - Dividing by \\(10^7\\) moves the decimal point seven places to the left:\n     - \\(672 \\div 10^7 = 0.0000672\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0000672}\n\\]"
