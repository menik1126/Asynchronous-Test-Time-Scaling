Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest possible number that can divide both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\nLet me denote the two expressions as \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). So, the problem becomes finding \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\). I also remember the Euclidean algorithm, which is a method to find the gcd of two numbers. It involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then taking the remainder, repeating the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.\n\nLet me try applying the Euclidean algorithm here. So, first, I need to compute \\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) \\).\n\nTo do that, I can express \\( 2n + 1 \\) in terms of \\( n + 7 \\). Let me see: if I have \\( 2n + 1 \\), I can write it as \\( 2(n + 7) - 13 \\). Let me check that:\n\n\\( 2(n + 7) = 2n + 14 \\), so subtracting 13 gives \\( 2n + 14 - 13 = 2n + 1 \\). Perfect, so \\( 2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13 \\).\n\nSo, now I can write \\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) \\) as \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1 - 2(n + 7)) \\). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the Euclidean algorithm states that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b) \\). So, if I take \\( a = 2n + 1 \\) and \\( b = n + 7 \\), then I can divide \\( 2n"

How many times does \\( n + 7 \\) go into \\( 2n + 1 \\)?\n\nWell, if I multiply \\( n + 7 \\) by 2, I get \\( 2n + 14 \\), which is more than \\( 2n + 1 \\). So, maybe 1 time? Wait, no, 1 times \\( n + 7 \\) is \\( n + 7 \\). So, subtracting \\( n + 7 \\) from \\( 2n + 1 \\), the remainder is \\( (2n + 1) - (n + 7) = n - 6 \\).\n\nSo, the remainder is \\( n - 6 \\). Therefore, \\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = \\gcd(n + 7, n - 6) \\).\n\nAlright, now I have to find \\( \\gcd(n + 7, n - 6) \\). Let me apply the Euclidean algorithm again.\n\nSo now, \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = n - 6 \\). Let's compute \\( a - b \\): \\( (n + 7) - (n - 6) = n + 7 - n + 6 = 13 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, n - 6) = \\gcd(n - 6, 13) \\).\n\nHmm, okay, so now the gcd reduces to \\( \\gcd(n - 6, 13) \\). Since 13 is a prime number, the possible divisors are 1 and 13.\n\nTherefore, the gcd can either be 1 or 13. So, the greatest possible value is 13, provided that 13 divides \\( n - 6 \\).\n\nSo, to have \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13 \\), we need that 13 divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( n - 6 \\).\n\nWait, actually, no. From the previous step, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, n - 6) \\) is equal to \\( \\gcd(n - "

So, if 13 divides \\( n - 6 \\), then the gcd is 13; otherwise, it's 1.\n\nSo, to get the maximum possible gcd, which is 13, we need \\( 13 \\) to divide \\( n - 6 \\). That is, \\( n - 6 \\) must be a multiple of 13. So, \\( n = 13k + 6 \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nBut wait, since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( k \\) must be chosen such that \\( n > 0 \\). The smallest \\( k \\) can be is 0, which would make \\( n = 6 \\). Let me check if \\( n = 6 \\) works.\n\nIf \\( n = 6 \\), then \\( n + 7 = 13 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 13 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\). That works.\n\nWait, but let me check another value to make sure. Let's take \\( k = 1 \\), so \\( n = 13 + 6 = 19 \\).\n\nThen, \\( n + 7 = 26 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 39 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(26, 39) \\). 26 divides into 39 once with remainder 13. Then \\( \\gcd(26, 13) = 13 \\). So, again, the gcd is 13. Perfect.\n\nSo, it seems that as long as \\( n = 13k + 6 \\), the gcd is 13. If \\( n \\) is not of this form, the gcd is 1.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is 13.\n\nWait, hold on, just to make sure I haven't missed any other possible divisors. Since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13. So, 13 is indeed the maximum.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to express the gcd as \\( d \\), so \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). Therefore, \\( d \\) divides any linear combination of them.\n\n"

The maximum possible gcd is 13.\n\nThus, after all these steps, I'm confident that the answer is 13.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is achieved when \\( 13 \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).
