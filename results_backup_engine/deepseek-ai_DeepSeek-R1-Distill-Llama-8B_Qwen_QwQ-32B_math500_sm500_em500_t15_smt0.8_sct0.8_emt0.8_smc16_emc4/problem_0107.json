            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers, C and D. The equation given is a partial fraction decomposition:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. First, I remember that partial fractions are used to break down complicated rational expressions into simpler ones. The denominator on the right side is a quadratic, so I should factor that to see if it can be broken down into linear factors.\n\nLet me try factoring \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let's see... 8 and -3? Because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. Yes, that works. So, the denominator factors into (x + 8)(x - 3). That makes sense because the denominators on the left side are also (x - 3) and (x + 8). So, this checks out.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find C and D, I think I can combine the left side over the common denominator and then equate the numerators. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's write the left side with the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, since the denominators are the same, I can set the numerators equal:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nOkay, so that simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to collect like terms. Let's group the terms with x"

That means:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nAlright, so from the first equation, C is 4. Now, plug that into the second equation to solve for D.\n\nSo, plugging C = 4:\n\n8*(4) - 3D = -23\n\nCalculate 8*4: 32\n\nSo:\n\n32 - 3D = -23\n\nNow, let's solve for D.\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-3D = -23 - 32\n\nWhich is:\n\n-3D = -55\n\nNow, divide both sides by -3:\n\nD = (-55)/(-3) = 55/3\n\nWait a minute, that gives D as 55/3, which is not an integer. But the problem says C and D are integers. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting from:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nExpanding gives:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\nC + D = 4 (coefficient of x)\n8C - 3D = -23 (constant term)\n\nWait, previously, I thought the coefficient of x was C, but now I see it's actually C + D. I think I missed that in my initial step. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, here's the correct system of equations:\n\n1. C + D = 4\n2. 8C - 3D = -23\n\nAlright, so now I have two equations:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow,"

From Equation 1, I can express C as:\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 2:\n\n8*(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nCalculate 8*(4 - D):\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nNow, let's subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nGreat, so D is 5. Now, substitute back into Equation 1 to find C.\n\nC + 5 = 4\n\nSo, C = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nAh, so C is -1 and D is 5. Both are integers. That makes sense now. I must have made a mistake earlier by not combining C and D when equating coefficients.\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Now, the problem asks for the product CD.\n\nCD = (-1) * 5 = -5\n\nWait, so the product is -5. Let me just double-check my equations.\n\nGiven:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nWith C = -1 and D = 5, plug them in:\n\n-1*(x + 8) + 5*(x - 3) = -x - 8 + 5x -15 = ( -x + 5x ) + ( -8 -15 ) = 4x -23\n\nYes, that's correct. So, it works.\n\nTherefore, the product CD is (-1)*5 = -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the product \\(CD\\) of the integers \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) for which\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nwe start by factoring the denominator on the right side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x - 24 = (x - 3)(x + 8)\n\\]\n\nThus"
