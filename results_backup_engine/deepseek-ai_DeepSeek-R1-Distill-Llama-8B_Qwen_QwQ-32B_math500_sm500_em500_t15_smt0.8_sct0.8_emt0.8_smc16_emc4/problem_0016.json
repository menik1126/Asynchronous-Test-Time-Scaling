            "output": "To find the absolute value of (1 - i) raised to the 8th power, I'll start by expressing the complex number in polar form. The complex number 1 - i has a magnitude of √(1² + (-1)²) = √2 and an angle of -45 degrees or 315 degrees.\n\nNext, raising a complex number to a power involves raising both its magnitude and angle to that power. So, (√2)^8 equals (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16.\n\nFor the angle, multiplying -45 degrees by 8 gives -360 degrees, which is equivalent to 0 degrees after accounting for full rotations.\n\nFinally, taking the absolute value of the resulting complex number, which is now 16(cos(0) + i sin(0)) = 16(1 + 0i), results in |(1 - i)^8| = 16.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the complex number to polar form**:\n   - **Magnitude**: \\( |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n   - **Angle**: \\( \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-1}{1}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians\n\n2. **Raise the complex number to the 8th power using De Moivre's Theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (1 - i)^8 = \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\right)^8 \\left( \\cos\\left(8 \\times \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right) + i \\sin\\left(8 \\times \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right) \\right)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify the calculations**:\n   - \\( \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\right)^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16 \\)\n   - \\( 8 \\times \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = -2\\pi \\)\n   - \\( \\cos(-2\\pi) = 1 \\) and \\( \\sin(-2\\pi) = 0 \\)\n\n4. **Calculate"
