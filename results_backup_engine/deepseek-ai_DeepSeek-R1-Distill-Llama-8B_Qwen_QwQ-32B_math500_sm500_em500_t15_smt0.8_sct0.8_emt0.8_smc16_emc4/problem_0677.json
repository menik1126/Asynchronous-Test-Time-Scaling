This means that the number of players, x, must be a divisor of 54.\n\nNext, I list all the divisors of 54. Starting from 1 up, I find that the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, and 54.\n\nSince the problem states that each player must receive at least 5 cards, I need to identify which of these divisors result in y being at least 5. For each divisor x, I calculate y by dividing 54 by x.\n\nI start with x=2, which gives y=27. Both 2 and 27 satisfy the conditions.\n\nFor x=3, y=18, both of which are acceptable.\n\nWhen x=6, y=9, which still meets the requirement.\n\nWith x=9, y=6. Here, y=6 is still at least 5, so this is valid.\n\nFor x=18, y=3. However, y=3 is less than 5, so this doesn't meet the criteria.\n\nFinally, x=54 would result in y=1, which is also less than 5.\n\nBased on this analysis, the valid values of x that satisfy both conditions are 2, 3, 6, and 9. Therefore, there are 4 possible values of x.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\) (the number of players), we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Total Cards**: There are \\( 54 \\) cards in total.\n2. **Distribution**: Each player receives \\( y \\) cards, where \\( y \\) is at least \\( 5 \\).\n3. **Players and Cards**: The number of players \\( x \\) must be a divisor of \\( 54 \\) because \\( 54 \\) cards must be evenly distributed.\n\nLet's find all divisors of \\( 54 \\) and then check which ones satisfy \\( y \\geq 5 \\):\n\n- **Divisors of 54**: \\( 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 54 \\)\n\n- **Check Each Divisor**:\n  \n  - \\( x = 1 \\): \\( y = \\frac{54}{1} = 54 \\)"
