Let me break this down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of complex numbers and transformations.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given:\n\nz = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i  \nc = 2 - 3i\n\nI need to find w, which is z rotated around c by π/4. Hmm, rotating a point around another point isn't as straightforward as just multiplying by e^(iθ) because that usually rotates around the origin. So, I think I need to translate the system so that c becomes the origin, rotate, and then translate back. That sounds right.\n\nLet me recall the steps for rotation in the complex plane. If I have a point z and I want to rotate it around another point c by an angle θ, I can do the following:\n\n1. Translate z by subtracting c: z - c. This moves the center of rotation to the origin.\n2. Multiply by e^(iθ) to rotate the translated point. Since the rotation is counter-clockwise, the angle is positive.\n3. Translate back by adding c: (z - c) * e^(iθ) + c.\n\nOkay, let me apply that here. First, I need to compute z - c. Let me write z and c as complex numbers.\n\nz = (2 + √2) + (-3 - 3√2)i  \nc = 2 + (-3)i\n\nSo subtracting c from z (z - c):\n\nz - c = [ (2 + √2) - 2 ] + [ (-3 - 3√2)i - (-3)i ]  \n= (√2) + (-3√2 i)\n\nSo, z - c = √2 - 3√2 i\n\nHmm, that's nice. So now, I have a new complex number: √2 - 3√2 i. Let me write that as √2(1 - 3i). That might make calculations easier later.\n\nNext step: multiply by e^(iπ/4). I remember that e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. So for θ = π/4, that's cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4). The values of these are"

So I need A * B.\n\nMultiplying these:\n\nA * B = √2(1 - 3i) * (√2/2 + i√2/2)\n\nLet me compute the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, distribute √2:\n\n= √2 * (√2/2)(1 - 3i) + √2 * (i√2/2)(1 - 3i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: √2 * √2/2 = (2)/2 = 1. So 1*(1 - 3i) = 1 - 3i.\n\nSecond term: √2 * i√2/2. Let's compute √2 * √2 first: that's 2. So 2*i/2 = i. So the second term is i*(1 - 3i).\n\nWait, actually, hold on: The second term is √2 multiplied by i√2/2, which is (√2 * √2)/2 * i = (2)/2 * i = 1 * i = i. Then, it's multiplied by (1 - 3i). So i*(1 - 3i) = i - 3i². Since i² = -1, that becomes i + 3.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst term: 1 - 3i  \nSecond term: i + 3  \nSo adding them together:\n\n(1 + 3) + (-3i + i)  \n= 4 - 2i\n\nSo A * B = 4 - 2i. So, (z - c) * e^(iπ/4) = 4 - 2i.\n\nNow, the next step is to add back c to this result to get w. So:\n\nw = (z - c) * e^(iπ/4) + c  \n= (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i)  \n= (4 + 2) + (-"

So yes, w should be 6 - 5i.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my multiplication earlier. Let me go back to A * B:\n\nA was √2(1 - 3i) = √2 - 3√2 i  \nB was √2/2 + i√2/2  \nMultiplying them:  \n(√2)(√2/2) + √2*(i√2/2) + (-3√2 i)(√2/2) + (-3√2 i)(i√2/2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (√2)(√2)/2 = (2)/2 = 1  \nSecond term: (√2)(i√2)/2 = (2i)/2 = i  \nThird term: (-3√2 i)(√2)/2 = (-3*2 i)/2 = -3i  \nFourth term: (-3√2 i)(i√2)/2 = (-3*2 i²)/2 = (-6)(-1)/2 = 3\n\nSo altogether:\n\n1 + i - 3i + 3  \n= (1 + 3) + (i - 3i)  \n= 4 - 2i\n\nYes, that matches what I had before. So (z - c)*e^(iπ/4) = 4 - 2i.\n\nAdding c (2 - 3i), we have:\n\n4 + 2 = 6  \n-2i -3i = -5i\n\nSo w = 6 - 5i.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me think if there's another way to check this. Maybe by converting to vectors and using rotation matrices?\n\nLet's consider z and c as points in the plane. So, if I represent z as a point (x, y) and c as (a, b), then the rotation can be done using the rotation matrix.\n\nGiven a point (x, y) rotated around (a, b) by θ, the new point (x', y') is given"
