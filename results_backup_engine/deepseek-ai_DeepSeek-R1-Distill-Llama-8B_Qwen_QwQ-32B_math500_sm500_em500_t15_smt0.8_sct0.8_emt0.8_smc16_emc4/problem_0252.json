The denominator here is 11111.\n\nTo find the order of 10 modulo 11111, I first need to factorize 11111. I start by checking if it's divisible by smaller primes:\n\n11111 ÷ 11 = 1010.09... It's not a whole number, so 11 is not a factor.\n\nNext, I check 11111 ÷ 41 = 271.0, which is a whole number. So, 41 is a factor.\n\nFinally, I factorize 271 and find that it's a prime number.\n\nNow, with the prime factors identified as \\( 41 \\times 271 \\), I can determine the length of the repeating decimal by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of 10 modulo each prime factor.\n\nFor 41, the order of 10 modulo 41 is 6.\n\nFor 271, the order of 10 modulo 271 is 5.\n\nThe LCM of 6 and 5 is 30.\n\nTherefore, the repeating decimal has a cycle length of 30 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the repeating decimal of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize the Denominator**:\n   - First, factorize the denominator \\( 11111 \\):\n     \\[\n     11111 = 41 \\times 271\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( 41 \\) and \\( 271 \\) are prime numbers.\n\n2. **Find the Order of 10 Modulo Each Prime Factor**:\n   - For the prime factor \\( 41 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Order of } 10 \\mod 41 = 6\n     \\]\n   - For the prime factor \\( 271 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Order of } 10 \\mod 271 = 5\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Determine the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:\n   - The length of the repeating decimal is the LCM of the orders found:\n     \\[\n     \\text{LCM}(6, 5) = 30\n"
