This can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), which gives us C(7, 3) = 35 possible combinations.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 4 available. Applying the same combination formula, C(4, 2) = 6 possible combinations.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to select both 3 boys and 2 girls, I'll multiply the number of combinations for boys by the number of combinations for girls, which is 35 * 6 = 210.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can select 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   The number of combinations of 7 boys taken 3 at a time is given by the binomial coefficient \\( C(7, 3) \\).\n\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \n   Similarly, the number of combinations of 4 girls taken 2 at a time is \\( C(4, 2) \\).\n\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the total number of ways to select 3 boys and 2 girls:**\n   \n   Since the selections are independent, we multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = C(7, 3) \\times C(4, 2) = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
