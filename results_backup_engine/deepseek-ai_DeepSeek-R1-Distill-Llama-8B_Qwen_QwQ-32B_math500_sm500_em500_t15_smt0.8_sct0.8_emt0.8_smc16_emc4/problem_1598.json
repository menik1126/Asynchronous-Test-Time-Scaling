Hmm, let me start by trying to simplify or factor the equation to find the roots. \n\nFirst, I notice that all the terms are cubic, so maybe expanding them will help. But expanding each term might be time-consuming and could lead to a lot of terms. Let me see if there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nWait, I remember that there's a formula for \\(a^3 + b^3\\). It's \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\). Maybe I can apply that here. So, let me set \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). Then the left side becomes \\(a^3 + b^3\\), which factors into \\((a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\).\n\nLet me compute \\(a + b\\):\n\\[\na + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\n\\]\nOh, interesting! That's the same as the right side of the equation, \\(2x - 10\\). So the equation now becomes:\n\\[\n(2x - 10)\\left[(a)^2 - ab + (b)^2\\right] = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\nHmm, I can factor out \\(2x - 10\\) from both sides. Let me rewrite it:\n\\[\n(2x - 10)\\left[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2\\right] = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\nSo, if I move everything to one side, I get:\n\\[\n(2x - 10)\\left[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2\\right] - (2x - 10)^3 = 0\n\\]\nFactor out \\(2x - 10\\):\n\\[\n(2x - 10)\\left[ (x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7"

Let's start with the simple one. \n\nFirst solution:\n\\[\n2x - 10 = 0 \\implies 2x = 10 \\implies x = 5\n\\]\nOkay, so x = 5 is one root.\n\nNow, let's work on the other factor:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 - (2x - 10)^2 = 0\n\\]\nI'll need to expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((x - 3)^2\\):\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\n\\]\nNext, expand \\((x - 3)(x - 7)\\):\n\\[\n(x - 3)(x - 7) = x^2 - 10x + 21\n\\]\nThen, expand \\((x - 7)^2\\):\n\\[\n(x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49\n\\]\nAnd finally, expand \\((2x - 10)^2\\):\n\\[\n(2x - 10)^2 = 4x^2 - 40x + 100\n\\]\nNow, substitute these back into the equation:\n\\[\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49) - (4x^2 - 40x + 100) = 0\n\\]\nLet me simplify term by term:\n1. The first term is \\(x^2 - 6x + 9\\).\n2. Subtract the second term: \\(-(x^2 - 10x + 21) = -x^2 + 10x - 21\\).\n3. Add the third term: \\(x^2 - 14x + 49\\).\n4.

First, check if there are any common factors among the coefficients 4, 30, 63. The greatest common divisor is 1, so I can't factor it easily.

Hmm, but I'm supposed to find all roots, but the problem doesn't specify real or complex. So maybe the other roots are complex.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the equation factors to:\n(x -3)(x -7) = 0\n\nThus, the solutions are x =3 and x =7.\n\nWait a minute, so earlier, I made a mistake in the expansion, which led me to a wrong quadratic equation with a negative discriminant.

The right side is (2x-10)^3, which is also a cubic. So the equation is a cubic equals another cubic, so when subtracted, it's a cubic equation. So total degree 3, so up to three roots, which we have here. So that makes sense.\n\nBut why did I get confused earlier? Because I made an arithmetic mistake in expanding the terms.
