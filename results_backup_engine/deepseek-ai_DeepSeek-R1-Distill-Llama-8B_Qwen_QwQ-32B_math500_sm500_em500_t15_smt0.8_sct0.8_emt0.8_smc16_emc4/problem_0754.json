It's about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers with some specific properties related to geometric and arithmetic sequences. The goal is to find \\( a_1 \\) given that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\). Hmm, okay, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. We have a sequence \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots \\) where each term is a positive integer, and the sequence is strictly increasing. That means \\( a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \\ldots \\). \n\nThe problem says that for every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric. A geometric sequence has the property that each term is a multiple of the previous one by a common ratio. So, this means \\( \\frac{a_{2k}}{a_{2k-1}} = \\frac{a_{2k+1}}{a_{2k}} \\). Let's denote this common ratio as \\( r_k \\). Therefore, \\( a_{2k} = r_k \\cdot a_{2k-1} \\) and \\( a_{2k+1} = r_k \\cdot a_{2k} = r_k^2 \\cdot a_{2k-1} \\).\n\nAdditionally, for the same \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is arithmetic. An arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms, so \\( a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1} \\). Let's denote this common difference as \\( d_k \\). Therefore, \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k \\) and \\( a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k = a_{2k} + 2d_k \\).\n\nOur task is to find \\( a_1 \\) given that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\). So, let's start by understanding the structure of the sequence.\n\nSince the properties hold"
