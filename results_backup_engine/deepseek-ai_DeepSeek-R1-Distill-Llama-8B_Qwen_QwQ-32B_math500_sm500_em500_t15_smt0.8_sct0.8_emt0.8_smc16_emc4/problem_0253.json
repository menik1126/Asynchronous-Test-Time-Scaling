            "output": "To convert the fraction \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) to a decimal, I can start by understanding the denominator. The number 11111 is known as a repunit, which is a number consisting entirely of 1's.\n\nNext, I recognize that 11111 can be factored as \\( 11 \\times 101 \\). This factorization will help determine the length of the repeating period in the decimal representation.\n\nSince the denominator factors into 11 and 101, both of which are prime numbers, the length of the repeating cycle is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of 10 modulo these primes. The order of 10 modulo 11 is 2, and the order of 10 modulo 101 is 4. The LCM of 2 and 4 is 4, which means the repeating cycle has a length of 4 digits.\n\nTherefore, the repeating decimal of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) has a repeating cycle of 4 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is \\( 11111 \\), which is a repunit (a number consisting entirely of 1's).\n   - It can be factored into prime numbers: \\( 11111 = 11 \\times 101 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Order of 10 Modulo the Prime Factors:**\n   - **For \\( p = 11 \\):**\n     - The order of 10 modulo 11 is the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod 11 \\).\n     - Calculating powers of 10:\n       - \\( 10^1 \\equiv 10 \\mod 11 \\)\n       - \\( 10^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 11 \\)\n     - So, the order is **2**.\n   \n   - **For \\( p = 101 \\):**\n     - The order of 10 modulo 101 is the smallest positive integer \\( m \\) such that \\( 10^m \\equiv 1 \\mod 101 \\).\n     - Calculating powers of 10:\n       - \\( 10^1 \\equiv 10 \\mod 101 \\)\n       - \\( 10"
