This means we have eight distinct seats in total.\n\nSince the arrangement is around a square table, rotational symmetry can create identical configurations. Therefore, we should fix the position of one person to eliminate rotational duplicates.\n\nNext, after fixing one person's position, we'll arrange the remaining seven individuals. This is because fixing one person's seat effectively removes the variable of rotational symmetry from our calculations.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange 7 people in 7 seats is calculated using permutations, which is 7 factorial (7!). This accounts for all possible distinct placements of the remaining individuals.\n\nFinally, considering that each side of the table can be rotated, we need to account for reflections. However, in this problem, reflections are considered distinct because two configurations that are mirror images of each other are not considered equivalent unless one is a direct rotation of the other. Since we've already fixed one person's position, reflections are treated as separate arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is 7!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix a Position:**  \n   Since the table is square and rotations are considered equivalent, we can fix the position of one person. This eliminates rotational symmetry from our calculations.\n\n2. **Arrange the Remaining People:**  \n   With one person's position fixed, we now need to arrange the remaining 7 people in the remaining 7 seats.  \n   - The number of ways to arrange 7 people in 7 seats is \\(7!\\).\n\n3. **Consider Reflections:**  \n   Although reflections can create similar configurations, in this problem, two configurations that are mirror images of each other are not considered equivalent because reflections aren't considered the same unless one is a direct rotation of the other. Since we've fixed one person's position, reflections are treated as distinct arrangements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{7!}"

Fixing one person's position accounts for rotational symmetry, so the remaining 7 can be arranged freely. Thus, the correct count is indeed \\(7!\\), which is 5040.  \n\n\\boxed{5040}"
