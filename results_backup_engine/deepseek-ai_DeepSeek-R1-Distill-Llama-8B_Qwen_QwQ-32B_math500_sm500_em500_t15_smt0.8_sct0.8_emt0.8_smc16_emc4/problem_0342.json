I can't switch additions to multiplications or anything like that. \n\nFirst, let me write down the original expression to get a sense of what we're dealing with: \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\). Without any parentheses, the expression is evaluated from left to right with the given operations. Let me compute that to see what the default value is. \n\nSo, starting from the left:\n1 + 2 = 3\n3 + 3 = 6\n6 - 4 = 2\n2 + 5 = 7\n7 + 6 = 13\nOkay, that's the original value, 13. The example given in the problem changes the value by adding parentheses differently, like \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6\\), which results in 3. That's way lower, so parentheses can definitely change the outcome significantly.\n\nMy goal is to find the placement of parentheses that gives the smallest possible value. I have to think about how parentheses affect the operations. Since there are both addition and subtraction operations, parentheses can group numbers and operations in a way that changes the order of execution, possibly leading to negative numbers or larger subtractions, thus minimizing the total result.\n\nLet me list all the possible places I can add parentheses. But wait, the expression has six terms: 1, 2, 3, -4, 5, 6. So the operations between them are five: +, +, -, +, +. So, we can think of the expression as a combination of these operations and the numbers.\n\nWhen adding parentheses, I have to decide where to group these numbers and operations. Each set of parentheses can cover consecutive operations and numbers. So, the strategy is to figure out which groups can be made negative or positive in a way that reduces the total sum the most.\n\nOne approach is to identify which numbers can be part of a sub-expression that, when subtracted, will have the maximum impact. For example, grouping 4, 5 into \\(4 + 5\\) gives 9, which when subtracted as in"

But maybe there's a way to subtract a larger number?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps grouping terms before a subtraction to make the subtraction as large as possible. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note that subtraction is the same as adding a negative. So, the original expression can be written as \\(1 + 2 + 3 + (-4) + 5 + 6\\). But parentheses can group terms in a way that might flip the sign of a larger number.\n\nWait, but parentheses can only group terms in the existing order. So, for instance, if I can group terms before a subtraction to make the subtraction of a larger value, that would help. Let me try different groupings.\n\nLet me consider all possible ways to place parentheses. Since the problem is about the minimum value, I need to look for groupings that maximize the negative contributions. Let me try different groupings step by step.\n\nFirst, let's see the example given: \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6\\). That gives 3. Let me see if I can make it even smaller.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe group the 4 with the following terms to subtract a larger number. For instance, if I can make the expression subtract a larger group. Let's see.\n\nSuppose I group the first few terms and then subtract a larger group. Let me try different possibilities.\n\nOption 1: Group the first three terms as (1 + 2 + 3), then subtract (4 + 5 + 6). Wait, but the original expression has a minus before 4, so actually, the original is 1+2+3 -4 +5+6. So if I want to subtract a larger group, I need to see where the minus is.\n\nWait, the minus is only before the 4. So the structure is:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\n\nSo the minus is only between the 3 and the 4. So any parentheses added must respect that structure. So, for example, if I want to group terms after the minus, like (4 +5 +6), but since the minus is before the 4, that would be - (4 +5 +6). Let me see.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf I do 1 + 2 + 3 - (4"

Let me check.\n\nIn the original expression, the operations are between the numbers: 1+2+3-4+5+6. So, the only subtraction is between 3 and 4. So, can I extend that subtraction beyond 4 to include more terms?\n\nWait, no. Because the original expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. So the minus is only between 3 and 4. If I want to group 4 with the following terms, I have to enclose it with parentheses and subtract the whole thing. But the original expression doesn't have a minus before 5 and 6, only before 4. So in the expression as given, the only subtraction is between 3 and 4.\n\nThus, if I have 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 +5 +6), is that allowed? Because in the original, the 4 is subtracted, but 5 and 6 are added. So, to group 4 +5 +6, I would need to have (4 +5 +6). But since that part is added, grouping them would result in \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 +5 +6)\\) which is 1 + 2 + 3 - 15 = 6 -15 = -9. Is this a valid placement? The problem says we cannot change addition to multiplication, but we can add parentheses as long as it's in the order of the terms.\n\nYes, because we are just grouping terms that are already consecutive, so that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can make the negative sign apply to more positive terms, thus reducing the overall value further.\n\nWait, let me see: If I group 4 +5 as (4 +5), then 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5) +6 =1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3.\n\nBut if I group 4 +5 +6 as above, it's -15, which is worse.\n\nIs that correct?

So if I group (4 +5 +6), then the expression becomes 1+2+3 - (4+5+6). But the original has a plus 5 and plus 6 after the minus 4. So, if I group 4+5+6, then the minus applies to the entire group, so the plus 5 and plus 6 would be subtracted as well. That would effectively turn the original \"+5 +6\" into \"-5 -6\", which is allowed by parentheses? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, because parentheses can override the order of operations. So, the expression would be:\n\nOriginal: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\n\nIf we add parentheses as 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6), then the operations inside the parentheses are done first, so 4+5+6=15, then subtract that from the previous sum. So the total is (1+2+3) - (4+5+6) = 6 - 15 = -9. Then, but wait, the original has a +5 and +6 after the -4. So in the original, the operations after the -4 are +5 and +6. But by grouping (4+5+6), we are effectively making the -4 apply to the entire group, so the +5 and +6 become part of the subtracted term. That's allowed because parentheses can group those terms together, and the subtraction applies to the entire group. So that's a valid placement. So that gives -9, which is better (smaller) than the example's 3.\n\nHmm, so maybe that's a better candidate. Let me see if I can go even lower.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe group terms before the minus to subtract a larger value. Wait, but the minus is only before the 4.

The different ways of parenthesizing correspond to different binary trees. But perhaps it's too complicated to think in terms of trees.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of changing the grouping around the minus sign.

Not helpful.\n\nEarlier case where we did 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6) gives -9. Let me see if that's indeed valid. Let me recast the expression:\n\nOriginal: 1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6\n\nParentheses added: 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 +5 +6)\n\nYes, that's allowed because the parentheses group the 4,5,6 together, and the minus before the 4 applies to the entire group. So the expression becomes (1+2+3) - (4+5+6) = 6 - 15 = -9. That's a valid grouping. So that's a candidate for the minimum.\n\nIs there a way to get even lower?\n\nLet me see. Let's try to see if we can have more terms subtracted. For instance, can we group terms before the minus to subtract a larger value?\n\nWait, the minus is only before the 4. So the only way to subtract more terms is to include the terms after the minus into the subtraction. So, the maximum we can subtract is the entire 4+5+6, which gives -15, leading to -9. Alternatively, maybe group some terms before the minus to subtract a larger value?\n\nWait, the terms before the minus are 1+2+3. If we can somehow make that a negative, but since they are all added, unless we can group them with a subtraction operator before, but there isn't one. The first three terms are all added, so they can't be turned into a subtraction unless we have a minus before them, which we don't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps group the 1+2+3 into a negative?

So, suppose I group 4,5,6 as (4 +5 +6). Then, the expression becomes 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 +5 +6), which is 6 -15 = -9.\n\nAlternatively, if I group 5 +6, then it's 1 +2 +3 -4 + (5 +6)=1+2+3 -4 +11=6 -4=2 +11=13.\n\nThat's back to the original.\n\nAlternatively, group 3 -4, but that's already -1.\n\nWait, maybe if I group more terms.

Since the additions and subtractions are fixed operations, perhaps arranging the parentheses so that the subtracted parts are as large as possible.\n\nThe subtraction operation is only applied to the 4, but through parentheses, we can include more terms after the 4 in the subtraction. Because after the -4, there's +5 and +6. If we can group those into the subtraction.\n\nHence, by grouping 4 +5 +6, as before, making the subtraction apply to all three, thus subtracting 15 instead of just 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to have multiple subtractions? Let me see.\n\nWait, since the expression is from left to right, with the only minus at the fourth term. So the only subtraction is of the 4. So can I have another subtraction operation? The problem states we can't rearrange the order of terms, so the operations are fixed as +, +, -, +, +. So the only subtraction is between 3 and 4.

However, the plus 5 and plus 6 are outside the subtraction's scope unless they're included in parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps in the expression 1 +2 + (3 - (4 +5 +6)), the parentheses are placed such that after the 3, everything up to the end inside the parentheses is evaluated as 3 - (4+5+6). However, the original has a minus between 3 and4, then pluses after that.\n\nSo, effectively, the parentheses would be around 3 -4 +5 +6, but we want it to be 3 - (4+5+6). To do that, the parentheses must override the pluses to turn them into minuses. But that's not allowed because we can't change the addition operators into anything else. The parentheses can only group terms, but the operators between terms inside the parentheses remain as their original operations.\n\nWait, here's the key point: If I have parentheses around 3 -4 +5 +6, the result is evaluated as ( (3 -4) +5 ) +6, which equals (-1 +5) +6 = 10. But if I want it to be 3 - (4 +5 +6), that would require changing the plus between "

Therefore, the subtraction of 4 is separate from the addition of5 and6.\n\nTherefore, the maximum we can subtract is just the 4, unless we group it with the 5 and6. So, the only way to subtract 4 +5 +6 is to group all of them under parentheses and apply the subtraction to the entire group.\n\nTherefore, the correct way is to group the 4 +5 +6 as a subtraction. So the expression becomes 1+2+3 - (4+5+6)=6-15=-9.\n\nYes, that is correct. Therefore, the best possible way to get the minimum is to have 1+2+3 - (4+5+6)= -9.\n\nIs there a way to get lower than -9?

So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, group 1 +2 as 3, then group 3 +3 -4 +5 +6.\n\nWait, but grouping 1+2 is just 3, then 3 +3 -4 is 6-4=2, +5=7, +6=13.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nAnother thought: What if I group the 1 +2 as 3, then group 3 +3 -4 +5 +6.

But all the terms before the minus are positive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps group the 1 +2 as a group subtracted from something else, but since the first operations are +, can't.\n\nAlternatively, group 2 +3 as 5, so 1 + (2+3) -4 +5+6 =1+5=6-4=2+5+6=13. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, let me think of all possibilities systematically. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nThe expression is a sum of terms and subtractions, so the problem reduces to choosing which of the numbers after the minus (the -4 term) to include in the subtraction.\n\nSince the only minus is before the 4, the only way to increase the subtraction's impact is to group the 4 with subsequent terms so that more terms are subtracted.\n\nTherefore, the key is to decide how much of the terms after the 4 can be subtracted.\n\nThe terms after the minus (the -4) are 4, and then +5 and +6.\n\nWait, actually, the 4 is being subtracted, but 5 and6 are being added.

Then, is that all? Because after that, there's nothing else. Wait, no, because in the original expression, after 3 comes -4 +5 +6. So by grouping 4 +5 +6, you are effectively replacing -4 +5 +6 with -(4 +5 +6). So, it's as if you've subtracted 15. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I group from the 3, but that would change the operations. Let me see.\n\nWait, if I group (3 -4 +5 +6).
