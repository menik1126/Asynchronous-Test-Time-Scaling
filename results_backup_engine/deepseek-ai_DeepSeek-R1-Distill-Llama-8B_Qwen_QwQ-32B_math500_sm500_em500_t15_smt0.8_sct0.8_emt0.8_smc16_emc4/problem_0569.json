            "output": "I need to determine the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table, with all members of each party sitting next to each other. The committee consists of 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. \n\nFirst, since the seating is circular, the arrangement is considered the same if the entire group is rotated. This means I can fix the position of one person to eliminate equivalent rotations. \n\nNext, I need to consider the grouping of each party. All Democrats must sit together, all Republicans together, and the Independent also must be in a single block. This effectively means that each group can be thought of as a single \"super member.\" \n\nThere are three groups: Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent. These three groups can be arranged around the table in 3! ways, which is 6.\n\nNow, within each group, the members can be arranged among themselves. The Democrats can be arranged in 5! ways, the Republicans in 5! ways, and the Independent can be arranged in 1! way, since there's only one person.\n\nFinally, I need to multiply the number of arrangements for each group by the number of group arrangements. So, the total number of seating arrangements is 3! multiplied by 5! (Democrats) multiplied by 5! (Republicans) multiplied by 1! (Independent), which equals 6 * 120 * 120 * 1 = 86400.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll break it down into clear steps.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe have a circular table where 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent must sit. All members of each party must sit together. Two seatings are considered the same if one can be rotated to get the other.\n\n**Step 2: Fix One Person's Position to Eliminate Rotations**\nSince the table is circular, we can fix the position of one person to avoid counting rotations as different arrangements. Let's fix the Independent in one seat.\n\n**Step 3: Group the Members**\nNow, we have three distinct groups: \n- 5 Democrats (D) sitting together\n- 5 Republicans (R) sitting together\n- 1 Independent (I) fixed in position\n\n**Step 4: Arrange the Groups**\nSince the groups are distinguishable (Democrats, Republicans, Independent), we can arrange them around the table.\n\nThere are **3!** ways"

However, since the Independent is fixed, the remaining two groups (Democrats and Republicans) can only be arranged in **2!** ways. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-examine this step. \n\n**Revised Step 4: Correct Arrangement of Groups**\nBy fixing the Independent's position, the two other groups (Democrats and Republicans) can be placed either to the left or right of the Independent. This is equivalent to arranging the two groups in a line, so there are **2!** ways to arrange the Democrats and Republicans around the Independent.\n\n**Step 5: Arrange Members Within Each Group**\n- The 5 Democrats can be arranged among themselves in **5!** ways.\n- The 5 Republicans can be arranged among themselves in **5!** ways.\n- The Independent is fixed, so **1!** way.\n\n**Step 6: Multiply All Possibilities**\nTotal arrangements = (Arrangements of groups) × (Arrangements within Democrats) × (Arrangements within Republicans) × (Arrangements within Independent)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\\[\n2! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1! = 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 \\times 1 = 28,800\n\\]\n\nWait, but earlier I thought fixing the Independent reduces the group arrangements to 2! instead of 3!.\n\n**Final Check:**\n- Fixing the Independent's position removes rotational symmetry. The remaining two groups (D and R) can be arranged in 2! ways (either D next to I on the left and R on the right, or vice versa). \n\nYes, this is correct. The initial mistake was considering 3! groups, but since one group (Independent) is fixed, only the other two groups are permuted. \n\nThus, the correct total is **2 × 5! × 5! = 28,800**.\n\n\\boxed{28800}"
