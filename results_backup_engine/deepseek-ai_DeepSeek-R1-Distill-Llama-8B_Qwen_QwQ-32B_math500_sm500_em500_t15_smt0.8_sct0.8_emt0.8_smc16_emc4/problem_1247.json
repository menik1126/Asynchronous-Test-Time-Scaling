            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, I should probably write the equation down clearly to visualize it better. So, I have:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, my goal here is to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. Since there's a square root involved, I might need to square both sides at some point to eliminate it. But before I do that, maybe I should isolate the square root term to make things simpler.\n\nSo, let me subtract 4 from both sides to get:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nThat looks better. Now, I have the square root by itself on one side. To get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. Remember, though, squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll have to check my answers at the end.\n\nLet's square both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2\n\nSimplifying both sides, the square and the square root should cancel each other out:\n\nLeft side: (x - 4)^2\nRight side: 11 - 2x\n\nSo now I have:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nI need to expand the left side. Let me do that carefully:\n\nFirst, expand (x - 4)^2. I know that (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2, so applying that here:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The expansion of (x - 4)^2 should be x squared minus 2 times x times 4 plus 4 squared, so that's x^2 - 8x + 16. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, I have the equation:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nI should bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Let me subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 -"

            "output": " 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplifying the constants and combining like terms:\n\n16 minus 11 is 5. Then, for the x terms: -8x + 2x is -6x.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nAlright, so I have a quadratic equation now. I can try to factor this, or use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it factors nicely.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, factors of 5 are 1 and 5, or maybe negative numbers since the middle term is negative and the constant term is positive. \n\nWait, 5 is the product, and the sum is -6. So, the numbers should both be negative because their product is positive and their sum is negative. Let me think: what two negative numbers add up to -6 and multiply to 5? Let's see, -1 and -5: (-1) * (-5) = 5, and (-1) + (-5) = -6. Perfect!\n\nSo, the equation factors to:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives me the potential solutions:\n\nx - 1 = 0  =>  x = 1\n\nx - 5 = 0  =>  x = 5\n\nWait, hold on. I need to check these solutions in the original equation because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce solutions that don't actually work.\n\nLet me check x = 1 first.\n\nPlugging x = 1 into the original equation:\n\n1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n11 - 2 = 9, so √9 = 3.\n\nSo, 1 = 3 + 4 => 1 = 7. Hmm, that's not true. So x = 1 is an extraneous solution and must be discarded.\n\nNow, let's check x = 5.\n\nPlugging x = 5 into the original equation:\n\n5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n11 - 10 = 1, so √1 = 1.\n\nThen, 5 = 1 + 4 => 5 = 5. That works"

The x = 1 was introduced when I squared both sides, so it doesn't actually work.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. Let's go back through each step.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx^2 -8x +16 = 11 - 2x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx^2 -8x +16 -11 +2x = 0 => x^2 -6x +5 = 0\n\nFactorization: (x -1)(x -5) = 0 => x =1, x=5\n\nTesting x=1: 1=√(11-2)+4=√9 +4=3+4=7≠1. Doesn't work.\n\nTesting x=5: 5=√(11-10)+4=√1 +4=1+4=5. Works.\n\nSo, yeah, everything checks out. Therefore, only x=5 is the solution.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes, and the steps are logical. So I'm confident that x=5 is the only solution.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break down the solution step by step.\n\n1. Start with the original equation:\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4\n   \\]\n   \n2. Isolate the square root term by subtracting 4 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x}\n   \\]\n   \n3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n   \\[\n   (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n   \\]\n   \n4. Expand the left side:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n   \\]\n   \n5. Bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation"
