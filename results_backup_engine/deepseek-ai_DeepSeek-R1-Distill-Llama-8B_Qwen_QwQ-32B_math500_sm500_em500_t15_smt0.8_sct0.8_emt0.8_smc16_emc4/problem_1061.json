Since a hexagon has 6 sides, I'll multiply the side length by 6.\n\n8 cm is the perimeter of the hexagon.\n\nNext, I'll determine the number of sides of the octagon by recognizing that an octagon has 8 sides.\n\nFinally, to find the length of each side of the octagon, I'll divide the perimeter of the hexagon by the number of sides in the octagon.\n\nSo, 8 cm divided by 8 sides equals 1 cm.\n\nTherefore, each side of the regular octagon is 1 cm long.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon:**\n   \n   - **Given:** Each side of the hexagon is 16 cm.\n   - **Number of sides in a hexagon:** 6\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = \\text{Number of sides} \\times \\text{Side length} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand the relationship between the perimeters:**\n   \n   - The problem states that the regular octagon has the **same perimeter** as the regular hexagon.\n   \n   - **Number of sides in an octagon:** 8\n\n3. **Find the length of each side of the octagon:**\n   \n   - **Perimeter of octagon** = **Perimeter of hexagon** = 96 cm\n   - **Number of sides in octagon** = 8\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of each side of octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{\\text{Number of sides}} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\,\\text{cm}}\n\\]"
