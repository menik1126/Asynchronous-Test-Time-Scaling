Hmm, this looks a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I want to understand the expression better. The numerator is \\(x - y\\), and the denominator is a sum of \\(x^4\\), \\(y^4\\), and 6. So, both the numerator and the denominator involve \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), but raised to different powers. The numerator is linear in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), while the denominator is quartic. That makes me think that the function might have some nice properties or maybe can be optimized using calculus or some inequality.\n\nI recall that for optimization problems with multiple variables, partial derivatives are a common approach. Maybe I can use that here. So, let me consider the function \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). To find its maximum, I need to find the critical points by setting the partial derivatives equal to zero.\n\nLet me write down the partial derivatives. The partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{(-1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4y^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nTo find the critical points, I set both partial derivatives equal to zero, which means the numerators must be zero. So:\n\n1. \\( (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)4x^3 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( - (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)4y^3 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me simplify these equations.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\("

Let me try that.\n\nLet me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, the function becomes:\n\nf(r,θ) = (r cosθ - r sinθ)/(r^4 (cos^4θ + sin^4θ) +6 )\n\n= r (cosθ - sinθ) / (r^4 (cos^4θ + sin^4θ) +6 )\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be maximized by choosing θ and r appropriately.\n\nLet me denote A = cosθ - sinθ, and B = cos^4θ + sin^4θ.\n\nSo f(r,θ)= r A / (r^4 B +6 )\n\nTo maximize this expression over r and θ.\n\nFirst, for a fixed θ, we can consider f as a function of r:\n\nLet me denote f(r) = (A r)/(B r^4 +6). To find its maximum over r>0 (since r is non-negative in polar coordinates).\n\nTake derivative with respect to r:\n\nf’(r) = [A (B r^4 +6) - A r (4 B r^3)]/(B r^4 +6)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nA [ B r^4 +6 -4 B r^4 ] = A [ -3 B r^4 +6 ]\n\nSet numerator to zero:\n\n-3 B r^4 +6 =0 → 3 B r^4 =6 → r^4 = 2/B → r= (2/B)^{1/4}\n\nThus, the maximum for fixed θ occurs at r=(2/B)^{1/4}\n\nThen, substituting back into f(r):\n\nf_max(θ) = A * (2/B)^{1/4} / ( B*(2/B) +6 )\n\nWait, let me compute denominator at r=(2/B)^{1/4}:\n\nDenominator term: B r^4 +6 = B*(2/B) +6 = 2 +6 =8\n\nSo f_max(θ)= A*(2/B)^{1/4}/8\n\nThus, f_max(θ)= (A)/(8) * (2/B)^{1/4}\n\n"
