I need to find the value of the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r_5}}\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the equation. It's a polynomial equation of degree 10, so there are 10 roots in total, which makes sense. The roots are paired with their complex conjugates, except when a root is real, in which case the conjugate is the same as the root. So, for each pair \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\), the product \\(r_i\\overline{r}_i\\) is the modulus squared of the complex number \\(r_i\\), which is a real non-negative number.\n\nThe expression I need to compute is the sum of the reciprocals of these moduli squared for each pair. So, essentially, for each pair, I take \\(1/(r_i\\overline{r}_i)\\) and add them all up.\n\nLet me write out the equation again:\n\n\\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\).\n\nHmm, maybe I can rewrite this equation in a more manageable form. Let me set \\(y = 13x - 1\\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\).\n\nBut since \\(y = 13x - 1\\), substituting back in, we have:\n\n\\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\).\n\nWait, that's just the original equation. Maybe instead of substitution, I can factor this equation or analyze it somehow.\n\nBut it's a sum of two 10th powers equal to zero. For complex numbers, if \\(a + b = 0\\), then \\(b = -a"

Wait, hold on. Let me think again.\n\nWait, \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), so \\(\\omega^{20} = 1\\). Therefore, \\(\\omega\\) is a 20th root of unity, but specifically those with order dividing 20 but not 10. Hmm, actually, the solutions for \\(\\omega\\) would be the 20th roots of unity where the exponent is odd? Not sure, but maybe I can proceed.\n\nSo, for each 10th root of -1, which is equivalent to the 20th roots of unity with exponent 10, so \\(\\omega = e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\) for k from 0 to 9?

So, there are 5 pairs, each pair consisting of a complex number and its conjugate.

Since each pair's term is \\(1/(r_i \\overline{r_i})\\), which is the same as \\(1/|r_i|^2\\), so each term is the reciprocal of the modulus squared of each root in the pair. Since modulus squared is the same for a complex number and its conjugate, each pair contributes one term.

Vieta's formula relates the sum of reciprocals to the coefficients of the polynomial. But how?\n\nWait, but Vieta's formula relates the sum of roots, sum of products of roots two at a time, etc., to the coefficients. However, the sum we need is the sum of \\(1/|x|^2\\) for each root x. That might not directly correspond to a standard Vieta's formula, but perhaps we can find a way to relate it.\n\nAlternatively, since each x satisfies \\(x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10}\\), so \\(x^{10} = (-1)^{10} (13x -1)^{10} = (13x -1)^{10}\\).

Alternatively, since we need the sum over \\(1/|x_i|^2 = |y_i|^2 \\), since \\( x_i = 1/y_i \\), so \\( |x_i|^2 = 1/|y_i|^2 \\), so \\(1/|x_i|^2 = |y_i|^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum \\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} |y_i|^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the problem's desired sum is \\( S/2 \\).\n\nTherefore, if I can compute \\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{1"
