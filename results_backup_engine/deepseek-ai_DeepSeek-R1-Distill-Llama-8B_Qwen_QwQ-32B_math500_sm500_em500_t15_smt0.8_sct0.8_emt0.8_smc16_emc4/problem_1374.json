            "output": "I need to determine the number of boys attending the math club meeting where there are 35 students in total. The problem states that the number of girls is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys.\n\nFirst, I'll let \\( g \\) represent the number of girls. Since the number of girls is a multiple of 13, \\( g = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nNext, the total number of students is the sum of girls and boys, so \\( g + b = 35 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( g \\) into the equation gives \\( 13k + b = 35 \\). Solving for \\( b \\), we get \\( b = 35 - 13k \\).\n\nSince there are more girls than boys, \\( g > b \\), which translates to \\( 13k > 35 - 13k \\). Solving this inequality, I add \\( 13k \\) to both sides to get \\( 26k > 35 \\), then divide both sides by 26 to find \\( k > \\frac{35}{26} \\), which simplifies to \\( k > 1.346 \\).\n\nBecause \\( k \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \\( k \\) is 2.\n\nSubstituting \\( k = 2 \\) back into the equation for \\( b \\), we get \\( b = 35 - 13 \\times 2 = 35 - 26 = 9 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 9 boys attending the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( g \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( b \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Equations:**\n1. \\( g + b = 35 \\)\n2. \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13 ⇒ \\( g = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\n**Since there are more girls than boys:**\n\\( g > b \\)\n\n**Substitute \\( g \\) from equation 2 into equation 1:**\n\\( 13k + b = 35 \\)\n\n**Solve for \\( b \\):**\n\\( b = 35 - 13k \\)\n\n"
