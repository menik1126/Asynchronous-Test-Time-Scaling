I remember that when there's a square root in an equation, a common method is to isolate the square root and then square both sides to eliminate it. But before I jump into that, I should make sure I understand the equation properly.\n\nSo, the equation is \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\). I need to find all real values of \\( x \\) that satisfy this. First, let me consider the domain of the equation because the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. That gives me:\n\n\\( 11 - 2x \\geq 0 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( 11 \\geq 2x \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( x \\leq \\frac{11}{2} \\)\n\nSo, \\( x \\) must be less than or equal to 5.5. That's a crucial piece of information because any solution we get must satisfy this condition. Also, since the left side of the equation is \\( x \\), which can be positive or negative, but the right side has a square root, which is always non-negative, so \\( x \\) must be at least 4 because \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\) is at least 0 and we add 4. So, \\( x \\) is at least 4.\n\nSo, putting that together, \\( x \\) must be in the interval [4, 5.5]. Good, that narrows down the possible solutions.\n\nNow, let's get back to the equation:\n\n\\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\)\n\nI think the first step is to isolate the square root term. Let me subtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\)\n\nNow, to get rid of the square root, I'll square both sides of the equation:\n\n\\( (x - 4)^2 = (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 \\)\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\( (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( (\\sqrt{11 -"

That seems a bit off. Let me recast the equation:\n\nStarting equation after squaring both sides:\n\n\\( x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\)\n\nSubtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = x^2 - 6x + 5 \\)\n\nRight side: 0.\n\nSo, the quadratic equation is \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\). That's correct.\n\nNow, let's factor this quadratic if possible.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6.\n\nHmm, factors of 5 are 1 and 5. Since the middle term is -6x, it's -1 and -5 because (-1)*(-5)=5 and (-1) + (-5)= -6.\n\nSo, \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 = (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 \\)\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\( x - 1 = 0 \\)  →  \\( x = 1 \\)\n2. \\( x - 5 = 0 \\)  →  \\( x = 5 \\)\n\nSo, potential solutions are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\). But earlier, I established that \\( x \\) should be at least 4 and at most 5.5. So, \\( x = "

Let me check \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 5 \\) into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: \\( 5 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 10} + 4 = \\sqrt{1} + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\)\n\nSo, both sides equal 5. That works. So, \\( x = 5 \\) is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other solutions. Wait, we had a quadratic equation with only two roots, and only one of them is in the valid domain. So, it seems like \\( x = 5 \\) is the only solution.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let me go back a step. After squaring both sides, sometimes extraneous solutions can be introduced. So, I need to verify that \\( x = 5 \\) indeed satisfies the original equation, which it does as I just saw.\n\nIs there a chance there might be another solution? Maybe, but with quadratics, we usually get two solutions, but sometimes one gets rejected because of the domain or the squaring process.\n\nWait, let me think about another approach in case I missed something.\n\nLet me try to graph both sides of the original equation as functions.\n\nLeft side: \\( f(x) = x \\)\n\nRight side: \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\)\n\nI can analyze where these two functions intersect. Since \\( f(x) = x \\) is a straight line with slope 1 and \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\) is a square root function shifted right and up.\n\nThe square root function \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\) is defined for \\( x \\leq 5.5 \\), as we determined before. So, the graph of \\( g(x) \\) exists from \\( x = -\\infty \\) to \\( x = 5.5 \\), but since we have \\( x = f(x) \\), and \\( f(x) = x \\) is a line, let's see where they intersect.\n\nFrom the earlier domain, \\( x \\geq 4 \\), so let's"

So, here, the right side is lower.\n\nSo, the function g(x) starts at x= -infty? Wait, actually, the domain is x ≤5.5, but the square root is real only there. But the original equation requires that the right-hand side must be real, so x must be ≤5.5. But also, the right-hand side is sqrt(...) +4, which is at least 4. So, the left side x must be at least 4. So, the domain is [4,5.5].\n\nSo, in the interval [4,5.5], the function g(x) starts at x=4 with g(4)=sqrt(3)+4≈5.732, and decreases to g(5.5)=4. The line f(x)=x goes from 4 to 5.5 in that interval. So, the two functions cross at x=5, since at x=5, both are 5. At x=4, the g(x) is higher, and at x=5.5, the f(x) is higher. So, maybe there's another intersection point?\n\nWait, but according to the quadratic equation, there was only x=5 and x=1. Since x=1 is outside the domain, so only x=5. But let me check if maybe there's another solution between 5 and 5.5?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me pick a value between 5 and 5.5, say x=5.25.\n\nCompute f(5.25)=5.25\n\n"

So, f(x) is higher.\n\nSo, function f(x) is increasing from 4 to5.5, while g(x) is decreasing from ~5.732 to 4.\n\nSo, if f(x) is always above g(x) after x=5, except at x=5, where they meet.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my initial thought that maybe there's another point.\n\nWait, wait, let's test it again with another point.

So, they meet only at x=5.\n\nSo, that suggests that x=5 is the only solution.\n\nBut wait, before squaring, let me think: when we set \\( x -4 = \\sqrt{11 -2x} \\), we are assuming that \\( x -4 \\) is non-negative because the square root is non-negative. So, \\( x -4 \\geq 0 \\) → \\( x \\geq4 \\), which aligns with our earlier domain consideration.\n\nSo, when we square both sides, any solution that comes out must also satisfy \\( x \\geq4 \\).

So, yes, x=1 is not a solution.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nHmm, so I think that's thorough. Let me recap the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Start with equation: x = sqrt(11-2x) +4\n\n2. Determine domain: sqrt(11-2x) requires 11-2x ≥0 → x ≤5.5. Also, since sqrt(...) is non-negative, the right side is at least 4, so x must be ≥4. So domain is [4,5.5].\n\n3. Isolate sqrt term: x -4 = sqrt(11-2x)\n\n4. Square both sides: (x-4)^2 =11-2x → x²-8x+16=11-2x → x²-6x+5=0\n\n5. Factor quadratic: (x-1)(x-5)=0 → x=1 or x=5\n\n6. Check domain: x=1 is outside [4,5.5], so reject. x=5 is within domain.\n\n7. Verify x=5 in original equation: 5 = sqrt(11-10)+4 →5=1+4 →5=5 ✔️\n\n8. Check if there could be another solution, but quadratic only gives two roots, and the other is invalid. Also, graph analysis shows only one intersection at x=5.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps.
