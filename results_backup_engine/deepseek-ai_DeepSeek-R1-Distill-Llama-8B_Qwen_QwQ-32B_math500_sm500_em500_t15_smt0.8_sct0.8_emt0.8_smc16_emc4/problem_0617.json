            "output": "First, I recognize that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives 98.\n\nNext, I check if 98 is divisible by 2, and it is. Dividing 98 by 2 results in 49.\n\nNow, 49 is not divisible by 2, so I move to the next prime number, which is 7. Dividing 49 by 7 gives 7.\n\nFinally, 7 divided by 7 equals 1, which means 7 is a prime factor.\n\nFrom the prime factorization, 196 can be expressed as 2² × 7².\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, if a number has a prime factorization of the form p^a × q^b × ..., the total number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc.\n\nApplying this to 196's prime factors: (2+1)(2+1) = 3 × 3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 196**\n\n   We start by breaking down 196 into its prime factors.\n\n   - 196 is even, so it's divisible by 2.\n   - \\( 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\)\n   \n   - 98 is also even, so it's divisible by 2.\n   - \\( 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\)\n   \n   - 49 is not even and is a known prime number.\n   - \\( 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\) (since 7 × 7 = 49)\n\n   Putting it all together:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 7 \\times 7 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Applying the Divisor Formula**\n\n   The formula to find the number of positive divisors of a number based on its prime factorization is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Divisors} = (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1)... \n   \\]\n   \n   Where \\( a, b, c, ... \\) are the exponents in the prime"
