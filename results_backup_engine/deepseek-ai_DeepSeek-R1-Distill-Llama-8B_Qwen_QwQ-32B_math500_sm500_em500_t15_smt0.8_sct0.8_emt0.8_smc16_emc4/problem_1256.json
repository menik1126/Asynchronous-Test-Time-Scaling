The quotient from this division will become the next digit in base six. \n\nI'll repeat this process for the remaining quotient, continuing until all digits are processed. \n\nFinally, I'll compile the remainders from each division step to obtain the number in base six.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Base Conversion:**\n   - In base six (also known as senary), each digit represents a power of six.\n   - To convert a decimal number to base six, divide the number by 6 repeatedly and record the remainders.\n\n2. **Convert \\(999_{10}\\) to Base Six:**\n   \n   - **First Division:**\n     \\[\n     999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n     \\]\n     - The rightmost digit (least significant digit) in base six is **3**.\n   \n   - **Second Division:**\n     \\[\n     166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n     \\]\n     - The next digit is **4**.\n   \n   - **Third Division:**\n     \\[\n     27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n     \\]\n     - The next digit is **3**.\n   \n   - **Fourth Division:**\n     \\[\n     4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n     \\]\n     - The leftmost digit is **4**.\n\n3. **Write the Base Six Number:**\n   - The remainders, read from last to first, give the base six number: **4 3 4 3**.\n   - Therefore, \\(999_{10} = 4343_{6}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4343_{6}}\n\\]"
