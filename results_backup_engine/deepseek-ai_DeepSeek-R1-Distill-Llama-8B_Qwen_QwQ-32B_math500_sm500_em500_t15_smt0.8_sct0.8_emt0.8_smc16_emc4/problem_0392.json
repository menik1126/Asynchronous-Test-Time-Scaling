I remember that the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is calculated using the formula \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nFrom the diagram, the radius of the cylinder is provided as 3 centimeters. I'll substitute this value into the volume formula to solve for the height.\n\nStarting with the equation:\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\pi \\) to simplify:\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\nNow, to isolate \\( h \\), I'll divide both sides by 9:\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, the height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo find the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume of the cylinder,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\n**Given:**\n- Volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters,\n- Radius \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters.\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe height of the cylinder is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) centimeters."
