I need to find the sum of all complex solutions. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the equation has denominators of the form \\(x^2 - k\\), where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each term has a coefficient that's increasing by 1: 1, 2, 3, 4. So maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit.\n\nThe equation is equal to \\(2010x - 4\\). That seems like a linear term on the right. Maybe I can manipulate the left side to make it similar to the right side.\n\nLet me consider each term on the left separately. Each term is of the form \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\), where \\(n\\) is from 1 to 4. Maybe I can express each term as a series or something. But that seems messy.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I can rewrite each fraction in a way that relates to the linear term on the right. Let me try partial fractions or something related to derivatives? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write each term as a derivative of a logarithm? Like, since the derivative of \\(\\ln(x^2 - k)\\) is \\(\\frac{2x}{x^2 - k}\\), but my terms have different coefficients. Hmm, 1, 2, 3, 4... Maybe I need to adjust that idea.\n\nWait, let me try a substitution. Let me set \\(y = x^2\\). Then, the denominators become \\(y - 1\\), \\(y - 2\\), \\(y - 3\\), and \\(y - 4\\). So the left side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\"

Since \\(y = x^2\\), maybe I can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\), but that would involve square roots, which complicates things. Maybe substitution isn't the way to go here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying all terms to a common denominator? That might be a huge denominator, but maybe there's a pattern.\n\nLet me see: the denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). The common denominator would be the product of all these denominators. That's going to be a degree 8 polynomial. Multiplying both sides by that would lead to a very high degree equation. But maybe the equation simplifies in some way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a symmetry here. Let me think about the left-hand side (LHS). Each term is \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\). Let me see if there's a way to combine these terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that each term can be written as \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n} = \\frac{n}{-(n - x^2)} = -\\frac{n}{n - x^2}\\). Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4}\\). The equation is \\(f(x) = 2010x - 4\\). Maybe I can analyze the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) and see where it intersects with the line \\(2010x - 4\\). But since we need the sum of all complex solutions, maybe there's a trick with Vieta's formula?\n\nVieta's formula relates the sum of roots of a polynomial equation to its coefficients. But the problem is that the given equation isn't a polynomial equation yet. To apply Vieta, I need to convert it into a polynomial equation. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me move all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac"

The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\), and 1 (from the constant term). The common denominator would be the product of these denominators: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). That's a product of four quadratics, so that's \\(x^8 - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)x^6 + \\dots\\), but let me just denote it as \\(D\\).\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(D\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 \\cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)\\right) - 2010x \\cdot D + 4D = 0.\n\\]\n\nWhoa, that seems way too complicated.
