            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\) given three equations involving \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\). Let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given equations to keep things clear:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nOur goal is to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\). Hmm, okay. Let's see how these equations can be related to each other or if they can be manipulated to give us the desired result.\n\nI remember that in problems involving symmetric sums, sometimes it helps to use the identities related to sums of powers. Maybe I can relate the given equations to some symmetric functions or use Vieta's formulas if possible.\n\nWait, the third equation looks a bit complicated. Let me parse that:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nI notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Let me see if I can factor this expression or write it in a more symmetric way.\n\nLooking at \\( xy^2 + x^2 y \\), I can factor out \\( xy \\), which gives \\( xy(y + x) \\). Similarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z \\) can be factored as \\( xz(z + x) \\), and \\( yz^2 + y^2 z \\) becomes \\( yz(z + y) \\).\n\nSo, rewriting the third equation, we have:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, that's a bit better but still not something immediately useful. Let me denote \\( S = x + y + z \\) and \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\) since these are the standard symmetric sums. Also, let me denote \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\) as given.\n\nI also remember that the sum of cubes can be expressed as:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 +"

The formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q \\)\n\nSo substituting the known values:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3 S P + 3(4) \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3 S P + 12 \\)\n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides:\n\n\\( -8 = S^3 - 3 S P \\)\n\nSo, \\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\). Let me note that equation as (A).\n\nNow, moving on to the third equation. Let me see if I can express that in terms of S and P as well.\n\nThe third equation is:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nTake \\( xy(x + y) = x^2 y + x y^2 \\), similarly for the others. But that's just the original expression. Alternatively, maybe factor differently.\n\nAlternatively, notice that \\( xy(x + y) = xyS - xyz \\), since \\( x + y = S - z \\). Let me check that:\n\nWait, \\( x + y = S - z \\), so:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) = xy(S - z) = xy S - xyz \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( xz(x + z) = xz(S - y) = xz S - xyz \\)\n\nAnd \\( yz(y + z) = yz(S - x) = yz S - xyz \\)\n\nTherefore, adding all three terms:\n\n\\( [xy S - xyz] + [xz S - xyz] + [yz S - xyz] \\)\n\n= \\( S(xy + xz + yz) -"

So:\n\n\\( S P - 12 = 12 \\)\n\nWhich gives \\( S P = 24 \\). Let's note this as equation (B).\n\nNow, from equation (A), we had:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\)\n\nSubstituting equation (B), which says \\( S P = 24 \\), let's replace \\( S P \\) in equation (A):\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 \\times 24 = -8 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( S^3 - 72 = -8 \\)\n\nAdding 72 to both sides:\n\n\\( S^3 = 64 \\)\n\nSo, \\( S = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\), since the cube root of 64 is 4. (Assuming all variables are real numbers; if not, there could be other roots, but in the context of these equations, it's likely real.)\n\nNow, since \\( S = 4 \\) and \\( S P = 24 \\) from equation (B), we can find \\( P \\):\n\n\\( P = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( xy + yz + zx = 6 \\).\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, let's verify equation (A):\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\)\n\nWith \\( S=4 \\) and \\( P=6 \\):\n\n\\( 4^3 - 3*4*6 = 64 - 72 = -8 \\), which matches. Good.\n\nThen, equation (B):\n\n\\( S P = 24 \\Rightarrow 4*6 = 24 \\), which also checks out.\n\nNow, let's also check if the third equation is satisfied.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nWhich we found equals \\( S P - 12 = 4*6 - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12 \\), which matches the given third equation.\n\nSo everything seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the value"
