            "output": "First, I'll note the total number of students, which is 360. Out of these, 15 are not taking any of the three subjects, so 360 minus 15 equals 345 students are enrolled in at least one of calculus, physics, or chemistry.\n\nNext, I see that 180 students are taking calculus. This will help me determine the number of students taking only calculus or those taking calculus along with other subjects.\n\nIt's given that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics. Let's denote the number of physics students as P. Therefore, the number of chemistry students would be 2P.\n\nThe problem states that 75 students take both calculus and chemistry. Similarly, 75 students take both physics and chemistry. However, only 30 students are taking both physics and calculus. This overlapping information will be crucial in applying the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, the total number of students enrolled in at least one subject is equal to the sum of students in each subject minus the sum of students taking two subjects plus the students taking all three subjects. \n\nSo, the equation becomes:\nCalculus + Physics + Chemistry - (Both Calculus and Physics + Both Calculus and Chemistry + Both Physics and Chemistry) + Both Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry = Total Enrolled in At Least One Subject\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n180 + P + 2P - (30 + 75 + 75) + Both Three = 345\n\nSimplifying, I get:\n180 + 3P - 180 + Both Three = 345\n3P + Both Three = 345\n\nWithout additional information about students taking all three subjects, I'll assume that the number of students taking all three is zero, as it's not provided.\n\nThus, 3P = 345, leading to P = 115. Therefore, 115 students are taking physics.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 360\n- Students not taking any of the subjects (Calculus, Physics, Chemistry) = 15\n- Students taking **Calculus (C)** = 180\n- Students taking **Chemistry (Ch)** = 2 × Students taking **Physics (P)** (Let’s denote \\( P \\) as the number of students taking Physics)\n- Students taking both **Calculus and Chemistry** = 75\n- Students taking"
