To find the absolute value of (1 - i)^8, it's helpful to first determine its magnitude.\n\nThe magnitude of (1 - i) is calculated using the formula for the magnitude of a complex number a + bi, which is the square root of (a squared plus b squared). Here, a is 1 and b is -1, so the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).\n\nNow, (sqrt(2))^8 can be simplified by noting that (sqrt(2))^8 is equal to (2^(1/2))^8, which equals 2^(8/2) = 2^4 = 16.\n</think>\n\nRiproarin' Ringo needs to calculate the absolute value of the complex number \\((1 - i)^8\\). Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n|(1 - i)^8| &= |1 - i|^8 \\\\\n&= \\left( \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} \\right)^8 \\\\\n&= \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\right)^8 \\\\\n&= (2^{1/2})^8 \\\\\n&= 2^{8/2} \\\\\n&= 2^4 \\\\\n&= 16\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{16}\\)"
