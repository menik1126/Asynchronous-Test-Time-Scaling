            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where ω^1997 = 1 and ω ≠ 1. I need to evaluate the sum: 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω^2) + ... + 1/(1 + ω^1997). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that if ω^1997 = 1, then ω is a 1997th root of unity. Since ω ≠ 1, it's a primitive 1997th root of unity. That means ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 1996. So, ω is one of the roots other than 1. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, looking at the sum, it's a series from k=1 to k=1997 of 1/(1 + ω^k). Wait, but hold on, ω^1997 is 1, so when k=1997, ω^1997 is 1. So the last term is actually 1/(1 + 1), which is 1/2. So the sum is from k=1 to k=1996 of 1/(1 + ω^k) plus 1/2.\n\nHmm, but how do I evaluate this sum? Maybe I can pair the terms in some way. Because for roots of unity, their properties often allow for symmetries or pairings that simplify the sum.\n\nLet me recall that for roots of unity, ω^k and ω^{1997 - k} are complex conjugates. Since 1997 is a prime number, right? Wait, is 1997 prime? Let me check quickly. Yeah, 1997 is a prime number because it's not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. So, the roots are all primitive except for ω^0 = 1.\n\nSo, for each k from 1 to 1996, ω^k and ω^{1997 - k} are distinct and are complex conjugates because 1997 is odd. Let me confirm that: 1997 is an odd exponent, so the roots come in conjugate pairs. For example, ω and ω^{1996} are conjugates, ω^2 and ω^{1995} are conjugates, etc.\n\nSo, if I take the term 1/(1 +"

Because multiplying numerator and denominator by ω^k:\n\n1/(1 + ω^{-k}) = (ω^k)/(ω^k + 1)\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two terms is:\n\n1/(1 + ω^k) + ω^k/(1 + ω^k) = (1 + ω^k)/(1 + ω^k) = 1\n\nWait, that's nice! So each pair adds up to 1. Therefore, if I pair each term with its conjugate counterpart, each pair contributes 1 to the sum.\n\nNow, how many such pairs are there? Since we have 1996 terms from k=1 to 1996, and each pair consists of two terms, so there are 1996/2 = 998 pairs. Each pair sums to 1, so the total sum from k=1 to 1996 would be 998 * 1 = 998. Then, adding the last term which is 1/2 (from k=1997), the total sum would be 998 + 1/2 = 998.5, which is 1997/2. Wait, but 998.5 is 1997/2? Let me check: 1997 divided by 2 is indeed 998.5. So the total sum would be 1997"

            "output": "/2.\n\nBut hold on, that seems almost too straightforward. Let me verify my steps again.\n\nSo, I noted that ω^{1997 -k} = ω^{-k}, then 1/(1 + ω^{-k}) = ω^k/(ω^k +1). Then, adding 1/(1 + ω^k) + ω^k/(1 + ω^k) gives 1/(1 + ω^k) + ω^k/(1 + ω^k) = (1 + ω^k)/(1 + ω^k) =1.\n\nThat seems correct. So each pair indeed adds up to 1.\n\nBut wait, is the pairing valid? Because when k=1 and k=1996, they are conjugates. But does that hold for all k? Let me see.\n\nSuppose k is from 1 to 1996. For each k, 1997 - k is another integer from 1 to 1996, and they are distinct unless k=1997/2, but since 1997 is odd, there is no integer k where k = 1997 -k, so all pairs are distinct. So every term can be paired with its conjugate, and all pairs give 1, so no overlap.\n\nTherefore, the number of pairs is indeed 1996/2=998. So the sum from k=1 to 1996 is 998, as each pair contributes 1. Then, the last term when k=1997 is 1/(1 +1)=1/2. So the total sum is 998 + 1/2= 998.5= 1997/2.\n\nWait, but 998 + 1/2 is 998.5, which is 1997/2 because 1997 is an odd number, so 1997/2=998.5. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, does that mean the answer is 1997/2? That seems plausible.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider a small case where n is prime, say n=3. Let me see if the same approach works.\n\nLet n=3, so ω^3=1, ω≠1. So ω^2 + ω +1=0. Let me compute the sum S=1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2) + 1/(1 + ω"

            "output": "^3). Since ω^3=1, the last term is 1/2. The first two terms: 1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, note that ω^2 = conjugate of ω if we consider roots on the unit circle. Let me compute 1/(1 + ω) +1/(1 + ω^2). Let me combine them:\n\n[ (1 + ω^2) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω^2) ]\n\nNumerator: 2 + ω + ω^2\n\nDenominator: (1 + ω + ω^2 + ω^3). But ω^3=1, so denominator becomes 1 + ω + ω^2 +1 = (ω + ω^2 +1) +1. But since ω^2 + ω +1=0, so denominator is 0 +1=1.\n\nWait, numerator: 2 + (ω + ω^2) = 2 + (-1) =1, since ω + ω^2 = -1 (because 1 + ω + ω^2=0). So numerator is 1, denominator is 1. So the sum of the first two terms is 1. Then adding the last term 1/2 gives total sum 1 +1/2= 3/2, which is n/2 where n=3. So that works.\n\nTherefore, the formula holds for n=3, so likely holds for n=1997. Therefore, the answer is 1997/2. So boxed, that would be \\boxed{\\dfrac{1997}{2}}.\n\nWait, but let me check another case where n is even? Wait, but in the problem n is 1997 which is odd, so maybe even cases are different. Let me try n=2, but n=2 is not prime, but let's see. If n=2, then ω^2=1, but ω≠1, so ω=-1. Then the sum would be 1/(1 + (-1)) + 1/(1 +1). But 1/(1 + (-"
