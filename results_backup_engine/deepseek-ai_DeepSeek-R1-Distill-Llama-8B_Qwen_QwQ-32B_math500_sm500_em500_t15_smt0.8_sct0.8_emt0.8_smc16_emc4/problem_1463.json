I know I need to find the greatest length of rope that can be saved by replacing two ropes with a single one. Okay, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the setup. There's a point O, which is the origin, I think. Then, points A, B, C, D are placed around O: A is north, B is west, C is south, and D is east. So, A is directly north, meaning if O is at (0,0), A is at (0, something). Similarly, B is directly west, so (-something, 0), C is directly south, (0, -something), and D is east, (something, 0). The distances between C and D are given as 140 meters. Wait, so point C is at (0, -c) and D is at (d, 0). Then, the distance between C and D should be calculated using the distance formula.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. Since C is directly south of O, that should be (0, -something). And D is directly east, so (something, 0). So the straight-line distance between C and D is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to the distance from O to C and O to D. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the distance between C and D is 140 meters. So, if I let OC = a and OD = b, then the distance CD is sqrt(a² + b²) = 140. So that's one equation.\n\nNow, there's a hot-air balloon at point H, which is directly above O. So H has the same x and y coordinates as O, but it's elevated. So if O is at (0,0), H is at (0, h), where h is the height above the ground. Then, the ropes HA, HB, HC, and HD are tied from H to points A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nRope HC is 150 meters, and rope HD is 130 meters. So, from H to C is 150 m, and from H to D is 130 m. Now, the problem says that instead of having separate ropes HC and HD, we can replace them with"

We want to find the greatest length saved, so we need to minimize the total rope length (HP) and compare it with the previous total (HC + HD = 150 + 130 = 280) then subtract HP from 280 to find the saving. The greatest saving would be when HP is as small as possible. Wait, no, actually, that's correct. Because the minimal HP would mean the most saving. The maximum possible saving is when HP is minimized, so 280 - minimal HP is the answer.\n\nSo first, I need to find coordinates of points. Let me assign coordinates.\n\nLet me set up coordinate system with O at (0, 0). Then:\n\n- Point A is north of O, so let's say along the positive y-axis. Let's denote OA = y_A, so coordinates (0, y_A).\n\n- Point B is west of O, so along negative x-axis. OB = x_B, coordinates (-x_B, 0).\n\n- Point C is south of O, along negative y-axis. OC = y_C, so coordinates (0, -y_C).\n\n- Point D is east of O, along positive x-axis. OD = x_D, coordinates (x_D, 0).\n\nThe balloon is at H, directly above O, so coordinates (0,0, h) in 3D, but since all points are on flat field, maybe we can consider 2D coordinates but H is at (0, h)? Wait, probably using 2D with height as part of the rope length.\n\nSo the ropes HA, HB, HC, HD are each the hypotenuse of right triangles where one leg is the height h, and the other is the horizontal distance from O to the point.\n\nFor example, HC connects H (0, h) to C (0, -y_C). The horizontal distance between H and C: vertically, h, and horizontally, the distance from O to C is y_C, but since H is directly above O, the straight line HC would be sqrt(h² + (OC)^2). Wait, OC is the distance from O to C, which is y_C (since C is at (0, -y_C)). So the length of HC is sqrt(h² + (OC)^2) = 150 m"

For HA, it's from H (0, h) to A (0, y_A), so sqrt(h² + (OA)^2) = HA.\n\nFor HB, from H (0, h) to B (-x_B, 0), the distance is sqrt(h² + (OB)^2) = HB.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's given that HC is 150m and HD is 130m. So, from that, we can write two equations:\n\n1. sqrt(h² + (y_C)^2) = 150\n\n2. sqrt(h² + (x_D)^2) = 130\n\nSo, squaring both equations:\n\n1. h² + y_C² = 150² = 22500\n\n2. h² + x_D² = 130² = 16900\n\nSo, from these, we can get:\n\ny_C² = 22500 - h²\n\nx_D² = 16900 - h²\n\nBut we also know that CD = 140 m.

Now, with H at (0, h), and we need to find point P on CD such that HP replaces HC and HD, and the total length of HP is as small as possible, thereby saving the most rope.\n\nSo, first, CD is the line segment from C (0, -y_C) to D (x_D, 0). Point P is somewhere on CD, so we can parameterize P.\n\nSince we are to replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, so HP has to reach from H to P. So, the length of HP is the straight-line distance from H (0, h) to P, which is on CD.\n\nSo, to find the minimal HP, we need the minimal distance from H to the line CD. Because the minimal rope length is the perpendicular distance from H to CD.\n\nWait, but is that so? Wait, because H is fixed, and P is moving along CD, the minimal length HP is the perpendicular distance from H to CD.

Since P is on CD, the minimal HP is indeed the perpendicular distance. Because the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the key is to compute the perpendicular distance from H to CD, then compute 280 minus that distance, which would be the maximum saving.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of line CD.
