It's a complex equation with rational functions on the left side and a linear term on the right. I need to find the sum of all complex solutions. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the left-hand side (LHS) is a sum of fractions where each term has a linear coefficient (1, 2, 3, 4) in the numerator and a quadratic in the denominator, each shifted by 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. The right-hand side (RHS) is a linear function, 2010x minus 4.\n\nI remember that for equations like this, sometimes substituting variables can simplify things. The denominators are of the form \\(x^2 - n\\), where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe if I make a substitution like \\(y = x^2\\), but then each term would be different. Wait, but that might complicate things because each denominator is different. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider common denominators or try to manipulate the equation to make it more manageable. But with four terms, each having different denominators, it might get messy. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: sometimes, when dealing with equations involving reciprocals of quadratics, partial fractions can be useful. But I'm not sure if that directly applies here because all the denominators are different.\n\nWait, the equation is set equal to a linear function. Maybe I can think about the roots of the equation. Since it's a complex equation, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says that a polynomial of degree n has n roots. So, maybe I can express the given equation as a polynomial equation and find its degree.\n\nBut first, let's see: when does the LHS equal the RHS? Let's consider the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - "

The denominators on the left are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). The common denominator would be the product of all these denominators. That's going to be a huge polynomial, but maybe manageable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying step by step. But that might be tedious. Let me see if there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the left-hand side is a function of \\(x^2\\), so let me denote \\(y = x^2\\). Then the LHS becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\\]\n\nHmm, but the RHS is still in terms of x, not y. Since \\(y = x^2\\), the RHS is \\(2010x -4\\), which complicates things because it's not a function of y. So maybe substitution isn't helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving all terms to one side and then considering the equation as a function of x, then trying to find its roots. The problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions, so maybe Vieta's formula can be applied if we can express the equation as a polynomial equation. The sum of roots of a polynomial \\(P(x) = 0\\) is \\(-a_{n-1}/a_n\\), where \\(a_n\\) is the leading coefficient and \\(a_{n-1}\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^{n-1}\\).\n\nTherefore, if I can rewrite the given equation as a polynomial equation, then the sum of all roots (counting multiplicity) would be given by that formula.

So, the equation is a polynomial in x, and we can expand it to find a polynomial of some degree and then compute the sum of the roots.\n\nBut expanding this directly seems really messy because it will involve expanding each of the four terms multiplied by their respective coefficients, plus the last term which is a degree 8 polynomial. So, the entire equation would be a degree 8 polynomial. That's going to be a lot of work, but maybe manageable with systematic expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a smarter way. The question only asks for the sum of all complex solutions, so maybe we don't need to compute all the roots, just find the sum. Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of the roots is equal to -b/a, where a is the leading coefficient and b is the coefficient of x^{n-1}.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the coefficient of x^8 and the coefficient of x^7 in this polynomial, then the sum of roots is - (coefficient of x^7) / (coefficient of x^8).\n\nSo, perhaps instead of expanding everything, I can compute the coefficients of x^7 and x^8.\n\nLet me think. So, the equation is:\n\nE(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) + (2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) = 0.\n\nSo, E(x) is the sum of all these terms.\n\nLet me note that each of the first four terms is a cubic multiplied by another cubic, so each is a degree 6 polynomial.

Wait, but hold on, the original equation is set to zero, so E(x) is a degree 9 polynomial?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFirst four terms: each term is (x^2 - a)(x^2 - b)(x^2 - c). Since each x^2 term is quadratic, three of them multiplied together give a degree 6 polynomial. So each of the first four terms is degree 6. The coefficients (1, 2, 3, 4) don't affect the degree. So the first four terms are all degree 6. The last term is (2010x -4) multiplied by a degree 8 polynomial, so that term is degree 9. Therefore, the entire equation E(x) is a degree 9 polynomial. Therefore, the equation is of degree 9, so the sum of all roots (complex) is - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9).\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nThe leading term of each of the first four terms (each degree 6) would be x^6. The coefficients for x^6 in each term:\n\nFirst term: (x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) leading term is x^2 * x^2 * x^2 = x^6, so coefficient 1.\n\nSecond term: 2*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) leading term is 2*x^2*x^2*x^2 = 2x^6.\n\nThird term: 3*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -4) leading term 3x^6.\n\nFourth term: 4*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3) leading term 4x^6.\n\nSo the total coefficient of x^6 in the first four terms is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\n\nBut the last term is (2010x -4)*(quartic product).

So, the last term contributes a term with x^9 and a term with x^8.\n\nTherefore, in the entire polynomial E(x), the leading term is from the last term: 2010x^9.\n\nSo, coefficient of x^9 is 2010.\n\nNow, for the coefficient of x^8: where does it come from?\n\nIn the first four terms, which are each degree 6, the coefficient of x^8 can't come from them because they are degree 6. The x^8 term must come from the last term, since that's the only term of degree 9 before multiplication. Wait, but actually, the last term is (2010x -4) multiplied by (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). Let me denote the quartic as Q(x) = (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). Then Q(x) is degree 8, as each x^2 is quadratic, so four of them multiplied give degree 8. Therefore, Q(x) = x^8 + a x^6 + b x^4 + c x^2 + d.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply Q(x) by (2010x -4), the resulting polynomial is 2010x * Q(x) -4*Q(x). So the term 2010x * (x^8) is 2010x^9, and the term -4*(x^8) is -4x^8.\n\nThus, in E(x), the coefficient of x^9 is 2010, and the coefficient of x^8 is from two places:\n\n1. The x^8 term from -4 * Q(x). So that's -4 times the coefficient of x^8 in Q(x). But wait, in Q(x), coefficient of x^8 is 1, right? Because Q(x) is (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). So"

Wait, no. The first four terms are each degree 6, so their highest degree is x^6. Therefore, they can't contribute to x^8. So the only contribution to x^8 is from the last term, which is -4x^8.\n\nWait, but hold on, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the first four terms in E(x) are each of degree 6, so their highest degree term is x^6. Therefore, when we add them all together, the first four terms contribute up to x^6. The last term, when multiplied out, gives terms up to x^9. Therefore, the coefficients of x^8 in E(x) come only from the last term. Specifically, the term -4*Q(x) gives -4x^8, and the 2010x*Q(x) term gives 2010x^9, but also, when expanding 2010x*Q(x), the x^8 term would come from 2010x multiplied by the x^7 term of Q(x). Wait, but Q(x) is a polynomial in x^2, so all exponents are even. Therefore, Q(x) has only even powers of x. So Q(x) has terms x^8, x^6, x^4, x^2, and a constant term. Therefore, there is no x^7 term in Q(x). Therefore, when multiplying by 2010x, the x^8 term would come from 2010x multiplied by the x^7 term of Q(x), but since Q(x) has no x^7 term, that term is zero. Therefore, the only contribution to x^8 in E(x) is from the -4*Q(x) term, which is -4x^8. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^8 in E(x) is -4.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me confirm that Q(x) indeed has only even exponents.

Therefore, the only x^8 term is from -4*Q(x), which is -4x^8.

However, the problem states \"complex solutions\", so even if some roots are extraneous, they are not considered. Therefore, the sum of the solutions of the original equation is the sum of all roots of E(x)=0 minus the sum of the excluded roots (the 8 roots where D=0). \n\nBut as I thought before, the sum of the excluded roots is zero because they come in pairs like a and -a, so their sum cancels. For example, 1 and -1 sum to 0, √2 and -√2 sum to 0, etc. So total sum of excluded roots is 0. Therefore, the sum of the solutions of the original equation is the same as the sum of the roots of E(x)=0, which is 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005. But let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the coefficients. Let me re-express E(x):\n\nE(x) = [sum of first four terms] + (2010x -4)*Q(x)\n\nThe first four terms are each of degree 6, so their sum is a degree 6 polynomial. The last term is degree 9. Therefore, the entire equation is degree 9. The leading term is 2010x^9, so leading coefficient is 2010. The next term is the x^8 term, which comes from -4*Q(x). Since Q(x) has leading term x^8, so -4*Q(x) has -4x^8. The first four terms can't contribute to x^8, so"

            "output": " the coefficient of x^8 is indeed -4.\n\nThus, the coefficient of x^8 is -4, so sum of roots is 4/2010=2/1005.\n\nTherefore, I think I was correct the first time.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's think: is there any chance that when expanding the first four terms, I might have contributed to the x^8 term? Each of the first four terms is (x^2 -k1)(x^2 -k2)(x^2 -k3) multiplied by some coefficient. So, for example, the first term is (x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). When you multiply these three, you get x^6 - (2+3+4)x^4 + (2*3 + 2*4 +3*4)x^2 - 2*3*4. So the terms go down from x^6 to x^2, no x^8.\n\nTherefore, each of the first four terms only have up to x^6. Therefore, their sum can't have x^7 or x^8 terms.\n\nTherefore, the x^8 term is only from the last term, which is -4x^8.\n\nSo, again, the coefficient of x^8 is -4, and x^9 is 2010. Therefore, sum of roots is 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nThus, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the sum of all complex solutions of the given equation is 2⁄1005.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4,\n\\]\n\nwe first recognize that it is a complex equation involving rational functions.

This results in a polynomial equation \\(E(x) = 0\\).\n\n2. **Degree Analysis**:\n   - The left-hand side terms (after multiplication) are polynomials of degree 6.\n   - The right-hand side term, when multiplied by the denominator, becomes a polynomial of degree 9 (since \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\) is degree 8, multiplied by \\(2010x\\) gives degree 9).\n   - Thus, the resulting polynomial \\(E(x)\\) is of degree 9.\n\n3. **Leading Coefficients**:\n   - The leading term of \\(E(x)\\) comes from the term \\(2010x \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\), which is \\(2010x^9\\).
