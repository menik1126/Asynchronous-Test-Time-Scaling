            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: find the positive value of x such that the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation given is:\n\n∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nI remember that when you have a cube root, one way to solve for the variable inside is to get rid of the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. That should simplify things.\n\nSo, if I cube both sides, the left side should become x² - 4x + 4, and the right side will be 16 cubed. Let me write that out.\n\n(x² - 4x + 4)³ = 16³\n\nNow, I need to compute 16³. I think 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16... Let me calculate that. 256 * 10 is 2560, and 256 * 6 is 1536. So, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, 16³ is 4096.\n\nSo, now the equation is:\n\n(x² - 4x + 4)³ = 4096\n\nTo get rid of the cube on the left, I should take the cube root of both sides again. Wait, but if I cube both sides, it's the same as taking the cube root. Hmm, no, actually, if I cube both sides, I already did that. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, no, the equation is (x² - 4x + 4)³ = 4096. So, if I take the cube root of both sides, I get x² - 4x + 4 = ∛4096. But ∛4096 is 16, since 16³ is 4096. So that simplifies back to x² - 4x + 4 = 16.\n\nWait, that seems like I'm going in circles. Let me check that again.\n\nStarting over: ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nCubing both sides gives:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 16³\n\nWhich is 4096.\n\nSo now, I can write:\n\nx²"

Let me see if I can factor this or maybe use the quadratic formula.\n\nFirst, let me check if the quadratic factors nicely. The equation is x² -4x -4092 =0.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -4092 and add up to -4. Hmm, that might be tricky. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe completing the square would work here. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with x² -4x = 4092\n\nTo complete the square, take half of the coefficient of x, which is -4/2 = -2, square it, which is 4, and add to both sides.\n\nSo:\n\nx² -4x +4 = 4092 +4\n\nLeft side becomes (x - 2)^2, right side is 4096.\n\nSo:\n\n(x - 2)^2 = 4096\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nx - 2 = ±√4096\n\n√4096 is 64, since 64*64 is 4096.\n\nSo:\n\nx - 2 = ±64\n\nTherefore, solving for x:\n\nx = 2 + 64 = 66\n\nor\n\nx = 2 - 64 = -62\n\nThe problem asks for the positive value of x, so 66 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me plug x = 66 back into the original equation to verify.\n\nOriginal equation: ∛(x² -4x +4) =16\n\nCompute x² -4x +4 when x=66:\n\n66² is 4356, minus 4*66 is 264, so 4356 -264 = 4092, plus 4 is 4096.\n\nSo inside the cube root, it's 40"

Wait, no, 4096 is 16³, so cube root of 4096 is 16.\n\nWhich matches the right side, so yes, it's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that x=-62 doesn't work, even though we are asked for positive.\n\nIf x=-62:\n\n(-62)^2 is 3844, minus 4*(-62)=+248, so 3844 +248 = 4092, plus 4 is 4096.\n\nSo same as above, ∛4096=16, which would mean the equation holds for x=-62 as well.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the positive value, 66 is the answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the quadratic equation gave two roots, positive and negative. So yeah, the positive one is 66.\n\nLet me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nStarting equation: ∛(x² -4x +4)=16\n\nCube both sides: x² -4x +4 =4096\n\nSubtract 4096: x² -4x -4092=0\n\nCompleting the square: x² -4x +4 =4096 → (x-2)^2=4096\n\nSquare root: x-2=±64 → x=2±64 → x=66 or x=-62\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've covered all steps carefully. I didn't make any calculation errors that I can see.
