I'll break down his movements into horizontal and vertical components.\n\nFirst, Bill walks 1/2 mile south, which is a straight vertical movement downward. Then, he walks 3/4 mile east, which is a horizontal movement to the right. Finally, he walks another 1/2 mile south, adding to his total southern displacement.\n\nI'll convert the fractions to decimals to make calculations easier. Half of a mile is 0.5, and three-quarters of a mile is 0.75.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total displacement in the southward direction, which is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0 mile. Eastward, the displacement is 0.75 mile.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from the starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the legs of a right triangle (south and east displacements) to its hypotenuse (the straight-line distance).\n\nApplying the formula, the straight-line distance is the square root of (1.0 squared plus 0.75 squared). Calculating this gives approximately 1.118 miles. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, the distance is 1.12 miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze Bill's movements step by step to determine his straight-line distance from the starting point.\n\n1. **Bill's Movements:**\n   - **First:** Bill walks $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile **south**.\n   - **Second:** Then, he walks $\\frac{3}{4}$ mile **east**.\n   - **Third:** Finally, he walks another $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile **south**.\n\n2. **Calculating Total Displacement:**\n   - **Southward Displacement:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} = 1.0 \\text{ mile south}\n     \\]\n   - **Eastward Displacement:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile} = 0.75 \\text{ miles east}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   To find the straight-line distance from the starting point, we can consider the displacements in the south and east directions as the legs of a right-"
