            "output": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So, it should look something like P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + c, right? \n\nThe problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we're given that P(0) = 5, and we need to find P(5).\n\nHmm, okay, so let me recall the Remainder Theorem. I think it says that if you divide a polynomial P(x) by (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But here, we're dividing by quadratic polynomials, (x - a)(x - b), so the remainder should be a linear polynomial, right? Because when you divide by a degree n polynomial, the remainder has degree less than n. Since we're dividing by quadratic, the remainder is linear, so R(x) is of the form mx + n.\n\nSo, R(x) = m x + n. \n\nNow, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So, according to the Remainder Theorem, P(1) = R(1), and P(4) = R(4).\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so P(2) = 2R(2), and P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nSo, let me write down these equations:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1) => P(1) = m*1 + n = m + n\n2. P(4) = R(4) => P(4) = m*4 + n = 4m + n\n3. P(2) = 2R(2) => P(2) = 2*(2m + n) = 4m + 2n\n4. P(3) = 2R(3) => P(3) = 2*(3m"

Let's write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = x³ + a x² + b x + c\n\nWe also know that P(0) = c = 5. So, c = 5. That's one variable down.\n\nNow, let's plug in x = 1, 2, 3, 4 into P(x) and set up equations.\n\nSo:\n\nP(1) = 1 + a + b + c = (1)³ + a(1)² + b(1) + c = 1 + a + b + 5 = a + b + 6\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = 13 + 4a + 2b\n\nP(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 = 32 + 9a + 3b\n\nP(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 69 + 16a + 4b\n\nNow, from the earlier equations (1 to 4), let's substitute these expressions into those equations.\n\nEquation 1: P(1) = a + b + 6 = m + n\nEquation 2: P(4) = 69 + 16a + 4b = 4m + n\nEquation 3: P(2) = 13 + 4a + 2b = 4m + 2n\nEquation 4: P(3) = 32 + 9a + 3b = 6m + 2n\n\nSo, we have four equations:\n\n1. a + b + 6 = m + n --> (1)\n2. 69 + 16a + 4b = 4m + n --> (2)\n3. 13 + 4a + 2b = 4m + 2n --> (3)\n4. 32 + 9a + 3b = 6m + 2n --> (4)\n\nWe need to solve for a,"

Let me go back.\n\nWait, equation (2): 4m +n=69 +16a +4b.\n\nWe found m= -8a -43, n=14 +2a.\n\nSo, plugging into equation (2):\n\n4*(-8a -43) +14 +2a=69 +16a +4b.\n\nCompute left side:\n\n-32a -172 +14 +2a= (-30a) -158.\n\nRight side:69 +16a +4b.\n\nBut we have b= -35 -7a, so 4b= -140 -28a.\n\nThus, right side=69 +16a -140 -28a= -71 -12a.\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n-30a -158 = -71 -12a.\n\nThus, -30a +12a = -71 +158.\n\n-18a=87.\n\nSo, a= -87/18= -29/6. Correct.\n\nSo, the problem must be elsewhere. Maybe in the setup of the equations.\n\nWait, another thought: when dividing by a quadratic, the remainder is R(x)=mx +n. So, R(x) is linear, correct.\n\nBut P(x) divided by (x -1)(x -4)=x² -5x +4.\n\nBut we also have that when dividing by (x -2)(x -3)=x² -5x +6, the remainder is 2R(x). So, the key is to note that R(x) is"
