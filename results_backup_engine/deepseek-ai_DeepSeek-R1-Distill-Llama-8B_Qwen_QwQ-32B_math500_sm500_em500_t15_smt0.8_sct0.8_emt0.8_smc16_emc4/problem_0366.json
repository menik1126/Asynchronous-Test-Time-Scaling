            "output": "First, I'll define the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let’s say there are 4x blue marbles and 3x yellow marbles since the ratio of blue to yellow is 4:3.\n\nNext, I'll apply the changes to the marbles. Adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles gives me 4x + 5 blue marbles and 3x - 3 yellow marbles.\n\nNow, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 7:3. So, I can set up the equation (4x + 5)/(3x - 3) = 7/3.\n\nTo solve for x, I'll cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions: 3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3).\n\nExpanding both sides, I get 12x + 15 = 21x - 21.\n\nNext, I'll combine like terms: 15 + 21 = 21x - 12x, which simplifies to 36 = 9x.\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 9 to find x: x = 4.\n\nUsing x = 4, the initial number of blue marbles is 4x = 16.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let’s define:**\n- Let the initial number of blue marbles be \\( 4x \\).\n- Let the initial number of yellow marbles be \\( 3x \\).\n\n**Step 1: Apply the Changes**\n- Add 5 blue marbles: Blue marbles become \\( 4x + 5 \\).\n- Remove 3 yellow marbles: Yellow marbles become \\( 3x - 3 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Ratio After Changes**\n- The new ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 7:3 \\).\n- So, we have:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n- Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:\n  \\[\n  3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n  \\]\n- Expand both sides:\n  \\[\n  12x + 15 = 21x - 21"
