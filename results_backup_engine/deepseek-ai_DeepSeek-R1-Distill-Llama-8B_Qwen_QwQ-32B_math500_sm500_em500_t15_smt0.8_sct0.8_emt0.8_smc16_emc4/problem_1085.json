The third term is then obtained by multiplying the second term by 1, which remains 1. \n\nFor the fourth term, I add 2 to the third term, giving 3. The fifth term is obtained by multiplying the fourth term by 2, resulting in 6. Next, I add 3 to the fifth term to get 9. The process continues by multiplying by 3 to obtain 27 for the seventh term.\n\nFollowing this pattern, each odd-numbered term involves multiplication by the next integer, while each even-numbered term involves addition of the next integer. By systematically applying these operations, I can generate each subsequent term and identify the first term that exceeds 125.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to find the first term greater than 125.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Sequence Pattern**\n\n- **Term 1 (n=1):** 0\n- **Term 2 (n=2):** Add 1 to Term 1: \\(0 + 1 = 1\\)\n- **Term 3 (n=3):** Multiply Term 2 by 1: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n- **Term 4 (n=4):** Add 2 to Term 3: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n- **Term 5 (n=5):** Multiply Term 4 by 2: \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n- **Term 6 (n=6):** Add 3 to Term 5: \\(6 + 3 = 9\\)\n- **Term 7 (n=7):** Multiply Term 6 by 3: \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n- **Term 8 (n=8):** Add 4 to Term 7: \\(27 + 4 = 31\\)\n- **Term 9 (n=9):** Multiply Term 8 by 4: \\(31 \\times 4 = 124\\)\n- **Term 10 (n=10):** Add 5 to Term 9: \\(124 + 5 = 129\\)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the First Term Exceeding"

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
