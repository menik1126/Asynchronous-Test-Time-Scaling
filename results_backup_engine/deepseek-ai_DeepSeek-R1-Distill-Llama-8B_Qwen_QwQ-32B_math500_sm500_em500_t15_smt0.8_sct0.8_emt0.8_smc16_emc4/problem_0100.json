            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is a bit complex: it's a sum of two fractions equal to another fraction, and it says this holds for all real values of x except -8 and 3. Hmm, that makes sense because those values would make the denominators zero, which is undefined.\n\nAlright, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\n\n(C)/(x - 3) + (D)/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/(x² + 5x - 24)\n\nFirst, I notice that the denominator on the right side is a quadratic. Maybe I can factor that to make things easier. Let me try factoring x² + 5x - 24. I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3? Because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So yes, it factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). That's good because the denominators on the left are also (x - 3) and (x + 8). \n\nSo now the equation is:\n\nC/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nSince the left side has the same denominators as the right side, maybe I can combine the left side into a single fraction with the same denominator. Let me do that.\n\nSo, combining the two fractions on the left:\n\n[C/(x - 3)] + [D/(x + 8)] = [C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nBecause when you add fractions, you get a common denominator, which is (x - 3)(x + 8) in this case. Then, the numerators get multiplied accordingly. So, C multiplied by (x + 8) and D multiplied by (x - 3), and then added together.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n[C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)] = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + "

            "output": "8)]\n\nSince the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal for all x (except x = 3 and x = -8). So, I can set the numerators equal to each other:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, let's expand the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nGroup like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x -23\n\nSo now, we have a linear equation in terms of x. For this equation to hold for all x (except the excluded values), the coefficients of the corresponding powers of x must be equal on both sides. That means:\n\n1. The coefficient of x on the left, which is (C + D), must equal the coefficient of x on the right, which is 4.\n2. The constant term on the left, which is (8C - 3D), must equal the constant term on the right, which is -23.\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. C + D = 4\n2. 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, we need to solve this system for C and D. Since both C and D are integers, we can use either substitution or elimination. I think substitution might be straightforward here.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express C in terms of D:\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nNow, plug this into the second equation:\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand 8*(4 - D):\n\n8*4 = 32, and 8*(-D) = -8D\n\nSo, 32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 -11D = -23\n\nNow, let's solve for D.\n\nFirst, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 -32\n\n-11D = -55\n\nNow, divide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo, D is 5. Now, substitute back into C = 4 - D:\n\nC = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is "
