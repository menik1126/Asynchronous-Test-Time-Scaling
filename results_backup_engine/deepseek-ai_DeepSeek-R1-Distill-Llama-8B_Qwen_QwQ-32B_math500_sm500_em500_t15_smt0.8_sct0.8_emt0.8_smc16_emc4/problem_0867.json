            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to combine these terms: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3. The goal is to write the entire expression in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I need to find the sum a + b + c.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression has two parts: one involving √2 and the other involving √3. That might be a good starting point. So, I can separate the terms into two groups: those with √2 and those with √3.\n\nSo, let's write it as (√2 + 1/√2) + (√3 + 1/√3). Now, for each group, I can try to combine them into a single fraction. \n\nStarting with the √2 terms: √2 + 1/√2. To combine these, I need a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and √2, so the common denominator would be √2. \n\nLet me rewrite √2 as (√2 * √2)/√2 because that's equivalent to √2. √2 times √2 is 2, so that becomes 2/√2. Now, adding 1/√2 to that: 2/√2 + 1/√2 = (2 + 1)/√2 = 3/√2.\n\nSimilarly, for the √3 terms: √3 + 1/√3. Using the same approach, √3 can be rewritten as (√3 * √3)/√3, which is 3/√3. Adding 1/√3 to that: 3/√3 + 1/√3 = (3 + 1)/√3 = 4/√3.\n\nSo now, the entire expression becomes 3/√2 + 4/√3. Now, I have two fractions with square roots in the denominators. I need to combine them into a single fraction. To do that, I need a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are √2 and √3. The least common denominator (LCD) for √2 and √3 would be √2 * √3, which is √6. So, let"

            "output": " me convert both fractions to have √6 as their denominator.\n\nStarting with 3/√2. I need to multiply both numerator and denominator by √3 to get √6 in the denominator. So, 3/√2 = (3√3)/(√2 * √3) = 3√3/√6.\n\nNext, 4/√3. I need to multiply both numerator and denominator by √2 to get √6 in the denominator. So, 4/√3 = (4√2)/(√3 * √2) = 4√2/√6.\n\nNow, add the two fractions together: 3√3/√6 + 4√2/√6. Since the denominators are the same, I can add the numerators: (3√3 + 4√2)/√6.\n\nSo, the expression is now (3√3 + 4√2)/√6. But the problem wants it in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c. Right now, I have (4√2 + 3√3)/√6. So, that's almost in the desired form, except the denominator is √6. I need to rationalize the denominator if possible, but the problem doesn't specify that c has to be rationalized. Wait, actually, in the given form, c is supposed to be a positive integer. But √6 is irrational. So, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says the form is (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a, b, c are positive integers. So, c must be an integer, but in my current expression, c is √6, which is irrational. That can't be. So, maybe I need to rationalize the denominator?\n\nBut how? Because in the current step, I have (3√3 + 4√2)/√6. If I rationalize the denominator, I would multiply numerator and denominator by √6. Let me try that.\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by √6: [(3√3 + 4√2) * √6] / (√6 * √6) = [(3√3 * √6) + (4√2 * √6)] / 6.\n\nCalculating the terms in the numerator:\n\nFirst term: 3√3 * √6 = 3√(3*6)"

So, 4√12 = 4*2√3 = 8√3.\n\nSo, numerator becomes 9√2 + 8√3.\n\nDenominator is 6.\n\nSo, the expression becomes (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nNow, this is in the desired form: (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a = 9, b = 8, and c = 6.\n\nWait, are a, b, and c positive integers? Yes, 9, 8, and 6 are positive integers. And c is 6, which is as small as possible because we already rationalized the denominator, so I don't think c can be smaller than 6.\n\nLet me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with √2 + 1/√2:\n\n√2 is equal to 2/√2, so adding 1/√2 gives 3/√2.\n\nSimilarly, √3 + 1/√3 is 4/√3.\n\nAdding 3/√2 + 4/√3.\n\nThen, to combine, I found the LCD as √6, converted both fractions:\n\n3/√2 = (3√3)/√6 and 4/√3 = (4√2)/√6.

Let me see.\n\nSuppose we don't rationalize the denominator. Then we have (3√3 + 4√2)/√6.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the form is (a√2 + b√3)/c, so c is in the denominator. So, in that case, c is √6, which is not an integer. So, no, that's not acceptable because c must be a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to have c as 6 in the final expression.

Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, we can write each term as something over 1, then find a common denominator.\n\nBut in any case, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 23.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by combining the terms involving √2 and √3 separately.\n\nFirst, for the √2 terms:\n√2 + 1/√2 = (√2 * √2)/√2 + 1/√2 = 2/√2 + 1/√2 = 3/√2.\n\nFor the √3 terms:\n√3 + 1/√3 = (√3 * √3)/√3 + 1/√3 = 3/√3 + 1/√3 = 4/√3.\n\n"
