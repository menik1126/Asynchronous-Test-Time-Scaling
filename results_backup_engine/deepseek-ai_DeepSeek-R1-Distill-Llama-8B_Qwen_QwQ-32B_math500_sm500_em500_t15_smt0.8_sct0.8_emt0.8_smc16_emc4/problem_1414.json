            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the beaker has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, plugging in these values will give me the volume of one beaker.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius of the sphere. Since the tank has a radius of 6 cm, I'll substitute this value into the formula.\n\nOnce I have both volumes, I'll divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank completely.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer, making sure to format it appropriately for clarity.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n   - **Formula:** \\( V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h \\)\n   - **Given:** Radius \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\), Height \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n   - **Formula:** \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 \\)\n   - **Given:** Radius \\( R = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   \n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Beakers Needed**\n   - **Number of Beakers:** \\( \\frac{V_{\\text{sphere}}}{V_{\\text{cylinder}}} = \\frac{288\\pi}{72\\pi} = 4 \\)\n   \n   \\[\n   \\"
