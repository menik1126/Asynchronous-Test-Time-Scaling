            "output": "I need to determine the number of boys attending the math club meeting. \n\nFirst, I'll denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. \n\nFrom the problem, I know that the total number of students is 35, so G + B = 35.\n\nAdditionally, G is a multiple of 13. The multiples of 13 up to 35 are 13 and 26. \n\nSince there are more girls than boys, G must be greater than B. This means B is less than G.\n\nTesting G = 13: Then B = 35 - 13 = 22. But G = 13 is not greater than B = 22, so this doesn't work.\n\nTesting G = 26: Then B = 35 - 26 = 9. Here, G = 26 is greater than B = 9, which satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 boys attending the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n- Total students: 35\n- Number of girls (\\( G \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- Let \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Equations**\n1. Total students: \\( G + B = 35 \\)\n2. Number of girls is a multiple of 13: \\( G = 13 \\times k \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Possible Values for \\( G \\)**\nSince \\( G \\) must be a multiple of 13 and less than or equal to 35:\n- Possible values of \\( G \\): 13, 26\n\n**Step 4: Test Possible Values of \\( G \\)**\n1. **Case 1:** \\( G = 13 \\)\n   - \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\)\n   - **Check Condition:** \\( G > B \\) → \\( 13 > 22 \\) → **False**\n\n2. **Case 2:** \\( G = 26 \\)\n   - \\( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\)\n   - **Check Condition:** \\( G > B \\) → \\( 26 > 9 \\) → **True**\n\n**Step"
