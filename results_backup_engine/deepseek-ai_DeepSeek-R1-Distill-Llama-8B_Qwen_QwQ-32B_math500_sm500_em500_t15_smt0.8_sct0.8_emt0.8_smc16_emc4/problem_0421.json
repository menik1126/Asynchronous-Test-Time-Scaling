So, each term is the reciprocal of the product of a root and its conjugate.

Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}} \\) is the reciprocal of \\( |r|^2 \\), which is essentially the squared reciprocal of the modulus. So, each term is \\( \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} \\). So, the sum we need to compute is:\n\n\\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} \\]\n\nNow, I need to find this sum.
