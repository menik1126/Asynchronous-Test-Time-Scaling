            "output": "First, I need to identify the sequence of numbers that make up the given sum. The sequence starts at 1 and increases by 2 each time, continuing up to 199. This means the numbers are all the odd numbers between 1 and 199.\n\nNext, I'll determine how many terms are in this sequence. Since the numbers are consecutive odd numbers and the last term is 199, I can find the number of terms using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)d. Here, a₁ is 1, d is 2, and aₙ is 199. Plugging these values into the formula gives n = (199 - 1)/2 + 1 = 100.\n\nNow, to find the sum of these 100 terms, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sₙ = n/2 × (a₁ + aₙ). Substituting the known values, S₁₀₀ = 100/2 × (1 + 199) = 50 × 200 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, I need to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 7. Dividing 10,000 by 7 gives a quotient of 1428 and a remainder of 4. Therefore, the modulo 7 remainder of the sum is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo 7 remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sum is a sequence of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 up to 199.\n   \n2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**\n   - The first term \\(a_1 = 1\\).\n   - The common difference \\(d = 2\\).\n   - The last term \\(a_n = 199\\).\n   \n   Using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\Rightarrow 199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\Rightarrow n = 100\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**\n   The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n"
