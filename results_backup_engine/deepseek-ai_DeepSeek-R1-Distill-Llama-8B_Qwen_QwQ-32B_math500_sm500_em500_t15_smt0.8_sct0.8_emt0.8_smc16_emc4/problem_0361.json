            "output": "First, let's define the number of blue and yellow marbles in the bag at the initial state. Let’s denote the number of blue marbles as \\( B \\) and yellow marbles as \\( Y \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nFrom this equation, we can determine the relationship between \\( B \\) and \\( Y \\):\n\\[\nB = \\frac{4}{3}Y\n\\]\nNext, the problem states that after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles becomes 7:3. This gives us a new equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{B + 5}{Y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expression for \\( B \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}Y + 5}{Y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fractions, multiply both sides of the equation by \\( 3(Y - 3) \\):\n\\[\n3\\left(\\frac{4}{3}Y + 5\\right) = 7(Y - 3)\n\\]\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21\n\\]\nRearranging the terms to solve for \\( Y \\):\n\\[\n15 + 21 = 7Y - 4Y\n\\]\n\\[\n36 = 3Y\n\\]\n\\[\nY = 12\n\\]\nFinally, substitute \\( Y = 12 \\) back into the equation \\( B = \\frac{4}{3}Y \\) to find the number of blue marbles:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 12 = 16\n\\]\nTherefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before any marbles were added or removed.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = Number of blue marbles initially\n- \\( Y \\) = Number of yellow marbles initially\n\n**Given:**\n1.
