There are 12 stamps of this type.\n\nFor France in the 70s, the price is \\$6.00 per stamp. There are 4 stamps of this type.\n\nFor Peru in the 70s, the price is \\$4.00 per stamp. There are 12 stamps of this type.\n\nFor Spain in the 70s, the price is \\$13.00 per stamp. There are 13 stamps of this type.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total price for each country's stamps in the 70s.\n\nFor Brazil: 12 stamps × \\$12.00 = \\$144.00\n\nFor France: 4 stamps × \\$6.00 = \\$24.00\n\nFor Peru: 12 stamps × \\$4.00 = \\$48.00\n\nFor Spain: 13 stamps × \\$13.00 = \\$169.00\n\nAdding these together, the total price for all 70s stamps is \\$144.00 + \\$24.00 + \\$48.00 + \\$169.00 = \\$385.00.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per 70s stamp, I'll divide the total price by the total number of 70s stamps.\n\nTotal number of 70s stamps: 12 + 4 + 12 + 13 = 41 stamps.\n\nAverage price per 70s stamp: \\$385.00 ÷ 41 stamps ≈ \\$9.39 per stamp.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Prices for Each Country's 70s Stamps\nFrom the chart:\n- **Brazil (70s):** \\$12.00 per stamp\n- **France (70s):** \\$6.00 per stamp\n- **Peru (70s):** \\$4.00 per stamp\n- **Spain (70s):** \\$13.00 per stamp\n\n### Step 2: Find the Number of Stamps for Each Country in the 70s\nFrom the chart:\n- **Brazil (70s):** 12 stamps\n- **France (70s):** 4 stamps\n- **Peru (70s):** 12 stamps\n- **"
