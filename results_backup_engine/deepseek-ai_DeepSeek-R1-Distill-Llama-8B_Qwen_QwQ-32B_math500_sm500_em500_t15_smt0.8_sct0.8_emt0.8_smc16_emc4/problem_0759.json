The problem gives me a specific condition involving the terms of the sequence: for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Also, I know that a₁₃ = 2016, and I need to find a₁.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, let me recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences mean. A geometric sequence has each term multiplied by a constant ratio, while an arithmetic sequence has each term added by a constant difference. So, for the first part, a geometric subsequence: for each k, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} = r * a_{2k}, and a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d. Wait, no, the arithmetic part is a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d and then a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d.\n\nBut let me think again. For the geometric subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, that means:\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r_k,\n\nand\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k.\n\nSo each of these geometric subsequences is three terms where each term is multiplied by the same ratio r_k.\n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic subsequences a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, that means:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k,\n\nand\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k.\n\nSo, each term after a_{2k} is the previous term plus some common difference d_k.\n\nBut here's the thing: for each k, these two properties hold. So, for k=1, the first three terms a₁, a₂, a₃ form a geometric sequence. Then, for k=1,"

So the sequence alternates between geometric and arithmetic subsequences every two terms?\n\nWait, actually, let me parse the problem again. The problem says \"for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric\" and \"the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic\". So for each k, the triplet starting at the odd index 2k-1 is geometric, and the triplet starting at the even index 2k is arithmetic. So, overlapping triplets?\n\nYes, so for example, when k=1, the first triplet is a₁, a₂, a₃ (geometric), and the second triplet starting at a₂ is a₂, a₃, a₄ (arithmetic). Then for k=2, the triplet starting at a₃ is a₃, a₄, a₅ (geometric), and the triplet starting at a₄ is a₄, a₅, a₆ (arithmetic). So each term is part of both a geometric and an arithmetic triplet, except maybe the first and last terms?\n\nSo, the key is to find a sequence that satisfies both these conditions. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms must be positive integers, and each term must be larger than the previous one.\n\nGiven that a₁₃ is 2016, we need to work backwards or forwards to find a₁. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here.\n\nLet me try to write down the relations step by step.
