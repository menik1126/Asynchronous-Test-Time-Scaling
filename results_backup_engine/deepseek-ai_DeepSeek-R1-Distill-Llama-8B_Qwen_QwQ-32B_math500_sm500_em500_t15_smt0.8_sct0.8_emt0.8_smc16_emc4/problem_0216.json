The area of a circle is given by the formula \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), so the area of the largest circle is \\(\\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\\).\n\nNext, I'll calculate the area of the middle circle with a radius of 6. Using the same formula, the area is \\(6^2 \\times \\pi = 36\\pi\\).\n\nThen, I'll find the area of the smallest circle, which has a radius of 4. Its area is \\(4^2 \\times \\pi = 16\\pi\\).\n\nNow, I'll determine the areas of the annular regions \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\):\n\n- **Region \\(X\\)**: This is the area between the largest circle (radius 7) and the middle circle (radius 6). So, its area is \\(49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\\).\n  \n- **Region \\(Y\\)**: This region is between the middle circle (radius 6) and the smallest circle (radius 4). Therefore, its area is \\(36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\\).\n  \n- **Region \\(Z\\)**: This is the area of the smallest circle itself, which is \\(16\\pi\\).\n\nComparing the areas, Region \\(Y\\) has the largest area at \\(20\\pi\\), and Region \\(Z\\) has the smallest area at \\(16\\pi\\).\n\nFinally, to find the difference between the largest and smallest regions, I'll subtract the area of Region \\(Z\\) from the area of Region \\(Y\\): \\(20\\pi - 16\\pi = 4\\pi\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step to find the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest regions.\n\n**Given:**\n- Three concentric circles with radii \\(4\\), \\(6\\), and \\(7\\).\n- Regions are labeled \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\).\n\n**Step 1:"
