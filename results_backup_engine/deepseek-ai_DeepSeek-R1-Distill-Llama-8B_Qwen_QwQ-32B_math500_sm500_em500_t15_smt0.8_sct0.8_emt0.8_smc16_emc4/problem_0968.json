The company's policy allows dogs to be reassigned in groups of size \\( x \\).\n\nNext, I'll consider both scenarios mentioned in the problem:\n\n1. **Scenario 1:** Denali gets \\( 4x \\) additional dogs, and Nate stays at \\( 12 \\) dogs.\n   - Denali’s new number of dogs becomes \\( 16 + 4x \\).\n   - Nate’s number of dogs remains \\( 12 \\).\n   \n2. **Scenario 2:** \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n   - Denali’s new number of dogs becomes \\( 16 + x \\).\n   - Nate’s new number of dogs becomes \\( 12 - x \\).\n\nSince the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same in both scenarios, I can set up the ratios for each scenario:\n\n- In **Scenario 1**, the ratio is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n  \\]\n  \n- In **Scenario 2**, the ratio is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n  \\]\n  \nInterestingly, both scenarios lead to the same ratio equation. To find \\( x \\), I'll solve the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = (16 + x)(12)\n\\]\nExpanding both sides:\n\\[\n192 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n-4x^2 + 32x = 12x\n\\]\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\\[\n-4x^2 + 20x = 0\n\\]\nFactoring out \\( -4x \\):\n\\[\n-4x(x - 5) = 0\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), we get \\("

Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
