Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. \n\nAlright, so the equation has a square root in it, which usually means I might have to square both sides at some point to get rid of it. But before that, I should think about the domain because the square root can't be negative, right? So, the expression inside the square root, which is (11 - 2x), has to be greater than or equal to zero. Let me write that down:\n\n11 - 2x ≥ 0.\n\nOkay, so solving for x here. Subtract 11 from both sides: -2x ≥ -11. Then, divide both sides by -2. But wait, when I divide or multiply by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, x ≤ 11/2. That means x has to be less than or equal to 5.5. I should remember that whatever solution I get must satisfy this condition.\n\nNow, back to the equation: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. I need to solve for x. Maybe I can isolate the square root first. Let me subtract 4 from both sides:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x).\n\nHmm, that looks better. Now, to eliminate the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. Let's do that:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2.\n\nSimplifying both sides, squaring the square root just gives me 11 - 2x. So, expanding the left side:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x.\n\nI need to get all the terms on one side to set the equation to zero. Let me subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0.\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nx^2 - 6x +"

            "output": " 5 = 0.\n\nSo, now I have a quadratic equation: x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. Let me see if I can factor this. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Wait, 5 is prime, so the factors would be 1 and 5. But since the middle term is -6x, both numbers need to be negative, right? Because their product is positive and their sum is negative.\n\nSo, if I have (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0. Let me check that: x times x is x squared, x times (-5) is -5x, (-1) times x is -x, and (-1) times (-5) is +5. So, combining the middle terms: -5x -x is -6x. Yep, that's correct. So, the factors are (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. But wait, I need to check these solutions in the original equation because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions that don't actually satisfy the original equation.\n\nLet me check x = 1 first. Plugging it into the original equation:\n\n1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4.\n\nSimplify inside the square root: 11 - 2 = 9. So, √9 is 3.\n\nSo, 1 = 3 + 4? That's 1 = 7. Nope, that's not true. So, x = 1 is an extraneous solution. That means it's not a valid solution for the original equation.\n\nNow, let's check x = 5. Plugging it into the original equation:\n\n5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4.\n\nCalculate inside the square root: 11 - 10 = 1. So, √1 is 1.\n\nSo, 5 = 1 + 4, which is 5 = 5. That works! So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nWait, but I should also ensure that both solutions satisfy the domain condition I found earlier, which was x ≤ 5.5. Both x = 1 and x = 5 are less than 5.5, so that's"

            "output": " good. But since x = 1 didn't work in the original equation, it's not a solution. So, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nLet me just recap what I did. I started by figuring out the domain to know the possible values of x. Then, I isolated the square root and squared both sides to eliminate it. This gave me a quadratic equation, which I factored. The solutions were x = 1 and x = 5. I checked both in the original equation and found that only x = 5 worked. So, that's the only solution.\n\nI think that's all. But just to make sure, let me try plugging x = 5 into the original equation one more time:\n\nLeft side: 5.\n\nRight side: √(11 - 2*5) + 4 = √(11 - 10) + 4 = √1 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nYep, both sides equal 5. So, it's definitely a solution.\n\nOn the other hand, x = 1:\n\nLeft side: 1.\n\nRight side: √(11 - 2*1) + 4 = √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nHmm, 1 doesn't equal 7, so that's not a solution. So, only x = 5 is valid.\n\nI think I considered everything. Maybe I should think if there's another approach, but this seems thorough. I can't think of any other steps I missed. So, yes, the answer is x = 5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Determine the domain:** The expression inside the square root must be non-negative.\n   \\[\n   11 - 2x \\geq 0 \\implies x \\leq \\frac{11}{2} = 5.5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate the square root:**\n   \\[\n   x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Square both sides to eliminate the square root:**\n   \\[\n   (x - 4)^2 = (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 \\implies x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11"
