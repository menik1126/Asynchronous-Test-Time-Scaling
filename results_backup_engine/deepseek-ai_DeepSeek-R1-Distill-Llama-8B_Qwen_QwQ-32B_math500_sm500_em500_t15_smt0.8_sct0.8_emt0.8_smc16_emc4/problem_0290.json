            "output": "Alright, so I have this complex number rotation problem to solve. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. We have two complex numbers, z and c. The complex number z is given as \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i \\). c is another complex number, given by \\( c = 2 - 3i \\). The task is to rotate z around point c by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians counter-clockwise, resulting in a new complex number w. I need to find w.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how complex numbers can be rotated around another point. I remember that in the complex plane, rotating a point z around another point c can be done by translating the complex plane so that c becomes the origin, rotating, and then translating back.\n\nSo, let me write that out step by step. Suppose I have a complex number z that I want to rotate around point c by an angle θ. The formula for that would be:\n\n\\( w = c + (z - c) \\cdot e^{i\\theta} \\)\n\nHere, \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) represents the rotation in the complex plane. Since the rotation is counter-clockwise, the angle θ is positive. In this case, θ is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\).\n\nLet me verify that formula. If I subtract c from z, I translate z so that c becomes the origin, right? Then, multiplying by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) rotates the translated point by θ radians. Then, adding c back translates it back to the original position.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Translate z by subtracting c.\n2. Multiply the result by \\( e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\) to rotate it by π/4.\n3. Then, translate back by adding c.\n\nOkay, so I can represent complex numbers as points in the plane. Each complex number has a real part and an imaginary part, which correspond to the x and y coordinates.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i \\)\nSo, breaking that down, the real part (x-coordinate) is \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\) and the imaginary part (y"

Let me compute \\( z - c \\).\n\nLet me write z as \\( (2 + \\sqrt{2}) + (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2})i \\), so that the real part is \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\), and the imaginary part is \\( -3 - 3\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nSubtracting c (which is 2 - 3i) from z:\n\n\\( z - c = [ (2 + \\sqrt{2}) - 2 ] + [ (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2}) - (-3) ]i \\)\n\nSimplify the real part:\n\n\\( (2 + \\sqrt{2} - 2) = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nImaginary part:\n\n\\( (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2} + 3) = -3\\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal z's real part: 2 + sqrt(2). Subtract c's real part (2): so 2 + sqrt(2) - 2 = sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nImaginary part of z is -3 - 3sqrt(2). Subtract c's imaginary part, which is -3. So, subtracting a negative is adding. So, -3 - 3sqrt(2) - (-3) = -3 -3sqrt(2) +3 = -3sqrt(2). Correct. So, yes, z - c is sqrt(2) - 3sqrt(2)i.\n\nSo, that's the translated point. Now, we need to rotate this by π/4 radians counter-clockwise. The rotation factor is \\( e^{i\\pi/4} \\).\n\nI know that \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\). So, for θ = π/4, that's cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4). Since cos(π/4) = sin"

Maybe using coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the complex numbers as vectors and perform rotation using rotation matrices.\n\nLet me try that method to confirm.\n\nFirst, the rotation of a point around another point can also be done using vectors. Let me consider the coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of z as (x, y) and c as (a, b). Then, the rotation of z around c by θ is given by:\n\nx' = (x - a)cosθ - (y - b)sinθ + a\n\ny' = (x - a)sinθ + (y - b)cosθ + b\n\nSo, using this formula, perhaps I can compute the coordinates step by step.\n\nGiven that z is (2 + sqrt(2), -3 -3sqrt(2)), since the real part is 2 + sqrt(2) and the imaginary part is - (3 + 3sqrt(2)), so the y-coordinate is -3 -3sqrt(2).\n\nc is (2, -3).\n\nSo, let me compute (x - a) and (y - b):\n\nx - a = (2 + sqrt(2)) - 2 = sqrt(2)\n\ny - b = (-3 -3sqrt(2)) - (-3) = -3sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the displacement vector from c to z is (sqrt(2), -3sqrt(2))\n\nNow, we need to rotate this displacement vector by π/4 counter-clockwise.\n\nThe rotation matrix for θ = π/4 is:\n\n[ cosθ  -sinθ ]\n\n[ sinθ   cosθ ]\n\ncos(π/4) = sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071\n\nSo, the rotation matrix becomes:\n\n[ sqrt(2)/2   -sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\n[ sqrt(2)/2    sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nSo, applying this to the displacement vector (sqrt(2), -3sqrt(2)):\n\nFirst component (new x displacement):\n\nsqrt("
