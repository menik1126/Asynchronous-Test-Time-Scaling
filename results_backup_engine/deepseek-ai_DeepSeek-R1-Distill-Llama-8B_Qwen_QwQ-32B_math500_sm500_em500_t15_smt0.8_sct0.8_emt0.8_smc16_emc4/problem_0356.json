            "output": "First, let me define the number of blue marbles as 4x and the number of yellow marbles as 3x, based on the initial ratio of 4:3.\n\nBy adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3. This means the blue marbles are now 7y and the yellow marbles are 3y.\n\nSetting up the equations:\n4x + 5 = 7y\n3x - 3 = 3y\n\nFrom the second equation, I can solve for x:\n3x - 3 = 3y\nDivide both sides by 3:\nx - 1 = y\nSo, y = x - 1\n\nSubstituting y = x - 1 into the first equation:\n4x + 5 = 7(x - 1)\nExpand the right side:\n4x + 5 = 7x - 7\nSubtract 4x from both sides:\n5 = 3x - 7\nAdd 7 to both sides:\n12 = 3x\nDivide by 3:\nx = 4\n\nNow that x is found, substitute back to find the number of blue marbles:\nNumber of blue marbles = 4x = 4 * 4 = 16\n\nTherefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before adding more.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of blue marbles in the bag before adding more, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables Based on the Ratio:**\n   \n   Let the number of blue marbles be \\(4x\\) and the number of yellow marbles be \\(3x\\). This maintains the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles as \\(4:3\\).\n\n2. **Set Up the Equations After Adding and Removing Marbles:**\n   \n   - **After adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles:**\n     - Blue marbles become: \\(4x + 5\\)\n     - Yellow marbles become: \\(3x - 3\\)\n   \n   - The new ratio is given as \\(7:3\\). Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n   \n   Cross-multiplied:\n  "
