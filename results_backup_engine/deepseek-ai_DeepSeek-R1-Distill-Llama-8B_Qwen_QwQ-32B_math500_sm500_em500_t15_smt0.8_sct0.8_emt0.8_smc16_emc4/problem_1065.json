            "output": "To determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, I'll start by calculating the perimeter of the given regular hexagon.\n\nFirst, I know that a regular hexagon has six equal sides, each measuring 16 cm. So, the perimeter of the hexagon is \\(6 \\times 16\\) cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, the perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm. A regular octagon has eight equal sides, so I'll divide 96 cm by 8 to find the length of one side of the octagon.\n\nCalculating this gives me \\(96 \\div 8 = 12\\) cm. Therefore, each side of the regular octagon is 12 cm long.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the length of each side of the regular octagon step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- A regular hexagon with a side length of **16 cm**.\n- The perimeter of the hexagon is equal to the perimeter of a regular octagon.\n\n**Steps to Find the Side Length of the Octagon:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   A regular hexagon has **6** equal sides.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times \\text{side length} = 6 \\times 16 = 96 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Since the Perimeters Are Equal:**\n   \n   The perimeter of the regular octagon is also **96 cm**.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Sides in a Regular Octagon:**\n   \n   A regular octagon has **8** equal sides.\n\n4. **Calculate the Side Length of the Octagon:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Side length of octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{\\text{Number of sides}} = \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe length of each side of the regular octagon is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) cm."
