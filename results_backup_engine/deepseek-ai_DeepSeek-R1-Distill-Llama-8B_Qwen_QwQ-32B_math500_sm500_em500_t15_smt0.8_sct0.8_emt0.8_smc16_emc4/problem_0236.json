Then, he walks three-fourths of a mile east. Finally, he walks another half a mile south, making a total of one mile south.\n\nNext, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point. The distance south is one mile, and the distance east is three-fourths of a mile.\n\nApplying the formula, the straight-line distance is the square root of (1 squared plus (3/4) squared), which equals the square root of 1.52.\n\nFinally, I'll convert this to a decimal to the nearest hundredth, resulting in approximately 1.22 miles.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how far Bill is from his starting point, we'll break his journey into components and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Total Displacement in Each Direction**\n\n1. **South Displacement:**\n   - First, Bill walks \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - Then, he walks another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - **Total South Displacement:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile.\n\n2. **East Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n   - **Total East Displacement:** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile.\n\n### **Step 2: Use Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nNow, we'll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from the starting point:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{East Displacement})^2 + (\\text{South Displacement})^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 + (1)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rounded to the nearest hundredth: } 1.25 \\approx 1.25\n\\]\n\n### **"

Let me recalculate the Pythagorean theorem step carefully:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{16} \\approx 0.5625\n\\]\n\\[\n1^2 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 0.5625 + 1 = 1.5625\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1.5625} = 1.25\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.
