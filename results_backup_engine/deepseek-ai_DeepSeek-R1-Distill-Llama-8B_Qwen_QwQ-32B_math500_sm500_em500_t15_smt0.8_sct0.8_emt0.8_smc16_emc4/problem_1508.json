            "output": "First, determine the number of possible combinations for the letters. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet and each letter must be different, the first letter can be any of the 26 letters. For the second letter, there are 25 remaining choices.\n\nNext, consider the numbers. Each number can range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible digits for each of the two number positions. Additionally, the digits must be different, so the first digit has 10 choices, and the second digit has 9 remaining choices.\n\nMultiply the number of options for the letters by the number of options for the digits to find the total number of possible license plates. This involves calculating 26 times 25 for the letters and 10 times 9 for the digits, then multiplying these two results together to get the final total.\n\nThus, the total number of license plates that can be formed under these conditions is 26 multiplied by 25 multiplied by 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 26,250.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Letters:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).\n   - Each license plate requires **2 different letters**.\n   \n   Number of ways to choose the letters:\n   \\[\n   26 \\times 25 = 650\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Numbers:**\n   - Each digit can be **0-9**, giving **10** possible choices.\n   - The two numbers must be **different**.\n   \n   Number of ways to choose the numbers:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 9 = 90\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Total Number of License Plates:**\n   - Multiply the number of combinations for letters and numbers.\n   \\[\n   650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{58,\\!500}\n\\]"
