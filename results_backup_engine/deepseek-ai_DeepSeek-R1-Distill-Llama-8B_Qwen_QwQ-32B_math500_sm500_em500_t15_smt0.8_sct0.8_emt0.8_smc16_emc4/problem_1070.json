            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the number of sides by the length of one side. A hexagon has 6 sides, so the perimeter is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, I know that the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon. To find the length of each side of the octagon, I should divide the total perimeter of the hexagon by the number of sides of the octagon. An octagon has 8 sides, so dividing 96 cm by 8 gives the length of each side of the octagon as 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\ \\text{cm} = 96\\ \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the perimeter of the regular octagon.**\n   \n   - Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 96\\ \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the length of each side of the regular octagon.**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Side length of octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{8} = \\frac{96\\ \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\ \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** Each side of the octagon is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) centimeters long."
