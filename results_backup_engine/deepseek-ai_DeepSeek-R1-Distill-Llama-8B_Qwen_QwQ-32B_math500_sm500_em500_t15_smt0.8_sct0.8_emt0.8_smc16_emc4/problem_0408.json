Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, each gear's rotations per second are obtained by dividing the rotations per minute by 60.\n\nNext, I'll express the rotations in terms of a common fraction to make it easier to find a common multiple. The first gear rotates \\(33 \\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute, which is equivalent to \\(\\frac{100}{3}\\) rotations per minute. The second gear rotates 45 times per minute, which is the same as 45 rotations per minute.\n\nTo find when both gears will align their marks north, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods. This means I'll first convert the LCM from minutes to seconds by multiplying by 60.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the LCM of \\(\\frac{100}{3}\\) and 45. After finding the LCM in rotations, I'll convert it back to seconds to determine the time required for both gears to point north again.\n</think>\n\nTo determine after how many seconds the two gears will next have their marks pointing due north, we'll analyze their rotation rates and find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Rotation Rates\n- **First Gear:** Turns \\( 33 \\frac{1}{3} \\) times per minute.\n- **Second Gear:** Turns \\( 45 \\) times per minute.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Rotations to a Common Time Unit\nSince we're working in seconds, let's convert the rotations per minute to rotations per second.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rotations per Second} = \\frac{\\text{Rotations per Minute}}{60}\n\\]\n\n- **First Gear Rotations per Second (RPS):**\n\\[\n\\frac{33 \\frac{1}{3}}{60} = \\frac{100}{3 \\times 60} = \\frac{100}{180} = \\frac{5}{9} \\text{ rotations per second}\n\\]\n\n- **Second Gear Rotations per Second (RPS):**\n\\[\n\\frac{45}{60} = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ rotations per second}\n\\]\n\n### Step"

However, LCM is typically calculated for integers. Convert periods to fractions:\n\n- \\( T_1 = \\frac{9}{5} \\) seconds\n- \\( T_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds\n\nThe LCM of two fractions is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}\\left(\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}\\right) = \\frac{\\text{LCM}(a, c)}{\\text{GCD}(b, d)}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 9 \\), \\( b = 5 \\), \\( c = 4 \\), \\( d = 3 \\).\n\n- **LCM of numerators (9 and 4):**\n  - Prime factors of 9: \\( 3^2 \\)\n  - Prime factors of 4: \\( 2^2 \\)\n  - LCM = \\( 2^2 \\times 3^2 = 36 \\)\n\n- **GCD of denominators (5 and 3):**\n  - GCD(5, 3) = 1\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}\\left(\\frac{9}{5}, \\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{36}{1} = 36 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Verify with Alternative Approach (LCM of Rotations)\nAlternatively, find LCM of rotations in a minute and convert to seconds:\n\n- **Rotations per minute:**\n  - First gear: \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\)\n  - Second gear: \\( 45 \\)\n\n- **LCM of rotations:**\n "

There might be a confusion in the approach. Let's clarify.\n\n**Correction:**\n\nWhen considering LCM of rotations, it's better to work with rotations per second.\n\n- **Rotations per Second:**\n  - First gear: \\( \\frac{5}{9} \\)\n  - Second gear: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n\n- **LCM of Rotations per Second:**\n  - Convert to fractions:\n    - \\( \\frac{5}{9} \\) and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n  - LCM of fractions is \\( \\frac{LCM(5, 3)}{GCD(9, 4)} = \\frac{15}{1} = 15 \\) rotations per second.\n\n- **Time for 15 rotations:**\n  - First gear time per rotation: \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) seconds\n  - Total time: \\( 15 \\times \\frac{9}{5} = 27 \\) seconds.\n\n- **Second gear time per rotation: \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds**\n  - Total time: \\( 15 \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 20 \\) seconds.\n\nHowever, since they rotate at different rates, we need a common multiple. This indicates a conflict in methods.\n\n**Alternative Correct Approach:**\n\nInstead of working with fractions, keep rotations per minute:\n\n- **First Gear:** \\( 33 \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\) rotations per minute\n- **Second Gear:** \\( 45 \\) rotations per minute\n\n- **Find LCM of \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\) and \\( 45 \\):**\n  - Convert to common denominators:\n    - \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\"

Clearly, there's confusion in approach.\n\n**Correct Method:**\n\nThe correct approach is to find the LCM of their periods in seconds.\n\n- **First Gear Period:** \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) seconds per rotation\n- **Second Gear Period:** \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds per rotation\n\nTo find LCM of \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\):\n\n- LCM of numerators (9 and 4): 36\n- GCD of denominators (5 and 3): 1\n- LCM = \\( \\frac{36}{1} = 36 \\) seconds\n\nThis matches the first method.
