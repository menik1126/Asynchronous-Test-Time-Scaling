            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since a regular hexagon has six equal sides, the perimeter is 6 multiplied by the side length of the hexagon.\n\nGiven that each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, I calculate the perimeter as 6 × 16 cm = 96 cm.\n\nNext, I need to find the perimeter of the regular octagon, which is equal to that of the hexagon. Therefore, the perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm.\n\nSince a regular octagon has eight equal sides, I divide the total perimeter by 8 to find the length of each side of the octagon.\n\nSo, the length of each side is 96 cm ÷ 8 = 12 cm.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.\n   - Given that each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**, the perimeter \\( P_{\\text{hexagon}} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Set the Perimeter of the Octagon Equal to That of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   - Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{octagon}} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Length of Each Side of the Octagon:**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has 8 equal sides.\n   - Therefore, to find the length of one side \\( s \\) of the octagon:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{P_{\\text{octagon}}}{8} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
