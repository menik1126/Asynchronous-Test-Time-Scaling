The first gear makes \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) revolutions in a minute, which is \\(\\frac{33.333...}{60} \\approx 0.5556\\) revolutions per second. The second gear makes 45 revolutions in a minute, so its speed is \\(\\frac{45}{60} = 0.75\\) revolutions per second.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the time it takes for both gears to return to the same position after aligning. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods. The periods are \\(\\frac{1}{0.5556} \\approx 1.8\\) seconds and \\(\\frac{1}{0.75} \\approx 1.\\overline{3}\\) seconds.\n\nTo find the LCM of 1.8 and 1.\\overline{3}, I'll convert them to fractions. \\(1.8\\) seconds is \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) and \\(1.\\overline{3}\\) is \\(\\frac{10}{9}\\). The LCM of \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{10}{9}\\) is \\(\\frac{90}{45} = 2\\) seconds, since both gears will realign after 2 seconds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine when the two gears will next align with their marks pointing due north, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert Rotational Speeds to Revolutions per Second**\n   - **First Gear:** \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) revolutions per minute.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revolutions per second} = \\frac{33\\frac{1}{3}}{60} = \\frac{100}{3 \\times 60} = \\frac{100}{180} = \\frac{5}{9} \\text{ rev/s}\n     \\]\n   - **Second Gear:** 45 revolutions per minute.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revolutions per second} = \\frac{45}{60} = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ rev/s}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**\n   - Let \\(T_1 = \\frac{5}{9}\\) and \\(T_2 = \\frac{3}{"

The period \\(P\\) of each gear is the reciprocal of its revolutions per second:\n     \\[\n     P_1 = \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{9}{5} \\text{ seconds}, \\quad P_2 = \\frac{1}{T_2} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n   - Convert periods to fractions:\n     \\[\n     P_1 = \\frac{9}{5}, \\quad P_2 = \\frac{4}{3}\n     \\]\n   - LCM of fractions is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{LCM}\\left(\\frac{9}{5}, \\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\text{LCM}(9, 4)}{\\text{GCD}(5, 3)} = \\frac{36}{1} = 36 \\text{ seconds}\n     \\]\n   - Wait, this contradicts the initial thought. Let me recheck:\n     - LCM of numerators (9 and 4) is 36.\n     - GCD of denominators (5 and 3) is 1.\n     - Thus, LCM is \\(36/1 = 36\\) seconds. But this seems off.
