            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the cube root of the square root of the square root of 1/729. Hmm, let me write this down step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst off, the expression is: √(∛(√(1/729))). That seems a bit nested, but I think I can tackle it one layer at a time. Let me start from the innermost part, which is the square root of 1/729.\n\nSo, √(1/729). I know that the square root of a fraction is the same as the square root of the numerator over the square root of the denominator. The numerator is 1, so its square root is 1. The denominator is 729. What is the square root of 729? Hmm, I remember that 27 squared is 729 because 27 times 27 is 729. So, √729 is 27. Therefore, √(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nNow, the next layer is the cube root of that result. So, ∛(1/27). Again, since it's a cube root of a fraction, I can separate the numerator and denominator. The cube root of 1 is 1, and what's the cube root of 27? Well, 3 cubed is 27, so ∛27 is 3. Therefore, ∛(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nAlright, now I have the outermost layer: another square root of 1/3. So, √(1/3). Using the same logic as before, the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 3 is √3. So, √(1/3) is 1/√3.\n\nWait, but the problem says to write it with a rational denominator. Right now, I have 1 over root 3, which is irrational. I need to rationalize the denominator. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by √3. So, (1 * √3) / (√3 * √3) = √3 / 3. So, 1/√3 is equivalent to √3/3.\n\nPutting it all together, let me recap:\n\n1. Start with √(1/729). That’s 1/27.\n2. Then take the cube root"

Finally, take the square root of 1/3, which becomes √3/3 after rationalizing.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to √3 divided by 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the innermost radical: √(1/729). Yes, 729 is 27 squared, so √729 is 27, making it 1/27. Correct.\n\nThen, the cube root of 1/27. Since 27 is 3 cubed, cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 27 is 3, so 1/3. That seems right.\n\nNext, the square root of 1/3. Square root of 1 is 1, square root of 3 is √3, giving 1/√3. Rationalizing by multiplying numerator and denominator by √3 gives √3/3. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, all steps check out. So, the simplified form with a rational denominator is √3 divided by 3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression step-by-step:\n\nStarting with the innermost radical:\n1. Compute the square root of 1/729:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}\n   \\]\n2. Compute the cube root of 1/27:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{1}}{\\sqrt[3]{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n3. Compute the square root of 1/3:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n4. Rationalize the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the simplified expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}\n\\]"
