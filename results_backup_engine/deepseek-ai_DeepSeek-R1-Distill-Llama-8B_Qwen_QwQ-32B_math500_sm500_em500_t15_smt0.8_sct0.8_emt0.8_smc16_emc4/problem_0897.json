            "output": "Okay, so I need to convert the fraction 21 divided by (2 squared times 5 to the seventh power) into a terminating decimal. Hmm, I remember something about fractions terminating if the denominator has only 2s and 5s after simplifying. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I should probably factor the denominator to see if it can be broken down into just 2s and 5s. The denominator is 2 squared times 5 to the seventh power. So that's 2² * 5⁷. That already seems in the form with only 2s and 5s, right? So maybe I don't need to do anything else with the denominator.\n\nBut wait, the numerator is 21. Maybe I should check if the fraction can be simplified. The numerator is 21, which factors into 3 * 7. The denominator is 2² * 5⁷, so there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator. That means the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nNow, to convert it into a terminating decimal. I remember the rule: a fraction will be a terminating decimal if the denominator has only 2s and 5s after simplifying, which it does here. The number of decimal places will be equal to the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of the denominator.\n\nIn this case, the denominator has 2 squared and 5 to the seventh. So, the maximum exponent is 7. That means the decimal will terminate after 7 decimal places. But wait, I think that's not the whole story. Let me think more carefully.\n\nActually, the number of decimal places isn't necessarily equal to the maximum exponent. It's more about how many times you multiply by 2 or 5 to make the denominator a power of 10, which is 2*5. Since 10^n will give you n decimal places.\n\nSo, to convert the denominator to a power of 10, I can adjust the powers of 2 and 5 so that they are equal. Right now, the denominator is 2² * 5⁷. To make it a power of 10, I need to multiply by 2⁷ to make it 2⁷ * 5⁷, which is 10⁷.\n\nSo, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2⁷ to"

If I multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7-2) = 2^5, then the denominator becomes 2^(2+5) *5^7 = 2^7 *5^7 =10^7. Wait, actually, 2^2 *5^7 multiplied by 2^5 would be 2^(2+5)*5^7 = 2^7 *5^7 = (2*5)^7 =10^7. Yes, that's right. So I need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5 to get the denominator to 10^7.\n\nTherefore, the numerator becomes 21 * 2^5. Let me compute that. 2^5 is 32. So 21 *32. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 20*32 is 640, and 1*32 is 32, so total is 640 +32 = 672. So the numerator is 672, denominator is 10^7.\n\nTherefore, the fraction becomes 672 / 10^7. To write that as a decimal, it's 0.0000672. Wait, let me check that. 10^7 is 10,000,000. So 672 divided by 10,000,000. Moving the decimal point seven places to the left: 672 is 6.72 x 10^2, so divided by 10^7 would be 6.72 x 10^(2-7) = 6.72 x 10^-5, which is 0.0000672. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me count the decimal places. 10^7 has seven zeros, so dividing by 10^7 moves the decimal seven places left. Starting"

            "output": " from 672, which is 672.000000, moving the decimal seven places left: 672.000000 becomes 0.0000672. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the decimal representation is 0.0000672. Let me just confirm that I didn't make any mistakes in multiplying 21 by 32. 21 times 30 is 630, and 21 times 2 is 42. Adding them gives 630 +42 = 672. That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the fraction 21/(2² *5⁷) is equal to 672/10⁷, which is 0.0000672.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I should check the original fraction and its decimal value. Let me calculate 21 divided by (4*78125). Because 2² is 4, and 5⁷ is 78125 (since 5^1=5, 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125, 5^6=15625, 5^7=78125). So denominator is 4*78125 = 312500.\n\nSo 21 divided by 312500. Let me compute that. 312500 goes into 21 zero times. So we have 0., and then we can add decimal places.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute this as 21 ÷ 312500.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use calculator-like steps. Let me see:\n\n312500 x 0.0001 = 31.25\n\n312500 x 0.00002 = 6.25\n\n312500 x 0.000006 = approximately 1.875\n\nWait, so 0.00002 *312500=6.25, and 21 is double that. So 0.00002 *2=0.00004, so 6.25*2=12.5. Wait, but we need to get 21.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach. Let me express 672 /10,000,000 as a division.\n\nBut 672 /10,000,000 is the same as 0.0000672, which is what I previously got, so that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let me use another method.

            "output": ", and the numerator is 21, which is 3*7, so there's no simplification. So to make denominator 10^7, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(5) as before, so that the denominator becomes 2^7 *5^7 =10^7. So numerator is 21*32=672, so 672/10^7 is indeed 0.0000672.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0.0000672, which in boxed form is \\boxed{0.0000672}\n\nWait, but let me check if the decimal is terminating. Since the denominator is 10^7, which is a power of 10, the decimal must terminate after 7 digits. The result I have is 0.0000672, which is 7 decimal places. Let me count the digits after the decimal: 0 (1), 0 (2), 0 (3), 0 (4), 6 (5), 7 (6), 2 (7). Yes, exactly seven digits. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as 0.0000672, but sometimes leading zeros are omitted, but in decimal notation, it's standard to have the leading zeros up to the first non-zero digit. So 0.0000672 is correct.\n\nHmm, I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. So the final answer is 0.0000672.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0.0000672}\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the denominator**: The denominator is already in the form \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\), which consists only of the prime factors 2 and 5. This confirms the fraction will convert to a terminating decimal.\n\n2. **Simplify the fraction**: The numerator 21 (which factors into \\(3 \\cdot 7\\)) and the denominator \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\) have no common factors, so the fraction is"
