            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a complex number w. The problem says that w is the result when z is rotated around c by π/4 counter-clockwise. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. The complex number z is given as z = 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i. And c is given as c = 2 - 3i. So, z is 2 + sqrt(2) minus (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i, which means in standard form, it's (2 + sqrt(2)) + (-3 - 3 sqrt(2))i. And c is 2 - 3i.\n\nI remember that rotating a complex number around another complex number can be done by translating the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, then applying the rotation, and then translating back. So, the general formula for rotating a point z around c by an angle θ is:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^(iθ)\n\nThat formula makes sense because you subtract the center, rotate, and then add back the center. Since we are rotating by π/4, θ is π/4 radians, which is 45 degrees.\n\nSo, let's compute each part step by step. First, let me compute z - c. z is (2 + sqrt(2)) + (-3 - 3 sqrt(2))i, and c is 2 - 3i. So subtracting c from z gives:\n\nz - c = [(2 + sqrt(2)) - 2] + [(-3 - 3 sqrt(2)) - (-3)]i\n= (sqrt(2)) + (-3 sqrt(2))i\n\nSo, z - c simplifies to sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2)i. I can factor out sqrt(2) to make it sqrt(2)(1 - 3i).\n\nNow, the next part is to multiply this by e^(iπ/4). Remembering that e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ. For θ = π/4, cos(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2. So, e^(iπ/4) = (sqrt(2)/"

Let me compute this multiplication.\n\nFirst, I can distribute the multiplication:\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)*i sqrt(2)/2 - 3i*sqrt(2)/2 - 3i*i sqrt(2)/2\n\nWait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, since both factors have sqrt(2), I can factor that out and compute [sqrt(2)^2/2 (1 - 3i) + i sqrt(2)^2/2 (1 - 3i)]. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to multiply each term separately.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n= sqrt(2)*(1 - 3i) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2)\n= sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 - 3i) + sqrt(2)*i sqrt(2)/2 (1 - 3i)\n= (2/2)(1 - 3i) + (2)/2 i (1 - 3i)\n= (1 - 3i) + i(1 - 3i)\n\nNow, let me compute that. Let's expand each term:\n\n1 - 3i + i - 3i^2\n\nNow, since i^2 = -1, so -3i^2 = -3*(-1) = 3.\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n1 + 3 + (-3i + i)\n= 4 - 2i\n\nSo, (z - c) * e^(iπ/4) = 4 - 2i.\n\nWait, that seems okay, but let me verify the multiplication step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the first part, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = 2/2 = 1, which is correct. The next term is sqrt(2)*i sqrt(2)/2, which is (2i)/2 = i. So that term becomes i*(1 - 3i). Wait, actually, is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up that part."

Then A * B is:\n\nsqrt(2)*(1 - 3i) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i)\n\nBecause sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i). So, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 is (2)/2 = 1. So, A*B = (1)*(1 - 3i)(1 + i)\n\nAh, that's a better way to see it. So, (1 - 3i)(1 + i) is the key multiplication here.\n\nLet me compute (1 - 3i)(1 + i):\n\nMultiply the two binomials:\n\n1*1 + 1*i - 3i*1 - 3i*i\n\n= 1 + i - 3i - 3i²\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 - 2i - 3(-1) = 1 - 2i + 3 = 4 - 2i\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.

Compute e^(iπ/4) = cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2\n\n5. Multiply sqrt(2)(1 - 3i) by sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nFactor sqrt(2) out:\n\nsqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)(1 - 3i) + sqrt(2)*(i sqrt(2)/2)(1 - 3i)\n\nWhich is:\n\n(2/2)(1 - 3i) + (2i/2)(1 - 3i) = (1 - 3i) + i(1 - 3i)\n\nNow, compute (1 - 3i) + i(1 - 3i)\n\n= 1 - 3i + i - 3i^2\n\n= 1 + 0i - 3i^2\n\nSince i^2 = -1, so -3i^2 = 3\n\nThus, 1 + 3 = 4, and the imaginary part is -3i + i = -2i.

Let me check if I computed e^(iπ/4) correctly. Since cos(π/4) and sin(π/4) are both sqrt(2)/2, so yes, e^(iπ/4) is sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, alternatively, is there another way to approach this problem, perhaps by using the rotation matrix?\n\nYes, I can represent the rotation as a matrix multiplication.

Since we are rotating around point c, we first translate the point z to the origin relative to c, then apply the rotation matrix, then translate back.\n\nLet me try this method to confirm.\n\nFirst, the coordinates of z and c. Let me write z as (x, y) and c as (a, b). Then, the rotation formula is:\n\nw_x = (x - a)cosθ - (y - b)sinθ + a\n\nw_y = (x - a)sinθ + (y - b)cosθ + b\n\nSo, let's compute coordinates.\n\nFirst, z is given as 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i. So, in terms of coordinates, the real part is 2 + sqrt(2), and the imaginary part is -(3 + 3 sqrt(2)), so the coordinates are (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3 sqrt(2)).\n\nc is 2 - 3i, so coordinates (2, -3).\n\nTherefore, the vector from c to z is ( (2 + sqrt(2) - 2), (-3 - 3 sqrt(2) - (-3)) ) = (sqrt(2), -3 sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the displacement vector is (sqrt(2), -3 sqrt(2)).\n\nNow, applying rotation by π/4 (45 degrees).

That makes me confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I'm rotating around c, I didn't make a mistake in the direction. Since it's a counter-clockwise rotation, which corresponds to positive angle in the complex plane. So, in the formula w = c + (z - c)*e^(iθ), θ being positive π/4 should give the correct rotation.\n\nI think that's correct because in the Asymptote code, the rotation is done correctly, but perhaps I should check.\n\nWait, to be thorough, let me consider the Asymptote code provided. It shows a rotation of 45 degrees around point c. The Asymptote code shows that z is at the point (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3 sqrt(2)), which is consistent with our calculations, and c is at (2, -3). When you rotate z around c by 45 degrees, you should get w at (6, -5), which is 6 -5i.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the answer is w = 6 - 5i.\n\nWait, before finalizing, let me just recap:\n\n1. Translate z by subtracting c: sqrt(2) -3 sqrt(2)i.\n\n2. Multiply by e^(iπ/4): which gives 4 -2i.\n\n3. Translate back by adding c: 4 -2i +2 -3i =6 -5i.\n\nAlternatively, using rotation matrix, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is w =6 -5i, which in the box"
