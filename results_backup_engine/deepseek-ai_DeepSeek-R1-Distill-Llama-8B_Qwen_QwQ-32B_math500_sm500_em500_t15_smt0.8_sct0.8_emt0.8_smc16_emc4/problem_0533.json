Therefore, Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\nBy multiplying the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has, we get 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order without choosing the same dish.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**\nYann and Camille go to a restaurant. If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what—Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Total Number of Dishes:**\n   - There are **10** different dishes available on the menu.\n\n2. **Yann's Choice:**\n   - Yann can choose **any** of the 10 dishes.\n\n3. **Camille's Choice:**\n   - Camille cannot choose the **same** dish as Yann.\n   - Therefore, after Yann has chosen, Camille has **9** remaining options.\n\n4. **Calculating Combinations:**\n   - Since the order matters (Yann and Camille are distinct individuals), we can use the **multiplication principle**.\n   - Yann has **10** choices, and for each of Yann's choices, Camille has **9** choices.\n   - Total combinations = 10 × 9 = **90**\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{90}"
