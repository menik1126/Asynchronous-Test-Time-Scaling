The prime factors are 2, 2, 3, and 7. This gives me the prime factorization of 84 as \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n\nNext, I'll consider the smallest possible integers that can multiply together to give 84. Starting with 1, the next integer should be the smallest possible factor of 84. \n\nI'll try different combinations:\n- \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\\), and the sum is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 13\\).\n- Another combination is \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\), but this includes duplicate numbers, which isn't allowed since the integers must be distinct.\n\nAfter evaluating these options, the set \\(1, 2, 3, 7\\) provides the distinct integers with the smallest sum of 13.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize 84\nFirst, we factorize 84 into its prime factors:\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\nThis can be written as:\n\\[\n84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Smallest Integers\nOur goal is to find distinct positive integers whose product is 84 and whose sum is minimized. We start by listing the factors of 84 and finding the smallest set of integers that multiply to 84.\n\n#### Possible Combinations:\n1. **Using 1:**\n   - \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\\)\n     - **Sum:** \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 13\\)\n   \n2. **Using 1 and Repeated Factors:**\n   - \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\\)\n     - However, this includes duplicate integers, which is not allowed since the integers must be distinct.\n\n### Step 3:"
