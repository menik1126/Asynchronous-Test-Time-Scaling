Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes higher-degree polynomials can be factored by recognizing them as a form of a quadratic in terms of a substitution. In this case, the polynomial is \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). I notice that \\( x^8 \\) is \\( (x^4)^2 \\), so maybe I can let \\( y = x^4 \\) to reduce it to a quadratic equation.\n\nSo, substituting \\( y = x^4 \\), the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Now, I need to factor this quadratic equation. Let me see if it factors nicely.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), that becomes \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nNow, I have two quartic polynomials: \\( x^4 + 4 \\) and \\( x^4 - 1 \\). I need to factor these further if possible. Let's start with \\( x^4 - 1 \\). I recall that it's a difference of squares because \\( x^8 - 1 \\) would be a difference of squares, but here it's \\( x^4 - 1 \\), which is \\( (x^2)^2 - 1^2 \\). So, that factors into \\( (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\). \n\nThen, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) can be factored further into \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\). So putting that together, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nNow, looking at \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm,"

Wait, but maybe it can be factored into quadratics. Let me recall the identity for sum of squares: \\( a^2 + b^2 = (a + b i)(a - b i) \\), but that's over complex numbers. I need factors with integer coefficients.\n\nOh, right! There's a formula called the Sophie Germain identity, which allows factoring \\( a^4 + 4b^4 \\) into two quadratics. In this case, \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored as \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\). Let me check that:\n\nMultiply \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\):\n- First, multiply \\( x^2 \\) with each term: \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\), \\( x^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3 \\), \\( x^2 * 2 = 2x^2 \\)\n- Then, \\( 2x * x^2 = 2x^3 \\), \\( 2x * (-2x) = -4x^2 \\), \\( 2x * 2 = 4x \\)\n- Finally, \\( 2 * x^2 = 2x^2 \\), \\( 2 * (-2x) = -4x \\), \\( 2 * 2 = 4 \\)\nNow, let me add all these up:\n\n\\( x^4 -2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 -4x^2 +4x + 2x^2 -4x +4 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( (-2x^3 + 2x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( (2x^2 -4x^2 + 2x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( (4x -4x) = 0 \\)\n- Constant term is 4.\n\nWait, that gives me \\( x^4 + 4 \\), which"

So, yes, \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nSo now, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\)\n\nNow, check if any of these factors can be factored further. Let's see:\n\n- \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\): discriminant is \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), so no real roots, hence cannot be factored further over integers.\n- \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\): same discriminant, also irreducible.\n- \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\) are linear, so they can't be factored further.\n- \\( x^2 + 1 \\): discriminant is \\( 0 - 4 = -4 \\), also irreducible.\n\nSo, all factors are irreducible over integers.
