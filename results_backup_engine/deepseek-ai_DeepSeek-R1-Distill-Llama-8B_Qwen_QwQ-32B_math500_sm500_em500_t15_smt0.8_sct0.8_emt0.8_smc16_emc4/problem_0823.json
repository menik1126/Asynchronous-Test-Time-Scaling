I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, ω can be either of the non-real cube roots of 1.\n\nI also recall that the cube roots of unity satisfy the equation ω³ = 1, which can be factored as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. Since ω ≠ 1, it must satisfy the quadratic equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0. That means ω² = -ω - 1. Maybe I can use this later on.\n\nLooking at the expression I need to evaluate: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Since ω² is another root, perhaps I can express this in terms of ω.\n\nLet me compute each term separately. Starting with the first term, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\). Maybe I can rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by something. For the cube roots, sometimes multiplying by conjugate helps.\n\nI remember that for complex numbers, \\(1 + \\omega\\) and \\(1 + \\omega²\\) might have some relationships. Let's see what \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega²\\) is equal to. From the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0, we know that 1 + ω + ω² = 0. So, that sum is zero.\n\nHmm, so if I take \\(1 + \\omega\\) and multiply it by \\(1 + ω²\\), maybe? Let's try that:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega²) = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\omega² + \\omega \\cdot 1 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega²\n\\]\nSimplify each term:\n\n1*1 = 1\n\n1*ω² = ω²\n\nω*1 = ω\n\nω*ω²"

            "output": " = ω³\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = (1 + 1) + ω + ω² = 2 + (ω + ω²)\n\nBut from earlier, we know ω² + ω = -1 because ω² + ω + 1 = 0. So,\n\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\nTherefore, (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1\n\nThat's useful! So, maybe I can use this in simplifying the expression.\n\nNow, let's get back to the original expression:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\)\n\nI can combine these two fractions. The common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²), which we just found is equal to 1.\n\nSo, let me write it as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nThe denominator is 1, as we found earlier. So, the numerator is:\n\n(1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nAgain, using the fact that ω² + ω = -1, so numerator becomes:\n\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1}\\) = 1\n\nWait, but hold on. Is this the only value?\n\nWait, ω can be either ω or ω², right? But from the expression, regardless of which root we choose, the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\) evaluates to 1. Because in both cases, ω and ω² are just conjugates of each other, so swapping them doesn't change the sum.\n\nLet me verify with an example. Let's take ω = e^(2πi/3) which is equal to -1/2 + i√3/2. Then ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1"

What about ω = 1?\n\nIf ω = 1, then expression becomes:\n\n1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\n\nSo, even when ω = 1, the expression equals 1. Therefore, in both cases, whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root, the expression evaluates to 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of the expression is 1.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 1.\n</think>\n\nThe value of the expression is always 1, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is chosen.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
