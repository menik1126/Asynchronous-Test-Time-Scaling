Proper divisors are numbers less than 284 that divide it without leaving a remainder.\n\nI'll begin by checking if 284 is even. Since it is, 2 is a divisor.\n\nNext, I'll check for other even divisors: 4, 6, and so on, until I find that 284 divided by 4 is 71, which is a prime number.\n\nFinally, I'll consider the prime number 71 and its multiple, which is 71 itself. Therefore, the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nNow, I'll sum these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220.\n\nThe next step is to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220.\n\nI'll start by listing all the proper divisors of 220. They include 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, and 143.\n\nAdding these together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 + 143 equals 505.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 505.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Use that sum to find the sum of its proper divisors.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284**\n\n**Step 1.1:** Identify all proper divisors of **284** (divisors less than 284).\n\n- **1** is always a proper divisor.\n- **2** is a proper divisor since 284 is even.\n- **4** is a proper divisor.\n- **71** is a proper divisor because 284 ÷ 4 = 71, and 71 is a prime number.\n- **142** is also a proper divisor (since 142 × 2 = 284).\n"
