            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: x⁴ + 5x³ + 9x² - x - 14 = 0. I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, integer roots... that means I'm looking for whole numbers, positive or negative, that satisfy this equation when plugged in for x. \n\nI remember something called the Rational Root Theorem, which is useful for finding possible rational roots of a polynomial equation. The theorem states that any rational root, expressed in its lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the equation is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, and the leading coefficient is 1 for the x⁴ term. So, the denominator q would be 1, meaning possible roots are just the factors of the constant term, which is -14.\n\nAlright, so the possible integer roots are the factors of -14. Let me list those out. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, 14, and their negative counterparts: -1, -2, -7, -14. So my possible integer roots are: -14, -7, -2, -1, 1, 2, 7, 14.\n\nNow, I need to test each of these candidates to see if they make the equation equal to zero. I can do this by substituting each value into the polynomial and calculating the result. If the result is zero, that number is an integer root.\n\nLet me start with the smallest absolute value, just to see if any simple roots exist. Let's try x = 1 first. Plugging in:\n\n1⁴ + 5(1)³ + 9(1)² - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14. Calculating step by step: 1 + 5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0. Oh, wow, so x=1 is a root! That's one integer root down.\n\nNext, maybe x = -1? Let's see:\n\n(-1)⁴ + 5(-1)³ + 9(-1)² - (-1) - 14. Calculating each term: 1 (since negative to the fourth is positive"

Not zero, so x=-1 is not a root.\n\nHow about x=2? Let's test:\n\n2⁴ + 5(2)³ + 9(2)² - 2 -14. Compute each term: 16 + 5*8 + 9*4 -2 -14. So 16 +40=56, plus 36=92, minus 2=90, minus14=76. Nope, that's 76, not zero.\n\nWhat about x=-2? Let's check:\n\n(-2)⁴ +5*(-2)^3 +9*(-2)^2 - (-2) -14. So 16 +5*(-8)+9*4 +2 -14. Calculating: 16-40= -24, +36=12, +2=14, -14=0. Oh! x=-2 is another root. Nice.\n\nSo far, we've got x=1 and x=-2 as roots.\n\nWait, maybe I should try another one. Let me check x=7.\n\nPlugging 7 into the equation:\n\n7⁴ +5*7³ +9*7² -7 -14. Let's compute each term:\n\n7⁴ is 2401, 5*343=1715, 9*49=441, so 2401 +1715 is 4116, plus 441 is 4557, minus 7 is 4550, minus14 is 4536. That's way too big, so not zero.\n\nHow about x=-7? Maybe that'll cancel out more terms.\n\n(-7)^4 +5*(-7)^3 +9*(-7)^2 -(-7) -14. Let's compute:\n\n(-7)^4 is 2401, 5*(-343)= -1715, 9*49=441, so 2401 -1715 is 686, plus 441 is 1127, plus7 (since it's -(-7)) is 1134, minus14 is 1120. Not zero.\n\nHmm, that didn't work. Maybe"

Plus 5*(14)^3: 14³=2744, times 5 is 13720. 9*(14)^2=9*196=1764. So adding these up: 38416 +13720 =52136, plus 1764 is 538,905? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, 38416 +13720 is 52136. 52136 +1764=538, no, wait, 52136 +1764 is 538, which is 538, maybe it's 53800? Wait, 52136 +1764: 52136 +1000=53136, +764=538, which is 538 (I think I'm making a mistake here). Alternatively, perhaps it's better not to compute it because I'm not good at big numbers, but regardless, likely it won't be zero. Let me just check the subtraction part: minus x is minus14, minus14, so zero.\n\nWait, no, when x=14, the equation is 14⁴ +5*14³ +9*14² -14 -14. So 14⁴ is 38416, 5*14³ is 5*2744=13720, 9*14² is 9*196=1764, so total is 38416 +13720=52136 +1764=53900, minus14-14=28, so 53900-28=53872. Definitely not zero.\n\nAlright, so x=14 is not a root. What about x=-14? That would be even bigger, so probably not, but let's see:\n\n(-14)^4 is also 38416, 5*(-14)^3 is 5*(-2744)= -13720, 9*(-14)^2 is 1764, so 38416 -13720=24696, plus1764 is 26460, minus(-14) is +14, so 26460 +14=26474, minus14=26460. Not zero either. Okay, so x=-14 isn't a root.\n\nSo far"

We've tried all except -1, which didn't work, and 1, which worked, and 2, which didn't, and -2 which worked. Wait, so maybe there are only two integer roots? But the problem says \"Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.\" So maybe just 1 and -2?\n\nWait, but let me check again.

So adding up: 1 -5 = -4, +9 =5, +1=6, -14= -8. Yeah, that's correct. Not zero.\n\nHow about x= -2 again? Let me confirm:\n\n(-2)^4 =16, 5*(-2)^3=5*(-8)= -40, 9*(-2)^2=9*4=36, -(-2)=+2, then -14.

So 1 and -2 are the integer roots. Wait, but I think I've only found two, but the original equation is quartic, so there could be four roots in total, some of which might be non-integer. So perhaps only two integer roots.\n\nWait, but let's check x= -7 again. Maybe I miscalculated:\n\n(-7)^4 is 2401, 5*(-7)^3 is 5*(-343)= -1715, 9*(-7)^2=9*49=441, so 2401 -1715=686, plus 441=1127, then subtract (-7)=+7, so 1127+7=1134, minus14=1120. Not zero.\n\nHmm, okay, so no.\n\nWait, maybe I should use polynomial division now that I've found two roots to factor them out and see if the remaining quadratic can give more integer roots. Because maybe the quartic can be factored into (x-1)(x+2)(quadratic), and then I can solve the quadratic for integer roots.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, factor out (x - 1) from the quartic. Let's perform polynomial long division or synthetic division.\n\nUsing synthetic division for x=1:\n\nThe coefficients are 1 (x⁴), 5 (x³), 9 (x²), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nSet up synthetic division:\n\n1 | 1   5   9   -1   -14\n   |      1   6   15   14\n   -------------------------\n     1   6  15   14   0\n\nSo the remainder is zero, which we knew. So the quartic can be written as (x - 1)(x³ + 6x² + 15x +14).\n\nNow, we can factor the cubic: x³ + 6x² +15x +14.\n\nAgain, using Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 14: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nTesting x=-2:\n\n"

Therefore, the original quartic is (x -1)(x +2)(x² +4x +7). \n\nNow, the quadratic is x² +4x +7. To see if there are integer roots, compute its discriminant: b² -4ac = 16 -28 = -12.
