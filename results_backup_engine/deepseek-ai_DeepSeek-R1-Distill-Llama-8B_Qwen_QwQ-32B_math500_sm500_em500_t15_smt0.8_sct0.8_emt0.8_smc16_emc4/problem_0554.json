            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of 70s stamps Juan owns for each country based on the information provided. According to the chart, Brazil has 12 stamps from the 70s, France has 12 stamps, Peru has 12 stamps, and Spain has 6 stamps. Adding these together, there are a total of 42 stamps from the 70s.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total cost of the 70s stamps. Brazil's 70s stamps cost $6$ cents each, so 12 stamps cost $6 \\times 12 = 72$ cents. France's 70s stamps also cost $6$ cents each, so another $6 \\times 12 = 72$ cents. Peru's 70s stamps cost $4$ cents each, totaling $4 \\times 12 = 48$ cents. Spain's 70s stamps cost $5$ cents each, amounting to $5 \\times 6 = 30$ cents. Adding these amounts together gives a total cost of $72 + 72 + 48 + 30 = 222$ cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per stamp from the 70s, I'll divide the total cost by the total number of 70s stamps: 222 cents divided by 42 stamps equals 5.3 cents per stamp. Rounding this to the nearest tenth, the average price is 5.3 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of 70s Stamps by Country:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 stamps\n   - **France:** 12 stamps\n   - **Peru:** 12 stamps\n   - **Spain:** 6 stamps\n   - **Total 70s stamps:** \\(12 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 42\\) stamps\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost of 70s Stamps:**\n   - **Brazil (70s):** \\(6 \\, \\text{cents} \\times 12 \\, \\text{stamps} = 72 \\, \\text{cents}\\)\n   - **France (70s):** \\(6 \\, \\text{cents} \\times 12 \\, \\text{stamps} = 72 \\, \\text{cents}\\)\n   - **Peru"
