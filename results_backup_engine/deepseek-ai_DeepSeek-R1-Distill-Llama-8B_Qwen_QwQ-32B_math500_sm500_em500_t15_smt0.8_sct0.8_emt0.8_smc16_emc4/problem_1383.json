            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where a matrix M transforms one vector to another and another vector to another. I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this matrix M. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me two specific transformations. It says that when M acts on the vector [2, -1], it results in [9, 3]. Similarly, when M acts on [1, -3], it results in [7, -1]. So, I can write these as equations:\n\nM * [2; -1] = [9; 3]\nM * [1; -3] = [7; -1]\n\nI think to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1, I need to figure out what happens to the line when it's transformed by M. Since M is a linear transformation, it will map lines to lines. So, the image should also be a line.\n\nBut how do I find the equation of the image line? Maybe I can find two points on the original line, apply M to them, and then find the equation of the line connecting the transformed points.\n\nOkay, that sounds like a plan. So first, let's find two points on the line y = 2x + 1. I can choose x = 0 and x = 1 for simplicity.\n\nFor x = 0, y = 2(0) + 1 = 1. So, the first point is (0, 1).\n\nFor x = 1, y = 2(1) + 1 = 3. So, the second point is (1, 3).\n\nNow, I'll apply the matrix M to both of these points.\n\nBut wait, do I know the matrix M? It's not given directly. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe I can figure out what M is by using the given transformations.\n\nGiven that M * [2; -1] = [9; 3], and M * [1; -3] = [7; -1], I can set up equations to find M. Let's assume M is a 2x2 matrix:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nThen, applying M to [2; -1] gives:\n\n[a*2 + b*(-1)] = 9"

So, M * [0;1] = [4*0 + (-1)*1; 2*0 + 1*1] = [ -1; 1 ]\n\nSo, the transformed point is (-1, 1).\n\nNext, for the point (1,3):\n\nIn matrix form, that's [1; 3].

So, if I can express v as a parameterized vector, then find M(v) and see if it satisfies some equation.\n\nLet me parameterize the original line.\n\nThe line y =2x +1 can be parameterized as follows.\n\nLet me set x = t, then y = 2t +1. So, the vector can be written as [t; 2t +1].\n\nAlternatively, let me set t such that x = t, so v(t) = [t; 2t +1].\n\nThen, applying M to v(t):\n\nM * [t; 2t +1] = [4t - (2t +1); 2t + (2t +1)].\n\nCompute each component:\n\nFirst component:4t -2t -1 =2t -1\n\nSecond component:2t +2t +1=4t +1\n\nSo, the transformed vector is [2t -1; 4t +1].\n\nNow, let me see if this is a linear equation in terms of t.

So that's good.\n\nTherefore, the image of the line y=2x+1 under M is y=2x+3.\n\nHmm, so that seems consistent. Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using the transformation of the line's direction vector and a point.\n\nThe original line has a direction vector. Since the line is y=2x+1, its direction vector can be found from the slope. The slope is 2, so direction vector is [1,2].\n\nWait, but actually, the direction vector for a line with slope m is [1, m], so yes, [1,2].\n\nSo, the direction vector is [1,2]. Let me see how M transforms this direction vector.\n\nM * [1;2] = [4*1 + (-1)*2; 2*1 +1*2] = [4 -2; 2 +2] = [2;4]\n\nSo, the transformed direction vector is [2,4], which has a slope of 4/2 =2. So, the direction of the line is preserved in terms of slope? Wait, but the image line has the same slope? Wait, but the original line had slope 2, and the image also has slope 2. Hmm, but the problem says \"the image of the line y =2x +1\", so the direction is preserved, but the intercept changes. That makes sense because linear transformations can shift the line if they include translations, but wait, actually, linear transformations don't include translations. Wait, but the problem says \"matrix M takes vectors to vectors\", so it's a linear transformation, which can only map lines to lines or points. Since the original line is not through the origin (it has intercept 1), the image line will be an affine transformation, but since it's linear, the image of the line will be another line, possibly shifted.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, the image line is y=2x+3, which is parallel to the original line, which makes sense because the direction vector's slope is preserved. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since the direction vector's slope is preserved, the image line is parallel, so same slope, and the intercept is different. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively"

So, let me try that.\n\nExpress the line y=2x+1 as a vector function.\n\nLet me take a parameter t, where t is any real number.\n\nx = t\n\ny =2t +1\n\nSo, the vector is [x; y] = [t; 2t +1]\n\nThen, apply M:\n\nM * [t; 2t +1] = [4t - (2t +1); 2t + (2t +1)] = [2t -1;4t +1]\n\nWhich is exactly what I had before, so the image is:\n\nx =2t -1\n\ny=4t +1\n\nExpressed parametrically as:\n\nx =2t -1\n\ny=4t +1\n\nTo eliminate the parameter t, solve for t from x:\n\nx =2t -1 => t = (x +1)/2\n\nPlug into y:\n\ny =4*( (x +1)/2 ) +1 = 2(x +1) +1 = 2x +2 +1 =2x +3\n\nSame result again.
