            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number w. It says that w is the result when z is rotated around c by π/4 counter-clockwise. Okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down what's given. The complex number z is 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i. So, in standard form, z is a + b i, where a is 2 + sqrt(2) and b is -(3 + 3 sqrt(2)). The center of rotation, c, is 2 - 3i. So, c is a complex number with real part 2 and imaginary part -3.\n\nI remember that rotating a complex number around another complex number involves translating the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, performing the rotation, and then translating back. So, to rotate z around c by π/4, I need to do the following steps:\n\n1. Subtract c from z to translate z so that c is at the origin. This gives the vector from c to z.\n2. Multiply this translated vector by e^(iθ), where θ is π/4, to perform the rotation.\n3. Add c back to the rotated vector to translate it back to the original position.\n\nLet me write that down mathematically. If z and c are complex numbers, then the rotation can be represented as:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^(iπ/4)\n\nOkay, so I need to compute (z - c) first. Let me calculate z - c. \n\nz is 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i. c is 2 - 3i. So subtracting c from z:\n\nz - c = (2 + sqrt(2) - 2) + (-3 - 3 sqrt(2)i + 3i)\n\nSimplify that:\n\nReal part: 2 + sqrt(2) - 2 = sqrt(2)\n\nImaginary part: (-3 - 3 sqrt(2)i + 3i) = (-3) + (-3 sqrt(2) + 3)i\n\nSo z - c is sqrt(2) + (-3 + 3(1 - sqrt(2))i). Let me write that as sqrt(2) - 3 + (3"

Then subtracting c's imaginary part, which is -3i, so the subtraction would be:\n\nImaginary part of z is -3 - 3 sqrt(2) (the coefficient of i), and subtracting the imaginary part of c, which is -3 (since c is 2 - 3i). Wait, actually, when subtracting complex numbers, it's (z - c) = (z_real - c_real) + (z_imag - c_imag)i.\n\nSo z_real is 2 + sqrt(2), c_real is 2. So z_real - c_real = sqrt(2).\n\nz_imag is - (3 + 3 sqrt(2)), and c_imag is -3. So z_imag - c_imag = (-3 - 3 sqrt(2)) - (-3) = (-3 - 3 sqrt(2)) + 3 = -3 sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, z - c is sqrt(2) + (-3 sqrt(2))i. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, z's imaginary component is - (3 + 3√2)i, so the coefficient is -3 - 3√2. The imaginary part of c is -3. So when subtracting, it's (-3 - 3√2) - (-3) = (-3 - 3√2) + 3 = -3√2. So the imaginary part is -3√2. Therefore, z - c is sqrt(2) - 3√2 i. \n\nOkay, so that simplifies to sqrt(2) - 3√2 i. So that's the vector from c to z. \n\nNow, we need to rotate this vector by π/4 radians counter-clockwise. The rotation factor is e^(iπ/4). Since e^(iθ) = cosθ + i sinθ, so for θ = π/4, that's cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) = √2/2 + i√2/2. \n\nTherefore, multiplying (z - c) by"

Let me check my calculations again because that seems straightforward, but let me verify.\n\nWait, so (z - c) was sqrt(2) -3 sqrt(2)i. Multiplying by e^{iπ/4} gives 4 -2i. Then adding c, which is 2 -3i, gives 6 -5i. Hmm.\n\nWait a second, let me re-examine the multiplication to be sure. Let me compute A * B again, with A = sqrt(2) -3 sqrt(2)i and B = sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nMultiplying out:\n\nFirst, multiply sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = (2)/2 = 1.\n\nThen sqrt(2) * i sqrt(2)/2 = (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) * i /2 = 2i/2 = i.\n\nThen, -3 sqrt(2)i * sqrt(2)/2 = -3*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))i/2 = -3*2i/2 = -3i.\n\nThen, -3 sqrt(2)i * i sqrt(2)/2 = (-3)(sqrt(2)^2) * i^2 / 2 = (-3)(2)*(-1)/2 = (-6)(-1)/2 = 3.\n\nSo adding all together: 1 + i -3i +3 = (1 + 3) + (i -3i) = 4 -2i.

Multiplication by e^{iπ/4} gives 4 -2i. Adding back c, which is 2 -3i, gives 6 -5i.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify using another approach. If I do the rotation as a transformation.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent the points as vectors and perform rotation.\n\nZ is at (2 + sqrt(2), -3 -3 sqrt(2))\n\nC is at (2, -3)\n\nSo, the vector from c to z is (sqrt(2), -3 sqrt(2)).\n\nWait, yes, that's consistent with z - c = sqrt(2) -3 sqrt(2) i, so in coordinates, that's x = sqrt(2), y = -3 sqrt(2).\n\nNow, when you rotate this vector by π/4, the rotation matrix is [cosθ -sinθ; sinθ cosθ]. So for θ = π/4, cosθ = sinθ = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo the rotated vector is:\n\nx' = x cosθ - y sinθ = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 - (-3 sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2)/2\n\ny' = x sinθ + y cosθ = sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 + (-3 sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2)/2\n\nCompute x':\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\n-(-3 sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2)/2 = +3*sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = 3*2/2 = 3\n\nSo x' = 1 + 3 = 4\n\ny':\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = 1\n\n+ (-3 sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2)/2 = (-3*2)/2 = -3\n\nSo y' = 1 -3 = -2\n\nTherefore, the rotated vector is (4, -2), which corresponds to 4 -2i.\n\n"
