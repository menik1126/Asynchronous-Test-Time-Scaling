The function f takes two arguments, i and j, both non-negative integers, but j is specifically in the range from 0 to 4. The function is defined recursively, which means it refers back to itself with smaller values, and I need to find f(2015,2). \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the function f works. Let's parse the definition step by step.\n\nThe function f is defined for all non-negative integers i and j, where j is between 0 and 4. The definition has three cases:\n\n1. If i is 0 and j is between 0 and 4, then f(0,j) is simply mod_5(j+1). That means, for each j in 0,1,2,3,4, f(0,j) is the remainder when (j+1) is divided by 5. So, let's compute these:\n\n- f(0,0) = mod_5(0+1) = mod_5(1) = 1\n- f(0,1) = mod_5(1+1) = mod_5(2) = 2\n- f(0,2) = mod_5(2+1) = mod_5(3) = 3\n- f(0,3) = mod_5(3+1) = mod_5(4) = 4\n- f(0,4) = mod_5(4+1) = mod_5(5) = 0\n\nSo, f(0,j) is straightforward for the base case. It cycles through 1,2,3,4,0 as j increases from 0 to 4.\n\n2. The second case is if i is at least 1 and j is 0. Then, f(i,0) = f(i-1,1). So, whenever the second argument is 0, regardless of i (as long as i >=1), the function reduces to f(i-1,1). That means we can recursively compute this by decrementing i and setting j to 1.\n\n3. The third case is when i is at least 1 and j is between 1 and 4. In this case, f(i,j) ="

So, for each i>=1 and j between 1 and 4, the function f(i,j) is equal to f(i-1) evaluated at f(i,j-1). \n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to unpack it. So, for each i and j (with j >=1), f(i,j) is f evaluated at (i-1, some intermediate value). The intermediate value is f(i,j-1). So, to compute f(i,j), we first compute f(i,j-1), then use that result as the j parameter for f(i-1, ...). \n\nSo, for example, if I want to compute f(1,1), it would be f(0, f(1,0)). But f(1,0) is f(0,1) from the second case, which is 2, so f(1,1) = f(0,2) = 3.\n\nSimilarly, f(1,2) = f(0, f(1,1)) = f(0,3) = 4, and so on.\n\nLet me try to compute some small values to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet's start by building a table for small i and j.\n\nFirst, compute the base case i=0:\n\ni=0:\n- f(0,0)=1\n- f(0,1)=2\n- f(0,2)=3\n- f(0,3)=4\n- f(0,4)=0\n\nNow, i=1:\n\nFor j=0: f(1,0)=f(0,1)=2\nFor j=1: f(1,1)=f(0, f(1,0))=f(0,2)=3\nFor j=2: f(1,2)=f(0, f(1,1))=f(0,3)=4\nFor j=3: f(1,3)=f(0, f(1,2))=f(0,4)=0\nFor j=4: f(1,4)=f(0, f(1,3))=f(0,0)=1\n\nSo, f(1,j) for j=0 to 4 is"
