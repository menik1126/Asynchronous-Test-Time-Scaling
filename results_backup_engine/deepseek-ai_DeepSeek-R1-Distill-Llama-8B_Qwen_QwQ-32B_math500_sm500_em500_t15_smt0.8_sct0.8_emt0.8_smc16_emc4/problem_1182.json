            "output": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. It seems a bit complex at first glance, but I think I can break it down. The equation given is a quartic equation in the complex plane, and the solutions form the vertices of a convex polygon. Our goal is to find the area of that polygon and express it in a specific form, then determine the sum a + b + p.\n\nFirst, the equation is:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, looking at this equation, I notice that the coefficients have a pattern. Let me write down the coefficients:\n\n1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i\n\nThat's interesting. It seems like the coefficients are following a geometric progression or perhaps related to powers of i. Let me think. The coefficients of z^4 is 1, z^3 is 4i, z^2 is -6, z is -4i, and the constant term is -i.\n\nWait a minute, these coefficients resemble the expansion of a binomial expression. Specifically, let me recall that (z + i)^4 expands to:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6 z^2 + 4i z + 1 \\)\n\nComparing this with our given equation, which is:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, the given equation is similar but has different signs for the z^2 and z terms, as well as a different constant term. Let me see the difference:\n\nIn the expansion, the z^2 term is +6, but here it's -6. Similarly, the z term is +4i here but in the given equation, it's -4i. The constant term is +1 versus -i.\n\nSo maybe the given equation is related to (z + i)^4 but with some modifications. Alternatively, could it be (z + i)^4 minus something?\n\nLet me try to express the given equation as (z + i)^4 minus another polynomial.\n\nCalculating (z + i)^4:\n\n= z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6 z^2 + 4i z + 1\n\nSubtracting (6 z^2 + 4i z"

So that's close but not quite. The difference is the constant term: here we have -2i, but the given equation has -i. So maybe subtract (6 z^2 +4i z +1 +i) instead?\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nSuppose (z + i)^4 - (something) = given equation.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\n(z + i)^4 - (something) = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i\n\nTherefore, (something) = (z + i)^4 - (given equation)\n\nCompute (z + i)^4 - (given equation):\n\n= [z^4 +4i z^3 +6 z^2 +4i z +1] - [z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i]\n\n= (z^4 - z^4) + (4i z^3 -4i z^3) + (6 z^2 +6 z^2) + (4i z +4i z) + (1 +i)\n\n= 12 z^2 +8i z + (1 +i)\n\nHmm, so (something) is 12 z^2 +8i z + (1 +i).

Let me check:\n\nThe angle between s and i s is the angle between s and -s rotated by 90 degrees. The angle between s and i s is actually 90 degrees, since multiplying by i is a 90-degree rotation.\n\nWait, but s is a complex number, and i s is s rotated by 90 degrees. Therefore, the vectors s and i s are orthogonal. Thus, the four points form a rectangle, since they are symmetric with respect to the center and the vectors from the center are orthogonal. Wait, but since we have addition and subtraction of these vectors, perhaps the figure is actually a square.\n\nBut to check that, we need to see if the lengths of the vectors s and i s are equal.\n\nCompute |s| = |sqrt(w)| = sqrt(|w|) = sqrt( sqrt(1 +i) )= (sqrt(1 +i))^{1/2}\n\nCompute |sqrt(1 +i)| = (sqrt(2))^{1/2} =2^{1/4}\n\nSo, |s| = (2^{1/4})^{1/2}=2^{1/8}\n\nSimilarly, |i s|= |s|=2^{1/8}\n\nTherefore, both vectors have the same magnitude, and are orthogonal. Thus, the four points form a square centered at -i, with vertices at distance 2^{1/8} from the center, along the directions of s and i s.\n\nWait, but in the complex plane, the four points are:\n\n- i + s, -i -s, -i +i s, -i -i s.\n\nSo, plotting these points, they form a square rotated by some angle, with center at -i.\n\nTherefore, the area of this square is |s|² *4, since the side length is |s|*sqrt(2), but wait, perhaps it's better to compute the distance between adjacent points.\n\nWait, the distance between z1 and z3 is sqrt( |(z1 - z3)|² )\n\nCompute z1 and z3:\n\nz1 = -i + s\n\nz3 = -i +"

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the edges are between 1 and 2, 2 and 4, 4 and 3, 3 and 1? Hmm, maybe need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since the vectors from the center are s, -s, i s, -i s, the four points are located at the four cardinal directions (in terms of s and i s). So, the square is rotated such that its vertices are along the directions of s and i s. The side length of the square would be the distance between -i + s and -i +i s, which is |s -i s| = |s(1 -i)| = |s| * sqrt(2).
