Since the sequence of odd numbers is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find the total number of terms.\n\nThe formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. Here, a_1 is 1, d is 2, and a_n is 199. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n199 = 1 + (n - 1)*2\n199 - 1 = (n - 1)*2\n198 = (n - 1)*2\nn - 1 = 99\nn = 100\n\nSo, there are 100 terms in this sequence.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of these terms. The sum of the first n odd numbers is given by the formula S = n^2. Therefore, the sum S is:\nS = 100^2 = 10,000\n\nNow, I need to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7. To do this, I'll perform integer division of 10,000 by 7 and identify the remainder.\n\nDividing 10,000 by 7:\n7*1428 = 9996\n10,000 - 9996 = 4\n\nSo, the remainder is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Number of Terms\nThe given sequence is an arithmetic sequence where:\n- The first term (\\(a_1\\)) is \\(1\\).\n- The common difference (\\(d\\)) is \\(2\\) (since each term increases by \\(2\\)).\n\nThe \\(n\\)-th term (\\(a_n\\)) of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nPlugging in the known values to find \\(n\\) when \\(a_n = 199\\):\n\\[\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n"
