To simplify the square roots, I'll start by expressing them as exponents.\n\nI see a square root of 1/729, which can be written as (1/729) raised to the power of 1/2.\n\nNext, the entire expression is under a cube root, so I'll apply the cube root as an exponent of 1/3.\n\nNow, I have the square root of the cube root of (1/729) to the power of 1/2, which I can combine into a single exponent of (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.\n\nFinally, taking the square root of (1/729) and combining all exponents, I simplify the expression to (1/729) raised to the power of 1/6.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\\) and write the result with a rational denominator, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express the square roots as exponents:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{729}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\left(\\frac{1}{729}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   = \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{729}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{729}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{729}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{6}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{729}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{6}}\\):**\n   \n   Recognize that \\(729 = 9^3 = 3^{6}\\), so:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{729}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3^{6}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\frac{1}{3} ="
