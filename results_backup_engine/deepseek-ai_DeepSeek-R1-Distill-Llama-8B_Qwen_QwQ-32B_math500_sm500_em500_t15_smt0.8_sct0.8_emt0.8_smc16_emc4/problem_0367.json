            "output": "First, I'll define the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles. So, I can express the initial counts as:\nB = 4k and Y = 3k, where k is a common multiplier.\n\nNext, I'll consider the changes made to the marbles. I added 5 blue marbles and removed 3 yellow marbles. Therefore, the new counts are:\nB + 5 and Y - 3.\n\nAfter these changes, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles becomes 7:3. This gives me the equation:\n(B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3.\n\nSubstituting the initial expressions for B and Y into this equation, I get:\n(4k + 5)/(3k - 3) = 7/3.\n\nTo solve for k, I'll cross-multiply:\n3*(4k + 5) = 7*(3k - 3),\nwhich simplifies to:\n12k + 15 = 21k - 21.\n\nCombining like terms:\n15 + 21 = 21k - 12k,\n36 = 9k,\nso k = 4.\n\nFinally, I'll find the initial number of blue marbles:\nB = 4k = 4*4 = 16.\n\nTherefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before adding more.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Initial ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is \\(4:3\\).\n- After adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes \\(7:3\\).\n\n**Let:**\n- \\(B\\) = initial number of blue marbles.\n- \\(Y\\) = initial number of yellow marbles.\n\n**Step 1: Express the initial ratio in terms of \\(B\\) and \\(Y\\).**\n\nSince the ratio is \\(4:3\\),\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Rightarrow B = \\frac{4}{3}Y\n\\]\n\n**Step "
