Then, express this distance as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, with \\( a \\) square-free, and find \\( a + b \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. The smallest distance from a point to a curve is usually found by minimizing the distance function from a point on the curve to the given point—in this case, the origin. That makes sense because the shortest distance from a point to a set is either the distance to the nearest point on the set or, if the point is inside the set, zero. Since the origin is (0,0), I think we need to find the point on the curve closest to the origin.\n\nTo do this, I remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin is given by the distance formula: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Since square roots can complicate things when taking derivatives, it might be easier to minimize the square of the distance, \\( x^2 + y^2 \\), because the square function is monotonically increasing for non-negative numbers. So, minimizing the square of the distance will give me the same point as minimizing the distance itself.\n\nGiven the function \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), I can substitute this into the distance squared function. Let me write that out:\n\nDistance squared, \\( D^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( y \\):\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\).\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, square the \\( y \\) term:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\times (x^2 - 3)^2 \\).\n\nSimplify \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2"

The distance might be at one of these critical points or at points where the derivative is not zero (but in this case, since we have a function, it's only these critical points to check).\n\nWait, actually, since the function \\( D^2 \\) is a polynomial, and assuming it tends to infinity as \\( x \\) tends to positive or negative infinity, it must have a minimum somewhere finite, which should be at one of the critical points we found.\n\nSo, let's compute \\( D^2 \\) at each critical point.\n\nFirst, at \\( x = 0 \\):\n\nCompute \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(0 - 3) = \\frac{-3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nSo, the point is (0, -3/√2).

So, the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2.\n\nBut according to the question, the minimal distance can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is square-free.\n\nHere, sqrt(10)/2 is already in the form sqrt(a)/b where a=10 and b=2. Now, 10 is square-free since its prime factors are 2 and 5, neither of which is squared. So, a=10, b=2. Therefore, a+b=10+2=12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.
