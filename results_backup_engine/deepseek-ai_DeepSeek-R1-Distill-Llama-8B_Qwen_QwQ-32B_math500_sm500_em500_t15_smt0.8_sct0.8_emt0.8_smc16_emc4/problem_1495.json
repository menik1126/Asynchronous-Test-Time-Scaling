Since all prime numbers except for 2 are odd, I can focus on excluding 2 from the list of primes less than 30.\n\nThen, I'll count the total number of these odd prime numbers to find the size of the intersection.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the prime numbers less than 30**:\n   The prime numbers less than 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n\n2. **Identify the odd numbers greater than zero**:\n   All odd numbers greater than zero are numbers of the form \\(2k + 1\\) where \\(k \\geq 0\\). However, for the intersection with primes, we only consider primes that are odd, which excludes 2.\n\n3. **Find the intersection of the two sets**:\n   - The prime number 2 is excluded because it is even.\n   - The remaining primes are all odd: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n\n4. **Count the number of elements in the intersection**:\n   There are **9** odd prime numbers less than 30.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{9}"
