            "output": "Alright, I need to simplify the expression (1 + √2)/(2 + √3). Hmm, rationalizing the denominator seems like a good idea here. I remember that when you have a denominator with a radical, you can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to get rid of the square root.\n\nSo, the denominator is 2 + √3, and its conjugate would be 2 - √3. I'll multiply both the top and bottom by that. Let me write that out:\n\n[(1 + √2) * (2 - √3)] / [(2 + √3) * (2 - √3)]\n\nFirst, I'll multiply the numerator. Let's expand (1 + √2)(2 - √3). Using the distributive property:\n\n1*2 + 1*(-√3) + √2*2 + √2*(-√3)\n= 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6\n\nSo the numerator becomes 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\nNow, the denominator: (2 + √3)(2 - √3). That's a difference of squares, so it should be 2² - (√3)².\n\nCalculating that: 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nSo now, the expression simplifies to [2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6]/1, which is just 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\nWait, the problem asks to express it in the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D). Let me see if I can rearrange the terms to match that.\n\nLooking at my result: 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6. Let's group the constants and the similar radicals:\n\n2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nHmm, 2 can be written as 2*(1), and 2√2 is 2√2. So maybe I can factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n\n2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6).\n\nYes, that looks like the form they want. So, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, and D is 6.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. When I multiplied out the numerator:\n\n(1 + √2)(2 -"

So the expression becomes 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6. Which is 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nExpressed as 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). So A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6.\n\nAdding them up: 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n\nI think that's correct, but let me make sure there's no simplification or alternative form that could change A, B, C, D. For example, I could factor √2 or √3 differently, but in the given form, this seems to fit best. So I'm confident the answer is 13.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\( \\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\), we multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \\( 2 - \\sqrt{3} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3})}\n\\]\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) = 2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nThe denominator simplifies as:\n\n\\[\n(2+\\sqrt{3})(2-\\sqrt{3}) = 4 - 3 = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nRearranged, this is:\n\n\\[\n2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( A = 2 \\), \\( B = 2 \\), \\( C = 3 \\), and \\( D = 6 \\).
