            "output": "I start by recognizing that the equation involves exponents and needs to be solved for the variable \\( x \\). The equation is \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\). First, I'll calculate \\( 2^3 \\) to simplify the equation.\n\n\\[\n2^3 = 8\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this back into the original equation gives:\n\n\\[\n8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\( 3^x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:\n\n\\[\n3^x = \\frac{72}{8} \\implies 3^x = 9\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the exponent \\( x \\) that makes \\( 3^x = 9 \\). I know that \\( 3^2 = 9 \\), so this implies:\n\n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given the equation:\n\\[2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( x \\) step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 2^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute \\( 2^3 \\) back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Isolate \\( 3^x \\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
