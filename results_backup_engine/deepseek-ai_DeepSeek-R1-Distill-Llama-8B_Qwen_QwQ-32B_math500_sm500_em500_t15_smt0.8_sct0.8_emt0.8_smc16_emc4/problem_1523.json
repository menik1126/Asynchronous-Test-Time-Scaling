The problem says that \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\), \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\), and \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\). I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay, so let me think. This seems like it could be related to moments in probability or maybe something with variance or something? Or perhaps it's about the properties of the sequence of numbers. Wait, since all the \\( a_i \\) are positive real numbers, maybe I can use some inequalities here.\n\nI remember there's something called the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the Power Mean inequality that relates these different sums. Let me think about how they might apply here.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I have:\n\n1. \\( S_1 = \\sum a_i = 96 \\)\n2. \\( S_2 = \\sum a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n3. \\( S_3 = \\sum a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nI need to find possible values of \\( n \\), then sum those possible \\( n \\)s.\n\nI know that for Power Mean, the idea is that the mean of the squares is related to the square of the mean, and similarly for higher powers. But in this case, we have the sum of cubes, which is the third moment. So maybe I can relate these sums using some inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form:\n\n\\( (\\sum a_i)^2 \\leq n \\sum a_i^2 \\)\n\nLet me check that. So, \\( 96^2 \\leq n \\times 144 \\). Calculating 96 squared: 9216. Then, 9216 divided by 144 is... 9216 ÷ 144. Let me do that: 144 * 64 = 9216, right? Because 144*60=8640, and 144*4"

Wait, but that's the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, so equality holds when all the a_i are equal. So if all a_i are equal, then each a_i would be 96/n, and then the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)^2 = 9216/n. But in the problem, the sum of squares is 144, so 9216/n =144 ⇒ n=64. So that's the case when all a_i are equal. So that gives n=64 as a possible value?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n\". So maybe there are other values of n where the sums can be achieved with different a_i's?\n\nHmm, so perhaps n can be 64, but maybe also other numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to have some of the a_i's be different, allowing for different n?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only possible n is 64? But the question says \"sum of all possible values\", so maybe there are more?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to model this with variables. Let me think.\n\nSuppose that all the a_i are equal except for one or two terms. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimal or maximal possible n?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the variance.

Hmm, but maybe that's a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are all 2? Let me check. If all a_i are 2, then the sum would be 2n =96 ⇒ n=48. Then the sum of squares would be 4n=192, but the problem says 144. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if all a_i are equal, then each a_i is 96/n. Then the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)^2 = 9216/n. So setting that equal to 144 gives 9216/n =144 ⇒ n=64. So that's the case when all a_i are equal. Then the sum of cubes would be n*(96/n)^3 = (96)^3 /n². Let me compute that: 96^3 is 96*96*96. 96*96 is 9216, so 9216*96. Let me compute that:\n\n9216 * 96: 9216*100 = 921,600 minus 9216*4 = 36,864, so 921,600 - 36,864 = 884,736. So 96^3 = 884,736. Then 884,736 divided by n squared.

So 55,296 ÷256=216.\n\nSo indeed, when n=64, sum of cubes is 216, which matches the problem statement. So that's one possible value: n=64.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n.\" So maybe there are more possible n's?\n\nLet me try with another approach. Let me assume that not all a_i are equal. Maybe some of them are larger and some are smaller. Let me see if that can happen.\n\nWait, perhaps using the concept of moment inequalities. Let's think about the variance.\n\nWait, the variance would be \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i^2 - \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i \\right)^2 \\).\n\nPlugging in numbers: \\( \\frac{144}{n} - \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\frac{9216}{n^2} \\).\n\nSimilarly, the third moment: \\( \\sum a_i^3 = 216 \\).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure how that connects to the second moment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the inequality between the second and third moments.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the third moment. Let's consider:\n\n\\( (\\sum a_i^3)^2 \\leq (\\sum a_i^2)(\\sum a_i^4) \\). Hmm, but that relates to sum of fourth powers, which we don't have. So maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Hölder's inequality: \\( \\sum a_i^3 \\leq (\\sum a_i^2)^{3/2} (\\sum 1)^{1/2} \\). Wait, but Hölder's inequality with exponents p=2 and q=2?

So for any n>64, the inequality is strict, so sum of cubes divided by n would be greater than the cube of mean, which is higher.\n\nWait, but in the problem, sum of cubes is 216, which when n=64, gives 216= sum of cubes, which is exactly the cube of the mean times n, which is 96^3 /n²=216.\n\nWait, for n>64, the sum of cubes must be greater than 216, because the power mean is higher, so 216 would be less than required. So this suggests that n cannot be greater than 64, because the sum of cubes would have to be higher. But in the problem, sum of cubes is exactly 216, which only occurs when n=64.\n\nWait, but hold on: let's model this more carefully.\n\nIf n>64, then to satisfy the Power Mean inequality, we must have sum a_i^3 ≥ (sum a_i)^3 /n².\n\nWait, actually, that's not correct.\n\nWait, the Power Mean inequality is:\n\n(1/n sum a_i^3)^(1/3) ≥ (1/n sum a_i)^(1).\n\nWhich is,\n\n( (sum a_i^3)/n )^(1/3) ≥ (sum a_i)/n,\n\nCubing both sides,\n\n(sum a_i^3)/n ≥ (sum a_i)^3 /n³,\n\nMultiply both sides by n,\n\nsum a_i^3 ≥ (sum a_i)^3 /n².\n\nSo, indeed, sum a_i^3 ≥ (sum a_i)^3 /n².\n\n"

But since n is smaller, the RHS is larger, so the required sum of cubes would have to be larger than 216. But in the problem, it's exactly 216, so that would not be possible.

For example, maybe n=64 and another n?\n\nWait, but according to the Power Mean inequality, n must be exactly 64. Because if n is different, then the sum of cubes would have to be different. Since the problem states that the sum of cubes is exactly 216, which only occurs when n=64. So n must be 64.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 64, so the sum is 64.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"sum of all possible values of n\".
