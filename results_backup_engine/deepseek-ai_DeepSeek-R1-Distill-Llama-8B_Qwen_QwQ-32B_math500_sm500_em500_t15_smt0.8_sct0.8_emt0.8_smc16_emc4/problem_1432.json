It's asking for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) it's true that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n\nTo solve this, I'll start by expressing \\( 2^{24} \\) as a power of a single prime number, since 2 is a prime and \\( 2^{24} \\) is already in its prime factorization form.\n\nNext, I need to determine the possible values of \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be written as \\( k^n \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer. For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, I'll find all the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. These divisors represent the possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nAfter listing all the divisors, I'll count them to find the total number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) that satisfy the condition.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Express \\( 2^{24} \\) as a Perfect Power\nThe expression \\( 2^{24} \\) can be written as:\n\\[\n2^{24} = \\left(2^{4}\\right)^{6} = \\left(2^{6}\\right)^{4} = \\left(2^{8}\\right)^{3} = \\left(2^{12}\\right)^{2}\n\\]\nAdditionally, it can also be expressed as:\n\\[\n2^{24} = 2^{24}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify Possible Exponents \\( n \\)\nFor \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\). Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\n### Step 3: List All Divisors of 24\nThe positive divisors of 24 are:\n\\[\n1, "

The remaining divisors are:\n\\[\n2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Count the Valid Divisors\nThere are 7 divisors of 24 greater than 1.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."
