The given dimensions are radius r = 3 cm and height h = 8 cm. Plugging these values into the cylinder formula will give me the volume of one beaker.\n\nFinally, to find the number of beakers needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker. This will provide the total number of beakers required.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Given the radius \\( r = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\), we can compute the volume:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\pi \\times (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\pi \\times 216 = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n   Given the radius \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\) and height \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\), we compute the volume:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi \\times (3)^2 \\times 8 = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **D"
