Since the table is square, rotations of the same configuration are considered identical.\n\nI'll start by fixing one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. By fixing one person, I can simplify the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people.\n\nNext, I'll account for the symmetries of the square table. A square has 4 sides, and I need to consider the reflections.

After fixing one position, there are 7! ways to arrange the others.\n\nHowever, I realize that dividing by the number of symmetries (rotations and reflections) might be necessary. Since the table isn't distinct, the total number of symmetries is 8 (4 rotations and 4 reflections). But since I've already fixed one person, I only need to consider the symmetries that fix that person's position.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the total number of arrangements by 8 to account for the symmetries, resulting in the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix one person's position**: By fixing one person, we eliminate the rotational symmetry of the square, reducing the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people.\n\n2. **Arrange the remaining 7 people**: Since the table is not otherwise symmetrical, the number of ways to arrange the remaining 7 people around the table is \\(7!\\).\n\n3. **Account for reflections**: A square has reflectional symmetry, meaning that arrangements that are mirror images of each other are considered identical. There are 4 such symmetries (front, back, left, right). Therefore, we divide by 4 to account for these symmetries.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of distinct seating arrangements**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{7!}{4} = \\frac{5040}{4} = 1260\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThere are \\(\\boxed{1260}\\) distinct ways to seat 8 people around the square table."

            "output": "  \n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-examine this. \n\nWait, actually, when fixing one person's position, the rotational symmetry is already accounted for by fixing that position. However, reflections are still symmetries that need to be considered. But in the problem statement, it says \"Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.\" It does not mention reflections. \n\nAh, this is a critical point. The problem specifies that rotations are considered equivalent, but reflections are not. Therefore, reflections are considered distinct. \n\nTherefore, my previous step 3 was incorrect. Let me correct this:\n\n**Revised Steps**:\n\n1. **Fix one person's position**: Fixing one person removes rotational symmetry. The remaining 7 people can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways.\n\n2. **No division for reflections**: Since reflections are not considered equivalent unless stated, we do not divide by 2 or 4. The problem only mentions rotations as equivalent.\n\nThus, the correct calculation is simply \\(7! = 5040\\). But wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when arranging people around a circular table, the standard formula is \\((n-1)!\\) because rotations are considered the same. For a square table, which has rotational symmetry of order 4 (since rotating by 90 degrees cycles the positions), the number of rotational symmetries is 4. Therefore, the formula would be \\(\\frac{8!}{4}\\). But since we fixed one person, the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways, but divided by the remaining symmetries?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the standard circular arrangement approach here. For a circular table with n seats, it's (n-1)! because rotations are equivalent. For a square table with 8 seats (2 per side), the rotational symmetry is 4 (rotating by 90 degrees each time). Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is \\(\\frac{8!}{4}\\). \n\nBut if we fix one person's seat, then the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways, but since rotations are already accounted for by fixing that person, so the total is 7!.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen arranging people around a circular table with rotational symmetry, fixing one person's position effectively removes rotational"
