I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this transformation M. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when we apply a linear transformation (which a matrix representation is) to a line, the image of the line under the transformation can be found by transforming two points on the line and then determining the equation of the line passing through the transformed points. So, I need to pick two points on the original line y = 2x + 1, apply M to each of them, and then find the equation of the line connecting these two images.\n\nLet me write down what the original line is: y = 2x + 1. So, any point (x, y) on this line satisfies this equation. Now, I need to pick two points on this line. I can choose, for example, when x = 0 and x = 1 because these are simple and will give me two distinct points.\n\nCalculating the first point when x = 0:\ny = 2(0) + 1 = 1. So, the point is (0, 1).\n\nCalculating the second point when x = 1:\ny = 2(1) + 1 = 3. So, the point is (1, 3).\n\nGreat, now I have two points on the original line: (0,1) and (1,3). Now, I need to apply the transformation M to each of these points.\n\nBut wait, what exactly does M look like? I don't know the explicit form of the matrix M, but I know the images of two specific vectors. So, perhaps I can set up equations to find the entries of M?\n\nLet me denote M as:\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nSo, when we apply M to a vector [x; y], it becomes [a*x + b*y; c*x + d*y].\n\nGiven that M sends [2; -1] to [9; 3], we can write:\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9  --> 2a - b"

Let me solve them separately.\n\nStarting with the first system for a and b:\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 2: a - 3b = 7\n\nLet me solve this using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Let's multiply equation 2 by 2 to get 2a - 6b = 14. Then subtract equation 1 from this new equation:\n\n(2a - 6b) - (2a - b) = 14 - 9\n2a -6b -2a + b = 5\n-5b = 5 --> b = -1\n\nNow plug back b = -1 into equation 1:\n2a - (-1) = 9 --> 2a +1 =9 --> 2a =8 --> a=4\n\nSo, a=4 and b=-1.\n\nNow moving to the second system for c and d:\nEquation 3: 2c - d = 3\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nAgain, let's use elimination. Let's multiply equation 4 by 2 to get 2c -6d = -2. Then subtract equation 3 from this:\n\n(2c -6d) - (2c -d) = -2 -3\n2c -6d -2c +d = -5\n-5d = -5 --> d =1\n\nPlugging back d=1 into equation 3:\n2c -1 =3 --> 2c=4 --> c=2\n\nSo, c=2 and d=1.\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n[4   -1]\n[2    1]\n\nLet me verify this to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n"

Now I need to find the equation of this line.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope.\n\nSlope m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 -x1) = (5 -1)/(1 - (-1))=4/(2)=2\n\nSo, slope is 2.\n\nNow, using point-slope form. Let me use the point (-1,1).\n\ny -1 = 2(x - (-1)) => y -1=2(x +1) => y =2x +2 +1 => y=2x +3\n\nAlternatively, using point (1,5):\n\ny -5 = 2(x -1) => y =2x -2 +5 => y"

Wait, but hold on, that seems straightforward, but let me check if this is correct.\n\nWait a second, but the original line was y=2x+1, and the transformed line also has the same slope? That might be possible, but let me confirm the calculations again.\n\nWait, let me check the transformed points again.\n\nFirst point (0,1):\n\nOriginal coordinates (0,1). Applying M:\n\nFirst component: 4*0 + (-1)*1 = -1\n\nSecond component: 2*0 +1*1 =1. So, (-1,1). Correct.\n\nSecond point (1,3):\n\nOriginal coordinates (1,3). Applying M:\n\nFirst component:4*1 + (-1)*3 =4-3=1\n\nSecond component:2*1 +1*3=2+3=5. So, (1,5). Correct.\n\nSo, the two transformed points are indeed (-1,1) and (1,5). The slope between them is (5-1)/(1 - (-1))=4/2=2. So slope is 2. Then the equation is y=2x + b. Plugging in (1,5):\n\n5 =2*1 +b => b=3. So equation is y=2x+3. Hmm, so that's the image?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using parametric equations for the line and then applying the transformation?\n\nLet me try that method to confirm.\n\nThe original line is y =2x +1. Let me write this in parametric form. Let x = t, then y =2t +1. So, the parametric equations are:\n\nx = t\n\ny =2t +1\n\nSo, any point on the line can be written as the vector [t; 2t +1].\n\nApplying the matrix M to this vector:\n\nM * [t; 2t +1] = [4*t + (-1)*(2t +1); 2*t +1*(2t +1)]\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\nFirst component:\n\n4t - (2t +1) =4t -2t -1 =2t -1\n\nSecond component:\n\n2t + (2t +"

            "output": "1)=4t +1\n\nSo, the transformed point is (2t -1, 4t +1)\n\nNow, to eliminate the parameter t to find the equation of the image line.\n\nFrom the first component: x = 2t -1 --> t = (x +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into the second component:\n\ny =4t +1 =4*( (x +1)/2 ) +1 =2(x +1) +1=2x +2 +1=2x +3\n\nSo, again, y=2x +3. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the image of the line is y=2x+3.\n\nWait, but before finalizing, let me just think: is there a reason why the slope remains the same? Or is that just a coincidence?\n\nI recall that linear transformations preserve lines, but they can change the slope only if the transformation includes scaling or shearing. In this case, the matrix M is:\n\n[4  -1]\n[2   1]\n\nLet me compute its determinant to see if it's invertible.\n\nDeterminant = (4)(1) - (-1)(2)=4 +2=6.\n\nSo, the matrix is invertible, so it's a linear transformation. Since determinant is 6, which is non-zero, so the transformation is non-degenerate.\n\nBut why does the slope remain 2? Because the transformation is not just a scaling by 2, but a combination of scaling and shearing.\n\nWait, let's see: the original line has slope 2. The transformed line also has slope 2. Is that expected?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the matrix M scales the line by 2. Hmm, but the determinant is 6, so the area scaling factor is 6, which doesn't directly relate to the slope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps because the direction vector of the original line is preserved in some way, but I think that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, the original line has a direction vector (1,2), since slope is 2. What is the image of this direction vector under M?\n\nLet me compute M*(1;2):\n\nFirst component:4*1 + (-1)*2=4 -2=2\n\nSecond component:2*1 +1*2=2 +2=4\n\nSo, the direction vector becomes (2,4), which is just"

Therefore, the slope of the transformed line is the same as the original line's slope. That's why the slope is still 2. The intercept changes, but the slope remains.\n\nTherefore, the image line has the same slope, but different intercept. So, the calculation seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is y=2x+3. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another point on the original line to be thorough. Let's take x = -1 on the original line. Then y =2*(-1)+1 =-2 +1 =-1. So, the point (-1, -1). Let's apply M to this point.\n\nOriginal vector [-1; -1].\n\nApplying M:\n\nFirst component:4*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)= -4 +1 =-3\n\nSecond component:2*(-1) +1*(-1)= -2 -1 =-3\n\nSo, the image is (-3, -3). Let's see if this lies on y=2x +3.\n\nPlugging x=-3 into the equation: y=2*(-3)+3= -6 +3= -3. Which matches the y-coordinate. So, yes, that point is on the line.\n\nAnother check: take x=2 on original line. Then y=2*2+1=5. So, point (2,5). Apply M:\n\nFirst component:4*2 + (-1)*5=8 -5=3\n\nSecond component:2*2 +1*5=4 +5=9\n\nSo, image is (3,9). Check if (3,9) is on y=2x+3: 2*3 +3=6+3=9. Correct.\n\nTherefore, all checks out. So, the image is indeed y=2x+3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is y=2x+3, so boxed form is \\boxed{y = 2x + 3}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{y = 2x + 3}\n</think>\n\nTo find the image of the line \\( y = 2x + 1 \\) under the matrix \\("
