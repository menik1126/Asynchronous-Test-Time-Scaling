            "output": "First, I recognize that the given fraction is \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\). To convert it into a terminating decimal, the denominator must only have factors of 2 and 5 after simplification.\n\nI factor the denominator by separating the powers of 2 and 5. This gives me \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\).\n\nNext, I will make the denominator a power of 10 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the necessary amounts of 2 and 5 to balance the exponents.\n\nI calculate the total number of 2s and 5s needed to reach the highest power, which is \\(5^7\\) or \\(2^2\\). To convert the denominator to \\(10^7\\), I multiply the denominator by \\(2^{7-2} = 2^5\\) and the numerator by \\(2^5\\) as well.\n\nThen, I multiply the denominator by \\(5^0 = 1\\) to maintain the balance. This results in multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^5 \\cdot 5^0 = 32\\).\n\nAfter these adjustments, the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{21 \\cdot 32}{10^7}\\).\n\nFinally, I perform the multiplication in the numerator: \\(21 \\times 32 = 672\\). So, the fraction simplifies to \\(\\frac{672}{10^7}\\).\n\nTo find the decimal, I divide 672 by 10,000,000, which gives me 0.000672.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).\n   - For the decimal to terminate, the denominator must be of the form \\(10^n\\), where \\(n\\) is a positive integer.\n\n2. **Equalize the Powers of 2 and 5:**\n   - The current powers are \\(2^2\\) and \\(5^7\\).\n   - To make them equal, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^5\\) (since \\(5^7\\) has a higher power than \\(2^2\\)):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21}{2^2"
