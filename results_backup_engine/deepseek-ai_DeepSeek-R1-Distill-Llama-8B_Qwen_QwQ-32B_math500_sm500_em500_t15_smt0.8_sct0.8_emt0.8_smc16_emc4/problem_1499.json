I need to find how many elements are in both sets, which means I need to find the intersection of these two sets.\n\nStarting with the first set, the prime numbers less than 30. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I'll list out all the prime numbers below 30. They are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. That gives me a total of 10 prime numbers.\n\nNext, I'll consider the second set, which is all odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. So, the set of odd numbers greater than zero is infinite, but since I'm looking for the intersection with the prime numbers less than 30, I only need to consider the odd prime numbers from the first set.\n\nLooking back at the list of primes less than 30, I can see that all of them except for the number 2 are odd. Since 2 is the only even prime number, it won't be included in the intersection. Therefore, out of the 10 prime numbers less than 30, 9 of them are odd.\n\nSo, the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero consists of the 9 prime numbers that are odd and less than 30.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many elements are in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the prime numbers less than 30.**  \n   The prime numbers less than 30 are:  \n   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29  \n   Total: 10 prime numbers.\n\n2. **Identify the odd numbers greater than zero.**  \n   Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. Therefore, all prime numbers except for 2 are odd.  \n   The odd prime numbers less than 30 are:  \n   3, 5,"

Since the set of odd numbers greater than zero excludes even numbers, the only prime number excluded from the intersection is 2.  \n   Thus, the intersection contains the 9 odd prime numbers listed above.\n\n\\boxed{9}"
