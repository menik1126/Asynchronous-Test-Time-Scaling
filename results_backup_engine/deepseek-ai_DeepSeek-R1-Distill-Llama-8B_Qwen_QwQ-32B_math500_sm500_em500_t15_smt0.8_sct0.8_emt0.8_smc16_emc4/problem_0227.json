Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Bill walks half a mile south. Then he goes three-quarters of a mile east, and finally another half a mile south. So I guess I can model his path on a coordinate plane to make it easier.\n\nLet me imagine a Cartesian plane where Bill starts at the origin (0,0). South would be the negative y-axis direction, and east would be the positive x-axis direction. So when he walks south, his y-coordinate decreases, and when he walks east, his x-coordinate increases.\n\nSo, starting point: (0,0).\n\nFirst movement: half a mile south. That means subtracting 0.5 from the y-coordinate. So after that, he's at (0, -0.5).\n\nSecond movement: three-quarters mile east. That means adding 0.75 to the x-coordinate. So now he's at (0.75, -0.5).\n\nThird movement: another half mile south. Subtracting another 0.5 from the y-coordinate. So now his final position is (0.75, -1.0).\n\nNow, I need to find the straight-line distance from his starting point (0,0) to his final position (0.75, -1.0). I think the distance formula is the way to go here. The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is the square root of [(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].\n\nPlugging in the values: x1=0, y1=0, x2=0.75, y2=-1.0.\n\nSo, distance = sqrt[(0.75 - 0)^2 + (-1.0 - 0)^2] = sqrt[0.75^2 + (-1.0)^2].\n\nCalculating 0.75 squared: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625.\n\nCalculating (-1.0)^2: that's 1.0.\n\nAdding them together: 0.5625 + 1.0 = 1.5625.\n\nTaking the square root of 1.5625. Hmm, what's the square root of 1.5625? I think it's"

Starting at (0,0), moving south 0.5 brings him to (0,-0.5). Then east 0.75 brings him to (0.75,-0.5). Then another south 0.5 brings him to (0.75,-1.0). So the displacement components are 0.75 in the x-direction and -1.0 in the y-direction. The distance is sqrt(0.75^2 + 1^2) which is sqrt(0.5625 + 1) = sqrt(1.5625) = 1.25. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think that's it. So the answer is 1.25 miles.\n</think>\n\nBill starts at (0,0). After walking south 0.5 miles, he is at (0, -0.5). Then, he walks east 0.75 miles to (0.75, -0.5). Finally, walking another 0.5 miles south brings him to (0.75, -1.0). Using the distance formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(0.75 - 0)^2 + (-1.0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{0.5625 + 1.0} = \\sqrt{1.5625} = 1.25\n\\]\n\nThe nearest hundredth is 1.25.\n\n\\boxed{1.25}"
