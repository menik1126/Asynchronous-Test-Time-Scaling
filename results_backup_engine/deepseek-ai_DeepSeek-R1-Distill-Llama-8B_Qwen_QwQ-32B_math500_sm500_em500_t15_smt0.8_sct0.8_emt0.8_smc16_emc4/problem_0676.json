Since the total number of cards is 54, I need to ensure that \\( 5x \\leq 54 \\).\n\nNext, I'll solve the inequality \\( 5x \\leq 54 \\) to find the maximum possible value of \\( x \\). Dividing both sides by 5 gives \\( x \\leq 10.8 \\). Since \\( x \\) must be an integer and at least 2, the maximum value of \\( x \\) is 10.\n\nNow, I'll list all integer values of \\( x \\) starting from 2 up to 10. These values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\nFinally, I'll count the number of possible values of \\( x \\), which is 9.\n\nTherefore, there are **9 possible values of \\( x \\)**.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\) when distributing 54 cards among \\( x \\) players with each player receiving at least 5 cards, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - **Total Cards:** 54\n   - **Minimum Cards per Player:** \\( y = 5 \\)\n   - **Number of Players:** \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n\n2. **Determine the Maximum Possible \\( x \\):**\n   - Since each player must receive at least 5 cards, the maximum number of players \\( x \\) cannot exceed the total number of cards divided by 5.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{54}{5} = 10.8\n   \\]\n   - Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, the maximum possible value of \\( x \\) is **10**.\n\n3. **List Possible Integer Values of \\( x \\):**\n   - \\( x \\) can take any integer value from 2 up to 10.\n   - Possible values of \\( x \\): 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,"
