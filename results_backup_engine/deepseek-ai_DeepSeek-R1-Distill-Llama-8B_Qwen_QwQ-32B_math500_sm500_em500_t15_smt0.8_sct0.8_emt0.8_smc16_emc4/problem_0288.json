We need to find w, which is the result of rotating z around c by π/4 radians counter-clockwise. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let me recall. Rotating a complex number around another complex number isn't just multiplying by e^{iθ}; that would be if we're rotating around the origin. Instead, we have to translate z so that c becomes the origin, perform the rotation, then translate back. That makes sense because rotating around a point other than the origin requires translating the point to the origin first, doing the rotation, then shifting back.\n\nSo, the general formula for rotating a complex number z around a point c by an angle θ is:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^{iθ}\n\nYes, that rings a bell. So, in this case, θ is π/4. Therefore, we need to compute e^{iπ/4}.\n\nLet me calculate e^{iπ/4}. I remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so for π/4, cos(π/4) is sqrt(2)/2 and sin(π/4) is also sqrt(2)/2. Therefore, e^{iπ/4} = sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2. Got that.\n\nNow, we need to find z - c. Let me compute z - c first. z is 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3sqrt(2))i, and c is 2 - 3i. Subtracting c from z:\n\nz - c = [2 + sqrt(2) - 2] + [- (3 + 3sqrt(2))i - (-3i)]\n= [sqrt(2)] + [-3 - 3sqrt(2) + 3]i\nSimplify that:\n\nReal part: sqrt(2) - 2 + 2? Wait, hold on. Let me do the subtraction step by step.\n\nz has real part: 2 + sqrt(2)\nc has real part: 2\nSo, z - c real part: (2 + sqrt(2)) -"

The imaginary part of c is -3. So:\n\nImaginary part of z - c is (-3 - 3sqrt(2)) - (-3) = (-3 - 3sqrt(2)) + 3 = -3sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, z - c = sqrt(2) - 3sqrt(2)i. Let me confirm that again:\n\nYes, real part is sqrt(2), imaginary part is -3sqrt(2). So z - c = sqrt(2) - 3sqrt(2)i. That seems right.\n\nNow, we need to multiply this by e^{iπ/4}, which is (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2). Let me write that as (sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i).\n\nSo, let me compute (sqrt(2) - 3sqrt(2)i) * (sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i). Let me factor out sqrt(2) from the first term and sqrt(2)/2 from the second term.\n\nFirst term: sqrt(2)*(1 - 3i)\nSecond term: sqrt(2)/2*(1 + i)\n\nMultiplying them together: sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 * (1 - 3i)(1 + i)\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 2*(1/2) = 1.

Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the second approach, when I broke it down as (sqrt(2) -3 sqrt(2)i) multiplied by (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2), I think I might have miscalculated the fourth term.\n\nWait, let me recast the fourth term again:\n\nThe fourth term is -3 sqrt(2)i multiplied by i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, that's (-3 sqrt(2) * i) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = (-3 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2) * (i * i)\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so that's (-3 * 2 /2) * (i²) = (-3) * (-1) = 3.

Let me cross-verify step by step.\n\nFirst, z is 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 +3sqrt(2))i.\n\nc is 2 -3i.\n\nSo, z - c is (2 + sqrt(2) -2) + (-3 -3sqrt(2) - (-3))i = sqrt(2) + (-3sqrt(2))i. So yes, z - c = sqrt(2) -3sqrt(2)i.\n\nMultiplying by e^{iπ/4} which is sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nAs we saw, that product is 4 -2i.\n\nThen, adding c: 2 -3i + 4 -2i.\n\nSo, 2+4 =6; -3i -2i= -5i. So w =6 -5i.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check another way: using a different formula.\n\nAnother way: to rotate around c by π/4, which is equivalent to translating the system so that c becomes the origin, then multiplying by e^{iπ/4}, then translating back.\n\nWhich is exactly what we did: w = c + (z - c)e^{iπ/4}.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me see perhaps an alternative approach, maybe using vectors or geometry. Let me think about it.\n\nAlternatively, rotation in complex plane can also be represented as:\n\nw = c + |z - c| e^{i(θ + arg(z - c))}\n\nBut, that might complicate things, as we have to compute the magnitude and the argument, which is the same as multiplying by e^{iθ} after translation, which is essentially the same approach.\n\nAlternatively, to find the rotation, I can consider moving the origin to c by subtracting c, then applying the rotation, then moving back. So, yes, indeed, same as above.\n\nSo, perhaps 6 -5i is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me test with another method.
