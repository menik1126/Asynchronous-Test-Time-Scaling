The prices are as follows: Brazil and France are each $6$ cents, Peru is $4$ cents, and Spain is $5$ cents. \n\nLooking at the '70s, there are 12 stamps from Brazil, 12 from France, 6 from Peru, and 13 from Spain. \n\nFirst, I'll calculate the total number of stamps in the '70s: 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 stamps.\n\nNext, I'll find the total cost by multiplying the quantity by the respective prices:\n- Brazil: 12 stamps × $6$ cents = $72$ cents\n- France: 12 stamps × $6$ cents = $72$ cents\n- Peru: 6 stamps × $4$ cents = $24$ cents\n- Spain: 13 stamps × $5$ cents = $65$ cents\n\nAdding these together: $72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233$ cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per '70s stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the number of stamps: 233 ÷ 43 ≈ 5.418 cents. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's approximately 5.4 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Quantity and Price of Each Stamp:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 stamps @ **6** cents each\n   - **France:** 12 stamps @ **6** cents each\n   - **Peru:** 6 stamps @ **4** cents each\n   - **Spain:** 13 stamps @ **5** cents each\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \\text{ stamps}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute the Total Cost for All 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Brazil:} & \\quad 12 \\times 6 = 72 \\text{ cents} \\\\\n   \\text{France:} & \\quad 12 \\times 6 = 72 \\text{ cents} \\\\\n   \\text{Peru:} & \\quad 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ cents"

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
