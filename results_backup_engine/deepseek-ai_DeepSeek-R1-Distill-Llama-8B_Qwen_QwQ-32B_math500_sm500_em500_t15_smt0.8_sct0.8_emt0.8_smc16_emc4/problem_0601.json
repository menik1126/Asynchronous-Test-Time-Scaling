            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where there's a circle defined by the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\) and a parabola defined by \\(y^2 = 8x\\). They say these two have two common tangents, forming four points of tangency. Then, I need to find the area of the quadrilateral formed by these four points. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me visualize what's going on here. The circle is centered at the origin with a radius of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), right? Because \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\) is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). The parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\) opens to the right because it's in the form \\(y^2 = 4px\\), where p is 2, so it's wider than the standard parabola.\n\nThey mention that there are two common tangents. I remember that a common tangent to two curves touches each curve at exactly one point. Since they have two common tangents, there are four points of tangency in total—two on the circle and two on the parabola. These four points form a quadrilateral, and I need to find its area.\n\nAlright, so how do I find the equations of these common tangents? Well, maybe I can find the equations of the tangent lines that touch both the circle and the parabola. Once I have the equations, I can find the points where these lines touch the circle and the parabola. Then, I can use those four points to find the shape of the quadrilateral and compute its area.\n\nSo, let's start by recalling that the equation of a tangent to a circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\\) at a point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) on the circle can be written as \\(xx_1 + yy_1 = r^2\\). But in this case, the circle is \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\), so the tangent at \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is \\(xx_1 + yy_1 = 2\\).\n\nNow, for the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\), I need a tangent line.

So, the parametric equations for the parabola are \\(x = 2t^2\\), \\(y = 4t\\). Then, the equation of the tangent at parameter t would be \\(ty = x + 2t^2\\).\n\nSo, if I have a tangent line that's common to both the circle and the parabola, its equation must satisfy both tangency conditions. So, the same line must be expressible as a tangent to the circle and a tangent to the parabola.\n\nLet me attempt to set up the equations. Let's suppose the equation of the tangent line is \\(y = mx + c\\). Since it's a common tangent, it must satisfy the condition of being tangent to both the circle and the parabola.\n\nFirst, for the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\). The condition for a line \\(y = mx + c\\) to be tangent to this parabola is that the distance from the focus to the line is equal to the distance from the directrix to the line. Wait, but maybe using substitution is easier.\n\nSubstituting \\(y = mx + c\\) into \\(y^2 = 8x\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n(mx + c)^2 = 8x\n\\]\n\\[\nm^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 - 8x = 0\n\\]\nWhich is a quadratic in x:\n\\[\nm^2x^2 + (2mc - 8)x + c^2 = 0\n\\]\nFor this to be tangent, the discriminant must be zero.
