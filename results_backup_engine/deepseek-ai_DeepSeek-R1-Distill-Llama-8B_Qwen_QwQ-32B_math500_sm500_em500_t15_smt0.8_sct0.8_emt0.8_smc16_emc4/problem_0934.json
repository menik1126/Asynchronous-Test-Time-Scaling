            "output": "To find the number of trailing zeros in 42 factorial, I need to determine how many times the number 10 is a factor in 42!.\n\nSince 10 is equal to 2 multiplied by 5, I'll count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of 5s in the factors of 42!. This can be done by dividing 42 by 5 and continuing with the quotient until it's less than 5.\n\nSo, 42 divided by 5 is 8 with a remainder, then 8 divided by 5 is 1 with a remainder, and 1 divided by 5 is 0. Adding up these quotients gives a total of 9 fives.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 2s in the factors of 42!. Similarly, I'll divide 42 by 2, then 42/2=21, 21/2=10 with a remainder, 10/2=5, 5/2=2 with a remainder, 2/2=1, and 1/2=0. Adding these up gives a total of 21 twos.\n\nIn each pair of 2 and 5, a trailing zero is produced. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the smaller count of 2s and 5s, which is 9.\n\nThus, 42! has 9 trailing zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) (42 factorial), we need to find how many times the number 10 is a factor in \\(42!\\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we'll count the number of pairs of these factors in the prime decomposition of \\(42!\\).\n\n**Step 1: Count the number of 5s in \\(42!\\)**\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\quad \\text{(from multiples of 5)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\quad \\text{(from multiples of 25)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\quad \\text{(as 125 > 42)}\n\\"
