The fifth term is 3 × 2 = 6. The sixth term is 6 + 3 = 9. The seventh term is 9 × 3 = 27.\n\nNext, I'll continue generating the sequence to find the pattern. The eighth term is 27 + 4 = 31. The ninth term is 31 × 4 = 124. The tenth term is 124 + 5 = 129. The eleventh term is 129 × 5 = 645.\n\nNow, I'll list the terms: 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, 31, 124, 129, 645.\n\nLooking for the first term greater than 125, I see that 129 is the next term after 124. The term after 129 is 645, which is significantly larger.\n\nTherefore, the first term that exceeds 125 is 129.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to find the first term greater than 125.\n\n1. **Initial Terms:**\n   - **Term 1:** 0\n   - **Term 2:** \\( 0 + 1 = 1 \\)\n   - **Term 3:** \\( 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)\n   - **Term 4:** \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n   - **Term 5:** \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)\n   - **Term 6:** \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\)\n   - **Term 7:** \\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\)\n   - **Term 8:** \\( 27 + 4 = 31 \\)\n   - **Term 9:** \\( 31 \\times 4 = 124 \\)\n   - **Term 10:** \\( 124 + 5 = 129 \\)\n\n2. **Identifying the First Term Greater Than 125:**\n   - **Term 10:** 129 is greater than 125.\n   - **Term 11:** \\( 129 \\times 5 ="

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
