I remember that logarithms have some properties that can help simplify equations. Let me write down what I know.\n\nFirst, the equation is log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's like multiplying the arguments. So, log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(a * c). Applying that here, I can combine the two logs:\n\nlog₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nOh, wait, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, right? So that simplifies to x² - y². So now the equation becomes:\n\nlog₆(x² - y²) = 2.\n\nNow, if I have log_b(z) = w, that means z = b^w. So, applying that here, I get:\n\nx² - y² = 6^2.\n\n6 squared is 36, so:\n\nx² - y² = 36.  [Equation 1]\n\nAlright, that's one equation. Now, moving on to the second part of the problem: log base y of (5x) equals 2. So, log_y(5x) = 2. \n\nSimilar to before, if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c. So, applying that here, 5x = y^2. Let me write that as:\n\n5x = y².  [Equation 2]\n\nSo now, I have two equations: Equation 1 is x² - y² = 36, and Equation 2 is 5x = y².\n\nHmm, maybe I can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1. Since Equation 2 says y² = 5x, I can replace y² in Equation 1 with 5x.\n\nLet's do that:\n\nx² - (5x) = 36.\n\nSo, simplifying that:\n\nx² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nNow, I"

            "output": " have a quadratic equation in terms of x: x² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nI can try to solve this quadratic equation. Let me see if it factors easily. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm. Let me think:\n\nFactors of -36: 1 and -36, 2 and -18, 3 and -12, 4 and -9, 6 and -6. \n\nLooking for a pair that adds to -5. Let's see:\n\n4 and -9: 4 + (-9) = -5. Yes, that's it!\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0. \n\nSetting each factor to zero:\n\nx + 4 = 0 ⇒ x = -4,\nx - 9 = 0 ⇒ x = 9.\n\nSo, possible solutions are x = -4 or x = 9.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if these solutions are valid because logs are only defined for positive numbers. So, let me see.\n\nFrom Equation 2: 5x = y². Since y² is always non-negative, 5x must be non-negative. Therefore, x must be non-negative because 5 is positive. So, x can't be -4 because that's negative. So, we can discard x = -4.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nLet me check if this works with Equation 2. If x = 9, then y² = 5 * 9 = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But, looking back at the original problem, we have log₆(x - y) and log₆(x + y). \n\nWait, x - y and x + y must be positive because you can't take the log of a non-positive number. So, let's check for y positive and negative.\n\nIf y is positive: x = 9, y = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708.\n\nThen x - y ≈ 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292 > 0,\nx + y ≈ 9 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708 > 0.\n\nThat's fine.\n\nIf y is negative: y = -sqrt(45) ≈ -6.708,\n\nThen"

No, because x is 9 in both cases.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x = 9.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake when I substituted. Let me go back.\n\nEquation 2: 5x = y², so y² = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). \n\nEquation 1: x² - y² = 36.\n\nIf x = 9, then 9² - y² = 36 ⇒ 81 - y² = 36 ⇒ y² = 81 - 36 = 45. Which matches Equation 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, x = 9 is the solution.\n\nI think that's it. So, the answer is x = 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given equations, we start by combining the logarithms and converting them into exponential form.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\)\n2. \\(\\log_y (5x) = 2\\)\n\nFrom the first equation, using logarithm properties:\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2 \\implies (x - y)(x + y) = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = 36\n\\]\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\n\\log_y (5x) = 2 \\implies 5x = y^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(y^2 = 5x\\) into the first equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x = 36 \\implies x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\\[\n(x + 4)(x - 9) = 0 \\implies x = -4 \\text{ or } x = 9\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) must be non-negative (as \\(5x = y^2\\) and \\(y"
