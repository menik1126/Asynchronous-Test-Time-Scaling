            "output": "Alright, so I need to figure out the value of |(1 - i)^8| where i is the imaginary unit. Hmm, okay, let me start by recalling some basic concepts from complex numbers. First, I know that the modulus (or absolute value) of a complex number a + bi is given by the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So |a + bi| = sqrt(a² + b²). \n\nIn this case, the complex number is (1 - i). So let me write that down: (1 - i). To find its modulus, I can apply the formula. Here, a is 1 and b is -1. So |1 - i| = sqrt(1² + (-1)²) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). That makes sense because the modulus of 1 - i should be sqrt(2).\n\nBut wait, I need to find |(1 - i)^8|. So that's the modulus of (1 - i) raised to the 8th power. Hmm, I seem to remember that when you raise a complex number to a power, the modulus gets raised to that power. Is that right? Let me think. So |z^n| = |z|^n, where z is a complex number and n is an integer. Okay, so that should hold true here.\n\nTherefore, |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8. Since I already found |1 - i| = sqrt(2), then |(1 - i)^8| = (sqrt(2))^8. Now I need to compute (sqrt(2))^8.\n\nWait, sqrt(2) is the same as 2^(1/2). So when I raise that to the 8th power, it's 2^(1/2 * 8) = 2^(4) = 16. Let me verify that calculation. sqrt(2)^8 = (sqrt(2)^2)^4. Since sqrt(2)^2 is 2, then (2)^4 is 16. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about (1 - i)^2 first and see if that helps. Let's compute (1 - i)^2. Using the formula (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b², so (1)^2 - 2*("

            "output": "1)*(i) + (i)^2. Wait, but that's (1 - 2i + i²). Since i² is -1, so that becomes 1 - 2i -1 = (1 -1) -2i = 0 - 2i = -2i. So (1 - i)^2 = -2i. \n\nHmm, interesting. Then (1 - i)^4 would be (-2i)^2 = (-2)^2 * i^2 = 4 * (-1) = -4. Then (1 - i)^8 would be (-4)^2 = 16. So that also gives 16. \n\nSo both methods lead to the same answer. The modulus approach gives 16, and expanding the power step by step also gives 16. That's reassuring. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use polar form. Let me try that. The complex number 1 - i can be represented in polar form as r*(cosθ + i sinθ). The modulus r is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), which we already have. The angle θ is the argument. Since the point (1, -1) is in the fourth quadrant, the angle θ is -π/4 or 7π/4. \n\nSo in polar form, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * [cos(-π/4) + i sin(-π/4)]. When we raise this to the 8th power, using De Moivre's theorem: [r*(cosθ + i sinθ)]^n = r^n [cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ)]. \n\nTherefore, (1 - i)^8 = (sqrt(2))^8 * [cos(8*(-π/4)) + i sin(8*(-π/4))]. \n\nCalculating the modulus part first: (sqrt(2))^8 is 16 as before. The angle part: 8*(-π/4) = -2π. The cosine of -2π is cos(2π) = 1, and sine of -2π is sin(2π) = 0. So the complex number becomes 16*(1 + 0i) = 16. Therefore, the modulus of that is 16, since it's a real number. \n\nSo all"

Calculate the modulus of (1 - i):\n   |1 - i| = √(1² + (-1)²) = √2.\n\n2. Raise this modulus to the 8th power:\n   (√2)^8 = (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{16}."
