This is because if 24 is divisible by \\( n \\), then \\( 2^{24} \\) can be written as \\( (2^{24/n})^n \\), which is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n\nNext, I'll list all the divisors of 24. These divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Although 1 is a divisor, the problem specifies that \\( n > 1 \\), so I'll exclude 1 from the list.\n\nThis leaves the possible values of \\( n \\) as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Counting these, there are 7 possible values of \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - The number \\( 2^{24} \\) is already expressed as a power of a prime number with an exponent of 24.\n   \n2. **Understanding Perfect Powers**:\n   - A number \\( a \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( a = k^n \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if the exponent 24 is divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Determining Divisors of 24**:\n   - The divisors of 24 (including 1 and 24) are: 1, 2,"
