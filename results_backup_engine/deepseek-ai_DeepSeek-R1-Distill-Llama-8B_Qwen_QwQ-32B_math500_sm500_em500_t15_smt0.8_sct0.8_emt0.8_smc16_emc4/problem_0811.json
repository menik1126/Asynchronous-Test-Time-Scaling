I know that the leading coefficient a_n is 2, and the constant term a_0 is 66. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, I can write it in factored form as f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_k), where each r_i is an integer, and all r_i are distinct. The constant term a_0 is the product of the roots multiplied by (-1)^k * 2, right? So, 2 * (-1)^k * r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_k = 66. That means (-1)^k * r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_k = 33.\n\nWait, 33 factors into 1*3*11 or 3*11. But we can have negative factors as well since the roots can be negative. So, possible sets of roots could include ±1, ±3, ±11, etc., as long as their product is 33 or -33 depending on the number of roots.\n\nBut the polynomial could have more than three roots because we're looking for distinct integers. For example, maybe it has four roots. Let's think about that. If it has four roots, then their product times 2 should be 66. So, the product of the roots would be 33, and since it's four roots, maybe two of them are negatives. For example, 1, -1, 3, and 11. Then the product is 1*(-1)*3*11 = -33, and 2*(-33) = -66, but a_0 is 66. Hmm, so maybe we need to adjust the sign.\n\nWait, no, because a_0 is 66, so actually, the product of the roots times 2 should be 66, so if the roots are r_1, r_2, ..., r_k, then 2*(r_1*r_2*...*r_k)*(-1)^k = 66. Therefore, r_1*r_2*...*r_k = 66 / [2*(-1"

But here, the polynomial is not monic; it's leading coefficient is 2. So, the product of the roots is (a_0 / a_n) * (-1)^k. Wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nSuppose the polynomial is f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_k). Then expanding this, the constant term is 2*(-r_1)(-r_2)...(-r_k) = 2*(-1)^k (r_1 r_2 ... r_k). So, the constant term a_0 is equal to 2*(-1)^k (r_1 r_2 ... r_k). Since a_0 is given as 66, we have:\n\n2*(-1)^k (r_1 r_2 ... r_k) = 66\n\nTherefore, (-1)^k (r_1 r_2 ... r_k) = 33.\n\nSo, the product of the roots (r_1 r_2 ... r_k) is either 33 or -33, depending on whether k is even or odd. Wait, actually, it's equal to 33*(-1)^k? Wait, no, let me see:\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n(r_1 r_2 ... r_k) = 33 * (-1)^k / 1, since 2*(-1)^k (product) = 66 => product = 66/(2*(-1)^k) = 33/(-1)^k. Wait, that's different. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the equation is:\n\n2*(-1)^k (product of roots) = 66\n\nSo, solving for the product of roots:\n\nproduct = 66 / [2*(-1)^k] = 33 / (-1)^k\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots is 33 divided by (-1)^k. Hmm, so if k is even, then (-1)^k is 1, so product is 33. If k is odd, then (-1)^k is -1, so product is"

Now, since the roots are distinct integers, we need to find sets of integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and then find the polynomial with such roots that has the smallest possible |a_{n-1}|.\n\nNow, a_{n-1} is the coefficient of x^{n-1}, which comes from the sum of the roots multiplied by (-1)^{1} times the leading coefficient. Wait, let me recall Vieta's formula for a polynomial.\n\nIn general, for a polynomial f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0, we have:\n\na_{n-1} = a_n * (-1)^1 * (sum of roots)\n\nSo, a_{n-1} = 2 * (-1) * (r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_k) = -2*(sum of roots).\n\nTherefore, |a_{n-1}| = 2 * |sum of roots|.\n\nSo, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize |sum of roots|.\n\nTherefore, our problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33 (depending on k being even or odd), and whose sum is as close to zero as possible.\n\nSo, the main goal is to find such a set of integers with product ±33 and the minimal possible sum, in absolute value.\n\nSo, first, let's factor 33 into its prime factors: 33 = 3 * 11. So, the possible integer roots could be combinations of 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, 33, -33.\n\nBut because the roots have to be distinct integers, we'll have to choose a set of integers from that list such that their product is either 33 or -33, and their sum is minimized.\n\nLet me try to find the sets.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible factorizations:\n\nCase 1: k=1.

Wait, no, in linear case, the polynomial is 2(x - r1), so a_0 is 2*(-r1) =66, so -2r1 =66, so r1 = -33. Then a_{0}=66, and the coefficient a_{n-1}=2, which is the leading coefficient. Wait, in a linear polynomial, the coefficients are a1x + a0, so the coefficient of x is 2, so a_{1}=2, but the question is about a_{n-1}, where n is the degree, so for linear (n=1), a_{n-1}=a_0, which is 66?
