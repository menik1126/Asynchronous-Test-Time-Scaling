            "output": "First, I'll calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = πr²h. Given the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, the volume will be π × 3² × 8 = 72π cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. With the radius of the spherical tank being 6 cm, the volume will be (4/3)π × 6³ = (4/3)π × 216 = 288π cubic centimeters.\n\nFinally, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, I'll divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker. So, 288π divided by 72π equals 4. Therefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank by following a step-by-step approach.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker\nThe volume \\( V_{\\text{cylinder}} \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( r = 3 \\) cm (radius of the cylindrical beaker)\n- \\( h = 8 \\) cm (height of the cylindrical beaker)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank\nThe volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( R = 6 \\) cm (radius of the spherical tank)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n"
