The formula is \\( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\), where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term and \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\nGiven that the fourth term \\( a_4 \\) is 200 and the eighth term \\( a_8 \\) is 500, I can set up two equations based on the formula.\n\nFor the fourth term: \\( 200 = a_1 + 3d \\).\n\nFor the eighth term: \\( 500 = a1 + 7d \\).\n\nNow, I can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \\( a_1 \\): \\( 500 - 200 = (a1 + 7d) - (a1 + 3d) \\), which simplifies to \\( 300 = 4d \\). Solving for \\( d \\) gives \\( d = 75 \\).\n\nNext, I'll substitute \\( d = 75 \\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find \\( a_1 \\): \\( 200 = a1 + 3(75) \\), so \\( a1 = 200 - 225 = -25 \\).\n\nFinally, to find the sixth term, I'll use the formula again: \\( a_6 = a1 + 5d = -25 + 5(75) = -25 + 375 = 350 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Arithmetic Sequence Formula:**\n   \n   The \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( a_1 \\) is the first term,\n   - \\( d \\) is the common difference,\n   - \\( a_n \\) is the \\( n \\)-th term.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Using Given Information:**\n   \n   We are given:\n   - The fourth term (\\( a_4 \\)) is 200.\n   - The eighth term (\\( a_8 \\)) is 500.\n\n   Plugging these into the formula:\n   \\[\n   a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \\quad"
