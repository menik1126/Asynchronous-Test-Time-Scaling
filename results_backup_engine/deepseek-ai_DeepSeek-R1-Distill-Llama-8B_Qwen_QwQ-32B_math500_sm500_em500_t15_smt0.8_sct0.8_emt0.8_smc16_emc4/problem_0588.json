            "output": "First, I need to simplify the given equation. The equation is 5² minus 4 times (5 minus a) squared, divided by 3, and the whole thing equals 63.\n\nSo, I'll start by calculating 5 squared, which is 25. That gives me 25 minus 4 times (5 minus a) squared divided by 3 equals 63.\n\nNext, I'll move the 25 to the other side by subtracting 25 from both sides. This simplifies the equation to -4 times (5 minus a) squared divided by 3 equals 63 minus 25, which is 38.\n\nThen, I'll multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator. This leaves me with -4 times (5 minus a) squared equals 114.\n\nAfter that, I'll divide both sides by -4 to isolate (5 minus a) squared. This gives me (5 minus a) squared equals -28.75.\n\nSince a squared cannot be negative, this equation has no real solutions. Therefore, there are no real values of a that satisfy the original equation.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\nGiven the equation:\n\\[\n5^2 - 4 \\times \\frac{(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n\\]\n\n1. **Simplify \\(5^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   5^2 = 25\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Subtract 25 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(a\\):**\n   \\[\n   -4 \\times \\frac{(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63 - 25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -4 \\times \\frac{(5 - a)^2}{3} = 38\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   -4 \\times (5 - a)^2 = 38 \\times 3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -4 \\times (5 - a)^2 = 114\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Divide both sides by -4 to solve for \\((5 - a)^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   (5 - a)^2 = \\frac{114}{-4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (5 - a)^2 = -28.75\n   \\]\n   \n"
