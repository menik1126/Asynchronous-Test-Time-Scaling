            "output": "To convert 999 from base 10 to base 6, I first need to determine how many times each power of 6 fits into the number. Starting with the highest power of 6 that is less than or equal to 999, which is 6^5 = 7776. Since 7776 is larger than 999, I move to the next lower power: 6^4 = 1296. This is still larger than 999, so I continue to 6^3 = 216.\n\nNext, I divide 999 by 216 to find the coefficient for 6^3. The division gives 4 with a remainder of 999 - 4*216 = 999 - 864 = 135.\n\nI then take the remainder 135 and divide it by 6^2 = 36. This yields 3 with a remainder of 135 - 3*36 = 135 - 108 = 27.\n\nContinuing with the remainder 27, I divide by 6^1 = 6, which gives 4 with a remainder of 27 - 4*6 = 27 - 24 = 3.\n\nFinally, the last remainder of 3 is less than 6, so it becomes the coefficient for 6^0. Combining all the coefficients, the base 6 equivalent of 999 in base 10 is 4*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6^1 + 3*6^0, which equals 4433 base 6.\n\nThus, the final answer is 4433.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\) to base six, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the largest power of 6 less than or equal to 999.**\n   \n   Calculate powers of 6 until you find one larger than 999:\n   \n   \\[\n   6^0 = 1 \\\\\n   6^1 = 6 \\\\\n   6^2 = 36 \\\\\n   6^3 = 216 \\\\\n   6^4 = 1296 \\quad (\\text{larger than } 999)\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the largest power of 6 needed is \\(6^3 = 216\\).\n\n2. **Determine how many times each power of 6 fits into 999.**\n   \n   Start by dividing 999 by"
