            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to combine a bunch of square roots and their reciprocals into a single fraction. The expression is √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3. The goal is to write this in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I need to find a + b + c. \n\nFirst, I think I should handle each pair separately. Let's look at √2 + 1/√2. Maybe I can combine these two terms into a single term. Similarly, do the same for √3 + 1/√3. \n\nStarting with √2 + 1/√2. Hmm, to add these, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 1 and √2, so the common denominator would be √2. Therefore, I can rewrite √2 as (√2 * √2)/√2, which is (2)/√2. So now, √2 + 1/√2 becomes 2/√2 + 1/√2. \n\nAdding those together, 2/√2 + 1/√2 is (2 + 1)/√2, which simplifies to 3/√2. Wait, but that leaves me with a square root in the denominator, which isn't ideal. Maybe I can rationalize the denominator. To do that, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by √2. So, 3/√2 * √2/√2 = (3√2)/2. \n\nAlright, so √2 + 1/√2 simplifies to (3√2)/2. Got that part.\n\nNow, moving on to √3 + 1/√3. I think I'll do the same thing. Let me write √3 as (√3 * √3)/√3, which is (3)/√3. So, √3 + 1/√3 becomes 3/√3 + 1/√3. \n\nAdding those together, it's (3 + 1)/√3, which is 4/√3. Again, I have a square root in the denominator. Let me rationalize that by multiplying numerator and denominator by √3. So, 4/√3 * √3/√3"

            "output": " = (4√3)/3. \n\nGreat, so √3 + 1/√3 simplifies to (4√3)/3. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, which was the sum of these two results. So, that's (3√2)/2 + (4√3)/3. But I can't add these two terms directly because they have different denominators. I need a common denominator to combine them.\n\nWhat's the least common denominator between 2 and 3? It should be 6. So, I'll convert both fractions to have 6 as the denominator. \n\nFor (3√2)/2, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by 3: (3√2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = (9√2)/6. \n\nFor (4√3)/3, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by 2: (4√3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = (8√3)/6. \n\nNow, adding those together: (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Hmm, that's the combined fraction. So, in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. \n\nWait, can I simplify this further? Let me see. The numerator is 9√2 + 8√3, and the denominator is 6. Are there any common factors between the coefficients 9 and 8 that I can factor out? 9 and 8 are coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1. So, I can't factor out a common factor from a and b. \n\nIs there a way to make the denominator smaller? Well, 6 is the least common multiple of 2 and 3, so I don't think we can have a smaller denominator here. So, 6 is the smallest possible c. \n\nTherefore, the expression is (9√2 + 8√3)/6. So, a = 9, b = 8, c = 6. \n\nAdding them up: 9 + 8 + 6 equals 23. So, the answer should be 23.\n\nBut wait, let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, combining √2 + 1/√2: yes, that gives 3"

Adding them gives (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Since 9, 8, and 6 have no common factors apart from 1, c is indeed minimized. So, a = 9, b = 8, c = 6. \n\nAdding a, b, c: 9 + 8 is 17, plus 6 is 23. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nI can't think of another way to combine these terms without having a common denominator, so I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first simplify each pair of terms involving √2 and √3 separately.\n\n1.
