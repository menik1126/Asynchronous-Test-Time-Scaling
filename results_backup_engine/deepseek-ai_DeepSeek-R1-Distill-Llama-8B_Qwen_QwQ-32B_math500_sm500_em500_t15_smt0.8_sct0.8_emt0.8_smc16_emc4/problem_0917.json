Hmm, okay, so I need to break down 84 into a product of distinct positive integers and find the combination where their sum is as small as possible. \n\nFirst, maybe I should start by factoring 84 to see what integers I can use. Let's see, 84 divided by 2 is 42, then divided by 2 again is 21, and then 21 is 3 times 7. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7. But I need distinct integers, so I can't have 2 twice. So perhaps I can combine some of these prime factors to get larger numbers but still keep them distinct.\n\nLet me list out the possible sets of distinct positive integers whose product is 84. Starting with smaller numbers because I think smaller numbers might give a smaller sum. \n\nIf I take the smallest possible numbers, which are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let me check what their product is. 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 is 24, which is less than 84. So I need to include a larger number. Maybe 1, 2, 3, and 7? Let's check: 1*2*3*7 is 42, still less than 84. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using 1, 2, 4, and 7. Let's multiply: 1*2*4*7 is 56. Still not 84. What if I use 1, 3, 4, and 7? That would be 1*3*4*7 = 84. Okay, that works. The sum here is 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better combination. Let me think about breaking down 84 into more numbers but perhaps avoiding 1. Because 1 doesn't help in minimizing the sum; adding 1 increases the count of numbers but doesn't reduce the sum much. Maybe using more numbers without 1 could lead to a smaller sum.\n\nLet's try 2, 3, and 14. 2*3*14=84. The sum is 2 + 3 + 14 = 19"

So that's another combination with sum 15. \n\nWait, so maybe there are multiple combinations with the same sum. Let's see if we can get lower than 15.\n\nHow about 3, 4, and 7? 3*4*7=84. The sum is 3+4+7=14. Oh! That's better. Wait, but are those all distinct? Yes, 3,4,7 are distinct. So that gives a sum of 14. That's better than 15. \n\nHmm, so maybe that's the way. Let me check if there's another combination. Let's see, 2, 3, and 14 gives 19, which is worse. 2, 7, 6 gives 15. 3,4,7 gives 14. \n\nWhat about 1, 2, 3, 14? That would be 1+2+3+14=20, which is worse. \n\nAlternatively, 1, 2, 7, 6: 1+2+7+6=16. Still higher than 14. \n\nWait, but 3,4,7 is three numbers. Let me see if there's a way to have four numbers with a lower sum. Let's see, maybe 2, 3, 4, and 7 divided into more factors. Wait, 2*3*4*7 is 168, which is too big. \n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down 4 into smaller numbers. Let's see, 3, 4, 7 is 3*4*7=84. If I split 4 into 2 and 2, but they have to be distinct, so 2 and 2 can't be used. Alternatively, 3, 2, 6, 7? Wait, 3*2*6*7 is 252, which is way over. \n\nHmm, maybe another approach.

So 3,4,7 with sum 14 seems to be a valid solution. \n\nBut just to make sure, is there another combination with four numbers? Let's think. Maybe 2, 3, 6, 7? 2*3*6*7=252. No, way over. \n\nOr 2, 4, 3, 7? That's same as 2,3,4,7, which we already saw gives 1*2*3*4*7=168.

Let's see, the smallest possible numbers are 1,2,3, and then 14 as before.
