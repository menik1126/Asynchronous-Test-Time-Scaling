The superfactorial is defined as a tower of factorials, specifically n! raised to the power of itself n! times. That sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what a superfactorial is. From what I know, the superfactorial of a number n is a tower of factorials, so for 4$, it would be 4!^(4!^(4!^...)) with 4! appearing n times, which in this case, 4 times. So it's 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of 4!. \n\nWait, no, actually, hold on. The definition says n\\$ = n!^{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}} with n! at the top. So for 4$, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. That is, a tower of four 4!s. But that might not be correct. Maybe it's a tower starting from the base with n! and then each exponent is also n! So in this case, 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. So that's a tower of four 4!'s. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, actually, for n=4, the superfactorial is 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. So it's 4! raised to (4! raised to (4! raised to 4!)). So it's a tower of four 4!s. That's a lot.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the units digit of 4$. So I need to compute the units digit of this tower. Since it's a tower of factorials, the numbers get really big, but maybe I don't need to compute the entire number—just the units digit.\n\nI remember that for such problems, modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 10, is useful because the units digit is equivalent to the number modulo 10. So if I can compute 4\\$/10, that would give me the units digit.\n\nBut dealing with such a high tower of factorials seems daunting. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst"

            "output": ", compute 4!.\n\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. So the base of the exponent tower is 24, and each exponent is also 24. So the expression is 24^(24^(24^24)). That's a tower of three exponents? Wait, wait, hold on, the original problem says the superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n! raised to a tower of n! copies. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the definition again.\n\nThe problem says: \"The superfactorial n$ is defined as n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}.\" So the number of exponents is n!? Wait, the description says the underbrace is n!. That notation might mean that the number of terms in the exponent tower is n! So for n=4, since 4! =24, the tower has 24 copies of 24 stacked? Wait, that would be a tower of 24 copies? That's way too big. But maybe I misinterpret the notation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the underbrace is indicating that the number of exponents is n. Wait, the problem says \"underbrace{ ... }_{n!}\" which usually the subscript is the number of terms. So the number of terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nWait, that can't be. For n=4, that would be 24 terms, which is a tower of 24 24s. That's an astronomically large number. But maybe the problem is using a different notation. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"n\\$ = \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}\". The underbrace is labeled n!, so that probably means the number of n! terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nTherefore, for n=4, the superfactorial is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24 in the exponent tower. That's a tower of 24 24s. That's way too big to compute directly. But since we"

            "output": " only need the units digit, perhaps we can find patterns or repeat cycles in exponents.\n\nI remember that for modulo 10, the units digit cycles every certain number, especially when dealing with exponents. For example, powers modulo 10 cycle with periods. Let me recall, Euler's theorem might help here.\n\nEuler's theorem states that if two numbers are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. For n=10, φ(10)=4, since 10 has prime factors 2 and 5, and φ(10)=10*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5)=4.\n\nSo, for numbers co-prime to 10, like 3, 7, 9, etc., a^4 ≡ 1 mod 10. However, 24 is not coprime to 10 since it's divisible by 2 and 5. So, Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here.\n\nBut wait, 24 mod 10 is 4. So maybe I can compute 24^k mod 10, which is equal to 4^k mod 10. So, since 4 is not coprime to 10, but 4^k cycles every 2 for k >= 1. Let me confirm:\n\n4^1 =4, 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, and so on. So mod 10, it cycles as 4,6,4,6,... So the cycle length is 2. Therefore, the units digit of 4^k mod 10 is 4 if k is odd, and 6 if k is even.\n\nThus, if I can determine whether the exponent in 24^something is odd or even, I can know whether the units digit is 4 or 6.\n\nBut wait, our problem is 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 copies. So, in the end, it's 24 raised to some huge exponent. I need to compute 24^(huge number) mod 10, which is 4^(huge number) mod 10, which, as above, depends on whether the exponent is odd or even.\n\nSo, what is the exponent?

So the topmost exponent is 24, then the next one is 24^24, then the next is 24^(24^24), etc., down to the base.\n\nBut since we need to compute the exponent of the base 24, which is the entire tower above it. Let me denote the tower as follows:\n\nLet me denote the tower with k levels as T(k). So T(1) =24, T(2)=24^24, T(3)=24^(24^24), and so on up to T(24). So the superfactorial 4$ is T(24).\n\nWe need to compute T(24) mod 10. Since T(24) =24^T(23). So, mod 10, that's 4^T(23) mod 10. As before, since 4 mod 10 is 4, and 4^k mod 10 cycles every 2, so we need to know if T(23) is even or odd.\n\nTherefore, if T(23) is even, then 4^T(23) mod 10 is 6; if it's odd, it's 4. So the key is to determine the parity of T(23).\n\nNow, T(23) is 24^T(22). Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even. Therefore, T(23) is even. Therefore, the exponent T(23) is even, so 4^even mod 10 is 6. Therefore, the units digit would be 6?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. Wait, T(23) is 24^T(22).

So 24^anything mod 10 is equal to 4^anything mod 10. Now, 4 has a cycle of 2 for its exponents mod 10, as we saw earlier. So, if the exponent is even, 4^even is 6 mod 10, and if it's odd, 4^odd is 4 mod 10.\n\nSo, we need to find the exponent mod 2 because the cycle length is 2. So, whether the exponent is even or odd.\n\nSo, for T(24) =24^T(23). So, T(24) mod 10 is 4^{T(23)} mod 10. So if T(23) is even, 4^{T(23)} is 6 mod 10, and if T(23) is odd, 4^{T(23)} is 4 mod 10.\n\nThus, the crux is determining whether T(23) is even or odd.\n\nT(23) is 24^{T(22)}.

Wait, wait.\n\nWait, 24 is even. So 24^k is even for any positive integer k. So T(23)=24^{T(22)} is even.
