            "output": "First, I will perform the prime factorization of 196.\n\nI know that 196 can be divided by 2, so I write 2 as one of its prime factors.\n\nNext, I divide 196 by 2 to get 98.\n\nI will continue this process until I can no longer divide by 2. Dividing 98 by 2 gives 49.\n\nNow, I recognize that 49 is a perfect square. Its square root is 7, which is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of 196 are 2, 2, 2, and 7, which can be written as \\(2^3 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, if a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the number of divisors is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\).\n\nApplying this to 196, the exponents are 3 and 2. So, the number of divisors is (3+1)(2+1), which equals 4 multiplied by 3, resulting in 12.\n\nHence, 196 has 12 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization\nFirst, find the prime factors of 196.\n\n\\[\n196 \\div 2 = 98 \\\\\n98 \\div 2 = 49 \\\\\n49 \\div 7 = 7 \\\\\n7 \\div 7 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the prime factors of 196 are:\n\\[\n196 = 2^3 \\times 7^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Divisor Formula\nA number's total number of divisors can be found by adding one to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying those results.\n\nFor \\(196 = 2^3 \\times 7^2\\):\n- The exponent of 2 is 3. Adding 1 gives \\(3 + 1 = 4\\).\n- The exponent of 7 is 2. Adding 1 gives \\(2 + 1 = 3\\).\n\nNow, multiply these together:\n\\[\n4 \\times 3 = 12\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n196 has \\(\\boxed{12}\\) positive"
