Since the denominator doesn't have any factors of 2 or 5, the decimal is repeating.\n\nNext, I'll perform the division of 31 by 11111 to find the initial decimal digits and identify the repeating part.\n\nAfter obtaining the decimal representation, I'll observe the sequence of digits that repeats indefinitely.\n\nFinally, I'll count the number of digits in this repeating sequence to determine how many digits repeat.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111}\n   \\]\n   The denominator \\(11111\\) does not have any factors of 2 or 5, which means the decimal will repeat instead of terminating.\n\n2. **Long Division:**\n   Perform the long division of 31 by 11111.\n   - \\(11111 \\times 0 = 0\\), subtract from 31, so the first digit after the decimal is **2**.\n   - Bring down a **0**, making it **20**.\n   - \\(11111 \\times 0 = 0\\), subtract from 20, so the next digit is **0**.\n   - Bring down another **0**, making it **200**.\n   - \\(11111 \\times 1 = 11111\\), subtract from 200, so the next digit is **1**.\n   - Bring down another **0**, making it **10**.\n   - \\(11111 \\times 0 = 0\\), subtract from 10, so the next digit is **0**.\n   - This pattern continues, and we observe that **2** and **0** start to repeat.\n\n3. **Identify the Repeating Sequence:**\n   - The decimal begins to repeat after the initial **2**, **0**, **1**, so the repeating part is **201**.\n   \n4. **Count the Digits:**\n   - The repeating sequence is **3 digits** long.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"
