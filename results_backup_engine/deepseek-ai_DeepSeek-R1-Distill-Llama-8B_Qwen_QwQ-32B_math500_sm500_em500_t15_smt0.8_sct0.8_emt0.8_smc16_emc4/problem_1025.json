Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I remember that factoring polynomials often starts with looking for obvious roots or trying to factor by grouping. But this polynomial is an eighth-degree, so it might be tricky. Let me write it down: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). Hmm, it's a bit similar to a quadratic in terms of \\(x^4\\). Maybe I can make a substitution to make it look like a quadratic equation.\n\nLet me set \\(y = x^4\\). Then the equation becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\\). Oh, wait, but that's not a quadratic in y; actually, it is, because it's degree two. But solving this quadratic for y would give me \\(y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2}\\). So, \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = -4\\).\n\nSo, going back to \\(x^4\\), this gives me \\(x^4 = 1\\) or \\(x^4 = -4\\). Therefore, the roots of the original polynomial are the fourth roots of 1 and -4. The fourth roots of 1 are 1, -1, and the complex numbers \\(i\\) and \\(-i\\). The fourth roots of -4 would involve complex numbers as well, maybe something like \\(2i\\) and \\(-2i\\), but not sure yet.\n\nWait, but over the integers, factoring is about integer roots. So, perhaps there are no linear factors with integer roots here. Let me check if there are any integer roots by plugging in x=1 and x=-1.\n\nFor x=1: \\(1^8 + 3(1)^4 - 4 = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0\\). So, x=1 is a root. Similarly, for x=-1: \\((-1)^8 + 3(-1)^4 - 4 = 1 +"

Let me try to perform polynomial division to factor these out.\n\nFirst, let me divide the polynomial by (x - 1)(x +1) = x² -1. Let me see if that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe first factor out (x -1) and (x +1) step by step.\n\nLet me first divide by (x -1). Let's use synthetic division for x=1:\n\nThe coefficients of the polynomial \\(x^8 + 0x^7 + 0x^6 + 0x^5 + 3x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x -4\\).\n\nWait, that's a bit tedious. Let me write down the coefficients:\n\n1 (x^8), 0 (x^7), 0 (x^6), 0 (x^5), 3 (x^4), 0 (x^3), 0 (x^2), 0 (x), -4 (constant term).\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 1:\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply by 1: 1.

Perfect, so the remainder is zero, as expected.\n\nSo the result after dividing by (x -1) is:\n\nx^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 +4x^3 +4x^2 +4x +4.\n\nHmm, okay. Now let's try to divide this result by (x"

Let me denote this polynomial as Q(x) = x^6 +x^4 +4x^2 +4x +4.\n\nHmm, maybe it can be factored into quadratics or cubics or something else. Let me try to factor it.\n\nFirst, let's check for more integer roots. Let's try x=1 in Q(x): 1 +1 +4 +4 +4=14≠0. x=-1: 1 +1 +4 -4 +4=6≠0. So, no more linear factors with integer roots.\n\nSo perhaps it factors into quadratics or cubics. Let me try to look for quadratic factors.\n\nAssume that Q(x) factors as (x² + a x + b)(x⁴ + c x³ + d x² + e x + f). Since Q(x) is degree 6, and the leading term is 1, so we can try to multiply these and equate"
