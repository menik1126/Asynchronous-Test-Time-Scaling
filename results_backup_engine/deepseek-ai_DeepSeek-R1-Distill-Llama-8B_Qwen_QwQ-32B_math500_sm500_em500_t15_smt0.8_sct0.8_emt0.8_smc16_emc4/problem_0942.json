            "output": "To determine the number of trailing zeros in 42!, I need to understand the factors of 10 in the factorial. Since 10 is a product of 2 and 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of times 2 appears in the factors of 42!. This is done by dividing 42 by 2, then dividing the result by 2 again, and continuing this process until the quotient becomes zero. The total count from this calculation gives the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of times 5 appears in the factors of 42!. This is done similarly by dividing 42 by 5, then dividing the result by 5 again, and continuing this process until the quotient becomes zero. The total count from this calculation gives the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization.\n\nFinally, the number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the counts of 2s and 5s, as each pair of 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero in the factorial. Therefore, I'll take the smaller of the two counts obtained from the calculations for 2 and 5.\n\nBy performing these steps, I can accurately determine the number of trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\( 42! \\), we need to find how many times the factor 10 is present in the number. Since 10 is a product of 2 and 5, each pair of 2 and 5 contributes to one trailing zero. \n\n**Step 1: Count the number of 2s in the prime factors of \\( 42! \\)**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{42}{2} &= 21 \\\\\n\\frac{21}{2} &= 10.5 \\quad (\\text{rounded down to } 10) \\\\\n\\frac{10}{2} &= 5 \\\\\n\\frac{5}{2} &= 2.5 \\quad (\\text{rounded down to } 2) \\\\\n\\frac{2}{2} &= 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} &= 0.5 \\quad (\\text{rounded down to } 0) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAdding these: \\( 21 + 10"

So, there are **39** factors of 2 in \\( 42! \\).\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\( 42! \\)**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{42}{5} &= 8.4 \\quad (\\text{rounded down to } 8) \\\\\n\\frac{8}{5} &= 1.6 \\quad (\\text{rounded down to } 1) \\\\\n\\frac{1}{5} &= 0.2 \\quad (\\text{rounded down to } 0) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAdding these: \\( 8 + 1 = 9 \\). So, there are **9** factors of 5 in \\( 42! \\).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of trailing zeros**\n\nThe number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s.
