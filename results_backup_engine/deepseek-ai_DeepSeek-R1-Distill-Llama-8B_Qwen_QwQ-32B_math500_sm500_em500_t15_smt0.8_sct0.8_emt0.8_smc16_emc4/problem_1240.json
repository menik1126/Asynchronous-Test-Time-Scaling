First, I'll isolate the square root term by subtracting 4 from both sides, resulting in \\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\).\n\nNext, I'll square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. This gives me \\( (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x \\).\n\nExpanding the left side, I get \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\). Then, I'll bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\).\n\nI'll solve the quadratic equation by factoring it. The factors of 5 that add up to -6 are -1 and -5, so the equation becomes \\( (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 \\).\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives me the potential solutions: \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll check each solution in the original equation to ensure they are valid. Plugging in \\( x = 1 \\), the equation holds true. However, plugging in \\( x = 5 \\) results in a negative value under the square root, which is not possible. Therefore, the only valid solution is \\( x = 1 \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\) step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Isolate the Square Root**\n\nFirst, subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the square root term:\n\\[\nx - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Square Both Sides**\n\nSquare both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:\n\\[\n(x - 4)^2 = ( \\sqrt{11 - 2x} )^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Bring All Terms to One Side**\n\nSubtract \\( 11 \\) and add \\( 2x \\) to both sides to form a quadratic equation:\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + "
