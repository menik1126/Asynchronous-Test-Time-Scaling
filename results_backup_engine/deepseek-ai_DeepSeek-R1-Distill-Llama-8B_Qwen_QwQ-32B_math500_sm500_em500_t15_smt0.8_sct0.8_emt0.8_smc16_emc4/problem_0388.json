Substituting this value into the equation gives 45 = (3)²h, which simplifies to 45 = 9h.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for h by dividing both sides of the equation by 9, which gives h = 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, we'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters\n- Radius \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe height of the cylinder is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) centimeters."
