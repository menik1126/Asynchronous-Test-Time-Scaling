Denali is responsible for 16 dogs, and Nate is responsible for 12 dogs.\n\nUnder the new policy, both employees can be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of \\( x \\) dogs. The problem states two scenarios that result in the same ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay.\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali starts walking \\( 4x \\) more dogs, while Nate's number of dogs remains the same. In the second scenario, \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, and Denali's number of dogs is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWe'll set up equations based on these scenarios to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\nLet \\( r \\) represent the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay. Under the initial assignment, this ratio can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} = r\n\\]\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali walks \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs, and Nate continues with 12 dogs. The ratio remains \\( r \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = r = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\\\\nMultiply both sides by 12: \\\\\n16 + 4x = 16 \\\\\n4x = 0 \\\\\nx = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, \\( x \\) cannot be zero as per the problem's condition. This indicates that the first scenario alone doesn't provide a valid solution, so we need to consider the second scenario.\n\nIn the second scenario, \\( x \\) dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali. Denali's total becomes \\( 16 + x \\), and Nate's total becomes \\( 12 - x \\). The ratio remains \\( r \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nCross-multiplying to solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x) \\\\\n48 + 3x = 48 - 4x \\\\\n7x = 0 \\\\\nx = 0\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\( x = 0 \\)"

This suggests that both scenarios lead to \\( x = 0 \\), which contradicts the condition that \\( x \\neq 0 \\).\n\nGiven this inconsistency, it's possible that the ratio remains the same under both scenarios only when \\( x = 0 \\).
