            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find f(2015, 2). The function f is defined recursively, and it has some cases depending on the values of i and j. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f is defined for non-negative integers i and j, but j is specifically limited to 0 through 4 because of the mod_5 function. The recursive cases are:\n\n1. If i = 0 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 4, then f(0, j) = mod_5(j + 1). That seems straightforward. For example, f(0,0) would be mod_5(1) = 1, f(0,1) = mod_5(2) = 2, and so on up to f(0,4) = mod_5(5) = 0.\n\n2. If i ≥ 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1). So, whenever the second argument is 0, regardless of i, it reduces the i by 1 and sets j to 1.\n\n3. If i ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, then f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). That's a bit more complex. It looks like each time, we decrement j by 1 and recurse, but also decrement i by 1 in each recursive step until we reach j = 0, which then falls into case 2.\n\nGiven that, I need to compute f(2015, 2). That's a very large i, so perhaps there's a pattern or a cycle that repeats, which can be exploited to find f(2015,2) without computing all previous values.\n\nLet me start by computing small values of f(i, j) to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n- f(0,0) = mod_5(1) = 1\n- f(0,1) = mod_5(2) = 2\n- f(0,2) = mod_5(3) = 3\n- f(0,3) = mod_5(4) = 4\n- f(0,4) = mod_5(5) ="

Because sometimes with recursive functions, you might see a cycle or stabilization. So let's see:\n\nFrom the computations above, i=0 gives [1,2,3,4,0], i=1 gives [2,3,4,0,1], i=2 gives [3,0,2,4,1], i=3 gives [0,3,4,1,0], i=4 gives [3,1,3,1,3], i=5 gives [1,1,1,1,1], and i=6 gives [1,1,1,1,1], and presumably all higher i do too.\n\nSo from i=5 onwards, it's always 1s. Therefore, for i=2015, which is way larger than 5, f(2015, j)=1 for any j"
