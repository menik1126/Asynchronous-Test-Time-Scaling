There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and since the two letters must be different, the number of possible combinations is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, calculate the total number of possible combinations for the digit part of the license plate. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9), and since the two digits must be different, the number of possible combinations is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of unique license plates, multiply the number of combinations for the letters by the number of combinations for the digits. This will give the total number of possible license plates that can be formed.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many unique license plates can be formed under the given conditions.\n\n### **Problem Statement**\nWe need to calculate the number of possible license plates where:\n- The license plate consists of **2 different letters** (from A to Z, 26 letters in total).\n- This is followed by **2 different one-digit numbers** (from 0 to 9, 10 digits in total).\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Number of Possible Combinations for Letters**\n1. **Total letters available**: 26 (A to Z).\n2. **First letter**: Can be any of the 26 letters.\n3. **Second letter**: Must be different from the first letter, so there are \\(26 - 1 = 25\\) choices.\n\n**Total combinations for letters**:  \n\\(26 \\times 25\\)\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Number of Possible Combinations for Digits**\n1. **Total digits available**: 10 (0 to 9).\n2. **First digit**: Can be any of the 10 digits.\n3. **Second digit**: Must be different from the first digit, so there are \\(10 - 1 = 9\\) choices.\n\n**Total combinations for digits**:  \n\\(10 \\times 9\\)\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Unique License Plates**\nSince the letter combinations and digit combinations are independent of each other, we multiply the two results to get the total number of unique license plates.\n\n**Total license plates**:  \n\\( (26 \\times 25) \\times (10 \\times 9) \\)\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\\[\n26 \\times 25 = "
