            "output": "To determine the number of possible license plates, I'll start by analyzing the structure of the license plate. It consists of three parts: two different letters and two different digits.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the letters. There are 26 possible letters in the English alphabet, and since each license plate requires two different letters, I'll use permutations for this part. The number of ways to arrange two different letters out of 26 is calculated as 26P2, which equals 26 multiplied by 25, resulting in 650 possible combinations for the letters.\n\nNext, I'll address the digits. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9), and similar to the letters, each license plate must have two different digits. Using permutations again, the number of ways to arrange two different digits out of 10 is 10P2, which equals 10 multiplied by 9, giving 90 possible combinations for the digits.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of possible license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations. This means multiplying 650 by 90, which results in 58,500 possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:** How many license plates can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one-digit (0-9) numbers?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Letters Calculation:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.\n   - We need to choose **2 different letters**.\n   - The number of ways to choose and arrange 2 different letters from 26 is given by the combination formula for permutations:\n     \\[\n     P(26, 2) = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Digits Calculation:**\n   - There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9).\n   - We need to choose **2 different digits**.\n   - The number of ways to choose and arrange 2 different digits from 10 is given by the permutation formula:\n     \\[\n     P(10, 2) = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Total Number of License Plates:**\n   - To find the total number of possible license plates, multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations:\n    "
