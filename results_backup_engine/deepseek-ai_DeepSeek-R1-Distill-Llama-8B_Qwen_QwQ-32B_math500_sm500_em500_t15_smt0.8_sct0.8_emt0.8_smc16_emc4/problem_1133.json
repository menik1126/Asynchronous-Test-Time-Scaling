            "output": "To solve the problem, I need to determine the length of the hallway in meters using the given information.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the key details. The robot's speed remains constant, it takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer, and it takes 90 seconds to travel the length of the hallway.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the robot's speed. Since speed is distance divided by time, the speed is 1 kilometer divided by 2.5 hours. To make the units compatible, I'll convert 1 kilometer to 1000 meters and 2.5 hours to 1500 seconds. This gives the speed as 1000 meters per 1500 seconds, which simplifies to 2/3 meters per second.\n\nNow, I'll use the speed to find the hallway's length. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway. Using the formula speed multiplied by time equals distance, I'll multiply 2/3 meters per second by 90 seconds to get the length of the hallway.\n\nFinally, I'll perform the multiplication and round the result to the nearest meter, which is 60 meters.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Time taken by the robot to travel 1 kilometer at constant speed: **2.5 hours**\n- Time taken by the robot to travel the hallway: **90 seconds**\n\n**Find:**\n- Length of the hallway in meters.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Robot's Speed**\n\nThe speed (\\( V \\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n\\]\n\n- **Distance:** 1 kilometer = **1000 meters**\n- **Time:** 2.5 hours = **2.5 × 60 = 1500 seconds**\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{meters}}{1500 \\, \\text{seconds}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\, \\text{meters/second}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Length of the Hallway**\n\nUsing the calculated speed and the time taken to travel the hallway:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = V \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\n- **Speed (\\( V \\))**: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\, \\text{m/s} \\)\n"
