            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to combine these square roots and their reciprocals into a single fraction. The expression is √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3. Hmm, I remember from algebra that combining terms often involves finding a common denominator. But here, the terms are a mix of square roots and their reciprocals, which might complicate things. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should split the expression into two parts: one involving √2 and the other involving √3. That seems logical because they are separate radicals. So, the expression becomes (√2 + 1/√2) + (√3 + 1/√3). Now, I can handle each part separately and then combine the results.\n\nLet's tackle √2 + 1/√2 first. To combine these, I need a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and √2, so the common denominator would be √2. That means I can rewrite √2 as (√2 * √2)/√2, which simplifies to 2/√2. So, adding √2 and 1/√2 gives (2/√2) + (1/√2) = (2 + 1)/√2 = 3/√2. Hmm, but having a radical in the denominator isn't usually preferred, so maybe I should rationalize the denominator. Multiplying numerator and denominator by √2, I get (3√2)/2.\n\nAlright, so the first part simplifies to 3√2/2. Now, moving on to the second part: √3 + 1/√3. Using the same approach, I'll find a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and √3, so the common denominator is √3. Rewriting √3 as (√3 * √3)/√3 = 3/√3. Adding that to 1/√3 gives (3 + 1)/√3 = 4/√3. Again, rationalizing the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by √3, I get (4√3)/3.\n\nNow, putting both parts together, the original expression simplifies to (3√2)/2 + (4√3)/3. To combine these into a single fraction, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and "

            "output": "3, so the least common denominator (LCD) is 6. I can write each term with denominator 6.\n\nFor the first term, (3√2)/2, I multiply numerator and denominator by 3: (3√2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = (9√2)/6. For the second term, (4√3)/3, I multiply numerator and denominator by 2: (4√3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = (8√3)/6.\n\nNow, adding these two fractions together: (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Let me check if this can be simplified further. The numerator has terms with √2 and √3, which are different radicals, so they can't be combined. The denominator is 6, which is already in its simplest form since 2 and 3 are prime numbers and don't share any common factors with the numerator.\n\nTherefore, the expression in the desired form is (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Now, the problem asks for a, b, and c where a and b are coefficients of √2 and √3 respectively, and c is the denominator. So, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6.\n\nFinally, adding them together: a + b + c = 9 + 8 + 6. Let me do the math... 9 + 8 is 17, and 17 + 6 is 23. So, the sum is 23.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the common denominators or simplifying. Let me go back through each step.\n\nStarting with √2 + 1/√2: I converted √2 to 2/√2, added 1/√2 to get 3/√2, then rationalized to 3√2/2. That seems right.\n\nFor √3 + 1/√3: Same steps, converted to 3/√3 + 1/√3 = 4/√3, then rationalized to 4√3/3. That also looks correct.\n\nCombining both results: 3√2/2 + 4√3/3. Finding LCD of 6, adjusted fractions accordingly, ended up with (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Yes, that all adds up. So"
