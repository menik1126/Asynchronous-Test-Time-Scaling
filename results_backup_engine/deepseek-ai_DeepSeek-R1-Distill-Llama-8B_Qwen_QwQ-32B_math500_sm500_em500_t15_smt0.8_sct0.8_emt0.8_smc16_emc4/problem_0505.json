            "output": "I need to find out how many students take physics at the school. There are 360 students in total, and 15 of them don't take any of calculus, physics, or chemistry. So, 360 - 15 = 345 students take at least one of these subjects.\n\nNext, 15 students take all three subjects: calculus, physics, and chemistry. Let's denote the number of students who take only calculus as C_only, only physics as P_only, and only chemistry as Ch_only.\n\nThe problem states that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics, so Ch = 2 * P.\n\nIt also mentions that 75 students take both physics and chemistry, and 75 take both calculus and chemistry, but only 30 take both physics and calculus. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, the total number of students taking at least one subject is C + P + Ch - C_P - C_Ch - P_Ch + C_P_Ch = 345.\n\nI'll start by expressing C_only, C_P, and C_Ch in terms of C, P, and Ch. Then, substitute the relationships into the inclusion-exclusion equation to find the number of students taking physics.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n### **Given Data:**\n- Total students in the school: 360\n- Students who don't take any of Calculus, Physics, or Chemistry: 15\n- Students who take all three subjects (Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry): 15\n- Students who take only Calculus: \\( C_{\\text{only}} \\)\n- Students who take only Physics: \\( P_{\\text{only}} \\)\n- Students who take only Chemistry: \\( C_{\\text{h}}_{\\text{only}} \\)\n- Students who take both Calculus and Physics: \\( C \\cap P = 30 \\)\n- Students who take both Calculus and Chemistry: \\( C \\cap Ch = 75 \\)\n- Students who take both Physics and Chemistry: \\( P \\cap Ch = 75 \\)\n- Students who take both Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry: \\( C \\cap P \\cap Ch = 15 \\)\n- Students who don't take any two subjects: \\( C_{\\text{only}} + P_{\\text{only}} + C_{\\text{h}}_{\\text{only}} = 15 \\)\n- Total"
