            "output": "To determine the total number of possible license plates, I need to consider the composition of the license plate structure.\n\nFirst, the license plate requires two different letters. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, the number of possible combinations for the first letter is 26. For the second letter, since it must be different from the first, there are 25 remaining options.\n\nNext, following the two letters, there are two different one-digit numbers. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9). Therefore, for the first number, there are 10 options, and for the second number, there are 9 remaining options because it must be different from the first digit.\n\nTo find the total number of license plates, I multiply the number of options for each part of the license plate. This means multiplying the combinations for the letters by the combinations for the numbers.\n\nSo, the total number of possible license plates is 26 multiplied by 25 for the letters, and 10 multiplied by 9 for the numbers. Multiplying these together gives the final total.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of possible license plates, we analyze the composition of each part of the license plate:\n\n1. **Letters:**\n   - Each license plate requires **2 different letters** from the English alphabet (A-Z).\n   - There are **26 letters** in total.\n   - For the first letter, there are **26 possible choices**.\n   - For the second letter, since it must be different from the first, there are **25 remaining choices**.\n   - **Total combinations for letters:** \\(26 \\times 25 = 650\\)\n\n2. **Numbers:**\n   - Each license plate also requires **2 different single-digit numbers** (0-9).\n   - There are **10 possible digits** for each number.\n   - For the first number, there are **10 possible choices**.\n   - For the second number, since it must be different from the first, there are **9 remaining choices**.\n   - **Total combinations for numbers:** \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\)\n\n3. **Total License Plates:**\n   - To find the total number of possible license plates, we multiply the combinations for letters and numbers.\n   - **Total license plates:** \\(650 \\times 90 = 58,500\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\(\\boxed{58,500}\\)"
