These are the prime factors.\n\nNext, I'll form the integers by combining these prime factors in such a way that their sum is minimized. To achieve the smallest sum, I should use the smallest possible integers.\n\nConsidering the prime factors, the optimal grouping would be 2, 3, and 7. Combining them as 2, 3, and 7 gives a sum of 12.\n\nI'll verify that this grouping meets the requirements: all integers are distinct, positive, and their product is 84. The product is 2 × 3 × 7 = 84, which satisfies the condition.\n</think>\n\nLet's find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84.\n\n**Step 1: Factor 84 into Prime Factors**\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\nThe prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\n**Step 2: Form Distinct Integers**\nTo minimize the sum, we should use the smallest possible integers. The prime factors are already the smallest possible.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Sum**\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 7 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
