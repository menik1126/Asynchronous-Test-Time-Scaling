The problem says that the solutions are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of this polygon. They also mention that the area can be expressed in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( p \\) is prime, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime, and then I need to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I remember that the solutions to a polynomial equation in the complex plane correspond to points (complex numbers) that form the vertices of a polygon. Since it's a 4th-degree polynomial, there should be four solutions, which would form a quadrilateral, probably a convex one.\n\nThe equation is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial. Let me write it again:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \\)\n\nLooking at the coefficients, I notice that they have some relation to powers of \\( i \\). Maybe I can factor this equation or perform some substitution to make it simpler.\n\nI remember that sometimes for polynomials with complex coefficients, substitutions like \\( w = z + c \\) or \\( w = iz \\) can help. Let me check if this equation can be transformed by such a substitution.\n\nAlso, looking at the structure of the equation, I see that the coefficients follow a pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. It seems a bit similar to the expansion of a binomial, but with some modifications.\n\nWait a second, this resembles the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\), but let me check:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6 z^2 + 4i z + i^2 \\)\nBut in our equation, the coefficients are different. Let me compute that:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6 z^2 + 4i z + (-1) \\) because \\( i^2 = -1 \\).\n\nSo comparing this to our given equation:\n\nGiven: \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2"

Therefore, the side length s = 2^{3/4}\n\nThus, the area of the square is s² = (2^{3/4})² = 2^{3/2}\n\nHmm, same result as before. So, the area of the polygon (which is a square) is 2^{3/2}, which is \\( \\sqrt{8} \\) or \\( 2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the area was 2*(√2). Wait, 2^{3/2} is equal to 2√2, which is approximately 2.828.\n\nTherefore, the area of the polygon is 2√2.\n\nBut the problem says the area can be expressed as \\( p^{a/b} \\), where p is prime, and a and b are coprime. 2 is prime, and √2 is 2^{1/2}, so 2√2 = 2 * 2^{1/2} = 2^{3/2}.\n\nSo, expressed as p^{a/b}, it's 2^{3/2}, so p=2, a=3, b=2. Then a and b are coprime, yes. So, a=3, b=2, p=2.\n\nThus, a + b + p =3 + 2 +2=7.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, area is 2^{3/2}. So exponent is 3/2, so a=3, b=2, and p=2. 2 is prime.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, a + b + p =3 + 2 +2=7.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any wrong step.\n\nWe started by shifting z to w = z +i.\n\nThe equation becomes w^4 = -1 +i, right?\n\nWait, when I substituted z =w -i, then z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i=0 becomes w^4 +4i (other terms) -6 (other terms) etc. ended up with w^4 = i -1.

So when I substituted, I ended up with w^4 + (1 -i) =0, so w^4 = - (1 -i) = -1 +i. So, yes, w^4 = ( -1 +i ). So the modulus squared of that is (sqrt( (-1)^2 +1^2 ))=sqrt(2). Wait, modulus of -1 +i is sqrt( (-1)^2 +1^2 )=sqrt(2). So modulus of w^4 is sqrt(2), so modulus of w is (sqrt(2))^{1/4}=2^{1/4}, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the modulus of each w is 2^{1/4}, so the radius of the circle is 2^{1/4}. Then, the square inscribed in that circle has area 2*(2^{1/4})^2 = 2*(2^{1/2}) = 2^{3/2}, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^{3/2}, so the answer is 3 +2 +2=7.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says the solutions are the vertices of a convex polygon. Since we shifted the points by subtracting i, does that affect the area? Wait, translation does not change the area. So the area of the polygon formed by the z's is the same as the area formed by the w's, which is 2^{3/2}. So the answer is 7.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Let me compute the coordinates of the z points and see if the area is indeed 2^{3/2}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the area of the square formed by the w points is 2^{3/2}.
