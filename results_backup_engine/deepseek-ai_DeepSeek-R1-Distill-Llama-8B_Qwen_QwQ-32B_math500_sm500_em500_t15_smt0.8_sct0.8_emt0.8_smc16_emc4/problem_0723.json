            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of x. The problem gives me two logarithmic equations:\n\n1. log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2.\n2. log base y of 5x equals 2.\n\nAlright, let me take this step by step. First, I'll look at the first equation because it seems a bit simpler, dealing with logs of similar terms. The second equation involves a different base, so I might need to handle that separately once I figure out y or something else.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2.\n\nI remember that one of the logarithm properties is that the sum of two logs with the same base is the log of the product. So, I can rewrite this as:\n\nlog₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nSimplifying inside the log, (x - y)(x + y) is x² - y². So now, the equation becomes:\n\nlog₆(x² - y²) = 2.\n\nTo get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that here:\n\n6² = x² - y².\n\nCalculating 6 squared, that's 36. So now I have:\n\n36 = x² - y².  Let's label this as equation (1) for reference.\n\nOkay, now moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2.\n\nAgain, I can rewrite this logarithmic equation in exponential form. log_y(5x) = 2 means that y² = 5x. Let me note that down:\n\ny² = 5x.  Let's call this equation (2).\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1. 36 = x² - y²\n2. y² = 5x\n\nHmm, since equation (2) gives y² in terms of x, maybe I can substitute that into equation (1) to eliminate y².\n\nSubstituting y² from equation (2) into equation (1):\n\n36 = x² - (5x).\n\nSo, 36 = x² -5x.\n\nLet me rearrange this"

            "output": " into a standard quadratic equation form:\n\nx² -5x -36 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for x. Let me try factoring. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, possible factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nLet me see:  Let's think about  -9 and 4. Because (-9) * 4 = -36 and (-9) +4 = -5. Perfect!\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as:\n\n(x - 9)(x + 4) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 9 = 0 => x = 9\n\nx + 4 = 0 => x = -4\n\nNow, I need to check if both solutions are valid in the original equations because sometimes logarithms can have domain issues.\n\nFirst, x = 9.\n\nFrom equation (2): y² = 5*9 = 45. So y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But since y is inside a logarithm in the first equation, it must be positive. So y = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, let's check the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2.\n\nCompute x - y = 9 - 3√5. Since 3√5 is approximately 6.708, 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292, which is positive. Similarly, x + y = 9 + 3√5 ≈ 15.708, which is positive. So both arguments of log are positive, which is good because log is defined only for positive numbers.\n\nNow, check if the sum of the logs equals 2. Earlier, we already transformed that, so let's calculate x² - y² to see if it's 36.\n\nx² = 81, y² = 45. So 81 - 45 = 36, which matches equation (1). So x =9 is valid.\n\nNow, check x = -4.\n\nFrom equation (2): y² = 5*(-4) = -20. Wait, y² equals a negative number? That can't be"

So x = -4 is rejected.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. First equation: transformed to x² - y² =36.\n\n2. Second equation: transformed to y² =5x.\n\n3. Substituted y² into first equation to get quadratic in x: x² -5x -36=0.\n\n4. Factoring quadratic, found x=9 and x=-4.\n\n5.
