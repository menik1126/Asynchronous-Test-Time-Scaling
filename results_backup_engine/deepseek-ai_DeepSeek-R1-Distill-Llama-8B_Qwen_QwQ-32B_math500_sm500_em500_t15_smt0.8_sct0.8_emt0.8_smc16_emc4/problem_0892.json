            "output": "First, I need to convert the fraction 57/160 into a decimal. To do this, I'll divide 57 by 160.\n\nI'll set up the division: 57 ÷ 160. Since 57 is less than 160, the result will be less than 1. I'll add a decimal point and some zeros to 57 to make it divisible by 160.\n\nAfter adding zeros, the division becomes 57.000... ÷ 160. I'll perform the division step by step, keeping track of the decimal places.\n\nAs I divide, I'll record each step and write down the quotient. After completing the division, I'll have the decimal equivalent of 57/160.\n\nThe final decimal will terminate because the denominator 160 is a power of 10 (10^2 * 2, which is 10^3 when including the 2). This means the decimal will have a finite number of places.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Fractions and Decimal Conversion:**\n   - A fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will have a terminating decimal if and only if the prime factors of the denominator \\(b\\) consist solely of 2s and/or 5s after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n2. **Check the Denominator:**\n   - Here, the denominator is 160.\n   - Factorize 160:\n     \\[\n     160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n     \\]\n   - Since 160 has only 2s and 5s as prime factors, \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) is already in its simplest form and will convert to a terminating decimal.\n\n3. **Perform Decimal Division:**\n   - Divide 57 by 160.\n     \\[\n     57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\n     \\]\n   - **Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n     - \\(160\\) goes into \\(57.0\\) zero times. Add a decimal point and continue with \\(570\\).\n     - \\(160\\) goes into \\(570\\) three times (since \\(160 \\times 3 = 480\\)), subtract 480 from 570 to get 90.\n     - Bring down the next 0 to make it 900"
