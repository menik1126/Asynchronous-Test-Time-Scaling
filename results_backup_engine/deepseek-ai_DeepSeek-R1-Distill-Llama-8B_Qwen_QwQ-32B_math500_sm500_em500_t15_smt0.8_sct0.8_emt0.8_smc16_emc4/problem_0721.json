            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I need to find the value of x. The problem gives me two logarithmic equations:\n\n1. log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2.\n2. log base y of (5x) equals 2.\n\nHmm, let me write these down to visualize them better.\n\nFirst equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2.\n\nSecond equation: log_y(5x) = 2.\n\nAlright, so I have two equations with two variables: x and y. I need to solve for x. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nStarting with the first equation. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying the arguments. So, log₆(A) + log₆(B) = log₆(A * B). Let me apply that here.\n\nSo, log₆((x - y)(x + y)) = 2.\n\nWait, that simplifies to log₆ of (x² - y²) = 2. Because (x - y)(x + y) is x squared minus y squared.\n\nOkay, so log₆(x² - y²) = 2.\n\nI know that if log_b(C) = D, then C = b^D. So, applying that here, x² - y² = 6², which is 36.\n\nSo, equation one simplifies to x² - y² = 36. Let me write that down.\n\nEquation 1a: x² - y² = 36.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2.\n\nAgain, if log_y(A) = B, then A = y^B. So, 5x = y².\n\nSo, equation 2a: 5x = y².\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. x² - y² = 36.\n2. 5x = y².\n\nI can substitute equation 2a into equation 1a. Let me replace y² with 5x in equation 1a.\n\nSo, x² - 5x = 36.\n\nThat's a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let me rearrange it to standard form.\n\nx²"

            "output": " - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let me try to factor this quadratic.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5.\n\nWait, factors of 36: 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nLooking for two numbers whose product is -36 and sum is -5.\n\nHmm, let's see: 3 and -12 would give 3*(-12) = -36, and 3 + (-12) = -9, not -5.\n\nWait, maybe 4 and -9: 4*(-9) = -36, and 4 + (-9) = -5. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0.\n\nSo, setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx + 4 = 0 → x = -4.\n\nx - 9 = 0 → x = 9.\n\nNow, I need to check if these solutions are valid in the original equations, because sometimes when dealing with logarithms, we might have domain issues.\n\nFirst, let's consider x = -4.\n\nFrom equation 2a: 5x = y².\n\nIf x = -4, then y² = 5*(-4) = -20.\n\nBut y² can't be negative because any real number squared is non-negative. So, y² = -20 is impossible. Hence, x = -4 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is x = 9.\n\nLet me verify this in equation 2a: 5x = 5*9 = 45. So, y² = 45, which means y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). That's fine because y can be positive or negative as long as it's a real number.\n\nNow, check equation 1a: x² - y² = 36.\n\nIf x = 9, then x² = 81.\n\nAnd y² = 45, as found earlier.\n\nSo, 81 - 45 = 36, which matches the equation.\n\nTherefore, x = 9 is valid.\n\nSo, the value of x is 9.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we simplify the first equation by combining the logarithms"
