Brazil was priced at 6 cents each, France at 5 cents each, Peru at 4 cents each, and Spain at 7 cents each.\n\nNext, determine the number of stamps for each country in the 1970s. Assuming an equal distribution, there are 2 stamps from each country during that decade.\n\nFinally, calculate the total cost for all 1970s stamps by multiplying each country's price by the number of stamps and summing the results.

The problem says \"average price of his 70s stamps\". The Asymptote code labels the decades as 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. The 70s column has numbers: 12 (Brazil), 12 (France), 6 (Peru), 13 (Spain). Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The user's question says \"the prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, 6 cents each, Peru 4 cents each, and Spain 5 cents each.\" Wait, hold on, the problem says Brazil and France are 6 cents each, Peru is 4, Spain is 5. So Spain is 5, not 7. Also, the numbers in the 70s column are 12 (Brazil), 12 (France), 6 (Peru), 13 (Spain). So the number of stamps for each country in the 70s are Brazil:12, France:12, Peru:6, Spain:13. \n\nSo my previous steps were wrong. Let me redo this properly.\n\n### Corrected Step 1: Prices per Country\n- Brazil: 6 cents\n- France: 6 cents\n- Peru: 4 cents\n- Spain: 5 cents\n\n### Corrected Step 2: Number of Stamps in 70s\nFrom the Asymptote diagram's 70s column (third column from left, labeled \"70s\"):\n- Brazil (row 3.5): 12 stamps\n- France (row 2.5): 12 stamps\n- Peru (row 1.5): 6 stamps\n- Spain (row 0.5): 13 stamps\n\n### Corrected Step 3: Total Cost Calculation\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Brazil:} & \\quad 12 \\times 6 = 72 \\text{ cents} \\\\\n\\text{France:} & \\quad 12 \\times 6 = 72 \\text"
