            "output": "First, I recognize that the given series is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2, starting from 1 and ending at 199.\n\nTo find the modulo 7 remainder of the sum, I'll first determine how many terms are in this sequence. Since the last term is 199, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find the number of terms: (-1 + 199) / 2 = 99.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total sum of the series. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: (number of terms) × (first term + last term) / 2. Plugging in the values: 99 × (1 + 199) / 2 = 99 × 200 / 2 = 99 × 100 = 9900.\n\nFinally, to find the modulo 7 remainder of 9900, I'll divide 9900 by 7 and find the remainder. Performing the division gives 9900 ÷ 7 = 1414 with a remainder of 2.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 197 + 199\\) is divided by \\(7\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Series Type\nThe given series is an **arithmetic sequence** where:\n- **First term (\\(a\\))**: 1\n- **Common difference (\\(d\\))**: 2\n- **Last term (\\(l\\))**: 199\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Terms\nThe formula to find the number of terms (\\(n\\)) in an arithmetic sequence is:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{199 - 1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{198}{2} + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Series\nThe sum (\\(S\\)) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{100}{2} \\times (1"
