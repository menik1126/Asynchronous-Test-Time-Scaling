Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the domain of a square root function is where the expression inside the square root is non-negative. So, for g(x) to be real, the radicand (the expression under the square root) must be greater than or equal to zero. That means I need to solve the inequality:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0.\n\nAlright, let me simplify this expression step by step. Maybe if I expand both squares, it will become easier to handle.\n\nStarting with (x - 3)^2, expanding that gives me x^2 - 6x + 9. Then, (x - 8)^2 expands to x^2 - 16x + 64. So now, subtracting the two expressions:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) ≥ 0.\n\nLet me distribute the negative sign to each term in the second parenthesis:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 ≥ 0.\n\nHmm, looks like the x^2 terms will cancel out. Let me verify:\n\nx^2 - x^2 is 0, so those cancel. Then, -6x + 16x is 10x. And 9 - 64 is -55. So, putting it all together:\n\n10x - 55 ≥ 0.\n\nThat simplifies to 10x ≥ 55. Dividing both sides by 10 gives:\n\nx ≥ 55/10, which is x ≥ 5.5.\n\nWait, so x has to be greater than or equal to 5.5 for the expression inside the square root to be non-negative. So, the domain of g(x) is [5.5, ∞). \n\nBut the question is asking for the smallest real number x in the domain. Well, since the domain starts at 5.5, the smallest x would be 5.5. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the expansion:\n\n(x"

So, 10x - 55 ≥ 0 → x ≥ 5.5.\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So the smallest x is 5.5, which can also be written as 11/2. But since the question asks for the smallest real number, 5.5 is already in its simplest form. \n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can test x = 5.5 in the original expression to ensure it's non-negative.\n\nCalculating (5.5 - 3)^2 - (5.5 - 8)^2.\n\nFirst, (5.5 - 3) is 2.5, squared is 6.25.\n\nThen, (5.5 - 8) is -2.5, squared is also 6.25.\n\nSo, 6.25 - 6.25 = 0. So, the expression inside the sqrt is zero, which is allowed because sqrt(0) is defined. Thus, x = 5.5 is indeed in the domain, and it's the smallest such x.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2} \\), we need to ensure the expression inside the square root is non-negative. \n\n1. Start by setting the radicand greater than or equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \\geq 0\n   \\]\n\n2.
