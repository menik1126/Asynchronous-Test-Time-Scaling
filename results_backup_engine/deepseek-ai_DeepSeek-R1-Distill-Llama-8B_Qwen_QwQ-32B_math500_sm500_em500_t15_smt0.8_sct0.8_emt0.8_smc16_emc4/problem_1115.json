            "output": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says that the value of y varies inversely as the square root of x. Hmm, inverse variation, right? I remember that inverse variation means that as one thing increases, the other decreases in such a way that their product is a constant. \n\nLet me write down what I know. The problem states that y varies inversely as the square root of x. So in mathematical terms, that should be something like y = k divided by sqrt(x), where k is the constant of variation. Yeah, that sounds right. So the general formula for inverse variation is y = k * (something)^(-1). In this case, the something is sqrt(x), so it becomes y = k / sqrt(x).\n\nAlright, the problem gives me a specific case where when x is 24, y is 15. So I can use this information to find the constant k. Let me plug those values into the equation. \n\nSo when x = 24, y = 15. That means 15 = k / sqrt(24). I need to solve for k here. To do that, I can multiply both sides of the equation by sqrt(24). So k = 15 * sqrt(24).\n\nBut wait, sqrt(24) can probably be simplified. Let me think, 24 is 4 times 6, so sqrt(24) is sqrt(4*6) which is sqrt(4)*sqrt(6) = 2*sqrt(6). So substituting that back in, k = 15 * 2 * sqrt(6). That would be 30*sqrt(6). Okay, so the constant k is 30 times the square root of 6.\n\nNow that I have k, I can write the full equation. So y = 30*sqrt(6) / sqrt(x). Got that. \n\nThe question is asking for the value of x when y is 3. So I need to plug y = 3 into this equation and solve for x. Let me do that step by step.\n\nStarting with 3 = 30*sqrt(6) / sqrt(x). To solve for sqrt(x), I can multiply both sides by sqrt(x). That gives me 3*sqrt(x) = 30*sqrt(6).\n\nThen, I can isolate sqrt(x) by dividing both sides by 3. So sqrt(x) = (30*sqrt"

            "output": "(6)) / 3. Simplifying that, 30 divided by 3 is 10. So sqrt(x) = 10*sqrt(6).\n\nNow, to find x, I need to square both sides of the equation. So (sqrt(x))^2 = (10*sqrt(6))^2. The left side becomes x, and the right side is (10)^2 * (sqrt(6))^2. 10 squared is 100, and sqrt(6) squared is 6. So 100*6 is 600. Therefore, x equals 600.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, inverse variation: y = k / sqrt(x). Given x=24, y=15, so 15 = k / sqrt(24). Calculated sqrt(24) as 2*sqrt(6), so k is 15*2*sqrt(6) = 30*sqrt(6). Then, when y=3, plug in: 3 = 30*sqrt(6)/sqrt(x). Multiply both sides by sqrt(x): 3*sqrt(x) = 30*sqrt(6). Divide by 3: sqrt(x) = 10*sqrt(6). Square both sides: x = 100*6 = 600. \n\nLooks good. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe value of \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), which can be written as \\( y = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}} \\). Given \\( x = 24 \\) and \\( y = 15 \\), we find the constant \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n15 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{24}} \\implies k = 15 \\times \\sqrt{24} = 15 \\times 2\\sqrt{6} = 30\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation becomes \\( y = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}} \\). When \\( y = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}} \\implies 3\\sqrt{x} = 30\\sqrt{6} \\implies \\sqrt{x} = 10\\sqrt{6} \\implies x = (10\\sqrt{6})^2 = 600\n\\]\n\n"
