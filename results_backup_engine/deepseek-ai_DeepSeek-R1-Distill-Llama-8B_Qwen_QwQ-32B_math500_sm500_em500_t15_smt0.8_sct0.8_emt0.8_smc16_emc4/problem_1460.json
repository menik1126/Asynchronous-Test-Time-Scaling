A is directly north of O, B is directly west of O, C is directly south of O, and D is directly east of O. The distance between C and D is 140 meters. There's a hot-air balloon at point H, which is directly above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. The lengths of HC and HD are given as 150 meters and 130 meters, respectively.\n\nThe problem says that to reduce the total length of rope used, we can replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. The balloon remains at the same position H above O. We need to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the setup. Points A, B, C, D are on the compass directions from O: A is north, B is west, C is south, and D is east. H is directly above O, so it's somewhere along the vertical line passing through O. The ropes HA, HB, HC, HD connect H to each of these points, forming a sort of star shape around H.\n\nThe original total length of ropes HC and HD is 150 + 130 = 280 meters. If we replace these two ropes with a single rope HP, the new length will be the distance from H to P, where P lies somewhere on the straight line between C and D. The goal is to find the point P such that HP is as long as possible, which would minimize the reduction in rope length. Wait, actually, if we replace two ropes with one, the saving would be (HC + HD) - HP. So to maximize the saving, we need to minimize HP, right? Wait, no, because we want to save as much as possible, which means making HP as short as possible, thus the saving would be larger. But wait, the problem says \"greatest length of rope that can be saved,\" which would be (HC + HD) - HP. So to maximize the saving, we need to minimize HP. But actually, if HP can be shorter, the saving is more. So, actually, the maximum saving occurs when HP is as short as possible. But perhaps that's"

So the amount saved is 280 - HP. Therefore, to get the greatest saving, we need HP to be as small as possible. Therefore, we need to find the minimal possible HP where P is on CD. But is there any constraint? Since H is fixed above O, and P is on CD. Wait, but the balloon must be supported by the ropes, so is there some constraint on the rope lengths? Wait, the problem says \"to reduce the total length of rope used, rope HC and HD are to be replaced by a single rope HP\". I think the problem assumes that replacing the two ropes with a single rope is possible, so as long as the balloon can be held in place by the remaining ropes (HA and HB) along with HP. Wait, but actually, maybe not. Wait, originally, there were four ropes: HA, HB, HC, HD. Now replacing HC and HD with HP, so the new system has HA, HB, HP. So maybe we need to make sure that H is still held in place? But the problem states \"the balloon remains at the same position H above O as described above,\" so the position is fixed, so the new rope HP is just part of the system now. The problem is just about saving the rope length, so the ropes HA and HB are still there. Therefore, the problem is purely about replacing HC and HD with HP, so we just need to choose P on CD such that HP is as small as possible. Therefore, the saving is 280 - HP. So to get the greatest saving, minimize HP. So the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible HP where P is on CD. Therefore, perhaps the minimal HP is the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD? Hmm, that might be the case.\n\nBut first, let me get the coordinates straight. Let me set up a coordinate system where point O is at the origin (0,0). Since A is north, B is west, C is south, D is east. Let's assume the field is a plane with O as the origin, so:\n\n- Let's set up the coordinate system such that O is (0,0).\n- A is"

Wait, but A is at (0,a), so perhaps H is at (0, h), where h > a.\n\nWait, but the Asy code given in the problem has a coordinate system where O is at (0,0), A is at (1,1), D is at (1.5, -0.3), B is at (-1.5, 0.3), C is at (-1, -1), and H is at (0, 2.5).

H is at (0, 2.5), which is directly above O.\n\nBut the actual problem says that the distance between C and D is 140 meters, so we can compute the distance between C and D. From the Asy code, C is at (-1, -1) and D is at (1.5, -0.3). The distance between them would be sqrt[(1.5 - (-1))^2 + (-0.3 - (-1))^2] = sqrt[(2.5)^2 + (0.7)^2] = sqrt[6.25 + 0.49] = sqrt[6.74] ≈ 2.6, which is way less than 140. But in the actual problem, the distance between C and D is 140 m, so maybe the coordinate system is scaled.\n\nSo, perhaps to make the problem consistent, we should model this with O at ("

Let me think.\n\nSo, the point P is somewhere on the line CD, which is from C(0, -84) to D(112, 0). The point H is at (0,66). We need to find the point P on CD such that the distance from H to P is minimized.\n\nWait, but in 3D, if H is above O, and P is on CD, then HP is a straight line in 3D. However, since all points are on a flat field (ground), H is at (0,0,66) if we consider the field as the xy-plane. So, the distance HP would be the distance in 3D space between (0,0,66) and any point P on CD. But since CD is on the ground, the z-coordinate of P is zero.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the problem in 2D, then H is at (0,66), but in 2D, the distance from H to P would be the same as in 3D because we can ignore the vertical component? Wait, no. No, in 3D, HP would be the straight line from (0,0,66) to (x, y, 0), which is sqrt(x² + y² + 66²). However, if we're only concerned with the ground distance, then perhaps it's sqrt(x² + y²). Wait, but the problem says \"a single rope HP where P is a point on the straight line between C and D\". So since H is above O, the rope HP would connect H(0,0,66) to P(x, y, 0), which is on CD. So the distance would be sqrt(x² + y² + 66²).

Let me use a linear approximation.\n\nLet’s consider that between t=94.1 and t=94.2, f(t)=t² goes from 8854.81 to 8873.64. The target is 8871.84.\n\nSo, delta t=0.1 corresponds to delta f=8873.64 -8854.81=18.83.\n\nWe need to find t such that t²=8871.84.\n\nThe difference from 94.1² is 8871.84 -8854.81=17.03.\n\nSo, the fraction is 17.03/18.83≈0.906.\n\nTherefore, t≈94.1 + 0.906*0.1≈94.1 +0.0906≈94.1906.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(8871.84)≈94.1906≈94.19 m.\n\nSo, HP≈94.19 m.\n\nWait, but is this correct? The minimal HP is approximately 94.19 m, which is much shorter than the original HC + HD = 280 m. So, the amount saved would be 280 - 94.19≈185.81 m. So, this would be the maximum rope saved.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm whether this is indeed the minimal distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have just considered the 3D perpendicular distance from H to line CD. Wait, in 3D, the minimal distance from a point to a line can be found by the formula:\n\nDistance = |(P - Q) × direction| / |direction|,\n\nwhere P is the point, Q is a point on the line, and direction is the direction vector of the line.\n\nIn our case, point H is at (0,0,66).
