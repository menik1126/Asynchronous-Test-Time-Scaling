            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of (5 divided by sqrt(80) plus sqrt(845)/9 plus sqrt(45), all of that divided by sqrt(5)). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression to make sure I have it right:\n\n√[(5/√80 + √845/9 + √45) / √5]\n\nAlright, so the main goal is to simplify the entire fraction inside the square root. Maybe I should simplify each term inside the numerator first before dealing with the denominator and then the square root.\n\nLet's look at each term in the numerator: 5/√80, √845/9, and √45.\n\nStarting with 5/√80. I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually preferred, so I should rationalize that. To do that, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by √80 to get rid of the square root in the denominator.\n\nSo, 5/√80 * √80/√80 = (5√80)/80.\n\nNow, let's simplify √80. Breaking it down, 80 is 16*5, and 16 is a perfect square. So √80 = √(16*5) = √16 * √5 = 4√5.\n\nSubstituting that back, we have (5*4√5)/80 = (20√5)/80. Simplifying 20/80 gives 1/4, so it's (1√5)/4, which is √5/4.\n\nAlright, so 5/√80 simplifies to √5/4.\n\nNext term: √845/9. Let me try to simplify √845. Hmm, 845, let's see. Is it divisible by any squares? Let's factor it:\n\n845 ÷ 5 = 169. Oh, 169 is 13 squared, so 845 = 5 * 13². Therefore, √845 = √(5 * 13²) = √(13²) * √5 = 13√5.\n\nSo, √845/9 is (13√5)/9.\n\nOkay, that one is simplified as (13√5)/9.\n\nThird term: √45. Let me simplify that. 45 is 9*5, so √"

            "output": "45 = √(9*5) = √9 * √5 = 3√5.\n\nSo, now the numerator has three terms: √5/4, (13√5)/9, and 3√5.\n\nNow, let's write them all out:\n\n√5/4 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5.\n\nI notice that all terms have √5, so I can factor that out, which might make adding them easier.\n\nFactoring out √5, we get:\n\n√5 (1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nWait, 3 is the same as 3/1, so I need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) would be 36.\n\nSo, let's convert each fraction to have 36 as the denominator.\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\n3/1 = 108/36.\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169.\n\nSo, 1/4 + 13/9 + 3 = 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator simplifies to √5 * 169/36 = (169√5)/36.\n\nNow, the entire expression inside the square root is this numerator divided by √5:\n\n[(169√5)/36] / √5.\n\nWhen I divide by √5, it's the same as multiplying by 1/√5:\n\n(169√5)/36 * 1/√5.\n\nThe √5 in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out, leaving:\n\n169/36.\n\nSo now, I have √(169/36). Let me compute that.\n\n√(169/36) is equal to √169 divided by √36.\n\n√169 is 13, and √36 is 6.\n\nSo, √(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything because that seems straightforward, but I want to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again, the initial expression is the square root of (5/√80 + √845/9 + √45) divided by √5.\n\nI simplified each term:\n\n5/√80 became √5/4,\n\n√845 became 13√5, so over 9 is (13√5)/"
