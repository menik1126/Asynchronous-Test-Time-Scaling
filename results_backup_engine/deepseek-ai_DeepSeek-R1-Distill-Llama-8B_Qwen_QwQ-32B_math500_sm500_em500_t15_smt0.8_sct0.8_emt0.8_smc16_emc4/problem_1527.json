The problem gives me three sums: the sum of the first n terms is 96, the sum of their squares is 144, and the sum of their cubes is 216. I need to find the sum of all possible values of n. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n- \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n- \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nI need to find all possible values of n and sum them up. \n\nI remember that in problems involving sums of powers, sometimes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities come into play. Also, for sequences where each term is the same, like all a_i equal, those might be the simplest cases. Maybe I should check if all a_i are equal. If they are, then we can use that to find n.\n\nSo, let's assume all a_i are equal, say a_i = a for all i. Then:\n\nSum: \\( n \\cdot a = 96 \\) → \\( a = 96/n \\)\n\nSum of squares: \\( n \\cdot a^2 = 144 \\) → \\( a^2 = 144/n \\)\n\nSum of cubes: \\( n \\cdot a^3 = 216 \\) → \\( a^3 = 216/n \\)\n\nSo, let's see if these are consistent. From the first equation, a = 96/n. Let's plug this into the second equation:\n\n\\( (96/n)^2 = 144/n \\)\n\nSo, \\( 9216/n² = 144/n \\)\n\nMultiplying both sides by n²:\n\n9216 = 144n\n\nSo, n = 9216 / 144 = 64.\n\nHmm, okay, so if n is 64, then all a_i are equal, and each a_i is 96/64 = 1.5.\n\nLet's check the third equation to see if this holds:\n\na³ = (1.5)³ = 3.375\n\nThen, sum of cubes would be n * 3.375 = 64 * 3.375\n\nCalculating that: 64 *"

So n=64 works with all a_i equal to 1.5.\n\nSo, 64 is a possible value of n.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n.\" So, is n=64 the only possible value? Or are there other n's where the sums hold, even if the a_i aren't all equal?\n\nHmm, I need to check if there are other possibilities where the sums can be achieved with different a_i's.\n\nI remember that for the sums to be consistent, there's a relationship between the sums of powers. Maybe I can use some inequality here.\n\nCauchy-Schwarz says that (sum a_i^2)(sum 1^2) >= (sum a_i)^2. Let's see.\n\nGiven sum a_i = 96, sum a_i^2 =144.\n\nSo, (144)(n) >= 96²\n\nCalculate 96²: 96*96=9216\n\nThus, 144n >=9216 → n >= 9216/144=64\n\nSo, n>=64.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of cubes is 216. Maybe we can use Hölder's inequality or some other inequality to find more constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the power mean inequality.\n\nThe power mean inequality states that for positive real numbers,\n\n( (sum a_i^k)/(n) )^(1/k) is non-decreasing with k.\n\nSo, the mean of the first power is 96/n, the mean of the second power is 144/n, the mean of the third power is 216/n.\n\nSo, according to the power mean inequality:\n\n( (sum a_i)/n ) <= ( (sum a_i²)/n )^(1/2) <= ( (sum a_i³)/n )^(1/3 )\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\nLeft side: 96/n\n\nMiddle: sqrt(144/n)\n\nRight: (216/n)^(1/3)\n\nSo, the inequality is:\n\n96/n <= sqrt(144/n) <= (216/n)^(1/3)\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, 96/n <= sqrt(144/n)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(96/n)^2 <= 144/n\n\nSo, 9216/n² <="

Maybe that's the only solution.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n,\" which suggests there may be more than one n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not.

So, each term would be smaller on average.\n\nBut then, the sum of squares would be fixed at 144, which is lower than what would be expected if all terms are equal.\n\nWait, let me think about that.\n\nIf n=64, then each a_i is 1.5, as we saw. The sum of squares is 144.\n\nIf n were greater than 64, say n=65, then each term would be 96/65≈1.4769, which is slightly less than 1.5.\n\nBut then the sum of squares would be 65*(1.4769)^2≈65*(2.181)≈140. So 140 <144. So the sum of squares would be lower than 144, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, if n increases beyond 64, the sum of squares would decrease below 144, which is not allowed because we have the sum of squares fixed at 144. Similarly, if n is less than 64, the sum of squares would be higher.
