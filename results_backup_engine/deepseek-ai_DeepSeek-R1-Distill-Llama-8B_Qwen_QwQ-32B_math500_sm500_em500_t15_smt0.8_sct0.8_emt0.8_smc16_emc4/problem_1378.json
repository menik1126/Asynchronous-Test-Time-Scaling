            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under a matrix M. The matrix M takes the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3) and the vector (1, -3) to (7, -1). Hmm, okay. I'm a bit new to this, but I remember that matrices can transform vectors, so I guess I need to figure out what matrix M looks like first. Once I have M, I can apply it to the line y = 2x + 1 and find its image.\n\nLet me start by recalling that a matrix transformation can be represented as M * vector = transformed vector. So, if I have two vectors, I can set up a system of equations to find the matrix M. The standard approach is to express the transformation in terms of columns or rows. Since M is a 2x2 matrix, I can let M = [[a, b], [c, d]]. Then, applying M to the vector (2, -1) should give (9, 3), and applying M to (1, -3) should give (7, -1).\n\nSo, writing that out:\n\nFor the first vector:\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nFor the second vector:\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nNow I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nI need to solve this system to find a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me start with equations 1 and 3 to solve for a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nI can use substitution or elimination. Let me solve equation 1 for b:\n\nb = 2a - 9\n\nThen plug this into equation 3:\n\na - 3*(2a - 9) = 7\na - 6a + 27 = 7\n-5a = -20\na = 4\n\nThen, b = 2"

So M is correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M. So, I need to find what happens when M is applied to points on this line. Alternatively, maybe I can find an expression for y after the transformation.\n\nWait, but how do you find the image of a line under a matrix transformation? I think the image will also be a line, so I need to find the equation of the image line.\n\nI remember that the image of a line under a linear transformation is another line. So, I can pick two points on the original line, transform them, and then find the equation of the line connecting the transformed points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the transformation in terms of the line y = 2x +1, substitute into the transformation, and solve for y.\n\nLet me see.\n\nGiven that y = 2x + 1, any point (x, y) on this"

Applying the matrix M to this vector:\n\nM * [x; 2x +1] = [4x -1*(2x +1); 2x +1*(2x +1)]\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\nFirst component (x-coordinate after transformation):\n\n4x -1*(2x +1) = 4x -2x -1 = 2x -1\n\nSecond component (y-coordinate after transformation):\n\n2x +1*(2x +1) = 2x +2x +1 = 4x +1\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again.\n\nWait, the second component is 2x (from the second row first element times x) plus 1*(2x +1) (second row second element times y). So yes:\n\nSecond component: 2*x + 1*(2x +1) = 2x + 2x +1 = 4x +1. That's correct.\n\nSo the transformed point is (2x -1, 4x +1). Now, to find the equation of the line, we can express y in terms of x.\n\nLet me denote the transformed coordinates as (X, Y). So,\n\nX = 2x -1\n\nY = 4x +1\n\nWe need to eliminate the parameter x and find Y in terms of X.\n\nFrom the first equation, solve for x:\n\nX = 2x -1 => 2x = X +1 => x = (X +1)/2\n\nSubstitute this into Y:\n\nY = 4*( (X +1)/2 ) +1 = 2*(X +1) +1 = 2X +2 +1 = 2X +3\n\nWait, so Y = 2X +3. Therefore, the equation is Y = 2X +3. So in the original variables, the image is y = 2x +3. But let me check again.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in the transformed coordinates, the coordinates are (X, Y). So the equation is Y = 2X +3. So the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M is Y = 2X +3, so in standard form, that would be y = 2x +3. But let me verify this"

So the transformed point is (-1,1).\n\nNow, plugging into Y = 2X +3: Y = 2*(-1) +3 = -2 +3 = 1. Correct.\n\nTake another point, say x=1, y=3: (1,3). Applying M:\n\n[4*1 + (-1)*3; 2*1 +1*3] = [4 -3; 2 +3] = [1;5]. So the point is (1,5). Plugging into Y = 2X +3: Y = 2*1 +3 = 5. Correct.\n\nAnother point, x=2, y=5. Applying M:\n\n[4*2 + (-1)*5 = 8 -5 =3; 2*2 +1*5 =4 +5=9]. So the point is (3,9). Check Y=2X +3: 2*3 +3=9. Correct.\n\nWait, so this seems to work. So the image line is indeed Y=2X+3.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because sometimes, when you have a linear transformation, the image of a line through the origin is another line through the origin, or scaled. But in this case, our original line isn't through the origin. So the transformed line will be another line, which might not pass through the origin.\n\nWait, in our case, the image line is Y=2X+3, which indeed doesn't pass through the origin, since when X=0, Y=3. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a linear transformation followed by a translation? Wait no, because M is a linear transformation, so it's not necessarily affine unless it's an affine transformation. But in this problem, M is linear, so the image of a line is another line, which might be expressed as Y = aX + b.\n\nI think the approach I took is correct. So, to recap:\n\n1.

Wait, but in the transformed coordinates, the variables are X and Y, so the equation is Y = 2X +3, so in the problem's terms, they probably want the answer in terms of y and x, so replacing X with x and Y with y, so y = 2x +3. That should be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem, just to be thorough.\n\nAnother method: The image of a line under a linear transformation can be found by transforming two points on the line and then finding the equation of the line through the transformed points.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nTake two points on the original line y = 2x +1.\n\nFirst point: Let x = 0, then y = 1. So point A is (0,1).\n\nSecond point: Let x = 1, then y = 3. So point B is (1,3).\n\nThird point: Let x = -1, then y = -1. Wait, 2*(-1) +1 = -2 +1 = -1, so point C is (-1, -1). Maybe use three points to check.\n\nApply M to point A (0,1):\n\nM*(0,1) = [4*0 + (-1)*1, 2*0 +1*1]^T = (-1,1).

Now, using point A' (-1,1):\n\ny -1 = 2(x +1)\ny = 2x +2 +1\ny = 2x +3.\n\nSame result. So using either method, the line after transformation is y = 2x +3.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that this is the correct image.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe image of the line under the transformation is \\boxed{y = 2x + 3}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the image of the line \\( y = 2x + 1 \\) under the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\), we first determine the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) using the given transformations.
