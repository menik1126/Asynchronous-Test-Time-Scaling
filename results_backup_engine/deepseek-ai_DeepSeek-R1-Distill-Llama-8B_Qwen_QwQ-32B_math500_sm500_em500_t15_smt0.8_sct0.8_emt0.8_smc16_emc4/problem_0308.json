            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = 2x / (x² - 5x - 14), and then add the values of a, b, and c together where x = a and x = b are the vertical asymptotes, and y = c is the horizontal asymptote. \n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator to find those x-values.\n\nLet me start by factoring x² - 5x - 14. To factor a quadratic of the form x² + bx + c, I need two numbers that multiply to c and add up to b. Here, c is -14 and b is -5. So, what two numbers multiply to -14 and add to -5? Let me think... Hmm,  -7 and 2. Because -7 * 2 = -14, and -7 + 2 = -5. So, the denominator factors to (x - 7)(x + 2). \n\nSo, f(x) = 2x / [(x - 7)(x + 2)]. Now, the denominator is zero when x - 7 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, which means x = 7 and x = -2. But I need to check if the numerator is also zero at these points. The numerator is 2x, so when x = 7, numerator is 14, and when x = -2, numerator is -4, neither of which is zero. So, yes, x = 7 and x = -2 are vertical asymptotes. So, a = 7 and b = -2.\n\nNext, horizontal asymptotes. I remember the rules for horizontal asymptotes based on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The function is f(x) = 2x / (x² -5x -14). The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. The leading coefficient of numerator is 2, and denominator is 1. So, the horizontal asymptote is y = 2/1 = 2. Therefore, c ="

So, the sum is 7.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify the factoring again: (x - 7)(x + 2) is x² -5x -14, which matches the denominator. So, vertical asymptotes are correct. For horizontal asymptote, since degree of denominator is higher, it's ratio of leading terms, which is 2/1, so y=2. That seems correct. Adding a=7, b=-2, c=2: 7 + (-2) is 5, plus 2 is 7. I think that's right. I don't see any errors in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes and horizontal asymptote of \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   The denominator is \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\). Factoring this quadratic, we get:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)\n   \\]\n   So, \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)} \\).\n\n2. **Find Vertical Asymptotes:**\n   The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero (and the numerator isn't zero). Setting each factor equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   x - 7 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the vertical asymptotes are \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). So, \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( b = -2 \\).\n\n3. **Determine Horizontal Asymptote:**\n   Since the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2), the horizontal asympt"
