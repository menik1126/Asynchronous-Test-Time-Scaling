Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that both sides of the equation are cubic expressions. Maybe I can expand them and see if that helps. Expanding each term might make it easier to find the roots.\n\nStarting with the left-hand side (LHS): (x - 3)^3 and (x - 7)^3.\n\nI remember the formula for expanding (a - b)^3 is a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3. Let me apply that.\n\nFor (x - 3)^3:\n= x^3 - 3x^2*3 + 3x*(3)^2 - (3)^3\n= x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27.\n\nSimilarly, for (x - 7)^3:\n= x^3 - 3x^2*7 + 3x*(7)^2 - (7)^3\n= x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343.\n\nNow, adding these two together:\nLHS = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)\n= 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370.\n\nOkay, so LHS simplifies to 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370.\n\nNow, let me expand the right-hand side (RHS): (2x - 10)^3.\n\nUsing the same expansion formula:\n= (2x)^3 - 3*(2x)^2*10 + 3*(2x)*(10)^2 - (10)^3\n= 8x^3 - 3*4x^2*10 + 3*2x*100 - 1000\n= 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.\n\nSo, RHS is 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.\n\nNow, bringing everything to"

Let me see, all coefficients are divisible by -6, but maybe it's better to factor out a 6 or -6 to make the equation simpler.\n\nLet me factor out a -6:\n\n-6(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105) = 0.\n\nSince -6 is not zero, we can divide both sides by -6:\n\nx^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to find the roots of this cubic equation: x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 = 0.\n\nFinding roots of a cubic can be tricky, but maybe there's a rational root. The Rational Root Theorem says that possible rational roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient. Here, constant term is -105, and leading coefficient is 1. So possible rational roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.\n\nLet me test these values one by one.\n\nTesting x=1:\n1 -15 +71 -105 = (1 -15) + (71 -105) = (-14) + (-34) = -48 ≠ 0.\n\nx=3:\n27 - 135 + 213 -105 = (27 -135) + (213 -105"

Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.\n\nUsing synthetic division for x=3:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -15 | 71 | -105\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1*3=3, add to -15: -12.\n\nMultiply -12*3= -36, add to 71: 35.\n\nMultiply 35*3=105, add to -105: 0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x - 3)(x^2 - 12x + 35).\n\nNow, factor the quadratic: x^2 -12x +35.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12. Hmm, -5 and -7, because (-5)*(-7)=35, and (-5)+(-7)= -12.\n\nSo, x^2 -12x +35 = (x -5)(x -7).\n\nThus, the equation factors completely as:\n\n(x -3)(x -5)(x -7) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=3, x=5, x=7.\n\nWait, but I should check if these are actually roots of the original equation because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially when cubing terms, extraneous solutions can appear.\n\nLet me verify each root in the original equation:\n\nOriginal equation: (x -3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x -10)^3.\n\nCheck x=3:\n\nLeft side: (0)^3 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64.\n\nRight side: (6 -10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64. So, -64=-64. Correct.\n\nCheck x=5:\n\nLeft side: (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0.\n\nRight side: (10 -10)^3 = 0. So, 0=0. Correct.\n\nCheck x=7:\n\nLeft side: (4)^3 + (0)^3 = 64 + 0 = 64.\n\nRight side: (14 -10)^3 = (4)^3 = 64. So, 64=64. Correct.\n\nAll roots check out. So"
