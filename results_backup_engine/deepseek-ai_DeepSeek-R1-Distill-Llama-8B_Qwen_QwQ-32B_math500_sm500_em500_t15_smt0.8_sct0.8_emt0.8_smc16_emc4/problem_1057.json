            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since a regular hexagon has six equal sides, I can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by six.\n\nGiven that each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, I need to find the perimeter of the regular octagon, as it is given that both the octagon and the hexagon have the same perimeter. Therefore, the perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm.\n\nA regular octagon has eight equal sides, so to find the length of each side of the octagon, I divide the total perimeter by eight. Dividing 96 cm by eight gives each side of the octagon a length of 12 cm.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon**\n\n   A regular hexagon has **6** equal sides.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times \\text{side length} = 6 \\times 16\\,\\text{cm} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Perimeter of the Octagon**\n\n   Since the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the Length of Each Side of the Octagon**\n\n   A regular octagon has **8** equal sides.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of each side of octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{8} = \\frac{96\\,\\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\,\\text{cm}}\n\\]"
