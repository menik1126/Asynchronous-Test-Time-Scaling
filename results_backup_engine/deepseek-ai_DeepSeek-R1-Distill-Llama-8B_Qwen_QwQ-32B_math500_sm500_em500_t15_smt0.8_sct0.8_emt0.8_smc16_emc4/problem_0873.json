            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to combine these terms: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3, and express it in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I need to find a + b + c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression has two parts: one involving √2 and the other involving √3. It might be easier if I handle them separately and then combine the results. Let me write down the two parts separately.\n\nThe first part is √2 + 1/√2. Let me try to combine these two terms. To add them together, I need a common denominator. Since one is √2 and the other is 1/√2, the common denominator would be √2. So, I can rewrite √2 as (√2 * √2)/√2, which simplifies to 2/√2. Then, adding 1/√2 gives me (2 + 1)/√2, which is 3/√2. So, the first part becomes 3/√2.\n\nWait, but having a square root in the denominator is usually not preferred. Maybe I should rationalize the denominator here. Multiplying numerator and denominator by √2 gives me (3√2)/2. So, the first part simplifies to 3√2/2.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second part: √3 + 1/√3. I'll use the same approach. Let me express √3 as (√3 * √3)/√3, which is 3/√3. Then, adding 1/√3 gives (3 + 1)/√3 = 4/√3. Just like before, rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √3, which gives 4√3/3.\n\nNow, combining both parts: the first part is 3√2/2 and the second part is 4√3/3. So, adding them together, the entire expression becomes (3√2/2) + (4√3/3). Hmm, now I have two fractions with different denominators. I need to combine them into a single fraction. To do that, I need a common denominator"

            "output": " for 2 and 3. The least common denominator (LCD) is 6.\n\nSo, I'll convert both fractions to have 6 as the denominator. For the first fraction, 3√2/2, I multiply numerator and denominator by 3, giving (9√2)/6. For the second fraction, 4√3/3, I multiply numerator and denominator by 2, giving (8√3)/6.\n\nNow, adding these two together: (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Wait, is that the final form? The expression is (9√2 + 8√3)/6. So, in the form they asked for, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. But let me check if c can be any smaller. The denominators we had were 2 and 3, and the LCD is 6. I don't think it can be smaller since 2 and 3 are coprime. So, c must be 6.\n\nThus, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Adding them together: 9 + 8 + 6 = 23. Hmm, so 23 is the answer? Let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for √2 + 1/√2: I correctly converted √2 to 2/√2, added 1/√2 to get 3/√2, and then rationalized it to 3√2/2. That seems right.\n\nThen, for √3 + 1/√3: I converted √3 to 3/√3, added 1/√3 to get 4/√3, and then rationalized to 4√3/3. That also seems correct.\n\nNext, adding 3√2/2 and 4√3/3, I found the LCD is 6, converted each fraction accordingly: 9√2/6 + 8√3/6. Adding them together gives (9√2 + 8√3)/6. So, that's correct.\n\nSince 6 is the smallest possible denominator for the combined fraction, the values of a, b, c are indeed 9, 8, 6, and their sum is 23. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n"
