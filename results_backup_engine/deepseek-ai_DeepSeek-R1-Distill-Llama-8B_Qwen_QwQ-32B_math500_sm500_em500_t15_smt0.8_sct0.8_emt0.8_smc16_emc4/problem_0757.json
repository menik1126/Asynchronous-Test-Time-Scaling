            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. The sequence is labeled a₁, a₂, a₃, and so on. The problem says that for every positive integer k, two specific subsequences have special properties: one is a geometric sequence and the other is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nLet me break it down. For every k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} forms a geometric sequence. That means each term after the first is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, in a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. Let me denote the common ratio as r. Then, we have:\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r\n\nand\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r = a_{2k-1} * r².\n\nOkay, that's the geometric part. Now, the other subsequence is arithmetic. It says that a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic sequence. In an arithmetic sequence, each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference. Let me denote this common difference as d. So, we have:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d\n\nand\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d = a_{2k} + 2d.\n\nBut wait, from the geometric sequence part, we already have a_{2k+1} in terms of a_{2k-1}. Specifically, a_{2k+1} = a_{2k-1} * r².\n\nSo, from the arithmetic sequence, a_{2k+1} is also a_{2k} + d. Therefore, we can equate these two expressions:\n\na_{2k-1} * r² = a_{2k} + d.\n\nBut we also know from the geometric sequence that a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r. So, substituting that into the equation:\n\na_{2k-1} * r² = (a_{2k-1} * r) + d.\n\nWe can simplify this:\n\na_{2k-1} * r² - a_{2k"

So, d is dependent on a_{2k-1} and r. But since the sequence is strictly increasing, both r and d must be such that all terms are positive integers and increasing.\n\nAlso, since it's a geometric sequence, r must be a positive rational number, but since we're dealing with integers, r is probably an integer greater than 1. Otherwise, if r is a fraction, we might get non-integer terms, but the problem says the sequence is of positive integers.\n\nSo, let's assume r is an integer. That makes sense because each term is an integer multiplied by r to get the next term.\n\nSo, if r is an integer greater than 1, and d is also an integer, we can think about how these relate term by term.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence structure. It's built in such a way that every two terms form a geometric pair, and then the next term after that is related by an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo, to get a handle on this, maybe I can consider the first few terms and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet me denote the first term as a₁. Then, since the subsequence a₁, a₂, a₃ is geometric, we have a₂ = a₁ * r and a₃ = a₂ * r = a₁ * r².\n\nThen, the next part is the arithmetic sequence a₂, a₃, a₄. So, a₄ is a₃ + d = a₁ * r² + d.\n\nBut from the geometric sequence, a₄ is part of the next geometric triplet: a₃, a₄, a₅. Since a₄ = a₃ + d, and a₅ must be a geometric sequence from a₃, so a₅ = a₄ * r = (a₁ * r² + d) * r.\n\nBut also, in the arithmetic sequence a₄, a₅, a₆, we have:\n\na₅ = a₄ + d'.\n\nWait, but hold on. Earlier, we considered the arithmetic sequence as a_{2k},"

So, each geometric triplet can have its own ratio, and each arithmetic triplet can have its own difference.

That complicates the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern that allows the ratios and differences to be consistent?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios and differences are related in a way that allows the sequence to be built in a consistent manner.\n\nHmm, this might be tricky.

So 2016 isn't a multiple of 49, so x isn't an integer. Therefore, this approach fails.\n\nHmm, so setting r=2 gives that a_{13}=49x, which must equal 2016. Since 49 doesn't divide 2016 (as 2016=49*41 +7), this is invalid.\n\nTherefore, r=2 is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying another constant ratio.\n\nWait, let's see if there is another constant ratio that could make a_{13}=2016. But given that in this approach, a_{13}=49x, it's likely that the ratio must vary to make a_{13} an integer multiple.\n\nBut perhaps if ratios aren't constant, but the recursion allows a_{13} to be 2016.\n\nWait, but earlier, the recursion led to an irrational ratio, which complicates integer terms.\n\nHmm, perhaps a different approach: if we can model the sequence in terms of a₁ and k, and relate a_{13} to a₁, then solve for a₁.\n\nGiven that each term is related via geometric and arithmetic steps, perhaps a_{13} can be written in terms of a₁ multiplied by a product of ratios and some function of k.\n\nWait, let me try to compute a few terms in terms of a₁ and see the pattern.\n\nLet me denote the terms as follows:\n\na₁ =a₁\n\na₂=a₁*r₁\n\na₃=a₂*r₁=a₁*r₁²\n\na₄=2a₃ -a₂=2a₁*r₁² -"
