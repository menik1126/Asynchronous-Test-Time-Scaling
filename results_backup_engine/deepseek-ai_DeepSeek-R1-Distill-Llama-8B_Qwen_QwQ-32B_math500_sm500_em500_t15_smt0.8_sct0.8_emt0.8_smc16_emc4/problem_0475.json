Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in problems involving symmetric equations, sometimes it helps to use symmetric sums or think about the variables as roots of a polynomial. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote:\n- \\( S = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\) (this is actually what we need to find)\n- \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\) (given)\n\nI also remember that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\) can be expressed in terms of S, P, and Q. The formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q \\)\n\nGiven that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\) and Q is 4, let's plug those into the equation:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3 S P + 3 * 4 \\)\nSimplifying:\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3 S P + 12 \\)\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\\( -8 = S^3 - 3 S P \\)\nLet me write that as:\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\)  --- Equation (1)\n\nNow, looking at the third equation: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor or simplify it. Maybe group terms:\n\nLet me group them as:\n\\( (xy^2 + x^2 y) + (xz^2 + x^2 z) + (yz^2 + y^2 z) \\)\n\nEach of these groups can"

Let me substitute that in:\n\nSo, the third equation becomes:\n\\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) = 12 \\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n- \\( xy(S - z) = S xy - x y z \\)\n- \\( xz(S - y) = S xz - x y z \\)\n- \\( yz(S - x) = S yz - x y z \\)\n\nSo adding them together:\n\\( S(xy + xz + yz) - 3 x y z = 12 \\)\n\nNotice that \\( xy + xz + yz = P \\), and \\( x y z = Q = 4 \\). So substituting:\n\n\\( S * P - 3 * 4 = 12 \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( S P - 12 = 12 \\)\nSo, \\( S P = 24 \\)  --- Equation (2)\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n1. \\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\)\n2. \\( S P = 24 \\)\n\nLet me substitute Equation (2) into Equation (1). Since \\( S P = 24 \\), then:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 * 24 = -8 \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( S^3 - 72 = -8 \\)\nSo,\n\\( S^3 = 64 \\)\nTherefore, \\( S = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\)\n\nSo, \\( S = 4 \\).

Oh, t=2 is a root.\n\nSo, we can factor it as \\( (t - 2)(t^2 - 2 t + 2) = 0 \\). Then the roots are t=2, and the roots of \\( t^2 - 2 t + 2 = 0 \\), which are \\( t = [2 ± \\sqrt{4 - 8}]/2 = 1 ± i \\).
