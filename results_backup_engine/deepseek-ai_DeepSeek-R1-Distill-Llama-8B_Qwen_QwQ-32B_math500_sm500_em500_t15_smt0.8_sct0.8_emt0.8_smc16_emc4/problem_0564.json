            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of seating arrangements for the Senate committee members around a circular table, with the condition that all members of each party sit together. Since the table is circular, the number of linear arrangements is reduced by one to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nNext, I'll consider the grouping of each party as a single unit. This means there are three units to arrange: the Democrats, the Republicans, and the Independent. The number of ways to arrange these three units around the circular table is (3-1)! = 2! = 2.\n\nThen, within each party unit, the members can be arranged among themselves. The Democrats have 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans have 5 members, which can be arranged in 5! ways. The Independent is a single individual, so there's only 1 way to arrange them.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of distinct seating arrangements, I'll multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the members within each unit. That is, 2! multiplied by 5! (Democrats) and 5! (Republicans). After calculating these values and multiplying them together, the final answer will give the total number of valid seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe have a Senate committee with:\n- 5 Democrats\n- 5 Republicans\n- 1 Independent\n\nThey need to sit around a circular table, with all members of each party sitting next to each other. Rotations of the seating are considered equivalent.\n\n**Step 2: Break Down the Problem**\n\n1. **Arrange the Party Units:**\n   - Treat each party as a single unit.\n   - There are 3 units: D (Democrats), R (Republicans), I (Independent).\n   - In a circular arrangement, the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) units is \\( (n-1)! \\).\n   - Here, \\( n = 3 \\), so \\( (3-1)! = 2! = 2 \\) ways.\n\n2. **Arrange Members Within Each Party:**\n   - Democrats: 5 members can be arranged in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n   - Republicans: 5 members can be arranged in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n   - Independent: Only 1 way.\n\n**"
