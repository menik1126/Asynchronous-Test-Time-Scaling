            "output": "Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x). The function is given as g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2]. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root needs to be non-negative. Otherwise, we'd be taking the square root of a negative number, which isn't a real number. So, my main goal here is to find the values of x for which the expression inside the square root is greater than or equal to zero. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let's write down the inequality we need to solve:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0.\n\nNow, I need to simplify this inequality to find the values of x that satisfy it. I think I can expand both squares and then simplify the expression.\n\nLet me expand (x - 3)^2 first. That's (x - 3)(x - 3). Using the distributive property (FOIL method), that becomes x^2 - 3x - 3x + 9, which simplifies to x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nNext, I'll expand (x - 8)^2. That's (x - 8)(x - 8). Applying the same method, it becomes x^2 - 8x - 8x + 64, which simplifies to x^2 - 16x + 64.\n\nSo, now my inequality becomes:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) ≥ 0.\n\nLet me subtract the second quadratic from the first. So, distribute the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 ≥ 0.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. The x^2 terms cancel out because +x^2 - x^2 = 0. Then, the x terms: -6x + 16x = 10x. The constants: 9 - 64 = -55.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the inequality simplifies to:\n\n10x - 55 ≥ "

            "output": "0.\n\nNow, I'll solve for x. Let's add 55 to both sides:\n\n10x - 55 + 55 ≥ 0 + 55\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10x ≥ 55.\n\nNext, divide both sides by 10:\n\nx ≥ 55/10.\n\n55 divided by 10 is 5.5. So, x ≥ 5.5.\n\nWait a second, that's interesting. So, the expression inside the square root is non-negative when x is greater than or equal to 5.5. That means the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x such that x ≥ 5.5. So, the smallest real number x in the domain would be x = 5.5.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, especially when subtracting them, it's easy to mix up signs.\n\nLet me re-calculate the expansion step. (x - 3)^2 is indeed x² -6x +9, and (x -8)^2 is x² -16x +64. Subtracting the second from the first: (x² -6x +9) - (x² -16x +64) = x² -6x +9 -x² +16x -64.\n\nCombining terms: x² -x² is 0. -6x +16x is +10x. 9 -64 is -55. So, 10x -55 ≥ 0. Which leads to x ≥ 5.5.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Instead of expanding, I could have recognized that (x - 3)^2 - (x -8)^2 is a difference of squares. Remember, the difference of squares formula is a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). So, perhaps I can factor the expression.\n\nLet me try that method as a check.\n\nGiven (x - 3)^2 - (x -8)^2. Let a = (x - 3) and b = (x -8). So, a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b).\n\nCalculating a - b: (x -3) - (x -8) = x -3 -x +8 = (x -"

            "output": "x) + (-3 +8) = 0 +5 =5.\n\nCalculating a + b: (x -3) + (x -8) = 2x -11.\n\nSo, the expression becomes 5*(2x -11). Therefore, (x -3)^2 - (x -8)^2 factors to 5*(2x -11).\n\nTherefore, the inequality is 5*(2x -11) ≥ 0.\n\nSince 5 is positive, the inequality is determined by the other factor:\n\n2x -11 ≥ 0.\n\nAdding 11 to both sides: 2x ≥11.\n\nDividing by 2: x ≥ 11/2.\n\n11/2 is 5.5, so x ≥5.5. So, same result as before. That's good, it confirms my earlier answer.\n\nTherefore, the domain of g(x) is [5.5, ∞). So, the smallest real number x in the domain would be 5.5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should test a value just below 5.5 and just above to ensure that indeed the expression inside the square root is negative below 5.5 and positive above.\n\nLet me test x =5, which is less than 5.5.\n\nCompute (5 -3)^2 - (5 -8)^2 = (2)^2 - (-3)^2 =4 -9 = -5. Which is negative. So, inside the square root is negative, which is not allowed, so x=5 is not in the domain.\n\nNow, test x=6, which is greater than 5.5.\n\nCompute (6 -3)^2 - (6 -8)^2 = (3)^2 - (-2)^2 =9 -4 =5, which is positive. So, inside the square root is positive, which is allowed, so x=6 is in the domain.\n\nTherefore, the domain starts at x=5.5, so the smallest real number in the domain is 5.5.\n\nI think that's solid. So, in conclusion, the smallest real number x in the domain of g(x) is 5.5, which can be written as 11/2 or 5.5. Since the question asks for the smallest real number, 5.5 is appropriate. Alternatively, if expressed as a fraction, it's 11/2,"
