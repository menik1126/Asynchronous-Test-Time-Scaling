There are 100 terms in total, which means there are 50 positive terms and 50 negative terms.\n\nNext, I calculate the sum of the positive terms, which are the odd-numbered terms: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 99. This is an arithmetic series with 50 terms, where each term increases by 2.\n\nThen, I calculate the sum of the negative terms, which are the even-numbered terms: -2 + (-4) + (-6) + ... + (-100). This is also an arithmetic series with 50 terms, each term decreasing by 2.\n\nAfter finding both sums, I add them together: (Sum of positive terms) + (Sum of negative terms).\n\nFinally, I simplify the expression to find the final result.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** Compute: \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\).\n\n---\n\nLet's break down the computation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Series\nThe given series is an alternating series:\n\\[\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\n\\]\nThere are **100 terms** in total. Since it's an alternating series, we have **50 positive terms** and **50 negative terms**.\n\n### Step 2: Group the Terms\nTo simplify the computation, group the terms into pairs:\n\\[\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n\\]\nEach pair consists of an odd number minus the following even number.\n\n### Step 3: Compute Each Pair\nEach pair can be represented as:\n\\[\n(2n - 1) - 2n = -1\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) ranges from 1 to 50.\n\n### Step 4: Total Number of Pairs\nThere are **50 such pairs**, each summing to \\(-1\\).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Sum\n\\[\n\\text{Total Sum} = 50 \\times (-1) = -50\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
