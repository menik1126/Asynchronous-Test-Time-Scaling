I'll start by dividing 999 by 6 to find the coefficients for each power of six.\n\nThe first division gives 166 with a remainder of 3. This means the least significant digit in base six will be 3.\n\nNext, I'll divide 166 by 6, which gives 27 with a remainder of 4. So, the next digit from right to left is 4.\n\nThen, I'll divide 27 by 6, resulting in 4 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, the next digit is 3.\n\nFinally, I'll divide 4 by 6, which gives 0 with a remainder of 4. This means the most significant digit is 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the base six representation of 999 in decimal is 4433₆.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of \\( 999_{10} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6 and keep track of the remainder.**  \n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Least significant digit (rightmost digit):** 3\n\n2. **Divide 166 by 6 and keep track of the remainder.**  \n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Next digit (moving left):** 4\n\n3. **Divide 27 by 6 and keep track of the remainder.**  \n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Next digit (moving left):** 3\n\n4. **Divide 4 by 6 and keep track of the remainder.**  \n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Most significant digit (leftmost digit):** 4\n\n5. **Combine all the remainders from last to first:**  \n   - Starting with the most significant digit: 4\n   - Next digit: 3\n   - Next digit: 4\n   - Least significant digit: 3  \n  "
