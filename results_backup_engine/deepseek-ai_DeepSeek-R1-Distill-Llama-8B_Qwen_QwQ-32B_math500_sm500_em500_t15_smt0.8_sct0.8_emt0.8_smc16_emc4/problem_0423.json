The equation given is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), and we need to find the sum of the reciprocals of the products of each root with its complex conjugate. That is, we need to compute \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r_5}}\\).\n\nFirst, I recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), its complex conjugate \\(\\overline{r}\\) has the property that their product is equal to the square of the modulus of \\(r\\). So, \\(r\\overline{r} = |r|^2\\). Therefore, each term in the sum we're trying to compute is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). This simplifies our goal to finding the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) for \\(i = 1\\) to \\(5\\).\n\nGiven that the equation is a polynomial of degree 10, there are 10 roots in total, which are paired as \\(r_j\\) and \\(\\overline{r_j}\\). So, we have 5 pairs of complex conjugate roots. \n\nLooking at the equation, it's of the form \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). To analyze this, I might try expanding \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) using the binomial theorem, but that seems messy and time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify the equation.\n\nLet me let \\(y = 13x - 1\\). Then, the equation becomes \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\). Hmm, that's interesting because \\(x^{10} = -y^{10}\\), so \\(x = \\omega y\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of -1. Since \\(-1\\) can be written as \\(e^{i\\pi}\\), so the roots are \\(e^{i(\\pi + 2k\\pi)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 9.\n\nBut wait, since we're dealing"

The sum we're trying to compute relates to the product of roots. Specifically, if I can find a polynomial whose roots are \\(1/|r_i|^2\\), then the sum we're looking for would be the sum of the roots of this new polynomial, which could be found using Vieta's.\n\nTherefore, let me consider the transformation \\(y = 1/|x|^2\\).

Wait, the problem lists the roots as \\(r_1, \\overline{r_1}, r_2, \\overline{r_2}, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r_5}\\), so the terms in the sum are each from one of the \\(r_i\\), so the total is 5 terms.

Let me think about Vieta's formula. Let me denote the polynomial as \\(P(x) = x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}\\). The roots of this polynomial are the \\(r_j\\) and their conjugates. The product of all roots is the constant term divided by the leading coefficient, up to a sign.

Let me compute the constant term and leading coefficient.\n\nThe leading term of \\(x^{10}\\) is \\(x^{10}\\), and the leading term of \\((13x -1)^{10}\\) is \\((13x)^{10}\\)."

Let's compute \\(0^{10} + (13*0 -1)^{10} = 0 + (-1)^{10} = 1\\). So, the constant term is 1.\n\nTherefore, by Vieta, the product of all roots is \\((-1)^{10} \\times 1 / (1 + 13^{10})\\).

Wait, wait, no, k=4 is paired with k=9? Wait, actually, no, the pairing is k and k+5.\n\nk=4 and k=9: For k=4, we have θ=9π/10, 1 - cos(9π/10)=1 + cos(π/10). For k=9, θ=19π/10, 1 - cos(19π/10)=1 + cos(π/10). So together, that's 2*(1 + cos(π/10)).\n\nWait, but in my initial pairing, I might have made a mistake. Actually, if we consider that for each k from 0 to 4, their counterparts from k=5 to 9 have angles θ and -θ, but let me think about the 10 terms:\n\nTotal sum = sum_{k=0 to 9} [1 - cosθ_k]\n\nBut θ_k = π(2k + 1)/10.\n\nThus, θ_0 = π/10, θ_1=3π/10,..., θ_4=9π/10, θ_5=11π/10"

Since there are 5 such pairs (since 10 terms), the total sum over all 10 terms is 10.\n\nWait, that's a key insight! Because for each m from 0 to 4, the terms for m and m+5 add up to 2, so 5 pairs give 5*2=10. Therefore, the total sum over all 10 roots of \\(1/|x_i|^2\\) is 338 * 10, since each term is 338*(1 - cosθ). Wait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, actually, each term \\(1/|x_i|^2 = 338*(1 - cosθ_i)\\). Therefore, the total sum over all roots would be 338 * sum_{i=1}^{10} (1 - cosθ_i). But we just found that sum_{i=1}^{10} (1 - cosθ_i) = 10. Therefore, the total sum over all roots is 338 * 10 = 3380. But the problem asks for the sum over the 5 distinct terms (since each pair contributes the same term).

However, because in our substitution, each term 1/|x_i|^2 corresponds to a root and its conjugate, but in the problem's sum, we are adding each pair once. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the problem's sum, it's 1/(r1 \\overline{r1}) + ... +1/(r5 \\overline{r5}), which is adding 5 terms, each corresponding to a unique pair. However, in our total sum over all 10 roots, we have each pair contributing twice the same term. So, the sum in the problem is equal to half of our total sum. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Each pair r_j, \\overline{r_j} has their own 1/|r_j|^2, but because the polynomial is symmetric, both roots will have the same modulus, so 1/|r_j|^2 is the same for r_j and \\overline{r_j}. Therefore, in the problem's sum, which is adding 1/(r1 \\overline{r1}) + ... + 1/(r5 \\overline{r5}), we're only adding each unique term once. However, our total sum over all roots was 3380, which includes both r_j and \\overline{r_j}, each contributing 1/|r_j|^2, so that sum is 2*(sum of the problem's terms). Therefore, the problem's sum is half of 3380, which is 1690.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we have two roots for each pair, each contributing the same term, the sum over all roots is double the sum of the unique terms. So, 3380 is twice the desired sum. Therefore, the desired sum is 3380 / 2 = 1690.\n\nWait, but let me check my logic again. When I computed sum_{"

Therefore, the problem's sum is (total sum)/2 = 3380/2 = 1690.\n\nHowever, earlier in the part where we considered that each pair m and m+5 gives sum 2*(1 - cosθ) + 2*(1 + cosθ)? Wait, no, actually in the previous calculation, I considered that sum_{i=1}^{10} (1 - cosθ_i) = 10, so the total sum over all roots is 338*10. Therefore, the desired sum is half of that, so 1690. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a miscalculation earlier? Let me think again step by step.\n\nFirst, each root corresponds to a θ = π(2k +1)/10 for k from 0 to 9. The value of each 1/|x|^2 is 338*(1 - cosθ). The total sum over all roots is 338 * sum_{k=0}^9 [1 - cosθ_k]. We noticed that for each θ_k, there is a θ_{k+5} such that cosθ_{k+5} = -cosθ_k. Therefore, [1 - cosθ_k] + [1 - cosθ_{k+5}] = [1 - cosθ_k] + [1 - (-cosθ_k)] = 2. \n\nSo, each pair (k, k+5) contributes 2 to the sum. Since there are 5 such pairs (since 10 terms), the total sum over all 10 terms is 5*2 =10. Therefore, the total sum over all roots' reciprocals is 338 *10 = 3380.\n\nBut since the problem requires the sum over the 5 distinct terms (each pair counted once), then since each pair's two roots contribute the same to the reciprocal, the desired sum is 3380 divided by "

But since each pair contributes |r_j|^2, the product is ∏_{j=1}^5 |r_j|^2 = 1/(1 +13^{10} ). Therefore, the product of |r_j|^2 is 1/(1 +13^{10} ). Taking the 5th root, we get the geometric mean of |r_j|^2 is (1/(1 +13^{10} ))^{1/5}. But this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that the sum of 1/|r_j|^2 is equal to the sum of |1/r_j|^2. But since each root satisfies P(x)=0, perhaps there's a generating function or reciprocal polynomial that can be used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the roots x satisfy x^{10} = -(13x -1)^{10}, so x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}=0. Let me denote w = x/(13x -1). Then, x = (w)/(1 - w). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, alternatively, we can take the modulus squared of both sides of x^{10} = -(13x -1)^{10}.

However, since we need to find s = |x|², but this equation has two variables. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that for each root x, the equation |x| = |13x -1| holds. Let me write this as |x| = |13x -1|. Let me denote |x| = r. Then, the equation is r = |13x -1|. Let me write x in polar form: x = r e^{iθ}. Then, 13x -1 = 13 r e^{iθ} -1. The modulus squared is (13r cosθ -1)^2 + (13r sinθ)^2 = (13r)^2 - 26r cosθ +1. Therefore, the modulus is sqrt( (13r)^2 -26r cosθ +1 ).
