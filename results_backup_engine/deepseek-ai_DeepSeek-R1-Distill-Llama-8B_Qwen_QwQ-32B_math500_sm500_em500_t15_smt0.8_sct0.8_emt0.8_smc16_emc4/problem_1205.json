The line is parameterized, and I have an Asymptote figure provided. The figure shows a coordinate system with some grid lines and a red line drawn from point \\( L \\) to point \\( R \\). \n\nFirst, let me recall that the direction vector of a line is essentially the vector that points in the direction the line is heading. So, if I can find two points on the line \\( L \\) to \\( R \\), I can compute the direction vector by subtracting their coordinates.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, I see that points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) are defined as extensions of the line \\( AB \\) from the y-axis. The points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are given as \\( A = (-5, 4) \\) and \\( B = (-1, 3) \\). So, the line segment \\( AB \\) is part of the line we're interested in.\n\nMoreover, points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) are where this line intersects the horizontal lines \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( x = 0 \\). From the Asymptote code, \\( L \\) is the intersection with the line \\( x = -8 \\) to \\( x = 8 \\), specifically at \\( y = 0 \\). Similarly, \\( R \\) is the intersection with the line \\( y = 0 \\) at \\( x = 8 \\).\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the Asymptote code:\n\n- \\( L \\) is the extension of line \\( AB \\) to \\( (-8, 0) \\) to \\( (-8, 1) \\). So, it's the intersection with \\( x = -8 \\).\n\n- Similarly, \\( R \\) is the extension of line \\( AB \\) to \\( (8, 0) \\) to \\( (8, 1) \\). So, \\( R \\) is the intersection with \\( x = 8 \\).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\).

The problem states that the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Since direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, there must be some scalar \\( k \\) such that:\n\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = k \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nWait, but that would mean:\n\n-7 = 4k,\n\nand\n\nb = -k.\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( k = -7/4 \\).\n\nThen substituting into the second equation, \\( b = -(-7/4) = 7/4 \\).\n\nHmm, but let me check if the direction vector is indeed in the direction from A to B or the other way. The direction vector from A to B is \\( B - A = (-1 - (-5), 3 - 4) = (4, -1) \\). So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the direction vector is given"
