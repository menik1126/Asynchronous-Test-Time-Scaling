            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, I remember that for polynomial equations, the Rational Root Theorem can help find possible rational roots. Maybe I can use that here.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, when the polynomial is written in standard form, is a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the leading coefficient is 1 (since the \\(x^4\\) term has a coefficient of 1), so any rational root is actually an integer. That simplifies things because I don't have to worry about fractions.\n\nAlright, so the constant term here is -14. The factors of 14 are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. These are the possible integer roots I need to test. I can use the synthetic division method or just plug each of these into the equation to see if it equals zero. Let me list the possible roots again: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.\n\nI think I'll start testing them one by one. Let's start with the smallest absolute values because they are easier to calculate.\n\nFirst, let me test x=1:\nPlugging into the polynomial: \\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\).\nCalculating each term: 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14.\nAdding them up: 1 + 5 is 6, 6 + 9 is 15, 15 -1 is 14, 14 -14 is 0. Oh, wow, that works! So x=1 is a root.\n\nSince x=1 is a root, I can factor out (x - 1) from the polynomial. Maybe using polynomial division or synthetic division. Let me try synthetic division.\n\nSetting up synthetic division with root 1:\nCoefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\nBring down the 1.\nMultiply"

Add to next coefficient: -1 + 15 = 14.\nMultiply 14 by 1: 14. Add to last coefficient: -14 + 14 = 0. Perfect, no remainder.\n\nSo after division, the polynomial becomes:\n\\( (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14) = 0 \\).\n\nNow I need to factor the cubic polynomial: \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\). Let me use the Rational Root Theorem again. The constant term is 14, so possible roots are again ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nTest x=-1:\n\\((-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 15(-1) + 14\\).\nCalculates to: -1 + 6 -15 +14.\nAdding up: -1 +6=5; 5 -15= -10; -10 +14=4.

Yes, x=-2 is a root.\n\nGreat, so we can factor out (x + 2) from the cubic. Let's do synthetic division again with -2.\n\nCubic: 1 (x^3), 6 (x^2), 15 (x), 14 (constant).\nBring down the 1.\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2. Add to next coefficient: 6 + (-2)=4.\nMultiply 4 by -2: -8. Add to next coefficient: 15 + (-8)=7.\nMultiply 7 by -2: -14. Add to constant term:14 + (-14)=0.\n\nSo after division, the cubic becomes: \\( (x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7) \\).\n\nNow,"

Let's see if this quadratic has integer roots.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where a=1, b=4, c=7.\n\nDiscriminant: \\(16 - 28 = -12\\).

The original equation is quartic, so it can have up to four roots. I found two integer roots, and the other two are complex, so that's all.\n\nJust to make sure, should I test the other possible integer roots in the original equation?
