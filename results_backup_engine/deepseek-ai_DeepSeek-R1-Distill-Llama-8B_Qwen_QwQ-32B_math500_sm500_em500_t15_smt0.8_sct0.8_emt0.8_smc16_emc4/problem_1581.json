            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of (5 divided by the square root of 80 plus the square root of 845 over 9 plus the square root of 45), all divided by the square root of 5. That sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the numerator separately before dealing with the denominator and the square root. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n√[(5/√80 + √845/9 + √45) / √5]\n\nAlright, so the numerator inside the big square root is three terms: 5 divided by √80, √845 divided by 9, and √45. Then, all of that is divided by √5. Then, we take the square root of the entire thing.\n\nHmm, that still looks complicated. Maybe I can simplify each square root first. I remember that to simplify square roots, I should look for factors that are perfect squares. Let's start with each term.\n\nStarting with 5/√80. √80 can be simplified because 80 is 16 times 5, and 16 is a perfect square. So, √80 is equal to √(16*5) which is √16 * √5, which is 4√5. So, 5 divided by √80 becomes 5 / (4√5). That can be simplified further by rationalizing the denominator. To do that, I can multiply numerator and denominator by √5: (5 * √5) / (4 * 5) which simplifies to (√5)/4. Okay, so the first term simplifies to √5/4.\n\nNext term: √845 divided by 9. Let me try to simplify √845. 845 divided by 5 is 169, and 169 is 13 squared. So, 845 is 5 * 169 which is 5 * 13². Therefore, √845 is √(5*13²) which is √5 * √13², which is 13√5. So, √845 is 13√5, and when we divide that by 9, it becomes (13√5)/9.\n\nThird term: √45. Let me simplify √45. 45 is 9*5, so √45 is √(9*5) which is"

            "output": " 3√5.\n\nNow, putting it all back into the numerator: √5/4 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5. So, all these terms have √5 in them, which is good because I can factor that out.\n\nLet me write it as √5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Hmm, okay, let me compute the coefficients inside the parentheses. Let me find a common denominator to add these fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) would be 36.\n\nSo, converting each fraction:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = (13*4)/36 = 52/36\n\n3/1 = 3/1 = 108/36? Wait, no, because if the denominator is 36, then 3 is 3*36/36 which is 108/36.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right because 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, and 3 is 108/36. So, adding them together: 9 + 52 + 108 equals 169. So, the total inside the parentheses is 169/36. Therefore, the numerator becomes √5 * (169/36), which is (169√5)/36.\n\nSo, the entire expression inside the square root now is (169√5)/36 divided by √5. So, that would be [(169√5)/36] / √5. Dividing by √5 is the same as multiplying by 1/√5. So, let's write that as (169√5)/36 * 1/√5. The √5 in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, leaving us with 169/36.\n\nNow, we have √(169/36). The square root of 169 is 13, and the square root of 36 is 6. So, √(169/36) is 13/6.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, does that mean the simplified fraction is 13/6? Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the top: 5/√80 simplifies to √5/4. Yep, because √80 is 4√5, so 5/(4"

So, the numerator becomes √5/4 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5.\n\nFactoring out √5: √5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Let's check that: 1/4 is from √5/4, 13/9 from (13√5)/9, and 3 is from 3√5, so yeah, that's correct.\n\nCalculating 1/4 + 13/9 + 3. Converting to 36 denominator: 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, 3 is 108/36. Adding them: 9 + 52 = 61, 61 + 108 = 169. So, 169/36. So, numerator is √5*(169/36) = 169√5/36.\n\nThen, divide by √5: (169√5/36) / √5 = 169/36. Then, square root of 169/36 is 13/6. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the simplification steps correctly, especially with the square roots.\n\n√80 is 4√5, correct. So, 5/√80 is 5/(4√5) = (5√5)/(4*5) = √5/4. Correct.\n\n√845: 845 ÷ 5 is 169, which is 13². So, √845 is 13√5. Correct.\n\n√45 is 3√5, correct.\n\nThen adding them: √5/4 + 13√5/9 + 3√5. Factoring out √5: √5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). That's correct.\n\nCompute 1/4 + 13/9 + 3. To add these, the LCD is 36. So, 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, and 3 is 108/36. So, 9 + 52 + 108 = 169. So, 169/36. So,"
