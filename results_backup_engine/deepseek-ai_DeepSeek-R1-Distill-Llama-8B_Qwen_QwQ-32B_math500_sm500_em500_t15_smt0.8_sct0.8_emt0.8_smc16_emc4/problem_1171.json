The solutions to this equation are supposed to form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane. I need to find the area of this polygon, express it in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), and then find \\( a + b + p \\). \n\nFirst off, the equation is a quartic, so there are four solutions (roots). These roots are complex numbers, and when plotted in the complex plane, they form a convex polygon. Since it's a quartic, the polygon can be a quadrilateral, but it might also be a triangle if two roots coincide, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nLooking at the equation \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\), it seems a bit daunting at first. But maybe there's a way to factor it or recognize a pattern. The coefficients have a sort of rotational symmetry or something? Let me think.\n\nThe coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Hmm. That does look a bit cyclic but I can't quite place it. Wait, maybe I can factor this equation in terms of a quadratic or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using substitution to make it a quadratic in terms of another variable. Let me try letting \\( w = z^2 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( w^2 + 4z^3i - 6w -4zi - i = 0 \\). Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful because there are still first-degree terms in z.\n\nWait, that substitution might not be the right approach. Maybe another substitution. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation can be written as \\( z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 -4iz - i = 0 \\). Is there a way to factor this? Perhaps grouping terms.\n\nLooking at the terms: \\( z^4 + 4iz^3 -6z^2 -4iz -i = 0 \\). Let's group them as \\( (z^4 + 4iz^3) + (-6z^2 -4iz) -i = 0 \\).\n\nFactor out common terms from each"

So, \\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) = 0 \\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because subtracting \\( (1 + i) \\) would give:\n\n\\( z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 -1 -i = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \\), which matches the given equation.\n\nSo, the equation can be rewritten as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).\n\nNow, to solve for z, we can take the fourth roots of both sides.\n\nFirst, write \\( 1 + i \\) in polar form.\n\nThe complex number \\( 1 + i \\) has magnitude \\( \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\), and its angle (argument) is 45 degrees or \\( \\pi/4 \\) radians.\n\nSo, \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) \\).\n\nTaking the fourth roots, the solutions will be:\n\n\\( z + i = \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\right)^{1/4} \\left[ \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi/4 + 2\\pi k}{4} \\right) + i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi/4 + 2\\pi k}{4} \\right) \\right] \\), where k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nFirst, compute \\( \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\right)^{1/4} \\).

So, each root is this point plus a vector of magnitude 2^{1/8} at the specified angles.\n\nBut plotting these points, they form a polygon. What kind of polygon? Since it's a convex polygon with four vertices, it's probably a quadrilateral, but we can find the area of this quadrilateral.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way to find the area. If these points are equally spaced in angle, but with an initial angle of π/16, so the angles between consecutive roots are 2π/4 = π/2, but the initial θ is π/16, so the spacing isn't uniform with respect to the origin, but with respect to -i.\n\nWait, but in terms of their position relative to each other, the roots are equally spaced around a circle of radius 2^{1/8}, starting at angle π/16.\n\nSo, if I can consider the four points as four equally spaced points on a circle, each at angle π/16, 9π/16, 17π/16, 25π/16. So, essentially, their arguments are π/16 apart.\n\nTherefore, the polygon is a regular quadrilateral? Wait, but the circle they lie on isn't centered at the origin, it's centered at -i. But regardless, as points in the plane, they form a regular quadrilateral, i.e., a square.\n\nWait, but a square has four sides of equal length and equal angles between consecutive vertices. But since the polygon is convex and the points are equally spaced in angle around a circle, it is a regular quadrilateral, which is a square. So, the polygon is a square.\n\nTherefore,"

The radius is 2^{1/8}, so the diameter is 2^{1/8 +1} = 2^{9/8}. The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circumscribed circle. For a square, the diagonal is s√2, where s is the side length. Therefore, s√2 = 2^{9/8}, so s = 2^{9/8} / √2 = 2^{9/8} / 2^{1/2} = 2^{(9/8 - 4/8)} = 2^{5/8}.\n\nTherefore, the area is s^2 = (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{10/8} = 2^{5/4} = 2^{1.25} = 2^{5/4}.\n\nAlternatively, since the area of a square can also be calculated as (diagonal^2)/2. So, ( (2^{9/8})^2 ) / 2 = (2^{9/4}) / 2 = 2^{9/4 -1} = 2^{5/4}, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^{5/4}, which is equal to 2^{5/4}. So, in the form p^{a/b}, p is 2, a is 5, b is 4. Since 5 and 4 are coprime, and 2 is prime, so that's the form. Therefore, a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is the polygon actually a square?

Hence, the polygon is indeed a regular quadrilateral, i.e., a square.\n\nThus, the area is 2^{5/4}.\n\nBut wait, I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything here. The center is at -i, which is not the origin, but when calculating the area of the polygon, does the center matter? No, the area is determined purely by the positions of the four vertices, regardless of where the polygon is placed in the plane.\n\nSo, the four vertices are equally spaced on the circle of radius 2^{1/8}, so yes, it's a square with area (diagonal)^2 / 2 = (2^{9/4})^2 / 2. Wait, no, wait, the diagonal is 2^{9/8}, as the diameter is 2 * 2^{1/8} = 2^{9/8}.\n\nWait, I think I confused the steps before. Let me correct that.\n\nThe radius is 2^{1/8}, so the diameter is 2 * 2^{1/8} = 2^{9/8}. For a square inscribed in a circle of radius r, the diagonal is 2r. So, the diagonal is 2^{9/8}, and for a square, the diagonal is s√2, where s is the side length.\n\nSo,  s√2 = 2^{9/8} ⇒ s = (2^{9/8}) / √2 = 2^{9/8} * 2^{-1/2} = 2^{(9/8 - 4/8)} = 2^{5/8}.\n\nThus, the area is s^2 = (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{10/8} = 2^{5/4}. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since each side of the square subtends an angle of 90 degrees (π/2) at the center, and the radius is 2^{1/8}, we can compute the length of each side via the chord length formula: chord length = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle.\n\nSo, chord length = 2 * 2^{1/8} * sin(π/4) = 2^{9"

Since all the roots are points on a circle centered at -i, so the polygon is a square rotated and shifted from the origin. But the area is purely a function of the side length, so shifting doesn't affect the area. So, the area is indeed 2^{5/4}.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 11. Hmm, but let me see if there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, another way to think about this: the roots are the fourth roots of (1 + i) shifted by -i. Since (z + i)^4 = 1 + i, so the roots are the fourth roots of 1 + i, then subtracted by i. The fourth roots of 1 + i are equally spaced around a circle of radius |1 + i|^{1/4} = (sqrt(2))^{1/4} = 2^{1/8}, which matches the radius we had before. So, the roots are equally spaced on that circle, so forming a square. So, the area is as calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute coordinates of the four points and compute the area using coordinates.\n\nLet me try that to verify.\n\nLet me compute each root z as:\n\nz = -i + 2^{1/8} [ cosθ + i sinθ ]\n\nSo, writing each z as a complex number, which corresponds to the point (x, y) where:\n\nx = 2^{1/8} cosθ,\n\ny = -1 + 2^{1/8} sinθ.\n\nSo, let's compute coordinates for each k=0,1,2,3.\n\nFirst, compute θ for each k:\n\nθ0 = π/16,\n\nθ1 ="

So, their coordinates can be represented as (2^{1/8} cos θ, -1 + 2^{1/8} sin θ). To compute the area of the polygon, one approach is to use the shoelace formula once all coordinates are known.\n\nBut maybe there's a symmetry or a formula that can be used without computing each coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, since the polygon is a square, the area can be computed as (side length)^2, which we've already found as 2^{5/4}.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the shoelace formula, the polygon is a square, so the area should come out the same.\n\nBut for thoroughness, let me compute coordinates for at least two of the points to see if the side length matches.\n\nCompute for k=0:\n\nθ0 = π/16,\n\ncos(π/16) and sin(π/16).

We approximated the side length as about 1.543.\n\nBut let's find it exactly.\n\nEarlier, we saw that the side length s is 2^{5/8}, so s^2 is 2^{5/4}.\n\nAlternatively, compute s using the chord length formula: chord length = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is π/2.\n\nThus, chord length s = 2 * 2^{1/8} * sin(π/4) = 2^{9/8} * (√2 / 2 ) = 2^{9/8} * 2^{-1/2} = 2^{5/8}.\n\nSo, s =2^{5/8}, so area is (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4}.\n\nThus, the area is 2^{5/4}, so expressed as p^{a/b}, p=2, a=5, b=4, which are coprime. Thus, a + b + p = 5 + 4 +2=11.\n\nHence, the answer is 11.\n</think>\n\nThe given equation \\( z^4 + 4iz^3 - 6z^2 - 4iz - i = 0 \\) can be rewritten as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).
