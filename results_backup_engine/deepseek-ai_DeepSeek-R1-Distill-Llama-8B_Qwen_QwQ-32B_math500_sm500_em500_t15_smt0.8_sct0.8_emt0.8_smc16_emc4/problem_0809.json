            "output": "Alright, so I've got this polynomial problem to solve. Let me see if I can figure it out. The polynomial is given as f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0. They told me that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. Also, the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. The task is to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|.\n\nHmm, okay. So, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, by the Integer Root Theorem, the roots must be divisors of a_0, which is 66. That means the possible roots are the factors of 66. Let me list them out. The factors of 66 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66. These are the possible integer roots.\n\nNow, the polynomial is monic if we consider a_n = 2. Wait, no, actually, a_n is 2, so it's not monic. If I factor the polynomial, it would be something like f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_k), where each r_i is an integer root. Since all roots are integers, each (x - r_i) term is a linear factor with integer coefficients. When I expand this, the leading coefficient will be 2 because the first term is a_n = 2.\n\nGiven that, when I expand 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_k), the constant term will be 2*(-1)^k*(r_1r_2...r_k) = a_0 = 66. So that gives me 2*(-1)^k*(product of roots) = 66. So, the product of roots is 66 / [2*(-1)^k]. Depending on k, it can be positive or negative. But since 66 is positive, and 2 is positive, the product of the roots would be positive if k is even because (-1)^k would be positive, or negative if k is odd. Wait, but 66 is positive, so 2*(product of roots)*(-1)^k = 66."

Let me rearrange that: product of roots is 66 / [2*(-1)^k]. \n\nHmm, so the product of the roots is either 66/(2*(-1)^k). Since the product has to be an integer (because coefficients are integers and roots are integers, the product is an integer). Let me think again. Let me write it as product of roots = 66 / [2*(-1)^k]. Since 66 divided by 2 is 33, so it's 33 / (-1)^k. So product of roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of k. Because if k is even, (-1)^k is 1, so 33. If k is odd, (-1)^k is -1, so -33. \n\nTherefore, the product of the roots must be either 33 or -33. Since the roots are distinct integers, I need to find a set of distinct integers (factors of 66 or their negatives) whose product is either 33 or -33, and then determine the minimal |a_{n-1}|, which is the absolute value of the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the polynomial f(x). \n\nThe coefficient a_{n-1} is related to the sum of the roots. Wait, let me recall Vieta's formula. For a monic polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is the negative of the sum of the roots. But in our case, the leading coefficient is 2, so the polynomial is 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_k). Let me see. Expanding that, the polynomial would be 2x^k - 2*(r1 + r2 + ... + rk)x^{k-1} + ... + constants. Wait, more precisely, Vieta's formula for a polynomial f(x) = a_nx^n + ... + a_0, the sum of the roots (with sign) is -a_{n-1}/a_n. But since the roots are r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, the sum is -a_{n-1}/2. Therefore, a_{n-1"

So, to minimize |sum of the roots|, while ensuring that all roots are distinct integers, the product of roots is either 33 or -33, and all roots are divisors of 66.\n\nSo, let's think about the factorizations of 33 and -33 into distinct integers.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 33. 33 can be written as 1*33, 3*11. Those are the positive factorizations into distinct integers. The negative factorizations would include negative numbers: for example, (-1)*(-33) = 33, (-3)*(-11)=33, but since we need distinct roots, we can also have, for example, 1*(-33) = -33, but here we would have two roots, 1 and -33, whose product is -33. Wait, actually, 33 has both positive and negative factors. Hmm, but actually, in our case, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the number of roots.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think. The product of the roots is 33 or -33. So, we can have different combinations:\n\nCase 1: Product is 33. So, k is even (because 33 = 33 / (-1)^k, which would mean if k is even, (-1)^k is 1, so product is 33). Similarly, if k is odd, product is -33.\n\nSo, first, let's consider the case where the product is 33. So, 33 as a product of distinct integers. The possible integer pairs (or more) multiplying to 33 with distinct factors.\n\n33 is 1*3*11. So, that's the prime factorization. So, the possible sets of roots could be:\n\n- 1, 3, 11. That's three roots, their product is 33, and they are distinct integers.\n\nAlternatively, we could have other factorizations with more roots, but since 33 is 1*3*11, the only way to have more roots is by introducing 1s and -1s,"

Let's see.\n\nWait, actually, the roots don't have to be factors of 33, they just need to multiply to 33. Since 33 has prime factors 3 and 11, plus 1 and itself. So any factors must be divisors of 33. So, possible factors are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33.\n\nSo, possible factorizations into distinct integers:\n\n- Three integers: 1, 3, 11.\n\n- Two integers: 3 and 11, but their product is 33, but since they are distinct.

Wait, but if the product is 33, then the factors have to multiply to 33, so maybe three positive numbers or an even number of negative numbers.\n\nSo, for product +33:\n\nPossible factors can be:\n\nThree positive: 1,3,11\n\nOr two negative numbers and one positive, but since the product would be negative* negative *positive= positive. So, such as -1, -3, -11 would give -33. Wait, that's not the case.\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose I have three factors:\n\nTo get a positive product (33), either all three are positive, or one positive and two negative. Let me see:\n\nSo, for three factors:\n\nEither all positive: 1,3,11 (product 33)\n\nOr one positive and two negative:\n\nFor example: Let's say (-1)*(-3)*11 = 33. So roots would be -1, -3, 11.

But wait, is 1 repeated? No, 1 is only once. Wait, no, again, the numbers have to be distinct.\n\nWait, so 33 as a product over four factors with distinct integers: let's see. 33 can be written as 1* (-1)*3* (-11). So, roots would be 1, -1, 3, -11. Product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11) = 33. So yes, that is another possibility.

Let me consider that.\n\nSo, perhaps there are other combinations with more factors, like 1, 3, 11, but also 2 or 6, but their product must be 33.\n\nWait, 33 is prime factors 3 and 11, so if you include 2 as a root, then the product would be even, but 33 is odd. So 2 cannot be a root in a set where the product is 33. Similarly for 6,22, etc. So, to have the product of roots as 33 or -33 (product 33 needs all roots odd; because 33 is odd, so all roots must be odd to multiply to an odd product). So, the roots must be odd numbers since 33 is odd. So, even numbers cannot be roots in that case. \n\nWait, yes, if the product is odd, then all roots must be odd. Because if any root were even, the product would be even. So for the case of product 33 (which is odd), all roots must be odd divisors of 66, so among ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33. Similarly, for product -33 (which is -odd), the roots can have even, but the product's oddness still requires all roots are odd.\n\nTherefore, in the product 33 case, roots must be odd divisors. So roots can only be ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33. So, that restricts the possible roots to just those eight numbers. Therefore, when forming the roots for the product, they have to be among those.\n\nTherefore, for example, even with four roots, they have to be among these.\n\nSo, the prior consideration was correct, but I had forgotten that 2 is not allowed as a root in product 33 case.\n\nTherefore, proceeding again.\n\nFirst, Case 1: product =33 (even number of roots). The minimal |sum|.\n\nPossible roots:\n\nThree roots (but three is odd, so can't). Wait, k must be even. So minimal even number of roots is 2.\n\nWait, let me note here: the minimal number of roots would be 2 (if possible). Let's see.\n\nFor product 33 with"
