These circles divide the plane into regions based on their radii.\n\nStarting from the smallest circle with a radius of 4, the first region, X, is the area between this circle and the next one with a radius of 6. So, the area of region X is the area of the circle with radius 6 minus the area of the circle with radius 4.\n\nNext, region Y is between the circles with radii 6 and 7. Therefore, the area of region Y is the area of the circle with radius 7 minus the area of the circle with radius 6.\n\nFinally, region Z is the area of the largest circle with radius 7, as there are no outer circles to define its outer boundary.\n\nBy calculating these areas, I can identify the largest and smallest regions among X, Y, and Z. Then, I will find the difference between their areas.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest regions labeled \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\), let's analyze the diagram step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Three concentric circles** with radii of 4, 6, and 7.\n- **Regions:**\n  - \\(X\\): Between the circle of radius 6 and 4.\n  - \\(Y\\): Between the circle of radius 7 and 6.\n  - \\(Z\\): The area inside the circle of radius 4.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Area of a Circle:** \\( \\text{Area} = \\pi r^2 \\).\n\n2. **Area of Region \\(X\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_X = \\pi (6)^2 - \\pi (4)^2 = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Area of Region \\(Y\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_Y = \\pi (7)^2 - \\pi (6)^2 = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n   \\]\n\n4. **Area of Region \\(Z\\):**\n   \\[\n"
