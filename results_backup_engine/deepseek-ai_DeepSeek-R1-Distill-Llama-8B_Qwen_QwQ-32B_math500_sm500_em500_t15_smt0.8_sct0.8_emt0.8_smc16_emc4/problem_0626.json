            "output": "Alright, so I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt[(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2]. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. First, since it's a square root function, the expression inside the square root, which is (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2, must be greater than or equal to zero. Otherwise, we'd be taking the square root of a negative number, which isn't a real number. So, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x such that (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 ≥ 0.\n\nAlright, so my first task is to solve this inequality: (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 ≥ 0. To do that, I should probably expand both squares and then simplify the expression. Let's start by expanding both (x-3)^2 and (x-8)^2.\n\nExpanding (x-3)^2:\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nExpanding (x-8)^2:\n(x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64.\n\nNow, subtract (x-8)^2 from (x-3)^2:\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) = ?\n\nLet me subtract term by term:\nx^2 - x^2 = 0\n-6x - (-16x) = -6x + 16x = 10x\n9 - 64 = -55\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to 10x - 55. Therefore, the inequality becomes:\n10x - 55 ≥ 0.\n\nNow, solving for x:\n10x - 55 ≥ 0\nAdd 55 to both sides: 10x ≥ 55\nDivide both sides by 10: x ≥ 55/10\nSimplify the fraction: x ≥ 5.5\n\nSo, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to 5.5. Now, the question asks for the smallest real number x in the domain. Since the domain starts at 5.5 and includes all numbers larger than that, the smallest"

            "output": " x is 5.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I expanded the squares correctly. Let me verify:\n\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 -6x +9 and (x - 8)^2 = x^2 -16x +64. Subtracting, we get (x^2 -6x +9) - (x^2 -16x +64) = x^2 -6x +9 -x^2 +16x -64. Yes, that simplifies to 10x -55. So, the expression inside the square root is 10x -55, and setting that greater than or equal to zero gives x ≥ 5.5. So, yeah, the smallest x is 5.5.\n\nI think that's correct. Alternatively, since the function is a square root, I could also think about whether the expression inside can be factored or simplified differently. Let me try factoring:\n\nThe expression is (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Wait, that looks like a difference of squares, which can be factored as (A)^2 - (B)^2 = (A - B)(A + B).\n\nSo, let me set A = x - 3 and B = x - 8. Then:\n\n(A)^2 - (B)^2 = (A - B)(A + B)\n\nCompute A - B: (x - 3) - (x - 8) = x -3 -x +8 = 5.\n\nCompute A + B: (x -3) + (x -8) = 2x -11.\n\nSo, the expression becomes 5*(2x -11). Therefore, (x -3)^2 - (x -8)^2 = 5*(2x -11). So, the inequality is 5*(2x -11) ≥ 0.\n\nDividing both sides by 5 (since 5 is positive, inequality remains same): 2x -11 ≥ 0.\n\nSolving: 2x ≥ 11; x ≥ 11/2 = 5.5.\n\nSame result as before. So, this method also gives x ≥ 5.5, confirming the earlier result. Therefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5, which is"

            "output": " 11/2. Since the question asks for the smallest real number, and 5.5 is the lower bound of the domain, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me plug in x = 5.5 into the original expression to see if it works.\n\nCompute (5.5 -3)^2 - (5.5 -8)^2.\n\nFirst term: (2.5)^2 = 6.25\n\nSecond term: (-2.5)^2 = 6.25\n\nSo, 6.25 - 6.25 = 0. So sqrt(0) = 0, which is valid. So x=5.5 is indeed in the domain.\n\nWhat if I pick a number less than 5.5, like 5?\n\n(5 -3)^2 - (5 -8)^2 = (2)^2 - (-3)^2 = 4 -9 = -5. Then sqrt(-5) is not real, so that's excluded. So yes, 5.5 is the smallest x where the expression inside sqrt is zero, so that's the minimum x in the domain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.5, which is 11/2. Since the problem asks for the smallest real number, and in boxed form, probably as a fraction. Let me see, 11/2 is 5.5, so either way is fine, but maybe they prefer fractions. Let me check the question again. It says \"smallest real number\", so either form is acceptable, but boxed as \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}} or \\boxed{5.5}. Hmm, in math problems, fractions are often preferred over decimals unless specified otherwise. So I'll go with 11/2.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Let me see if there's any possible mistake here. The key steps were expanding the squares and simplifying. Alternatively, factoring as difference of squares. Both methods led to the same result, so I think that's solid. The critical point is that the expression inside the square root simplifies to 10x -55, which is linear, so the inequality is straightforward. The domain is x ≥ 5.5, so the minimal x is 5.5. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about"
