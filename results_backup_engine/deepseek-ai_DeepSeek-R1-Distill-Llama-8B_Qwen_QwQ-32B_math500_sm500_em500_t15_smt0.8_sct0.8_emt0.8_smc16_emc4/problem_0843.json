Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that when dealing with functions of two variables, especially when trying to find maxima or minima, calculus is usually involved. I remember that for functions of one variable, we can use derivatives to find critical points. But since this is a function of two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I think I need to use partial derivatives instead. I hope I remember that correctly.\n\nSo, the function is \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). I need to find its maximum value. To do this, I should probably find the critical points by setting the partial derivatives equal to zero and then determine which of those points gives the maximum value.\n\nLet me recall how to compute partial derivatives. For a function \\(f(x, y)\\), the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\) is found by treating \\(y\\) as a constant, and vice versa. So, I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, I'll compute the partial derivative of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{(-1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4y^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSo, to find critical points, both of these partial derivatives should be zero. That means the numerators of both fractions must be zero. So, I can set up two equations:\n\n1. \\( (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3) = 0 \\)\n2. \\( - (x^4 + y^4 + "

Solving them simultaneously seems really hard. Maybe there's a smarter way or perhaps we can spot a symmetry or substitution.\n\nWait a second, maybe we can set up some ratio between the two equations.

Maybe if I set \\(y = -x + c\\) for some constant \\(c\\), but that might not necessarily help. Alternatively, perhaps set \\(y = x + d\\), but this is getting a bit unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps try setting \\(x = y + h\\), but that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case where either \\(x = 0\\) or \\(y = 0\\) because sometimes maxima or minima lie on the boundaries.\n\nLet me test that idea. So, suppose \\(x = 0\\):\n\nThen, the function becomes \\(\\frac{0 - y}{0 + y^4 + 6} = \\frac{-y}{y^4 + 6}\\). We can find its maximum value.
