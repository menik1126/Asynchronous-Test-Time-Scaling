A trailing zero is produced by multiplying 2 and 5 together because 2 × 5 = 10.\n\nTo find the number of such pairs in 42!, I'll count the number of factors of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization.\n\nStarting with the number of 5s:\nI divide 42 by 5 to find how many multiples of 5 are there. 42 ÷ 5 = 8.4, so there are 8 factors of 5.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 2s:\nI divide 42 by 2 to find how many multiples of 2 are there. 42 ÷ 2 = 21, so there are 21 factors of 2.\n\nEach pair of 2 and 5 contributes to one trailing zero. Since there are more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, 42! ends with 8 trailing zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeros are at the end of \\(42!\\) (42 factorial), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   \n   The number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in that number. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, the number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\).\n\n2. **Count the Number of 5s:**\n   \n   - Divide 42 by 5: \\(42 ÷ 5 = 8\\) (since \\(5 × 8 = 40\\) and there's a remainder of 2).\n   - This means there are **8** factors of 5 in \\(42!\\).\n\n3. **Count the Number of 2s:**\n   \n   - Divide 42 by 2: \\(42 ÷ 2 = 21\\) (since \\(2 × 21 = 42\\)).\n   - Divide the result by 2 again: \\(21 ÷ 2 = 10\\) (since \\(2 × 10 = 20\\) and there's a remainder of 1).\n   - Add the results: \\(10 + 10 = 21\\) (since there are"
