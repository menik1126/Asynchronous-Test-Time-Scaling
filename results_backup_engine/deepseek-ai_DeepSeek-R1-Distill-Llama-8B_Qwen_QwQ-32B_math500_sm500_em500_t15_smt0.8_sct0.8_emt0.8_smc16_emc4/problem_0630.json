Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst off, since it's a square root function, whatever is inside the square root, which is the expression under the root, or the radicand, has to be greater than or equal to zero. That makes sense because you can't have a square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, the first condition I have is that (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 ≥ 0.\n\nAlright, so I need to solve this inequality: (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 ≥ 0. Hmm, okay, this looks like a difference of squares. Remember, the difference of squares formula is a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me let a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). So, then (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 becomes (a)^2 - (b)^2, which factors into (a - b)(a + b). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, (a - b) = (x - 3) - (x - 8) = x - 3 - x + 8 = (x - x) + (-3 + 8) = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nAnd (a + b) = (x - 3) + (x - 8) = x - 3 + x - 8 = 2x - 11.\n\nSo, putting that together, the expression becomes 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this inequality: 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0. Since 5 is a positive number, it doesn't affect the inequality's direction, so I can divide both sides by 5, which gives me 2x - 11 ≥ 0.\n\nThen, adding 11 to both sides: 2x - 11 + 11 ≥ 0 → 2x ≥ 0.\n\nDividing both sides by 2: x ≥ 0.\n\nSo, the expression inside the square root"

            "output": " is greater than or equal to zero when x is greater than or equal to zero. Therefore, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x such that x ≥ 0.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If x is 0, let's plug it in: (0 - 3)^2 - (0 - 8)^2 = (-3)^2 - (-8)^2 = 9 - 64 = -55. Hmm, that's negative. So, wait, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nOh no, I must have messed up the factoring part. Let me go back. So, the original expression is (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Let me compute this without factoring to see what's going on.\n\nCompute (x - 3)^2: that's x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nCompute (x - 8)^2: that's x^2 - 16x + 64.\n\nSubtract them: (x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) = x^2 -6x +9 -x^2 +16x -64.\n\nSimplify: (x^2 - x^2) + (-6x +16x) + (9 -64) = 0 + 10x -55.\n\nSo, the expression inside the square root simplifies to 10x - 55. Therefore, the inequality is 10x -55 ≥ 0.\n\nAdding 55 to both sides: 10x ≥ 55.\n\nDividing both sides by 10: x ≥ 55/10 → x ≥ 5.5.\n\nAh, okay, so my factoring approach gave me x ≥ 0, which was wrong because when I plug in x=0, it's negative. So, I must have messed up the factoring step. Let me try that again.\n\nWait, in the difference of squares, I thought a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8), which is correct. So, (a - b) = (x -3) - (x -8) = (x -3 -x +8) = 5, which is correct. Then (a + b) = (x -3 + x -"

            "output": "8) = 2x -11. So, that's correct too. So, 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0.\n\nBut 5*(2x -11) ≥ 0 implies that 2x -11 ≥ 0. So, 2x ≥ 11 → x ≥ 11/2, which is 5.5. So, in my initial calculation, I thought that (a - b) was 5 and (a + b) is 2x -11, which is correct, but in my first check, I set x=0, which is less than 5.5, so it's not in the domain. So, wait, why did I think x=0 earlier? That was a mistake.\n\nSo, I think the correct solution is x ≥ 5.5, right? Because when x = 5.5, 10x -55 = 55 -55 = 0, which is allowed. And for x greater than 5.5, it's positive. For x less than 5.5, it's negative, which isn't allowed. So, the domain is [5.5, ∞).\n\nSo, the smallest real number x in the domain of g(x) is 5.5, which is 11/2. Therefore, the answer is 11/2 or 5.5.\n\nWait, but 5.5 is a decimal, is the question expecting a fraction? Probably better to write it as a fraction, 11/2.\n\nBut let me double-check everything because earlier I thought the expression was (x - 3)^2 - (x -8)^2, which we expanded to 10x -55. So, 10x -55 ≥ 0 → x ≥ 5.5. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve (x-3)^2 - (x -8)^2 ≥ 0 by taking square roots or considering the expressions, but expanding seems straightforward and correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute this expression for x values to see where it becomes positive. Let me try x=5.5: (5.5 -3)^2 - (5.5 -8)^2 = (2.5)^2 - (-2.5)^2 = 6.25 - 6.25 = 0. So that's correct.\n\nWhat about"

So, indeed, the domain starts at 5.5.\n\nTherefore, the smallest real number in the domain is 5.5, which is 11/2. So, the answer should be 11/2.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other constraints. The function is sqrt of that expression, so the only constraint is the radicand must be non-negative, so yes, that's the only condition. So, the domain is x ≥ 11/2, so the minimal x is 11/2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 11/2, which in boxed form is \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as \\boxed{5.5}, but fractions are usually preferred in such contexts unless specified otherwise. Since the problem says \"real number,\" either is okay, but fractions are exact. So, 11/2 is better.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me see the expansion again:\n\n(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 = (x² -6x +9) - (x² -16x +64) = x² -6x +9 -x² +16x -64 = (x² -x²) + (-6x +16x) + (9 -64) = 10x -55. Yep, that's correct. So, 10x -55 ≥0 → 10x ≥55 → x ≥55/10 → 11/2. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal x is 11/2. So, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest real number in the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the"
