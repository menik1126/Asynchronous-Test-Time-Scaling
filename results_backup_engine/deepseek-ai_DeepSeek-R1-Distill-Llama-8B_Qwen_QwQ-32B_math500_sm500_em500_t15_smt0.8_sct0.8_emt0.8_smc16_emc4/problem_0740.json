            "output": "I start with the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\). First, I calculate \\(2^3\\), which equals 8. This simplifies the equation to \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate \\(3^x\\). This gives me \\(3^x = 72 / 8\\), which simplifies to \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nSince \\(9\\) is equal to \\(3^2\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(3^x = 3^2\\). \n\nFinally, I recognize that if the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) for which \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify \\( 2^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 8 to isolate \\( 3^x \\):**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   So, the equation now is:\n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
