The equation provided is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nAnd it's said that this holds for all real values of x except -8 and 3, which makes sense because those would make the denominators zero, causing division by zero errors.\n\nHmm, so what's the approach here? I remember that when you have an equation involving fractions like this, one way to solve for the unknowns (which are C and D in this case) is to combine the left-hand side (LHS) into a single fraction and then equate the numerators since the denominators must already be the same. That way, I can set the numerators equal and solve for C and D.\n\nAlright, so let's try that. The denominators on the LHS are (x - 3) and (x + 8), so the common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). So, I need to rewrite each fraction with this common denominator.\n\nFor the first fraction, C/(x - 3), to get the denominator to (x - 3)(x + 8), I need to multiply both numerator and denominator by (x + 8). Similarly, for the second fraction, D/(x + 8), I multiply numerator and denominator by (x - 3).\n\nSo, putting that together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x + 8)(x - 3)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait, I notice that the denominator on the RHS is x² + 5x - 24. Let me factor that to see if it matches the common denominator. Let me see if I can factor x² + 5x - 24.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to +5. Hmm, 8 and -3: 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-"

Great, so the denominators on both sides are the same, which means the numerators must be equal for all x except -8 and 3.\n\nSo, combining the LHS:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are equal, we can set the numerators equal:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nSo, expanding the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nThat gives us two equations by equating coefficients of like terms:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables (C and D). Let's write them down:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nWe can solve this system using substitution or elimination. I think substitution will be straightforward here.\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can express D in terms of C:\n\nD = 4 - C\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 2:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet's expand that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8C + 3C) - 12 = -23\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, substitute C back into Equation 1 to find D:\n\n-1 + D = 4\nD = 4 + 1\nD = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is "
