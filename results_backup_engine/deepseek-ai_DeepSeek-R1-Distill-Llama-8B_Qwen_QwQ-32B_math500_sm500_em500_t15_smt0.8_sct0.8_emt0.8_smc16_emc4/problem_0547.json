Since there are two countries with 12 cents each and one country with 6 cents, I calculate the total number of stamps in the 70s by counting them.\n\nThere are 2 countries with 12 cents each and 1 country with 6 cents, making a total of 3 countries in the 70s group. Each country has a certain number of stamps, but since the exact number isn't specified, I'll assume that the prices provided correspond to the number of stamps he bought in each country during the 70s.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total cost for the 70s stamps by multiplying each country's price by the assumed number of stamps and then summing them up.\n\nFor Brazil: 12 cents × 1 stamp = 12 cents\nFor France: 12 cents × 1 stamp = 12 cents\nFor Peru: 12 cents × 1 stamp = 12 cents\nFor Spain: 6 cents × 1 stamp = 6 cents\n\nAdding these together, the total cost for the 70s stamps is 12 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 42 cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per stamp in the 70s, I divide the total cost by the total number of stamps. So, the average price is 42 cents divided by 3 stamps, which equals 14 cents per stamp.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price per stamp for Juan's 70s stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices and Countries:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\$12 per stamp\n   - **France:** \\$12 per stamp\n   - **Peru:** \\$12 per stamp\n   - **Spain:** \\$6 per stamp\n\n2. **Total Number of Stamps in the 70s:**\n   - Since the chart doesn't specify the exact number of stamps per country, we'll assume each country has 1 stamp for simplicity.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost for the 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = (12 + 12 + 12 + 6) \\text{ cents}"

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
