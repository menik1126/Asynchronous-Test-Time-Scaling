            "output": "First, I need to understand the relationships between Trinkets, Blinkets, and Drinkets. I know that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, which means each Trinket can be converted into 4 smaller units called Blinkets.\n\nNext, I have to convert Drinkets into Blinkets. The problem states that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. This means that each Drinket is worth a fraction of a Blinket. To find out how many Blinkets a Drinket is worth, I'll divide 3 by 7, resulting in 3/7 Blinkets per Drinket.\n\nNow, I want to find out how many Trinkets 56 Drinkets are worth. Since 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, I can multiply the number of Blinkets obtained from 56 Drinkets by 1/4 to convert Blinkets back to Trinkets. So, I'll multiply 56 by 3/7 to get the total number of Blinkets and then multiply that by 1/4 to find the equivalent number in Trinkets.\n\nFinally, after performing the calculations, I'll round the Trinket value to determine the exact number of Trinkets that 56 Drinkets equal.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. \\(1 \\text{ Trinket} = 4 \\text{ Blinkets}\\)\n2. \\(3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets}\\)\n\n**We need to find:** How much is \\(56 \\text{ Drinkets}\\) in terms of Trinkets.\n\n**Step 1:** Find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to 1 Drinket.\n\\[\n3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets} \\\\\n1 \\text{ Drinket} = \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the total number of Blinkets in 56 Drinkets.\n\\[\n56 \\text{ Drinkets} \\times \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets per Drinket} = 24 \\text{ Blinkets}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Convert Blinkets to Trinkets using the conversion rate.\n\\[\n24 \\text{ Blinkets} \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ Trinket per Blink"
