            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. I remember that for polynomial equations, especially ones with integer coefficients, the Rational Root Theorem might be helpful. The Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(p/q\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nIn this equation, the leading coefficient is 1, since the \\(x^4\\) term has a coefficient of 1. That means the denominator \\(q\\) in any rational root would have to be 1, so all possible rational roots are integers that divide the constant term, which is -14. \n\nSo, the possible integer roots are the factors of -14. Let me list those out. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14, and considering the negative counterparts, the possible integer roots are: \\(1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14\\). \n\nNow, I need to test each of these possible roots to see if they satisfy the equation. I'll start by testing the smaller integers first, maybe 1 and -1, because they are quick to compute.\n\nLet's try \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1 + 5) + (9 - 1) - 14 = 6 + 8 - 14 = 14 - 14 = 0\\). Hey, that works! So, \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n\nNext, let's try \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14\\). Calculating this step by step: 1 - 5 is -4, plus 9 is 5, plus 1 is 6, minus 14 is -8. So,"

            "output": " it's not zero. Therefore, \\(x = -1\\) is not a root.\n\nMoving on to \\(x = 2\\):\n\\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14\\). Calculating: 16 + 40 is 56, plus 36 is 92, minus 2 is 90, minus 14 is 76. That's not zero, so \\(x = 2\\) isn't a root.\n\nHow about \\(x = -2\\):\n\\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) - 14\\). Let's compute each term: \\(16 + 5*(-8) + 9*4 + 2 - 14\\). That is, \\(16 - 40 + 36 + 2 -14\\). Calculating step by step: 16 - 40 is -24, plus 36 is 12, plus 2 is 14, minus 14 is 0. Wow, \\(x = -2\\) is also a root.\n\nGreat, so now I have two roots: 1 and -2. Since it's a quartic equation, there should be four roots, but they might not all be integers. But I'm supposed to find all integer roots, so let's continue.\n\nNext, try \\(x = 7\\):\n\\(7^4 + 5*7^3 + 9*7^2 - 7 - 14\\). Calculating each term:\n\\(7^4 = 2401\\)\n\\(5*7^3 = 5*343 = 1715\\)\n\\(9*7^2 = 9*49 = 441\\)\nNow, adding these up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116, plus 441 is 4557. Then subtract 7: 4557 -7 = 4550, minus 14 is 4536. That's definitely not zero, so \\(x =7\\) isn't a root.\n\nHow about \\(x = -7\\):\n\\((-7)^4 +5*(-7)^3 +9*(-7)^2 - (-7) -14\\)\nCalculates to: 2401 + 5*(-343) +"

Not zero, so \\(x = -7\\) isn't a root.\n\nNext up, \\(x =14\\):\n\\(14^4\\) is a big number, let me compute: \\(14^2 = 196\\), so \\(14^4 = 196^2 = 38416\\)\n\\(5*14^3 = 5*2744 = 13720\\)\n\\(9*14^2 = 9*196 = 1764\\)\nNow, sum all terms: 38416 +13720 = 52136, plus 1764 is 53900. Subtract 14: 53886, minus 14: 53872.

Then +14 -14 cancels out, so 26460. Not zero.\n\nSo, of all the possible integer candidates, only \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\) satisfy the equation.\n\nWait, but quartic equations can have up to four roots. Since I have two integer roots already, maybe the equation factors into two quadratics, one with these roots, and another quadratic with non-integer roots. Let me check if I can factor the polynomial using these roots.\n\nIf \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\) are roots, then the polynomial is divisible by \\((x - 1)(x + 2)\\). Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.\n\nUsing synthetic division for root \\(x =1\\):\n\nThe coefficients are 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 ("

Now, let's factor the cubic polynomial \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\).\n\nAgain, using the Rational Root Theorem on the cubic. Possible roots are factors of 14: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, etc.\n\nTest \\(x= -1\\) on cubic: (-1)^3 +6*(-1)^2 +15*(-1) +14 = -1 +6 -15 +14 = (-1 +6) + (-15 +14) = 5 -1 =4 ≠0\n\nTest \\(x= -2\\): (-2)^3 +6*(-2)^2 +15*(-2) +14 = -8 +24 -30 +14 = (-8 +24) + (-30 +14)=16 -16=0. So, \\(x = -2\\) is another root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor out another \\((x + 2)\\) from the cubic.\n\nUsing synthetic division on the cubic \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\) with root \\(x=-2\\):\n\n-2 | 1  6   15   14\n           -2   -8   -14\n        -----------------\n          1  4    7     0\n\nSo, the cubic factors into \\((x + 2)(x^2 +4x +7)\\).
