Given that the radius of the tank is 6 cm, the volume becomes \\((4/3)\\pi (6)^3 = 144\\pi \\text{ cm}^3\\).\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\(\\pi r^2 h\\). With a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm, the volume is \\(\\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\text{ cm}^3\\).\n\nFinally, I'll divide the total volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker to find out how many beakers are needed. So, \\(144\\pi / 72\\pi = 2\\). Therefore, it takes 2 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Given the radius \\( r = 6 \\) cm:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 144\\pi \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n   Given the radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm and height \\( h = 8 \\) cm:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{beaker}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\text{ cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Beakers Needed**\n\n   To find out how many beakers are needed to"
