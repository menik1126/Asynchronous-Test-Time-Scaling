            "output": "I need to determine the number of boys attending the math club meeting given that there are 35 students in total, the number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys.\n\nFirst, I'll let \\( g \\) represent the number of girls. Since the number of girls is a multiple of 13, I can express this as \\( g = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nNext, I'll let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys. The total number of students is 35, so I can write the equation \\( g + b = 35 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( g = 13k \\) into the equation gives \\( 13k + b = 35 \\). To find \\( b \\), I'll solve for it: \\( b = 35 - 13k \\).\n\nSince there are more girls than boys, the number of girls must be greater than half of the total number of students. Therefore, \\( g > \\frac{35}{2} \\) which simplifies to \\( 13k > 17.5 \\). Dividing both sides by 13, I get \\( k > 1.346 \\). This means the smallest possible integer value for \\( k \\) is 2.\n\nSubstituting \\( k = 2 \\) into \\( g = 13k \\) gives \\( g = 26 \\). Then, \\( b = 35 - 26 = 9 \\).\n\nI'll double-check if \\( k = 3 \\) gives a valid solution. For \\( k = 3 \\), \\( g = 39 \\), which exceeds the total number of students, so \\( k = 3 \\) is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is when \\( k = 2 \\), resulting in 9 boys attending the meeting.\n</think>\n\nNumber of boys at the meeting is \\boxed{9}."
