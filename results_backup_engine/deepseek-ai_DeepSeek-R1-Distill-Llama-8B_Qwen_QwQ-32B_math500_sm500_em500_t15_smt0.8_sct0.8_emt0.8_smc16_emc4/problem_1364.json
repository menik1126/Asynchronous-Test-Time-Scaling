Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys attending the meeting, and \\( g \\) represent the number of girls.\n\nNext, we know that the total number of students is 35, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ b + g = 35 \\]\n\nWe're also told that the number of girls is a multiple of 13, so \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13. Additionally, there are more girls than boys attending the meeting, which means \\( g > b \\).\n\nNow, let's list the multiples of 13 that are less than 35: 13, 26.\n\nIf \\( g = 13 \\), then \\( b = 35 - 13 = 22 \\). However, this doesn't satisfy the condition \\( g > b \\) because 13 is not greater than 22.\n\nNext, let's try \\( g = 26 \\). Then, \\( b = 35 - 26 = 9 \\). Here, 26 is greater than 9, so this satisfies the condition.\n\nSince 26 is the only multiple of 13 that meets all the given conditions, the number of boys at the meeting must be 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let \\( b \\) = number of boys\n- Let \\( g \\) = number of girls\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**\nWe know the total number of students is 35:\n\\[ b + g = 35 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Conditions**\n1. The number of girls is a multiple of 13: \\( g = 13k \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n2. There are more girls than boys: \\( g > b \\).\n\n**Step 4: Determine Possible Values for \\( g \\)**\nSince \\( g \\) must be a multiple of 13 and less than 35:\n- Possible values for \\( g \\): 13, 26\n\n**Step 5: Test Each Possible Value of \\( g \\)**\n- **For \\( g = 13 \\):**\n  \\[ b = 35 - 13 = 22 \\]\n  - Check if \\( g > b \\): \\( 13 > 22 \\) → **False**\n\n- **For \\( g = 26 \\):**\n  \\"
