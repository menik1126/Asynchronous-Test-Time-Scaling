            "output": "First, I need to find the speed of the robot. The problem states that it takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer.\n\nTo find the speed in meters per second, I'll convert 1 kilometer to meters, which is 1000 meters, and 2.5 hours to seconds, which is 900 seconds.\n\nUsing the formula speed equals distance divided by time, the robot's speed is 1000 meters divided by 900 seconds. This simplifies to approximately 1.111 meters per second.\n\nNext, I'll use this speed to determine the length of the hallway. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the length of the hallway. \n\nUsing the same speed formula, the length of the hallway is the speed multiplied by the time, which is 1.111 meters per second times 90 seconds. This equals approximately 99.99 meters.\n\nRounding to a reasonable precision, the hallway is 100 meters long.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given that a robot moves forward at a constant speed and takes the following times to travel certain distances:\n\n1. **Time to travel 1 kilometer (1000 meters):** 2.5 hours.\n2. **Time to travel the length of a particular hallway:** 90 seconds.\n\nWe need to determine the length of the hallway in meters.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Robot's Speed\n\nFirst, let's find the speed of the robot in meters per second (m/s).\n\n- **Convert 2.5 hours to seconds:**\n  \\[\n  2.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 900 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n\n- **Speed (v) = Distance (d) / Time (t):**\n  \\[\n  v = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{900 \\text{ seconds}} \\approx 1.111 \\text{ m/s}\n  \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Length of the Hallway\n\nNow, use the speed to find the length of the hallway.\n\n- **Time (t) = Length (L) / Speed (v):**\n  \\[\n  L = v \\times t = 1.111 \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ seconds} \\approx 99.99 \\text"
