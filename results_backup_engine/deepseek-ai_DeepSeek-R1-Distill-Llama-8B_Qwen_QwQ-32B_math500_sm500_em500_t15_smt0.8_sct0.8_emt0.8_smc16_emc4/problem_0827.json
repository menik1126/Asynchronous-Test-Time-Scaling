            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, alright, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity: 1, and the two complex numbers ω and ω². These are often denoted as 1, ω, ω², and they satisfy the equation ω³ = 1. Also, I recall that for cube roots of unity, the sum of all three is zero. So, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). My goal is to find all possible values of S. Since ω can be either one of the two non-real cube roots of unity, I might need to compute S for both ω and ω² and see if they give the same value or different ones.\n\nBut before I dive into that, maybe there's a smarter way to handle the expression. Sometimes, adding fractions like this can be simplified by finding a common denominator. Let me try that.\n\nSo, S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me compute the sum:\n\nS = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nSimplifying the numerator: 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nAnd the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand that. Multiplying out, that's 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nWait, but ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. So, the denominator becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω². Hmm, interesting. So both numerator and denominator simplify to 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo, S = (2 + ω + ω²) / (2 + ω + ω²). That"

            "output": " simplifies to 1, right? Because numerator and denominator are the same. So, S = 1.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. But if ω is 1, then S would be 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But if ω is the primitive cube root of unity, does S still equal 1?\n\nLet me verify that with specific values. Let me recall the exact values of ω and ω². The cube roots of unity satisfy ω = e^(2πi/3) and ω² = e^(4πi/3). So, let's plug in ω = e^(2πi/3) into the expression S.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω): Denote ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2. So, 1 + ω = 1 - 1/2 + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2. So, 1/(1 + ω) is 1 divided by (1/2 + i√3/2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate, which is 1/2 - i√3/2:\n\n[1*(1/2 - i√3/2)] / [ (1/2 + i√3/2)(1/2 - i√3/2) ]\n\nThe denominator becomes (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, denominator is 1. The numerator is 1/2 - i√3/2. So, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute 1/(1 + ω²). Since ω² is the other non-real cube root, which is e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, 1 + ω² = 1 - 1/2 - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nThus, 1/(1 + ω²) is 1 divided by (1/2 - i√3/2). Again,"

When ω is the primitive cube root of unity, S is still 1. And we know when ω is 1, S is also 1. So, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, S is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value of S is 1.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. But maybe I should consider if there's another approach or verify if I made any mistakes in my calculation.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe using properties of complex numbers. Since 1 + ω and 1 + ω² are in the denominator, I could consider their magnitudes or something else, but I think the method I used is solid.\n\nAnother thought: Since 1 + ω and 1 + ω² are reciprocals of each other? Wait, is that true? Let me check.\n\nIf I take 1/(1 + ω) and 1/(1 + ω²), are they complex conjugates? Let's see, the conjugate of 1 + ω is 1 + ω², because ω is a complex number, so its conjugate is ω². Therefore, 1/(1 + ω) and 1/(1 + ω²) are conjugates.\n\nGiven that, their sum would be twice the real part of one of them. Wait, we already saw in the specific case that the sum is 1, which is a real number, so that aligns with this idea.\n\nSo, if I let S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²), and since 1 + ω and 1 + ω² are complex conjugates, then S is equal to twice the real part"

Let me see if I can manipulate the expression using that.\n\nStarting with S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me note that since 1 + ω + ω² = 0, then ω² = -1 - ω. So, substituting into the second term's denominator:\n\n1 + ω² = 1 + (-1 - ω) = -ω. Wait, that's interesting. So, 1 + ω² = -ω. Therefore, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.\n\nSimilarly, let's see if 1 + ω can be expressed in terms of ω². Since 1 + ω = -ω², so 1/(1 + ω) = -1/ω².\n\nTherefore, substituting back into S:\n\nS = (-1/ω²) + (-1/ω) = - (1/ω² + 1/ω).\n\nHmm, but maybe that's a different way to write it. Let me see if I can simplify this expression.\n\nAlternatively, since ω³ = 1, then 1/ω = ω² and 1/ω² = ω. So, substituting that in:\n\nS = - (ω + ω²). But from the equation 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we know that ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, S = -(-1) = 1. So that's another way to see it!\n\nWow, that's a much quicker approach. So, using the properties of the roots of unity, we can substitute and simplify directly. That's clever. So, that confirms the same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the value of S is 1. Since ω can be any of the cube roots of unity, but in each case, the expression evaluates to 1, so the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all possible values\"."
