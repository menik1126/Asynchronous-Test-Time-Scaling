Since the last term is 199 and the common difference is 2, the number of terms can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.\n\nI'll calculate the number of terms by dividing 199 by 2 and adding 1, which gives me 100 terms.\n\nNow, to find the sum of these 100 terms, I'll use the formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers, which is \\( n^2 \\). Plugging in 100, the sum is \\( 100^2 = 10,000 \\).\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 7, I'll perform the division \\( 10,000 \\div 7 \\), resulting in a quotient of 1428 and a remainder of 4. Therefore, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** Find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199.\\)\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Series:**\n   \n   The given series is the sequence of consecutive odd numbers starting from \\(1\\) up to \\(199\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**\n   \n   - The sequence of odd numbers can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     1, 3, 5, \\dots, 199\n     \\]\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a_1 = 1\\) and a common difference \\(d = 2\\).\n   - The \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the known values:\n     \\[\n     199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     198 = 2(n - 1)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n - 1 = 99\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n = 100\n     \\]\n   - So, there are **100 terms** in the series.\n\n3"
