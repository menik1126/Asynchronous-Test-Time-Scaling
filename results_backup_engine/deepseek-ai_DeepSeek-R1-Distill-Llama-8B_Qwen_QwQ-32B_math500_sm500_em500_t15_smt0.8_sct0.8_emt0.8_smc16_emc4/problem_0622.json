            "output": "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, I'll start by finding its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I observe that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98.\n\nNext, I'll factorize 98. Since 98 is also even, it can be divided by 2, resulting in 49.\n\nNow, 49 is a known square number, specifically 7 squared. Therefore, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared.\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is (exponent of each prime + 1) multiplied together, I'll calculate the number of divisors. For 196, this is (2 + 1) * (2 + 1), which equals 9.\n\nSo, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo find out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - Start by dividing 196 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   - Continue dividing by 2:\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   - Now, 49 is a square number. Divide by 7 (next prime number):\n     \\[\n     49 \\div 7 = 7\n     \\]\n   - Finally, 7 is a prime number.\n     \\[\n     7 \\div 7 = 1\n     \\]\n   \n   So, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Divisors**:\n   - If a number \\( N \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p^a \\times q^b \\times r^c \\times \\dots \\), the total number of positive divisors is:\n     \\[\n     (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1)\\dots\n     \\]\n   - Applying this to 196:\n     \\[\n     (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion"
