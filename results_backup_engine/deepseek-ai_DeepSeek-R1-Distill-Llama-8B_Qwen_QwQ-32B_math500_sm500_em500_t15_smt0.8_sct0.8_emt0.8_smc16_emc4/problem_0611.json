            "output": "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, I need to first find its prime factorization.\n\n196 can be divided by 2 to give 98. Dividing 98 by 2 again results in 49. Next, 49 is divided by 7 to yield 7, and finally, 7 is divided by 7 to give 1.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared, which can be written as \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\).\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, if a number has a prime factorization of \\( p^a \\times q^b \\), the total number of divisors is \\( (a + 1) \\times (b + 1) \\). Applying this to 196's prime factors, where \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\( (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization\nFirst, express 196 as a product of its prime factors.\n\n\\[\n196 = 2 \\times 98\n\\]\n\\[\n98 = 2 \\times 49\n\\]\n\\[\n49 = 7 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\\[\n196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Divisors\nUse the formula for finding the number of divisors based on the prime factorization:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisors} = (a + 1)(b + 1)\n\\]\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the exponents of the prime factors in the factorization.\n\nFor 196:\n\\[\na = 2 \\quad (\\text{from } 2^2)\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 2 \\quad (\\text{from } 7^2)\n\\]\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisors} = (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times "
