It's a quartic polynomial with integer coefficients, and I need to find the number of different possible rational roots it could have. Hmm, alright, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember something called the Rational Root Theorem. I think it helps in finding the possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Let me try to recall how that works. I believe it says that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), is such that \\(p\\) divides the constant term and \\(q\\) divides the leading coefficient. \n\nIn this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, applying the theorem, the possible values for \\(p\\) (the numerator of the possible roots) should be the divisors of 1. The divisors of 1 are just 1 and -1 because those are the integers that can divide 1 without a remainder. \n\nNow, for the denominator \\(q\\), it should divide the leading coefficient, which is 2. The divisors of 2 are 1, 2, -1, and -2. So, the possible values for \\(q\\) are these. \n\nPutting these together, the possible rational roots would be \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is either 1 or -1, and \\(q\\) is 1, 2, -1, or -2. Let me list all these possibilities:\n\n1. When \\(p = 1\\):\n   - \\(q = 1\\): \\(1/1 = 1\\)\n   - \\(q = 2\\): \\(1/2\\)\n   - \\(q = -1\\): \\(1/(-1) = -1\\)\n   - \\(q = -2\\): \\(1/(-2) = -1/2\\)\n\n2. When \\(p = -1\\):\n   - \\(q = 1\\): \\(-1/1 = -1\\)\n   - \\(q = 2\\): \\(-1/2\\)\n   - \\(q = -1\\): \\(-1/(-1) = 1\\"

            "output": ")\n   - \\(q = -2\\): \\(-1/(-2) = 1/2\\)\n\nWait, now I notice that some of these fractions are repeats. For example, 1 appears when \\(p=1, q=1\\) and when \\(p=-1, q=-1\\). Similarly, -1 appears when \\(p=1, q=-1\\) and \\(p=-1, q=1\\). The same thing happens with 1/2 and -1/2. So, I need to make sure I'm not double-counting these. \n\nLet me rewrite the list without duplication:\n\nPossible numerators: 1, -1\nPossible denominators: 1, 2, -1, -2\n\nSo, when I compute all possible fractions, considering that both numerator and denominator can be positive or negative, but the key is that each unique fraction should be considered only once.\n\nWait, actually, if both numerator and denominator can vary independently over positive and negative, we might end up with both positive and negative versions. But hold on, the Rational Root Theorem says that the possible roots are fractions where the numerator is a factor of the constant term and the denominator is a factor of the leading coefficient. However, if the fraction reduces to the same value, we should count it once. So, let's list all possible \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) and then eliminate duplicates.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\nFrom \\(p = 1\\):\n1/1, 1/2, 1/(-1), 1/(-2)\n\nFrom \\(p = -1\\):\n-1/1, -1/2, -1/(-1), -1/(-2)\n\nSo, expanding these, the list is:\n\n1, 1/2, -1, -1/2, -1, 1/2, 1, -1/2\n\nNow, let's identify unique values:\n\n1, -1, 1/2, -1/2\n\nSo, that gives us four unique possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. Are there any other fractions I might have missed? The constant term is 1, so factors are only 1 and -1. The"

So, the possible p/q combinations are indeed only those four. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the possible numerators are ±1, and denominators are 1 and 2. Since the sign can be applied to the numerator or denominator, but the result is the same as having the numerator with the sign. So, the possible distinct fractions are ±1 and ±1/2. That's four different rational numbers. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 4. \n\nBut hold on, let me make sure that all of these are actually possible. The question says \"the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial\". Since the coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) are integers, but can be any integers, so the polynomial can have any of these roots depending on the coefficients. \n\nWait, but is there a case where some of these roots can't exist? For example, maybe if the polynomial is constructed in such a way that certain roots are impossible? Hmm, but the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots, meaning all the possible ones that could exist for some choice of the coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\). \n\nSo, for instance, if I can choose coefficients such that 1 is a root, then 1 is a possible rational root. Similarly for the others. Let me verify that each of these four can indeed be roots for some polynomial of the given form.\n\nLet's test each candidate:\n\n1.

Since a_3, a_2, a_1 are integers, this equation can be satisfied (for example, set a_3 = 0, a_2 = 0, a_1 = -3). So, yes, 1 is possible.\n\n2. Testing x = -1:\n\nPlug in x = -1: 2(-1)^4 + a_3(-"
