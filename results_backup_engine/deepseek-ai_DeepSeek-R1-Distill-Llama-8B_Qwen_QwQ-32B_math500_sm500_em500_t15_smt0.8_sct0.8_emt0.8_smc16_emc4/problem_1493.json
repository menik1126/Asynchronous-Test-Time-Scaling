These primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I should consider the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. This set includes numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on.\n\nNow, I will find the intersection of these two sets. The intersection contains numbers that are both prime and odd and less than 30. Observing the prime numbers list, all primes except for 2 are odd.\n\nTherefore, excluding 2, the remaining primes (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29) are all odd numbers. This means there are 9 numbers in the intersection.\n\nThe final answer is that there are 9 elements in the intersection of the two sets.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Set of Prime Numbers Less Than 30**\nThe prime numbers less than 30 are:\n\\[ 2, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 23, \\ 29 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Set of All Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero**\nThe set of all odd numbers greater than zero is:\n\\[ \\{1, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 9, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 15, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 21, \\ 23, \\ 25, \\ 27, \\ 29, \\dots\\} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the Intersection of the Two Sets**\nThe intersection consists of numbers that are both prime, odd, and less than 30. From the list of prime numbers less than 30, we observe that:\n- All primes except for \\(2\\) are odd.\n\nTherefore, the intersection is:\n\\[ \\{3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 23, \\ 29\\} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Count the Elements in the Intersection**\nThere are \\(9\\) elements in the intersection.\n\n**Final Answer"
