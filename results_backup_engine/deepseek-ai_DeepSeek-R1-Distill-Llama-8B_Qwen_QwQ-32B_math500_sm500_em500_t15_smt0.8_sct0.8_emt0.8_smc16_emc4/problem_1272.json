I know that \\(256 = 2^8\\), so \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the power of a power property. \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, the equation is simplified to \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n\nSince the bases are equal, I can set the exponents equal to each other. This gives me \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2. \\(x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( 2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a power of 2:**\n   \\[\n   256 = 2^8\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the power of a power property (\\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n} \\)):**\n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rewrite the original equation with the simplified right side:**\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^{4}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
