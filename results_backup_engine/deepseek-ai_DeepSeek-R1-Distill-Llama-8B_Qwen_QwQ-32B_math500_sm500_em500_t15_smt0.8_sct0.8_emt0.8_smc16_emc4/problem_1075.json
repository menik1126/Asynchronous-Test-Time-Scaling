            "output": "I need to understand the pattern in the sequence. The first term is 0. The second term is created by adding 1, making it 1. The third term is obtained by multiplying the second term by 1, so it stays 1. \n\nNext, the fourth term is formed by adding 2 to the third term, which results in 3. The fifth term is then obtained by multiplying the fourth term by 2, giving 6. Moving on, the sixth term is created by adding 3 to the fifth term, resulting in 9. The seventh term is the product of the sixth term and 3, so it becomes 27.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the operations alternate between addition and multiplication, using each successive integer starting from 1. To find the first term greater than 125, I'll continue applying these operations step by step.\n\nStarting from the seventh term, which is 27:\n- Term 8: Add 4 to 27, resulting in 31.\n- Term 9: Multiply by 4, giving 124.\n- Term 10: Add 5 to 124, resulting in 129.\n\nTerm 10 is 129, which is the first term greater than 125. Therefore, the answer is 129.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to identify the pattern and determine the first term greater than 125.\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:**\n   - The first term is **0**.\n   - Subsequent terms are generated by alternately **adding** and **multiplying** by each successive integer starting from **1**.\n\n2. **Breaking Down the Operations:**\n   - **Add operation:** Adding the next integer.\n   - **Multiply operation:** Multiplying by the next integer.\n   - The operations alternate starting with **add**.\n\n3. **Generating the Sequence:**\n   \n   | Term | Operation | Value  | Step-by-Step Calculation |\n   |------|-----------|--------|-------------------------|\n   | 1    | Add 1     | 0 + 1  | 1                      |\n   | 2    | Multiply 1 | 1 × 1  | 1                      |\n   | 3    | Add 2     | 1 + 2  | 3                      |\n   | 4    | Multiply 2 | 3 × 2  | 6                      |\n   | 5"
