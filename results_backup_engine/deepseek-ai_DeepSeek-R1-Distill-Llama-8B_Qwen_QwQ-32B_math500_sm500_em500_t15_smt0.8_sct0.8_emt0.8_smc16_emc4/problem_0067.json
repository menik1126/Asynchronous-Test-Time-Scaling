            "output": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem: Given a positive integer n, what's the greatest possible value of gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest possible gcd that can exist between n + 7 and 2n + 1 for some positive integer n.\n\nMaybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here. That's the method where you subtract multiples of the smaller number from the larger one until you find the gcd. Let me try that. So, the two numbers are n + 7 and 2n + 1. Let me subtract 2*(n + 7) from 2n + 1 to see if that helps. \n\nWait, let me write that down: 2n + 1 - 2*(n + 7). Calculating that, 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = 1 - 14 = -13. So, the gcd of n + 7 and 2n + 1 is the same as the gcd of n + 7 and 13, right? Because if a number divides both 2n + 1 and n + 7, it must also divide their difference, which is -13, and so the gcd is a divisor of 13.\n\nHmm, 13 is a prime number, so its only positive divisors are 1 and 13. That means the gcd can only be either 1 or 13. So, the maximum possible value is 13, but I need to check if there exists an n that makes this true.\n\nLet me set the gcd equal to 13 and see what n would be. If gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13, then 13 divides both n + 7 and 2n + 1. \n\nSo, 13 divides n + 7, which implies that n ≡ -7 mod 13. Similarly, 13 divides 2n + 1, which implies that 2n ≡ -1 mod 13. Let me solve for n in this congruence.\n\nFrom 2n ≡ -1 mod 13, I can multiply both sides by"

            "output": " the inverse of 2 mod 13. The inverse of 2 mod 13 is 7 because 2*7 = 14 ≡ 1 mod 13. So, multiplying both sides by 7 gives n ≡ -7 mod 13. \n\nWait, that's the same as n ≡ 6 mod 13 because -7 mod 13 is 6 (since 13 -7 =6). Wait, let me check that again. -7 mod 13 is the same as 13 -7 =6, so yes, n ≡6 mod13. \n\nSo, n must be congruent to 6 mod13. Let me test n =6. Let's see, n +7 =13 and 2n +1=13. The gcd of 13 and13 is 13, which works. So, n=6 is a solution. \n\nTherefore, the gcd can indeed be 13, so the greatest possible value is 13. \n\nWait, but let me check another n that is congruent to 6 mod13, like n=19 (since 6 +13=19). Then n+7=26 and 2n+1=39. The gcd of 26 and 39 is 13, which also works. So that's good. \n\nIs there any way the gcd could be higher than 13? Since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13, so no. Therefore, the maximum possible gcd is 13. \n\nHmm, so I think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. \n\nFirst, using the Euclidean algorithm, gcd(n+7, 2n+1) = gcd(n+7, (2n+1) - 2*(n+7)) = gcd(n+7, -13). Since gcd is always positive, that's gcd(n+7,13). Therefore, the gcd can be either 1 or 13, depending on whether n+7 is a multiple of 13. The maximum is 13, which is achievable when n+7 is a multiple of 13, so n=13k -7 for some"

We need to check if there exists an \\(n\\) such that the gcd is 13.\n\nIf \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13) = 13\\), then 13 must divide \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\). This gives us the congruences:\n\\[\nn + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13} \\implies n \\equiv -7 \\pmod{13} \\implies n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13} \\implies 2n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}\n\\]\nThe inverse of 2 modulo 13 is 7, since \\(2 \\times 7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}\\). Multiplying both sides of \\(2n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}\\) by 7, we get:\n\\[\nn \\equiv -7 \\pmod{13} \\implies n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\n\\]\nThus, \\(n = 13k + 6\\) for some integer \\(k\\).
