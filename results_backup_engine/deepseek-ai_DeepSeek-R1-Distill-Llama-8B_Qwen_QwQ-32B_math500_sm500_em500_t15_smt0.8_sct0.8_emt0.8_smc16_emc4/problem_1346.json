            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you divide one polynomial by another, you can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. Since the divisor here is a binomial \\( x + 1 \\), maybe synthetic division would be quicker. But just to be sure, let me recall how both methods work.\n\nFirst, let me write down the dividend and the divisor:\n\nDividend: \\( x^6 - 3 \\)\n\nDivisor: \\( x + 1 \\)\n\nI think synthetic division is suitable here because the divisor is linear. So, I'll try that method. I should set it up properly. In synthetic division, the root we're using is the opposite of the divisor's sign. Since the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), the root we'll use is \\( -1 \\). That means I'll bring in -1 as the value we'll use for the division.\n\nSo, I'll write out the coefficients of the dividend. Wait, but the dividend is \\( x^6 - 3 \\). I need to express this polynomial in expanded form. That means writing all the terms from the highest power down to the constant term. So, \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\). Hmm, because there are no \\( x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2, \\) or \\( x \\) terms, their coefficients are all zero. So, the coefficients are: 1 (for \\( x^6 \\)), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nWait, so coefficients are: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3. That's seven coefficients because the polynomial is of degree 6.\n\nNow, setting up synthetic division with the root -1:\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n\nNow, I need to bring down the leading coefficient, which is 1. Then, multiply 1 by -1, which gives -1, and add that to the next coefficient ("

            "output": "0). So, 0 + (-1) = -1. \n\nNext, take that -1 and multiply by -1 again, getting 1. Add that to the next coefficient (0), so 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nThen, take that 1 and multiply by -1, getting -1. Add to the next coefficient (0): 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1 to get 1, add to next coefficient (0): 0 +1 =1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1 to get -1, add to next coefficient (0): 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1 to get 1, add to the last term (-3): -3 +1 = -2.\n\nWait, let me write this step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the coefficients:\n\n1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | -3\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1. Add to next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1: 1. Add to next 0: 0 +1 =1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1. Add to next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1: 1. Add to next 0: 0 +1 =1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1. Add to next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1: 1. Add to -3: -3 +1 = -2.\n\nSo the bottom row of coefficients is:\n\n1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, and the last term is -2.\n\nWait, but in synthetic division, the last term is the remainder. So the remainder here is -2. The other coefficients form the quotient polynomial. Since we divided a degree 6 polynomial by a degree 1 polynomial, the quotient should be degree 5. So the coefficients correspond to \\( x^5 \\), \\( x^4 \\), \\( x^3 \\), \\( x^2 \\), \\( x \\), and the constant term. \n\nTherefore, the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4"

            "model": "small",
            "output": " + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\). The remainder is -2.\n\nWait, but let me verify if I did all the multiplications correctly. Let me do it again step by step:\n\nStart with coefficients: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1\n\nAdd to next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1\n\nMultiply -1 by -1: 1\n\nAdd to next 0: 0 +1 =1\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1\n\nAdd to next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1\n\nMultiply -1 by -1: 1\n\nAdd to next 0: 0 +1 =1\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1\n\nAdd to next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1\n\nMultiply -1 by -1:1\n\nAdd to -3: -3 +1 = -2\n\nYes, same result. So the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\) with a remainder of -2. Therefore, the complete division is:\n\n\\( x^6 - 3 = (x + 1)(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1) -2 \\)\n\nBut the question only asks for the quotient, which is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\).\n\nWait a second, another thought: could I have made a mistake in the sign when multiplying by -1? Let me check. Each time, I'm multiplying the current result by -1, right? So, starting with 1, multiply by -1: -1, that's correct.\n\nThen, take -1 and multiply by -1: 1, correct. Then 1 times -1: -1, correct. And so on. So the signs seem correct. So, the quotient is as above.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used polynomial long division. Maybe I should try that to cross-verify.\n\nSo, setting up polynomial long division: dividing \\( x^6 - 3 \\) by \\( x + 1 \\).\n\nFirst, we divide the leading term \\( x^6 \\"

Subtract that from the original polynomial:\n\n\\( (x^6 -3 ) - (x^6 + x^5 ) = -x^5 -3 \\).\n\nNow, the new term is -x^5. Divide that by x, getting -x^4. Multiply back by x +1: -x^5 -x^4. Subtract that from the previous remainder:\n\n\\( (-x^5 -3 ) - (-x^5 -x^4 ) = x^4 -3 \\).\n\nNext term: x^4 divided by x is x^3. Multiply back: x^4 +x^3. Subtract:\n\n\\( (x^4 -3 ) - (x^4 +x^3 ) = -x^3 -3 \\).\n\nNext term: -x^3 divided by x is -x^2. Multiply back: -x^3 -x^2. Subtract:\n\n\\( (-x^3 -3 ) - (-x^3 -x^2 ) = x^2 -3 \\).\n\nNext term: x^2 divided by x is x. Multiply back: x^2 +x. Subtract:\n\n\\( (x^2 -3 ) - (x^2 +x ) = -x -3 \\).\n\nNext term: -x divided by x is -1. Multiply back: -x -1. Subtract:\n\n\\( (-x -3 ) - (-x -1 ) = (-3 +1 ) = -2.\n\nSo the remainder is -2, and the quotient terms are x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1. Exactly the same as synthetic division. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the quotient is indeed \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, another way to check is using the Remainder Theorem. Wait, the remainder when dividing by x +1 is f(-1). Let me compute f(-1) where f(x) = x^6 -3. \n\nf(-1) = (-1)^6 -3 = 1 -3 = -2, which matches the remainder we found. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the"
