Two configurations are considered equivalent if one can be obtained by rotating the other.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Fix One Person's Position:**\n   - Since the table is square, rotating it by 90°, 180°, or 270° will result in the same configuration. To eliminate these redundancies, we can fix one person's position.\n   \n2. **Arrange the Remaining People:**\n   - After fixing one person, we have 7 remaining people to seat.\n   - These 7 people can be arranged in a circular manner around the table. However, since the table is square, the seating isn't purely circular; each side has a specific structure.\n\n3. **Consider Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - By fixing one person's position, we account for the rotational symmetry. This means each unique arrangement is counted only once.\n   \n4. **Calculate the Number of Arrangements:**\n   - The number of ways to arrange the remaining 7 people is equal to the number of permutations of 7 distinct items, which is \\(7!\\).\n   \n5. **Compute \\(7!\\):**\n   \\[\n   7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Final Answer"
