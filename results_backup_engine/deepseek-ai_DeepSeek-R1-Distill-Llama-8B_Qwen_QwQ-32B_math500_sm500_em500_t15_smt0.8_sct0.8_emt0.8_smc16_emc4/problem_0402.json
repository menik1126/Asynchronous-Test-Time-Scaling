            "output": "To determine when the two gears will both point north again, I need to find their least common multiple (LCM) in revolutions per minute, and then convert that into seconds.\n\nFirst, I'll convert the gears' rotations from fractions to improper fractions:\n- 33 1/3 revolutions per minute is 100/3 revolutions per minute.\n- 45 revolutions per minute is 45/1 revolutions per minute.\n\nNext, I'll find the LCM of 100/3 and 45. To do this, I'll convert the fractions to decimals for easier calculation:\n- 100/3 ≈ 33.3333 revolutions per minute.\n- 45 revolutions per minute.\n\nCalculating the LCM of 33.3333 and 45 by finding the smallest number that both can divide into evenly would be 180. This means that after 180 revolutions, both gears will align their marks pointing north.\n\nFinally, I'll convert 180 revolutions per minute into seconds by multiplying by 60 seconds per minute, resulting in 10,800 seconds. Therefore, the two gears will both point north again after 10,800 seconds.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine after how many seconds the two gears will next align their marks pointing due north.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\n- **Gear A**: Turns \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) times per minute.\n- **Gear B**: Turns \\( 45 \\) times per minute.\n- **Initial Position**: Both marks point due north.\n\nWe need to find the next time (in seconds) when both gears align their marks pointing north.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Time When Both Gears Point North**\n\nTo align, the gears must complete an integer number of full revolutions. Therefore, we need to find the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of their rotational periods.\n\n**Step 3: Express the Rotational Periods as Fractions**\n\nFirst, express the gears' rotations as fractions:\n\n- \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) turns per minute = \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\) turns per minute.\n- \\( 45 \\) turns per minute = \\( \\frac{45}{1} \\) turns per minute.\n\n**Step 4: Convert Rotations to Common Terms**\n\nTo find the LCM, it's easier to convert the rotations to whole numbers. Multiply both gears' rotations by 3 to eliminate the fraction"

Since Gear A turns \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\) times per minute:\n\n- Time = \\( \\frac{900}{\\frac{100}{3}} = \\frac{900 \\times 3}{100} = 27 \\) minutes.\n\n**Step 8: Convert Minutes to Seconds**\n\n- \\( 27 \\) minutes \\( \\times 60 \\) seconds/minute = \\( 1620 \\) seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1620}"
