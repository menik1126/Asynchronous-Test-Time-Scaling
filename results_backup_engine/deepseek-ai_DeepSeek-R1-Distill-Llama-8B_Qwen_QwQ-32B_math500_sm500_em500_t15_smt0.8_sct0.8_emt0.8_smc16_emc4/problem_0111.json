            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. I think this is a partial fractions problem. Let me recall how partial fractions work. When you have a rational function and you want to express it as a sum of simpler fractions, you can decompose it into the form of a fraction over each factor of the denominator. \n\nFirst, I should factor the denominator on the right side. The denominator is \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let's see, 8 and -3: 8 * (-3) = -24, and 8 + (-3) = 5. Yes, so the denominator factors into \\( (x + 8)(x - 3) \\).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, to decompose the right side, I can write it as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{x - 3} + \\frac{B}{x + 8}\n\\]\n\nBut in the problem, it's given as C and D, so I'll stick with C and D for now. So, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nI remember that to find C and D, I can use the method of equating coefficients or plugging in suitable values for x to make the denominators zero. Let me try the substitution method first because it might be quicker.\n\nIf I let x = 3, then the term \\(\\frac{C}{x - 3}\\) will have a denominator of zero, but the other term will become \\(\\frac{D}{11}\\). On the right side, the denominator becomes zero as well,"

Hmm, maybe I should try another approach. Maybe I should clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by \\((x - 3)(x + 8)\\). Let's try that.\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\((x - 3)(x + 8)\\):\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nYes, this seems better. Now, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n\\[\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, let's group the like terms:\n\n\\[\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nSo, setting up the equations by equating coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: \\(C + D = 4\\)\n2. Constant term: \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables. I can solve this system to find C and D.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\(C + D = 4\\), I can express D in terms of C: \\(D = 4 - C\\).\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation:\n\n\\(8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\\)\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, distribute the -3:\n\n\\(8C - 12 + 3C = -23\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(8C + 3C = 11C\\), so:\n\n\\(11C - 12 = -23\\)\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n\\(11C = -23 + 12\\)\n\n\\(11C = -11\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\n\\(C = -1\\)\n\nNow, since \\(D = 4 - C\\), plugging in C = -1:\n\n\\(D ="

That seems correct.\n\nThen D = 4 - (-1) = 5. So yes, C is -1, D is 5.\n\nLet me plug C and D back into the equation to verify.\n\nOriginal equation after clearing denominators:\n\nC(x+8) + D(x-3) = 4x -23.\n\nSubstitute C = -1 and D =5:\n\n-1*(x +8) + 5*(x -3) = -x -8 + 5x -15 = (5x -x) + (-8 -15) =4x -23.\n\nWhich matches the right side. So the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, CD is (-1)*(5) = -5.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for C and D, we start by expressing the given equation as a sum of partial fractions. After clearing the denominators, we form a system of equations by equating coefficients. Solving this system yields C = -1 and D = 5. Thus, the product CD is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-5}\n\\]"
