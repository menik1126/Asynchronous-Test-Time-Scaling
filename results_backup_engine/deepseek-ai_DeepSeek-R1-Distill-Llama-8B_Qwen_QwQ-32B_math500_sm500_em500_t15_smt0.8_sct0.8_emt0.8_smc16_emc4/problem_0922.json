            "output": "To find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime factors.\n\nFirst, 84 can be divided by 2, giving 42. Dividing 42 by 2 again results in 21. Then, dividing 21 by 3 gives 7, which is a prime number. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7.\n\nNext, I need to combine these prime factors into distinct integers. The smallest possible distinct integers would be 4, 3, and 7, since 4 is 2 squared and 3 and 7 are primes. Multiplying these together gives 4 * 3 * 7 = 84.\n\nFinally, adding these integers together: 4 + 3 + 7 = 14. Therefore, the least possible sum of these integers is 14.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nThe product of a set of distinct positive integers is 84. What is the least possible sum of these integers?\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Factorize 84 into its prime factors:**\n   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Combine the prime factors into distinct integers:**\n   - We can rewrite 84 as \\( 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\).\n   - To minimize the sum, we aim to use the smallest possible distinct integers.\n   - The integers \\( 4, 3, \\) and \\( 7 \\) are distinct and their product is:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the sum of these integers:**\n   \\[\n   4 + 3 + 7 = 14\n   \\]\n   \n---\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]"
