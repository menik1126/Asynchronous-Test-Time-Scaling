            "output": "First, I recognize that the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\) involves exponents. To solve for \\(x\\), it would be helpful to isolate \\(3^x\\) on one side of the equation.\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides of the equation by \\(2^3\\) to isolate \\(3^x\\). This simplifies the equation to \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{2^3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(2^3\\), I get 8. Dividing 72 by 8 gives me 9. So, the equation now is \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(x\\) in the equation \\(3^x = 9\\). I know that \\(9\\) is equal to \\(3^2\\), so the equation becomes \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. This means \\(x = 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the original equation is 2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(x\\) is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
