It has 10 complex roots, which are paired as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). I need to find the value of the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), \\(r\\overline{r} = |r|^2\\). So, each term in the sum is the reciprocal of the squared magnitude of each root. So, the problem boils down to finding the sum of \\(1/|r_k|^2\\) for \\(k = 1\\) to \\(5\\).\n\nNow, since the equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), it might help to consider substituting \\(y = x\\) and rewrite the equation as \\(y^{10} = -(13y - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, we get \\(y = \\omega (13y - 1)\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of unity, specifically a 10th root of \\(-1\\). Wait, actually, since the exponent is 10, the roots of \\(-1\\) are the 20th roots of unity that satisfy \\(\\omega^{20} = 1\\) and \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\). Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of \\(\\omega\\) being a 10th root of \\(-1\\), so \\(\\omega\\) satisfies \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\).\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. If we have \\(y^{10} = -(13y - 1)^{10}\\), then taking the 10th root would give \\(y = \\omega (13y - 1)\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\). So, \\(\\omega"

So, these are the 10th roots of \\(-1\\), which are the same as the 20th roots of unity at odd multiples of 10.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating things. Let me think differently. Maybe I can manipulate the original equation to express it in terms of \\(x\\) and then use Vieta's formula.\n\nSo, the equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Let's expand this equation. Hmm, expanding \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) would be tedious, but maybe I don't need the exact expansion. Instead, perhaps I can factor or manipulate the equation in a way that relates to \\(1/r_k \\overline{r}_k\\).\n\nWait, but \\(r_k\\) is a root of this equation, so \\(r_k^{10} + (13r_k - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Maybe I can write this as \\(r_k^{10} = -(13r_k - 1)^{10}\\), and then take reciprocals and conjugates? Hmm, or perhaps consider the product \\(r_k \\overline{r}_k = |r_k|^2\\), which is the modulus squared.\n\nLet me think about the product \\(r_k \\overline{r}_k\\). Since \\(r_k\\) is a complex root, its conjugate \\(\\overline{r}_k\\) is also a root because the coefficients of the polynomial are real. So, each root \\(r_k\\) comes with its conjugate \\(\\overline{r}_k\\). Therefore, the product \\(r_k \\overline{r}_k = |r_k|^2\\) is a real, non-negative number.\n\nGiven that, each term in the sum is \\(1 / |r_k|^2\\), and I need to find the sum of these over \\(k = 1\\) to \\(5\\).\n\nI wonder if there's a way to relate \\(1/|r_k|^2\\) to something in the original equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that"

Wait, but the problem lists 10 roots as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, ..., r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\), so there are 5 pairs. Therefore, the sum over the 5 terms would be over each pair once. But in the transformed equation, each root \\(y\\) corresponds to a root \\(r = 1/y\\), so each \\(y\\) is a root of the equation \\( (13 - y)^{10} + 1 = 0 \\). Since the original equation had roots \\(r_k\\), their reciprocals are the roots of the transformed equation.

Therefore, the sum in the problem is over each of these 5 pairs, each contributing \\( |y_j|^2 + |\\overline{y}_j|^2 = 2|y_j|^2 \\). Wait, but the problem states the sum over 5 terms, each of which is \\(1/(r_k \\overline{r}_k)\\), so each term is from one root \\( r_k \\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the sum is over the 5 roots \\( r_1, r_2, ..., r_5 \\), each being one from each pair.
