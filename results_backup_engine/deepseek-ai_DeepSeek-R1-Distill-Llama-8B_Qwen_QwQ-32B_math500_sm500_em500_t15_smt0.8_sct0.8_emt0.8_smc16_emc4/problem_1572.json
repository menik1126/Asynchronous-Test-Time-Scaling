Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that simplifying radicals is all about breaking them down into factors that have perfect squares. So maybe I should start by simplifying each square root in the numerator.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to keep track:\n\n√[( (5 / √80) + (√845 / 9) + √45 ) / √5 ]\n\nI'll start by simplifying each radical in the numerator.\n\nStarting with √80. I know that 80 can be factored into 16 times 5 because 16 is a perfect square. So, √80 = √(16*5) = √16 * √5 = 4√5. That means 5 / √80 is 5 / (4√5). Maybe I can simplify that further.\n\nSimilarly, √845. Let me see, 845 divided by 5 is 169, which is 13 squared. So √845 = √(5*169) = √5 * √169 = 13√5. So √845 / 9 is (13√5)/9.\n\nNext is √45. 45 is 9 times 5, so √45 = √(9*5) = 3√5.\n\nNow, let me rewrite the numerator with these simplified radicals:\n\n5 / (4√5) + (13√5)/9 + 3√5.\n\nHmm, these terms have different denominators, so I need to combine them. To add fractions, I should find a common denominator. Let's see, the denominators are 4√5, 9, and 1. The least common denominator would be 36√5, I think, because 4 and 9 have LCM 36, and √5 is already part of the denominator.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: 4√5, 9, and 1. So, the denominators are 4, 9, and 1. LCM of 4 and 9 is 36. So, yes, 36√5 would be the common denominator"

            "output": ", but actually, the first term has a denominator of 4√5, so maybe I need to consider that. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to first simplify each term individually before combining them. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 / (4√5). I can rationalize the denominator here. Multiply numerator and denominator by √5:\n\n(5 * √5) / (4√5 * √5) = (5√5) / (4*5) = (5√5)/20 = √5/4. Oh, that's simpler!\n\nSo the first term simplifies to √5 / 4.\n\nThe second term is (13√5)/9, which is already fine.\n\nThe third term is 3√5, which can be written as (3√5)/1.\n\nSo now the numerator is:\n\n√5/4 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5.\n\nNow, to add these together, let's express all terms with the same denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. So let's convert each term to have 36 as the denominator.\n\nFirst term: √5/4 = (√5 * 9)/(4 * 9) = 9√5/36.\n\nSecond term: (13√5)/9 = (13√5 * 4)/(9 * 4) = 52√5/36.\n\nThird term: 3√5/1 = (3√5 * 36)/36 = 108√5/36. Wait, hold on, that can't be right. Wait, 3√5 is the same as (3√5)/1, so to get denominator 36, we multiply numerator and denominator by 36? Wait, no, that's overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 3√5 is equal to (3√5)*(36/36) but that's not helpful. Wait, actually, to get denominator 36, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 36, but that would be 3√5 * 36 / 36,"

            "output": " which is 108√5 / 36. But that seems huge. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider the numerator as a sum of three terms: A + B + C, where A = √5/4, B = 13√5/9, and C = 3√5.\n\nLet me factor out √5 from each term:\n\n√5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nSo the numerator is √5 times (1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Now, this seems easier because now we can compute the sum inside the parentheses first, and then multiply by √5.\n\nSo, let me compute 1/4 + 13/9 + 3.\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for 4, 9, and 1. The LCM of 4 and 9 is 36, so let's convert each term:\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\n3 = 108/36.\n\nAdding them together: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = 169/36.\n\nSo, the numerator is √5*(169/36) = (169√5)/36.\n\nSo now, going back to the original expression, the numerator of the main fraction inside the square root is (169√5)/36, and the denominator is √5.\n\nSo the main fraction inside the square root is:\n\n(169√5 / 36) / √5 = (169√5) / (36√5).\n\nNow, I can simplify this by canceling out √5 in numerator and denominator.\n\n(169√5) / (36√5) = 169/36.\n\nSo now, we have the square root of 169/36.\n\n√(169/36) is √169 divided by √36, which is 13/6.\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nWait, let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the original expression:\n\n√[(5 / √80 + √845 / 9 + √45) / √5 ]\n\nSimplify each radical:\n\n√80 = 4√5, so 5 / √80 = 5 / (4"
