            "output": "To find the remainder when the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 199 is divided by 7, I'll start by determining how many terms are in this sequence. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence of odd numbers can be expressed as \\( a_n = 2n - 1 \\). Setting \\( 2n - 1 = 199 \\) gives \\( n = 100 \\), so there are 100 terms in total.\n\nNext, I know that the sum of the first n odd numbers is given by the formula \\( S = n^2 \\). Therefore, the sum of the first 100 odd numbers is \\( 100^2 = 10,000 \\).\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I'll perform the division. Dividing 10,000 by 7 gives 1,428 with a remainder. Multiplying 7 by 1,428 gives 9,996. Subtracting this from 10,000 leaves a remainder of 4. Thus, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nLet's find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\) step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Number of Terms\nThe sequence \\(1, 3, 5, \\dots, 199\\) is an arithmetic sequence where:\n- The first term (\\(a_1\\)) is \\(1\\).\n- The common difference (\\(d\\)) is \\(2\\).\n\nThe \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nSetting \\(a_n = 199\\):\n\\[\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n198 = (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n99 = n - 1 \\\\\nn = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are **100** terms in the sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Sum of the First \\(n\\) Odd Numbers\nThe sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is a well-known formula:\n\\[\nS = n^2\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(n = 100\\):\n\\[\nS = 100^2 = 10"
