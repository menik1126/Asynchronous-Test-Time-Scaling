            "output": "First, I need to find the prime factorization of 196. Starting with the smallest prime, 2, I divide 196 by 2 to get 98. Dividing 98 by 2 again gives me 49, which means 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 49\\).\n\nNext, I'll factorize 49. Since 49 is a perfect square, it can be expressed as \\(7^2\\). Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nNow, to determine the number of positive whole-number divisors, I'll use the formula for the number of divisors. If a number has a prime factorization of \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the total number of divisors is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\). Applying this to 196:\n\n- For the prime number 2, the exponent \\(a\\) is 2, so \\(a + 1 = 3\\).\n- For the prime number 7, the exponent \\(b\\) is 2, so \\(b + 1 = 3\\).\n\nMultiplying these together gives \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\). Therefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - Start by dividing 196 by the smallest prime, 2.\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   - Continue dividing by 2:\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   - Now, factorize 49:\n     \\[\n     49 = 7^2\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n     \\[\n     196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Divisors**:\n   - For a number expressed as \\( p^a \\times q^b \\), the total number of divisors is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\).\n   - Here, \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n    "
