            "output": "To determine for which grade the percentage of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders, I'll start by setting up an equation where Males is 135% of Females. This gives the equation:\n\nMales = 1.35 × Females\n\nNext, I'll convert the percentages into decimal form to make the calculation easier. I'll also assume there are 300 males and 300 females in each grade, as stated in the problem.\n\nFor each grade, I'll calculate what the female percentage would need to be for the male percentage to equal 135% of it. This involves dividing the male percentage by 1.35:\n\nFemale Required = Males / 1.35\n\nI'll then compare the actual female percentage surveyed to this required percentage to find how close each grade is to the target. The closer the actual percentage is to the required value, the closer the male percentage is to 135% of the female percentage.\n\nAfter performing these calculations for each grade, I'll identify the grade with the smallest difference between the actual and required percentages. This will indicate the grade where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to **135%** of the number of female bus riders, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship:**\n   \n   We need to find the grade where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Males} = 1.35 \\times \\text{Females}\n   \\]\n   This means the number of male bus riders is 1.35 times the number of female bus riders.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation for Each Grade:**\n   \n   For each grade, let’s denote:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Males} = M \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Females} = F\n   \\]\n   \n   According to the problem:\n   \\[\n   M = 1.35 \\times F\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Convert Percentages to Decimal Form:**\n   \n   Since we're dealing with percentages, we'll convert them to decimals for easier calculations:\n   \n   - **9th Grade:**\n     \\[\n     M = 41.1\\% \\quad F = 39.4\\%\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     1.35"
