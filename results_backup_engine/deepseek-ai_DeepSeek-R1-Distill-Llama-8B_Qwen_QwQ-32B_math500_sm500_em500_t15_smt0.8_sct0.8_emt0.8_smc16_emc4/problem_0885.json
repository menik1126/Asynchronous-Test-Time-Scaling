Checking the greatest common divisor of 57 and 160, I find that they are coprime, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.\n\nNext, I will prepare the denominator to determine the number of decimal places the decimal will have. The prime factorization of 160 reveals that it has a factor of 10, which means the decimal will terminate after one place.\n\nFinally, I will perform the division of 57 by 160. Since the denominator is 160, which is a multiple of 10, the decimal will have one digit after the decimal point. Dividing 57 by 160 results in 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Conditions for a Terminating Decimal\nA fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will result in a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\(b\\) (after simplifying the fraction) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. This is because the prime factors 2 and 5 are the only those that contribute to the terminating nature of the decimal.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Fraction\nFirst, check if the numerator and denominator have a common divisor other than 1. In this case, 57 and 160 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n### Step 3: Factor the Denominator\nFactorize the denominator to ensure it only has 2's and 5's:\n\\[\n160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n\\]\nSince 160 has only 2 and 5 as prime factors, the decimal will indeed terminate.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Division\nNow, perform the division of 57 by 160:\n\\[\n57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
