            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\). Hmm, I remember from algebra that when you divide one polynomial by another, you can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. Since the divisor is a binomial \\( x + 1 \\), synthetic division might be the quicker method here. Let me try to recall how synthetic division works.\n\nFirst, I think I need to pick the root corresponding to the divisor \\( x + 1 \\). The root would be \\( -1 \\) because setting \\( x + 1 = 0 \\) gives \\( x = -1 \\). So, I'll use \\( -1 \\) for synthetic division.\n\nNow, the dividend is \\( x^6 - 3 \\). Wait, that's a sixth-degree polynomial. I should write down all the coefficients of the terms from \\( x^6 \\) down to the constant term. But \\( x^6 - 3 \\) has coefficients: 1 for \\( x^6 \\), 0 for \\( x^5 \\), 0 for \\( x^4 \\), 0 for \\( x^3 \\), 0 for \\( x^2 \\), 0 for \\( x^1 \\), and -3 for the constant term. So, the coefficients are 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nLet me set up the synthetic division with \\( -1 \\) on the left and these coefficients: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3. Then, I bring down the leading coefficient. That would be 1. Next, I multiply 1 by -1, which gives me -1, and add that to the next coefficient, which is 0. So, 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMoving on, I take that -1 and multiply it by -1, which gives 1, and add that to the next coefficient, which is 0. So, 0 + 1 = 1. Then, I take 1 and multiply by -1, getting -1, and add that to the next coefficient, which is 0. So, 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nThis pattern seems a bit repetitive but let's keep going. Multiply the current"

The coefficients after the first one are alternating between 1 and -1. Let me confirm: So far, the coefficients after division are 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1. The last term is the remainder.\n\nBut wait, the original polynomial is \\( x^6 - 3 \\), so the constant term is -3. After division by \\( x + 1 \\), we should have a remainder.
