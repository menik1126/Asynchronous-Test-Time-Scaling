            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation here: 2 raised to the power of 2x equals 256 to the power of 1/2. Hmm, I need to solve for x. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that both sides of the equation can be expressed as powers of 2. That might help me compare the exponents. Let me see... 256 is a number I recognize as a power of 2. Let me think: 2 to the 8th power is 256 because 2^8 = 256. Yep, that's right. So 256 is 2^8.\n\nNow, looking back at the equation: 2^{2x} = 256^{1/2}. Since I know that 256 is 2^8, I can rewrite 256^{1/2} as (2^8)^{1/2}. I think when you have a power raised to another power, you multiply the exponents. So (2^8)^{1/2} should be 2^(8*(1/2)). Let me calculate that exponent: 8 times 1/2 is 4. So, 256^{1/2} simplifies to 2^4.\n\nSo now, the equation is 2^{2x} = 2^4. Since the bases are the same (both are base 2), I can set the exponents equal to each other. That gives me 2x = 4.\n\nTo solve for x, I just need to divide both sides by 2. So, 2x divided by 2 is x, and 4 divided by 2 is 2. Therefore, x equals 2.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the original equation: 2^{2x} = 256^{1/2}. If x is 2, then 2x is 4, so 2^4 is 16. Now, 256^{1/2} is the square root of 256, which is 16 as well. Yep, both sides are equal when x is 2. That seems correct.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is by taking the logarithm of both sides. Let's try that method just to confirm. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln("

            "output": "2^{2x}) = ln(256^{1/2}).\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, which says ln(a^b) = b*ln(a), I can rewrite this as 2x*ln(2) = (1/2)*ln(256). Now, I know ln(256) is the same as ln(2^8), which is 8*ln(2). So substituting that in: 2x*ln(2) = (1/2)*(8*ln(2)).\n\nSimplifying the right side: (1/2)*8 is 4, so it's 4*ln(2). Now, the equation is 2x*ln(2) = 4*ln(2). I can divide both sides by ln(2) to get rid of it, which leaves me with 2x = 4. Then, divide both sides by 2, and x = 2. Yep, same result.\n\nSo both methods lead me to x equals 2. That gives me confidence that I did it right. I don't think I made any calculation mistakes this time. It's always good to check using a different method to catch any possible errors.\n\nAlternatively, I could also express 256 in terms of base 2. As we did earlier, 256 is 2^8. Then, taking the square root of that is 2^(8*1/2) = 2^4. So 256^(1/2) is 2^4, which is 16. Then, the original equation is 2^{2x} = 16. Since 16 is 2^4, and 2^{2x} is equal to that, then 2x must equal 4, so x is 2. Yep, same process again.\n\nI think I've got it. There's multiple ways to approach this problem, but they all lead to the same answer. It's reassuring to see consistency across different methods. I remember when I was first learning about exponents, it was a bit confusing, but now it makes sense. So, in this case, recognizing that both sides can be expressed as powers of the same base is key. It simplifies everything a lot.\n\nJust to recap in my mind: When the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal as well. That's one of those exponent"

Well, in this case, 2 is a positive number not equal to 1, so that rule holds. So that method is valid here.\n\nAnother thing to note is simplifying the right-hand side first. If I have 256, breaking it down into a power of 2 makes things much simpler. So 256 is 2^8, so taking the square root gives 2^4, which is 16. So that side is straightforward once broken down. If I didn't recognize 256 as a power of 2, maybe I would have had a harder time, but I think most common powers of 2 are worth remembering up to 2^10 or so.\n\nAlso, exponents with fractions can sometimes trip me up. For example, 256^(1/2) is the same as square root of 256, which is 16. Similarly, something like 256^(1/3) would be the cube root, but in this case, it's just the square root. So knowing that 1/2 exponent is a square root is important here.\n\nAlright, I think I've thought through this thoroughly. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all the methods cross-verify the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is x equals 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^\\frac{1}{2}\\), we can follow these steps:\n\nFirst, recognize that 256 can be expressed as a power of 2.
