            "output": "I need to convert the fraction 57/160 into a terminating decimal. First, I recall that a fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5 after simplifying the fraction.\n\nNext, I'll factor the denominator 160 to identify its prime factors. 160 can be divided by 2: 160 ÷ 2 = 80. Dividing by 2 again gives 80 ÷ 2 = 40. Continuing this process, 40 ÷ 2 = 20, and 20 ÷ 2 = 10, and finally 10 ÷ 2 = 5. So, 160 = 2⁴ × 5¹.\n\nSince the denominator only has prime factors of 2 and 5, the fraction is already in its simplest form with a terminating decimal.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the numerator by the denominator to find the decimal representation. 57 ÷ 160 equals 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the Prime Factors of the Denominator:**\n   \n   - Factorize 160:\n     \\[\n     160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^4 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^5 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - The denominator has only the prime factors 2 and 5, which means the decimal will terminate.\n\n2. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   \n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
