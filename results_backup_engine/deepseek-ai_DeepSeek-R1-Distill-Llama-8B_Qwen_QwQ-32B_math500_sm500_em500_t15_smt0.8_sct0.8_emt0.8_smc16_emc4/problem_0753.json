Also, I know that the 13th term is 2016. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me try to write down what's given. The sequence is strictly increasing, which means each term is larger than the previous one. And for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. So that means each set of three terms where the index is odd, even, odd is a geometric sequence.\n\nAlso, for each positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. So the even, odd, even terms form an arithmetic progression.\n\nSo, let me try to translate these properties into mathematical equations. \n\nStarting with the geometric progression part: For any k, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form a geometric sequence. The ratio between consecutive terms in a geometric sequence is constant. So, the ratio r would be a_{2k+1}/a_{2k} = a_{2k+2}/a_{2k+1}. That means r^2 = a_{2k+2}/a_{2k}.\n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic progression part, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So the difference d would be a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}. That means 2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}.\n\nWait, so combining both, from the geometric progression: r^2 = a_{2k+2}/a_{2k}, and from the arithmetic progression: 2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}. So, substituting a_{2k+2} from the arithmetic progression into the geometric progression equation, we get a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}"

So the ratio between a_{2k+1} and a_{2k} is the same as between a_{2k+2} and a_{2k+1}. Let me denote the common ratio as r_k (maybe it's different for each k? Wait, but the problem says \"for every positive integer k\", so maybe the ratio is the same for all k? Or can it vary?)\n\nWait, actually, the problem doesn't specify that the ratio is the same for all k. So perhaps each triplet has its own ratio. Hmm, so maybe my mistake was assuming that the ratio is the same for all k. Let me try again.\n\nLet me denote for each k, the geometric ratio between a_{2k} and a_{2k+1} as r_k, so that a_{2k+1} = r_k * a_{2k}, and a_{2k+2} = r_k * a_{2k+1} = r_k^2 * a_{2k}.\n\nBut also, the arithmetic progression condition"

It goes -5.8 times, but since we are dealing with integer coefficients, perhaps we need a different approach, or maybe it doesn't divide evenly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the remainder to see if it's zero.\n\nLet me compute 30k² -53k +20 at k=4/(5), since 5k -4=0 when k=4/5.\n\nSo, substituting k=4/5 into 30k² -53k +20:\n\n30*(16/25) -53*(4/5) +20 =\n\n(480/25) - (212/5) +20 =\n\n(480/25) - (1060/25) +500/25 =\n\n(480 -1060 +500)/25 =\n\n(480 +500=980; 980 -1060= -80), so -80/25=-16/5≠0\n\nThus, there is a remainder, so 5k -4 does not divide evenly into 30k² -53k +20.\n\nThus, perhaps (30k² -53k +20)/(5k -4) is not an integer, so perhaps this approach can't work unless the remainder is somehow canceled. Maybe if I express the fraction as:\n\n(30k² -53k +20) = (5k -4)*(some quadratic) + remainder.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is needed.\n\nSince the problem gives a13=2016, and we've expressed a13 in terms of k and x, which is a1, perhaps if we can find integer k such that (30k² -53k +20) divided by (5k -4) is a rational number, then x can be determined accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express x as 2016 multiplied by (5k -4)^2 divided by (30k² -53k +20)^2, but this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that k is a small integer, say k=2,3,4,... and see if the equation can be satisfied.\n\nLet me try k=2:\n\nCompute numerator:30"
