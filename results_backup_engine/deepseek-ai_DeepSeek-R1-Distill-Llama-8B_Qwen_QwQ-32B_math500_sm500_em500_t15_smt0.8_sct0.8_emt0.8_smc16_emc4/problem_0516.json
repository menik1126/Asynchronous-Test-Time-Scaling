Then, I need to find A + B + C + D. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, rationalizing the denominator usually helps in such cases. So, I remember that to rationalize, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 2 + √3 is 2 - √3. Let me try that.\n\nSo, multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 - √3:\n\n(1 + √2)(2 - √3) / [(2 + √3)(2 - √3)]\n\nLet me compute the denominator first because that should be straightforward. Using the difference of squares formula: (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b².\n\nSo, denominator = 2² - (√3)² = 4 - 3 = 1. That's nice, the denominator becomes 1.\n\nNow the numerator: (1 + √2)(2 - √3). Let me expand this.\n\nUsing FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last):\n\nFirst: 1 * 2 = 2\n\nOuter: 1 * (-√3) = -√3\n\nInner: √2 * 2 = 2√2\n\nLast: √2 * (-√3) = -√6\n\nSo, putting it all together: 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6\n\nSo numerator = 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6\n\nSince the denominator is 1, the entire expression simplifies to 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nHmm, the problem wants it in the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D). Let me see if I can rearrange the terms accordingly.\n\nLooking at 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6, I can group the constants and the terms with √2, √3, and √6.\n\nFirst, the constant term is 2, which can be written as A * 1, since 2 is 2 times 1. So, maybe A is 2.\n\nSo,"

            "output": " let's factor out 2 from the terms involving √2. That would leave me with 2(1 + √2) - √3 - √6.\n\nSo, that gives me 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). Now, looking at this form, it's similar to what the problem is asking for.\n\nComparing with A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D), we can see that:\n\nA = 2\n\n√B = √2 ⇒ B = 2\n\n√C + √D = √3 + √6 ⇒ C = 3 and D = 6\n\nSo, putting it all together, A = 2, B = 2, C = 3, D = 6.\n\nTherefore, A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the original expression: (1 + √2)/(2 + √3)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2 - √3:\n\nNumerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-√3) + (√2)(2) + (√2)(-√3) = 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6\n\nDenominator: 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSo, numerator simplifies to 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nExpressing this as 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). That seems correct.\n\nSo, A = 2, B = 2, C = 3, D = 6. So 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 is indeed 13.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me see if there's another way to approach it, maybe by choosing a different conjugate or something, but I think this is the standard method. The problem specifically asks for the form with A, B, C, D, so my approach should be correct.\n</think>\n\nThe simplified form of the expression is 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). Therefore, A = 2, B = 2, C = 3, and D = 6. Summing these values gives 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 ="
