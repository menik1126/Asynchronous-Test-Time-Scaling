            "output": "First, I will start by understanding the problem: I need to find the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196.\n\nNext, I'll perform the prime factorization of 196. I know that 196 can be divided by 2, giving me 98. Dividing 98 by 2 again results in 49. Since 49 is a perfect square of 7, I will use 7 as the other prime factor. Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared, which is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nNow that I have the prime factors, I can use the formula for finding the number of divisors. The formula states that if a number has a prime factorization of \\(p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^{k}\\), then the number of positive divisors is \\((a+1) \\times (b+1) \\times \\ldots \\times (k+1)\\).\n\nApplying this to the prime factorization of 196, where \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 2\\), the number of divisors is \\((2+1) \\times (2+1)\\), which equals 3 multiplied by 3, resulting in 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - Divide 196 by 2: \\(196 ÷ 2 = 98\\)\n   - Divide 98 by 2: \\(98 ÷ 2 = 49\\)\n   - 49 is a perfect square: \\(49 = 7^2\\)\n   \n   So, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Divisor Formula**:\n   - For a number expressed as \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the number of positive divisors is \\((a+1) \\times (b+1)\\).\n   - Here, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = 2\\).\n   \n   Calculate the number of divisors:\n   \\[\n   (2 + 1)"
