Since all factors are either 2 or 5, the fraction can be converted to a terminating decimal.\n\nNext, I will set up the division of 57 by 160. Dividing 57 by 160 yields 0.35625. This is a terminating decimal because the denominator's prime factors are only 2 and 5.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements for Terminating Decimals:**\n   - A fraction will have a terminating decimal if, after simplifying, the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 or 5.\n   - The denominator in the given fraction is 160. Let's factorize it:\n     \\[\n     160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n     \\]\n   - Since the denominator only has factors of 2 and 5, the fraction will indeed convert to a terminating decimal.\n\n2. **Set Up the Division:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = 57 \\div 160\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the Division:**\n   - **Step 1:** Determine how many times 160 fits into 57. Since 160 is larger than 57, the result is 0.\n   - **Step 2:** Add a decimal point and zeros to 57 to continue the division:\n     \\[\n     57.000000...\n     \\]\n   - **Step 3:** 160 fits into 570 (the first three zeros make it 570) three times (since \\(160 \\times 3 = 480\\)).\n   - **Step 4:** Subtract 480 from 570 to get 90.\n   - **Step 5:** Bring down the next 0, making it 900.\n   - **Step 6:** 160 fits into 900 five times (since \\(160 \\times 5 = 800\\)).\n   - **Step 7:** Subtract 800 from 900 to"
