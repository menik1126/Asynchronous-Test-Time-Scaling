I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the function looks like. The numerator is \\(x - y\\), which suggests that if I increase \\(x\\) and decrease \\(y\\), the numerator increases. On the other hand, the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\), which is always positive because any real number raised to the fourth power is non-negative, and we're adding 6. So the denominator is always at least 6. That means the entire function is positive or negative depending on the numerator.\n\nSince the denominator is always positive, maximizing the function would mean maximizing \\(x - y\\) while keeping the denominator as small as possible. But I don't know if that's the right approach. Maybe I should consider some calculus here, like taking partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and setting them equal to zero to find critical points.\n\nLet me denote the function as \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). To find its maximum, I'll need to find where the gradient of \\(f\\) is zero. That means solving the system of equations given by the partial derivatives set to zero.\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\). Using the quotient rule:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{(-1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4y^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nTo find critical points, both partial derivatives must be zero. So, set the numerators equal to zero.\n\nFor \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n(x^4 + y^4"

(1)\n2. \\(-x^4 - y^4 - 6 = (x - y)4y^3\\) ... (2)\n\nHmm, these equations look a bit complicated. Maybe I can add them together to see if something simplifies.\n\nAdding equation (1) and equation (2):\n\nLeft side: \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6 - x^4 - y^4 - 6 = 0\\)\n\nRight side: \\((x - y)4x^3 + (x - y)4y^3 = 4(x - y)(x^3 + y^3)\\)\n\nSo, 0 = 4(x - y)(x^3 + y^3)\n\nThis implies that either \\(x - y = 0\\) or \\(x^3 + y^3 = 0\\).\n\nLet's consider each case.\n\nCase 1: \\(x - y = 0\\). Then \\(x = y\\). Plugging this back into equation (1):\n\n\\(x^4 + x^4 + 6 = (x - x)4x^3\\)\n\\(2x^4 + 6 = 0\\)\nBut \\(2x^4 + 6 = 0\\) only if \\(x^4 = -3\\), which is impossible for real numbers. So Case 1 has no solutions.\n\nCase 2: \\(x^3 + y^3 = 0\\). This implies \\(y^3 = -x^3\\), so \\(y = -x\\).

Maybe there are other points where the function is higher. Let me think. The function can approach infinity as \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) go to infinity, but the denominator increases much faster than the numerator. Let me check the behavior at infinity.\n\nAs \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) become large, the denominator \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\) behaves like \\(x^4 + y^4\\), which grows much faster than the numerator \\(x - y\\), which is linear. So, as \\(x, y\\) go to infinity or negative infinity, \\(f(x, y)\\) approaches zero. Hence, the function is bounded above, so the maximum should be attained somewhere finite.\n\nBut I found a critical point at (1, -1) which gives \\(f(1, -1) = \\frac{1}{4}\\).
