            "output": "First, I'll start by understanding the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\). My goal is to find the value of \\(x\\) that makes this equation true.\n\nI know that \\(2^3\\) is equal to 8. So, I can rewrite the equation as \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This simplifies the equation to \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\frac{72}{8}\\) gives me 9, so now the equation is \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nI recognize that 9 is a power of 3, specifically \\(3^2\\). Therefore, I can rewrite the equation as \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nSince the bases on both sides of the equation are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. This means \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute \\(2^3\\) back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
