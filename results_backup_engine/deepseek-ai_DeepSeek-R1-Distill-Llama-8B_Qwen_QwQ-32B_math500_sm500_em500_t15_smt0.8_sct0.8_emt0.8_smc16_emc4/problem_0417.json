The problem mentions that these roots come in complex conjugate pairs: \\( r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\) and so on up to \\( r_5, \\overline{r}_5 \\). So there are five pairs of complex conjugate roots.\n\nThe question asks for the sum \\( \\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5} \\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\( r \\), the product \\( r \\overline{r} \\) is equal to \\( |r|^2 \\), which is a real number. So each term \\( \\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r}_i} \\) is essentially the reciprocal of the square of the modulus of \\( r_i \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum we're looking for is the sum of the reciprocals of the squared magnitudes of each pair of complex conjugate roots. Let's denote this sum as \\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} \\).\n\nNow, I need to find a way to relate this sum to the given equation. Maybe I can use some properties of polynomials, especially since the equation is given in terms of \\( x \\).\n\nLet me consider substituting \\( y = 13x - 1 \\). If I do that, the equation becomes \\( (y)^{10} = -x^{10} \\). So, \\( y^{10} = -x^{10} \\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, we get \\( y = -x \\cdot \\omega \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a 10th root of unity. Wait, but actually, to be precise, \\( y \\) is a 10th root of \\( -x^{10} \\), so \\( y = \\omega"

Vieta's relates the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Since the equation is \\( x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0 \\), let me expand \\( (13x - 1)^{10} \\) using the binomial theorem.\n\nWait, but expanding \\( (13x -1)^{10} \\) would result in a lot of terms. Let me see if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider \\( x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10} \\), so \\( \\left( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} \\right)^{10} = -1 \\). Taking the 10th root, \\( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} = \\omega \\), where \\( \\omega^{10} = -1 \\). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a substitution could be useful. Let me denote \\( z = 13x - 1 \\), which implies \\( x = \\frac{z + 1}{13} \\). Then, substituting into the equation, we get \\( \\left( \\frac{z + 1}{13} \\right)^{10} + z^{10} = 0 \\). That is, \\( \\left( \\frac{z + 1}{13} \\right)^{10} = -z^{10} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{z + 1}{13} = \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega^{10} = -1 \\). Hmm, but maybe that's not the most straightforward path.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of substitution, I can think about the reciprocal of the roots. Let me denote \\( s_i = r_i \\overline{r}_i \\). Then, \\( \\frac{1}{s_i} \\) is what we need to sum.\n\nGiven that the polynomial has roots \\( r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\) etc., so the polynomial can be written as \\( (x - r_1)(x - \\overline{r"

Since the roots come in conjugate pairs, the polynomial can be written as a product of quadratic factors. Therefore, the polynomial is a product of five quadratic terms, each of the form \\( x^2 - 2 \\text{Re}(r_i)x + |r_i|^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term of each quadratic factor is \\( |r_i|^2 \\), so the product of all the constant terms would be the product of \\( |r_i|^2 \\) for each i. But the entire polynomial's constant term can be found by evaluating the original equation at x=0.\n\nWait, let me check the original equation: \\( x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0 \\). The constant term (when x=0) is \\( 0^{10} + (-1)^{10} = 1 \\). So the constant term of the polynomial is 1. Therefore, the product of all the constant terms of the quadratic factors is 1. Since each quadratic factor has a constant term of \\( |r_i|^2 \\), the product \\( \\prod_{i=1}^5 |r_i|^2 = 1 \\).\n\nHmm, so the product of all \\( |r_i|^2 \\) is 1. But the problem is asking for the sum of their reciprocals. So, if I can find the sum of \\( 1/|r_i|^2 \\), given that the product of \\( |r_i|^2 \\) is 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look at another coefficient of the polynomial. Let me think. The polynomial is of degree 10, so Vieta's formula relates the coefficients to the roots. Let me recall Vieta's formula for a degree 10 polynomial:\n\nSuppose the polynomial is \\( x"

Let me expand \\( (13x -1)^{10} \\) to find the coefficients. Alternatively, maybe that's too tedious, but perhaps I can use the binomial theorem.\n\nWait, actually, \\( (13x -1)^{10} \\) can be written as a sum from k=0 to 10 of \\( \\binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 - k} (-1)^k \\). So, expanding, \\( (13x -1)^{10} = \\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 - k} (-1)^k \\).\n\nTherefore, the original equation is \\( x^{10} + \\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 - k} (-1)^k = 0 \\). Let's combine the terms:\n\n\\( x^{10} + \\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 - k} (-1)^k = 0 \\).\n\nNotice that when k=0, the term is \\( (13x)^{10} (-1)^0 = (13x)^{10} \\). So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( x^{10} + (13x)^{10} + \\sum_{k=1}^{9} \\binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 - k} (-1)^k = 0 \\).\n\nWait, actually, k ranges from 0 to 10, but when k=0, the term is (13x)^10, and when k=10, it's (-1)^10 which is 1, so when we add x^{10}, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( x"

So, that would be:\n\n\\( 2x^{10} + \\sum_{k=1}^{9} \\binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 - k} (-1)^k + 1 = 0 \\).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, the expansion is \\( (a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k \\). So in this case, \\( a = 13x \\), \\( b = -1 \\). Therefore,\n\n\\( (13x -1)^{10} = \\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 - k} (-1)^k \\).\n\nSo, that's correct. So when we add \\( x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} \\), we get:\n\n\\( x^{10} + \\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} (13x)^{10 - k} (-1)^k = 0 \\).\n\nSo let's write out all the terms.

So actually, the coefficient of \\( x^{10} \\) is \\( 1 + 13^{10} \\). Hmm, that seems important. So the equation is:\n\n\\( (1 + 13^{10})x^{10} - 10 \\cdot 13^9 x^9 + 45 \\cdot 13^8 x^8 - \\dots + 1 = 0 \\).\n\nOkay, so that's a degree 10 polynomial. So, applying Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is equal to the coefficient of \\( x^9 \\) term divided by the coefficient of \\( x^{10} \\), with an opposite sign. So, in Vieta's terms, for a polynomial \\( a_{10}x^{10} + a_9 x^9 + \\dots + a_0 = 0 \\), the sum of the roots is \\( -a_9 / a_{10} \\).\n\nSo, our polynomial is \\( a_{10}x^{10} + a_9 x^9 + \\dots + a_0 \\), where \\( a_{10} = 1 + 13^{10} \\), \\( a_9 = -10 \\cdot 13^9 \\), \\( a_8 = 45 \\cdot 13^8 \\), and \\( a_0 = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all roots \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{10} r_i = -a_9 / a_{10} = (10 \\cdot 13^9) / (1 + 13^{10}) \\).\n\nBut wait, in our problem, we have roots grouped into conjugate pairs: each \\( r_i \\) and \\( \\overline{r}_"

Wait, s_i =1/(denominator), so s_i^{-1}=denominator.\n\nWait, yes! Because s_i =1/D, so 1/s_i = D.\n\nTherefore, the sum we need is:\n\nSum = (170 -26 cos(π/10)) + (170 -26 cos(3π/10)) + 170 + (170 +26 cos(3π/10)) + (170 +26 cos(π/10))\n\nLet me compute this term by term:\n\nFirst term: 170 -26 cos(π/10)\n\nSecond term:170 -26 cos(3π/10)\n\nThird term:170\n\nFourth term:170 +26 cos(3π/10)\n\nFifth term:170 +26 cos(π/10)\n\nNow, adding all terms together:\n\nLet's group the terms with cos(π/10) and cos(3π/10):\n\nThe first and fifth terms: (170 -26 cos(π/10)) + (170 +26 cos(π/10)) = 170 +170 = 340\n\nSimilarly, the second and fourth terms: (170 -26 cos(3π/10)) + (170 +26 cos(3π/10)) = 170 +170 = 340\n\nThe third term is 170.\n\nTherefore, total sum = 340 + 340 +170 = 850.\n\nWait, that's 340+340=680, plus 170 is 850.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the s_i's is "
