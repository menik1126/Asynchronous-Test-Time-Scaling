            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. To do this, I'll start by identifying all the positive divisors of 284. Since 284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2. \n\nI'll divide 284 by 2 to get 142. Then, I'll find the divisors of 142, which are 1, 2, 71, and 142. Combining these with the earlier result, the divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and 284. \n\nNext, I'll exclude 284 from the list of divisors to determine the proper divisors. So, the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142. Adding these together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 equals 220. \n\nAfter obtaining the sum of the proper divisors of 284, which is 220, I'll now calculate the sum of its proper divisors. I'll list the divisors of 220. Starting with 1, I find that 220 is divisible by 2, giving 110. \n\nContinuing, I'll divide 110 by 2 to get 55. The divisors of 55 are 1, 5, 11, and 55. Combining these, the divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, and 220. \n\nExcluding 220 from the list, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110. Adding these together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 equals 283.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 283.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.**\n3. **Find the proper divisors of"
