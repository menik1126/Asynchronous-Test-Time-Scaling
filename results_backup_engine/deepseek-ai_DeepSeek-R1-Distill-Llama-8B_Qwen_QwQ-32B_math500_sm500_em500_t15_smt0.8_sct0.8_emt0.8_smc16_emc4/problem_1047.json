I need to find the number of different possible rational roots that this polynomial could have. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling some concepts from algebra.\n\nI remember something called the Rational Root Theorem. I think it says that any possible rational root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients is of the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. So, in this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2.\n\nLet me write that down. The constant term, which is the term when x is zero, is 1. The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the highest power of x, which is 2. So, according to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root, say p/q, must satisfy that p divides 1 and q divides 2.\n\nSo, first, let's list all the possible values of p. Since p is a factor of 1, the possible values of p are ±1, right? Because 1 only has two factors: 1 and -1.\n\nNext, let's consider q. Since q is a factor of 2, the possible values of q are ±1 and ±2. But wait, when q is negative, we can write the fraction with a negative sign in the numerator instead. So, to avoid double-counting, I think we only consider positive denominators and include both positive and negative numerators. That way, we can cover all possible fractions without repetition.\n\nSo, with p being ±1 and q being ±1 or ±2, let me list all possible p/q combinations:\n\n1. When q = 1:\n   - p = 1: 1/1 = 1\n   - p = -1: (-1)/1 = -1\n\n2. When q = 2:\n   - p = 1: 1/2\n   - p = -1: (-1)/2 = -1/2\n\nWait, but does q include negative values? Since we're considering rational numbers, q can be positive or negative. However, if I take q as positive and include both positive and negative p, I"

            "output": " can cover all possibilities. Because if q were negative, say -1, then p/q would be equivalent to -p/1. Since p can be positive or negative, that's already accounted for. So, yeah, considering q as positive factors of 2 is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±1/2. So that's four possible candidates. But the question says \"different possible rational roots\". Wait, but does that mean all of these are possible, or are there some restrictions?\n\nWait, the coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, but they can be any integers. So the polynomial can have any of these roots depending on the coefficients. But maybe some of these roots can't actually be roots of such a polynomial? Hmm, maybe I need to check if all these candidates can actually be roots for some choice of a₃, a₂, a₁.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the possible candidates according to the Rational Root Theorem, regardless of whether they can actually be achieved with integer coefficients. But the problem says \"the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial\", so I think it's asking for all possible rational numbers that could be roots for some such polynomial with integer coefficients. So, in that case, the answer would be the four candidates I listed: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. But maybe some of these can't be roots? Let me think.\n\nSuppose, for example, that 1 is a root. Then plugging into the polynomial: 2(1)^4 + a₃(1)^3 + a₂(1)^2 + a₁(1) + 1 = 0. That simplifies to 2 + a₃ + a₂ + a₁ + 1 = 0, so a₃ + a₂ + a₁ = -3. Since a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, this is possible. For example, set a₃ = 0, a₂ = 0, a₁ = -3. So that's possible. So 1 is a possible root.\n\nSimilarly, let's check -1. Plugging in x = -1: 2(-1)^4 + a₃(-1)^3 + a₂(-1)^2 + a₁(-1) + 1 = 0. That"

            "output": "'s 2(1) + a₃(-1) + a₂(1) + a₁(-1) + 1 = 0. So 2 - a₃ + a₂ - a₁ + 1 = 0. So, -a₃ + a₂ - a₁ = -3. Again, since integers are allowed, we can choose values for a₃, a₂, a₁ to satisfy this. For example, set a₃ = 0, a₂ = 0, then -0 + 0 - a₁ = -3 → a₁ = 3. So that's possible. So -1 is also a possible root.\n\nNow, check 1/2. Plugging x = 1/2 into the polynomial: 2*(1/2)^4 + a₃*(1/2)^3 + a₂*(1/2)^2 + a₁*(1/2) + 1 = 0.\n\nLet me calculate each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 2/16 = 1/8\n\na₃*(1/8) → a₃/8\n\na₂*(1/4) → a₂/4\n\na₁*(1/2) → a₁/2\n\nPlus 1.\n\nSo adding all together:\n\n1/8 + (a₃)/8 + (a₂)/4 + (a₁)/2 + 1 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ + 8 = 0 → a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ = -9.\n\nSince a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, we can choose integers such that their combination equals -9. For example, set a₃ = 1, a₂ = 0, a₁ = -2: 1 + 0 + -8 = -7, which is not -9. Hmm, maybe another set. Let me try a₃ = -1, a₂ = -2, a₁ = 2: -1 + (-4) + 8 = 3. Not -9. Hmm, maybe a₃ = 5, a₂ = -4, a₁ = -1: 5 + (-8) + (-4) = -7. Hmm. Maybe a₃ = 3, a₂"

The point is, is it possible to find integers a₃, a₂, a₁ such that a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ = -9. Yes, definitely. Let's choose a₃ = -9, a₂ = 0, a₁ = 0. Then -9 + 0 + 0 = -9. So that's a valid choice. Therefore, with a₃ = -9, a₂ = 0, a₁ = 0, the polynomial becomes 2x⁴ -9x³ + 0x² + 0x +1. If x = 1/2, then 2*(1/16) -9*(1/8) + 0 + 0 +1 = 1/8 - 9/8 +1 = (-8/8) +1 = -1 +1 = 0. So yes, x=1/2 is a root. So that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, let's check x = -1/2.\n\nPlugging in x = -1/2:\n\n2*(-1/2)^4 + a₃*(-1/2)^3 + a₂*(-1/2)^2 + a₁*(-1/2) +1 = 0.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\n\na₃*(-1/8) = -a₃/8\n\na₂*(1/4) = a₂/4\n\na₁*(-1/2) = -a₁/2\n\n+1.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n1/8 - (a₃)/8 + (a₂)/4 - (a₁)/2 + 1 = 0.\n\nMultiply through by 8:\n\n1 - a₃ + 2a₂ -4a₁ +8 = 0 → (-a₃) + 2a₂ -4a₁ = -9.\n\nAgain, can we find integers a₃, a₂, a₁ to satisfy this?

Plugging x=-1/2, we get 2*(1/16) +7*(-1/8) +3*(1/4) +2*(-1/2) +1. Calculating:\n\n2/16 = 1/8,\n7*(-1/8) = -7/8,\n3/4 = 6/8,\n2*(-1/2) = -1,\n+1.\n\nAdding these: 1/8 -7/8 +6/8 -8/8 +8/8.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n1/8 -7/8 = -6/8\n\n-6/8 +6/8 = 0\n\n0 -8/8 = -1\n\n-1 +8/8 = -1 +1 = 0.\n\nSo x=-1/2 is indeed a root.\n\nTherefore, all four possible candidates from the Rational Root Theorem are possible rational roots. So the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there are any duplicates or if I missed any possibilities. The theorem says possible roots are p/q where p divides the constant term (1) and q divides the leading coefficient (2). So, possible p: ±1, possible q: ±1, ±2. So, as I did before, 1/1, -1/1, 1/2, -1/2. That's four distinct values. So, yeah, I don't think I missed any.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any overlap between these fractions? Like, 1 is equal to 2/2, but in our list, we have 1 and 1/2, but 1 is 2/2 and 1/2 is half of that. So they are distinct. Similarly, -1 is distinct from -1/2.\n\nSo, yeah, four different possible rational roots. So, the answer should be 4.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial has integer coefficients, so by the Rational Root Theorem, any possible rational root is of the form"
