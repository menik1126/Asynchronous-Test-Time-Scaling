            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity, which are 1, and the two complex roots. Let me denote them as ω and ω², right? So ω can be either the real root 1, or one of the complex roots.\n\nWait, but hold on. If ω is a cube root of unity, then ω ≠ 1, so the cube roots are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1 and ω² = ω̄ (the complex conjugate of ω). That might be useful later on.\n\nNow, the expression I need to compute is the sum of two fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nHmm, maybe I can find a common denominator or simplify each term separately. Let me try simplifying each fraction first.\n\nStarting with the first term, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\). To simplify this, perhaps I can multiply the numerator and denominator by something to make the denominator real or more manageable. Since ω² is the conjugate of ω (because ω³ = 1), multiplying by ω² might help.\n\nSo, let's try that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} \\times \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2 + \\omega^3}.\n\\]\n\nWait, but ω³ = 1, so ω³ is 1. Therefore, the denominator becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\omega^2 + 1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the first term simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same for the second term, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\):\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by ω:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1"

So this term simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega}{1 + \\omega}.\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting back into the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{1 + \\omega^2} + \\frac{\\omega}{1 + \\omega}.\n\\]\n\nHmm, now we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{1 + \\omega^2} + \\frac{\\omega}{1 + \\omega}.\n\\]\n\nMaybe I can combine these two fractions into one. Let's see if they have a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω²) and (1 + ω). Since ω ≠ -1 and ω² ≠ -1 (because if ω were -1, then (-1)³ = -1 ≠ 1, so that's not a root here), so 1 + ω and 1 + ω² are non-zero.\n\nThe common denominator would be (1 + ω²)(1 + ω). Let me compute that:\n\n(1 + ω²)(1 + ω) = 1*(1) + 1*(ω) + ω²*(1) + ω²*(ω) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so that becomes:\n\n1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nWait, since 1 + ω + ω² = 0 (because it's the sum of cube roots of unity, except 1), because 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Therefore, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (ω + ω²).\n\nBut since ω + ω² = -1 (from 1 + ω + ω² = 0), so 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nOh! So the common denominator is 1. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{1} + \\frac{\\omega}{1} = \\omega^2 + \\omega.\n\\]\n\nBut from earlier, we know that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1."

So second term is ω/(1 + ω).\n\nTherefore, S = [ω²/(1 + ω²)] + [ω/(1 + ω)].\n\nWait, but then to combine these terms, the denominators are (1 + ω²) and (1 + ω).

Again, 1 + ω = -ω², so ω/( -ω² ) = - ω / ω² = -1/ω.\n\nBut since ω³ =1, 1/ω = ω², so this term is -ω².\n\nTherefore, S = -ω - ω² = -(ω + ω²).\n\nWe know from 1 + ω + ω²=0 that ω + ω² = -1.\n\nTherefore, S = -(-1) = 1.\n\nWait, so through this approach, I get S =1.

First, when I combined the two terms, I thought the common denominator was 1, but that seems not correct. So, going through the substitution approach, both give me 1, so likely the correct answer is 1.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this another way. Maybe using symmetry.\n\nIf ω is a primitive cube root of unity, then ω² is its conjugate. So, the expression S is symmetric in ω and ω², so it must be a real number, as complex conjugate would make the expression equal.\n\nTherefore, S is real, and perhaps even an integer.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the substitution method, I computed each term numerically and found S =1.

Let me see:\n\nWait, when I first tried to combine the two fractions, I thought the common denominator was (1 + ω²)(1 + ω) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³ = 1 + (ω + ω²) +1 = 2 + (ω + ω²). Since ω + ω² = -1, so 2 + (-1) =1. So the denominator is 1.

So that's correct. So my initial confusion was because I thought the numerator was ω² + ω, but actually, when combining the fractions, the numerator is more complicated, but it simplifies to 1. So the answer is indeed 1.\n\nTherefore, the possible value is 1. But the question says \"find all possible values\". Since ω is a cube root of unity, but not equal to 1, so ω can be either ω or ω². But since the expression is symmetric in ω and ω², substituting either would give the same result. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but let me check if ω can be 1. If ω =1, then the expression would be 1/(1+1) +1/(1+1)= 1/2 +1/2 =1. So even if ω is 1, the expression is still 1. But the problem states \"Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ =1\".
