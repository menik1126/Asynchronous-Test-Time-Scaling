            "output": "I start by identifying the pattern in the sequence. The given series is 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 199. This is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.\n\nNext, I determine the number of terms in the sequence. Since the common difference is 2, the number of terms can be found using the formula n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Plugging in the values, I get n = (199 - 1)/2 + 1 = 100.\n\nThen, I calculate the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence using the formula S = n/2 * (first term + last term). Substituting the known values, the sum S = 100/2 * (1 + 199) = 50 * 200 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 7, I compute 10,000 modulo 7. Dividing 10,000 by 7 gives a quotient of 1428 and a remainder of 4. Therefore, the modulo 7 remainder is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\) is divided by 7, follow these steps:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Sequence Pattern**\nThe given series is an arithmetic sequence where:\n- **First term (\\(a_1\\))**: 1\n- **Common difference (\\(d\\))**: 2\n- **Last term (\\(a_n\\))**: 199\n\n### **Step 2: Find the Number of Terms (\\(n\\))**\nUse the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nPlugging in the known values:\n\\[\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\n198 = 2(n - 1)\n\\]\n\\[\nn - 1 = 99\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 100\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Sequence**\nThe sum (\\(S_n\\)) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n"
