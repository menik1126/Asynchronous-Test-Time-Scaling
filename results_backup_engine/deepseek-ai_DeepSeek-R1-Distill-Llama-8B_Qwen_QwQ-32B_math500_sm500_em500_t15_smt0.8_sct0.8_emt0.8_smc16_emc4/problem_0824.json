Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². So, ω can be any of these three values. But since the problem is asking for all possible values of the given expression, I might need to compute it for each case and see what results I get.\n\nWait, but before jumping into plugging in each value, maybe there's a smarter way using algebraic manipulations. Let me recall that for cube roots of unity, the sum ω + ω² + 1 = 0. That's a key property. Also, ω² is the complex conjugate of ω if we're considering the non-real roots. Hmm, that might be helpful.\n\nOkay, so the expression is S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Maybe I can combine these two fractions into one. Let me try that.\n\nTo add them, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute the numerator.\n\nFirst, I'll write S as:\n\nS = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nSimplifying the numerator: (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nAnd the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand that.\n\nMultiplying out, I get:\n\n1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut since ω³ = 1, as given, so ω³ = 1. So, substituting that in, the denominator becomes:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nWait, so the numerator is 2 + ω + ω², and the denominator is also 2 + ω +"

When I expand (1 + ω)(1 + ω²), I get 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. But ω³ = 1, so yes, that becomes 2 + ω + ω². So the numerator is also 2 + ω + ω². Therefore, S simplifies to 1. So, regardless of ω, as long as ω³ = 1, S equals 1.\n\nBut hold on, that seems too straightforward. Let me test it with specific values to make sure.\n\nCase 1: ω = 1. Then S = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, that works.\n\nCase 2: Let's choose ω = (-1 + i√3)/2, which is a primitive cube root of unity. Then ω² = (-1 - i√3)/2.\n\nCompute S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω: 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = (1 - 1/2) + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2. Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo S = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2) + 1/(1/2 - i√3/2). Let me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by 2: 2/(1 + i√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3): 2(1 - i√3)/(1 + 3) = 2(1 - i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSecond term: Similarly, 1/(1/2 - i√3/2) becomes 2/(1 - i√3).

Hence, S = 1 for any ω, as long as ω³ = 1.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another approach to see this. Let me think about using the properties of cube roots of unity. I remember that ω ≠ 1, so if ω ≠ 1, then 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Thus, ω + ω² = -1.\n\nWait, but does that help? Let's see.\n\nFrom 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we can get ω + ω² = -1.\n\nSo, in the numerator and denominator, we have 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo, S = 1/1 = 1. That's another way to see it without plugging in all the values.\n\nTherefore, the possible value is just 1.
