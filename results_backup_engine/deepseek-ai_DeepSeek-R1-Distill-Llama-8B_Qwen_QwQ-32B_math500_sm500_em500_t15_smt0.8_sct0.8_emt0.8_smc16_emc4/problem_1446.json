            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, right? Because when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, 3^{2x} = (3^2)^x = 9^x. So the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That seems a bit simpler.\n\nNow, I have 9^x and 10^x on the same side of the equation. Maybe I can combine them somehow or find a substitution. Let me think. If I let y = 9^x, then what is 10^x in terms of y? Hmm, 10^x is equal to (10/9)^x * 9^x, right? Because (10/9)^x times 9^x would give me 10^x. So, that means 10^x = (10/9)^x * y. So substituting back, the equation becomes y + 19 = (10/9)^x * y.\n\nHmm, that seems useful. Let me rearrange this equation. So, y + 19 = (10/9)^x * y. If I subtract y from both sides, I get 19 = (10/9)^x * y - y. Factoring out y on the right side, that becomes 19 = y * [(10/9)^x - 1]. But y is 9^x, so substituting back in, 19 = 9^x * [(10/9)^x - 1].\n\nHmm, that might not be the easiest way to go. Maybe I should try a substitution where I let t = (10/9)^x. Let me try that. If t = (10/9)^x, then 9^x = (9^x). Wait, how does that relate to t? Let me think. Since t = (10/9)^x, then 1/t = (9/10)^x. Also, 9^x times (9/10)^x would be (9*9/10)^x = (81/10)^"

            "output": "x, but that might not help directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can express 9^x in terms of t. Since t = (10/9)^x, then 9^x = (9/10)^x times 9^x divided by 9^x, which is 1. No, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write both sides in terms of t. So, 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Since 10^x = t * 9^x, substituting in, I get 9^x + 19 = t * 9^x. So, 9^x + 19 = t * 9^x. Then, subtract 9^x from both sides: 19 = (t - 1) * 9^x. So, 19 = (t - 1) * 9^x.\n\nHmm, but I still have two variables here, t and 9^x. Maybe I can express 9^x in terms of t. Since t = (10/9)^x, then taking natural logarithms on both sides, ln t = x * ln(10/9). So, x = ln t / ln(10/9). Then, 9^x = e^{x ln 9} = e^{(ln t / ln(10/9)) * ln 9} = e^{(ln 9 / ln(10/9)) * ln t} = t^{ln 9 / ln(10/9)}. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe there's a better substitution. Let me try letting u = 10^x and v = 9^x. Then, the equation becomes v + 19 = u. Also, since 10 = (9 + 1), but I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, notice that 10^x = (9 + 1)^x, which can be expanded using the binomial theorem, but that might not be helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to bring x down. Let me try that. Starting from 9^x + 19 = 10^x. If I subtract 9^x from both sides, I get 19 = 10^x - 9^x. Then, maybe I can factor this or"

Not equal. x=2: 81 +19=100, and 10^2=100. Oh! Wait, that works. 81 +19 is 100, and 10^2 is 100. So x=2 is a solution.\n\nHmm, so x=2 is a solution. Let me check x=0: 1 +19=20 vs 1, nope. x=3: 9^3=729 +19=748 vs 1000, so no. x=1.5? Let me see. 9^1.5 is sqrt(9^3)=sqrt(729)=27*sqrt(9)=27*3=81? Wait, no. Wait, 9^1.5 is 9^(3/2)= (sqrt(9))^3 = 3^3=27. So 27 +19=46, and 10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)=~31.62, so 46 vs 31.62, not equal.\n\nHmm, so x=2 is a solution. Let me see if there are other solutions. Let me check x=1. Let me see, maybe between x=2 and x=3, the left side is 9^x +19, which grows exponentially but 10^x grows faster. Wait, at x=2, they are equal. Let me see for x>2, 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so 10^x -9^x would be increasing, so 10^x -9^x would be greater than 19 for x>2. Wait, but at x=2, it's exactly 19. So maybe x=2 is the only solution?\n\nWait, but let me check x=1. Let me see, at x=1, 10^1"

            "output": "=10, 9^1=9, so 9 +19=28 vs 10. So 28>10, so the left side is greater. At x=2, both sides are 100. At x=3, 10^3=1000, 9^3=729, so 729 +19=748, which is less than 1000. So the function f(x)=10^x -9^x starts below 19 at x=1, crosses 19 at x=2, and keeps increasing. Therefore, x=2 is the only solution.\n\nWait, is that necessarily true? Let me check. Let me define f(x) = 10^x -9^x. At x=1, f(1)=10 -9=1, which is less than 19. At x=2, f(2)=100 -81=19. At x=3, f(3)=1000 -729=271, which is greater than 19. So f(x) increases from x=1 to x=2 to x=3. Therefore, since f(x) is strictly increasing, it crosses 19 exactly once. So x=2 is the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x=2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we start by rewriting \\(3^{2x}\\) as \\((3^2)^x = 9^x\\). This transforms the equation into:\n\n\\[9^x + 19 = 10^x\\]\n\nNext, we test for possible integer solutions. \n\n- For \\(x = 1\\), we get \\(9^1 + 19 = 28\\) and \\(10^1 = 10\\), which are not equal.\n- For \\(x = 2\\), we get \\(9^2 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100\\) and \\(10^2 = 100\\), which are equal. Thus, \\(x = 2\\) is a solution.\n\nTo check if there are other solutions, we analyze the behavior of the function \\(f(x) = 10^x - 9^x\\). \n\n- At \\(x = 1\\), \\(f(1) = 10 - 9 = "
