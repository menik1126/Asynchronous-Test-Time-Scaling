            "output": "To simplify the expression √(2.5² - 0.7²) divided by (2.7 - 2.5), I'll start by evaluating the squares in the numerator.\n\nFirst, I'll compute 2.5 squared, which is 6.25, and 0.7 squared, which is 0.49. Subtracting these gives 6.25 minus 0.49, resulting in 5.76.\n\nNext, I'll evaluate the denominator, 2.7 minus 2.5, which is 0.2.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to the square root of 5.76 divided by 0.2. The square root of 5.76 is 2.4, so the expression becomes 2.4 divided by 0.2.\n\nFinally, dividing 2.4 by 0.2 gives 12, which is the simplified result.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{2.5^2 - 0.7^2}}{2.7 - 2.5}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Squares in the Numerator**\n\n\\[\n2.5^2 = 6.25\n\\]\n\\[\n0.7^2 = 0.49\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{6.25 - 0.49} = \\sqrt{5.76}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Denominator**\n\n\\[\n2.7 - 2.5 = 0.2\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Expression**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{5.76}}{0.2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{5.76} = 2.4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{2.4}{0.2} = 12\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
