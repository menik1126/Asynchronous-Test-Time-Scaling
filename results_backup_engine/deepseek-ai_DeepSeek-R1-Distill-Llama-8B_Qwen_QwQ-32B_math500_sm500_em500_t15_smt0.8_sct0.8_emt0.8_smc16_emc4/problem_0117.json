            "output": "To determine the decimal equivalent of the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) in base eight, I will first convert it to decimal. This involves interpreting each binary digit as a power of two, starting from the rightmost bit with a value of \\(2^0\\).\n\nThe binary number has 11 digits, so the leftmost digit represents \\(2^{10}\\). I will calculate the value of each digit multiplied by its corresponding power of two and then sum all these values to get the final decimal number.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to its equivalent in base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between Binary and Octal:**\n   - Binary (base 2) is the foundation for octal (base 8). Each octal digit corresponds to three bits in binary.\n   - To convert from binary to octal, group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right.\n\n2. **Convert Binary to Octal:**\n   - The binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) has 11 digits.\n   - Split the binary number into groups of three from the right:\n     \\[\n     101\\; 010\\; 011\\; 10\n     \\]\n   - Each three-digit binary group can be converted to a single octal digit:\n     - \\(101_2 = 5_8\\)\n     - \\(010_2 = 2_8\\)\n     - \\(011_2 = 3_8\\)\n     - \\(10_2 = 2_8\\)\n\n3. **Construct the Octal Number:**\n   - Combine the octal digits obtained from each group:\n     \\[\n     5\\; 2\\; 3\\; 2_8\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\(10101001110_2 = 5232_8\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5232_8}\n\\]"
