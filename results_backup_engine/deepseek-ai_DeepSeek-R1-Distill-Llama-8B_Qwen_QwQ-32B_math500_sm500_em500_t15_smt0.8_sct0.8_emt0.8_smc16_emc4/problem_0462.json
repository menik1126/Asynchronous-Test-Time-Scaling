Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that for such problems, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be useful, but I'm not sure if that's the only way. Maybe there's a way using the AM-GM inequality?\n\nLet me start by expanding the expression we need to minimize: \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). If I expand this, it becomes \\(xy + y^2 + yz + xz\\). I'm not sure if that helps immediately, but maybe.\n\nThe constraint is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). That also looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can make a substitution or find some symmetry to simplify things.\n\nI notice that the constraint and the expression to minimize both involve \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), so perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the others. Let me see if setting \\(x = z\\) would help since the expression is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\). If I assume \\(x = z\\), then the constraint becomes \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\), and the expression becomes \\((x + y)^2\\). Hmm, maybe that can simplify things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can define some new variables to make the expressions more manageable. Let me denote \\(a = x + y + z\\), so the constraint becomes \\(xyz a = 1\\). Then, our expression is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). I wonder if I can express this in terms of \\(a\\) and something else.\n\nI know that \\(x + y + z = a\\), so \\(x + y = a - z\\) and \\(y + z = a - x\\). Therefore, \\((x + y)(y + z) = (a - z)(a - x)\\). Expanding this gives \\(a^2 - a(x + z) + xz\\). Hmm, not sure if this is helpful.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express \\(a\\) in terms of the given variables. Since \\(a = x + y + z"

Let me see if I can get a lower value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum occurs when two variables are equal? Let me suppose that \\(x = z\\). Let me try that approach again.\n\nLet \\(x = z\\). Then, the constraint becomes \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot x (x + y + x) = x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\). Let me denote \\(x = z\\), so the expression to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)^2\\).

Alternatively, let me set \\(u = x/y\\) and \\(v = z/y\\), so that variables are scaled by y. But since x = z, then v = u.

Then, substituting into the constraint:\n\n\\(x^2 y (2x + y) = (u^2 y^2) y (2 u y + y) = u^2 y^3 (y(2u + 1)) = u^2 y^4 (2u + 1) = 1\\).\n\nSo, \\(y^4 = 1 / [u^2 (2u"
