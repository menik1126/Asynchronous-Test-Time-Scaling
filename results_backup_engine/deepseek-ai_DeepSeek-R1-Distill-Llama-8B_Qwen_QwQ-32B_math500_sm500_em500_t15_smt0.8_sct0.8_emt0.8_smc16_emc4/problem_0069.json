Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that can divide both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\). Let me denote this gcd as \\(d\\), so \\(d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\).\n\nSince \\(d\\) divides both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\), it must also divide any linear combination of these two numbers. Maybe I can combine them in a way that helps me find \\(d\\).\n\nLet me try to eliminate \\(n\\) to make it easier. If I multiply the first equation by 2, I get \\(2(n + 7) = 2n + 14\\). Now, subtracting the second equation from this, I have:\n\n\\[\n2(n + 7) - (2n + 1) = (2n + 14) - (2n + 1)\n\\]\nSimplifying that:\n\\[\n2n + 14 - 2n - 1 = 13\n\\]\nSo, \\(d\\) must divide 13. That means the possible values for \\(d\\) are the divisors of 13. Since 13 is a prime number, its only positive divisors are 1 and 13.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) is 13. But wait, does there exist a positive integer \\(n\\) such that this gcd is actually 13? I should check that.\n\nIf \\(d = 13\\), then \\(13\\) must divide both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\). Let's express this as two congruences:\n\n1. \\(n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}\\) => \\(n \\equiv -7 \\pmod{13}\\). Since \\(-7\\) modulo 13 is the same as 6, \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\\"

            "output": ").\n\n2. \\(2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}\\) => \\(2n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}\\). Since \\(-1\\) modulo 13 is 12, \\(2n \\equiv 12 \\pmod{13}\\). Dividing both sides by 2 (which is invertible modulo 13 since gcd(2,13)=1), we get \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\\).\n\nSo, both congruences give \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\\), which means that there are integers \\(k\\) such that \\(n = 13k + 6\\). For example, if \\(k=0\\), \\(n=6\\). Let's test \\(n=6\\).\n\nCalculating \\(n + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13\\), and \\(2n + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\\). The gcd of 13 and 13 is 13, which confirms that for \\(n=6\\), the gcd is indeed 13.\n\nLet me just make sure there isn't a larger possible gcd. Since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13, so 13 is the maximum possible gcd. Therefore, the greatest possible value is 13.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) is found by considering linear combinations of the two numbers. By forming a combination that eliminates \\(n\\), we determine that the gcd must divide 13. Since 13 is prime, the maximum possible gcd is 13, achievable when \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{13}\n\\]"
