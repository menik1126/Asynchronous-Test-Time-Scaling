Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that if \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), then \\(\\omega\\) is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, and two others which are complex numbers. These are usually denoted as \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) and \\(\\omega^2 \\neq 1\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\omega\\) must satisfy the equation \\(x^3 - 1 = 0\\), which can be factored as \\((x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\\). Therefore, the non-real roots satisfy \\(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\\). Maybe I can use this quadratic equation to find some properties of \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\).\n\nSince \\(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0\\), I can rearrange this to find that \\(\\omega^2 = -\\omega - 1\\). That might come in handy later.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Let me write that down:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nI think it might help to combine these two fractions into a single fraction. To do that, I'll need a common denominator. The denominators are \\(1 + \\omega\\) and \\(1 + \\omega^2\\), so the common denominator will be \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\). Let's compute the numerator:\n\nNumerator = \\((1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)\\)\n\nWait, that's because when you have \\(\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d}\\), the combined fraction is \\(\\frac{a d + c b}{b d"

So, in this case:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega) = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nAnd the denominator is:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot 1 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega^2 = 1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + \\omega^3\n\\]\n\nBut wait, \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\) as given, so \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems interesting. The numerator and denominator are the same, so does that mean the expression equals 1? Wait, that can't be right because I thought there were different possible values depending on which cube root of unity \\(\\omega\\) is. But maybe I made a mistake in simplifying.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check:\n\nThe numerator after combining is \\(2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\), correct. The denominator is \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\), which calculates to \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\omega^3\\). Since \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), yes, that becomes \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\). So both numerator and denominator are indeed the same.\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to 1. So, regardless of which cube root of unity we choose, \\(\\omega\\) or \\(\\omega^2\\), the expression equals 1. So, all possible values are just 1.\n\nBut wait,"
