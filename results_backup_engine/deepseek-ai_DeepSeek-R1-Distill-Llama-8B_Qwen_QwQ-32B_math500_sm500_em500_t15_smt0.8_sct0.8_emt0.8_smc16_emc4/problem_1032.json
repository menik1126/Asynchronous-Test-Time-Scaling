The given polynomial is an eighth-degree polynomial, which can be quite complex, but maybe it can be factored into lower-degree polynomials. Since all the coefficients are integers and each factor must be monic, I might be able to factor it into quadratics or even quartic polynomials.\n\nLooking at the polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\), I notice that it resembles a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Let me rewrite it as \\( (x^4)^2 + 3(x^4) - 4 \\). This looks similar to a quadratic equation: \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Maybe I can factor it that way first, treating \\( x^4 \\) as a variable, say \\( y \\). \n\nLet's try factoring \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), we get \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nSo now, the original polynomial is factored into \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). \n\nNext, I notice that \\( x^4 - 1 \\) is a difference of squares, so it can be factored further. The difference of squares formula is \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) \\). Applying that here, where \\( a = x^2 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\), we get \\( (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\).\n\nSo now,"

It's similar to a sum of squares, which usually can't be factored over the reals, but maybe over the integers. Wait, actually, \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is known as a biquadratic polynomial and can be factored as a product of quadratics. Let me recall how that works.\n\nI remember that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored as \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\). Let me verify that by expanding:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\)\n= \\( x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 4 \\)\nWait, maybe I should do it step by step:\n\nMultiplying \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2) \\) and \\( (x^2 - 2x + 2) \\):\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\) with each term of the second polynomial:\n\\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\)\n\\( x^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3 \\)\n\\( x^2 * 2 = 2x^2 \\)\n\nNext, multiply 2x with each term:\n\\( 2x * x^2 = 2x^3 \\)\n\\( 2x * (-2x) = -4x^2 \\)\n\\( 2x * 2 = 4x \\)\n\nFinally, multiply 2 with each term:\n\\( 2 * x^2 = 2x^2 \\)\n\\( 2 * (-2x) = -4x \\)\n\\( 2 * 2 = 4 \\)\n\nNow, sum all these terms:\n\n\\( x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x +"

Maybe a smarter approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, since the original polynomial is a quadratic in \\( x^4 \\), perhaps factoring it as we did into \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\) was sufficient. Then, since \\( x^4 - 1 \\) can be factored into two quadratics, but \\( x^4 + 4 \\) required a more intricate factorization into two quadratics with cross terms.\n\nThus, combining all these, the factorization into irreducibles is as I did before. So, the sum is 10. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) factors into \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1) \\).
