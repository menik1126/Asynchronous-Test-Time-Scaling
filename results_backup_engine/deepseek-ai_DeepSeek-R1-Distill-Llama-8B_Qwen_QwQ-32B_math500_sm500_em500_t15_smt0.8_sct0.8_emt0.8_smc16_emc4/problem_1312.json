            "output": "Alright, so I came across this geometry probability problem, and it seems a bit tricky at first glance, but let me try to work through it step by step. The problem is about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices.\n\nFirst off, let me visualize the rectangle. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. The center O is the intersection point of the diagonals, so it's equidistant from all four vertices. The asy code provided also shows that A is at (-250,100), B at (250,100), C at (250,-100), and D at (-250,-100). So, O is at the origin (0,0). \n\nThe rectangle is such that AB is the length of the top side, and AD is the length of the left side. The ratio AB/AD is given as k. Let's denote AB as the length and AD as the width of the rectangle. So, if AB is along the x-axis and AD is along the y-axis, we can represent the rectangle with coordinates: A(-a, b), B(a, b), C(a, -b), D(-a, -b), where a and b are positive real numbers. The center O would then be at (0,0), and AB has length 2a, AD has length 2b. Therefore, the ratio k is (2a)/(2b) = a/b, so k = a/b. That means a = k*b.\n\nSo, the rectangle's sides are 2a and 2b, with a = k*b. Let me just note this down: length = 2a, width = 2b, with k = a/b.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. So, probability is the area where the condition is satisfied divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nHence, I need to find the region inside the rectangle where the distance from the point to O is less than the distance to each of the four vertices. \n\nLet me recall that the distance from a point (x,y) to a given point is calculated using the distance formula. So, the distance"

The distance to vertex A (-a, b) would be sqrt((x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2), and similarly for the other vertices.\n\nThe condition is that sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2) (distance to A), and also less than the distances to B, C, D. Since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe the regions where the point is closer to each vertex will form similar shapes, and the region closer to O will be the intersection of all the regions where it's closer to O than each vertex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the set of points closer to O than to any vertex is the Voronoi region around O with respect to the vertices. Voronoi diagrams partition the plane into regions based on proximity to each site (here, the vertices and the center). Since we have four vertices and the center, the region around O would be the set of points closer to O than to any vertex.\n\nTo find this region, I can set up inequalities for each vertex and find the intersection of all those inequalities. Let me start with one vertex, say A, and then see if the others can be handled similarly.\n\nFirst, let's write the inequality for the distance to O being less than the distance to A:\n\nsqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2)\n\nSquaring both sides (since both sides are non-negative):\n\nx² + y² < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n(x² + 2a x + a²) + (y² - 2b y + b²)\n\nSo, subtract left side from both sides:\n\n0 < 2a x + a² - 2b y + b²\n\nWait, actually, let me rearrange the inequality:\n\nx² + y² < x² + 2a x + a² + y² - 2b y + b²\n\nCancel out x² and y² terms:\n\n0 < 2a x + a² - 2b y + b²\n\nSo,\n\n2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0\n\nHmm, that's the inequality for being closer to O than to A.
