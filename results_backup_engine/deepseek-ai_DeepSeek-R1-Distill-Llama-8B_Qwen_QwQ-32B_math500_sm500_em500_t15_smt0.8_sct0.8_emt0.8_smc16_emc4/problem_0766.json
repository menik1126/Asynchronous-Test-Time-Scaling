The problem states that for every positive integer k, two things hold: first, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is a geometric progression, and second, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic progression. Also, we know that a_{13} is 2016, and we need to find a1.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. I need to figure out how the sequence is constructed. So, for every k, starting from 1, the terms at the odd indices and the next two terms form a geometric sequence, and then the next two terms form an arithmetic sequence. Interesting.\n\nLet me try to write out the first few terms in terms of a1, maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me denote k=1 first. Then, the subsequence a1, a2, a3 is geometric. That means a2 = a1 * r1, and a3 = a2 * r1, where r1 is the common ratio for the first geometric sequence. Similarly, the next subsequence for k=1 is a2, a3, a4, which is an arithmetic progression. So, in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Therefore, a3 - a2 = a4 - a3, so a4 = 2a3 - a2.\n\nGiven that, we can write a4 in terms of a2 and a3. But a3 is already a2 * r1, so a4 = 2*(a2 * r1) - a2 = (2r1 - 1)a2.\n\nWait, okay, but a2 is a1*r1, so let me express everything in terms of a1 and r1.\n\nSo:\n\na2 = a1 * r1\n\na3 = a2 * r1 = a1 * r1^2\n\na4 = (2r1 - 1) * a2 = (2r1 - 1)*a1*r1\n\nSimilarly, for k=2, the next geometric sequence is a3, a4, a5, which is geometric."

Let me see.\n\nWait, but the geometric sequence for k=2 is a_{2*2 -1}=a3, a4, a5. So, a4^2 = a3 * a5, since it's geometric. So, a5 = (a4)^2 / a3.\n\nSimilarly, the arithmetic sequence for k=2 is a4, a5, a6. So, a5 - a4 = a6 - a5, so a6 = 2a5 - a4.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can express each term in terms of previous terms and see if a pattern emerges?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a recursive relation here. Let me try to write down the terms step by step, using variables for the ratios and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with a1.\n\nLet me denote the geometric ratios for the odd-even-odd triplets as r1, r2, r3, etc. So for k=1, the geometric ratio is r1, so a2 = a1*r1, a3 = a2*r1 = a1*r1^2.\n\nThen, the arithmetic sequence a2, a3, a4 requires that a4 = 2a3 - a2. Substituting the expressions in terms of a1 and r1:\n\na4 = 2*(a1*r1^2) - a1*r1 = a1*(2r1^2 - r1)\n\nNow, moving to k=2, the next geometric triplet is a3, a4, a5.

Let me compute that:\n\nr2 = a4 / a3 = [a1*(2r1^2 - r1)] / [a1*r1^2] = (2r1^2 - r1)/r1^2 = (2r1 - 1)/r1\n\nTherefore, a5 = a4 * r2 = [a1*(2r1^2 - r1)] * [(2r1 - 1)/r1] = a1*(2r1^"
