Among them, the number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys.\n\nLet’s denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. According to the problem, G is a multiple of 13, so G can be 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since the total number of students is 35, G can’t exceed 35. This means G can only be 13 or 26 because 39 is too large.\n\nNext, we know that there are more girls than boys, which means G > B. Also, the sum of girls and boys equals 35, so G + B = 35.\n\nLet’s test G = 13 first. If G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. But this doesn’t satisfy G > B because 13 is not greater than 22. Therefore, G can't be 13.\n\nNow, let’s test G = 26. If G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. In this case, 26 is greater than 9, so it satisfies the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys attending the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- G = Number of girls\n- B = Number of boys\n\n**We know:**\n1. \\( G + B = 35 \\)\n2. \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13, so possible values for \\( G \\) are 13, 26, 39, etc.\n\n**Since the total number of students is 35:**\n- \\( G \\) can't be more than 35.\n- Possible values for \\( G \\): 13, 26.\n\n**Condition: \\( G > B \\):**\n- Since \\( G + B = 35 \\) → \\( B = 35 - G \\).\n- Substitute into the condition: \\( G > 35 - G \\).\n- Simplify: \\( 2G > 35 \\) → \\( G >"
