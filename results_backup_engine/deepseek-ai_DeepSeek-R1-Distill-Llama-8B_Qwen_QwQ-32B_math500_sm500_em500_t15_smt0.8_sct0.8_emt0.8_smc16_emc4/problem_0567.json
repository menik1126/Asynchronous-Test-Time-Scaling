            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here: there's a Senate committee with 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. They need to sit around a circular table, and the condition is that all members of each party must sit next to each other. Also, two seatings are considered the same if one can be rotated to get the other. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, circular permutations can be tricky because rotations are considered the same. I remember that for a circular arrangement without any restrictions, the number of ways to arrange n people is (n-1)! because rotating the entire group doesn't create a new arrangement. But here, we have a specific condition where each party must sit together. So, it's more like arranging blocks of people around the table.\n\nLet me break it down. We have three parties: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent. Each party needs to be seated together as a block. So, essentially, we can think of each party as a single \"super person\" or a block. That means instead of 11 individuals, we have 3 blocks to arrange around the table. Wait, but it's a circular table, so how does that affect things?\n\nFor circular arrangements where we have blocks, I think the number of ways to arrange the blocks is (number of blocks - 1)! So, with 3 blocks, it should be (3-1)! which is 2! = 2 ways. But hold on, is that all? No, probably not. Because within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves.\n\nSo, for each party block, the number of ways to arrange the members is the factorial of the number of members in that party. For Democrats, there are 5, so 5! ways. Similarly, Republicans have 5, so another 5! ways. The Independent is just 1 person, so only 1! way. But wait, since they are sitting around a table, do we need to adjust for rotations within each block? Hmm, no, because each block is a linear arrangement within itself, but since they're sitting together around a circular table, maybe it's different.\n\nWait a minute, no, because within the block, each party is sitting in a linear order relative to the table. Since the entire table is circular, but the blocks are treated as linear once you fix a starting point."

            "output": " Wait, actually, when arranging the blocks around the table, the rotation of the entire table is already accounted for by fixing the position of one block. So maybe the blocks can be arranged in (number of blocks -1)! ways, and then multiplied by the permutations within each block.\n\nLet me confirm that. Let's say we have three blocks: D, R, I. Since it's a circular table, arranging them in a circle would normally be (3-1)! = 2 ways. Then, for each of those arrangements, the Democrats can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways, Republicans in 5! ways, and the Independent has only 1 way. So total arrangements would be 2 * 5! * 5! * 1. But wait, is that all?\n\nHold on, but the Independent is a single person. So their block is just themselves, so there's no permutation within that block. So that part is okay. But let me think again about the blocks. Since the table is circular, when we fix the position of one block to account for rotational symmetry, then the other blocks can be arranged relative to it. So, if we fix the position of the Democrats block, then the Republicans and Independent can be arranged in 2! ways (since there are two remaining blocks). Wait, but actually, the number of blocks is three, so fixing one block leaves two blocks to arrange, so that would be 2!.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for circular permutations with blocks is (number of blocks -1)! multiplied by the product of the permutations within each block. So yes, that would be (3-1)! * 5! * 5! * 1!.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements would be 2! * 5! * 5!.\n\nBut let me check if there's something I'm missing here. The problem mentions that all members of each party must sit next to each other. Since the Independent is only one person, they just have to be seated such that their \"block\" is just themselves. So that's okay. \n\nWait, but another thought: when arranging the blocks around the table, does the Independent's position affect anything? Since they are a single block, they can be placed between any two parties. But since we're considering rotations as equivalent, fixing one block's position should handle that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Independent is a single block, so the three blocks"

So yes, total is 2 * 5! * 5!.\n\nBut let me consider another angle. Suppose we had all 11 seats arranged around the table. Normally, for a circular permutation, it's (n-1)! So here, n=11, so it's 10! ways. But with the restrictions, the number is much less.\n\nBut in our case, each party is a block, so we can model it as three blocks: D, R, I. So arranging these blocks around the table. Since it's circular, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is (number of blocks -1)! = 2! = 2. Then, for each block, the internal arrangements: D can be arranged in 5!, R in 5!, I in 1!.\n\nTherefore, total arrangements: 2 * 5! * 5!.\n\nWait, that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me think about the rotation within the blocks. For instance, in the Democrats block, each rotation would be a different seating, but since we've already accounted for the rotation of the entire table by fixing one block, does rotating within the block count as a new arrangement?\n\nWait, no. Because once we fix the position of a block, rotations within that block are already considered in the internal permutations. So, for example, if we fix the Democrats in a certain order, any rotation within their block is just a different permutation, which is accounted for by the 5! factor.\n\nSo, yes, I think my initial reasoning is correct. The number of ways is 2 * 5! * 5! * 1!.\n\nLet me compute that. 5! is 120, so 120 * 120 = 14,400. Multiply by 2 gives 28,800. So the total number of ways is 28,800.\n\nBut hold on, could the Independent block's position affect the total? Because the Independent is a single person, they can be placed in between any two other blocks, but since we have a circular table, any placement is equivalent up to rotation.\n\nWait, but in the calculation above, we fixed the position of one block, say"

Alternatively, if the Independent was between two parties, but since they are a single block, their placement is just as a single unit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an issue with the Independent being a single person. Let me think again. Suppose the three blocks are D, R, and I. The Independent is a block of size 1. So when arranging the blocks around the table, the number of arrangements is (3-1)! = 2. Then, the internal arrangements are 5! for D, 5! for R, and 1! for I. So that's still 2 * 5! *5!.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Independent can be considered as not affecting the block arrangement? Hmm, no, they are a separate block. So I think that's okay.\n\nWait, but another thought: in some problems, when you have a block of size 1, sometimes you have to consider if it's distinguishable from the others. But here, since the Independent is a separate party, they are a distinct block. So, the calculation should still hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the Independent can be placed anywhere, but since the table is circular, the number of arrangements is still (3-1)!.\n\nHmm, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nSuppose we first consider the three blocks as entities. To arrange them around a circular table, the number of ways is (3-1)! = 2. Then, for each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. Since the Democrats have 5 members, that's 5! ways, same for Republicans, and the Independent has only 1 way. So total arrangements are 2 * 5! *5!.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 2*(5!)^2. Let me compute that numerically to check.\n\n5! is 120, so 120*120 = 14,400. Multiply by 2 gives 28,800. So 28,800 ways.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a different interpretation. For example, maybe the Independent can be considered as part of a party? But the"

So they form their own block.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we thought of the Independent as merging with one party or something, but no, the problem says each party, so the Independent is a separate party.\n\nWait, but what if the Independent is not considered a party? No, the problem says \"the members of each party\", so since the Independent is their own party, their block is just themselves.\n\nSo, to recap: three blocks: D, R, I. Arrange them around a circular table in (3-1)! = 2 ways. Then, within D: 5!, within R: 5!, within I:1. So total is 2*(5!)^2 = 2*120*120 = 28,800.\n\nI think that's correct. So I'll go with that as the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we treat each party as a single block. Since the table is circular, we first arrange the blocks, which can be done in \\((3-1)! = 2!\\) ways. Within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the 5 Democrats, there are \\(5!\\) arrangements, and similarly for the 5 Republicans. The Independent, being a single person, has only \\(1!\\) arrangement. \n\nThus, the total number of ways is:\n\\[\n2! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1! = 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 = 28,800\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{28800}"
