            "output": "To simplify the expression √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3 into the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, I first consider each term individually.\n\nFor the √2 and 1/√2 terms, multiplying numerator and denominator by √2 to rationalize the denominator gives (√2)^2/√2 = 2/√2, which simplifies to √2. Similarly, 1/√2 becomes √2/2.\n\nFor the √3 and 1/√3 terms, multiplying numerator and denominator by √3 to rationalize the denominator gives √3, which remains as √3, and 1/√3 becomes √3/3.\n\nCombining all the simplified terms, the expression becomes √2 + √3 + √2/2 + √3/3.\n\nNext, I combine the like terms. Grouping the coefficients of √2 and √3 separately, I have (√2 + √2/2) + (√3 + √3/3).\n\nTo add these, I find a common denominator for the coefficients. For √2, the common denominator is 2, so √2 is 2√2/2. Adding 2√2/2 and √2/2 gives 3√2/2.\n\nFor √3, the common denominator is 3, so √3 is 3√3/3. Adding 3√3/3 and √3/3 gives 4√3/3.\n\nCombining both results, the expression simplifies to (3√2/2 + 4√3/3).\n\nTo combine these fractions into a single expression, I find a common denominator for the denominators 2 and 3, which is 6. Multiplying the first fraction by 3/3 and the second by 2/2, I get (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nFinally, I identify a, b, and c from the simplified form. Here, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Adding these values together gives a + b + c = 23.\n</think>\n\nLet's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Step"
