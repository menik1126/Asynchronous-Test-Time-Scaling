            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). The answer needs to be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is square-free, meaning it's not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find a + b.\n\nAlright, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. So, if I have a point (x, y), the distance D from the origin (0, 0) is given by the formula:\n\nD = sqrt((x - 0)² + (y - 0)²) = sqrt(x² + y²)\n\nSo, I need to minimize this distance D. Since the square root function is a monotonically increasing function, I can instead minimize D squared, which is x² + y². This might be easier because I can use calculus to find the minimum value.\n\nGiven that y is a function of x, I can substitute y into the distance formula. Let's do that.\n\nSo, y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Let's plug this into D squared:\n\nD² = x² + y² = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²\n\nLet me simplify that. First, let's square the second term:\n\n[(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nSo, D² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nNow, I need to expand (x² - 3)². Let me do that:\n\n(x² - 3)² = x⁴ - 6x² + 9\n\nSo, plugging that back in:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9) = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + 9/2\n\nLet me combine like terms. The x² terms: 1x² - 3x² = -2x². And then the constant term is 9/2.\n\nSo,"

            "output": " D² = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nNow, this is a function of x. Let's denote this as f(x):\n\nf(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nTo find the minimum, I can take the derivative f'(x), set it to zero, and solve for x. Then, check if it's a minimum.\n\nLet's compute f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [ (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2 ] = (1/2)*4x³ - 4x + 0 = 2x³ - 4x\n\nSo, f'(x) = 2x³ - 4x\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n2x³ - 4x = 0\n\nFactor out a 2x:\n\n2x(x² - 2) = 0\n\nSo, solutions are x = 0, or x² - 2 = 0 --> x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2)\n\nNow, I need to find which of these gives the minimum distance. Let me evaluate f(x) at these critical points.\n\nFirst, at x = 0:\n\nf(0) = (1/2)(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, D² = 9/2, so D = 3/sqrt(2)\n\nBut let me check the other points.\n\nAt x = sqrt(2):\n\nf(sqrt(2)) = (1/2)(sqrt(2))^4 - 2(sqrt(2))^2 + 9/2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(sqrt(2))^4 = (2)^2 = 4\n\nSo, (1/2)(4) = 2\n\n-2*(sqrt(2))^2 = -2*(2) = -4\n\nSo, 2 - 4 + 9/2 = (-2) + 9/2 = ( -4/2 + 9/2 ) = 5/2\n\nSimilarly, at x = -sqrt(2), since all the terms are even powers, the function is the same. So, f(-sqrt(2)) is also"

To simplify that:\n\nsqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2\n\nWait, let me see. sqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(5)/sqrt(2), but to rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):\n\nsqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) = sqrt(10)/2\n\nYes, so sqrt(5/2) is sqrt(10)/2.\n\nNow, the problem states that the smallest distance can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one, meaning a is square-free.\n\nIn sqrt(10)/2, a is 10 and b is 2. Now, 10 is square-free because its prime factors are 2 and 5, neither of which is squared.\n\nHence, the expression is sqrt(10)/2, so a = 10 and b = 2.\n\nTherefore, a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe using the distance formula and minimizing. Alternatively, if I think geometrically, the minimal distance from the origin to the graph is the minimal value of the function y(x), but weighted by the distance formula.\n\nWait, another way is to consider that the minimal distance from a point to a curve is along the line perpendicular to the tangent of the curve at that point.\n\nBut I think using calculus as I did is more straightforward.\n\nLet me verify the computation where I plugged in x = sqrt(2). Let me do that again.\n\nx = sqrt(2):\n\nx² = (sqrt(2))² = 2\n\ny = (1/√2)(2 - 3) = (1/√2)(-1) = -1/√2\n\nSo, y² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2\n\nSo, D² = x² + y² = 2 +"

So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nHmm, but let me check if there's another critical point or if I missed something.\n\nWait, when I took the derivative, I had f'(x) = 2x³ - 4x. Setting to zero gives 2x³ -4x =0, so 2x(x² - 2)=0, so x=0 or x= sqrt(2), x=-sqrt(2). So that's correct.\n\nThen, evaluating f(x) at x= sqrt(2) gives 5/2, which is less than at x=0. So that's the minimum. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2) which is sqrt(10)/2, so a=10, b=2, so a+b=12.\n\nWait, but let me check if sqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(a)/b with a square-free. Since 5/2 is already in simplest terms, so sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) is equivalent to sqrt(10)/2, so yes, that's the way to write it with a rational denominator. So, sqrt(10)/2 is the form they want, so a=10, b=2. So, 10+2=12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of f(sqrt(2))?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate f(sqrt(2)) again step by step:\n\nf(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nx = sqrt(2):\n\nx⁴ = (sqrt(2))^4 = (2)^2 = 4\n\nSo, (1/2)x⁴ = (1/2)*4 = 2\n\n-2x² = -2*(2) = -4\n\n+9/2 is +4.5\n\nSo, 2 -4 +4.5 = (2 -4) = -2 +4.5 = 2.5, which is 5/2. Correct.\n\nSo"

            "output": ", D² is 5/2, so D is sqrt(5/2). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe another method: using vectors.\n\nThe distance from origin to the point (x, y) is the magnitude of the vector (x, y). To minimize this magnitude, we can use the concept that the vector (x, y) is perpendicular to the gradient of the function y at that point.\n\nWait, because the minimal distance occurs along the direction of the gradient, but I think that's similar to solving for where the line from origin is perpendicular to the curve. Hmm.\n\nThe gradient of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3) is dy/dx, which is (1/√2)(2x) = sqrt(2)x.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at any point is sqrt(2)x.\n\nThe line from the origin (0,0) to the point (x, y) has slope y/x.\n\nFor the minimal distance, the line from the origin to (x, y) must be perpendicular to the tangent line at (x, y). So, the product of their slopes must be -1.\n\nSo, (sqrt(2)x) * (y/x) = -1\n\nBut since y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), let's plug that in:\n\nsqrt(2)x * [(1/√2)(x² - 3)/x] = -1\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nsqrt(2)x * [ (1/√2)(x² - 3) / x ] = sqrt(2)x * [ (x² - 3)/(√2 x) ) ] = sqrt(2) * (x² - 3)/√2 * (x / x ) )\n\nWait, the x in numerator and denominator will cancel, right?\n\nSo, we have sqrt(2) times (x² - 3) over sqrt(2) times 1. So, sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) = 1. So, this simplifies to (x² - 3) = -1\n\nSo, x² -3 = -1 --> x² = 2 --> x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, that gives x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2), as"
