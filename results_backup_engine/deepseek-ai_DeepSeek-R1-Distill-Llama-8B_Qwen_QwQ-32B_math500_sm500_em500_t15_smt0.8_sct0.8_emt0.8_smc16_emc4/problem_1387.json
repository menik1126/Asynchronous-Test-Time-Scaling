The matrix M is given by its action on two vectors: it takes the vector [2, -1] to [9, 3] and the vector [1, -3] to [7, -1]. \n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out what the matrix M looks like. Since M is a linear transformation, it can be represented as a 2x2 matrix. To find this matrix, I can set up a system of equations based on the given transformations.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\\[ \nM = \\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhen M acts on the vector [2, -1], it results in [9, 3]. So, applying the matrix multiplication:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9  \nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, when M acts on the vector [1, -3], it results in [7, -1]. So:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7  \nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nNow, I have four equations:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9  \n2. 2c - d = 3  \n3. a - 3b = 7  \n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c, d. Let me take equations 1 and 3 first. \n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9  \nLet me solve for b: b = 2a - 9\n\nPlugging this into equation 3: a - 3*(2a - 9) = 7  \nSimplify: a - 6a + 27 = 7  \nCombine like terms: -5a + 27 = 7  \nSubtract 27: -5a = -20  \nDivide by -5: a = 4\n\nNow, plug a = 4 into b = 2a - 9: b = 8 - 9 = -1\n\nSo, b = -1 and a = 4.\n\nNow, moving to equations 2 and 4 for c and d.\n\n"

Alternatively, I can parameterize the original line and then apply M to each point or find the equation of the image.\n\nAlternatively, another method: since y = 2x + 1 is a line, and we can represent it parametrically. Let me use parameter t.\n\nLet me set x = t, then y = 2t + 1. So a general point on the line is (t, 2t + 1).\n\nThen, applying the transformation M to this point:\n\nM * [t; 2t+1] = [4t - (2t + 1); 2t + (2t + 1)]\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: 4t - 2t - 1 = 2t - 1  \nSecond component: 2t + 2t + 1 = 4t + 1\n\nSo, the transformed point is (2t - 1, 4t + 1). \n\nNow, to express this as a line, I need to eliminate the parameter t.\n\nLet me solve for t in the first component: t = (2t - 1 + 1)/2 = (2t)/2 = t. Hmm, maybe"

Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, since M is a linear transformation, the image of a line under M should also be a line, and since the original line isn't invariant (I don't think so), the image should be a different line.\n\nAlternatively, consider another point on the original line. When x = 0, y = 1, so the point (0, 1) is on the line. Let's transform this point with M:\n\nM * [0; 1] = [0*4 + 1*(-1); 0*2 + 1*1] = [-1; 1]\n\nSo, the point (-1, 1) is on the image line.\n\nAnother point on the original line: when x = 1, y = 3, so the point (1, 3) is on the line. Transforming (1, 3):\n\nM * [1; 3] = [4*1 + (-1)*3; 2*1 + 1*3] = [4 - 3; 2 + 3] = [1; 5]\n\nSo, the point (1, 5) is on the image line.\n\nNow, I have two points on the image line: (-1, 1) and (1, 5). Let me find the equation of the line passing through these two points.\n\nFirst, compute the slope:\n\nm = (5 - 1)/(1 - (-1)) = 4/2 = 2\n\nSo, the slope is 2. Now, using point-slope form with point (-1, 1):\n\nY - 1 = 2(X - (-1)) => Y - 1 = 2(X + 1) => Y ="

So same result.\n\nTherefore, the image of the line y = 2x +1 under the transformation M is y = 2x +3.\n\nWait a minute, but hold on, let me check with my parametric approach again. The parametrization gave me Y = 2X +3, so that's consistent. The problem is solved then? Hmmm, but let me just confirm with another point.\n\nTake x = 2 on original line: y would be 5, so point (2,5). Wait, wait, original line equation is y=2x +1. If x=2, then y=5, so (2,5) is indeed on the line. Applying M:\n\nM*(2,5):\n\n4*2 + (-1)*5 = 8 -5 =3  \n2*2 +1*5 =4 +5=9  \nWait, so transformed point is (3,9). \n\nCheck whether (3,9) lies on the line y=2x +3. Substitute x=3: y=2*3+3=9. Yes, so that works.\n\nWait, another point: x = -1. Then original point would be ( -1, 2*(-1)+1= -2+1= -1). Wait, so point (-1, -1). Hmm, sorry let me confirm:\n\nWait, original line is y=2x+1. So if x = -1, then y = 2*(-1)+1 = -2+1 = -1. So the point (-1, -1). Applying M to this point:\n\nM*(-1, -1)= [4*(-1) + (-1)*(-1); 2*(-1) +1*(-1)] = (-4 +1 ; -2 -1)= (-3; -3). \n\nCheck if (-3, -3) lies on y=2x +3. 2*(-3)+3= -6+3= -3.
