For (1 - i), a is 1 and b is -1.\n\nCalculating the absolute value of (1 - i) gives sqrt(1² + (-1)²) = sqrt(2).\n\nNext, I'll use the property that |z^n| = |z|^n. Therefore, |(1 - i)^8| = (sqrt(2))^8.\n\nSimplifying (sqrt(2))^8 involves raising sqrt(2) to the power of 8. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), raising it to the 8th power gives 2^( (1/2)*8 ) = 2^4 = 16.\n\nSo, the final answer is 16.\n</think>\n\nRingo needs to calculate \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\). Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Absolute Value of a Complex Number**:\n   - For any complex number \\(a + bi\\), the absolute value (or modulus) is given by:\n     \\[\n     |a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(1 - i\\) can be written as \\(1 + (-1)i\\), where \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = -1\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Absolute Value of \\(1 - i\\)**:\n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Property of Absolute Values to Powers**:\n   - The property states that \\(|z^n| = |z|^n\\).\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\)**:\n   - \\(\\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\\).\n   - Raising it to"
