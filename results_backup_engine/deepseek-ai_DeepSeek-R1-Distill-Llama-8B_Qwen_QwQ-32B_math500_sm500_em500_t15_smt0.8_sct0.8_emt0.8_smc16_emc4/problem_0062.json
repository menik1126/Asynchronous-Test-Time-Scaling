            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, let me make sure I understand the question correctly. They have a table with four grades: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. For each grade, they surveyed 300 males and 300 females, right? So, each grade has 300 males and 300 females, but the percentage of each group that uses the bus varies.\n\nWait, actually, the table shows the percent of bus riders in each grade for both males and females. So, for each grade, like 9th grade, 41.1% of males and 39.4% of females are bus riders. So, the actual number of bus riders would be 300 males * 41.1% and 300 females * 39.4%, right? \n\nSo, the question is asking for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. That means I need to calculate for each grade, the number of male bus riders, the number of female bus riders, and then see if male is approximately 1.35 times (135%) the female. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the question says \"closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders.\" So, males should be roughly 1.35 times females. So, if I compute male / female, it should be closest to 1.35 for that grade.\n\nWait, but actually, 135% means that male is 135% of female, so male = 1.35 * female. So, we can compute male / female ratio and see which grade is closest to 1.35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders and see if it's closest to 1.35. Let me check.\n\nSo, for each grade, I can compute:\n\nMales bus riders = 300 * (percentage given)\nFemales bus riders = 300 * (percentage given)\nThen, ratio = males / females\nWe need the ratio closest to 1.35.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate (males / females) and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nSo, let's go through each grade one by one.\n\nStarting"

Let's see, 0.4*300 is 120, so subtract 0.006*300 which is 1.8, so 120 - 1.8 = 118.2 females.\n\nSo, the ratio is 123.3 / 118.2 ≈ let's compute that. Let me do 123.3 divided by 118.2. Let's see, 118.2 * 1.04 = 118.2 + 4.728 = 122.928, which is close to 123.3. So, 1.04 would give about 122.928, so the actual ratio is a bit higher. Let me compute 123.3 / 118.2:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 1.182 to simplify? Maybe not. Let me just do straight division. 118.2 goes into 123.3 once, with a remainder of 5.1. So, 1.04 (since 118.2 * 0.04 = 4.728). So, 1.04 gives 122.928, so 123.3 - 122.928 = 0.372. So, 0.372 / 118.2 ≈ 0.00315. So total ratio is approximately 1.04315. So, about 1.043. That's 104.3%, which is not very close to 135%.\n\nHmm, so 9th grade's"

So, 103.2 - 102.369 ≈ 0.831. So, 0.831 / 99.3 ≈ 0.00836. So, the ratio is approximately 1.038. So, about 103.8%. Again, way below 135%. \n\nHmm, 10th grade is still low.

Let me compute that. 41.4 * 1.5 = 62.1, which is a bit more than 61.8. So, let me compute 41.4 * 1.48 = ?\n\nWait, 41.4 * 1 = 41.4\n\n41.4 * 0.4 = 16.56\n\n41.4 * 0.08 = 3.312\n\nSo, 1.48 would be 41.4 + 16.56 + 3.312 = 41.4 + 19.872 = 61.272.\n\nHmm, 1.48 gives 61.272, which is less than 61.8. So, 61.8 - 61.272 = 0.528.\n\nSo, 0.528 / 41.4 ≈ 0.01278.\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 1.48 + 0"

But this is 49% higher, so not as close.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the difference between the ratio and 1.35.\n\nSo, for 11th grade, the ratio is approximately 1.4928, which is about 0.1528 above 1.35. So, 149% ratio, 15.28% difference.\n\nLet's check 12th grade.\n\n12th grade:\n\nMales: 11.6% of 300 = 0.116 * 300 = 34.8 males.\n\nFemales: 8.6% of 300 = 0.086 * 300 = 25.8 females.\n\nSo, ratio is 34.8 / 25.8. Let's compute that.\n\n25.8 * 1.35 = let me compute 25.8 + (25.8 * 0.35). \n\n25.8 * 0.35: 25 * 0.35 = 8.75, 0.8 * 0.35 = 0.28, so total 8.75 + 0.28 = 9.03.\n\nSo, 25.8 + 9.03 = 34.83. \n\nSo, 25.8 * 1.35 = 34.83. So, 34.8 divided by 25.8 is approximately 1.35. Because 34.8 is almost exactly 1.35 times 25.8.\n\nSo, 34.8 / 25.8 = 1.35. Exactly. So, the ratio is 1.35, which is exactly 135%. So, that's the grade we're looking for.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nMales: 11.6% of 300 is 34.8, right?\n\nYes, because 10% is 30, 1.6% is 4.8, so total 34.8.\n\nFemales: 8.6% of 300 is 25"

So, 25.8 * 1.35 is 34.83, so 34.8 is 34.83 rounded to one decimal place, so that's 1.35 times.\n\nSo, indeed, for 12th grade, males are exactly 135% of females, which is the closest.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake with the earlier grades.\n\nWait, for 11th grade, I had 61.8 / 41.4 ≈ 1.493, which is around 1.49, which is about 49% higher than 1.35.\n\nIn 12th grade, it's exactly 1.35, which is 35%.\n\nWait, but the question says \"closest to 135%\", so 1.35 is the target. So, if a grade has exactly that, then that's the closest. But perhaps I should check whether any other grade is closer.\n\nWait, but 12th grade is exactly 1.35, so that's perfect.\n\nWait, but let me think: the question says \"the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders\". So, it's looking for when male = 1.35 * female. So, 12th grade is exactly that. So, that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check 11th grade again. 1.493 is 1.35 + 0.153, so about a 11.3% difference. While 12th grade is exactly 1.35, so zero difference. Therefore, 12th grade is closer.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 12th grade, the male is 34.8, female is 25.8. 34.8 is 135% of 25.8, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the numbers in the table: 12th grade males 11.6%, females 8.6%.

The slight difference is because 11.6% and 8.6% might be rounded percentages. Wait, but the problem says \"the percent of bus riders in a survey of Central H.S. students; 300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed.\" So, the percentages are exact? Or are they rounded?\n\nHmm, the percentages are given to one decimal place, so they might be rounded. But since the question is asking for which grade is closest, even if there's a slight rounding, the 12th grade is exactly on the mark. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the 11th grade again. The ratio was 1.493, which is 149.3%, so that's 14.3% above 135%. Whereas 12th grade is exactly 135%, so that's the closest. \n\nWait, but let me check the 10th grade again.
