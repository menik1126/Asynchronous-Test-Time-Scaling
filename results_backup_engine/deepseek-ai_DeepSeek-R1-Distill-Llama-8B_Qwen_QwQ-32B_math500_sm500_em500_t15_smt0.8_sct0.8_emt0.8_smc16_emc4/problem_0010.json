            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Hmm, monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So P(x) should look something like x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are some constants I need to find.\n\nThe problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when it's divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, I know that P(0) = 5. I need to find P(5).\n\nFirst, let me recall the Remainder Theorem. When a polynomial is divided by a linear divisor (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But here, we're dealing with quadratic divisors, so the remainder should be a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) is a linear polynomial, let's say R(x) = mx + n.\n\nSo, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is a quadratic, the remainder R(x) can be written as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x).\n\nSimilarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x):\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x).\n\nSince R(x) is linear, I can use the Remainder Factor Theorem generalized for quadratic divisors. That is, for the first division, setting x = 1 and x = 4 should give me R(1) and R(4). Similarly, for the second division, setting x = 2 and x = 3 should give me (2R(2)) and (2R(3)).\n\nWait, no. Actually, for the second division, the remainders are 2R(x). So, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), which is still linear. So P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3). That makes sense because if we plug x=2 and x=3 into"

P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n3. P(2) = 2R(2)\n4. P(3) = 2R(3)\n\nI also know that P(0) = 5. Since R(x) is mx + n, I can express R(1), R(2), R(3), R(4) as m(1) + n, m(2) + n, m(3) + n, m(4) + n.\n\nSo, let me note the equations:\n\nFrom P(1) = R(1):\n1.

P(3) = 2(m(3) + n) = 2(3m + n) = 6m + 2n.\n\nNow, I need expressions for P(1), P(4), P(2), and P(3). Since P(x) is a monic cubic polynomial, let's write it down:\n\nP(x) = x³ + a x² + b x + c.\n\nSo, plugging in the x-values:\n\nP(1) = 1 + a + b + c.\n\nP(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + c.\n\nP(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + c.\n\nP(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + c.\n\nSo now, I can write the equations substituting these into the previous equations.\n\nEquation 1: 1 + a + b + c = m + n.\n\nEquation 2: 64"
