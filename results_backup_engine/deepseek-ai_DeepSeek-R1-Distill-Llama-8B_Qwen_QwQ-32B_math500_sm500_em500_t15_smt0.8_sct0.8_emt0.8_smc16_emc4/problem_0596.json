The circle is given by the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\) and the parabola is \\( y^2 = 8x \\). \n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the circle and the parabola are tangent to each other. Since both are symmetric with respect to the x-axis, I can probably just find the points of tangency in the upper half and then mirror them to the lower half. That should give me the four points needed for the quadrilateral.\n\nLet me recall that the equation of a tangent line to a parabola can be written in the form \\( y = mx + c \\). For the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\), I think the slope form of the tangent is \\( y = mx + \\frac{4}{m} \\). Let me verify that.\n\nWait, the standard form of a parabola that opens to the right is \\( y^2 = 4ax \\). Comparing that to our equation \\( y^2 = 8x \\), we have \\( 4a = 8 \\), so \\( a = 2 \\). The slope of the tangent in slope form is \\( y = mx + \\frac{a}{m} \\), which in this case becomes \\( y = mx + \\frac{2}{m} \\). Okay, so that's correct.\n\nNow, since this tangent line is also tangent to the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\), the distance from the center of the circle (which is at (0,0)) to the line must equal the radius of the circle. The radius is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nThe formula for the distance from a point \\( (x_0, y_0) \\) to the line \\( Ax + By + C = 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \\).\n\nFirst, let's write the tangent line in the standard form. The equation is \\( y = mx + \\frac{2}{m} \\). To convert this into standard form, subtract y from both sides: \\( mx - y + \\frac{"

I think I remember that for a parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\), the equation of the tangent can be written as \\( y = mx + \\frac{a}{m} \\). But let's make sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can parametrize the parabola. Let me try parametrizing the parabola.\n\nFor a parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\), parametric equations can be written as \\( x = 2t^2 \\), \\( y = 4t \\), since plugging into the equation gives \\( (4t)^2 = 16t^2 = 8*(2t^2) = 16t^2 \\). Yes, that works.\n\nSo, any point on the parabola can be written as (2t^2, 4t). Then, the slope of the tangent at that point can be found by differentiating the parabola equation.\n\nDifferentiate \\( y^2 = 8x \\) implicitly:\n\n\\( 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 8 \\) => \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{4}{y} \\). \n\nSo, at the point (2t^2, 4t), the slope is \\( \\frac{4}{4t} = \\frac{1}{t} \\).

Let me check if those points lie on the parabola and the tangent lines.\n\nWait, (2,4) is on the parabola since 4^2 = 16 = 8*2 = 16. So that's good. Let's see if (2,4) is on the tangent line y = x + 2. Plugging in x=2, y = 4, so 4 = 2 + 2, which is true. Similarly, (2,-4) would be on the line y = -x -2: y = -2 -2 = -4, so that works too. \n\nWait, but then the tangent lines at (2,4) and (2,-4) are y = x + 2 and y = -x -2.

So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the circle and the parabola having four common tangents, which are two in each branch. Wait, the circle is centered at the origin with radius sqrt(2) (~1.414), and the parabola opens to the right. So, the circle might intersect the parabola at two points on the right, and have two other tangents on the left. But according to the Asymptote code, the points of tangency are at x = -1 for two points, which is inside the circle. So perhaps they are not on the parabola but the tangents touch both the circle and the parabola.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because the parabola is y^2 = 8x, which is only defined for x >=0. So, x = -1 is not on the parabola. So, perhaps the Asymptote code is incorrect? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the Asymptote code is simplifying the points. Let me look again. The Asymptote code draws the circle of radius sqrt(2), which is about 1.414. Then, it's drawing two parabolas, but they are only the upper and lower halves, from 0 to 3. Maybe the tangents are at (2,4) and (2,-4), and also (-1,1) and (-1,-1), but these latter points are not on the parabola. Wait, maybe I need to find all the common tangents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the circle and parabola have four common tangent lines: two on the right, which touch the parabola at (2,4) and (2,-4), and two on the left, which are imaginary because the circle is inside the parabola on the left? But that doesn't make sense because the circle is centered at the origin with radius ~1.414, so it extends from x = -1.414 to 1.414 on the x-axis. The parabola at x = -1.414 has y^2 ="

This line must also be tangent to the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\). \n\nThe condition for tangency to the circle is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line equals the radius sqrt(2). \n\nThe distance formula gives:\n\n\\( \\frac{|0 - 0 + \\frac{2}{m}|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nWait, hold on, the line equation is \\( y = mx + \\frac{2}{m} \\), so rearranged, it's \\( mx - y + \\frac{2}{m} = 0 \\).

Maybe I should consider that the line can be vertical or horizontal, but for the parabola y^2=8x, the axis is horizontal, so vertical lines would only touch it at one point, but in the case of a circle, a vertical line could be tangent or secant.\n\nWait, let's check if a vertical line can be tangent to both the circle and the parabola.\n\nA vertical line is x = a. \n\nFor the parabola y^2 =8x, x = a intersects it at y = ±sqrt(8a). For x = a to be tangent to the parabola, there must be exactly one solution, which only occurs if a is negative, but since the parabola only exists for x >=0, a negative a would mean no real points. So no vertical tangent lines intersecting the parabola.\n\nSimilarly, horizontal lines for the parabola: y = k. Intersecting parabola: y = k, so k^2 = 8x, so x = k^2 /8. So for a horizontal line to be tangent to the parabola, the line must touch only one point, which only occurs if the line does not intersect the parabola, but for y = k and parabola y^2=8x, it will always intersect at x = k^2 /8, which is one point only?

So the quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral with vertices at A, B, D, C.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the quadrilateral as two triangles or use the shoelace formula. Let me use the shoelace formula with the coordinates.\n\nBut first, I need to order the points in a sequential order around the quadrilateral. Let me list them in order: A(-1,1), B(2,4), D(2,-4), C(-1,-1), back to A.\n\nSo:\n\nA: (-1,1)\n\nB: (2,4)\n\nD: (2,-4)\n\nC: (-1,-1)\n\nA: (-1,1)\n\nNow, apply the shoelace formula:\n\nCompute the sum of x_i y_{i+1} and subtract sum of y_i x_{i+1}.\n\nCompute the terms:\n\nx_A y_B = (-1)(4) = -4\n\nx_B y_D = (2)(-4) = -8\n\nx_D y_C = (2)(-1) = -2\n\nx_C y_A = (-1)(1) = -1\n\nSum of these: -4 + (-8) + (-2) + (-1) = -15\n\nNow the other diagonal terms:\n\ny_A x_B = (1)(2) = 2\n\ny_B x_D = (4)(2) =8\n\ny_D x_C = (-4)(-1) =4\n\ny_C x_A = (-1)(-1)=1\n\nSum: 2 +8 +4 +1=15\n\nSo, the area is half the absolute difference of these sums:\n\nArea = (1/2)| -15 -15 | = (1/2)| -30 | = "

So, the area of the quadrilateral is 15.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Since the quadrilateral is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis, we can compute the area of one quadrant and multiply by 4.\n\nLooking at the points in the first quadrant: A is (-1,1), but that's in the second quadrant. Wait, maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, using vectors or coordinates. Alternatively, the figure formed is a kite because two points are on the circle and two on the parabola, but with symmetry.\n\nWait, but the shoelace formula gave me 15, so maybe that's the correct answer. I think I did the shoelace correctly, ordering the points as A, B, D, C, which goes around the quadrilateral in a clockwise manner, so the shoelace formula applies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors:\n\nCompute vectors AB and AD and find the area via cross product.\n\nVector AB: from A(-1,1) to B(2,4): (3,3)\n\nVector AD: from A(-1,1) to D(2,-4): (3,-5)\n\nThe area of the parallelogram formed by AB and AD is |AB × AD| = |3*(-5) - 3*3| = |-15 -9| = 24\n\n"
