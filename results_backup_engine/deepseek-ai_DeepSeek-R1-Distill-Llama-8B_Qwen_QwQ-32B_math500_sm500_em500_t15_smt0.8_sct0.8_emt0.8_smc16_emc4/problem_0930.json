There are more multiples of 2 than 5, so the number of 2s will be greater than or equal to the number of 5s.\n\nThen, I'll count the number of 5s. Each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, and multiples of 25 contribute more than one.\n\nCalculating the number of 5s:\n- 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, so there are 8 multiples of 5.\n- Among these, 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, so one multiple of 25.\n- Adding these gives 8 + 1 = 9 fives.\n\nSince there are more than enough 2s to pair with the 5s, the limiting factor is the number of 5s.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\( 42! \\) (42 factorial), we need to count how many times the factor **10** appears in the product. Since \\( 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\), the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of **2** and **5** in the prime factorization of \\( 42! \\). However, there are usually more factors of **2** than **5**, so the number of trailing zeros is limited by the number of factors of **5**.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Count the number of multiples of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 42:**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   So, there are **8** factors of **5**.\n\n2. **Check for multiples of higher powers of 5 (25, 125, etc.):**\n   - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n   - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\"
