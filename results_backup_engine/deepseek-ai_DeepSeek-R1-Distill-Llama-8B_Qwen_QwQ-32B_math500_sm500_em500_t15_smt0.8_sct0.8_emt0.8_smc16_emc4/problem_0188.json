I need to find the modulus of w, which is denoted as |w|. Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number, the modulus is like its distance from the origin on the complex plane. For a complex number a + bi, the modulus is the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So, if I can express w in the form a + bi, I can just compute sqrt(a^2 + b^2) to find |w|. Alternatively, I also recall that the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli, and the modulus of a sum is less than or equal to the sum of the moduli. Maybe there's a way to use that here.\n\nBut let's see, maybe the straightforward way is just to substitute z into w and simplify. So, w is (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). Let me compute 3z + 1 first. Since z is 1 + i, multiplying that by 3 gives 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i. Then adding 1 gives 4 + 3i. So, the numerator is 4 + 3i.\n\nNext, compute the denominator, which is 5z + 7. Again, z is 1 + i, so 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i. Adding 7 gives 12 + 5i. So, the denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nTherefore, w is (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). To find |w|, I can use the property that |w| = |(4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i)| = |4 + 3i| / |12 + 5i|. That should be easier than dealing with the complex fraction directly because I can compute the modulus separately for numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me compute |4 + 3i| first. That's sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nNow, compute |12 + "

            "output": "5i|. That's sqrt(12^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13.\n\nSo, |w| = 5 / 13. That seems straightforward. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, when I have a complex number in the form (a + bi)/(c + di), the modulus is indeed sqrt(a^2 + b^2) divided by sqrt(c^2 + d^2). So, in this case, yes, 5 over 13 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to go through the process of rationalizing the denominator, I could do that as well. Let's try that method to confirm.\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is 12 - 5i. So:\n\nw = (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) / [(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)]\n\nFirst, compute the denominator: (12)^2 - (5i)^2 = 144 - 25i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 144 - (-25) = 144 + 25 = 169.\n\nSo denominator is 169.\n\nNow compute numerator: (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i). Let me expand that.\n\n4*12 = 48, 4*(-5i) = -20i, 3i*12 = 36i, 3i*(-5i) = -15i^2.\n\nSo, adding all these terms: 48 - 20i + 36i -15i^2.\n\nCombine like terms: 48 + ( -20i + 36i ) = 48 + 16i.\n\nThen, the term with i^2: -15i^2. Since i^2 = -1, this becomes +15.\n\nSo, the numerator is 48 + 15 + 16i = 63 + 16i.\n\nSo, w is (63 + 16i)/169. Therefore, w = 63/169 + (16/169)i.\n\nNow, the modulus is sqrt( (63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2 ). That's sqrt( (3969 + 256)/ (169^2) ) because 63 squared is"

            "output": " 3969 and 16 squared is 256. Adding those gives 4225.\n\nSo, sqrt(4225 / (169^2)). The numerator sqrt(4225) is 65, and the denominator is 169. So, 65/169.\n\nBut wait, 65 and 169, let me see if they can be simplified. 65 is 5*13 and 169 is 13 squared, so they have a common factor of 13. So, 65 divided by 13 is 5, and 169 divided by 13 is 13. So, it's 5/13.\n\nSo, that confirms it. Using both methods, I get |w| = 5/13.\n\nAlternatively, I could have also used the formula that |w| = |3z + 1| / |5z +7| and then plug in z.\n\nBut let me do that as another confirmation.\n\nCompute |3z + 1| where z = 1 + i.\n\nSo, 3z +1 = 3*(1 +i) +1 = 3 +3i +1 = 4 +3i. So |4 +3i| is 5, as before.\n\nCompute |5z +7| where z =1 +i. So, 5*(1 +i) +7 =5 +5i +7 =12 +5i. |12 +5i| is 13, as before.\n\nSo, |w| =5 /13.\n\nTherefore, consistent with all methods, the modulus of w is 5/13.\n\nI think that's solid.
