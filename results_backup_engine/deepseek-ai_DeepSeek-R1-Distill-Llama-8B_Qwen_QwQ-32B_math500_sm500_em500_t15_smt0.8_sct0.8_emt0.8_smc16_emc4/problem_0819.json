            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay, let's start by breaking down what ω can be.\n\nSince ω³ = 1, ω is a cube root of unity. I remember that the cube roots of 1 are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1. So, ω can be either the primitive cube roots of unity. That means ω and ω² are the non-real cube roots, and they satisfy certain properties.\n\nI recall that for cube roots of unity, ω³ = 1, and ω² + ω + 1 = 0. That's a key identity that might be useful here. So, ω² + ω + 1 = 0. That equation could help simplify things later on.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, adding two fractions. To add them together, I should find a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me write that out:\n\nS = [1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω)] / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].\n\nSimplifying the numerator: 1*(1 + ω²) is just 1 + ω², and 1*(1 + ω) is 1 + ω. So adding them together gives (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nTherefore, S = (2 + ω + ω²) / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)]. Okay, so that's one step.\n\nNow, in the numerator, we have 2 + ω + ω², and in the denominator, we have the product (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me see if I can simplify this.\n\nFirst, let's count on the numerator: 2 + ω + ω². Wait, from the identity ω² + ω + 1 = 0, we know that ω² + ω = -1. So substituting that into the numerator"

            "output": ": 2 + (-1) = 1. So the numerator simplifies to 1. That's nice!\n\nSo now, S = 1 / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)]. Cool, so now I just need to compute the denominator.\n\nLet me expand the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Multiplying this out, we get:\n\n1*(1) + 1*(ω²) + ω*(1) + ω*(ω²).\n\nThat simplifies to 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut wait, we know that ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. So substituting that in, we have:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nWait, that's the same as the numerator we had before. But from earlier, we know that 2 + ω + ω² = 1. So substituting that back into the denominator, we get S = 1 / (1). So S = 1.\n\nWait, that seems surprising. So the expression simplifies to 1?\n\nBut that seems odd because depending on ω, sometimes it could be 1, but are there other possibilities? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, ω can be either one of the two primitive roots, so ω and ω². If ω is one primitive root, ω² is the other. So let me see, perhaps I should compute S for ω and ω² separately, to ensure that both give the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my approach is correct because regardless of which root we take, the expression simplifies to 1. Let me verify with specific numbers.\n\nLet me recall that the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω². The exact values can be written using complex numbers: 1, e^(2πi/3), and e^(4πi/3).\n\nCalculating ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = (-1/2) + i(√3/2). Similarly, ω² = e^(4πi/3) = (-1/2) - i(√3/2).\n\nLet me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) for ω = (-1/2) + i(√3/2"

            "output": ").\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω: 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1/2 - i√3/2):\n\n[1 * (1/2 - i√3/2)] / [(1/2 + i√3/2)(1/2 - i√3/2)].\n\nThe denominator becomes (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So the first term simplifies to (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, the second term: 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (1/2 + i√3/2):\n\n[1*(1/2 + i√3/2)] / [(1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nAdding the two terms together:\n\n(1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = (1/2 + 1/2) + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nOkay, so that checks out numerically. So the value is indeed 1. But the problem says \"find all possible values\". Since ω is a cube root of 1, but not equal to 1, so ω can be either of the two primitive roots. But in both cases, the expression gives 1. So the only possible value is 1?\n\nWait, but let me check if ω is 1. Wait, the problem says \"ω is a complex number such"

            "output": " that ω³ = 1\". So ω could be 1, right? If ω =1, then let's see what happens.\n\nIf ω =1, then the expression becomes 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = (1/2) + (1/2) =1.\n\nSo in this case, if ω =1, the expression is also 1.\n\nTherefore, whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², the expression evaluates to 1. Hence, the only possible value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but in the beginning, I thought there might be multiple values, but it turns out regardless of ω, the expression is always 1.\n\nHmm, so I think that makes sense. The expression is always 1, so only one possible value.\n\nI'm going to go with that conclusion. So the only possible value is 1.\n</think>\n\nOkay, so after going through the problem step by step, considering both ω being a primitive cube root of unity and ω being 1, we find that in all cases, the expression simplifies to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\n\\boxed{1}"
