            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\). Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this. I remember that sometimes when you have an equation where two things are cubed and added, it might be helpful to use the formula for the sum of cubes. Or maybe there's another identity that could simplify things here.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it correct:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nLooking at this, I notice that on the right side, the expression inside the cube is \\(2x - 10\\). Wait a second, is that related to the terms on the left side? Let me check:\n\n\\(2x - 10\\) can be factored as \\(2(x - 5)\\). Hmm, interesting. So \\(2x - 10 = 2(x - 5)\\). That makes me wonder if there's a way to express the left side as something similar. Let me see the left side again:\n\n\\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3\\)\n\nI wonder if these two terms can be combined in some way. Maybe I should expand both sides and see if that helps. But expanding cubics might get messy. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nI recall that if \\(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\\), it might not directly lead to a straightforward solution, but perhaps there's a relationship between \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). In this case, \\(a = x - 3\\), \\(b = x - 7\\), and \\(c = 2x - 10\\). Let me see if \\(a + b = c\\) or something like that.\n\nCalculating \\(a + b\\):\n\n\\[\n(x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\n\\]\n\nOh! Wait a minute, that's exactly the right side! So \\(a + b = c\\). So, we have \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\\). Hmm, so let's consider that equation:\n\n\\[\na^3 + b^3"

Therefore, either \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 0\\), or \\(a + b = 0\\). But in our case, \\(a + b = c\\), which is \\(2x - 10\\). Wait, but in the original equation, \\(a + b = c\\), so actually, the equation \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\\) reduces to \\(3ab(a + b) = 0\\). Therefore, the solutions must satisfy either \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 0\\), or \\(a + b = 0\\). But since \\(a + b = c\\), which is \\(2x - 10\\), so \\(a + b = 0\\) would mean \\(2x - 10 = 0\\), so \\(x = 5\\). Alternatively, \\(a = 0\\) would mean \\(x - 3 = 0\\) so \\(x = 3\\), and \\(b = 0\\) would mean \\(x - 7 = 0\\) so \\(x = 7\\). \n\nTherefore, the possible solutions are \\(x = 3\\), \\(x = 7\\), or \\(x = 5\\). But wait, I need to check these solutions in the original equation because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially when factoring, we might introduce extraneous solutions or miss some constraints.\n\nLet me check each of these:\n\nFirst, \\(x = 3\\):\n\nLeft side: \\((3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = -64\\)\n\nRight side: \\(2(3) - 10 = 6 - 10 = -4\\), so \\((-4)^3 = -6"

            "output": "\\). Wait, \\(-64\\) vs. \\(-6\\)? That doesn't match. So \\(x = 3\\) is not a solution.\n\nWait, that can't be. I thought \\(a = 0\\) would satisfy. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. If \\(a = 0\\), then \\(x = 3\\), so the left side becomes \\(0 + (x - 7)^3\\). Plugging in \\(x = 3\\): \\(0 + (-4)^3 = -64\\). The right side is \\((2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 -10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64\\). Wait, so both sides are -64. So it's equal. So I think I made a calculation mistake earlier.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nLeft side at \\(x = 3\\): \\((0)^3 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64\\)\n\nRight side at \\(x = 3\\): \\(2*3 - 10 = 6 -10 = -4\\); \\((-4)^3 = -64\\)\n\nYes, same as left. So both sides are -64. Thus, \\(x = 3\\) is a solution.\n\nWait, I think I messed up my earlier calculation when I said the right side was -6. No, it's (-4)^3 which is -64. So \\(x = 3\\) is good.\n\nSimilarly, \\(x = 7\\):\n\nLeft side: \\((7 - 3)^3 + (7 - 7)^3 = (4)^3 + 0 = 64 + 0 = 64\\)\n\nRight side: \\(2*7 -10 = 14 -10 = 4\\); \\(4^3 = 64\\). So yes, equal. So \\(x =7\\) is a solution.\n\nNow, \\(x = 5\\):\n\nLeft side: \\((5 - 3)^3 + (5 -7)^3 = (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0\\)\n\nRight side: \\(2*5 -10 = 10 -10 = 0\\); \\(0^3 = 0\\). So yes, both sides are 0. So \\("

We know from earlier that \\(x=3\\), \\(x=5\\), and \\(x=7\\) are roots.
