I remember that when dealing with cubic equations, sometimes factoring or substitution can help simplify things. Let me see if I can spot a pattern or a substitution that makes this easier.\n\nFirst, I notice that both sides of the equation have cubes. Maybe I can rewrite the left side in a way that resembles the right side. Let me look at the terms on the left: \\((x - 3)\\) and \\((x - 7)\\). Hmm, these are two linear terms, but maybe if I combine them somehow, it will relate to the right side.\n\nWait, I also notice that the right side is \\((2x - 10)^3\\). Let me factor 2 out of that: \\(2(x - 5)\\). So it becomes \\([2(x - 5)]^3\\), which is \\(8(x - 5)^3\\). That might be helpful later.\n\nGoing back to the left side: \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3\\). I recall that there's a formula for \\(a^3 + b^3\\), which is \\((a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me set \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). Then the left side becomes \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\). So let's compute \\(a + b\\) and \\(a^2 - ab + b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(a + b\\): \\((x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\\). Oh, interesting! That's exactly the same as the base of the right side. So \\(a + b = 2x - 10\\).\n\nNow, the equation becomes: \\((2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3\\). If I factor out \\((2x - 10)\\) from both sides, I can divide both sides by \\"

So I should consider two cases: when \\(2x - 10 \\neq 0\\) and when \\(2x - 10 = 0\\).\n\nCase 1: \\(2x - 10 \\neq 0\\). Then I can divide both sides by \\(2x - 10\\), which gives me \\(a^2 - ab + b^2 = (2x - 10)^2\\). Let's compute \\(a^2 - ab + b^2\\).\n\nFirst, \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). So \\(ab = (x - 3)(x - 7)\\). Let me expand that: \\(x^2 - 7x - 3x + 21 = x^2 - 10x + 21\\).\n\nNext, \\(a^2 = (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\\), and \\(b^2 = (x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49\\). Now, \\(a^2 - ab + b^2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49)\n\\]\n\nLet me simplify step by step:\n\n1. Expand each term:\n   - \\(x^2 - 6x + 9\\)\n   - \\(-x^2 + 10x -21\\)\n   - \\(x^2 - 14x + 49\\)\n\n2. Combine like terms:\n   - \\(x^2 - x^2 + x^2 = x^2\\)\n   - \\(-6x + 10x -14x = (-6 + 10 -14)x = (-10)x\\)\n   - \\(9 - 21 + 49 = (9 + 49) - 21 = 58 - 21 = 37\\)\n\nSo, \\(a^2 - ab + b^2 = x^2 - 10x + 37\\).\n\nThe equation now is \\(x^2 - 10x + 37"

Those numbers are -3 and -7.\nSo, \\((x - 3)(x - 7) = 0\\), which gives \\(x = 3\\) or \\(x = 7\\).\n\nBut wait, earlier I divided both sides by \\(2x - 10\\), which means \\(x \\neq 5\\). So \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = 7\\) are valid solutions as long as they are not 5, which they aren't. So these are two roots.\n\nCase 2: \\(2x - 10 = 0\\), which implies \\(x = 5\\).
