            "output": "I'll start by calculating the volume of the original cube. The cube has side length 's', so the volume is s³.\n\nNext, I need to determine how much metal is removed from the cube to form the steel sphere. The sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its volume is (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic inches.\n\nEach corner of the cube is a right-angled corner where three edges meet. The volume removed from each corner is a small cube with side length equal to the radius of the sphere, which is 3 inches. The volume of one such small cube is 3³ = 27 cubic inches.\n\nHowever, since the sphere is formed by removing metal from all eight corners of the cube, the total volume removed is 8 times the volume of one small cube. Therefore, the total volume removed is 8 * 27 = 216 cubic inches.\n\nNow, I can set up the equation for the volume of the cube as the volume of the original cube minus the volume of the sphere plus the volume removed. So, s³ = 36π + 216.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for 's' by dividing both sides by π. This gives s = √(36 + 216/π). Plugging in the value of π (approximately 3.1416), I can calculate the numerical value of 's'.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are tasked with finding the volume of the original cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the cube's corners.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - **Original Shape:** A cube with side length \\( s \\) inches.\n   - **Sphere Made:** A steel sphere with a radius \\( r = 3 \\) inches.\n   - **Metal Removed:** From each corner of the cube, a small cube with side length equal to the sphere's radius is removed to form the sphere.\n\n2. **Calculating the Volume of the Sphere:**\n   - The volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in \\( r = 3 \\) inches:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac"

To form the sphere, a small cube with side length equal to the sphere's radius (3 inches) is removed from each corner.\n   - Volume of one small cube:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{small cube}} = (3)^3 = 27 \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n   - Total volume removed from all 8 corners:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{removed}} = 8 \\times 27 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Relating Cube Volume to Sphere Volume:**\n   - The volume of the original cube must equal the volume of the sphere plus the volume removed:\n     \\[\n     s^3 = V_{\\text{sphere}} + V_{\\text{removed}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values:\n     \\[\n     s^3 = 36\\pi + 216\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\( s^3 \\):**\n   - The problem asks for the volume of the cube, which is \\( s^3 \\). Thus, the volume of the cube is:\n     \\[\n     s^3 = 216 + 36\\pi\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{216 + 36\\pi}\n\\]"
