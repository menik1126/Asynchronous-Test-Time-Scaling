This gives me 6 + 11 - 4 = 13, which is the same as the original value.\n\nNext, I'll explore grouping some negative numbers: 1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6. Calculating the parentheses first gives me 1 + 2 - 1 + 5 + 6 = 13.\n\nThen, I'll consider grouping larger sections: (1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6. This simplifies to 2 + 5 + 6 = 13.\n\nTo minimize the value, I'll try to maximize the subtraction. I'll group the first three numbers and the last three numbers: (1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5 + 6). This results in 6 - 15 = -9.\n\nFinally, I'll verify if there's a way to achieve a value lower than -9 by trying other groupings, but none of them yield a result lower than -9. Therefore, the minimum possible value of the expression is -9.\n</think>\n\nTo find the minimum value of the expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\) by adding parentheses, we need to strategically place the parentheses to maximize the subtraction effect.\n\n1. **Original Expression**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13\n   \\]\n\n2. **Exploring Parentheses Placements**:\n   - **Grouping Positive Numbers**:\n     \\[\n     (1 + 2 + 3) + (5 + 6) - 4 = 6 + 11 - 4 = 13\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Grouping Negative Numbers**:\n     \\[\n     1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 - 1 +"

    "question": "The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)\n\nEnter your answer as a single value.",
