            "output": "To determine the number of y-intercepts for the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), I need to analyze its graph.\n\nFirst, I recognize that the equation is in the form \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\), which is typical for parabolas that open to the right or left. In this case, since the coefficient of \\( y^2 \\) is positive, the parabola will open to the right.\n\nNext, to find the y-intercepts, I need to identify the points where the graph crosses the y-axis. On the y-axis, the value of \\( x \\) is always 0. Therefore, I set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). To find the number of real solutions, I can use the discriminant \\( D \\), which is given by:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula:\n\n\\[\nD = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (20 > 0), there are two distinct real solutions for \\( y \\). This implies that the parabola intersects the y-axis at two points. Therefore, the graph of the given parabola has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation Form**:\n   \n   The equation is in the form \\( x = a(y)^2 + b(y) + c \\), which represents a parabola that opens either to the right or to the left. Since the coefficient \\( a = 1 \\) is positive, the parabola opens to the right.\n\n2. **Find the \\( y \\)-Intercepts**:\n   \n   A \\( y \\)-intercept occurs where \\( x = 0 \\). Set \\( x = 0 \\)"
