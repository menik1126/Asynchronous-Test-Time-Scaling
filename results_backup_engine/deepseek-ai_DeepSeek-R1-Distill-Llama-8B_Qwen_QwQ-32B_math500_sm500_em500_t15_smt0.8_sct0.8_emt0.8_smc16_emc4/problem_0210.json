            "output": "First, I identify the areas of the three concentric circles. The smallest circle has a radius of 4, so its area is \\( \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\). The next circle, with a radius of 6, has an area of \\( \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi \\). The largest circle, with a radius of 7, has an area of \\( \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi \\).\n\nNext, I calculate the areas of the regions between the circles. The area of region X, between the largest and middle circles, is \\( 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi \\). The area of region Y, between the middle and smallest circles, is \\( 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi \\). Finally, the area of region Z, which is the area of the smallest circle, is \\( 16\\pi \\).\n\nNow, I compare the areas of regions X, Y, and Z. Region Z has the smallest area at \\( 16\\pi \\), while region X has the largest area at \\( 13\\pi \\). The difference between the largest and smallest areas is \\( 13\\pi - 16\\pi = -3\\pi \\). Taking the absolute value, the difference is \\( 3\\pi \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the difference between the area of the largest and smallest regions, we'll analyze each region step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the Areas of the Circles:**\n   - **Circle with radius 4:**  \n     \\[\n     A_1 = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 6:**  \n     \\[\n     A_2 = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 7:**  \n     \\[\n     A_3 = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Areas of the Regions:**\n   - **Region X (Between radius 6 and 7):**  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = A_3 - A_2 = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Region"
