Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I'll count the number of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!. There are more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros. \n\nFirst, I'll divide 42 by 5 to count the number of 5s:\n42 ÷ 5 = 8.4, which means there are 8 multiples of 5 in 42!.\n\nNext, I'll count the additional 5s from numbers that are multiples of higher powers of 5:\n- 25 is 5 squared (5x5), so I add 1 more for each additional 5:\n  42 ÷ 25 = 1.68, which gives 1 extra 5.\n\nAdding these together, there are a total of 9 fives in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nSince there are more than enough 2s to pair with these 9 fives, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeros are at the end of \\(42!\\) (42 factorial), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of numbers from 1 to 42. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), we'll count the number of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). The number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor, which is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s. Usually, there are more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros.\n\n**Step 1: Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\).**\n\nWe'll use the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of 5s} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\dots"
