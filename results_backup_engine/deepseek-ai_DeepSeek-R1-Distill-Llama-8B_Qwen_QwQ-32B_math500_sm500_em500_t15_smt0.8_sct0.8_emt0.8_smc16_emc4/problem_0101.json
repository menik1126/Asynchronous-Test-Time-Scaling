            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD, given that C and D are integers. The equation provided is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\]\n\nHmm, first of all, I remember that when you have an equation like this with two fractions on the left side, to find the constants C and D, you can combine the two fractions into one and then compare it to the right side. \n\nSo, let me try that. The denominators on the left are (x - 3) and (x + 8). To add the two fractions, I need a common denominator, which would be the product of both denominators, right? So that would be (x - 3)(x + 8). \n\nLet me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, write the left side with a common denominator:\n\n\\[\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\]\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the left side to a single fraction. Now, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\]\n\nWait a second, the denominator on the right side is x² + 5x - 24. Maybe I can factor that to check if it's the same as the denominator on the left. Let's factor it:\n\nx² + 5x - 24.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let's see, 8 and -3. Yeah, because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, the denominator factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). \n\nOh, that's the same as the denominator on the left side. So, the denominators are equal, which means the numerators must be equal as well. So, I can write:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nAlright, so now"

            "output": " I have:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nThis equation must hold for all real x except x = 3 and x = -8, which are the excluded values. That means that the coefficients of corresponding powers of x on both sides must be equal. So, let me expand the left side.\n\nFirst, distribute C and D:\n\nC*x + C*8 + D*x - D*3 = 4x - 23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, comparing the coefficients of x and the constant terms on both sides, we have:\n\nFor x terms:\nC + D = 4\n\nFor constant terms:\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nSo now, I have a system of two equations with two variables, C and D. Let me write them:\n\n1. C + D = 4\n2. 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve for C and D. Maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nFrom the first equation, D = 4 - C. Let me substitute that into the second equation.\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nWait, because -3*(4 - C) is -12 + 3C. So, combining like terms:\n\n8C + 3C = 11C, so:\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nLet me add 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nOkay, so C is -1. Now, substitute back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Now, the question asks for the product CD, which is (-1)*5 = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the equation after substitution:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nExpanding: 8C -12 + 3C = 11C -"
