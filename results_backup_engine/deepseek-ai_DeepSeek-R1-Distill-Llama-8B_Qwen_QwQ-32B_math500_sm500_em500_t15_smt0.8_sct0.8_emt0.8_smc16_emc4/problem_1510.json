Since the two letters must be different, I'll use the permutation formula for two distinct items: P(26, 2).\n\nThen, after the letters, there are two digits. Each digit can range from 0 to 9, which gives 10 possible choices for each digit. Like the letters, the two digits must also be different, so I'll use the permutation formula for two distinct digits: P(10, 2).\n\nTo find the total number of license plates, I'll multiply the number of possible combinations of letters by the number of possible combinations of digits. This approach ensures that all unique combinations are accounted for.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll consider each part of the license plate separately and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Letters (A-Z):**\n   - There are **26 letters** (A through Z).\n   - We need **2 different letters**.\n   - The number of ways to choose and arrange 2 different letters is given by the **permutation** formula:\n     \\[\n     P(26, 2) = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n     \\]\n\n2. **Digits (0-9):**\n   - There are **10 digits** (0 through 9).\n   - We need **2 different digits**.\n   - The number of ways to choose and arrange 2 different digits is given by the **permutation** formula:\n     \\[\n     P(10, 2) = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Number of License Plates:**\n   - Since the letters and digits are independent, we multiply the number of possibilities for each part:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total} = P(26, 2) \\times P(10, 2) = 650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{58,\\!500}\n\\]"
