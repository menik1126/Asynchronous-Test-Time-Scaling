He walks half a mile initially and then an additional half a mile, so that's a total of one mile south.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total distance he walks east, which is three-fourths of a mile.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. I'll square the total south distance and the east distance, add them together, and then take the square root of the result to find the straight-line distance.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Displacement in Each Direction**\n\n- **Southward Displacement:**\n  - First, Bill walks \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n  - Then, he walks another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n  \n  **Total Southward Displacement:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Eastward Displacement:**\n  - Bill walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n  \n  **Total Eastward Displacement:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile}\n  \\]\n  \n**Step 2: Calculate the Straight-Line Distance Using the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nThe straight-line distance (\\( D \\)) from the starting point can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{(\\text{Southward Displacement})^2 + (\\text{Eastward Displacement})^2}\n\\]\n  \n**Plugging in the Values:**\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{(1 \\text{ mile})^2 + \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile} \\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{1 + \\left( \\frac{9}{16} \\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{16} + \\frac{9}{16}}\n\\]\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}}\n\\]\n\\[\nD = \\frac{5}{4} \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n  \n**Step 3: Convert to a Decimal"
