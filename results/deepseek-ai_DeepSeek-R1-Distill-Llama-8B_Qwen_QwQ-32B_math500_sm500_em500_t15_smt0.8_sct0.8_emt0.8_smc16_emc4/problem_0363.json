            "output": "I will start by defining the initial number of blue and yellow marbles using variables. Let\u2019s denote the number of blue marbles as B and yellow marbles as Y.\n\nGiven the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3, I can set up the equation B/Y = 4/3, which simplifies to 3B = 4Y.\n\nAfter modifying the marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3. This means the new number of blue marbles is 7 parts and yellow marbles is 3 parts. The new number of blue marbles is B + 5, and the new number of yellow marbles is Y - 3. So, (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3, leading to 3(B + 5) = 7(Y - 3).\n\nNow, I have two equations: 3B = 4Y and 3B + 15 = 7Y - 21. I'll solve the first equation for B in terms of Y: B = (4/3)Y.\n\nNext, I'll substitute B into the second equation: 3*(4/3)Y + 15 = 7Y - 21. Simplifying this gives 4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21, which leads to 7Y - 4Y = 36, so 3Y = 36, and thus Y = 12.\n\nFinally, using B = (4/3)Y, I find that B = 16. Therefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before adding more.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- \\( B \\) = initial number of blue marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = initial number of yellow marbles\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Ratio**\n\nInitially, the ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 4:3 \\). Therefore:\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\implies 3B = 4Y \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Modify the Marbles**\n\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles:\n- New number of blue marbles: \\( B + 5 \\)\n-"
