The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\).\n\nFrom the diagram, I can see that the radius \\( r \\) is given as 3 cm. I'll substitute \\( r = 3 \\) into the volume formula.\n\nSo, \\( 45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h \\). Simplifying this equation, the \\( \\pi \\) terms cancel out, leaving \\( 45 = 9h \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( h \\), I divide both sides of the equation by 9. This gives \\( h = 5 \\) cm.\n</think>\n\nTo find the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, we'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cm\u00b3\n- Radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm\n\n**Step 1:** Plug the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = 9\\pi h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\pi \\) to simplify.\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe height of the cylinder is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) centimeters."
