Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that expanding cubic terms can be messy, but maybe there's a way to simplify this without expanding everything. Maybe I can look for some pattern or factor out common terms. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the left side, I notice that both (x - 3) and (x - 7) are being cubed. If I set a = x - 3 and b = x - 7, the left side becomes a^3 + b^3. On the right side, the expression is (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, 2x - 10 looks like it's twice (x - 5). Let me check: 2*(x - 5) = 2x - 10. Yes, that's correct. So, the right side can be written as (2*(x - 5))^3, which is the same as 8*(x - 5)^3 because (2)^3 is 8. So, the equation becomes a^3 + b^3 = 8*(x - 5)^3.\n\nBut a and b are (x - 3) and (x - 7). Maybe I can express (x - 5) in terms of a and b. Let me think. Since a = x - 3 and b = x - 7, then a - b = (x - 3) - (x - 7) = 4. So, a - b = 4, which also means b = a - 4. That might be useful later.\n\nSo, going back to the equation: a^3 + b^3 = 8*(x - 5)^3. Let me substitute b with a - 4. So, a^3 + (a - 4)^3 = 8*(x - 5)^3. Hmm, maybe I can write (x - 5) in terms of a as well. Since a = x - 3, then x = a + 3. Therefore, (x - 5) = (a + 3"

            "output": ") - 5 = a - 2. So, (x - 5) = a - 2.\n\nSubstituting that into the equation, we get a^3 + (a - 4)^3 = 8*(a - 2)^3. Hmm, that's an equation in terms of a now. Let me compute both sides.\n\nFirst, I'll expand the left side: a^3 + (a - 4)^3. Let's expand (a - 4)^3. Using the binomial theorem, (a - 4)^3 = a^3 - 12a^2 + 48a - 64. So, the left side becomes a^3 + a^3 - 12a^2 + 48a - 64, which simplifies to 2a^3 - 12a^2 + 48a - 64.\n\nNow, the right side is 8*(a - 2)^3. Let's expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem: (a - 2)^3 = a^3 - 6a^2 + 12a - 8. Therefore, multiplying by 8, we get 8a^3 - 48a^2 + 96a - 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n2a^3 - 12a^2 + 48a - 64 = 8a^3 - 48a^2 + 96a - 64.\n\nHmm, let's subtract the left side from both sides to bring everything to one side:\n\n0 = 8a^3 - 48a^2 + 96a - 64 - (2a^3 - 12a^2 + 48a - 64)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n8a^3 - 48a^2 + 96a - 64 - 2a^3 + 12a^2 - 48a + 64\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8a^3 - 2a^3) = 6a^3\n\n(-48a^2 + 12a^2) = -36a^2\n\n(96a - 48a) = 48a\n\n(-64 + 64) = 0\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to 6a^3 - 36a^2"

Therefore, the solutions are when 6a = 0, which gives a = 0, or when a^2 - 6a + 8 = 0.\n\nLet me solve a^2 - 6a + 8 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: a = [6 ± sqrt(36 - 32)] / 2 = [6 ± sqrt(4)] / 2 = [6 ± 2]/2, which gives a = (6 + 2)/2 = 4, or a = (6 - 2)/2 = 2. So, the solutions for a are 0, 4, and 2.\n\nNow, remember that a = x - 3. So, to find x, we can write:\n\nFor a = 0: x - 3 = 0 => x = 3.\n\nFor a = 4: x - 3 = 4 => x = 7.\n\nFor a = 2: x - 3 = 2 => x = 5.\n\nSo, the potential roots are x = 3, x = 5, and x = 7.\n\nWait a second, let me check if these are indeed solutions to the original equation, because sometimes when you manipulate equations, especially cubics, extraneous solutions can appear.\n\nLet me plug each x back into the original equation:\n\nOriginal equation: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nFirst, let's try x = 3:\n\nLeft side: (3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0^3 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64.\n\nRight side: (2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 - 10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64.\n\nSo, -64 = -64.

That works as well.\n\nHmm, so all three solutions satisfy the original equation. So, x=3,5,7 are all roots.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original equation is a cubic, which can have up to three real roots. So, if we found three roots, that is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have considered that since a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe that factorization can help.\n\nWait, but in the equation a^3 + b^3 = 8*(x -5)^3, so a^3 + b^3 = 8*(a -2)^3.\n\nBut wait, maybe instead of substituting, I could have approached it differently. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to notice that 2x -10 is equal to 2*(x -5). So, perhaps if we let y = x -5, then 2x -10 = 2y.\n\nAlso, x -3 = y +2 and x -7 = y -2.\n\nSo, substituting these into the left side, we get (y +2)^3 + (y -2)^3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(y +2)^3 = y^3 + 6y^2 + 12y +8\n\n(y -2)^3 = y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(y^3 + 6y^2 +12y +8) + (y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8) = 2y^3 + 24y.\n\nOn the right side, we have (2y)^3 = 8y^3.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n2y^3"

Since we already have roots at x=3,5,7, let's check if (x -3) is a factor.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nDivide x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 by (x -3).\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -15 |71 | -105\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 3: 1*3=3.\n\nAdd to -15: -12.\n\nMultiply by3: -12*3=-36.\n\nAdd to71:35.\n\nMultiply by3:35*3=105.\n\nAdd to -105:0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x -3)(x^2 -12x +35).\n\nNow, factor x^2 -12x +35.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12. These numbers are -5 and -7.\n\nSo, x^2 -12x +35 = (x -5)(x -7).\n\nThus, the factored form is (x -3)(x -5)(x -7)=0.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=3,5,7.\n\nThis confirms the earlier results.\n\nAlternatively, since the cubic equation is a third-degree polynomial, we can expect up to three real roots, which we have found: 3,5,7. All three satisfy the original equation, so they are indeed the roots.\n\nAnother way to think about the problem is to recognize that the equation may have some symmetry or special structure. For example, noticing that (x -3) + (x -7) = 2x -10, which is exactly the right side. Wait, hold on:\n\n(x -3) + (x -7) =2x -10. So"
