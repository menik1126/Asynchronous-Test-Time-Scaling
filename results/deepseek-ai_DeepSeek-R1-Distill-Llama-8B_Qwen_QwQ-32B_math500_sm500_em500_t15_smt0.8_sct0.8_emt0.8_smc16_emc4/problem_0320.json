Since the order of selection doesn't matter, we'll use combinations for both selections.\n\n1. **Selecting 3 Boys from 7:**\n   \n   The number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7 is given by the combination formula:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Selecting 2 Girls from 4:**\n   \n   Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4 is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Number of Ways:**\n   \n   To find the total number of ways to select the group, multiply the two combinations:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = \\binom{7}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{210}"
