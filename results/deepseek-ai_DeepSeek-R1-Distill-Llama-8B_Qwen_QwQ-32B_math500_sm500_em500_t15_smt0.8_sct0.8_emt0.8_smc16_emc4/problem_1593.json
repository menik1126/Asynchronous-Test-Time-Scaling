Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense.\n\nFirst off, I notice that both sides of the equation have cubic terms. I wonder if there's a way to simplify this without expanding everything. Let me write it out again to see if I can spot any patterns or possible factorizations.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHmm, I also notice that (2x - 10) is the same as 2*(x - 5). Maybe that can help somehow. But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about some properties of cubic equations.\n\nI remember that for certain forms, like a^3 + b^3, there's a formula: a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe I can use that here. Let me try applying that to the left side.\n\nLet me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 7). Then the left side becomes a^3 + b^3, which factors into (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Let me compute a + b and a^2 - ab + b^2.\n\nFirst, a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10. Wait a minute, that's the same as the right side of the equation, which is (2x - 10)^3. Interesting!\n\nSo, the left side factors into (2x - 10)*(a^2 - ab + b^2). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n(2x - 10)*(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHmm, so I can divide both sides by (2x - 10), provided that 2x - 10 \u2260 0. Let me check that: if 2x - 10 = 0, then x = 5. So, x = 5 might be a solution, but I should verify it later. For"

Remember, a = x - 3 and b = x - 7.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\na^2 = (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nab = (x - 3)(x - 7) = x^2 - 10x + 21.\n\nb^2 = (x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49.\n\nSo, a^2 - ab + b^2 is:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49).\n\nLet me simplify that step by step.\n\nFirst, distribute the negative sign to ab:\n\n= x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 10x - 21 + x^2 - 14x + 49.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nx^2 - x^2 + x^2 = x^2.\n\n-6x + 10x - 14x = (-6 + 10 - 14)x = (-10)x.\n\n9 - 21 + 49 = (9 -21) +49 = (-12) +49 = 37.\n\nSo, a^2 - ab + b^2 simplifies to x^2 - 10x + 37.\n\nSo, putting that back into the equation, we have:\n\nx^2 - 10x + 37 = (2x - 10)^2.\n\nLet me compute the right side now. (2x -10)^2 = 4x^2 - 40x + 100.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\nx^2 - 10x + 37 = 4x^2 - 40x + 100.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation.\n\nSubtract (x^2 - 10x + 37) from both sides:\n\n0 = 4x^2 - 40x + 100 - (x^2 - 10"

So, in total, there are three solutions: 3,5,7.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't align with the original equation being a cubic, which can have up to three real roots. So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. When I went from the original equation to the quadratic, I obtained x^2 -10x +21=0, giving x=3 and x=7, and then x=5 from 2x-10=0.

Let me check if x=5 is a solution of the quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic equation was x^2 -10x +21=0, which has roots at x=3 and x=7. So, x=5 is not a root of the quadratic, meaning that when we divided by (2x-10), we lost x=5 as a solution, so we have to include it separately.\n\nHence, the three solutions are x=3, x=5, and x=7.\n\nWait, that seems consistent.
