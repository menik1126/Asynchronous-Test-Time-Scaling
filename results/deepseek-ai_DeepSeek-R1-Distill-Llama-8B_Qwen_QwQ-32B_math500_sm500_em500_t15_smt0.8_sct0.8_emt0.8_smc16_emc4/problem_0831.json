Hmm, okay, so first, I remember that the equation \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\) has three roots, which are the cube roots of unity. These roots are 1, \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive cube root of unity. That means \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\), but \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\). \n\nSo, since \\(\\omega\\) can be any of the three cube roots of unity, I have to consider both cases where \\(\\omega = \\omega\\) (the primitive root) and \\(\\omega = \\omega^2\\). Wait, actually, since the expression is symmetric for \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\), maybe I just need to compute it once and get both values? I'm not sure yet. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for cube roots of unity, the following holds: \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\). This is a key identity that might be helpful here. Also, since \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we can express higher powers of \\(\\omega\\) in terms of lower powers using this property. For example, \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so \\(\\omega^4 = \\omega\\), \\(\\omega^5 = \\omega^2\\), and so on.\n\nSo, coming back to the expression I need to evaluate: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Maybe I can combine these fractions to simplify the expression. To add them together, I need a common denominator. The denominators are \\(1 + \\omega\\) and \\(1 + \\omega^2\\), so the common denominator would be \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\). \n\nWait, before I do that, is there another way? Maybe using the identity \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\). Hmm. Let me try both ways and see which one is simpler.\n\n"

So substituting back into the numerator:\n\n\\(2 + (-1) = 1\\).\n\nOkay, so the numerator simplifies to 1. Now, what about the denominator?\n\nDenominator: \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\).\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n\\(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot 1 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega^2\\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(1 \\cdot 1 = 1\\)\n- \\(1 \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^2\\)\n- \\(\\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega\\)\n- \\(\\omega \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\omega^3\\)\n\nBut \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), so that term is 1. So now, the denominator becomes:\n\n\\(1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\).\n\nAgain, using the identity \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), so \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\). Therefore, denominator is \\(2 + (-1) = 1\\).\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} = 1.\n\\]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So regardless of whether \\(\\omega\\) is the primitive cube root or the other one, the expression evaluates to 1?

Let me think again—maybe I have made a mistake somewhere because I recall that cube roots of unity can sometimes produce different results depending on which root is chosen, but in this case, it seems symmetric.\n\nLet me try another approach using another identity.

Alternatively, maybe this is redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to show that regardless of which cube root (other than 1) you take, the expression is always 1. Since even when \\(\\omega =1\\), it's still 1, so the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values\", so maybe there's a case where it's different? Let me check again.\n\nSuppose \\(\\omega =1\\), then the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} =1\\). If \\(\\omega = \\omega\\), then as we saw, it's 1. Similarly for \\(\\omega^2\\). So, all three roots give the same value. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. So the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something. Let me try plugging in \\(\\omega = \\omega^2\\) and see if the expression is the same. Let me suppose \\(\\omega = \\omega^2\\). Wait, but \\(\\omega^2\\) is another root. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we set \\(\\omega = \\omega^2\\), but actually, \\(\\omega^2\\) is a different root. Let me rephrase. Let me take \\(\\omega\\) as the primitive root, so \\(\\omega^2\\) is its square. So, if I switch \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\), the expression remains the same because it's symmetric in \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\). Therefore, the expression is the same for both roots.
