Hmm, the function f is defined recursively, which can sometimes be a bit tricky, but maybe if I break it down step by step, I can understand it better.\n\nFirst, let me parse the definition of the function f. It's defined for non-negative integers i and j, where j is between 0 and 4. The function has three cases:\n\n1. If i = 0, then f(0, j) is just mod_5(j + 1). So, for i=0 and any j from 0 to 4, it's like incrementing j by 1 and taking the remainder modulo 5. That means:\n   - f(0, 0) = 1\n   - f(0, 1) = 2\n   - f(0, 2) = 3\n   - f(0, 3) = 4\n   - f(0, 4) = 0\n   Wait, no. Hold on. mod_5(0 + 1) is 1, mod_5(1 + 1) is 2, and so on up to mod_5(4 + 1) which is 5 mod 5 = 0. So yes, that's correct.\n\n2. If i ≥ 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1). So, for any i >=1 and j=0, it's equal to f(i-1, 1). That seems like a base case that depends on i-1 and j=1.\n\n3. If i ≥ 1 and j is between 1 and 4, then f(i, j) = f(i -1, f(i, j -1)). Hmm, that's a bit more complex. So, for each i and j (not 0), we have to compute f(i, j -1) first, then plug that result into f(i -1, ...). \n\nSo, it's kind of a recursive descent, decreasing i each time until it reaches 0, and within that, it might keep computing deeper levels. \n\nBut we need to compute f(2015, 2). That's a huge i and j=2. Obviously, we can't compute it"

So for any i >=5, f(i,j)=1.\n\nTherefore, since 2015 is way larger than 5, f(2015,2)=1.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a mistake here. Let me see for i=4, j=0: f(4,0)=3, which is f(3,1)=3. Then for i=5,0: f(5,0)=f(4,1)=1. Then f(5,1)=f(4, f(5,0))=f(4,1)=1. Since f(4,1)=1, so yes, that's correct. Then f(5,2)=f(4, f(5,1))=f(4,1)=1, etc. So indeed, once you hit i=5, everything becomes 1. So for any i >=5, f(i,j)=1 regardless of j. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but let me check for i=4, j=0: f(4,0)=3, so if we go to i=5,0, it's f(4,1)=1. So that's correct. So once you get to i=5, all the values become 1. So yes, the function stabilizes at 1 once i reaches 5. Therefore, for any i >=5, f(i,j)=1. Therefore, f(2015,2)=1.\n\nHmm, but let me see if there's another way to think about this. Maybe the function is related to some kind of Ackermann function or something, but in this case, it seems to stabilize. Alternatively, maybe there's a cycle in the function's values as i increases. Let me see the progression again:\n\ni=0: [1,2,3,4,0]\n\ni=1: [2,3,4,0,1]\n\ni="
