            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side. Since the table is square, rotational arrangements are considered equivalent, so rotations of the same seating arrangement are counted as one.\n\nI'll start by fixing one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. Once one person is fixed, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that there are 2 people on each side, which means there are symmetries within each side that need to be considered. Each side has 2 people, so each side can be arranged in 2! ways. Since there are 4 sides, the total number of internal symmetries is (2!)^4.\n\nTo find the total number of distinct seating arrangements, I'll divide the total permutations by the number of internal symmetries. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 7! divided by (2!)^4.\n\nCalculating the values, 7! is 5040, and (2!)^4 is 16. So, 5040 divided by 16 equals 315.\n\nThus, there are 315 distinct ways to seat the 8 people around the square table with 2 people on each side.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix One Person's Position:**\n   - Since the table is square, rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new configuration. To eliminate rotational symmetry, fix one person in a specific seat.\n\n2. **Arrange the Remaining 7 People:**\n   - With one person fixed, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways.\n   - \\(7! = 5040\\)\n\n3. **Account for Symmetries Within Each Side:**\n   - Each side has 2 people, and these two can be arranged in \\(2!\\) ways.\n   - There are 4 sides, so the total number of internal symmetries is \\((2!)^4\\).\n   - \\((2!)^4 = 16\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Distinct Arrangements:**\n   - Divide the total permutations by the internal symmetries to account for equivalent configurations.\n   - Number of distinct arrangements = \\(\\frac{7!}{"
