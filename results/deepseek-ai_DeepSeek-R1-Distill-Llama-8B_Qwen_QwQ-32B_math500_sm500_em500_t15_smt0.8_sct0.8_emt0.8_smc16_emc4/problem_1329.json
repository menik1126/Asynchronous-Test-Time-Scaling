It's a combination of four rational expressions on the left side, and a linear function on the right. I need to find the sum of all complex solutions. \n\nLet me break this down. First, all the denominators on the left side are quadratic, which suggests that there might be some symmetry or perhaps a substitution that could simplify things. The right side is linear, so maybe I can manipulate the equation to bring everything to one side and factor it somehow.\n\nLet me start by moving the right side to the left side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow, this looks intimidating. The left side has four fractions and a linear term. I need to find a way to combine these terms. Since each fraction has a quadratic denominator, maybe I can find a common denominator. But that would be quite complicated because the denominators are all different. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, another idea. Maybe I can rewrite each fraction in terms of \\( x^2 \\). Let me denote \\( y = x^2 \\). Then each denominator becomes \\( y - 1 \\), \\( y - 2 \\), \\( y - 3 \\), and \\( y - 4 \\), respectively. So substituting, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but now I have \\( y \\) and \\( x \\), which are related by \\( y = x^2 \\). This might not directly help, but it's worth noting. Alternatively"

That might lead to a high-degree polynomial equation, but maybe the sum of roots can be found without solving it explicitly?\n\nWait, the question asks for the sum of all complex solutions. In polynomial equations, the sum of roots is related to the coefficients via Vieta's formula. But this equation isn't a polynomial equation yet. However, if I can manipulate it into a polynomial equation, then Vieta's formula might be applicable.\n\nLet me try to combine all the terms over a common denominator. The denominators are \\( x^2 - 1 \\), \\( x^2 - 2 \\), \\( x^2 - 3 \\), \\( x^2 - 4 \\). The common denominator would be the product of all these denominators. That's going to be a huge expression, but maybe manageable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can simplify the equation. Let me think. Since each term on the left has \\( x^2 - k \\), maybe substituting \\( t = x^2 \\), but then the right side is linear in x, so that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe substituting \\( z = x \\), but that's trivial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the left side is a function of \\( x^2 \\), so perhaps the equation is even in some way? Let me check.\n\nSuppose I let \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} \\). Then the equation is \\( f(x) = 2010x - 4 \\). Since \\( f(x) \\) is even (because it's a function of \\( x^2 \\)), but the right side is an odd function (since it's linear in x). Therefore, the equation is not symmetric, so solutions might not come in pairs like \\( x \\) and \\( -x \\). Hmm, so maybe the sum of roots can't be directly inferred from symmetry?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving all terms to one side and considering the equation as a function \\( F(x) = f(x) - 2010"

But to do that, I need to manipulate the equation into a polynomial, which might require multiplying both sides by the denominators.\n\nLet me try that. The denominators are \\( x^2 - 1 \\), \\( x^2 - 2 \\), \\( x^2 - 3 \\), \\( x^2 - 4 \\). So the least common multiple (LCM) of these denominators is \\( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \\).

So, they are degree 6.\n\nThe last term is \\( - (2010x - 4) \\times (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) \\). The product of four quadratics is degree 8, so \\( (x^2 -1)...(x^2 -4) \\) is degree 8, and multiplying by linear term (2010x -4), it becomes degree 9. So, when we combine all, the equation is a degree 9 polynomial.\n\nSo, after expanding all terms, the left side becomes a 9th degree polynomial set to zero. Therefore, the equation is a 9th-degree polynomial, which will have 9 roots (counting multiplicities) in the complex plane. The sum of all roots is equal to minus the coefficient of \\( x^8 \\) divided by the coefficient of \\( x^9 \\).\n\nBut this seems really complex because expanding all those products would take a lot of time. Maybe there is a smarter way to find the sum of roots without expanding the entire polynomial?\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the equation differently.

The coefficient of \\( x^6 \\) would be the sum of the constants from each quadratic, but that's not needed here.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again.

This results in a polynomial equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 \\right) \\times D(x) = 0.\n\\]\n\nAfter expanding and simplifying, the resulting polynomial \\(P(x)\\) is of degree 9. The leading term of \\(P(x)\\) comes from the term \\(-2010x \\cdot D(x)\\), giving a leading coefficient of \\(-2010\\). The coefficient of \\(x^8\\) is found by considering the constant term from \\(-4 \\cdot D(x)\\), resulting in a coefficient of \\(4\\).\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial \\(P(x)\\) is given by \\(-\\frac{\\text{coefficient of } x^8}{\\text{coefficient of } x^9}\\). Substituting the coefficients, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of roots} = -\\frac{4}{-2010} = \\frac{4}{2010} = \\frac{2}{1005}.\n\\]\n\nWe verified that none of the excluded values (where the original equation is undefined) are roots of \\(P(x)\\). Therefore, the sum of all complex solutions of the original equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{1005}}.\n\\]"
