Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down, it'll make more sense.\n\nLet me start by understanding the function definition. The function f is defined recursively with three cases:\n\n1. If i = 0 and j is between 0 and 4 (inclusive), then f(0, j) is just mod_5(j + 1). That part seems straightforward because it's the base case.\n\n2. If i is greater than or equal to 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) is equal to f(i - 1, 1). So, whenever j is 0, the function calls itself with i decreased by 1 and j set to 1.\n\n3. If i is at least 1 and j is between 1 and 4, then f(i, j) is f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). That's the recursive case where the function calls itself with i decreased by 1 and j decreased by 1, but also using the result from f(i, j - 1) as the new j.\n\nAlright, so the function seems to be building a kind of sequence or path based on the values of i and j. The base case is when i=0, which gives us f(0, j) = mod_5(j + 1). So for i=0, it's just straightforward modulo 5 on j+1.\n\nGiven that, I need to find f(2015, 2). That's quite a large i value, so I don't think I can compute it directly. Maybe there's a pattern or cycle that repeats every certain number of steps, which would allow me to find the value without computing all intermediate steps.\n\nLet me try to compute some small values of f(i, j) to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with i=0:\n- f(0, 0) = mod_5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0, 1) = mod_5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0, 2) = mod_5(2 + 1) = 3\n- f(0, 3"

Let's see:\n\nFirst, f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2 (from the second case).\n\nThen for j=1:\nf(1,1) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0, 2) = 3 (since f(1,0) is 2, so mod_5(2 +1)=3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, f(0,2) is mod_5(2+1)=3, yes. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, f(1,2) = f(0, f(1,1)) = f(0,3) = 4.\n\nf(1,3) = f(0, f(1,2)) = f(0,4) = 0.\n\nf(1,4) = f(0, f(1,3)) = f(0,0) = 1 (since f(1,3) is 0, so mod_5(0 +1)=1? Wait, no, f(0,0) is mod_5(0+1)=1, yes. So f(1,4)=1.\n\nSo for i=1, the values are:\n- f(1,0)=2\n- f(1,1)=3\n- f(1,2)=4\n- f(1,3)=0\n- f(1,4)=1\n\nHmm, interesting. Let's see if there's a pattern here. The sequence for i=1 is 2,3,4,0,1. So it's like shifted by 1 from the i=0 sequence. The i=0 sequence was 1,2,3,4,0. So i=1 is shifted by +1 mod 5?
