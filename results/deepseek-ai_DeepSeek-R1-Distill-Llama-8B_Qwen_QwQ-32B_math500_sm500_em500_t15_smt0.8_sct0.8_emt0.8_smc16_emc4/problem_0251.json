The numerator 31 is a prime number. The denominator 11111 can be factored into 41 and 271.\n\nNext, I'll check if the numerator shares any common factors with the denominator. Since 31 is a prime number and does not divide evenly into 41 or 271, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe next step is to perform long division of 31 by 11111 to find the decimal representation. The long division process will reveal a repeating decimal pattern, but to identify how many digits are repeating, I'll use a mathematical approach.\n\nI'll calculate the length of the repeating cycle by finding the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11111} \\). This involves finding the order of 10 modulo 11111. Once \\( k \\) is determined, the number of repeating digits will be equal to \\( k \\).\n\nTo find \\( k \\), I'll factorize 11111 into its prime factors, which are 41 and 271. The least common multiple of the orders of 10 modulo 41 and 271 will give me the overall order of 10 modulo 11111.\n\nCalculating the order of 10 modulo 41, I find that it's 6. Similarly, the order of 10 modulo 271 is 18. The least common multiple of 6 and 18 is 18. Therefore, \\( k = 18 \\).\n\nThus, the decimal representation of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) will have a repeating cycle of 18 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of repeating digits when converting \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) to a decimal, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111}\n   \\]\n   Both the numerator and the denominator are integers, and we need to convert this into a decimal.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - The numerator is **31**, which is a prime number.\n   - The denominator is **11111**.

We need to find the order of 10 modulo 11111.\n\n5. **Factorize the Denominator:**\n   Since \\( 11111 = 41 \\times 271 \\), we'll compute the orders of 10 modulo 41 and modulo 271 separately, then take their least common multiple (LCM).\n\n6. **Order of 10 Modulo 41:**\n   - Find the smallest \\( k_1 \\) such that \\( 10^{k_1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41} \\).\n   - Testing powers of 10 modulo 41:\n     \\[\n     10^1 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{41}, \\quad 10^2 \\equiv 18 \\pmod{41}, \\quad 10^3 \\equiv 10 \\times 18 = 180 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{41}, \\quad \\ldots\n     \\]\n     Continuing this process, we find \\( k_1 = 5 \\) is too small, but further calculations show \\( k_1 = 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\) also not.
