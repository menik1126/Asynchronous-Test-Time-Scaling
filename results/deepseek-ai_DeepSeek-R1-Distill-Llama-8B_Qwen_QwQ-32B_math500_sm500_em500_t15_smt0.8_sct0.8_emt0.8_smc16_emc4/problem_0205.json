            "output": "Alright, so I've got this equation to solve: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that for polynomials, one method to find integer roots is the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms \\(p/q\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots should be the factors of -14 divided by the factors of 1, which simplifies to just the factors of -14.\n\nSo, the possible integer roots are the factors of -14. Let's list them out. The factors of -14 are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. That gives me eight possible values to test.\n\nNow, I need to plug each of these into the equation and see if it equals zero. That means substituting each value for x and solving to see if the equation balances out.\n\nLet me start with x = 1. Plugging that in: \\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\). Calculating each term step by step: 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 -14. Adding them up: 1+5 is 6, 6+9 is 15, 15-1 is 14, 14-14 is 0. Oh, that works! So, x=1 is a root.\n\nNext, let's try x = -1. Plugging that in: \\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) -14\\). Calculating each term: 1 + (-5) + 9 +1 -14. Adding them up: 1-5 is -4, -4+9 is 5, 5+1 is 6, 6-14 is -8. Not zero, so x=-1 is not a root.\n\nMoving on to x=2. Plugging in: \\(2^4 + 5("

Let's see: \\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) -14\\). Calculating each term: 16 + (-40) + 36 +2 -14. Adding up: 16-40=-24, -24+36=12, 12+2=14, 14-14=0. Oh, that works! So, x=-2 is another root.\n\nNow, let's test x=7. That seems a bit big, but let me try: \\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 -7 -14\\). Calculating each term: 2401 + 5(343) + 9(49) -7 -14. Let me compute step by step: 5*343 is 1715, 9*49 is 441. So adding all together: 2401 + 1715 is 4116, 4116 + 441 is 4557. Then subtract 7 and 14: 4557 -7=4550, 4550-14=4536. That's way off, not zero.\n\nTesting x=-7: Plugging in, \\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) -14\\). Calculating each term: 2401 + 5*(-343) + 9*49 +7 -14. Let's compute: 5*(-343) is -1715, 9*49 is 441. So adding them: 2401 -1715 = 686, 686 +441=1127, 1127 +7=1134, 1134 -14=1120. Not zero.\n\nHow about x=14? That's even bigger. Let's compute: \\(14^4 + 5(14)^3 + 9(14)^2 -14 -14\\). Hmm, 14^2 is 196, "

Adding them: 38416 +13720 = 52136, 52136 +1764=538900? Wait, no, 52136 +1764: 52136+1000=53136, +764=53899 +1=53900? Wait, no, let me check: 52136 +1764. 52136 + 1000=53136, 53136 +764: 53136+700=53836, +64=53900. Then subtract 14 and 14: 53900 -28=53872. Definitely not zero.\n\nNow x=-14: Plugging in, \\((-14)^4 +5(-14)^3 +9(-14)^2 - (-14) -14\\). Calculating each term: 14^4=38416, 5*(-14)^3=5*(-2744)= -13720, 9*(14)^2=9*196=1764. So, adding them: 38416 -13720 = 24696, 24696 +1764=26460, 26460 +14=26474, 26474 -14=26460. Not zero.\n\nSo from testing all possible integer roots, the candidates that worked were x=1 and x=-2.\n\nBut wait a minute, the polynomial is of degree four, so there should be four roots, right? But maybe some are complex or irrational. So, if I found two integer roots, I can factor them out and solve the remaining quadratic equation.\n\nLet's try that. Since x=1 and x=-2 are roots, then (x -1) and (x +2) are factors. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor them out.\n\nFirst, let's write the polynomial as \\(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\\).\n\nLet's try dividing by (x -1) first.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root x=1:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2"

Perfect.\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as (x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, let's factor x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14.\n\nLet's test the remaining possible integer roots for this cubic: possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nWe already tried x=-2 and x=1, so let's try x=-2 again on the cubic.\n\nCompute: (-2)^3 +6*(-2)^2 +15*(-2) +14.\n\nWhich is: -8 +6*4 + (-30) +14.\n\nCalculates: -8 +24=16, 16-30=-14, -14 +14=0. So, x=-2 is again a root.\n\nThus, (x +2) is a factor. Let's divide the cubic by (x +2) using synthetic division.\n\nSet up:\n\n-2 | 1   6   15   14\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply -2*1=-2, add to next coefficient: 6 + (-2)=4.\n\nMultiply -2*4=-8, add to next coefficient:15 + (-8)=7.\n\nMultiply -2*7=-14, add to last coefficient:14 + (-14)=0.
