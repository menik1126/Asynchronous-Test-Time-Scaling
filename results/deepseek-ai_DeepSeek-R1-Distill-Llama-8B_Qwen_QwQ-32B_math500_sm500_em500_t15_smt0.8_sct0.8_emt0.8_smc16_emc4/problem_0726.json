But let's take it step by step.\n\nThe problem is: If \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\) and \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\), then find \\(x\\).\n\nHmm, okay. So there are two equations here, both involving logarithms. I need to solve for \\(x\\), probably using substitution or elimination. Let me write them down again to have them clear:\n\n1. \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\)\n2. \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\)\n\nStarting with the first equation. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's like multiplying the arguments. So, \\(\\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (a \\times c)\\). Applying that here, the left side becomes \\(\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)]\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\\). \n\nNow, \\((x - y)(x + y)\\) is a difference of squares, which simplifies to \\(x^2 - y^2\\). So, the equation becomes \\(\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\\).\n\nTo get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) is equivalent to \\(b^c = a\\). So, \\(6^2 = x^2 - y^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(6^2\\) gives \\(36 = x^2 - y^2\\). So, equation 1 simplifies to \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\). Got that.\n\nMoving on to the second equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\). Again, I can convert this logarithmic equation to an exponential one. Using the same rule, this means that \\(y^2 = 5x\\). So, \\(5x = y^2\\), which can be rewritten as \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{5}\\"

Let's do that. Replace \\(x\\) with \\(\\frac{y^2}{5}\\) in equation 1.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(\\frac{y^2}{5}\\right)^2 - y^2 = 36\\).\n\nCalculating the first term: \\(\\left(\\frac{y^2}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{y^4}{25}\\).\n\nSo now, the equation becomes \\(\\frac{y^4}{25} - y^2 = 36\\).\n\nHmm, this is a quartic equation, but maybe I can make a substitution to make it easier. Let me set \\(z = y^2\\). Then, \\(y^4 = z^2\\).\n\nSubstituting in, the equation becomes \\(\\frac{z^2}{25} - z = 36\\).\n\nTo eliminate the denominator, I can multiply the entire equation by 25:\n\n\\(25 \\times \\frac{z^2}{25} - 25 \\times z = 25 \\times 36\\).\n\nSimplifying, this gives \\(z^2 - 25z = 900\\).\n\nRearranging, we have \\(z^2 - 25z - 900 = 0\\). Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of \\(z\\), which I can solve using the quadratic formula.\n\nQuadratic formula: \\(z = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -25\\), and \\(c = -900\\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant: \\(b^2 - 4ac = (-25)^2 - 4(1)(-900) = 625 + 3600 = 4225\\).\n\nThe square root of 4225 is 65.\n\nSo, \\(z = \\frac{25 \\pm 65}{2}\\).\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n1. \\(z = \\frac{25 + 65}{2} ="

So, \\(z = 45\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(y^2 = 45\\), which means \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\). But wait, I need to check if these values are valid in the original logarithmic equations.\n\nLooking back at the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y)\\) and \\(\\log_6 (x + y)\\). The arguments of logarithms must be positive, so:\n\n\\(x - y > 0\\) and \\(x + y > 0\\).\n\nLet's consider \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\). Then, \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{5} = \\frac{45}{5} = 9\\). So, \\(x = 9\\).\n\nCheck the conditions:\n\n1. \\(x - y = 9 - \\sqrt{45}\\). Since \\(sqrt(45)\\) is approximately 6.708, so 9 - 6.708 is positive, which is good.\n2. \\(x + y = 9 + \\sqrt{45}\\), which is definitely positive.\n\nNow, if \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\), then \\(x = \\frac{45}{5} = 9\\) as well. So, \\(x = 9\\), but \\(y = -sqrt(45)\\) which is negative.\n\nCheck the conditions:\n\n1. \\(x - y = 9 - (-sqrt(45)) = 9 + sqrt(45)\\), which is positive.\n2. \\(x + y = 9 + (-sqrt(45))\\), which is approximately 9 - 6.708 = 2.292, also positive.\n\nWait, so both \\(y = sqrt(45)\\) and \\(y = -sqrt(45)\\) give us positive arguments for the logarithms. So, both are valid? Hmm, but maybe there's something else to consider.\n\nLet me plug these back into the second equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\"

Remember, \\(\\log_b a = c\\) implies \\(b^c = a\\).\n\nSo, \\((sqrt(45))^2 = 45\\), which is correct. So, yes, \\(2 = 2\\), which checks out.\n\n2. If \\(y = -sqrt(45)\\), then \\(\\log_{-sqrt(45)} 45 = 2\\).\n\nWait, but logarithms with negative bases are problematic. Because the logarithm function is only defined for positive real numbers, and the base must be positive and not 1. So, a base of \\(-sqrt(45)\\) is negative, which is not allowed. Therefore, \\(y\\) cannot be negative in this case.\n\nTherefore, only \\(y = sqrt(45)\\) is valid, leading to \\(x = 9\\).\n\nSo, the value of \\(x\\) is 9.\n\nBut let me just double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the first equation: logs added, converted to product, difference of squares, got 36 = x² - y². Then, second equation: log base y of 5x is 2, so y² = 5x. Then, substituted x = y²/5 into first equation, leading to (y²/5)² - y² = 36 which is y^4/25 - y² = 36. Multiplied by 25 to get y^4 - 25y² - 900 = 0, then set z = y², making it z² -25z -900 =0, solved quadratic, got z=45 or z=-20, rejected negative, so z=45. Thus, y=±sqrt(45), but checked that y must be positive, so y=sqrt(45), and hence x=9.\n\nI think that's correct. So, x is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given equations, we start by using logarithmic properties and substitution.\n\n1.
