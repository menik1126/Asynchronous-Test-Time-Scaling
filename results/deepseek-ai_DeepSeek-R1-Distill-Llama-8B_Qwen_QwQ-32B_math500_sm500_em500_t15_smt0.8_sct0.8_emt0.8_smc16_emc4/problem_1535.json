Maybe I can use some kind of inequality or optimization technique here. Let me think\u2014like the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for sums.\n\nWait, another thought: for positive numbers, there's the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which relates the sum of products to the product of sums. Also, maybe the inequality involving the sum of squares and the square of sums. Oh, right, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in another form: \\( (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\dots + a_n^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + \\dots + 1^2) \\geq (a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n)^2 \\).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\( S_2 \\times n \\geq (S_1)^2 \\)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\( 144 \\times n \\geq 96^2 \\)\n\nCalculate \\( 96^2 \\): 96*96 is 9216.

Is that the case? Hmm, when does equality hold in Cauchy-Schwarz? When all the \\( a_i \\)s are equal. So if all \\( a_i \\)s are equal, then we can compute them.\n\nSo let me suppose that all \\( a_i \\) are equal. Then \\( a_i = 96/n \\) for each i. Then the sum of squares would be \\( n*(96/n)^2 = 96^2 / n \\). We know the sum of squares is 144, so:\n\n\\( 96^2 / n = 144 \\)\n\nWhich gives \\( n = 96^2 / 144 \\) as before, which is 64.

Perhaps the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for cubes? Or perhaps use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the relationship between the sums. Let me think about Newton's identities, which relate power sums to elementary symmetric sums. But that might complicate things because I don't know the elementary symmetric sums.\n\nAlternatively, there's the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for three variables or higher. Wait, perhaps I can use H\u00f6lder's inequality. H\u00f6lder's inequality might be applicable here because we have three different power sums.\n\nH\u00f6lder's inequality states that for positive real numbers \\( a_i \\), and exponents \\( p, q \\) such that \\( 1/p + 1/q = 1 \\), we have:\n\n\\( \\sum a_i b_i \\leq (\\sum a_i^p)^{1/p} (\\"

Hmm, interesting.\n\nBut we also have the sum of squares and the sum of cubes. Maybe we can consider the ratio of the sum of cubes to the sum of squares to get some information.\n\nLet me compute that ratio:\n\n\\( S_3 / S_2 = 216 / 144 = 1.5 \\)\n\nHmm, so the sum of cubes is 1.5 times the sum of squares.\n\nIs there a relationship that can give me more information about the individual terms?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the variance or something related.

So the numbers are getting smaller on average.\n\nBut if the average is smaller, does that allow for the sum of cubes to still be 216?\n\nWait, let me compute the sum of cubes when all \\( a_i \\)s are equal: \\( n \\times (96/n)^3 = 96^3 / n^2 \\).\n\nWe have \\( 96^3 / n^2 = 216 \\"

Therefore, 96^3 = (1.5)^3 * 64^3, so:\n\n\\( (1.5)^3 * 64^3 / 64^2 = 1.5^3 * 64 = 3.375 * 64 = 216 \\). Yes, that works. So when n=64, the sum of cubes is indeed 216. So that's consistent.\n\nBut if n is larger than 64, then the sum of cubes would be less than 216? Let me see.\n\nSuppose n is 65. Then, if all a_i are equal, the sum of cubes would be 96^3 / 65^2. Let me compute that:\n\n96^3 = 884736, 65^2 = 4225, so 884736 / 4225 \u2248 209.3, which is less than 216. But in our problem, the sum of cubes is 216, so that's not possible. Therefore, if n is larger than 64, the sum of cubes would be smaller than 216 if all a_i are equal. But maybe if some a_i are larger and some smaller, can we get the sum of cubes to be higher?\n\nHmm, perhaps. Let me think of an example. Suppose we have some numbers larger than the average and some smaller. Let me see.\n\nSuppose we have two different values: let's say some of the a_i are x and others are y. Let me try with two variables.

We can model this as a constrained optimization: maximize and minimize n?\n\nWait, no, n is fixed for each sequence. But the problem is that we need to find all possible n such that there exists a sequence with these sums. So n must be at least 64, but can it be higher?\n\nFrom the Cauchy-Schwarz and H\u00f6lder's inequalities, we saw that n must be at least 64, but can it be higher? When n=64, we can achieve the required sums. Now, can we have a larger n?\n\nWait, but let me test for n=65. Is it possible to have a sequence of 65 positive real numbers where sum is 96, sum of squares is 144, and sum of cubes is 216?\n\nIf all a_i are equal, they would be 96/65 \u2248 1.4769. Then sum of squares would be 65*(96/65)^2 = 96^2 / 65 \u2248 9216 / 65 \u2248 142, which is less than 144. But we need the sum of squares to be 144, which is higher. Therefore, if all a_i are slightly larger than 96/65, but wait, this might not be possible because the sum would then exceed 96.\n\nAlternatively, can we have some numbers higher than average and some lower to compensate? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we have one number higher than average and the rest lower. Let me try to construct such a sequence.\n\nLet me denote the average as \\( \\mu = 96/n \\). When n=65"

That doesn't help us; it's actually making the sum of cubes larger.\n\nBut in reality, with n=65, the sum of cubes when all terms are equal is less than 216, and this configuration actually increases the sum of cubes. Hmm.\n\nSo perhaps n=65 is impossible because either the sum of cubes can't reach 216, or it's too low when all are equal.\n\nWait, is there a way to configure the numbers so that the sum of cubes is exactly 216 when n=65?\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Because in the example I tried, when I adjusted the numbers to get sum of squares higher, the sum of cubes went up, but when they're all equal, it's too low. So maybe it's not possible to have a sequence where all three constraints are satisfied for n=65.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find another configuration where the sum of cubes is 216. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let's try to model the problem with the three equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet \\( s_1 = 96 \\), \\( s_2 = 144 \\), \\( s_3 = 216 \\), and \\( k = n \\).\n\nWe have:\n\n1. \\( \\sum a_i = s_1 = 96 \\)\n2. \\( \\sum a_i^2 = s_2 = 144 \\)\n3. \\( \\sum a_i^3 = s_3 = 216 \\)\n\nWe need to find possible values of \\( k = n \\).\n\nFrom Cauchy-Schwarz, we know \\( k \\geq 64 \\). Now, can \\( k \\) be higher than 64?\n\nSuppose \\( k > 64 \\). Then, the average \\( \\mu = 96/k < 96/64 = 1.5 \\).\n\nFrom the variance formula:\n\n\\( \\sigma^2 = \\frac{s_2}{k} - \\mu^2 = \\frac{144}{k} - \\left( \\frac{96}{k} \\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{k} - \\frac{9216}{k^2} \\)\n\nWe can also compute the third moment, which is \\( \\sum a_i^3 \\).

Suppose n approaches infinity. Then, the average \u03bc approaches zero. The sum of squares is fixed at 144, so the variance would be dominated by the terms \\( \\frac{144}{n} \\), so the variance would go to zero. But the sum of cubes would be approximately \\( n \\times \\mu^3 \\), which would go to zero. Since the required sum of cubes is 216, which is positive, this suggests that n can't be too large. But how large?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an upper bound on n beyond which the sum of cubes can't reach 216.\n\nWait, let me consider the case when n=144. Then, the average \u03bc=96/144=0.666...\n\nThe sum of squares would be 144, so each term squared would average 1, so the terms would be around 1.
