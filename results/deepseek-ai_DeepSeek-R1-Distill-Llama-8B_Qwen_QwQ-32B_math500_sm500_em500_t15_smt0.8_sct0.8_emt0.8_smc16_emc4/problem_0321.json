This can be done using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the boys is C(7, 3).\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4 using the same combination formula: C(4, 2).\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls.\n\nThus, the total number of ways is C(7, 3) multiplied by C(4, 2).\n\nOnce I have the values for both combinations, multiplying them will give the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll use the concept of combinations. The order in which the boys and girls are selected does not matter, so combinations are appropriate here.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\nWhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items.\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for the boys:\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}\n\\]\nCalculating this:\n\\[\n7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4! \\\\\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{3! \\times 4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\nUsing the same combination formula:\n\\[\nC(4"
