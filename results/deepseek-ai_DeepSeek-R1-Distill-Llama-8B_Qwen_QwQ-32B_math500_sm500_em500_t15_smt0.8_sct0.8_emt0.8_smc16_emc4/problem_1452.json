            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I should probably recall some exponent rules. I know that 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, which simplifies to 9^x. So, I can rewrite the equation as 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That seems a bit simpler.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Since we have exponential terms with different bases, 9 and 10, it might be difficult to solve this algebraically. Maybe I can use logarithms or some kind of substitution. Let me think. If I let y = 10^x, then 9^x can be expressed in terms of y as well. Since 9 is 10^(log10(9)), right? So, 9^x = (10^{log10(9)})^x = 10^{x log10(9)}. So, I can write 10^{x log10(9)} + 19 = y. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the logarithm of both sides. Let me try that. Taking natural log or common log, it might work similarly. Let's try taking the natural logarithm. So, ln(9^x + 19) = ln(10^x). That gives ln(9^x + 19) = x ln(10). Hmm, that still looks complicated because of the addition inside the logarithm. Logarithms usually don't work well with sums like that.\n\nMaybe graphing would help. If I consider the function f(x) = 10^x - 9^x - 19, then finding the roots of f(x) = 0 would give me the solutions. Let me think about the behavior of this function.\n\nWhen x is 0, f(0) = 1 - 1 - 19 = -19, which is negative. When x is 1, f(1) = 10 - 9 - 19 = -18, still negative. Hmm, maybe at x=2, f(2) = 100 - 81 - 19 = 0. Wait, that's exactly zero. So,"

            "output": " x=2 is a solution?\n\nWait, let me check that again. 10^2 is 100, 9^2 is 81. So 81 +19 = 100, so 100 = 100. So yes, that works. So x=2 is a solution. But are there other solutions?\n\nLet me check x=3. f(3)=1000 - 729 -19 = 252, which is positive. So between x=2 and x=3, the function goes from 0 to positive. What about for x less than 2?\n\nAt x=1.5, let's see: 10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3) ≈ 31.62, 9^1.5 is sqrt(9^3)=sqrt(729)=27. So 27 +19 =46, so f(1.5)=31.62 -27 -19 ≈ -14.38, still negative.\n\nAt x=2, it's zero. What about x=2.5? 10^2.5 is 10^2 * 10^0.5 ≈ 100*3.16≈316. 9^2.5 is 9^2 * sqrt(9)=81*3=243. So 243 +19=262. Then f(2.5)=316 -243 -19≈316-262=54, positive. So between x=2 and 2.5, it's positive. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another solution when x is negative? Let's check x= -1. Then f(-1)=10^{-1} -9^{-1} -19 ≈0.1 -0.111 -19≈-19.01, which is negative. So maybe only x=2 is the solution?\n\nWait, but let me check between x=2 and higher. Since at x=2, it's zero, and then it becomes positive. So maybe x=2 is the only real solution. Let me see if there's another solution"

So f(-0.5)=0.316 -0.333 -19≈-19.017, which is still negative.\n\nSo perhaps x=2 is the only solution. But to be thorough, maybe I can analyze the function.\n\nLet me consider the function f(x) = 10^x -9^x -19. Let's compute its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing. The derivative f’(x)=ln(10)*10^x - ln(9)*9^x.\n\nSo, at x=2, what's the derivative? ln(10)*100 - ln(9)*81 ≈ 2.3026*100 - 2.1972*81 ≈ 230.26 - 177.55 ≈52.71, which is positive. So the function is increasing at x=2.\n\nWhat about at x=0: f’(0)=ln(10)*1 - ln(9)*1≈2.3026 -2.1972≈0.1054, positive. So the function is increasing at x=0 as well.\n\nWait, but the function at x=0 is f(0)= -19, and x=1, it's -18, which is increasing but still negative. At x=2, it's zero, and it's increasing. So perhaps there is only one solution at x=2.\n\nWait, but let's think about the behavior for very large x. As x approaches infinity, 10^x grows much faster than 9^x, so 10^x -9^x -19 will definitely go to infinity. So, x=2 is the only solution where they cross.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me see if maybe there is another crossing point. Suppose for some x <2, maybe the function crosses zero again.\n\nWait, let me try at x=0.5. 10^0.5≈3.16, 9^0.5=3. So f(0.5)=3.16 -3 -19≈-18.84, still negative.\n\nAt x=1: f(1)=10 -"

So it's monotonically increasing from x=0 to infinity, starting at -19 and going up. So it can only cross zero once. Therefore, x=2 is the only solution.\n\nWait, but what about for x less than 0? Let's see, as x approaches negative infinity, 10^x approaches zero, 9^x also approaches zero, so f(x)=0 -0 -19 = -19. So it's always negative there. So the function is increasing from -19 upwards, crosses zero at x=2, and then continues increasing. So only one solution at x=2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x=2. Let me check again in the original equation:\n\n3^{2*2} +19 = 3^4 +19 =81 +19=100, and 10^2=100. Yep, that works. So I think that's the only solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we start by rewriting \\(3^{2x}\\) as \\(9^x\\).
