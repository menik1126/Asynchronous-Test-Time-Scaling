            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find P(16) for a quadratic polynomial P(x). The problem says that P(x) is a quadratic with real coefficients, and it satisfies the inequality x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for all real numbers x. Also, they give me that P(11) = 181. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that P(x) is a quadratic, so it should have the general form P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real coefficients. My goal is to find these coefficients so that I can compute P(16). \n\nThe problem gives me that P(x) is bounded between two quadratics for all real x. That is, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 is less than or equal to P(x), which is less than or equal to 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3. So, this gives me some inequalities that I can work with.\n\nLet me write this down:\n\nFor all x \u2208 \u211d, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3.\n\nSo, plugging P(x) into the middle, we have:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 ax\u00b2 + bx + c \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3.\n\nSince this is true for all real x, the quadratic in the middle (ax\u00b2 + bx + c) must lie between those two given quadratics everywhere. That probably means that P(x) touches both the lower and upper bounds exactly at some points, maybe the vertices of the parabolas. Otherwise, if it's strictly between them, how do we have equality at certain points? Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, since both are quadratics opening upwards (because the coefficients of x\u00b2 are positive), P(x) must be squeezed between these two parabolas. So, maybe P(x) is tangent to both of them at some points? Or maybe they just touch at one point each?\n\nAlternatively, another way is to consider that the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is non-negative, and the difference between the upper bound and P(x) is non-negative. So, two inequalities:\n\n1. ax\u00b2 + bx +"

Since these are quadratic inequalities, their corresponding quadratic expressions must be non-negative for all x, which requires that their leading coefficients are non-negative and their discriminants are non-positive (so they don't cross the x-axis).\n\nLet me write the first inequality as:\n\n(ax\u00b2 + bx + c) - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = (a - 1)x\u00b2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) \u2265 0 for all x.\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality:\n\n(2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3) - (ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = (2 - a)x\u00b2 + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) \u2265 0 for all x.\n\nSo, both of these quadratics must be non-negative for all real x.

Leading coefficient (a - 1) \u2265 0 \u21d2 a \u2265 1.\n\n2.

So yes, perhaps both quadratics that bound P(x) must be tangent to P(x) at some points, which might not be the same point.\n\nBut since the bounds are holding for all x, P(x) must be in between, so maybe P(x) touches both lower and upper bounds at exactly one point each.

Using P(11) = 181, we find a = 9/5. Substituting a into P(x), we compute P(16) as 406.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{406}"
