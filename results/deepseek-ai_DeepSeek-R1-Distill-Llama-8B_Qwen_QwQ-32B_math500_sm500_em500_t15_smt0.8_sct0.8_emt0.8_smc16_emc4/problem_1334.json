Okay, let me start by understanding the equation better.\n\nFirst, I notice that each term on the left side has the form \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\) where \\(n\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. That might be a pattern I can use somehow.\n\nSince the equation is a rational equation, maybe I can clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by the product of all denominators. But before that, let me write all the denominators:\n\n\\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\).\n\nSo the product of denominators is \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). That seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me denote the left side as \\(LHS\\) and the right side as \\(RHS\\):\n\n\\(LHS = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4}\\)\n\n\\(RHS = 2010x - 4\\)\n\nSo, to eliminate denominators, I can multiply both sides by the product of denominators. Let me denote \\(D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). Then,\n\n\\(D \\cdot LHS = D \\cdot RHS\\)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\(1 \\cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 - 1"

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider a substitution.\n\nLet me think: Each term is of the form \\(k/(x^2 - k)\\). Wait, if I let \\(y = x^2\\), then each term becomes \\(k/(y - k)\\). But I'm not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the equation:\n\n\\( \\sum_{n=1}^4 \\frac{n}{x^2 - n} = 2010x -4 \\)\n\nI can rewrite each fraction as \\(\\frac{n}{(x - \\sqrt{n})(x + \\sqrt{n})}\\). But I don't know if partial fractions would help here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can let \\(t = x\\), so that we have a function \\(f(t)\\) equal to RHS, and then \\(f(t) = 2010 t -4\\). But perhaps that's not useful.\n\nWait, maybe instead of dealing with the equation directly, I can think about the left-hand side as a function and the right-hand side as another function, and analyze their behavior to find possible solutions.\n\nBut since this is a rational equation, eventually, we have to clear the denominators. So perhaps I should proceed with that.\n\nSo, let me write the equation again:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x -4 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\):\n\nLeft side becomes:\n\n\\(1 \\cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2"

Let me see the degrees.\n\nFirst, the left side: Each term in the left side is a product of three quadratic terms (since each denominator is quadratic, and when multiplied by the numerator, which is a constant, so each term is a product of three quadratics, so each term is degree 6. Then adding four terms of degree 6, so the left side is a degree 6 polynomial.\n\nThe right side: The RHS is (2010x -4) multiplied by a product of four quadratics, so that's (2010x -4) * (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). The product of four quadratics is degree 8, so multiplied by a linear term gives degree 9. So the right side is a degree 9 polynomial.\n\nTherefore, moving everything to one side, the equation becomes a degree 9 polynomial equation. So, the equation is of degree 9, so there are 9 roots (counting multiplicity) in the complex plane. But we have to consider that when we multiplied both sides by D, we might have introduced extraneous roots where D=0, i.e., x^2 =1,2,3,4. So x=\u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12. These are excluded from the domain of the original equation, so any solutions among these would have to be discarded.\n\nTherefore, the original equation has solutions among the roots of the degree 9 equation, excluding those 8 values. But since the problem says \"sum of all complex solutions\", perhaps we can use Vieta's formula on the polynomial equation, then subtract the sum of the excluded roots? Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trick here. Let me think again.\n\nThe equation is:\n\nSum_{k="

But in such a case, the equation becomes:\n\nSum_{k=1}^4 (k/(y -k)) = 2010x -4\n\nBut now, x = sqrt(y) or -sqrt(y). But the equation is not symmetric in x, because the right-hand side is linear in x. So that substitution might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that (x^2 -k) = (x - sqrt(k))(x + sqrt(k)), so partial fractions may help here. However, as each term is simple, maybe not. Let me try substituting t = x.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that 2010x -4 is a linear function, while the left side is a sum of hyperbola-like terms. Maybe this equation has only one real solution or something like that, but since we are supposed to find the sum of all complex solutions, maybe we can find the sum without finding each root.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can consider the polynomial equation we get after clearing denominators, which is of degree 9. Let me denote this polynomial as P(x) = 0, where P(x) is the left side minus (2010x -4)*D.\n\nThen, the sum of all roots of P(x) is equal to - coefficient of x^8 divided by coefficient of x^9, by Vieta's formula.\n\nBut in this case, since the equation is constructed by clearing denominators, the roots will include all solutions except those making D=0, so we have to make sure to include or exclude them accordingly.\n\nWait, but since D=0 when x^2=1,2,3,4, which are excluded, so any roots at x=\u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12 must not be considered as solutions, but the original equation can have other roots elsewhere.\n\nHowever, when we cleared denominators, we multiplied both sides by D, so if any root x=a is such that a^2=1,2,3,4, then at x=a, both sides become undefined (left side has division by zero, right side becomes something finite if a\u22600, or undefined if a=0).

Wait, actually, when we multiply both sides by D(x), the equation becomes P(x)=0, but if D(x)=0, then the original equation is undefined, so those points are not solutions. Therefore, the roots of P(x)=0 include the solutions of the original equation plus possibly some extraneous roots at the points where D(x)=0. Therefore, the solutions of the original equation are exactly the roots of P(x)=0 except those 8 points. Therefore, the sum of the solutions of the original equation is equal to the sum of all roots of P(x)=0 minus the sum of the roots at x=\u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the sum of all roots of P(x)=0, then subtract the sum of those 8 excluded roots, that would give the desired sum.\n\nTherefore, let me try to compute the sum of roots of P(x)=0 first.\n\nFirst, let me note that P(x) is the left side minus the right side multiplied by D(x).

Since D is the product over all (x^2 -j), so D/(x^2 -k) is the product over j\u2260k of (x^2 -j). So each term is k * product_{j\u2260k} (x^2 -j). Therefore, the left side after multiplying by D is:\n\nSum_{k=1}^4 [k * product_{j\u2260k} (x^2 -j) ]\n\nThen, the right side after multiplying by D is (2"

So the equation is:\n\nSum_{k=1}^4 [k * product_{j\u2260k} (x^2 -j) ] - (2010x -4) * D = 0\n\nThus, P(x) is this combination.\n\nSo, to write P(x), let's compute the left side:\n\nEach term in the sum is:\n\nFor k=1: 1 * (x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4)\n\nFor k=2: 2 * (x^2 -1)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4)\n\nFor k=3: 3 * (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -4)\n\nFor k=4: 4 * (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)\n\nThen, the right side is (2010x -4) * (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4)\n\nSo P(x) is equal to:\n\n[1*(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 2*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 3*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -4) + 4*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)] - (2010x -4)*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) = 0\n\nNow, to compute P(x), maybe I can factor out (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4), or at least try to see how it's structured.\n\nLet me denote Q(x) = (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4).
