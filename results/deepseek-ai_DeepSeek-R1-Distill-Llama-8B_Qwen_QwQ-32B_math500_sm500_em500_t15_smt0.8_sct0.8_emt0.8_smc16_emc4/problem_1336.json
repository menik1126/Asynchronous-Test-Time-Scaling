Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the left-hand side (LHS) consists of four terms, each of which is a fraction with a quadratic expression in the denominator. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\), and each numerator is a consecutive integer from 1 to 4.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is linear in x, specifically \\(2010x - 4\\). That's a pretty large coefficient on x, which might complicate things, but let's see.\n\nSince all the denominators are of the form \\(x^2 - k\\), where k is an integer from 1 to 4, maybe I can rewrite the equation in a more manageable way. Perhaps by combining the fractions or making a substitution.\n\nLet me think about substitution. Let me let \\(y = x^2\\). Then, each term on the LHS becomes \\(\\frac{n}{y - n}\\), where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\\]\n\nBut wait, y is \\(x^2\\), so we have \\(y = x^2\\). Hmm, but the RHS still has an x term. That complicates things because y and x are related, but not in a linear way. This may not be the most straightforward substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can bring everything to one side and combine the fractions. Let's try that.\n\nSo, subtract the RHS from both sides:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x"

But with all these denominators, it's going to be tricky to combine them into a single equation. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, let's consider that for each term on the LHS, except for the denominator, it's a rational function. Perhaps I can rewrite the entire LHS over a common denominator. Let's see what that would look like.\n\nThe common denominator would be the product of all four denominators: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). If I rewrite each fraction with this common denominator, then perhaps I can combine them.\n\nBut that seems like it's going to result in a very high-degree polynomial. The LHS would become a single fraction with this large denominator, and the RHS would become another term over the same denominator, leading to an equation set to zero. Let me write that.\n\nSo, LHS as a single fraction:\n\n\\[\\frac{1 \\cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)}{(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\\]\n\nThat seems quite involved. Let me denote the numerator as N and the denominator as D. So, N/D - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\nTo eliminate the denominator D, I can multiply both sides by D:\n\nN - 2010x \\cdot D + 4D = 0.\n\nWhich gives:\n\nN + (-2010x + 4)D = 0.\n\nExpanding this, it's going to result in a massive polynomial equation of"

            "output": " degree... Let's see. The denominator D is degree 8 (since each (x^2 - k) is degree 2, so 2*4=8). The numerator N is also degree 6 (since each term in the numerator is multiplied by three (x^2 - ...) terms, each of degree 2, so 2*3=6, and then multiplied by constants 1,2,3,4). Wait, actually, each term in N is of degree 6, so when summed, N is degree 6. Then, the term -2010x * D is degree 9 (since D is degree 8, multiplied by x gives degree 9), and 4D is degree 8. So overall, the equation becomes a 9th-degree polynomial equation. That's going to be really hard to solve directly.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a smarter approach here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation has some symmetry or substitution that can be exploited. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the denominators, they are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). Each is of the form \\(x^2 - k^2\\) where k is 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 2? Wait, no, actually, they are just x squared minus integers. Maybe if I consider substituting \\(y = x^2\\), but then the RHS is 2010x -4, which still has an x term. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the equation is a function of x, and perhaps the sum of roots can be found without solving for each root individually. Since the problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions, maybe Vieta's formula can be applied here. But for that, I need to have a polynomial equation, and then the sum of roots is related to the coefficients.\n\nHowever, the equation is not a polynomial equation yet. To apply Vieta's formula, I need to convert it into a polynomial equation. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the original equation again:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{"

So, let's write each term with this common denominator:\n\nFirst term: \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} = \\frac{(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)}{D}\\), where D is the common denominator.\n\nSecond term: \\(\\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} = \\frac{2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)}{D}\\).\n\nThird term: \\(\\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} = \\frac{3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4)}{D}\\).\n\nFourth term: \\(\\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = \\frac{4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)}{D}\\).\n\nThen, the other terms on the RHS: -2010x + 4. To write these over the denominator D, we need to express them as fractions with denominator D:\n\n-2010x + 4 = \\(\\frac{(-2010x + 4)D}{D}\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire equation becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4(x^2 - 1)("
