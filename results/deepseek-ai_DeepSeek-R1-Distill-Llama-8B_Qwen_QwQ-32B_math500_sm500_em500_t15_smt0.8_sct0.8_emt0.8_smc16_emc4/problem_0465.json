            "output": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have three equations involving x, y, and z. The goal is to find the value of xy + yz + zx. Let me write down the equations again to have them clear:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, I need to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\). I remember that in symmetric equations, sometimes using symmetric sums can help. Let me recall the identity for \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\). I think it's \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\). Let me confirm that. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nLet me denote:\n- \\( S = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\) (this is what we need to find)\n- \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, we already know Q is 4. Now, using the second equation:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n\nAccording to the identity, this can be written as:\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q = 4 \\)\n\nSubstituting Q = 4:\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P + 12 = 4 \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\)\nLet me write this as equation (a):\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\) ... (a)\n\nOkay, so that's one equation relating S and P. Now, moving on to the third equation:\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, let me see if I can factor or combine terms here. I notice that each term is of the form \\( x y^2 \\), \\( x^2 y \\), etc. Maybe I can factor"

Alternatively, I can factor each pair:\n\nNote that \\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) = xy(x + y) \\)\nSimilarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(x + z) \\)\nAnd \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(y + z) \\)\n\nSo, the entire expression can be written as:\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\)\n\nHmm, another approach: Let me denote \\( x + y + z = S \\), so each pair like \\( x + y \\) can be expressed as \\( S - z \\), right? Because \\( x + y = S - z \\), similarly for others.\n\nSo, substituting these into the expression:\n\n\\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) \\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( xy(S - z) = xy S - x y z \\)\nSecond term: \\( xz(S - y) = xz S - x y z \\)\nThird term: \\( yz(S - x) = yz S - x y z \\)\n\nSo, adding them all together:\n= \\( xy S - x y z + xz S - x y z + yz S - x y z \\)\nCombine like terms:\n= \\( S(xy + xz + yz) - 3 x y z \\)\n\nBut \\( xy + xz + yz = P \\), so:\n= \\( S P - 3 Q \\)\n\nSince Q is 4, it becomes:\n= \\( S P - 12 \\)\n\nAnd according to the third equation, this is"

So S = 4, P = 6, Q = 4.\n\nLet me verify if the second equation holds:\n\nFrom \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\), using the identity:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q = 4^3 - 3*4*6 + 3*4 = 64 - 72 + 12 = (64 +12) -72 = 76 -72 = 4 \\). Yes, that works.\n\nAnd the third equation: \\( S P - 3 Q = 4*6 - 12 = 24 -12 =12 \\). Which matches.\n\nSo, everything checks out.
