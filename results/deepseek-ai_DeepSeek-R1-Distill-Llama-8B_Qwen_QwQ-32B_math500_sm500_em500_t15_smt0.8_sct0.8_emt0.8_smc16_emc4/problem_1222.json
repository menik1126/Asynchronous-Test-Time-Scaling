            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: If n is congruent to 2 modulo 7, I need to find the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with modular arithmetic, sometimes it's easier to substitute the given value directly into the expression rather than dealing with variables. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, that means n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. But maybe I don't need to express n like that yet.\n\nLooking at the expression (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6), I notice that each term is 2, 4, or 6 more than n. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, maybe I can figure out what each of these terms is congruent to modulo 7.\n\nLet me calculate each term one by one:\n\n1. n + 2: Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, adding 2 gives 2 + 2 = 4. So, n + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7.\n2. n + 4: Similarly, adding 4 to n gives 2 + 4 = 6. So, n + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7.\n3. n + 6: Adding 6 to n gives 2 + 6 = 8. But 8 mod 7 is 1, so n + 6 ≡ 1 mod 7.\n\nAlright, so now I have the three terms congruent to 4, 6, and 1 modulo 7, respectively. So the product (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) ≡ 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, multiply 4 and 6: 4 * 6 = 24. Now, 24 mod 7. Since 7*3=21, 24 - 21 = 3. So 4 * 6 ≡ 3 mod 7.\n\nThen, I need to multiply that result by 1: 3 * 1 = 3. So, 3 mod 7 is just 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together,"

            "output": " (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) ≡ 3 mod 7.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So n ≡ 2 mod 7:\n\n- n + 2: 2 + 2 = 4, correct.\n- n + 4: 2 + 4 = 6, correct.\n- n + 6: 2 + 6 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7, correct.\n\nThen multiply 4 * 6 = 24; 24 divided by 7 is 3 with remainder 3, so 24 ≡ 3 mod 7. Then 3 * 1 = 3, so yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the product in a different order to see if it changes anything. Let's see: 4 * 6 * 1. Another way is to compute 4 * 1 first: 4 * 1 = 4, then 4 * 6 = 24 ≡ 3 mod 7. Same result. So yes, it's consistent.\n\nAnother check: instead of substituting n, maybe I can express the entire product modulo 7.\n\nLet me consider (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) mod 7. Since n ≡ 2, substitute 2 in each term:\n\n(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = (4)(6)(8).\n\nCalculate 8 mod 7 is 1, so it's (4)(6)(1). As before, 4*6=24≡3, then 3*1=3. Same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this product as evaluating a polynomial at n = 2. The polynomial is (x + 2)(x + 4)(x + 6). If I expand this, maybe I can find a simpler expression. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, multiply (x + 2)(x + 4):\n\n(x + 2)(x + 4) = x^2 + 6x + 8.\n\nNow multiply that by (x + 6):\n\n(x^2 + 6x + 8)(x + 6) = x^3 + 6x^2 + 8x + "

Let me see:\n\n12 mod 7 is 5, since 7*1=7, 12-7=5.\n\n44 mod 7: 7*6=42, so 44-42=2.\n\n48 mod 7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6.

So again, 3 mod7. Same result.\n\nHmm, so that's another way to do it and still get 3. So that's good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without expanding. Let me think.\n\nSince n ≡2 mod7, so n =7k +2. Let me plug that into the expression:\n\n(n +2) =7k +2 +2=7k+4\n\n(n +4)=7k+2+4=7k+6\n\n(n +6)=7k+2+6=7k+8=7k+7+1=7(k+1)+1, so mod7 that's 1.\n\nSo the terms are 7k+4, 7k+6, and 1 mod"

Wait, 7k +4 mod7 is 4, 7k +6 mod7 is6, and 7k +8 is 1 as before.\n\nWait, but actually, in reality, the first term is (n + 2) which is 7k +4, the second is 7k +6, the third is 1 mod7.\n\nSo when I multiply them all, it's (7k +4)(7k +6)(1). Since 7k is 0 mod7, each term is 4,6,1. Therefore, their product mod7 is 4*6*1=24≡3 mod7. So yes, that's the answer.\n\nSo regardless of whether I substitute n or express everything modulo7, I get the same result.\n\nWait, but another thought: n +2, n +4, n +6 can be thought of as n +2, n +4, n +6, which is three consecutive even numbers, each spaced by 2. But I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that in mod7, each term can be expressed as 4,6,1, so 4*6=24≡3, 3*1=3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the product as n^3 + (2 +4 +6)n^2 + (2*4 +2*6 +4*6)n +2*4*6, but that seems more complicated.\n\nBut since I've already confirmed it in multiple ways, and each time I get 3, I'm confident that the remainder is 3 when (n + 2)(n +4)(n +6) is divided by7.\n</think>\n\nWhen \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), we can substitute \\( n = 2 \\) into each term of the expression \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) modulo 7:\n\n1. \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n2. \\( n + 4 \\equiv"
