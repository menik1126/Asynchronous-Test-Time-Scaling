The conditions given are a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. That means \\( P(x) \\) should have the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are real numbers. Since it's quadratic, the highest power of \\( x \\) is 2.\n\nNext, it mentions that for all real numbers \\( x \\), the polynomial satisfies the inequality \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq P(x) \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\). So, \\( P(x) \\) is sandwiched between two other quadratic polynomials. That's interesting because it tells me that \\( P(x) \\) must lie between these two functions everywhere on the real line.\n\nThe two quadratic polynomials bounding \\( P(x) \\) are:\n1. Lower bound: \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\)\n2. Upper bound: \\( 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\)\n\nI should probably analyze these two quadratics first. Maybe I can compare them or find where they intersect since \\( P(x) \\) has to be between them for all \\( x \\).\n\nLet me write down both functions:\n- Lower: \\( L(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\)\n- Upper: \\( U(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\)\n\nI can subtract \\( L(x) \\) from \\( U(x) \\) to see the difference between them:\n\n\\( U(x) - L(x) = (2x^2 - 4x + 3) - (x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\).\n\nOh, that simplifies to \\( (x - 1)^2 \\). That's a perfect square, so it's always non-negative. That makes sense because \\( U(x) \\) is always above \\( L(x) \\) since \\( P(x) \\) has to be sandwiched in between.\n\nSo, \\( U(x) - L(x) = (x - 1)^"

This tells me that the difference between the upper and lower functions is a perfect square, which is zero when \\( x = 1 \\) and positive otherwise.\n\nNow, since \\( P(x) \\) is squeezed between \\( L(x) \\) and \\( U(x) \\), it must be that \\( P(x) - L(x) \\) is a non-negative multiple of \\( (x - 1)^2 \\) for all \\( x \\). But wait, \\( P(x) \\) is quadratic, so maybe \\( P(x) - L(x) = k(x - 1)^2 \\) where \\( k \\) is some constant. Similarly, \\( U(x) - P(x) = (1 - k)(x - 1)^2 \\) because \\( U(x) - L(x) = (x - 1)^2 \\).\n\nAlternatively, considering that both \\( P(x) - L(x) \\) and \\( U(x) - P(x) \\) must be non-negative for all \\( x \\), \\( P(x) \\) must be equal to \\( L(x) + k(x - 1)^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant between 0 and 1. Because if \\( k \\) were greater than 1, \\( P(x) \\) would exceed \\( U(x) \\) for some \\( x \\), and if \\( k \\) were less than 0, \\( P(x) \\) would dip below \\( L(x) \\) for some \\( x \\).\n\nSo, let me write that as:\n\n\\( P(x) = L(x) + k(x - 1)^2 = (x^2 - 2x + 2) + k(x^2 - 2x + 1) \\).\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n\\( P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 + kx^2 - 2kx + k \\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( P(x) = (1 + k)x^2 + (-2 - 2k)x + (2 + k) \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(x) \\) has coefficients:\n\n- \\( a = 1 + k \\)\n- \\( b = -2 - 2k \\)\n- \\( c = 2 + k \\)\n\nNow, I also know that \\("

So the approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to consider the equality cases. Since \\( P(11) = 181 \\), and we know that at \\( x = 11 \\), \\( P(11) \\) is equal to the upper bound or somewhere in between. But in our earlier approach, we derived \\( k \\) based on the value at \\( x = 11 \\). Is there any reason why 11 is a specific point? I think it's just a point where we have the value given, so we can solve for \\( k \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set \\( P(x) - L(x) = k(x - 1)^2 \\) and \\( U(x) - P(x) = m(x - 1)^2 \\), with \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) being constants. Then, \\( k + m = 1 \\) because \\( U(x) - L(x) = (x - 1)^2 \\). So, if \\( P(x) - L(x) = k(x - 1)^2 \\) and \\( U(x) - P(x) = m(x - 1)^2 \\), then \\( k = P(x)/ (x - 1)^2 - 1/(x - 1)^2 \\). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nWait, actually, since \\( P(x) \\) is between \\( L(x) \\) and \\( U(x) \\) for all x, the difference \\( P(x) - L(x) \\) must be a non-negative multiple of \\( (x - 1)^2 \\). Since \\( (x - 1)^2 \\) is zero at \\( x = 1 \\), perhaps the only way that \\( P(x) \\) - L(x) is a multiple of this square is that \\( P(x) - L(x) = k(x - 1)^2 \\), with \\( k \\) being a constant.\n\nSimilarly, \\( U(x) - P(x) = (1 - k)(x - 1)^2 \\). So that reasoning seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, our approach is sound.\n\nSo, given all that,"
