I need to find the number of different possible rational roots this polynomial can have. Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember there's something called the Rational Root Theorem. I think it's used to find possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Let me try to recall how it works. If I have a polynomial equation, the possible rational roots are fractions where the numerator is a factor of the constant term, and the denominator is a factor of the leading coefficient. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, in my equation, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. That means the possible rational roots are fractions where the numerator is a factor of 1 and the denominator is a factor of 2. Factors of 1 are just \u00b11, and factors of 2 are \u00b11, \u00b12. So, the possible rational roots would be \u00b11, \u00b11/2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The polynomial is 2x\u2074 + ... + 1, so the constant term is indeed 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, using the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient. That would be 1 divided by 1, 1 divided by 2, -1 divided by 1, and -1 divided by 2. So, the possible roots are 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nNow, the question is about the number of different possible rational roots. So, I need to count how many unique values are in that list. Let's see: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That's four distinct possible rational roots.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't overcomplicate it. The factors of 1 are just 1 and -1, and the factors of 2 are 1, 2, -1, -2. So when we form the possible roots, we take each factor of the constant term and divide it by each factor of the leading coefficient. So, "

Similarly, -1 divided by 1 is -1, -1 divided by 2 is -1/2, etc. But since we already have those, the unique ones are indeed four.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"different possible rational roots of this polynomial\". But does every one of these actually have to be possible? Like, could there be cases where some of these can't be roots because of the coefficients a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081?\n\nHmm, the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots, so it's the total number of possible candidates given the constraints of the coefficients being integers. Since the coefficients can be any integers, the possible rational roots are exactly those given by the Rational Root Theorem. The coefficients a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081 can be chosen such that any of these roots could be a root. For example, if I want 1 to be a root, I can set up the equation by plugging in x=1 and solve for the coefficients. Similarly for the others. Since the coefficients are integers, but otherwise unrestricted, all four possibilities are indeed possible. Therefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the polynomial has a rational root p/q in simplest form (so p and q are coprime). Then according to the Rational Root Theorem, p divides 1 and q divides 2. Since p divides 1, p must be \u00b11, and q must be a divisor of 2, so q is \u00b11 or \u00b12. But since the fraction is in simplest form, the denominator can't have any common factors with the numerator. Since the numerator is \u00b11, which is coprime with any denominator, so the possible denominators are indeed 1 and 2. So the possible roots are \u00b11 and \u00b11/2. So that's four different possibilities. Therefore, the answer should be 4. \n\nI don't see any other possibilities here. The leading coefficient is 2, so denominators can't be anything else. The constant term is 1, so numerators can't be anything else. Therefore, the possible rational roots are exactly those four. So the"
