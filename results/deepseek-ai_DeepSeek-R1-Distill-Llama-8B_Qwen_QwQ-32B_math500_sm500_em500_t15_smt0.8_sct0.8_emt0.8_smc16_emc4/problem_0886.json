            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, I need to determine its decimal equivalent. \n\nFirst, I'll check if the denominator has factors other than 2 and 5. The denominator is 160, which can be factored into \\(2^5 \\times 5\\). Since all prime factors of the denominator are 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n\nNext, I'll simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 in this case. This means the fraction remains as \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\).\n\nFinally, I'll perform the division of 57 by 160. Dividing 57 by 160 gives a decimal that will terminate because the denominator only has 2s and 5s after simplification.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is 160.\n   - Factor 160 into its prime components: \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5\\).\n   - A fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator, after simplifying, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n2. **Check for Simplification:**\n   - The numerator is 57 and the denominator is 160.\n   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 57 and 160 is 1.\n   - Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Perform the Division:**\n   - To convert \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a decimal, divide 57 by 160.\n   - \\(57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\\)\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The decimal representation of \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) is 0.35625, which is a terminating decimal.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
