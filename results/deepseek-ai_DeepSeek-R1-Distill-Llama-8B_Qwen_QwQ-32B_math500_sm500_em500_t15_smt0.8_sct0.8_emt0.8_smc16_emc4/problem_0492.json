            "output": "First, I need to determine the original cube from which the steel sphere is made. The sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is 6 inches. Since the sphere is formed by removing metal from the cube, the sphere must fit perfectly inside the cube.\n\nAssuming the cube has equal side lengths, I can set the side length of the cube equal to the diameter of the sphere. Therefore, the side length of the cube is 6 inches.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the original cube using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is side length cubed. Plugging in the value, the volume is:\n\n6 inches \u00d7 6 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 216 cubic inches.\n\nThis means the cube originally had a volume of 216 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere is made, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube:**\n   - The sphere is formed by removing metal from the corners of a cube.\n   - The sphere's diameter must fit within the cube's side length.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sphere's Diameter:**\n   - **Given:** Radius of the sphere \\( r = 3 \\) inches.\n   - **Diameter \\( d = 2 \\times r = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) inches.**\n\n3. **Determine the Cube's Side Length:**\n   - To ensure the sphere fits perfectly inside the cube, the cube's side length must be equal to the sphere's diameter.\n   - **Side length of the cube \\( s = d = 6 \\) inches.**\n\n4. **Calculate the Cube's Volume:**\n   - **Volume \\( V \\) of a cube is given by \\( V = s^3 \\).**\n   - **Volume \\( V = 6^3 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\) cubic inches.**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{216}\n\\]"
