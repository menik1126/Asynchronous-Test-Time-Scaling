Let me start by trying to simplify both sides of the equation or see if I can spot a pattern or something.\n\nFirst, I notice that on the right-hand side, we have (2x - 10)^3. I should check if that's related to the left-hand side in some way. Let's factor out the 2: 2x - 10 is 2*(x - 5). So, (2x -10)^3 is equal to [2*(x - 5)]^3, which is 2^3*(x -5)^3, so that's 8*(x -5)^3. Hmm, okay, so the right side is 8 times (x -5)^3.\n\nNow, looking at the left side, we have (x -3)^3 + (x -7)^3. I wonder if those two terms can be combined or simplified somehow. Maybe I can try expanding both cubes and see if anything cancels out or combines nicely.\n\nLet me recall that (a + b)^3 is a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3. So, let me expand (x -3)^3 and (x -7)^3 separately.\n\nStarting with (x -3)^3:\n= x^3 - 3x^2*3 + 3x*(3)^2 - (3)^3\nWait, actually, I think the expansion is:\n(x + a)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2*a + 3x*a^2 + a^3\nSo, (x -3)^3 would be:\nx^3 - 3*x^2*1 + 3*x*(1)^2*(-3) + (-3)^3\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The expansion is:\n\n(x - a)^3 = x^3 - 3a x^2 + 3a^2 x - a^3\n\nSo, for (x -3)^3, that would be:\nx^3 - 3*(3)x^2 + 3"

Let's see:\n\nThe coefficients are -6, 90, -426, 630.\n\nLooking for a common factor. Let's see, 6 is a common factor for all.\n\nLet's factor out -6:\n\n-6x^3 +90x^2 -426x +630 = 0\n\nDivide each term by -6:\n\nx^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 = 0\n\nSo, the equation becomes x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 = 0\n\nNow, I need to find the roots of this cubic equation. Let's try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\nThe possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (105) over the leading coefficient (1), so possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b15, \u00b17, \u00b115, \u00b121, \u00b135, \u00b1105.\n\nLet me test x=3:\n\n3^3 -15*(3)^2 +71*3 -105 = 27 - 135 + 213 -105.\n\nCompute:\n\n27 -135 = -108\n\n-108 +213 = 105\n\n105 -105 = 0\n\nSo, x=3 is a root. Great, that's one root.\n\nSo, we can factor (x - 3) from the cubic.\n\nLet's perform polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nUsing synthetic division for x=3:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -15 | 71 | -105\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1*3 =3, add to -15: -12\n\nMultiply -12*3= -36, add to 71: 35\n\nMultiply 35*3=105, add to -105: 0.
