            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of two vertical asymptotes and a horizontal asymptote for the function f(x) = 2x / (x\u00b2 - 5x - 14). Then, I have to add those three together. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, my first task is to factor the denominator to find where it equals zero. The denominator is x\u00b2 - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring that.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5... Hmm, okay, factors of 14 are 1 and 14, 2 and 7. Let's see, if I take 2 and -7, their product is -14, and their sum is 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect! So that factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). So, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7, right? So, a and b are -2 and 7. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in factoring. Let me expand (x + 2)(x - 7) to check: x*x is x\u00b2, x*(-7) is -7x, 2*x is 2x, and 2*(-7) is -14. Combine like terms: -7x + 2x is -5x. So, (x + 2)(x - 7) = x\u00b2 - 5x -14. Yep, that matches the original denominator. Good, no mistakes there.\n\nSo, vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x =7. So, a is -2 and b is7, so a + b is (-2) +7=5. Got that part.\n\nNext, horizontal asymptote. I recall that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator.\n\nIn this function, the numerator is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x\u00b2 -5x -14, which is degree 2. So, the degrees are"

            "output": " 1 and 2. I think the rule is that if the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. If the degrees are equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nHere, since the numerator is degree 1 and the denominator is degree 2, which is higher, so the horizontal asymptote should be y=0. Therefore, c is 0.\n\nSo, now I have a = -2, b=7, c=0. Then, a + b + c is (-2) +7 +0=5.\n\nWait, let me just double-check all the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a mistake.\n\n1. Factored denominator: Correct, (x + 2)(x -7).\n2. Vertical asymptotes at roots of denominator: Correct, since numerator is 2x, which is not zero at x=-2 or 7, so yes, asymptotes there.\n3. Horizontal asymptote calculation: Degree denominator is higher, so y=0. That seems right.\n\nSo, adding them up: (-2) +7 +0=5. Yep, that seems to be the answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can plug in values near the asymptotes to see if the function approaches infinity, but that's more for understanding. For the question, I think the algebraic approach suffices.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\(f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\\) has vertical asymptotes at \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x = 7\\), and a horizontal asymptote at \\(y = 0\\). Adding these values together: \\(-2 + 7 + 0 = 5\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
