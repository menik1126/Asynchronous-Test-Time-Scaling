Then, I need to compute the sum of each of these factors evaluated at 1. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I notice that the polynomial is a quartic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me set \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\). Wait, but solving this for y might not directly help me factor the original polynomial because each solution for y would give me a quadratic in x. Maybe I should try to factor the original polynomial into quadratics or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a biquadratic equation that can be factored into quadratics. Let me think about how to factor \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Sometimes, expressions like \\( x^4 + ax^2 + 1 \\) can be factored into quadratics, especially if they can be expressed as a product of two quadratics. Let me try that.\n\nAssume that \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) factors into two quartic polynomials: \\( (x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)(x^4 + ex^3 + fx^2 + gx + h) \\). But that seems complicated because it would involve a lot of coefficients. Maybe a better approach is to factor it into four quadratic polynomials. Wait, actually, given the symmetry, perhaps it's a product of two quartic polynomials each of the form \\( (x^4 + px^2 + 1) \\) or something similar.\n\nWait, let's try factoring it as a product of two quadratics in \\( x^4 \\).
