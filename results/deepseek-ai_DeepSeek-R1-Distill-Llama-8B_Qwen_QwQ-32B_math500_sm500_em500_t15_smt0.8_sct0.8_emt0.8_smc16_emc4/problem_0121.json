            "output": "First, I need to convert the binary number 10101001110 to base eight. I know that each digit in the resulting octal number corresponds to three binary digits.\n\nI'll start by breaking the binary number into groups of three bits, starting from the right. This means I'll have the following groups: 101, 010, 011, 10.\n\nSince there are four groups and we're converting to base eight, I'll pad the leftmost group with a leading zero to make it a complete set of three bits: 010, 101, 010, 011, 10.\n\nNext, I'll convert each three-bit group to its corresponding octal digit. The binary numbers 010, 101, 010, and 011 translate to the octal digits 2, 5, 2, and 3 respectively.\n\nFinally, I'll combine these octal digits to form the final base eight number, which is 2523.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\( 10101001110_2 \\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Break the binary number into groups of three bits starting from the right:**\n   \n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n   \n2. **Since there are four groups, and we're converting to base eight, add a leading zero to the first group to make it a complete set of three bits:**\n   \n   ```\n   010 101 010 011 10\n   ```\n   \n3. **Convert each three-bit group to its corresponding octal digit:**\n   \n   - \\( 010_2 = 2_8 \\)\n   - \\( 101_2 = 5_8 \\)\n   - \\( 010_2 = 2_8 \\)\n   - \\( 011_2 = 3_8 \\)\n   - \\( 10_2 = 0_8 \\) (since there are only two bits left, pad with a leading zero)\n   \n4. **Combine the octal digits to form the final base eight number:**\n   \n   ```\n   25 23 0_8 \u2192 2523_8\n   ```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2523_8}\n\\]"
