            "output": "I need to find the sixth term of an arithmetic sequence where the fourth term is 200 and the eighth term is 500.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.\n\nNext, I'll set up equations using the given information. For the fourth term: 200 = a_1 + 3d. And for the eighth term: 500 = a_1 + 7d.\n\nI'll subtract the fourth term equation from the eighth term equation to eliminate a_1: 500 - 200 = (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d), which simplifies to 300 = 4d. Solving for d gives d = 75.\n\nNow that I have the common difference, I'll substitute d back into the fourth term equation to find a_1: 200 = a_1 + 3*75, so 200 = a_1 + 225. This means a_1 = -25.\n\nFinally, I'll use the formula to find the sixth term: a_6 = a_1 + 5d. Plugging in the values: a_6 = -25 + 5*75 = -25 + 375 = 350.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The fourth term (\\(a_4\\)) of an arithmetic sequence is 200.\n- The eighth term (\\(a_8\\)) is 500.\n\n**Find:**\nThe sixth term (\\(a_6\\)).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Recall the Formula for the \\(n\\)-th Term of an Arithmetic Sequence\nThe \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(a_n\\) is the \\(n\\)-th term,\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n- \\(d\\) is the common difference between consecutive terms.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Equations Using the Given Information\nUsing the given terms:\n1.
