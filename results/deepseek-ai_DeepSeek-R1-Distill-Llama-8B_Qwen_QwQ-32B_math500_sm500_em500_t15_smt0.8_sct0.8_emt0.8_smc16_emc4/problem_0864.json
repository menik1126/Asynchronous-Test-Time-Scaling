Rationalizing 1/\u221a2 gives me \u221a2/2, and rationalizing 1/\u221a3 results in \u221a3/3. This simplifies the original expression to \u221a2 + \u221a2/2 + \u221a3 + \u221a3/3.\n\nAfter combining like terms, the expression becomes (3\u221a2/2) + (4\u221a3/3). To combine these into a single fraction, I'll find a common denominator, which is 6. Multiplying each term by the necessary factor to achieve this gives me (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nFinally, I'll verify that the denominator, 6, is the smallest possible by ensuring that the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1. This confirms that the expression is in its simplest form, and I can now calculate the sum of a, b, and c, which are 9, 8, and 6, respectively.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Original Expression**:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rationalize the Denominators**:\n   - For \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n     \\]\n   - For \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n     \\]\n   \n   Substituting these back into the original expression:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**:\n   - Combine the terms with \\(\\sqrt{2}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2} + \\"
