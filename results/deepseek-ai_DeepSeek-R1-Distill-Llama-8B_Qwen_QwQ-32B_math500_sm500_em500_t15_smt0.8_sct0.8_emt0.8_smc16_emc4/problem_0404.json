This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation rates.\n\nThe first gear turns 33 and 1/3 times per minute, which is equivalent to 100/3 rotations per minute. The second gear turns 45 times per minute, which is 45/1 rotations per minute.\n\nTo find the LCM of 100/3 and 45, I'll convert them to their simplest fractional forms. The prime factors of 100 are 2^2 * 5^2, and for 3, it's just 3^1. The prime factors of 45 are 3^2 * 5^1.\n\nCombining these, the LCM in fractional form is (100/3) * (45/3) = (100*45)/(3*3) = 4500/9 = 500 rotations.\n\nNow, since one rotation takes 60 seconds, the total time for both gears to align is 500 rotations * 60 seconds/rotation = 30,000 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the two marks will next point due north after 30,000 seconds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine when the two gears will both have their marks pointing due north again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Rotation Rates**\n- **First Gear:** Turns \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) times per minute.\n- **Second Gear:** Turns \\( 45 \\) times per minute.\n\n**Step 2: Convert to Rotations per Minute**\n- \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) can be written as \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\) rotations per minute.\n- The second gear turns \\( 45 \\) rotations per minute.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**\n\\[\n\\text{LCM of } \\frac{100}{3} \\text{ and } 45 = \\frac{100}{3} \\times 45 = \\frac{4500}{3} = 1500\n\\]\nThis means both gears will align after \\( 1500 \\) rotations.\n\n**Step 4: Convert Rotations to Seconds**\nEach rotation takes 60 seconds.

Let me correct this.\n\n**Revised Step 3: LCM of Periods**\n- **First Gear's period:** \\( \\frac{60 \\text{ seconds}}{\\frac{100}{3} \\text{ rotations}} = \\frac{60 \\times 3}{100} = 1.8 \\text{ seconds per rotation} \\).\n- **Second Gear's period:** \\( \\frac{60 \\text{ seconds}}{45 \\text{ rotations}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ seconds per rotation} \\).\n\n**LCM of periods (in seconds):**\n- Convert periods to fractions:\n  - First gear: \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) seconds per rotation.\n  - Second gear: \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds per rotation.\n- LCM of \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\):\n  - LCM of numerators (9 and 4) = 36.\n  - GCD of denominators (5 and 3) = 1.\n  - LCM = \\( \\frac{36}{1} = 36 \\) seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{36}\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me re-express properly.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n- **First Gear's rotations per second:** \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\div 60 = \\frac{100}{180} = \\frac{5}{9} \\) rotations per second.\n- **Second Gear's rotations per second:** \\( 45 \\div 60 = \\frac{3}{4} \\) rotations per second.\n\nTo find when both marks align, find LCM of their periods (time to complete one full rotation).\n\n**Period of First Gear:** \\( \\frac{60}{100/3} = 1.8 \\) seconds per rotation.\n**Period of Second Gear:** \\( \\frac{60}{45} = 1.333... \\) seconds per rotation.\n\nConvert periods to fractions:\n- First gear: \\( \\frac{9}{"
