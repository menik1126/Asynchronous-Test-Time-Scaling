Since the order of selection doesn't matter, we'll calculate the combinations separately for boys and girls and then multiply them.\n\n1. **Number of ways to pick 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3! \\cdot 4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of ways to pick 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total number of ways:**\n   \n   \\[\n   35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
