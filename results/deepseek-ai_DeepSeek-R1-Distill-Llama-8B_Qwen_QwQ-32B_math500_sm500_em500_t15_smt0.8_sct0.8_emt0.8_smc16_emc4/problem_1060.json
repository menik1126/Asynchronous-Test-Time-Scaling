            "output": "To determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, I'll start by calculating the perimeter of the regular hexagon since the problem states they have the same perimeter.\n\nA regular hexagon has six equal sides, each measuring 16 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, its total perimeter is also 96 cm. A regular octagon has eight equal sides, so I'll divide the perimeter by 8 to find the length of one side.\n\n96 cm divided by 8 equals 12 cm. Therefore, each side of the regular octagon is 12 cm long.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Regular Hexagon**\n   - A regular hexagon has **6** equal sides.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   - **Perimeter of Hexagon** = Number of sides × Length of one side\n   - **Perimeter of Hexagon** = 6 × 16 cm = **96 cm**\n\n2. **Determine the Perimeter of the Regular Octagon**\n   - A regular octagon has **8** equal sides.\n   - Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, the perimeter of the octagon is also **96 cm**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of One Side of the Octagon**\n   - **Perimeter of Octagon** = Number of sides × Length of one side\n   - Let \\( s \\) be the length of one side of the octagon.\n   - \\( 8 × s = 96 \\) cm\n   - \\( s = \\frac{96}{8} \\) cm = **12 cm**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{12\\ \\text{cm}}"
