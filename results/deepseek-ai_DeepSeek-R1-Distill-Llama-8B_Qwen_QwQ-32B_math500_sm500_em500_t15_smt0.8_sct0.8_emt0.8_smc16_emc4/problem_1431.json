Hmm, let me think about what this means.\n\nFirst, I remember that a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power means that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as some integer \\( k \\) raised to the power of \\( n \\). So, mathematically, that would be \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nNow, since both sides of the equation are powers of 2, maybe I can express \\( k \\) as a power of 2 as well. Let me denote \\( k = 2^m \\), where \\( m \\) is some positive integer. Substituting back into the equation, I get:\n\n\\( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \\).\n\nUsing exponent rules, that becomes \\( 2^{24} = 2^{m \\cdot n} \\). Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. So, \\( 24 = m \\cdot n \\). That means \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers such that their product is 24.\n\nNow, I need to find all possible pairs \\( (m, n) \\) where both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers greater than 1. Wait, no, actually, the question specifies \\( n > 1 \\), but \\( m \\) can be 1? Let me check.\n\nWait, \\( k \\) is an integer, and since \\( k = 2^m \\), \\( m \\) has to be a non-negative integer. But since \\( k \\) must be greater than 1 (because if \\( m = 0 \\), \\( k = 1 \\), but \\( 1^n = 1 \\) for any \\( n \\), which isn't useful here), so \\( m \\) should be at least 1.\n\nBut actually, \\( 1 \\) is allowed as \\( k \\) because the problem doesn't specify \\( k > 1 \\). Wait, no, if \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( 1^n = 1 \\) for any \\( n \\), which"

So, \\( k \\) must be at least \\( 2 \\), meaning \\( m \\) is at least 1 because \\( 2^1 = 2 \\).\n\nSo, back to \\( 24 = m \\cdot n \\). I need to find the number of positive integer divisors \\( n \\) of 24 where \\( n > 1 \\). Each divisor \\( n \\) corresponds to an \\( m \\) such that \\( m = 24 / n \\). So, the number of valid \\( n \\) is equal to the number of divisors of 24 greater than 1.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 24. The prime factors of 24 are \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\). The number of positive divisors is given by multiplying one more than each exponent in the prime factorization. So, \\( (3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\). So, 24 has 8 positive divisors.\n\nNow, list all the positive divisors of 24 to make sure:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n\nSince we need \\( n > 1 \\), we exclude 1. So, the valid divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. That's 7 divisors.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each divisor \\( n \\) would correspond to \\( m = 24/n \\). So, each of these 7 \\( n \\) values will give a valid \\( m \\) as an integer. So, the number of such \\( n \\) is 7.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nGiven \\( 24 = m \\cdot n \\), and \\( m \\) must be a positive integer as well. So for each divisor \\( n \\) of 24 greater than 1, \\( m \\) will also be a positive integer. So, for example:\n\n- If \\( n = 2 \\), then \\( m = 12 \\).\n- If \\( n = 3 \\), then \\( m = 8 \\).\n- If \\( n = 4 \\), then \\( m = 6 \\"

But wait, \\( n > 1 \\) as per the problem, so \\( n \\) can't be 1, which is already excluded from the list.\n\nSo, the total number of such \\( n \\) is 7. Therefore, the answer should be 7.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Since \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect square, perfect cube, etc., each of these \\( n \\) values would correspond to a perfect power. For example:\n\n- \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 2^{12} \\) squared is \\( 2^{24} \\).\n- \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 2^8 \\) cubed is \\( 2^{24} \\).\n- \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 2^6 \\) to the 4th power is \\( (2^6)^4 = 2^{24} \\).\n- Similarly for each \\( n \\).\n\nSo, each \\( n \\) in 2,3,4,6,8,12,24 works, making 7 values.\n\nWait a second, but I just thought of \\( n \\) as the exponent, but could there be other exponents beyond those that divide 24? For example, could \\( n \\) be a non-divisor, but \\( 2^{24} \\) is still a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power?\n\nWait, no. Because \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\) implies that \\( k = 2^{24/n} \\). So, for \\( k \\) to be an integer, \\( 24/n \\) must be an integer. Therefore, \\( n \\) must divide 24. So, yes, only"

But let me check once more.\n\nWait, the divisors of 24 are 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24. So excluding 1, that's 7 numbers. So, yes, 7.\n\nHmm, but let me think of another angle. Suppose someone might argue that \\( n \\) can be a composite exponent, but in this case, since the exponent in the original number is 24, which is 2^3*3^1, the exponents n must divide 24. So, yeah, the logic holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering n as a composite number? But no, the question is just asking for any n>1, so all divisors except 1 are acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 7.

Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\\[\n2^{24} = (2^m)^n\n\\]\nUsing exponent rules, this simplifies to:\n\\[\n2^{24} = 2^{m \\cdot n}\n\\]\nEquating the exponents, we get:\n\\[\n24 = m \\cdot n\n\\]\nHere, \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) must be positive integers. We need to find all divisors \\( n \\) of 24 such that \\( n > 1 \\). \n\nThe prime factorization of 24 is \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\). The total number of divisors is calculated as:\n\\[\n(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4"
