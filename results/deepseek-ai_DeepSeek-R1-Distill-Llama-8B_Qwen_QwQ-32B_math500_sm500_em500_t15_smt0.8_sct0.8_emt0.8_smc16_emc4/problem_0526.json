            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to simplify the expression (1 + √2)/(2 + √3). The goal is to express it in the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D), where A, B, C, and D are positive integers. Then, I have to find the sum A + B + C + D.\n\nHmm, rationalizing the denominator might be a good start since the denominator has a square root. I remember that to rationalize, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of (2 + √3) is (2 - √3). So, I can try that.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n(1 + √2)/(2 + √3) * (2 - √3)/(2 - √3)\n\nSince I'm multiplying both numerator and denominator by the same thing, the value of the expression shouldn't change. Now, I need to carry out the multiplication in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nStarting with the numerator: (1 + √2)(2 - √3). I'll use the distributive property (FOIL) to expand this.\n\nFirst, multiply 1 by 2, which is 2.\n\nThen, 1 multiplied by (-√3) is -√3.\n\nNext, √2 multiplied by 2 is 2√2.\n\nLastly, √2 multiplied by (-√3) is -√6.\n\nSo, combining all these terms: 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\nLet me write that down: (2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6).\n\nNow, moving on to the denominator: (2 + √3)(2 - √3). This is a difference of squares, so it should simplify to 2² - (√3)². That is 4 - 3, which equals 1. Cool, so the denominator becomes 1.\n\nSo, after rationalizing, the expression becomes:\n\n(2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6)/1, which simplifies to 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\nHmm, I need to write this in the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D). Let me see how I can rearrange the terms.\n\nLooking at the terms, I have 2, which is just"

Then, I have terms with √2 and √6, and then -√3.\n\nLet me group them as follows:\n\n2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nHmm, to fit into the desired form, I think I need to have 2 times (1 + √B). Let me see if I can factor out a 2 from some of these terms.\n\nLooking at 2 + 2√2, that can be written as 2(1 + √2). So, let me write that:\n\n2(1 + √2) - √3 - √6.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the desired form is A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D). So, I have 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). \n\nComparing that to the desired form, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, and D is 6. So, then A + B + C + D would be 2 + 2 + 3 + 6.\n\nAdding those together: 2 + 2 is 4, 4 + 3 is 7, and 7 + 6 is 13.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my steps. It's easy to mix up signs when dealing with multiple square roots.\n\nStarting again, after rationalizing, I had 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6. I grouped the constants and the terms with √2 together, so 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nFactoring out a 2 from the first two terms gives 2(1 + √2). Then, the remaining terms are -√3 - √6, which is equivalent to -(√3 + √6). So, that does fit the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D) with A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6.\n\nSo, adding them: 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm my rationalization step.\n\nMultiplying (1 + √2)(2 - √3):\n\n1*2 = 2\n\n1*(-√3) = -√3\n\n√2*2 = 2√2\n\n"

Correct.\n\nSo the simplified expression is correct. Then, grouping terms as 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6) is also correct. Therefore, the values of A, B, C, D are indeed 2, 2, 3, 6. Their sum is 13.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me check if there's another way to group terms that might lead to different A, B, C, D. For example, maybe the problem expects a different arrangement?\n\nSuppose I tried to factor differently. Let me see:\n\nThe expression after rationalization is 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe group terms as (2 - √3) + (2√2 - √6). But that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps factor something else?\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor out a √3 or √2 from some terms?\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\n2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\n√6 is √2*√3, so maybe that can be expressed as √2*√3. Hmm, but I don't see an obvious way to factor that into the desired form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different A?\n\nWait, the form is A(1 + √B) minus the sum of two square roots. So, the first term must be a multiple of (1 + sqrt something). The only term that can be expressed as such is the 2(1 + √2). So that's probably the right way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is different? Let me see.\n\nSuppose I tried to write it as 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). That's exactly what I have. So that's the form. So A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6. So the sum is 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the terms in a different order"

So yes, that matches.\n\nSo I think my earlier conclusion is correct. So A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6. Sum is 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't mix up C and D, because sometimes that can happen. The terms are -√3 and -√6, so C is 3 and D is 6, right?\n\nYes, because √3 is sqrt(3), so C is 3, and √6 is sqrt(6), so D is 6. So that's correct.\n\nOkay, I think that's solid.
