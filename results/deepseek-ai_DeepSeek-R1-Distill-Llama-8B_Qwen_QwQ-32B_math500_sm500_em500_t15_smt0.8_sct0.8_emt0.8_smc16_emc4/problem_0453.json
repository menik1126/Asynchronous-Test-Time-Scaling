Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. The condition is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), and I need to minimize \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Both \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are positive, which is good because it means I don't have to worry about negative numbers messing things up.\n\nI remember that in optimization problems, especially with multiple variables, techniques like the AM-GM inequality can be really helpful. AM-GM often gives us the minimum or maximum values for expressions involving sums and products, which seems relevant here. So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the expression we need to minimize, \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), let me try expanding it to see if it becomes more manageable. If I multiply it out, I get:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. But maybe I can find a way to relate this to the given condition \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). Let's see, that condition can also be expanded:\n\n\\[\nxyz(x + y + z) = x^2yz + xy^2z + xyz^2\n\\]\n\nSo both expressions involve products of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) in different combinations. I wonder if there's a substitution or substitution that can relate these terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set some variables equal to each other to exploit symmetry. Since the problem is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) (because the expression to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\)), perhaps it would help if I assume that \\(x = z\\). Let me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s set \\(x = z = a\\), where \\(a\\) is a positive real number. Then, the condition becomes:\n\n\\[\na \\cdot y \\cdot a \\cdot (a + y + a) = 1\n\\"

Hmm, that might be simpler. Let me see if I can work with this substitution.\n\nLet me denote \\(t = a + y\\), so the expression to minimize is \\(t^2\\). But I need to express the constraint in terms of \\(t\\) and \\(a\\). Let's see:\n\nFirst, from \\(t = a + y\\), we can write \\(y = t - a\\). Substitute this into the constraint equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 (t - a) (2a + t - a) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 (t - a)(a + t) = 1\n\\]\n\nNotice that \\((t - a)(t + a) = t^2 - a^2\\), so:\n\n\\[\na^2 (t^2 - a^2) = 1\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 t^2 - a^4 = 1\n\\]\n\nHmm, so we have \\(a^2 t^2 - a^4 = 1\\). But we want to minimize \\(t^2\\), so maybe express \\(t^2\\) in terms of \\(a^2\\):\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 t^2 = a^4 + 1\n\\]\n\\[\nt^2 = a^2 + \\frac{1}{a^2}\n\\]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So \\(t^2 = a^2 + \\frac{1}{a^2}\\). Therefore, the expression we need to minimize, which is \\(t^2\\), is equal to \\(a^2 + \\frac{1}{a^2}\\). But then, to minimize \\(t^2\\), we need to minimize \\(a^2 + \\frac{1}{a^2}\\).\n\nAh! Now, this is a standard problem. The expression \\(a^2 + \\frac{1}{a^2"

Therefore, the minimal value of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) is 2.\n\nWait a minute, hold on. Let me double-check this.

Therefore, you can't have \\(y\\) smaller than \\(\\sqrt{2} -1\\) if \\(x = z = 1\\).\n\nWait, unless you also scale \\(x\\) or \\(z\\). Maybe if I don't set \\(x = z\\), but instead choose different values for \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), can I get a lower value?\n\nSuppose I set \\(y\\) very large, then \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) can be small. But wait, increasing \\(y\\) would also affect the constraint.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to explore without the substitution. Suppose I let \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\) all vary, but use the constraint to express one variable in terms of the others.\n\nFrom the constraint:\n\n\\(xyz(x + y + z) =1\\)\n\nLet me solve for \\(z\\):\n\n\\(z = \\frac{1}{xy(x + y + z)}\\)\n\nHmm, this seems recursive because \\(z\\) is on both sides. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps fix \\(y\\) and express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(z\\) or something.\n\nBut maybe it's getting too convoluted. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality on the expression \\((x + y)(y + z)\\).\n\nLet me note that:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + x z\n\\]\n\nHmm, because:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + x z\n\\]\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me multiply it out:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = x y + x z + y^2 + y z\n\\]\n\nCompare to \\( y(x + y + z) + x z \\):\n\n\\[\ny(x + y + z"

So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + x z\n\\]\n\nNow, let me denote \\(S = x + y + z\\). Then, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y S + x z\n\\]\n\nSo, we have to minimize \\(y S + x z\\) given that \\(x y z S = 1\\).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can apply AM-GM here. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider the terms \\(y S\\) and \\(x z\\). Maybe split them into more terms to apply AM-GM.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables such that I can apply AM-GM to the terms involved in the constraint and the expression.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables \\(a = x\\), \\(b = y\\), \\(c = z\\), so the problem is symmetric in a way. Wait, but the expression to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), which is not symmetric in all variables, but symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\).\n\nAlternatively, let me set \\(a = x\\), \\(b = y\\), \\(c = z\\), so the expression is \\((a + b)(b + c)\\), and the constraint is \\(a b c (a + b + c) =1\\).\n\nHmm, perhaps I can use substitution variables. Let me set \\(u = x + y + z\\), \\(v = xy + yz + zx\\), \\(w = xyz\\). But not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider substituting variables such that \\(t = x + z\\). Since the expression is \\((x + y)(y + z) = (x + z + y) y + x z = (u) y + x z\\), but maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to use H\u00f6lder's inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of symmetry. Since the problem is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\), perhaps the minimal occurs when \\(x = z\\), which is what I assumed"

It is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\), but not in \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) all together.\n\nWait, if \\(x = y = z\\), then the constraint becomes \\(x^3 (3x) =1 \\Rightarrow 3 x^4 = 1 \\Rightarrow x = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{1/4}\\), which is approximately 0.7598.\n\nThen, the expression \\((x + y)(y + z) = (x + x)(x + x) = (2x)(2x) = 4x^2\\).\n\nPlugging \\(x = (1/3)^{1/4}\\), so \\(x^2 = (1/3)^{1/2} = 1/\\sqrt{3}\\), so \\(4x^2 = 4/\\sqrt{3} \\approx 2.309\\), which is higher than 2.
