Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest possible gcd when I take the gcd of \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\).\n\nFirst, maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm. I've heard that the Euclidean algorithm is a good method for finding the gcd of two numbers. It involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then replacing the larger number with the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd. So, let's try applying that here.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as \\(a = n + 7\\) and \\(b = 2n + 1\\). I need to find \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\). Using the Euclidean algorithm, I can write:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(2n + 1\\) is larger than \\(n + 7\\) when \\(n\\) is greater than or equal to 1, let's apply the algorithm by subtracting multiples of \\(a\\) from \\(b\\) to reduce the problem. So, I can write:\n\n\\[\n2n + 1 - 2 \\times (n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13\n\\]\n\nWait, so that means:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, -13)\n\\]\n\nBut since gcd is always a positive integer, \\(\\gcd(n + 7, -13)\\) is the same as \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13)\\). So, the gcd reduces to \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13)\\). \n\nNow, since 13 is a prime number, the only possible divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd can either be 1 or 13, depending on whether \\(n + 7\\) is a multiple of"

That would happen if and only if \\(13\\) divides \\(n + 7\\), which implies that \\(n + 7\\) is a multiple of 13. In other words, \\(n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13\\), which simplifies to \\(n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13\\). Since \\(n\\) is a positive integer, we can express this as \\(n = 13k - 7\\) for some positive integer \\(k\\). \n\nBut we need to ensure that \\(n\\) is positive. So, \\(13k - 7 > 0\\) implies \\(k > \\frac{7}{13}\\), so the smallest integer \\(k\\) is 1, which gives \\(n = 13(1) - 7 = 6\\). \n\nLet me check for \\(n = 6\\). Then, \\(n + 7 = 13\\), and \\(2n + 1 = 13\\). So, \\(\\gcd(13, 13) = 13\\). That seems to work. \n\nWait, but I should check if this is indeed the maximum possible. Since 13 is a prime number, the gcd can't be higher than 13. So, the maximum possible gcd is 13, and it occurs when \\(n\\) is such that \\(n + 7\\) is divisible by 13.\n\nJust to verify, let's pick another \\(n\\) value. For example, let \\(n = 13 \\times 2 - 7 = 19\\). Then, \\(n + 7 = 26\\) and \\(2n + 1 = 39\\). So, \\(\\gcd(26, 39)\\). Well, 26 factors are 1, 2, 13, 26, and 39 factors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So, the gcd is 13 again. That checks out.\n\nSimilarly, let me pick another one. Let\u2019s say \\(n = 13 \\times 3 - 7 = 34\\). Then \\(n + 7 = 41\\), and \\(2n + 1 = 69\\). \\(\\gcd(41, 69)\\)."

Hmm, did I do that correctly?\n\nWait, 2n + 1 when n = 34 is 69. 69 divided by 41 is 1 with a remainder of 28, then 41 divided by 28 is 1 with a remainder of 13, then 28 divided by 13 is 2 with a remainder of 2, then 13 divided by 2 is 6 with a remainder of 1, and then 2 divided by 1 is 2 with a remainder of 0. So, the gcd is 1. Oh, that's interesting. So, even though \\(n +7 =41\\) which is a prime, the gcd isn't 41 but is 1. Because 2n +1=69 is 3*23, but 41 is prime.\n\nWait, so perhaps sometimes when \\(n =13k -7\\), \\(n +7 =13k\\), but then \\(2n +1 =2(13k -7) +1=26k -14 +1=26k -13=13(2k -1)\\). So, \\(2n +1 =13(2k -1)\\). So, then \\(\\gcd(13k,13(2k -1))\\) is 13, since 13 is a common factor. So, unless \\(2k -1\\) shares a common factor with \\(k\\), which would be if there exists some prime that divides both \\(k\\) and \\(2k -1\\), but in reality, any common divisor \\(d\\) of \\(k\\) and \\(2k -1\\) would have to divide \\(2k -1 -2(k)\\) which is \\(-1\\), which implies that the gcd is 1. So, \\(k\\) and \\(2k -1\\) are coprime. Therefore, \\(\\gcd(n +7,2n +1)=\\gcd(13k,13(2k -1))=13\\). So, as long as \\(n +7\\) is a multiple of 13, the gcd will be 13. \n\nWait, so why in the case where \\(n=34\\) (\\(k=3\\)) did \\(\\gcd(41,"

Wait, but according to the previous equation, \\(n +7 =13k\\). Wait, if \\(k=3\\), then \\(n +7 =13*3=39\\), so n would be 32, not 34. Wait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. If \\(n =13k -7\\), then when k=3, n=13*3 -7=39-7=32. So, n=32. Then, n+7=39, which is 13*3, and 2n+1=65, which is 13*5. So, gcd(39,65)=13. That works. \n\nEarlier, I thought n=34, but that was incorrect. So, my mistake was in the calculation of n when k=3. So, n=32, not 34. So, that's where I messed up. So, in that case, the gcd is indeed 13. \n\nTherefore, whenever n is of the form 13k -7, then the gcd is 13, and otherwise, it's 1. Since 13 is prime, the maximum possible gcd is 13. \n\nWait, but let me check another case where maybe the gcd could be higher. Suppose there is a number greater than 13 that divides both n+7 and 2n+1. Let's suppose d divides both n+7 and 2n+1. Then, d divides (2n +1) - 2*(n +7). Let me compute that:\n\n(2n +1) - 2*(n +7) = 2n +1 -2n -14 = -13. \n\nTherefore, d divides -13, so d divides 13. Since 13 is prime, the possible divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the gcd can only"

Therefore, the greatest possible value is 13. \n\nWait, let me check for n=6 again. n=6, n +7=13, 2n +1=13. So, gcd is 13. That's correct. For n=32, n +7=39, 2n +1=65. gcd(39,65)=13. Correct. For n=19, n +7=26, 2n +1=39. gcd(26,39)=13. \n\nWait, n=19: 2n +1 is 39, which is 13*3, and n +7 is 26, which is 13*2. So, yes, both are multiples of 13, so gcd is 13. \n\nWhat about n=27: n +7=34, 2n +1=55. Gcd(34,55). 34 factors: 2,17. 55 factors:5,11. So, gcd is 1. Hence, when n is not 13k -7, the gcd is 1. \n\nWait, n=28: n +7=35, 2n +1=57. Gcd(35,57). 35 is 5*7, 57 is 3*19. So, gcd is 1. \n\nWait, but n=13*4 -7=45: n +7=52, 2n +1=91.

Okay, my mistake again, calculation error. \n\nSo, 13*5 is 65, so n is 65-7=58, which leads to 2n +1= 116 +1=117. Gcd of 65 and 117: gcd(65,117). 117 divided by 65 is 1 rem 52. Then gcd(65,52). 65 divided by 52 is 1 rem 13. Then gcd(52,13) is 13. So yes, that works. \n\nAlright, so to wrap this up. The key steps were:\n\n1. Use the Euclidean algorithm to rewrite gcd(n +7, 2n+1) as gcd(n+7, 13).\n2. Since 13 is prime, the gcd can only be 1 or 13.\n3. The gcd will be 13 precisely when n+7 is divisible by 13, which occurs when n \u2261 -7 mod13 (i.e., n \u22616 mod13).\n\nTherefore, the maximum gcd is 13, achieved when n=13k-7 for some integer k. Since n must be positive, k must be at least 1, so n=6, 19, 32, etc.\n\nSo, the greatest possible value is 13. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{13}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13}\n</think>\n\nLet \\(n\\) be a positive integer.
