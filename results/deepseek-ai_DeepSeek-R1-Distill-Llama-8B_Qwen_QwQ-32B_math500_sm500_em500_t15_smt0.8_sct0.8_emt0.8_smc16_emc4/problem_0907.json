Therefore, the decimal representation will terminate.\n\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 4 \\cdot 78125 = 312500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rewrite the Fraction:**\n   \n   The fraction becomes:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{312500}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   \n   To convert the fraction to a decimal, consider that the denominator must be a power of 10. Since the denominator has \\( 5^7 \\) and \\( 2^2 \\), we'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\( 2^7 \\) to eliminate the \\( 5^7 \\) from the denominator.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\times 128}{312500 \\times 128} = \\frac{2688}{40000000}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, place the decimal point such that there are 8 decimal places (since"

So the correct decimal is 0.0000672.\n\n   Wait, but in my first step I multiplied by 128 (2^7), but that would give denominator 2^(2+7)*5^7 = 2^9*5^7, which is not 10^something. So that was a mistake. The correct approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(5) to make the exponent of 2 equal to 7 (since 5^7 requires 2^7 to make 10^7). \n\n   So, the correct calculation is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{"
