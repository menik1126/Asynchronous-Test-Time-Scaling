The question asks for the sum of all complex solutions. That makes me think I might need to find all the roots and then add them up. But solving this directly seems really tough because of the denominators. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me see. The left side has each term as a fraction where the numerator is increasing by 1 each time\u20141, 2, 3, 4\u2014and the denominators are \\(x^2 - n\\) where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So, maybe there's a substitution or something I can do here.\n\nWait, maybe I can let \\(y = x^2\\). Then each denominator becomes \\(y - 1\\), \\(y - 2\\), \\(y - 3\\), \\(y - 4\\). That simplifies the left side a bit. Let me try that substitution.\n\nSo, substituting \\(y = x^2\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay, but now I have \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). Is there a way to eliminate \\(x\\)? Since \\(y = x^2\\), \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{y}\\). That might complicate things because of the square roots. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of substituting, I can think about the form of the equation. The left side is a sum of terms like \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\), which looks similar to a rational function. The right side is linear, so maybe the left side can be expressed as a linear function plus something that, when set to zero, gives a polynomial equation.\n\nLet me consider bringing everything"

The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). The common denominator would be the product of all these denominators. That's going to be a huge polynomial. Let me see:\n\nDenominator: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). That's degree 8. Then the numerator would be a combination of terms each multiplied by the product of the other denominators. This seems really messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the left-hand side (LHS) is a function of \\(x^2\\), so maybe if I let \\(y = x^2\\), then the LHS is a function of \\(y\\), but the right-hand side (RHS) is a function of \\(x\\). Since \\(y = x^2\\), the RHS can be written in terms of \\(y\\) but with a square root, which complicates things. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the equation is of the form \\(f(x^2) = 2010x -4\\). If I can write this as \\(f(x^2) - 2010x +4 =0\\), then perhaps the equation is a polynomial equation in \\(x\\). Let me see.\n\nSuppose I denote \\(f(x^2)\\) as the sum of the fractions. To combine all terms over a common denominator, as I thought before, but maybe I can do that step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's symmetry here. Let me check the coefficients and denominators. The numerators are 1,2,3,4 and denominators are x\u00b2 -1, x\u00b2-2, etc. The numerators are exactly the same as the constants in the denominators.

Or perhaps recognizing a pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to express each term as a derivative of something?\n\nWait, let me think about transforming the equation. Maybe I can write each term as a derivative. For example, considering the derivative of 1/(x\u00b2 - k) with respect to x. Hmm, derivative is -2x/(x\u00b2 -k)^2. Maybe not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write each term as 1/(x\u00b2 -k) = 1/(x - sqrt(k))(x + sqrt(k)).

Hmm, not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the left side can be expressed as a sum of partial fractions or something similar.\n\nWait, maybe try to compute the left side as a function and see its behavior. But with such high coefficients, maybe the function is equal to a linear function. So perhaps f(t) = 2010x -4, where f(t) is some function depending on t, but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe if we think of this as 2010x -4 = f(x^2). So, for some function f.\n\nBut 2010x -4 is a linear function, while f(x^2) is a function of x\u00b2, which is even symmetric, unless f(x^2) is constructed to be linear in x.\n\nWait, f(x^2) being linear in x.
