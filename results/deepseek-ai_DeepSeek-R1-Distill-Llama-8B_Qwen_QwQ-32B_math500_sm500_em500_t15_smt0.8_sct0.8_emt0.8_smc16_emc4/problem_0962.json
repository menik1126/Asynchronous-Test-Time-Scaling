There are two scenarios to consider for the ratio of their pay to remain the same.\n\n**Scenario 1: Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, and Nate stays at 12 dogs.**\n- Denali's new number of dogs: \\( 16 + 4x \\)\n- Nate's number of dogs: 12\n- The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay should be the same as the original ratio.\n\n**Scenario 2: \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.**\n- Denali's new number of dogs: \\( 16 + x \\)\n- Nate's new number of dogs: \\( 12 - x \\)\n- The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same.\n\nNext, I'll set up equations based on the ratios being equal in both scenarios.\n\nFrom Scenario 1:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16}{12}\n\\]\n\nFrom Scenario 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{16}{12}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16}{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n16 + 4x = 16\n\\]\n\\[\n4x = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, \\( x \\neq 0 \\), so this solution isn't valid.

The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
