Start with \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\).\n2. Then subtract \\(4\\), resulting in \\(6 - 4 = 2\\).\n3. Next, add \\(5\\) to get \\(2 + 5 = 7\\).\n4. Finally, add \\(6\\) to obtain \\(7 + 6 = 13\\).\n\nThe original expression evaluates to 13. To minimize the result, I should aim to maximize the negative impact of the subtraction operation. This means grouping numbers in such a way that the larger numbers are being subtracted.\n\nOne effective approach is to group the smallest numbers together before performing the subtraction:\n1. Compute \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\).\n2. Subtract \\(4\\) from this result: \\(6 - 4 = 2\\).\n3. Continue by adding \\(5\\): \\(2 + 5 = 7\\).\n4. Finally, add \\(6\\): \\(7 + 6 = 13\\).\n\nThis method doesn't decrease the value. To achieve a lower result, consider grouping the subtraction with a larger number to increase the negative impact.\n\nAn alternative strategy is to group the numbers before the subtraction with the largest possible numbers:\n1. Start with \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\).\n2. Then subtract the sum of \\(4 + 5 + 6\\): \\(6 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9\\).\n3. Finally, add the remaining number: \\(-9 + 6 = -3\\).\n\nThis grouping yields a result of \\(-3\\), which is significantly lower than the original 13.\n\nAnother possibility is to group the subtraction with only part of the subsequent numbers to see if we can achieve an even lower value:\n1. Compute \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\\).\n2. Subtract only part of the remaining numbers: \\(2 - (5 + 6) = 2 - 11 = -9\\).\n3. This results in"

If I group \\(5 + 6\\) as a positive term, then subtracting them would require parentheses around them. Let me check the exact placement.\n\nWait, actually, the expression after the subtraction of 4 is followed by +5 +6. To subtract (5+6), the parentheses would have to be placed around 5+6, but since the operator before them is a plus, you can't subtract them unless you have a negative sign. Alternatively, perhaps another grouping.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: group the terms after the subtraction to make a larger negative value. Let me try different groupings.\n\nLet me try grouping the terms after the subtraction of 4 with the following terms in a way that the subtraction applies to a larger sum.\n\nFor instance, if I write \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\\), that would be \\(6 - 15 = -9\\). But the original expression has a plus after the 4, so the parentheses would have to encompass the 4,5,6 with the plus signs. Wait, but the original expression is 1+2+3-4+5+6. So inserting parentheses around 4+5+6 would require that the operator before the 4 is a minus, so the parentheses would be after the minus, so it would be 1+2+3 - (4+5+6). That is valid. So that gives -9, which is better than the previous -3.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem, they had 1+2+3-(4+5)+6 = 3. So that's a different grouping. So perhaps the first idea is better.\n\nWait, so if I group 4+5+6 together after the minus, that gives a total of -9. But let me check the exact expression:\n\nOriginal expression: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6.\n\nIf I add parentheses as 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6), then yes, that would be 6 - 15 = -9. But is that allowed?

So with the parentheses, it's 1+2+3 - (4+5+6) = 6 - 15 = -9. Then, wait, but does that cover all the terms after 3 correctly? Let me check:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\nThen, subtract (4 + 5 + 6), which is 15, giving 6 - 15 = -9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is evaluated to -9. But wait, the original expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6, which equals 1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6 = (1+2+3) + (-4 +5 +6) = 6 + (7) = 13. So by grouping 4+5+6, the -4 +5 +6 becomes -9, so overall 6 -9 = -3. Wait, that's different. There's a confusion here.\n\nWait, no. If I group 4+5+6, the expression would be 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I group 5+6, but not 4, it would be 1+2+3-4+(5+6) = 1+2+3-4+11 = 6 -4 +11 = 13. So same as original.\n\nAlternatively, if I group 4-5+6, but that would be (4 -5) +6 = -1 +6 =5. So the expression becomes 1+2+3 +5 =11? But that's not a valid grouping because the subtraction is only between 4 and 5 if I place parentheses around 4-5, but since in the original expression, after 3, it's -4+5+6. So if I group as 3 - (4 -5) +6, but that would require inserting parentheses around 4-5. Alternatively, if I group 4+5, but the operator before 4 is a minus.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. To"

What if we group the terms after the subtraction in a way that creates a larger negative?\n\nWait, the only way to get a larger negative is to subtract a larger number. The maximum number we can subtract is 4+5+6=15, so 6-15=-9. Alternatively, if we can subtract a larger number, but since the terms after the minus are 4, then +5, +6, so the only way to subtract a larger number is to group those terms after the minus into a sum. So that gives us the -15, leading to -9.\n\nAlternatively, can we subtract a larger number by grouping before the minus?\n\nWait, the minus is only before the 4. So the operator before 4 is a minus, so the term is -4. To group terms before the minus with the minus, but that would require parentheses around the previous terms, but that would not change the value. For example, (1+2+3) -4 +5+6 is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, can we group the 1+2+3-4 as a group, then subtract the rest?\n\nWait, the rest is +5+6. To subtract those, you need a minus before them, but they are added. So unless you can insert a minus, which you can't. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, group 5+6 as a positive term, so you can't subtract them unless you have a minus before them. Since they are after the minus 4, but separated by a plus, you can't.\n\nAlternatively, group 4+5 as 9, so the expression becomes 1+2+3 - (4+5) +6 = 6 -9 +6 = 3, as in the example.\n\nAlternatively, group 4+5+6 as 15, so subtract that, getting -9.\n\nAlternatively, group 4+5 as 9, then subtract that, then add 6: 6 -9 +6 = 3.\n\nAlternatively, group 4 - (5 +6).
