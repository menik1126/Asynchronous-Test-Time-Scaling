            "output": "First, I notice that the expression involves terms with √2 and √3, along with their reciprocals. My goal is to combine these terms into a single fraction.\n\nI'll start by identifying the terms involving √2 and √3 separately. This helps in streamlining the combination process.\n\nNext, I'll rationalize the denominators of the reciprocal terms to eliminate the square roots from the denominators. This makes it easier to combine the terms.\n\nAfter rationalizing, I'll rewrite the original expression with all terms having rational denominators. This allows me to find a common denominator.\n\nFinding a common denominator is crucial for combining the fractions. Once the common denominator is identified, I'll adjust each term accordingly.\n\nNow, I'll combine the numerators over the common denominator, ensuring that all terms are properly aligned for addition. This step brings the expression closer to the desired form.\n\nFinally, I'll simplify the combined fraction by checking if any terms can be further reduced or simplified. This step ensures that the numerator and denominator are in their simplest form.\n\nWith the expression now in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, I'll identify the values of a, b, and c. Since a, b, and c must be positive integers and c should be as small as possible, I'll verify that there are no common factors between the numerator and denominator to ensure c is minimized.\n\nThe final values of a, b, and c will be used to calculate a + b + c, which is the required answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's rewrite the expression in the desired form step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Simplify Each Term**\n- **First Term:** \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)\n- **Second Term:** \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\)\n- **Third Term:** \\(\\sqrt{3}\\)\n- **Fourth Term:** \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\)\n\n**Step 2: Combine Like Terms**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{"
