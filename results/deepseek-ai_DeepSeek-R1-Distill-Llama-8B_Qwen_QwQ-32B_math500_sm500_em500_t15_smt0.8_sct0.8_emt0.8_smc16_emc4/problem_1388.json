The matrix M transforms the point (2, -1) to (9, 3) and the point (1, -3) to (7, -1). Hmm, okay, so the first thing I should do is figure out what the matrix M looks like because without knowing M, I can't apply it to the line y = 2x + 1.\n\nLet me recall that a matrix transformation works by multiplying the matrix M with a vector representing the point to get the image. So, if I have a point (x, y), it can be written as a vector [x; y]. When I multiply M by this vector, I get the image point.\n\nSo, if I let M be a 2x2 matrix, then:\n\n[ a  b ] [2]   = [9]\n[ c  d ] [-1]   = [3]\n\nand\n\n[ a  b ] [1]   = [7]\n[ c  d ] [-3]   = [-1]\n\nOkay, so I have two equations for the first transformation and two more for the second. That gives me four equations, but since M is a 2x2 matrix, it has four variables (a, b, c, d). So, four equations should be enough to solve for a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nFrom the first equation:\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9  --> 2a - b = 9  ...(1)\na*(-1) + b*d = 3  --> -a + b*d = 3  ...(2)\n\nFrom the second equation:\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7  --> a - 3b = 7  ...(3)\na*(-3) + b*d = -1  --> -3a + b*d = -1  ...(4)\n\nHmm, okay, so I have equations (1), (2), (3), (4).\n\nLooking at equations (1) and (3), both have 'a' and 'b'. Maybe I can solve for a and b first.\n\nFrom equation (1): 2a - b = 9\n\nFrom equation (3): a - 3b = 7\n\nI can solve"

Now let's find c and d.\n\nLooking at equations (2) and (4):\n\nEquation (2): -a + d*(-1) = 3? Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the equations again. Wait, the second component of the first transformation is:\n\nThe matrix M is [a b; c d], so when multiplied by [2; -1], the second component is c*2 + d*(-1) = 3. Wait, I think I messed up the equations earlier.\n\nOh no, I think I made a mistake in writing the equations. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the first transformation is:\n\nM * [2; -1] = [9; 3]\n\nSo, the first row of M times the vector gives 9, and the second row gives 3.\n\nSo, first row: a*2 + b*(-1) = 9\n\nSecond row: c*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, for the second transformation:\n\nM * [1; -3] = [7; -1]\n\nFirst row: a*1 + b*(-3) = 7\n\nSecond row: c*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nAh, okay, so I had the first components right, but the second components were wrong.

The line y = 2x + 1 consists of all points [x; 2x +1] for x real numbers. So, to find the image, I need to apply M to each point on the line and find the set of all resulting points.\n\nAlternatively, since we know how M transforms individual points, perhaps I can find a transformation of the line.\n\nBut another approach is to note that applying M to a vector [x; y] will result in [4x - y; 2x + y].\n\nWait, that's from the matrix M:\n\n[4  -1] [x]   = [4x - y]\n\n[2   1] [y]     [2x + y]\n\nSo, if the original point is (x, y), then the image under M is (4x - y, 2x + y).\n\nNow, the line y = 2x +1 can be parametrized as (x, 2x +1).

So, replacing u with x and v with y, the equation is y = 2x +3.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the image coordinates as (X, Y) = (4x - y, 2x + y). Since the original line is y = 2x +1, so substituting y = 2x +1 into the expressions for X and Y:\n\nX = 4x - (2x +1) = 2x -1\n\nY = 2x + (2x +1) = 4x +1\n\nSo, as before, X = 2x -1 and Y =4x +1.

Apply M:\n\nM*(0;1) = [4*0 -1*1; 2*0 +1*1] = (-1;1)\n\nWait, but according to the image line, when X = -1, Y = 2*(-1)+3 = -2+3=1. So, the point (-1,1) is on the image line. That matches.\n\nAnother point: x=1, y=3. So, (1;3). Applying M:\n\n[4*1 -3; 2*1 +3] = (4-3=1; 2+3=5). So, (1;5).\n\nAccording to image line, when X=1, Y=2*1+3=5.

So, the image line is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, let me try it another way. Since we have the matrix M, perhaps we can find a parametric equation for the image of the line, and then eliminate the parameter.\n\nSo, the line y = 2x +1 can be written as [x; 2x +1].
