            "output": "To convert the fraction 57/160 to a terminating decimal, I'll start by finding its decimal equivalent by dividing 57 by 160.\n\nSince 57 is less than 160, the decimal will be less than 1. I'll set up the division by adding a decimal point and zeros to 57 to make it 57.000.\n\nDividing 57 by 160, I'll begin with the first digit after the decimal point, which is 0, and continue until the division is complete.\n\nAfter performing the division, I'll find that 57 divided by 160 equals 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction:**\n   - The denominator is 160, which factors into \\(16 \\times 10\\).\n   - Since 10 is a factor of 10, the decimal will terminate.\n\n2. **Divide 57 by 160:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n   \\]\n   - Perform the division \\(57 \\div 160\\) to obtain the decimal.\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.35625}\n   \\]"
