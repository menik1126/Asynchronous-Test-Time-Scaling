The problem says that the solutions to this equation form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon.

Then I have to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. First, I know that the roots of a polynomial equation in the complex plane correspond to points which can be connected to form a convex polygon. So, if I can find the roots, I can plot them and compute the area.\n\nLooking at the polynomial: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). Hmm, that's a quartic equation. Maybe I can factor it somehow. It seems a bit complicated, but perhaps it's related to a known polynomial form. Let me think, quartic equations can sometimes be factored into quadratics or even linear terms.\n\nWait, the coefficients involve powers of 'i'. Let me write down the equation again:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \\)\n\nHmm. The coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, and -i. This seems cyclic in a way, with coefficients at each power of z having a factor of i and the signs alternating... Wait, maybe this is a geometric series or something like that.\n\nI recall that sometimes complex roots come in reciprocal pairs or something when the coefficients have that symmetric property. Let me check if that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor this polynomial as a product of two quadratics. Let me assume that:\n\n\\( (z^2 + a z + b)(z^2 + c z + d) = z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 - 4i z - i \\)\n\nIf I can find a, b, c, d such that when"

Since we need to find complex numbers b and d such that their product is -i. Maybe they are simple complex numbers. Let me think of possible factors of -i. For example, if b = 1 and d = -i, then their product is -i. Alternatively, b = i and d = 1, but then product is i, which is not -i. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe b = -1 and d = i, so (-1)(i) = -i.

Recognize that the equation can be rewritten by expanding (z +i)^4.\n\n2. Find that (z +i)^4 =1 +i.\n\n3. Therefore, z +i is a fourth root of 1 +i.\n\n4. Express 1 +i in polar form as sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}.\n\n5. Thus, the fourth roots are (sqrt(2))^{1/4} e^{i (\u03c0/16 + \u03c0 k/2)} for k=0,1,2,3.\n\n6. Therefore, each z is obtained by taking these roots and subtracting i.\n\n7. The figure formed is a square, because the roots are equally spaced on a circle.\n\n8.

So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the radius r is 2^{1/8}, so r squared is 2^{1/4}, so 2*r^2 is 2^{1 +1/4}=2^{5/4}, which is indeed 2^{5/4}= (2^5)^{1/4}=32^{1/4}, but since 2 is prime, the form is 2^{5/4}, so p=2, a=5, b=4, so a+b+p=11.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the solutions of the equation are the vertices of a convex polygon\". Since the roots are the fourth roots shifted by -i, the polygon is a square, but shifted. However, shifting doesn't change the area, so the area is indeed the same as the square formed by the roots of (z)^4 =1 +i, which is the square with vertices on the circle of radius 2^{1/8}, so area 2^{5/4}.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2^{5/4}, so p=2, a=5, b=4, so 5+4+2=11.\n\nBut let me check again the area calculation. Let me think of the square with vertices on a circle of radius r. The area of a square inscribed in a circle of radius r is 2 r^2. Because the diagonal of the square is 2r, so if the diagonal is 2r, then the side length s is (2r)/sqrt(2)=sqrt(2) r, so area is s^2=2 r^2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, since r=2^{1/8}, then area is 2*(2^{1/8})^2=2*(2^{1/4})=2^{1 +1/4}=2^{5/4}. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2^{5/4}, so a=5, b=4, p"
