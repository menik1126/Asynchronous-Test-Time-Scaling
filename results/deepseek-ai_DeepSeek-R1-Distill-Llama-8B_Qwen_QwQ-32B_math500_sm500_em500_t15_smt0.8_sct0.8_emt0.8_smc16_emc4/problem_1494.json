The prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll identify which of these primes are also odd numbers greater than zero. Since all prime numbers except for 2 are odd, I can exclude 2 from the list.\n\nAfter removing 2, the remaining prime numbers are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nCounting these, there are 9 prime numbers that are also odd numbers greater than zero.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **List of Prime Numbers Less Than 30**:\n   - 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n\n2. **Identify Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero**:\n   - All odd numbers greater than zero are simply the set of odd integers starting from 3, 5, 7, etc.\n\n3. **Find the Intersection**:\n   - The intersection consists of all numbers that are both prime and odd.\n   - Since 2 is the only even prime number, it is excluded from the intersection.\n   - Therefore, the intersection includes: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n\n4. **Count the Elements in the Intersection**:\n   - There are **9** such numbers.\n\n\\boxed{9}"
