This will give me the number of sixes in the base six representation.\n\nAfter finding the quotient from the division, I'll determine what remains after subtracting the product of the quotient and 6 from the original number. This remainder will be the coefficient for the units place in base six.\n\nFollowing this process, I'll continue dividing the remainder by 6, taking note of each quotient and remainder until the quotient becomes zero. Each remainder corresponds to a digit in the base six number, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nOnce all quotients and remainders are found, I'll arrange the remainders in the reverse order to get the final base six equivalent of 999 in base ten.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\) to its equivalent in base six, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Base Conversion:**\n   - In base six, each digit represents a power of six.\n   - The rightmost digit is \\(6^0 = 1\\), the next is \\(6^1 = 6\\), then \\(6^2 = 36\\), \\(6^3 = 216\\), and so on.\n\n2. **Determine How Many Sixes Fit into 999:**\n   - Divide 999 by 6 and find the quotient and remainder.\n   - \\(999 \\div 6 = 166\\) with a remainder of \\(3\\).\n\n3. **Continue Converting Lower Powers:**\n   - Now, divide 166 by 6: \\(166 \\div 6 = 27\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\).\n   - Next, divide 27 by 6: \\(27 \\div 6 = 4\\) with a remainder of \\(3\\).\n   - Finally, divide 4 by 6: \\(4 \\div 6 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\).\n\n4. **Construct the Base Six Number:**\n   - Write the remainders from last to first: \\(4\\), \\(3\\), \\(4\\), \\(3\\).\n\n5. **Final Base Six Equivalent:**\n   - Combining these, \\(999_{10}\\) in base six is \\(4333_6\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed"
