Yann can choose from 10 different dishes, and so can Camille.\n\nNext, calculate the total number of possible combinations if there were no restrictions. This would be 10 options for Yann multiplied by 10 options for Camille, resulting in 100 possible combinations.\n\nHowever, since Yann and Camille refuse to order the same dish, we need to subtract the scenarios where their choices are identical. There are 10 instances where Yann and Camille choose the same dish.\n\nBy subtracting these 10 identical combinations from the total of 100, we find that there are 90 different combinations of meals they can order together.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 different meal combinations.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of choices each person has.**\n- Yann has 10 options to choose from.\n- Camille also has 10 options to choose from.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of possible combinations without any restrictions.**\n- For each of Yann's choices, Camille has 10 options.\n- So, the total number of combinations = 10 × 10 = 100.\n\n**Step 3: Subtract the combinations where both choose the same dish.**\n- There are 10 scenarios where Yann and Camille choose the same dish (e.g., both choose dish 1, both choose dish 2, etc.).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final number of valid combinations.**\n- Total combinations without restrictions: 100\n- Subtract the 10 identical combinations: 100 - 10 = 90\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
