            "output": "Okay, I have this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, I need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that both sides of the equation involve exponential terms. The left side has 3^{2x}, which can be rewritten as (3^x)^2 because when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So, 3^{2x} is the same as (3^x)^2. That might be helpful because it changes the equation into something that might look like a quadratic if I let y = 3^x or something like that.\n\nSo, let me try that substitution. Let me let y = 3^x. Then, 3^{2x} becomes y^2. Now, substituting into the original equation, I get y^2 + 19 = 10^x. But wait, I have 10^x on the right side, which is another exponential term with base 10. Hmm, that complicates things because it's a different base. Maybe I can express 10^x in terms of y as well, but I'm not sure how. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides, but that might not be straightforward because of the addition of 19. If I try to isolate 10^x, I can write 10^x = y^2 + 19. Then, taking the natural log of both sides would give me x = ln(y^2 + 19). But that seems like it's complicating things further because I still have x in there.\n\nWait, maybe instead of substituting y = 3^x, I can consider both sides as exponential functions and see if they intersect at a certain point. Let me think about the behavior of the functions 3^{2x} and 10^x. Because 3^{2x} is the same as (3^x)^2, it grows much faster than 10^x as x increases. So, maybe there's a point where 3^{2x} is just slightly larger than 10^x, especially for some x where they balance out. Perhaps there's only one solution where these two functions intersect.\n\nLet me test some values of x to see where the equation"

So, perhaps at x=2, which is greater than 0.954, 10^x has already overtaken 9^x, but in reality, 9^x=3^{2x}, so for x=2, both sides are equal. Hmm, but then when we go to x=3, 9^3=729, 10^3=1000, so 10^x is larger. Wait, but 3^{2x} is 9^x, so at x=2, 9^2=81, 10^2=100, so 9^2 + 19 = 81 +19=100, which equals 10^2.

Let's compute 3^{2x}=9, 10^x=10, so 9+19=28 which is more than 10. So 3^{2x} +19 is bigger. So at x=2, they are equal, but at x=1, 3^{2x}+19 is 28 vs 10^x=10. Then at x=2, 81 +19=100 vs 100.

Let me consider the behavior as x approaches negative infinity.\n\nAs x approaches negative infinity, 3^{2x} approaches 0 because it's 1/9^{|x|}, which goes to zero. So 3^{2x} +19 approaches 19, and 10^x approaches zero. So f(x) approaches 19-0=19>0.\n\nSo as x goes to negative infinity, f(x) approaches 19, and at x=2, f(x)=0. So the function starts at 19 when x approaches negative infinity, decreases, crosses zero at x=2, then continues to decrease, going negative as x increases beyond 2.

Therefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another solution somewhere else. Let me see for x=3, as before, f(x)=748 -1000\u2248-252. So negative. What about x=4? 3^8=6561, plus 19=6580. 10^4=10000. So f(4)=6580-10000= -3420. Still negative. So as x increases, it's getting more negative.

So I think x=2 is the only solution.\n\nWait, but let me try x=2. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute 3^{2x} when x=2, which is 3^4=81, plus 19=100. 10^2=100. So yes, that works. Now, is that the only solution?\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the function 9^x +19 -10^x is always increasing or decreasing. Let me check its derivative to see if it's monotonic.

When x is greater than -0.468, (9/10)^x <1.0505, so ln(9)*(9/10)^x < ln(10), so f'(x) is negative. Therefore, the function f(x) has a maximum at x\u2248-0.468.\n\nTherefore, the function f(x) increases up to x\u2248-0.468, then decreases afterward.
