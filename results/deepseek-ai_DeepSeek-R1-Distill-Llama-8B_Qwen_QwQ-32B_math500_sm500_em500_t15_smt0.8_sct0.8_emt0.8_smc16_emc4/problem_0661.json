This gives me the equation:\n\\( 10T = 3S + G \\).\n\nFrom the second statement, two treeks and one goolee are equal to one squig:\n\\( 2T + G = S \\).\n\nNow, I can substitute the value of \\( S \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\\( 10T = 3(2T + G) + G \\).\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\\( 10T = 6T + 3G + G \\),\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\( 10T = 6T + 4G \\).\n\nSubtracting \\( 6T \\) from both sides:\n\\( 4T = 4G \\).\n\nFinally, dividing both sides by \\( 4 \\):\n\\( T = G \\).\n\nThis means one treek weighs the same as one goolee.\n\nUsing this information, I can substitute \\( T = G \\) back into the second equation:\n\\( 2T + T = S \\),\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\( 3T = S \\).\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( T \\) represent the weight of one treek.\n   - Let \\( S \\) represent the weight of one squig.\n   - Let \\( G \\) represent the weight of one goolee.\n\n2. **Translate the Statements into Equations:**\n   - **First Statement:** Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n     \\[\n     10T = 3S + G\n     \\]\n   - **Second Statement:** Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n     \\[\n     2T + G = S\n     \\]\n\n3. **Express \\( S \\) from the Second Equation:**\n   \\[\n   S = 2T + G\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( S \\"
