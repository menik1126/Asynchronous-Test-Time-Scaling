            "output": "First, I'll define the weights of each item using variables. Let T represent the weight of a treek, S for a squig, and G for a goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, \"Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee,\" I can write the equation:\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says, \"Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\" This gives me the equation:\n2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I'll substitute S from the second equation into the first one:\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\nExpanding that, 10T = 6T + 3G + G, which simplifies to 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides, I get 4T = 4G. Dividing both sides by 4, I find that T equals G.\n\nSince T = G, I can substitute back into the second equation:\n2T + T = S, so 3T = S.\n\nTherefore, the weight of one squig is equal to three treeks. To find how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, I divide both sides by the weight of a treek:\nS = 3T.\n\nThus, three treeks weigh as much as one squig.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nTen treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's define the weights of each item as follows:\n- Let \\( T \\) represent the weight of one treek.\n- Let \\( S \\) represent the weight of one squig.\n- Let \\( G \\) represent the weight of one goolee.\n\nWe are given two statements:\n\n1. **Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.**  \n   This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n\n2. **Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.**  \n   This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   2T + G ="
