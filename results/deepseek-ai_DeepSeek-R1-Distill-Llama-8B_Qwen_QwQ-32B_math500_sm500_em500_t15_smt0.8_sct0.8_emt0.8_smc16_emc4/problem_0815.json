I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, it must be a monic polynomial or a multiple of it, but here a_n is 2, not 1. So maybe it's not monic. Wait, actually, the leading coefficient is 2, so it's not monic. But, if all roots are integers, the polynomial can be expressed as f(x) = 2*(x - r1)*(x - r2)*...*(x - rn), where each ri is an integer and are distinct. That makes sense because expanding this will give a polynomial with integer coefficients since all the roots are integers.\n\nGiven that a_0 is 66, which is the constant term. In the expanded form, the constant term is 2*(-1)^n*r1*r2*...*rn. So, 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66. Therefore, (product of roots) = 66 / 2*(-1)^n = 33*(-1)^n. Depending on whether n is even or odd, that could be 33 or -33. Wait, hold on: 2*product of roots*(-1)^n = 66. So, product of roots = 66 / (2*(-1)^n) )= 33 / (-1)^n. But 33 is a positive number, so depending on n, the product can be 33 or -33.\n\nBut n is just the degree, so whether n is even or odd affects the sign. Hmm, so the product of the roots could be either 33 or -33. Hmm, 33 factors into 1, 3, 11, 33. So, the roots have to be integers, so possible sets of roots could be combinations of these factors and their negatives.\n\nOur goal is to choose distinct integer roots such that when multiplied together (with sign depending on n), the absolute value is 33, and then find the expansion such that the coefficient a_{n-1} is minimized in absolute value.\n\nIn the expanded form, a_{n-"

            "output": "1} is the coefficient of x^{n-1}. In the standard polynomial expansion, for a monic polynomial (with leading coefficient 1), the coefficient of x^{n-1} is - (sum of the roots). But in our case, the leading coefficient is 2, so the monic polynomial would be f(x)/2 = (x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). So, expanding that, the coefficient of x^{n-1} would be - (sum of roots), so when multiplied by 2, the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the original polynomial is -2*(sum of roots). Wait, let me verify.\n\nSuppose the polynomial is f(x) = 2*(x - r1)*(x - r2)*...*(x - rn). Let's expand this. The leading term is 2x^n. Then the coefficient of x^{n-1} would be 2*(- (r1 + r2 + ... + rn)). So yes, that's correct. So, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). So, the absolute value is |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. Wait, so to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Hmm. So the problem reduces to finding distinct integers r1, r2,..., rn such that their product is \u00b133 (depending on n) and their sum has the minimal absolute value possible. Since the coefficient is proportional to the sum, we need to make the sum as close to zero as possible.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and whose sum is as close to zero as possible. Since 33 factors into primes as 3*11, so the factors would be 1, 3, 11, 33, but considering negative numbers as well, so possible factors can be positive and negative.\n\nWait, but the roots can be any distinct integers, not just divisors of 33. Since the product must be \u00b133, the roots have to multiply to 33 or -33, but they are integers, so the roots have to be factors of 33 or their negatives. But factors of 33 include"

So, if we can use smaller factors, perhaps we can get a more balanced sum.\n\nBut, let's think about how to get the product to be \u00b133 with the smallest number of terms (i.e., the least degree n, since higher degree would allow more roots, but the more roots, the more complicated the sum). Wait, but what's the minimal possible n?\n\nLet me consider: 33 can be factored into two numbers: 3*11, or 1*33, or (-3)*(-11), etc. So, the minimal degree would be 2, but let's check if we can get a product of 33 with more roots, but n can't be less than 2? Or can it?\n\nWait, no, if n is 1, then it would be linear, so f(x) = 2(x - r), but then the constant term would be -2r = 66, so r = -33. So that would be a root of -33. But wait, that works, but the polynomial would be f(x) = 2(x + 33), which indeed has a constant term of 66. So, n=1 is possible, but then the sum of roots is just -33, so |a_{n-1}| would be | -2*(-33)| = |66|, which is 66. But maybe with higher n, we can have smaller |a_{n-1}|.\n\nWait, so maybe n=1 is possible, but n=2 is the minimal. Wait, n=1 is possible, but perhaps n=2 allows a smaller |a_{n-1}|?\n\nWait, n is the degree, so for n=1, the coefficient a_{n-1} is a0, which is 66, but that's not helpful because we get |a_{n-1}|=66, which is large. So maybe with n=2, we can have a smaller coefficient.\n\nWait, for n=2, the polynomial is f(x)=2(x - r1)(x - r2). Then, the product r1*r2 must be 33 or -33. So, possible pairs are (1,33), (-1,-33), (3,11), (-3,-11"

So that works. The sum of roots is 3+11=14, so a_{n-1}= -2*(14)= -28, so |a_{n-1}|=28.\n\nAlternatively, if we take roots -3 and -11, then the product is (-3)*(-11)=33, so same as before. The sum would be -14, so a_{n-1}= -2*(-14)=28, same absolute value.\n\nAlternatively, if we take roots 1 and 33, their product is 33, sum is 34, so |a_{n-1}|=68, which is worse.\n\nAlternatively, if we take roots -1 and -33, same as above.\n\nAlternatively, if we take roots 3 and 11, but with one negative? Let's see, if we have roots 3 and -11, then the product is -33, so then 2*(-1)^2*(3*(-11)) = 2*(-33) = -66, which is not 66. So that would not work. Wait, so the product must be 33 or -33, but depending on n. Wait, the product of roots is (product of roots) = 33 / (-1)^n? Wait, let me go back.\n\nWait, the constant term is a0 = 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots). So, 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66. Therefore, product of roots = 66/(2*(-1)^n) = 33/(-1)^n. So, if n is even, then product of roots is 33, if n is odd, product of roots is -33.\n\nTherefore, for n=2 (even), product must be 33. For n=3 (odd), product must be -33.

For example, if roots are -1, 3, 11. Their product is (-1)*3*11 = -33, which is correct for n=3 (since product of roots = -33). The sum is (-1) + 3 + 11 = 13, so |a_{n-1}| = 2*|13| = 26, which is smaller than 28.\n\nWait, that's better.
