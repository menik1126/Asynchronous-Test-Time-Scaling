So, let me start by understanding the function step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f is defined for non-negative integers i and j, where j is between 0 and 4. The function is recursive, meaning it refers back to itself for smaller values of i and j.\n\nLet me break down the definition:\n\n1. If i = 0 and 0 \u2264 j \u2264 4, then f(0, j) is just mod_5(j + 1). So, for example, f(0,0) = 1, f(0,1) = 2, and so on up to f(0,4) = 0 (since 5 mod 5 is 0).\n\n2. If i \u2265 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i-1, 1). So, it's like if j is 0, we reduce i by 1 and set j to 1.\n\n3. If i \u2265 1 and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 4, then f(i, j) = f(i-1, f(i, j-1)). This is a nested recursive step, which might be more complicated.\n\nOur goal is to find f(2015, 2). That's a very large i, so I suspect there must be some periodicity or a repeating pattern to exploit.\n\nLet me try to compute f(i, j) for small values of i and j to see if I can identify a pattern.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n- f(0,0) = 1\n- f(0,1) = 2\n- f(0,2) = 3\n- f(0,3) = 4\n- f(0,4) = 0\n\nNow i = 1:\n- For j=0: f(1,0) = f(0,1) = 2\n- For j=1: f(1,1) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,2) = 3\n- For j=2: f(1,2) = f(0, f(1,"
