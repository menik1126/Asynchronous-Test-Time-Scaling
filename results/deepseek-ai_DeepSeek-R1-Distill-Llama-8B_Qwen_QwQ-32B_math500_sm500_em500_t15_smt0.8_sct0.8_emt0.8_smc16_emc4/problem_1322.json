I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I should probably sketch the rectangle and label all the points. O is the center, so it's the intersection point of the diagonals. The rectangle has sides AB and AD with a ratio of AB/AD = k, which means AB is longer than AD if k > 1, or shorter if k < 1. So, depending on the value of k, the rectangle could be longer in one direction than the other.\n\nSince the problem is about distance from a point to O versus the vertices, I think I need to find the region within the rectangle where the distance from any point to O is less than the distance to any of the four vertices. Once I identify that region, the area of that region divided by the area of the rectangle will give me the probability.\n\nLet me denote the rectangle's sides. Let\u2019s say AB is the length and AD is the width. So, AB = k * AD. Maybe it would help to assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let\u2019s place the center O at the origin (0,0). Then, if AB is along the x-axis and AD along the y-axis, the coordinates of the vertices can be determined.\n\nWait, actually, the Asymptote code shows the rectangle drawn from (-250,100) to (250,100), etc. So, the rectangle is actually centered at the origin with width 500 (from -250 to 250 on the x-axis) and height 200 (from -100 to 100 on the y-axis). Hmm, but in the problem, the ratio AB/AD = k. Maybe the specific dimensions don't matter because we're dealing with a ratio, but perhaps I need to keep it general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can assume the rectangle has length 2a and width 2b, so that the center O is at (0,0), and the vertices are at (a,b), (-a,b), (-a,-b), and (a,-b). Then, AB, the length of the top side, would be 2a, and AD, the width, would be 2b. So, AB/AD = (2"

So, let's set coordinates this way.\n\nTherefore, the rectangle has vertices at (a, b), (-a, b), (-a, -b), and (a, -b). The center is (0,0). So, to find the region of points closer to O than to any vertex, I need to find all points (x,y) inside the rectangle such that the distance from (x,y) to O is less than the distance to each of the four vertices.\n\nThe distance from (x,y) to O is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The distance to, say, vertex A (-a, b) would be sqrt((x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2). Similarly for the others. But since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe we can exploit symmetry here?\n\nThe problem is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis, since the rectangle is centered at the origin. So, perhaps we can consider just the first quadrant and then multiply the area by 4? Wait, but the region we are interested in is also likely symmetric, so maybe working in one quadrant is sufficient?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the regions closer to each vertex form certain boundaries, like perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex. The set of points equidistant to O and a vertex would form a perpendicular bisector between those two points, and the region closer to O would be on one side of that bisector. The intersection of all these regions (closer to O than any vertex) would be the area we need.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, for each vertex, we can find the bisector between O and that vertex, and the region closer to O is the intersection of the half-planes defined by those bisectors. Then, the area of that intersection within the rectangle is the desired region's area.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the equations of the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex, then find the polygon where all four bisectors define the region closer to O.\n\nLet me start with one vertex, say vertex A (-a, b). The bisector between O(0,0) and A(-a, b) is the set of points equidistant to both. So, setting the distance squared equal (to avoid square roots):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = ("

Let me pick one quadrant, say the first quadrant, where x >=0 and y >=0.\n\nIn this quadrant, I can consider the bisectors from vertex A and vertex B, but wait, in the first quadrant, the distance to A (-a, b) and B (a, b) would influence the region.\n\nBut in the first quadrant, actually, a point can't be closer to O than to both A and B, since A is in the second quadrant and B is in the first. Wait, perhaps no\u2014points in the first quadrant can be closer to O than to A, but might be closer to B.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the first quadrant, let's take a point near the origin, say (epsilon, epsilon). The distance to O is sqrt(2) epsilon, while the distance to A is sqrt( (epsilon + a)^2 + (epsilon - b)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Since sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) is much larger than sqrt(2) epsilon, so the point is closer to O.

If b <a, then x is less than (a\u00b2 + a\u00b2)/(2a) = a, so it's inside.\n\nTherefore, the intersection points between adjacent bisectors are inside the rectangle only when the rectangle is \"taller\" (b >a) or \"wider\" (a >b) accordingly.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I need to consider two cases: when k <=1 and k >=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me think of the Voronoi diagram for the points O and the four vertices. The region closer to O is the intersection of the four half-planes defined by the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex.\n\nAlternatively, since the rectangle is convex, the region closer to O is the set of points where their distance to O is less than their distance to each vertex.

So, each vertex is equidistant from O. So, for any point inside the rectangle, its distance to O is less than or equal to its distance to any vertex only if it is inside the Voronoi cell of O.\n\nBut since there are four vertices, the Voronoi cell for O is a polygon within the rectangle bounded by the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex.\n\nBut since all four vertices are on the convex hull of the set {O, A, B, C, D}, the Voronoi diagram would have edges between O and each vertex.\n\nHowever, since all four edges would be symmetric, perhaps the Voronoi cell around O is a rectangle or square?\n\nWait, but since the rectangle has different aspect ratios, it might not be square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region is a square rotated by 45 degrees, but scaled based on the rectangle's sides.\n\nWait, another approach: for each point in the rectangle, the condition is that its distance to O is less than its distance to any of the four vertices.\n\nExpressed mathematically:\n\nFor all vertices V, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) < sqrt( (x - V_x)^2 + (y - V_y)^2 ).\n\nSince the rectangle is symmetric, let's consider the first quadrant and then multiply by 4.\n\nIn the first quadrant, the vertices that influence the condition are A (-a, b), which is in the second quadrant, and B (a, b), which is in the first quadrant.

The other vertices are further away, so their bisectors might not affect the region in the first quadrant.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose a point is near the top edge of the first quadrant, say (0, b). The distance to O is sqrt(0 + b\u00b2) = b. The distance to B is sqrt( (a)^2 + 0 ) = a. So, if a > b (k >1), then the distance to B is larger, so the point (0, b) is closer to O.
