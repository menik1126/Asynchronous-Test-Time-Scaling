This requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation rates.\n\nThe first gear turns at \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute, which is equivalent to \\(\\frac{100}{3}\\) rotations per minute. The second gear turns at 45 rotations per minute.\n\nTo find the LCM, I'll first convert the rotations into fractions with a common denominator: \\(\\frac{100}{3}\\) and \\(45 = \\frac{135}{3}\\). The LCM of the numerators (100 and 135) is 1350, and the denominator remains 3. Therefore, the LCM of their rotation rates is \\(\\frac{1350}{3} = 450\\) rotations per minute.\n\nNext, I'll convert the LCM from rotations per minute to rotations per second by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). This results in \\(\\frac{450}{60} = 7.5\\) rotations per second.\n\nFinally, to find the total time in seconds, I'll multiply the LCM in rotations by the time per rotation. Each rotation takes \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) seconds, so the total time is \\(7.5 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 5\\) seconds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine after how many seconds the two gears will both have their marks pointing due north again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation rates.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Convert Rotation Rates to Rotations per Minute:**\n   \n   - **First Gear:** \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) turns per minute \\( = \\frac{100}{3} \\) turns per minute.\n   - **Second Gear:** \\( 45 \\) turns per minute.\n\n2. **Find the LCM of Their Rotation Rates:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM}\\left(\\frac{100}{3}, 45\\right) = \\text{LCM}\\left(100, 135\\right) \\div 3 = 1350 \\div 3 = 450 \\text{ turns per minute}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the LCM to Rotations per Second:**\n   \n   \\"

Alternatively, since LCM(100, 135) = 1350 rotations for the first gear and 450 rotations for the second gear, the time is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1350}{\\frac{100}{3}} = 40.5 \\text{ minutes} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{450}{45} = 10 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   \n   Wait, this step has an error. Let me correct it:\n\n   The LCM in terms of rotations is 450 turns for the second gear and \\( \\frac{450 \\times 3}{100} = 13.5 \\times 3 = 13.5 \\times 3 = 40.5 \\) turns for the first gear? Hmm, perhaps better to use LCM of periods.\n\n   Alternatively, compute the time when both complete integer rotations. The period (time per rotation) for the first gear is \\( \\frac{60}{100/3} = 1.8 \\) seconds per rotation. The second gear's period is \\( \\frac{60}{45} = 1.333... \\) seconds per rotation. LCM of 1.8 and 1.333... seconds.\n\n   Converting to fractions:\n   - First gear period: \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) seconds.\n   - Second gear period: \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds.\n\n   LCM of \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\):\n   LCM of numerators (9 and 4) is 36, GCD of denominators (5 and 3) is 1.
