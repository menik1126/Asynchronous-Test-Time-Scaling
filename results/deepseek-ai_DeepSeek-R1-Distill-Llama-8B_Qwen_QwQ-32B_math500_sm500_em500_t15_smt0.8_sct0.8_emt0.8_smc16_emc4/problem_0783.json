            "output": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the question is asking for the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). They mention that this distance can be expressed as \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers with \\( a \\) square-free, meaning it's not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I need to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the first thing I remember is that the distance from a point \\( (x, y) \\) to the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) is given by the distance formula, which is \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Since we're looking for the smallest distance, we need to minimize this expression.\n\nSo, let's write down the distance function. Since \\( y \\) is given in terms of \\( x \\), we can substitute \\( y \\) into the distance formula. That gives us:\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 } \\)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I should square both sides to make it easier. Because the square root can complicate things when taking derivatives. So, if I square the distance \\( D \\), it becomes:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\)\n\nSimplify that. Let's calculate the square term first. Squaring \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) gives \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). So, the squared term becomes \\( \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\). So, now the distance squared is:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \\)\n\nWait, let me expand that \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 \\) term properly. So, \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^"

Let me distribute the \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) across the parentheses:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nNow, let's combine the \\( x^2 \\) terms:\n\n\\( x^2 - 3x^2 = -2x^2 \\)\n\nSo now,\n\n\\( D^2 = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nHmm, okay. That looks manageable. Now, since \\( D^2 \\) is a function of \\( x \\), I can consider it as \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\). To find the minimum distance, I need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes \\( f(x) \\). Then, the minimal \\( D \\) will be the square root of that minimal \\( f(x) \\).\n\nTo find the minimum, I should take the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\), set it equal to zero, and solve for \\( x \\). That will give me the critical points which could be minima or maxima.\n\nSo, let's compute \\( f'(x) \\):\n\n\\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nTaking the derivative term by term:\n\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{1}{2}x^4 \\) is \\( 2x^3 \\), because \\( 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( -2x^2 \\) is \\( -4x \\).\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) is zero.\n\nSo, \\( f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \\)\n\nSet this equal to"

However, near the origin, it's going to behave similarly to a parabola.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is at \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) or \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\).
