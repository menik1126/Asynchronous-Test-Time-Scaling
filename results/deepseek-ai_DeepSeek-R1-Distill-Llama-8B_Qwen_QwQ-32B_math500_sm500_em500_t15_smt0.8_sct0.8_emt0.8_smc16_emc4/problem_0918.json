            "output": "To find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime components.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 84 by 2 to get 42, then continue factoring to obtain the prime factors: 2, 2, 3, and 7.\n\nSince we need distinct integers, I'll consider breaking down the factors further to form larger numbers while keeping the sum as low as possible.\n\nBy using the factors 2, 3, 7, and 2 again, I can form the integers 2, 3, 7, and 2. However, since the integers must be distinct, I'll replace one 2 with 14 and 2, but that's redundant. Instead, I'll look for a better combination.\n\nCombining 2 and 3 gives 6, and multiplying by 7 and 2 results in the integers 2, 6, 7. Their sum is 15. Checking the product: 2 × 6 × 7 equals 84, and all integers are distinct. Therefore, the least possible sum is 15.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nThe product of a set of distinct positive integers is 84. What is the least possible sum of these integers?\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Factorize 84 into its prime components.**  \n   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   So, the prime factors are \\(2, 2, 3, 7\\).\n\n2. **Identify the distinct prime factors.**  \n   To form distinct integers, we'll use each prime factor once.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Distinct prime factors} = 2, 3, 7\n   \\]\n   The remaining \\(2\\) can be combined with one of these factors to form a larger integer.\n\n3. **Combine a prime factor with the remaining 2 to minimize the sum.**  \n   - **Option 1:** Combine \\(2\\) with \\(3\\).  \n     \\[\n     3 \\times 2 = 6\n     \\]\n     The integers are \\(2, 3, 6, 7\\).  \n     - **Product:** \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 504\\) ("
