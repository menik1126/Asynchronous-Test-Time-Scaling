            "output": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a quadratic polynomial P(x) with real coefficients. The conditions given are that for all real numbers x, the polynomial satisfies the inequality x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3. Additionally, we know that P(11) = 181, and we need to find P(16).\n\nHmm, quadratic polynomials have the general form P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers. Since P(x) is sandwiched between two other quadratics, maybe I can express P(x) in terms of these bounds.\n\nLet me denote the lower bound as L(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and the upper bound as U(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3. So, for every x, L(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 U(x).\n\nOne thought is that P(x) might be equal to one of these quadratics, but since it's bounded by both, that can't be the case unless L(x) and U(x) are the same. But looking at L(x) and U(x), they are different. For example, at x = 1, L(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1, and U(1) = 2 - 4 + 3 = 1. Hmm, interesting, they are equal at x = 1. Maybe they touch at some points?\n\nWait, let me check if L(x) and U(x) are the same. Let's subtract them: U(x) - L(x) = (2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3) - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1. That simplifies to (x - 1)\u00b2. So, U(x) - L(x) = (x - 1)\u00b2, which is always non-negative, which makes sense because the inequality is L(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 U(x). So, the difference between U and L is a perfect square, which is zero only at x = 1.\n\nTherefore, at x = 1, both L(x) and U(x) are equal to 1, so P(1) must also be 1. That"

            "output": "'s a useful point.\n\nSince P(x) is a quadratic, the difference between P(x) and each of these bounds is a quadratic function. So, let's define Q(x) = P(x) - L(x). Then Q(x) is a quadratic, and since L(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 U(x), we have Q(x) \u2265 0 and Q(x) \u2264 U(x) - L(x) = (x - 1)\u00b2.\n\nSo, Q(x) is a quadratic that's non-negative for all x and has a maximum of (x - 1)\u00b2. Hmm, but how can we characterize Q(x)? Since Q(x) is non-negative everywhere, it must be a perfect square or have a non-negative discriminant if it's factored, but it's a quadratic, so Q(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2, but here a could be positive or negative.\n\nWait, but Q(x) is non-negative for all x, so its leading coefficient must be non-negative. Also, Q(x) has a maximum value at (x - 1)\u00b2, which is also a quadratic. So, maybe Q(x) is a multiple of (x - 1)\u00b2? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(x) can be written as L(x) + k(x - 1)\u00b2, where k is a constant. Because at x =1, P(1) is 1, which is the same as L(1). So, adding some multiple of (x -1)^2 would keep P(1) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, since P(x) must be less than or equal to U(x), which is equal to L(x) + (x - 1)^2, then k must be less than or equal to 1, because adding k(x - 1)^2 should not make P(x) exceed U(x). But wait, actually, at x=1, both L and U are 1, so P(1)=1. For other x, P(x) can be between L(x) and U(x). Therefore, Q(x) = P(x) - L(x) = k(x - 1)^2, where k is a constant between 0 and something.\n\nBut let me check. If Q(x) must be such that P(x) = L(x) + Q(x), and Q(x) \u2264 (x - "

Let me suppose that Q(x) = c(x -1)^2, where c is a constant between 0 and 1. Then P(x) = L(x) + c(x -1)^2.\n\nLet me see if that works. Let's compute P(x):\n\nL(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2,\n\nso P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 + c(x\u00b2 - 2x +1)\n\n= x\u00b2 -2x +2 + c x\u00b2 - 2c x + c\n\n= (1 + c)x\u00b2 + (-2 - 2c)x + (2 + c)\n\nHmm, so that's a quadratic. Now, since P(x) must also be less than or equal to U(x) = 2x\u00b2 -4x +3, let's see:\n\nP(x) = (1 + c)x\u00b2 + (-2 -2c)x + (2 + c) \u2264 2x\u00b2 -4x +3.\n\nSo, subtract P(x) from U(x):\n\nU(x) - P(x) = [2x\u00b2 -4x +3] - [(1 + c)x\u00b2 + (-2 -2c)x + (2 + c)]\n\n= (2 -1 -c)x\u00b2 + (-4 +2 +2c)x + (3 -2 -c)\n\n= (1 - c)x\u00b2 + (-2 + 2c)x + (1 - c)\n\nThis must be \u2265 0 for all x, since P(x) \u2264 U(x). Wait, but U(x) - P(x) must be non-negative for all x. So, the quadratic (1 - c)x\u00b2 + (-2 + 2c)x + (1 - c) must be non-negative for all x.\n\nSimilarly, since Q(x) = c(x -1)^2 must be non-negative, which it is as long as c is non-negative. So, c \u22650.\n\nNow, for the quadratic U(x) - P(x) to be non-negative for all x, it must be that the quadratic is always non-negative, so its leading coefficient must be non-negative, and its discriminant must be"

So, U(x) - P(x) is a perfect square, which is non-negative. So, since discriminant is zero, it's a perfect square.

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since U(x) - P(x) = (1 - c)(x -1)^2, which is non-negative for all x, so as long as 1 - c \u22650, which is c \u22641. Since we also have Q(x) = c(x -1)^2, which requires c \u22650, so c is between 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, P(x) can be written as L(x) + c(x -1)^2, where 0 \u2264 c \u22641.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic P(x) is parameterized by c. Now, we also know that P(11) = 181. Let's use this to find c.\n\nFirst, let's compute P(11):\n\nP(11) = L(11) + c*(11 -1)^2 = L(11) + c*(10)^2.\n\nCompute L(11):\n\nL(x) = x\u00b2 -2x +2,\n\nso L(11) = 11\u00b2 -2*11 +2 = 121 -22 +2 = 101.\n\nTherefore, P(11) = 101 + 100c = 181.\n\nSolving for c:\n\n100c = 181 -101 = 80 \u21d2 c = 80/100 = 0.8 = 4/5.\n\nSo c = 4/5, which is between 0 and 1, so that's valid.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = L(x) + (4/5)(x -1)^2.\n\nNow, let's write out P(x):\n\nFirst, L(x) = x\u00b2 -2x +2,\n\nand (x -1)^2 = x\u00b2 -2x +1,\n\nso P(x) = (x\u00b2 -2x +2) + (4/5)(x\u00b2 -2x +1)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2 -2x +2,\n\nSecond term: (4"
