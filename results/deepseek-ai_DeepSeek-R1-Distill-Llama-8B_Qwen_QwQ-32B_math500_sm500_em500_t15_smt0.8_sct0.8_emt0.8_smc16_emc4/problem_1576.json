            "output": "Alright, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of a fraction, where the numerator is (5 divided by the square root of 80) plus (square root of 845 over 9) plus the square root of 45, and all of that is divided by the square root of 5. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify each of these square roots individually. I remember that square roots can often be simplified by breaking them into factors, especially if there's a perfect square involved. So let's start with each term in the numerator.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 divided by the square root of 80. I can write that as 5 over sqrt(80). To simplify sqrt(80), I should factor it into a product that includes a perfect square. 80 can be broken down into 16 times 5, because 16 is a perfect square. So sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5), which is sqrt(16)*sqrt(5) = 4*sqrt(5). Therefore, 5 over sqrt(80) becomes 5/(4*sqrt(5)). \n\nWait, but 5/(4*sqrt(5)) can be simplified further. Maybe I can rationalize the denominator. To do that, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(5). So, that would give me (5*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(5)*sqrt(5)). The denominator becomes 4*(sqrt(5))^2, which is 4*5 = 20. So, 5*sqrt(5)/20 simplifies to sqrt(5)/4. Okay, that's better.\n\nNow, moving to the second term: sqrt(845) over 9. Let me see if sqrt(845) can be simplified. I know that 845 divided by 5 is 169, and 169 is 13 squared. So, 845 is 5*13^2. Therefore, sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*13^2) = sqrt(5)*13. So sqrt(845)/9 becomes (13*sqrt(5))/9. Got that.\n\nThird term in the numerator is sqrt(45). Let's simplify that. 45 is 9 times 5, and 9 is a perfect square. So sqrt(45"

            "output": ") is sqrt(9*5) = 3*sqrt(5). Cool, so that's 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo now, substituting back into the numerator: the sum of the first term, second term, and third term is sqrt(5)/4 + (13*sqrt(5))/9 + 3*sqrt(5). Let me write that as:\n\nsqrt(5)/4 + (13*sqrt(5))/9 + 3*sqrt(5).\n\nHmm, since all terms have sqrt(5), I can factor that out:\n\nsqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nNow, let me compute the fractions inside the parentheses. To add them up, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 is 3/1). The least common denominator (LCD) for 4 and 9 is 36. So I'll convert each fraction:\n\n1/4 is 9/36.\n\n13/9 is (13*4)/36 = 52/36.\n\n3/1 is 108/36.\n\nAdding them together: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = 169/36.\n\nSo the numerator becomes sqrt(5)*169/36.\n\nWait, 169 is 13 squared, but here it's multiplied by sqrt(5). So, numerator is 169*sqrt(5)/36.\n\nNow, the entire expression is sqrt( (169*sqrt(5)/36) ) divided by sqrt(5). So let me write that:\n\nsqrt( (169*sqrt(5)/36) / sqrt(5) ).\n\nWait, actually, no. The original expression is sqrt of [ (5/sqrt(80) + sqrt(845)/9 + sqrt(45)) / sqrt(5) ]\n\nSo after simplifying the numerator to 169*sqrt(5)/36, the entire expression inside the square root is that divided by sqrt(5), which is (169*sqrt(5)/36) / sqrt(5).\n\nLet me compute that division. Dividing by sqrt(5) is the same as multiplying by 1/sqrt(5). So:\n\n(169*sqrt(5)/36) * (1/sqrt(5)) = 169/(36*sqrt("

Wait no, actually, let me make sure.\n\nHold on, when you have (a*sqrt(b))/c divided by sqrt(b), that's equal to (a*sqrt(b))/(c*sqrt(b)) = a/c. So in this case, (169*sqrt(5)/36) divided by sqrt(5) is (169*sqrt(5))/(36*sqrt(5)).\n\nWhich simplifies to 169/36. So the expression inside the square root is 169/36.\n\nNow, I have sqrt(169/36). The square root of 169 is 13, and the square root of 36 is 6. So sqrt(169/36) is 13/6.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is 13/6.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Simplify 5/sqrt(80): sqrt(80)=4*sqrt(5), so 5/(4*sqrt(5))= sqrt(5)/4 after rationalizing.\n\n2. sqrt(845) = 13*sqrt(5), so sqrt(845)/9 =13*sqrt(5)/9.\n\n3. sqrt(45)=3*sqrt(5).\n\nAdding all terms: sqrt(5)/4 +13*sqrt(5)/9 +3*sqrt(5).\n\nFactor sqrt(5): sqrt(5)*(1/4 +13/9 +3).\n\nConvert to common denominator 36: 9/36 +52/36 +108/36 =169/36.\n\nSo numerator is 169*sqrt(5)/36.\n\nDivide by sqrt(5): (169*sqrt(5)/36)/sqrt(5)=169/36.\n\nSquare root of 169/36 is13/6.\n\nYep, looks correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified expression is \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{6}}.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression, we start by simplifying each term in the numerator individually.\n\n1.
