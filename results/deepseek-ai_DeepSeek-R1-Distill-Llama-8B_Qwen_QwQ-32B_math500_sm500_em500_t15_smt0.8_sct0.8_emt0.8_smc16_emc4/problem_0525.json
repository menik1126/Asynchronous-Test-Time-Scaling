            "output": "Okay, so I have to simplify the expression (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)). Hmm, I remember from algebra that when you have a fraction with a radical in the denominator, you can rationalize it by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate flips the sign between the terms, so in this case, the conjugate of (2 + sqrt(3)) is (2 - sqrt(3)). \n\nLet me write that down step by step. \n\nSo, the original expression is (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)). To rationalize, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by (2 - sqrt(3)):\n\n[(1 + sqrt(2)) * (2 - sqrt(3))] / [(2 + sqrt(3)) * (2 - sqrt(3))]\n\nNow, I need to multiply out both the numerator and the denominator. Let me start with the denominator because it's simpler—no radicals in the denominator anymore would be nice.\n\nMultiplying (2 + sqrt(3))(2 - sqrt(3)) is a difference of squares, so it's 2 squared minus (sqrt(3)) squared. That would be 4 - 3, which is 1. Okay, so the denominator simplifies to 1. That makes things easier.\n\nNow, the numerator is (1 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(3)). I'll use the distributive property to expand this. \n\nFirst, I'll distribute 1 over (2 - sqrt(3)): 1*2 is 2, and 1*(-sqrt(3)) is -sqrt(3). \n\nThen, I'll distribute sqrt(2) over (2 - sqrt(3)): sqrt(2)*2 is 2 sqrt(2), and sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(3)) is -sqrt(6).\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator is 2 - sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(6). \n\nNow, since the denominator is 1, the entire expression simplifies to just the numerator: 2 - sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(6).\n\nBut the problem asks to express the solution in the form A(1 + sqrt(B)) - (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)). Hmm, so I need to reorganize the terms to match that form"

            "output": ".\n\nLooking at my current expression: 2 + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(3) - sqrt(6). Let me see how to factor this.\n\nI can factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2*(1 + sqrt(2)). Then, the last two terms are -sqrt(3) - sqrt(6). So, now it's 2*(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)). \n\nWait, does that match the form they want? Let me check: A(1 + sqrt(B)) - (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)). Yes, exactly. So, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, and D is 6. \n\nTherefore, A + B + C + D is 2 + 2 + 3 + 6. Let me add those up: 2+2 is 4, 4+3 is 7, 7+6 is 13. So the answer is 13. \n\nBut to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again. \n\nStarting with (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)). Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(3)):\n\nNumerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-sqrt(3)) + (sqrt(2))(2) + (sqrt(2))(-sqrt(3)).\n\nWhich is 2 - sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(6). That's correct.\n\nDenominator: (2 + sqrt(3))(2 - sqrt(3)) = 4 - 3 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo numerator is as above. Then, the expression is 2 - sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(6), which can be written as 2*(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)).\n\nSo A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. Sum is 13. Okay, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)), multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (2 - sqrt(3)):\n\nNumerator: (1 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(3)) = 2 - sqrt(3) + "
