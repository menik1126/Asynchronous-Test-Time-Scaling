Dividing 98 by 2 again gives 49.\n\nNext, I'll factorize 49. Since 49 is 7 squared, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared and 7 squared.\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply these results, I calculate (2 + 1) times (2 + 1), which equals 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of a number, we can use the following method:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - Start by breaking down the number into its prime factors.\n   \n   For **196**:\n   \\[\n   196 \\div 2 = 98 \\\\\n   98 \\div 2 = 49 \\\\\n   49 \\div 7 = 7 \\\\\n   7 \\div 7 = 1\n   \\]\n   So, the prime factors of 196 are:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Divisors:**\n   - Use the formula for the number of divisors:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of divisors} = (e_1 + 1) \\times (e_2 + 1) \\times \\dots \\times (e_n + 1)\n     \\]\n     where \\( e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n \\) are the exponents of the prime factors.\n\n   For **196**:\n   \\[\n   e_1 = 2 \\quad (from\\ 2^2) \\\\\n   e_2 = 2 \\quad (from\\ 7^2)\n   \\]\n   Plugging into the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of divisors} = (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\"
