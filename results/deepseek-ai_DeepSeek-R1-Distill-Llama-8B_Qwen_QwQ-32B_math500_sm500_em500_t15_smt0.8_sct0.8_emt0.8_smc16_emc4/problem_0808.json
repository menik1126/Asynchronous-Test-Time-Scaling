The roots of this polynomial are distinct integers, and I know that \\( a_n = 2 \\) and \\( a_0 = 66 \\). My goal is to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, by the Integer Root Theorem, the possible roots are the divisors of the constant term \\( a_0 \\), which is 66. The divisors of 66 are \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66 \\). \n\nSince all the roots are distinct integers, the polynomial can be factored as \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), where each \\( r_i \\) is an integer divisor of 66.\n\nI need to consider the coefficients of the expanded polynomial, particularly \\( a_{n-1} \\), which is related to the sum of the roots. The coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) is equal to \\( -2(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n) \\). Therefore, my task is to find a set of distinct divisors of 66 that minimize the absolute value of \\( -2 \\) times their sum.\n\nSo, to minimize \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), I need to minimize \\( |2 \\times (\\text{sum of roots})| \\), which is the same as minimizing the absolute value of the sum of the roots.\n\nI should choose roots such that their sum is as close to zero as possible because that would make \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) smaller.\n\nLet me list all the divisors again: \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66 \\).\n\nTo get a sum close to zero, I should pair positive and negative divisors. However, since all the roots are distinct, I can't repeat any divisor.\n\n"

For instance, 66 and -66. But since all roots must be distinct, I can include at most one of each.\n\nWait, actually, let me think about how many roots the polynomial can have. Since \\( a_n = 2 \\), the leading coefficient, the degree \\( n \\) can be as low as 1, but since we have multiple roots, probably higher degree.\n\nBut I don't know the degree yet. The problem says the polynomial is monic if \\( a_n = 1 \\), but here it's \\( a_n = 2 \\). However, the roots are distinct, so the number of roots is equal to the degree, which is \\( n \\).\n\nSo my aim is to find a set of distinct divisors of 66, with as many pairs of positive and negative numbers as possible, such that their sum is minimized in absolute value.\n\nLet me try a few possibilities:\n\n1. Take the most balanced set of roots. For example, including both 1 and -1, 2 and -2, etc.\n\nBut considering that 66 is positive, including -66 and 66 would give a sum of zero, but that would require only two roots, which would make the polynomial a quadratic.\n\nBut if I take 66 and -66, then the polynomial would be \\( 2(x - 66)(x + 66) = 2x^2 - 2 \\times 132x + 2 \\times 4356 \\). Wait, let me compute that:\n\n\\( (x - 66)(x + 66) = x^2 - 66^2 = x^2 - 4356 \\). So, \\( 2(x^2 - 4356) = 2x^2 - 8712 \\). So, in this case, \\( a_{n-1} = 0 \\). That's perfect because the absolute value would be zero. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. So, if I take 66 and -66, that would make a quadratic with two roots, both integer, distinct, and coefficients integers. But hold on, \\( a_0 = 66 \\) as given, so in this"

Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is the product of the roots multiplied by \\( a_n \\times (-1)^n \\). \n\nWait, let me recall Vieta's formula. For a monic polynomial \\( (x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n) \\), the constant term is \\( (-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n \\). Since our polynomial is \\( 2(x - r_1)...(x - r_n) \\), the constant term is \\( 2 \\times (-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n \\). \n\nGiven that \\( a_0 = 66 \\), so:\n\n\\( 2 \\times (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 66 \\).\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots times \\( 2 \\times (-1)^n \\) must equal 66. \n\nWait, so in the case of the quadratic with roots 66 and -66, the product of the roots is (66)(-66) = -4356. Then, multiplied by 2 (since \\( a_n = 2 \\)) and \\( (-1)^2 = 1 \\), so total constant term is 2*(-4356) = -8712, which is not 66. So that's a problem. \n\nAh, so my mistake earlier was not considering the constant term. The problem states that \\( a_0 = 66 \\), so the product of the roots (times 2*(-1)^n) must be 66. Therefore, the product of the roots must be 66 divided by (2*(-1)^n). Since 66 is positive, and 2 is positive, so the product of the roots times (-1)^n must be 33. \n\nWait, let me write that again:\n\n\\( 2 \\times (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 66 \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 33 \\"
