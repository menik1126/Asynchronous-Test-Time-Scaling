A plane is cutting through it, parallel to edges \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\), and it's positioned halfway between them. We need to find the surface area of one of the resulting pieces.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a regular tetrahedron is. A regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal in length, so each edge is 2 units long in this case.\n\nNow, the problem mentions a plane that's parallel to edges \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\). That's interesting because in a tetrahedron, edges \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) don't lie on the same face. In fact, in a regular tetrahedron, each pair of opposite edges (like \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\)) are skew lines, meaning they don't intersect and aren't parallel. So, a plane parallel to both \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) would have to be positioned in such a way that it maintains that parallelism.\n\nAdditionally, the plane is lying halfway between edges \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\). So, we need to figure out where exactly this halfway point is in terms of distance along the line segment that connects these two edges. But wait, in a tetrahedron, edges \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) are skew, so they don't lie on the same line. Therefore, the distance between these two edges isn't straightforward. Hmm, this might be a bit tricky.\n\nPerhaps it's useful to assign coordinates to the vertices of the tetrahedron to make things more concrete. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet's place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system. For simplicity, I can place vertex \\(A\\) at \\((0, 0, 0)\\), vertex \\(B\\) at \\((2, 0, 0)\\), vertex \\(C\\) somewhere in the \\(xy\\)-plane, and vertex \\(D\\) above the \\(xy\\)-plane.\n\nBut wait, in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are of equal length. So, the distances between any two vertices should be equal to 2. Let me make sure I assign coordinates correctly.\n\nI remember that one way to place a regular tetrah"

Therefore, the smaller portion (near AB) will have parts of faces ABC and ABD, and the new face (the parallelogram).

So, each piece will have parts of some original faces and the new face.\n\nBut according to the earlier analysis, the plane intersects edges AC, BC, AD, BD, which belong to faces ABC and ABD. So, faces ABC and ABD are intersected by the plane, while faces ACD and BCD are not.
