            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where \u03c9 is a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, then \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1. So, \u03c9 can be either of the non-real cube roots of 1.\n\nI also recall that the cube roots of unity satisfy the equation \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, which can be factored as (\u03c9 - 1)(\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1) = 0. Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it must satisfy the quadratic equation \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0. That means \u03c9\u00b2 = -\u03c9 - 1. Maybe I can use this later on.\n\nLooking at the expression I need to evaluate: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Since \u03c9\u00b2 is another root, perhaps I can express this in terms of \u03c9.\n\nLet me compute each term separately. Starting with the first term, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\). Maybe I can rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by something. For the cube roots, sometimes multiplying by conjugate helps.\n\nI remember that for complex numbers, \\(1 + \\omega\\) and \\(1 + \\omega\u00b2\\) might have some relationships. Let's see what \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega\u00b2\\) is equal to. From the equation \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0, we know that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. So, that sum is zero.\n\nHmm, so if I take \\(1 + \\omega\\) and multiply it by \\(1 + \u03c9\u00b2\\), maybe? Let's try that:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega\u00b2) = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\omega\u00b2 + \\omega \\cdot 1 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega\u00b2\n\\]\nSimplify each term:\n\n1*1 = 1\n\n1*\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9*1 = \u03c9\n\n\u03c9*\u03c9\u00b2"

So,\n\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\nTherefore, (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1\n\nThat's useful! So, maybe I can use this in simplifying the expression.\n\nNow, let's get back to the original expression:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\)\n\nI can combine these two fractions. The common denominator would be (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2), which we just found is equal to 1.\n\nSo, let me write it as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nThe denominator is 1, as we found earlier. So, the numerator is:\n\n(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 + \u03c9 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2\n\nAgain, using the fact that \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 = -1, so numerator becomes:\n\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1}\\) = 1\n\nWait, but hold on. Is this the only value?\n\nWait, \u03c9 can be either \u03c9 or \u03c9\u00b2, right? But from the expression, regardless of which root we choose, the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\) evaluates to 1. Because in both cases, \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2 are just conjugates of each other, so swapping them doesn't change the sum.\n\nLet me verify with an example. Let's take \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) which is equal to -1/2 + i\u221a3/2. Then \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = -1"

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n2 / (1 - i\u221a3) = 2*(1 + i\u221a3)/4 = (1 + i\u221a3)/2\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(1 - i\u221a3)/2 + (1 + i\u221a3)/2 = (1 + 1)/2 + (-i\u221a3 + i\u221a3)/2 = 2/2 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo yes, it does compute to 1 when \u03c9 is the non-real cube root. What about \u03c9 = 1?\n\nIf \u03c9 = 1, then expression becomes:\n\n1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\n\nSo, even when \u03c9 = 1, the expression equals 1. Therefore, in both cases, whether \u03c9 is 1 or a primitive cube root, the expression evaluates to 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of the expression is 1.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 1.\n</think>\n\nThe value of the expression is always 1, regardless of which cube root of unity \u03c9 is chosen.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
