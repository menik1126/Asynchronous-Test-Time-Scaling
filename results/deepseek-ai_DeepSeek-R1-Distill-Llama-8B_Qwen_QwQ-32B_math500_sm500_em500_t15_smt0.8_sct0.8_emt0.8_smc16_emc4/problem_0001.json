            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about polynomials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I know it's a bit challenging, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, the problem states that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So I can write P(x) as x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nNow, it says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we're given that P(0) = 5, and we need to find P(5).\n\nLet me recall the Remainder Theorem. If a polynomial P(x) is divided by a linear divisor (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But here, we're dealing with quadratic divisors, so I think I need to use the polynomial remainder theorem for quadratic divisors.\n\nFor a quadratic divisor (x - m)(x - n), the remainder of P(x) divided by it will be a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) should be in the form mx + n.\n\nSo, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder R(x) is equal to P(1) and also equal to P(4) by the remainder theorem. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for quadratic divisors, the remainder is a linear polynomial, but evaluating P(1) and P(4) gives me a system of equations to find the coefficients of R(x). Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me note that R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4). So R(x) must satisfy R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4), since when you plug in x = 1 and x = 4 into P(x), the division by (x - 1)(x - 4) would leave only R(1) and R(4).\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - "

            "output": "3), the remainder is 2R(x). So that remainder, let's call it S(x) = 2R(x), must satisfy S(2) = P(2) and S(3) = P(3). But since S(x) is 2R(x), then 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3).\n\nTherefore, I can set up equations based on these evaluations.\n\nLet me denote R(x) as a linear polynomial: R(x) = dx + e. Then, since R(x) is the remainder when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is a quadratic, R(x) must be of degree less than 2, so linear is correct.\n\nSo, R(1) = d(1) + e = d + e = P(1)\n\nR(4) = d(4) + e = 4d + e = P(4)\n\nSimilarly, the remainder when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3) is 2R(x) = 2dx + 2e. Therefore,\n\n2R(2) = 2*(2d + e) = 4d + 2e = P(2)\n\n2R(3) = 2*(3d + e) = 6d + 2e = P(3)\n\nSo now, I have expressions for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) in terms of d and e. But since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, maybe I can use these equations to set up a system?\n\nAlternatively, since P(x) is a cubic, perhaps I can express it in terms of the divisors. Let me think.\n\nLet me recall that when dividing a polynomial P(x) by a divisor D(x), we can write P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x), where the degree of R(x) is less than the degree of D(x). So here, when dividing by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is quadratic, the remainder R(x) is linear. Similarly, when dividing by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), which is also linear (since R(x) is linear, so 2R(x) is linear as well).\n\nTherefore, we can"

Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since P(1) = R(1) and P(4) = R(4), let me compute P(1) and P(4) in terms of the coefficients of P(x). Similarly, I can compute P(2) and P(3), which are equal to 2R(2) and 2R(3). So let's note that.\n\nGiven that P(x) is a cubic polynomial: P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c.
