            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem about polynomials. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so the polynomial looks like P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants we need to find.\n\nWe're told that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we're given that P(0) = 5. The goal is to find P(5).\n\nOkay, so let me recall the Remainder Theorem. The remainder when a polynomial P(x) is divided by a linear divisor (x - k) is just P(k). But here, the divisors are quadratic, so we need to use polynomial division or the generalized version of the Remainder Theorem.\n\nI think the key here is to express P(x) in terms of these divisors. Since P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), let me write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4) * Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), we have:\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3) * Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nWhere Q1(x) and Q2(x) are the quotients, and R(x) is the remainder in both cases. So R(x) is a polynomial of degree less than 2, meaning it's linear: R(x) = mx + n.\n\nGiven that P(0) = 5, let's plug x = 0 into the first equation:\n\nP(0) = (0 - 1)(0 - 4) * Q1(0) + R(0) = 5\n\nCalculating (0 - 1)(0 - 4) = (-1)(-4) = 4, so:\n\n4 * Q1(0) + R(0) = 5\n\nSimilarly, since P(0) = 5,"

Let's also note that since P is monic cubic, the leading term is x\u00b3, so when divided by a quadratic, the quotient will be linear, right?\n\nSo Q1(x) is a linear polynomial: Q1(x) = dx + e.\n\nSimilarly, Q2(x) is also linear: Q2(x) = fx + g.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to find Q1 and Q2 explicitly.\n\nSince R(x) is the remainder when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, since the remainder when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3) is 2R(x), that means 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3).\n\nSo let's write down those equations:\n\nFrom the first division:\nR(1) = P(1)\nR(4) = P(4)\n\nFrom the second division:\n2R(2) = P(2)\n2R(3) = P(3)\n\nAnd since R(x) is linear: R(x) = mx + n.\n\nSo now, let's write expressions for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), and P(0).\n\nBut we also know P(0) = 5.\n\nSo let's set up a system of equations. Let's write down each P(k) in terms of R(k) or 2R(k).\n\nFirst, P(1) = R(1) = m*1 + n = m + n.\n\nSimilarly, P(4) = R(4) = 4m + n.\n\nP(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(2m + n) = 4m + 2n.\n\nP(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(3m + n) = 6m + 2n.\n\nAnd P(0) = c = 5.\n\nSo now we have five equations:\n\n1.
