There are 1,000 meters in a kilometer and 3,600 seconds in 2.5 hours.\n\nSo, its speed is 1,000 meters divided by 3,600 seconds, which equals approximately 0.2778 meters per second.\n\nNext, I'll use this speed to find the hallway's length. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway.\n\nBy multiplying the speed of 0.2778 meters per second by 90 seconds, I find that the hallway is approximately 25 meters long.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n- The robot travels the hallway in 90 seconds.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Robot's Speed**\n\nFirst, let's find the robot's speed in meters per second.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}}\n\\]\n\nConvert the distance to meters and the time to seconds:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ km} = 1000 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\\[\n2.5 \\text{ hours} = 2.5 \\times 3600 \\text{ seconds} = 9000 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} \\approx 0.1111 \\text{ meters/second}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Length of the Hallway**\n\nUsing the speed calculated above, find the length of the hallway in meters.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of Hallway} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 0.1111 \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ s} \\approx 10 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"
