            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer. It's x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, so I need to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. \n\nFirst off, since there's a square root in there, I remember that the expression inside the square root has to be non-negative. That means 11 - 2x must be greater than or equal to zero. Let me note that down: 11 - 2x ≥ 0. Solving for x, I can add 2x to both sides to get 11 ≥ 2x, and then divide both sides by 2, so x ≤ 11/2. That's 5.5. So, whatever solutions I get, they have to be less than or equal to 5.5. Got it.\n\nNow, the equation is x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. I think the standard way to solve equations with square roots is to isolate the square root and then square both sides to eliminate it. Let me try that approach here. \n\nSo, first step: let me subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the square root. That gives me x - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x). Okay, so now the square root is by itself on one side. \n\nThe next step is to square both sides to get rid of the square root. Squaring the left side: (x - 4)^2. And squaring the right side: (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2, which simplifies to 11 - 2x. So now my equation is (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x.\n\nLet me expand the left side. (x - 4)^2 is x^2 - 8x + 16. So substituting that in, the equation becomes x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x. \n\nHmm, now I need to bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let me subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides. That gives me x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0. Simplifying the constants"

            "output": " and combining like terms: x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0.\n\nWait, let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. After expanding (x - 4)^2, I get x² - 8x + 16, correct. Then, moving everything to the left: subtract 11 and add 2x. So, x² -8x +16 -11 +2x. Combine x terms: (-8x +2x) is -6x. Constants: 16 -11 is 5. So yes, equation is x² -6x +5 = 0. \n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add to -6. Hmm, factors of 5 are 1 and 5. 1 and 5 add up to 6. Since both middle terms are negative, the factors should both be negative. So, (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are x = 5 and x = 1.\n\nBut wait a second, I can't just accept these solutions without checking because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions. So, I need to plug them back into the original equation to verify.\n\nFirst, let me check x = 5. Plugging into the original equation: sqrt(11 - 2(5)) + 4. That's sqrt(11 - 10) +4, which is sqrt(1) +4. sqrt(1) is 1, so 1 +4 is 5. Which equals x. So, x=5 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, x=1. Plugging in: sqrt(11 -2(1)) +4. That's sqrt(11 -2) +4, which is sqrt(9) +4. sqrt(9) is 3, so 3 +4 is 7. But wait, x is 1, and 7 is not equal to 1. So, this doesn't satisfy the original equation. Therefore, x=1 is an extraneous solution and should be discarded.\n\nHmm, so that leaves only x=5 as the valid solution. Let me recap to ensure I haven't missed anything. \n\nI started with the equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x"

            "output": ") +4. Isolated the square root, squared both sides, solved the quadratic, got two solutions, checked them, and only x=5 works. \n\nWait, but let me also check the domain condition. Earlier, I found that x must be ≤5.5. Since 5 is less than 5.5, that's okay. And x=1 is also less than 5.5, but it didn't work. So, that's why it's important to check solutions even if they meet the domain condition. \n\nIs there any other possible solution? Let me see. The quadratic equation only had two roots, so unless I made a mistake in forming the quadratic, those are the only candidates. Let me double-check the algebra steps again.\n\nOriginal equation: x = sqrt(11 -2x) +4. Subtract 4: x -4 = sqrt(11 -2x). Square both sides: (x-4)^2 = 11 -2x. Expand left side: x² -8x +16 =11 -2x. Bring all terms to left: x² -8x +16 -11 +2x = x² -6x +5 =0. Factored as (x-5)(x-1)=0. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x=5. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way this could have gone wrong. For instance, when I squared both sides, could there be another solution introduced? Well, squaring can sometimes create solutions that don't satisfy the original equation because the square of a negative is positive, but in this case, the square root function itself is always non-negative, so the right side sqrt(...) is non-negative, so the left side after isolation (x -4) must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, that's an important point. When I had x -4 = sqrt(11 -2x), the right side is a square root, which is always non-negative, so the left side must also be non-negative. Therefore, x -4 ≥0 → x ≥4. \n\nAh! That's another constraint I didn't consider earlier. So, even before checking the solutions, we can note that x must be ≥4. Because the square root is non-negative, so x -4 must be ≥0."

            "output": " \n\nSo, that means that any solution must satisfy x ≥4. Therefore, when we found x=5 and x=1, x=1 is less than 4, so it's automatically outside the domain, even before plugging in. So, that's another reason why x=1 is not a solution. \n\nTherefore, that process reinforces that x=1 is not a valid solution, leaving only x=5. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Recognize that square root implies the expression inside is non-negative, leading to x ≤5.5.\n\n2. Isolate the square root and realize that x -4 must also be non-negative, so x ≥4. Thus, x must be between 4 and 5.5.\n\n3. Solve the quadratic equation, get x=5 and x=1. x=1 is less than 4, so it can't be a solution. x=5 is within the 4 ≤x ≤5.5 range, and when plugging back in, it works.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nI think that wraps it up.
