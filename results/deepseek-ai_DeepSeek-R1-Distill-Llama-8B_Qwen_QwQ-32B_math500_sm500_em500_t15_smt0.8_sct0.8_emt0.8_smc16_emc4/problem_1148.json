Then, I have to find the value of \\(AB + B\\). Hmm, factoring quadratics, right? Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that when factoring a quadratic of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\), I need to find two binomials that multiply to give the original quadratic. The method I learned was the \"ac method,\" where you multiply the coefficients of the first and last terms, which are \\(a\\) and \\(c\\), to find a starting point for the factors.\n\nIn this case, the quadratic is \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\), so \\(a = 10\\), \\(b = -1\\), and \\(c = -24\\). Let me try the ac method. Multiplying 10 and -24 gives me \\(10 * (-24) = -240\\). Hmm, so I need two numbers that multiply to -240 and add up to the coefficient of the middle term, which is -1.\n\nWait, so I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -240 and add up to -1. Since their product is negative, one must be positive and the other negative. Let me think about the factors of 240. 240 is 16 * 15, 16 * 15. Wait, but 16 and 15 add up to 31, which is way higher than 1. Maybe I need to find smaller factors.\n\nLet me see: 240 divided by 10 is 24, so 10 and 24. 10 * 24 is 240, but we need them to add up to -1. So, maybe 15 and 16? No, same as before. Wait, maybe 20 and 12. 20 * 12 is 240, and 20 - 12 is 8. Hmm, that's positive 8. If I take 20 and -12, that would give me a sum of 8. But I need a sum of -1. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out all the possible pairs of factors of 240 and"

Let me try that.\n\nFactors of 240 (positive):\n\n1 and 240,\n\n2 and 120,\n\n3 and 80,\n\n4 and 60,\n\n5 and 48,\n\n6 and 40,\n\n8 and 30,\n\n10 and 24,\n\n12 and 20,\n\n15 and 16.\n\nNow, since the product is -240, one of the numbers has to be negative. Let me see which pair can have a difference of 1 when one is negative. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the two numbers are m and n, such that m * n = -240 and m + n = -1.\n\nLet me think of possible pairs where one is positive and the other is negative. Let me try 15 and -16. 15 + (-16) = -1. And 15 * (-16) = -240. Oh! That works! So the numbers are 15 and -16.\n\nWait, so that's the key. So then, using the ac method, I can split the middle term using these numbers. Let me try that.\n\nOriginal quadratic: \\(10x^2 - x -24\\).\n\nSplit the middle term (-x) into 15x -16x. So:\n\n\\(10x^2 +15x -16x -24\\).\n\nNow, group the first two terms and the last two terms:\n\n(10x^2 +15x) + (-16x -24).\n\nFactor out the greatest common factors (GCF) from each group:\n\nFrom the first group, 5x is the GCF of 10x^2 and 15x, so 5x(2x + 3).\n\nFrom the second group, the GCF of -16x and -24 is -8, so -8(2x + 3).\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n5x(2x + 3) -8(2x + 3).\n\nNow, factor out the common binomial factor (2x + 3):\n\n(2x + 3)(5x -8).\n\nWait, so that's the factored form. Let me check if that's correct"

So the factoring is correct.\n\nBut in the problem, it's given as (Ax -8)(Bx +3). Let me compare with what I have: (2x +3)(5x -8). So if I write it as (5x -8)(2x +3), that would be (Ax -8)(Bx +3), so A is 5 and B is 2.\n\nSo, A =5, B=2. Then, AB + B = (5)(2) + (2) = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait a minute. But let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, if I write it as (2x +3)(5x -8), that's the same thing. Alternatively, if I factor differently, but in this case, it seems correct.\n\nLet me make sure that (2x +3)(5x -8) is indeed the same as the original quadratic. I did the multiplication earlier, and it worked out. So the factoring is correct.\n\nSo, A is 5, B is 2. Then, AB + B is 5*2 +2 =10 +2 =12.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake with the signs here. Because sometimes, when you factor, the signs can be tricky. So, let me confirm.\n\nThe original quadratic is \\(10x^2 -x -24\\). The factored form is (2x +3)(5x -8). Let me expand that again:\n\n2x*5x=10x\u00b2,\n\n2x*(-8)= -16x,\n\n3*5x=15x,\n\n3*(-8)= -24.\n\nAdding the terms: 10x\u00b2 + (-16x+15x) + (-24) \u2192 10x\u00b2 -x -24.

That seems straightforward, but maybe there's another way of approaching this problem since the problem states that it can be written as (Ax -8)(Bx +3). Let me see if there's another possible pair of factors where the constants are fixed as -8 and +3. Because perhaps that's the key here.\n\nWait, in the problem, the question specifies that the expression can be written as (Ax -8)(Bx +3), so the constants are given as -8 and +3. Therefore, the factors must be in that form. So perhaps my previous method arrived at the same answer, but maybe I need to approach it by expanding the given form and then equate coefficients?\n\nYes, maybe that's another way to approach the problem. Let me try that.\n\nLet me let the expression be equal to (Ax -8)(Bx +3). Then, when I expand this, I should get 10x\u00b2 -x -24. Let me expand it step by step:\n\n(Ax)(Bx) = ABx\u00b2,\n\n(Ax)(3) = 3Ax,\n\n(-8)(Bx) = -8Bx,\n\n(-8)(3) = -24.\n\nSo, combining like terms, the expanded form is ABx\u00b2 + (3A -8B)x -24.\n\nThis must equal the original quadratic 10x\u00b2 -x -24. Therefore, we can equate coefficients:\n\n1. The coefficient of x\u00b2: AB = 10,\n\n2. The coefficient of x: 3A -8B = -1,\n\n3. The constant term: -24, which matches, so that's okay.\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\nAB = 10,\n\nand\n\n3A -8B = -1.\n\nWe need to solve for integers A and B. Since A and B are integers, we can look for integer solutions to these equations.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: A * B = 10,\n\nEquation 2: 3A -8B = -1.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations"

            "output": ". Let me try to express A in terms of B from Equation 1, and substitute into Equation 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1: A = 10 / B. Since A and B are integers, B must be a divisor of 10.\n\nSo possible integer values for B are the divisors of 10: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110.\n\nLet me list possible B and then compute A = 10/B, check if it's integer, and see if Equation 2 holds.\n\nCase 1: B=1 \u2192 A=10/1=10. Then, check Equation 2: 3*10 -8*1 = 30 -8=22. But Equation 2 requires 22=-1, which is false. So B=1 is invalid.\n\nCase 2: B=-1 \u2192 A=10/(-1)=-10. Equation 2: 3*(-10) -8*(-1)= -30 +8=-22. Not equal to -1. So invalid.\n\nCase 3: B=2 \u2192 A=10/2=5. Equation 2: 3*5 -8*2=15 -16=-1. That works! So A=5, B=2.\n\nCase 4: B=-2 \u2192 A=10/(-2)=-5. Equation 2: 3*(-5) -8*(-2)=-15 +16=1. Not equal to -1. So invalid.\n\nCase 5: B=5 \u2192 A=10/5=2. Equation 2: 3*2 -8*5=6 -40=-34\u2260-1. So invalid.\n\nCase 6: B=-5 \u2192 A=10/(-5)=-2. Equation 2: 3*(-2) -8*(-5)=-6 +40=34\u2260-1. So invalid.\n\nCase 7: B=10 \u2192 A=10/10=1. Equation 2: 3*1 -8*10=3-80=-77\u2260-1. Invalid.\n\nCase 8: B=-10 \u2192 A=10/(-10)=-1. Equation 2: 3*(-1) -8*(-10)=-3 +80=77\u2260-1.

Good.\n\nAnother way I can think of is perhaps trial and error with the possible constants given, since the problem specifies the constants as -8 and +3, I can try plugging in values for x to find A and B.\n\nWait, maybe using the roots method could be another approach. Since the quadratic is 10x^2 -x -24=0, I can find the roots and then express it in factored form.\n\nLet me try that quickly. The quadratic is 10x\u00b2 -x -24=0. Using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 960)] / 20.\n\nBecause discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-1)^2 -4*10*(-24)=1 +960=961.\n\nsqrt(961)=31.\n\nSo, roots are (1 +31)/20=32/20=8/5 and (1 -31)/20=-30/20=-3/2.\n\nSo, the roots are x=8/5 and x=-3/2.\n\nNow, since the quadratic can be written as (Ax -8)(Bx +3), let's think about how the roots relate to the factors.\n\nFrom the factored form (Ax -8)(Bx +3), the roots are x=8/A and x=-3/B.\n\nWait, because if (Ax -8)=0, then x=8/A; and if (Bx +3)=0, then x=-3/B.\n\nBut from the quadratic equation, we found the roots are x=8/5 and x=-3/2.\n\nSo, setting x=8/A=8/5, so 8/A=8/5, which implies A=5.\n\nSimilarly, x=-3/B=-3/2, which implies B=2.\n\nTherefore, A=5, B=2, which gives AB + B=5*2 +2=12.\n\nHmm, that's another way to see it."
