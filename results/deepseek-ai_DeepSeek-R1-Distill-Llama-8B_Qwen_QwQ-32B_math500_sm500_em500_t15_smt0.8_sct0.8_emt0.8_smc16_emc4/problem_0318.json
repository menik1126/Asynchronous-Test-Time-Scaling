            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the sum of the vertical asymptotes a and b, and the horizontal asymptote c of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² -5x -14), and then add them all together. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator isn't also zero there, which would make it a hole instead. So I need to factor the denominator and find its roots. The denominator is x² -5x -14. Let me try factoring that. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see... 2 and -7 multiply to -14, and 2 + (-7) is -5. So, yes, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I recall that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator here is 1 (since it's 2x), and the denominator is degree 2. The rule is that if the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients. Here, since the numerator's degree is less, the horizontal asymptote should be y = 0. So, c = 0.\n\nNow, adding them up: a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0. Let me calculate that: -2 +7 is 5, and 5 +0 is 5. So the total should be 5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Factoring the denominator: x² -5x -14. Discriminant is 25 + 56 =81, square root of 81 is 9. So roots are (5 ±9)/2. That's (14)/2=7 and (-4)/2=-2. Yep, that's correct. So vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x=7.\n\n"

I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe function f(x) has vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x = 7, and a horizontal asymptote at y = 0. Therefore, a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5.\n\n\\boxed{5}"
