            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). Hmm, distance from the origin to a point (x, y) is given by the formula \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Since we're dealing with a function y in terms of x, maybe I can express the distance in terms of x and then find its minimum.\n\nLet me write down the distance squared because minimizing the square will give the same result as minimizing the actual distance, and it might be easier to handle without the square root. So, the distance squared, let's call it D, is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. Substituting y from the given function, that becomes x\u00b2 + [(1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)]\u00b2. I can simplify this expression step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the square in the y term: [(1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)]\u00b2 = (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2. So, now the distance squared D is x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2. Let me expand (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2: that's x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9. So, substituting back, D = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9).\n\nDistribute the 1/2: D = x\u00b2 + (1/2)x\u2074 - 3x\u00b2 + (9/2). Combine like terms: x\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2 is -2x\u00b2, so D = (1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nNow, to find the minimum, I need to take the derivative of D with respect to x and set it equal to zero. So, D = (1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2. Taking the derivative: dD/dx = 2x\u00b3 - 4x.\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero for critical points: 2x\u00b3 - 4x = 0. Factor out 2x: 2x(x\u00b2 - 2) = 0. So, the solutions are x = 0 or x\u00b2 = 2, meaning x = \u00b1\u221a2.\n\nNow, I need"

            "output": " to evaluate D at these critical points to find which gives the minimum. Also, I should check if these are minima or maxima by using the second derivative test.\n\nFirst, let's compute D at x = 0: D(0) = (1/2)(0)\u2074 - 2(0)\u00b2 + 9/2 = 9/2 = 4.5.\n\nNext, at x = \u221a2: D(\u221a2) = (1/2)(\u221a2)^4 - 2*(\u221a2)^2 + 9/2.\n\nLet's break it down. (\u221a2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4, so (1/2)*4 = 2. (\u221a2)^2 = 2, so 2*2 = 4. Plugging in, D(\u221a2) = 2 - 4 + 9/2 = (-2) + 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nSimilarly, at x = -\u221a2, the value will be the same because the function D is even in x. So D(-\u221a2) = D(\u221a2) = 2.5.\n\nNow, compare this to D(0) = 4.5. So, 2.5 is smaller, so the minimum distance squared is 2.5, which is 5/2. Therefore, the minimum distance is \u221a(5/2) which can be rewritten as (\u221a10)/2. So, a = 10 and b = 2. Therefore, a + b = 12.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from D = (1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nAt x = \u221a2: x\u00b2 = 2, x\u2074 = 4. So, (1/2)*4 = 2, 2x\u00b2 = 4, so 2 - 4 + 4.5 = 2.5. Yes, that's correct. So the square of the minimum distance is 5/2, so the distance is \u221a(5/2) = \u221a10 / 2, which is in the form \u221aa / b with a = 10 and b = 2. Therefore, a + b is 12.\n\nYeah, I think that's"

            "output": " correct. Let me also check the second derivative to confirm that x = \u221a2 is indeed a minimum. The second derivative of D is the derivative of dD/dx, which is 2x\u00b3 -4x. The second derivative is 6x\u00b2 -4. Plugging in x = \u221a2, we get 6*(2) -4 = 12 -4 = 8, which is positive, so it is indeed a local minimum. Similarly, at x =0, the second derivative is 6*0 -4 = -4, which is negative, so that's a local maximum. So that's consistent with our previous conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2) which is sqrt(10)/2, so a is 10 and b is 2, so 10 +2 =12.
