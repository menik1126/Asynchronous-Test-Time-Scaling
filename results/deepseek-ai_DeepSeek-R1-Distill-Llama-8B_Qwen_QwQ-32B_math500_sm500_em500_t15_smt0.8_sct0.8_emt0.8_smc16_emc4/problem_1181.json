Hmm, the coefficients seem to have some pattern. The coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. That looks a bit like a binomial expansion, maybe of \\( (z + i)^4 \\) or something similar.\n\nLet me compute \\( (z + i)^4 \\) and see if it matches.

Wait, but rotation doesn't change area, translation doesn't either. So the area would be the same as the area of the square in the \\(w\\)-plane.\n\nWait, in the \\(w\\)-plane, the roots are on a circle of radius \\(2^{1/8}\\), so the square inscribed in that circle would have side length \\( s = 2^{1/8} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\), since the diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle. Wait, the diagonal of the square is \\(2 \\times 2^{1/8} = 2^{1 + 1/8} = 2^{9/8}\\). Therefore, the side length is \\( (2^{9/8}) / \\sqrt{2} ) = 2^{9/8 - 1/2} = 2^{5/8} \\). Then the area would be \\( (2^{5/8})^2 / 2 = 2^{5/4} / 2 = 2^{1/4} \\). Wait, maybe I need to recast that.\n\nWait, actually, the area of a square with diagonal \\(d\\) is \\(d^2 / 2\\). So if the diagonal is \\(2 \\times 2^{1/8} = 2^{9/8}\\), then the area is \\( (2^{9/8})^2 / 2 = 2^{9/4} / 2 = 2^{5/4} \\). So the area in the \\(w\\)-plane is \\(2^{5/4}\\). Then, since the transformation from \\(w\\) to \\(z\\) is a rotation and scaling by 1 (since multiplying by \\(i\\) is rotation, no scaling), the area remains the same. Wait, but actually, the transformation is \\( z = i w \\), which is a rotation by 90\u00b0, which preserves area. So the area in the \\(z\\)-plane is also \\(2^{5/4}\\).

So, the four roots \\(w\\) lie on a circle of radius \\(2^{1/8}\\) around \\(w = -1\\), forming a square. When we apply the transformation \\( z =i w \\), this is a rotation by 90\u00b0, which preserves the shape and area, just rotating it. The shift by \\(-i\\) (i.e., translating all points down by \\(i\\)) doesn't affect the area either. Therefore, the area remains the same as that of the square in the \\(w\\)-plane, which is \\(2^{5/4}\\).\n\nTherefore, the area is \\(2^{5/4} = 2^{5/4}\\), so \\( p=2 \\), \\(a=5\\), \\(b=4\\), so \\(a + b + p=5+4+2=11\\).\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again.

The four roots form a square centered at \\(w = -1\\), each at distance \\(2^{1/8}\\) from the center, so the diagonal of the square is \\( 2 \\times 2^{1/8} = 2^{9/8} \\). The area of the square is \\( (diagonal^2)/2 = (2^{9/8})^2 /2 = 2^{9/4} /2 = 2^{5/4} \\). So the area is indeed \\(2^{5/4}\\).\n\nSince this is the area of the square in the \\(w\\)-plane, and under rotation and translation, the area remains \\(2^{5/4}\\) in"

Let me think of coordinates.\n\nSuppose in the \\(w\\)-plane, the center is at \\(w = -1\\), and the four roots are at points \\( -1 + 2^{1/8} e^{i (\\pi/16 + \\pi k/2)} \\), for \\(k=0,1,2,3\\). The distance between adjacent points would be the side length of the square. The distance between two adjacent roots would be \\(2^{1/8} \\times \\sqrt{2}\\), since in a square, the side length is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times r \\), where \\(r\\) is the distance from center to vertex? Wait, no, actually, in a square, the distance from center to vertex is \\( s \\sqrt{2}/2 \\), where \\(s\\) is the side length. So if the distance from center to vertex is \\(2^{1/8}\\), then the side length is \\( s = 2^{1/8} \\times \\sqrt{2} \\). Therefore, the area is \\( s^2 = (2^{1/8} \\times \\sqrt{2})^2 = 2^{1/4} \\times 2 = 2^{5/4} \\). So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the area is indeed \\(2^{5/4}\\), so the answer is 5 +4 +2=11.\n\nWait, but let me check if the polygon is actually a square. Since the roots are equally spaced on a circle, they form a square. So when rotated and translated, it's still a square, so the area is preserved. So I think this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution steps.
