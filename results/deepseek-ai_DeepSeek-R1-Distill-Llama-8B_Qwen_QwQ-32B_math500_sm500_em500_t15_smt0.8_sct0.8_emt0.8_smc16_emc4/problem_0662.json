            "output": "First, I'll define the variables based on the given information. Let T represent the weight of one treek, S for one squig, and G for one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement: Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\nThis gives me the equation:\n10T = 3S + G\n\nFrom the second statement: Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\nThis translates to:\n2T + G = S\n\nNow, I can substitute the second equation into the first. Since S = 2T + G, replacing S in the first equation:\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G\nSimplifying:\n10T = 6T + 3G + G\n10T = 6T + 4G\nSubtracting 6T from both sides:\n4T = 4G\nDividing both sides by 4:\nT = G\n\nThis means the weight of one treek is equal to the weight of one goolee.\n\nNow, substituting T = G back into the second equation:\n2T + T = S\n3T = S\nTherefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Variables**\n- Let \\( T \\) represent the weight of one **treek**.\n- Let \\( S \\) represent the weight of one **squig**.\n- Let \\( G \\) represent the weight of one **gool ee**.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Given Information into Equations**\n\n1. **Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee:**\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:**\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1**\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\\[\nS = 2T + G\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( S \\) in Equation 1:\n\\[\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G\n\\]\n\\"
