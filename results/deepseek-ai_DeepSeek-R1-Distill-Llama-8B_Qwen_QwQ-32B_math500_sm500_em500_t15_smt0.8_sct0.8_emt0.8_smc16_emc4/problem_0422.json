It says that this equation has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The question is asking me to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nHmm, first, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real number because the modulus squared is always non-negative. So each term in the sum is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). That might be useful later.\n\nNow, let me think about the equation. It's a 10th-degree polynomial, which makes sense since there are 10 roots. Let me write it as:\n\\[\nx^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\n\\]\nMaybe I can factor this or find a substitution that simplifies it.\n\nLooking at the equation, it resembles the form \\(A + B = 0\\), where \\(A = x^{10}\\) and \\(B = (13x - 1)^{10}\\). If I divide both sides by \\(B\\), assuming \\(B \\neq 0\\), I get:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} \\right)^{10} + 1 = 0\n\\]\nWait, that simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} \\right)^{10} = -1\n\\]\nTaking the 10th root of both sides, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{13x - 1} = \\omega\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of -1.

So maybe my substitution is okay.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to let \\(y = \\frac{x}{13x - 1}\\). Let's see if we can express this substitution in a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set \\(t = 13x - 1\\), so that \\(x = \\frac{t + 1}{13}\\). Let me try that substitution.\n\nSubstituting back into the original equation:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{t + 1}{13} \\right)^{10} + t^{10} = 0\n\\]\nHmm, that might not necessarily simplify things, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if I let \\(x = \\frac{1}{13y}\\), but that might not help. Wait, let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of substitution, I can think about Vieta's formula or properties of roots. Since the equation is in the form \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), maybe there's a way to express it as \\(x^{10} = (-1)(13x - 1)^{10}\\), which suggests that each root \\(r_i\\) satisfies \\(r_i^{10} = (-1)(13r_i - 1)^{10}\\).\n\nTaking the 10th root on both sides, for each \\(r_i\\), we get:\n\\[\nr_i = \\omega (13 r_i - 1)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of \\(-1\\).

Since there are 10 roots, each corresponding to a different \\(\\omega\\), this might be a way to parametrize all roots.\n\nAlternatively, since \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), so \\(\\omega\\) can be written as \\(e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\).

Let me clarify:\n\nEach root \\(r_j\\) appears in the sum as \\(\\frac{1}{r_j \\overline{r_j}}\\), but since the equation has 10 roots, grouped into 5 conjugate pairs, the sum is over 5 terms, each term being \\(\\frac{1}{r_j \\overline{r_j}}\\) for each pair \\(j\\). So the sum is \\(\\sum_{j=1}^5 \\frac{1}{r_j \\overline{r_j}}\\). However, each \\(r_j\\) and \\(\\overline{r_j}\\) are roots, so the product \\(r_j \\overline{r_j} = |r_j|^2\\), and since \\(\\overline{r_j}\\) is another root, \\(\\overline{r_j}\\) is also in the sum.

So perhaps each pair contributes once, and the sum is the sum over all 5 pairs of \\(1/|r_j|^2\\).\n\nBut maybe there's a better approach. Let me consider writing the original equation as \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides (though technically, roots in complex analysis can split into multiple branches), but perhaps more importantly, each root \\(r\\) satisfies \\(r = \\omega (13 r -1)\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\). So, \\(r = 13 \\omega r - \\omega\\), leading to \\(r(1 - 13 \\omega) = -\\omega\\), so \\(r = \\frac{\\omega}{13 \\omega - 1}\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was \\(r = \\frac{-\\omega}{1 - 13"

Taking both sides to the 1/10 power, but in complex numbers, this would give \\(x = \\omega (13x -1)\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\).

So each root is \\(r = \\frac{ - \\omega }{1 - 13 \\omega }\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\). So each root is determined by a 10th root of -1.\n\nTherefore, all roots can be parametrized by \\(\\omega\\) where \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\). So, the roots are \\(r_{\\omega} = \\frac{ - \\omega }{1 - 13 \\omega }\\).\n\nNow, since the roots come in conjugate pairs, for each \\(\\omega\\), its conjugate \\(\\overline{\\omega}\\) would also be a root of \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), so the roots \\(r_{\\omega}\\) and \\(r_{\\overline{\\omega}}\\) would be conjugates?
