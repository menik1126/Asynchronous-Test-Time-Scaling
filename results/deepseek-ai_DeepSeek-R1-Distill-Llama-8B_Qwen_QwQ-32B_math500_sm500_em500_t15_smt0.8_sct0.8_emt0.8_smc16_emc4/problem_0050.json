            "output": "Alright, I need to figure out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me a table with the percentage of bus riders for males and females in each grade. The total number of students surveyed per grade is 300 males and 300 females, so that makes 600 students per grade. That\u2019s important because it allows me to calculate the actual number of male and female bus riders for each grade.\n\nSo, the key here is that I need to find out when the number of males is equal to or closest to 1.35 times the number of females. Since percentages are given, I think I should convert those percentages into actual numbers first.\n\nLet me list out the grades and their respective percentages:\n\n- 9th grade: Males 41.1%, Females 39.4%\n- 10th grade: Males 34.4%, Females 33.1%\n- 11th grade: Males 20.6%, Females 13.8%\n- 12th grade: Males 11.6%, Females 8.6%\n\nSince there are 300 males and 300 females in each grade, the number of bus riders is just the percentage times 300. So for each grade, I can calculate:\n\nNumber of male bus riders = (Percentage of males / 100) * 300\nNumber of female bus riders = (Percentage of females / 100) * 300\n\nOnce I have those numbers, I can check for each grade whether the number of males is closest to 135% of the females. That means I need to calculate (males = 1.35 * females) and see which grade is closest to this ratio.\n\nLet me start with 9th grade:\n\nMales: 41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300 = 123.3\nFemales: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300 = 118.2\n\nNow, 135% of females is 1.35 * 118.2 = let me calculate that: 118.2 * 1.35. Hmm, 100 * 1.35 is 135, 18.2 * 1.35 is... 18 * "

So males should be approximately 159.57.\n\nBut in reality, males are 123.3, which is pretty far from 159.57. The difference is 159.57 - 123.3 \u2248 36.27. So that's a big gap. Maybe I should keep that in mind but continue checking other grades.\n\nMoving on to 10th grade:\n\nMales: 34.4% of 300 = 0.344 * 300 = 103.2\nFemales: 33.1% of 300 = 0.331 * 300 = 99.3\n\n135% of females is 1.35 * 99.3. Let me compute that: 100 * 1.35 is 135, subtract 0.7 * 1.35: 0.7 * 1.35 = 0.945, so 135 - 0.945 = 134.055. So males should be around 134.055, but males are 103.2. That's a big difference again. Maybe around 30-40 points less. Not too close.\n\nNow 11th grade:\n\nMales: 20.6% of 300 = 0.206 * 300 = 61.8\nFemales: 13.8% of 300 = 0.138 * 300 = 41.4\n\n135% of females is 1.35 * 41.4. Let's calculate that: 1.35 * 40 = 54, 1.35 * 1.4 = 1.89, so total is 54 + 1.89 = 55.89. So males should be around 55.89, but they are 61.8. The difference here is 55.89 - 61.8 \u2248 5.91. So that's pretty close. Hmm, this might be our candidate.\n\nWait, but let me not jump to conclusions. I should also check 12th grade.\n\n12th grade:\n\nMales: 11.6% of 300 = 0."

Let me compute that: 1 * 25.8 = 25.8, 0.35 * 25.8 = 8.97, so total is 25.8 + 8.97 = 34.77. So males should be about 34.77, but males are 34.8. That's really close! The difference is 34.8 vs 34.77, which is just 0.03. Wow, that's super close.\n\nWait, so now I have two grades that are close. 11th grade and 12th grade.\n\nBut in 11th grade, the male bus riders are 61.8, and 135% of females is about 55.89, so the difference is 61.8 - 55.89 \u2248 5.91.\n\nIn 12th grade, the male is 34.8, and 135% of females is 34.77, so the difference is 34.8 - 34.77 \u2248 0.03.\n\nThat's a huge difference between the two. 12th grade is almost exactly at 135% when you calculate the exact value.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 11th grade:\n\nMales: 20.6% of 300 = 61.8\nFemales: 13.8% of 300 = 41.4\n\n135% of females is 41.4 * 1.35.

Hmm, that contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, so perhaps I was wrong earlier. Because the ratio of percentages is 11.6 / 8.6 \u2248 1.3488, which is approximately 1.35, which would mean males are approximately 135% of females. So that's why it's so close.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 25.8 * 1.35, I got 34.83, and males were 34.8, which is 0.03 less, so the difference is very small.\n\nBut when I think in terms of percentages, 11.6 / 8.6 is approximately 1.3488, so 1.35, so the ratio is 1.35, so number of males is 1.35 times the number of females.
