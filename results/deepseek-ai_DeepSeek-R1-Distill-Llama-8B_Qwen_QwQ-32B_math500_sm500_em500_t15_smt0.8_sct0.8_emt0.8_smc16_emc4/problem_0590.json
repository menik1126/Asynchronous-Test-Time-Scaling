So the equation becomes \\( 75 - 4(5 - a)^2 = 189 \\).\n\nThen, I'll isolate the squared term by subtracting 75 from both sides: \\( -4(5 - a)^2 = 114 \\).\n\nTo make it easier, I'll divide both sides by -4, which means multiplying by -\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). This gives me \\( (5 - a)^2 = -28.75 \\).\n\nSince a square of a real number can't be negative, this equation has no real solutions. Therefore, there are no real values of \\( a \\) that satisfy the original equation.\n\nIt seems there might be an error in the problem setup because the resulting equation leads to a contradiction where a square equals a negative number, which isn't possible in the realm of real numbers.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\cdot 5^2 - 4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the Equation**\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:\n\\[\n3 \\cdot 5^2 - 4(5 - a)^2 = 189\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Known Values**\n\nCompute \\( 3 \\cdot 5^2 \\):\n\\[\n3 \\cdot 25 = 75\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n75 - 4(5 - a)^2 = 189\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Isolate the Squared Term**\n\nSubtract 75 from both sides:\n\\[\n-4(5 - a)^2 = 189 - 75\n\\]\n\\[\n-4(5 - a)^2 = 114\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( (5 - a)^2 \\)**\n\nDivide both sides by"
