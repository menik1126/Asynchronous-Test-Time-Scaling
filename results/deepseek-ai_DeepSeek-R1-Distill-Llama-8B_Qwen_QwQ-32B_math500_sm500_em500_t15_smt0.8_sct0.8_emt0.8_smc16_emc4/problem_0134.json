            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the units digit of 4's superfactorial, which is denoted as 4$. From what I remember, the superfactorial is a tower of factorials, meaning you take n!, then use that result as the base for the next factorial, and repeat this n times. So for 4$, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!))). \n\nFirst, let me break it down. Let's start from the top of the tower and work our way down. Maybe that will make it easier since the units digit patterns often repeat or become manageable after a while. \n\nSo, starting with the innermost part, we have 4! which is 24. Okay, so the innermost factorial is 24. Then moving up one level, we have 4!^24. Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the notation correctly.\n\nThe definition says 4$ is a tower of n! factorials, each level being the factorial of the one above. So actually, 4$ is 4!^(4!^(4!^4!))). Hmm, so maybe I should write it as:\n\n4!^(4!^(4!^4!))\n\nSo, starting from the top, it's 4!^4!, then that result is raised to 4!, and finally, the whole thing is raised to 4!. So, perhaps it's better to evaluate the tower from the top down, as that might simplify things.\n\nLet me start with the top level: 4! is 24. Then, the next level is 4!^24. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, in the superfactorial notation, it's n!^{{n!^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}} with n levels. So for 4$, it's four levels of factorials:\n\n4!^(4!^(4!^4!))\n\nSo, starting from the top, we have 4! = 24. Then, the next level is 4!^24. Then, the next level is 4! raised to that result, and finally, the top level is 4! raised to the entire tower. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should compute it step by step. Let's denote each level:\n\nLet\u2019s"

The units digit of a number is the remainder when divided by 10. \n\nHowever, exponent towers can be tricky. To compute 24^(24^(24^24)) mod 10, we can use Euler's theorem, but first, let's recall that Euler's theorem states that if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n, where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. \n\nBut 24 and 10 are not coprime, since they share a common divisor of 2. So Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Hmm, so maybe we need another approach. \n\nAlternatively, since we are dealing with mod 10, perhaps we can look at the pattern of the units digit of powers of 24. \n\nBut 24 mod 10 is 4, so the base 24 is congruent to 4 mod 10. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding 4^(24^(24^24)) mod 10. \n\nAh, that's a good simplification. So instead of dealing with 24, we can just consider 4 as the base. So now, the problem is to find the units digit of 4 raised to a very large exponent, which is 24^(24^24). \n\nNow, to compute 4^k mod 10, where k is 24^(24^24). Let's see the pattern of 4^n mod 10. \n\nLet me list the powers of 4 mod 10:\n\n4"

Let's figure out if k is even or odd. \n\nSince 24 is even, any power of 24 is also even. Therefore, 24^(24^24) is an even number. Therefore, k is even. \n\nSo, 4^k mod 10 is 6. Therefore, the units digit of 4$ is 6.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nFirst, I converted 24 mod 10, which is 4. Then, I noticed that 4 has a units digit cycle of 2: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc. Then, I determined that whether the exponent is even or odd affects the result. Since the exponent is 24^(24^24), and since 24 is even, any power of it is also even. So the exponent is even, meaning 4^k mod 10 is 6. \n\nThat seems correct. So the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can re-examine the exponent tower one more time. \n\nThe exponent is 24^(24^24). Let's see: since 24 is even, 24^anything is even, right? Because multiplying even numbers together results in an even number. So, 24^1 is even, 24^2 is even, etc. So, 24^(anything) is even. Therefore, 24^(24^24) is even, so k is even. So yes, 4^k mod 10 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of"

Let me see if there's a case where the exponent could be 0 mod something, but since 24 is positive, the exponent is definitely a positive integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the exponent modulo \u03c6(10), but since 4 and 10 are not coprime, Euler's theorem might not apply here. Wait, but since we already simplified the problem to 4^k mod 10, and noticed the cycle of 2, perhaps that's sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of another approach. Let me see:\n\nThe units digit of 4^n cycles every 2. So, if n is even, it's 6; if odd, 4. Since the exponent here is 24^(24^24), which is even, so 6. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6. \n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Let's say if the exponent was 2, then 4^2 is 16, which ends with 6. If exponent is 3, 4^3 is 64, which ends with 4. So yes, the cycle is indeed 2. \n\nTherefore, the key is the exponent's parity. Since the exponent is even, the result is 6. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4$ is 6. \n\nHmm, but let me check if I interpreted the superfactorial correctly. The problem says \"n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}} }_{n!}\". So the tower has n! number of n! terms. Wait, hold on, the question says \"underbrace{ ... }_{n!}\", meaning the number of terms in the tower is n!? \n\nWait, that might be a critical point. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\n\"The superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}} }_{n!}. What is the units digit of 4\\$?\"\n\nAh! Wait a second. The underbrace says the number of terms is n! So for n=4, the tower has 4!"

So, it's a much taller tower.\n\nThat significantly changes the problem. So, the original tower for 4\\$ is much taller, with 24 levels instead of 4. That's a big difference. \n\nTherefore, my previous approach was incorrect because I thought it was a 4-level tower, but it's actually 24 levels. \n\nSo now, I need to find the units digit of 4! raised to a tower of 24 levels, each being 4!.\n\nSo, 4\\$ = 4!^{4!^{4!^{...}}} with 24 levels.\n\nTherefore, to compute the units digit, I need to compute 4!^{4!^{4!^{...}}} mod 10.\n\nBut 4! is 24, so each level is 24.

Let me see:\n\nSuppose the tower is 24^24^24... with 24 levels. Let me see if the exponent is even. \n\nThe tower is 24^(24^(24^...)).

Then, 4\\$ would be 24, which has units digit 4. But according to the problem's definition, n\\$ is a tower of n! terms. Wait, but for n=1, 1\\$ would be 1!^{1!^{...}} with 1! =1 term. So, 1!^0? Wait, maybe the tower has n! terms, so for n=1, it's 1 term, so just 1!.\n\nWait, perhaps the tower is n! terms, so for n=4, it's 24 terms.
