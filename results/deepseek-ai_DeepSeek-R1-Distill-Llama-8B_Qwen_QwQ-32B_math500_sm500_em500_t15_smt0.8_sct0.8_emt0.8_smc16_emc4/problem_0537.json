            "output": "First, determine the total number of dishes available on the menu, which is 10.\n\nSince both Yann and Camille need to choose a dish, we start by considering all possible combinations of their choices without any restrictions. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices each person has separately, which is 10 for Yann and 10 for Camille.\n\nHowever, the problem states that they refuse to order the same dish. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of combinations where both choose the same dish. There are 10 such cases, one for each dish on the menu.\n\nBy subtracting the restricted combinations from the total, we get the number of valid combinations where Yann and Camille order different dishes.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nYann and Camille go to a restaurant. If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of possible meal combinations Yann and Camille can order under the constraint that they do not choose the same dish.\n\n1. **Total Number of Dishes:**  \n   There are **10** items on the menu.\n\n2. **Total Possible Combinations Without Restrictions:**  \n   - Yann has **10** choices.  \n   - Camille also has **10** choices.  \n   - So, the total number of combinations is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 10 = 100\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the Cases Where They Order the Same Dish:**  \n   - If both order the **same dish**, there are **10** such cases (one for each dish on the menu).\n   - Therefore, we subtract these from the total:\n     \\[\n     100 - 10 = 90\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**  \n   The number of valid combinations where Yann and Camille order different dishes is **90**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"
