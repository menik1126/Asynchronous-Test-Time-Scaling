Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the original expression to make it clearer. It's sqrt(sqrt[3](sqrt(1/729))). So, starting from the inside, we have the square root of 1/729. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, sqrt(1/729). Well, the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729... hmm, what's 729? I think 729 is 9^3 because 9*9=81, and 81*9=729. So, 9^3 is 729, which means sqrt(729) is 27 because (27)^2 is 729. So, sqrt(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nWait, let me make sure. sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(a)/sqrt(b), right? So, sqrt(1) is 1, sqrt(729) is 27, so yes, sqrt(1/729) is 1/27. Got that.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, it's the cube root of that result. So, cube root of 1/27. Hmm, cube root of 1 is 1, and cube root of 27 is 3 because 3^3 is 27. So, cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Let me write that down.\n\nSo now, the expression simplifies to sqrt(1/3). Because the original expression was sqrt of the cube root of sqrt(1/729), which is sqrt(1/3). Wait, is that right? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal expression: sqrt[3]{sqrt{sqrt{1/729}}}. I did sqrt(1/729)=1/27, then cube root of 1/27 is 1/3, and then sqrt of 1/3 is... So, that's correct. So, sqrt(1/3).\n\nBut the problem says to write it with a rational denominator. So, sqrt(1/3). Hmm, how do I rationalize that? Well, sqrt(1/3) is the same as sqrt(3)/3, because sqrt(1)/sqrt("

So, that would have a rational denominator.\n\nWait, let me confirm each step again to be sure. Let me go through each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost radical: sqrt(1/729). As above, sqrt(1) is 1, sqrt(729) is 27, so that's 1/27. Then, the next layer is the cube root of that. Cube root of 1/27. Since 27 is 3^3, so cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then, the outermost square root of that result, so sqrt(1/3). \n\nYes, that's correct. So sqrt(1/3) is equal to 1/sqrt(3). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\n(1 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/3. \n\nTherefore, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this by expressing everything with exponents. Maybe that would be a better way to handle the radicals. Let me try that approach to confirm.\n\nStarting with the original expression: sqrt( sqrt[3]{ sqrt(1/729) } )\n\nExpressed with exponents, square root is exponent 1/2, cube root is exponent 1/3, so:\n\nFirst, the innermost: sqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^{1/2}\n\nThen, the cube root of that is [ (1/729)^{1/2} ]^{1/3} = (1/729)^{ (1/2)*(1/3) } = (1/729)^{1/6}\n\nThen, the outermost square root is [ (1/729)^{1/6} ]^{1/2} = (1/729)^{ (1/6)*(1/2) } = (1/729)^{1/12}\n\nHmm, so the entire expression simplifies to (1/7"

            "output": ")^{something}. Wait, 729 is 9^3, and 9 is 3^2, so 729 is 3^6. Let me confirm: 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^6 is 729, yes. So 729 is 3^6.\n\nTherefore, (1/729) is 3^{-6}.\n\nSo, (3^{-6})^{1/12} = 3^{-6*(1/12)} = 3^{-0.5} = 1/\u221a3.\n\nWhich is the same as sqrt(3)/3 when rationalized. So that's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nI guess that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to check out when I approach it with exponents as well. So, I think I'm done.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\\) and write it with a rational denominator, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Compute the innermost radical:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}\n   \\]\n   (Since \\(\\sqrt{729} = 27\\)).\n\n2. **Take the cube root of the result:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   (Since \\(\\sqrt[3]{27} = 3\\)).\n\n3. **Take the square root of the result:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n   \\]\n   (After rationalizing the denominator).\n\nThus, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}\\)."
