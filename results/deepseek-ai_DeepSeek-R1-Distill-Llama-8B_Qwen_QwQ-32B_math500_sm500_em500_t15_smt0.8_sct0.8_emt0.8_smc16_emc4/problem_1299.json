            "output": "Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 2/3 equals 4 divided by (x minus 5). Hmm, I need to find the value of x that makes this equation true. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an equation with fractions, a good strategy might be to eliminate the denominators to make it easier to solve. So, maybe I can cross-multiply. That is, multiply both sides of the equation by the denominators to get rid of the fractions.\n\nLet me write that down. If I have 2/3 on one side and 4/(x-5) on the other, I can cross-multiply: 2 times (x - 5) should equal 3 times 4. That should eliminate the fractions and give me a simpler equation to solve.\n\nSo, 2(x - 5) = 3 * 4. Calculating the right side first, 3 times 4 is 12. So now I have 2(x - 5) = 12. \n\nNext, I need to distribute the 2 on the left side. That would give me 2x - 10 = 12. Okay, now I have a linear equation without fractions. That's good.\n\nNow, I want to solve for x, so I should get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let me add 10 to both sides to get rid of the -10. So, 2x - 10 + 10 equals 12 + 10. That simplifies to 2x = 22.\n\nNow, to isolate x, I need to divide both sides by 2. So, 2x divided by 2 is x, and 22 divided by 2 is 11. So, x equals 11.\n\nWait a second, I should make sure that this solution is valid. Sometimes, especially when dealing with denominators, you might run into cases where the denominator becomes zero, which is undefined. So, let me check that.\n\nIn the original equation, the denominator on the right side is (x - 5). If x is 11, then 11 - 5 is 6, which is definitely not zero. So, that's okay. No division by zero issue here.\n\nLet me plug x = 11 back into the original equation to verify. Left side is"
