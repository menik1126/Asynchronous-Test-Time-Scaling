Then, I have to compute the sum of the values of each polynomial evaluated at 1.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given polynomial:\n\n\\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\).\n\nHmm, it looks like a quadratic in terms of \\(x^4\\). Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me try setting \\(y = x^4\\), so the polynomial becomes:\n\n\\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\).\n\nNow, I can try to factor this quadratic equation. Let me see if there are two numbers that multiply to \\(-4\\) and add up to 3. Let's think: 4 and -1. Yes, 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, that factors as:\n\n\\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\).\n\nSubstituting back \\(y = x^4\\), we have:\n\n\\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\).\n\nSo, the polynomial factors into two quartic polynomials. Wait, but the problem statement says each non-constant polynomial must be monic with integer coefficients and cannot be factored further over the integers. So, I need to check if \\(x^4 + 4\\) and \\(x^4 - 1\\) can be factored further.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\). I remember that \\(x^4 - 1\\) is a difference of squares because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and 1 is 1 squared. So, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Then, \\(x^2 - 1\\) is another difference of squares: \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\). So, putting it all together:\n\n\\(x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\).\n\nNow, let's look"

            "output": " at \\(x^4 + 4\\). Hmm, this is a sum of squares, right? Because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and 4 is 2 squared. However, over integers, sum of squares can sometimes be factored into quadratics. I recall that \\(x^4 + 4\\) can be factored as a product of two quadratics.\n\nWait, is there a formula for factoring \\(x^4 + a^4\\)? I think it's called Sophie Germain's identity. Let me recall: \\(x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2)\\). \n\nIn our case, \\(x^4 + 4\\) can be seen as \\(x^4 + 4*(1)^4\\). So, applying Sophie Germain's identity, with y=1, we get:\n\n\\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\).\n\nLet me check if these quadratics can be factored further. For \\(x^2 + 2x + 2\\), the discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), which is negative, so it doesn't have real roots. Similarly, for \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\), discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), also negative. So both quadratics are irreducible over integers. Great!\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\).\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication. Starting from \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\), and since \\(x^4 -1\\) factors into four terms, as above. So, total factors are five: four linear and one quadratic and another quadratic? Wait, actually, no: \\(x^4 - 1\\) factors into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\),"

So overall, the full factorization is:\n\n\\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\).\n\nSo, that is all the factorization possible with integer coefficients because all factors are irreducible.\n\nNow, the question asks for the sum \\(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1)\\), where each \\(p_i\\) is a monic irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients.\n\nSo, first, let's compute each polynomial evaluated at x=1.\n\nStarting with each factor:\n\n1. \\(p_1(x) = x - 1\\).

Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, as per the factorization, we have five polynomials, but wait, the question says \"each non-constant polynomial \\(p_i(x)\\)\", so including all the factors except the constant term which is 1. Wait, no, in the problem, we have \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4 = p_1(x) p_2(x) \\dotsm p_k(x)\\). So actually, in our factorization, we have five factors, all non-constant, so k=5.\n\nSo the sum is indeed 0 + 2 + 2 +5 +1=10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify the factorization once more because it's easy to make a mistake here.\n\nStarting with \\(x^8 +3x^4 -4\\).\n\nFactored as \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 -1)\\). Then, \\(x^4 +4 = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)\\), and \\(x^4 -1 = (x-1)(x +1)(x^2 +1)\\). So, altogether, 5 factors: (x-1), (x+1), (x^2 +1), (x^2 +2x +2), (x^2 -2x +2).
