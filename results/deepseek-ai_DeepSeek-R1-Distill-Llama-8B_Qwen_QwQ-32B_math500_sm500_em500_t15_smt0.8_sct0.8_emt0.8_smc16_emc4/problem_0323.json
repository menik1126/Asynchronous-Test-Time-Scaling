            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of ways to choose 3 boys from the total of 7 available boys. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).\n\nSo, for the boys, it would be C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!).\n\nNext, I need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 girls from the total of 4 available girls. This would be C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!).\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to choose 3 boys and 2 girls, I will multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls. This is because for each combination of boys, there are multiple combinations of girls that can be paired with them.\n\nSo, the total number of ways would be C(7, 3) * C(4, 2).\n\nCalculating this, C(7, 3) is 35 and C(4, 2) is 6. Therefore, the total number of ways is 35 * 6, which equals 210.\n\nThus, Mr. Brennan has 210 different ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his statistics class, we'll use combinations.\n\n**Step 1: Choose 3 boys from 7**\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times (7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times 4!} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Choose 2 girls from 4**\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times (4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the number of ways to choose boys and girls**\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
