The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40. That's 8 multiples.\n\nBut some numbers contribute more than one 5. Specifically, multiples of 25 (which is 5 squared) contribute an additional 5 each. The multiples of 25 in this range are 25, 50, and 75. Wait, 50 and 75 are beyond 42, so only 25 contributes an extra 5.\n\nFinally, I'll add these together. There are 8 multiples of 5 and 1 additional multiple of 25, making a total of 9 factors of 5.\n\nSince there are more than enough factors of 2, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is equal to the number of factors of 5, which is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Count the multiples of 5:**\n   - The multiples of 5 between 1 and 42 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40.\n   - That's a total of **8** multiples of 5.\n\n2. **Count the multiples of 25 (since 25 contributes an extra"
