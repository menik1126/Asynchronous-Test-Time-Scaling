Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I remember that \u03c9 is a 1997th root of unity. That means \u03c9^1997 = 1, and \u03c9 \u2260 1, so it's a primitive root. Roots of unity have some interesting properties, especially when it comes to sums and products. Maybe those properties can help here.\n\nLooking at the sum, it's from k = 1 to k = 1997 of 1/(1 + \u03c9^k). So, I need to compute 1/(1 + \u03c9^k) for each k and add them all up. I wonder if there's a way to simplify each term or find a pattern in the sum.\n\nI recall that for roots of unity, sometimes conjugates come into play. For example, \u03c9^k and \u03c9^{1997 - k} are conjugates because (\u03c9^k)(\u03c9^{1997 - k}) = \u03c9^1997 = 1. Maybe I can pair terms in the sum with these conjugates.\n\nLet me try that. Let's take the term 1/(1 + \u03c9^k) and its conjugate 1/(1 + \u03c9^{1997 - k}). If I add these two terms together, maybe something nice will happen.\n\nSo, consider 1/(1 + \u03c9^k) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{1997 - k}).\n\nLet me compute this sum:\n\n1/(1 + \u03c9^k) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{1997 - k}).\n\nTo add these, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + \u03c9^k) and (1 + \u03c9^{1997 - k}).\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator of the first term by (1 + \u03c9^{1997 - k}) and the second term by (1 + \u03c9^k), the sum becomes:\n\n[ (1 + \u03c9^{1997 - k}) + (1 + \u03c9^k) ] / [ (1 + \u03c9^k)(1 + \u03c9^{1997 - k}) ].\n\nSimplify the"

So \u03c9^k + \u03c9^{1997 - k} = \u03c9^k + (\u03c9^k)^{-1} because (\u03c9^{1997 - k}) = 1/\u03c9^k since \u03c9^1997 = 1.\n\nSo, the numerator becomes 2 + \u03c9^k + 1/\u03c9^k.\n\nHmm, can I write this differently? Maybe in terms of \u03c9^k + 1/\u03c9^k.\n\nWait, let me compute the denominator as well. The denominator is (1 + \u03c9^k)(1 + \u03c9^{1997 - k}).\n\nExpanding this, we get 1*1 + 1*\u03c9^{1997 - k} + \u03c9^k*1 + \u03c9^k*\u03c9^{1997 - k}.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 1.\n\nSecond term: \u03c9^{1997 - k}.\n\nThird term: \u03c9^k.\n\nFourth term: \u03c9^{1997 - k + k} = \u03c9^1997 = 1.\n\nSo, the denominator becomes 1 + \u03c9^k + \u03c9^{1997 - k} + 1 = 2 + \u03c9^k + \u03c9^{1997 - k}.\n\nWait, that's the same as the numerator!\n\nSo both numerator and denominator are equal, meaning the fraction equals 1.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 + \u03c9^k) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{1997 - k}) = 1.\n\nWow, that's a useful result! So each pair adds up to 1.\n\nBut let me confirm that. Let me set k to some number, say k=1.\n\nSo, compute 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^1996). Since \u03c9^1996 = \u03c9^{-1}, this becomes 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{-1}).\n\nCompute 1/(1 + \u03c9^{-1}) = \u03c9/(1 + \u03c9), because multiplying numerator and denominator by \u03c9 gives \u03c9/(\u03c9 + 1).\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 + \u03c9) + \u03c9/(1 + \u03c9)"

Since 1995 = 1997 - 2, so \u03c9^1995 = \u03c9^{-2}. Therefore, 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{-2}) = 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + \u03c9\u00b2/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = (1 + \u03c9\u00b2)/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1. So that also works.\n\nSo, indeed, each pair of terms adds up to 1. That's great! Now, how many such pairs are there in the entire sum?\n\nSince the sum goes from k=1 to k=1997, and each pair consists of two terms, except when k=1997/2, but 1997 is an odd number, so there is no middle term. So, all terms can be grouped into pairs of k and 1997 - k.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs is 1997 / 2, but wait, 1997 is odd, so 1997 = 2*998 + 1. Wait, that can't be, because 2*998 = 1996, so 1997 = 1996 +1, so when k=1 to 1996, you can pair each k with 1997 - k, and then the last term is k=1997, but \u03c9^1997 = 1, so that term is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2.\n\nWait, indeed, I had forgotten about the term when k=1997. So, let me clarify: the sum is from k=1 to k=1997, which includes k=1997, which is \u03c9^1997 = 1. So, term when k=1997 is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2. So, I need to adjust my pairing.\n\nSo, when pairing k and 1997 -k for k=1 to k=998, since 1997 - 998 = 999. Wait, no: 1997 -k, when k=998, gives 1997 - 998 = 999. So, pairing k=1 with k="

Then, the remaining term is k=1997, which is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs is 998 pairs, each summing to 1, plus the last term 1/2. Therefore, the total sum is 998 * 1 + 1/2 = 998.5, which is 1997/2. Wait, 998.5 is 1997/2? Let me check: 1997 divided by 2 is 998.5, yes. So, the total sum would be 1997/2. But wait, hold on, let me confirm.\n\nWait, the number of pairs is (1997 -1)/2 = 998 pairs, since the total terms from 1 to 1996 can be paired into 998 pairs, each adding to 1, so 998 *1 = 998, plus the last term 1/2, so total is 998 + 1/2 = 998.5 = 1997/2. So, the answer is 1997/2?\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me see:\n\nTotal terms: 1997 terms. The first 1996 terms (k=1 to 1996) can be grouped into 998 pairs, each pair sums to 1, so 998 *1 = 998. Then the last term (k=1997) is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2. So total sum is 998 + 1/2 = 998.5, which is indeed 1997/2. Since 1997 is an odd number, so 1997 divided by 2 is 998.5. So, the answer is 1997/2.

Then the sum would be 1/(1 + (-1)) + 1/(1 +1). Wait, but 1/(1 + (-1)) is 1/0, which is undefined. Hmm, so n=2 is problematic because 1/(1 + \u03c9) would be division by zero. But in the problem, n=1997 is prime? Wait, 1997 is a prime number, so maybe that's why it works here. Wait, but in the problem, the question says \u03c9^1997 =1 and \u03c9\u22601, so \u03c9 is a primitive 1997th root of unity. So, in that case, \u03c9^k \u2260 -1 for any k, because 1997 is odd, so 1 + \u03c9^k is never zero. Because if 1 + \u03c9^k =0, then \u03c9^k = -1, but then \u03c9^{2k}=1, so the order of \u03c9 divides 2k, but since the order is 1997, which is prime, so 1997 divides 2k.
