            "output": "Alright, so I have this polynomial: \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\). It's a quartic polynomial, and I need to find the number of different possible rational roots it could have. The coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) are integers, but I don't know their exact values. Hmm, okay.\n\nI remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me recall what that says. I think it states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. Right? So, in this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2.\n\nSo, applying the Rational Root Theorem, the possible values for \\(p\\) (the numerator) are the factors of 1. Since 1 is a prime number, its only factors are \\(\\pm1\\). Now, the denominator \\(q\\) is a factor of 2. The factors of 2 are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\).\n\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are the fractions where the numerator is \\(\\pm1\\) and the denominator is \\(\\pm1\\) or \\(\\pm2\\). Let me list them out:\n\n1. When the denominator is 1:\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{-1}{1} = -1\\)\n\n2. When the denominator is -1:\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{-1} = -1\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{-1}{-1} = 1\\)\n\nHmm, I notice that 1 and -1 appear twice here, but they are the same values. So, duplicates don't count as different roots.\n\n3. When the denominator is 2:\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{-1}{2}\\)\n\n4. When the denominator is -2:\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{-1}{-2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\"

So, overall, the distinct possible rational roots are \\(1\\), \\(-1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nWait, are there any other possible roots? Let me double-check. The constant term is 1, so its only divisors are 1 and -1. The leading coefficient is 2, so its divisors are 1, -1, 2, and -2. Combining these, the possible fractions are all combinations of \\(\\pm1\\) over \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\), but as we saw, duplicates occur only for 1 and -1.\n\nSo, do I have four distinct possible rational roots? Let me enumerate them again:\n\n1. \\(1\\)\n2. \\(-1\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n4. \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nYes, that's four different possible rational roots. I don't think I've missed any because all possible fractions derived from the factors of 1 and 2 have been considered, and duplicates have been eliminated.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think if there's any edge case or something. Since 1 and -1 can be written over 1, 2, or -2, but they remain the same when reduced. Similarly, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) are distinct from 1 and -1, so they are four unique possibilities. \n\nI don't see any other factors or possibilities here. So, I'm confident that the number of different possible rational roots is four.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial is \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\). Using the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\). There are four distinct possible rational roots.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
