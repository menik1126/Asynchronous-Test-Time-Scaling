            "output": "To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), I start by factoring the denominator.\n\nFirst, I look for two numbers that multiply to \\(-14\\) and add to \\(-5\\). Those numbers are \\(-7\\) and \\(2\\). So, the denominator factors as \\( (x - 7)(x + 2) \\).\n\nNext, to find the vertical asymptotes, I set the denominator equal to zero: \\( (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \\). This gives the vertical asymptotes at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Therefore, \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nFor the horizontal asymptote, I compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Thus, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nFinally, adding these values together: \\( a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   \n   The denominator is a quadratic expression: \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\). To factor it, find two numbers that multiply to \\(-14\\) and add to \\(-5\\).\n   \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   x^2 - 5x - 14 &= (x - 7)(x + 2) \\\\\n   &\\quad \\text{(since } -7 \\times 2 = -14 \\text{ and } -7 + 2 = -5\\text{)}\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find Vertical Asymptotes:**\n   \n   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero (provided the numerator doesn't also equal zero there).\n   \n   \\[\n   (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 7 \\quad \\text{"

Since \\( 1 < 2 \\), the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\).
