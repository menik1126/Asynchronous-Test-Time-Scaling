            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: the square root of the cube root of the square root of 1/729. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step. Let me start by writing down the expression to get a better visual.\n\nThe expression is: \u221a(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))). So, it's a nested radical and a cube root. I know that radicals can be written with exponents, which might make it easier to manipulate. Let me recall that the nth root of a number is the same as raising that number to the power of 1/n. So, a square root is the same as raising to the 1/2 power, and a cube root is raising to the 1/3 power.\n\nSo, I can rewrite the expression using exponents. Let me do that step by step. Starting from the innermost part, which is \u221a(1/729). That would be (1/729)^(1/2). Then, that result is inside a cube root, so that would be [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3). Then, the entire thing is under a square root, so that would be [[(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3)]^(1/2).\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy with all the exponents. Maybe I can combine the exponents since they're nested. Remembering that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, for example, (a^b)^c = a^(b*c). Let me apply that here.\n\nStarting from the inside out: the innermost exponent is 1/2 for the square root. Then, that's raised to the 1/3 for the cube root, so 1/2 * 1/3 is 1/6. Then, that result is under a square root, so we multiply by another 1/2, making it 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12. So, the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12). Hmm, that seems manageable.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can compute (1/729)^(1/12) more directly. I know that 729 is a power of 9, right? Let me check:"

            "output": " 9^3 is 729 because 9*9=81, 81*9=729. So, 729 = 9^3. But 9 is 3^2, so substituting, 729 = (3^2)^3 = 3^(2*3) = 3^6. Ah, that's useful because 3^6 is 729. So, 729 = 3^6. Therefore, 1/729 is 1/(3^6).\n\nSo, substituting back into (1/729)^(1/12), it becomes (1/(3^6))^(1/12). Using exponent rules, that would be 1^(1/12) / (3^6)^(1/12). Since 1 raised to any power is still 1, it simplifies to 1 / (3^(6 * 1/12)). Let me compute that exponent: 6*(1/12) = 6/12 = 1/2. So, now it's 1 / 3^(1/2). Which is 1 divided by the square root of 3. \n\nBut the problem asks to write the result with a rational denominator. Right now, it's 1 over \u221a3, which has an irrational denominator. I need to rationalize the denominator. I recall that to rationalize the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a3. So, that gives (1*\u221a3) / (\u221a3 * \u221a3) = \u221a3 / 3. Since \u221a3 times \u221a3 is 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original expression \u221a(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))) simplifies down to \u221a3 divided by 3. Alternatively, that can be written as (\u221a3)/3 or (\u221a3)/3. Either way, both represent the same value, and the denominator is rationalized.\n\nLet me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the inside: \u221a(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2). Then, that is inside a cube root, so raise it to 1/3, making it (1/729)^(1/6). Wait, earlier I thought of it as 1/12, but hold on, 1/2 * 1/3 is 1/"

So, 1/\u221a3, and then rationalizing gives \u221a3/3. Wait, okay, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach the problem by converting each root step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with \u221a(1/729). As we know, 1/729 is 1 over 3^6. So, the square root of 1/729 is \u221a(1/729) = 1/\u221a729. But \u221a729 is 27, because 27^2 is 729. So, that simplifies to 1/27. Then, we take the cube root of that result: \u221b(1/27). Since 27 is 3^3, \u221b(1/27) is 1/3. Then, taking the square root of 1/3: \u221a(1/3) = \u221a1 / \u221a3 = 1/\u221a3. Then, as before, rationalizing the denominator, we get \u221a3/3.\n\nHmm, that seems to confirm the result as well. So, both methods give me \u221a3 over 3.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach it, maybe using exponents in a different order or something else, but I think these two methods are solid and both lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that it's correct.\n\nSo, in summary, the steps are:\n\n1. Express the given nested radical with exponents.\n2. Simplify the exponents by multiplying them.\n3. Recognize that 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is 3^(-6).\n4. Then, apply the exponents step by step, which leads to 3^(-1/2).\n5. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a3, resulting in \u221a3/3.\n\nI think that's it. It all checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe original expression can be simplified step by step. Starting from the innermost radical:\n\n1. Compute the"
