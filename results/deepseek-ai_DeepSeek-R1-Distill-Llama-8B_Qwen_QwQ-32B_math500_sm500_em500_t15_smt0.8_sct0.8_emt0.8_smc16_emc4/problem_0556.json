Looking at the chart, the 70s row shows the number of stamps for each country and their corresponding prices.\n\nThere are five stamps from Brazil priced at 6 cents each, nine stamps from Spain priced at 6 cents each, and twelve stamps from Peru priced at 12 cents each. \n\nNext, calculate the total cost for each country:\n- Brazil: 5 stamps \u00d7 \\$6 = \\$30\n- Spain: 9 stamps \u00d7 \\$6 = \\$54\n- Peru: 12 stamps \u00d7 \\$12 = \\$144\n\nSum these totals to find the overall cost for the 70s stamps: \\$30 + \\$54 + \\$144 = \\$228.\n\nFinally, determine the average price by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps: \\$228 \u00f7 35 = \\$6.514.\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth of a cent, the average price is approximately 6.5 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of the stamps issued in the 70s, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant data for the 70s decade from the chart:**\n   - **Brazil:** 5 stamps priced at 6 cents each.\n   - **Peru:** 9 stamps priced at 12 cents each.\n   - **Spain:** 12 stamps priced at 6 cents each.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost for each country:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\(5 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents} = 30 \\text{ cents}\\)\n   - **Peru:** \\(9 \\text{ stamps} \\times 12 \\text{ cents} = 108 \\text{ cents}\\)\n   - **Spain:** \\(12 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents} = 72 \\text{ cents}\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of stamps in the 70s:**\n   - Total stamps: \\(5 + 9 + 12 = 26 \\text{ stamps}\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the total cost for all 70s stamps:**\n   - Total cost: \\(30 + 108 + 72 = 210 \\text{ cents}\\)\n\n5. **Determine the average price:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average price} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost}}{\\text{Total number of stamps"
