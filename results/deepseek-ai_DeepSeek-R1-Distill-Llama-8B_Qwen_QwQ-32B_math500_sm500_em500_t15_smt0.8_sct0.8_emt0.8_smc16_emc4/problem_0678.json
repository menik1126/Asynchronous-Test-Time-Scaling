These cards are distributed equally among \\( x \\) players, with each player receiving \\( y \\) cards.\n   \n   **Given:**\n   - \\( x \\geq 2 \\) (at least 2 players)\n   - \\( y \\geq 5 \\) (each player gets at least 5 cards)\n   \n2. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   Since each player gets the same number of cards:\n   \\[\n   54 = x \\times y\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Express \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{54}{x}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Apply the Given Constraints:**\n   - \\( y \\geq 5 \\) implies:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5\n     \\]\n   \n5. **Solve the Inequality for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 54 \\geq 5x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x \\leq \\frac{54}{5} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x \\leq 10.8\n   \\]\n   \n   Since \\( x \\) must be an integer:\n   \\[\n   x \\leq 10\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Determine the Possible Values of"
