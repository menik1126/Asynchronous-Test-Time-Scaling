Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem is useful for finding possible rational roots. Since the question is specifically asking for integer roots, maybe I can apply this theorem here. The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational solution, expressed in lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at the equation, the constant term is \\(-14\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(1\\) because the term \\(x^4\\) has a coefficient of 1. So, the possible values for \\(p\\) are the factors of \\(-14\\), which are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\), and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient \\(1\\), meaning \\(q = \\pm1\\). Therefore, the possible rational roots are just these factors, which in this case are the same as the integer factors since \\(q\\) is 1.\n\nSo, the possible integer roots are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). That gives me a set of candidates to test. I can go through each one and plug it into the equation to see if it satisfies.\n\nLet me start with the positive ones and work my way through.\n\n1. Let's test \\(x = 1\\):\n   Substitute into the equation: \\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\).\n   Calculate each term:\n   - \\(1^4 = 1\\)\n   - \\(5(1)^3 = 5*1 = 5\\)\n   - \\(9(1)^2 = 9*1 = 9\\)\n   So adding them up: \\(1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1 + 5) + (9 - 1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0\\).\n   Hey, that works!"
