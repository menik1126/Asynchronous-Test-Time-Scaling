            "output": "First, I need to understand the given fraction: 21 divided by (2 squared multiplied by 5 to the power of 7). To convert this fraction into a terminating decimal, it's necessary for the denominator to have only the prime factors of 2 and 5, and no other prime numbers.\n\nThe current denominator is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u2077, which already meets the criteria for the denominator of a terminating decimal. Therefore, the fraction is already in a form that can be converted into a terminating decimal.\n\nNext, I'll perform the division 21 divided by (2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u2077), which is 21 divided by 25 \u00d7 78,125.\n\nCalculating 21 divided by 78,125 will give me the desired decimal. Since the denominator doesn't have any other prime factors besides 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate after a finite number of digits.\n\nFinally, I'll carry out the division to find the exact decimal value, ensuring that all decimal places are correct and that the decimal terminates as required.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).\n   - Both 2 and 5 are prime factors of 10, which means the denominator consists only of the prime factors 2 and 5. This is a necessary condition for a fraction to be a terminating decimal.\n\n2. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - No simplification is needed since 21 and \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\) share no common factors other than 1.\n\n3. **Convert the Fraction to Decimal:**\n   - To convert \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a decimal, divide 21 by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21}{4 \\cdot 78125} = \\frac{21}{312500}\n     \\]\n   - Perform the division:\n     \\[\n     21 \\div 312500 = 0.0000672\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Decimal Representation:**\n   - The decimal terminates after 5 places.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.000067"
