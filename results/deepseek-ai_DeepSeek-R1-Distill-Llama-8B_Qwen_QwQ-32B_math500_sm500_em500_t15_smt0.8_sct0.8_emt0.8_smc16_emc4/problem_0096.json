            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n( C )/(x - 3) + ( D )/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/(x\u00b2 + 5x - 24)\n\nHmm, okay. The equation is supposed to hold for all real values of x except -8 and 3 because those values would make the denominators zero and cause division by zero. So, I think this is an identity, meaning both sides must be equal for all x except those excluded values.\n\nI remember that when you have two fractions on the left side, you can combine them into a single fraction by finding a common denominator. The denominators here are (x - 3) and (x + 8). The common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). So, let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll rewrite the left side over the common denominator:\n\n[ C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) ] / [ (x - 3)(x + 8) ] = (4x - 23)/(x\u00b2 + 5x - 24)\n\nWait, let me check the denominator on the right side. Maybe I can factor it to see if it's the same as (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me try factoring x\u00b2 + 5x - 24.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3 because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, yes, x\u00b2 + 5x - 24 factors into (x + 8)(x - 3). So, both sides have the same denominator, which is good.\n\nTherefore, since the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nAlright, now I have this equation without denominators. Let's expand the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, since"

            "output": " this equation is true for all x except -8 and 3, the coefficients of the corresponding powers of x must be equal on both sides. That means:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: (C + D) = 4\n2. Constant term: (8C - 3D) = -23\n\nSo, I have a system of two equations with two variables, C and D. Let me write that down:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nFrom Equation 1: D = 4 - C\n\nSubstitute D into Equation 2:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8C + 3C) - 12 = -23\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, substitute back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Now, the problem asks for the product CD:\n\nCD = (-1) * 5 = -5\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, from the equations:\n\nC + D = 4\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nIf C = -1 and D = 5, plugging into Equation 1: (-1) + 5 = 4, which is correct.\n\nEquation 2: 8*(-1) - 3*5 = -8 - 15 = -23, which matches the right side. So, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll plug the values back into the original combined numerator:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = (-1)(x + 8) + 5(x - 3)\n= -x -8 + 5x -15\n= ( -x + 5x ) + ( -8 -15 )\n= 4x -"
