Plugging in the radius, the area is \\(A = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\\).\n\nNext, the area of the middle circle with radius 6 is \\(A = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\\).\n\nThen, the area of the smallest circle with radius 4 is \\(A = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\\).\n\nNow, I'll find the areas of the regions \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\) by subtracting the areas of the smaller circles from the larger ones.\n\nRegion \\(X\\) is the area between the largest and middle circles, so its area is \\(49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\\).\n\nRegion \\(Y\\) is the area between the middle and smallest circles, so its area is \\(36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\\).\n\nFinally, Region \\(Z\\) is the area of the smallest circle, which is \\(16\\pi\\).\n\nTo find the difference between the largest and smallest areas, I'll subtract the area of region \\(Z\\) from region \\(X\\): \\(13\\pi - 16\\pi = -3\\pi\\). Since we're looking for the positive difference, it's \\(3\\pi\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the areas of each region step by step.\n\n**1.
