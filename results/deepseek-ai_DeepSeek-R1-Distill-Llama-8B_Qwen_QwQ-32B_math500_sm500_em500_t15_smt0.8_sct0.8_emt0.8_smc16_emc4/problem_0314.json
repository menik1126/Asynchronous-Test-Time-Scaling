The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nHere, the leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n\\]\nFinally, adding the sum of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote gives:\n\\[\n5 + 2 = 7\n\\]\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll analyze the function step by step.\n\n### 1. **Vertical Asymptotes**\n\nThe vertical asymptotes of a rational function occur where the denominator equals zero (provided the numerator isn't also zero at those points).\n\nGiven:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\n\\]\n\nFirst, set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor the quadratic equation:\n\\[\n(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\\[\nx = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\nThus, the vertical asymptotes are"
