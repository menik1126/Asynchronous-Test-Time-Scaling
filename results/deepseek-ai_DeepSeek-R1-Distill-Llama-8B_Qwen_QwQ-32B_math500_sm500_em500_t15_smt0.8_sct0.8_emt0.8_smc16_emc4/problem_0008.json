Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so \\( P(x) \\) looks like \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) for some constants \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). I need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nThe problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). When it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we know that \\( P(0) = 5 \\).\n\nHmm, let me recall some polynomial division concepts. When you divide a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) by another polynomial \\( D(x) \\), you get a quotient \\( Q(x) \\) and a remainder \\( R(x) \\) such that \\( P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x) \\), and the degree of \\( R(x) \\) is less than the degree of \\( D(x) \\).\n\nIn this case, the divisors are \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) and \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), both of which are quadratic polynomials. So, the remainders \\( R(x) \\) should be of degree less than 2, meaning they are linear polynomials. Let me denote \\( R(x) = mx + n \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants to be determined.\n\nSo, from the first division, \\( P(x) = Q_1(x)(x - 1)(x - 4) + R(x) \\). When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) = mx + n \\).\n\nFrom the second division, \\( P(x) = Q_2(x)(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2R(x) \\). Here, the remainder is \\( 2R(x) = 2(mx + n) = "

So, \\( R(0) = m*0 + n = n \\). Therefore, \\( R(0) = n = P(0) - something? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, \\( R(0) \\) is just \\( n \\), and \\( P(0) = Q_1(0)(something) + R(0) \\). But since \\( Q_1(0) \\) is some constant, unless we know more about \\( Q_1(0) \\), it's not directly helpful. But we do know \\( c = 5 \\), so maybe we can find \\( R(x) \\) in terms of \\( P(x) \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem says that the remainder when a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( x - a \\) is \\( P(a) \\). But in this case, we're dividing by quadratic polynomials, so the remainder is a linear polynomial.\n\nBut perhaps I can evaluate \\( P(1) \\), \\( P(4) \\), \\( P(2) \\), and \\( P(3) \\) using the given remainders.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n1. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). So:\n\n\\( P(1) = R(1) = m*1 + n = m + n \\)\n\\( P(4) = R(4) = m*4 + n = 4m + n \\)\n\n2. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n \\). So:\n\n\\( P(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(2m + n) = 4m + 2n \\)\n\\( P(3) = 2R(3) = 2*("
