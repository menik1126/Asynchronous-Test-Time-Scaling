            "output": "Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So, we can write \\( P(x) \\) as \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants we need to find.\n\nThe problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). And when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we know that \\( P(0) = 5 \\). We need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me remember how polynomial division works. When you divide a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) by another polynomial \\( D(x) \\), you get a quotient \\( Q(x) \\) and a remainder \\( R(x) \\) such that \\( P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x) \\), and the degree of \\( R(x) \\) is less than the degree of \\( D(x) \\).\n\nIn this case, the first division is by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which is a quadratic polynomial, so the remainder \\( R(x) \\) must be linear, meaning it has degree 1 or 0. Similarly, the second division is by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), also quadratic, so the remainder \\( 2R(x) \\) must also be linear or constant.\n\nWait, but since \\( R(x) \\) is a remainder when divided by a quadratic, it must be of lower degree, so R(x) is of degree less than 2, meaning it's linear or constant. So, let me assume that \\( R(x) = mx + n \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants. So, the remainder when dividing by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) is \\( mx + n \\), and the remainder when dividing by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\) is \\("

When divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), we have:\n   \\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x) \\).\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( P(x) \\), setting them equal gives:\n\\( (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x) \\).\n\nHmm, maybe that's a bit too abstract. Maybe a better approach is to use the Remainder Theorem or polynomial evaluation at specific points.\n\nWait, the Remainder Theorem says that the remainder when a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - a) \\) is \\( P(a) \\). But here, we are dividing by quadratic polynomials, which means the remainder will be a linear polynomial. So, perhaps we can use this to set up equations.\n\nLet me consider that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). Then, by the Remainder Theorem applied to each factor, we can say that:\n\n\\( P(1) = R(1) = m(1) + n = m + n \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( P(4) = R(4) = 4m + n \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n \\). So,\n\n\\( P(2) = 2R(2) = 2(2m + n) = 4m + 2n \\).\n\n\\( P(3) = 2R(3) = 2(3m + n) = 6m + 2n \\).\n\nSo, now we have four"
