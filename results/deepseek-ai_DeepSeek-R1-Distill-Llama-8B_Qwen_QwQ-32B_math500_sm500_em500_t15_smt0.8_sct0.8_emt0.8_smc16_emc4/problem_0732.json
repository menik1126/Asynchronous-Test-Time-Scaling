            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm given two logarithmic equations and I need to find the value of x. Let me write down the equations again to have them clear in front of me:\n\n1. log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2. So, that's log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2.\n2. log base y of 5x equals 2. So, that's log_y(5x) = 2.\n\nHmm, okay. I think I should start by recalling some logarithm properties to simplify these equations. For the first equation, since both logs have the same base, I can use the product rule which says that log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(ac). So, applying that here, the first equation simplifies to log\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nLet me compute the product inside the log: (x - y)(x + y) is x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. So, the equation becomes log\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2.\n\nNow, what does log\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2 mean? Well, converting from logarithmic form to exponential form, it means that 6\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. Since 6 squared is 36, so x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nOkay, so that's equation (1a): x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Again, I can convert this logarithmic equation to exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that here, we get y\u00b2 = 5x.\n\nSo, equation (2a): y\u00b2 = 5x.\n\nAlright, now I have two equations: x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36 and y\u00b2 = 5x. It looks like I can substitute y\u00b2 from the second equation into the first one.\n\nLet me do that: Replace y\u00b2 in the first equation with 5x. So, x\u00b2 - 5x = 36.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nLet me try to solve"

            "output": " this quadratic equation for x. I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = -5, and c = -36.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4*1*(-36) = 25 + 144 = 169.\n\nSince the discriminant is a perfect square, the roots will be real and rational. So, sqrt(169) is 13. Now, applying the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [5 \u00b1 13] / 2.\n\nThis gives two possible solutions:\n\n1. x = (5 + 13)/2 = 18/2 = 9.\n2. x = (5 - 13)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4.\n\nHmm, okay, so x could be 9 or -4. But I need to check if both solutions are valid because sometimes when dealing with logarithms, we have domain issues\u2014like the arguments must be positive.\n\nLooking back at the original equations:\n\nFor the first equation, log\u2086(x - y) and log\u2086(x + y) must be defined. So, x - y and x + y must be positive. That means:\n\n1. x - y > 0\n2. x + y > 0\n\nAlso, in the second equation, log_y(5x) is defined. So, two things here: y must be positive and not equal to 1, and 5x must be positive. Since 5 is positive, 5x > 0 implies x > 0.\n\nSo, x has to be positive. That rules out x = -4 because that's negative. So, x must be 9.\n\nNow, let's confirm that this value satisfies all the conditions.\n\nFirst, from equation (2a): y\u00b2 = 5x. If x = 9, then y\u00b2 = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Simplifying sqrt(45) gives 3*sqrt(5).\n\nBut we also need to check the domain conditions for the first equation.\n\nx + y > 0 and x - y > 0.\n\nSince x is 9, let's check:\n\nCase 1: y = 3\u221a5. So, plugging in:\n\nx"

So, 9 - 6.708 \u2248 2.292, which is positive.\n\nx + y = 9 + 6.708 \u2248 15.708, which is also positive. So that's okay.\n\nCase 2: y = -3\u221a5. Then:\n\nx - y = 9 - (-3\u221a5) = 9 + 3\u221a5 \u2248 9 + 6.708 \u2248 15.708, which is positive.\n\nx + y = 9 + (-3\u221a5) = 9 - 3\u221a5 \u2248 2.292, which is also positive. Wait, so even if y is negative, the expressions x - y and x + y are still positive?\n\nHmm, but hold on. The second equation is log_y(5x) = 2. The base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1. So, y must be positive and not 1. Since y\u00b2 = 45, y can be sqrt(45) or -sqrt(45). But if y is negative, then the base of the logarithm is negative, which is invalid. Therefore, y must be positive. So, y = sqrt(45) is the only valid solution here.\n\nTherefore, y must be positive, so y = 3\u221a5. Thus, the solution x = 9 is valid, and y = 3\u221a5.\n\nLet me check the original equations with these values to be thorough.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nlog\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = log\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = log\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). Since x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36, log\u2086(36) = log\u2086(6\u00b2) = 2, which matches the first equation.\n\nSecond equation:\n\nlog_y(5x) = log_{3\u221a5}(5*9) = log_{3\u221a5}(45). Let's see if this equals 2.\n\nLet me compute (3\u221a5)^2 = "

So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, both equations are satisfied when x = 9 and y = 3\u221a5.\n\nSo, x = 9 is the valid solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the equations:\n\n1. \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\)\n2. \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\)\n\nWe start by using the product rule of logarithms for the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = \\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = \\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\n\\]\n\nConverting this to exponential form, we get:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\n\nFor the second equation, converting to exponential form gives:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = 5x\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(y^2 = 5x\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x = 36\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\), and \\(c = -36\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 144}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm 13}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) must be positive (as determined by the domain of the logarithms), we discard \\(x = -4\\).
