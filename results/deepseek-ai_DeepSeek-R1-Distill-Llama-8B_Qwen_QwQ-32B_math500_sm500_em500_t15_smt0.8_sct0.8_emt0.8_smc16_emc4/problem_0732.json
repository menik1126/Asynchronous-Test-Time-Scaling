            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm given two logarithmic equations and I need to find the value of x. Let me write down the equations again to have them clear in front of me:\n\n1. log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2. So, that's log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2.\n2. log base y of 5x equals 2. So, that's log_y(5x) = 2.\n\nHmm, okay. I think I should start by recalling some logarithm properties to simplify these equations. For the first equation, since both logs have the same base, I can use the product rule which says that log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(ac). So, applying that here, the first equation simplifies to log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nLet me compute the product inside the log: (x - y)(x + y) is x² - y². So, the equation becomes log₆(x² - y²) = 2.\n\nNow, what does log₆(x² - y²) = 2 mean? Well, converting from logarithmic form to exponential form, it means that 6² = x² - y². Since 6 squared is 36, so x² - y² = 36.\n\nOkay, so that's equation (1a): x² - y² = 36.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Again, I can convert this logarithmic equation to exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that here, we get y² = 5x.\n\nSo, equation (2a): y² = 5x.\n\nAlright, now I have two equations: x² - y² = 36 and y² = 5x. It looks like I can substitute y² from the second equation into the first one.\n\nLet me do that: Replace y² in the first equation with 5x. So, x² - 5x = 36.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: x² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nLet me try to solve"

            "output": " this quadratic equation for x. I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = -5, and c = -36.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: b² - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4*1*(-36) = 25 + 144 = 169.\n\nSince the discriminant is a perfect square, the roots will be real and rational. So, sqrt(169) is 13. Now, applying the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [5 ± 13] / 2.\n\nThis gives two possible solutions:\n\n1. x = (5 + 13)/2 = 18/2 = 9.\n2. x = (5 - 13)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4.\n\nHmm, okay, so x could be 9 or -4. But I need to check if both solutions are valid because sometimes when dealing with logarithms, we have domain issues—like the arguments must be positive.\n\nLooking back at the original equations:\n\nFor the first equation, log₆(x - y) and log₆(x + y) must be defined. So, x - y and x + y must be positive. That means:\n\n1. x - y > 0\n2. x + y > 0\n\nAlso, in the second equation, log_y(5x) is defined. So, two things here: y must be positive and not equal to 1, and 5x must be positive. Since 5 is positive, 5x > 0 implies x > 0.\n\nSo, x has to be positive. That rules out x = -4 because that's negative. So, x must be 9.\n\nNow, let's confirm that this value satisfies all the conditions.\n\nFirst, from equation (2a): y² = 5x. If x = 9, then y² = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Simplifying sqrt(45) gives 3*sqrt(5).\n\nBut we also need to check the domain conditions for the first equation.\n\nx + y > 0 and x - y > 0.\n\nSince x is 9, let's check:\n\nCase 1: y = 3√5. So, plugging in:\n\nx"

            "output": " - y = 9 - 3√5. Since √5 is approximately 2.236, so 3*2.236 ≈ 6.708. So, 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292, which is positive.\n\nx + y = 9 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708, which is also positive. So that's okay.\n\nCase 2: y = -3√5. Then:\n\nx - y = 9 - (-3√5) = 9 + 3√5 ≈ 9 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708, which is positive.\n\nx + y = 9 + (-3√5) = 9 - 3√5 ≈ 2.292, which is also positive. Wait, so even if y is negative, the expressions x - y and x + y are still positive?\n\nHmm, but hold on. The second equation is log_y(5x) = 2. The base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1. So, y must be positive and not 1. Since y² = 45, y can be sqrt(45) or -sqrt(45). But if y is negative, then the base of the logarithm is negative, which is invalid. Therefore, y must be positive. So, y = sqrt(45) is the only valid solution here.\n\nTherefore, y must be positive, so y = 3√5. Thus, the solution x = 9 is valid, and y = 3√5.\n\nLet me check the original equations with these values to be thorough.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nlog₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = log₆(x² - y²). Since x² - y² = 36, log₆(36) = log₆(6²) = 2, which matches the first equation.\n\nSecond equation:\n\nlog_y(5x) = log_{3√5}(5*9) = log_{3√5}(45). Let's see if this equals 2.\n\nLet me compute (3√5)^2 = "
