Substituting this back into the equation, it becomes \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(8\\). This results in \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\), which simplifies to \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nNow, I recognize that \\(9\\) is equal to \\(3^2\\). Therefore, the equation becomes \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other.
