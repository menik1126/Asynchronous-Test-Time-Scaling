There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and each of the two letter positions must be different. For the first letter, there are 26 possible choices, and for the second letter, there are 25 remaining choices since it must be different from the first.\n\nNext, I'll consider the numerical part of the license plate. There are 10 possible digits (0-9), and each of the two digit positions must also be different. For the first digit, there are 10 possible choices, and for the second digit, there are 9 remaining choices.\n\nTo find the total number of combinations, I'll multiply the number of possibilities for each part together. This means multiplying the number of choices for the letters by the number of choices for the digits.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the total number of license plates by multiplying these two results: 26 * 25 * 10 * 9, which equals 65,000 possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure of the License Plate:**\n   - **Letters:** 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by\n   - **Numbers:** 2 different one-digit numbers (0-9)\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Possible Combinations for Letters:**\n   - **First Letter:** There are 26 possible choices (A-Z).\n   - **Second Letter:** Since it must be different from the first, there are 25 remaining choices.\n   \n   **Total Combinations for Letters:** \\(26 \\times 25 = 650\\) possible letter combinations.\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Possible Combinations for Numbers:**\n   - **First Digit:** There are 10 possible choices (0-9).\n   - **Second Digit:** Since it must be different from the first, there are 9 remaining choices.\n   \n   **Total Combinations for Numbers:** \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\) possible digit combinations.\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Number of License Plates:**\n   - Multiply the total combinations for letters by the total combinations for numbers.\n   \n   **Total License Plates:** \\(650 \\times 90 = 58,500\\)\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the calculation, it appears there was an error in the"

Let's correct it:\n\n- **Correct Total License Plates:** \\(26 \\times 25 \\times 10 \\times 9 = 26 \\times 25 = 650\\), then \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\), so \\(650 \\times 90 = 58,500\\). Wait, this contradicts the initial reasoning. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the initial reasoning stated 65,000, but the correct calculation is \\(26 \\times 25 = 650\\) for letters and \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\) for numbers. Multiplying these gives \\(650 \\times 90 = 58,500\\). The mistake was in the initial conclusion. The correct total is 58,500.\n\nBut let me verify again step-by-step:\n\n- Letters: 26 * 25 = 650\n- Numbers: 10 * 9 = 90\n- Total: 650 * 90 = 58,500\n\nYes, that is correct. The final answer should be 58,500.\n\n\\boxed{58500}\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me recalculate once more to ensure no arithmetic errors:\n\n26 * 25 = 650 (correct)\n\n10 * 9 = 90 (correct)\n\n650 * 90: \n\n650 * 90 = (600 * 90) + (50 * 90) = 54,000 + 4,500 = 58,500. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 58,500. The initial reasoning had a mistake in the final number (65,000), but the step-by-step calculation here is accurate.\n\n\\boxed{58500}"
