            "output": "I need to determine how many treeks equal the weight of one squig based on the given relationships.\n\nFirst, I'll define variables for clarity. Let T represent the weight of one treek, S for one squig, and G for one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement: Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This translates to 10T = 3S + G.\n\nFrom the second statement: Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This can be written as 2T + G = S.\n\nMy goal is to find the number of treeks that equals the weight of one squig, which means I need to solve for T in terms of S.\n\nI'll substitute S from the second equation into the first equation. Since S = 2T + G, I'll replace S in 10T = 3S + G with this expression.\n\nThis gives me 10T = 3(2T + G) + G. Next, I'll expand the right side: 10T = 6T + 3G + G, which simplifies to 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides results in 4T = 4G. Dividing both sides by 4 gives T = G.\n\nNow that I know T equals G, I can substitute back into the second equation S = 2T + G. Since T = G, this becomes S = 2T + T, which simplifies to S = 3T.\n\nTherefore, one squig weighs the same as three treeks. This means the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks (T) weigh as much as three squigs (S) and one goolee (G):\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\n**Objective:** Find out how many treeks equal the weight of one squig.\n\n**Step 1:** Express S from the second equation:\n\\[\nS = 2T + G\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:**"
