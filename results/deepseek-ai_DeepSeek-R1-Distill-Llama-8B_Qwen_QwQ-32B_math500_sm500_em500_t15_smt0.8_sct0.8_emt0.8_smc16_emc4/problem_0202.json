            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Maybe I can use that here. \n\nThe Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has the numerator \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and the denominator \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots should be the factors of -14. \n\nWhat are the factors of -14? Let me list them out. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, 14, and their negative counterparts as well. So the possible integer roots are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nAlright, so I have a finite list of possible roots to test. Maybe I can start plugging in these values into the equation and see if any of them satisfy it, meaning the equation equals zero.\n\nLet me start with x = 1. Plugging in x = 1:\n\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14\\).\n\nCalculating that: 1 + 5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0. Oh, so x=1 is a root. Nice!\n\nNow, since x=1 is a root, that means (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. Maybe I can perform polynomial division to factor out (x - 1) from the original equation. That might make it easier to find other roots.\n\nLet me set up the division: divide \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14\\) by (x - 1). Alternatively, I could use synthetic division because the divisor is linear.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 1:\n\nI'll write down the coefficients: 1 (for x^4), 5 (for x^3), 9"

Add to next coefficient: 9 + 6 = 15.\n\nMultiply 15 by 1: 15*1=15. Add to next coefficient: -1 + 15 = 14.\n\nMultiply 14 by 1: 14*1=14. Add to last coefficient: -14 + 14 = 0.\n\nSo, the result of the division is \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\). So the polynomial factors into (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14). Now, I need to find the roots of the cubic polynomial \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\).\n\nAgain, let me apply the Rational Root Theorem. The constant term is 14, and leading coefficient is 1, so possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nTesting x = -1: (-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 15(-1) + 14 = -1 + 6 -15 +14. Calculating: -1 +6=5, 5-15=-10, -10+14=4. Not zero.\n\nx = -2: (-2)^3 +6(-2)^2 +15(-2) +14 = -8 +24 -30 +14. Adding up: -8 +24=16, 16-30=-14, -14+14=0. So x=-2 is a root.\n\nGreat, so now I can factor out (x + 2) from the cubic polynomial. Let's perform synthetic division again with x = -2.\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^3), 6 (x^2), 15 (x), 14.\n\nBring down the 1. Multiply by -2: 1*(-2)= -2. Add to next coefficient: 6 + (-2) =4.\n\nMultiply 4 by -2: 4*(-2) = -8. Add to next coefficient:"

Therefore, the original polynomial is now factored as (x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, I have a quadratic left: \\(x^2 +4x +7\\). Let me check if this quadratic has integer roots. Again, applying the Rational Root Theorem: possible roots are ±1, ±7.\n\nTesting x= -1: (-1)^2 +4*(-1) +7=1 -4 +7=4. Not zero.\n\nx= -7: (-7)^2 +4*(-7) +7=49 -28 +7=28. Also not zero.\n\nx=1: 1 +4 +7=12, not zero.\n\nx=7: 49 +28 +7=84. Nope.\n\nSo, the quadratic doesn't have integer roots. Therefore, the only integer roots of the original equation are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nI tested x=1, which worked, and x=-2, which also worked. The quadratic doesn't have integer roots because the discriminant is \\(16 - 28 = -12\\), which is negative, so no real roots, let alone integer ones.\n\nSo, yeah, the integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nI should probably check if I made any calculation mistakes in the synthetic divisions or in substituting the roots. Let me verify x=1 again:\n\nOriginal polynomial: \\(1 +5 +9 -1 -14= 1+5=6, 6+9=15, 15-1=14, 14-14=0\\). Correct.\n\nx=-2: \\((-2)^4 +5(-2)^3 +9(-2)^2 -(-2) -14 = 16 +5*(-8) +9*4 +2 -14.\n\nCalculating: 16 -40 = -24, -24 +36=12, 12 +2=14, 14-14=0. Correct.\n\nQuadratic equation: discriminant is \\(4^2 - 4*"
