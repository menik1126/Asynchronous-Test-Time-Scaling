Observing the decimal, I notice that the digits repeat \"000291\" over and over.\n\nFinally, I count the number of digits that repeat, which is 6.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of repeating digits in the decimal representation of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Perform the Division:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111} \\approx 0.0020002916234...\n   \\]\n   This decimal starts with \\( 0.002 \\) and then repeats the sequence \\( 000291 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Repeating Sequence:**\n   - After the initial non-repeating part \\( 0.002 \\), the digits \\( 000291 \\) repeat indefinitely.\n   - The length of this repeating sequence is **6 digits**.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   The repeating part of the decimal \\( 0.002\\overline{000291} \\) has **6 digits** that repeat.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"

How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\nFor example, if you get the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{123},$ then your answer should be $3,$ and if you get $0.436\\overline{7},$ your answer should be $1.$"
