            "output": "First, I identify the given information. The steel sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is 6 inches. The sphere is formed by cutting off the corners of a cube with the shortest possible side lengths.\n\nNext, I recall that cutting off a corner of a cube (which is a right-angled isosceles triangle) from each of its eight corners will form the sphere. The volume of the cube is initially unknown, so I need to determine the relationship between the cube's side length and the sphere's volume.\n\nI know that the volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula \\( V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius. Plugging in the radius of 3 inches, the sphere's volume becomes \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = 36\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n\nSince the cube's corners are being cut off to form the sphere, the volume of the cube will be slightly larger than the volume of the sphere. However, the problem asks for the cube's original volume before any metal was removed. Therefore, I set the cube's volume equal to the sphere's volume.\n\nThus, the volume of the cube is \\( 36\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Shape Transformation:**\n   - A sphere is created by cutting off the corners of a cube.\n   - Each corner cut-off is a right-angled isosceles triangle.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sphere's Volume:**\n   - **Radius of the Sphere (r):** 3 inches\n   - **Volume of the Sphere (\\( V_{sphere} \\)):**\n     \\[\n     V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Relate the Cube's Volume to the Sphere:**\n   - The original cube is reduced by removing material from its corners to form the sphere.\n   - The volume removed is equal to the volume of the cube minus the sphere's volume.\n   - Since the cube's side length is \"shortened to the shortest possible,\" the cube's volume equals the sphere's"
