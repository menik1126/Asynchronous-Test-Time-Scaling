            "output": "First, I need to find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets.\n\nI know that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. So, I can start by converting Drinkets to Blinkets. If 7 Drinkets equal 3 Blinkets, then 56 Drinkets equal (56 ÷ 7) × 3 Blinkets.\n\nCalculating that, 56 divided by 7 is 8. So, 8 × 3 equals 24 Blinkets.\n\nNow, I need to convert Blinkets to Trinkets. Since 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, I can divide the number of Blinkets by 4 to find the equivalent in Trinkets. Therefore, 24 Blinkets divided by 4 equals 6 Trinkets.\n\nSo, 56 Drinkets are worth 6 Trinkets in the land of Ink.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the given conversions:**\n   - **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**\n   - **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**\n\n2. **Convert Drinkets to Blinkets:**\n   - Since **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**, we can find how many Blinkets are in 56 Drinkets by dividing:\n     ```\n     56 Drinkets ÷ 7 Drinkets/Blinket = 8 Blinkets\n     ```\n   - So, 56 Drinkets = 8 Blinkets.\n\n3. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:**\n   - Since **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**, we'll divide the number of Blinkets by 4 to find the equivalent in Trinkets:\n     ```\n     8 Blinkets ÷ 4 Blinkets/Trinket = 2 Trinkets\n     ```\n   \n4. **Final Conversion:**\n   - Therefore, **56 Drinkets = 2 Trinkets**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{2}"
