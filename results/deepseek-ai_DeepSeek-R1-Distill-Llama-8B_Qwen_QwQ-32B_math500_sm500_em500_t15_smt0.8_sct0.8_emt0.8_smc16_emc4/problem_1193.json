The variables k and 3k are like terms, so I'll add them together. Similarly, the constant numbers 4 and -2 are like terms and can be combined.\n\nAfter combining the variables, I have -k + 3k, which equals 2k. Then, combining the constants, 4 minus 2 equals 2.\n\nFinally, I'll write the simplified expression as 2k + 2.\n</think>\n\nLet's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Remove the parentheses**\n\n\\[\n(-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k)\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Combine like terms**\n\n\\[\n(-k + 3k) + (4 - 2)\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the coefficients**\n\n\\[\n2k + 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Simplified Expression:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2k + 2}\n\\]"
