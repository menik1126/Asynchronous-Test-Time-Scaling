I need to find the number of boys attending.\n\nFirst, I'll define variables. Let G represent the number of girls, and B represent the number of boys.\n\nSince the total number of students is 35, I can write the equation:\nG + B = 35\n\nAdditionally, it's given that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. So, G can be 13, 26, 39, and so on. However, since the total number of students is only 35, I should find the possible values of G that fit within this constraint.\n\nConsidering the first multiple of 13, which is 13, if G = 13, then:\nB = 35 - 13 = 22\n\nNext, checking the next multiple of 13, which is 26:\nB = 35 - 26 = 9\n\nThe next multiple would be 39, but subtracting that from 35 would result in a negative number of boys, which isn't possible. So, the valid possibilities for the number of girls are 13 and 26, leading to 22 and 9 boys respectively.\n\nNow, it's also given that there are more girls than boys. Comparing the two scenarios:\n- If G = 26, then B = 9, which satisfies G > B.\n- If G = 13, then B = 22, which does not satisfy G > B since 13 < 22.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible solution is when the number of girls is 26 and the number of boys is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Equation:**\n\\[ G + B = 35 \\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n1. \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13.
