I'll check previous terms to ensure none between Term 8 and Term 12 exceed 125.\n\nReviewing the terms:\n- Term 8: 31\n- Term 9: 36\n- Term 10: 180\n- Term 11: 186\n\nNone of these terms between Term 8 and Term 11 exceed 125, so the first term that surpasses 125 is Term 12, which is 1116.\n\nTherefore, the first term greater than 125 in the sequence is 1116.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to find the first term greater than 125.\n\n1. **Initial Terms:**\n   - **Term 1:** 0\n   - **Term 2:** 0 + 1 = 1\n   - **Term 3:** 1 × 1 = 1\n   - **Term 4:** 1 + 2 = 3\n   - **Term 5:** 3 × 2 = 6\n   - **"

    "question": "In the sequence 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, ..., the first term is 0.   Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and  multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1.  For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.  What is the value of the first term that is greater than 125?",
