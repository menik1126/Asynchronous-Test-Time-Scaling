            "output": "Okay, so I've got this expression to simplify: the square root of (5 divided by the square root of 80 plus the square root of 845 over 9 plus the square root of 45) all divided by the square root of 5. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that simplifying radicals is often about breaking down the numbers inside into factors that are perfect squares. Perfect squares make it easier because their square roots are whole numbers. So let me look at each term inside the main square root one by one.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 divided by the square root of 80. I can rewrite square roots as exponents, so sqrt(80) is the same as 80^(1/2). Maybe that helps? Not sure yet, but let me see if I can factor 80 into something else. 80 can be broken down into 16 times 5 because 16 is a perfect square. So sqrt(80) = sqrt(16*5) = sqrt(16)*sqrt(5) = 4*sqrt(5). So then, 5 divided by sqrt(80) becomes 5/(4*sqrt(5)). Hmm, that might be helpful.\n\nNext term: sqrt(845) over 9. Let me see if 845 has any factors that are perfect squares. 845 divided by 5 is 169. Oh, 169 is 13 squared, which is a perfect square. So sqrt(845) = sqrt(5*169) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(169) = 13*sqrt(5). So this term becomes (13*sqrt(5))/9.\n\nThird term: sqrt(45). Again, 45 can be broken down into 9*5. So sqrt(45) = sqrt(9*5) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator inside the main square root is:\n\n5/(4*sqrt(5)) + (13*sqrt(5))/9 + 3*sqrt(5).\n\nI need to combine these terms. To do that, they should have a common denominator. I see that the first term has a denominator of 4*sqrt(5), the second and third terms have denominators of 9 and 1, respectively, but they have sqrt(5) as part"

            "output": " of the numerator. Maybe I can express all terms with sqrt(5) in the numerator and then combine them?\n\nLet me first simplify the first term: 5/(4*sqrt(5)). Since there's a sqrt(5) in the denominator, I can rationalize the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5):\n\n(5 * sqrt(5)) / (4 * sqrt(5) * sqrt(5)) = (5*sqrt(5))/(4*5) = (sqrt(5))/4. Oh, that's simpler! So the first term simplifies to sqrt(5)/4.\n\nSo now the numerator becomes:\n\nsqrt(5)/4 + (13*sqrt(5))/9 + 3*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, all terms have sqrt(5) in them, so I can factor that out:\n\nsqrt(5) * [1/4 + 13/9 + 3].\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients inside the brackets. Let me convert them all to fractions with a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) of 4 and 9 is 36. So:\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\n3 = 3/1 = 108/36.\n\nAdding them together: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = (169)/36.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 9 + 52 is 61, and 61 + 108 is 169. Yeah, that's right. So the total inside the brackets is 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator of the big fraction is sqrt(5) multiplied by 169/36. So numerator = (169/36)*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, the entire expression is the square root of [ (169/36)*sqrt(5) divided by sqrt(5) ].\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is sqrt( [numerator] / sqrt(5) ). So the entire numerator we just found is divided by sqrt(5), and then we take"

            "output": " the square root of that result.\n\nSo let me write that out:\n\nsqrt( [ (169/36)*sqrt(5) ] / sqrt(5) )\n\nSimplify the division inside: sqrt(5) divided by sqrt(5) is 1. Because sqrt(5)/sqrt(5) = 1. So it's sqrt( (169/36)*1 ) = sqrt(169/36).\n\nNow, sqrt(169/36) is sqrt(169)/sqrt(36) = 13/6.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. Because when you divide two square roots, you can combine them, right? So sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(a/b). So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo that simplifies down to 13/6.\n\nWait, hold on, is there any chance I made a mistake in simplifying the numerator? Let me double-check.\n\nStarting over, after simplifying the first term: 5/(4*sqrt(5)) to sqrt(5)/4, that seems correct. Because 5/(4*sqrt(5)) = (sqrt(5)/4) after rationalizing.\n\nThen, the second term is (13*sqrt(5))/9 and the third is 3*sqrt(5). So combining them, yes, I factored sqrt(5) out, getting sqrt(5) times [1/4 + 13/9 + 3]. Converting to 36 denominator: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169, so 169/36. Thus, the numerator is (169/36)*sqrt(5).\n\nThen, dividing by sqrt(5): (169/36)*sqrt(5)/sqrt(5) = 169/36. So taking the square root of that gives sqrt(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nThat seems correct. Hmm, so is 13/6 the simplified fraction? It should be.\n\nWait, just to think through again, maybe I made an error in calculation. Let me recapitulate:\n\n1. Simplify each term in the numerator:\n\n   a. 5/sqrt(80) = 5/(4*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)/4 after rationalizing.\n\n   b. sqrt(845)/9 = 13*sqrt(5)/9.\n\n   c. sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\n"

Compute the coefficients:\n\n   1/4 is 0.25, 13/9 is approximately 1.444..., and 3 is 3. Adding them: 0.25 + 1.444 + 3 ≈ 4.694...\n\n   But 169/36 is approximately 4.694..., so that's correct.\n\n4.

So the simplified fraction is 13/6. Therefore, the answer should be boxed as \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{6}}.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more.
