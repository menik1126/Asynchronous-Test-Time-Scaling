            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of people in the Senate committee. There are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, making a total of 11 members.\n\nNext, since the committee members must all sit around a circular table, I should consider circular permutations for the arrangement. In circular permutations, the arrangement is considered the same if it can be rotated into another position. For a group of \\( n \\) people, the number of distinct circular arrangements is \\( (n-1)! \\).\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that members of each party must sit next to each other. This means that the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent will form three distinct blocks. Therefore, I need to calculate the number of ways to arrange these blocks around the table.\n\nSince the arrangement is circular, the number of ways to arrange \\( k \\) blocks is \\( (k-1)! \\). In this case, there are 3 blocks, so the number of ways to arrange them is \\( 2! = 2 \\).\n\nNow, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways, for the Republicans, also 5!, and for the Independent, there's only 1! way since there's only one person.\n\nFinally, I need to multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the members within each block. So, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is \\( 2 \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1! \\).\n\nCalculating the factorial values:\n\n\\( 5! = 120 \\)\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements is \\( 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 \\times 1 = 28,800 \\).\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of ways the Senate committee members can be seated around a circular table with the condition that all members of each party sit next to each other. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Total Members:**\n   - Democrats: 5\n   - Republicans: 5\n   - Independent: 1\n   - **Total members = 5 + 5 + 1 = 11**\n\n2. **Circular Arrangements:**\n   - Since the table is circular, the number of distinct arrangements of \\( n \\) people is \\( (n-1)! \\).\n   -"
