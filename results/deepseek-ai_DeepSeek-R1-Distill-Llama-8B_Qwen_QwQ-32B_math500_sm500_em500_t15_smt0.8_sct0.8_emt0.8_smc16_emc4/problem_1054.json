It's given that the polynomial has integer coefficients, and I need to find the number of different possible rational roots. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember something called the Rational Root Theorem. Wasn't that the one that helps find possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients? Yeah, I think so. Let me recall how it works. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, applying the theorem, the possible values for p would be factors of 1, and q would be factors of 2. Let me write that down to be clear.\n\nFactors of the constant term (1): The factors of 1 are just \u00b11, right? Because 1 only has 1 and -1 as its divisors. Factors of the leading coefficient (2): The factors of 2 are \u00b11 and \u00b12.\n\nSo, according to the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the combinations of p over q, which would be \u00b11 divided by 1 or 2. Let me list them out:\n\n1. p = 1, q = 1: 1/1 = 1\n2. p = -1, q = 1: -1/1 = -1\n3. p = 1, q = 2: 1/2\n4. p = -1, q = 2: -1/2\n\nWait, so that gives me four possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. Are these all distinct? Yes, each one is different from the others. So, does that mean there are 4 different possible rational roots?\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The constant term is 1, so its factors are only \u00b11, and the leading coefficient is 2, so factors are \u00b11, \u00b12. Therefore, the possible p/q combinations are indeed \u00b11 and \u00b11/2. So that's 1,"

So, their combinations in the form p/q give exactly four possible rational roots.\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial has integer coefficients, and we apply the Rational Root Theorem. The constant term is 1, leading to possible roots \u00b11, and the leading coefficient is 2, leading to possible denominators 1 and 2. Thus, the possible rational roots are \u00b11 and \u00b11/2, totaling 4 distinct possibilities.\n\nNumber of different possible rational roots: 4.\n\n\\boxed{4}"
