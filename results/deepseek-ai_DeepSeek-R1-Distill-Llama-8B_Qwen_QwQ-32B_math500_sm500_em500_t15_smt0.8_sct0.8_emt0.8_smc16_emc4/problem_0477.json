Let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that in algebra, when dealing with symmetric equations like these, it might be helpful to use symmetric sums or maybe even think about Vieta's formulas. But I'm not entirely sure how that applies here. Let me write down what I know.\n\nSo, the variables \\( x, y, z \\) are connected by these equations. The first equation is straightforward: the product of the three variables is 4. The second equation is the sum of their cubes equaling 4. The third one is a bit more complicated\u2014it's a sum of terms where each term is a product of two variables, one squared and the other not.\n\nWait, let me parse the third equation more carefully. It says:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, so it's the sum of each pair of variables multiplied by the sum of the other two variables? Let me check:\n\n- \\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(x + y) \\)\n- \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(x + z) \\)\n- \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(y + z) \\)\n\nYes, so the third equation is equal to \\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\).\n\nI wonder if there's a way to relate this to symmetric sums. Maybe I should denote some symmetric sums to make it easier.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- \\( s_1 = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( s_2 = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( s_"

Maybe I can use that here.\n\nLooking at the second equation: \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\).\n\nI recall that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( s_1, s_2, s_3 \\). The formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 3 s_3 \\)\n\nSo plugging in what we know:\n\n\\( 4 = s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 3 * 4 \\)\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 4 = s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 12 \\)\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\( s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 = 4 - 12 \\)\n\\( s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 = -8 \\)\n\nAlright, so that's one equation involving \\( s_1 \\) and \\( s_2 \\). Let's see if we can get another equation.\n\nLooking at the third equation: \\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can express this in terms of the symmetric sums.\n\nFirst, note that \\( xy(x + y) = xy s_1 - xy^2 \\). Wait, no, wait. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, note that \\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\) can be written as \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - (x^3 + y^3 + z^3) \\).

Let's compute the given third equation:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z \\).\n\nSo, this is equal to \\( x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y \\).\n\nWhich is actually equal to \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz \\).

Let me count:\n\nEach term in \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) \\) gives all possible products where one variable is squared and multiplied by another variable. So, for example, from x*(xy) = x^2 y, from x*(yz) = x y z, from x*(zx) = x^2 z.

So total:\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) + 3xyz \\).\n\nTherefore, the given third equation is:\n\n\\( (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12 \\).\n\nTherefore, substituting from the above equation:\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12 \\).\n\nSo, substituting the known value of \\( xyz = 4 \\):\n\n\\( s_1 s_2 - 3 * 4 = 12 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( s_1 s_2 - 12 = 12 \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( s_1 s_2 = 24 \\)\n\nOkay, so now we have two equations involving \\( s_1 \\) and \\( s_2 \\):\n\n1. \\( s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 = -8 \\)\n2. \\( s_1 s_2 = 24 \\)\n\nHmm, so let's substitute equation 2 into equation 1. Since \\( s_1 s_2 = 24 \\), then \\( 3 s_1 s_2 = 72 \\). Therefore, equation 1 becomes:\n\n\\( s_1^3 - 72 = -8 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( s_1^3 = 72 - 8 = 64 \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( s_1 = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\)\n\nSo, \\( s_1 = 4 \\).\n\nNow, since \\( s_1 s_2 = 24 \\), then \\( s_2 = 24 / s_1 = 24 / 4 = 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( xy + yz + zx = s_2 = 6 \\).\n\nWait, so is that the answer?

Plugging in the values:\n\n\\( 4 = s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 12 \\)\n\nWhich simplified to \\( s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 = -8 \\).
