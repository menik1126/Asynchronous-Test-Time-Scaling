            "output": "To find out how many zeros are at the end of 42! , I need to determine how many times the factor 10 is a factor in 42! . Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, and there are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial's prime factors, the number of zeros at the end is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in 42!.\n\nNext, I'll divide 42 by 5, which gives me 8. This means there are 8 multiples of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 42. Each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5 to the prime factorization.\n\nHowever, some numbers contribute more than one 5. Specifically, multiples of 25 (which is 5 squared) contribute an additional 5. To find out how many numbers contribute two 5s, I'll divide 42 by 25, which gives me 1. This means there's 1 number (25 itself) that adds an extra 5 to the total count.\n\nAdding these together, I have 8 fives from the initial division by 5 and 1 extra five from the division by 25, making a total of 9 fives in the prime factorization of 42! .\n\nSince there are more than enough 2s to pair with these 9 fives, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is equal to the number of 5s, which is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeros are at the end of \\(42!\\) (42 factorial), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), the number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\).\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of 5s\nFor any factorial \\(n!\\), the number of times **5** is a factor can be calculated by:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots"

Thus, there are **9** factors of 5 in \\(42!\\).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of 2s\nSimilarly, the number of **2s** in \\(42!\\) is calculated by:\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n\\]\nHowever, since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Final Answer\nSince the number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s, and we already found there are **9** 5s, the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is **9**.\n\n\\boxed{9}"
