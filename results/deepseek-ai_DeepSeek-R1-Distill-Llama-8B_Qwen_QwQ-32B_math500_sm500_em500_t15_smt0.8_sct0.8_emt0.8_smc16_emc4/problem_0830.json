            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x³ - 1 = 0. So, factoring that, we get (x - 1)(x² + x + 1) = 0. Therefore, the roots are x = 1 and the roots of x² + x + 1 = 0. Those roots are complex numbers, right?\n\nLet me denote the roots of x² + x + 1 = 0 as ω and ω². So, the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1. I remember that for these roots, certain properties hold, like 1 + ω + ω² = 0 and ω³ = 1. Maybe these properties can help me simplify the given expression.\n\nThe expression I need to evaluate is S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I think I can combine these two fractions into a single fraction to simplify. To do that, I'll need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nS = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nSimplifying the numerator: 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nNow, the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's expand that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut wait, ω³ is equal to 1 because ω³ = 1. So, substituting that in, we get:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo, both"

            "output": " the numerator and the denominator of S are equal to 2 + ω + ω². That means S = (2 + ω + ω²)/(2 + ω + ω²). Hmm, but that would imply S = 1? But wait, that can't be right because 2 + ω + ω² is in both numerator and denominator.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check that expansion. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nAnd since ω³ = 1, that becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1, which is 2 + ω + ω². So yes, the denominator is 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo, S = (2 + ω + ω²)/(2 + ω + ω²) = 1. So, is S equal to 1? But I feel like that might not capture all possible values because ω can be either of the two non-real cube roots of unity. Wait, but regardless of ω being ω or ω², 2 + ω + ω² is the same because it's symmetric in ω and ω². Since 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (ω + ω²). But since ω + ω² = -1, then 2 + (-1) = 1. Oh, so 2 + ω + ω² = 1. So then S is numerator 1 divided by denominator 1, which is still 1. So S = 1?\n\nWait, but hold on. If 1 + ω + ω² = 0, then ω + ω² = -1. So 2 + ω + ω² = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nTherefore, S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = (1 + ω² + 1 + ω)/(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = (2 + ω + ω²)/(1 + ω + ω² + ω³).\n\nBut wait, I think earlier I did it correctly.\n\nWait, let's rederive it step by step.\n\nGiven:\n\nS = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 +"

Therefore, the only possible value is 1?\n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me try plugging in actual values. Let me compute numerically.\n\nLet me recall that the cube roots of unity are 1, and the other two are complex numbers. Let me write ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2, and ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nLet me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω: 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2).

If we take ω² instead of ω, we should get similar results because of symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, is there another approach? Maybe using the identity of cube roots of unity.\n\nI also remember that for ω ≠ 1, 1 + ω + ω² = 0, which we used earlier. Additionally, ω² = ω*, the complex conjugate of ω.\n\nWait, in the expression S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²), since ω² is the conjugate of ω, the expression S is the sum of two complex conjugate terms. Therefore, S must be a real number.\n\nIn our calculation, S was 1, which is real. So, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider whether there are multiple values or just one. From the calculation, whether ω is the primitive cube root or the other one, you get the same result. So, regardless, S = 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should manipulate the expression without substituting the roots.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nGiven ω³ = 1, so ω ≠ 1. Therefore, 1 + ω + ω² = 0"

Therefore, 1/ω = ω² and 1/ω² = ω.\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nS = - (ω² + ω) = - (ω + ω²).\n\nBut from the identity 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we have ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, S = -(-1) = 1.
