            "output": "To solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\), I will first calculate \\(2^3\\), which equals 8.\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate \\(3^x\\). This simplifies the equation to \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\), which is \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nNow, I'll express 9 as a power of 3: \\(9 = 3^2\\). This means the equation becomes \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.
