            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of (5 over sqrt(80) plus sqrt(845) over 9 plus sqrt(45), all divided by sqrt(5)). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify each of the square roots in the numerator. Let me start with sqrt(80). I know that 80 can be broken down into 16 times 5 because 16*5 is 80. And since sqrt(16*5) is sqrt(16)*sqrt(5), that's 4*sqrt(5). So, 5 over sqrt(80) is the same as 5 over 4*sqrt(5). Hmm, maybe I can simplify that further.\n\nWait, 5 over 4*sqrt(5). I can write 5 as sqrt(25), so it becomes sqrt(25)/sqrt(5). Using the property that sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) is sqrt(a/b), so that's sqrt(25/5) which is sqrt(5). So, 5/sqrt(80) simplifies to sqrt(5). Cool, that part is done.\n\nNext, let's look at sqrt(845). I need to factor 845 to find any perfect squares. Let me try dividing by 5 first because I see it ends with a 5. 845 divided by 5 is 169. Oh, 169 is 13 squared. So, sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*169) which is sqrt(5)*sqrt(169), that's 13*sqrt(5). So, sqrt(845) over 9 is (13*sqrt(5))/9. Got that down.\n\nNow, the last term in the numerator is sqrt(45). Again, 45 is 9*5. So, sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) which is 3*sqrt(5). So, that term is just 3*sqrt(5).\n\nPutting it all together, the numerator is sqrt(5) + (13*sqrt(5))/9 + 3*sqrt(5). I should get all these terms over a common denominator to add them up. The denominators are 1, 9, and 1. So, the least common denominator is 9.\n\nLet me convert each term to ninths"

            "output": ". sqrt(5) is 9*sqrt(5)/9, (13*sqrt(5))/9 is already good, and 3*sqrt(5) is 27*sqrt(5)/9. So adding them up: 9/9 + 13/9 + 27/9 is equal to (9+13+27)/9 which is 49/9. So, the numerator simplifies to (49/9)*sqrt(5).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. 9*sqrt(5)/9 is sqrt(5), right. Then 13*sqrt(5)/9 stays, and 3*sqrt(5) is 27*sqrt(5)/9. So when I add sqrt(5) which is 9/9, plus 13/9, plus 27/9. 9 + 13 is 22, plus 27 is 49. So, yes, 49/9*sqrt(5). That seems correct.\n\nSo the numerator is (49/9)*sqrt(5). Now, the entire expression is sqrt( [ (49/9)*sqrt(5) ] divided by sqrt(5) ). So, inside the sqrt, we have (49/9)*sqrt(5)/sqrt(5).\n\nWait, sqrt(5)/sqrt(5) is just 1, right? Because sqrt(a)/sqrt(a) is 1 for a not zero. So that simplifies to (49/9)*1, which is 49/9. So now the entire expression is sqrt(49/9).\n\nWhat's sqrt(49/9)? Well, sqrt(49) is 7 and sqrt(9) is 3, so it's 7/3. So, the simplified fraction is 7/3.\n\nWait, let me go through that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the numerator:\n\nsqrt(80) = 4*sqrt(5), so 5/sqrt(80) = 5/(4*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5).\n\nsqrt(845) = 13*sqrt(5), so that term is 13*sqrt(5)/9.\n\nsqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo adding them:\n\nsqrt(5) + 13*sqrt(5)/9 + 3*sqrt(5).\n\n"
