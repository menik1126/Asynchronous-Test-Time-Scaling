Additionally, there are more girls than boys at the meeting.\n\nFirst, I'll let G represent the number of girls. Since the number of girls is a multiple of 13, G can be 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since there are only 35 students in total, G cannot exceed 35. This limits G to 13 or 26.\n\nNext, I'll consider both possible values for G:\n1. If G = 13, then the number of boys, B, would be 35 - 13 = 22. However, this doesn't satisfy the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n2. If G = 26, then the number of boys would be 35 - 26 = 9. This satisfies the condition since 26 > 9.\n\nSince 26 is the only valid number of girls that meets all the conditions, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\n**We know:**\n1. \\( G + B = 35 \\)  \n2. \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13, so \\( G = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n3. \\( G > B \\)\n\n**Step 1:** Express \\( B \\) in terms of \\( G \\):\n\\[\nB = 35 - G\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute \\( G = 13k \\) into the equation:\n\\[\nB = 35 - 13k\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Apply the condition \\( G > B \\):\n\\[\n13k > 35 - 13k\n\\]\n\\[\n13k + 13k > 35\n\\]\n\\[\n26k > 35\n\\]\n\\[\nk > \\frac{35}{26}\n\\]\n\\[\nk > 1.346\n\\]\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer,"
