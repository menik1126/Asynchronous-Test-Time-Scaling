            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, okay. Let me write that down to make it clearer.\n\nSo, it's: ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16.\n\nI remember that when there's a cube root, one way to get rid of it is by cubing both sides of the equation. That should help simplify things. So, let me do that.\n\nIf I cube both sides, the equation becomes:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 16³.\n\nNow, 16 cubed is... let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Hmm, 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. So, adding those together, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, 16³ is 4096.\n\nSo, the equation is now x² - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nAlright, now I can subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0.\n\nSimplify that: 4 - 4096 is -4092, so:\n\nx² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nHmm, okay, so I have a quadratic equation here: x² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for x, but I can't factor this easily, I think. Let me check. The product of the constants term is 4092, and I need two numbers that multiply to -4092 and add up to -4. Hmm, that seems tough. Maybe I should use the quadratic formula instead.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -4092.\n\nSo, plugging those into the formula:\n\nx = [4 ± √( (-4)² - 4*1*(-4092) ) ] / (2*1).\n\nCalculate the discriminant first: (-4)² is 16. Then, 4*1*4092 is 16368. So,"

            "output": " 16 + 16368 is 16384.\n\n√16384... Hmm, what's the square root of 16384? I remember that 128 squared is 16384, because 128 times 128 is (130 - 2)², which is 130² - 2*130*2 + 4 = 16900 - 520 + 4 = 16384. So, √16384 is 128.\n\nSo, now plug that back in: x = [4 ± 128] / 2.\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\nx = (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66,\n\nand\n\nx = (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the positive value of x, so x = 66 is the solution.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's plug x = 66 back into the original equation.\n\nCompute x² - 4x + 4:\n\n66 squared is 4356.\n\n4 times 66 is 264.\n\nSo, 4356 - 264 + 4.\n\n4356 - 264 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096.\n\nCube root of 4096 is indeed 16 because 16³ = 4096.\n\nSo, that checks out. Therefore, the positive solution is 66.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. Cubing both sides gives x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. Simplifying, we get x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, discriminant is 16384, whose square root is 128. Thus, x = (4 ± 128)/2. The positive solution is x = 66.\n\n\\boxed{66}"
