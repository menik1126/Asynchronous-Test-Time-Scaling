I'm given three sums: the sum of the first powers of the sequence is 96, the sum of the squares is 144, and the sum of the cubes is 216. And I need to find the sum of all possible values of n.\n\nHmm, let's write down what's given:\n\n1. The sum of a_i from i=1 to n is 96:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96\n   \\]\n2. The sum of a_i squared is 144:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144\n   \\]\n3. The sum of a_i cubed is 216:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216\n   \\]\n\nI need to find all possible n and add them up. So, how can I relate these sums to find n?\n\nI remember that when dealing with sums of powers, sometimes we can use inequalities or think about the properties of sequences. Maybe if all the a_i are equal, it would simplify things? Let me try that.\n\nIf all a_i are equal, then each a_i would be 96/n. Let's plug that into the other sums.\n\nFirst, the sum of squares:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = n \\times \\frac{9216}{n^2} = \\frac{9216}{n}\n\\]\nBut this is equal to 144, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{9216}{n} = 144\n\\]\nSolving for n:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{9216}{144} = 64\n\\]\nSo if all a_i are equal, n would be 64.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"positive real numbers,\" not necessarily equal. So there might be other possibilities where the a_i aren't all equal. Hmm, so maybe n could be different.\n\nBut how do I consider different a_i's?

But here, we have three sums: first, second, and third powers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the variance or something. Variance relates the mean of the squares minus the square of the mean. Let me try that.\n\nLet's denote the mean of the first power as \u03bc\u2081 = 96/n. The mean of the second power is \u03bc\u2082 = 144/n. Similarly, \u03bc\u2083 = 216/n.\n\nVariance is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\mu_2 - \\mu_1^2\n\\]\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\frac{9216}{n^2}\n\\]\nSimilarly, perhaps we can do something with the third power. I know that for moments, higher moments relate to the spread or skewness, but I'm not sure how that would directly help.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the sums. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that:\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n 1^2 \\right) \\geq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^2\n\\]\nSo plugging in the known values:\n\\[\n144 \\times n \\geq 96^2\n\\]\nCalculating 96 squared: 96*96 = 9216. So:\n\\[\n144n \\geq 9216\n\\]\nDivide both sides by 144:\n\\[\nn \\geq \\frac{9216}{144}\n\\]\nWhich is the same as before, 64. So n must be at least 64. But wait, earlier when I assumed all a_i are equal, n was 64, so in that case, equality holds in Cauchy-Schwarz. That means that for the inequality to be tight, all the a_i must be equal, so n=64 is possible.\n\nBut the problem is"

Let me see.\n\nThe variance formula I had earlier:\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2\n\\]\nThis must be non-negative because variance can't be negative.

So n must be at least 64. So n can't be less than 64. But can it be more?\n\nHmm, so maybe n can be 64 or higher? But how does the third power come into play here?\n\nThe problem also gives the sum of cubes as 216. So perhaps there's a constraint from that?\n\nLet me think. Let's see if there's a way to relate the third moment to the first and second moments.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a system of equations. Let me consider variables a_i. Since they are positive real numbers, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers or some optimization technique?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the sequence as consisting of some number of variables. Let me consider the case where all but one of the a_i are equal. Maybe that can help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the only possible n is 64, but the question says \"sum of all possible values of n,\" so maybe there are multiple n?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another case where some of the a_i are different. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose that there are two different values in the sequence. Let's say there are k terms of value x and (n - k) terms of value y.

Let's see, if all a_i were equal, the sum of cubes would be 65*(96/65)^3 = (96^3)/65^2 \u2248 (884,736)/4225 \u2248 209.4, which is less than 216. So to get a higher sum of cubes, we need some terms to be larger and some smaller. Since cubes are more sensitive to larger numbers, so if we have some numbers larger than the mean and some smaller, the sum of cubes can be increased.\n\nWait, so maybe n=65 is possible?\n\nHmm, so perhaps there are multiple n's possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only possible n is 64?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"sum of all possible values of n,\" so maybe there are two possible n's?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only possible n is 64, but the problem is designed to trick us?\n\nWait, let me think of another approach. Let me consider the vectors.\n\nSuppose we have a vector **a** = (a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099). The given sums are the first, second, and third moments. Maybe we can model this as a system of equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the variables as the a_i's and set up equations. But with n variables, that's too many. Maybe there's a way to use the Cauchy-Schwarz or H\u00f6lder's inequality?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the given sums are similar to the moments of a probability distribution. Let me think of the a_i's as values with probabilities 1/n each. Then the first moment is 96/n, the second is 144/n, third is 216/n.\n\nLet me denote \u03bc = 96/n,\n\n\u03bc\u2082 = 144/n,\n\n\u03bc\u2083 = 216/n.\n\nThen, the variance is \u03bc\u2082 - \u03bc\u00b2"

So if n must be an integer, then there is no solution for n in this case. So this approach doesn't give us integer solutions.\n\nThus, perhaps having one different a_i and the rest equal doesn't yield integer n. So maybe if we have two different a_i's, in which case we can set up equations.\n\nWait, but that's what I tried earlier with two variables, which led to a complicated system."

But in our case, sum r_i\u00b2= n/64 and sum r_i^3= n\u00b2 /4096.\n\nLet me see if these can be achieved with some r_i's.\n\nAn important relation is that:\n\nsum r_i^3 = (sum r_i^2)^{3/2} / sum r_i^{1/2} } ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Cauchy-Schwarz on sum r_i^3 and sum 1.\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use H\u00f6lder's inequality.\n\nAlternatively, think about the case when all r_i are equal. If all r_i=1, then sum r_i\u00b2= n, but here it's n/64, so that would imply that each r_i= sqrt(n/64)/n? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if all r_i are either 0 or some value, but since a_i are positive, r_i can't be zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all r_i are 1/8, since 1/8 squared is 1/64, and 1/8 cubed is 1/512. But 1/8 sum r_i\u00b2= n*(1/64)=n/64, which matches. Similarly, sum r_i^3= n*(1/512). But in our case, sum r_i^3= n\u00b2 /4096.\n\nSo unless n\u00b2 /4096 = n/512,\n\nWhich would imply n=4096/512=8. So n=8.\n\nWait, sum r_i^3= n\u00b2 /4096=8/512=1/64, but sum r_i^3 for all r_i=1/8 is n*(1/512)=8*(1/512)=1/64, so that works. So if all r_i=1/8, then sum r_i\u00b2=8*(1/64)=1/8, wait, no.\n\nWait, I think"

So that works.\n\nSimilarly, sum r_i^3= n*(1/512)=n/(512). But according to the earlier expression, sum r_i^3 should be n\u00b2/4096.\n\nSo setting n/(512)=n\u00b2/4096,\n\nMultiply both sides by 4096:\n\n8n =n\u00b2,\n\nThus n\u00b2 -8n=0,\n\nn(n-8)=0,\n\nThus n=0 or n=8.\n\nBut n=8 is a solution. So if n=8, then setting all r_i=1/8, so each a_i= \u03bc*(1/8)= (96/8)*(1/8)=12*(1/8)=1.5.\n\nWait, but then each a_i=1.5, so sum a_i=8*1.5=12, but the problem requires sum a_i=96. Wait, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, the r_i are defined as a_i divided by the mean \u03bc=96/n.\n\nSo if all r_i=1/8, then each a_i= \u03bc*(1/8)= (96/n)*(1/8)=12/n.\n\nThus, the sum of a_i would be n*(12/n)=12, but the problem requires the sum to be 96. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAh, so my mistake was in the definition. Let me correct.\n\nLet me re-define:\n\nLet \u03bc = (sum a_i)/n =96/n.\n\nThen, r_i = a_i / \u03bc,\n\nThus, sum r_i = n*(a_i/\u03bc) summed over i, but since sum a_i = \u03bc*n,\n\nsum r_i = sum (a_i / \u03bc) = (sum a_i)/\u03bc = (\u03bc n)/\u03bc =n.\n\nSo sum r_i =n.\n\nSimilarly, sum r_i\u00b2 = sum (a_i^2)/\u03bc\u00b2 = (sum a_i^2)/\u03bc\u00b2 =144/( (96/n)^2"
