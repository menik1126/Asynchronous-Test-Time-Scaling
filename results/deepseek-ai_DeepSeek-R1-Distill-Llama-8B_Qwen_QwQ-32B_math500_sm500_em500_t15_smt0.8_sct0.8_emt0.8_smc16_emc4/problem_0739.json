Therefore, x equals 2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\(2^3\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\\\\n   \\div 2^3 \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\div 2^3 \\\\\n   \\quad 3^x = \\frac{72}{8} \\\\\n   \\quad 3^x = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n   Here, \\(9 = 3^2\\), so the equation becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same:**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
