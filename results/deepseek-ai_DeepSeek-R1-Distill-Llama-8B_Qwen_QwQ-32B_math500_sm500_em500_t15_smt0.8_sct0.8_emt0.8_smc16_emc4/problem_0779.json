The answer should be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. First, I remember that the distance from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) is given by the distance formula, which is \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Since I need to minimize this distance, it makes sense to minimize the square of the distance, which would just be \\( x^2 + y^2 \\). This is because the square root function is monotonically increasing, so the minimum of the distance will correspond to the minimum of the squared distance. That should make the differentiation easier, as minimizing \\( x^2 + y^2 \\) should give me the same point as minimizing the actual distance.\n\nSo, let's set up the function for the squared distance. Let me denote this function as \\( D \\). Thus,\n\n\\( D = x^2 + y^2 \\).\n\nBut since \\( y \\) is given in terms of \\( x \\), I can substitute that into the equation to get \\( D \\) solely in terms of \\( x \\). That substitution will be helpful because then I can differentiate \\( D \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and find the critical points.\n\nGiven that \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), plugging this into \\( D \\):\n\n\\( D = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\).\n\nLet me simplify this expression step by step. First, square the \\( y \\) term:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\cdot (x^2 - 3)^2 = \\"

To find the minimum distance, I need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes \\( D \\). Since \\( D \\) is a polynomial, I can take the derivative of \\( D \\) with respect to \\( x \\), set it equal to zero, and solve for \\( x \\). That will give me the critical points, which could be minima or maxima. Then, I can check the second derivative or analyze the behavior around those points to ensure it's a minimum.\n\nSo, let's compute \\( \\frac{dD}{dx} \\):\n\nFirst, \\( D = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\).\n\nTaking the derivative term by term:\n\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{1}{2}x^4 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4x^3 = 2x^3 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( -2x^2 \\) is \\( -4x \\).\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) (a constant) is 0.\n\nPutting it all together,\n\n\\( \\frac{dD}{dx} = 2x^3 - 4x \\).\n\nNow, set this derivative equal to zero to find critical"

To find the minimal distance, the vector (x, y) should be perpendicular to the tangent line at that point on the curve. The condition for perpendicularity is that the dot product of the vector (x, y) and the direction vector of the tangent line is zero.\n\nSo, let's try that approach to see if it confirms my result.\n\nFirst, the curve is given by y = (1/\u221a2)(x^2 - 3).
