I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is related to how many times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I think the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factors of 42! will determine the number of trailing zeros. \n\nHmm, but I also recall that in factorials, there are usually more 2s than 5s. So, the number of 5s will be the limiting factor for the number of trailing zeros. That means I just need to count how many times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. \n\nSo, how do I count the number of times 5 is a factor in 42!? I think I need to consider how many multiples of 5 are there, then how many multiples of 25, 125, and so on, because each of these contributes more than one 5. \n\nLet me write this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the number of multiples of 5 in 42! is the integer division of 42 by 5. So, 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, but since we take the floor, that's 8. So, there are 8 multiples of 5.\n\nBut wait, each multiple of 25 contributes an extra 5. So, I need to count how many multiples of 25 are there. 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, so that's 1. So, there is 1 multiple of 25.\n\nWhat about higher powers? 125 is 5 cubed, but 125 is already larger than 42, so there are no multiples of 125 in 42!. Therefore, I don't need to consider anything beyond 25.\n\nSo, adding up the contributions: \n\n- From multiples of 5: 8\n- From multiples of 25: 1\n\nTotal number of 5s = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSince there are more 2s than 5s in 42!, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s, which is 9.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\n"

But since 50 is beyond 42, only 25 is included, adding 1 more. So, 8 + 1 = 9. \n\nYeah, that seems right. So, 42! ends with 9 zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we count the number of times 10 is a factor. Since 10 is \\(2 \\times 5\\), and there are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s in the prime factors.\n\n1. **Count multiples of 5 in 42!**:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   This contributes 8 fives.\n\n2. **Count multiples of 25 in 42!**:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]\n   This contributes an additional 1 five.\n\n3. **Higher powers**:\n   \\(5^3 = 125\\) is greater than 42, so no additional contributions.\n\nAdding these:\n\\[\n8 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 9 trailing zeros in \\(42!\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
