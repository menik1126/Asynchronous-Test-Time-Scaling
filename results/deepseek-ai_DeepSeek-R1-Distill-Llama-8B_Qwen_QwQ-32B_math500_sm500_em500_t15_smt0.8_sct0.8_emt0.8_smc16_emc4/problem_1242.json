            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better. It's x = \u221a(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, so I need to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. \n\nFirst, I remember that whenever there's a square root in an equation, a common strategy is to isolate the square root and then square both sides to eliminate it. That way, I can solve for x more easily. Let me try that here.\n\nSo, starting with the equation: x = \u221a(11 - 2x) + 4. I think I should get rid of that square root first. To do that, maybe I can subtract 4 from both sides. Let's see: if I subtract 4 from both sides, I'll have x - 4 = \u221a(11 - 2x). Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow I have an equation where the square root is by itself on one side. So, the next step is to square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me do that. Squaring the left side: (x - 4) squared is x squared minus 8x plus 16. And squaring the right side: (\u221a(11 - 2x)) squared is just 11 - 2x. So, putting that together, I get x\u00b2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x.\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me write that down: x\u00b2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x. I need to bring all the terms to one side so I can have a standard quadratic equation. Let me subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides. So, subtracting 11: x\u00b2 - 8x + 16 - 11 becomes x\u00b2 - 8x + 5. And adding 2x: that becomes x\u00b2 - 6x + 5. So now, the equation is x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = 0.\n\nHmm, okay, now I have to solve this quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Let's think: 5 is prime, so the factors would"

            "output": " be 1 and 5. Now, if I take both negative, (-1) * (-5) is 5, and (-1) + (-5) is -6. Perfect! So, the quadratic factors as (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives me x - 1 = 0 or x - 5 = 0, so x = 1 or x = 5. Hmm, so does that mean both 1 and 5 are solutions? I need to check because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nOkay, let's plug x = 1 back into the original equation: x = \u221a(11 - 2x) + 4. So, \u221a(11 - 2*1) + 4 is \u221a(11 - 2) which is \u221a9, which is 3, plus 4 is 7. So, is x = 1? Yes, 1 equals 7? Wait, that's not correct. Hmm, that can't be right. So, x = 1 doesn't satisfy the original equation. That means it's an extraneous solution, so we have to reject it.\n\nNow, let's check x = 5. Plugging that into the original equation: \u221a(11 - 2*5) + 4. Calculating inside the square root: 11 - 10 is 1, so \u221a1 is 1. Then, 1 + 4 is 5. So, x = 5 equals 5, which is true. So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nSo, even though both x=1 and x=5 came out of the quadratic, only x=5 works in the original equation. Therefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nI also remember that when dealing with square roots, the expression inside the square root has to be non-negative. So, let's verify that for each solution. For x=1: 11 - 2*1 = 11 - 2 = 9, which is positive. So, that's okay. For x=5: 11 - 2*5 = 11 -10 = 1, which is also positive. So, both x=1 and x=5 make the expression inside the square root non-negative. So, that condition is satisfied for"

Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra steps? Let me retrace. \n\nOriginal equation: x = \u221a(11 - 2x) +4. \n\nSubtract 4: x -4 = \u221a(11 -2x). \n\nSquare both sides: (x -4)^2 = 11 -2x. \n\nExpand left side: x\u00b2 -8x +16 = 11 -2x. \n\nBring all terms to left: x\u00b2 -8x +16 -11 +2x =0 \u2192 x\u00b2 -6x +5 =0. \n\nFactor: (x-1)(x-5)=0. \n\nSolutions x=1 and x=5. \n\nCheck x=1: LHS is 1, RHS is sqrt(9)+4=3+4=7. Not equal. \n\nCheck x=5: LHS is 5, RHS sqrt(1)+4=5. Equal. \n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, only x=5 is the solution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try another approach to confirm. Let me try substituting x=5 and x=1 again. \n\nFor x=1: \n\nLeft side: 1. \n\nRight side: sqrt(11 -2*1) +4 = sqrt(9) +4 = 3+4=7. \n\n1\u22607, so no good. \n\nx=5: \n\nLeft side:5. \n\nRight side: sqrt(11-10)+4= sqrt(1)+4=1+4=5. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5. \n\nHmm, so I think that's it. The key steps were isolating the square root, squaring both sides, solving the quadratic, then checking for extraneous solutions. Since squaring can sometimes introduce solutions that don't satisfy the original equation, it's crucial to check each solution in the original equation. \n\nAnother thing to note is that the square root function itself only outputs the non-negative root, so when we squared both sides, we might have introduced a solution that doesn't satisfy the original equation's sign conditions"
