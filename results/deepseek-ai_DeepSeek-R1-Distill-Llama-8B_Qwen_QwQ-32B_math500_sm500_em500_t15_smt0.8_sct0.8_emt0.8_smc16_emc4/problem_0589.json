However, if considering complex solutions, we can proceed:\n\nLet \\( (5 - a)^2 = -41 \\). Taking square roots:\n\\[\n5 - a = \\pm \\sqrt{-41} = \\pm i\\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\\[\na = 5 \\mp i\\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\nThe two complex solutions are \\( a = 5 - i\\sqrt{41} \\) and \\( a = 5 + i\\sqrt{41} \\). Their sum is:\n\\[\n(5 - i\\sqrt{41}) + (5 + i\\sqrt{41}) = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the values (including complex) is \\boxed{10}.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify complex, but typically in such problems unless stated, real solutions are expected. However, the problem might have a mistake in the equation setup. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the original equation was written as:\n\n$$(3)5^2-4(5-a)^2 \\div 3=63$$\n\nPossibly, the user might have intended different grouping. Let me re-express the original equation with proper order of operations.\n\nThe original equation could be interpreted as:\n\n3*(5)^2 - [4*(5 - a)^2] / 3 = 63\n\nWhich is how I initially solved it. Alternatively, maybe it's (3*5^2 -4*(5 -a)^2) divided by 3 equals 63, which is the same as my first interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if the equation was 3*5\u00b2 -4*(5 -a)^2 \u00f73 =63, then the division is only applied to the 4*(5 -a)^2 term. Let me check that possibility.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nOriginal equation: 3*5\u00b2 - [4*(5 -a)^2 \u00f73] =63\n\nWhich is 3*25 - [4*(5 -a)^2 /3] =63\n\nSo 75 - (4/3)(5 -a)^2 =63\n\nThen subtract 75"
