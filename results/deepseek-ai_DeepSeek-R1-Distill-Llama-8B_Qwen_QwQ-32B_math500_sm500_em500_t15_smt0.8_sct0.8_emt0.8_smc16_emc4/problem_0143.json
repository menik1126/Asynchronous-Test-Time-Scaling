            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about the superfactorial, which is defined as n\\$ = n! raised to the power of itself n! times. Specifically, I need to find the units digit of 4\\$.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what the superfactorial is. It's not the usual factorial we're used to, right? The regular factorial of a number n is just n multiplied by (n-1) multiplied by all the numbers below it down to 1. The superfactorial is a bit different. It's like taking n! and then raising it to the power of itself, but it's actually an infinite exponentiation of n! So, 4\\$ would be 4!^(4!^(4!^...)) with the exponent being 4! repeated multiple times, but since it's an infinite tower, it's just 4! raised to 4! in this case, because after the first exponentiation, it stabilizes.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The definition is 4\\$ = 4!^(4!^4!^...). Since the tower is infinite, we can replace it with 4!^4! because the exponent is also 4!^4!^... which equals 4!. So, that means 4\\$ is 4! raised to the power of 4!.\n\nSo, let's compute 4! first. 4! is 4\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71, which is 24. So, 4\\$ = 24^(24^24...). But wait, because it's an infinite tower, as I thought before, it's 24^24. So, 4\\$ is 24 raised to the power of 24.\n\nBut wait, no. Actually, the definition is n\\$ = n!^(n!^(n!^...)), so for 4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^...)). So the exponent itself is 4!^(4!^(...)), which again is 4!^4! because it's infinite. So, yes, 4\\$ = 4!^(4!^4!^... ) = 4!^4! = 24^24.\n\nSo, the task is to find the units digit of 24^24. But finding the units digit of a large exponent can be simplified by"

Because any number mod 10 is equal to its last digit mod 10, so (24 mod10) is 4, so 24^24 mod10 =4^24 mod10.\n\nTherefore, now the problem reduces to finding the units digit of 4^24.\n\nNow, the powers of 4 have a cycle in their units digit. Let me recall:\n\n4^1 = 4, units digit 4\n\n4^2 = 16, units digit 6\n\n4^3 = 64, units digit 4\n\n4^4 = 256, units digit 6\n\nSo, the cycle here is every two exponents: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc. Thus, the pattern is 4,6 repeating every two exponents.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4^k depends on whether k is even or odd. If k is even, the units digit is 6; if odd, it's 4.\n\nSince 24 is even, the units digit of 4^24 is 6. Therefore, the units digit of 24^24 is 6, so the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check again. The problem says the superfactorial is defined as n\\$ = n! raised to the power of n! raised to the power of n! and so on, with the tower having n! terms. Wait, the problem says \"underbrace{n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}}_{n!}\".\n\nOh! Wait, maybe I misunderstood the definition. The problem says the tower has n! terms. So, for n=4, the tower has 24 terms? Because n! is 24. So, the superfactorial is 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 copies of 24 in the exponent tower. That's different from an infinite tower. So, the tower has exactly 2"

Wait, the tower is 24 levels tall, each level is 24.\n\nWait, the underbrace is over n! number of exponentials. So, it's n!^(n!^(n!^...)) with the underbrace indicating n! exponents. So, for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^...)) with 4! =24 exponents. So, is that a tower of 24's with 24 levels?\n\nWait, if n=4, then n! is 24, and the tower has 24 levels. So, 4\\$ is 24^(24^(24^(...))) with 24 exponents. So, that would be a tower of 24s, 24 high. So, the exponent itself is a tower starting from 24, and it's 24 high. So, that would be 24^24^24^...^24, with 24 terms.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. So, perhaps I need to compute 4\\$ as 24^(24^(...)) with 24 exponents. So, it's a tower of 24s, 24 high. So, 24^24^24^...^24, 24 times.\n\nTherefore, computing 24^24^24^...^24, with 24 levels. That is, exponentiation is right-associative, so it's 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 levels.\n\nBut to compute the units digit, I can work modulo 10.\n\nBut exponentiation towers can be simplified by Euler's theorem, which says that for modulus m, and a number a co-prime to m, a^\u03c6(m) \u22611 mod m, where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function.\n\nBut 10 is the modulus here, and \u03c6(10)=4.\n\nBut 24 and 10 are not coprime since 24 is divisible by 2 and 5, which are factors of 10. Therefore, Euler's theorem doesn't directly apply here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to compute 24^k mod 10, where k is 24^24^...^24 (24 times). Wait, but 24 mod 10 is "

So, the problem reduces to finding 4^k mod10, where k is the exponent tower of 24's with 23 more 24's above it.\n\nWait, but even so, the exponent k is a huge number. So, perhaps we can find the exponent modulo \u03c6(10)=4, but since 4 and 10 are not coprime, maybe we need to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since 4^k mod10 cycles every 2. Let me see:\n\n4^1 mod10=4\n\n4^2 mod10=6\n\n4^3 mod10=4\n\n4^4 mod10=6\n\nSo, the cycle length is 2.

So, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^...)) with 24 exponents.\n\nWait, so starting from the top, it's 4!^...
