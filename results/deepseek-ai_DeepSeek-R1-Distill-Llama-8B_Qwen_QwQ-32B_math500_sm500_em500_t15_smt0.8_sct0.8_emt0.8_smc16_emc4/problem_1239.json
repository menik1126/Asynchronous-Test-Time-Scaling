            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that seems interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down the equation to visualize it better. So, it's:\n\nx = \u221a(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, so I have a square root there, which makes me think I might need to square both sides at some point to get rid of it. But before I do that, maybe I should isolate the square root term. Let me see.\n\nLet me subtract 4 from both sides to get:\n\nx - 4 = \u221a(11 - 2x)\n\nOkay, that's better. Now, the square root is by itself on one side. Now, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. But before I do that, I should remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll need to check my answers at the end.\n\nSo, squaring both sides gives:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (\u221a(11 - 2x))^2\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16\n\nRight side: 11 - 2x\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nNow, let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. I'll subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplifying the terms:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nAlright, now we have a quadratic equation: x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. Let me try to factor this. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6.\n\nHmm, factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, 1 and 5. Since the middle term is -6x, both numbers should be negative to add up to -6. So, (-1) and (-5) multiply to 5 and add to -6. Perfect.\n\nSo, factoring:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5"

            "output": ") = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. But as I mentioned before, I need to check these solutions in the original equation because squaring can sometimes give false positives.\n\nLet's start with x = 1.\n\nPlugging into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: x = 1\n\nRight side: \u221a(11 - 2*1) + 4 = \u221a(11 - 2) + 4 = \u221a9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, 1 does not equal 7. That means x = 1 is an extraneous solution and should be discarded.\n\nNow, checking x = 5.\n\nLeft side: x = 5\n\nRight side: \u221a(11 - 2*5) + 4 = \u221a(11 - 10) + 4 = \u221a1 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, 5 equals 5. That works. So, x = 5 is the valid solution.\n\nWait a second, I got only one solution, x = 5, but the quadratic had two solutions. Why did the other one get rejected?\n\nWell, because when we square both sides of the equation, sometimes solutions that don't satisfy the original equation pop up. In this case, x = 1 didn't work because when we plugged it in, the right side was 7, not 1. So, x = 1 is not a valid solution for the original equation.\n\nLet me also make sure that I'm not missing any other possible solutions or if I made a mistake in my steps. Let's go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nx = \u221a(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtract 4:\n\nx - 4 = \u221a(11 - 2x)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 => x = 1 and x = "

            "output": "5\n\nCheck x = 1: Doesn't satisfy original equation.\n\nCheck x = 5: Satisfies original equation.\n\nSo, yes, only x = 5 is the solution.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider the domain of the original equation. The square root requires that the expression inside be non-negative.\n\nSo, \u221a(11 - 2x) is real only if 11 - 2x \u2265 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n11 \u2265 2x => x \u2264 11/2 => x \u2264 5.5\n\nSo, x must be less than or equal to 5.5.\n\nOur solutions are x = 1 and x = 5, both of which are less than 5.5, so that doesn't exclude x = 1.\n\nBut when we tested it, x = 1 didn't work because we ended up with 1 = 7, which isn't true.\n\nSo, even though x = 1 is in the domain, it doesn't satisfy the original equation.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x = 5.\n\nWait, another thought: should I have considered negative roots when I squared both sides? Let me think.\n\nWhen I squared (x - 4), technically, (x - 4)^2 is always non-negative, but when I squared both sides, both sides could have positive or negative roots? Hmm, no, actually, the square root function is defined to output only the principal (non-negative) root, so when I square both sides, the right side is 11 - 2x, which must be non-negative. So, I was correct in considering that when I plug in x, \u221a(11 - 2x) is non-negative.\n\nSo, when I squared both sides, I should remember that the right side is non-negative, so when I later solve for x, I don't have to consider negative roots.\n\nTherefore, when I found x = 1 and x = 5, I tested them in the original equation to see if they satisfy, which turned out only x = 5 did.\n\nHence, x = 5 is the only solution.\n\nIs there any other way this could have been approached? Perhaps by graphing.\n\nThinking about it, the left side is a linear function, x, and the right side is a function involving a square root. The square root function is a curve that starts at x = "

The intersection point would be at x =5, which is where they meet. The other solution at x=1 would be where the squared equation intersects, but since the square root function at x=1 is 3, plus 4 is 7, which is higher than the line at x=1 (which is 1), so they don't cross there. So, that's why only x=5 is valid.\n\nAlright, I think that's thorough enough.
