            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). Then, add them all together to get a + b + c. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes come from the zeros of the denominator, provided that they don't make the numerator zero at the same time. So, I need to factor the denominator to find where it equals zero. The denominator is x\u00b2 -5x -14. Let me try factoring that.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 could be -7 and 2, because -7 * 2 = -14 and -7 + 2 = -5. So, that factors to (x - 7)(x + 2). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = 7 and x = -2. So, a is 7 and b is -2. Got that.\n\nNow, moving on to horizontal asymptotes. I remember the rules for horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The function is f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote should be y = 0. So, c is 0.\n\nNow, to find a + b + c, that would be 7 + (-2) + 0. Adding those up: 7 - 2 is 5, and 5 + 0 is 5. So, a + b + c equals 5.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify each step again. Factored denominator: (x -7)(x +2). Yes, that's correct because (x -7)(x +2) = x\u00b2 -5x -14. So vertical asymptotes at x=7 and x=-2, which are a and b. For horizontal asymptote, since degree of numerator (1) is less than degree of denominator (2), horizontal asymptote is y=0, so c is 0. Adding them up: "
