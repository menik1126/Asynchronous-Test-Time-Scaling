The number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys.\n\nFirst, I'll define variables:\n- Let G represent the number of girls.\n- Let B represent the number of boys.\n\nFrom the total number of students:\nG + B = 35.\n\nThe number of girls is a multiple of 13, so possible values for G are 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since the total number of students is 35, G cannot exceed 35. Therefore, the possible values for G are 13 and 26.\n\nNext, I'll consider each possible value of G:\n1. If G = 13:\n   - Then B = 35 - 13 = 22.\n   - However, this scenario states there are more girls than boys, but 13 girls and 22 boys means there are more boys, which contradicts the condition.\n\n2. If G = 26:\n   - Then B = 35 - 26 = 9.\n   - Here, there are 26 girls and 9 boys, which satisfies the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is when G = 26 and B = 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let \\( G \\) be the number of girls.\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of boys.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Equations**\nWe know two things:\n1. The total number of students is 35.\n2. The number of girls is a multiple of 13.\n3. There are more girls than boys.\n\nThis gives us the following equation:\n\\[ G + B = 35 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine Possible Values for \\( G \\)**\nSince \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys:\n- Possible values for \\( G \\) are 13, 26, 39, etc.\n- However, since the total number of students is 35, \\( G \\) can't be more than 35.\n\nSo, possible values for \\( G \\) are 13 and 26.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Each Possibility**\n\n1. **If \\( G = 13"
