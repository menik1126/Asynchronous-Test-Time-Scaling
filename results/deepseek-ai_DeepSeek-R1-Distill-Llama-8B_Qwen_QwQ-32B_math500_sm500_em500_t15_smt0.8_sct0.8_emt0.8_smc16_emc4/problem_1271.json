            "output": "First, I'll express 256 as a power of 2. Since 2 raised to the 8th power equals 256, I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{1/2}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the power of a power property, which allows me to multiply the exponents. This simplifies the equation to \\(2^{2x} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}}\\), resulting in \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. This gives me the equation \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for x by dividing both sides by 2, which gives x = 2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a power of 2:**\n   \n   \\(256 = 2^8\\) because \\(2^8 = 256\\).\n\n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the power of a power property (\\(a^{b}^{c} = a^{bc}\\)):**\n   \n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   Now, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
