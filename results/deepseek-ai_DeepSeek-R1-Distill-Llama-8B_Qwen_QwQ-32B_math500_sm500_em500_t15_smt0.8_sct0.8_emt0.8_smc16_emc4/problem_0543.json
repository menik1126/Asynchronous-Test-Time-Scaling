            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of possible meal combinations Yann and Camille can have without any restrictions.\n\nSince there are 10 different dishes on the menu and each person orders one dish, Yann has 10 possible choices. For each of Yann's choices, Camille also has 10 possible dishes to choose from.\n\nMultiplying Yann's choices by Camille's choices gives the total number of possible meal combinations: 10 * 10 = 100.\n\nHowever, the problem states that Yann and Camille refuse to order the same dish. This means we need to eliminate the scenarios where both order the same dish.\n\nThere are 10 dishes, and for each dish, Yann and Camille could both choose it. So there are 10 such scenarios where their orders are identical.\n\nBy subtracting these 10 identical combinations from the total of 100, we get the number of valid meal combinations where they order different dishes.\n\nTherefore, the number of different meal combinations they can order is 100 - 10 = 90.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order from a menu of 10 dishes, given that they do not order the same dish and the order matters (i.e., Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken).\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Total Possible Combinations Without Restrictions:**\n   \n   - **Step 1:** Yann has 10 choices of dishes.\n   - **Step 2:** For each of Yann's choices, Camille also has 10 choices.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total combinations without restrictions} = 10 \\times 10 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the Cases Where Both Order the Same Dish:**\n   \n   - **Step 1:** There are 10 dishes.\n   - **Step 2:** For each dish, both Yann and Camille could potentially choose it.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Same dish combinations} = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Valid Combinations:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Valid combinations} = \\text{Total combinations without restrictions} - \\text{Same dish combinations} = 100 - 10 = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
