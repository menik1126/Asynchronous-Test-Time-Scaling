Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a fraction like this, you can multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. So, let me rewrite the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10r^3 \\times 4r^6}{8r^4}\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll handle the numerical coefficients. Multiplying 10 and 4 should give me 40. So now the expression looks like:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40r^3 \\times r^6}{8r^4}\n\\]\n\nNow, for the variables with exponents. When you multiply variables with the same base, you add their exponents. Here, both are \\(r\\) raised to a power. So, \\(r^3 \\times r^6\\) becomes \\(r^{3+6} = r^9\\). Now the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{40r^9}{8r^4}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerical coefficients. 40 divided by 8 is 5. So that gives me:\n\n\\[\n5r^{9-4}\n\\]\n\nWait, because the denominator has \\(r^4\\), when I divide \\(r^9\\) by \\(r^4\\), I subtract the exponents. So, 9 minus 4 is 5. That leaves me with:\n\n\\[\n5r^5\n\\]\n\nLet me double-check my steps. Starting with the original expression, multiply the numerators: 10 * 4 is 40, and \\(r^3 * r^6\\) is \\(r^9\\). Denominator is 8r^4. Then, 40 divided by 8 is 5, and \\(r^9\\) divided by \\(r^4\\) is \\(r^5\\). Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So the simplified form is 5r^5.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators**:\n   \\[\n   10r^3 \\times 4r^6 = 40r"
