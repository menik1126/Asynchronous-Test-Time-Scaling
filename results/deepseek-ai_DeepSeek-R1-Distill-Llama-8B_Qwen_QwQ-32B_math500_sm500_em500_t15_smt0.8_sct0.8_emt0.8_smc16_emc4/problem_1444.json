            "output": "Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let me see how I can approach it. Alright, first off, I notice that there are exponential terms with different bases: 3 and 10. That might complicate things, but maybe there's a substitution I can use here.\n\nLet me rewrite 3^{2x} because that's the same as (3^2)^x, right? So that becomes 9^x. So substituting that in, the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, that seems a bit cleaner. Now, both sides have terms with x in the exponent, but different bases. I wonder if I can get all the exponential terms on one side.\n\nLet me subtract 10^x from both sides to see what happens. That gives me 9^x - 10^x + 19 = 0. Hmm, that doesn't look too helpful yet. Maybe I can rearrange it differently. How about moving the 19 to the other side? So, 9^x - 10^x = -19. That might be useful, but I'm not sure how to solve this directly.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can express both 9^x and 10^x in terms of the same base or find a substitution that makes the equation more manageable. Let me think: 9 is 3 squared and 10 is a prime number, so that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can divide both sides by 10^x to normalize the equation.\n\nLet me try that. If I divide every term by 10^x, I get (9/10)^x - 1 + 19/(10^x) = 0. Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe I can let y = (9/10)^x and z = 10^x. But wait, if I do that, are y and z related? Let me see: if (9/10)^x = y, then 10^x = (10/9)^x, which is 1/y. But 10^x is equal to 1/y, so z = 1/y. So z = 1/y, which means y = 1/z. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet"

Let me see:\n\nLet me try substituting t = 10^x. Then, since 9^x = (3^2)^x = 3^{2x}, which is part of the original equation. Wait, but 9^x is also (9)^x, so maybe I can write 9^x as (9)^x. Hmm, but how does that relate to t?\n\nAlternatively, since 9^x = (10^x) * (9/10)^x, so substituting t = 10^x, then 9^x = t*(9/10)^x. But (9/10)^x is (9/10)^x, which is (9/10)^x. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking logarithms? But since there are two exponential terms, that might not be straightforward. Let me see. If I take the natural log of both sides, but the equation is 9^x + 19 = 10^x. The problem is that the logarithm of a sum isn't the sum of logarithms, so that complicates things.\n\nHmm, maybe trial and error? Let me try plugging in some integer values for x to see if I can find a solution.\n\nLet's try x = 0: 9^0 +19 = 1 +19 =20, and 10^0 =1. So 20 vs 1. Not equal.\n\nx=1: 9^1 +19 = 28, 10^1=10. Not equal.\n\nx=2: 9^2 +19 =81 +19=100, and 10^2=100. Oh! Wait, that works. So x=2 is a solution.\n\nHmm, so x=2 is a solution. Let me check if there are others.\n\nx=3: 9^3 +19 =729 +19=7"

Let me try x=1 as before: 9 +19=28\u226010.\n\nWait, but maybe I can see if x=2 is the only solution. Let me see how the functions behave.\n\nConsider the function f(x) = 9^x +19 and g(x)=10^x. Let me analyze their growth.\n\nAs x increases, g(x)=10^x grows much faster than f(x)=9^x +19. So after a certain point, 10^x will overtake 9^x +19.\n\nBut for x negative? Let's see: when x is negative, 9^x is 1/9^{|x|}, so it approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity. Similarly, 10^x approaches 0. So the function f(x) approaches 19 as x approaches negative infinity, while g(x) approaches 0. So, for very negative x, f(x) is greater than g(x).\n\nAt x=2, f(x)=100 and g(x)=100. So they are equal.\n\nLet me check x=1: f=28, g=10. f > g.\n\nx=0: f=20 >1.\n\nHow about between x=2 and higher x:\n\nAt x=3, f=729+19=748 <10^3=1000.\n\nSo f(x) is less than g(x) at x=3.\n\nSo it's possible that there is a point where f(x) crosses g(x) somewhere between x=2 and x=3. Wait, but when x=2, they are equal. So let me think: is x=2 the only solution?\n\nWait, if I consider that for x >2, 10^x grows much faster than 9^x, so after x=2, 10^x will be larger. At x=2, both f and g equal 100. So, is f(x) increasing faster or slower? Let's compare the derivatives.\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating, but perhaps plotting the functions would help. But since I can't plot here, maybe I can analyze the function h(x)=10^x"

But between x=2 and x=3, h(x) goes from 0 to 252, so no crossing there. For x>2, h(x) is increasing, so no more zeros. For x<2, let's see between x=1 and 2, it only reaches zero at x=2. What about between x=0 and 1? h(0) is -19, h(1) is -18, so it's still negative. So maybe x=2 is the only solution?\n\nWait, but let me check between x=2 and higher. Wait, at x=2, h(x)=0, and then it becomes positive. So the function crosses zero at x=2 from below to above? Wait, h(2)=0, h(3)=252>0, so after x=2, it's increasing. Before x=2, like at x=1.5, let's compute h(1.5):\n\n10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)\u224831.62, 9^1.5= sqrt(9^3)=sqrt(729)=27. So h(1.5)=31.62 -27 -19\u224831.62-46\u2248-14.38 <0.

So it's negative at x=0 and x=1, becomes zero at x=2, and then positive beyond that. So that suggests that x=2 is the only real solution.\n\nWait, but I should also check negative x. Wait, when x is negative, 10^x is 1/10^{|x|}, which is a positive fraction less than 1, and 9^x is also a fraction, but 9>10 in terms of fractions when x is negative. Wait, no: if x is negative, 1/9^{|x|} is larger than 1/10^{|x|} because 9 <10, so 1/9 >1/10. So 9^x is greater than 10^x when x is negative.\n\nSo let me plug in x negative: f(x)=9^x +19, which is greater than 10^x +19. So the equation would be f(x)=10^x, so if f(x) >10^x, then 9^x +19 >10^x for x negative. So the equation 9^x +19=10^x would not have solutions for x negative because 9^x +19 is always greater than 10^x for negative x.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nWait, but let's double-check: 9^2 +19=81 +19=100, and 10^2=100. So yes, that works.\n\nIs there any other point where 9^x +19 =10^x?\n\nWell, let's consider x>2: 9^x grows exponentially, but so does 10^x. Let me see the ratio 10^x /9^x = (10/9)^x. So as x increases, (10/9)^x increases exponentially. So 10^x becomes much larger than 9^x. So after x=2, 10^x overtakes 9^x +19, so after that, 10^x is larger. So, the equation only holds at x=2.\n\nWait, but to make"

So between x=1.5 and 2, h(x) goes from -14.38 to 0. So the function is increasing here. So the only crossing is at x=2.
