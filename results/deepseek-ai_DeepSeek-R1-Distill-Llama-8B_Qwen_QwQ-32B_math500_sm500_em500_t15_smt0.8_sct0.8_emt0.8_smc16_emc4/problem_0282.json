This means every pair of terms can be grouped together to simplify the calculation.\n\nNext, I'll group the terms in pairs: \\((1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\\).\n\nEach pair of terms adds up to \\(-1\\), as shown by \\(1 - 2 = -1\\), \\(3 - 4 = -1\\), and so on.\n\nNow, I'll determine how many such pairs there are. Since the series starts at 1 and ends at 100, there are \\(100 / 2 = 50\\) pairs.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the sum of one pair by the number of pairs: \\(50 \\times (-1) = -50\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(-50\\).\n</think>\n\nTo compute the sum \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), let's analyze the series step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Group the Terms in Pairs**\n\nNotice that the series alternates between positive and negative signs. This allows us to group the terms in pairs for easier calculation:\n\n\\[\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify Each Pair**\n\nEach pair of terms adds up to \\(-1\\):\n\n\\[\n(1 - 2) = -1,\\quad (3 - 4) = -1,\\quad \\dots,\\quad (99 - 100) = -1\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Number of Pairs**\n\nSince the series starts at 1 and ends at 100, there are a total of \\(100\\) terms. Grouping them into pairs gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ pairs}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Sum**\n\nMultiply the sum of one pair by the number of pairs:\n\n\\[\n50 \\times (-1) = -50\n\\]\n\n**Final"
