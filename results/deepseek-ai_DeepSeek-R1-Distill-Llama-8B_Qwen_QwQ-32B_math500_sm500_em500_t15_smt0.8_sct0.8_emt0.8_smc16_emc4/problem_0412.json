The LCM of these two numbers will give the time in seconds when both gears return to their initial position simultaneously.\n\nFinally, I'll compute the LCM of 33.1667 and 45 to find the exact number of seconds after which both gears point due north together.\n</think>\n\nTo determine after how many seconds the two gears will both have their marks pointing due north again, we can follow these steps:\n\n### **Step 1: Understand Gear Rotations**\n- **Gear 1** turns **33\u202f1\u20443** times in a minute.\n- **Gear 2** turns **45** times in a minute.\n  \nTo make calculations easier, let's convert these rotations per minute to rotations per second:\n  \n\\[\n\\text{Rotations per second} = \\frac{\\text{Rotations per minute}}{60}\n\\]\n  \n- **Gear 1**: \\( \\frac{33\\frac{1}{3}}{60} = \\frac{100}{3}{60} = \\frac{100}{180} \\approx 0.5556 \\) rotations per second\n- **Gear 2**: \\( \\frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \\) rotations per second\n\n### **Step 2: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**\nThe gears will align their marks pointing north again when the number of rotations each has made is an integer multiple of their respective rotation periods. \n\nTo find when this happens, we can calculate the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of their rotation periods in seconds.\n\nHowever, since Gear 1's rotation is fractional, it's more practical to work with the original rotation rates in minutes.\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM of } 33\\frac{1}{3} \\text"
