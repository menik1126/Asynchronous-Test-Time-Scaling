This gives me (1 - 2), (3 - 4), (5 - 6), ..., (99 - 100).\n\nNext, I'll compute each pair. Each pair consists of a positive odd number followed by a negative even number. Calculating each pair: 1 - 2 = -1, 3 - 4 = -1, 5 - 6 = -1, and so on.\n\nSince there are 100 terms in total, there are 50 such pairs. Each pair has a value of -1, so the total sum is -1 multiplied by 50, which equals -50.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** Compute: \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\).\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe can approach the problem by grouping the terms in pairs:\n\n\\[\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n\\]\n\nEach pair simplifies as follows:\n\n\\[\n1 - 2 = -1 \\\\\n3 - 4 = -1 \\\\\n5 - 6 = -1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n99 - 100 = -1\n\\]\n\nThere are 100 terms in total, which means there are \\( \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\) pairs. Each pair equals \\(-1\\), so the sum is:\n\n\\[\n50 \\times (-1) = -50\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
