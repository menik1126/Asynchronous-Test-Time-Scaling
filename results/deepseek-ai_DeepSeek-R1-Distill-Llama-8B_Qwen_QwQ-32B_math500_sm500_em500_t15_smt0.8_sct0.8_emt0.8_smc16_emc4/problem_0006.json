            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about polynomials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet \\( P(x) \\) be a monic polynomial of degree 3. Suppose that \\( P(x) \\) has a remainder \\( R(x) \\) when it's divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), and a remainder \\( 2R(x) \\) when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\). Given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nOkay, so \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, which means it's of the form \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) because it's monic (leading coefficient is 1). \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what \\( R(x) \\) is. The problem mentions that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). Similarly, when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). \n\nI remember that when you divide a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) by a quadratic polynomial like \\( (x - a)(x - b) \\), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) will be a linear polynomial, i.e., of degree 1. So, \\( R(x) = mx + n \\) for some constants \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nSo, from the first division: \\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \\), where \\( Q_1(x) \\) is some linear polynomial (since \\( P(x) \\) is degree 3 and the divisor is quadratic, the quotient is degree 1). Similarly, from the second division: \\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\), where \\( Q_2(x) \\) is also linear.\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( P(x) \\), they must be equal to each other:\n\\[ (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R"
