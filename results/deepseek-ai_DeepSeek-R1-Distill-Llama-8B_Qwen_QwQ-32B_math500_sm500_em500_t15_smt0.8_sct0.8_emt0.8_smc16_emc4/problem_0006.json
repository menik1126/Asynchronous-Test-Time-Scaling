Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So, \\( P(x) \\) looks like \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a, b, c \\) are constants we need to find.\n\nThe problem states two things about the remainders when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by certain quadratic polynomials:\n\n1. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\).\n2. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\).\n\nWe're also given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nFirst, let me recall the Remainder Theorem and Polynomial Division. When a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by a linear divisor \\( (x - k) \\), the remainder is \\( P(k) \\). But here, we're dealing with quadratic divisors. So, the remainder when dividing by a quadratic is a linear polynomial, which I'll denote as \\( R(x) = mx + n \\).\n\nSo, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which factors into \\( (x - 1) \\) and \\( (x - 4) \\), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) satisfies two conditions:\n\n- \\( R(1) = P(1) \\) because plugging \\( x = 1 \\) into \\( P(x) \\) gives the remainder \\( R(1) \\).\n- Similarly, \\( R(4) = P(4) \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). So, this remainder, \\( 2R(x) \\), must satisfy:\n\n- \\( 2R(2) = P(2) \\)\n- \\( 2R(3"

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nSince \\( R(x) \\) is linear, we can write it as \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). So, plugging in the points we know:\n\nFrom \\( P(x) \\) divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), we have:\n\n1. \\( R(1) = P(1) = m(1) + n = m + n \\)\n2. \\( R(4) = P(4) = m(4) + n = 4m + n \\)\n\nFrom \\( P(x) \\) divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), we have:\n\n3. \\( 2R(2) = P(2) = 2(m(2) + n) = 4m + 2n \\)\n4. \\( 2R(3) = P(3) = 2(m(3) + n) = 6m + 2n \\)\n\nSo, now we have four equations:\n\n1. \\( m + n = P(1) \\)\n2. \\( 4m + n = P(4) \\)\n3. \\( 4m + 2n = P(2) \\)\n4. \\( 6m + 2n = P(3) \\)\n\nBut \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, so maybe I can express \\( P(x) \\) in terms of its remainders when divided by these quadratics. Alternatively, perhaps express \\( P(x) \\) as:\n\n\\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \\)\n\\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\)\n\nWhere \\( Q_1(x) \\) and \\( Q_2(x) \\) are linear polynomials since \\( P(x) \\) is cubic.
