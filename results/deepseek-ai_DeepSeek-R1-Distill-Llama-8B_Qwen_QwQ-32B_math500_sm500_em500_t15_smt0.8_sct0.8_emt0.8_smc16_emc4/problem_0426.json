It's given that this equation has 10 complex roots, which are paired as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). I need to find the value of the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3\\overline{r}_3} + \\frac{1}{r_4\\overline{r}_4} + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nFirst, let me think about what \\(r_k\\overline{r}_k\\) represents. Since \\(r_k\\) is a complex number, its conjugate \\(\\overline{r}_k\\) is just the same number with its imaginary part's sign flipped. The product \\(r_k\\overline{r}_k\\) is equal to \\(|r_k|^2\\), which is the square of the modulus of \\(r_k\\). So, \\(\\frac{1}{r_k\\overline{r}_k}\\) is the reciprocal of \\(|r_k|^2\\). \n\nSo, the sum I need to compute is \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_k|^2}\\). That is, I have to find the sum of the reciprocals of the squared magnitudes of each pair of complex roots.\n\nNow, the given equation is a polynomial of degree 10. Let's write it as:\n\\[\nx^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\n\\]\nBut actually, expanding this might be complicated. Perhaps I can factor the equation differently or use some substitution to simplify it.\n\nLet me consider dividing both sides by \\(x^{10}\\), assuming \\(x \\neq 0\\). So:\n\\[\n1 + \\left( \\frac{13x - 1}{x} \\right)^{10} = 0\n\\]\nSimplify the fraction inside the parentheses:\n\\[\n1 +"

Then, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n1 + y^{10} = 0\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\ny^{10} = -1\n\\]\nSo, the solutions for \\(y\\) are the 10th roots of \\(-1\\). The 10th roots of \\(-1\\) are the same as the 20th roots of unity that lie on the negative real axis, right? Because \\((-1)^{1/10}\\) has 10 roots, each separated by 36 degrees in the complex plane.\n\nBut to be precise, \\(y\\) must satisfy \\(y^{10} = -1\\), so each \\(y_k = e^{i\\pi(2k - 1)/10}\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, ..., 10\\). These are the 10th roots of \\(-1\\) since each root is at an angle of \\((2k - 1)\\pi/10\\) radians from the negative real axis.\n\nSo, the solutions for \\(y\\) are:\n\\[\ny_k = e^{i\\theta_k}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\theta_k = \\frac{(2k - 1)\\pi}{10} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad k = 1, 2, ..., 10\n\\]\n\nNow, remember that \\(y = 13 - \\frac{1}{x}\\), so we can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\):\n\\[\n13 - y = \\frac{1}{x} \\implies x = \\frac{1}{13 - y}\n\\]\nThus, each root \\(x_k\\) of the original equation corresponds to a \\(y_k\\), specifically:\n\\[\nx_k = \\frac{1}{13 - y_k}\n\\]\nBut since our original equation is 10th degree, we have 10 roots, and each \\(x_k\\) is paired with its conjugate, because the coefficients of the polynomial are real. Hence, if \\(x\\) is a root, so is \\(\\overline{x}\\).\n\nWait, but I should verify if that's the case. The polynomial is \\(x^{10"

Therefore, the roots are indeed paired as \\(r_k\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_k\\).\n\nTherefore, each pair \\(r_k\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_k\\) corresponds to two roots \\(x_k\\) and \\(x_{\\overline{k}}\\), which are conjugates. \n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of \\(1/(r_k \\overline{r}_k)\\) over k from 1 to 5. Since \\(r_k \\overline{r}_k = |r_k|^2\\), so each term is \\(1/|r_k|^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum is the sum over all the roots (but since they come in conjugate pairs, each pair contributes twice the same term, but since we are only summing over the distinct pairs, we just need to compute each term once for each pair and add them up).\n\nAlternatively, since each pair contributes \\(1/|r_k|^2 + 1/|\\overline{r}_k|^2 = 2/|r_k|^2\\), but wait, no. Wait, actually, the problem lists the roots as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), etc., so the terms in the sum are each \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r}_j)\\), so each pair contributes one term. Because each pair is represented once in the sum. So, for each pair, we have one term. Since there are 5 pairs, the sum is over 5 terms, each being \\(1/(r_k \\overline{r}_k)\\).\n\nTherefore, the key is to compute \\(1/|r_k|^2\\) for each pair, then sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this sum without having to find each root individually. Maybe using Vieta's formula?\n\nLet me think. Vieta's formula relates the sum and products of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. However, since the polynomial is of degree 10, and the roots come in conjugate pairs, perhaps we can consider the polynomial in terms of its factors.\n\n"

Since the original equation has real coefficients, if \\(x\\) is a root, then \\(\\overline{x}\\) is also a root. Let me see if the mapping from \\(y\\) to \\(x\\) preserves conjugation.\n\nSuppose \\(y\\) is a root of \\(y^{10} = -1\\), then \\(\\overline{y}\\) is also a root because \\(|\\overline{y}| = 1\\), and \\(\\overline{y}^{10} = \\overline{y^{10}} = \\overline{-1} = -1\\).

But \\(|13 - y_k|^2\\) is a real number, so its conjugate is itself. Therefore, \\(|13 - \\overline{y}_k|^2 = |13 - y_k|^2\\).

Each term is 1/(|r_k|\u00b2). Each |r_k|\u00b2 is |x_k|\u00b2.\n\nFrom before, |x_k|\u00b2 = 1 / |13 - y_k|\u00b2. Therefore, 1/|x_k|\u00b2 = |13 - y_k|\u00b2.

The roots y_k are the 10th roots of -1, so they are the solutions to y^{10} = -1. The sum of all roots of the equation y^{10} + 1 = 0 is indeed zero, because the coefficient of y^9 is zero. Therefore, the sum of all y_k is zero. The real part of this sum is the sum of cos(theta_k), and the imaginary part is the sum of sin(theta_k). Since the total sum is zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. Therefore, sum_{k=1}^{10} cos(theta_k) = 0 and sum_{k=1}^{10} sin(theta_k) = 0. Therefore, that step is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total sum over all roots of 1/|x_k|\u00b2 is 10*170 - 26*0 = 1700.
