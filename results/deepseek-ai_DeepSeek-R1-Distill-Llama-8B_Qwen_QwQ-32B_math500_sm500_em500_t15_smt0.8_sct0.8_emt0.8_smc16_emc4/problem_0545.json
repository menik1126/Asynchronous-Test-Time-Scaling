First, I'll identify how many stamps from each country he bought during that decade.\n\nFrom the chart:\n- Brazil: 8 stamps\n- France: 12 stamps\n- Peru: 12 stamps\n- Spain: 6 stamps\n\nAdding these together, there are a total of 48 stamps from the 70s.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total cost for all 70s stamps. The prices per country are:\n- Brazil: 8 stamps \u00d7 $6$ cents = $48$ cents\n- France: 12 stamps \u00d7 $7$ cents = $84$ cents\n- Peru: 12 stamps \u00d7 $4$ cents = $48$ cents\n- Spain: 6 stamps \u00d7 $5$ cents = $30$ cents\n\nAdding these, the total cost is $48 + $84 + $48 + $30 = $210$ cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per 70s stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the number of 70s stamps:\n$210$ cents \u00f7 $48$ stamps \u2248 $4.375$ cents per stamp.\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth of a cent, the average price is approximately $4.4$ cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's 70's stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the number of stamps per country in the 70's:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 stamps\n   - **France:** 17 stamps\n   - **Peru:** 12 stamps\n   - **Spain:** 6 stamps\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of 70's stamps:**\n   \\[\n   12 + 17 + 12 + 6 = 47 \\text{ stamps}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for all 70's stamps:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\(12 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents} = 72 \\text{ cents}\\)\n   - **France:** \\(17 \\text{ stamps} \\times 7 \\text{ cents} = 119 \\text{ cents}\\)\n   - **Peru:** \\(12 \\text{ stamps} \\times 4 \\text{ cents} = 48 \\text{ cents}\\)\n   - **Spain:** \\(6 \\text{ stamps} \\times "
