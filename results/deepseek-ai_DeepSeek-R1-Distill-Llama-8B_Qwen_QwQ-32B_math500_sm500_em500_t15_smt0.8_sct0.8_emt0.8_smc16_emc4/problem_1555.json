This means we need to account for rotational symmetry when counting the total number of arrangements.\n\nNext, we can fix one person's position to eliminate equivalent configurations caused by rotation. By fixing one person, we effectively reduce the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people around the table.\n\nAfter fixing one person's position, we can consider the linear arrangements of the remaining people. Since the table is square, each side will have 2 people. We can treat each side as a linear arrangement, but we must account for the rotational nature of the table.\n\nBy fixing one person, we reduce the number of rotational symmetries, allowing us to calculate the distinct seating arrangements without overcounting due to rotation.\n\nFinally, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the remaining people on each side, considering the constraints imposed by the fixed positions, to find the total number of distinct seating configurations.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side. We'll account for rotational symmetry to avoid overcounting equivalent configurations.\n\n**Step 1: Fix a Person's Position**\n\nTo eliminate rotational symmetry, we can fix one person's seat. This reduces the problem to arranging the remaining **7** people around the table.\n\n**Step 2: Divide the Remaining Seats**\n\nWith one person fixed, the remaining 7 seats form a circular arrangement. However, since we're dealing with a square table, we can divide these seats into **2** groups of **3.5** seats each (rounded to **2** on each side of the fixed position and the remaining **2**).\n\n**Step 3: Arrange the First Group**\n\nThere are **7!** ways to arrange the remaining **7** people in a circle.\n\nBut wait, in this case, since we've fixed one person and divided the seats into two sides, the arrangement is linear on each side.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Linear Arrangements**\n\nEach side of the table will have **2** people, but since one position is already fixed, each side can be considered a straight line with **2** seats.\n\nHowever, since the table is square, rotations can still affect"

Fixing one person's position removes rotational symmetry, so we can treat the remaining seats as a linear arrangement.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Permutations**\n\nAfter fixing one person, the remaining **7** people can be arranged in **7!** ways. However, since the table has rotational symmetry, we must divide by the number of rotational symmetries (4 rotations: 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0). But since we fixed one person, we've already accounted for rotational symmetry, so division isn't needed here.\n\nWait, actually, fixing one person's position already accounts for rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is simply **7!**.\n\nBut let's verify this with another approach.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nImagine the square table has 4 sides, each with 2 seats. Fixing one person at a specific seat removes rotational symmetry. The remaining 7 people can be arranged in the remaining 7 seats. Since the seats are now in a fixed order (relative to the fixed person), the number of arrangements is **7!**.\n\nHowever, each side of the table has two seats, but since we've fixed the starting point, the order of people on each side matters. Thus, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is indeed **7!**.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\n\\[\n7! = 5040\n\\]\n\nWait, but this might not account for reflections. The problem states that rotations are considered equivalent, but reflections are not mentioned. If reflections are considered distinct, then **7!** is correct. However, if reflections are also considered equivalent, we would divide by 2. But the problem specifies only rotations as equivalent, so reflections are distinct.\n\nThus, the final answer is **7! = 5040**.\n\nWait, but another thought: when arranging around a table with fixed rotation, the formula for circular permutations is (n-1)! for indistinct rotations. Here, since we fixed one person, it's linear, so n!.\n\nWait, actually, when arranging people around a circular table, the formula is (n-1)! because rotations are equivalent. But here, by fixing one person, we convert it to a linear arrangement, so the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7!.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **7! = 5040**.\n\n"
