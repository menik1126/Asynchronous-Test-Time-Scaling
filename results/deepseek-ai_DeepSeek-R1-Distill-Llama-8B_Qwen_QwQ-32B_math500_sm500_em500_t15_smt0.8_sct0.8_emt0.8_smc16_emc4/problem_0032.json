            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of the number 284.\n\nProper divisors of a number are all its positive divisors excluding the number itself.\n\nTo determine the proper divisors of 284, I'll perform prime factorization. Breaking down 284, I find that it's equal to 2 multiplied by 2 and 71. So, the prime factors are 2\u00b2 and 71\u00b9.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (2\u00b2 + 1) times (71\u00b9 + 1), I calculate the sum of all divisors of 284.\n\nThis gives me (4 + 1) times (71 + 1) = 5 \u00d7 72 = 360. This represents the sum of all divisors, including 284 itself.\n\nSince the problem asks for the sum of proper divisors, I subtract 284 from this total: 360 - 284 = 76.\n\nFinally, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 76. I'll identify the proper divisors of 76, which are 1, 2, 4, and 19.\n\nAdding these together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 19 = 26.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 26.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA proper divisor of an integer \\( N \\) is a positive divisor of \\( N \\) that is less than \\( N \\). Given that the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, we need to find the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\n**Step 1: Find the Proper Divisors of 284**\nFirst, we need to determine the proper divisors of 284.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n   - 284 divided by 2 is 142.\n   - 142 divided by 2 is 71.\n   - 71 is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, \\( 284 = 2^2 \\times 71^1 \\).\n\n2. **Sum of Proper Divisors:**\n   - Use the formula for the sum of divisors:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum of div"

Alternatively, since the prime factors are known, we can list all divisors:\n     - Divisors of \\( 2^2 \\) are 1, 2, 4.\n     - Divisors of \\( 71^1 \\) are 1, 71.\n     - All divisors of 284 are products of these:\n       \\( 1, 2, 4, 71, 2 \\times 71 = 142, 4 \\times 71 = 284 \\).\n     - Proper divisors exclude 284 itself, so they are: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142.\n     - Sum of proper divisors: \\( 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220 \\).\n\nWait, but in my initial reasoning I thought the sum was 76. That was a mistake. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the prime factorization step. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 284 divided by 2 is 142, divided by 2 again is 71. So prime factors are indeed \\( 2^2 \\times 71^1"
