            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number except the number itself.\n\nTo do this, I'll start by performing prime factorization on 284. I'll begin by checking if 284 is even, which it is, so it's divisible by 2.\n\nNext, I'll divide 284 by 2 to get 142. I'll continue factoring 142, which is also even, so it's divisible by 2 again. Dividing 142 by 2 gives me 71.\n\nNow, I'll check if 71 is a prime number. Since 71 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, it is indeed a prime.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (2\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) \u00d7 (1 + 71), I can find the sum of all divisors of 284. However, since I only need the sum of proper divisors, I'll subtract 284 from this total.\n\nCalculating the sum of proper divisors gives me 496.\n\nFinally, I'll find the sum of the proper divisors of 496. Repeating the process, I start by factoring 496. It is even, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 496 by 2 repeatedly yields 248, 124, 62, and 31.\n\nChecking if 31 is a prime, it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, so it is prime. Therefore, the prime factorization of 496 is 2\u2074 \u00d7 31.\n\nApplying the sum of divisors formula again, (2\u2074 + 1\u00b2) \u00d7 (1 + 31), and subtracting 496 to get the sum of proper divisors, which is 496.\n\nThe sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is therefore 496.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n\n- **Prime factorization of 284:**\n  - 284 \u00f7 2 = 142\n  - 142 \u00f7 2 = 71\n  - 71 is a"
