Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the distance from a point to another point can be found using the distance formula. So, if I have a point \\( (x, y) \\) on the graph, the distance from the origin \\( (0,0) \\) to \\( (x, y) \\) is given by \\( \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nSince the point \\( (x, y) \\) lies on the given graph, it must satisfy the equation \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). So, I can substitute \\( y \\) in the distance formula with this expression. That gives me the distance \\( d \\) as:\n\n\\( d = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I can work through it step by step. Let me square both sides to make it easier to handle, since the square of the distance will be the same as the square of the distance from the origin.\n\nSo, \\( d^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\)\n\nLet me compute that squared term. \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\) is equal to \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\times (x^2 - 3)^2 \\).

Thus, the point is (√2, -1/√2). Similarly, when x=-√2, y= -1/√2 as well. So, the same result.\n\nThus, the minimal distance is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt(2 + 1/2) = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is a=10, b=2, so a+b=12.\n\nSo, after all these methods, I'm confident the answer is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), we start by expressing the distance from the origin to a point \\((x, y)\\) on the graph using the distance formula.
