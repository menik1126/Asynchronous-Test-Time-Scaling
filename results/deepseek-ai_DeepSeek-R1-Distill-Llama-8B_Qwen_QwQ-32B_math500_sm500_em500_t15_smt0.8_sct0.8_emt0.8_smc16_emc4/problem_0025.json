Let me start by recognizing that (1 - i) is a complex number.\n\nTo raise a complex number to a power, it's helpful to express it in polar form. So, I'll first find the magnitude of (1 - i). The magnitude is the square root of (1 squared plus (-1) squared), which is sqrt(2).\n\nNext, I'll determine the angle (argument) that (1 - i) makes with the positive real axis. Since (1 - i) is in the fourth quadrant, the angle is -45 degrees or 315 degrees, which is equivalent to 7\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nNow, I can rewrite (1 - i) in polar form as sqrt(2) * (cos(-45\u00b0) + i sin(-45\u00b0)). Using De Moivre's Theorem, raising this to the 8th power means I'll raise the magnitude to the 8th power and multiply the angle by 8.\n\nCalculating the magnitude: (sqrt(2))^8 = (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16.\n\nFor the angle: 8 * (-45\u00b0) = -360\u00b0, which is equivalent to 0\u00b0 because angles are periodic with 360\u00b0. This means the direction is along the positive real axis.\n\nCombining these results, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is simply the magnitude, which is 16. So, the final answer is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express \\(1 - i\\) in Polar Form:**\n   - **Magnitude:** \\( |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n   - **Angle:** Since \\(1 - i\\) lies in the fourth quadrant, the angle (argument) is \\( -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians or \\( 315^\\circ \\).\n\n   Therefore, \\(1 - i\\) can be represented in polar form as:\n   \\[\n   1 - i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i \\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\right)\n   \\"
