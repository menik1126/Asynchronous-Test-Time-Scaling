            "output": "To convert the fraction \\( \\frac{57}{160} \\) to a terminating decimal, I first need to understand the conditions under which a fraction will result in a terminating decimal. A fraction will always terminate if, in its simplest form, the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 or 5.\n\nNext, I'll factorize the denominator, 160. Breaking it down, 160 can be divided by 2 to get 80, and then by 2 again to obtain 40. Dividing by 2 once more gives 20, and one final division by 2 results in 10. Finally, dividing by 2 once more yields 5.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 160 are \\( 2^5 \\times 5^1 \\). Since all the prime factors of the denominator are 2 and 5, the fraction is already in a form that will convert to a terminating decimal.\n\nNow, I'll perform the division of 57 by 160 to find the decimal equivalent. Setting up the division, I multiply 160 by 0.35, which gives me 56. The remainder is 1. Bringing down a zero, the new divisor becomes 10, and dividing 10 by 160 gives 0.00625. Adding this to the previous result, I get the terminating decimal 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\( \\frac{57}{160} \\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Condition for Terminating Decimals**:\n   - A fraction \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) will result in a terminating decimal if the prime factors of the denominator \\( b \\) consist **only** of 2 and/or 5.\n\n2. **Factorize the Denominator**:\n   - Start by breaking down 160 into its prime factors.\n     \\[\n     160 = 2 \\times 80 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 40 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 20 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 10 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n     \\]\n   - Since the prime factors of 160 are only 2 and 5, \\( \\frac{57}{160} \\) is already in the form that will convert to a terminating decimal.\n\n3."
