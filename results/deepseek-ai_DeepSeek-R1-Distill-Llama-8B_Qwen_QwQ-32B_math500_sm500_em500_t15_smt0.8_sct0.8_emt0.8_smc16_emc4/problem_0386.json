I can set up the equation \\( 45\\pi = \\pi r^2 h \\).\n\nSince we're looking for the height \\( h \\), I need to solve for \\( h \\). I'll divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\pi \\) to simplify it, which gives me \\( 45 = r^2 h \\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by \\( r^2 \\), resulting in \\( h = \\frac{45}{r^2} \\).\n\nFinally, I substitute the given radius \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters into the equation. This means \\( h = \\frac{45}{3^2} = \\frac{45}{9} = 5 \\) centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo find the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, we'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius,\n- \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nGiven:\n- Volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters,\n- Radius \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters.\n\n**Step 1:** Plug the known values into the formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
