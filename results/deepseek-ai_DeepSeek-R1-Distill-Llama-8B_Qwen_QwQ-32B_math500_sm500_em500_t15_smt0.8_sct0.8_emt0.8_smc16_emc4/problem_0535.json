Each of them wants to order one dish, but they don't want to order the same dish. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many choices Yann has for his dish. Since there are 10 dishes available, Yann can choose any of them. So, Yann has 10 possible options.\n\nNext, after Yann has chosen his dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish as Yann. That means Camille only has 9 remaining options to choose from.\n\nTo find the total number of different meal combinations they can have, I multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has after Yann has made his selection. \n\nSo, the total number of combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 different combinations of meals that Yann and Camille can order without having the same dish.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order without choosing the same dish, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine Yann's Choices:**\n   - There are **10** dishes available on the menu.\n   - Yann can choose **any one** of these 10 dishes.\n\n2. **Determine Camille's Choices:**\n   - After Yann has chosen a dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish.\n   - Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining options.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Combinations:**\n   - For each of Yann's choices, Camille has 9 options.\n   - So, the total number of combinations = Yann's choices \u00d7 Camille's choices = 10 \u00d7 9 = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
