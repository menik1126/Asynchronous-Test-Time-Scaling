I'll begin by determining the highest power of six that fits into the number 999.\n\nCalculating the powers of six:\n6^0 = 1\n6^1 = 6\n6^2 = 36\n6^3 = 216\n6^4 = 1296\n\nSince 6^4 is 1296, which is greater than 999, I'll use 6^3 (216) as the starting power.\n\nNext, I'll divide 999 by 216 to find out how many groups of 216 fit into 999.\n999 \u00f7 216 = 4 with a remainder.\n\n4 times 216 is 864. Subtracting this from 999 gives a remainder of 135.\n\nNow, I'll take the remainder of 135 and divide it by the next lower power of six, which is 6^2 (36).\n135 \u00f7 36 = 3 with a remainder.\n\n3 times 36 is 108. Subtracting this from 135 leaves a remainder of 27.\n\nMoving on, I'll take the remainder of 27 and divide it by 6^1 (6).\n27 \u00f7 6 = 4 with a remainder.\n\n4 times 6 is 24. Subtracting this from 27 gives a remainder of 3.\n\nFinally, I'll take the remainder of 3 and divide it by 6^0 (1).\n3 \u00f7 1 = 3 with no remainder.\n\nPutting all the digits together, the base six equivalent is 4 3 4 3.\n\nTherefore, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 4343_6.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Base Six:**\n   - In base six, each digit represents a power of six. The powers of six are:\n     \\[\n     6^0 = 1,\\quad 6^1 = 6,\\quad 6^2 = 36,\\quad 6^3 = 216,\\quad 6^4 = 1296,\\quad \\text{and so on}.\n     \\]\n   - We start by finding the highest power of six that fits into"
