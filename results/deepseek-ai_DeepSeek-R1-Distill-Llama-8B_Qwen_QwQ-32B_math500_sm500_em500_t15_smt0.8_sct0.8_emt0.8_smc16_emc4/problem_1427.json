A perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power is a number that can be expressed as some integer raised to the power of \\( n \\). So, \\( 2^{24} \\) must be equal to \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nNext, I'll factorize \\( 2^{24} \\) to analyze its prime components. \\( 2^{24} \\) can be written as \\( 2^{24} = 2^{24} \\). This shows that \\( 2^{24} \\) is already a power of 2.\n\nNow, \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( (2^{m})^n \\), where \\( m \\) is an integer. To find all possible values of \\( n > 1 \\), I need to determine the divisors of 24, since \\( n \\) must divide 24.\n\nI'll list all the divisors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. However, since \\( n > 1 \\), I'll exclude 1 from the list. This leaves me with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 as possible values for \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 7 positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nFor how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) is it true that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power?\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding Perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) Power:**\n   - A number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if it can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Expressing \\( 2^{24} \\) as a Power:**\n   - \\( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \\), where \\( m"
