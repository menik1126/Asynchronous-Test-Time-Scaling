Denali walks 16 dogs, and Nate walks 12 dogs.\n\nUnder the new policy, Denali's pay ratio to Nate's pay must remain the same in two scenarios:\n1. If Denali walks 4x more dogs while Nate stays at 12 dogs.\n2. If x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n\nSet up the ratios based on these scenarios and solve for x.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - **Initial Dogs:**\n     - Denali walks **16** dogs.\n     - Nate walks **12** dogs.\n     - **Total Dogs:**  \\(16 + 12 = 28\\) dogs.\n\n2. **Understand the Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Denali walks \\(16 + 4x\\) dogs, and Nate walks **12** dogs.\n   - **Scenario 2:** Denali walks \\(16 + x\\) dogs (since \\(x\\) dogs are reassigned from Nate), and Nate walks \\(12 - x\\) dogs.\n\n3. **Set Up the Ratios:**\n   \n   - **Initial Pay Ratio (Denali : Nate):**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **After Scenario 1:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **After Scenario 2:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\) Using Scenario 1:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n   \\]\n   \n   Multiply both sides by 12:\n   \\[\n   16 + 4x = 16\n   \\]\n   \n   Subtract 16 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   4x = 0 \\implies x = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   However, \\(x \\neq 0\\), so we discard this solution and use Scenario 2.\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\) Using Scenario 2:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{16 + x"

This indicates that under the given conditions, the ratio cannot be maintained unless \\(x = 0\\), but since \\(x \\neq 0\\), there might be an inconsistency in the problem.\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0}\n   \\]"

Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
