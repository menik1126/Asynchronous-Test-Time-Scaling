But let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I can see if there's a way to simplify or factor the equation. Sometimes, with equations like this, there might be a common factor or a substitution that can make things easier.\n\nLooking at the terms inside the cubes, I notice that (x - 3) and (x - 7) are on the left side. If I add those two expressions together, maybe that can help. Let me try that:\n\n(x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10.\n\nOh wait a minute! That's exactly the same as the right side of the equation. So (2x - 10)^3 is the cube of the sum of (x - 3) and (x - 7). Interesting. That might be useful.\n\nI remember there's an identity for the cube of a sum: (a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b). Maybe I can apply that here. Let me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 7). Then:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = [(x - 3) + (x - 7)]^3 - 3(x - 3)(x - 7)(x - 3 + x - 7).\n\nSo that means:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3 - 3(x - 3)(x - 7)(2x - 10).\n\nWait, but the original equation says that (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 equals (2x - 10)^3. So substituting what I just found:\n\n(2x - 10)^3 - 3(x - 3)(x - 7)(2x - 10) = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHmm, okay, if I subtract (2x - 10)^3 from both sides, I get:\n\n-3(x - 3)(x - 7)("

            "output": "2x - 10) = 0.\n\nSo that simplifies things a lot. Now, I can set each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. -3 = 0 \u2192 Wait, that can't happen. So, this doesn't contribute any solution.\n\n2. (x - 3) = 0 \u2192 So x = 3.\n\n3. (x - 7) = 0 \u2192 So x = 7.\n\n4. (2x - 10) = 0 \u2192 2x = 10 \u2192 x = 5.\n\nSo the possible solutions are x = 3, x = 5, and x = 7. But wait, I should check if these are indeed roots of the original equation. Sometimes, when we manipulate equations, especially cubing terms, we might introduce extraneous solutions or lose some.\n\nLet me check each of them one by one.\n\nFirst, x = 3:\n\nLeft side: (3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0^3 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64.\n\nRight side: (2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 - 10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64.\n\nSo both sides are equal. Good.\n\nNext, x = 5:\n\nLeft side: (5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0.\n\nRight side: (2*5 - 10)^3 = (10 - 10)^3 = 0^3 = 0.\n\nSo both sides are 0. That works.\n\nNow, x = 7:\n\nLeft side: (7 - 3)^3 + (7 - 7)^3 = (4)^3 + 0^3 = 64 + 0 = 64.\n\nRight side: (2*7 - 10)^3 = (14 - 10)^3 = 4^3 = 64.\n\nBoth sides are equal. So all three solutions are valid.\n\nWait, but hold on. When I set up the identity, I used the fact that a + b = (2x -10). So when I substituted, I transformed the original equation into a new one that didn't have the cubic terms. But in doing so, did I miss any other possible solutions?\n\n"

Because the identity I used is an algebraic identity that holds for all x, so as long as the manipulations are valid, the solutions I found should be the only ones. Let me double-check the equation again.\n\nStarting over, the original equation is:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nWe can set a = x - 3 and b = x - 7, then a + b = 2x - 10, which is the cube on the right side. Using the identity:\n\na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b).\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n(a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) = (a + b)^3.\n\nSubtracting (a + b)^3 from both sides:\n\n-3ab(a + b) = 0.\n\nSo, either a = 0 (x = 3), b = 0 (x =7), or (a + b) = 0 (2x -10 =0 \u2192 x=5). So that covers all possible solutions.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x = 3, 5, 7.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any other possible solutions because any other x would not satisfy the equation, so these three are the only roots.\n</think>\n\nAlright, so after working through the problem, the roots are x = 3, 5, and 7.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Given Equation:**\n   \\[\n   (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify Components:**\n   Let \\( a = x - 3 \\) and \\( b = x - 7 \\).
