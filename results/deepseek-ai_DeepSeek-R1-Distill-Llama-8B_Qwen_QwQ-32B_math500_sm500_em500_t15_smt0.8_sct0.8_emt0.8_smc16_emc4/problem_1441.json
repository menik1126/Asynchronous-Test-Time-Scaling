I remember that exponential equations can sometimes be tricky because they grow so quickly, but maybe I can find a way to simplify this.\n\nFirst, I notice that 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, right? Because when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, 3^{2x} is really (9)^x. So I can rewrite the equation as 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That seems a bit simpler.\n\nNow, I have 9^x and 10^x. Hmm, maybe I can write both sides in terms of the same base or find a substitution. Let me think... Let's set y = 9^x. Then, since 10^x is a bit different, maybe I can relate it to y somehow. I know that 10^x is equal to (9 + 1)^x, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, I can write 10^x as (10/9)^x * 9^x, which would be (10/9)^x * y. Maybe that's useful. Let me try that.\n\nSo, substituting y in, the equation becomes:\ny + 19 = (10/9)^x * y\n\nHmm, I can factor out y on both sides:\ny + 19 = y * (10/9)^x\n\nNow, I want to isolate x, but it's inside an exponent which complicates things. Maybe I can rearrange the equation to solve for (10/9)^x.\n\nSo, let's subtract y from both sides:\n19 = y * (10/9)^x - y\n\nFactor y out:\n19 = y * ( (10/9)^x - 1 )\n\nNow, I can solve for (10/9)^x:\n(10/9)^x = (19 / y) + 1\n\nBut remember, y is 9^x, so substituting back in:\n(10/9)^x = (19 / 9^x) + 1\n\nHmm, this seems a bit circular because now I have (10/9)^x expressed in terms of 9^x. Maybe I can take logs on both sides"

Let's try x=1 first.\n\nTesting x=1:\nLeft side: 3^{2(1)} +19 = 9 +19 =28\nRight side:10^1=10\n28\u226010, so nope.\n\nx=2:\nLeft:3^4 +19=81+19=100\nRight:10^2=100\nOh! Wait, that works. So x=2 is a solution.\n\nHmm, so maybe x=2 is a solution. Let me check x=0 just in case.\n\nx=0:\nLeft:3^0 +19=1+19=20\nRight:10^0=1\n20\u22601, so no.\n\nx=3:\nLeft:3^6 +19=729+19=748\nRight:10^3=1000\n748 <1000, so not equal.\n\nHmm, so x=2 works. But maybe there's another solution? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the equation 9^x +19 =10^x. Let's consider the behavior of both sides as x increases. The right side, 10^x, grows faster than 9^x, so for large x, 10^x will dominate. But at x=2, they are equal. Let's check x=1.5 to see what happens.\n\nx=1.5:\nLeft: 9^1.5 = sqrt(9^3) = sqrt(729)=27? Wait, no. Wait, 9^1.5 is 9^(3/2) = (sqrt(9))^3 = 3^3 =27. So left side is 27 +19=46.\n\nRight side:10^1.5 = sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)\u224831.62. So 46 vs 31.62, so left is bigger here.\n\nAt x=2, they are equal. Let's check x=2."

So left is 262, right is ~316, so now left is less than right.\n\nSo between x=1.5 and x=2, left goes from 46 to 100, right goes from ~31.62 to 100. At x=2, they meet.\n\nWait, but when I checked x=1.5, left was 46, right was ~31.62. So left > right at x=1.5, equal at x=2, and at x=2.5, left=262, right\u2248316, so left < right.\n\nSo perhaps x=2 is the only solution because when x increases beyond 2, right grows faster and overtakes left, but before x=2, left is larger than right. Wait, but wait, at x=0, left is 20, right is1. So left is bigger, but when does left catch up with right?\n\nWait, maybe I should check x=0.5:\n\nx=0.5:\nLeft:9^0.5=3, so 3+19=22\nRight:10^0.5\u22483.162\nSo left=22, right\u22483.16, so left > right.\n\nSo, it seems that for x=0, left=20, right=1; x=0.5, left=22, right\u22483.16; x=1, left=28, right=10; x=1.5, left=46, right\u224831.62; x=2, left=100, right=100; x=2.5, left=262, right\u2248316; x=3, left\u2248748, right=1000.\n\nSo the left side is always above the right until x=2, where both are 100. Then, after that, right overtakes left.\n\nWait, but is there a point where left is equal to right again beyond x=2? Let's check x=4:\n\nLeft:9^4=6561, so left=6561"

So that's the only solution?\n\nWait, but maybe there's another solution for x negative?\n\nLet me check x=-1:\n\nLeft:3^{2*(-1)} +19 = 3^{-2} +19 = 1/9 +19 \u224819.111\n\nRight:10^{-1}=0.1\n\nSo left is way bigger. So for negative x, left is still bigger. So maybe the only solution is x=2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another solution between x=2 and x=3? Wait, at x=2.5, left is 262 vs right 316, so right is bigger. At x=3, left is 729+19=748 vs 1000. So right is still bigger. So after x=2, right is always bigger. So the only point where they cross is at x=2. So that's the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another solution when x is less than 2? Let's see. Let me check between x=1 and x=2. Wait, at x=1, left is 28 vs right 10. So left is bigger. At x=2, they are equal. So the left decreases from 28 to 100? Wait, no, 9^x increases as x increases. Wait, 9^1 is 9, 9^2 is 81, so left side is increasing. Wait, so between x=1 and x=2, left goes from 28 to 100, right goes from 10 to 100. So they meet at x=2. So before that, left is always above right. So the only crossing point is at x=2. So that's the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x=2. Let me check once more.\n\nPlugging x=2 into original equation: 3^{4} +19 =81+19=100, and 10^2=100."
