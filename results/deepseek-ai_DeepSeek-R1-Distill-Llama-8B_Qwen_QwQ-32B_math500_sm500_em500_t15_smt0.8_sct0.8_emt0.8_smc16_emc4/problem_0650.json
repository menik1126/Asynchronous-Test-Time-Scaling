            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about quadratic polynomials. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe problem says that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. It satisfies the inequality x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for all real numbers x. Also, we know that P(11) = 181. We need to find P(16).\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, it must be of the form P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers. So, I can write P(x) as ax\u00b2 + bx + c.\n\nNow, the problem gives me two quadratic functions that bound P(x) from below and above. So, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for all real x. That means P(x) is squeezed between these two functions for every x.\n\nLet me write down the inequalities:\n\n1. P(x) \u2265 x\u00b2 - 2x + 2\n2. P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3\n\nSince both inequalities must hold for all real x, their difference must be non-positive and non-negative respectively. So, subtracting the first inequality from the second, I get:\n\n2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) \u2265 0\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 - x\u00b2 + 2x - 2 = (2x\u00b2 - x\u00b2) + (-4x + 2x) + (3 - 2) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1\n\nThis simplifies to x\u00b2 - 2x + 1, which is a perfect square: (x - 1)\u00b2. So, (x - 1)\u00b2 \u2265 0.\n\nBut since a square is always non-negative, this is always true. So, the difference is always non-negative, meaning that the upper bound is always above the lower bound. Therefore, these two quadratics do not intersect except possibly at some points.\n\nWait, let me check if (x - 1)\u00b2 is zero. Yes, when x=1, it's zero. So, at"

            "output": " x=1, the upper and lower bounds must both be equal to P(1). Because if the difference is zero at x=1, then P(1) must equal both x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and 2x\u00b2 -4x +3 when x=1. Let me confirm that:\n\nCompute x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 at x=1: 1 - 2 + 2 = 1.\n\nCompute 2x\u00b2 -4x + 3 at x=1: 2 -4 +3 = 1.\n\nYes, so at x=1, both bounds are equal to 1, so P(1) must equal 1.\n\nThat gives me a point that P(1) = 1. So that's another condition on the quadratic polynomial.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n1. P(x) is quadratic: ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\n2. For all x, x\u00b2 -2x +2 \u2264 ax\u00b2 + bx + c \u2264 2x\u00b2 -4x +3\n\n3. P(1) = 1 and P(11)=181\n\nWe need to find P(16).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think how to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can consider the inequalities. Let me define the lower bound as L(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and the upper bound as U(x)=2x\u00b2 -4x +3.\n\nThen we have L(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 U(x) for all real x. Since both L and U are quadratics, perhaps P(x) is \"between\" them at every point.\n\nSince P(x) is a quadratic, the difference between P(x) and L(x) must be a quadratic or lower degree (but since both are quadratics, it's also quadratic). Similarly, the difference between U(x) and P(x) is also a quadratic.\n\nMoreover, since L(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 U(x), then P - L \u2265 0 and U - P \u2265 0 for all real x.\n\nTherefore, both P - L and U - P are non-negative quadratics for all real x. Therefore, those quadratics cannot have a real root and must open upwards (so their leading coefficients are non-negative) or they can have double roots but still be always non-negative.\n\nSimilarly, for the quadratic Q1(x) ="

So, for Q1 and Q2, either:\n\n1. The leading coefficient is positive, and discriminant \u2264 0, or\n\n2.

Wait, but let me think.\n\nBut given that both Q1 and Q2 are always non-negative, perhaps the only way that can happen is if the quadratics are squares or perfect squares scaled by positive constants.\n\nWait, another approach: since P(x) lies between L(x) and U(x) for all x, perhaps the difference between P and L is a positive semidefinite quadratic, and the difference between U and P is another positive semidefinite quadratic. \n\nFurthermore, since P is a quadratic, then those differences Q1(x) and Q2(x) must themselves be quadratics. Therefore, Q1 and Q2 must be positive semidefinite quadratics.\n\nWhich would require that both have their leading coefficients non-negative and discriminant non-positive.\n\nAdditionally, in order for P(x) to be a quadratic that's between L and U, the only way that can happen is that P(x) coincides with both L(x) and U(x) at some points.

Since a + b + c =1, this is 1 -1 =0. So Q2(1)=0.\n\nTherefore, both Q1 and Q2 have a root at x=1. Since they are non-negative quadratics, they must have a double root at x=1.

So, their vertex is at that point, so it's a double root.\n\nTherefore, Q1(x) and Q2(x) can be written as k(x -1)^2, where k \u22650.\n\nWait, but Q1(x) is a quadratic, so if it has a double root at x=1, then it can be written as Q1(x) = m(x -1)^2, where m \u22650.\n\nSimilarly, Q2(x) = n(x -1)^2, where n \u22650.\n\nTherefore, since Q1(x) = (a -1)x\u00b2 + (b +2)x + (c -2) = m(x -1)^2,\n\nand Q2(x) = (2 -a)x\u00b2 + (-4 -b)x + (3 -c) = n(x -1)^2.\n\nTherefore, we can"
