The superfactorial is defined as a tower of factorials, where the topmost factorial is n! itself. So, for 4$, it should be something like 4!^{4!^{...}} with four factorials stacked. My goal is to figure out the units digit of this number.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the units digit means. It's the last digit of a number. So, if I can determine the last digit of each factorial in the tower, maybe I can find a pattern or a cycle that repeats, which can help me figure out the units digit without having to compute the entire huge number.\n\nLet me start by understanding how the units digits of factorials behave. I remember that starting from 5!, the units digit is always 0 because factorials include multiplication by 10 (which is 2*5), so the units digit becomes 0 and stays 0 for all higher factorials. So, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, and so on all end with a 0.\n\nWait, so if we have a superfactorial, starting from 5! upwards, each subsequent factorial is 0. But in the case of 4$, the tower is 4!^{4!^{...}} with four levels. Let me break it down:\n\n4$ = 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}\n\nWait, actually, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me clarify. The superfactorial is a tower where the number of levels equals the base number. So, for n, it's n!^{n!^{...}} with n levels. So, for n=4, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}} with four levels. Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, actually, no. The superfactorial is defined as n\\$ = n!^{n!^{...}} with n factorials. So, 4\\$ is 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}} with four 4!s. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I should check the definition again.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, n\\$ is underbraced as n! raised to the"

What is the units digit of 4\\$?\"\n\nAh, the underbrace says \"n!\" so that means the tower has n! factors? Or is the number of levels n!? So the base is n!, and then the next exponent is n! again, and so on, with the total number of exponents being n!? Hmm. So for example, if n=1, then 1\\$ would be 1! (since the number of exponents is 1!), which is just 1!.\n\nWait, perhaps the tower has n! copies of n! stacked as exponents. So the definition is a tetrational function where the number of iterations is n!.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me see for n=4.\n\nGiven n=4, then n! is 24, so the superfactorial n\\$ would be a tower of 24 copies of 4!.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because then the tower would be astronomically large, but maybe the problem is designed so that the units digit can be found through patterns. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition.\n\nWait, the problem states: n\\$ = underbrace of n! raised as a tower of n! terms? Hmm, the underbrace is written as \"underbrace{ n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}} }} }_{n!}\", so the brace underneath is labeled with n! meaning that there are n! terms in the tower. Therefore, for n=4, the superfactorial is a tower of 4! = 24 copies of 4! (24 copies of 24 as exponents? Wait, no, the base is 4! and each exponent is another 4!.\n\nWait, actually, the tower would start at the top with a single 4!, then below that another 4!, and so on"

To find the units digit of such a tower, we can use Euler's theorem or look for patterns in the units digit cycles.\n\nFirst, note that the units digit of a tower a^b^c^... depends on the units digit of a and the exponent modulo the totient of 10, but since we're dealing with units digit, perhaps we can use modulo 10.\n\nBut since the base here is 24, which has a units digit of 4 (since 24 mod 10 is 4). Wait, 24 mod 10 is 4, so actually, the base of the tower is 24, but when considering the units digit, we can consider the base modulo 10. So the units digit of the entire tower will be the same as the units digit of (24 mod 10)^{ (the rest of the tower) } mod 10. Since 24 mod 10 is 4, so the problem reduces to finding the units digit of 4^{ (the rest of the tower) } mod 10.\n\nTherefore, the key is to compute the exponent (the rest of the tower) modulo \u03c6(10), where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. Since 10 factors into 2 and 5, \u03c6(10)=\u03c6(2*5)=\u03c6(2)*\u03c6(5)=1*4=4. So Euler's theorem tells us that for a and 10 coprime, a^\u03c6(10) \u2261 1 mod 10. However, 4 and 10 are not coprime (they share a factor of 2), so Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Hmm, so maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look at the pattern of the units digit of powers of 4:\n\n4^1 = 4 \u2192 units digit 4\n\n4^2 = 16 \u2192 6\n\n4^3 = 64 \u2192 4\n\n4^4 = 256 \u2192 6\n\nSo the cycle here is 4,6,4,6"

Wait, because we have 24 levels, so when considering 4^x, x is the tower above it, which is another 24^{...} tower with 23 levels.\n\nWait, so for 4^{24^{24^{...}}}, the exponent is 24^{24^{...}} with 23 levels. Therefore, the exponent is 24^{something}, and we need to determine if that exponent is even or odd to find whether the overall exponent (of 4) is even or odd.\n\nSince 24 is even, any power of 24 is even. Because 24 is 4*6, both even, and any power of even number is even. Therefore, 24^{anything} is even, because even times even is even, and so on.\n\nThus, the exponent in 4^{24^{...}} is even because 24^{...} is even, as 24 is even and any exponent of even is even.\n\nWait, but the cycle is period 2, so the units digit of 4^even is 6, and 4^odd is 4.\n\nSince the exponent is even, the units digit of 4^{even} is 6.\n\nWait, so does that mean the units digit of 4\\$ is 6?

Since 24 is even, any tower of exponents with 24s will be even. So, the exponent is even, so 4^even has units digit 6. Therefore, the answer is 6?\n\nWait, but let me think again.

Let me denote the exponent as E = 24^{24^{...}} (23 levels). Since 24 is even, and any exponentiation of an even number is even, so E is even. Therefore, the exponent is even, so 4^E mod 10 is 6. So the units digit is 6.\n\nBut let me test this with a smaller example. Let's take n=3, which we had earlier. For n=3, the superfactorial is 6^{6^6}. Let's see if the same logic applies here.\n\nThe base is 6, so units digit is 6. The exponent is 6^6. Since 6^anything is 6 mod 10. So the exponent is 6 mod something? Wait, but 6^6 is 46656, so exponent is 46656. Then 6^46656 mod 10. Since 6 to any power is 6 mod 10, so the units digit is 6. Which matches our previous result.
