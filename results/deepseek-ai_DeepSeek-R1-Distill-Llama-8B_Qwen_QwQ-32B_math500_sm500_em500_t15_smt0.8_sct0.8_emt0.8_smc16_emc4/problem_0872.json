            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to combine these square roots and their reciprocals into a single fraction. The expression given is \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. The goal is to write this in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I have to find a + b + c.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by looking at each pair of terms separately. That is, let's handle \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 first and then do the same with \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. Maybe if I can simplify each pair, I can then combine them into the desired form.\n\nSo, starting with \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2. I know that having a square root in the denominator is often not preferred, so maybe I should rationalize the denominator. Rationalizing the denominator typically involves multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same term to eliminate the square root from the denominator.\n\nSo, for 1/\u221a2, if I multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a2, it becomes (\u221a2)/2. So, 1/\u221a2 equals \u221a2/2. Therefore, \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 is the same as \u221a2 + \u221a2/2.\n\nWait, let me write that out: \u221a2 is the same as 2\u221a2/2, right? So, adding that to \u221a2/2 gives (2\u221a2 + \u221a2)/2, which simplifies to 3\u221a2/2. Okay, so \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 simplifies to 3\u221a2/2.\n\nSimilarly, let's work on \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. Using the same approach, 1/\u221a3 is equal to \u221a3/3 after rationalizing. So, \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 becomes \u221a3 + \u221a3/3. Now, \u221a3 is 3\u221a3/3, so adding that to \u221a3/3 gives (3\u221a3 + \u221a3)/3, which is 4\u221a3/3.\n\nSo now, the original expression simplifies to 3\u221a2/2 + 4\u221a3/3.\n\nNow, I need to combine these two fractions into a single one. To do that, I"

            "output": " need a common denominator. The denominators here are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator (LCD) would be 6, right? So, I can rewrite both fractions with 6 as the denominator.\n\nFor 3\u221a2/2, multiplying numerator and denominator by 3 gives (9\u221a2)/6. And for 4\u221a3/3, multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 gives (8\u221a3)/6. So, adding these together, I have (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nWait, but the problem asks to write it in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c. So, comparing that, I have a = 9, b = 8, and c = 6.\n\nBut hold on, is c really 6? Let me check if 6 is indeed the smallest possible denominator. Since 2 and 3 are primes, their least common multiple is 6. So, 6 is the smallest possible common denominator. Therefore, the fraction can't be simplified further with a smaller c.\n\nTherefore, a = 9, b = 8, c = 6. So, a + b + c would be 9 + 8 + 6, which is 23.\n\nWait, let me go through that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2: \u221a2 is approximately 1.414, and 1/\u221a2 is about 0.707. Adding them together gives roughly 2.121. After simplifying, I got 3\u221a2/2, which is 3*1.414/2 \u2248 2.121. That seems right.\n\nFor \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3: \u221a3 is about 1.732, and 1/\u221a3 is about 0.577. Adding them gives around 2.309. Simplifying gives 4\u221a3/3, which is 4*1.732/3 \u2248 2.309. So that also checks out.\n\nAdding 3\u221a2/2 and 4\u221a3/3: 3\u221a2/2 is approximately 3*1.414/2 \u2248 2.121. 4\u221a3/3 is about 4*1.732/3 \u2248 2.309. Adding those together gives roughly 4.43.

That matches, so the arithmetic seems correct.\n\nSo, the combined fraction is indeed (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6, and since 6 is the smallest possible denominator, a, b, c are 9, 8, 6 respectively. Adding those gives 23.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, is there a way to write it with a smaller c? Since 6 is the LCM of 2 and 3, it's not possible to have a smaller common denominator. So, c can't be less than 6. Therefore, 6 is the smallest possible denominator.\n\nI think that's it. So, the final answer should be 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying each pair of terms separately.\n\nFirst, consider \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\):\n- Rationalize \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\): \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n- Combine the terms: \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\nNext, consider \\(\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\):\n- Rationalize \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\): \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n- Combine the terms: \\(\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n\nNow, we combine the simplified terms \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{4\\"
