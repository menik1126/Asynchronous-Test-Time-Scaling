Since each letter must be different, I use the permutation formula for selecting 2 out of 26 without replacement, which is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, for the digits, there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9). Similar to the letters, each digit must also be different. I apply the permutation formula again, which is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nFinally, I multiply the total number of permutations for the letters by the total number for the digits to find the total number of possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many different license plates can be formed under the given conditions.\n\n### Problem:\n**How many license plates can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one-digit (0-9) numbers?**\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure:**\n   - **Letters Part:** 2 different letters.\n   - **Numbers Part:** 2 different digits.\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Possible Letters:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.\n   - Since the two letters must be different, the number of ways to choose the first letter is **26**.\n   - For the second letter, there are only **25** remaining letters.\n   - **Total permutations for letters:**  \n     \\( 26 \\times 25 = 650 \\)\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Possible Digits:**\n   - There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9).\n   - The two digits must also be different.\n   - For the first digit, there are **10** choices.\n   - For the second digit, there are **9** remaining choices.\n   - **Total permutations for digits:**  \n     \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\)\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Number of License Plates:**\n   - For each unique pair of letters, there are 90 possible pairs of digits.\n   - **Total license plates:**  \n     \\( 650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500 \\)\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{58500}"
