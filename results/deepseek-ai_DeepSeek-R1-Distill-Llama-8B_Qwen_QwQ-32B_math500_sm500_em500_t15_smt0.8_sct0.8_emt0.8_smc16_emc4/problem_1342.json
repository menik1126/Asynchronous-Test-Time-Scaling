That means after finding all the roots, I need to add them up. But before that, I need to solve this equation. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, looking at the equation, it's a rational equation with four terms on the left side, each of which has a quadratic denominator. On the right side, it's a linear term in x. So, the left side is a sum of four rational functions, and the right is linear. Maybe I can find a common denominator for the left side and combine the terms?\n\nBut combining all four fractions might get complicated because each denominator is different. Let me write down the denominators:\n\n- \\(x^2 - 1\\)\n- \\(x^2 - 2\\)\n- \\(x^2 - 3\\)\n- \\(x^2 - 4\\)\n\nHmm, each denominator is a quadratic, so they can be factored as:\n\n1. \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\)\n2. \\(x^2 - 2 = (x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})\\)\n3. \\(x^2 - 3 = (x - \\sqrt{3})(x + \\sqrt{3})\\)\n4. \\(x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\\)\n\nSo, the denominators are products of linear factors. That might be useful later.\n\nBut maybe instead of trying to combine the fractions, I can make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let me set \\(y = x^2\\). Then each term becomes:\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{y - 1}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{2}{y - 2}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{3}{y - 3}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{4}{y - 4}\\)\n\nSo the left side of the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1"

That might complicate things. Maybe I can express the right side in terms of y as well, but since y is \\(x^2\\), we have y = x^2, so x = sqrt(y) or x = -sqrt(y), but that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can cross-multiply to eliminate denominators? But since there are four denominators, that might get messy. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice a pattern in the coefficients. Let me list the terms on the left:\n\n1/(y - 1) + 2/(y - 2) + 3/(y - 3) + 4/(y - 4)\n\nHmm, the numerators are 1, 2, 3, 4 and the denominators are y - 1, y - 2, y - 3, y - 4. So, it's like (k)/(y - k) where k is from 1 to 4.\n\nMaybe there's a way to write this as a sum. Wait, maybe each term is of the form k/(y - k). Maybe each term can be rewritten as derivative or integral or something? Or perhaps partial fractions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe express each term as k/(y - k) = -k/(k - y) = -k/( -(y - k)) = -k/(k - y) = -k/( -(y - k)) = not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as k times 1/(y - k). So, sum_{k=1}^4 k/(y - k).\n\nMaybe we can combine the terms over a common denominator. That might be a way.\n\nLet me try to compute the sum.\n\nThe common denominator would be the product of all denominators: (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4). So, let's write each term with this common denominator.\n\nSo, for each term:\n\n1/(y - "

Let me denote t as x again.\n\nLet me consider the left-hand side (LHS) as a function of x, and the right-hand side (RHS) as a linear function. The equation is LHS(x) = RHS(x). To find all complex solutions, perhaps we can consider the equation as a polynomial equation by multiplying both sides by the denominators, but that would lead to a high-degree polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be manipulated to a polynomial equation. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me denote D(x) = (x\u00b2 -1)(x\u00b2 -2)(x\u00b2 -3)(x\u00b2 -4). Then, multiplying both sides by D(x):\n\nSum_{k=1}^4 [k * D(x)/(x\u00b2 -k)] = (2010x -4) * D(x)\n\nBut D(x)/(x\u00b2 -k) is equal to (x\u00b2 -1)...(x\u00b2 - (k-1))(x\u00b2 - (k+1))...(x\u00b2 -4).

Maybe, but since the equation is 2010x -4 on the right, so as x becomes large, the left side behaves like sum of terms which are O(1/x\u00b2), so tends to 0. So, as x\u2192\u221e, left side tends to 0, right side tends to infinity. So, at some large x, the right side will dominate, so the equation will have solutions for x positive and maybe x negative as well? Wait, but RHS is 2010x -4.

So, since the left side for large negative x would also approach 0, but perhaps crossing the RHS.\n\nBut since this is a complex equation, maybe we should consider more about the complex roots.\n\nWait, but since we're dealing with complex solutions, and the equation is a rational equation, perhaps it can be manipulated into a polynomial equation.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, cross-multiplying everything, but given the number of terms, it's going to get quite involved.\n\nLet me denote the entire left-hand side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(x^2 -1)} + \\frac{2}{(x^2 -2)} + \\frac{3}{(x^2 -3)} + \\frac{4}{(x^2 -4)} = 2010x -4\n\\]\n\nLet me write this equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 -1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 -2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 -3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 -4} -2010x +4=0\n\\]\n\nNow, let me find a common denominator for all terms."

The problem is to find the sum of all complex solutions, so the answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me think again: the problem might interpret \"complex solutions\" as non-real complex solutions, but in complex analysis, complex solutions include real solutions. So, x=0 is a real solution, and the rest are either real or non-real complex. But the question says \"sum of all complex solutions\", so yes, all roots. Therefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think once more.\n\nIf we have a polynomial equation, all its roots are complex (in the complex plane), so the sum of all complex solutions is the sum of all roots, which is given by Vieta's"
