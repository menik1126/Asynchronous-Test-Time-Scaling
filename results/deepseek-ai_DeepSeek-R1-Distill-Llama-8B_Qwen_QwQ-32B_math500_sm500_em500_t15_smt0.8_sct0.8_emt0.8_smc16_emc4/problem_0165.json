Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst off, I remember that cube roots can be tricky, but they're kind of the inverse operation of cubing something. So, if there's a cube root on one side of the equation, maybe I can get rid of it by cubing both sides. That makes sense because cubing a cube root should give me back the original number inside.\n\nSo the equation is \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\). To get rid of the cube root, I'll cube both sides. Let me write that down:\n\n\\( (\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3 \\).\n\nOn the left side, the cube and the cube root cancel each other out, so I'm left with \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 \\). On the right side, 16 cubed. I should calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16... Let me do that step by step. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \\).\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for \\( x \\). Let me rearrange it so that one side equals zero because that's how quadratics are usually solved. Subtract 4096 from both sides:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0 \\).\n\nSimplifying that, \\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\). Hmm, that's a bit of a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 16 cubed is 4096? Wait, 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16: 256 times 10 is 2560, plus 256 times 6 is 1536, so 2560 + 1536 is indeed "

            "output": "4096. So that part is correct.\n\nSo now I have \\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\). I can try to factor this, but the numbers are pretty large, so factoring might be tough. Let me see if 4092 can be factored nicely. Wait, 4092 divided by 4 is 1023, which doesn't seem like a perfect square. Maybe I should use the quadratic formula instead because it's straightforward for any quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic formula is \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). For our equation, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -4092 \\). Plugging these into the formula:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092)}}{2(1)} \\).\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2} \\).\n\nWait, let me calculate the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). So, \\( (-4)^2 \\) is 16, and \\( 4ac \\) is 4 times 1 times (-4092), which is -16368. But since it's minus that, it becomes +16368. So, the discriminant is 16 + 16368. Let me add those together: 16 + 16368 is 16384.\n\nSo now, the formula becomes:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16384}}{2} \\).\n\nHmm, what's the square root of 16384? I should figure that out because it's a big number. Let me try to find a perfect square that equals 16384. I remember that 128 squared is 16384 because \\( 128 \\times 128 \\) is 16384. Let me double-check that:\n\n\\( 128 \\times 100 = 12800 \\),\n\\( 128 \\times 28 = 3584 \\),\nso 12800 + 3584 = 16384. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the square root of 16384 is 128. Now, plugging back into the equation:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{4 \\"

Therefore, the positive solution is 66.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the beginning: the cube root equals 16, so cube both sides to get 4096. Then, the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \\) becomes \\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\). Using the quadratic formula, I found the discriminant to be 16384, whose square root is 128. Then, the solutions were 66 and -62, so 66 is the positive one. That seems correct.\n\nJust to double-check, let me plug \\( x = 66 \\) back into the original equation:\n\nCalculate \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 \\):\n\n\\( 66^2 = 4356 \\),\n\\( 4x = 264 \\),\nSo, \\( 4356 - 264 + 4 = 4356 - 264 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096 \\).\n\nSo, the cube root of 4096 is indeed 16 because \\( 16^3 = 4096 \\). That checks out. And for \\( x = -62 \\), let me just verify:\n\n\\( (-62)^2 = 3844 \\),\n\\( 4x = -248 \\),\nSo, \\( 3844 - (-248) + 4 = 3844 + 248 + 4 = 4096 \\). That also works, but since the question asks for the positive value, 66 is the answer.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes noticed in the steps, and the verification shows that 66 is indeed a solution.\n</think>\n\nThe equation given is \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\).\n\n1. **Cube both sides** to eliminate the cube root:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt[3]{"
