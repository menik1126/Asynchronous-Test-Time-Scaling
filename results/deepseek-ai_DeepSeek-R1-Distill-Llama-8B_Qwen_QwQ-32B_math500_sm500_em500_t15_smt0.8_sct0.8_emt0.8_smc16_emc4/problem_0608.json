            "output": "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, I start by finding its prime factorization. I know that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. Since 98 is still even, I divide by 2 again to get 49. Now, 49 is a perfect square, so it's divisible by 7. Dividing 49 by 7 gives me 7, and dividing 7 by 7 yields 1. Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n\nNext, I use the formula for finding the number of divisors. If a number has a prime factorization of the form \\( p^a \\times q^b \\times \\ldots \\), the total number of positive divisors is \\( (a+1)(b+1)\\ldots \\). Applying this to 196, the exponents are both 2 for the prime numbers 2 and 7. Adding 1 to each exponent and multiplying them together, I get (2+1) \u00d7 (2+1) = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. So, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - **196** is an even number, so it's divisible by **2**.\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   - **98** is also even, so it's divisible by **2**:\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **49** is a perfect square of **7**:\n     \\[\n     49 = 7^2\n     \\]\n   - Combining these, the prime factorization of **196** is:\n     \\[\n     196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Using the Divisor Formula**:\n   - The formula to calculate the number of positive divisors of a number \\( n = p^a \\times q^b \\times \\ldots \\) is:\n     \\[\n     (a+1)(b+1)\\ldots\n     \\]\n   - For **196**, the exponents"
