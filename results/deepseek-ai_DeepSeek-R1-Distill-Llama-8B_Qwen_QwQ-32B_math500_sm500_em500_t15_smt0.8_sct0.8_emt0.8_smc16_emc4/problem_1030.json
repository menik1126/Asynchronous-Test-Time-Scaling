Then, I have to find the sum of \\(p_i(1)\\) for all these factors \\(p_i(x)\\).\n\nFirst, I remember that when factoring polynomials, especially higher-degree ones, it's helpful to look for patterns or substitutions that can simplify the expression. The given polynomial is an 8th-degree polynomial, which seems quite complex. But I notice that all the exponents are even: \\(x^8\\), \\(x^4\\), and a constant term. That makes me think a substitution might work here.\n\nLet\u2019s try substituting \\(y = x^4\\). Then, the original equation becomes:\n\n\\(y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\\)\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in terms of \\(y\\). I can try to factor this quadratic:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Let me think: 4 and -1. Yes, because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So,\n\n\\(y^2 + 3y - 4 = (y + 4)(y - 1)\\)\n\nSo, substituting back, that would be:\n\n\\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\)\n\nNow, each of these factors can potentially be factored further. Let me check \\(x^4 + 4\\) and \\(x^4 - 1\\) separately.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\). I recognize this as a difference of squares because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\), so:\n\n\\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1)\\)\n\nThen, \\(x^2 - 1\\) can be factored further as a difference of squares again:\n\n\\(x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1)\\)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^"

            "output": "4 - 1) = (x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1)\\)\n\nNow, I need to check if \\(x^4 + 4\\) can be factored further over the integers. I recall that \\(x^4 + 4\\) is a special case called a biquadratic polynomial. There's a formula called the Sophie Germain identity which says that \\(x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2)\\). In our case, y is 1, so:\n\n\\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 1^2)(x^2 - 2x \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 1^2)\\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\)\n\nSo now, the entire factorization becomes:\n\n\\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\)\n\nLet me list all the factors:\n\n1. \\(x - 1\\)\n2. \\(x + 1\\)\n3. \\(x^2 + 1\\)\n4. \\(x^2 + 2x + 2\\)\n5. \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\)\n\nI should confirm that each of these cannot be factored further over the integers. For the linear factors, they\u2019re already irreducible. For the quadratic factors:\n\n- \\(x^2 + 1\\): Discriminant is \\(0^2 - 4*1*1 = -4\\), so no real roots, hence irreducible over integers.\n- \\(x^2 + 2x + 2\\): Discriminant \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), same as above, irreducible.\n- \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\): Discriminant \\("

            "output": "4 - 8 = -4\\), same thing, irreducible.\n\nSo all factors are indeed irreducible over the integers.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum \\(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1)\\), where each \\(p_i(x)\\) is a monic polynomial factor. So I need to evaluate each polynomial at x=1 and sum them up.\n\nLet me compute each one:\n\n1. \\(x - 1\\) evaluated at 1: \\(1 - 1 = 0\\)\n2. \\(x + 1\\) evaluated at 1: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n3. \\(x^2 + 1\\) evaluated at 1: \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\n4. \\(x^2 + 2x + 2\\) evaluated at 1: \\(1 + 2 + 2 = 5\\)\n5. \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) evaluated at 1: \\(1 - 2 + 2 = 1\\)\n\nAdding all these up: 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10.\n\nWait, let me double-check each calculation to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. \\(1 - 1\\) is definitely 0.\n2. \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), correct.\n3. \\(1^2 + 1 = 2\\), yes.\n4. \\(1^2 + 2*1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\\), right.\n5. \\(1^2 - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1\\), that's correct.\n\nSo sum is 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 10.\n\nHmm, but let me think again if there are any factors I missed. The original polynomial was degree 8, and the product of the factors:\n\n- Degree 1: two factors, giving 2 degrees\n- Degree 2: three factors, giving 6 degrees\n- Total: 8 degrees, which matches.\n\nSo all factors accounted for, each irreducible. The sum seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 10.\n</think>\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"
