The committee consists of 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.\n\nFirst, since the table is circular, the arrangement is considered the same if it can be rotated into another. This means that rotating all the seats doesn't create a new arrangement. To account for this, I should fix one person's seat and arrange the others relative to that person.\n\nThere are three political blocks: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent. Each block must stay together as a single unit around the table. Therefore, these blocks can be arranged in a circular permutation as well.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the three political blocks around the table is (3-1)! = 2. This is because in circular permutations, one position can be fixed to eliminate rotations.\n\nWithin each political block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange them. Similarly, for the Republicans, there are 5! ways. The Independent has only 1 way since there's only one person.\n\nSo, the total number of seating arrangements is calculated by multiplying the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the arrangements within each block. That is, 2 * 5! * 5!.\n\nFinally, applying these calculations: 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to find the number of distinct ways to seat the Senate committee around a circular table, given that all members of each party (Democrats, Republicans, and Independent) must sit next to each other. Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.\n\n1. **Fix One Seat to Account for Rotations:**\n   - Since the table is circular, we can fix the position of one person to eliminate rotational symmetry. For simplicity, let's fix the Independent's seat.\n\n2. **Arrange the Political Blocks:**\n   - The committee consists of three distinct groups: Democrats (5), Republicans (5), and Independent (1).\n   - These groups can be arranged around the table. However, because the table is circular and one seat is fixed, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is **(3-1)! = 2**.\n\n3. **Arrange Members Within Each Block:**\n   - **Democrats:** There are"
