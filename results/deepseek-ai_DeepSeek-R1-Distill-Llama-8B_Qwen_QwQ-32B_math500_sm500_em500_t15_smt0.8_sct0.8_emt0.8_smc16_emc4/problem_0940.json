Then, I'll do the same for 5.\n\nFor 2, the multiples are 2, 4, 6, ..., 42. Using the formula for the number of multiples: \u230a42 / 2\u230b + \u230a42 / 4\u230b + \u230a42 / 8\u230b + \u230a42 / 16\u230b + \u230a42 / 32\u230b. Calculating each term:\n\n\u230a42 / 2\u230b = 21\n\u230a42 / 4\u230b = 10\n\u230a42 / 8\u230b = 5\n\u230a42 / 16\u230b = 2\n\u230a42 / 32\u230b = 1\n\nAdding these together, the total number of 2s is 39.\n\nNext, for 5, the multiples are 5, 10, 15, ..., 40. Using the same method:\n\n\u230a42 / 5\u230b = 8\n\u230a42 / 25\u230b = 1\n\nThe total number of 5s is 9.\n\nSince each pair of 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s, which is 9.\n</think>\n\nNow, let's determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Trailing Zeros**\nA trailing zero in a number is created by multiplying 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \\(n!\\) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\(n\\). This, in turn, is the minimum of the number of times 2 appears as a factor and the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\(n\\).\n\n**Step 2: Counting the Number of 2s in \\(42!\\)**\nTo find the number of"
