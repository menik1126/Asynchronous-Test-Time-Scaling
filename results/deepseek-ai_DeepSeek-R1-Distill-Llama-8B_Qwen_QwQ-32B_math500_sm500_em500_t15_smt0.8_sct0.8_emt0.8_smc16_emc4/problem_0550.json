To do this, I'll look at the price he paid for each country in the 70s.\n\nNext, I'll identify the prices for Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain during the 70s. From the chart, Brazil was $12$ cents each, France was $12$ cents each, Peru was $6$ cents each, and Spain was $13$ cents each.\n\nThen, I'll count the total number of 70s stamps Juan has. It appears there is one stamp for each country in that decade, so there are 4 stamps in total.\n\nAfter that, I'll calculate the total cost of all 70s stamps by multiplying the price of each country by the number of stamps and then summing them up. That gives me a total of $12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43$ cents.\n\nFinally, I'll compute the average price by dividing the total cost by the number of 70s stamps. So, the average price is $43$ cents divided by $4$ stamps, which equals $10.75$ cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70's** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices for Each Country in the 70's:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\$12 cents each\n   - **France:** \\$12 cents each\n   - **Peru:** \\$6 cents each\n   - **Spain:** \\$13 cents each\n\n2. **Count the Number of 70's Stamps:**\n   - There are **4** stamps in total (one from each country).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost of 70's Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = (12 + 12 + 6 + 13) \\text{ cents} = 43 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Average Price:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Price} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Number of 70's Stamps}} = \\frac{43}{4} = 10.75 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{10.8}"

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
