            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). The answer should be expressed as √a divided by b, with a and b being positive integers, and a should not be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find the sum a + b. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance from the origin to a point (x, y) is given by the distance formula, which is sqrt(x² + y²). So, if I can express y in terms of x from the given function, I can substitute that into the distance formula and then find the minimum distance.\n\nGiven y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), let me write that as y = (x² - 3)/√2. So, substituting this into the distance formula, the distance D from the origin to a point (x, y) on the graph would be:\n\nD = sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(x² + [(x² - 3)/√2]^2)\n\nLet me simplify that expression step by step. First, square the y-component:\n\n[(x² - 3)/√2]^2 = (x² - 3)² / (2)\n\nSo, plugging that back into D:\n\nD = sqrt(x² + (x² - 3)² / 2)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it further or make it easier to take the derivative for minimization.\n\nLet me write the expression inside the square root as a function, say f(x):\n\nf(x) = x² + (x² - 3)² / 2\n\nTo find the minimum distance, I need to find the minimum of f(x), because the square root function is monotonically increasing. So, the x that minimizes f(x) will also minimize D.\n\nSo, let me expand f(x):\n\nf(x) = x² + (x^4 - 6x² + 9)/2\n\nTo combine terms, let's get a common denominator:\n\n= (2x²)/2 + (x^4 - 6x² + 9)/2\n\n= (2x² + x^4 - 6x² + 9)/2"

Therefore, the minimum distance D is sqrt(2.5). Let me write that as sqrt(5/2) because 2.5 is 5/2.\n\nSo,"

Here, a is 10, which factors into 2 and 5, neither of which is a square greater than 1. So, 10 is square-free.\n\nThus, a = 10, b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Wrote the distance as sqrt(x² + y²) with y expressed in terms of x.\n2. Substituted y into the distance formula and simplified f(x) correctly.\n3. Expanded and simplified f(x) to (x^4 - 4x² + 9)/2.\n4. Took derivative, set to zero, found critical points x=0 and x=±sqrt(2). Correct.\n5. Evaluated f(x) at x=0, got 9/2=4.5.\n6. Evaluated f(x) at x=sqrt(2), got (4 -8 +9)/2 = 5/2=2.5. Correct.\n7. Therefore, D= sqrt(5/2)=sqrt(10)/2. Correct.\n8. Since 10 is square-free, a=10, b=2, so a+b=12. Correct.\n\nI think that's all correct.

After substituting \\( y \\) into the distance formula and simplifying, we find the minimum occurs at \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\), leading to a minimum distance of \\( \\sqrt{10}/2 \\).
