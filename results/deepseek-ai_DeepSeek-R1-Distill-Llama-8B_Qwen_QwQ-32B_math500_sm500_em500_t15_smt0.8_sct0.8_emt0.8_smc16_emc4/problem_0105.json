            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nAnd this should hold true for all real values of x except -8 and 3, because those values would make the denominators zero, right? So, I think the way to approach this is by combining the two fractions on the left side and then equating them to the right side. Then, I can compare the numerators since the denominators must be the same. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find a common denominator for the left side. The denominators are (x - 3) and (x + 8), so the common denominator would be (x - 3)(x + 8). I'll rewrite each fraction with this common denominator.\n\nSo, the first fraction, C/(x - 3), becomes C*(x + 8)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)] and the second fraction, D/(x + 8), becomes D*(x - 3)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]. Adding these together, I get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, this is equal to the right-hand side, which is (4x - 23)/(x^2 + 5x - 24). Hmm, I notice that the denominator on the right side, x^2 + 5x - 24, can be factored. Let me factor that to check if it's the same as (x - 3)(x + 8). \n\nLet me try factoring x^2 + 5x - 24. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to +5. Hmm, 8 and -3 because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. Yes, so x^2 + 5x - 24 factors as (x + 8)(x - 3). That matches the common denominator we found on the left"

            "output": " side, which is good because if the denominators are equal, then the numerators must be equal as well for the equation to hold for all x except where denominators are zero.\n\nSo, the numerators on both sides must be equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, let's expand the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) = Cx + 8C\nD(x - 3) = Dx - 3D\n\nAdding these together, we get:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. The terms with x are Cx and Dx, so we can write:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nAnd this is equal to 4x - 23, so we can set up equations for the coefficients of x and the constant terms separately.\n\nSo, the coefficient of x on the left is (C + D) and on the right is 4. Therefore, we have:\n\nC + D = 4  ...(1)\n\nThen, the constant term on the left is (8C - 3D) and on the right is -23. So, the equation is:\n\n8C - 3D = -23  ...(2)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1) C + D = 4\n2) 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve this system for C and D. Let me see. Maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nFrom equation (1), I can express C as C = 4 - D. Then, substitute this into equation (2):\n\n8*(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet me compute 8*(4 - D):\n\n8*4 = 32 and 8*(-D) = -8D, so 32 - 8D - 3D = -23.\n\nCombine like terms: (32) + (-8D - 3D) = 32 - 11D = -23.\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32 = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5.\n\nSo, D is 5. Now, substitute D back into equation (1):\n\n"

Now, the question is asking for the product CD.\n\nCD = (-1) * 5 = -5.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should plug these values back into the original equation to verify.\n\nSo, if C = -1 and D = 5, then the left side is:\n\n-1/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8). Let's combine these:\n\nFind common denominator (x - 3)(x + 8):\n\n-1*(x + 8) + 5*(x - 3) = (-x -8) + (5x -15) = ( -x +5x ) + (-8 -15) = 4x -23.\n\nSo that gives (4x -23)/[(x - 3)(x +8)] which is same as the right side. So yes, it checks out.\n\nTherefore, the values are correct.
