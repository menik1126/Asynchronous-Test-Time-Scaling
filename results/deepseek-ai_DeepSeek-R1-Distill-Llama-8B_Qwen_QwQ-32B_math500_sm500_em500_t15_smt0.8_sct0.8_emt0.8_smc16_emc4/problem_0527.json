            "output": "To simplify the expression (1 + \u221a2)/(2 + \u221a3), I\u2019ll start by rationalizing the denominator. I need to eliminate the square root from the denominator.\n\nI\u2019ll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (2 - \u221a3). This will help me create a difference of squares, which simplifies the expression.\n\nAfter multiplying, the numerator becomes (1 + \u221a2)(2 - \u221a3). I\u2019ll expand this using the distributive property. First, multiply 1 by 2 to get 2, then 1 by -\u221a3 to get -\u221a3. Next, multiply \u221a2 by 2 to get 2\u221a2, and finally, \u221a2 by -\u221a3 to get -\u221a6. So, the numerator is 2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6.\n\nThe denominator, after rationalization, becomes (2 + \u221a3)(2 - \u221a3). Using the difference of squares, this simplifies to 4 - (\u221a3)^2, which is 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nNow, the simplified expression is (2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6)/1, which simplifies further to 2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6.\n\nTo match the desired form A(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD), I notice that 2 can be represented as 1 + 1 and 2\u221a2 as \u221a8. So, I can rewrite the expression as (1 + 1) + (1 + \u221a8) - (\u221a3 + \u221a6). However, this doesn\u2019t neatly fit the form provided.\n\nRe-evaluating, I realize that the correct grouping should be 2(1 + \u221a2) - (\u221a3 + \u221a6). This matches the required form with A = 2, B = 2, C = 3, and D = 6.\n\nFinally, adding these values together: A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), we aim to rationalize the denominator.
