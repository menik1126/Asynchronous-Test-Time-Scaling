            "output": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here about triangle ABC. The area of the triangle is given as a\u00b2 minus (b - c) squared. So, the area is equal to a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2. And I need to find tan A, where A is one of the angles of the triangle. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling some formulas related to the area of a triangle.\n\nI remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula (1/2)*base*height, but that might not be directly helpful here. Another formula I know is Heron's formula, which uses the lengths of all three sides. But Heron's formula is a bit complicated because it involves square roots and semi-perimeter. Hmm, maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nWait, there's also the formula for the area in terms of two sides and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A, where b and c are two sides, and A is the angle between them. In triangle ABC, sides a, b, c are opposite angles A, B, C respectively. So, if I consider sides b and c, the included angle would be angle A. So, area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. \n\nBut in the problem, the area is given as a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2. Let me write that down:\n\nArea = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2\n\nSo, setting these equal:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2\n\nHmm, okay. Let me expand the right-hand side to see if that can be simplified. So, a\u00b2 minus (b - c) squared is:\n\na\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 - 2b*c + c\u00b2) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2b*c - c\u00b2\n\nSo, the area is equal to a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2b*c. That simplifies to (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2) + 2b*c.\n\nWait a minute, I remember the Law of Cosines, which states that a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b*c*cos A. Let me write that down:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b*c*cos A\n\nSo, if I"

That's a useful expression because we might be able to relate this to the area.\n\nGoing back to the area expression I had:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2\n\nI can substitute a\u00b2 from the Law of Cosines into this equation. Let's do that.\n\nFrom Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b*c*cos A\n\nSo, substituting into the area equation:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b*c*cos A) - (b\u00b2 - 2b*c + c\u00b2)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2 is equal to (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b*c*cos A) - (b\u00b2 - 2b*c + c\u00b2). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2:\n\n= (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b*c*cos A) - (b\u00b2 - 2b*c + c\u00b2)\n\n= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b*c*cos A - b\u00b2 + 2b*c - c\u00b2\n\n= (-2b*c*cos A) + 2b*c\n\nFactor out 2b*c:\n\n= 2b*c*(1 - cos A)\n\nSo, the area equation becomes:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 2b*c*(1 - cos A)\n\nHmm, that looks better. Let me write that down:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 2b*c*(1 - cos A)\n\nI can divide both sides by b*c, assuming b and c are non-zero, which they are because they are sides of a triangle. So:\n\n(1/2)*sin A = 2*(1 - cos A)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\nsin A = 4*(1 - cos A)\n\nSo, sin A = 4 - 4*cos A\n\nHmm, okay, so I have sin A in terms of cos A. Maybe I can use the Pythagorean identity to relate sin and cos. The identity is sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 1.\n\nLet me denote cos"

Let's solve for x.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [32 \u00b1 sqrt(32\u00b2 - 4*17*15)] / (2*17)\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = 32\u00b2 - 4*17*15\n\n32\u00b2 is 1024.\n\n4*17*15 = 4*255 = 1020.\n\nSo, D = 1024 - 1020 = 4.\n\nSo, sqrt(D) = 2.\n\nThus,\n\nx = [32 \u00b1 2]/34\n\nSo, two possibilities:\n\nx = (32 + 2)/34 = 34/34 = 1\n\nx = (32 - 2)/34 = 30/34 = 15/17 \u2248 0.882\n\nWait, but x = cos A.\n\nIf x = 1, then cos A = 1, which implies A = 0 degrees, which is impossible because a triangle can't have a zero-degree angle.\n\nTherefore, x = 15/17 is the valid solution. So, cos A = 15/17.\n\nNow, since we have cos A, we can find sin A using the identity sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 1.\n\nCompute sin A:\n\nsin\u00b2 A = 1 - cos\u00b2 A = 1 - (225/289) = (289 - 225)/289 = 64/289\n\nSo, sin A = 8/17, since sin A is positive because angle A is between 0 and 180 degrees.\n\nWait, earlier I had sin A = 4 - 4x, where x = 15/"

So, sin A is 8/17.\n\nBut we need to compute tan A, which is sin A / cos A.\n\nSo,\n\ntan A = (8/17) / (15/17) = 8/15.\n\nSo, tan A = 8/15.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me just recap all the steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Area of triangle ABC is given as a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2.\n2. Also, area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n3. Set them equal: (1/2)*b*c*sin A = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2\n4. Expand the RHS: a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 - 2b*c + c\u00b2) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2b*c\n5. From Law of Cosines: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b*c*cos A.\n6. Substitute a\u00b2 into RHS: (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2b*c*cos A) - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2b*c = 2b*c*(1 - cos A)\n7. So, area equation becomes: (1/2)*b*c*sin A = 2b*c*(1 - cos A)\n8. Divide both sides by b*c: (1/2) sin A = 2(1 - cos A)\n9. Multiply both sides by 2: sin A = 4(1 - cos A)\n10.

Solve quadratic: x = [32 \u00b1 sqrt(4)] / 34 \u2192 x=1 or x=15/17\n14. x=1 is invalid, so cos A =15/"
