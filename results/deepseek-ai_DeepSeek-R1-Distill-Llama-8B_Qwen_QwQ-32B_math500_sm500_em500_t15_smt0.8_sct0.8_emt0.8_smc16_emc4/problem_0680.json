The total number of cards is 54, and each player gets at least 5 cards. This means that each player receives 5 or more cards, so the minimum number of cards any player can have is 5. \n\nTo find the range of possible values for \\( x \\), I'll use the concept of distributing cards. The number of players \\( x \\) must be such that \\( 5x \\leq 54 \\). Solving for \\( x \\), I divide both sides by 5, which gives \\( x \\leq 10.8 \\). Since \\( x \\) must be an integer and at least 2, the maximum possible value for \\( x \\) is 10.\n\nNext, I'll consider the upper and lower bounds for \\( x \\). The smallest number of players is 2, so \\( x \\) can be as low as 2. Therefore, the possible values for \\( x \\) range from 2 to 10.\n\nFinally, I'll list out all the integers within this range to count the number of possible values. The integers from 2 to 10 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, which totals 9 values.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values for \\( x \\), we'll analyze the constraints and apply mathematical reasoning.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Constraints**\n\n- **Total number of cards (\\( C \\))**: \\( 54 \\)\n- **Minimum number of cards per player (\\( y \\))**: \\( 5 \\)\n- **Number of players (\\( x \\))**: \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**\n\nEach player must receive at least \\( 5 \\) cards. Therefore, the smallest number of cards that can be distributed is \\( 5x \\). Since all cards must be distributed, we have:\n\n\\[\n5x \\leq 54\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\n\\[\nx \\leq \\frac{54}{5} \\approx 10.8\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\"
