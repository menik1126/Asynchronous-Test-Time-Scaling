            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where the area of triangle ABC is given by the formula a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2, and I need to find the tangent of angle A. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using several formulas. The most common ones are the base times height over two, or using Heron's formula, or the formula involving two sides and the sine of the included angle. Since we're dealing with sides a, b, and c, and angle A is opposite side a, I think the formula area = (1/2)bc sin A might be useful here.\n\nThe problem states that the area is a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2. So, let me write that down:\n\nArea = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2\n\nI can expand the (b - c)\u00b2 term:\n\n(b - c)\u00b2 = b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2\n\nSo substituting that into the area equation:\n\nArea = a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2bc - c\u00b2\n\nSimplify that a bit:\n\nArea = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2bc\n\nNow, I know from the area formula involving sine:\n\nArea = (1/2)bc sin A\n\nSo, I can set these equal to each other:\n\n(1/2)bc sin A = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2bc\n\nHmm, that's an equation involving a, b, c, and sin A. My goal is to find tan A, so I need to somehow express sin A and cos A in terms of the sides a, b, c.\n\nI remember the Law of Cosines, which might be helpful here. The Law of Cosines states that:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A\n\nLet me rearrange this to solve for cos A:\n\ncos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc)\n\nSo, cos A is expressed in terms of a, b, c. Similarly, sin A can be found using the identity sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 1.\n\nsin A = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 A) = sqrt(1 - [(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc)]\u00b2)\n\n"

So, let me write that as:\n\ncos A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc)\n\nTherefore, from here, I can solve for a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 = b"

Now, in a triangle, angle A is between 0 and \u03c0 (0 and 180 degrees), so cos A ranges from -1 to 1, but more strictly, between -1 and 1, but for a valid triangle, angle A must be less than 180 degrees, so cos A must be greater than -1.\n\nLooking at x = 1: that would imply angle A is 0 degrees, which isn't possible in a triangle.\n\nx = 15/17 \u2248 0.882, which is valid because 15/17 is less than 1 and greater than -1. So, cos A = 15/17.\n\nTherefore, sin A can be found from the equation sin A = 4(1 - cos A) = 4*(1 - 15/17) = 4*(2/17) = 8/17.\n\nSo, sin A = 8/17, cos A = 15/17.\n\nThus, tan A = sin A / cos A = (8/17) / (15/17) = 8/15.\n\nSo, the value of tan A is 8/15.\n\nWait, wait.

That led to a quadratic equation, which I solved to find cos A = 15/17, and then sin A = 8/17. Therefore, tan A = (8/17)/(15/17) = 8/15.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me cross-verify using another approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the expression for the area:\n\nArea = (1/2)bc sin A, which should also equal a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(1/2)bc sin A = a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2\n\nBut a\u00b2, from the Law of Cosines, is b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A, so let's substitute:\n\n(1/2) bc sin A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A) - (b - c)^2\n\nAs I did earlier, this becomes:\n\n(1/2) bc sin A = 2bc(1 - cos A)\n\nWhich leads to sin A = 4(1 - cos A), same as before.\n\nSo, solving that, I arrive at cos A = 15/17, sin A = 8/17, and tan A = 8/15.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute tan A using the sides of the triangle. Let me think if that approach is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me place triangle ABC such that vertex A is at the origin, side BC is along the x-axis, with point B at (c, 0), and point C at (x, y). Then, the area can be calculated using the base and height.\n\nBut perhaps that complicates things further.\n\nWait, but let's try that approach as a check.\n\nLet me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (c, 0), and point C at (d, e). Then, the side lengths would be:\n\nAB: distance from A to B: sqrt((c - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = c\n\nAC: distance from A to C: sqrt(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2) = b\n\nBC: distance"

Hmm, but maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the area is (1/2)*c*e = (1/2)*c*sqrt(b\u00b2 - d\u00b2). But perhaps this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, since we already have expressions for sin A and cos A, maybe we can just accept that tan A is 8/15.
