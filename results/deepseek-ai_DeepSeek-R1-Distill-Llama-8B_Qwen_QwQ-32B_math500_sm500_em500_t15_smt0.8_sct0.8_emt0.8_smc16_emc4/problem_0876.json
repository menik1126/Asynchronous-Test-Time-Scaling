            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to combine these square roots and their reciprocals into a single fraction. The expression is \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. Hmm, I remember from algebra that combining terms often involves finding a common denominator. But here, the terms are a mix of square roots and their reciprocals, which might complicate things. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should split the expression into two parts: one involving \u221a2 and the other involving \u221a3. That seems logical because they are separate radicals. So, the expression becomes (\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2) + (\u221a3 + 1/\u221a3). Now, I can handle each part separately and then combine the results.\n\nLet's tackle \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 first. To combine these, I need a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and \u221a2, so the common denominator would be \u221a2. That means I can rewrite \u221a2 as (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/\u221a2, which simplifies to 2/\u221a2. So, adding \u221a2 and 1/\u221a2 gives (2/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2) = (2 + 1)/\u221a2 = 3/\u221a2. Hmm, but having a radical in the denominator isn't usually preferred, so maybe I should rationalize the denominator. Multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a2, I get (3\u221a2)/2.\n\nAlright, so the first part simplifies to 3\u221a2/2. Now, moving on to the second part: \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. Using the same approach, I'll find a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and \u221a3, so the common denominator is \u221a3. Rewriting \u221a3 as (\u221a3 * \u221a3)/\u221a3 = 3/\u221a3. Adding that to 1/\u221a3 gives (3 + 1)/\u221a3 = 4/\u221a3. Again, rationalizing the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a3, I get (4\u221a3)/3.\n\nNow, putting both parts together, the original expression simplifies to (3\u221a2)/2 + (4\u221a3)/3. To combine these into a single fraction, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and "

            "output": "3, so the least common denominator (LCD) is 6. I can write each term with denominator 6.\n\nFor the first term, (3\u221a2)/2, I multiply numerator and denominator by 3: (3\u221a2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = (9\u221a2)/6. For the second term, (4\u221a3)/3, I multiply numerator and denominator by 2: (4\u221a3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = (8\u221a3)/6.\n\nNow, adding these two fractions together: (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6. Let me check if this can be simplified further. The numerator has terms with \u221a2 and \u221a3, which are different radicals, so they can't be combined. The denominator is 6, which is already in its simplest form since 2 and 3 are prime numbers and don't share any common factors with the numerator.\n\nTherefore, the expression in the desired form is (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6. Now, the problem asks for a, b, and c where a and b are coefficients of \u221a2 and \u221a3 respectively, and c is the denominator. So, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6.\n\nFinally, adding them together: a + b + c = 9 + 8 + 6. Let me do the math... 9 + 8 is 17, and 17 + 6 is 23. So, the sum is 23.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the common denominators or simplifying. Let me go back through each step.\n\nStarting with \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2: I converted \u221a2 to 2/\u221a2, added 1/\u221a2 to get 3/\u221a2, then rationalized to 3\u221a2/2. That seems right.\n\nFor \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3: Same steps, converted to 3/\u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 = 4/\u221a3, then rationalized to 4\u221a3/3. That also looks correct.\n\nCombining both results: 3\u221a2/2 + 4\u221a3/3. Finding LCD of 6, adjusted fractions accordingly, ended up with (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6. Yes, that all adds up. So"
