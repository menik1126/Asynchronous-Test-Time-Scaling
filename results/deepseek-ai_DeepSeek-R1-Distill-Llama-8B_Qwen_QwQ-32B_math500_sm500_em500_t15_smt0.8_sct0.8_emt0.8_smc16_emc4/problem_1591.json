Hmm, at first glance, it looks a bit intimidating with all these cubes, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes when dealing with equations involving cubes, it can be helpful to see if there's a way to factor them or maybe even recognize a pattern. Also, I recall that there's an identity for the sum of two cubes: a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe that could be useful here, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the equation again: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, I notice that on the right side, 2x - 10 can be factored. Let me see: 2x - 10 = 2(x - 5). Oh, interesting. So the right side is [2(x - 5)]^3, which is 8(x - 5)^3. Maybe I can write both sides with a common term or something.\n\nBut wait, let me write down both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3\n\nRight side: [2(x - 5)]^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\nHmm. Maybe I can expand all the terms and see if something cancels out or simplifies. Although expanding cubics can be messy, let's try.\n\nFirst, expand (x - 3)^3:\n\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\n\nSimilarly, expand (x - 7)^3:\n\n(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\n\nAnd then the right side, 8(x - 5)^3. Let's expand (x - 5)^3 first:\n\n(x - 5)^3 = x^3 - 15x^2 + 75x -"

Maybe I can simplify it by dividing all terms by a common factor. Let's check if there's a common factor for coefficients: 6, 90, 426, 630.\n\nLooking at 6: factors 2,3\n\n90: factors 2,3,3,5\n\n426: 2,3,71\n\n630: 2,3,3,5,7\n\nSo the common factors are 2 and 3, so let's factor out 6:\n\n(-6x^3 +90x^2 -426x +630) = -6(x^3 -15"

Maybe it has rational roots, so I can use the Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are the factors of the constant term (105) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1). So possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.\n\nLet me test x=3: 27 - 135 + 213 -105 = 27 -135 = -108 +213=105 -105=0. Hey, x=3 is a root!\n\nSo (x -3) is a factor. Now, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n3 | 1  -15  71  -105\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 3: 3. Add to -15: -12\n\nMultiply -12 by 3: -36. Add to 71: 35\n\nMultiply 35 by 3: 105. Add to -105: 0\n\nSo the cubic factors into (x -3)(x^2 -12x +35). Now, factor the quadratic:\n\nx^2 -12x +35. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12. Those are -5 and -7.\n\nSo (x -5)(x -7). Therefore, the cubic factors as (x -3)(x -5)(x -7)=0.\n\nThus, the roots are x=3, x=5, x=7.\n\nWait a minute, let me verify if all these roots satisfy the original equation. Sometimes when we cube both sides or manipulate equations, extraneous roots can appear.\n\nLet's check x=3:\n\nLeft side: (3-3)^3 + (3-7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = -64\n\nRight side: (2*3 -10)^3 = (6 -10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64\n\nOkay, equal. So x=3 is good.\n\nx=5:\n\nLeft: (5-3)^3 + (5-7)^3 = 2"

So all three roots are valid.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the original equation. Is there another approach that might have been faster? Because expanding the cubes seems like a lot of work.\n\nAlternatively, I noticed that (x - 3) and (x -7) are involved, and on the right, 2x -10, which is 2(x -5). Maybe there's a substitution that can be made.\n\nLet me set y = x - something. Let me see:\n\nLet me think: if I let y = x - 5, because 2x -10 is 2(y). Maybe that substitution will center the equation around y.\n\nSo let y = x -5. Then x = y +5.\n\nCompute (x -3): (y +5 -3) = y +2\n\nCompute (x -7): (y +5 -7)= y -2\n\nCompute (2x -10): 2(y +5) -10= 2y +10 -10=2y\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(y +2)^3 + (y -2)^3 = (2y)^3\n\nHmm, that seems promising. Let's compute both sides.\n\nLeft side: (y +2)^3 + (y -2)^3\n\nLet me expand both:\n\n(y +2)^3 = y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8\n\n(y -2)^3 = y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8\n\nAdding these two:\n\ny^3 +6y^2 +12y +8 + y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8 = 2y^3 +24y\n\nSo the left side is 2y^3 +24y\n\nRight side: (2y)^3 =8y^3\n\nSet them equal:\n\n2y^3 +24y =8y^3\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n2y^3 +24y -"
