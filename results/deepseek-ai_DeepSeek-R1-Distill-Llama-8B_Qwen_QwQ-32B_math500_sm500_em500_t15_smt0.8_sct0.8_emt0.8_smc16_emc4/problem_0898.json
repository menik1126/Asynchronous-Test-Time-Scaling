For a fraction to have a terminating decimal, the denominator must only have prime factors of 2 and/or 5 after simplifying.\n\nSince the denominator already meets this condition, I can rewrite the fraction by separating the powers of 2 and 5.\n\nI'll express the denominator as \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).
