            "output": "To solve the problem of determining how many ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, I'll start by identifying the total number of boys and girls available. There are 7 boys and 4 girls in the class.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the number of ways to choose the boys. Since the order in which the boys are selected doesn't matter, I'll use the combination formula for selecting 3 boys out of 7. The combination formula is given by:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\nApplying this formula, the number of ways to choose the boys is:\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35\n\\]\n\nNow, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the girls. There are 4 girls, and Mr. Brennan wants to select 2 of them. Using the combination formula again:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of ways to select both boys and girls, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls:\n\n\\[\nTotal \\ Ways = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Brennan has 210 different ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his statistics class, we'll use combinations. The order of selection doesn't matter, so we calculate the combinations separately for boys and girls, then multiply them.\n\n1. **Number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2"
