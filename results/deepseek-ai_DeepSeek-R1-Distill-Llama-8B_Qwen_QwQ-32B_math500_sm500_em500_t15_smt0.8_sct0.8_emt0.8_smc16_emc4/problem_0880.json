            "output": "I need to convert the fraction 57/160 into a terminating decimal. First, I should check the prime factors of the denominator. The number 160 can be factored into 2^5 times 5. Since the denominator only has prime factors of 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n\nNext, I'll adjust the fraction by making the denominator a power of 10. I can do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the same factor that gets rid of the 5 in the denominator. Multiplying by 2 gives the new denominator 10, which is a power of 10.\n\nAfter adjusting the denominator to 10, I'll divide 57 by 160. This means I'll move the decimal point in 57 five places to the left, resulting in 0.355. Finally, since I multiplied both the numerator and the denominator by 2, I'll also divide the result by 2, giving me the final terminating decimal of 0.1778125.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factor the Denominator\nFirst, factor the denominator into its prime factors:\n\\[\n160 = 2^5 \\times 5\n\\]\nSince the prime factors of the denominator are only 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n\n### Step 2: Adjust the Fraction\nMultiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to make the denominator a power of 10:\n\\[\n\\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57 \\times 2}{160 \\times 2} = \\frac{114}{320}\n\\]\nHowever, to make the denominator exactly \\(10^n\\), multiply by 10 instead:\n\\[\n\\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57 \\times 5}{160 \\times 5} = \\frac{285}{800}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Divide Numerator by Denominator\nNow, divide 285 by 800:\n\\[\n\\frac{285}{800} = 0.355\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.1778125}\n\\]"

Let me correct it:\n\n### Correct Step 2:\nTo make the denominator \\(10^5\\) (since the highest exponent in \\(2^5 \\times 5^1\\) is 5), multiply numerator and denominator by \\(5^4\\) (to balance the 5's):\n\\[\n\\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57 \\times 5^4}{2^5 \\times 5^5} = \\frac{57 \\times 625}{10^5}\n\\]\nCalculate \\(57 \\times 625\\):\n\\[\n57 \\times 625 = 35,625\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\n\\frac{35,625}{100,000} = 0.35625\n\\]\n\nWait, this still doesn't match. Let me try direct division:\n\n### Correct Step 3: Long Division\nDivide 57 by 160 using long division:\n- 160 goes into 570 (add decimal point) 3 times (160\u00d73=480), remainder 90.\n- Bring down 0: 900. 160\u00d75=800, remainder 100.\n- Bring down 0: 1000. 160\u00d76=960, remainder 40.\n- Bring down 0: 400. 160\u00d72=320, remainder 80.\n- Bring down 0: 800. 160\u00d75=800, remainder 0.\n\nThe decimal is 0.35625.\n\nWait, but the correct answer is actually 0.35625. However, the user's initial thought had 0.1778125, which is incorrect. Let me verify:\n\nWait, 57 divided by 160:\n\n57 \u00f7 160:\n\n160 \u00d7 0.3 = 48.0\n\n57 - 48 = 9.0\n\nBring down a zero: 90\n\n160 \u00d7 0.05 = 8."
