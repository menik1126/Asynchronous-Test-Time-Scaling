Starting with 2 and 3, since multiplying them gives 6, which is a factor of 84.\n\nAfter using 2 and 3, we have 84 divided by \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\), leaving 14. Dividing 14 by 7 gives 2, which is already used. Therefore, instead, I can use 2, 3, and 14.\n\nCalculating the sum: \\(2 + 3 + 14 = 19\\).\n\nHowever, I can further minimize the sum by using 2, 3, 7, and 2 again, but since the integers need to be distinct, this isn't allowed. Therefore, the next best option is to use 2, 3, 7, and 2. But again, repetition isn't permitted.\n\nHence, the minimum sum is achieved with the integers 2, 3, 7, and 2, totaling 14.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize 84 into its prime factors.\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Distribute the prime factors into distinct integers.\nTo minimize the sum, use the smallest possible integers, starting with 2, 3, and then 7.\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 42 \\quad (\\text{But we need to reach 84})\n\\]\nSince 42 is half of 84, we can include another 2.\n\nHowever, since the integers must be distinct, we cannot repeat 2.\n\n### Step 3: Adjust the factors to ensure all integers are distinct.\nInstead, use 2, 3, 7, and another 2. But since repetition is not allowed, we need to find another way.\n\nThe next best approach is"
