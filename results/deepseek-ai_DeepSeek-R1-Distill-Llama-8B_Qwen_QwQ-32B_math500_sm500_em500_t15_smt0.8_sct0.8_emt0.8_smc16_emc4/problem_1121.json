            "output": "First, I'll convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second to ensure the units are consistent.\n\nThe robot's speed is 1 kilometer per 2.5 hours. To convert kilometers per hour to meters per second, I multiply by the conversion factor 3600 seconds in an hour and divide by 1000 meters in a kilometer.\n\nOnce I have the speed in meters per second, I can use the formula time multiplied by speed to find the length of the hallway in meters.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours at a constant speed.\n- It takes 90 seconds to travel the length of a hallway at the same speed.\n\n**To Find:**\n- The length of the hallway in meters.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Robot's Speed**\n\nFirst, let's find the robot's speed in meters per second (m/s).\n\n1. **Convert 2.5 hours to hours:**\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\text{ hours} = 2.5 \\times 60 = 150 \\text{ minutes}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Convert 150 minutes to seconds:**\n   \\[\n   150 \\text{ minutes} = 150 \\times 60 = 9000 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the speed in meters per second:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ m}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{1}{9} \\text{ m/s}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Length of the Hallway**\n\nNow, use the speed to find the length of the hallway.\n\n1. **Use the formula:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Plug in the known values:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\frac{1}{9} \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ seconds} = 10 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"
