(Equation 1)\n\nFrom the second statement:\nTwo treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\nThis means:\n2t + g = s. (Equation 2)\n\nNow, we can use Equation 2 to substitute in Equation 1. From Equation 2, g = s - 2t. Substituting this into Equation 1:\n10t = 3s + (s - 2t)\n10t = 4s - 2t\n10t + 2t = 4s\n12t = 4s\nDividing both sides by 4:\n3t = s\n\nFrom this, s = 3t. \n\nSo, the weight of one squig is three times the weight of one treek.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n2.
