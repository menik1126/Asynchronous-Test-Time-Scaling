            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, integer roots... that probably means I can use the Rational Root Theorem, right? Let me recall what that is. The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at my equation, the constant term is \\(-14\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(1\\) because the term with \\(x^4\\) has a coefficient of 1. So, possible values for \\(p\\) are the factors of \\(-14\\), which are \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), and \\(\\pm14\\). Since \\(q\\) is a factor of 1, the possible rational roots are just the integer factors of \\(-14\\). So, I can test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation and see if any of them satisfy it.\n\nLet me list out the possible integer roots: \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), \\(\\pm14\\).\n\nI think I'll start by testing \\(x = 1\\). Substituting into the equation:\n\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1+5) + (9-1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0\\).\n\nOh, that works! So, \\(x = 1\\) is a root. Cool, that was straightforward. Now, since \\(x = 1\\) is a root, I can factor out \\((x - 1)\\) from the quartic polynomial. But wait, since this is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, factoring out a linear term will leave us with a cubic polynomial. Hmm, maybe I can use polynomial division for that.\n\nAlternatively, I could factor by grouping, but I'm not sure if that would work here. Let me try synthetic"

Now, I need to factor the cubic polynomial: \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\).\n\nAgain, I can apply the Rational Root Theorem on this cubic. The constant term is 14, leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), \\(\\pm14\\).\n\nLet me test \\(x = -1\\): \\((-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 15(-1) + 14 = -1 + 6 -15 +14 = (-1 +6) + (-15 +14) = 5 -1 = 4\\).

So, \\(x = -2\\) is a root.\n\nGreat, so I can factor out \\((x + 2)\\) from the cubic. Let's do synthetic division again:\n\n-2 | 1  6  15  14\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2, get -2.

Therefore, the original polynomial factors as \\((x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7)\\).\n\nNow, I need to check if the quadratic \\(x^2 +4x +7\\) has any real roots, especially integer roots. The discriminant is \\(b^2 -4ac = 16 -28 = -12\\). Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots, let alone integer roots.\n\nSo, the integer roots of the original equation are \\(x =1\\) and \\(x = -2\\). Wait, before I finish, I should confirm that I didn't miss any other possible integer roots. Let me check the remaining possible candidates.\n\nThe original possible integer roots were \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), \\(\\pm14\\). I already tested 1 and -2.
