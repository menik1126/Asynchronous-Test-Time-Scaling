This simplifies the equation to \\( 3^x = \\frac{72}{8} \\), which is \\( 3^x = 9 \\).\n\nRecognizing that 9 is the same as \\( 3^2 \\), I can rewrite the equation as \\( 3^x = 3^2 \\). Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal as well. Therefore, \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll verify the solution by substituting \\( x = 2 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\), follow these steps:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^3 \\cdot 3^x &= 72 \\\\\n8 \\cdot 3^x &= 72 \\\\\n3^x &= \\frac{72}{8} \\\\\n3^x &= 9 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 9 = 3^2 \\), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n3^x = 3^2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the exponents must be equal:\n\n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
