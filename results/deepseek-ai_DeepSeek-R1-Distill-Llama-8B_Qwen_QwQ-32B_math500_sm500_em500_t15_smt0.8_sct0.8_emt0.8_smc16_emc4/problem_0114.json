Counting each digit, I see there are 11 digits.\n\nSince each byte in binary represents 8 bits, I can group the binary digits into sets of 8 starting from the right. \n\nLet me write out the binary number and separate it into groups of 8:\n\n101010 01110\n\nThis gives me two groups: the leftmost group is 101010, and the rightmost group is 01110.\n\nNext, I need to convert each binary group to its decimal equivalent. \n\nStarting with the rightmost group 01110:\n0 * 2^7 + 1 * 2^6 + 1 * 2^5 + 1 * 2^4 + 0 * 2^3 = 0 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 0 = 112\n\nThen, for the leftmost group 101010:\n1 * 2^7 + 0 * 2^6 + 1 * 2^5 + 0 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 = 128 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 168\n\nFinally, I will add the decimal values of both groups together to get the final base eight number:\n168 + 112 = 280\n\nSo, the binary number 10101001110 in base eight is equal to 280.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Binary to Octal Conversion:**\n   - Each byte (8 bits) in binary can be converted directly to an octal number.\n\n2. **Group Binary Digits into Bytes:**\n   - Since \\(10101001110_2\\) has 11 bits, split into two groups:\n     ```\n     101010  01110\n     ```\n   - The leftmost group has 8 bits, and the rightmost group has 3 bits. To make it 8 bits, add a leading zero:\n     ```\n     001010  01110\n     ```\n\n3. **Convert Each Binary Group to Decimal:**\n   - **First Group (001010):**\n     \\[\n     0 \\"
