Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the left side has four terms, each of which is a fraction with a linear coefficient in the numerator and a quadratic term in the denominator. The right side is a linear function of x. So it's a rational equation, and I might need to find x such that this equation holds.\n\nBut solving it directly seems complicated because the denominators are different. Maybe I need to find a substitution or manipulate the equation somehow. Let me think about partial fractions or some substitution.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe if I let y = x^2, the equation could simplify a bit. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet y = x². Then each denominator becomes y - 1, y - 2, y - 3, y - 4. So the left side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems a bit cleaner. So the equation is now:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nBut now, the right side is still in terms of x. Since y = x², is there a way to express x in terms of y? Well, x = ±√y, but that might complicate things. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me see if I can express the left side as a single fraction. To do that, I'll need a common denominator, which would be (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4). That's going to be messy, but let's try.\n\nThe left side is"

For 1/(y - 1), multiply numerator and denominator by (y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4). So numerator becomes (y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4).\n2. For 2/(y - 2), multiply by (y - 1)(y - 3)(y - 4). Numerator becomes 2(y - 1)(y - 3)(y - 4).\n3. For 3/(y - 3), multiply by (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 4). Numerator becomes 3(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 4).\n4. For 4/(y - 4), multiply by (y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3). Numerator becomes 4(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3).\n\nAdding all these up, the numerator will be:\n\n(y - 2)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 2(y - 1)(y - 3)(y - 4) + 3(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 4) + 4(y - 1)(y - 2)(y - 3).\n\nThat seems really complicated, but perhaps I can expand each term and then combine like terms.\n\nWait, this might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps instead of substituting y = x², we can think about the equation differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying to eliminate denominators. Let me try that.\n\nBut cross-multiplying would be complicated because the left side has four different denominators. Maybe it's better to consider bringing everything to one side and trying to find roots. So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4}"

Perhaps I can rewrite each term as fractions in terms of (x² - k) as denominators.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe if I let z = x - 1/x or something like that, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can note that each term on the left is similar, with coefficients 1,2,3,4 and denominators 1,2,3,4 subtracted. That looks like a series, but with denominators shifted by 1.\n\nWait, perhaps let me think about expanding the left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the function f(x) = left side - right side and see if it's a function that can be factored or has known roots.\n\nBut the right side is 2010x -4, which is linear, and the left side is a sum of four rational functions. Maybe the difference is a function with certain roots.\n\nWait, another thought: the left side can be thought of as a sum of terms of the form k/(x² - k). So k=1,2,3,4. Let me write that as:\n\nSum_{k=1 to 4} [k / (x² - k)] = 2010x -4.\n\nSo maybe I can write this as:\n\nSum_{k=1 to 4} [k / (x² - k)] = 2010x -4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I make substitution t = x + 1/x or something, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps observe that if x is a solution, then 1/x is also a solution? Wait, maybe not necessarily, because the equation isn't symmetric. Let's test x=1: denominator becomes 0, which is not allowed, so x=1,2,3,4 are not in the domain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that x cannot be ±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2, because that would make denominators zero.\n\nWait, maybe to consider that the equation can be transformed into a polynomial equation, because the left side is a rational function, and the right side is a linear function.\n\nSo if I set the entire left side equal to the right side, which is linear, and then bring all terms to one side, I get a rational function equal to zero.

So in the polynomial S(x), the coefficient of x^9 is 2010, right? Wait, but in the equation S(x)=0, it's [Sum] - (2010x -4) P(x)=0, so it's [Sum] -2010x P(x) +4 P(x)=0. Therefore, the leading term is from Sum: which is 10x^6, and from -2010x P(x): which is -2010x*(x^8) = -2010x^9, and from +4 P(x): 4x^8.\n\nSo the highest degree is 9 from -2010x^9, then 8 from 4x^8, then 6 from Sum.\n\nTherefore, S(x) is a degree 9 polynomial with leading term -2010x^9, and next term 4x^8.

Vieta's formula says that for a polynomial of degree n, the sum of roots is - (a_{n-1}/a_n). Here, the polynomial is degree 9, so the sum of roots is - (coefficient of x^8)/ (coefficient of x^9). So that would be -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nHowever, this is the sum of all roots of S(x)=0, which includes the roots of the original equation and possibly other roots introduced when multiplying by P(x). Wait, but actually, when we multiplied both sides by P(x), we might have introduced extraneous roots where P(x)=0, but those are excluded from the original equation's domain. Therefore, the roots of S(x)=0 are exactly the roots of the original equation plus the roots where P(x)=0 (which are excluded). Therefore, the roots of the original equation are exactly the roots of S(x)=0 except for the roots of P(x)=0. Therefore, the sum of the roots of the original equation is equal to the sum of the roots of S(x)=0 minus the sum of the roots of P(x)=0.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute:\n\nSum_{original} = Sum_{S(x)=0} - Sum_{P(x)=0}.\n\nFirst, compute Sum_{S(x)=0} = 2/1005 (as above).\n\nWait, actually, let me recast:\n\nWait, the polynomial S(x) is of degree 9, so the sum of its roots is - (coefficient of x^8)/(coefficient of x^9) = -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nThe polynomial P(x) is (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4).

Because S(x) has all roots of the original equation plus the roots where P(x)=0 (which are excluded). But the roots of P(x)=0 are where x²=1,2,3,4, so x=±1,±√2,±√3,±2. So, the original equation has all roots of S(x)=0 except for x=±1,±√2,±√3,±2.\n\nBut when you consider S(x)=0, the roots include both the roots of Q(x)=0 and the roots of P(x)=0 (which are the excluded roots). Therefore, the sum of the roots of S(x)=0 is equal to sum of roots of Q(x)=0 plus sum of roots of P(x)=0 (since all roots of S(x)=0 are either roots of Q(x)=0 or roots of P(x)=0). Therefore, Sum_{S(x)=0} = Sum_{Q(x)=0} + Sum_{P(x)=0}.\n\nTherefore, Sum_{Q(x)=0} = Sum_{S(x)=0} - Sum_{P(x)=0} = (2/1005) - 0 = 2/1005.\n\nThus, the sum of all complex solutions of the original equation is 2/1005.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.

So when we take Sum_{S(x)=0} = 2/1005, which includes all roots, but we need to exclude the roots where P(x)=0.

So 2/1005 is reduced.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because this seems a bit counterintuitive.\n\nFirst, the key steps:\n\n1. The original equation is equivalent to Q(x)=0, where Q(x) is the left side minus the right side.\n\n2. To clear denominators, multiply both sides by P(x) = (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4), leading to S(x)=0, where S(x) is the polynomial of degree 9.\n\n3.

The sum of roots of P(x)=0 is 0.\n\n6. Therefore, the sum of roots of Q(x)=0 is 2/1005 - 0 = 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2/1005. But let me check with an example.\n\nWait, let me test x=0, which is a solution. The sum should include x=0 and other roots. Let me see if 0 is part of the sum.\n\nSuppose there are other roots. Let me see, but since the problem says \"complex solutions\", so all roots except the excluded ones. Since the sum of all roots of S(x)=0 is 2/1005, and the excluded roots sum to zero, then the remaining roots (the solutions) must also sum to 2/1005.

So yes, the coefficient of x^9 is -2010, and x^8 is 4.\n\nThus, Sum_{roots of S(x)} = - (4)/(-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nAnd since the roots of P(x)=0 sum to zero, the sum of roots of the original equation is 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut wait, let me think about another point.

So, Sum_{S(x)=0} = Sum_{Q(x)=0} + Sum_{P(x)=0} = Sum_{Q(x)=0} + 0 = Sum_{Q(x)=0}.\n\nBut that contradicts the previous statement. Wait, no.

But S(x) has roots that are roots of Q(x)=0 and roots of P(x)=0. Therefore, Sum_{S(x)=0} = Sum_{Q(x)=0} + Sum_{P(x)=0}.

Plugging x=0 into original equation:\n\nLeft side:1/(0 -1) + 2/(0 -2) +"
