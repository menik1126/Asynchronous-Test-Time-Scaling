            "output": "First, I need to simplify the given equation step by step. The problem is (3)5² - 4(5 - a)² ÷ 3 = 63. I notice that the parentheses around the 3 are unusual, so I'll assume it's a multiplication by 3.\n\nNext, I'll rewrite the equation as 3 × 5² - 4(5 - a)² / 3 = 63 to make it clearer. Calculating 5 squared gives me 25, so the equation becomes 3 × 25 - 4(5 - a)² / 3 = 63.\n\nThen, I'll simplify each term. 3 × 25 is 75, and so the equation now is 75 - [4(5 - a)² / 3] = 63.\n\nTo isolate the term with the variable, I'll subtract 75 from both sides, resulting in -[4(5 - a)² / 3] = 63 - 75, which simplifies to -[4(5 - a)² / 3] = -12.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply both sides by -3 to eliminate the fraction and negative sign, which gives me 4(5 - a)² = 36. Dividing both sides by 4, I find that (5 - a)² = 9. Taking the square root of both sides, I get 5 - a = ±3. Solving for 'a' in each case, I find that a = 5 ± 3. Therefore, the possible values of 'a' are 8 and 2. Adding these together, the sum of the values of 'a' is 10.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( 3 \\cdot 5^2 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify \\( 5^2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   5^2 = 25\n   \\]\n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot 25 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply 3 by 25:**\n   \\[\n   75 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n   \\"
