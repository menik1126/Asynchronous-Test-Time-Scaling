There are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. The key constraint is that all members of each party must sit next to each other.\n\nSince the table is circular, the arrangement is considered the same if it can be rotated into another. This means that fixing one person's position can help eliminate equivalent rotations.\n\nI'll start by fixing the Independent's seat. This anchors the rotation, ensuring that different arrangements aren't duplicates due to rotation.\n\nNext, I need to arrange the Democrats among themselves. There are 5 Democrats, so they can be arranged in 5! ways.\n\nSimilarly, the 5 Republicans must be seated together. After placing the Democrats, there are 5 seats between them for the Republicans. Since the Republicans must all sit together, they can be arranged in 5! ways as well.\n\nFinally, the independent is already fixed, so there's only 1 way to place them.\n\nMultiplying these possibilities together gives the total number of distinct seating arrangements: 5! (Democrats) multiplied by 5! (Republicans) multiplied by 1 (Independent).\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of ways the committee can be seated around the circular table with the given conditions.\n\n1. **Fix the Independent's Position**:\n   - Since the table is circular, we can fix the position of the Independent to eliminate rotational duplicates. This leaves us with 10 seats for the remaining 10 members.\n\n2. **Arrange the Democrats**:\n   - The 5 Democrats must sit together. Treat the Democrats as a single block or \"super member.\"\n   - The number of ways to arrange the Democrats within their block is \\( 5! \\) (5 factorial).\n\n3. **Arrange the Republicans**:\n   - Similarly, the 5 Republicans must sit together. After placing the Democrats, there are 5 remaining seats for the Republicans.\n   - The number of ways to arrange the Republicans within their block is \\( 5! \\) (5 factorial).\n\n4. **Total Arrangements**:\n   - Multiply the number of ways to arrange the Democrats and Republicans:\n   \\[\n   5! \\times 5!\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   5! = 120 \\quad \\text{(for Democrats)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5! ="
