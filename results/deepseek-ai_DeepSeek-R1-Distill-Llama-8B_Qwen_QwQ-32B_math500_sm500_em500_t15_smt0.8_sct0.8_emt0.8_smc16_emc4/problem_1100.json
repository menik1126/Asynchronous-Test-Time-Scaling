Let's parse the problem first.\n\nThe function f is defined on the domain {0,1,2,...} \u00d7 {0,1,2,3,4}, and it maps to {0,1,2,3,4}. The definition is recursive, which might be a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the base case: when i = 0, f(0, j) is just mod5(j + 1). So for i=0, and j between 0 and 4, we add 1 to j and take the modulus 5. That means:\n\n- f(0,0) = mod5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0,1) = mod5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0,2) = mod5(2 + 1) = 3\n- f(0,3) = mod5(3 + 1) = 4\n- f(0,4) = mod5(4 + 1) = 0\n\nGot that. So for i=0, the function cycles through 1,2,3,4,0 as j increases from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, the next case: if i \u2265 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1). So this is a recursive step where to find f at (i, 0), we need to compute f at (i - 1, 1). That might lead us into a chain of recursion.\n\nThe third case is when i \u2265 1 and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 4. Then, f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). That's a bit more complicated because the second argument is itself a recursive function call.\n\nSo, to compute f(2015, 2), we need to understand how f(i, j) behaves as i increases. Maybe we can find a pattern or a cycle.\n\nLet me try computing some small values to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with i=0:\n\n- f(0,0) = 1"
