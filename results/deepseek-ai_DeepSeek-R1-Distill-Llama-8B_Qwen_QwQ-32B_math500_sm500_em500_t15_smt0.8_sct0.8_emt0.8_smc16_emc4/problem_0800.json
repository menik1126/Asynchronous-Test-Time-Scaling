            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial problem here. The polynomial is given by f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0. It has integer coefficients, and all its roots are distinct integers. I know that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and all roots are distinct integers, I can express it in its factored form. The polynomial can be written as f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), where each r_i is an integer, and all r_i are distinct.\n\nExpanding this factored form should give me the standard polynomial form, right? So if I multiply it out, the constant term a_0 will be 2 times the product of the roots with a negative sign because of the (-r_1)(-r_2)...(-r_n). So, a_0 = 2 * (-1)^n * r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n. We know a_0 is 66, so 2 * (-1)^n * (r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n) = 66.\n\nLet me write that as an equation: (r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n) * 2 * (-1)^n = 66. That means the product of the roots times (-1)^n is 33, because 66 divided by 2 is 33. So, (r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n) * (-1)^n = 33. Hmm, so that product has to be either 33 or -33 depending on whether n is even or odd because of the (-1)^n factor.\n\nWait, no. Actually, (-1)^n is either 1 or -1. So, the product of the roots times that is 33 or -33. So, the product of the roots is 33 or -33. Let me confirm: If n is even, (-1)^n is 1, so the product of roots is 33; if n is odd"

            "output": ", (-1)^n is -1, so the product of roots is -33. But actually, the product of the roots is (r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n) = (a_0)/(a_n) * (-1)^n. Wait, maybe I should recall Vieta's formula here.\n\nVieta's formula says that the product of the roots (for monic polynomial) is (-1)^n * a_0. But since our polynomial is not monic, it's 2 times the product of (x - r_i), so the leading coefficient is 2. Therefore, the product of the roots is (a_0)/a_n * (-1)^n? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, Vieta's formula for a general polynomial: For f(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0, the product of the roots is (-1)^n * (a_0 / a_n). So yes, exactly. Therefore, the product of the roots is (-1)^n * (a_0 / a_n). Since a_0 is 66 and a_n is 2, that product is (-1)^n * 66/2 = (-1)^n * 33. Therefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on n's parity. But since the roots are integers, their product must be an integer, which it is here.\n\nSo, the roots multiply to either 33 or -33. Since the roots are distinct integers, I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and then figure out the coefficients of the polynomial, particularly the coefficient a_{n-1}, which is the sum of the products of the roots taken (n-1) at a time, multiplied by (-1)^{n-1} and divided by a_n? Wait, maybe I need to recall Vieta's formula for the coefficients.\n\nLet me recall Vieta's formula properly. For a monic polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is the negative of the sum of the roots. But since our polynomial is not monic, but has leading coefficient 2, the coefficient a_{n-1} would be 2 times the coefficient from the monic version. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the polynomial is"

If I expand this, the coefficient a_{n-1} is 2 times the sum of all the roots, because each (x - r_i) contributes a term of -r_i, and when multiplied, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is the sum of the roots times 2. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently. When you expand (x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), the coefficient of x^{n} is 1, x^{n-1} is -(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n), x^{n-2} is sum_{i < j} r_i r_j, etc. So indeed, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is -(sum of roots).\n\nBut in our case, the polynomial is 2*(x - r_1)... So, the coefficient a_n is 2, so when we expand, a_{n-1} would be 2*(-(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)) = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). So, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. Therefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, I need to minimize 2*|sum of roots|, which is equivalent to minimizing |sum of roots|.\n\nSo, our problem reduces to: find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and whose sum is as close to zero as possible, since we need the absolute value of the sum to be as small as possible. So, the minimal |sum| would give the minimal |a_{n-1}|.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the divisors of 33 and -33, with distinct integers, such that their product is 33 or -33, and their sum is minimized in absolute value.\n\nFirst, factorizing 33: 33 = 1 * 3 * 11. So, the prime factors are 1, 3, and 11. But we can have negative factors as well because the product could be negative. So, for the product to be -33, we would"

So, the factors can be any combination of integers (positive, negative) as long as their product is 33 or -33, and they are distinct.\n\nWait a second, so we can choose the roots to be any integers, not just the factors of 33, but their product must be 33 or -33. So, for example, if the product is 33, the roots can be factors of 33, but they can also include 1 and -1 and other factors as long as their product is 33. Hmm, but maybe the minimal sum would be achieved with small integers. Let me think.\n\nLet me first list all possible combinations (with distinct integers) whose product is 33 or -33 and find the one with minimal sum.\n\nFirst, let's consider the product being 33.

So that's a sum of 7. So that's better than the previous 15. So that's a better option.\n\nWait, so that's three roots: -1, -3, 11. Their product is 33, sum is 7. So that's a candidate.\n\nAlternatively, can we get even smaller?\n\nWhat about four roots? Let's see. Let's try to split into four factors. For example, 1, -1, 3, -11.

If I want four factors, perhaps include a 1 and then split 3 or 11 into smaller factors. But 3 is prime, so can't split it, same with 11. So perhaps that's the only way to have four factors with product 33, which would involve including 1, -1, etc., but that seems to lead to higher sums.\n\nAlternatively, let's try including 33 as a root.
