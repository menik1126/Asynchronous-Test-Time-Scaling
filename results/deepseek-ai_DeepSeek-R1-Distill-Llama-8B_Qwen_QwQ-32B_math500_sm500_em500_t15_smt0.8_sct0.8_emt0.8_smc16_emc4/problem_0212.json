The formula for the area of a circle is πr².\n\nSo, the area of the largest circle is π*(7)² = 49π.\n\nNext, I'll find the area of the middle circle with a radius of 6. Applying the same formula, the area is π*(6)² = 36π.\n\nThen, I'll calculate the area of the smallest circle, which has a radius of 4. Its area is π*(4)² = 16π.\n\nNow, I'll determine the areas of each region based on the circles' radii.\n\nRegion Z is the area between the largest circle (7) and the middle circle (6). So, its area is 49π - 36π = 13π.\n\nRegion Y is the area between the middle circle (6) and the smallest circle (4). Therefore, its area is 36π - 16π = 20π.\n\nRegion X is the area of the smallest circle, which is 16π.\n\nFinally, to find the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest regions, I'll subtract the smallest area from the largest. That is, 13π - 6π = 7π.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the radii of the circles.**\n- The three concentric circles have radii of 4, 6, and 7 units.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the area of each circle.**\n- **Largest circle (radius = 7):** Area = \\( \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi \\)\n- **Middle circle (radius = 6):** Area = \\( \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi \\)\n- **Smallest circle (radius = 4):** Area = \\( \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the areas of the regions X, Y, and Z.**\n- **Region Z:** Area between the largest and middle circles.\n  \\[\n  49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13"
