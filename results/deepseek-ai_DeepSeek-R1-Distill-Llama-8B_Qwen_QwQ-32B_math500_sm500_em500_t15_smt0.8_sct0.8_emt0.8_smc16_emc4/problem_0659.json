This helps in translating the problem into equations.\n\nFrom the first statement, \"Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee,\" I can write the equation 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says, \"Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig,\" which translates to 2T + G = S.\n\nWith these two equations, I can solve for the relationship between treeks and squigs. By substituting the second equation into the first, I can eliminate G and find a direct relationship between T and S.\n\nAfter solving, I find that 5T equals the weight of one squig, meaning 5 treeks are equivalent to one squig in weight.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\nLet:\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Statements into Equations**\n\n1. **Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee:**\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:**\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1**\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( G \\) into Equation 1:\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( T \\) in Terms of \\( S \\)**\n\nBring \\( 2T \\) to the left side:\n\\[\n10T + 2T = 4S\n\\]\n\\[\n12T = 4S\n\\]\n\\[\nT = \\frac{4S}{12}\n\\]\n\\[\nT = \\frac{S}{3"
