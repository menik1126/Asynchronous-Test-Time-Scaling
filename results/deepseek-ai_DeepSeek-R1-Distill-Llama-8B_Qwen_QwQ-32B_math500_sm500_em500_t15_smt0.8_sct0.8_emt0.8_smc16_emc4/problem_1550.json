Hmm, I remember something about optimization using calculus or maybe the AM-GM inequality. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I recall that for optimization problems with constraints, methods like substitution or using Lagrange multipliers come into play. Since all variables are positive, AM-GM might be a good approach here. AM-GM is useful for maximizing or minimizing products under a sum constraint. That seems perfect for this problem.\n\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, with equality when all the numbers are equal. So, if I can express the product \\( ab^2c^3d^4 \\) in terms of variables that add up to a certain value, I can apply AM-GM.\n\nBut wait, the product isn't just four variables; it's each variable raised to different powers. Let me see. The exponents add up: 1 (for a) + 2 (for b) + 3 (for c) + 4 (for d) = 10. Interesting, that's the same as the sum of the variables. Maybe I can rewrite the product by splitting each variable into its exponent number of terms, each equal to the variable raised to the power of 1 divided by the exponent.\n\nSo, for example, \\( a \\) can be written as one term, \\( b \\) as two terms each of \\( \\frac{b}{2} \\), \\( c \\) as three terms each of \\( \\frac{c}{3} \\), and \\( d \\) as four terms each of \\( \\frac{d}{4} \\). Then, the sum of all these terms would be equal to 10.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\( a = a \\)\n\n\\( b = \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{b}{2} \\)\n\n\\( c = \\frac{c}{3} + \\frac{c}{3} + \\frac{c}{3} \\)\n\n\\( d = \\frac{d}{4} + \\frac{d}{4} + \\frac{d}{4} + \\frac{d"

Now, if we consider all the individual terms (each term like \\( a \\), each \\( \\frac{b}{2} \\), etc.), there are 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 terms in total. Since we want to maximize the product \\( ab^2c^3d^4 \\), which is equivalent to the product of all these ten terms (since \\( a \\times (\\frac{b}{2})^2 \\times 2! \\times (\\frac{c}{3})^3 \\times 3! \\times ...?

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the standard approach is to split the variables into terms equal to their exponents, so each term in the AM-GM is equal. Let me recall the proper method.\n\nSuppose we have variables x1, x2,..., xn with exponents e1, e2,..., en, such that the product is maximized with the sum S. The maximum occurs when each variable is proportional to its exponent divided by the total exponent. Wait, maybe that's the case?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the general method for optimization using AM-GM for a product with coefficients. Suppose we have variables a, b, c, d, and we need to maximize \\( a^p b^q c^r d^s \\) under the constraint \\( a + b + c + d = T \\). Then"

The weighted AM-GM states that for non-negative real numbers and positive weights, the weighted arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the weighted geometric mean.\n\nSo, to apply this, we need to assign weights proportional to the exponents of each variable in the product. Let me see.\n\nThe product to maximize is \\( ab^2c^3d^4 \\). So, the exponents sum to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. So, each variable can be associated with a weight equal to its exponent.\n\nThe weighted AM-GM inequality would state that for variables \\( a, b, b, c, c, c, d, d, d, d \\) (since exponent 2 means two terms of b, exponent 3 means three terms of c, etc.), the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\n\nSo, total terms are 1 (for a) + 2 (for b) + 3 (for c) + 4 (for d) = 10 terms. So, the arithmetic mean is \\( \\frac{a + b + b + c + c + c + d + d + d + d}{10} \\).\n\nThe geometric mean is the product of these terms raised to 1/10.\n\nSo, \\( GM = \\sqrt[10]{a \\times b \\times b \\times c \\times c \\times c \\times d \\times d \\times d \\times d} = \\sqrt[10]{ab^2c^3d^4} \\).\n\nBy AM-GM,\n\n\\( \\frac{a + 2b + 3c + 4d}{10} \\geq \\sqrt[10]{ab^2c^3d^4} \\).\n\nBut hold on, in our problem, the sum \\( a + b + c + d = 10 \\), but here we have \\( a + 2b + 3c + 4d \\). Hmm, that's not equal to 10. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to adjust the weights in such a way that the total sum remains 10.\n\nWait, let's see"
