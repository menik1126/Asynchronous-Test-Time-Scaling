The constraints are that x is at least 2 and y is at least 5. Hmm, alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the total number of cards is 54. If I'm dividing these equally among x players, each player gets y cards. So, mathematically, this is a division problem. That means the total number of cards should be evenly divisible by the number of players, right? So, 54 divided by y should give me an integer because each player gets y cards. Wait, no, actually, it's 54 divided by x that should equal y. Hmm, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me clarify.\n\nIf each player gets y cards, then y multiplied by x (the number of players) should equal the total number of cards. So, y * x = 54. That makes sense because each of the x players gets y cards, so the total is x times y. So, essentially, x and y are factors of 54 because y = 54/x and x and y have to be integers. Got it.\n\nNow, the constraints say that x is at least 2 and y is at least 5. So, x >= 2 and y >= 5. That means y can't be less than 5, so when I find possible values for x, I have to make sure that when I divide 54 by x, the result is at least 5.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that since y is at least 5, and y = 54/x, then 54/x >= 5. So, 54 divided by x is at least 5. Let me write that down:\n\n54/x >= 5\n\nTo find x, I can rearrange this inequality. Let's solve for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by x (assuming x is positive, which it is because the number of players can't be negative):\n\n54 >= 5x\n\nThen, divide both sides by 5:\n\n54/5 >= x\n\n54 divided by 5 is 10.8. So, x <= 10.8. But x has to be an integer because you can't have"

So, x is between 2 and 10, inclusive? Wait, but hold on, maybe not exactly. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the inequality is 54/x >=5, so x <= 54/5 = 10.8. Since x must be an integer, x can be up to 10. But also, since x must divide 54 exactly (because y has to be an integer), x must be a divisor of 54. So, first, I need to list all the divisors of 54, then see which ones are between 2 and 10 (since x must be at least 2 and at most 10.8, so up to 10). But also, the corresponding y must be at least 5. Wait, but since y = 54/x, and x is at most 10.8, so y is at least 5. So, actually, the constraints are equivalent to x being a divisor of 54, with x between 2 and 10 inclusive. Hmm, but let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should list all the divisors of 54 first, then check which ones satisfy the conditions. Let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find all the positive divisors of 54. Let's see, 54 factors into prime factors as 2 * 3^3. So, the divisors are all numbers of the form 2^a * 3^b where a is 0 or 1, and b is 0,1,2, or 3. Let me list them:\n\nStarting with 1 (since 2^0 * 3^0 =1), but x has to be at least 2, so we can skip 1.\n\nThen 2 (2^1 * 3^0)\n\n3 (2^0 * 3^1)\n\n6 (2^1 * 3^1)\n\n9 (2^0 * 3^2)\n\n18 (2^1 * 3^2)\n\n27 (2^0 * 3^3)\n\n5"

Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, 54 is 2 * 3^3, so its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\nSo, the divisors of 54 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nNow, we need to consider x >= 2 and y >=5, where y=54/x.\n\nSo, for each possible x (from the list of divisors), check if y = 54/x is >=5.\n\nLet me go through each x:\n\n1. x=2: y=54/2=27. 27 >=5? Yes. So, x=2 is valid.\n\n2. x=3: y=54/3=18. 18 >=5? Yes. So, x=3 is valid.\n\n3. x=6: y=54/6=9. 9 >=5? Yes. So, x=6 is valid.\n\n4. x=9: y=54/9=6. 6 >=5? Yes. So, x=9 is valid.\n\n5. x=18: y=54/18=3. 3 >=5? No. So, x=18 is invalid because y would be less than 5.\n\n6. x=27: y=54/27=2. 2 >=5? No. So, x=27 is invalid.\n\n7. x=54: y=54/54=1. 1 >=5? No. So, x=54 is invalid.\n\nSo, from the list of divisors, the valid x's are 2, 3, 6, and 9. That's four values.\n\nWait, but hold on, does x have to be a divisor, or can y be a non-integer? But in the problem statement, it says deal all the cards to x players, with each player getting y cards. So, each player must get an integer number of cards, right"

So x must be a divisor of 54, which aligns with our earlier approach.\n\nSo, only the divisors of 54 that are between 2 and 10, inclusive, are valid, which are x=2,3,6,9. So, 4 possible values.\n\nWait, but in the inequality earlier, I thought x could be up to 10, but the highest divisor of 54 less than or equal to 10 is 9. So, that works.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miss any divisors. The list of divisors is 1,2,3,6,9,18,27,54. So, up to 54. So, within x >=2 and x <=10, we have 2,3,6,9. So, 4 values.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we forget about divisors for a moment and think about how y must be at least 5. So, y >=5, which means that x must be <=54/5=10.8. So x can't be more than 10, as it must be integer. So, x can be 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. But x also has to be a divisor of 54, so from that list, only 2,3,6,9 are divisors of 54. 4 values.\n\nWait, maybe another way: since x*y=54, and y >=5, so the minimum y is 5, so the maximum x is 54/5=10.8, so x can be from 2 to 10, but only x that divides 54 is the valid ones.\n\nSo, yes, 2,3,6,9. That's four.\n\nSo, I think the possible values of x are 4. So, the number of possible values of x is 4.\n\nWait, hold on, is there a possibility that y could be a non-integer? But the problem says \"each player getting y cards,\" which implies that y must be an integer. Otherwise, you can't have a fraction of a card. So, yes, y has to be integer, so x must be a divisor of 54. So, only 4 values.\n\nWait, but let me double-check, just to make"

So between 2 and 10, inclusive, the divisors are 2,3,6,9. So that's four numbers. So, the answer is 4. Therefore, the number of possible x is 4. So, the final answer is 4, which in boxed form is \\boxed{4}.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me think again. Let me check each of those x values:\n\nFor x=2: y=27, which is okay because y >=5. So valid.\n\nx=3: y=18, okay.\n\nx=6: y=9, okay.\n\nx=9: y=6, okay.\n\nx=18: y=3, which is less than 5, so invalid.\n\nx=27: y=2, invalid.\n\nx=54: y=1, invalid.\n\nSo, yes, only 4 values. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut wait, is there a possible x=5? Let me see. 54 divided by 5 is 10.8, which is not an integer, so x=5 is not a divisor, so it's invalid. Similarly, x=4: 54 divided by 4 is 13.5, which is not an integer. So, those aren't valid. So, yeah, only the four divisors. So, the answer is 4. Hmm, seems right.\n\nAnother way: Let me list all possible divisors of 54 where x is between 2 and 10. So, 2,3,6,9. So, four numbers. Yep, that's it.
