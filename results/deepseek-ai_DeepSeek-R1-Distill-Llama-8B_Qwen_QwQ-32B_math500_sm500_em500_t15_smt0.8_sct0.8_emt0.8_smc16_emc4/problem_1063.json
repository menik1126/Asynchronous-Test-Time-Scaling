Since a hexagon has six sides, I multiply the side length by 6.\n\nNext, I'll determine the perimeter of the octagon by noting that it also has the same perimeter as the hexagon. Therefore, the octagon's perimeter is 6 times the length of one of its sides.\n\nTo find the length of one side of the octagon, I'll divide the total perimeter by the number of sides (which is 8).\n\nFinally, I'll simplify the calculation to find the exact length of each side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the side length of the regular octagon, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the perimeter of the regular octagon.**\n   \n   - Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the length of one side of the regular octagon.**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of one side} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter}}{\\text{Number of sides}} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{12}\\) cm"
