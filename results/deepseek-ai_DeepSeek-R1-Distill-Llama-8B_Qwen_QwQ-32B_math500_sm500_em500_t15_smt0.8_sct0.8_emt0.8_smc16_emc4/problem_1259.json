            "output": "First, I need to convert the decimal number 999 to its equivalent in base 6. To do this, I will divide 999 by 6 and keep track of the quotients and remainders.\n\nStarting with the initial division, 999 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 166 and a remainder of 3. I will record these values.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient from the first division, which is 166, and divide it by 6. This yields a quotient of 27 with a remainder of 4. I will note these results as well.\n\nMoving on, I'll divide the new quotient of 27 by 6, resulting in a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3. I'll continue this process.\n\nThen, I'll divide the quotient of 4 by 6, which gives a quotient of 0 with a remainder of 4. Since the quotient is now zero, I can stop the division process.\n\nNow, I will write out the remainders in reverse order to obtain the base six representation. Combining the remainders 4, 3, 4, and 3 gives me 4333 in base six.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of \\( 999_{10} \\), we'll perform division by 6 and keep track of the quotients and remainders.\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6:**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Quotient:** 166\n   - **Remainder:** 3\n\n2. **Divide 166 by 6:**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Quotient:** 27\n   - **Remainder:** 4\n\n3. **Divide 27 by 6:**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Quotient:** 4\n   - **Remainder:** 3\n\n4. **Divide 4 by 6:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Quotient:**"
