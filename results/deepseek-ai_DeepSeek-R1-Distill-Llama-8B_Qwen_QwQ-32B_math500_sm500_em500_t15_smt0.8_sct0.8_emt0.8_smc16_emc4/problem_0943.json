            "output": "To determine the number of trailing zeros in 42!, I need to count how many times the factor 10 is multiplied within the factorial. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, I'll find out how many pairs of 2s and 5s are present in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!. This is done by dividing 42 by 5 and then by 25, and so on, discarding any fractional parts. \n\n42 divided by 5 equals 8.4, which means there are 8 multiples of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 42. When divided by 25, which is 5 squared, 42 divided by 25 equals 1.68, so there is 1 extra multiple of 25. Therefore, the total number of 5s is 8 plus 1, resulting in 9 fives.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 2s in the prime factors of 42!. I'll divide 42 by 2, then by 4, 8, 16, and so on, again discarding any fractional parts. \n\n42 divided by 2 is 21, which gives 21 twos. Dividing 42 by 4 gives 10.5, so 10 fours. Dividing by 8 gives 5.25, resulting in 5 eights. Dividing by 16 gives 2.625, so 2 sixteenths. Dividing by 32 gives 1.3125, resulting in 1 thirty-two. Finally, dividing by 64 gives 0.65625, which we discard as there are no more multiples beyond 64 within 42.\n\nAdding up all the 2s: 21 plus 10 plus 5 plus 2 plus 1 equals 39 twos.\n\nSince there are 9 fives and 39 twos in the prime factorization of 42!, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s, which is the minimum of 9 and 39. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times the factor \\(10\\) appears in the prime factor"
