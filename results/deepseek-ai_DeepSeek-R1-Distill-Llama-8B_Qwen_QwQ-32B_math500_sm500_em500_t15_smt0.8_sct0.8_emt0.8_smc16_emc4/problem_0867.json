The goal is to write the entire expression in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I need to find the sum a + b + c.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression has two parts: one involving \u221a2 and the other involving \u221a3. That might be a good starting point. So, I can separate the terms into two groups: those with \u221a2 and those with \u221a3.\n\nSo, let's write it as (\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2) + (\u221a3 + 1/\u221a3). Now, for each group, I can try to combine them into a single fraction. \n\nStarting with the \u221a2 terms: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2. To combine these, I need a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and \u221a2, so the common denominator would be \u221a2. \n\nLet me rewrite \u221a2 as (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/\u221a2 because that's equivalent to \u221a2. \u221a2 times \u221a2 is 2, so that becomes 2/\u221a2. Now, adding 1/\u221a2 to that: 2/\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 = (2 + 1)/\u221a2 = 3/\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, for the \u221a3 terms: \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. Using the same approach, \u221a3 can be rewritten as (\u221a3 * \u221a3)/\u221a3, which is 3/\u221a3. Adding 1/\u221a3 to that: 3/\u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 = (3 + 1)/\u221a3 = 4/\u221a3.\n\nSo now, the entire expression becomes 3/\u221a2 + 4/\u221a3. Now, I have two fractions with square roots in the denominators. I need to combine them into a single fraction. To do that, I need a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are \u221a2 and \u221a3. The least common denominator (LCD) for \u221a2 and \u221a3 would be \u221a2 * \u221a3, which is \u221a6. So, let"

I need to multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a3 to get \u221a6 in the denominator. So, 3/\u221a2 = (3\u221a3)/(\u221a2 * \u221a3) = 3\u221a3/\u221a6.\n\nNext, 4/\u221a3. I need to multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a2 to get \u221a6 in the denominator. So, 4/\u221a3 = (4\u221a2)/(\u221a3 * \u221a2) = 4\u221a2/\u221a6.\n\nNow, add the two fractions together: 3\u221a3/\u221a6 + 4\u221a2/\u221a6. Since the denominators are the same, I can add the numerators: (3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2)/\u221a6.\n\nSo, the expression is now (3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2)/\u221a6. But the problem wants it in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c. Right now, I have (4\u221a2 + 3\u221a3)/\u221a6. So, that's almost in the desired form, except the denominator is \u221a6. I need to rationalize the denominator if possible, but the problem doesn't specify that c has to be rationalized. Wait, actually, in the given form, c is supposed to be a positive integer. But \u221a6 is irrational. So, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says the form is (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a, b, c are positive integers. So, c must be an integer, but in my current expression, c is \u221a6, which is irrational. That can't be. So, maybe I need to rationalize the denominator?\n\nBut how? Because in the current step, I have (3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2)/\u221a6. If I rationalize the denominator, I would multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a6. Let me try that.\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a6: [(3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2) * \u221a6] / (\u221a6 * \u221a6) = [(3\u221a3 * \u221a6) + (4\u221a2 * \u221a6)] / 6.\n\nCalculating the terms in the numerator:\n\nFirst term: 3\u221a3 * \u221a6 = 3\u221a(3*6)"

So, 3\u221a18 = 3*(3\u221a2) = 9\u221a2.\n\nSecond term: 4\u221a2 * \u221a6 = 4\u221a(2*6) = 4\u221a12. \u221a12 can be simplified as 2\u221a3. So, 4\u221a12 = 4*2\u221a3 = 8\u221a3.\n\nSo, numerator becomes 9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3.\n\nDenominator is 6.\n\nSo, the expression becomes (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nNow, this is in the desired form: (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a = 9, b = 8, and c = 6.\n\nWait, are a, b, and c positive integers? Yes, 9, 8, and 6 are positive integers. And c is 6, which is as small as possible because we already rationalized the denominator, so I don't think c can be smaller than 6.\n\nLet me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2:\n\n\u221a2 is equal to 2/\u221a2, so adding 1/\u221a2 gives 3/\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 is 4/\u221a3.\n\nAdding 3/\u221a2 + 4/\u221a3.\n\nThen, to combine, I found the LCD as \u221a6, converted both fractions:\n\n3/\u221a2 = (3\u221a3)/\u221a6 and 4/\u221a3 = (4\u221a2)/\u221a6.

Then we have (3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2)/\u221a6.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the form is (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, so c is in the denominator. So, in that case, c is \u221a6, which is not an integer. So, no, that's not acceptable because c must be a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to have c as 6 in the final expression. So, a=9, b=8, c=6. So, a+b+c=23.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure my rationalization step is correct.\n\nLet me compute (3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2)\u221a6 again.\n\nFirst term: 3\u221a3 * \u221a6 = 3\u221a(3*6) = 3\u221a18 = 3*3\u221a2 = 9\u221a2.
