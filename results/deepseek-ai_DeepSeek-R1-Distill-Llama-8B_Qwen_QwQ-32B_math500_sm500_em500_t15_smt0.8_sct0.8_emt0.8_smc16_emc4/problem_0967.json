            "output": "I need to determine the value of \\( x \\) such that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same under two different scenarios.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables. Denali currently walks \\( 16 \\) dogs, and Nate walks \\( 12 \\) dogs. Their pay is proportional to the number of dogs they walk.\n\nUnder the first scenario, Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs while Nate's number of dogs remains the same. This means Denali would have \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs and Nate would still have \\( 12 \\) dogs. The ratio of their pay would then be \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\).\n\nUnder the second scenario, \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. This means Denali would have \\( 16 + x \\) dogs and Nate would have \\( 12 - x \\) dogs. The ratio of their pay in this case would be \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\).\n\nSince the ratios are equal in both scenarios, I can set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nSetting up the equation: \\(\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\\).\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, I'll cross-multiply: \\( (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = (16 + x)(12) \\).\n\nExpanding both sides: \\( 192 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x \\).\n\nCombining like terms: \\( 32x - 4x^2 = 12x \\).\n\nRearranging the equation: \\( -4x^2 + 32x - 12x = 0 \\) which simplifies to \\( -4x^2 + 20x = 0 \\).\n\nFactoring out the common term: \\( -4x(x - 5) = 0 \\).\n\nSolving for \\( x \\): \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = 5 \\). Since \\( x \\neq 0 \\), the solution is \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nAfter verifying both scenarios with \\( x = 5 \\), the ratio remains consistent, confirming that the correct value is 5.\n</think>\n\nLet's"

    "question": "Denali and Nate work for a dog walking business and are paid for each dog they walk. Denali is responsible for $16$ dogs and Nate is responsible for $12$ dogs. Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali. Find $x$ if $x\\neq0$."
