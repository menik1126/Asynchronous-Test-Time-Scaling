            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where \u03c9 is a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that if \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, then \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2. So, \u03c9 can be any of these three values. But since the problem is asking for all possible values of the given expression, I might need to compute it for each case and see what results I get.\n\nWait, but before jumping into plugging in each value, maybe there's a smarter way using algebraic manipulations. Let me recall that for cube roots of unity, the sum \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 = 0. That's a key property. Also, \u03c9\u00b2 is the complex conjugate of \u03c9 if we're considering the non-real roots. Hmm, that might be helpful.\n\nOkay, so the expression is S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Maybe I can combine these two fractions into one. Let me try that.\n\nTo add them, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + \u03c9) and (1 + \u03c9\u00b2), so the common denominator would be (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me compute the numerator.\n\nFirst, I'll write S as:\n\nS = [ (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) ] / [ (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplifying the numerator: (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nAnd the denominator: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me expand that.\n\nMultiplying out, I get:\n\n1*1 + 1*\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9*1 + \u03c9*\u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3.\n\nBut since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, as given, so \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. So, substituting that in, the denominator becomes:\n\n1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nWait, so the numerator is 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2, and the denominator is also 2 + \u03c9 +"

That can't be right because that would mean S is always 1, but I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check. When I expand (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2), I get 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3. But \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so yes, that becomes 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2. So the numerator is also 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2. Therefore, S simplifies to 1. So, regardless of \u03c9, as long as \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, S equals 1.\n\nBut hold on, that seems too straightforward. Let me test it with specific values to make sure.\n\nCase 1: \u03c9 = 1. Then S = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, that works.\n\nCase 2: Let's choose \u03c9 = (-1 + i\u221a3)/2, which is a primitive cube root of unity. Then \u03c9\u00b2 = (-1 - i\u221a3)/2.\n\nCompute S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + \u03c9: 1 + (-1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = (1 - 1/2) + i\u221a3/2 = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2. Similarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo S = 1/(1/2 + i\u221a3/2) + 1/(1/2 - i\u221a3/2). Let me compute each term.\n\nFirst term: 1/(1/2 + i\u221a3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by 2: 2/(1 + i\u221a3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i\u221a3): 2(1 - i\u221a3)/(1 + 3) = 2(1 - i\u221a3)/4 = (1 - i\u221a3)/2.\n\nSecond term: Similarly, 1/(1/2 - i\u221a3/2) becomes 2/(1 - i\u221a3).

So the ratio is indeed 1. Hence, S = 1 for any \u03c9, as long as \u03c9\u00b3 = 1.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another approach to see this. Let me think about using the properties of cube roots of unity. I remember that \u03c9 \u2260 1, so if \u03c9 \u2260 1, then 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. Thus, \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1.\n\nWait, but does that help? Let's see.\n\nFrom 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, we can get \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1.\n\nSo, in the numerator and denominator, we have 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo, S = 1/1 = 1. That's another way to see it without plugging in all the values.\n\nTherefore, the possible value is just 1. So the expression always equals 1, regardless of which cube root of unity \u03c9 is (as long as it's not 1, but if \u03c9 = 1, we've checked that it still works).\n\nHence, the only possible value is 1.\n</think>\n\nAlright, after carefully working through the problem, considering both specific cases and general algebraic manipulations, we find that the expression always equals 1 for any cube root of unity \u03c9. \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. Recognize that \u03c9 is a cube root of unity, so \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. The cube roots of unity are 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1 and \u03c9\u00b2 \u2260 1.\n\n2. Use the property of cube roots of unity: \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 = 0. This implies that \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1.\n\n3.
