Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the polynomial is of degree 8, and it looks somewhat similar to a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Let me write it as \\( (x^4)^2 + 3(x^4) - 4 \\). Oh, that's like \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\) where \\( y = x^4 \\). Maybe I can factor this quadratic in \\( y \\) first.\n\nLet me try factoring \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), the polynomial becomes \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nNow, each of these factors can be factored further. Starting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\), which is a difference of squares. So, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\). Then, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) is another difference of squares: \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\). So, putting it all together, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nNow, looking at \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm, can this be factored into polynomials with integer coefficients? I remember that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is a special case and can be factored as a product of two quadratics. The formula for this is \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2"

Let me check that by expanding:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 4\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n- \\( x^4 \\)\n- \\( (-2x^3 + 2x^3) = 0 \\)\n- \\( (2x^2 - 4x^2 + 2x^2) = 0 \\)\n- \\( (4x - 4x) = 0 \\)\n- \\( +4 \\)\nSo, it simplifies back to \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Perfect, that works.\n\nSo now, putting everything together, we have:\n\n\\[\nx^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1)\n\\]\n\nLet me list all the factors:\n1. \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\)\n3. \\( x + 1 \\)\n4. \\( x - 1 \\)\n5. \\( x^2 + 1 \\)\n\nEach of these is monic, has integer coefficients, and can't be factored further over the integers.

Let me double-check each computation:\n\n1. \\( 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \\). That seems correct.\n2. \\( 1 - 2 + 2 = 1 \\). Yup.\n3. \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\). Simple enough.\n4. \\( 1 - 1 = 0 \\). No issues there.\n5. \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\). Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 5 + 1 is 6, 6 + 2 is 8, 8 + 0 is still 8, and 8 + 2 is 10. Hmm, so the total is 10.\n\nIs there a possibility I missed a factor? Let me check the original polynomial and the factoring again.\n\nOriginal: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\)\nFactored into: \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\)\nFurther factored into: \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\)\nEach of these is irreducible over integers, as I checked for each quadratic.\n\nSo, I think the factorization is correct. Therefore, the sum should be 10.\n\nWait, but just to ensure, let me count the number of factors. There are 5 factors. Each contributes 5,1,2,0,2. So 5+1=6, 6+2=8, 8+0=8, 8+2=10. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of another way to factor \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). For example, could it be factored into more than four polynomials? But since we have a quadratic in \\( x^4"

No, it's irreducible because it doesn't have real roots, let alone integer ones. Similarly, the other quadratics: \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\) discriminant is \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), so no real roots, so irreducible over integers. Similarly, \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) discriminant is \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), also irreducible. The linear terms can't be factored further. So all factors are indeed irreducible.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 10. Wait, but let me check once more the calculation of each p_i(1):\n\n1. \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\) at 1: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Correct.\n2. \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\): 1 -2 +2 =1. Correct.\n3. \\( x +1 \\): 2. Correct.\n4. \\( x -1 \\): 0. Correct.\n5. \\( x^2 +1 \\): 2. Correct.\n\nTotal: 5+1+2+0+2 = 10. Hmm, so I think that's correct. But let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using substitution or evaluating the original polynomial at x=1 and see if that relates?\n\nWait, the original polynomial evaluated at x=1 is 1 + 3 -4 = 0. Hmm, but the product of all p_i(1) should be equal to the original polynomial evaluated at 1, right? Since if you plug in x=1 into the product, it's the product of each p_i(1). So, the product of all p_i(1) should be 0. Let me check that with my factors:\n\n5 * 1 * 2 * 0 * 2 = 0. Which matches the original polynomial's value at 1. So that's a good consistency check. But the question is asking for the sum, not the product. So the product is zero, but the sum is"
