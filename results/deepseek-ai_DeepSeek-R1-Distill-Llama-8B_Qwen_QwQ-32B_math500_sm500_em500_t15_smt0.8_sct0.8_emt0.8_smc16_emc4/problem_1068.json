            "output": "First, I determine the perimeter of the hexagon. A regular hexagon has six equal sides, each measuring 16 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, I set up the equation for the octagon's perimeter. A regular octagon has eight equal sides, so each side length can be calculated by dividing the total perimeter by 8.\n\nFinally, I divide the total perimeter of the octagon by 8 to find each side length. This gives me 96 cm divided by 8, which equals 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   - **Perimeter of Hexagon** = \\( 6 \\times 16 \\, \\text{cm} = 96 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Perimeter of the Octagon:**\n   \n   - Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon:\n   - **Perimeter of Octagon** = \\( 96 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of Each Side of the Octagon:**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   - **Side Length of Octagon** = \\( \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of Octagon}}{8} \\).\n   - **Side Length** = \\( \\frac{96 \\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{12 \\, \\text{cm}}"
