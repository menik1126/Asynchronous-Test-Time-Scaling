In this case, \\( 2^{24} \\) must be expressed as \\( m^n \\). \n\nStarting with the prime factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\), we see that it is already in its simplest form with the single prime number 2 raised to the 24th power. \n\nTo find all possible values of \\( n \\), I need to identify the exponents that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as when raised to different powers. The exponent 24 can be divided by various integers greater than 1, such as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. \n\nEach divisor of 24 corresponds to a possible exponent \\( n \\) where \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power. Specifically, \\( 2^{24} \\) can be written as \\( (2^k)^n \\) where \\( k \\) is \\( 24/n \\). \n\nListing all the valid values of \\( n \\), I find there are 8 such integers: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48. However, since \\( n \\) must be greater than 1, 48 is not a valid exponent for this problem.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power is 7.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Condition**\n\nWe need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) can"
