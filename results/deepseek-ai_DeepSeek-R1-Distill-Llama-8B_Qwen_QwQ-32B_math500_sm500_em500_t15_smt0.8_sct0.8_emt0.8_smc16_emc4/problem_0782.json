The question is asking for the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). The answer should be expressed in the form \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) is square-free. Then, we need to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nFirst, I recall that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. For any point \\( (x, y) \\), the distance \\( D \\) from the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) is given by:\n\\[ D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\]\n\nGiven the function \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), I can substitute this into the distance formula to express \\( D \\) solely in terms of \\( x \\).\n\nSo, substituting \\( y \\) into the distance formula:\n\\[ D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\]\n\nLet me simplify this expression step by step. First, square the \\( y \\) term:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\times (x^2 - 3)^2 \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (x^2 - 3)^2 \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \\]\n\nNow, substitute this back into the distance formula:\n\\[ D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \\]\n\nLet me combine like terms inside the square root:\nFirst, express \\( x^2 \\) with a denominator of 2 to add to \\( \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \\):\n\\[ x^2 = \\frac{2x^2}{"

We need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes \\( f(x) \\).\n\nTo find the minimum, I should take the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and set it equal to zero.
