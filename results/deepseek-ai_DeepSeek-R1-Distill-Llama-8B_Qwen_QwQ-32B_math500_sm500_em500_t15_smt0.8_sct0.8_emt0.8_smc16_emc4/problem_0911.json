            "output": "First, I need to understand the given fraction: 21 divided by (2 squared times 5 to the seventh power). This means the denominator is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u2077.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the denominator to simplify the fraction. 2 squared is 4, and 5 to the seventh power is 78,125. Multiplying these together gives 4 \u00d7 78,125, which equals 312,500.\n\nNow, the fraction becomes 21/312,500. To convert this to a decimal, I'll divide 21 by 312,500. This calculation results in 0.000067.\n\nTherefore, the terminating decimal representation of 21/(2\u00b2\u00d75\u2077) is 0.000067.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Denominator**:\n   \n   Calculate the value of the denominator:\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 4 \\cdot 78125 = 312500\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Express the Fraction**:\n   \n   The fraction now is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{312500}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Divide Numerator by Denominator**:\n   \n   Perform the division \\(21 \\div 312500\\):\n   \\[\n   21 \\div 312500 = 0.000067\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Terminating Decimal**:\n   \n   The result of the division is a terminating decimal:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.000067}\n   \\]"
