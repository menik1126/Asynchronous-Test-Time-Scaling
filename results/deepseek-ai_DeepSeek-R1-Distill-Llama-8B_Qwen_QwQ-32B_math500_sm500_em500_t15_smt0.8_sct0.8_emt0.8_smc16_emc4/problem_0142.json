That means 4\\$ is 4!^(4!^(4!^...)) with 4! in the exponent. Hmm, that's a bit confusing, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a factorial is. For a small number like 4, 4! is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which equals 24. So, 4\\$ is going to be 24 raised to some huge exponent. The exponent is itself another superfactorial, but let's see if we can find a pattern or a repeating cycle in the units digit.\n\nI remember that units digits of powers often repeat in cycles. For example, the units digit of powers of 2 cycles every 4: 2, 4, 8, 6, and then repeats. Maybe 24 has a similar pattern. But 24 isn't a single-digit number, so I need to find the units digit of 24^k for various exponents k.\n\nWait, 24 is a two-digit number. The units digit of 24^k will only depend on the units digit of 24, which is 4. So, actually, the units digit of 24^k is the same as the units digit of 4^k. That simplifies things.\n\nSo now, I just need to find the units digit of 4 raised to some power. But what's the exponent? The exponent in 4\\$ is 4!^(4!^...). Let's compute the exponents step by step.\n\nStarting from the top exponent, which is 4!, we have:\n\nFirst exponent: 4! = 24.\n\nSo 4\\$ = 4!^(24^...)\n\nNext, we need to compute the next exponent, which is 24^(24^...). But wait, calculating 24^something is still huge, but since we're only interested in the units digit of the final result, maybe we can find a pattern or use modulo arithmetic.\n\nI remember that Euler's theorem might help here. If two numbers are coprime, say a and m, then a^φ(m) ≡ 1 mod m, where φ is Euler's totient function"

            "output": ". Since we are dealing with the units digit, we can consider modulus 10. So maybe if we can compute the exponent modulo φ(10), then we can simplify.\n\nLet me confirm Euler's theorem here. The totient of 10 is φ(10)=φ(2×5)=φ(2)*φ(5)=1×4=4. So Euler's theorem tells us that for any integer a coprime to 10, a^4 ≡1 mod 10. However, 4 and 10 are not coprime (gcd(4,10)=2), so Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can focus on the exponent modulo the cycle length of the units digit of 4. Since the units digit cycles every 2? Let me check the powers of 4:\n\n4^1 = 4 → units digit 4\n\n4^2 = 16 → 6\n\n4^3 = 64 → 4\n\n4^4 = 256 → 6\n\nSo the cycle length here is 2: 4,6,4,6,... so every even exponent gives 6, odd exponent gives 4. Therefore, the units digit of 4^k is 4 if k is odd and 6 if k is even. \n\nTherefore, if I can determine whether the exponent (which is 24^(24^...)) is even or odd, that would tell me whether the units digit is 4 or 6. \n\nSince the exponent is 24^(something). Now, 24 is even, so any power of 24 will also be even (since 24^1 =24 even, 24^2=576 even, etc.), so 24^(anything) is even. Therefore, the exponent is even, so the units digit should be 6?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me step back.\n\nWait, actually, the exponent here is 24^(24^...). Let's see how many exponents there are. The original definition is n\\$ = n! with n! instances of n! as exponents. Since n is 4, n! is 24, so 4\\$ is a tower of 24 exponents, each being 2"

Let me double-check.\n\nThe superfactorial n\\$ is n! raised to the power of itself n! times. So that is n!^{n!^{n!^{...}}} where the exponent has n! terms.\n\nSo for 4$, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{...}}} with 4! in the exponent part. How many levels deep is that?\n\nWait, the question isn't specific on the number of exponents. It just says n!^{n!^{...}} with n! in the exponent. So, for 4$, it's a power tower with an infinite number of 4!s?\n\nHmm, perhaps not infinite, but n! levels. So for n=4, that would be a tower of 4! =24 instances. But that seems unwieldy. Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is 4!^{4!^{...}} with 4! in the exponent, meaning a tower of one 4!?\n\nWait, maybe I got confused.

That's an extremely tall tower. But we need the units digit of this tower.\n\nHmm, okay. So the problem reduces to finding the units digit of a tower of 24s of height 24. Since the units digit cycles every certain number, perhaps we can find the exponent modulo 4 or something?\n\nWait, but let's see. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the units digit of 24^k is the same as the units digit of 4^k, as I thought before. So, to find the units digit of the tower, we can instead consider the tower of 4s with the same height, but that might not be necessary. Wait, actually, the base is 24, so the first exponent is 24, so the first step is 24^(something). The units digit of 24^(something) is the same as 4^(something mod 2), since the cycle length for 4 is 2. Wait, let me confirm:\n\nThe units digit of 4^k cycles every 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nTherefore, if the exponent is even, units digit is 6; if odd, 4.\n\nTherefore, to find the units digit of 24^(E), where E is the rest of the tower (height 23), we need to know whether E is even or odd.\n\nBut E is 24^(24^...), which is 24 raised to some power. Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so E is even. Therefore, the exponent E is even, so 24^E has units digit 6.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. The exponent E is the tower of 24s of height 23. Since the height is 23, which is still a large number, but regardless, the exponent is 24^(something). Since 24 is even, any exponentiation of it will be even, so E is even. Therefore, the exponent is even, so 4^"

So, E is 24^something, which is a multiple of 24, so E is even. Thus, 24^E will have a units digit of 6.\n\nTherefore, the innermost exponent is E, which is even, so 24^E has units digit 6. Therefore, 4\\$, which is 24^E, has units digit 6.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So the tower is 24^(24^(...)) with 24 levels. So to compute 24^24^24^...^24, with 24 copies.\n\nBut to find the units digit, we can find the exponent modulo the cycle length. Since the cycle length for units digit of 4 is 2, we can say that if the exponent is even, units digit is 6.\n\nBut is the exponent even? Yes, because it's a tower of 24s with 23 levels above. So E = 24^24^...^24 with 23 levels. Now, 24 is even, so 24^anything is even. So E is even. Therefore, 24^E has units digit 6.\n\nBut wait, let's consider the exponent tower again. 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 levels. So, the top of the tower is 24. Then next level is 24^24. But 24^24 is a multiple of 24, so the next level exponent is even. Therefore, the next level exponent is even, so 24^(even) has a units digit of 6. Then, going one level up, that exponent is 6 mod 10? Hmm, not necessarily.\n\nWait, no. Wait, we need to compute 24^(something).

So T(1) =24, T(2)=24^24, T(3)=24^(24^24), etc., up to T(24).\n\nWe need to compute T(24) mod 10.\n\nTo compute T(24) mod 10, we can use Euler's theorem, but since 24 and 10 are not coprime, Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. However, since we're dealing with mod 10, we can break it down into mod 2 and mod 5, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, since the units digit is mod 10, and 10 factors into 2 and 5, perhaps we can compute mod 2 and mod 5 separately.\n\nFirst, mod 2: 24 is congruent to 0 mod 2, so any power of 24 is 0 mod 2. So T(24) ≡ 0 mod 2.\n\nNow mod 5: Let's compute T(24) mod 5.\n\nTo compute 24^(T(23)) mod 5. Since 24 ≡ -1 mod 5.
