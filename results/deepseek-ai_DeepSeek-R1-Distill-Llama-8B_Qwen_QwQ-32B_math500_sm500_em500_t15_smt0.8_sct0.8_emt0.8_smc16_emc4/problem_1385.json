I remember that when you apply a matrix to a vector, it's like a linear transformation. But I'm not entirely sure how transformations affect entire lines, especially when they're defined by equations like y = 2x + 1. Hmm, maybe I should start by recalling what the matrix M looks like based on the given information.\n\nAlright, the matrix M takes the vector [2; -1] to [9; 3] and [1; -3] to [7; -1]. So, that means if I set M multiplied by [2; -1] equals [9; 3], which gives me two equations. Similarly, M times [1; -3] equals [7; -1]. So, I can write M as a 2x2 matrix with variables a, b, c, d such that:\n\n[ a  b ] [2]   = [9]\n[ c  d ] [-1]  = [3]\n\nand\n\n[ a  b ] [1]   = [7]\n[ c  d ] [-3]  = [-1]\n\nSo, let me write these as equations:\n\nFrom the first transformation:\n1. 2a + (-1)b = 9\n2. 2c + (-1)d = 3\n\nFrom the second transformation:\n3. 1a + (-3)b = 7\n4. 1c + (-3)d = -1\n\nSo, I have four equations with four unknowns: a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d = 3\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nOkay, so I can solve for a and b first. Let me take Equations 1 and 3.\n\nFrom Equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom Equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nMaybe I can solve Equation 3 for a: a = 7 + 3b\n\nThen substitute into Equation 1:\n\n2*(7 + 3b) - b = 9"

Now, I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M.\n\nHmm, how do I do that? I think the image of a line under a linear transformation is another line, right? So, I need to figure out what happens when I apply M to points on y = 2x + 1.\n\nAlternatively, since y = 2x + 1 is a line, maybe I can parameterize it and then apply M to the parameterization.\n\nLet me try that. Let me let x = t, then y = 2t + 1. So, any point on the line can be written as [t; 2t + 1]. So, applying M to [t; 2t + 1] would give [4t - (2t +1); 2t + 1]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst component: 4t - (2t + 1) = 4t - 2t -1 = 2t -1\n\nSecond component: 2t + 1\n\nSo, the transformed point is [2t -1; 2t +1]\n\nWait, so in terms of"

Let me express y in terms of x.\n\nLet me write:\n\nx = 2t - 1\n\nSo, t = (x +1)/2\n\nThen, y = 2t +1 = 2*( (x +1)/2 ) +1 = (x +1) + 1 = x +2\n\nSo, y = x + 2.\n\nWait, so is that it? So, the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M is y = x + 2.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the direction vector of y = 2x +1. The direction vector is [1; 2]. So, if I apply M to [1; 2], what do I get? Let's check.\n\nM*[1;2] = [4*1 -1*2; 2*1 +1*2] = [4 -2; 2 +2] = [2;4]\n\nSo, the direction vector is [2;4], which can be simplified to [1;2] if we divide by 2. Wait, but the transformed direction vector is [2;4], which is just 2*[1;2]. So, scaling by 2. So, the direction of the image line is [2;4], so the slope would be 4/2 = 2.\n\nWait, but earlier I got y = x +2, which has a slope of 1. So, that contradicts.\n\nHmm, so maybe I did something wrong in parameterizing.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-examine.\n\nI thought that any point on y = 2x +1 can be written as [t; 2t +1], which is correct. Then, applying M gives [4t - (2t +1); 2t +1] which is [2t -1; 2t +1].\n\nSo, in terms of coordinates, x = 2t -1, y = 2t +1. So, let me express t in terms of x.\n\nx = 2t -1 => t = (x +1"

So, why the discrepancy?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the original line is not a vector, but a line with an offset. The direction vector is [1;2], but the line is not through the origin. So, the direction vector of the transformed line should have the direction of M applied to the direction vector of the original line, which is [2;4], so slope 2. But the calculation here is giving slope 1. That must mean I made an error.\n\nWait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, matrix M is [4, -1; 2,1].\n\nSo, applying M to [t;2t+1]:\n\nFirst component: 4*t + (-1)*(2t +1) = 4t -2t -1 = 2t -1.\n\nSecond component: 2*t + 1*(2t +1) = 2t + 2t +1 = 4t +1.\n\nWait, wait! Wait a second, I think I messed up in the second component. Let me recalculate.\n\nSecond component: c*t + d*(2t +1) where c=2, d=1. So, 2*t + 1*(2t +1) = 2t +2t +1 = 4t +1.\n\nOh! I see, I made a mistake here earlier. Originally, I thought the second component was 2t +1, but that's incorrect. Let me redo this.\n\nSo, when I compute M multiplied by [t; y], where y=2t +1, so the vector is [t, 2t +1].\n\nSo:\n\nFirst component: (4)(t) + (-1)(2t +1) = 4t -2t -1 = 2t -1.\n\nSecond component: (2)(t) + (1)(2t +1) = 2t + 2t +1 = 4t +1.\n\nAh, so actually, the second component is 4t +1, not 2"

Because I incorrectly computed the second component.\n\nSo, the correct image of the line is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, but let me verify this again.\n\nLet me compute M*[t; 2t +1] again:\n\nFirst component: 4*t -1*(2t +1) = 4t -2t -1 = 2t -1.\n\nSecond component: 2*t +1*(2t +1)= 2t +2t +1=4t +1.\n\nSo, yes, y =4t +1.\n\nSo, x=2t -1, so t=(x +1)/2, so y=4*( (x +1)/2 ) +1=2(x +1) +1=2x +2 +1=2x +3.\n\nSo, the image is y=2x +3.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Let me take a point on the original line and apply M, and see if it maps to a point on y=2x +3.\n\nTake t=0: [0;1]. Applying M: [0*4 + (-1)*1= -1; 0*2 +1*1=1]. So, point (-1;1). Plug into y=2x +3: y=2*(-1) +3= -2 +3=1. So, yes, that works.\n\nAnother point: t=1: [1;3]. Applying M: [4*1 -1*3=4-3=1;"

Applying M: [4*(-1) -1*(-1)= -4 +1= -3; 2*(-1) +1*(-1)= -2 -1= -3]. So, (-3, -3). Plug into y=2x +3: 2*(-3)+3= -6 +3= -3. Correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems to check out. So, the image is y=2x +3. Wait, but why did I get confused earlier?\n\nBecause I miscalculated the second component. So, the correct answer is y=2x +3.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to consider the general equation of the line and apply the inverse transformation. Wait, but maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the transformation is linear, except that lines not through the origin will be transformed to lines, but the image of a line can be found by transforming two points on the line and then finding the equation of the line through those two transformed points.\n\nLet me try that method to confirm.\n\nTake two points on the original line y=2x +1.\n\nLet me choose t=0: (0,1) as before, which transforms to (-1,1).\n\nAnother point, say t=1: (1,3) transforms to (1,5).\n\nSo, the two transformed points are (-1,1) and (1,5). Let's find the equation of the line through these two points.\n\nSlope m=(5-1)/(1 - (-1))=4/2=2.\n\nThen, using point-slope form with point (-1,1):\n\ny -1 =2(x +1)\n\ny =2x +2 +1=2x +3. Same result. So that's good.\n\nAlternatively, using the other point (1,5):\n\ny -5=2(x -1)\n\ny=2x -2 +5=2x +3. Same.\n\nTherefore, the image is y="
