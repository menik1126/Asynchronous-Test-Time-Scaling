The prime factors suggest that the minimal set is {2, 2, 3, 7}, which gives a product of 84. However, these integers are not all distinct, so I need to adjust them.\n\nTo make the integers distinct, I'll replace the duplicate 2 with the next smallest integer, 4. Now, the set becomes {2, 3, 4, 7}, and the sum is 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 16.\n\nI'll check if there's a smaller sum possible with more integers. If I split 4 into 2 and 2, the set would be {2, 2, 3, 7}, but this isn't allowed because the integers must be distinct. Therefore, the set {2, 3, 4, 7} with a sum of 16 is the minimal sum that satisfies the conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84**:\n   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify the Prime Factors**:\n   - The prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7.\n\n3. **Find the Minimal Set of Distinct Integers**:\n   - **Option 1**: Use the prime factors directly. However, they are not all distinct.\n     \\[\n     \\{2, 2, 3, 7\\}\n     \\]\n     - **Sum**: \\(2 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 14\\)\n\n   - **Option 2**: Replace duplicate factors with the next smallest integer while maintaining distinctness.\n     - Replace one 2 with 4:\n       \\[\n       \\{2, 3, 4, 7\\}\n       \\]\n     - **Sum**: \\(2 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 16\\)\n\n4."

However, this set does not include all prime factors (missing one 2), so it's invalid.\n     - Another set like \\{2, 6, 7\\} (product \\(2 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 84\\)) has a sum of \\(2 + 6 + 7 = 15\\), which is better than 16 but still not valid because \\(6\\) is not a prime factor and the product must use distinct integers.\n\n   - **Four Numbers**:\n     - The set \\{2, 3, 4, 7\\} is valid and distinct with a product of 84 and sum 16.\n\n5. **Verify No Smaller Sum Exists**:\n   - Any attempt to split factors further (e.g., using 1) would introduce duplicates or increase the sum. For example:\n     - \\{1, 2, 3, 14\\} (product \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 14 = 84\\)) has a sum of \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 14 = 20\\), which is larger.\n     - \\{1, 6, 7, 2\\} (product \\(1 \\times 6 \\times 7 \\times 2 = 84\\)) has a sum of \\(1 + 6 + 7 + 2 = 16\\), same as before.\n\nThe minimal valid set is \\{2, 3, 4, 7\\}, giving the least possible sum of 16.\n\n\\boxed{16}"
