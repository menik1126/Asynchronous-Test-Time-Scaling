There's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the groups were split as 101 010 011 10. But when converting to octal, each group of three bits corresponds directly to an octal digit. The leftmost group (10) is only two bits, so we can pad it with a leading zero to make it three bits: 010. Wait, no, the original split was 101 010 011 10. Wait, actually, the correct grouping should be from the right. Let me re-express the binary number:\n\nOriginal binary: 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0  \nStarting from the right (the last digit is the 0th position):\n\nPositions (from right):  \n0:0, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:0, 5:0, 6:1, 7:0, 8:1, 9:0, 10:1\n\nWait, perhaps I split the groups incorrectly. Let me write the binary number again:\n\n101010"
