Let me read it again carefully.\n\n\"Let \\( P(x) \\) be a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients satisfying \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\le P(x) \\le 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\), and suppose \\( P(11) = 181 \\). Find \\( P(16) \\).\"\n\nAlright, so \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic, which means it has the general form \\( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are real coefficients that we need to find. The problem gives us two inequalities that bound \\( P(x) \\) between two other quadratics for all real \\( x \\). Additionally, we know the value of \\( P(11) = 181 \\). We're supposed to find \\( P(16) \\).\n\nFirst, let's note that both inequalities must hold for all real numbers \\( x \\). That means that for all \\( x \\), \\( P(x) \\) is sandwiched between \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) and \\( 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\).\n\nI remember that if a quadratic is always squeezed between two other quadratics, it has to be equal to one of them or a combination that fits perfectly. Since \\( P(x) \\) is quadratic, perhaps it coincides with one of these bounding quadratics for all \\( x \\). Maybe it's identical to one of them, or perhaps it's the average or something. Hmm, but quadratics are determined by three points, so unless there's more structure here, I might need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( P(x) \\) coincides with both upper and lower bounds at certain points, but since the bounds are given for all \\( x \\), maybe \\( P(x) \\) is exactly the average of the two bounds? Wait, but that would make \\( P(x) \\) a linear function, which contradicts it being quadratic. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two bounding quadratics intersect each other, and \\( P(x) \\) lies between them. Maybe the difference between them is a constant or something. Let me check.\n\nLet me compute the upper bound minus the"

So the difference between the upper and lower bounds is a perfect square, which is always non-negative. That means the upper bound is always at least the lower bound, which makes sense because the problem states that \\( P(x) \\) is between them for all real x.\n\nSo, the upper bound minus the lower bound is \\( (x -1)^2 \\). Therefore, the gap between the two bounds is exactly \\( (x -1)^2 \\). Since \\( P(x) \\) is sandwiched between them, the difference between \\( P(x) \\) and the lower bound must be less than or equal to \\( (x -1)^2 \\), and the difference between the upper bound and \\( P(x) \\) must also be non-negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( P(x) \\) is equal to the lower bound plus some multiple of the difference between the upper and lower bounds. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the lower bound as \\( L(x) = x^2 -2x +2 \\), and the upper bound as \\( U(x) = 2x^2 -4x +3 \\). Then, the difference \\( U(x) - L(x) = (x)^2 -2x +1 = (x -1)^2 \\).\n\nSo, perhaps \\( P(x) = L(x) + k(x)(x -1)^2 \\), where \\( k(x) \\) is some function between 0 and 1 for all x? But since \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, and \\( (x -1)^2 \\) is quadratic, multiplying by another function \\( k(x) \\) would require \\( k(x) \\) to be a constant to keep \\( P(x) \\) quadratic. Wait, if \\( k(x) \\) is a constant, then \\( P(x) = L(x) + k(x -1)^2 \\). Let me see.\n\nLet me suppose that \\( P(x) = L(x) + k(x -1)^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant between 0 and 1.
