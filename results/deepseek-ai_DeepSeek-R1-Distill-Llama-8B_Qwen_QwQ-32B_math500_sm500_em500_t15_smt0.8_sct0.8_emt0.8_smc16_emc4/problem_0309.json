            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 - 5x -14). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So I should start by factoring the denominator. The denominator is a quadratic, so I can try to factor it.\n\nThe denominator is x\u00b2 - 5x -14. Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14... Let's see, 2 and -7: 2*(-7) = -14, and 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect! So the denominator factors into (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the function becomes f(x) = 2x / [(x + 2)(x - 7)].\n\nSo, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7, since plugging those in makes the denominator zero and numerator at x=0, which isn't zero. So a = -2 and b = 7. Therefore, a + b = -2 + 7 = 5. Hmm, that's part of the answer.\n\nNow, for the horizontal asymptote. I think the rule depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nThe leading term of the numerator is 2x, which is degree 1, and the leading term of the denominator is x\u00b2, which is degree 2. So the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of 2 (the coefficient of x) over 1 (the coefficient of x\u00b2), which is 2/1 = 2. So y = 2 is the horizontal asymptote, meaning c = 2.\n\nSo, adding them up: a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 2 = 7. Let me just double-check if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x =7, that's correct"

            "output": " because when you factor the denominator, those are the roots. The horizontal asymptote: since the denominator's degree is higher, the horizontal asymptote should be y=0? Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nOh no! Wait a second. I thought that when the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. Let me confirm that. For example, if you have a rational function where the numerator's degree is less than the denominator's, the horizontal asymptote is at y=0. If they are equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients. If the numerator's degree is higher, then there's no horizontal asymptote (though there might be an oblique or curved asymptote).\n\nSo in this case, numerator degree is 1, denominator is 2. Since 1 < 2, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So c would be 0, not 2. Oh no, I messed that up earlier. So that changes things.\n\nSo then c is 0. Therefore, a + b + c = (-2) +7 +0 = 5. Wait, so that's different. Let me check again.\n\nThe horizontal asymptote for f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). Let me think of the behavior as x approaches infinity. The denominator grows much faster than the numerator. So as x becomes very large, the function approaches 2x / x\u00b2 = 2/x, which goes to 0. So yes, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So c is 0. So my initial thought was wrong, but upon checking, I realized that.\n\nTherefore, the correct values are a = -2, b =7, c=0. So adding them: -2 +7 is 5, plus 0 is 5. So the answer should be 5. Let me just confirm once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the leading coefficients. The leading term of the numerator is 2x, denominator is x\u00b2. So the ratio is 2x / x\u00b2 = 2/x, which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. So yes, horizontal asymptote at 0. So c is indeed 0. So the total is 5. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5. Wait, but let me check if the question"
