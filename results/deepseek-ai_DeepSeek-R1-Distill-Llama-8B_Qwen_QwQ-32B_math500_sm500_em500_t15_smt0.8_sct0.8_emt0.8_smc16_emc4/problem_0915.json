            "output": "To find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime components. \n\n84 can be factored into 2 × 2 × 3 × 7, which simplifies to 2² × 3 × 7. \n\nNext, I need to combine these prime factors into distinct integers while keeping their product equal to 84. \n\nConsidering the prime factors, one possible set is 2, 3, and 14 (since 2 × 7 = 14). The sum of these numbers is 2 + 3 + 14 = 19.\n\nTo see if a smaller sum is possible, I'll explore other combinations. Another valid set is 3, 4, and 7. Calculating the sum: 3 + 4 + 7 = 14.\n\nThis sum of 14 is less than the previous sum of 19. To confirm if there's a smaller possible sum, I'll check if there are any other valid combinations. \n\nOne more combination is 2, 6, and 7. Calculating the sum: 2 + 6 + 7 = 15.\n\nThe smallest sum found so far is 14 from the set {3, 4, 7}. I'll verify if there are any other sets with a sum less than 14.\n\nAfter evaluating different combinations, it's clear that 3, 4, and 7 provide the smallest possible sum of 14.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize 84 into Prime Factors\nFirst, we break down 84 into its prime components:\n\\[\n84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\nThis means the prime factors of 84 are 2, 3, and 7.\n\n### Step 2: Combine Prime Factors into Distinct Integers\nWe need to combine these prime factors into distinct positive integers such that their product equals 84. The goal is to find the combination with the smallest possible sum.\n\n#### Possible Combinations:\n1. **Combine 2 and 7 into 14:**\n   - Set: {2, 3, 14}\n   - Sum: \\(2 + 3 + 14 = 19\\)\n\n2. **Combine"
