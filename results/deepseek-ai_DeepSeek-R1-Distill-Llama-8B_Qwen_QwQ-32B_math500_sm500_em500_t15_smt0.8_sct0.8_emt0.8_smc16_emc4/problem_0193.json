This theorem suggests that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms \\(p/q\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is \\(-14\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(1\\).\n\nFirst, I'll list all the factors of the constant term:\n\\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14 \\).\n\nSince the leading coefficient is \\(1\\), any of these factors could be a potential integer root. I'll test each one by substituting them into the equation to see if they satisfy it.\n\nStarting with \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0\\).\nSince the result is zero, \\(x = 1\\) is indeed a root.\n\nNext, I'll test \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14 = -8\\).\nThis doesn't satisfy the equation, so \\(x = -1\\) is not a root.\n\nTesting \\(x = 2\\):\n\\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14 = 76\\).\nThe result is not zero, so \\(x = 2\\) is not a root.\n\nNext, \\(x = -2\\):\n\\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) - 14 = 16 - 40 + 36 + 2 - 14 = 0\\).\nThis equals zero, so \\(x = -2\\) is a root.\n\nMoving on to \\(x = 7\\):\n\\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - "
