It's asking for the sum of the reciprocals of \\(r_i \\overline{r_i}\\) for each pair of complex roots \\(r_i\\) and their conjugates, from \\(i=1\\) to \\(i=5\\). Hmm, okay. \n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is the square of the modulus of \\(r\\). So, the reciprocal of that would be \\(1/|r|^2\\). Therefore, the expression we're trying to find is the sum of \\(1/|r_1|^2 + 1/|r_2|^2 + \\dots + 1/|r_5|^2\\).\n\nNow, the given equation is a polynomial of degree 10. Since it's a complex polynomial, it has 10 roots (counting multiplicities), and they come in conjugate pairs because the coefficients are real. So, if \\(r\\) is a root, then \\(\\overline{r}\\) is also a root. That's why we have pairs like \\(r_1, \\overline{r_1}\\), and so on.\n\nI wonder if we can factor the polynomial or perhaps make a substitution that simplifies it. Let me see. The equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Hmm, that looks like a sum of two terms raised to the 10th power. Maybe we can factor it somehow or find some symmetry.\n\nWait, another thought. If I let \\(y = x^{5}\\), then \\(x^{10} = (x^5)^2 = y^2\\), and \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) can be thought of as \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\). But I'm not sure if that substitution helps directly. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can divide both sides by \\(x^{10}\\) to get the equation in terms of \\(1/x\\).
