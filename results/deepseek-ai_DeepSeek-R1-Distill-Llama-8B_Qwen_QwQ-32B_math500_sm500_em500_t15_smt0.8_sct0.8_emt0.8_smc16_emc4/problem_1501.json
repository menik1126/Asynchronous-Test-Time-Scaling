These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll identify which of these primes are odd. The number 2 is the only even prime, so it's excluded, leaving the odd primes: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNow, I'll count these odd primes. There are 9 in total.\n\nTherefore, the intersection contains 9 elements.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the prime numbers less than 30:**\n   The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n   \\[\n   2, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 23, \\ 29\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the odd numbers greater than zero:**\n   The set of all odd numbers greater than zero includes all odd integers starting from 1. However, when considering the intersection with prime numbers, we need to focus on the odd primes in this list.\n\n3. **Determine the intersection:**\n   - The prime number 2 is the only even prime, so it's excluded from the odd primes.\n   - The remaining primes less than 30 are all odd.\n\n   Therefore, the intersection consists of the odd primes less than 30:\n   \\[\n   3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 23, \\ 29\n   \\]\n\n4. **Count the number of elements in the intersection:**\n   There are **9** elements in the intersection.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
