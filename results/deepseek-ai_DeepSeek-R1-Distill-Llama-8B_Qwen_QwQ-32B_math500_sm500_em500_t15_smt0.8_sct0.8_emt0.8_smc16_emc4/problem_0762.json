            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. Let me try to parse it step by step. The sequence is a1, a2, a3, and so on. The problem says that for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Also, they tell me that a13 is 2016, and I need to find a1.\n\nHmm, okay. So let's break it down. First, a geometric sequence means each term after the first is multiplied by a common ratio. An arithmetic sequence means each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference. So for each k, the terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} form a geometric progression, and the next terms a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic progression.\n\nLet me denote this more formally. Let's let the common ratio be r, so in the geometric sequence, a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r and a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r = a_{2k-1} * r^2.\n\nIn the arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant, so a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}. Let me call the common difference d. So, a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = d, which implies that a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d = a_{2k} + 2d.\n\nBut wait, from the geometric sequence, we have a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r, so substituting into the arithmetic sequence, a_{2k+2} = a_{2k} + 2d, but also a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d = (a_{2k} * r) + d.

Let me subtract a_{2k} from both sides: a_{2k}*(r - 1) = d.\n\nSo, d = a_{2k}*(r - 1). But d is a common difference, so it's fixed for each k? Wait, no, for each k, we have d, but perhaps the same d applies across all k? Or maybe not? Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says for every positive integer k. So perhaps d is the same for all k? Or maybe not. Let's see.\n\nWait, but the sequence is strictly increasing, so all these terms must be increasing, so r must be greater than 1 because it's a geometric sequence, and d must be positive because it's an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo, since d = a_{2k}*(r - 1), and d is positive, that means r > 1.\n\nHmm, so for each k, the term a_{2k+1} is the next term in the geometric sequence, and a_{2k+2} is the next term in the arithmetic sequence. So perhaps we can model this as alternating between geometric and arithmetic steps, but each time linked by the same ratio and difference.\n\nThis seems a bit recursive. Maybe I can write a general term in terms of previous terms.\n\nWait, let's think about how the sequence is built. Let me try to see the pattern.\n\nStarting from a1, to get a2, we can think of it as part of a geometric sequence with a1, a2, a3. Then, from a2, a3, a4, which is an arithmetic sequence. Then from a3, a4, a5: another geometric sequence. Then from a4, a5, a6: arithmetic, and so on.\n\nSo, for each k, the terms are:\n\na_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} (geometric)\n\nand\n\na_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} (arithmetic)\n\nSo, if I fix k, let's look at the two sequences.

Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption that r1 is integer is wrong.\n\nSo, maybe r1 is rational, but then handling that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some square factors.\n\nWait, 2016=2^5 *3^2 *7^1.\n\nSo, the square factors would be 2^0,2^2,2^4 times 3^0,3^2 times 7^0.\n\nThus, possible square factors:\n\n1,\n\n2^2=4,\n\n2^4=16,\n\n3^2=9,\n\n2^2 *3^2=36,\n\n2^4*3^2=16*9=144.\n\nYes, so 1,4,9,16,36,144. So, my initial list was correct.\n\nTherefore, (6r1 -5)^2 must be one of these, so 6r1 -5 must be in {1,2,3,4,6,12}.\n\nThus, the only possible integer r1 solutions are when 6r1 -5 is an integer in that set, but as we saw, none of these yield integer r1.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption that r1 is an integer is wrong.\n\nTherefore, r1 must be a rational number greater than 1.\n\n"
