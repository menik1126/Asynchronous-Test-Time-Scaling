            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the radius of the beaker is 3 cm and its height is 8 cm, I can calculate the volume as V = π * 3² * 8 = 72π cm³.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. The radius of the spherical tank is 6 cm, so its volume is V = (4/3)π * 6³ = 288π cm³.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical tank. I'll divide the total volume of the sphere by the volume of one cylindrical beaker: 288π / 72π = 4.\n\nTherefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers of water to fill the spherical tank of radius 6 cm.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\) (radius of the beaker)\n   - \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\) (height of the beaker)\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( R = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\) (radius of the tank)\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\"
