To express this in an equation, I'll write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll simplify the left side of the equation by distributing the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) across both terms inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3x + \\frac{1}{2} \\times (-9) = x + 37\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x}{2} - \\frac{9}{2} = x + 37\n\\]\n\nNow, to eliminate the fractions, I'll multiply every term in the equation by 2:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{3x}{2} + 2 \\times \\left(-\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = 2 \\times x + 2 \\times 37\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\\]\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. I'll subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\nThen, I'll add 9 to both sides to find the value of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = 83\n\\]\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Remove the fraction by multiplying every term by 2**:\n   \n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\times (x + 37)\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying:\n   \n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to isolate \\(x\\)**:\n   \n   \\[\n   3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \n"
