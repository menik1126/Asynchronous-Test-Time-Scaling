            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many zeros are at the end of 42! That is, 42 factorial. I remember that factorials can get really big, so calculating 42! directly might not be the best approach. Instead, I think there's a mathematical trick to determine the number of trailing zeros without computing the entire factorial.\n\nHmm, trailing zeros in a number are created by multiplying 10s, right? And since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, each pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factors contributes to a trailing zero. So, the number of trailing zeros should be equal to the number of times 10 is a factor in 42!, which depends on the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in its prime factorization.\n\nBut wait, in any factorial, there are usually more 2s than 5s because even numbers contribute 2s, and 5s are less frequent. So, the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I need to count how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. How do I do that? I think there's a method where you divide 42 by 5 and take the floor of that division to count the multiples of 5. But I also remember that numbers like 25, 125, etc., contribute more than once because they have multiple factors of 5. So, I need to account for those as well.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, divide 42 by 5. 42 \u00f7 5 is 8.4, but I only care about the integer part, so that's 8. These are the numbers that are multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. So, 8 numbers contribute at least one 5.\n\nBut wait, some numbers contribute more than one 5. Specifically, numbers that are multiples of 25 (since 25 = 5\u00b2) will have two 5s. Similarly, 125 would have three, but since we're only going up to 42, 25 is the highest power here.\n\nSo, I need to count how many multiples of 25 are there in 42. 42 \u00f7 25 is about 1."

            "output": "68, so the integer part is 1. That's just 25 itself. So, that adds an extra 5.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 5s is 8 + 1 = 9. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. Let's list all the multiples of 5 up to 42:\n\n5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. That's 8 numbers. Each of these contributes at least one 5. Now, among these, 25 is 5\u00d75, so it contributes an extra 5. So, total 5s are 8 +1 =9. \n\nSimilarly, if there were a multiple of 125 (which is 5\u00b3), that would contribute another 5, but since 125 is greater than 42, we don't have to worry about that here.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 5s is 9. \n\nNow, since there are definitely more 2s than 5s in the factorial, the number of trailing zeros should be equal to the number of 5s, which is 9. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Let me recalculate:\n\nFirst step: 42 divided by 5 is 8.4 \u2192 floor to 8.\n\nSecond step: 42 divided by 25 (5 squared) is 1.68 \u2192 floor to 1.\n\nThird step: 42 divided by 125 (5 cubed) is 0.336 \u2192 floor to 0.\n\nAdding those up: 8 +1 +0 =9. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the formula is to take the floor division of n by 5, then add floor division by 25, then 125, etc., until the division yields zero. \n\nTherefore, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9. \n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should check with a smaller factorial where I know the answer. Let's take 10!.\n\n10! is 3628800, which has two trailing zeros. Let's apply the method:\n\n10 divided by 5 is 2, divided by 25 is 0."

            "output": " So, 2+0=2 trailing zeros. That matches. So the method works.\n\nAnother test: 25!.\n\n25 \u00f75=5, 25 \u00f725=1, higher powers give 0. So 5+1=6 trailing zeros. But wait, 25! is 15511210043330985984000000. Let me count the trailing zeros: The last digits are ...000000, so that's 6 zeros. So yes, correct.\n\nSo, seems reliable. Thus, for 42!, the method gives 9 trailing zeros.\n</think>\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is determined by counting the number of times 10 is a factor in its prime factorization. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of 5s determines the trailing zeros. \n\nUsing the formula:\n- Divide 42 by 5: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\)\n- Divide 42 by 25: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n- Divide 42 by 125: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\dfrac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\)\n\nSumming these gives \\(8 + 1 + 0 = 9\\) trailing zeros.\n\n**Answer:** The number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."
