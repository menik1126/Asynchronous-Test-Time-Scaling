Given that each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, I can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the number of sides by the length of one side.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, it also has a perimeter of 96 cm.\n\nA regular octagon has eight equal sides. To find the length of one side of the octagon, I divide the total perimeter by the number of sides.\n\nDividing 96 cm by 8 gives me the length of each side of the octagon, which is 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Regular Hexagon:**\n   \n   A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides. Given that each side is 16 cm, the perimeter \\( P_{\\text{hexagon}} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16\\,\\text{cm} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Perimeter of the Octagon Equal to That of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{octagon}} = P_{\\text{hexagon}} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Length of Each Side of the Octagon:**\n   \n   A regular octagon has 8 equal sides. Let \\( s \\) be the length of one side. The perimeter of the octagon is:\n   \\[\n   P_{\\text{octagon}} = 8 \\times s\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging in the known perimeter:\n   \\[\n   96\\,\\text{cm} = 8s\n   \\]\n   \n   Solve for \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{96}{8} = 12\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\,\\text{cm}}\n\\]"
