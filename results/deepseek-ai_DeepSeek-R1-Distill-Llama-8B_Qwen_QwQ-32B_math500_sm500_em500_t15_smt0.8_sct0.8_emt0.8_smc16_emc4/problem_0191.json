            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the modulus of a complex number w. Let me start by writing down what I know. The complex number z is given as z = 1 + i, and w is defined as w = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). I need to find |w|, which is the modulus of w.\n\nFirst, I remember that the modulus of a complex number a + bi is calculated as sqrt(a² + b²). But since w is a fraction involving z, I think I might need to express w in terms of z and then find its modulus.\n\nWait, maybe instead of directly computing w, I can compute the modulus of the numerator and the denominator separately and then divide them. Because I recall that the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli. So |w| should be equal to |3z + 1| divided by |5z + 7|. That sounds right. Let me write that down.\n\nSo |w| = |3z + 1| / |5z + 7|\n\nNow, I need to compute |3z + 1| and |5z + 7|. To do that, I can first compute 3z + 1 and 5z + 7 by substituting z = 1 + i.\n\nLet me compute 3z + 1 first. z is 1 + i, so 3z is 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i. Adding 1 to that gives 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i. So 3z + 1 is 4 + 3i.\n\nSimilarly, I'll compute 5z + 7. z is 1 + i, so 5z is 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i. Adding 7 to that gives 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i. So 5z + 7 is 12 + 5i.\n\nNow, I can compute the moduli of these two complex numbers. \n\nStarting with |4 + 3i|, that's sqrt(4² + 3²) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nNext, |12 + 5i| is sqrt(12² +"

Maybe I made a mistake in computing 3z + 1 or 5z + 7.\n\n3z: 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i. Adding 1: 3 + 1 = 4, 3i remains, so yes, 4 + 3i.\n\n5z: 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i. Adding 7: 5 + 7 = 12, so 12 + 5i.\n\nThen, the moduli: sqrt(4² + 3²) = 5, and sqrt(12² + 5²) = 13. So 5 divided by 13 is correct.\n\nHmm, I don't see any errors here. So the modulus of w is 5/13.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\(|w|\\), first express \\(w\\) in terms of \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{3z + 1}{5z + 7}\n\\]\n\nCompute \\(3z + 1\\) and \\(5z + 7\\) by substituting \\(z = 1 + i\\):\n\n\\[\n3z + 1 = 3(1 + i) + 1 = 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i\n\\]\n\\[\n5z + 7 = 5(1 + i) + 7 = 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i\n\\]\n\nNext, find the moduli of these results:\n\n\\[\n|3z + 1| = |4 + 3i| = \\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n|5z + 7| = |12 + 5i| = \\sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\n\\]\n\nFinally, compute \\(|w|\\):\n\n\\[\n|w| = \\frac{|3z + 1|}{|"
