The committee consists of 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.\n\nSince all members of each party must sit next to each other, I can consider the three parties as three separate blocks or units. This reduces the problem to arranging these three blocks around the table.\n\nArranging three distinct blocks around a circular table can be done in (3-1)! = 2 ways because circular permutations of n objects are (n-1)!.\n\nNext, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways, for the Republicans, also 5!, and for the Independent, there is only 1 way since there's only one person.\n\nFinally, I multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the members within each block to get the total number of seating arrangements: 2 * 5! * 5! * 1.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways the Senate committee can be seated around a circular table with the given conditions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Treat Each Party as a Single Block:**\n   - Since all members of each party must sit next to each other, we can consider each party as a single \"block\" or unit.\n   - There are 3 parties: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent. This gives us 3 blocks to arrange around the table.\n\n2. **Arranging the Blocks Around the Table:**\n   - For circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) distinct objects is \\( (n-1)! \\).\n   - Here, \\( n = 3 \\) (the number of blocks).\n   - Number of ways to arrange the blocks:\n     \\[\n     (3 - 1)! = 2!\n     \\]\n   - \\( 2! = 2 \\) ways.\n\n3. **Arranging Members Within Each Block:**\n   - Democrats: There are 5 Democrats, so they can be arranged among themselves in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n   - Republicans: Similarly, there are 5 Republicans, so they can be arranged in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n   - Independent: There is only 1 Independent, so there's only 1 way to arrange them (since one person cannot be arranged differently).\n\n4. **Calculating the Total"
