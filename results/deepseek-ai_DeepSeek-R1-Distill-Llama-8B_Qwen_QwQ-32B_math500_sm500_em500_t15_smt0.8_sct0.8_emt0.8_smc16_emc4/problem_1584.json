            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the roots of the equation \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst off, the equation looks a bit complicated because of the cubic terms on both sides. Maybe I can simplify it somehow. I remember that sometimes with symmetric equations, substituting a new variable can help. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLooking at the terms, I notice that the left side has \\((x - 3)\\) and \\((x - 7)\\). If I add 4 to 3, I get 7, so perhaps there's a relationship there. Let me denote \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). Then, the equation becomes \\(a^3 + b^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\). \n\nWait, \\(2x - 10\\) can be simplified too. If I factor out a 2, it becomes \\(2(x - 5)\\). That might be helpful. So, the right side is \\([2(x - 5)]^3\\), which is \\(8(x - 5)^3\\). \n\nSo now, the equation is \\(a^3 + b^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\\). Now, let me see if I can relate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to \\(x\\) in a way that makes this easier. Since \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\), their sum is \\(a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\\). That's exactly the same as the term inside the cube on the right side. So, \\(a + b = 2x - 10\\). \n\nInteresting, so the right side is \\((a + b)^3\\). So, we can rewrite the equation as \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\\). Let me write that out: \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\\). \n\nNow, I can expand the right-hand side to see if that simplifies things. Let's do that. \n\n\\[\n(a + b)^3 = a^3 + "
