            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet \\( P(x) \\) be a monic polynomial of degree 3. Suppose that \\( P(x) \\) has remainder \\( R(x) \\) when it's divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), and it has remainder \\( 2R(x) \\) when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\). Given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall some polynomial division concepts. When a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by another polynomial, say \\( D(x) \\), it can be expressed as \\( P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x) \\), where \\( Q(x) \\) is the quotient and \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder. The degree of \\( R(x) \\) is less than the degree of \\( D(x) \\).\n\nIn this problem, \\( P(x) \\) is divided by two different quadratics: \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) and \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\). So, for the first division by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) is of degree less than 2, which means \\( R(x) \\) is a linear polynomial, say \\( ax + b \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\), which is also linear, so \\( 2R(x) \\) is of the form \\( 2ax + 2b \\).\n\nSince \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial (degree 3) and both divisors are quadratic (degree 2), the quotient polynomials \\( Q(x) \\) in each case will be linear (degree 1).\n\nLet me write down the equations based on the polynomial division:\n\n1. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). So,\n\n\\( P(x) ="

Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), by the Remainder Theorem, we know that:\n\n\\( P(1) = R(1) \\),\n\\( P(4) = R(4) \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). So, by the Remainder Theorem again,\n\n\\( P(2) = 2R(2) \\),\n\\( P(3) = 2R(3) \\).\n\nSo, we can set up a system of equations based on these values.\n\nLet me write down these equations:\n\n1. \\( P(1) = R(1) \\)\n2. \\( P(4) = R(4) \\)\n3. \\( P(2) = 2R(2) \\)\n4. \\( P(3) = 2R(3) \\)\n\nI also know that \\( P(0) = 5 \\).\n\nAlso, since \\( R(x) = ax + b \\), let me define that:\n\n\\( R(x) = ax + b \\).\n\nSo, from equations 1 and 2:\n\n\\( P(1) = a(1) + b ="
