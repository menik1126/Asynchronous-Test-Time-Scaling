            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So it looks something like P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c. The problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we're given that P(0) = 5, and we need to find P(5).\n\nHmm, okay. So let's break this down. Since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, dividing it by a quadratic polynomial (like (x - 1)(x - 4)) will give us a linear quotient and a linear remainder. So R(x) must be of the form rx + s. Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder will also be linear, which is given as 2R(x). So, 2R(x) = 2(rx + s) = 2rx + 2s.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n1. P(x) is monic, degree 3: P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c.\n2. When P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x) = rx + s.\n3. When P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x) = 2rx + 2s.\n4. P(0) = c = 5, so c = 5. That helps.\n\nI think I can use the Remainder Theorem here. The Remainder Theorem says that if you divide a polynomial P(x) by (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But here, we're dividing by a quadratic, so the remainder R(x) is a linear polynomial, and we can express P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nand\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x),\n\nwhere Q1(x)"

P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n3. P(2) = 2R(2)\n4. P(3) = 2R(3)\n\nSince R(x) = rx + s, let's substitute this into the equations:\n\n1. P(1) = r(1) + s = r + s\n2. P(4) = r(4) + s = 4r + s\n3. P(2) = 2(r(2) + s) = 2(2r + s) = 4r + 2s\n4. P(3) = 2(r(3) + s) = 2(3r + s) = 6r + 2s\n\nSo now, we have four equations:\n\n1. P(1) = r + s\n2. P(4) = 4r + s\n3. P(2) = 4r + 2s\n4. P(3) = 6r + 2s\n\nAdditionally, we know P(0) = c = 5, so that's already given.\n\nSince P(x) is a cubic polynomial, we can write it as P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + 5. So the coefficients a, b, c are related here. But since P(0) is given, maybe we can express a, b, r, s in terms of each other.\n\nLet me compute P(1), P(2), P(3), and P(4):\n\n1.
