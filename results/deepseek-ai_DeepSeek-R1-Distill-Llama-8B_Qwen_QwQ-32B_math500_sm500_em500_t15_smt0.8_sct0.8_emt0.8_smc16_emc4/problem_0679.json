This can be modeled using the stars and bars method in combinatorics.\n\nThe general formula for distributing \\( n \\) identical items into \\( x \\) distinct groups with each group having at least \\( k \\) items is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{n - kx + k - 1}{k - 1}\n\\]\nIn this case, \\( n = 54 \\) cards, \\( k = 5 \\) cards per player, and the number of players \\( x \\) must be at least 2. \n\nSo, plugging in the values, the formula becomes:\n\\[\n\\binom{54 - 5x + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\binom{58 - 5x}{4}\n\\]\nFor the combination to be valid, the expression inside the binomial coefficient must be non-negative:\n\\[\n58 - 5x \\geq 4\n\\]\nSimplifying this inequality:\n\\[\n58 - 4 \\geq 5x \\implies 54 \\geq 5x \\implies x \\leq \\frac{54}{5} \\implies x \\leq 10.8\n\\]\nSince \\( x \\) must be an integer and at least 2, the possible values of \\( x \\) range from 2 to 10.\n\nNext, I'll verify each integer value within this range to ensure that the number of ways to distribute the cards is non-zero. Specifically, I need to check if \\( 58 - 5x \\) is greater than or equal to 4 for each \\( x \\) from 2 to 10.\n\nLet's calculate \\( 58 - 5x \\) for each \\( x \\) in the range:\n- When \\( x = 2 \\): \\( 58 - 10 = 48 \\) \u2192 Valid\n- When \\( x = 3 \\): \\( 58 - 15 = 43"

Wait, actually, the problem states that each player gets \\( y \\) cards, but the question is about possible values of \\( x \\). Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says: \"I deal all of the cards to \\( x \\) players, with each player getting \\( y \\) cards.\" So, does this mean that each player gets exactly \\( y \\) cards, or at least \\( y \\) cards? The wording says \"getting \\( y \\) cards,\" which might imply exactly \\( y \\). But the problem also mentions \"if \\( x \\) is at least 2 and \\( y \\) is at least 5\". Hmm, perhaps the problem is that each player must receive at least 5 cards, so \\( y \\geq 5 \\), and \\( x \\geq 2 \\). The total number of cards is 54, so the total number of cards must be exactly 54. Therefore, the equation is \\( x \\times y = 54 \\), but with constraints \\( x \\geq 2 \\), \\( y \\geq 5 \\).\n\nWait, that might be a different interpretation. Let me parse the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem states: \"I deal all of the cards to \\("

So \\( x \\) must be a divisor of 54, and each player gets \\( y = 54 / x \\) cards, with \\( y \\geq 5 \\). Therefore, \\( x \\) must satisfy \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( 54/x \\geq 5 \\), which implies \\( x \\leq 54/5 = 10.8 \\), so \\( x \\) can be integers from 2 to 10.\n\nIs this correct? So for each \\( x \\) in 2 to 10, as long as \\( x \\) divides 54, then \\( y = 54/x \\) will be an integer. So first, I need to find the divisors of 54 that are between 2 and 10 inclusive.\n\nLet me factorize 54: 54 = 2 \u00d7 3\u00b3. The divisors of 54 are all numbers of the form 2^a \u00d7 3^b, where a = 0 or 1, and b = 0,1,2,3.\n\nCalculating all divisors:\n\n- 2^0 \u00d7 3^0 = 1\n- 2^0 \u00d7 3^1 = 3\n- 2^0 \u00d7 3^2 = 9\n- 2^0 \u00d7 3^3 = 27\n- 2^1 \u00d7 3^0 = 2\n- 2^1 \u00d7 3^1 = 6\n- 2^1 \u00d7 3^2 = 18\n- 2^1 \u00d7 3^3 = 54\n\nSo the divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nNow, considering \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( y = 54/x \\geq 5 \\), let's see which divisors satisfy these conditions.\n\n- \\( x"

But now, interpreting the question differently, it seems like each player must receive exactly \\( y \\) cards, and \\( y \\) is at least 5, and \\( x \\) is at least 2. So, in this case, \\( x \\times y = 54 \\), with \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( y \\geq 5 \\).

It doesn't specify that each player must get exactly \\( y \\) cards, but in standard card dealing, you would deal exactly the same number of cards to each player, so each player gets the same number of cards, \\( y \\). Therefore, \\( y = 54/x \\), and \\( y \\geq 5 \\). So \\( x \\) must be a divisor of 54 and between 2 and 10.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So \\( x \\) must divide 54, and \\( y = 54/x \\geq 5 \\). Therefore, possible \\( x \\) values are 2, 3, 6, 9.\n\nBut earlier when I considered distributing with at least 5 cards per player, I thought of the stars and bars method, but that's when each player could have different numbers of cards as long as each has at least 5. However, in this case, since each player gets \\( y \\) cards, it implies that \\( y \\) is fixed, and all players get the same number.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the number of divisors of 54 that satisfy \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( 54/x \\geq 5 \\).
