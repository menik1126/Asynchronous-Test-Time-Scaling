            "output": "I need to determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order from a menu with 10 dishes, given that they refuse to order the same dish and it matters who orders what.\n\nFirst, since there are 10 dishes and each person orders one dish, I can consider this as a permutation problem because the order matters. Yann and Camille are distinct individuals, so the way they order their dishes creates different permutations.\n\nFor Yann, there are 10 possible choices. After Yann has chosen, there are 9 remaining dishes for Camille to choose from, as she cannot order the same dish as Yann.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different combinations is the product of Yann's choices and Camille's choices, which is 10 multiplied by 9, resulting in 90 different combinations.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n- **Total Dishes Available:** There are **10** different dishes on the menu.\n- **Yann and Camille Each Order One Dish:** Each person will choose one dish from the menu.\n- **No Same Dish Order:** They refuse to order the same dish.\n- **Order Matters:** Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **First, Determine Yann's Choices:**\n   - Since there are **10** dishes, Yann has **10** possible choices.\n\n2. **Next, Determine Camille's Choices:**\n   - After Yann has chosen a dish, there are **9** remaining dishes for Camille to choose from (since they refuse to order the same dish).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Combinations:**\n   - For each of Yann's choices, Camille has **9** options.\n   - So, multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has: \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are \\(\\boxed{90}\\) different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order."

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
