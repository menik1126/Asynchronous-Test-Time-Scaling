This is a problem about least common multiples, since we're dealing with repeating cycles.\n\nFirst, I'll determine the number of minutes each gear takes to complete one full rotation. The first gear turns 33 and 1/3 times per minute. Converting 1/3 of a turn into seconds might complicate things, so I'll work in minutes first.\n\nThe second gear turns 45 times per minute. To find when both gears will align again, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation intervals.\n\nI'll start by expressing the number of rotations as fractions:\n- The first gear's rotations: 33 1/3 = 100/3 rotations per minute.\n- The second gear's rotations: 45 rotations per minute.\n\nFinding the LCM of 100/3 and 45 isn't straightforward because LCM is typically used with integers. To simplify, I'll consider the number of seconds in a minute (60 seconds) and adjust the rotations accordingly.\n\nThe first gear's rotation interval in seconds: 100/3 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 200 seconds per rotation.\nThe second gear's rotation interval in seconds: 45 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 2700 seconds per rotation.\n\nNow, I'll convert the rotation intervals into whole numbers to find the LCM. Since 200 seconds is already a whole number, I'll focus on 2700 seconds.\n\nTo make both numbers an integer, I'll divide 200 by 5 to get 40 and 2700 by 5 to get 540. This gives me 40 and 540 seconds per rotation.\n\nNext, I'll find the LCM of 40 and 540. Breaking them down into prime factors:\n- 40 factors into 2^3 * 5.\n- 540 factors into 2^2 * 3^3 * 5.\n\nThe LCM is the highest power of each prime number present: 2^3 * 3^3 * 5 = 8 * 27 * 5 = 1080 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the gears will both point north again after 1080 seconds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine when the two gears will next align with their marks pointing due north, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods.

After how many seconds will the two gears next have both their marks pointing due north?\"  \n     So the answer is 720 seconds? Hmm, but let me see another approach.  \n\n6. **Alternative method using LCM of rotations per minute:**  \n   The gears need to complete an integer number of rotations.  \n   The first gear rotates at 100/3 rpm, second at 45 rpm.  \n   LCM of (100/3 and 45) rotated in the same time.  \n   To find LCM of 100/3 and 45 (in rotations per minute):  \n   LCM of rotations is LCM(100,45)/GCD(3,1)= LCM(100,45)/1.  \n   LCM(100,45)= LCM(100=2²×5², 45=3²×5)= 2²×3²×5²= 900 rotations.  \n   So the time required is LCM_rotations divided by rpm for either gear.  \n   Let's verify:  \n   For first gear: time = LCM_rotations / (rpm) = 900 / (100/3) = 27 minutes.  \n   For second gear: time = 900 /45 =20 minutes.  \n   Hmm, that would mean conflicting times. Wait, LCM should synchronize both. This suggests this method is incorrect.  \n\nAlternate approach:\n\n We need to find the smallest t (in minutes) such that:  \n (100/3)*t is integer and 45*t is integer.  \n - So (100/3)*t must be integer → 3 divides 100t → since gcd(3,100)=1, 3 divides t.  \n - 45*t must be integer → 45 divides 45t is always true.  \n Thus the smallest t is 3 minutes.  \n 3 minutes is 180 seconds."
