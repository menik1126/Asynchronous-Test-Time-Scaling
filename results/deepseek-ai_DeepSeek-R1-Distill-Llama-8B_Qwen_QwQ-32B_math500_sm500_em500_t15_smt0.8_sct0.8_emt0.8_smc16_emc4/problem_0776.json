            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). The answer should be expressed in the form √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a shouldn't be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then I need to find a + b.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. So if I have a point (x, y), the distance D from the origin (0,0) to that point is sqrt(x² + y²). Since y is given in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula.\n\nSo, substituting y, the distance D becomes sqrt(x² + [ (1/√2)(x² - 3) ]² ). Maybe I should simplify that expression first before trying to minimize it.\n\nLet me write that out: D = sqrt(x² + (1/√2)² (x² - 3)² ). Since (1/√2)² is 1/2, that simplifies to D = sqrt(x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)²). Okay, that seems manageable.\n\nNow, to find the minimum distance, I can think about minimizing D², because the square root function is monotonically increasing, so the smallest D corresponds to the smallest D². So maybe I can define f(x) = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)² and find its minimum value.\n\nLet me write that down: f(x) = x² + (1/2)(x^4 - 6x² + 9). Let me expand that: x² + (1/2)x^4 - 3x² + (9/2). Combining like terms: (1/2)x^4 - 2x² + 9/2.\n\nSo f(x) = (1/2)x^4 - 2x² + 9/2. To find the minimum of f(x), I can take its derivative and set it equal to zero.\n\nTaking the derivative: f'(x) = 2*(1/2)x^3 - 4x = x^"

So yes, f'(x) = 2x³ - 4x.\n\nSet f'(x) equal to zero: 2x³ - 4x = 0. Let's factor that: 2x(x² - 2) = 0. So, the critical points are at x = 0 and x² - 2 = 0, so x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2).\n\nNow, I should check where the function f(x) has its minimum. Since f(x) is a quartic function, it tends to infinity as x approaches positive or negative infinity, so the minima should be at these critical points.\n\nLet me compute f(x) at x = 0, x = sqrt(2), and x = -sqrt(2). Wait, since the function is even (symmetric about the y-axis because all terms are even powers), f(sqrt(2)) = f(-sqrt(2)). So I can just compute it for x = sqrt(2) and double-check.\n\nFirst, at x = 0: f(0) = 0 + 0 + 9/2 = 9/2.\n\nAt x = sqrt(2): Let's compute f(sqrt(2)).\n\nf(sqrt(2)) = (1/2)(sqrt(2))^4 - 2*(sqrt(2))^2 + 9/2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(sqrt(2))^4 = (2)^2 = 4.

            "output": " minimal value of D² is 5/2. Therefore, the minimal distance D is sqrt(5/2).\n\nWait, but the question says to express it as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is square-free. Let me see: sqrt(5/2) can be expressed as sqrt(10)/2, because sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5*2)/2 = sqrt(10)/2. So in this form, a is 10 and b is 2. Now, check if 10 is square-free. 10 factors into 2*5, neither of which is a square, so yes.\n\nTherefore, a = 10 and b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify everything again because sometimes I might make a calculation error.\n\nSo f(x) as defined is D², which is x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)^2. Expanding that: (x² - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x² + 9, so (1/2)(x^4 - 6x² + 9) is (1/2)x^4 - 3x² + 9/2. Then x² + that gives (1/2)x^4 - 2x² + 9/2.\n\nTaking derivative: d/dx of (1/2)x^4 is x^3, d/dx of -2x² is -4x, and the derivative of 9/2 is 0, so f'(x) = x^3 - 4x, correct?\n\nWait a minute, earlier I wrote f'(x) = 2x³ - 4x, but now I'm thinking maybe I missed a factor. Let me recalculate: f(x) = (1/2)x^4 - 2x² + 9/2. So when taking derivative, (1/2)*4x^3 is 2x³, and -2*2x is -4x, so yes, f'(x) is 2x³ - 4x.\n\nThen setting that equal to zero: 2x³ - 4x = 0 → 2x(x² - 2) = 0 → x=0 or x=±√2"

So (1/2)*4 = 2.\n\nThen, -2*(sqrt(2))^2: (sqrt(2))^2 is 2, so -2*2 = -4.\n\nThen +9/2. So total is 2 -4 + 4.5? Wait, 9/2 is 4.5, so 2 -4 is -2, plus 4.5 is 2.5, which is 5/2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal D squared is 5/2, so D is sqrt(5/2). To write sqrt(5/2) as sqrt(a)/b, we can rationalize the denominator:\n\nsqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) = sqrt(10)/2. So that's sqrt(10)/2, so a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b = 12. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another critical point I might have missed? The derivative was 2x³ -4x, so only three critical points. The second derivative test might confirm if it's a minimum.\n\nAlternatively, since f(x) is a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the function tends to infinity as x approaches ± infinity, so the critical point at x = sqrt(2) must be a local minimum. Since the value there is lower than at x=0, that's the global minimum.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the second derivative to confirm concavity.\n\nSecond derivative f''(x) would be derivative of f'(x) = 2x³ -4x, so f''(x) = 6x² -4.\n\nAt x = sqrt(2), f''(sqrt(2)) = 6*(2) -4 = 12 -4 = 8, which is positive, so it's a local minimum. So that's correct.\n\n"

So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be using calculus with multiple variables, but here it's single-variable as y is expressed in terms of x.\n\nAlternatively, using geometry: The graph is a parabola. The distance from the origin to a point on the parabola can be minimized. Perhaps using reflection properties or something, but the method I used seems straightforward.\n\nThus, after all that, I think the answer is 12.\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), we start by expressing the distance formula in terms of \\( x \\).
