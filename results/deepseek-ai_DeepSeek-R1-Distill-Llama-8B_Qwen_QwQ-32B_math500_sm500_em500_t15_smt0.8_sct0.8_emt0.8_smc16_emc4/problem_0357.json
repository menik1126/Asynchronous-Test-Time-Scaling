            "output": "First, let's define the variables. Let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles initially in the bag.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles. Therefore, we can express the relationship between B and Y as:\n\nB/Y = 4/3\n\nFrom this equation, we can solve for Y in terms of B:\n\nY = (3/4)B\n\nNext, we consider the change in the ratio after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles. The new ratio becomes 7:3. After the changes, the number of blue marbles becomes B + 5, and the number of yellow marbles becomes Y - 3.\n\nSo, the new ratio can be written as:\n\n(B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3\n\nWe already have Y expressed in terms of B, so let's substitute Y with (3/4)B in the equation:\n\n(B + 5)/((3/4)B - 3) = 7/3\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we'll multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator:\n\n3(B + 5) = 7((3/4)B - 3)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n3B + 15 = (21/4)B - 21\n\nTo make the equation easier, let's eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 4:\n\n12B + 60 = 21B - 84\n\nNow, let's bring all terms to one side:\n\n12B + 60 - 21B + 84 = 0\n\n-9B + 144 = 0\n\nSolving for B:\n\n-9B = -144\n\nB = 16\n\nTherefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before the changes.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\nLet:\n- \\( B \\) = initial number of blue marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = initial number of yellow marbles\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Initial Ratio**\nThe ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 4:3 \\).
