            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so that\u2019s something to keep in mind. The problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). And when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we know that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nHmm, let me break this down step by step. Since \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, its general form would be \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\), right? Because it's monic, the coefficient of \\( x^3 \\) is 1.\n\nNow, when a polynomial is divided by a quadratic divisor, say \\( (x - a)(x - b) \\), the remainder will be a linear polynomial, which we can denote as \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). So in this problem, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\), and when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\).\n\nSo let me write that out:\n\n1. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), it gives a quotient \\( Q_1(x) \\) and a remainder \\( R(x) \\). So, \\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \\).\n\n2. Similarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), it gives a quotient \\( Q_2(x) \\) and a remainder \\( 2R(x) \\). So, \\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\).\n\nSince both divisions leave remainders involving \\( R(x) \\), perhaps"

            "output": " I can set up some equations by plugging in specific values of \\( x \\) to simplify.\n\nLet me see. If I plug in \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( (x - 1) \\) becomes zero, so the first equation becomes \\( P(1) = R(1) \\). Similarly, plugging \\( x = 4 \\) into the first equation gives \\( P(4) = R(4) \\).\n\nFor the second equation, plugging in \\( x = 2 \\) gives \\( P(2) = 2R(2) \\), and plugging in \\( x = 3 \\) gives \\( P(3) = 2R(3) \\).\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- \\( P(1) = R(1) \\)\n- \\( P(4) = R(4) \\)\n- \\( P(2) = 2R(2) \\)\n- \\( P(3) = 2R(3) \\)\n\nBut I don't know \\( R(x) \\) yet. Maybe I can express \\( R(x) \\) in terms of \\( P(x) \\) evaluated at certain points.\n\nWait, another approach could be using the Remainder Factor Theorem. Since the remainder when dividing by \\( (x - a)(x - b) \\) is a linear polynomial, let's say \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). Then, from the division, we have:\n\n1. \\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + mx + n \\)\n2. \\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2(mx + n) \\)\n\nNow, since both expressions equal \\( P(x) \\), I can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\( (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + mx + n = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2mx + 2n \\)\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit complicated because we have two different quadratics multiplied by different polynomials. Maybe instead of trying to set the entire equations equal, I can consider the values of \\( R(x) \\) and relate them to \\( P(x) \\) at specific points.\n\nAnother thought: Since \\( R"
