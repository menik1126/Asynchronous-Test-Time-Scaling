            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem about polynomials, and I need to figure out how to find P(5). Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so P(x) should look like x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nIt's given that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5, and we need to find P(5).\n\nHmm, okay. So, let me recall polynomial division. When you divide a polynomial by another polynomial, say D(x), the remainder will be a polynomial of degree less than D(x). In this case, (x - 1)(x - 4) is a quadratic polynomial, so its degree is 2. Therefore, the remainder R(x) must be of degree less than 2, which means R(x) is a linear polynomial, like R(x) = mx + n.\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), which is also quadratic, the remainder is 2R(x). So, 2R(x) would be a linear polynomial as well, meaning R(x) is also determined by these conditions.\n\nWait, so R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), meaning R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so 2R(2) = P(2) - 2R(2) = 0? Wait, maybe I'm not thinking clearly.\n\nLet me try to write down the division algorithm. In general, for any polynomial P(x) and divisor D(x), we can write P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x), where the degree of R(x) is less than the degree of D(x). So, applying"

Since (x - 1)(x - 4) is degree 2, Q1(x) must be a linear polynomial (since P is degree 3, subtract 2 gives degree 1). Similarly, R(x) is linear.\n\nSecond division: P(x) = Q2(x)*(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2R(x). Here, Q2(x) is also linear, and 2R(x) is linear, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the key points here are that R(x) is the remainder when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), so R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, the remainder when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3) is 2R(x), so 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3).\n\nTherefore, we can write equations based on these values. Let me note that down.\n\nLet me denote R(x) = mx + n. Then:\n\n1. R(1) = m*1 + n = P(1)\n2. R(4) = m*4 + n = P(4)\n3. 2R(2) = 2*(2m + n) = P(2)\n4. 2R(3) = 2*(3m + n) = P(3)\n\nAlso, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, let's write it as P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + c. We know that P(0) = c = 5, so c = 5. So, P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + 5.\n\nTherefore, we can write expressions for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) in terms of a and b:\n\nP(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = (a + b + 6)\n\nP(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = (4a + 2b + 13)\n\nP(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b +"
