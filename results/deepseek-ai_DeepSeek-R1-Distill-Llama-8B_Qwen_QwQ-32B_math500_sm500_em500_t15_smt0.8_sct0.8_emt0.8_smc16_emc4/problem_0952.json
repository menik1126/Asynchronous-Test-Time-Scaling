I'll start by multiplying the numerators together and the denominators together.\n\nMultiplying the constants: 10 times 4 equals 40.\n\nMultiplying the variables: r^3 times r^6 results in r^(3+6) = r^9.\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to 40r^9.\n\nNext, I'll keep the denominator as it is for now: 8r^4.\n\nNow, the expression is 40r^9 divided by 8r^4.\n\nI can simplify the constants by dividing 40 by 8, which equals 5.\n\nFor the variables, I'll subtract the exponents since the denominator is in the lower position: r^(9-4) = r^5.\n\nCombining these results, the simplified expression is 5r^5.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators and denominators:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10 \\times 4 \\times r^3 \\times r^6}{8 \\times r^4}\n   \\]\n2. **Multiply the constants:**\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 4 = 40\n   \\]\n3. **Add the exponents of like bases in the numerator:**\n   \\[\n   r^3 \\times r^6 = r^{3+6} = r^9\n   \\]\n4. **Simplify the numerator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40r^9}{8r^4}\n   \\]\n5. **Simplify the constants:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{8} = 5\n   \\]\n6. **Subtract the exponents of like bases in the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   r^9 \\div r^4 = r^{9-4} = r^5\n   \\]\n7. **Combine the simplified constants and variables:**\n   \\[\n   5r^5\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5r^5}\n\\]"
