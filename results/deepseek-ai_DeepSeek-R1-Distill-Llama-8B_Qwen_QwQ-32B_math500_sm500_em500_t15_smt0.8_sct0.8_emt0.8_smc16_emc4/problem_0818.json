            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where \u03c9 is a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, then \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. So, the cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x\u00b3 - 1 = 0. That factors into (x - 1)(x\u00b2 + x + 1) = 0. Therefore, the roots are 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1. These roots satisfy certain properties, like 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0 and \u03c9\u00b3 = 1.\n\nSince \u03c9 is a primitive cube root of unity, it can be represented in the complex plane as e^(2\u03c0i/3) = -1/2 + i(\u221a3)/2, and \u03c9\u00b2 is e^(4\u03c0i/3) = -1/2 - i(\u221a3)/2. So, both \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2 are complex numbers with magnitude 1 and angles 120\u00b0 and 240\u00b0, respectively.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Let me try to compute each term separately.\n\nLet me denote S = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). To find S, maybe I can find a common denominator or express the terms in a way that simplifies using the properties of roots of unity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rationalize each fraction. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\), I can multiply numerator and denominator by \u03c9\u00b2 - \u03c9 + 1, which is the complex conjugate of the denominator. Wait, but is that the right approach? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since \u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u0304 (the complex conjugate of \u03c9, because |\u03c9| = 1), perhaps I can use that to simplify the expression.\n\nWait, let me recall that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so 1 + \u03c9 = -\u03c9\u00b2 and 1 +"

            "output": " \u03c9\u00b2 = -\u03c9. That might be helpful here.\n\nOh! That's a good point. Since 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, then rearranged, 1 + \u03c9 = -\u03c9\u00b2 and 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -\u03c9. Therefore, substituting these into the denominators:\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} = \\frac{1}{-\u03c9\u00b2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \u03c9\u00b2} = \\frac{1}{-\u03c9}\\). Therefore, adding them together:\n\nS = \\(\\frac{1}{-\u03c9\u00b2} + \\frac{1}{-\u03c9}\\) = - (1/\u03c9\u00b2 + 1/\u03c9).\n\nHmm, let's compute 1/\u03c9 and 1/\u03c9\u00b2. Since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, then \u03c9^{-1} = \u03c9\u00b2 and \u03c9^{-2} = \u03c9. Therefore, 1/\u03c9 = \u03c9\u00b2 and 1/\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9. So substituting back:\n\nS = - (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2). But from the equation 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, we know that \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, S = -(-1) = 1. Wait, so is that the only possible value?\n\nWait, but the question says \"find all possible values\". Since \u03c9 is a cube root of unity, but not equal to 1, so \u03c9 can be either \u03c9 or \u03c9\u00b2. But does the expression depend on which one we choose?\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose \u03c9 is the first root, then \u03c9\u00b2 is the other. But if we had taken \u03c9 as \u03c9\u00b2, then \u03c9\u00b2 would be \u03c9^4 = \u03c9^(3+1) = \u03c9^1 = \u03c9. Wait, maybe the expression is the same regardless of which root we take?\n\nLet me test with actual values. Let me compute numerically.\n\nLet me take \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) = -1/2 + i\u221a3/2. Then \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = -1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2):\n\n"

Maybe using algebraic manipulations.\n\nSince \u03c9\u00b2 = -1 - \u03c9, as we noted earlier.
