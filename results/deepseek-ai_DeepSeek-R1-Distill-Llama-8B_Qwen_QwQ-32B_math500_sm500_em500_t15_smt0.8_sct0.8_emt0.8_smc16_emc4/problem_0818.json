I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. So, the cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x³ - 1 = 0. That factors into (x - 1)(x² + x + 1) = 0. Therefore, the roots are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. These roots satisfy certain properties, like 1 + ω + ω² = 0 and ω³ = 1.\n\nSince ω is a primitive cube root of unity, it can be represented in the complex plane as e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i(√3)/2, and ω² is e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i(√3)/2. So, both ω and ω² are complex numbers with magnitude 1 and angles 120° and 240°, respectively.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Let me try to compute each term separately.\n\nLet me denote S = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). To find S, maybe I can find a common denominator or express the terms in a way that simplifies using the properties of roots of unity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rationalize each fraction. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\), I can multiply numerator and denominator by ω² - ω + 1, which is the complex conjugate of the denominator. Wait, but is that the right approach? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since ω² = ω̄ (the complex conjugate of ω, because |ω| = 1), perhaps I can use that to simplify the expression.\n\nWait, let me recall that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so 1 + ω = -ω² and 1 +"

            "output": " ω² = -ω. That might be helpful here.\n\nOh! That's a good point. Since 1 + ω + ω² = 0, then rearranged, 1 + ω = -ω² and 1 + ω² = -ω. Therefore, substituting these into the denominators:\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} = \\frac{1}{-ω²}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{1 + ω²} = \\frac{1}{-ω}\\). Therefore, adding them together:\n\nS = \\(\\frac{1}{-ω²} + \\frac{1}{-ω}\\) = - (1/ω² + 1/ω).\n\nHmm, let's compute 1/ω and 1/ω². Since ω³ = 1, then ω^{-1} = ω² and ω^{-2} = ω. Therefore, 1/ω = ω² and 1/ω² = ω. So substituting back:\n\nS = - (ω + ω²). But from the equation 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we know that ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, S = -(-1) = 1. Wait, so is that the only possible value?\n\nWait, but the question says \"find all possible values\". Since ω is a cube root of unity, but not equal to 1, so ω can be either ω or ω². But does the expression depend on which one we choose?\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose ω is the first root, then ω² is the other. But if we had taken ω as ω², then ω² would be ω^4 = ω^(3+1) = ω^1 = ω. Wait, maybe the expression is the same regardless of which root we take?\n\nLet me test with actual values. Let me compute numerically.\n\nLet me take ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2.
