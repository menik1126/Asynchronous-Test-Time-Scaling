            "output": "I need to solve the equation where the cube root of \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\) equals 16. First, I'll simplify the equation by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root.\n\nAfter cubing both sides, the equation becomes \\(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3\\). I'll calculate \\(16^3\\) which is 4096. So now the equation is \\(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\\).\n\nNext, I'll subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero: \\(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\\).\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation. I'll use the quadratic formula to solve for \\(x\\). The quadratic formula is \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = -4092\\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant: \\(b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384\\).\n\nSince the discriminant is a perfect square, the square root of 16384 is 128. Plugging this back into the formula, I get two possible solutions: \\(x = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2}\\).\n\nThis gives me \\(x = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} = 66\\) and \\(x = \\frac{4 - 128}{2} = -62\\). Since the problem asks for the positive value, the solution is \\(x = 66\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\) for the positive value of \\( x \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides:**\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n   \\]\n\n2"
