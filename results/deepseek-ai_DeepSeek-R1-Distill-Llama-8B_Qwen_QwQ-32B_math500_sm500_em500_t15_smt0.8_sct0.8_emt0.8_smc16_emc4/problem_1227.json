Let's substitute \\( n \\) with 2 (since \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\)):\n   \\[\n   (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \\times 6 \\times 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Product**:\n   \n   Compute \\( 4 \\times 6 \\times 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 = 24 \\\\\n   24 \\times 8 = 192\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Find the Remainder When 192 is Divided by 7**:\n   \n   Divide 192 by 7 to find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   192 \\div 7 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   \n  "
