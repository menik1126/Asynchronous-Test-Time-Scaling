            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the cube root of the square root of the square root of 1/729. Hmm, let me write it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the expression is \u221a(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down from the inside out. Let me start with the innermost part: \u221a(1/729). \n\nThe square root of 1 over 729. I know that the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729 is... wait, 729 is a number I recognize. Let me check: 9 squared is 81, 81 times 9 is 729, so 9 times 9 is 81, and 81 times 9 is 729. So 729 is 9^3. Oh, so \u221a729 is 9^(3/2) or 9*3 (since square root is the same as raising to the 1/2 power, and 3*(1/2) is 3/2). Wait, no, that would be if it's 729^(1/2). Actually, \u221a(729) is 27 because 27 times 27 is 729. Let me verify: 27*27 is 729, yes. So \u221a729 is 27.\n\nSo \u221a(1/729) is \u221a1 / \u221a729, which is 1 / 27. Got that part.\n\nNow, the next layer is the cube root of that. So \u221b(1/27). The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 27 is 3 because 3*3*3 is 27. So \u221b(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nMoving out to the next layer, we have the square root of 1/3. So \u221a(1/3). Hmm, that's the square root of 1 over the square root of 3, which is 1/\u221a3. But we usually rationalize the denominator. So 1/\u221a3 can be written as \u221a3/3.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with the innermost radical: \u221a(1/729). Since 1 is 1 and 729 is 9^3 or"

So \u221a(1/729) is indeed 1/27.\n\nThen the cube root of 1/27. Since 27 is 3^3, so cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then the square root of 1/3. That's \u221a(1)/\u221a3 = 1/\u221a3. But the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator, so I need to rationalize that denominator. \n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a3 gives (\u221a3)/(\u221a3 * \u221a3) = \u221a3/3. So the final simplified form is \u221a3 over 3. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this by expressing everything with exponents. Maybe that would be a better approach. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the original expression: sqrt(\u221b(sqrt(1/729))). Let me write each radical as an exponent. \n\nFirst, sqrt(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2). Then the cube root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3). Then the outer square root is [ ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) ]^(1/2). \n\nMultiplying the exponents: Let's see, starting from the inside:\n\nFirst exponent: (1/729)^(1/2). Then raising that to the 1/3 gives (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6). Then raising that to the 1/2 gives (1/729)^(1/6 * 1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12). \n\nWait, so the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)"

            "output": "^(1/12). Now, 729 is 9^3, which is 3^6 because 9 is 3^2, so 3^2^3 is 3^(2*3) = 3^6. So 729 = 3^6. Therefore, 1/729 is 3^(-6). \n\nSo (1/729)^(1/12) is (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/\u221a3. Wait, but that's the same as before, which is 1/\u221a3, and then rationalizing gives \u221a3/3. Wait, but earlier I thought the inner steps gave me a different result, but now I'm getting 1/\u221a3, which is the same as before. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step?\n\nWait, no. Let me recast the exponents step by step:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n\u221a(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))) = [ [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3) ]^(1/2).\n\nSo, the order is:\n\n1. Innermost: 1/729.\n2. Square root: (1/729)^(1/2).\n3. Cube root: [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n4. Square root again: [ (1/729)^(1/6) ]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nSo, yes, (1/729)^(1/12). Now, 1/729 is 3^(-6), so 3^(-6) raised to 1/12 is 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/\u221a3.\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to 1/\u221a3, which is equal to \u221a3/3 when rationalizing the denominator. So both methods give the same result.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did it step by step, I had the same result. So is that correct? So the answer is \u221a3/3.\n\nHmm, but another thought: Maybe I'm miscounting the number of square roots and"

So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a different way to express this. Let me see if 729 can be expressed as 3^6, so that when taking exponents, maybe there's a different path. Let me see:\n\nExpressing 1/729 as 3^(-6). Then:\n\nsqrt( cube root( sqrt(3^{-6}) ) )\n\nFirst, sqrt(3^{-6}) is (3^{-6})^{1/2} = 3^{-3}.\n\nThen cube root of that is (3^{-3})^{1/3} = 3^{-1}.\n\nThen sqrt of that is (3^{-1})^{1/2} = 3^{-1/2} = 1/\u221a3 = \u221a3/3. \n\nSame result again. So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the answer is \u221a3 over 3. \n\nI think that's correct.
