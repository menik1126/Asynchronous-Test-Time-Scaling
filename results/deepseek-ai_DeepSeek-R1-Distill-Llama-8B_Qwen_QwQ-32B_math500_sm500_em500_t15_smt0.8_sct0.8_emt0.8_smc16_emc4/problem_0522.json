            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to simplify the fraction (1 + \u221a2)/(2 + \u221a3). Hmm, I remember from algebra that when you have a denominator with a radical, one way to simplify it is by rationalizing the denominator. That means getting rid of the square root in the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.\n\nThe conjugate of (2 + \u221a3) is (2 - \u221a3), right? So I should multiply both the top and bottom by that. Let me write that down:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (2 - \u221a3):\n[(1 + \u221a2)(2 - \u221a3)] / [(2 + \u221a3)(2 - \u221a3)]\n\nNow, let me work on the denominator first because that seems simpler. Using the difference of squares formula, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. So here, a is 2 and b is \u221a3. Therefore, the denominator becomes:\n\n2\u00b2 - (\u221a3)\u00b2 = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nOh, that's nice! The denominator is just 1, which is a whole number, so that makes things easier.\n\nNow, onto the numerator: (1 + \u221a2)(2 - \u221a3). I need to multiply these two binomials. Let me do it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials:\n\nFirst: 1 * 2 = 2\nOuter: 1 * (-\u221a3) = -\u221a3\nInner: \u221a2 * 2 = 2\u221a2\nLast: \u221a2 * (-\u221a3) = -\u221a6\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to 2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6.\n\nPutting it all together, the original fraction simplifies to:\n(2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6) / 1\n\nWhich is just 2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6.\n\nBut the problem wants the answer in the form A(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD), where A, B, C, D are positive integers. So I need to rearrange my current expression to match that form.\n\nLooking at my expression: 2"

Let's see:\n\n2\u221a2 is already a single term, so maybe I can factor out something from the other terms. Wait, let me think.\n\nHmm, another approach: Let's group the terms with \u221a2 and \u221a6 together. So, 2\u221a2 - \u221a6 is part of the numerator. Then the other terms are 2 - \u221a3.\n\nBut the desired form is A(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD). So perhaps I can express 2 - \u221a3 as A - something. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's try to write the entire expression as A(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD). Let me substitute variables:\n\nA(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD) = A + A\u221aB - \u221aC - \u221aD\n\nComparing this to my simplified numerator (which is 2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6), I can set up equations:\n\nA + (A\u221aB) - \u221aC - \u221aD = 2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6\n\nSo, matching the constant terms: A = 2.\n\nThen, the \u221a2 term: A\u221aB = 2\u221a2. Since A is 2, that would mean 2\u221aB = 2\u221a2. Dividing both sides by 2: \u221aB = \u221a2. So, B = 2.\n\nNow, looking at the \u221a3 term: -\u221aC. In my expression, I have -\u221a3. So that would mean \u221aC = \u221a3, hence C = 3.\n\nSimilarly, the \u221a6 term: -\u221aD. In my expression, I have -\u221a6, so \u221aD = \u221a6. Therefore, D = 6.\n\nPutting it all together, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6. So, A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6.\n\nWait, that adds up to 13.\n\nBut wait, let me verify. Let me substitute back into the form:\n\nA(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD) = 2(1 + \u221a2) - (\u221a3 + \u221a"

So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the values are A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. Adding them up: 2+2+3+6=13.\n\nHmm, but let me double-check everything again to be sure.\n\nOriginal expression: (1 + \u221a2)/(2 + \u221a3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - \u221a3):\n\nNumerator: (1 + \u221a2)(2 - \u221a3) = 1*2 + 1*(-\u221a3) + \u221a2*2 + \u221a2*(-\u221a3) = 2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6. Correct.\n\nDenominator: (2)^2 - (\u221a3)^2 = 4 - 3 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo the simplified expression is indeed 2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6.\n\nExpressed as 2(1 + \u221a2) - (\u221a3 + \u221a6). Wait, hold on, let me see:\n\nWait, 2(1 + \u221a2) is 2 + 2\u221a2. Then subtract (\u221a3 + \u221a6), so that gives 2 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a3 - \u221a6, which is exactly the same as the expression. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6. So the sum is 2+2+3+6=13.\n\nHmm, but let me check if there's another way to represent it. For example, maybe the problem expects different groupings? Let me see.\n\nSuppose I tried to factor differently. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6. Maybe group terms as (2 + 2\u221a2) and then (-\u221a3 - \u221a6). Then factor 2 from the first group and -\u221a3 from the second?\n\nBut that would be 2(1 + \u221a2) - \u221a3(1 + \u221a"

So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor something else, but in this case, it's not straightforward. So maybe 2(1 + \u221a2) - (\u221a3 + \u221a6) is the way to go.\n\nYes, that's correct. So A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6.\n\nSo adding them together, 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 is 13.\n\nThus, I'm confident that the answer is 13.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \\((2 - \\sqrt{3})\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{4 - 3} = (1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) = 2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nRearranging the terms:\n\n\\[\n2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nExpressing this in the form \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C}+\\sqrt{D})\\):\n\n\\[\n2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(A = 2\\), \\(B = 2\\), \\(C = 3\\), and \\(D = 6\\).
