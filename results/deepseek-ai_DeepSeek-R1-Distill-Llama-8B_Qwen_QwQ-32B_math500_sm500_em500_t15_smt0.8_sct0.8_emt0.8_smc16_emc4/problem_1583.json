            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of a fraction, where the numerator is a sum of three terms, and the denominator is sqrt(5). Let me write it down to visualize better.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n\u221a[( (5 / \u221a80) + (\u221a845 / 9) + \u221a45 ) / \u221a5]\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should simplify each term in the numerator individually before adding them up. So, let's look at each term one by one.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 / \u221a80.\n\nI remember that to simplify square roots in denominators, it's usually easier to rationalize them. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \u221a80. But before that, maybe I can factor 80 into its prime factors to see if there's a square number that I can take out of the square root.\n\n80 can be factored into 16 * 5, right? And 16 is a perfect square. So,\n\n\u221a80 = \u221a(16 * 5) = \u221a16 * \u221a5 = 4\u221a5.\n\nSo, substituting back, 5 / \u221a80 becomes 5 / (4\u221a5).\n\nNow, I can rationalize this fraction by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a5:\n\n(5 * \u221a5) / (4\u221a5 * \u221a5) = (5\u221a5) / (4 * 5) = (5\u221a5) / 20.\n\nSimplifying that, I can divide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n(5\u221a5) / 20 = \u221a5 / 4.\n\nAlright, so the first term simplifies to \u221a5 / 4.\n\nMoving on to the second term: \u221a845 / 9.\n\nLet me try to simplify \u221a845. I'll factor 845 to see if there are any square factors.\n\n845 divided by 5 is 169, and 169 is 13 squared. So, 845 = 5 * 169 = 5 * 13\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, \u221a845 = \u221a(5 * 13\u00b2) = \u221a13\u00b2 * \u221a5 = 13\u221a5.\n\nSo, substituting back, \u221a845 / 9 becomes 13\u221a5 / 9.\n\nHmm, that seems simplified already.\n\nNow, the third term: \u221a45.\n\nAgain"

            "output": ", I'll factor 45. 45 is 9 * 5, and 9 is a perfect square.\n\nSo, \u221a45 = \u221a(9 * 5) = \u221a9 * \u221a5 = 3\u221a5.\n\nSo, the third term simplifies to 3\u221a5.\n\nOkay, so now the numerator of the big fraction inside the square root is:\n\n(\u221a5 / 4) + (13\u221a5 / 9) + 3\u221a5.\n\nI need to add these three terms. To add them, it might help to have a common denominator. Let's see. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (for the last term). The least common denominator (LCD) of 4, 9, and 1 is 36.\n\nSo, I'll convert each term to have 36 as the denominator.\n\nFirst term: \u221a5 / 4 = (9\u221a5) / 36.\n\nBecause 4 * 9 = 36, so I multiply numerator and denominator by 9.\n\nSecond term: 13\u221a5 / 9 = (13\u221a5 * 4) / 36.\n\nBecause 9 * 4 = 36, so multiply numerator and denominator by 4.\n\nThird term: 3\u221a5 = (3\u221a5 * 36) / 36.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Hold on, 3\u221a5 is equal to (3\u221a5 * (36/36)) = (108\u221a5)/36.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check:\n\nIf I have 3\u221a5, and I want to express it with denominator 36, I multiply numerator and denominator by (36/3) = 12.\n\nSo, 3\u221a5 = (3\u221a5 * 12)/36 = 36\u221a5 / 36.\n\nWait, but that would be 36\u221a5 / 36 = \u221a5. But 3\u221a5 is equal to \u221a5 times 3, which is 3\u221a5. So, actually, if I have 3\u221a5 * (36/36) = (3*36)\u221a5 / 36 = (108\u221a5)/36.\n\nWait, that seems wrong because (108\u221a5)/36 simplifies to 3\u221a5, which is the original. So, no, I think the approach is correct. So, 3\u221a"

Hmm, okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of 3\u221a5 as (3\u221a5)/1, so to get denominator 36, multiply numerator and denominator by 36, but that would be overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out \u221a5 first?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way. Let me see:\n\nAll terms have \u221a5, so maybe factor that out first before finding common denominators. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the numerator is:\n\n(\u221a5 / 4) + (13\u221a5 / 9) + 3\u221a5\n\nFactor out \u221a5:\n\n\u221a5 [ (1/4) + (13/9) + 3 ]\n\nNow, compute the terms inside the brackets:\n\nFirst, convert all to fractions with denominator 36.\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = (13 * 4)/36 = 52/36,\n\n3 = 3/1 = 108/36.\n\nSo adding them together:\n\n9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = (9 + 52 is 61, 61 + 108 is 169)/36.\n\nSo, the total inside the brackets is 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator becomes \u221a5 * (169/36) = (169\u221a5)/36.\n\nSo, the entire expression inside the big square root is:\n\nNumerator: (169\u221a5)/36 divided by denominator \u221a5.\n\nSo, the whole fraction is [(169\u221a5)/36] / \u221a5.\n\nDividing by \u221a5 is the same as multiplying by 1/\u221a5, so:\n\n(169\u221a5)/36 * 1/\u221a5 = (169\u221a5) / (36\u221a5).\n\nThe \u221a5 in numerator and denominator cancels out,"

Let me see if 169 and 36 have any common factors.\n\n169 is 13 squared, and 36 is 6 squared, which is 2 squared times 3 squared. So, no common factors other than 1. Therefore, 169/36 is already in its simplest form.\n\nBut let me double-check, perhaps 13 is a factor? 36 divided by 13 is not an integer, so no. So, 169/36 is the simplest form.\n\nWait, but hold on. The entire original expression was a square root of that fraction, right?\n\nSo, the expression was \u221a[( (5 / \u221a80) + (\u221a845 / 9) + \u221a45 ) / \u221a5] = \u221a(169/36).\n\nWhich would be sqrt(169/36). Since sqrt(169) is 13, and sqrt(36) is 6, so that's 13/6.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the process. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, so I had the numerator as (169\u221a5)/36 divided by \u221a5, which gives 169/36, correct? Then, the square root of 169/36 is 13/6. So, the entire expression simplifies to 13/6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final step after the numerator was 169/36 under the square root, which is 13/6, so that's a simplified fraction.\n\nSo, perhaps the final answer is 13/6.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Simplify each term in the numerator:\n\n5 / \u221a80: \u221a80 = 4\u221a5, so 5/(4\u221a5) = \u221a5/4 after rationalizing.\n\n\u221a845: 845 = 5*13\u00b2, so \u221a845 = 13\u221a5.\n\n\u221a45: \u221a45 = 3\u221a5.\n\nSo, numerator is (\u221a5 /4) + (13\u221a5 /9) + (3\u221a5).\n\n2. Factor out \u221a5: \u221a5 [1/4 + 13/9 + 3].\n\n3. Convert to common denominator 36:\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\n3"

Take the square root: sqrt(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nWait, but let me check the step where I divided by \u221a5 again. Let me write that step again.\n\nThe entire expression inside the big square root is:\n\n[ (169\u221a5)/36 ] divided by \u221a5.\n\nWhich is equal to (169\u221a5)/36 * 1/\u221a5 = (169/36)*(\u221a5 / \u221a5) = 169/36 * 1 = 169/36. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the square root of 169/36 is indeed 13/6. Since both 13 and 6 are integers and 13 is a prime number, so they have no common factors. So, 13/6 is the simplified fraction.\n\nHmm, seems like that's the answer.
