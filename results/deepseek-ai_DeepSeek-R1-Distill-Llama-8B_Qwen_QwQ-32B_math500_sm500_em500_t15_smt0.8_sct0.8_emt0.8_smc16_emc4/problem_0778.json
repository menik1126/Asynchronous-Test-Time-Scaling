Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance between two points \\((x, y)\\) and the origin \\((0, 0)\\) can be found using the distance formula. The formula is \\( D = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} \\), which simplifies to \\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Since we're looking for the smallest distance, we can minimize \\( D \\) by minimizing \\( D^2 \\), because the square root is a monotonically increasing function. So, it's easier to work with \\( D^2 \\) to avoid dealing with the square root while minimizing.\n\nGiven \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), I can substitute this into the distance formula. Let me write that out:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\)\n\nOkay, let me simplify that. First, square the y-component:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\times (x^2 - 3)^2 \\)\n\nCalculating \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\), that's \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). So, it becomes:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\)\n\nExpanding \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 \\):\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \\)\n\nSo, plugging that back in:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) = \\frac{x^4}{2} - 3x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nNow, going back to \\( D"

I need to find its critical points by differentiating with respect to x.\n\n\\( f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\frac{x^4}{2} - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\right) \\)\n\nCalculating term by term:\n\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{x^4}{2} \\) is \\( 2x^3 \\)\n- The derivative of \\( -2x^2 \\) is \\( -4x \\)\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) is 0\n\nSo, \\( f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \\)\n\nTo find critical points, set \\( f'(x) = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \\)\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n\\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \\)\n\nSet each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\( 2x = 0 \\) --> \\( x = 0 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 - 2 = 0 \\) --> \\( x^2 = 2 \\) --> \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) or \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nSo, critical points at x = 0, x = sqrt(2), and x = -sqrt(2).\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these gives the minimum distance.

No, actually sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(ab)/b, right?\n\nWait: sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nYes, so sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is"
