            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where \u03c9 is a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that if \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, then \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity, which are 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2. So, \u03c9 can be either of these two non-real roots. That means I might need to consider two cases: one where \u03c9 is a primitive cube root of unity (i.e., not equal to 1) and another case where \u03c9 = 1.\n\nWait, but if \u03c9 = 1, then the expression simplifies. Let me compute that first. If \u03c9 = 1, then the expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1^2}\\) which is \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\). So, one possible value is 1. But I think the problem is more interesting when \u03c9 is not equal to 1, so I should explore that case.\n\nNow, when \u03c9 is a primitive cube root of unity, it satisfies the equation \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0. That\u2019s a property I remember. So, I can use this to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me write down the expression again: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Maybe I can combine these two fractions into a single fraction. To do that, I need to find a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are (1 + \u03c9) and (1 + \u03c9\u00b2). So, the common denominator would be (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me compute the numerator:\n\nThe numerator is (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) = (1 + 1) + (\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9) = 2 + (\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9). But from the equation \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0, I know that \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 = -1. So, substituting that in, the numerator is 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo"

            "output": ", the combined fraction is \\(\\frac{1}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\\).\n\nNow, I need to compute the denominator: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me expand this product using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\n1*1 = 1\n\n1*\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b2\n\n\u03c9*1 = \u03c9\n\n\u03c9*\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b3\n\nSo, adding all these up: 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3. But we know that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so this becomes 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nAgain, from \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 = -1, the denominator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo, the denominator is 1, and the numerator is 1. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 1 / 1 = 1.\n\nWait, but I thought this might have two possible values, one when \u03c9 = 1 and another when \u03c9 is a primitive root. But both times I got 1. That seems odd.\n\nLet me check my work again. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nFirst case: \u03c9 = 1.\n\nExpression: \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\). That seems correct.\n\nSecond case: \u03c9 \u2260 1, so \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n[Numerator: (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9)] / [(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2)].\n\nNumerator: 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 2 - 1 = 1, since \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1.\n\nDenominator: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.\n\nSo, the expression is 1 / 1 = 1. So, regardless of whether \u03c9 is 1 or a primitive cube root, the expression equals 1. That's interesting.\n\nBut I thought maybe there would be two"

But in this case, both possibilities give the same result.\n\nIs there another perspective? Maybe using complex numbers properties or considering the roots on the unit circle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rationalize the denominators by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u03c9 - 1 or \u03c9\u00b2 - 1. Let me try that.\n\nLet me take the term \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\). If I multiply numerator and denominator by \u03c9 - 1, which is the conjugate in the field extension, then:\n\nNumerator becomes \u03c9 - 1.\n\nDenominator becomes (1 + \u03c9)(\u03c9 - 1) = \u03c9\u00b2 - 1.\n\nSimilarly, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\) can be multiplied by \u03c9\u00b2 - 1:\n\nNumerator becomes \u03c9\u00b2 - 1.\n\nDenominator becomes (1 + \u03c9\u00b2)(\u03c9\u00b2 - 1) = \u03c9\u2074 - 1. But \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so \u03c9\u2074 = \u03c9. Therefore, denominator becomes \u03c9 - 1.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\omega - 1}{\\omega\u00b2 - 1} + \\frac{\\omega\u00b2 - 1}{\\omega - 1}\\).\n\nHmm, that seems a bit more complicated, but maybe we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the minimal polynomial or the properties of cube roots of unity.\n\nI know that cube roots of unity satisfy \u03c9\u00b3 = 1 and \u03c9 \u2260 1 implies \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0.\n\nAlso, another important identity is 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0 for \u03c9 \u2260 1.\n\nWait, so if we denote S = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\), and given that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, maybe I can express the denominators in terms that relate to this.\n\nLet me consider that 1 + \u03c9 = -\u03c9\u00b2 and 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -\u03c9, since 1 + \u03c9 = -\u03c9\u00b2 and 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -\u03c9 (I can verify that: 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0 => 1 + \u03c9 = -\u03c9\u00b2 and 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -\u03c9).\n\nSo, substituting, S becomes \\(\\"

Similarly, 1/\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9.\n\nTherefore, substituting back, we have - (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nBut from the equation \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1, so this becomes -(-1) = 1.\n\nSo that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity (other than 1) we take, the expression simplifies to 1. And when \u03c9 is 1, it also gives 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nHmm, so the problem says \"find all possible values\", but it seems like the expression is always 1, regardless of which cube root of unity \u03c9 is. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but let me check with actual complex numbers. Let me plug in the actual roots.\n\nThe cube roots of unity are 1, and the other two are e^(2\u03c0i/3) and e^(4\u03c0i/3). Let me compute the expression for \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3).\n\nFirst, \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) = cos(2\u03c0/3) + i sin(2\u03c0/3) = -1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nThen, 1 + \u03c9 = 1 + (-1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + e^(4\u03c0i/3) = 1 + (-1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo, the first term is 1/(1/2 + i\u221a3/2) and the second term is 1/(1/2 - i\u221a3/2).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 divided by (1/2 + i\u221a3/2). The denominator is e^(i\u03c0/3), so reciprocal is e^(-i\u03c0/3) = cos(-\u03c0/3) + i sin"
