            "output": "To determine the value of |(1 - i)^8|, I'll start by calculating (1 - i)^2. \n\nUsing the formula for squaring a binomial: (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2, so (1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 = -1, this simplifies to 1 - 2i - 1 = -2i.\n\nNext, I'll calculate (1 - i)^4 by squaring the result of (1 - i)^2. So, (-2i)^2 = 4i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 = -1, this becomes 4 * (-1) = -4.\n\nThen, I'll compute (1 - i)^8 by squaring the result of (1 - i)^4. Thus, (-4)^2 = 16.\n\nFinally, since the absolute value of 16 is 16, the answer is 16.\n</think>\n\nRingo needs to calculate the absolute value of \\((1 - i)^8\\). Here's how he can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate \\((1 - i)^2\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   (1 - i)^2 = 1^2 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot i + i^2 = 1 - 2i + (-1) = -2i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Square the result to find \\((1 - i)^4\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   (-2i)^2 = 4i^2 = 4(-1) = -4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Square the result again to find \\((1 - i)^8\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   (-4)^2 = 16\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the absolute value:**\n   \n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = |16| = 16\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{16}\\)"
