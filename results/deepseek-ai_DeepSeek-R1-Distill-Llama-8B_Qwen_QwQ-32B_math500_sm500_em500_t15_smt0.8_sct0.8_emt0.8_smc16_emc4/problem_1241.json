Let me write it down to make it clearer.\n\nSo, the equation is:\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, my goal is to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. Since there's a square root, I remember that usually, the first step is to get rid of the square root by isolating it and then squaring both sides. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I want to subtract 4 from both sides to get the square root by itself. So:\n\nx - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nHmm, that looks better. Now, to get rid of the square root, I should square both sides of the equation. That way, the square and the square root will cancel each other out. Squaring the left side will eliminate the square root, but I need to remember to square both sides to keep the equation balanced.\n\nSo, squaring both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2\n\nAlright, let's simplify both sides. On the left side, expanding (x - 4)^2 gives me:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16\n\nAnd on the right side, squaring the square root just gives me the expression inside, so:\n\n11 - 2x\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nHmm, okay. Now, let me get all the terms on one side so that I can form a quadratic equation. I'll subtract (11 - 2x) from both sides to do that.\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 2x + 16 - 11 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nSo, now I have a quadratic equation: x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0. I need to solve for x. I can try factoring this quadratic. Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to 5"

            "output": " and add up to -6.\n\nThe factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, since the middle term is -6x, both numbers are negative. Therefore:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives:\n\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5\n\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nSo, the potential solutions are x = 5 and x = 1. But wait a second, I can't just accept both solutions right away because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions that don't actually satisfy the original equation. I need to check each solution in the original equation to make sure.\n\nLet's check x = 5 first.\n\nOriginal equation:\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nPlugging in x = 5:\n\n5 = sqrt(11 - 2*5) + 4\n\nCalculate inside the square root:\n\n11 - 10 = 1\n\nSo:\n\n5 = sqrt(1) + 4\n\nsqrt(1) is 1, so:\n\n5 = 1 + 4 => 5 = 5\n\nThat works. So x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check x = 1.\n\nPlugging in x = 1:\n\n1 = sqrt(11 - 2*1) + 4\n\nCalculate inside the square root:\n\n11 - 2 = 9\n\nSo:\n\n1 = sqrt(9) + 4\n\nsqrt(9) is 3, so:\n\n1 = 3 + 4 => 1 = 7\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense. 1 is not equal to 7. So, x = 1 is an extraneous solution. It came up when we squared both sides, but it doesn't satisfy the original equation. So, we have to discard x = 1.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps, let me go through again.\n\nOriginal equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtract 4: x - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSquare both sides: (x - 4)^2 = (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2 => x^2 - 8x"
