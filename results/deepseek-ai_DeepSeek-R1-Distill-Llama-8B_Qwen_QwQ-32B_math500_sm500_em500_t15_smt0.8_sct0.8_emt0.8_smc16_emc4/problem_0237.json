This changes his position to (0, -1/2).\n\nNext, he walks 3/4 mile east, moving along the positive x-axis. His new position is (3/4, -1/2).\n\nFinally, he walks another 1/2 mile south, moving further along the negative y-axis to (3/4, -1).\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from his starting point, we use the distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the x and y differences. \n\nCalculating this gives us sqrt((3/4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(0.5625 + 1) = sqrt(1.5625) = 1.25 miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:** Bill walks $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile south, then $\\frac{3}{4}$ mile east, and finally $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile south. How many miles is he, in a direct line, from his starting point? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Directions\n\n- **South** corresponds to the negative \\( y \\)-axis.\n- **East** corresponds to the positive \\( x \\)-axis.\n\n### Step 2: Break Down the Movements\n\n1. **First Movement: $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile south**\n   - Starting position: \\( (0, 0) \\)\n   - After moving south: \\( (0, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\)\n\n2. **Second Movement: $\\frac{3}{4}$ mile east**\n   - Starting position: \\( (0, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\)\n   - After moving east: \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\)\n\n3. **Third Movement: $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile south**\n   - Starting position: \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\)\n   - After moving south: \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, -1) \\)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Straight-Line"
