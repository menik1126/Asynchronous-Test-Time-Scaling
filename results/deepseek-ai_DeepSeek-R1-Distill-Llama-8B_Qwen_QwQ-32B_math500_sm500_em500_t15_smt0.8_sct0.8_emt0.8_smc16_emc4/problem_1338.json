Let me recall how partial fractions work. For each term of the form \\(\\frac{A}{(x - a)(x + a)}\\), it can be expressed as \\(\\frac{B}{x - a} + \\frac{C}{x + a}\\), where B and C are constants determined by solving equations.\n\nLet me try that for each term.\n\nStarting with the first term: \\(\\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x + 1)}\\).

Maybe it's better to consider each term and think about how to combine them.\n\nWait, another thought: the original equation has terms 1/(x² - n) where n is 1,2,3,4. The right side is 2010x -4. Maybe if I can manipulate the left side to express it as a function, perhaps I can make some substitution.\n\nAlternatively, think about substitution y = x². But I'm not sure if that would help here because each denominator is different.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps I can set t = x, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe consider writing each term as 1/(x² - k) = 1/(x - sqrt(k))(x + sqrt(k)). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider bringing all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\\]\n\nBut this still seems complicated.

Let me check.\n\nConsider f(y) = ln(y - 1) + ln(y - 2) + ln(y - 3) + ln(y - 4).\n\nThen, f'(y) = 1/(y - 1) + 1/(y - 2) + 1/(y - 3) + 1/(y - 4).\n\nHmm, but in our LHS, each term is k/(y - k). So, unless we have a similar derivative multiplied by something, it's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider expanding each term into partial fractions and then summing all the terms. That is, perhaps I can write the entire left side as a combination of simple fractions, each with denominators (x - a), and then combine them into a single rational function.\n\nLooking back, I had already done the partial fractions for each term. Let me rewrite the entire LHS with all the partial fractions:\n\nLHS = (1/2)/(x - 1) - (1/2)/(x + 1) + (1/√2)/(x - √2) - (1/√2)/(x + √2) + (√3/2)/(x - √3) - (√3/2)/(x + √3) + 1/(x - 2) - 1/(x + 2).\n\nSo, now, the LHS is expressed as a sum of terms with denominators (x - a) where a is 1, -1, √2, -√2, √3, -√3, 2, -2.\n\nSo, perhaps I can combine all these terms over a common denominator. But the common denominator would be the product of all these (x - a) terms, which would be a massive polynomial. That seems impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function f(x) = LHS is a rational function, and when we set f(x) equal to 2010x -4, we can consider f(x) - (2010x -4) = 0.\n\nBut again, to solve this equation, we might end up with a high-degree polynomial. However, the question is asking for the sum of all complex solutions of the equation. Hmm, perhaps I can use Vieta"
