            "output": "To compute 0.7 repeating minus 0.4 repeating plus 0.2 repeating, I first need to express each repeating decimal as a fraction.\n\nStarting with 0.7 repeating, I recognize that it's equal to 7 over 9. Similarly, 0.4 repeating is 4 over 9, and 0.2 repeating is 2 over 9.\n\nNext, I'll convert these fractions into a common denominator. Since 9 is already the denominator for all, I can work directly with these fractions.\n\nNow, I'll perform the subtraction and addition operations step by step:\nFirst, subtract 4/9 from 7/9, which gives me 3/9 or simplified to 1/3.\n\nThen, add 2/9 to 1/3. To add these, I need a common denominator, which is 9. Converting 1/3 to 3/9, adding 2/9 results in 5/9.\n\nFinally, I'll express the result as a common fraction, which is 5/9.\n</think>\n\nLet's compute the expression \\( 0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} + 0.\\overline{2} \\) by converting each repeating decimal to a fraction.\n\n1. **Convert Repeating Decimals to Fractions:**\n   - \\( 0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{9} \\)\n   - \\( 0.\\overline{4} = \\frac{4}{9} \\)\n   - \\( 0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{2}{9} \\)\n\n2. **Perform the Subtraction and Addition:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{9} - \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{9}}\n   \\]"
