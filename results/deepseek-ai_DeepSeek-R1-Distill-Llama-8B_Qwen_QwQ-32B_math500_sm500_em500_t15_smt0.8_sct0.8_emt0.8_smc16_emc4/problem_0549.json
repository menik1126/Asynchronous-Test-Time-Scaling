From the chart:\n- Brazil: 6 cents\n- France: 6 cents\n- Peru: 6 cents\n- Spain: 6 cents\n\nSince all four countries have the same price in the 70s, the total number of stamps in that decade isn't specified. However, to calculate the average, we can assume an equal number of stamps for each country, or recognize that each country contributes equally to the total cost.\n\nNext, calculate the total cost:\n- Brazil: 6 cents\n- France: 6 cents\n- Peru: 6 cents\n- Spain: 6 cents\nTotal cost for 70s stamps: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24 cents\n\nAssuming an equal distribution, there are four stamps in total. Divide the total cost by the number of stamps:\n24 cents ÷ 4 stamps = 6 cents per stamp\n\nTherefore, the average price of Juan's 70s stamps is 6 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70's** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices for Each Country in the 70's:**\n   - **Brazil:** 6 cents\n   - **France:** 6 cents\n   - **Peru:** 6 cents\n   - **Spain:** 6 cents\n\n2. **Assume the Same Number of Stamps per Country:**\n   - Since the chart does not specify the exact number of stamps per country, we'll assume that Juan has **one stamp** of each country in the 70's for simplicity.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Stamps:**\n   - Total stamps in the 70's = **4** (one from each country)\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Cost for 70's Stamps:**\n   - Total cost = (Number of stamps in 70's × Price per stamp) × Number of countries\n   - Total cost = (1 × 6 × 4) = **24** cents\n\n5. **Compute the Average Price per Stamp in the 70's:**\n   - Average price = Total cost ÷ Total number of stamps\n   - Average price = 24 ÷ 4 = **6** cents\n\n6. **"
