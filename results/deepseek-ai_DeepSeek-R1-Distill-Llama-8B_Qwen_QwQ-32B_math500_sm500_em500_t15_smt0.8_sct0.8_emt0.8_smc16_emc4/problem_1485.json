The expression inside the square root is \\(\\frac{1}{729}\\), which is a fraction. I know that \\(729\\) is a perfect square because it's \\(27^2\\). Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}\\).\n\nNext, I'll substitute this back into the original expression to get \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}}\\).\n\nNow, I'll focus on simplifying the cube root. I recognize that \\(\\frac{1}{27}\\) is a reciprocal of a perfect cube since \\(27 = 3^3\\). So, \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nReplacing this within the expression, it now becomes \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}\\).\n\nFinally, I'll simplify the square root of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). The square root of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), which has a rational denominator.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n</think>\n\nThe goal is to simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\\) and express it with a rational denominator.\n\n1. **Simplify the innermost square root:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}\n   \\]\n   \n   (Since \\(729 = 27^2\\), \\(\\sqrt{729} = 27\\)).\n\n2. **Substitute back into the original expression:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the cube root:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{1}}{\\sqrt[3]{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n"
