To do this, I'll divide the binary number into groups of three bits starting from the right.\n\nThe binary number is 10101001110. I'll separate it into groups: 101, 010, 011, 110.\n\nNext, I'll convert each of these binary groups into their corresponding octal values.\n\n- 101 in binary is equal to 5 in octal.\n- 010 in binary is equal to 2 in octal.\n- 011 in binary is equal to 3 in octal.\n- 110 in binary is equal to 6 in octal.\n\nNow, I'll combine these octal values to form the final octal number: 5 2 3 6, which becomes 5236 in octal.\n\nTherefore, the binary number 10101001110 is equal to 5236 in base eight.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide the binary number into groups of three bits starting from the right.**\n   \n   \\[\n   101\\; 010\\; 011\\; 110\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert each three-bit group from binary to octal.**\n   \n   - \\(101_2 = 5_{8}\\)\n   - \\(010_2 = 2_{8}\\)\n   - \\(011_2 = 3_{8}\\)\n   - \\(110_2 = 6_{8}\\)\n\n3. **Combine the octal values from the groups.**\n   \n   \\[\n   10101001110_2 = 5236_8\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5236_8}\n\\]"
