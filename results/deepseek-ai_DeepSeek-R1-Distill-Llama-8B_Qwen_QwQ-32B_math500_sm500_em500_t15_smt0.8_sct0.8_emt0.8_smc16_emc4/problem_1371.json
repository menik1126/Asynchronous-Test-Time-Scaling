Let \\( g \\) represent the number of girls and \\( b \\) represent the number of boys.\n\nThe total number of students is 35, so I can write the equation \\( g + b = 35 \\).\n\nNext, according to the problem, the number of girls is a multiple of 13. Therefore, \\( g \\) must be one of the following values: 13, 26, 39, and so on. However, since the total number of students is 35, \\( g \\) can't be more than 35. This means the possible values for \\( g \\) are 13 and 26.\n\nGiven that there are more girls than boys, \\( g \\) must be greater than \\( b \\). If \\( g = 13 \\), then \\( b = 35 - 13 = 22 \\). However, this would mean there are more boys than girls, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nTherefore, \\( g = 26 \\), and \\( b = 35 - 26 = 9 \\). This satisfies both conditions: the number of girls is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( g \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( b \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Given:**\n1. Total number of students = 35\n2. Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n3. There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Step 1:** Express the total number of students in terms of girls and boys.\n\\[\ng + b = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Since \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13, possible values for \\( g \\) are 13, 26, 39, etc. However, \\( g \\) must be less than or equal to 35 because the total number of students is 35. So, possible values of \\( g \\) are 13 and 26.\n\n**Step 3:** We are told there are more girls than boys. This means \\( g > b \\).\n\n- If \\( g = 13 \\):\n  \\[\n  b = 35 - 13 = 22\n  \\]\n  Here, \\( g = 13 < b = 22 \\), which contradicts"
