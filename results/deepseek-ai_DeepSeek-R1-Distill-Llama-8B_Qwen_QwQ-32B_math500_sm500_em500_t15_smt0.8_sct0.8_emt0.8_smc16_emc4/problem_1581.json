            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of (5 divided by the square root of 80 plus the square root of 845 over 9 plus the square root of 45), all divided by the square root of 5. That sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle each part of the numerator separately before dealing with the denominator and the square root. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n\u221a[(5/\u221a80 + \u221a845/9 + \u221a45) / \u221a5]\n\nAlright, so the numerator inside the big square root is three terms: 5 divided by \u221a80, \u221a845 divided by 9, and \u221a45. Then, all of that is divided by \u221a5. Then, we take the square root of the entire thing.\n\nHmm, that still looks complicated. Maybe I can simplify each square root first. I remember that to simplify square roots, I should look for factors that are perfect squares. Let's start with each term.\n\nStarting with 5/\u221a80. \u221a80 can be simplified because 80 is 16 times 5, and 16 is a perfect square. So, \u221a80 is equal to \u221a(16*5) which is \u221a16 * \u221a5, which is 4\u221a5. So, 5 divided by \u221a80 becomes 5 / (4\u221a5). That can be simplified further by rationalizing the denominator. To do that, I can multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a5: (5 * \u221a5) / (4 * 5) which simplifies to (\u221a5)/4. Okay, so the first term simplifies to \u221a5/4.\n\nNext term: \u221a845 divided by 9. Let me try to simplify \u221a845. 845 divided by 5 is 169, and 169 is 13 squared. So, 845 is 5 * 169 which is 5 * 13\u00b2. Therefore, \u221a845 is \u221a(5*13\u00b2) which is \u221a5 * \u221a13\u00b2, which is 13\u221a5. So, \u221a845 is 13\u221a5, and when we divide that by 9, it becomes (13\u221a5)/9.\n\nThird term: \u221a45. Let me simplify \u221a45. 45 is 9*5, so \u221a45 is \u221a(9*5) which is"

            "output": " 3\u221a5.\n\nNow, putting it all back into the numerator: \u221a5/4 + (13\u221a5)/9 + 3\u221a5. So, all these terms have \u221a5 in them, which is good because I can factor that out.\n\nLet me write it as \u221a5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Hmm, okay, let me compute the coefficients inside the parentheses. Let me find a common denominator to add these fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) would be 36.\n\nSo, converting each fraction:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = (13*4)/36 = 52/36\n\n3/1 = 3/1 = 108/36? Wait, no, because if the denominator is 36, then 3 is 3*36/36 which is 108/36.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right because 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, and 3 is 108/36. So, adding them together: 9 + 52 + 108 equals 169. So, the total inside the parentheses is 169/36. Therefore, the numerator becomes \u221a5 * (169/36), which is (169\u221a5)/36.\n\nSo, the entire expression inside the square root now is (169\u221a5)/36 divided by \u221a5. So, that would be [(169\u221a5)/36] / \u221a5. Dividing by \u221a5 is the same as multiplying by 1/\u221a5. So, let's write that as (169\u221a5)/36 * 1/\u221a5. The \u221a5 in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, leaving us with 169/36.\n\nNow, we have \u221a(169/36). The square root of 169 is 13, and the square root of 36 is 6. So, \u221a(169/36) is 13/6.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, does that mean the simplified fraction is 13/6? Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the top: 5/\u221a80 simplifies to \u221a5/4. Yep, because \u221a80 is 4\u221a5, so 5/(4"

So, the numerator becomes \u221a5/4 + (13\u221a5)/9 + 3\u221a5.\n\nFactoring out \u221a5: \u221a5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Let's check that: 1/4 is from \u221a5/4, 13/9 from (13\u221a5)/9, and 3 is from 3\u221a5, so yeah, that's correct.\n\nCalculating 1/4 + 13/9 + 3. Converting to 36 denominator: 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, 3 is 108/36. Adding them: 9 + 52 = 61, 61 + 108 = 169. So, 169/36. So, numerator is \u221a5*(169/36) = 169\u221a5/36.\n\nThen, divide by \u221a5: (169\u221a5/36) / \u221a5 = 169/36. Then, square root of 169/36 is 13/6. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the simplification steps correctly, especially with the square roots.\n\n\u221a80 is 4\u221a5, correct. So, 5/\u221a80 is 5/(4\u221a5) = (5\u221a5)/(4*5) = \u221a5/4. Correct.\n\n\u221a845: 845 \u00f7 5 is 169, which is 13\u00b2. So, \u221a845 is 13\u221a5. Correct.\n\n\u221a45 is 3\u221a5, correct.\n\nThen adding them: \u221a5/4 + 13\u221a5/9 + 3\u221a5. Factoring out \u221a5: \u221a5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). That's correct.\n\nCompute 1/4 + 13/9 + 3. To add these, the LCD is 36. So, 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, and 3 is 108/36. So, 9 + 52 + 108 = 169. So, 169/36. So,"
