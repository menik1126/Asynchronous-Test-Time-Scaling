            "output": "I need to simplify the given expression step by step. The expression is a square root of a fraction, which includes multiple terms in the numerator and a square root in the denominator.\n\nFirst, I'll simplify each square root in the numerator. Starting with \u221a80, I can break it down into \u221a(16*5), which simplifies to 4\u221a5. Next, for \u221a845, I'll factor it into \u221a(5*169), simplifying to 13\u221a5. Lastly, \u221a45 can be broken down into \u221a(9*5), resulting in 3\u221a5.\n\nNow, I'll substitute these simplified square roots back into the original expression. This gives me a numerator with three terms: 5/(4\u221a5), 13\u221a5/9, and 3\u221a5. \n\nTo combine these terms, I need a common denominator. The denominators present are 4\u221a5, 9, and 1. The least common multiple (LCM) of these denominators is 36\u221a5. I'll convert each term to have this common denominator. \n\nFor 5/(4\u221a5), multiplying numerator and denominator by 9 gives 45/(36\u221a5). For 13\u221a5/9, multiplying numerator and denominator by 4\u221a5 results in (52\u221a5)/(36\u221a5). Finally, for 3\u221a5, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by 36\u221a5 to get (108\u221a5)/(36\u221a5).\n\nAdding these fractions together: 45/(36\u221a5) + 52\u221a5/(36\u221a5) + 108\u221a5/(36\u221a5) equals (45 + 52\u221a5 + 108\u221a5)/ (36\u221a5). Combining like terms, this simplifies to (45 + 160\u221a5)/(36\u221a5).\n\nNext, I'll divide each term in the numerator by the denominator, which is \u221a5. This gives me 45/\u221a5 divided by 36, plus 160\u221a5/\u221a5 divided by 36. Simplifying each term, 45/\u221a5 becomes 9\u221a5, and 160\u221a5/\u221a5 simplifies to 160. \n\nNow, dividing both results by 36, the expression becomes (9\u221a5 + 160)/36. I can write this as 160/36 + 9\u221a5/36, which simplifies to 40/9"
