In this case, the coefficient of \\( y^2 \\) is positive, so the parabola opens to the right.\n\nNext, I need to find the y-intercepts. Since y-intercepts occur where \\( x = 0 \\), I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for y.\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation gives:\n\\[ 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to a quadratic equation in y:\n\\[ y^2 - 4y - 1 = 0 \\]\n\nI'll solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. The possible y-values are:\n\\[ y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\n\nThis results in two distinct real solutions for y, which means there are two y-intercepts on the graph of the parabola.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts for the graph of the parabola defined by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation Form:**\n   The given equation is a quadratic in terms of \\( y \\), meaning it's a parabola that opens either to the right or to the left.\n   \n2. **Determine the Direction the Parabola Opens:**\n   - In standard form, a parabola that opens to the right has the form \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\), where \\( a > 0 \\).\n   - Here, \\( a = 1 > 0 \\), so the parabola opens to the right.\n\n3. **Find the \\( y \\)-Intercepts:**\n   - \\( y \\)-intercepts occur where \\( x = 0 \\).\n   - Set \\( x = 0 \\)"
