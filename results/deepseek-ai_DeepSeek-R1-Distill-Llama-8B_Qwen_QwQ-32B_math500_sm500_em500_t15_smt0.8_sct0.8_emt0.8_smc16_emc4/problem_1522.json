            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\) given some sums of a sequence of positive real numbers. The problem states:\n\nLet \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\) be a sequence of positive real numbers, such that\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216.\n\\]\nI need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, I have three equations here involving the sums of the first, second, and third powers of these numbers. The variables are positive real numbers, so each \\( a_i > 0 \\).\n\nI remember that for such problems, sometimes using inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or the Power Mean inequality can be helpful. Also, sometimes assuming all the numbers are equal can give us some insight or maybe even the exact value.\n\nLet me start by considering the case where all \\( a_i \\) are equal. If that's the case, then each \\( a_i \\) would just be the total sum divided by \\( n \\). So, let me compute that.\n\nIf all \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\), then the sum of squares would be \\( n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 \\). Similarly, the sum of cubes would be \\( n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^3 \\).\n\nLet me set these equal to the given sums:\n\nFor the sum of squares:\n\\[\nn \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = 144\n\\]\nSimplifying this:\n\\[\nn \\times \\frac{9216}{n^2} = 144\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{9216}{n} = 144\n\\]\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\nn = \\frac{9216}{144} = 64\n\\]\nWait, so if all the numbers are equal, we get \\( n = 64 \\). Let me check if this value of \\( n \\) also satisfies the sum of cubes equation"

So \\( n = 64 \\) is a possible value.\n\nBut the question says \"the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\)\", which implies there might be more than one. So, I need to explore if there are other values of \\( n \\) that could satisfy those three equations.\n\nLet me think. If the numbers aren't all equal, how can the sums vary? Well, if some numbers are larger and some are smaller, the sum might remain the same, but the sum of squares and sum of cubes could change. However, in this case, the sum of squares is less than what it would be if all numbers were equal, and the sum of cubes is also less.\n\nWait, hold on, actually, if all the numbers are equal, that's often when these sums are minimized or maximized, depending on the situation. Let me check.\n\nWait, if we have more variation in the numbers, some can be larger and some smaller, but the sum of squares would increase because of the variance. Since our sum of squares is 144, which is actually less than what it would be if all numbers were equal.\n\nWait, if all numbers are equal, the sum of squares is \\( n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{96^2}{n} \\). So, when all numbers are equal, the sum of squares is \\( \\frac{9216}{n} \\). Since our given sum of squares is 144, that means \\( \\frac{9216}{n} = 144 \\), so \\( n = 64 \\). So, if the numbers aren't all equal, the sum of squares would be higher?\n\nWait, no, actually, it's the other way around. The sum of squares is minimized when all the numbers are equal. So if the numbers are not all equal, the sum of squares would be greater than 144. But in our case, the sum of squares is exactly 144, which is the minimum."

Therefore, \\( n = 64 \\) is the only possible value?\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\)\", so maybe there's another case?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider that some of the terms could be zero? Wait, but the problem states that the sequence consists of positive real numbers, so each \\( a_i > 0 \\). So, they can't be zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different configuration where some terms are different but still give the same sums?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are multiple variables with different values but arranged in such a way that the sums still hold?\n\nWait, let me think of another approach. Let me denote \\( S_1 = 96 \\), \\( S_2 = 144 \\), \\( S_3 = 216 \\).\n\nWe can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to see if there's a relationship here. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that \\( (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\dots + a_n^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + \\dots +1^2) \\geq (a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_n)^2 \\).\n\nPlugging in the given values, that would be \\( 144 \\times n \\geq 96^2 \\).\n\nCalculating the right-hand side: \\( 96^2 = 9216 \\), so:\n\n\\( 144n \\geq 9216 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 144:\n\n\\( n \\geq 9216 / 144 = 64 \\).\n\nSo, according to Cauchy-Schwarz, \\( n \\geq 64 \\). But in the case where all the terms are equal, we have equality in Cauchy-Schwarz, so that's exactly when \\( n = 64 \\). Therefore, if \\( n \\) is greater than 64, then the inequality would be strict, but in our problem, the sum of squares is exactly 144, so equality holds only when all terms are equal. Therefore, the only possible value of \\( n \\) is 64"
