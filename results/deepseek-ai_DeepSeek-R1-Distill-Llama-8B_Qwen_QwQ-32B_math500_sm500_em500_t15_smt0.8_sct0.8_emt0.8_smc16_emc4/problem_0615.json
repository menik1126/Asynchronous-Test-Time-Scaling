To do this, I'll start by finding its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I notice that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. \n\nNext, I'll divide 98 by 2 again, which results in 49. Now, 49 is not divisible by 2, so I'll move to the next prime number, which is 7. Dividing 49 by 7 gives me 7, and dividing 7 by 7 yields 1. \n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply these results, I get \\((2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 196**  \n   - Start by dividing 196 by 2:  \n     \\(196 \\div 2 = 98\\)  \n   - Divide 98 by 2 again:  \n     \\(98 \\div 2 = 49\\)  \n   - Now, divide 49 by 7:  \n     \\(49 \\div 7 = 7\\)  \n   - Finally, divide 7 by 7:  \n     \\(7 \\div 7 = 1\\)  \n   \n   So, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the Formula for the Number of Divisors**  \n   If a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of \\(p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\dots \\times p_n^{k}\\), then the total number of positive divisors is:\n   \\[\n   (a + 1) \\times (b + 1) \\times \\dots \\times (k + 1)\n   \\]\n   \n   Applying this to 196:\n   \\[\n   ("
