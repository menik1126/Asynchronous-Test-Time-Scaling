            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about a Senate committee with 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. They need to sit around a circular table, and the condition is that all members of each party must sit next to each other. Also, two seatings are considered the same if one is just a rotation of the other. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with circular arrangements, the number of linear arrangements divided by the number of positions gives the number of unique circular arrangements because rotations are considered the same. For example, if you have n people sitting in a circle, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! instead of n!.\n\nBut in this problem, there's an added twist: each party must sit together. So, it's like arranging blocks of people who must stick together. Each party forms a \"block\" or \"unit.\" So, how many blocks do we have? Well, there are three parties: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent. So that's 3 blocks.\n\nIf all these blocks can be arranged around a circular table, the number of ways to arrange them would be similar to arranging people around a circular table. But wait, each block consists of more than one person, so we need to account for the permutations within each block as well.\n\nLet me recall this concept: when you have groups that must stick together, you first arrange the groups around the table, and then multiply by the number of permutations within each group.\n\nSo, first, let's treat each party as a single entity. Since it's a circular table, the number of ways to arrange these blocks is (number of blocks -1)! So, with 3 blocks, it would be (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways. That makes sense because rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new seating.\n\nBut wait, each party has multiple members, so within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. So, for each party, we need to calculate the permutations of their members.\n\nThe Democratic block has 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republican block has 5 members, so 5! ways. The Independent is just one person, so that's only 1! =1 way. So, the total number of ways within the blocks is 5! * 5! * 1!.\n\n"

            "output": "However, there's another thing to consider: the Independent is a single person. Since they form a block of size 1, does that affect anything? Hmm, maybe not, since even a single person can be considered a block. So, the calculation should still hold.\n\nPutting it all together, the total number of arrangements would be the number of ways to arrange the blocks around the table multiplied by the permutations within each block. So that's 2! * 5! * 5!.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem mentions that the table is circular and rotations are considered the same. So, when arranging the blocks around the table, we fix one block's position to account for rotational symmetry, hence (number of blocks -1)!.\n\nBut here, the blocks are the three parties. So, yes, that's 2!.\n\nBut another thought: since the Independent is a single person, maybe the arrangement could be considered differently? Let me think. Suppose the Independent is between the two parties. Since all parties must be seated together, the Independent's block is just themselves. So, the three blocks are D, R, and I. So, arranging those three blocks around the table, considering rotations equivalent, so 2!.\n\nThen, within each block, the Democrats can be arranged in 5! ways, Republicans in 5!, and Independent in 1 way. So, multiplying all together: 2! * 5! * 5!.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that the Independent could be considered as a separate entity that might not affect the rotation? Hmm, maybe not. Since all parties must be grouped, the Independent is just another group. So, the calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of an example with smaller numbers to verify. Suppose there are two parties, each with 1 person, and an Independent. So total 3 people. Then, the number of arrangements would be (3-1)! = 2, but since each party is a single person, the blocks are each individual. Wait, but in that case, the Independent is part of a party of one. So, arranging the three blocks (each a single person) around the table would be 2! ways, and since each block has only 1 person, the total is 2. Which is correct because in a circular table with three people, there are 2 distinct"

            "output": " arrangements when considering rotations as same.\n\nBut in our case, each party has multiple people. So, the formula would still hold: (number of blocks -1)! multiplied by the permutations within each block.\n\nThus, for our problem, with 3 blocks, it's 2! * 5! * 5! * 1!.\n\nWait, so 2! is 2, 5! is 120, so 2*120*120 = 2*14400 = 28,800. Is that the answer?\n\nBut let me think again: could there be a different way to approach this problem? For example, fixing one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\nIf I fix one person's seat, say, the Independent, then the other parties can be arranged around them. Then, the Democrats and Republicans would each form blocks next to the Independent. So, how many ways can we arrange the Democrats and Republicans around the table?\n\nSince the Independent is fixed, we have two blocks left: Democrats and Republicans. The table is circular, but since the Independent is fixed, the two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways: either Democrats to the left and Republicans to the right, or vice versa.\n\nThen, within the Democratic block, the 5 people can be arranged in 5! ways, and similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements would be 2! * 5! * 5! = 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence.\n\nWait, but is there another consideration? For example, the size of each block. In circular arrangements, each person has two neighbors. If all the blocks are of different sizes, does that affect the way we count? Or is the formula still the same regardless?\n\nHmm, I think the formula is based on the number of blocks, not their sizes. So, even if the blocks are different sizes, as long as they are treated as single units, the number of arrangements is (number of blocks -1)!.\n\nIn our case, the block sizes are 5,5, and 1, but since the Independent is a separate block, it doesn't affect the count of arrangements in terms of blocks. They are just three distinct blocks.\n\nSo, I think my initial reasoning was correct.\n\nLet me also think about another"

But in our case, one party is size 1, so (3-1)! * (5!)*(5!)*(1!) which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the Independent wasn't there, so just two parties of 5 each, then the number of arrangements would be (2-1)! *5! *5! = 1 * 120 *120 = 14,400. But since we have an extra party, the Independent, which adds another block, so the number doubles to 28,800. That seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the Independent was part of one of the parties, say, a Democrat, then the total would be different, but in this case, they are separate.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 2! * 5! *5! = 28,800. So, written as \\boxed{28800}.\n\nWait, but let me check once more for possible mistakes. For instance, sometimes in circular permutations with groups, if the groups are indistinct, you have to divide further, but here the parties are distinct (Democrat, Republican, Independent), so their order matters. So, arranging the blocks D, R, I is different from R, D, I, etc. So, the 2! is correct because we fix one block's position to account for rotation, then arrange the remaining two blocks in 2!.\n\nAlternatively, if all the blocks were identical, but here they are distinct, so the count is correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake: the Independent is a single person, so when considering their block, does the arrangement require that they are between two parties? Since all members of each party must sit next to each other, the Independent must be between the two parties. Wait, actually, the three blocks can be arranged in any order around the table. So, the Independent could be between the Democrats and Republicans, or between two parties, but since there are three blocks, each block is adjacent to the other two? Wait, no, in a circular arrangement, each block is between two other blocks. So, the order is a cycle. So, the three blocks"
