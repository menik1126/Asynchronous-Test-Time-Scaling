Therefore, \\( x \\) can take integer values from 2 up to 10.\n\nTo find the number of possible values, I calculate the number of integers in this range:\n\n\\( 10 - 2 + 1 = 9 \\)\n\nThus, there are 9 possible values for \\( x \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\) when dealing 54 cards to \\( x \\) players with each player receiving at least 5 cards, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - **Total Cards:** \\( 54 \\)\n   - **Cards per Player:** \\( y \\geq 5 \\)\n   - **Number of Players:** \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n\n2. **Set Up the Inequality:**\n   Each player must receive at least 5 cards:\n   \\[\n   y \\geq 5 \\implies x \\times y \\geq 5x\n   \\]\n   Since all cards must be dealt:\n   \\[\n   5x \\leq 54\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x \\leq \\frac{54}{5} = 10.8\n   \\]\n   Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, the maximum possible value for \\( x \\) is \\( 10 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Range of \\( x \\):**\n   - The smallest possible value for \\( x \\) is \\( 2 \\).\n   - The largest possible value for \\( x \\) is \\( 10 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Possible Values:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of possible values} = 10 - 2 + 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
