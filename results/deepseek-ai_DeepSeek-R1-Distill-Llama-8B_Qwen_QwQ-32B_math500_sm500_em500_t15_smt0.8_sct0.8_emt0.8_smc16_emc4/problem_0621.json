I start by dividing 196 by 2, which gives me 98. Dividing 98 by 2 again results in 49.\n\nNext, I'll factor 49 by dividing it by 7, yielding 7. Finally, dividing 7 by 7 gives me 1.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is 2² multiplied by 7².\n\nTo find the number of positive divisors, I'll add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply these results. This means I'll take 2 (from 2²) and add 1 to get 3, and 2 (from 7²) and add 1 to get 3 as well.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply these two numbers together: 3 times 3 equals 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we can use the **prime factorization** method.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 196**:\n   \n   - **Start with the smallest prime number (2):**\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   - **Divide by 2 again:**\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Now, divide by the next prime number (7):**\n     \\[\n     49 \\div 7 = 7\n     \\]\n   - **Divide by 7 again:**\n     \\[\n     7 \\div 7 = 1\n     \\]\n   \n   So, the prime factors of 196 are \\( 2^2 \\) and \\( 7^2 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Divisors**:\n   \n   - If a number \\( N \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p^a \\times q^b \\), the total number of positive divisors is:\n     \\[\n     (a + 1) \\times (b + 1)\n     \\]\n   - Applying this to \\( 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\):\n     \\[\n     (2 + "
