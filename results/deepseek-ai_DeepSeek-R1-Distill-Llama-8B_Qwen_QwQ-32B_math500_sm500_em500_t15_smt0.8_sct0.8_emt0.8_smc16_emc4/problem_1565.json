Since the table is square, it has four sides, and each side will have 2 people seated. This means there are 8 seats in total, which matches the number of people.\n\nDue to the rotational symmetry of the square, rotating the entire arrangement does not create a new unique configuration. Therefore, I should fix one person's position to eliminate equivalent rotations.\n\nNext, I can arrange the remaining 7 people in the remaining seats. However, I must account for reflections as well since a reflection would result in an equivalent configuration. To handle this, I will consider that each arrangement is unique even when reflected.\n\nFinally, because the problem is about seating people, the order matters, so I will use factorial calculations to determine the number of permutations.\n\nBy fixing one person's position and calculating the permutations of the remaining people, I will find the total number of distinct seating arrangements considering the constraints of the square table and rotational symmetry.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table is square, meaning it has 4 sides.\n   - Each side will have exactly 2 people seated.\n\n2. **Account for Rotational Symmetry**:\n   - Since the table is square, rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new unique configuration.\n   - To eliminate rotational duplicates, fix one person's position.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Remaining Seats**:\n   - Fixing one person's position leaves 7 seats.\n   - Since each side must have 2 people, the adjacent seats to the fixed person must also be occupied, so we fix both sides relative to the fixed person.\n\n4. **Calculate the Permutations**:\n   - After fixing the positions of 3 people (the fixed person and their two adjacent seats), there are 5 remaining people to arrange in the remaining 5 seats.\n   - The number of ways to arrange 5 people in 5 seats is \\(5!\\)\n\n5. **Adjust for Reflections**:\n   - If reflections are considered the same (i.e., mirror images), we must divide by 2.

            "output": " problem, the question does not mention reflections being equivalent, so we do not divide by 2.\n\nWait, actually, let me re-examine the problem statement. It says \"Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.\" It does not mention reflections. Therefore, reflections are considered distinct. \n\nHowever, fixing one person's position already accounts for rotational symmetry. Let me correct the steps:\n\n**Revised Steps**:\n\n1. **Fix a Position to Eliminate Rotations**:\n   - Fix one person at a specific seat. Since rotations are considered the same, this reduces the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people.\n\n2. **Arrange the Remaining People**:\n   - The remaining 7 people can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways. However, since the table is square, fixing one person's position already accounts for rotational symmetry. \n\nWait, actually, in circular permutations, the formula is \\((n-1)!\\) for a circular table. But here, the table is square, but the concept is similar. However, in this case, the seats are fixed in a square with sides, so perhaps the formula is different?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of it as arranging people around a circular table with 8 seats, but divided into sides. But the key is that rotations are considered the same. \n\nWait, for a circular table with n seats, the number of distinct seating arrangements is \\((n-1)!\\). Here, the table is square, but the number of seats is 8. So, if we consider rotational symmetry, the number would be \\(7!\\). But the problem specifies that the table has 2 people per side, so maybe the sides matter in terms of labeling? \n\nWait, the problem says \"two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.\" So, rotations are considered the same. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is the same as circular permutations for 8 people, which is \\(7!\\). But wait, but the table is square, so perhaps the sides are fixed in space? \n\nWait, actually, in circular tables, the seats are not labeled, so rotations are considered the same. Here, the table is square, but the sides are not labeled either. So, rotating the table doesn't change the configuration. Therefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements is indeed \\((8-1)! = 7! = 5040"

            "output": "\\).\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something because the table is square with 2 people per side. So, the sides are fixed, but the people can be arranged in different ways on each side. However, since the entire table can be rotated, seating arrangements that can be obtained by rotation are considered the same.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is \\(7!\\).\n\nWait, but wait: if we fix one person, say, at position 1, then the remaining 7 can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways, but since the table is square, fixing one person's position already accounts for the rotational symmetry. So, the total number is \\(7!\\).\n\nHowever, I think the correct approach is to consider the circular arrangement, which is \\( (n-1)! \\). Since it's a square table, which is effectively a circular table with 8 seats, the number of distinct seating arrangements is \\(7! = 5040\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is \\(7!\\), which is 5040.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with an example.\n\nSuppose n=4 people around a square table, 1 person per side. The number of distinct arrangements is \\(3! = 6\\), since rotations are considered the same.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 people, it's \\(7! = 5040\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of ways is \\(7! = 5040\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem says 2 people on each side, so it's a different arrangement. But in terms of counting, since it's a circular table with 8 seats, the number is still \\(7!\\).\n\nSo, the answer is \\(7! = 5040\\).\n\nBut hold on, when dealing with circular tables with labeled seats, it's \\(n!\\). But when seats are unlabeled and rotations are considered the same, it's \\((n-1)!\\). Since in this problem, the table is square, but the seats are not labeled, so the number is \\(7!\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of ways is \\(7! = 5040\\).\n\nBut I remember that for circular arrangements with rotational symmetry, the formula is \\((n-1)!\\), so 7! = 5040.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, for a square table, sometimes reflections are considered the same, but in this problem, it's only rotations.

Suppose we have 8 seats around a square table. Fix one person's seat to account for rotation. The remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways. Since reflections are not considered the same, that's the total. So yes, 7!.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{5040}.\n\nBut wait, another thought: the problem says \"square table with 2 people on a side\". So each side has two people. So perhaps the arrangement is considered the same not only under rotation but also under reflection? Wait, the problem says \"Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.\" It does not mention reflections. So reflections are different. So the answer is indeed 7!.\n\nWait, but let me think of another approach. Let me think of the square table as having four sides, each with two seats. The total number of seats is 8. To count the number of seating arrangements up to rotation, we can fix one person's position, then arrange the remaining 7 people in the remaining 7 seats. Since rotations are considered the same, fixing one person's position removes rotational symmetry. The remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways. Therefore, the total number is 7!.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{5040}.\n\nHowever, I recall that sometimes when arranging people around a table with multiple seats per side, the sides can be considered as distinguishable (like a square table has four sides, but they are not labeled). Wait, but in this problem, the sides are not labeled, so rotating the table so that a different side faces north, for example, would not create a new configuration. Therefore, fixing one person's position is sufficient to account for rotations. Therefore, the answer is indeed 7!.\n\nAlternatively, if the sides were labeled (e.g., North, East, South, West), then rotations would matter, but since they are not labeled, rotations are considered the same. Therefore, the answer is 7!.\n\nYes, so the final answer is \\boxed{5040}.\n\nWait, but hold on, another way to think: the number of circular permutations for n objects is (n-1)! because fixing one and arranging the rest."
