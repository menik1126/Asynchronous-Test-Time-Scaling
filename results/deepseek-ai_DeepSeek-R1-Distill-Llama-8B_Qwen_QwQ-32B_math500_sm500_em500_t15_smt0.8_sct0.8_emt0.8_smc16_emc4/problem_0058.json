This involves multiplying the female percentage by 1.35.\n\nNext, I'll find the difference between this 135% value and the actual number of male bus riders for each grade. \n\nFinally, I'll identify the grade with the smallest absolute difference, as this indicates that the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders in that grade.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to **135%** of the female bus riders, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Data\nWe have the following table for each grade, showing the percentage of males and females who are bus riders:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\\hline\nGrade & \\textbf{Males} & \\textbf{Females} \\\\ \\hline\n9^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade} & 41.1\\% & 39.4\\% \\\\ \\hline\n10^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade} & 34.4\\% & 33.1\\% \\\\ \\hline\n11^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade} & 20.6\\% & 13.8\\% \\\\ \\hline\n12^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade} & 11.6\\% & 8.6\\% \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\]\n\n**Note:** All percentages represent the proportion of students in each grade who are bus riders.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate 135% of Female Bus Riders\nFor each grade, calculate **135%** of the female bus riders:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Female Bus Riders (135\\%)} = 1.35 \\times \\text{Female Percentage}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{For } 9^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade}: & = 1.35 \\times 39.4\\% = 53.091\\% \\\\\n\\text{For } 10^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade}: & = 1."
