            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where the area of triangle ABC is given by the formula a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2, and I need to find tan A. Hmm, let me recall some formulas related to triangles. \n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula (1/2)*base*height, but another common formula is using two sides and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A. \n\nWait, so in this case, the area is given as a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2. Let me write that down:\n\nArea = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2.\n\nI also know that the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, setting these equal:\n\na\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2 = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nOkay, so my goal is to find tan A, which is sin A / cos A. Maybe if I can find sin A and cos A separately, I can find tan A. \n\nLet me expand the left side of that equation. a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2bc - c\u00b2. Hmm, so that simplifies to (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2) + 2bc.\n\nNow, I also remember the Law of Cosines, which states that a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A. Let me rearrange that:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A => a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = -2bc*cos A.\n\nSo, substitute that back into the area equation:\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2) + 2bc = (-2bc*cos A) + 2bc = 2bc(1 - cos A).\n\nTherefore, the area can also be written as 2bc(1 - cos A). But from earlier, I also have the area as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, setting those equal:\n\n2bc(1 - cos A) = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nHmm, let me simplify this equation. First, I can divide both sides by bc, assuming b and c are not zero (which they can't be in"

So:\n\n2(1 - cos A) = (1/2) sin A.\n\nNow, let me rewrite that:\n\n2 - 2cos A = (1/2) sin A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4 - 4cos A = sin A.\n\nSo, sin A = 4 - 4cos A.\n\nNow, I have an equation involving sin A and cos A. Let me recall that sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 1. So, I can express everything in terms of either sin or cos.\n\nLet me write sin A = 4 - 4cos A and substitute that into the Pythagorean identity.\n\nSo, (4 - 4cos A)\u00b2 + cos\u00b2 A = 1.\n\nExpanding the square:\n\n(16 - 32cos A + 16cos\u00b2 A) + cos\u00b2 A = 1.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n16 - 32cos A + 17cos\u00b2 A = 1.\n\nBring 1 to the left side:\n\n16 - 32cos A + 17cos\u00b2 A - 1 = 0 => 15 - 32cos A + 17cos\u00b2 A = 0.\n\nSo, that's a quadratic in terms of cos A. Let me write it as:\n\n17cos\u00b2 A - 32cos A + 15 = 0.\n\nLet me try to solve this quadratic equation for cos A. Using the quadratic formula:\n\ncos A = [32 \u00b1 sqrt(32\u00b2 - 4*17*15)] / (2*17).\n\nCalculate discriminant D:\n\nD = 1024 - 4*17*15 = 1024 - 1020 = 4.\n\nSo, sqrt(D) = 2.\n\nTherefore,\n\ncos A = (32 \u00b1 2)/34.\n\nSo, two possibilities:\n\n1) cos A = (32 + 2)/34 = 34/34 = 1.\n\n2) cos A = (32 - 2)/34 = 30/34 = 15/17.\n\nBut cos A = 1 would imply that angle A is 0 degrees, which isn't possible in a triangle. So, we discard that solution.\n\nThus, cos A = 15/17.\n\nNow, since sin A = 4 - 4cos A (from earlier), let's compute sin A:\n\nsin A = 4 - 4*("

So, going back: expanding the area, using Law of Cosines, substituting, forming a quadratic, solving, and then computing tan A. It seems all steps check out.\n\nI think that's solid. So, tan A is 8/15.\n</think>\n\nThe area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is given by \\(a^2 - (b - c)^2\\).
