            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of the vertical asymptotes a and b, and the horizontal asymptote c, for the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 - 5x -14). Then, I have to calculate a + b + c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function equals zero, provided that the numerator doesn't also equal zero there. So, I should factor the denominator to find where it's zero.\n\nThe denominator is x\u00b2 - 5x -14. Let me try factoring that. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see: factors of -14 are (1, -14), (-1, 14), (2, -7), (-2, 7). Let me check which pair adds up to -5. 2 and -7: 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect! So, the denominator factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). So, the denominator is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x - 7 = 0, which gives x = -2 and x = 7. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7, so a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote, y = c. I recall that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The function is f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. Yes, if the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, now I have a = -2, b = 7, and c = 0. The problem asks for a + b + c. So, let's compute that: a + b = (-2) + 7 = 5, and then adding c which is"

            "output": " 0, so 5 + 0 = 5. Therefore, a + b + c equals 5.\n\nHold on, let me ensure I didn't make any mistakes. I factored the denominator correctly, right? x\u00b2 -5x -14 factors into (x + 2)(x -7). Let me multiply that back: x*x = x\u00b2, x*(-7) = -7x, 2*x = 2x, 2*(-7) = -14. So, combining like terms: -7x + 2x is -5x. Hence, x\u00b2 -5x -14. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd the horizontal asymptote: since the numerator's degree is 1 and denominator's is 2, the horizontal asymptote is indeed y=0. So, c=0 is accurate.\n\nAdding them together: -2 +7 is 5, plus 0 is still 5. That seems straightforward.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The vertical asymptotes are correct, and the horizontal asymptote is correctly identified. Thus, the final answer should be 5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first find the vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator equal to zero and factoring it. The denominator \\(x^2 - 5x - 14\\) factors into \\((x + 2)(x - 7)\\), giving vertical asymptotes at \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x = 7\\). \n\nNext, we determine the horizontal asymptote by comparing the degrees of the numerator and denominator. Since the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2), the horizontal asymptote is \\(y = 0\\).\n\nFinally, we sum the values: \\(-2 + 7 + 0 = 5\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
