Then, I have to compute the sum of each of these polynomial evaluated at 1, that is, \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) \\).\n\nAlright, let's start by looking at the given polynomial: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Hmm, it seems to be a degree 8 polynomial. I notice that it only has terms with exponents that are multiples of 4: \\( x^8, x^4 \\), and the constant term. Maybe there's a substitution I can make to simplify this.\n\nLet me try substituting \\( y = x^4 \\). Then, the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\). Wait, let me check that: If \\( y = x^4 \\), then \\( x^8 = (x^4)^2 = y^2 \\), and \\( 3x^4 = 3y \\). So, yeah, the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\).\n\nNow, I can factor this quadratic equation. Let me see, looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1: \\( 4 * (-1) = -4 \\), and \\( 4 + (-1) = 3 \\). So, that factors to \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) = 0 \\).\n\nSubstituting back, we have \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = 0 \\). So, \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). Now, I can factor each of these quartic polynomials further.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\), I recognize this as a difference of squares: \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + "

Each of these can be factored further: \\( x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) \\) and \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible over integers because it doesn't have real roots and can't be factored into polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nSo, putting that together, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Therefore, the complete factorization of the original polynomial is \\( (x^4 + 4)(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nWait, but \\( x^4 + 4 \\) isn't factored yet. Let me see if that can be factored into quadratics with integer coefficients. I remember that sometimes, when you have \\( x^4 + a^4 \\), it can be factored as \\( (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) \\). Let me try that.\n\nSo, let me assume \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) \\). Multiplying this out, we have:\n\n\\( (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) = x^4 + (2b - a^2)x^2 + b^2 \\).\n\nComparing this to \\( x^4 + 4 \\), we get the equations:\n\n1. \\( 2b - a^2 = 0 \\) (since there's no \\( x^3 \\) or \\( x \\) term)\n2. \\( b^2 = 4 \\)\n\nFrom the second equation, \\( b^2 = 4 \\), so \\( b = 2 \\) or \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nLet's try \\( b = 2 \\). Then, from the first equation, \\( 2*2 - a^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow 4 - a^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 4 \\Rightarrow a = 2 \\) or \\( a = -2 \\).\n\nSo, plugging back, if \\( a = 2 \\), we get \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)"

So, yes, \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nTherefore, the complete factorization of \\( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\) is:\n\n\\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nWait, is that all?
