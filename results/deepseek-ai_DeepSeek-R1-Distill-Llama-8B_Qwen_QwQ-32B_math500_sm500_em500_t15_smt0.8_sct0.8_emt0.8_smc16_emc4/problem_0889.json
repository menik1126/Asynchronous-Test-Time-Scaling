Since 160 is larger than 57, this will be less than 1.\n\nNext, I'll add a decimal point and zeros to 57 to continue the division. This gives me 57.00.\n\nI'll proceed with the division, determining how many times 160 fits into each part of the decimal.\n\nAfter performing the division, the decimal repeats, and I'll identify the terminating part of the decimal.\n\nFinally, I'll round the result to the appropriate number of decimal places to provide the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is 160, which can be factored into \\(16 \\times 10\\).\n   - Since 10 is one of the bases of the decimal system, the decimal will terminate after a certain number of decimal places.\n\n2. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = 0.355\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Final Answer:**\n   - The decimal terminates after three places.\n\n\\(\\boxed{0.355}\\)"
