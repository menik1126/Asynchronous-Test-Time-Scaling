            "output": "First, let's define the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay as \\( R \\). Initially, Denali is responsible for 16 dogs and Nate for 12 dogs. This gives us the ratio \\( R = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nNext, consider the scenario where Denali walks 4x more dogs. Denali's new number of dogs would be \\( 16 + 4x \\), while Nate still walks 12 dogs. The new ratio of their pay would be \\( R' = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\). For the ratio to remain the same as the original \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), we set up the equation \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nSolving this equation, multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate the denominator: \\( 16 + 4x = 16 \\). Subtracting 16 from both sides gives \\( 4x = 0 \\), which implies \\( x = 0 \\). However, the problem states that \\( x \\neq 0 \\), so this scenario doesn't help us find a valid \\( x \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the second scenario where \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. Denali's new number of dogs becomes \\( 16 + x \\), while Nate's number of dogs decreases to \\( 12 - x \\). The ratio of their pay in this case is \\( R'' = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\). For the ratio to remain \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), we set up the equation \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nSolving this equation, cross-multiply to get \\( 3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x) \\). Expanding both sides gives \\( 48 + 3x = 48 - 4x \\). Bringing like terms together, we have \\( 7x = 0 \\), which again implies \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nSince both scenarios lead to \\( x = 0 \\) and the problem specifies \\( x \\neq 0 \\), there is no valid solution for \\( x \\) that satisfies both conditions.\n</think>\n\nLet's"
