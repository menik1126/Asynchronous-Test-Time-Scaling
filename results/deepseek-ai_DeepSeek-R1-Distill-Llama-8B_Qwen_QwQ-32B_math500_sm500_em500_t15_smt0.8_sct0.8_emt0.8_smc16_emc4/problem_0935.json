            "output": "To determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), I need to find how many times 10 is a factor in the product of the numbers from 1 to 42.\n\nSince 10 is the product of 2 and 5, I will count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). However, there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros.\n\nFirst, I will count the number of 5s in the factors of \\(42!\\).\n\nNumbers from 1 to 42 divisible by 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. That's 8 numbers.\n\nNext, I will count how many times 5 appears in these numbers:\n\n- 5 contributes one 5.\n- 10 contributes one 5.\n- 15 contributes one 5.\n- 20 contributes one 5.\n- 25 contributes two 5s.\n- 30 contributes one 5.\n- 35 contributes one 5.\n- 40 contributes one 5.\n\nAdding these up, there are a total of 10 fives in the prime factors of \\(42!\\).\n\nTherefore, there are 10 trailing zeros in \\(42!\\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**:\n   - A trailing zero in a number is produced by multiplying 10. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\).\n   - There are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial, so the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros.\n\n2. **Count the Number of 5s in the Prime Factors of \\(42!\\)**:\n   - **Numbers divisible by 5 in 1 to 42**:\n     \\[\n     5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40\n     \\]\n     **Total count of numbers divisible by 5**: \\(8\\)\n   \n   - **Count the number of times 5 appears in each number**:\n     - **5,"
