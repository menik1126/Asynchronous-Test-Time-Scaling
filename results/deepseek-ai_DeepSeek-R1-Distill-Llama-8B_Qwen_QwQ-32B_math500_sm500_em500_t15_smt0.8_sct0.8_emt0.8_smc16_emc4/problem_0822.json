            "output": "Alright, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a complex number ω such that ω³ = 1. We need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. Since ω³ = 1, ω is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity: 1, and the two complex roots. Let me denote them as ω, ω², and 1. I think ω and ω² are complex conjugates of each other. So, maybe I can use that property later on.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for cube roots of unity, the sum ω + ω² + 1 = 0. That's a useful identity. Also, the product of ω and ω² is 1 because ω³ = 1, so ω * ω² = ω³ = 1.\n\nNow, let me write down the expression again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nI need to compute this sum. Maybe I can combine the two fractions into one. Let's find a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator will be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute the numerator:\n\n1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω) = (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nOkay, now I need to simplify both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 2 + ω + ω². From the identity I mentioned earlier, ω + ω² = -1. So, substituting that in, we get:\n\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to 1.\n\nNow, let's work on the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's expand this product.\n\nMultiplying the terms:\n\n1*(1) + 1*(ω²) + ω*(1) + ω*(ω²)\n\nSimplify"

Substitute that in:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nAgain, from the identity, ω + ω² = -1, so this becomes:\n\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\nWait, so the denominator also simplifies to 1. That means the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nBut hold on, I need to make sure that this holds for all cube roots of unity. Wait, we considered ω and ω², but also 1. Let me check when ω = 1.\n\nIf ω = 1, then let's compute the original expression.\n\nFirst denominator: 1 + ω = 1 + 1 = 2\nSecond denominator: 1 + ω². Wait, if ω = 1, then ω² is also 1 because 1³ = 1. So, ω² = 1 as well.\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, even when ω = 1, the expression evaluates to 1. That means regardless of which cube root of unity we take, the expression equals 1.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Is there a case where the expression might not be 1? Let me reconsider my steps because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially when there are denominators, there could be cases where the expression is undefined or behaves differently. But in this problem, ω is a cube root of unity, so ω ≠ -1 because ω³ = 1. Let's check if -1 is a cube root of unity. Well, (-1)^3 = -1 ≠ 1, so ω ≠ -1, so 1 + ω ≠ 0, and similarly 1 + ω² ≠ 0. Therefore, the denominators are safe; they don't cause any issues.\n\nSo, everything checks out. The expression simplifies neatly to 1 for all cube roots of unity ω. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me go through the steps again mentally.\n\n1."

That helps in simplifying both numerator and denominator.\n\n3. The numerator simplifies to 1, denominator also simplifies to 1, so the total is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me try substituting ω with a specific complex cube root of unity to verify.\n\nLet me take ω = e^(2πi/3), which is a primitive cube root of unity. So, ω = -1/2 + i√3/2, and ω² = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω: 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, the denominators are complex conjugates. Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n[1 * (1/2 - i√3/2)] / [(1/2 + i√3/2)(1/2 - i√3/2)]\n\nThe denominator becomes (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1.\n\nSo, the first term is (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, the second term is 1/(1/2 - i√3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (1/2 + i√3/2):\n\n[1*(1/2 + i√3/2)] / [(1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2"

So, all cases confirm that the expression is 1.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. So, the only possible value is 1.\n</think>\n\nAlright, after carefully considering and testing the problem with different cube roots of unity, I can confidently say that the expression always equals 1.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{1}"
