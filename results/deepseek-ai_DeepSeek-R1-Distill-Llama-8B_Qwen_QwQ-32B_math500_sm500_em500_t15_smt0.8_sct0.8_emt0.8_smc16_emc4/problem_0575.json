            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where a Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. They need to sit around a circular table, and all members of each party must sit next to each other. I need to figure out how many different ways they can do this, considering that two seatings are the same if one is just a rotation of the other. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, when dealing with circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange n people is usually (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But in this case, it's more complicated because the parties have to stay together. So, it's not just one group but three separate groups: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent. Each group must be seated together, which means we can think of each party as a single \"block\" or \"unit.\"\n\nSo, how many blocks do we have? Well, there are three parties: D, R, and I. That means we have three blocks. When arranging these blocks around a circular table, the number of ways to arrange k blocks is (k-1)! because rotations are considered the same. So, for three blocks, it would be (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways. But wait, that's if all the blocks are different. Are they?\n\nYes, each block represents a different party: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent. So, each of these is distinct, meaning we don't have to worry about identical blocks. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the blocks around the table is indeed 2! = 2.\n\nBut that's just the arrangement of the blocks. Within each block, the people can be arranged among themselves. So, for the Democrats, there are 5 of them, so that's 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans have 5 members, so that's another 5! ways. The Independent is just one person, so there's only 1! = 1 way to arrange them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of seating arrangements would be the number of ways to arrange the blocks multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the people within each block. That is:\n\nNumber of arrangements = (Number of ways to arrange blocks) × (Number of ways to arrange Democrats) × (Number of ways to arrange Republicans) × (Number of ways to arrange Independent"

The key points are circular arrangement with blocks and rotations considered the same.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when arranging the blocks around the table, since it's circular, fixing one block's position to account for rotational symmetry. So, instead of (3-1)! = 2, maybe that's already accounted for. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, in circular permutations, when arranging k objects, it's (k-1)! because fixing one position removes the rotational duplicates. So, with three blocks, it's indeed 2!.\n\nBut also, each block can be rotated internally. Wait, but the blocks themselves are linear arrangements. For example, the Democrats are sitting together in a block, but around a circular table, the block is actually a linear arrangement because the block is part of the circle. Wait, actually, when the blocks are arranged around the table, each block is a linear sequence because the block has a start and end. Hmm, but since the entire arrangement is circular, the blocks are placed around the table, so each block's internal arrangement is linear. Therefore, the order within each block matters from left to right (or clockwise).\n\nTherefore, the internal arrangements are indeed 5! for each party with multiple members, and 1 for the Independent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of arrangements is 2! × 5! × 5!.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me see if there's another aspect. Since the Independent is a single person, their block is just themselves. So, when arranging the blocks, the Independent's position is just a single seat, so maybe that doesn't affect anything. Hmm, no, the Independent is part of the blocks. So, the three blocks are D, R, and I. Each block is treated as a single unit, so arranging those three units around the table gives 2!.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Independent's block is considered a single unit, so the three units are D, R, and I. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: sometimes in circular arrangements with blocks, if a block is of size 1, does that affect anything? For example, if all blocks were size "

            "output": "1, the number of arrangements would just be (3-1)! = 2. So, in our case, only the Independent is a single person, the rest are blocks of 5. But regardless, all blocks are considered as units, regardless of size. So, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is (3-1)! = 2.\n\nI think that's correct. Therefore, the total number of seating arrangements is 2! × 5! × 5!.\n\nLet me compute that. 5! is 120, so 120 × 120 is 14,400. Multiply by 2, which gives 28,800.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm overcounting or undercounting somewhere. Let me consider a smaller case to test.\n\nSuppose we have 1 Democrat, 1 Republican, and 1 Independent. Then, around a circular table, how many arrangements? Well, since each person is a block of size 1, the number of block arrangements is (3-1)! = 2. Within each block, since each is size 1, there's only 1 way. So total arrangements are 2. That makes sense because around a circular table with 3 people, there are (3-1)! = 2 arrangements, which is correct.\n\nIn our problem, the blocks are treated as units regardless of their size, so the logic holds. Therefore, for the problem with 5,5,1, the total is 2! × 5! × 5!.\n\nYep, so 2 × 120 × 120 = 28,800.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the final answer is 28,800.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the three parties as three blocks: Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent. Arranging these blocks around a circular table can be done in (3-1)! = 2 ways. Within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats and Republicans, each group has 5 members, giving 5! arrangements each, and the Independent has only 1 way. Multiplying these together gives the total number of seating arrangements.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{28800}"
