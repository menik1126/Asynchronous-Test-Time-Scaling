The term \\(3^5^2\\) should be interpreted as \\(3^5\\) squared, which is \\(3^{10}\\).\n\nNext, I'll rewrite the equation with the corrected exponent: \\(3^{10} - 4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63\\).\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply every term in the equation by 3: \\(3 \\times 3^{10} - 12(5 - a)^2 = 189\\).\n\nSimplifying \\(3 \\times 3^{10}\\) gives \\(3^{11}\\), so the equation becomes: \\(3^{11} - 12(5 - a)^2 = 189\\).\n\nI'll move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero: \\(3^{11} - 189 = 12(5 - a)^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(3^{11}\\) results in 177147. Substituting this value in, the equation becomes: \\(177147 - 189 = 12(5 - a)^2\\).\n\nSimplifying \\(177147 - 189\\) gives 176958. So, the equation is now: \\(176958 = 12(5 - a)^2\\).\n\nTo isolate \\((5 - a)^2\\), I'll divide both sides by 12: \\(\\frac{176958}{12} = (5 - a)^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\frac{176958}{12}\\) gives 14749. So, the equation is: \\(14749 = (5 - a)^2\\).\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, I get \\(5 - a = \\pm\\sqrt{14749}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{14749}\\) is approximately 121.26, the solutions for \\(a\\) are: \\(5 - a = 121.26\\) and \\(5 - a = -121.26\\).\n\nSolving for \\(a\\) in both cases: \\(a = 5 - 121.26 = -116.26\\) and \\(a = 5 + 121.26 = 126.26\\).\n\nFinally, adding the two values of \\(a"
