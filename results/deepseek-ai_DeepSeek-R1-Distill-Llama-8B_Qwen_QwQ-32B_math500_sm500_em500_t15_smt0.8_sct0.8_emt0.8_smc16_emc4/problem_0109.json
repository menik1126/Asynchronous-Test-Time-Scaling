            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the product CD given that the sum of two fractions equals another fraction. The equation is:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\]\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have two fractions with different denominators and you want to combine them, you need a common denominator. The denominators here are (x - 3) and (x + 8), so the common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, to add the two fractions on the left, I can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator. That means I'll multiply the first fraction by (x + 8)/(x + 8) and the second fraction by (x - 3)/(x - 3). Let me do that step by step.\n\nStarting with the left side:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\]\n\nNow, the right side of the equation is already a single fraction with denominator (x\u00b2 + 5x - 24). Let me factor that denominator to make sure it's consistent with the common denominator I found. Let's factor x\u00b2 + 5x - 24.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3? Because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, yes, the denominator factors into (x + 8)(x - 3). That matches the common denominator I had earlier, which is good.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\]\n\nSince the denominators are equal, the numerators must be equal as well. So I can set the numerators equal to each other:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3)"

            "output": " = 4x - 23\n\nNow, I need to find the values of C and D that satisfy this equation for all x except -8 and 3. Since this equation is valid for all real x except those excluded values, the coefficients of like terms must be equal on both sides.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, let's set the coefficients of x equal and the constant terms equal:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nSo now I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. C + D = 4\n2. 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve for C and D. Let me use the substitution method. From the first equation, I can express D in terms of C:\n\nD = 4 - C\n\nNow, substitute D into the second equation:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. It should be 8C - 3*(4 - C). So, 8C - 12 + 3C? Wait, no, the distributive property: 8C - (3*4) + (3*C) = 8C - 12 + 3C. Yes, that's correct.\n\nCombine like terms (8C + 3C) = 11C:\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -23 + 12 = -11\n\nSo, C = -11 / 11 = -1\n\nNow that I have C = -1, substitute back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nNow, the question asks for the product CD. Let me compute that:\n\nCD = (-1)"

Let me plug back into the original equation to see if it works.\n\nLeft side: C/(x -3) + D/(x +8) = (-1)/(x -3) + 5/(x +8)\n\nCombine them: [ -1(x +8) + 5(x -3) ] / (x -3)(x +8)\n\nCompute numerator: -x -8 + 5x -15 = ( -x +5x ) + ( -8 -15 ) = 4x -23\n\nWhich is the same as the right side numerator: 4x -23\n\nSo, yes, the equation holds.
