            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is closer to the center \\(O\\) than to any of the four vertices. The rectangle has its center at \\(O\\) and the ratio of \\(AB\\) to \\(AD\\) is \\(k\\). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the rectangle. Since \\(O\\) is the center, it's located exactly in the middle of the rectangle. Let me denote the rectangle's length and width. Let's say \\(AB = 2a\\) and \\(AD = 2b\\). This way, the center \\(O\\) will be at the origin \\((0,0)\\) if I consider the rectangle centered there. So, the vertices will be at points \\((-a, b)\\), \\((a, b)\\), \\((a, -b)\\), and \\((-a, -b)\\). I think this coordinate system might help me work through the problem algebraically.\n\nGiven that \\(AB/AD = k\\), and since \\(AB = 2a\\) and \\(AD = 2b\\), we have \\( (2a)/(2b) = k \\), which simplifies to \\( a/b = k/2 \\). So, \\(a = (k/2)b\\). That's a useful relationship because it connects the lengths of the sides through the ratio \\(k\\).\n\nNow, the main question is about the probability. Probability, in general, is calculated as the area of the desired region divided by the area of the total region. In this case, the desired region is all points inside the rectangle that are closer to \\(O\\) than to any of the four vertices. The total region is the entire interior of the rectangle. So, my first task is to find the area where a point is closer to \\(O\\) than to any vertex, then divide that by the area of the rectangle.\n\nTo find this area, I should figure out the set of points inside the rectangle that satisfy the condition: the distance from the point to \\(O\\) is less than the distance from the point to each of the four vertices. \n\nLet me write down the distance formulas. For any point \\((x, y)\\) inside the rectangle:\n\n- Distance to \\(O\\): \\(d_O = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2"

To satisfy all these inequalities, the point must be closer to the center than to any of the corners.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated with four inequalities. Maybe there's a way to simplify this. Since the problem has symmetry, perhaps we can consider one of the quadrants and then multiply by four? Wait, but the regions might intersect in a more complex way. Alternatively, maybe the set of points closer to the center than any vertex is the intersection of four regions: each where the center is closer than a particular vertex. So I can write the inequalities:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \\) for vertex B,\n\nand similarly for the other three vertices. \n\nBut solving all four inequalities might require breaking them down. Alternatively, perhaps the region where the center is the closest is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors between the center and each vertex. That makes sense. The set of points equidistant to the center and a vertex form a perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the center and that vertex. The region closer to the center than the vertex would be on one side of that bisector.\n\nTherefore, the region where the point is closer to \\(O\\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four regions closer to \\(O\\) than A, B, C, D. Each of these regions is the half-plane defined by the perpendicular bisector between \\(O\\) and each vertex. The intersection of all these half-planes will form a polygon (probably a quadrilateral or another"

Then, the area of this polygon divided by the area of the rectangle will give the probability.\n\nSo, I need to find the equations of these perpendicular bisectors and then find the intersection region. Let me start by finding the perpendicular bisector between \\(O\\) (the origin) and one vertex, say \\(A (-a, b)\\).\n\nThe segment \\(OA\\) goes from \\((-a, b)\\) to \\((0,0)\\). The perpendicular bisector of this segment will be a line that is perpendicular to \\(OA\\) and passes through its midpoint. Let me find the midpoint first. Midpoint \\(M\\) is \\(\\left( (-a + 0)/2, (b + 0)/2 \\right) = (-a/2, b/2)\\).\n\nThe slope of \\(OA\\) is \\((b - 0)/(-a - 0) = -b/a\\). Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal, which is \\(a/b\\).\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is \\(y - b/2 = (a/b)(x + a/2)\\). Let me rearrange this:\n\n\\( y = (a/b)x + (a/b)(a/2) + b/2 \\)\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n\\( (a/b)(a/2) = a\u00b2/(2b) \\), so:\n\n\\( y = (a/b)x + (a\u00b2)/(2b) + b/2 \\)\n\nCombine the constant terms:\n\n\\( (a\u00b2)/(2b) + b/2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/(2b) \\)\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( y = (a/b)x + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/(2b) \\)\n\nHmm, that's the bisector between \\(O\\) and \\(A\\). Similarly, I can find the other bisectors with \\(O\\) and each vertex.\n\nLet's do that for another vertex, say \\(B (a, b)\\). The segment \\(OB\\) goes from \\((a, b)\\) to \\((0,0)\\). The midpoint here is \\((a/2, b/2)\\). The slope of \\(OB\\) is \\((b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a\\), so the slope of the perpendicular bisector is \\(-a/b\\).\n\nThus,"

However, we need to check if these points lie within the rectangle.\n\nFor the intersection on the right edge, y-coordinate is (b\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2b). Let me check if this is positive:\n\n(b\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2b) > 0 => b\u00b2 > a\u00b2 => b > a.\n\nSimilarly, for the intersection on the top edge, x-coordinate is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(2a). This is positive if a\u00b2 > b\u00b2, i.e., a > b.\n\nSo, if a > b, then the intersection on the right edge is above the rectangle's base, and the intersection on the top edge is left of the rectangle's right boundary. If a < b, then the intersections would lie outside the rectangle.\n\nWait, but this depends on whether \\( a > b \\) or \\( a < b \\), which in turn depends on \\( k \\).\n\nSince \\( a = (k/2) b \\), if \\( k > 2 \\), then \\( a > b \\); if \\( k = 2 \\), \\( a = b \\); if \\( k < 2 \\), \\( a < b \\).\n\nSo, depending on whether \\(k > 2\\), \\(k = 2\\), or \\(k < 2\\), the intersections lie inside or outside the rectangle.\n\nLet me consider the two cases separately.\n\nCase 1: \\(k > 2\\) (i.e., \\(a > b\\)).\n\nIn this case, the line 2a x + 2b y = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 intersects the right edge at (a, (b\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2b)). Since \\( a > b \\), the y-coordinate is negative, which is below the rectangle's base y=0. Therefore, in the first quadrant, the line doesn't intersect the right edge within the rectangle.\n\nInstead, it intersects the top edge at ((a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(2a), b). Since \\( a > b \\), \\( a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 > 0 \\), so x-coordinate is positive"
