Let T represent the weight of one treek, S for one squig, and G for one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, \"Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee,\" I can write the equation 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says, \"Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig,\" which translates to 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I'll use the second equation to substitute for G in the first equation. From 2T + G = S, I can express G as S - 2T.\n\nSubstituting G = S - 2T into the first equation gives 10T = 3S + (S - 2T). Simplifying this, I get 10T = 4S - 2T.\n\nNext, I'll add 2T to both sides to gather like terms: 12T = 4S. Then, I'll divide both sides by 4 to find the relationship between T and S: 3T = S.\n\nFinally, to find how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, I'll solve for T by dividing both sides by 3, resulting in T = S/3. This means three treeks have the same weight as one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nLet:\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Statements into Equations**\n\n1. **Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee:**\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:**\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**\n\nFrom **Equation 2**:\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( G \\) into **Equ"
