The problem also mentions that there are two common tangents, which form these four points. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should visualize what's going on here. The circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\) is centered at the origin with a radius of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). The parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\) opens to the right with its vertex at the origin. Since both curves pass through the origin, they must intersect there, but I think they also have some common tangents elsewhere. The Asymptote code shows points A, B, C, D with coordinates (-1,1), (2,4), (-1,-1), and (2,-4), which are the points of tangency. That gives me a hint about where these points might be.\n\nWait, actually, before jumping into that, maybe I should find the equations of the common tangents. How do you find common tangents to a circle and a parabola? I remember that for two curves, the tangent lines that touch both can be found by solving their equations simultaneously and ensuring that the system has exactly one solution, meaning the discriminant is zero. Alternatively, I might use the condition for a line to be tangent to both curves.\n\nLet me recall that for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be tangent to a circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\), the condition is \\( c^2 = r^2(1 + m^2) \\). For the parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\), the condition for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be tangent is \\( c = \\frac{a}{m} \\). So maybe I can use these two conditions together.\n\nWait, the given parabola is \\( y^2 = 8x \\), so \\( 4a = 8 \\) which means \\( a = 2 \\). So for any tangent line to the parabola, \\( c = \\frac{2}{m} \\). For"

So if I substitute \\( c \\) from the parabola condition into the circle condition, I can get an equation in terms of \\( m \\).\n\nLet's do that:\n\nSubstitute \\( c = \\frac{2}{m} \\) into \\( c^2 = 2(1 + m^2) \\):\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{2}{m} \\right)^2 = 2(1 + m^2) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( \\frac{4}{m^2} = 2 + 2m^2 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( m^2 \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\( 4 = 2m^2 + 2m^4 \\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( 2m^4 + 2m^2 - 4 = 0 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( m^4 + m^2 - 2 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me set \\( u = m^2 \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\( u^2 + u - 2 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation:\n\n\\( u = \\frac{ -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 8} }{2} = \\frac{ -1 \\pm 3 }{2} \\)\n\nSo, \\( u = 1 \\) or \\( u = -2 \\). Since \\( u = m^2 \\), it can't be negative, so \\( u = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( m^2 = 1 \\) which gives \\( m = 1 \\) or \\( m = -1 \\).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the slopes of the common tangents are \\( 1 \\) and \\( -1 \\). That makes sense, and in the Asymptote code, points A, B, C, D are plotted with these slopes in mind, I think.\n\nNow, let's find the equations of these tangent lines.

Similarly, for the other tangent, \\( y = -x - 2 \\), when x = -1, y = -1, which is point C (-1, -1). So that matches. So the four points of tangency are these four points: (-1,1), (2,4), (-1,-1), (2,-4). Wait, how come? For the points on the parabola, when x is non-zero, y is either positive or negative.\n\nWait, let me think again: If the tangent lines are \\( y = x + 2 \\) and \\( y = -x - 2 \\), they intersect the parabola at exactly one point each, since they are tangent.

Correct.\n\nSo, slopes: AB=1, BC=5/3, CD=-1, DA=-5/3.\n\nSo AB is parallel to CD because their slopes are 1 and -1, which are negative reciprocals, but actually, to be parallel, their slopes should be equal. Wait, no, 1 and -1 are not equal, so not parallel.\n\nWait, so this suggests that it's not a parallelogram. Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is a kite because opposite sides aren't parallel but equal in some way? Wait, but the lengths aren't equal for all sides. Wait, AB is 3\u221a2, BC is sqrt(34), CD is 3\u221a2, DA is sqrt(34). So sides AB and CD are equal, sides BC and DA are equal.\n\nBut the problem is that the quadrilateral is formed by four points of tangency, two on each curve, which might not necessarily make it a parallelogram.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a rectangle?

The slopes are negatives of each other divided by 1? Not sure. Wait, 5/3 and -5/3 are negatives in the numerator, so they are negative of each other. So if two sides have slopes that are negatives of each other, does that mean they are parallel? No, because slope is rise over run. If slope is m and -m, they are not parallel unless m =0.

The quadrilateral has symmetry across the x-axis because points A and C are reflections over the x-axis, and B and D are too.

Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, since the quadrilateral is convex and symmetric, the shoelace formula is the way to go.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute vectors or use coordinate geometry to find the area.\n\nAnother way to find the area is to divide the quadrilateral into two triangles: ABD and BCD, but wait, that might not be the case.

Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, we can observe that the quadrilateral is actually a convex quadrilateral with two pairs of points on vertical lines x = -1 and x = 2. So points A and C are on x = -1, and B and D are on x = 2.\n\nSo, the quadrilateral is a trapezoid with two vertical sides at"

Wait, but the sides aren't perpendicular.
