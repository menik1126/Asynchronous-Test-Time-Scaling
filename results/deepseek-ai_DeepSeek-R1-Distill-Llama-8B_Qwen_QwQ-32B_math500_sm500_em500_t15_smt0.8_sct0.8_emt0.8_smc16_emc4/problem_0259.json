One Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, so Trinket is stronger than Blinket.\n\nNext, I'll convert Drinkets to Blinkets using the second exchange rate: 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets. This means 1 Drinket is worth 3/7 of a Blinket.\n\nTo find how many Blinkets equal 56 Drinkets, I'll multiply 56 by 3/7. This gives 24 Blinkets.\n\nFinally, I'll convert Blinkets to Trinkets by dividing 24 by 4, resulting in 6 Trinkets.\n\nSo, 56 Drinkets are worth 6 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. \\(1\\) Trinket (T) = \\(4\\) Blinkets (B)\n2. \\(3\\) Blinkets (B) = \\(7\\) Drinkets (D)\n\n**We need to find:** The value of \\(56\\) Drinkets in Trinkets.\n\n**Step 1: Find how many Blinkets correspond to \\(1\\) Drinket.**\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[ 3\\text{B} = 7\\text{D} \\]\n\\[ 1\\text{D} = \\frac{3}{7}\\text{B} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of Blinkets for \\(56\\) Drinkets.**\n\n\\[ 56\\text{D} \\times \\frac{3}{7}\\text{B/D} = 24\\text{B} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert Blinkets to Trinkets.**\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[ 1\\text{T} = 4\\text{B} \\]\n\\[ 24\\text{B} \\div 4\\text{T/B} = 6\\text{T} \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"
