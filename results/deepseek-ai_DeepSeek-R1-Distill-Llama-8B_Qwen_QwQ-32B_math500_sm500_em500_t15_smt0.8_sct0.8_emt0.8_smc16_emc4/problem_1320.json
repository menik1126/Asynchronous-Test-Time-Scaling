            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O. The rectangle has sides in the ratio AB/AD = k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the rectangle. It's a standard rectangle with center O, so O is the intersection point of the diagonals. AB is the length of the top side, and AD is the length of the left side. So, AB/AD = k means that the rectangle is not necessarily a square; its length and width are in the ratio k:1. That's good to note.\n\nNow, the problem is about distance. A point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, or D. So, for any given point P inside the rectangle, we want the distance from P to O to be less than the distance from P to A, B, C, or D. The probability we're looking for is the area where this condition holds divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nAlright, so probability is favorable area over total area. So, I need to find the region within ABCD where the distance from P to O is less than the distance to each vertex. That region will likely be some shape within the rectangle, probably another smaller rectangle or maybe a circle, but given the vertices, I think it's a shape bounded by certain curves.\n\nWait, actually, the set of points closer to O than to any of the vertices would probably be a region defined by the intersection of four circles: one centered at each vertex with a radius just large enough that the rectangle is entirely inside all these circles. But that might not be the case here. Alternatively, the region where distance to O is less than the distance to any of the four vertices will be the area where all four inequalities are satisfied:\n\ndistance(P, O) < distance(P, A),\ndistance(P, O) < distance(P, B),\ndistance(P, O) < distance(P, C),\ndistance(P, O) < distance(P, D).\n\nHmm, so these are four separate inequalities. Each one defines a region inside the rectangle where the point is closer to O than to that specific vertex. The intersection of these four regions will be the set of points where P is closer to O than to any"

Since the rectangle is symmetric, perhaps the regions where the point is closer to O than to each vertex can be found by constructing perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex. The perpendicular bisector between two points is the set of points equidistant to both. So, the region closer to O than to a vertex would be on one side of that bisector.\n\nTherefore, the region where the point is closer to O than to all four vertices would be the intersection of the four half-planes defined by the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex. So, if I can find the equations of these bisectors and then find the area of their intersection, that should give me the desired region.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let me place the rectangle such that its center O is at the origin (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, the coordinates of the vertices can be defined in terms of the sides. Let me denote the length of AB as 2a and the length of AD as 2b. Then, since the center is O, the coordinates of the vertices would be:\n\nA: (-a, b)\nB: (a, b)\nC: (a, -b)\nD: (-a, -b)\n\nWait, actually, since AB is the top side, and AD is the left side, so if AB is horizontal, then AB length is 2a, so the coordinates would be as above. Then, the ratio AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, a/b = k, so a = k*b. That might be useful later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to let the sides be AB = 2a and AD = 2b, so that the rectangle has length 2a and width 2b, with center at (0,0). Then, the vertices are at (±a, ±b). Then, the ratio AB/AD is (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k, so a = k*b. So, if I let b = 1, then a = k, but maybe keeping them as a and b is better for now.\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (-a, b)\n\nB: (a,"
