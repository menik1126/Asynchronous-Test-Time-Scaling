I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, then \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2. So \u03c9 can be any of these three values. That means I might have to consider each case separately or find a way to handle all three cases together.\n\nThe expression I need to evaluate is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). This looks like a sum of reciprocals. Maybe I can combine them into a single fraction. Let me try that.\n\nTo add the two fractions, I'll need a common denominator, which would be (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). So, let's write it out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega^2) + 1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n1*(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1*(1 + \u03c9) = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 + \u03c9 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nSo now the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nHmm, now I need to figure out the denominator. Let me compute (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Multiplying these out:\n\n(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1*1 + 1*\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9*1 + \u03c9*\u03c9\u00b2.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1*1 = 1,\n\n1*\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b2,\n\n\u03c9*1 = \u03c9,\n\n\u03c9*\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b3.\n\nSo the denominator becomes: 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3.\n\nBut wait, since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, we can substitute that in:\n\nDenominator = 1"

If the numerator and denominator are the same, the expression equals 1? But that would mean the value is always 1 regardless of \u03c9. Is that possible?\n\nLet me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting from the denominator:\n\n(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3.\n\nSince \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, substituting gives:\n\n1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nSo the denominator is 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nIn the numerator, we have 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 as well. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 1. So, regardless of the value of \u03c9 (as long as \u03c9 \u2260 -1), the expression equals 1.\n\nWait, but \u03c9 can't be -1 because \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. Let me confirm: if \u03c9 = -1, then (-1)\u00b3 = -1, which is not equal to 1. So \u03c9 \u2260 -1, so the denominator isn't zero. Therefore, the expression is always equal to 1 for the cube roots of unity.\n\nSo, regardless of whether \u03c9 is 1, \u03c9, or \u03c9\u00b2, the expression simplifies to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut wait, let me test this with specific values to be sure.\n\nCase 1: \u03c9 = 1.\n\nThen, the expression becomes:\n\n1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1\u00b2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, that checks out.\n\nCase 2: \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) = -1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + \u03c9):\n\n1/(1 + (-1/2 + i\u221a3/2)) = 1/(1 - 1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1/(1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = (1)/( (1 + i\u221a3)/2 ) = 2/(1 + i\u221a3).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator"

Since \u03c9\u00b2 is the conjugate of \u03c9 (since \u03c9 is a complex cube root of unity), so \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = -1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1/(1 + (-1/2 - i\u221a3/2)) = 1/(1 - 1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = 1/(1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = 2/(1 - i\u221a3).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i\u221a3):\n\n2*(1 + i\u221a3)/[(1 - i\u221a3)(1 + i\u221a3)] = 2*(1 + i\u221a3)/4 = (1 + i\u221a3)/2.\n\nAdding the two fractions:\n\n(1 - i\u221a3)/2 + (1 + i\u221a3)/2 = (1 - i\u221a3 + 1 + i\u221a3)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So that works too.\n\nCase 3: \u03c9 = \u03c9\u00b2. Wait, but that's the same as the second case, just swapping \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2. Since the expression is symmetric in \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2, it would still give 1.\n\nAlternatively, if we take \u03c9 = \u03c9\u00b2, then the expression would be the same as the second case, so it's still 1.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the expression equals 1. So the only possible value is 1.\n\nHmm, but the problem says \"find all possible values\". Since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, but \u03c9 can be 1, \u03c9, or \u03c9\u00b2, but in each case, the expression is 1. So the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra?\n\nLet me try another approach. Since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, we know"
