            "output": "I need to determine the number of distinct ways 8 people can be seated around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering that rotations of the same arrangement are equivalent.\n\nFirst, I'll fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. By doing this, I can simplify the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people.\n\nNext, I need to arrange these 7 people around the remaining seats. Since the table is square, there are 4 sides, and each side has 2 seats. This means there are 8 seats in total.\n\nHowever, since one person's position is already fixed, there are only 7 seats left for the remaining people. This reduces the complexity of the arrangement.\n\nNow, the problem becomes a matter of linear permutations since fixing one position breaks the rotational symmetry. Therefore, I can calculate the number of ways to arrange 7 people in 7 seats, which is simply 7 factorial.\n\n7! equals 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, resulting in 5040 distinct seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side?  \n**(Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.)**\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have a square table with **4 sides**.\n   - Each side has **2 seats**.\n   - A total of **8 people** need to be seated.\n   - **Rotational arrangements** are considered equivalent.\n\n2. **Fix a Position to Eliminate Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - To account for rotational symmetry, fix **one person's position**.\n   - This reduces the problem to arranging the remaining **7 people**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Arrangements:**\n   - After fixing one person, we have **7 seats** left.\n   - The remaining **7 people** can be arranged in these **7 seats**.\n   - Since the positions are linearized by fixing one person, we use **permutations**.\n\n4. **Compute the Permutation:**\n   - Number of ways = \\(7!\\) (7 factorial).\n   - \\(7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\\).\n\n**"
