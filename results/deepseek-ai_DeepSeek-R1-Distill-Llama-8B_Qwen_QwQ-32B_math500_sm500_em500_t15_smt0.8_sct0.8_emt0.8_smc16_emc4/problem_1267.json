            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 2^(2x) equals 256^(1/2). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit confused about exponents, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, it's often helpful to express both sides with the same base. That way, I can set the exponents equal to each other. So, let me look at each side of the equation separately.\n\nStarting with the left side, 2^(2x). That seems straightforward because the base is already 2. Okay, so I can leave that as it is for now.\n\nNow, the right side is 256^(1/2). Hmm, 256 is a number I recognize from powers of 2. Let me think: 2^8 is 256, right? Because 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4, 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, and 2^7 is 128. Wait, no, that's 2^7 is 128, so 2^8 would be 256. Yep, so 256 is 2^8.\n\nSo, if 256 is 2^8, then 256^(1/2) becomes (2^8)^(1/2). I remember that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, 8 times 1/2 is 4. Therefore, 256^(1/2) simplifies to 2^4. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I take the square root of 256, which is the same as raising it to the power of 1/2, the square root of 256 is 16, because 16 squared is 256. And 16 is 2^4, since 2^4 is 16. Yep, that checks out. So, both sides can be expressed with the base 2 now.\n\nSo now, my equation looks like this: 2^(2x) = 2^4. Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. That means 2x must be equal to 4. So, 2x ="

            "output": " 4.\n\nTo solve for x, I just need to divide both sides by 2. So, 2x divided by 2 is x, and 4 divided by 2 is 2. Therefore, x equals 2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. I converted both sides to base 2 correctly. The left side is definitely 2^(2x), and the right side became 2^4 after simplification. Then, setting the exponents equal because the bases are the same seems right. So, 2x = 4, leading to x = 2.\n\nI could also plug the value back into the original equation to check if it works. Let's see:\n\nLeft side: 2^(2*2) = 2^4 = 16.\n\nRight side: 256^(1/2) = 16.\n\nYep, both sides equal 16, so x=2 is definitely the correct solution.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. I converted both sides to the same base, set the exponents equal, solved for x, and verified the solution. It all makes sense!\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\nFirst, express each side with base 2.\n\nLeft side: \\(2^{2x}\\)\n\nRight side: \n\\[\n256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n\\]\n\nNow, set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[\n2x = 4\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{2}"
