Hmm, I need to find the maximum value of the greatest common divisor of these two expressions. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the greatest common divisor, or gcd, of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find a number \\( d \\) such that \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) completely. My goal is to find the largest possible \\( d \\).\n\nTo approach this, I think using the Euclidean algorithm would be helpful. The Euclidean algorithm is a method to find the gcd of two integers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me denote \\( a = 2n + 1 \\) and \\( b = n + 7 \\). Then, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a - 2b) \\) because subtracting 2 times \\( b \\) from \\( a \\) will give me a smaller number. Let me calculate \\( a - 2b \\):\n\n\\( a - 2b = (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) \\)\nLet me expand that:\n\\( 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = (2n - 2n) + (1 - 14) = 0 - 13 = -13 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, -13) \\). But gcd is always positive, so it's the same as \\( \\gcd(b, 13) \\). Therefore, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\).\n\nNow, since 13 is a prime number, the possible values for the gcd are either 1 or 13. That means the greatest possible value is 13. But wait, I need to verify if 13 can actually divide both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\nIf 13 divides \\( n + 7 \\), then \\( n + 7 \\equiv "

So, \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\).\n\nNow, substituting this back into \\( 2n + 1 \\):\n\\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 2(6) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \\mod 13 \\), which is equivalent to 0. Therefore, \\( 2n + 1 \\) is also divisible by 13 when \\( n = 13k + 6 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the gcd can indeed be 13 when \\( n \\) is congruent to 6 modulo 13. So, the maximum possible value of the gcd is 13.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me try plugging in a specific value of \\( n \\) that satisfies \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\). Let's choose \\( n = 6 \\). Then:\n\n\\( n + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \\)\n\\( 2n + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \\)\nSo, \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\). That's correct.\n\nAnother example: \\( n = 19 \\) (since 19 - 13 = 6, so it's the next number after 6 that's 6 mod 13).\n\\( n + 7 = 19 + 7 = 26 \\)\n\\( 2n + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39 \\)\nNow, \\( \\gcd(26, 39) \\). Let's compute that. The factors of 26 are 1, 2, 13, 26 and factors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, 39. The common factors are 1 and 13, so the gcd is 13 again. Perfect.\n\nWait, what if I choose \\( n = 6 + 13k \\) for some integer \\( k \\)? Let me check \\( n = 6 + 13 = 19 \\), which I already did, and it worked. Let me try another one, say \\( n ="
