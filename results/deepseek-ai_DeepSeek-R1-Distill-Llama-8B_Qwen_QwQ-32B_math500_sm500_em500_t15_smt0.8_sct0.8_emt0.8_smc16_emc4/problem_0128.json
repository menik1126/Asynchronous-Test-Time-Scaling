            "output": "Alright, so I need to find the units digit of 4\\$, which is the superfactorial defined as a nested factorial. Let me try to understand what this superfactorial means first. The notation is a bit confusing, but I think it's n! raised to the power of n!-1, which is still n! factorial? Wait, no, maybe it's more layers of factorials. Let me parse the definition again.\n\nThe superfactorial 4\\$ is written as n\\$, which is underbraced with n!^{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}} with n! levels. So for 4\\$, that would be 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. Hmm, that seems like a tower of four 4!s. But wait, 4! is 24, so 4\\$ is 24^{24^{24^{24}}}. But that's a really big number, so calculating it directly is impossible. But since we only need the units digit, maybe there's a pattern or cycle we can exploit.\n\nFirst, let's compute 4! which is 24. So the innermost factorial is 4! = 24. Then the next level up is 4!^24, which is 24^24. Then the next level is 4!^{(4!^{4!})} = 24^{24^{24}}, and the outermost is 4!^{(4!^{4!^{4!}})} = 24^{24^{24^{24}}}. So 4\\$ is 24^{24^{24^{24}}}, which is a power tower of four 24s. That's enormous, but units digits of powers often cycle in a pattern.\n\nI remember that for units digits of exponents, the cycle length depends on the base. For 24, the base is 24, but let's look at the base modulo 10. 24 mod 10 is 4, so the units digit of 24^k is the same as 4^k mod 10. So instead of dealing with 24^{24^{24^{24}}}, I can just consider 4^{24^{24^{24}}} mod 10.\n\nNow, the units digit cycles for 4: 4, 6, 4, 6, ... with a period"

Therefore, the units digit of 4^k is 4 if k is odd, 6 if k is even.\n\nTherefore, to find the units digit of 4^{24^{24^{24}}}, we need to determine if the exponent 24^{24^{24}} is even or odd. But 24 is even, so any power of 24 is also even. Thus, 24^{24^{24}} is even, which would make the exponent even, so the units digit would be 6. Wait, but is that accurate?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. The exponent here is 24^{24^{24}}, which is an exponent tower of 24s, three high. So let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me consider the exponent E = 24^{24^{24}}. To find whether E is even or odd, since 24 is even, 24 to any positive power is still even. So 24^{24^{24}} is even. Therefore, the exponent E is even, so the exponent in 4^E will be even, leading to a units digit of 6. Therefore, the final answer would be 6? Hmm, but wait, perhaps I need to be more careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exponent's value mod 2 is sufficient because the exponent cycles for 4's units digit have period 2. Let me confirm:\n\nThe cycle length for 4's exponents mod 10 is 2. So 4^{k} mod 10 depends on k mod 2. Since the exponent is E = 24^{24^{24}}, so to compute E mod 2, since we need the exponent mod 2 to know if it's even or odd. But 24 is divisible by 2, so any power of 24 is even, except for 24^0=1, but since 24^anything (with exponent \u22651) is even, so"

            "output": " E is even. Therefore, k is even, so 4^k mod 10 is 6. So the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm oversimplifying because the exponent itself is a huge number. Let me think if there is any more nuance needed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the exponent's exponent modulo \u03c6(10)=4, because of Euler's theorem. Since 4 and 10 are not coprime, Euler's theorem doesn't directly apply, but maybe we can approach it using Chinese Remainder Theorem by considering mod 2 and mod 5, then combining them.\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with the exponent of 4, which is a factor of 2, perhaps the exponent's exponent can be broken down.\n\nWait, let me think again: The units digit of 24^{...} is equivalent to 4^{...} mod 10. So we're looking at the exponent 24^{24^{24}}. Now, to compute 4^E mod 10, with E = 24^{24^{24}}, we can note that 4 has a cycle of 2, so 4^k mod10 is 4 when k is odd and 6 when k is even.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to whether E is even or odd. But E is 24^{24^{24}}, which is a power of 24, hence even, so E is even. Thus, 4^E mod10 is 6.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider higher exponents. For example, if the exponent is even but the exponent's exponent is something, does that affect anything? But no, because when calculating 4^k mod10, all we need is k's parity. Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so E is even, so 4^E has a units digit of 6.\n\nTherefore, I think the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n\nWait, but let me check for a smaller case to test this. Let's compute 2\\$ first. 2\\$ is 2!^{2!} = 2!^2! = 2^2 =4, units digit 4.\n\nWait, but according to our method, 2! is 2, so 2^{2} =4. Now, for 3\\$ it would be 3!"

The base is 6, so mod10, 6^anything is 6 mod10. So that works.\n\nWait, but let's see for 3\\$. The superfactorial is 6^{6^6}. The units digit of 6^anything is 6, so that's correct. So our method works here.\n\nAnother test: 1\\$. That's 1!^{1!} =1^1=1, units digit 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about 5\\$? Well, maybe that's too big, but let's see. The base would be 120, so units digit of 120^... is 0, since any power of 120 ends with 0. So that's straightforward.\n\nBack to 4\\$. So according to my reasoning, the units digit is 6. But let me think again step by step.\n\nFirst, 4\\$ is 24^{24^{24^{24}}}.\n\nWe need the units digit of this tower. Let me denote the tower as 24^(24^(24^24)). Let me work from the top down.\n\nFirst, the innermost exponent is 24^24. Let's call that A =24^24. Then the next exponent is 24^A, call that B =24^A. Then the entire expression is 24^B.\n\nWe need the units digit of 24^B. Since 24 mod 10 is 4, so it's equivalent to 4^B mod10.\n\nNow, 4 has a cycle of 2 mod10. So 4^B mod10 is 4 if B is odd, 6 if B is even.\n\nSo we need to know if B is even or odd. B is 24^A. Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so B is even. Therefore, 4^B mod10 is 6. So that's the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, let me"
