Starting at the origin (0, 0), he walks 1/2 mile south, which brings him to (0, -1/2).\n\nNext, he moves 3/4 mile east, placing him at (3/4, -1/2).\n\nThen, he walks another 1/2 mile south, ending up at (3/4, -1). \n\nTo find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I'll use the distance formula: the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates. Calculating this gives me a distance of approximately 1.06 miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down Bill's movements and calculate his final position relative to the starting point using a coordinate system.\n\n1. **Starting Point:**\n   - **Coordinates:** \\( (0, 0) \\)\n\n2. **First Movement:**\n   - **Distance:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - **Movement:** Southward affects the \\( y \\)-coordinate negatively.\n   - **New Coordinates:** \\( (0, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\)\n\n3. **Second Movement:**\n   - **Distance:** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n   - **Movement:** Eastward affects the \\( x \\)-coordinate positively.\n   - **New Coordinates:** \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\)\n\n4. **Third Movement:**\n   - **Distance:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - **Movement:** Southward affects the \\( y \\)-coordinate negatively.\n   - **Final Coordinates:** \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, -1) \\)\n\n5. **Calculating the Straight-Line Distance:**\n   - Use the **distance formula** to find the straight-line distance between the starting point \\( (0, 0) \\) and the final position \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, -1) \\).\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{3}{4} - 0 \\right)^2 + \\left( -1 - 0 \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt"
