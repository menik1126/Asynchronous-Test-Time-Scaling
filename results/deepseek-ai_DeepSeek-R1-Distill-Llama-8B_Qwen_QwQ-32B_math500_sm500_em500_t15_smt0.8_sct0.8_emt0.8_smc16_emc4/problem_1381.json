            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a matrix M that transforms one vector to another and another vector to another. I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this matrix M. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the matrix M transforms the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3) and the vector (1, -3) to (7, -1). So, I can write this as two matrix multiplication equations. Let me denote M as a 2x2 matrix with entries m11, m12, m21, m22. So, M = [[m11, m12], [m21, m22]].\n\nIf I apply M to the vector (2, -1), I get (9, 3). So, that would be:\n\n[m11*2 + m12*(-1)] = 9  \n[m21*2 + m22*(-1)] = 3\n\nSimilarly, applying M to the vector (1, -3) gives (7, -1):\n\n[m11*1 + m12*(-3)] = 7  \n[m21*1 + m22*(-3)] = -1\n\nSo, now I have four equations:\n\n1. 2m11 - m12 = 9  \n2. -2m22 + m21 = 3  \n3. m11 - 3m12 = 7  \n4. m21 - 3m22 = -1\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check the second equation again. The second component of the first transformation is 3. So, m21*2 + m22*(-1) = 3. So that's 2m21 - m22 = 3, which is equation 2. Similarly, the second transformation's second component is -1, so m21*1 + m22*(-3) = -1. So, equation 4 is m21 - 3m22 = -1.\n\nSo, now I have four equations:\n\n1. 2m11 - m12 = 9  \n2. 2m21 - m22 = 3  \n3. m11 - 3m12 = 7  \n4. m21 - 3m22 = -1\n\nOkay, so now I can try solving these equations step by step. Let's consider equations 1 and "

Let's compute this:\n\n14 + 6m12 - m12 = 9  \n14 + 5m12 = 9  \n5m12 = 9 -14  \n5m12 = -5  \nm12 = -1\n\nNow, substitute back into equation 3: m11 = 7 + 3*(-1) = 7 -3 = 4. So, m11 is 4, m12 is -1.\n\nNow, moving to equations 2 and 4, which involve m21 and m22.\n\nFrom equation 4: m21 = -1 + 3m22.\n\nPlugging into equation 2: 2*(-1 + 3m22) - m22 = 3  \nSo, -2 + 6m22 - m22 = 3  \n-2 +5m22 = 3  \n5m22 = 3 +2  \n5m22 =5  \nm22=1\n\nThen, from m21 = -1 + 3(1) = 2. So, m21=2, m22=1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the matrix M is:\n\n[4, -1]  \n[2, 1]\n\nOkay, so M is:\n[4  -1]\n[2   1]\n\nNow, the next part is to find the image of the line y = 2x +1 under this transformation M.\n\nHmm. So, first, I should recall how linear transformations affect lines. Since M is a linear transformation, it will map lines to lines. So, the image of the line y=2x+1 under M will be another line. I need to find the equation of this image line.\n\nTo do this, I can consider that any point (x, y) on the original line will be transformed to (x', y') by M, and then express the relation between x' and y' to find the equation of the image line.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to find the image of two points on the line y=2x+1, and then determine the line through these two transformed points. Since the transformation is linear, the image"

So, point A is (0,1).\n\nAnother point, let's pick x=1: y=2*1 +1=3. So, point B is (1,3).\n\nNow, apply the matrix M to both points.\n\nFirst, point A: (0,1). So:\n\nx' = 4*0 + (-1)*1 = 0 -1 = -1  \ny' = 2*0 +1*1 = 0 +1 =1  \nSo, image of A is (-1, 1).\n\nSecond, point B: (1,3). Applying M:\n\nx' =4*1 + (-1)*3 =4 -3=1  \ny'=2*1 +1*3=2+3=5  \nSo, image of B is (1,5).\n\nNow, the image of the line y=2x+1 under M is the line passing through (-1,1) and (1,5). Let's find the equation of this line.\n\nTo find the slope (m') between these two points:\n\nm' = (5 -1)/(1 - (-1)) =4/2=2\n\nSo, the slope is 2. Now, using the point-slope form with point (-1,1):\n\ny -1 = 2(x - (-1))  \ny -1 = 2(x+1)  \ny = 2x +2 +1  \ny=2x +3\n\nWait, so the image line is y=2x+3.\n\nLet me confirm this with another method just to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can parametrize the original line. Let me represent the line y=2x+1 with parameter t, so any point on the line can be written as (t, 2t+1). Then, apply M to this general point.\n\nSo, (x, y) = (t, 2t+1). Then, M*(x, y) = M*(t, 2t+1) = (4t -1, 2t +1). So, the image point (x', y') is (4t -1,"

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the transformed points.\n\nFirst, point A was (0,1):\n\nFirst component: 4*0 + (-1)*1 = -1  \nSecond component: 2*0 +1*1 =1  \nSo that's (-1,1). That's correct.\n\nPoint B was (1,3):\n\nFirst component:4*1 + (-1)*3 =4-3=1  \nSecond component:2*1 +1*3=2+3=5  \nSo (1,5). That's correct.\n\nBut when I parametrized the line as (t, 2t+1), then applying M gives:\n\nFirst component:4t - (2t +1) =4t -2t -1=2t -1  \nSecond component:2t + (2t +1)=4t +1\n\nSo, the image point is (2t -1, 4t +1). Hmm, so when t=0, that gives (-1,1), which matches point A. When t=1, that gives (2*1 -1,4*1 +1)=(1,5), which matches point B. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the parametrization of the image is (2t -1, 4t +1). To find the equation in terms of x' and y', we can eliminate the parameter t.\n\nLet me let x' =2t -1, so solving for t: t=(x' +1)/2\n\nThen, substitute into y'=4t +1:\n\ny' =4*( (x' +1)/2 ) +1 =2(x' +1) +1 =2x' +2 +1=2x' +3"

Maybe using the matrix to find the inverse transformation or something else.\n\nAlternatively, could I find the equation of the image line by using the matrix M to represent the transformation and then see how it affects the line y=2x+1?\n\nWait, the line y=2x+1 can be written as a system of equations: y = 2x +1. Under the transformation M, the new coordinates (x', y') are related to (x, y) by:\n\nx' =4x - y  \ny'=2x + y\n\nSo, since y=2x+1, we can substitute y into the equations for x' and y':\n\nx' =4x - (2x +1)=4x -2x -1=2x -1  \ny' =2x + (2x +1)=4x +1\n\nNow, we have x' =2x -1 and y'=4x +1. So, we can express x in terms of x', and substitute into y' to get y' in terms of x'.\n\nFrom x' =2x -1, solving for x: x=(x' +1)/2.\n\nSubstitute into y' =4x +1:\n\ny' =4*( (x' +1)/2 ) +1=2(x' +1)+1=2x' +2 +1=2x' +3.\n\nSo, same result: y'=2x' +3.\n\nHence, the image of the line y=2x +1 under M is y=2x +3.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1.

Alternatively, parametrize the line and use substitution to find the image equation.\n\nAll methods led to the same result, so I'm confident that the image line is y=2x+3.\n</think>\n\nThe matrix M that transforms the given vectors is determined to be:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -"
