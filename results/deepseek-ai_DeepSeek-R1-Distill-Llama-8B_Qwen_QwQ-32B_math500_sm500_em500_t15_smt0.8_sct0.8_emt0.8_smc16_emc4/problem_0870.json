So, \u221a2 + \u221a2/2 equals (2\u221a2 + \u221a2)/2, which is (3\u221a2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for the \u221a3 terms, 1/\u221a3 can be rewritten as \u221a3/3. So, \u221a3 + \u221a3/3 equals (3\u221a3 + \u221a3)/3, which is (4\u221a3)/3.\n\nNow, the expression simplifies to (3\u221a2)/2 + (4\u221a3)/3.\n\nTo combine these fractions, I'll find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. Therefore, I'll convert both fractions:\n\n(3\u221a2)/2 = (9\u221a2)/6 and (4\u221a3)/3 = (8\u221a3)/6.\n\nAdding these together gives (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nIn this form, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. To find the smallest possible c, I'll check if the numerator and denominator have any common factors. Since 9 and 8 are coprime and 6 has no common factors with them, the expression is already in its simplest form.\n\nFinally, adding a, b, and c together: 9 + 8 + 6 equals 23.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), we aim to express it in the form \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3}}{c}\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are positive integers with \\(c\\) minimized.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Combine Like Terms for \\(\\sqrt{2}\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}"
