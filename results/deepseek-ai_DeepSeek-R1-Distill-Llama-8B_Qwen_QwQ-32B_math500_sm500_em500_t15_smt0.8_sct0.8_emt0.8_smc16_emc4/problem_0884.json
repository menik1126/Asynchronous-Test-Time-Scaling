A fraction in its simplest form will always terminate if the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 or 5.\n\nNext, I'll factorize the denominator of the fraction 57/160. Breaking down 160, I get 160 = 2^5 * 5.\n\nSince the prime factors of the denominator are only 2 and 5, the fraction can be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n\nTo convert the fraction to a decimal, I'll divide the numerator by the denominator. Performing the division 57 \u00f7 160 gives me 0.35625.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer as 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Terminating Decimals:**\n   - A fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will have a terminating decimal if the prime factors of \\(b\\) are only 2 and/or 5.\n\n2. **Factorize the Denominator:**\n   - \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\\)\n\n3. **Express the Fraction as a Decimal:**\n   - Since the denominator has only 2 and 5 as prime factors, the decimal will terminate.\n   - divide numerator 57 by denominator 160.\n\n4. **Perform the Division:**\n   \\[\n   57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
