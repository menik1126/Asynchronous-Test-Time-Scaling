Here, n is 50, so the sum of positive terms is 50² = 2500.\n\nThe sum of the first n even numbers is n(n + 1). For n = 50, this sum is 50 * 51 = 2550.\n\nFinally, I'll subtract the sum of the negative terms from the positive terms: 2500 - 2550 = -50.\n\nTherefore, the total sum of the series is -50.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are tasked to compute the series:\n\n\\[ 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100 \\]\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Series Pattern:**\n   \n   The series alternates between positive and negative numbers:\n   \n   \\[\n   (1) - (2) + (3) - (4) + (5) - (6) + \\dots + (99) - (100)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Separate Positive and Negative Terms:**\n   \n   Let's split the series into two separate groups:\n   \n   - **Positive terms:** \\( 1, 3, 5, \\dots, 99 \\)\n   - **Negative terms:** \\( -2, -4, -6, \\dots, -100 \\)\n   \n3. **Group the Terms:**\n   \n   There are 100 terms in total. Since the series alternates starting with a positive term, we have:\n   \n   - 50 **positive odd terms**: \\( 1, 3, 5, \\dots, 99 \\)\n   - 50 **negative even terms**: \\( 2, 4, 6, \\dots, 100 \\)\n   \n4. **Compute the Sum of Positive Terms:**\n   \n  "
