The sequence is defined in a specific way: for every positive integer k, the subsequence consisting of a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}} is arithmetic. Also, we're given that a_{13} is 2016, and we need to find a_1.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what geometric and arithmetic sequences are. A geometric sequence is one where each term is a multiple of the previous term by a common ratio, so each term is the previous term times some number r. An arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, has a common difference between consecutive terms, so each term is the previous term plus a common difference d.\n\nGiven that, let's unpack the problem. The sequence is strictly increasing, so each term is larger than the previous one. Furthermore, the problem states that for every k, two conditions hold:\n\n1. a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}} form a geometric sequence.\n2. a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}} form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo for each k, we have overlapping subsequences where the first three terms form a geometric progression and the next three form an arithmetic progression. Interesting.\n\nLet me try to write down the relationships that these conditions impose on the terms. Let's denote the terms as a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{13}, and so on, since a_{13} is given.\n\nStarting with k=1: the first geometric sequence is a_1, a_2, a_3. Since it's geometric, we have a_2 / a_1 = a_3 / a_2, which implies that a_2 squared equals a_1 times a_3. Similarly, the first arithmetic sequence is a_2, a_3, a_4. Since it's arithmetic, a_3 - a_2 = a_4 - a_3, so 2a_3 = a_2 + a_4, or a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: the"

Then the arithmetic sequence for k=2 is a_4, a_5, a_6, so 2a_5 = a_4 + a_6, so a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4.\n\nContinuing this pattern, each odd-indexed term is part of a geometric triplet with the next two terms, and each even-indexed term is part of an arithmetic triplet with the next two terms.\n\nSince the sequence is strictly increasing, all the terms must be positive integers, and each term must be larger than the previous one. So the ratios and differences must be positive integers as well.\n\nGiven that a_{13} is 2016, we need to work backwards or forwards to find a_1. Since the problem is asking for a_1, maybe working forward is better, but since we know a_{13}, perhaps working backward is more straightforward. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a general formula for a_n in terms of a_1 and some parameters, then use the given a_{13} to solve for a_1. Let's try to see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLet me start by writing out the first few terms in terms of a_1 and some variables, then see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s start with a_1. Let me call a_1 = x. Then, since the first three terms form a geometric sequence, let me denote the common ratio as r1. So:\n\na_2 = a_1 * r1 = x * r1\n\na_3 = a_2 * r1 = x * r1^2\n\nThen, the next triplet (a_2, a_3, a_4) must form an arithmetic sequence. So the difference between a_3 and a_2 must equal the difference between a_4 and a_3. Therefore:\n\na_4 = 2a_3 - a_2 = 2(x r1^2) - x r1 = x r1 (2 r1 - 1)\n\nNow, moving to the next geometric triplet: a_3, a_4, a_5 must form a geometric sequence. Let me denote the common ratio"

So (2 r1 - 1) must be divisible by r1.\n\nLet me think: Let's let r2 = (2 r1 - 1)/r1. So that's equal to 2 - 1/r1. For this to be an integer, 1/r1 must be an integer, which implies that r1 is 1. But wait, if r1 is 1, then a_2 = a_1, but the sequence is strictly increasing, so each term must be greater than the previous. Therefore, r1 cannot be 1, because that would make a_2 = a_1, which is not allowed. Hence, this approach might be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in assuming that r2 can be expressed as 2 - 1/r1. Let me check again.\n\nWe had:\n\nr2 = (2 r1 - 1)/r1 = 2 - (1/r1)\n\nHmm, so 1/r1 has to be an integer because r2 must be an integer. But since r1 must be a positive integer greater than 1 (since the sequence is strictly increasing), 1/r1 is only an integer if r1 is 1, which is not possible because that would make a_2 = a_1, violating the strictly increasing property. Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption was wrong, perhaps I made an error in setting up the problem.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm misapplying the geometric sequence condition. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, perhaps instead of using two different ratios, maybe the ratios are the same. Let me think: Wait, if the first geometric triplet is a_1, a2, a3 with ratio r1,"

So:\n\na2 = a1 * r = x * r\n\na3 = a2 * r = x * r^2\n\nThen, the next triplet a2, a3, a4 must form an arithmetic sequence.

So:\n\na4 = a3 * s => x r^2 * s = a4 = x r (2r - 1)\n\nDivide both sides by x r (assuming x and r are non-zero, which they are):\n\nr * s = 2r - 1\n\nTherefore, s = (2r - 1)/r\n\nAgain, s must be a positive integer.
