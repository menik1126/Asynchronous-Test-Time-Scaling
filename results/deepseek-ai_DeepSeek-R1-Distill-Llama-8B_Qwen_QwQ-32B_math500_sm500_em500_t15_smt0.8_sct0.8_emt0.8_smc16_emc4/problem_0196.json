            "output": "Alright, so I've got this equation: x\u2074 + 5x\u00b3 + 9x\u00b2 - x - 14 = 0, and I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to find integer roots of a polynomial equation, I can use the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at the equation, the leading term is x\u2074, so the leading coefficient is 1. The constant term is -14. That means the possible values for p (the factors of -14) are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, and \u00b114. Since the leading coefficient is 1, q is also 1, so the possible rational roots are just the factors of -14: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nNow, I'll test these values one by one by plugging them into the equation.\n\nStarting with x = 1:\n1\u2074 + 5*1\u00b3 + 9*1\u00b2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1+5) + (9-1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0. Oh, neat! So x=1 is a root.\n\nNext, x = -1:\n(-1)\u2074 + 5*(-1)\u00b3 + 9*(-1)\u00b2 - (-1) -14 = 1 -5 + 9 +1 -14. Let's calculate: 1 -5 is -4; -4 +9 is 5; 5 +1 is 6; 6 -14 is -8. Not zero, so -1 isn't a root.\n\nHow about x=2:\n2\u2074 + 5*2\u00b3 + 9*2\u00b2 -2 -14. That's 16 + 5*8 + 9*4 -2 -14. 16 +40 +36 -2 -14. Let's add: 16+40=56; 56+36=92; 92-2=90; 90-14=76. Not zero.\n\nTesting x=-2:\n"

Oh, x=-2 is another root!\n\nMoving on to x=7:\n7\u2074 +5*7\u00b3 +9*7\u00b2 -7 -14. Let's calculate each term:\n7\u2074 is 7*7*7*7=49*49=2401.\n5*7\u00b3 is 5*343=1715.\n9*7\u00b2 is 9*49=441.\nSo adding them up: 2401 +1715 =4116; 4116 +441=4557; then subtract 7 and 14: 4557 -7=4550; 4550-14=4536. Definitely not zero.\n\nTesting x=-7:\n(-7)^4 +5*(-7)^3 +9*(-7)^2 -(-7) -14. So 2401 +5*(-343) +9*49 +7 -14. Compute each:\n2401 -1715 +441 +7 -14. Let's add: 2401-1715=686; 686+441=1127; 1127+7=1134; 1134-14=1120. Not zero.\n\nNow, x=14:\n14^4 is a huge number. Let me compute 14\u00b2=196, so 14\u2074=196\u00b2=38416.\n5*14\u00b3=5*(2744)=13720.\n9*14\u00b2=9*196=1764.\nSo plug in: 38416 +13720 +1764 -14 -14.\nCompute step by step: 38416+13720=52136; 52136+1764=538,  let me see, 52136 + 1000=53136, 53136 +764=53900. So 53900 -14=53886; 53886-14=53872. Definitely not zero.\n\nx=-14:\n(-14)^4 is 14^4=38416.\n5*(-14"

Not zero.\n\nSo the possible integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nBut wait, the polynomial is of degree four, so there should be four roots (some might be complex or repeated). Since we have two integer roots, maybe they can be factored out.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division to factor out (x - 1) and (x + 2). Alternatively, I can use synthetic division.\n\nFirst, let's divide the polynomial by (x - 1). Using synthetic division:\n\nSet up coefficients: 1 (x\u2074), 5 (x\u00b3), 9 (x\u00b2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nUsing x=1:\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1*1=1, add to next coefficient:5+1=6.\n\nMultiply 6*1=6, add to next coefficient:9+6=15.\n\nMultiply 15*1=15, add to next coefficient: -1 +15=14.\n\nMultiply 14*1=14, add to last coefficient: -14 +14=0. So no remainder, as expected.\n\nSo the polynomial factors into (x -1)(x\u00b3 +6x\u00b2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic polynomial x\u00b3 +6x\u00b2 +15x +14.\n\nAgain, try to apply the Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 14: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nTesting x= -2:\n\n(-2)^3 +6*(-2)^2 +15*(-2)+14 = -8 +24 -30 +14. Compute: (-8+24)=16; (16-30)=-14; (-14 +14)=0. So x=-2 is a root again.\n\nTherefore, we can factor out (x + 2) from the cubic.\n\nPerform synthetic division on x\u00b3 +6x\u00b2 +15x +14 with x=-2.\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x\u00b3), 6"

The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = 16 -28 = -12. Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots, only complex ones. So the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nSo I think that's it.
