I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, possible rational roots are the factors of -14, which are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, and \u00b114. Since the denominator is 1, these are all possible integer roots.\n\nAlright, so I should test each of these possible integer roots to see if they satisfy the equation. If a number makes the equation equal zero, it's a root.\n\nLet's start with x = 1:\n\nPlugging in x = 1:\n1^4 + 5*1^3 + 9*1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1+5) + (9-1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0. \n\nWow, so x=1 is a root. Nice, so (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. Maybe I can perform polynomial division to factor it out and find the other factors, which might have other integer roots.\n\nLet me set up the division. Dividing \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x -14\\) by (x - 1). I can use synthetic division since 1 is a root.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n1 | 1  5   9   -1   -14\n          1    6    15    14\n      1  6   15    14     0\n\nSo the quotient polynomial is \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\). Therefore, the original polynomial factors into (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 +"

            "output": " 15x + 14).\n\nNow, I need to find the roots of the cubic polynomial \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 = 0\\). Again, using the Rational Root Theorem on this cubic. The factors of 14 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nTesting x = -1 in the cubic:\n\n(-1)^3 + 6*(-1)^2 + 15*(-1) + 14 = -1 + 6 -15 +14 = (-1 +6) + (-15 +14) = 5 -1 = 4 \u2260 0\n\nSo, not a root.\n\nTesting x = -2:\n\n(-2)^3 + 6*(-2)^2 + 15*(-2) +14 = -8 + 24 -30 +14 = ( -8 +24) + ( -30 +14) = 16 -16 = 0. \n\nGreat, x = -2 is a root. So, (x + 2) is a factor. Let's perform synthetic division again on the cubic:\n\n-2 | 1   6    15    14\n          -2    -8    -14\n      1    4     7     0\n\nThe quotient is \\(x^2 + 4x + 7\\), so now the original polynomial factors are (x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7).\n\nNow, the quadratic factor is \\(x^2 + 4x + 7\\). Let's check if it has any real or integer roots. The discriminant is \\(b^2 - 4ac = 16 - 28 = -12\\), which is negative. So, no real roots, which means the other two roots are complex. Therefore, the only integer roots are x = 1 and x = -2.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I should check x = 2 in the original equation:\n\nx = 2: 16 + 40 + 36 -2 -14 = 16 +40 =56; 56 +36=92; 92 -2=90; 90-14=76 \u22600.\n\nx=7: 7^4 +5*7^3 +9*7^2 -7 -14.
