The superfactorial \\(n\\$\\) is defined as a tower of factorials, starting with \\(n!\\) and continuing with \\(k!\\) where \\(k\\) is the result of the previous factorial. For \\(4\\$\\), this means starting with \\(4!\\), then using that result to compute the next factorial, and so on, for a total of four factorials.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate \\(4!\\), which is 24. The units digit of 24 is 4.\n\nNext, the second part involves calculating \\(4!^4!\\). Since \\(4! = 24\\), this is \\(24^{24}\\). To find the units digit of \\(24^{24}\\), I can use the pattern of units digits for powers of 4. The units digit cycles every 2: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc. Since the exponent is even (24), the units digit of \\(24^{24}\\) is 6.\n\nFinally, the third part is calculating \\(6!^6!\\). \\(6! = 720\\), and the units digit of 720 is 0. Any power of a number ending with 0 will also end with 0. Therefore, the units digit of \\(6!^6!\\) is 0.\n\nCombining these results, the units digit of \\(4\\$\\) is 0.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the units digit of \\(4\\$, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **First Factorial (\\(4!\\))**:\n   \\[\n   4! = 24\n   \\]\n   **Units digit**: 4\n\n2. **Second Factorial (\\(4!^{\\,4!}\\))**:\n   \\[\n   4!^{\\,4!} = 24^{24}\n   \\]\n   **Finding the units digit of \\(24^{24}\\)**:\n   - The units digit of powers of 24 cycles every 2:\n     \\[\n     24^1 = 24 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 4)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     24^2 = 576 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 6)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     24^3 = 24 \\times 24^2 = 24 \\times "
