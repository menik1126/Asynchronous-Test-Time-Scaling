The circle is given by the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\) and the parabola is \\(y^2 = 8x\\). Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. The circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\) has its center at the origin (0,0) and a radius of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). The parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\) opens to the right, and its vertex is at the origin as well. So, both the circle and the parabola share the same vertex, which is the origin. But wait, the circle is also symmetric about both axes, while the parabola is only symmetric about the x-axis. That might affect how their tangents are positioned.\n\nThe problem mentions that there are two common tangents, forming four points of tangency. Wait, two common tangents? I thought a circle and a parabola might have more than two. Maybe I need to recall how to find common tangents between a circle and a parabola.\n\nLet me remember: the equation of a tangent to a circle can be written in the form \\(xx_1 + yy_1 = r^2\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is the point of tangency and \\(r\\) is the radius. For the given circle, \\(r = \\sqrt{2}\\), so the tangent equation becomes \\(xx_1 + yy_1 = 2\\).\n\nOn the other hand, for the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\), the equation of a tangent can be written in the form \\(y = tx + \\frac{2}{t}\\), where \\(t\\) is the slope of the tangent. Alternatively, since the parabola is symmetric about the x-axis, there might be tangents that are horizontal and have different slopes.\n\nBut wait, since the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\) can also be expressed as \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{8}\\), maybe it's easier to find the tangent lines by solving the system of equations: the circle and the parabola.\n\nAnother approach: to find the common tang"
