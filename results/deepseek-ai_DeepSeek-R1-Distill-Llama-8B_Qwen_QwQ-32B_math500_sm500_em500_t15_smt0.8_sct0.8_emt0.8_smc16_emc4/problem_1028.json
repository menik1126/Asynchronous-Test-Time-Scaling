Then, I have to evaluate each of these polynomials at x=1 and add up all the results. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). It's a degree 8 polynomial, so it might factor into smaller polynomials. Since it's given that each factor is monic and with integer coefficients, maybe I can factor it into quadratic or quartic polynomials.\n\nLet me see if this polynomial can be factored as a product of two quadratics. But wait, before that, maybe it's a biquadratic or something else. Wait, the exponents are 8, 4, and 0. Hmm, that suggests it's a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Let me try substituting \\( y = x^4 \\). So then, the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\).\n\nNow, let's factor \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, it factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\).\n\nSubstituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), we get \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). So far, we've broken it down into two quartic polynomials.\n\nNow, can these quartic polynomials be factored further over the integers? Let's check \\( x^4 - 1 \\) first. That's a difference of squares, so it factors into \\( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Then, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) is again a difference of squares, so it factors into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) \\). So, putting it all together:\n\n\\( x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nSo"

Now, we need to check if \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored further over integers.\n\nHmm, \\( x^4 + 4 \\). I remember that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is a sum of squares, but it can actually be factored using the Sophie Germain identity. The formula is \\( x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2) \\). In this case, y is 1, so substituting y=1, we get:\n\n\\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nLet me verify that:\n\nMultiply \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\):\n\nFirst terms: \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\)\n\nOuter terms: \\( x^2*(-2x) = -2x^3 \\)\n\nInner terms: \\( 2x * x^2 = 2x^3 \\)\n\nLast terms: \\( 2x*(-2x) = -4x^2 \\)\n\nWait, maybe I should do it step by step:\n\nMultiply (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2):\n\nFirst multiply x^2 by each term in the second polynomial:\n\nx^2 * x^2 = x^4\n\nx^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3\n\nx^2 * 2 = 2x^2\n\nThen multiply 2x by each term:\n\n2x * x^2 = 2x^3\n\n2x * (-2x) = -4x^2\n\n2x * 2 = 4x\n\nThen multiply 2 by each term:\n\n2 * x^2 = 2x^2\n\n2 * (-2x) = -4x\n\n2 * 2 = 4\n\nNow, add all these terms together:\n\nx^4 -2x^3 + 2x^2 +"

Correct.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the factorization is correct, and the sum is 0+2+2+5+1=10.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"non-constant\" polynomials. So, all the factors here are non-constant except maybe if there was a constant factor. But since all factors are monic, the only constants would be ±1, but since they are monic, the constants would be 1. But in our case, all factors are degree 1 or higher, so all are non-constant. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 10. Hmm, but let me check again the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each non-constant polynomial p_i(x) is monic with integer coefficients, and cannot be factored further over the integers.\" So, yes, all the factors we have are monic, irreducible, non-constant. So the sum is 10. Hmm, but let me see if I made a mistake in the calculation"

Because when we factor further, the x⁴ -1 factors into (x-1)(x+1)(x²+1). So when we compute p_i(1), we have (x-1)(x+1)(x²+1)(x²+2x+2)(x²-2x+2). Each evaluated at 1 is 0,2,2,5,1.
