This simplifies the right side:\n\\[2^{2x} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}\\]\n\\[2^{2x} = 2^4\\]\n\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n\\[2x = 4\\]\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[x = \\frac{4}{2}\\]\n\\[x = 2\\]\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express Both Sides with the Same Base**:\n   - Recognize that \\(256\\) can be written as a power of \\(2\\):\n     \\[\n     256 = 2^8\n     \\]\n   - Substitute this back into the equation:\n     \\[\n     2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the Right Side Using Exponent Rules**:\n   - Apply the power of a power property \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\):\n     \\[\n     (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n     \\]\n   - Now, the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     2^{2x} = 2^4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Set the Exponents Equal to Each Other**:\n   - Since the bases are the same (\\(2 = 2\\)), the exponents must be equal:\n     \\[\n     2x = 4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\)**:\n   -"
