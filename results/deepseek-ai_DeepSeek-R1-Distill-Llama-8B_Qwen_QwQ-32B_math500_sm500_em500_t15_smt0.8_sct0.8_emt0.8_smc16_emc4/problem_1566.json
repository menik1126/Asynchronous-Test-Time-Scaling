            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem: I need to figure out how many ways 8 people can be seated around a square table with 2 people on each side. And importantly, two configurations are considered the same if one is just a rotation of the other. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that when arranging people around a table, the number of arrangements can be different from arranging them in a straight line because rotations of the same arrangement aren't considered unique. For a circular table, the number of ways to arrange n people is (n-1)! because rotating the entire table doesn't create a new arrangement. But wait, this is a square table, which is a bit different from a regular circular table. A square has four sides, so maybe there are some symmetries involved here too.\n\nThe table has 4 sides, each with 2 people. So, in total, 8 people. I guess I need to fix the position of one person to eliminate the rotational symmetry. Like, if I fix one person at a specific spot, that might help me avoid counting rotations as different arrangements. So, let's fix person A at a particular seat. That leaves me with 7 remaining people to arrange around the table.\n\nBut hold on, it's a square table, so not only rotations but also reflections might count as the same configuration. Hmm, does the problem consider mirror images as distinct? Let me check: the problem says two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. So, reflections would not be considered equivalent because they aren't just rotations. So, mirror images are different. That means I don't have to worry about reflections in this case.\n\nSo, if I fix person A at a seat, then the rest can be arranged in 7! ways. But wait, isn't that overcounting? Because the table is square, and each side has 2 people, maybe there are some constraints on how people can be seated.\n\nWait, actually, each side has two people. So, each side is a pair of people sitting next to each other. So, maybe it's not just a simple circular arrangement. Because the table is square, the seating is in a loop, but also, each side is a specific pair.\n\nLet me think about the structure. So, imagine the table as four sides, each with two seats. So, starting from person A,"

Wait, actually, maybe the sides are each a pair, so each side has two adjacent seats. So, the table has four sides, each with two seats, so total 8 seats. The key is that the table's rotational symmetry can rotate the entire table by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, etc., so each rotation by 90 degrees would map the table onto itself.\n\nTherefore, to account for rotational symmetry, we need to fix the position of one person so that rotations are considered the same. So, fixing one person's position would eliminate rotational duplicates. Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose we fix person A at a specific seat. Then, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in the remaining 7 seats. Since we've fixed one seat, rotations are accounted for. But wait, the problem is that the table's sides have two seats each. So, maybe the arrangement is such that the two seats on each side are adjacent. Therefore, the total number of seating arrangements would be similar to arranging in a circle, but with the added structure of sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is analogous to arranging 8 people around a circular table, but with the added condition that each side (of the square) has exactly two people. But since the table is square, the sides are fixed in the environment, so perhaps the rotational symmetry is still the main concern here.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. So, if you can rotate the table so that all the people are in the same positions relative to each other, then they are considered the same. So, the square table's rotational symmetry group has four elements: rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is the total number of linear arrangements divided by the number of rotations, which is 4. But wait, but in circular arrangements, we usually divide by n for a circular table. Here, since it's a square, maybe divide by 4?\n\nBut hold on, let me think again. For a circular table with n seats, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. Here, the square table has 8"

So, perhaps the rotational symmetry is of order 4, so we have to divide by 4.\n\nBut now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me take it step by step.\n\nTotal number of ways without considering rotations: Since the table has 8 seats, and 8 people, that's 8! ways. But since the table can be rotated, some of these are duplicates. To account for this, we fix one seat, which turns it into a circular arrangement problem. So, fixing one seat, the number of distinct arrangements would be 7! But wait, wait. For a circular table with n seats, fixing one seat gives (n-1)! arrangements. But in this case, the table is square, which might have more symmetry. So, perhaps, if I fix one seat, but the table's rotations by 90°, 180°, and 270° still count as equivalent.\n\nWait, no. By fixing one seat, I already accounted for the rotations. Because if I fix one seat, rotating the table would move that fixed seat, but since we've fixed one seat, that rotation isn't possible anymore. So, perhaps fixing a seat is sufficient to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nBut wait, wait. Fixing one seat at a square table, does that account for all rotational symmetries? Because a square has rotational symmetry of order 4, so normally, we would have to divide by 4. But when we fix a seat, it's as if we're breaking the rotational symmetry, so that each unique arrangement is only counted once.\n\nAlternatively, the general formula for counting distinct arrangements under rotational symmetry is to divide by the order of the symmetry group. For a square, the rotational symmetry group has 4 elements (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). So, to count distinct colorings (or arrangements), we take the total number and divide by 4.\n\nBut wait, no, that's only when considering colorings where each position is colored. But in our case, we have people, which are distinguishable.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of group actions.

The group here is the rotation group of the square, which has four elements: rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\nSo, applying Burnside's lemma, the number of distinct arrangements is (fixed points by 0° + fixed points by 90° + fixed points by 180° + fixed points by 270°)/4.\n\nHmm, maybe this is the way to go. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, the total number of arrangements without considering rotation is 8!.\n\nNow, applying Burnside's lemma:\n\nFirst, the identity rotation (0°). All arrangements are fixed by the identity, so fixed points here are 8!.\n\nSecond, rotation by 90°. For an arrangement to be fixed under a 90° rotation, each seat must be occupied by the same person as the seat 90° rotated. Since the table has 8 seats, a 90° rotation moves each seat to the next seat in the clockwise direction. Wait, actually, a square table has 4 sides, each with two seats. So, rotating 90° would move each seat to the next side's position. Let me think of the seats as labeled 1 through 8, arranged around the table.

Wait, actually, maybe it's better to think of the rotation as moving each seat to the next position. Let me see:\n\nIf the table is a square with four sides, each side has two seats. Let me number the seats clockwise as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, seats 1 and 2 are on the first side, 3 and 4 on the second, 5 and 6 on the third,"

Wait, no, that's a rotation by 45 degrees because it's moving seat 1 to 2, which is the next seat. A 90° rotation would move seat 1 to seat 3, seat 2 to seat 4, seat 3 to seat 5, and so on, right? Because each side is two seats, moving by one side is 90°, so moving seat 1 to seat 3 would be a 90° rotation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's model the rotation as shifting each seat by two positions because each rotation moves each seat to the next side, but since each side has two seats, moving by two seats would take you to the next side. So, a 90° rotation is equivalent to moving each seat two places ahead in the sequence. So, seat 1 goes to seat 3, seat 3 goes to seat 5, etc.\n\nSo, in the rotation by 90°, seat 1 → seat 3 → seat 5 → seat 7 → seat 1.\n\nSimilarly, seat 2 → seat 4 → seat 6 → seat 8 → seat 2.\n\nSo, for an arrangement to be fixed under 90° rotation, it must satisfy that seat 1 = seat 3 = seat 5 = seat 7, and seat 2 = seat 4 = seat 6 = seat 8.\n\nBut in our problem, we're seating 8 distinct people around the table. So, the only way this can happen is if seat 1, 3, 5, 7 are all the same person and seats 2,4,6,8 are all the same person. But since each seat is occupied by a distinct person, this is impossible unless n is such that we can have repeated people, which we can't. So, there are zero fixed arrangements under a 90° rotation.\n\nSimilarly, for a rotation by 270°, which is the same as a -90°"

So, seat 1 goes to seat 5, seat 2 to seat 6, seat 3 to seat 7, seat 4 to seat 8, seat 5 to seat 1, etc.\n\nFor an arrangement to be fixed under 180° rotation, seat 1 must equal seat 5, seat 2 must equal seat 6, seat 3 must equal seat 7, seat 4 must equal seat 8.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, the rotation moves seat 1 to seat 5, so for the arrangement to be fixed, the person originally in seat 1 must be in seat 5 after rotation.

So, there are zero fixed arrangements under 180° rotation as well.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Wait, if you rotate by 180°, it's like each person is swapped with the one opposite. So, for the seating arrangement to be fixed, each person must be in the seat opposite to where they started. But since all people are distinct, this would require that each person is in two seats, which isn't allowed. Therefore, the number of fixed arrangements under 180° rotation is indeed zero.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because if I don't consider rotations, then the total number is 8!, and applying Burnside's lemma, I have:\n\n(8! + 0 + 0 + 0)/4 = 8!/4.\n\nIs that right? But I also thought of fixing one seat, giving 7! arrangements. Wait, so which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied Burnside's lemma here.

So, here, the group has four elements: identity, 90°, 180°, 270°.\n\nI need to compute the number of arrangements fixed by each of these.\n\n- For identity: All arrangements are fixed, so that's 8!.\n- For 90°: As we determined, for an arrangement to be fixed under a 90° rotation, each orbit under the rotation must be the same person. The rotation cycles are (1 3 5 7) and (2 4 6 8). So, each of these cycles must consist of the same person. Since each person is unique, this is impossible, so fixed arrangements here are 0.\n- For 180°: The rotation cycles are (1 5), (2 6), (3 7), (4 8). For each cycle, the two seats must have the same person, but since all are unique, this is impossible.

Wait, why?\n\nWait, perhaps because in the circular table, the group is of order n, so fixing a seat effectively reduces the problem to a linear arrangement, hence (n-1)!.\n\nBut in the square table, the group is of order 4, so fixing a seat would not account for all symmetries unless the group is of order n. Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the square table's rotational symmetry is of order 4, but the number of seats is 8. So, the group is smaller than the number of seats, so fixing a seat doesn't account for all symmetries?\n\nWait, no. Fixing a seat should eliminate the rotational symmetry. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose I fix one person at seat 1. Then, any rotation of the table would move that person to another seat, which is not allowed because we fixed them at seat 1. Therefore, the remaining 7 people can be arranged freely in the remaining seats, giving 7!.\n\nBut according to Burnside's lemma, the answer is 8! /4. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the 4-person example, fixing one seat gives 3! =6, which matches"

But in reality, when we fix one seat, we are considering the table in a specific orientation, thus eliminating the rotational symmetries, but in our case, the group is of size 4, so by fixing one seat, we are effectively reducing the number of symmetries to 1, i.e., the identity, so the count becomes (n-1)!.\n\nWait, but that's the case for a circular table, which has n rotational symmetries.

Wait a minute, when fixing a seat in a circular table (with n seats), the number is (n-1)! which equals n! /n.\n\nSimilarly, for a square table with rotational symmetry of order 4 and n seats (here n=8), we can consider it as a circular arrangement with n seats but modulo rotational symmetries of order 4, so the formula would be n! /4.\n\nHowever, fixing a seat in a circular arrangement (like the square table) where rotational symmetry is of order 4, would result in n -1 seats being free to arrange, but that's only applicable if rotations are of order n.

Wait, actually, a rotation of 90 degrees on a square would move each side to the next side. Since each side has two seats, a 90-degree rotation would move each seat to the seat two positions over. For example, seat 1 moves to seat 3's position, seat 3 moves to 5, seat5 to7, seat7 to1. Similarly seat2 moves to4, seat4 to6, seat6 to8, seat8 to2.\n\nTherefore, the rotation by 90 degrees has two cycles: (1 3 5 7) and (2 4 6 8). So, each cycle is length 4.\n\nSimilarly, rotation by 180 degrees would move each seat two cycles, so seat1 to5, seat3 to7, etc. The cycles would be (1 5), (2 6), (3 7), (4 8). Each cycle is length 2.\n\nRotation by 270° is the inverse of 90°, so cycles are the same as 90° but in the opposite direction.\n\nNow, when we do Burnside's lemma, fixed arrangements for 90° require each cycle element to be the same, which is impossible because of distinct people.
