Two treeks and one goolee equal one squig:\n   2T + G = S\n\nI can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate G:\n10T = 3(S) + G\nBut since 2T + G = S, I can express G as S - 2T. Substituting this into the equation:\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\nCombining like terms:\n10T + 2T = 4S\n12T = 4S\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n3T = S\n\nSo, one squig weighs the same as three treeks.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, let's break down the given information step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. **Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.**\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n2. **Two treeks and one goolee equal one squig.**\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1: Express \\( G \\) from Equation 2**\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\( G \\) into Equation 1**\n\nPlugging \\( G \\) into Equation 1:\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( T \\) in Terms of \\( S \\)**\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n10T + 2T = 4"
