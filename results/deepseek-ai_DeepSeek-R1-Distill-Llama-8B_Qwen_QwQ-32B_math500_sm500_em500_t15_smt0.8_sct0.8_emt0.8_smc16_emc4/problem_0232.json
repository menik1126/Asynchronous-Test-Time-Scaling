Then, he goes \u00be mile east. Finally, he walks an additional \u00bd mile south.\n\nAdding his southern movements: \u00bd + \u00bd = 1 mile south.\n\nHe does not have any northward movement, so his total south movement is 1 mile.\n\nHis east movement is \u00be mile.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance, I will use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDistance = \u221a(east movement\u00b2 + south movement\u00b2)\nDistance = \u221a((\u00be)\u00b2 + (1)\u00b2)\nDistance = \u221a(0.5625 + 1)\nDistance = \u221a1.5625\nDistance = 1.25 miles.\n\nTherefore, Bill is 1.25 miles away from his starting point.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine Bill's straight-line distance from his starting point by analyzing his movements step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Break Down the Movements\n1. **First Movement**: Bill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile **south**.\n2. **Second Movement**: He then walks \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile **east**.\n3. **Third Movement**: Finally, he walks an additional \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile **south**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Total Distance in Each Direction\n- **Southward (Total)**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} = 1 \\text{ mile south}\n  \\]\n- **Eastward**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile east}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to Find the Straight-Line Distance\nThe straight-line distance can be found using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Eastward Movement})^2 + (\\text{Southward Movement})^2}\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + (1)^2} \n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{0.5625 + 1} \n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance}"
