            "output": "To simplify the expression \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 into the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, I first consider each term individually.\n\nFor the \u221a2 and 1/\u221a2 terms, multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a2 to rationalize the denominator gives (\u221a2)^2/\u221a2 = 2/\u221a2, which simplifies to \u221a2. Similarly, 1/\u221a2 becomes \u221a2/2.\n\nFor the \u221a3 and 1/\u221a3 terms, multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a3 to rationalize the denominator gives \u221a3, which remains as \u221a3, and 1/\u221a3 becomes \u221a3/3.\n\nCombining all the simplified terms, the expression becomes \u221a2 + \u221a3 + \u221a2/2 + \u221a3/3.\n\nNext, I combine the like terms. Grouping the coefficients of \u221a2 and \u221a3 separately, I have (\u221a2 + \u221a2/2) + (\u221a3 + \u221a3/3).\n\nTo add these, I find a common denominator for the coefficients. For \u221a2, the common denominator is 2, so \u221a2 is 2\u221a2/2. Adding 2\u221a2/2 and \u221a2/2 gives 3\u221a2/2.\n\nFor \u221a3, the common denominator is 3, so \u221a3 is 3\u221a3/3. Adding 3\u221a3/3 and \u221a3/3 gives 4\u221a3/3.\n\nCombining both results, the expression simplifies to (3\u221a2/2 + 4\u221a3/3).\n\nTo combine these fractions into a single expression, I find a common denominator for the denominators 2 and 3, which is 6. Multiplying the first fraction by 3/3 and the second by 2/2, I get (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nFinally, I identify a, b, and c from the simplified form. Here, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Adding these values together gives a + b + c = 23.\n</think>\n\nLet's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Step"
