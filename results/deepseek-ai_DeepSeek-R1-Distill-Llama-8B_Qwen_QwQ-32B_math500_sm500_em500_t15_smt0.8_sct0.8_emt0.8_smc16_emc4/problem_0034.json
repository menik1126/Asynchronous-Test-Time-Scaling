            "output": "I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. First, I'll determine the proper divisors of 284. Since 284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. I'll continue factoring 142 by dividing it by 2, resulting in 71. Next, I'll check if 71 is a prime number by testing divisibility with prime numbers up to its square root. Since 71 isn't divisible by any primes, it's a prime itself. Therefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2² × 71¹. Using the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (1 + 2 + 71 + 2×71), I calculate the sum of all divisors: 1 + 2 + 71 + 142 = 216. Finally, I'll find the proper divisors by subtracting 284 from 216, which gives 68. The sum of these proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 17 + 34 = 58.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nWhat is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of \\(284\\)?\n\n**Step 1: Find the Sum of Proper Divisors of 284**\n\n1. **Identify Proper Divisors:**\n   - Proper divisors of an integer \\(N\\) are positive divisors less than \\(N\\).\n   - First, find all proper divisors of 284.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n   - \\(284\\) is even, so divisible by 2.\n   - \\(284 ÷ 2 = 142\\).\n   - \\(142\\) is also even, so divide by 2:\n     - \\(142 ÷ 2 = 71\\).\n   - Check if 71 is prime:\n     - \\(71\\) is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 (since \\(7^2 = 49 < 71\\)).\n     - Therefore, \\(71\\) is a prime number.\n   - **Prime Factorization:** \\(284 = 2^2 × 71^1\\).\n\n3. **Sum of Divisors (σ):**\n   - Formula: \n     \\[\n     σ(n) = (1 + p"
