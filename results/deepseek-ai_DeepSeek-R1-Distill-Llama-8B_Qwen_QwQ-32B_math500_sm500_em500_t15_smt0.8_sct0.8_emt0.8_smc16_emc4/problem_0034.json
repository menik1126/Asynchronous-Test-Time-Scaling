            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all the positive divisors of a number that are less than the number itself.\n\nTo determine the proper divisors of 284, I'll start by finding its prime factors. I know that 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. Since 142 is also even, it can be divided by 2 to yield 71. At this point, I recognize that 71 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71, which is written as 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71\u00b9.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p^0 + p^1 + ... + p^k) for each prime factor p raised to the power k, I can calculate the sum of all divisors of 284. For 2\u00b2, the sum is 1 + 2 + 4, and for 71\u00b9, it's 1 + 71. Multiplying these together gives me (1 + 2 + 4) \u00d7 (1 + 71) = 7 \u00d7 72 = 504.\n\nSince the sum of all divisors includes the number itself (284), I need to subtract 284 to find the sum of the proper divisors. Therefore, 504 - 284 = 220.\n\nNext, I'll find the proper divisors of 220. To do this, I'll first determine its prime factors. 220 can be divided by 2 to give 110, and then by 2 again to give 55. Since 55 is 5 \u00d7 11, the prime factors of 220 are 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b9 \u00d7 11\u00b9.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again, for 2\u00b2, the sum is 1 + 2 + 4, for 5\u00b9 it's 1 + 5, and for 11\u00b9 it's 1 + 11. Multiplying these together gives (1 + 2 + 4) \u00d7 (1 + 5) \u00d7 (1 + 11) = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 12 = 504. Subtracting 220 to find the proper divisors sum, 504 - 220 = 284.\n\nFinally, I'll sum"
