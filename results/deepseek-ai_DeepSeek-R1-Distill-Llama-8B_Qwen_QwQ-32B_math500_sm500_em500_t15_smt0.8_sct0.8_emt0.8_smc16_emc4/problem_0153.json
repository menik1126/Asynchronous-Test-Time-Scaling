I'll square 2.5 and 0.7, then subtract the two results. This will give me the value inside the square root, which I'll then simplify.\n\nNext, I'll address the denominator by subtracting 2.5 from 2.7. This will provide a straightforward subtraction that's easy to handle.\n\nFinally, I'll substitute these computed values back into the expression. The numerator will have the square root of the result from the first calculation, and the denominator will have the result from the second calculation. This will allow me to compute the overall value of the expression and present it in a simplified form.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2.5^2 - 0.7^2}}{2.7 - 2.5}\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the values inside the square root (numerator):**\n   \n   \\[\n   2.5^2 = 6.25\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   0.7^2 = 0.49\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   6.25 - 0.49 = 5.76\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the numerator becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{5.76} = 2.4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the denominator:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2.7 - 2.5 = 0.2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the calculated values back into the expression:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{2.4}{0.2} = 12\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
