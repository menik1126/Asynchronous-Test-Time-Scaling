Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe polynomial is given as:\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\nIt has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. We're told that $a_n = 2$ and $a_0 = 66$. The question is asking for the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$.\n\nOkay, so let's break this down. First, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, it must be monic or have leading coefficient 2, but since $a_n = 2$, it's not monic. Wait, actually, it's given that $a_n = 2$, so the leading coefficient is 2. Hmm, but usually, polynomials with integer coefficients and integer roots can be expressed as a product of binomials with integer roots. So, if the leading coefficient is 2, that complicates things a bit because 2 is a prime, so the roots might have to be factors of the constant term, but considering the leading coefficient.\n\nLet me recall that for a polynomial with integer coefficients, the constant term is the product of the roots (up to a sign, depending on the degree). Since the constant term is 66, which is positive, and the leading coefficient is 2, which is positive, the polynomial must have an even degree because the constant term's sign is same as the leading coefficient when the degree is even. Wait, no—actually, the sign depends on the number of negative roots. But regardless, the product of the roots is $a_0 / a_n = 66 / 2 = 33$. So the product of the roots is 33.\n\nBut 33 is a positive number, which means the number of negative roots must be even because the product of an even number of negative numbers is positive. So, possible scenarios: all roots are positive, or two roots are negative and the rest positive.\n\nBut also, the polynomial has distinct integer roots. So, we need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33, and then construct the polynomial, and then find the coefficient $a_{n-1}$, which is the coefficient of $"

            "output": "x^{n-1}$, and find its minimal absolute value.\n\nWait, actually, the coefficient $a_{n-1}$ is related to the sum of the roots, but with a sign. Let me recall Vieta's formula. For a monic polynomial, the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ is the negative of the sum of the roots. But here, the polynomial is not monic; the leading coefficient is 2. So, the general formula is that the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ is $-a_n$ times the sum of the roots divided by $a_n$? Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nSuppose the polynomial is written as $2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n)$. Then expanding this, the leading term is $2x^n$, and the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ would be $-2(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)$. Therefore, $a_{n-1} = -2 \\times \\text{sum of roots}$. Therefore, the absolute value of $a_{n-1}$ is $2 \\times |\\text{sum of roots}|$. So, to minimize $|a_{n-1}|$, we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Since the product of the roots is 33, we need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 and whose sum has the smallest possible absolute value.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: find distinct integers $r_1, r_2, ..., r_n$ such that their product is 33, and the sum $S = r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n$ has the smallest possible absolute value. Then, the minimal $|a_{n-1}|$ would be $2|S|$, so we need to minimize $|S|$.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find such a set of integers with product 33 and minimal sum. Since 33 factors into primes as 3 × 11. So, the factors of 33 are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33. Since the roots have to be distinct integers, we can't repeat any factors. So, we need to split 33 into a product of distinct integers (positive"

Alternatively, we can have all positive factors, but in that case, their product is positive. However, 33 has prime factors 3 and 11, but given that it's a small number, it might not have many factors. So, let's think about how to write 33 as a product of distinct integers.\n\nPossible factorizations into distinct integers:\n\nCase 1: All positive.\n\nSince 33 is 3 × 11, and these are primes, we can't split it further. So, the possible sets of roots are {1, 3, 11, 33} but wait, 1 × 3 × 11 × 33 = way more than 33. Wait, no. Wait, hold on. If all roots are positive, then we have to consider all of them multiplying to 33. So, since 33 = 1 × 3 × 11, that's three factors. So, if n=3, but n can be higher? Because 33 can be written as products of more numbers if we include 1s and -1s.\n\nWait, but 1s don't change the product but add to the sum. So, to minimize the sum, probably using 1s and -1s is a good idea. Let's think.\n\nCase 2: Including negative numbers.\n\nSince the product must be positive (33), the number of negative roots must be even. So, if we have 2 negative roots and the rest positive, that could help in reducing the sum.\n\nSo, let's try to factor 33 into distinct integers, with an even number of negative factors.\n\nFirst, let's note that 33 can be written as:\n\n- 1, -1, 3, 11: product is 33, with two negative numbers.\n\nBut 1, -1, 3, 11: product is 1 * (-1) * 3 * 11 = -33. Hmm, that's -33. So, if I include another negative number, to make the product positive.\n\nWait, but if I have two negative numbers, their product is positive, so if I take 1, -1, -3, 11: product"
