The problem gives me three sums: the sum of the first n terms is 96, the sum of their squares is 144, and the sum of their cubes is 216. I need to find the sum of all possible values of n. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n- \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n- \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nI need to find all possible values of n and sum them up. \n\nI remember that in problems involving sums of powers, sometimes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities come into play. Also, for sequences where each term is the same, like all a_i equal, those might be the simplest cases. Maybe I should check if all a_i are equal. If they are, then we can use that to find n.\n\nSo, let's assume all a_i are equal, say a_i = a for all i. Then:\n\nSum: \\( n \\cdot a = 96 \\) \u2192 \\( a = 96/n \\)\n\nSum of squares: \\( n \\cdot a^2 = 144 \\) \u2192 \\( a^2 = 144/n \\)\n\nSum of cubes: \\( n \\cdot a^3 = 216 \\) \u2192 \\( a^3 = 216/n \\)\n\nSo, let's see if these are consistent. From the first equation, a = 96/n. Let's plug this into the second equation:\n\n\\( (96/n)^2 = 144/n \\)\n\nSo, \\( 9216/n\u00b2 = 144/n \\)\n\nMultiplying both sides by n\u00b2:\n\n9216 = 144n\n\nSo, n = 9216 / 144 = 64.\n\nHmm, okay, so if n is 64, then all a_i are equal, and each a_i is 96/64 = 1.5.\n\nLet's check the third equation to see if this holds:\n\na\u00b3 = (1.5)\u00b3 = 3.375\n\nThen, sum of cubes would be n * 3.375 = 64 * 3.375\n\nCalculating that: 64 *"

So n=64 works with all a_i equal to 1.5.\n\nSo, 64 is a possible value of n.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n.\" So, is n=64 the only possible value? Or are there other n's where the sums hold, even if the a_i aren't all equal?\n\nHmm, I need to check if there are other possibilities where the sums can be achieved with different a_i's.\n\nI remember that for the sums to be consistent, there's a relationship between the sums of powers. Maybe I can use some inequality here.\n\nCauchy-Schwarz says that (sum a_i^2)(sum 1^2) >= (sum a_i)^2. Let's see.\n\nGiven sum a_i = 96, sum a_i^2 =144.\n\nSo, (144)(n) >= 96\u00b2\n\nCalculate 96\u00b2: 96*96=9216\n\nThus, 144n >=9216 \u2192 n >= 9216/144=64\n\nSo, n>=64.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of cubes is 216. Maybe we can use H\u00f6lder's inequality or some other inequality to find more constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the power mean inequality.\n\nThe power mean inequality states that for positive real numbers,\n\n( (sum a_i^k)/(n) )^(1/k) is non-decreasing with k.\n\nSo, the mean of the first power is 96/n, the mean of the second power is 144/n, the mean of the third power is 216/n.\n\nSo, according to the power mean inequality:\n\n( (sum a_i)/n ) <= ( (sum a_i\u00b2)/n )^(1/2) <= ( (sum a_i\u00b3)/n )^(1/3 )\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\nLeft side: 96/n\n\nMiddle: sqrt(144/n)\n\nRight: (216/n)^(1/3)\n\nSo, the inequality is:\n\n96/n <= sqrt(144/n) <= (216/n)^(1/3)\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nFirst, 96/n <= sqrt(144/n)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(96/n)^2 <= 144/n\n\nSo, 9216/n\u00b2 <="

But the problem says \"sum of all possible values of n,\" implying there might be more?\n\nWait, maybe there are other sequences where the terms are not all equal but still satisfy the given sums. Let me think.\n\nSuppose that some of the a_i are different. Let me consider the case where there are two different values. Let's say there are k terms equal to a and (n -k) terms equal to b. Then, maybe we can set up equations.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me suppose that there are two different terms, a and b, with multiplicities k and n -k respectively.\n\nThen:\n\nSum: ka + (n -k)b =96\n\nSum of squares: ka\u00b2 + (n -k)b\u00b2 =144\n\nSum of cubes: ka\u00b3 + (n -k)b\u00b3 =216\n\nWe can try to solve these equations for a, b, k, n.\n\nHmm, this might be complicated, but let's see.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet me let x = a, y = b,"

But how do we know if the third power sum can be achieved?\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to have n>64 with some terms higher and some lower, but keeping the sum of cubes at 216.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another case where all but one terms are equal, and one term is different.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSuppose that n terms consist of (n-1) terms equal to a, and one term equal to b.\n\nThen:\n\nSum: (n-1)a + b =96 ...(1)\n\nSum of squares: (n-1)a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =144 ...(2)\n\nSum of cubes: (n-1)a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 =216 ...(3)\n\nLet me try to solve these equations for a, b, and n.\n\nLet me denote equations (1), (2), (3).\n\nFrom equation (1): b =96 - (n-1)a ...(1a)\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\n(n-1)a\u00b2 + [96 - (n-1)a]^2 =144\n\nExpand the square term:\n\n(n-1)a\u00b2 + [96\u00b2 - 2*96*(n-1)a + (n-1)^2 a\u00b2] =144\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(n-1)a\u00b2 + 9216 - 192(n-1)a + (n-1)^2 a\u00b2 =144\n\nCombine the a\u00b2 terms:\n\n[(n-1) + (n-1)^2]a\u00b2 -192(n-1)a +9216 -144 =0\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\n(n-1)(1 +n -1)a\u00b2 -192(n-1)a +9072=0\n\nWait, (n-1) + (n-1)^2 = (n-"
