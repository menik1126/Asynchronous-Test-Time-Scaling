Also, I know that P(11) = 181, and I need to find P(16). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, I can express it in the general form: P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real coefficients that I need to determine.\n\nNow, the problem gives me two inequalities that P(x) must satisfy. The first one is that P(x) is at least as big as x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 for all x. In other words, for every real number x, ax\u00b2 + bx + c \u2265 x\u00b2 - 2x + 2.\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality is that P(x) is at most 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for all x, so ax\u00b2 + bx + c \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for all real x.\n\nSo, if I subtract (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) from P(x), I get: (a - 1)x\u00b2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) \u2265 0 for all x.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting (2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3) from P(x) gives: (a - 2)x\u00b2 + (b + 4)x + (c - 3) \u2264 0 for all x.\n\nNow, since these are quadratics that must be non-negative and non-positive for all x, respectively, the only way this can happen is if each quadratic is a perfect square or always non-negative or non-positive, but since quadratics can open upwards or downwards, we need to analyze their discriminants and leading coefficients.\n\nLet me consider the first inequality: (a - 1)x\u00b2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) \u2265 0 for all x. For this quadratic to be non-negative for all x, the leading coefficient (a - 1) must be non-negative, and the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero.\n\nSimilarly, for the second inequality: (a - 2)x"

For this quadratic to be non-positive for all x, the leading coefficient (a - 2) must be non-positive, and the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero.\n\nSo, let me write down these conditions:\n\n1. Leading coefficients:\n   - For the first inequality: a - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 a \u2265 1\n   - For the second inequality: a - 2 \u2264 0 \u21d2 a \u2264 2\n\nSo, a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 2.\n\n2. Discriminants:\n\nFor the first inequality, the discriminant D1 must be \u2264 0:\nD1 = (b + 2)\u00b2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) \u2264 0\n\nFor the second inequality, discriminant D2 must be \u2264 0:\nD2 = (b + 4)\u00b2 - 4*(a - 2)*(c - 3) \u2264 0\n\nSo, now I have four conditions:\n- 1 \u2264 a \u2264 2\n- D1 \u2264 0\n- D2 \u2264 0\n\nAnd I can write these as:\n\n1. 1 \u2264 a \u2264 2\n2. (b + 2)\u00b2 - 4(a - 1)(c - 2) \u2264 0\n3. (b + 4)\u00b2 - 4(a - 2)(c - 3) \u2264 0\n\nAdditionally, I know that P(11) = 181. Plugging x=11 into P(x) gives:\n\nP(11) = a*(11)^2 + b*(11) + c = 181\nSo, 121a + 11b + c = 181.\n\nThus, I have a system of equations and inequalities. This seems a bit involved, but maybe I can express everything in terms of a, b, and c and find possible values.\n\nBut before that, let me see if I can find more constraints. Since both inequalities must hold for all x, and these quadratics must be non-negative and non-positive, perhaps they have only a double root, meaning discriminant equals zero.\n\nWait, but if the discriminant is zero, then the quadratic is a perfect square and touches the x-axis at one point.

Maybe the polynomial P(x) is exactly equal to the lower bound or upper bound at some points?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(x) is sandwiched between the two quadratics, so the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is a non-negative quadratic, and the difference between the upper bound and P(x) is also a non-negative quadratic. Therefore, both differences must be perfect squares? Not necessarily, but their discriminants must be non-positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal case is when both inequalities are tight at some points, so that the quadratic P(x) touches both the lower and upper bounds at some points. That might give us equations to solve for a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic P(x) is a linear combination of the lower and upper bounds? Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the lower bound as L(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and the upper bound as U(x) = 2x\u00b2 -4x +3. Then, since L(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 U(x) for all x, perhaps P(x) is equal to L(x) plus some non-negative quadratic, and also equal to U(x) minus some non-negative quadratic. But since P(x) is quadratic, those added terms must also be quadratic. Hmm, maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference between U(x) and L(x) is another quadratic, and P(x) is somewhere in between. Let me compute U(x) - L(x):\n\nU(x) - L(x) = (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - (x\u00b2 -2x +2) = x\u00b2 -2x +1 = (x -1)^2.\n\nAh! That's interesting.

Let me compute L(1) and U(1):\n\nL(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1.\n\nU(1) = 2 - 4 + 3 = 1.\n\nSo both L(1) and U(1) equal to 1. So P(1) must also be 1, because P(1) is between L(1) and U(1), but since both are equal to 1, P(1) must be 1.\n\nWait, that's not necessarily true. P(1) is between L(1) and U(1), but if L(1)=U(1)=1, then P(1) must equal 1. So P(1)=1.\n\nThat's a useful point.\n\nSo, now, P(1)=1, so plugging into P(x)=ax\u00b2 +bx +c:\n\na*(1)^2 + b*(1) + c =1 \u21d2 a + b + c=1.\n\nAnd we also have P(11)=181: 121a +11b +c=181.\n\nAlso, we have the inequalities earlier.\n\nAdditionally, from the equality that U(x) - L(x) = (x-1)^2, which is a perfect square, this suggests that the quadratics P(x) is between them must satisfy that the difference is some multiple of (x-1)^2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differences D(x) = P(x) - L(x) and E(x) = U(x) - P(x) must both be non-negative quadratics with double roots at x=1. Because the difference between U and L is (x-1)^2, which is a perfect square. If P(x) is squeezed between L(x) and U(x) such that P(x) = L(x) + k*(x -1)^2 and also P(x) = U(x) - k*(x -1)^2, then k would have to be 1.\n\nWait, that might make sense.

But since the inequalities must hold for all x, then perhaps P(x) must be exactly L(x) + k*(x -1)^2 where k is a constant between 0 and 1. But since P(x) is quadratic, this would work. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P(x) is exactly halfway between L(x) and U(x). Let me check:\n\nThe average of L(x) and U(x) would be (L(x) + U(x))/2 = (x\u00b2 -2x +2 + 2x\u00b2 -4x +3)/2 = (3x\u00b2 -6x +5)/2.

So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm, so maybe the idea of P(x) being a linear combination of L(x) and U(x) with some coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal and maximal cases occur at x=1, since that's where L and U touch. Since P(1)=1, and the difference between U and L is (x-1)^2, which is zero at x=1, so that's the point where the two bounds meet.\n\nPerhaps P(x) must touch both L(x) and U(x) at x=1, meaning that P(x) is tangent to both L(x) and U(x) at x=1. Wait, but L(x) and U(x) are themselves different quadratics except at x=1. Let me see.\n\nWait, L(x) and U(x) only touch at x=1, since their difference is (x-1)^2, so they are equal only at x=1.

Let me try this. Let me define P(x) = L(x) + k(x -1)^2.

Wait, no, that's incorrect because 1.8 is 2 -0.2, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, 1.8 is 9/5, so 1.8*256 = (9/5)*256= (256/5)*9=51.2*9=460.8. That is correct.\n\nSimilarly, 3.6*16=57.6, so yes, -57.6.\n\nAnd 460.8 -57.6=403.2, 403.2 +2.8=406.\n\nHence, P(16)=406.\n\nSo, after all that, the answer should be 406.\n</think>\n\nThe quadratic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is determined by setting \\( P(x) = U(x) - k(x - 1)^2 \\) with \\( k = 0.2 \\), leading to \\( P(x) = 1.8x^2 - 3"
