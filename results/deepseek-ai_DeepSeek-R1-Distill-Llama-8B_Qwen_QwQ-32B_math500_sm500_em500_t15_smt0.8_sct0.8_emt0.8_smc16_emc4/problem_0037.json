Since 284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2.\n\n284 divided by 2 equals 142. So, 2 is a prime factor.\n\nNext, I'll check if 142 can be further factorized. Dividing 142 by 2 gives 71, which is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71 to the first power.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p\u2070 + p\u00b9) for each prime factor, I'll calculate the sum of all divisors of 284.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, the sum of its powers is 1 + 2 = 3.\nFor the prime factor 71, the sum of its powers is 1 + 71 = 72.\n\nMultiplying these together gives a total sum of divisors equal to 3 \u00d7 72 = 216.\n\nSince the sum of all divisors includes the number itself, the sum of the proper divisors is 216 minus 284, which equals 68.\n\nNext, I'll find the sum of the proper divisors of 68.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 68. Since it's even, it's divisible by 2.\n\n68 divided by 2 equals 34. So, 2 is a prime factor.\n\nNext, I'll check if 34 can be factorized further. Dividing 34 by 2 gives 17, which is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 68 is 2 squared multiplied by 17 to the first power.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors again, I'll calculate the sum of all divisors of 68.\n\nFor the prime factor 2, the sum of its powers is 1 + 2 = 3.\nFor the prime factor 17, the sum of its powers is 1 + 17 = 18.\n\nMultiplying these together gives a total sum of divisors equal to 3 \u00d7 18 = 54.\n\nSince the sum of all divisors includes the number itself, the sum of the proper divisors is 54 minus 68, which equals -14.\n\nHowever, the sum of proper div"
