For 284, I'll list all its divisors starting from 1 and check which ones divide 284 without leaving a remainder.\n\nAfter determining that the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142, I'll sum these values together to get the sum of the proper divisors.\n\nOnce I have the sum of the proper divisors of 284, I'll find the sum of its proper divisors, which will be a new number. Finally, I'll calculate the sum of the proper divisors of this new number to find the final answer.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to find the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### **Step 1: Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n\nA **proper divisor** of a number \\( N \\) is a positive integer that divides \\( N \\) without leaving a remainder, excluding \\( N \\) itself.\n\n- **Finding proper divisors of 284:**\n  - Start with 1 (since 1 divides every number).\n  - Check divisibility by 2: \\( 284 \\div 2 = 142 \\) → 2 and 142 are divisors.\n  - Check divisibility by 3: \\( 284 \\div 3 \\approx 94.666 \\) → Not divisible by 3.\n  - Check divisibility by 4: \\( 284 \\div 4 = 71 \\) → 4 and 71 are divisors.\n  - 71 is a prime number, so there are no more divisors beyond 71.\n\n- **Proper divisors of 284:**\n  \\[\n  1,\\ 2,\\ 4,\\ 71,\\ 142\n  \\]\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Find the proper divisors of 220.**\n\n- **Finding proper divisors of 220:**\n  - 1 (since"
