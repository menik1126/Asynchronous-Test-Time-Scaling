            "output": "I need to determine the volume of a cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius has been made by removing metal from its corners.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the volume of the steel sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Given the radius is 3 inches, the volume of the sphere is (4/3)\u03c0(3)\u00b3.\n\nNext, since the sphere is formed by removing material from the cube, the volume of the cube will be equal to the volume of the sphere plus the volume removed from the corners. The volume removed can be calculated by considering that each corner of a cube is a right-angled tetrahedron with legs equal to the side length of the cube.\n\nAssuming the cube has an edge length 's', the volume removed from one corner is (s\u00b3)/6. Since a cube has 8 corners, the total volume removed is 8*(s\u00b3)/6.\n\nTo find the edge length 's' of the cube, I'll set up the equation: Volume of the cube (s\u00b3) = Volume of the sphere + Volume removed. Substituting the known values, I get s\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(3)\u00b3 + 8*(s\u00b3)/6.\n\nSolving for 's', I simplify the equation step by step, eventually solving for s\u00b3 to find the volume of the cube.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from its corners, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the sphere.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Given that the radius \\( r = 3 \\) inches:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (27) = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand how the sphere is formed from the cube.**\n   \n   The sphere is created by cutting off each corner (vertex) of the cube.

However, since the sphere must fit perfectly inside the cube, the sphere's diameter must equal the space diagonal of the cube minus twice the length removed from each corner.\n\n3. **Relate the sphere's diameter to the cube's space diagonal.**\n   \n   The sphere's diameter is \\( 2r = 6 \\) inches. The space diagonal of the original cube (before removing corners) is \\( s\\sqrt{3} \\). However, removing material from the corners reduces the effective space diagonal. The remaining space diagonal after cutting must equal the sphere's diameter:\n   \\[\n   s\\sqrt{3} - 2x\\sqrt{3} = 6\n   \\]\n   \n   Here, \\( x \\) is the length removed from each corner along each edge. Since all corners are cut symmetrically, the total reduction in each edge is \\( 2x \\), so the remaining edge length is \\( s - 2x \\). However, the sphere must also fit within the cube's edges, so the sphere's diameter must also equal the edge length of the cube minus twice the cut length:\n   \\[\n   s - 2x = 6\n   \\]\n   \n   Solving these equations simultaneously:\n   \\[\n   s\\sqrt{3} - 2x\\sqrt{3} = 6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s - 2x = 6\n   \\]\n   \n   Let \\( s - 2x = 6 \\), so \\( 2x = s - 6 \\). Substitute into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   s\\sqrt{3} - (s - 6)\\sqrt{3} = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s\\sqrt{3} - s\\sqrt{3} + 6\\sqrt{3} = 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6\\sqrt{3} = 6\n   \\]\n   \n   This simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{3} = 1 \\), which is impossible. This indicates an error in the assumption. Instead, consider that the sphere must fit entirely within the cube, so the sphere's diameter (6 inches) must equal the cube's edge length \\( s \\).
