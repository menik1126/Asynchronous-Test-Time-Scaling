            "output": "First, I need to understand the original expression: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. Without parentheses, it equals 13. The goal is to find the minimum possible value by adding parentheses in various locations without changing the order of the terms.\n\nTo minimize the result, I should try to maximize the subtraction of larger numbers. This means grouping larger positive numbers together so that their sum is subtracted later. I'll look for places where I can form larger subtrahends.\n\nLooking at the expression, if I group 4 and 5 together, I get 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6. Calculating this gives 6 - 9 + 6, which equals 3. This is a lower value than the original 13.\n\nTo see if I can get an even lower result, I'll try other groupings. If I group 3 and 4, the expression becomes 1 + 2 - (3 + 4) + 5 + 6. This simplifies to 3 - 7 + 11, which equals 7. This is higher than 3, so it's not better.\n\nAnother option is to group 2, 3, and 4. This gives 1 + (2 + 3 + 4) - 5 + 6. This simplifies to 1 + 9 - 5 + 6, which totals 11. Again, higher than 3.\n\nFinally, grouping 5 and 6 together results in 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + (5 + 6). This simplifies to 6 - 4 + 11, which equals 13. This isn't lower than 3.\n\nAfter evaluating these groupings, the minimum value obtained is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo find the minimum possible value of the expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\) by adding parentheses, we need to strategically place parentheses to alter the order of operations without rearranging the terms. The goal is to maximize the impact of subtraction to minimize the result.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Key Terms for Grouping**\nTo minimize the value, group larger positive numbers so their sum is subtracted later.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Parentheses**\nLet's group the numbers to form larger subtrahends:\n"

    "question": "The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)\n\nEnter your answer as a single value."
