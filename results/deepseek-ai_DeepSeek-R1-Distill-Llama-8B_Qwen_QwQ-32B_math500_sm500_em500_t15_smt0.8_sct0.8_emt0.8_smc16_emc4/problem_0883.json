Dividing by 2 repeatedly, I get \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5\\).\n\nNext, I'll factorize the numerator, 57. Dividing by 3 gives me \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\).\n\nSince the numerator has prime factors other than 2 and 5, the fraction cannot be simplified to have a denominator that is only composed of 2s and 5s. Therefore, it cannot be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n\nI'll proceed to convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 57 by 160. Performing the division gives me approximately 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Condition for a Terminating Decimal:**\n   A fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will have a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\(b\\), after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n2. **Factorize the Denominator:**\n   Let's factorize the denominator 160 to check if it meets the condition.\n   \\[\n   160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^5 \\times 5\n   \\]\n   Here, 160 has prime factors 2 and 5, which are acceptable for a terminating decimal.\n\n3. **Check the Numerator:**\n   Since the denominator already meets the criteria and the fraction is already in its lowest terms (as 57 and 160 share no common factors other than 1), we proceed to convert it to a decimal.\n\n4. **Perform the Division:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n   \\]\n   - **Step 1:** Divide 57 by 160.\n   - **Step 2:** Multiply 0.35625 by 160 to verify:\n     \\[\n     0.35625 \\times 160 = 57\n     \\]\n   \n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The decimal representation terminates after 5 places.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
