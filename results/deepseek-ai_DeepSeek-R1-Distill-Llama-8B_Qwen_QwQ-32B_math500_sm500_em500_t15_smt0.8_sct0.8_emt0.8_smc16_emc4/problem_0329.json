This can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the boys is C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 4 available using the same combination formula: C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to form the group, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls: 35 * 6 = 210.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose the boys\nMr. Brennan has 7 boys, and he wants to choose 3 of them. This is a combination problem because the order in which the boys are chosen does not matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values for the boys:\n\\[ C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[ C(7, 3) = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35 \\]\n\nSo, there are **35** ways to choose the boys.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose the girls\nMr. Brennan has 4 girls, and he wants to choose 2 of them. Again, this is a combination problem.\n\nUsing the combination formula for the girls:\n\\[ C(4, "
