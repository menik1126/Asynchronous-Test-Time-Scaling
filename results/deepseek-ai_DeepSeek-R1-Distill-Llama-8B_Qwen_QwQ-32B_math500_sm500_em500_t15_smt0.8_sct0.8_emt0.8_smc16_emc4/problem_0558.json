Looking at the chart, the 70s decade includes Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain, each with a quantity of 12, 12, 6, and 13 stamps respectively.\n\nNext, I'll determine the total number of 70s stamps by adding these quantities together: 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 equals 43 stamps.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the total cost for all the 70s stamps. Brazil and France stamps cost $6$ cents each, so that's 12 * 6 = 72 cents for Brazil and 12 * 6 = 72 cents for France. Peru stamps cost $4$ cents each, so 6 * 4 = 24 cents for Peru. Spain stamps cost $5$ cents each, so 13 * 5 = 65 cents for Spain. Adding these together, the total cost is 72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233 cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per 70s stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the number of 70s stamps: 233 / 43 ≈ 5.418 cents. Rounding to the nearest tenth gives an average price of approximately 5.4 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Decade and Countries:**\n   - **70s** decade includes stamps from Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain.\n\n2. **List the Prices for Each Country:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\$6 per stamp\n   - **France:** \\$6 per stamp\n   - **Peru:** \\$4 per stamp\n   - **Spain:** \\$5 per stamp\n\n3. **Find the Quantity of Each Stamp:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 stamps\n   - **France:** 12 stamps\n   - **Peru:** 6 stamps\n   - **Spain:** 13 stamps\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\, (\\text{Brazil}) + 12 \\, (\\text{France}) + 6 \\, (\\text{Peru}) + 13 \\, (\\text{Spain}) = 43 \\, \\text{stamps}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate"

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
