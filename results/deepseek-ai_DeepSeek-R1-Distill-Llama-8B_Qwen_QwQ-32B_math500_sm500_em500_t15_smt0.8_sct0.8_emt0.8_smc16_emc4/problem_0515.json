            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the expression (1 + sqrt(2)) divided by (2 + sqrt(3)). The goal is to express it in a specific form: A(1 + sqrt(B)) minus (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)), where A, B, C, and D are positive integers. Then, I have to find the sum A + B + C + D.\n\nHmm, let's start by understanding the problem. It's about rationalizing a denominator, which is a common technique in algebra. The expression has a denominator with a square root, so the first thought is to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the square root. \n\nThe conjugate of (2 + sqrt(3)) is (2 - sqrt(3)). So, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by (2 - sqrt(3)) to rationalize it. Let me write that down:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2)) * (2 - sqrt(3)) / [(2 + sqrt(3))(2 - sqrt(3))]\n\nNow, I need to carry out this multiplication both in the numerator and the denominator. Let's first work on the denominator because it might simplify quickly.\n\nIn the denominator, (a + b)(a - b) equals a² - b². So, applying that here:\n\n(2)^2 - (sqrt(3))^2 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nAlright, so the denominator simplifies to 1, which makes things easier.\n\nNow, moving on to the numerator. I need to compute (1 + sqrt(2)) multiplied by (2 - sqrt(3)). I'll use the distributive property (FOIL method) to expand this.\n\nFirst, multiply 1 by 2, which is 2.\n\nThen, 1 multiplied by (-sqrt(3)) gives -sqrt(3).\n\nNext, sqrt(2) multiplied by 2 is 2sqrt(2).\n\nFinally, sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(3)) gives -sqrt(6).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the numerator becomes:\n\n2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6)\n\nSince the denominator is 1, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6)\n\nNow, the goal is to express"

I can group the constants and the terms with sqrt together.\n\nLet me factor out the 2 from the terms involving sqrt(2). Wait, but 2 is also present as a constant term. Hmm, maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express it as A(1 + sqrt(B)) minus another expression involving sqrt terms. So, let's see.\n\nLooking at 2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6), maybe I can write this as (2 + 2sqrt(2)) minus (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)). So, that would look like 2(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)).\n\nYes, that works! So, let's break it down:\n\nFirst, I can factor 2 out of the terms 2 and 2sqrt(2), which gives 2*(1 + sqrt(2)).\n\nThen, the remaining terms, -sqrt(3) - sqrt(6), can be written as -(sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)).\n\nSo, putting it together, the expression becomes:\n\n2*(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6))\n\nComparing this to the desired form A(1 + sqrt(B)) - (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)), we can see:\n\nA = 2, B = 2, C = 3, D = 6.\n\nTherefore, A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6. Let's compute that:\n\n2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 3 = 7, 7 + 6 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems correct? Or did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, we started with (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)). We multiplied numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(3)) to get:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(3)) / (4 - 3) = (1 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt("

That's correct.\n\nThen, grouping terms as 2 + 2sqrt(2) gives 2(1 + sqrt(2)), and the rest is -sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) which is -(sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)). So, the expression is indeed 2(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)). \n\nTherefore, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6. Adding them up: 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13. \n\nHmm, but let me check if there's another way to represent it. Maybe the problem expects different groupings? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the expression in a different form where the terms are arranged differently. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I tried to write it as A(1 + sqrt(B)) minus (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)), but maybe A is different?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me check the problem again. The question says \"Your solution can be converted to the form A(1+√B)−(√C+√D)\". So, the first term is A multiplied by (1 + sqrt(B)), and then subtract the sum of two square roots. \n\nIn my current expression, I have 2*(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)). So that's exactly matching the form with A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. So that should be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to write it with different constants? Let me see.\n\nSuppose I tried to factor something else. For instance, maybe the sqrt(6) can be written as sqrt(2*3), but I don't think that helps here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the terms in a different order? Let me see.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the form A(1+√B"

            "turn": 2,

            "output": ")−(√C+√D)\". So, the first term is A*(1 + sqrt(B)), and the second term is -(sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)). So, in my case, it's 2*(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, suppose if I had decided to write it differently, but I think 2, 2, 3, 6 are the correct values. Let me recheck the initial calculation.\n\nStarting expression: (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)).\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(3)) gives:\n\n[(1)(2) + (1)(-sqrt(3)) + (sqrt(2))(2) + (sqrt(2))(-sqrt(3))] / [ (2)^2 - (sqrt(3))^2 ]\n\nWhich is (2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6)) / 1, so 2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6).\n\nNow, arranging the constants and the radicals:\n\n2 + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(3) - sqrt(6). \n\nWhich can be written as 2*(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)). \n\nTherefore, A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. So, their sum is 2+2+3+6=13.\n\nI think that's correct.
