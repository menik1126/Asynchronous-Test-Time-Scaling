Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with equations involving cubes, sometimes it's helpful to see if there's a pattern or if something can be simplified. Maybe I can expand both sides and see what happens.\n\nLet me write down the equation again for clarity:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, I notice that \\(2x - 10\\) is the same as \\(2(x - 5)\\). That might be useful later, but I'm not sure yet. Maybe I should try expanding all the terms.\n\nStarting with the left side: \\((x - 3)^3\\). I know the formula for \\((a - b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3\\). Let me apply that:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\n\\]\nSimilarly, for \\((x - 7)^3\\):\n\\[\n(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\n\\]\nSo adding those two together:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)\n\\]\nLet me combine like terms:\n- \\(x^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\\)\n- \\(-9x^2 - 21x^2 = -30x^2\\)\n- \\(27x + 147x = 174x\\)\n- \\(-27 - 343 = -370\\)\n\nSo the left side simplifies to:\n\\[\n2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370\n\\]\n\nNow, the right side is \\((2x - 10)^3\\). Let me expand that using the same cube formula:\n"

Let me subtract the right side from both sides to set it equal to zero:\n\\[\n2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n- \\(2x^3 - 8x^3 = -6x^3\\)\n- \\(-30x^2 + 120x^2 = 90x^2\\)\n- \\(174x - 600x = -426x\\)\n- \\(-370 + 1000 = 630\\)\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0\n\\]\nHmm, that's a cubic equation. Solving cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor out a common factor first. Let me check if all coefficients are divisible by a common number.\n\nLooking at the coefficients: -6, 90, -426, 630. I notice that 6 is a common factor, right?
