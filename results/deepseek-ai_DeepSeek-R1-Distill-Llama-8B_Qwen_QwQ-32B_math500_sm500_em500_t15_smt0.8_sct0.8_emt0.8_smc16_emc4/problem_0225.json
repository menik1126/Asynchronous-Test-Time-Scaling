Next, he walks 3/4 mile east.\n\nAfter calculating his total displacement south and east, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point. Specifically, the distance will be the square root of the sum of the squares of the south and east distances.\n\nFinally, I'll express the result as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth of a mile.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total South Displacement**\n\nBill walks:\n- \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n- Then another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n\n**Total South Distance:** \n\\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate East Displacement**\n\nBill walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n\n**East Distance:** \n\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Straight-Line Distance Using Pythagoras' Theorem**\n\nImagine a right-angled triangle where:\n- The horizontal leg (east) is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile.\n- The vertical leg (south) is \\( 1 \\) mile.\n\nThe straight-line distance (direct line) from the starting point to Bill's final position can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{East Distance})^2 + (\\text{South Distance})^2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + (1)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.25}\n\\]"
