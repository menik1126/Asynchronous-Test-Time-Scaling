The area of a circle is given by the formula πr².\n\nThe largest circle has a radius of 7, so its area is π × 7² = 49π.\n\nThe middle circle has a radius of 6, so its area is π × 6² = 36π.\n\nThe smallest circle has a radius of 4, so its area is π × 4² = 16π.\n\nNext, I'll determine the areas of the regions X, Y, and Z.\n\nRegion Y is the area between the middle and smallest circles: 36π – 16π = 20π.\n\nRegion X is the area between the largest and middle circles: 49π – 36π = 13π.\n\nRegion Z is the area between the largest and smallest circles: 49π – 16π = 33π.\n\nFinally, I'll identify which region has the greatest area and which has the smallest area.\n\nThe greatest area is 33π, which is Region Z.\n\nThe smallest area is 13π, which is Region X.\n\nThe difference between the greatest and smallest areas is 33π – 13π = 20π.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Three concentric circles with radii 4, 6, and 7.\n- Regions labeled \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\) are formed by the overlapping areas of these circles.\n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n\n1. **Calculate the area of each circle.**\n   - Area of the largest circle (radius 7): \\( \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi \\)\n   - Area of the middle circle (radius 6): \\( \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi \\)\n   - Area of the smallest circle (radius 4): \\( \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\)\n\n2. **Determine the area of each region.**\n   - **Region \\(Y\\):** Area between the middle and smallest circles.\n     \\[\n     Y = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Region \\(X\\):** Area between the largest and middle circles.\n     \\[\n     X = 49\\pi - 36\\pi"
