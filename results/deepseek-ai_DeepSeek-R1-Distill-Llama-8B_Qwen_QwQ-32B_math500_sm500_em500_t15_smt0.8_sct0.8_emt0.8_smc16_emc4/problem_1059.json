            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since it's a regular hexagon, all its sides are equal, with each side measuring 16 cm. A regular hexagon has six sides, so the perimeter is 6 multiplied by 16 cm.\n\nNext, I need to find the perimeter of the regular octagon. The problem states that the perimeters of both the hexagon and the octagon are equal. Therefore, I can set the perimeter of the octagon equal to the perimeter of the hexagon and solve for the length of its sides.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the side length of the octagon as \\( x \\) cm. The perimeter of the octagon is then \\( 8x \\) cm.\n\nSince the perimeters are equal, I can set up the equation:\n\\( 6 \\times 16 = 8x \\).\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), I divide both sides by 8 to isolate \\( x \\), resulting in:\n\\( x = \\frac{6 \\times 16}{8} = 12 \\) cm.\n\nThus, each side of the octagon is 12 cm long.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given that a regular octagon has the same perimeter as a regular hexagon with a side length of 16 cm. Let's find the side length of the octagon.\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6** equal sides.\n   - Each side = 16 cm\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of Hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\ \\text{cm} = 96\\ \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Side Length of the Octagon**\n\n   - A regular octagon has **8** equal sides.\n   - Let the side length of the octagon be \\( x \\) cm.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of Octagon} = 8x\\ \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the Perimeters Equal and Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n   \\[\n   8x = 96\\ \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{96\\ \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\ \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\ \\text"
