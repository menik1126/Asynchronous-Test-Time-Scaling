The modulus of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is given by \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\n2. **Express \\( (1 - i) \\) in Polar Form:**\n   - **Modulus:** \\( |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n   - **Argument:** The angle \\( \\theta \\) from the positive real axis is \\( -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) because \\( 1 - i \\) is located in the fourth quadrant.\n\n   So, \\( 1 - i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i \\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\right) \\).\n\n3. **Apply De Moivre's Theorem:**\n   When raising a complex number to a power, we raise the modulus to that power and multiply the argument by the same power.\n   \n   \\"
