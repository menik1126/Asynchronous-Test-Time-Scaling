            "output": "First, I recognize that the problem involves calculating the absolute value of a complex number raised to the eighth power: |(1 - i)\u2078|.\n\nNext, I recall that the absolute value of a complex number a + bi is calculated using the formula sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Here, a is 1 and b is -1, so the absolute value of (1 - i) is sqrt(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = sqrt(2).\n\nSince I'm dealing with the eighth power, I can use the property that |(z)\u207f| = |z|\u207f. This means I can calculate the absolute value of (1 - i) first and then raise it to the eighth power: |(1 - i)\u2078| = |1 - i|\u2078 = (sqrt(2))\u2078.\n\nFinally, I compute (sqrt(2))\u2078. The square root of 2 squared is 2, so (sqrt(2))\u00b2 = 2. Therefore, (sqrt(2))\u2078 = (sqrt(2))\u2074 * (sqrt(2))\u2074 = 2\u00b2 * 2\u00b2 = 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nSo, the absolute value of (1 - i)\u2078 is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Absolute Value of \\(1 - i\\):**\n   \n   The absolute value of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n   \n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Raise the Absolute Value to the 8th Power:**\n   \n   Since \\( |(z^n)| = |z|^n \\), we have:\n   \n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Compute \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2})^4 = (2)^2 = 4\n   \\"
