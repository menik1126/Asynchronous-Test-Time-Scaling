The number of girls is a multiple of 13.\n\nI will list the multiples of 13 that are less than or equal to 35: 13, 26.\n\nNext, I determine the number of boys by subtracting each possible number of girls from 35.\n\nIf there are 13 girls, then there are 35 - 13 = 22 boys.\n\nIf there are 26 girls, then there are 35 - 26 = 9 boys.\n\nHowever, the problem states that there are more girls than boys. This means the number of girls cannot be 26, as it would imply fewer boys than girls.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is 13 girls and 22 boys.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls is a multiple of 13.\n- There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Step 1: Express the total number of students.**\n\\[ G + B = 35 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Since the number of girls is a multiple of 13 and less than 35, we list the possible multiples of 13:**\n- 13 (because \\( 13 \\times 1 = 13 \\))\n- 26 (because \\( 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\))\n- 39 is not possible since it exceeds 35.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of boys for each possible number of girls.**\n1. If \\( G = 13 \\):\n   \\[ 13 + B = 35 \\]\n   \\[ B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\]\n   \n2. If \\( G = 26 \\):\n   \\[ 26 + B = 35 \\]\n   \\[ B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Apply the condition that there are more girls than boys.**\n- If \\( G = 26 \\), then \\( B = 9 \\). This does not satisfy the condition because there are more boys than girls.\n- If \\( G = 13 \\), then \\( B = 22 \\). This satisfies the condition since there are more girls than boys.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n"
