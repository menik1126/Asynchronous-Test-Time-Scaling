            "output": "To determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, I'll break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, consider the circular nature of the table. Since the table is square, rotations of the seating arrangement are considered equivalent. However, unlike a round table, the square has four sides, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nNext, I'll fix the position of one person to eliminate rotational symmetry. Fixing one person's position effectively reduces the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people around the table. This approach is commonly used in problems involving circular permutations.\n\nAfter fixing one person's seat, the problem simplifies to arranging the remaining 7 people linearly around the table. Since the square table has four sides with two seats each, I'll think of it as two separate lines of two seats each, but the arrangement must be continuous when walking around the table.\n\nNow, treating the problem as a circular permutation, the number of ways to arrange 7 people in a circle is (7-1)! = 720. However, this assumes that rotations are considered the same, which aligns with the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements is 720.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - Since the table is square, rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new configuration.\n   - This means that we can fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational duplicates.\n\n2. **Fix One Person's Seat:**\n   - Let's fix person A at a specific seat to account for the rotational symmetry.\n   - This now reduces the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people.\n\n3. **Arrange the Remaining 7 People:**\n   - After fixing person A, the table effectively becomes a circle with 7 seats.\n   - The number of ways to arrange 7 people in a circle is calculated using the formula for circular permutations:\n     \\[\n     (7-1)! = 6! = 720\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Therefore, there are **720** distinct seating arrangements.\n\n\\boxed{720}"
