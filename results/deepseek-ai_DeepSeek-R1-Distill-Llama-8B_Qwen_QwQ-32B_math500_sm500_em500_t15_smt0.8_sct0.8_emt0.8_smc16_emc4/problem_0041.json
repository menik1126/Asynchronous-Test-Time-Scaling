Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. \n\nNext, I'll check for divisibility by 3. Adding the digits of 284 (2 + 8 + 4 = 14) and seeing if 14 is divisible by 3, it isn't, so 3 is not a divisor.\n\nFor 4, since 284 ends with a 4, which is divisible by 4, 4 is a divisor. Dividing 284 by 4 gives 71.\n\nNow, I'll check if 71 is a prime number. Testing it with smaller primes like 5, 7, and 11, none divide evenly into 71, confirming it's a prime.\n\nTherefore, the divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, and 71. The proper divisors are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nAdding these proper divisors together: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\nSo, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 7.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Sum these proper divisors to get the first result.**\n3. **Find the proper divisors of this sum.**\n4. **Sum these proper divisors to get the final answer.**\n\nLet's go through each step carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Proper Divisors of 284\n\nA proper divisor of a number \\( N \\) is a positive integer that divides \\( N \\) without leaving a remainder, excluding \\( N \\) itself.\n\n- **Start by listing all divisors of 284:**\n  - 284 is even, so \\( 2 \\) is a divisor: \\( 284 \u00f7 2 = 142 \\).\n  - Next, check if \\( 142 \\) can be divided further:\n    - \\( 142 \u00f7 2 = 71 \\), so \\( 2 \\) is a divisor.\n    - \\( 71 \\) is a prime number (not divisible by any number other than \\( 1 \\) and \\( 71 \\)).\n  \n- **List of divisors:**\n  - \\("
