            "output": "I need to find the smallest possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84. \n\nFirst, I should factorize 84 to determine its prime factors.\n\n84 can be divided by 2, giving 42. Dividing 42 by 2 again results in 21. Next, 21 divided by 3 is 7. Finally, 7 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 84 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7, which are 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nTo minimize the sum, I should use the largest possible factors since larger numbers contribute more to the product but less to the sum.\n\nI'll start by listing the factors of 84: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84.\n\nI need to pick combinations of these factors that multiply to 84.\n\nFirst attempt: 84 alone. Sum is 84, which is too high.\n\nNext, combining smaller numbers: 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7 = 84. Their sum is 3 + 4 + 7 = 14.\n\nIs there a better combination? Let me try 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7. These are distinct, so their sum is 2 + 2 + 3 + 7 = 14, same as before.\n\nAnother combination: 6 \u00d7 14 = 84. Sum is 6 + 14 = 20, which is higher.\n\nWhat about 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 2? That would be the same as 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7, sum 14.\n\nI think 14 is the smallest possible sum.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we start by identifying the prime factors of 84.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization**\n84 can be factored into primes:\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Identify Possible Factor Combinations**\nWe need to find distinct integers whose product is 84. Let's consider different combinations:\n\n- **Combination 1: 3, 4, 7**\n  \\[\n "
