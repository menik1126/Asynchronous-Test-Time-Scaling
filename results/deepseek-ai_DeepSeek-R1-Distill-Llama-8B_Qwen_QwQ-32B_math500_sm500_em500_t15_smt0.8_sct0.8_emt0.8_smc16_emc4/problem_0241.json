            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) to a decimal, I'll start by performing the division of 31 by 11111.\n\nFirst, I'll determine how many times 11111 fits into 31. Since 11111 is much larger than 31, the initial decimal digit is 0.\n\nNext, I'll add a decimal point and begin the long division process by multiplying 31 by 10, making it 310, and then divide by 11111. This gives me 0.0.\n\nI'll repeat this process, each time multiplying the current remainder by 10, dividing by 11111, and recording the quotient. This will continue until a remainder of 0 is reached, identifying the repeating part of the decimal.\n\nAfter performing the division, I find that the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is \\(0.\\overline{00028}\\).\n\nIn this repeating decimal, the block of digits that repeats is four digits long: 00028.\n\nTherefore, the number of digits that repeat is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction:**\n   - The fraction is \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\).\n   - Both the numerator and the denominator are integers, and the denominator is **11111**, which is a prime number.\n\n2. **Decimal Expansion Concept:**\n   - When a fraction has a denominator that is a prime number other than 2 or 5, the decimal expansion will be repeating.\n   - The length of the repeating block is related to the order of 10 modulo the denominator's value.\n\n3. **Finding the Repeating Block Length:**\n   - To find the length of the repeating block, we calculate the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11111}\n     \\]\n   - This means we're looking for the smallest \\( k \\) where \\( 10^k - 1 \\) is divisible by \\( 11111 \\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Order of 10 Modulo 11111:**\n   - Since 11111 is a prime number, the order of 10 modulo 11111 is the smallest \\( k \\) satisfying the above condition.\n  "

We test these divisors in ascending order to find the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Testing Divisors:**\n   - Test \\( k = 1 \\): \\( 10^1 - 1 = 9 \\). \\( 9 \\mod 11111 \\neq 0 \\).\n   - Test \\( k = 2 \\): \\( 10^2 - 1 = 99 \\). \\( 99 \\mod 11111 \\neq 0 \\).\n   - Continue testing divisors (3, 5, 10, 11, 22, 55, etc.) until finding the smallest \\( k \\).\n   - After testing, we find that \\( k = 5 \\) does not work, but \\( k = 5 \\times 2222 = 11110 \\) is too large. Further testing reveals that the smallest \\( k \\) is **5**.\n\nWait, this contradicts the initial thought. Let me correct this step:\n\n**Revised Step 5:**\n- The correct approach is to test the divisors of 11110 systematically. The prime factors of 11110 are 2, 5, 11, and 101. The divisors include combinations of these primes. The smallest \\( k \\) where \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod 11111 \\) is actually **5** because:\n   - \\( 10^5 = 100000 \\).\n   - \\( 100000 \\mod 11111 = 100000 - 9 \\times 11111 = 100000 - 99999 = 1 \\).\n   -"
