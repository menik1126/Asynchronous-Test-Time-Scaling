Hmm, okay. Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that there are some symmetric equations in variables x, y, z, and often they relate to each other through the use of symmetric sums. The expressions given here are symmetric, so maybe I can use some identities or formulas from algebra related to symmetric sums.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\( S_1 = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( S_2 = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( S_3 = xyz \\)\n\nSo, from the first equation, I have \\( S_3 = 4 \\).\n\nFrom the second equation, \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). I recall that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\) can be expressed in terms of S1, S2, and S3. The formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 + 3 S_3 \\)\n\nSo, plugging in the known values:\n\n\\( 4 = S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 + 3 \\times 4 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( 4 = S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 + 12 \\)\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\( -8 = S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 = -8 \\). I'll note this as equation (4).\n\nNow, moving on to the third equation: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\). Hmm, this expression seems a bit complicated. Let me try to see if I can factor it or express it"

That can be rewritten as:\n\n\\( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \\)\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n- \\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \\)\n- \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \\)\n- \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \\)\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\)\n\nWhich is equal to:\n\n\\( xy(S_1 - z) + xz(S_1 - y) + yz(S_1 - x) \\)\n\nHmm, that might be a bit messy, but let's see. Let me try to compute it:\n\n\\( xy(S_1 - z) + xz(S_1 - y) + yz(S_1 - x) = xy S_1 - xyz + xz S_1 - xyz + yz S_1 - xyz \\)\n\nSo that becomes:\n\n\\( (xy + xz + yz) S_1 - 3xyz \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( S_2 S_1 - 3 S_3 \\)\n\nBecause \\( xy + xz + yz = S_2 \\) and \\( xyz = S_3 \\).\n\nSo, the third equation simplifies to:\n\n\\( S_2 S_1 - 3 S_3 = 12 \\)\n\nWe know \\( S_3 = 4 \\), so substituting:\n\n\\( S_2 S_1 - 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( S_1 S_2 - 12 = 12 \\)\n\nSo, \\( S_1 S_2 = 24 \\). That's equation (5).\n\nNow, from equation (4), we have:\n\n\\( S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 = -8 \\)\n\nAnd from equation (5), we have \\( S_1 S_2 = 24 \\), so we can substitute that"
