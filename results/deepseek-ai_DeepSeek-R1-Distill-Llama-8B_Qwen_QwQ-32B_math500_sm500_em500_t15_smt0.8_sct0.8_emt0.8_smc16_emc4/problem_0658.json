            "output": "First, I'll define variables for each item based on their weights relative to each other.\n\nLet T represent the weight of one treek, S for one squig, and G for one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, ten treeks weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee. So, 10T = 3S + G.\n\nFrom the second statement, two treeks and one goolee equal one squig's weight. Therefore, 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I can substitute the expression for S from the second equation into the first equation. Replacing S with (2T + G), the equation becomes 10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding the right side, it becomes 10T = 6T + 3G + G, which simplifies to 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides gives 4T = 4G.\n\nFinally, dividing both sides by 4, I find that T = G. Therefore, one treek weighs the same as one goolee.\n\nNow, I can express S in terms of T using the second equation: S = 2T + G. Since T = G, this becomes S = 2T + T, so S = 3T.\n\nThis means that three treeks equal the weight of one squig. Therefore, the combined weight of three treeks is equal to the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's define the weights of the items using variables:\n\n- Let \\( T \\) represent the weight of one treek.\n- Let \\( S \\) represent the weight of one squig.\n- Let \\( G \\) represent the weight of one goolee.\n\n**Step 1:** Translate the given statements into equations.\n\n1. **Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.**\n   \n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.**\n   \n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute the expression for \\( S \\) from the second equation into the first equation.\n\nSince \\( S = 2T + G \\), substitute \\( S \\"
