There are 10 different items on the menu.\n\nYann has 10 choices for his meal.\n\nAfter Yann has chosen, Camille cannot choose the same dish. Therefore, Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\nTo find the total number of unique combinations, I multiply Yann's choices by Camille's choices: 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nThus, there are 90 different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nYann and Camille go to a restaurant. If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what.)\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n- There are **10** different dishes on the menu.\n- Yann and Camille are each going to order **one** dish.\n- They **refuse** to order the **same** dish.\n- The order matters (Yann ordering dish A and Camille ordering dish B is different from Yann ordering dish B and Camille ordering dish A).\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine the Choices for Yann:**\n   - Yann has **10** different dishes to choose from.\n\n2. **Determine the Choices for Camille:**\n   - After Yann has chosen a dish, Camille cannot choose the **same** dish.\n   - Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining choices.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Combinations:**\n   - Since the order matters, the total number of combinations is the product of Yann's and Camille's choices.\n   - Total combinations = Yann's choices \u00d7 Camille's choices = 10 \u00d7 9 = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"
