            "output": "Ringo needs to calculate the absolute value of (1 - i) raised to the eighth power. To do this, he'll start by understanding the complex number involved.\n\nFirst, he recognizes that (1 - i) is a complex number with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of -1. To compute its power, using polar form is the most efficient method.\n\nNext, he'll convert (1 - i) into polar form. The modulus (or magnitude) of (1 - i) is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). The argument (angle) is arctan(-1/1), which is -\u03c0/4 or 7\u03c0/4, depending on the convention used.\n\nChoosing the principal value, the argument is -\u03c0/4. Now, raising (1 - i) to the eighth power involves raising its modulus to the eighth power and multiplying its argument by eight. The modulus becomes (sqrt(2))^8 = 2^4 = 16. The argument after multiplying is -2\u03c0, which is equivalent to 0 in the complex plane because adding 2\u03c0 doesn't change the orientation.\n\nFinally, converting back to rectangular form, the zero argument results in both the real and imaginary parts being zero. Therefore, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\[|(1 - i)^8|\\], let's follow these step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Number**:\n   \\[\n   (1 - i)\n   \\]\n   This is a complex number with a real part of \\(1\\) and an imaginary part of \\(-i\\).\n\n2. **Convert to Polar Form**:\n   A complex number \\(a + bi\\) can be expressed in polar form as:\n   \\[\n   r(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\(r\\) is the modulus (magnitude) of the complex number.\n   - \\(\\theta\\) is the argument (angle).\n\n   For \\(1 - i\\):\n   - Modulus \\(r = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n   - Argument \\(\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-1}{1}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\)\n\n   So,\n   \\[\n   "
