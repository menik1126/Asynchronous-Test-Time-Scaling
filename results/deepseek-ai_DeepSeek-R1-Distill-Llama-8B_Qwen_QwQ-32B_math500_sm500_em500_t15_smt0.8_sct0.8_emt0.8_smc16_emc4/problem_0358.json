            "output": "First, I'll define the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let\u2019s say there are 4x blue marbles and 3x yellow marbles since the ratio is 4:3.\n\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes 7:3. This means the new counts are 7y blue marbles and 3y yellow marbles.\n\nI can set up equations based on the changes. The new number of blue marbles is 4x + 5 = 7y, and the new number of yellow marbles is 3x - 3 = 3y.\n\nFrom the second equation, 3x - 3 = 3y, I can simplify to y = x - 1.\n\nSubstituting y = x - 1 into the first equation gives 4x + 5 = 7(x - 1). Simplifying this, I get 4x + 5 = 7x - 7, which leads to 3x = 12, so x = 4.\n\nFinally, substituting x = 4 back into y = x - 1 gives y = 3.\n\nTherefore, the initial number of blue marbles was 4 times x, which is 4 * 4 = 16.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let the initial number of blue marbles be \\( 4x \\).\n   - Let the initial number of yellow marbles be \\( 3x \\).\n   - The ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 4:3 \\).\n\n2. **After Changes:**\n   - Add 5 blue marbles: Blue marbles become \\( 4x + 5 \\).\n   - Remove 3 yellow marbles: Yellow marbles become \\( 3x - 3 \\).\n   - The new ratio is \\( 7:3 \\), so:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   "
