            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer. It's \u221a[3]{x\u00b2 - 4x + 4} = 16. Alright, I need to find the positive value of x that satisfies this equation.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with roots, especially cube roots, a good strategy is to eliminate the root by cubing both sides of the equation. That should simplify things. So if I do that, I'll have (\u221a[3]{x\u00b2 - 4x + 4})\u00b3 = 16\u00b3. On the left side, the cube and the cube root should cancel each other out, leaving me with just x\u00b2 - 4x + 4. On the right side, 16\u00b3 is... hmm, let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Let me do 256*10=2560, 256*6=1536, so 2560+1536=4096. So the equation becomes x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me rewrite that: x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096. Hmm, I can subtract 4096 from both sides to set it equal to zero, which might make it easier to factor or use the quadratic formula. So x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, I get x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0. Wait, that doesn't look like a number I can easily factor. Maybe I should use the quadratic formula here.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Plugging those into the formula: x = [-(-4) \u00b1 \u221a((-4)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-4092))]/(2*1). Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, the numerator starts with -(-4), which is 4. Then inside the square root, we have (-4)\u00b2, which is 16. Then, 4*1"

            "output": "*(-4092) is -16368. But since it's subtracting that, it becomes 16 - (-16368), which is 16 + 16368, giving 16384. So the square root of 16384. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me think if I know the square of 128: 128*128 is 16384. Yes, so \u221a16384 is 128.\n\nSo putting it all together: x = [4 \u00b1 128]/2. That gives two solutions. Let's compute both. First, 4 + 128 is 132, divided by 2 is 66. Then, 4 - 128 is -124, divided by 2 is -62. So the solutions are x = 66 and x = -62. But the question asks for the positive value of x, so that would be 66.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me double-check my steps. Starting with the original equation: cube root of (x\u00b2 -4x +4) =16. I cubed both sides to get x\u00b2 -4x +4 = 16\u00b3=4096. Then subtracted 4096, getting x\u00b2 -4x -4092=0. Applied quadratic formula with a=1, b=-4, c=-4092. Discriminant was b\u00b2-4ac=16+16368=16384, which is 128 squared. So sqrt(16384)=128. So numerator is 4 \u00b1128, so x=(132)/2=66 and x=(-124)/2=-62. Since it asks for positive, x=66. Seems correct.\n\nI wonder if the quadratic could have been factored differently, but with such a large constant term, factoring seems impractical. So yes, quadratic formula is the way to go. Another thing to check is substituting x=66 back into the original equation to make sure it works.\n\nLet's do that: if x=66, then x\u00b2 is 66\u00b2=4356. Then -4x is -264. So x\u00b2 -4x is 4356 -264=4092. Then x\u00b2 -4x +4 is 4092 +4=4096. The cube root of 4096 is indeed 16 because 16\u00b3=4096. So that checks out.\n\nSimilarly,"

So the cube root is 16. So both roots satisfy the equation, but since the problem asks for the positive solution, 66 is the answer.\n\nWait, does the problem maybe have only one positive solution? Because sometimes equations can have multiple positive solutions, but in this case, since it's a quadratic, it can have at most two real solutions, and we got both. So yes, 66 is the only positive one.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations. The key steps were cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root, simplifying the quadratic, then using the quadratic formula because factoring wasn't feasible. Checking both solutions by plugging them back into the original equation ensures that they're correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\\), we start by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 4096 from both sides gives:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\) where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = -4092\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16384}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{16384} = 128\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis results in two solutions:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac"
