            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product of two integers, C and D. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nAnd this equation holds true for all real values of x except -8 and 3 because those values would make the denominators zero, which is undefined. \n\nOkay, so my goal is to find C and D such that when I add these two fractions on the left side, I get the fraction on the right side. Since this is true for all x except -8 and 3, the numerators must be equal when the denominators are the same. \n\nFirst, I notice that the denominator on the right side is a quadratic expression: \\(x^2 + 5x -24\\). Maybe I can factor that to see if it relates to the denominators on the left side.\n\nLet me try factoring \\(x^2 + 5x -24\\). To factor a quadratic of the form \\(x^2 + bx + c\\), I need two numbers that multiply to c and add up to b. Here, c is -24 and b is 5. \n\nSo, the numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5... Let's see, 8 and -3. Yes, because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. \n\nSo, the denominator factors as:\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x -24 = (x + 8)(x - 3)\n\\]\n\nThat's perfect because the denominators on the left side are (x - 3) and (x + 8). So, I can rewrite the right side with the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x - 23}{(x + 8)(x - 3)}\n\\]\n\nNow, the left side already has denominators (x - 3) and (x + 8), so if I can express both fractions with the common denominator (x - 3)(x + 8), I can add them together and set the numerator equal to 4x - 23.\n\nSo, let's rewrite each fraction:\n\nFirst term:\n\\[\n\\frac{"

Let's expand the left side:\n\nFirst, distribute C and D:\n\n\\[\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nThe terms with x: \\( Cx + Dx = (C + D)x \\)\nThe constant terms: \\( 8C - 3D \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, since this equation must hold for all real x (except -8 and 3), the coefficients of corresponding terms must be equal. That means:\n\n1. The coefficient of x on the left is \\( C + D \\), and on the right is 4. Therefore:\n\\[\nC + D = 4 \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\n2. The constant term on the left is \\( 8C - 3D \\), and on the right is -23. Therefore:\n\\[\n8C - 3D = -23 \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\nSo now, I have a system of two equations with two variables, C and D. I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\\[\nC = 4 - D\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute C into equation (2):\n\n\\[\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\\]\n\nLet's compute this:\n\nFirst, distribute the 8:\n\\[\n32 - 8D - "
