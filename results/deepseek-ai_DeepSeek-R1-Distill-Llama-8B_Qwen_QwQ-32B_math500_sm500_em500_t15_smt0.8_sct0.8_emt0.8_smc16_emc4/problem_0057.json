            "output": "First, I need to determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders.\n\nI'll start by calculating the percentage difference for each grade. The percentage difference is calculated as (Male % - Female %).\n\nFor 9th grade:\n41.1% - 39.4% = 1.7%\n\nFor 10th grade:\n34.4% - 33.1% = 1.3%\n\nFor 11th grade:\n20.6% - 13.8% = 6.8%\n\nFor 12th grade:\n11.6% - 8.6% = 3.0%\n\nNext, I'll compare these differences to the target 135% difference. The closer the calculated difference is to 135%, the closer the actual number of male bus riders is to 135% of the female bus riders.\n\nLooking at the differences:\n1.7% (9th grade) and 3.0% (12th grade) are closer to the target percentage compared to 1.3% and 6.8%.\n\nSince the 1.7% difference is smaller and closer to 135% than the 3.0%, the 9th grade is the grade where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which grade has male bus riders closest to being \\(135\\%\\) of female bus riders, we'll analyze the provided data step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Requirements\nWe need to find the grade where:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Male Bus Riders} = 1.35 \\times \\text{Number of Female Bus Riders}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Percentage Difference\nFor each grade, calculate the percentage difference between male and female bus riders:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Difference} = (\\text{Male Percentage} - \\text{Female Percentage}) \\times 100\n\\]\n\n| Grade          | Males (%) | Females (%) | Difference (%) |\n|---------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|\n| 9th Grade      | 41.1      | 39.4       | 1.7            |\n| 10th Grade     | 34.4      | 33.1       | 1.3            |\n| 11th Grade     | 20.6"

However, the percentages in the table are already relative to the total surveyed (300 males and 300 females per grade). Instead, we need to compute the ratio of male to female bus riders for each grade and compare it to \\(1.35\\).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Ratio of Male to Female Bus Riders\nFor each grade:\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Male Percentage}}{\\text{Female Percentage}}\n\\]\n\n- **9th Grade**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{41.1}{39.4} \\approx 1.043 \\quad (\\text{Difference from } 1.35 = 0.307)\n  \\]\n  \n- **10th Grade**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{34.4}{33.1} \\approx 1.040 \\quad (\\text{Difference from } 1.35 = 0.310)\n  \\]\n  \n- **11th Grade**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{20.6}{13.8} \\approx 1.493 \\quad (\\text{Difference from } 1.35 = 0.143)\n  \\]\n  \n- **12th Grade**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{11.6}{8.6} \\approx 1.349 \\quad (\\text{Difference from } 1.35 = 0.001)\n  \\]\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Closest Grade\nThe 12th grade has the smallest difference (\\(0.001\\)) between its ratio and \\(1.35\\), making it the closest.\n\n\\boxed{12^{\\text{th}} \\text{ grade}}"
