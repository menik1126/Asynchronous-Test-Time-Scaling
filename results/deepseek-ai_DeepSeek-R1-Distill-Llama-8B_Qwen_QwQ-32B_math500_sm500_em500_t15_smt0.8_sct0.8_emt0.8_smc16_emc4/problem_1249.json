To do this, I'll divide 999 by 6 and keep track of the quotients and remainders from each division.\n\nI start by dividing 999 by 6, which gives a quotient of 166 and a remainder of 3. I'll write down the remainder 3 as the least significant digit in base six.\n\nNext, I'll divide the quotient 166 by 6. This gives a quotient of 27 with a remainder of 2. I'll record the remainder 2 as the next digit in base six.\n\nThen, I'll divide the new quotient 27 by 6, resulting in a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3. I'll note the remainder 3 as the following digit.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the quotient 4 by 6, which gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4. I'll write down the remainder 4 as the most significant digit in base six.\n\nCombining all the remainders from last to first, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 2343_6.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6 and record the remainder (R1):**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R1 = 3\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Divide the quotient 166 by 6 and record the new remainder (R2):**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R2 = 2\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Divide the new quotient 27 by 6 and record the new remainder (R3):**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R3 = 3\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Divide the new quotient 4 by 6 and record the new remainder (R4):**\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R4 = 4\n   \\"
