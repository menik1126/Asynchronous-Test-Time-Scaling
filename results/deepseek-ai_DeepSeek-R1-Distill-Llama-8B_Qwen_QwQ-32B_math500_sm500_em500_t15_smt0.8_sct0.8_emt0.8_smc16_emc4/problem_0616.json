            "output": "First, I need to determine the prime factorization of 196. I know that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. Since 98 is also even, I divide by 2 again to get 49. Now, 49 is a perfect square of 7. Therefore, the prime factors of 196 are 2, 2, and 7, 7.\n\nNext, I'll use the formula for finding the number of divisors. If a number has a prime factorization of \\( p^a \\times q^b \\), the total number of divisors is \\( (a + 1)(b + 1) \\). Applying this to 196 with exponents 2 and 2, the number of divisors is \\( (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\nSo, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors \\( 196 \\) has, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Prime Factorization of \\( 196 \\)\nStart by breaking down \\( 196 \\) into its prime factors.\n\n\\[\n196 \\div 2 = 98 \\quad (\\text{since } 196 \\text{ is even})\n\\]\n\\[\n98 \\div 2 = 49 \\quad (\\text{again, } 98 \\text{ is even})\n\\]\n\\[\n49 \\div 7 = 7 \\quad (\\text{since } 49 = 7^2)\n\\]\n\\[\n7 \\div 7 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the prime factors of \\( 196 \\) are:\n\\[\n196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Divisor Formula\nIf a number \\( N \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p^a \\times q^b \\times \\dots \\), the total number of positive divisors is given by:\n\\[\n(a + 1)(b + 1) \\dots\n\\]\n\nApplying this to \\( 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\):\n\\[\n(2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n\\]\n\n###"
