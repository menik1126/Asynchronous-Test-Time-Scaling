            "output": "First, I need to determine the robot's speed. It travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. Since speed is distance divided by time, the speed is 1 km divided by 2.5 hours, which is 0.4 km/h.\n\nNext, I'll convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour. So, 0.4 km/h multiplied by (3600 seconds / 1000 meters) gives 1.6 m/s.\n\nThe robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway. Using the formula distance equals speed multiplied by time, I can calculate the hallway's length. Therefore, 1.6 m/s multiplied by 90 seconds equals 144 meters.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Robot's Speed**\n\nThe robot moves forward at a constant speed. We can calculate its speed using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Distance traveled in the first scenario = 1 kilometer (km)\n- Time taken = 2.5 hours\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}} = 0.4 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert Speed to Meters per Second**\n\nWe need to work in meters and seconds, so let's convert the speed from km/h to m/s.\n\n- 1 kilometer = 1000 meters\n- 1 hour = 3600 seconds\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = 0.4 \\text{ km/h} \\times \\left( \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{1 \\text{ km}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{3600 \\text{ seconds}} \\right) = 1.6 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Length of the Hallway**\n\nIn the second scenario:\n- Time taken = 90 seconds\n- Speed = 1.6 m/s\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of the"
