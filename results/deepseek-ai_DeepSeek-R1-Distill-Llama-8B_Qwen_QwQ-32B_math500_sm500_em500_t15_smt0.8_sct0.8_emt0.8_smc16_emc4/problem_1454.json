            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that sometimes when dealing with exponential equations, it's helpful to express both sides with the same base or to find a substitution that can simplify things.\n\nFirst, looking at the equation, I see that 3^{2x} can be rewritten. Wait, 3^{2x} is actually (3^2)^x, which simplifies to 9^x. So the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That might be easier to work with because now both sides are exponential functions with different bases.\n\nSo, we have 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, I need to solve for x. One method I know for solving equations like this is to take the natural logarithm of both sides, but sometimes that can get complicated because of the addition. Alternatively, maybe I can try substituting y = 10^x, which would make 9^x equal to (9/10)^x * 10^x. Wait, that might not be the easiest path.\n\nLet me think. If I set y = 10^x, then 9^x can be expressed as (9/10)^x multiplied by 10^x, right? But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, since 9 and 10 are both positive, and the functions are exponential, maybe graphing them could give some insight into where they intersect. But I guess I need an algebraic method.\n\nAnother thought: maybe rearrange the equation to isolate the exponential terms. Let's move 9^x to the right side: 19 = 10^x - 9^x. Hmm, that gives me 10^x - 9^x = 19. Still, not sure how that helps directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can divide both sides by 10^x to get (10^x - 9^x)/10^x = 19/10^x. Let's see, (10^x - 9^x)/10^x = 1 - (9/10)^x. So the equation becomes 1 - (9/10)^x = 19/(10^x). Hmm, that might be a bit better.\n\nLet me write"

Then, since 10^x is (10)^x, and (9/10)^x = 9^x / 10^x, so t = 9^x / 10^x. Therefore, 10^x = 9^x / t. Wait, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider taking logarithms. Let me try taking the natural logarithm of both sides. But the problem is that the equation has a sum of exponentials, which complicates taking logs. Because ln(a + b) isn't easily simplified.\n\nHmm, maybe trial and error with integer values? Let me test some integer values for x to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet's try x = 2:\n\nLeft side: 3^(2*2) + 19 = 3^4 +19 = 81 +19 = 100\n\nRight side: 10^2 = 100. Oh! That works. So x=2 is a solution.\n\nWait, so maybe x=2 is the solution? Let me check another value to see if there are more solutions.\n\nTry x=1:\n\nLeft: 3^2 +19 = 9 +19 =28\n\nRight:10^1=10.

            "output": ":10^2.5=10^2*sqrt(10)=100*3.16\u2248316. Not equal.\n\nWait, so when x=2, both sides are 100. When x=3, left side is 748, right is 1000. So left is less than right at x=3. At x=2.5, left is 262, right is ~316. So, 262 < 316.\n\nWait, so let me see: when x increases beyond 2, does the left side grow faster than the right side? Let me think. Let's compare the growth rates.\n\nWe have 10^x and 9^x on the left. 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so as x increases, 10^x will overtake 9^x. But in the equation, we have 9^x +19 =10^x.\n\nAt x=2, both sides are equal. For x>2, 10^x increases faster than 9^x, so 10^x -9^x is increasing. So perhaps x=2 is the only solution?\n\nBut wait, maybe for x less than 2, is there another solution? Let me check x=1, which gives left=28, right=10. So left is greater than right at x=1. So, perhaps the functions cross somewhere between x=1 and x=2, and then again cross again at x=2?\n\nWait, but at x=2, it's equal. So, let me graph both functions f(x)=9^x +19 and g(x)=10^x.\n\nAt x=0: f(x)=1+19=20, g(x)=1. So f>g.\n\nAt x=1: f=9+19=28, g=10. f>g.\n\nAt x=2: f=81+19=100, g=100. Equal.\n\nAt x=3: f=729+19=748, g=1000. f < g.\n\nSo, from x=2 to x=3, f(x) goes from 100 to 748, and g(x) goes from 100 to 1000. So f(x) is increasing faster than g(x) initially, but g(x) is growing faster as x increases.\n\nWait, but let's compute the derivatives to"

But the actual growth rate also depends on the base. Since 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so for large x, g(x) will dominate.\n\nTherefore, the function f(x) starts above g(x) at x=0, stays above until x=2 where they meet, then after x=2, g(x) overtakes f(x). So the only intersection point is at x=2. Wait, but between x=1 and x=2, f(x) is still above g(x). Wait, at x=1, f=28 vs g=10. At x=2, they are equal. So the function f(x) is decreasing relative to g(x) from x=1 to x=2, but they only meet at x=2. So maybe there's only one solution at x=2.\n\nWait, but let me check between x=1 and x=2.
