            "output": "First, I'll perform the prime factorization of 196.\n\nI know that 14 multiplied by 14 equals 196. Since 14 is 2 times 7, this means that 196 can be expressed as 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared.\n\nThis gives me the prime factorization: 196 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n\nNext, I'll use the formula for finding the number of divisors. If a number has a prime factorization of the form \\( p^a \\times q^b \\), then the total number of positive divisors is \\( (a+1)(b+1) \\).\n\nApplying this to 196, where a is 2 and b is 2, the number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1) which equals 3 multiplied by 3, resulting in 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many **positive whole-number divisors** 196 has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**  \n   First, express 196 as a product of its prime factors.\n\n   \\[\n   196 = 14 \\times 14\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( 14 = 2 \\times 7 \\), we can rewrite:\n\n   \\[\n   196 = (2 \\times 7) \\times (2 \\times 7) = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Divisors**  \n   The formula to find the number of divisors of a number based on its prime factorization is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Divisors} = (a+1)(b+1)\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n   Where \\( a, b, \\ldots \\) are the exponents in the prime factorization.\n\n   For \\( 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\):\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Divisors} = (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **List of Divisors**  \n   Here are all the positive divisors of 196:\n   \n   \\[\n   1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196\n   \\]\n\n"
