            "output": "First, I need to find the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since a hexagon has six equal sides and each side is 16 cm, the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length by the number of sides.\n\nNext, I'll determine the perimeter of the regular octagon. A regular octagon also has eight equal sides. Using the same perimeter value as the hexagon, I'll divide by eight to find the length of each side of the octagon.\n\nFinally, I'll compare the side length of the octagon to the side length of the hexagon to see how they relate.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Perimeter of the Regular Hexagon\n\nA regular hexagon has **6** equal sides. Given that each side is **16 cm**, the perimeter \\( P_{\\text{hexagon}} \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16 \\, \\text{cm} = 96 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Perimeter of the Regular Octagon\n\nA regular octagon has **8** equal sides. The problem states that the perimeter of the octagon is equal to that of the hexagon. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{octagon}} = P_{\\text{hexagon}} = 96 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Length of Each Side of the Octagon\n\nLet \\( s_{\\text{octagon}} \\) represent the length of each side of the octagon. Since the perimeter is the sum of all sides:\n\n\\[\ns_{\\text{octagon}} \\times 8 = 96 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( s_{\\text{octagon}} \\):\n\n\\[\ns_{\\text{octagon}} = \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe length of each side of the regular octagon is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\ \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
