So, the question is: If \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), then find the remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7.\n\nHmm, modular arithmetic, right? So, first, I know that congruence modulo 7 means that \\( n \\) leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7. That is, \\( n = 7k + 2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nBut I'm supposed to find the remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7. Maybe I can work directly with the congruences instead of dealing with the actual values. Let me think about that.\n\nGiven \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), I can substitute each \\( n \\) in the expression with 2 modulo 7. So let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \\( n + 2 \\pmod{7} \\):\n\\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), so \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\nNext, compute \\( n + 4 \\pmod{7} \\):\nSimilarly, \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), so \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\nThen, compute \\( n + 6 \\pmod{7} \\):\nAgain, \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), so \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 = 8 \\pmod{7} \\). But 8 modulo 7 is 1, right? Because 7 goes into 8 once with a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, now I can rewrite the original expression \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) modulo 7 as:\n\\( 4 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\nLet me compute that. 4 multiplied by 6 is 24. Then, 24 multiplied by 1 is 24. Now, find 24 modulo "

Therefore, \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\nWait, let me verify if I did that correctly. Maybe I should double-check each step.\n\nStarting again, since \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), then:\n\n\\( n + 2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\) – that's correct.\n\\( n + 4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\) – correct again.\n\\( n + 6 \\equiv 8 \\pmod{7} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\) – yes, that's right because 8 - 7 = 1.\n\nSo, the product is 4 * 6 * 1. Let me calculate this again:\n4 * 6 is 24, and 24 * 1 is 24. 24 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 3, so 24 mod 7 is indeed 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it in a different order for practice. Let's see, 4 * 6 is 24, and then 24 * 1 is 24. Alternatively, 4 * (6 * 1) = 4 * 6 = 24. Same result.\n\nAnother way to think about it: 6 * 1 is 6, and then 4 * 6 is 24. Either way, same result.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7 is 3.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me consider a concrete example. Let's choose a number \\( n \\) that is congruent to 2 modulo 7, say n = 2.\n\nThen, compute \\( (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 * 6 * 8 = 4*6=24, 24*8=192. Now, divide 192 by 7. Let's see: "
