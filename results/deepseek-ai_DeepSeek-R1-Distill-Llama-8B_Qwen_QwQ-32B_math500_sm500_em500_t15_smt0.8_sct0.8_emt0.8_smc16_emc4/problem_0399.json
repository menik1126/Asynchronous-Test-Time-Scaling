The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula V = \u03c0r\u00b2h. \n\nFirst, I'll identify the values provided. Here, the radius (r) is 3 centimeters, and the volume (V) is 45\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll substitute these known values into the volume formula. Plugging in the radius and volume, the equation becomes 45\u03c0 = \u03c0(3)\u00b2h.\n\nTo simplify, I can divide both sides of the equation by \u03c0 to eliminate \u03c0 from the equation. This leaves me with 45 = 9h.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for h by dividing both sides of the equation by 9. This gives h = 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo find the height (\\( h \\)) of the cylinder when the volume (\\( V \\)) is given, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Given:**\n\\[\nV = 45\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r = 3 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Plug the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 9.\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
