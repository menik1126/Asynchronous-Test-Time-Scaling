            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x), which is defined as the square root of (x - 3) squared minus (x - 8) squared. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root has to be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x for which the expression under the square root, which is (x - 3)² - (x - 8)², is greater than or equal to zero.\n\nSo, my first task is to figure out when (x - 3)² - (x - 8)² is non-negative. That seems like a difference of squares, right? Because both terms are squared terms. The difference of squares formula is a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me let a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). Then, the expression becomes a² - b², which factors into (a - b)(a + b). So substituting back in, it's [(x - 3) - (x - 8)] times [(x - 3) + (x - 8)]. Let me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, compute (x - 3) - (x - 8). That simplifies to x - 3 - x + 8, right? The x terms cancel out: x - x is zero, and then -3 + 8 is 5. So that part is 5.\n\nNext, compute (x - 3) + (x - 8). That's x - 3 + x - 8, which combines like terms: x + x is 2x, and -3 - 8 is -11. So that part becomes 2x - 11.\n\nPutting it all together, the expression under the square root factors into 5*(2x - 11). So, g(x) becomes sqrt(5*(2x - 11)).\n\nNow, for the square root to be real, the inside must be >= 0. So, 5*(2"

            "output": "x - 11) >= 0. Since 5 is a positive constant, I can divide both sides by 5 without changing the inequality direction. That gives me 2x - 11 >= 0.\n\nNow, solving for x: 2x - 11 >= 0 → 2x >= 11 → x >= 11/2. So, x is greater than or equal to 11/2.\n\nWait a second, is that all? So the domain of g(x) is x >= 11/2. So, the smallest real number x in the domain would be 11/2, which is 5.5.\n\nHold on, let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have messed up with signs or factoring.\n\nStarting again: (x - 3)² - (x - 8)². Factoring as difference of squares: ( (x - 3) - (x - 8) ) * ( (x - 3) + (x - 8) ). Which gives 5*(2x - 11). Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, setting 5*(2x - 11) >= 0. Since 5 is positive, 2x - 11 >= 0 → x >= 11/2.\n\nWait, but do I need to consider whether the expression inside the square root is strictly positive or just non-negative? The problem says \"smallest real number x in the domain\". The domain includes x = 11/2 because at x = 11/2, the expression inside is zero, so the square root is zero, which is real. So x = 11/2 is included in the domain, and that's the smallest such x.\n\nLet me plug x = 11/2 back into the original expression to confirm. (11/2 - 3)^2 - (11/2 - 8)^2.\n\nCompute 11/2 - 3: 3 is 6/2, so 11/2 - 6/2 = 5/2. So, (5/2)^2 = 25/4.\n\nCompute 11/2 - 8: 8 is 16/2, so 11/2 -16/2 = -5/2. Then, (-5/2)^2 is 25/4.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the square root"

So, at x = 11/2, we get sqrt(0) = 0, which is real, so x = 11/2 is indeed in the domain.\n\nIs there any x less than 11/2 that would make the expression under the square root non-negative? Let's test x = 5, which is less than 5.5.\n\nCompute (5 - 3)^2 - (5 - 8)^2 = (2)^2 - (-3)^2 = 4 - 9 = -5. Which is negative, so sqrt(-5) is not real. So, 5 is not in the domain.\n\nHow about x = 6? Wait, 6 is 6.0, which is more than 5.5. So, plugging in x=6:\n\n(6 -3)^2 - (6 -8)^2 = (3)^2 - (-2)^2 = 9 -4 =5. Which is positive, so okay.\n\nWhat about x = 11/2 is 5.5, which worked as shown earlier. So, 5.5 is the smallest x where the expression under the square root is zero, hence included in the domain. Any number less than 5.5 makes the expression negative, so not in the domain.\n\nTherefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 11/2, which is 5.5.\n\nI think that's solid. So, no mistakes detected in the logic here.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is found by ensuring the expression under the square root is non-negative. After simplifying, we find that \\( x \\) must be at least \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\). Therefore, the smallest such \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}\n\\]"
