            "output": "First, I'll calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h. Given the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, the volume will be \u03c0 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 8 = 72\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3. With the radius of the spherical tank being 6 cm, the volume will be (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 6\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 216 = 288\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\nFinally, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, I'll divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker. So, 288\u03c0 divided by 72\u03c0 equals 4. Therefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank by following a step-by-step approach.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker\nThe volume \\( V_{\\text{cylinder}} \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( r = 3 \\) cm (radius of the cylindrical beaker)\n- \\( h = 8 \\) cm (height of the cylindrical beaker)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank\nThe volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( R = 6 \\) cm (radius of the spherical tank)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n"
