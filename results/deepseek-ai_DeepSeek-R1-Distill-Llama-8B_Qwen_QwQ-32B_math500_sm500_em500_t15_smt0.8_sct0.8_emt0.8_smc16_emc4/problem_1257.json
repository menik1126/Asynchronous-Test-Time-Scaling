            "output": "To find the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal, I'll start by understanding how base conversion works. In base six, each digit represents a power of six.\n\nFirst, I'll express 999 in terms of powers of six. I'll begin with the highest power less than or equal to the number.\n\nI'll start with 6\u2070, which is 1. Then, 6\u00b9 is 6, and 6\u00b2 is 36. Next, 6\u00b3 is 216, 6\u2074 is 1296. Since 6\u2074 is greater than 999, I'll use 6\u00b3 as the highest power.\n\nNext, I'll determine how many times 6\u00b3 (216) fits into 999. Dividing 999 by 216 gives approximately 4.63. Since we can only use whole numbers, the coefficient for 6\u00b3 will be 4.\n\nAfter that, I'll multiply 216 by 4 to get 864. I'll subtract this from 999 to find the remaining value, which is 135.\n\nNow, I'll move to the next lower power, which is 6\u00b2 (36). Dividing 135 by 36 gives 3.75. Taking the integer part, the coefficient for 6\u00b2 is 3.\n\nMultiplying 36 by 3 gives 108. I'll subtract this from 135 to get 27.\n\nNext, I'll use 6\u00b9 (6). Dividing 27 by 6 gives 4.5. Taking the integer part, the coefficient for 6\u00b9 is 4.\n\nMultiplying 6 by 4 gives 24. Subtracting this from 27 leaves 3.\n\nFinally, I'll use 6\u2070 (1) for the remaining value of 3. The coefficient for 6\u2070 is 3.\n\nPutting all the coefficients together, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 4\u202f3\u202f4\u202f3 in base six.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\) to base six, we'll use the division-by-base method.
