Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, let's write down what we know. We have the constraint \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), and we need to minimize the expression \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). So, this looks like an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe I can use some optimization techniques here, like Lagrange multipliers, but since it's symmetric in some variables, perhaps there's a way to use inequalities or AM-GM?\n\nI remember that AM-GM inequality is often useful in these types of problems because it relates sums and products, which seems relevant here since we have both sums and products in our expressions. Let me recall the AM-GM inequality: for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is at least the geometric mean. So, for example, for two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we have \\(\\frac{a + b}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{ab}\\), with equality when \\(a = b\\).\n\nLooking at our expression, \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), maybe I can try to rewrite it or apply some inequality to it. Let's first expand this expression to see if that gives any insight. Expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's the expanded form. Not sure if that's immediately helpful, but maybe. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of \\(y\\) and some other variables. Let's see.\n\nWait, the constraint is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). Maybe I can introduce new variables or make substitutions to simplify the problem. Alternatively, since the expression involves both \\(x + y\\) and \\(y + z\\), perhaps I can consider setting \\(a = x + y\\) and \\(b = y + z\\), but then I also have \\(x + y + z = (x + y) + z = a + z\\), which might complicate things further.

Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider symmetry here. Since the problem involves three variables, maybe setting some variables equal could lead to the minimum. For instance, if I assume that \\(x = z\\), perhaps the problem simplifies?\n\nLet me try that. Suppose that \\(x = z\\). Then, the constraint becomes \\(x y x (x + y + x) = x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\). The expression to minimize becomes \\((x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)^2\\). Wait, that would mean the expression simplifies to \\((x + y)^2\\). Wait, so if \\(x = z\\), then \\((x + y)(y + z) = (x + y)^2\\). Hmm, that might be a simpler case.\n\nSo, let me suppose \\(x = z\\), and try to see if that can lead me to the minimum. Let me denote \\(x = z = a\\). Then, the constraint is \\(a \\cdot y \\cdot a (a + y + a) = a^2 y (2a + y) =1\\). So, the expression to minimize is \\((a + y)^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to minimizing \\((a + y)^2\\) under the constraint \\(a^2 y (2a + y) = 1\\). Hmm. Maybe substituting variables here would help. Let's set \\(b = a + y\\), so \\(y = b - a\\). But then substituting into the constraint would be a bit messy. Maybe instead, we can set variables to express the constraint in terms of one variable?\n\nAlternatively, set \\(t = y/a\\), so that \\(y = t a\\). Then, substituting into the constraint:\n\n\\(a^2 (t a) (2a + t a) = a^3 t (2 + t) a = a^4 t (2 + t) =1\\). Wait, actually, that would be:\n\nWait, original substitution: \\(y = t a\\).

Let's check whether y S = x z:\n\nCompute S =x + y + z =1 + (sqrt(2)-1) +1=1 + sqrt(2)-1 +1=1 + sqrt(2).\n\nCompute y S = (sqrt(2)-1)(1 + sqrt(2))= (sqrt(2)-1)(sqrt(2)+1)=2 -1=1.\n\nCompute x z =1*1=1.\n\nSo, indeed y S = x z =1, so the equality condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, it all checks out.\n\nConclusion: The minimal value of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum value is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem of finding the minimum value of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) under the constraint \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\) where \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are positive real numbers, we can approach it using the AM-GM inequality.\n\nFirst, we note that the expression \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) can be expanded and rewritten as \\(y(x + y + z) + xz\\). Using the AM-GM inequality on the terms \\(y(x + y + z)\\) and \\(xz\\), we have:\n\n\\[\ny(x + y + z) + xz \\geq 2\\sqrt{y(x + y + z) \\cdot xz}\n\\]\n\nGiven the constraint \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), we substitute \\(xyz(x + y + z)\\) as 1, leading to:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{y(x + y + z) \\cdot xz} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\ny(x + y + z) + xz \\geq"
