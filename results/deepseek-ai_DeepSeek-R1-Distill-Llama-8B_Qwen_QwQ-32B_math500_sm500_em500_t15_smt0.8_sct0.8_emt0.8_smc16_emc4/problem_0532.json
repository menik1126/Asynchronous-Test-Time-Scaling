            "output": "First, I understand there are 10 different dishes available on the menu.\n\nBoth Yann and Camille are choosing one dish each, and they do not want to choose the same dish.\n\nSince Yann has 10 options and Camille also has 10 options, initially, it might seem like there are 10 \u00d7 10 = 100 possible combinations.\n\nHowever, this includes the scenario where both Yann and Camille choose the same dish. To eliminate this, which happens in 10 cases (one for each dish being chosen by both), the total unique combinations become 100 \u2212 10 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 different combinations of meals they can order without choosing the same dish.\n\nThe answer is that there are 90 different meal combinations.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order from a menu of 10 dishes, given the following conditions:\n\n1. **Each person orders one dish.**\n2. **They refuse to order the same dish.**\n3. **The order of who orders which dish matters (Yann and Camille ordering chicken and fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken).**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total possible combinations without any restrictions.**\n\nSince there are 10 dishes and two people, the total number of ways they can order is:\n\\[ 10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 10 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 100 \\text{ combinations} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the cases where they order the same dish.**\n\nIf both Yann and Camille choose the same dish, there are 10 such cases (one for each dish). Therefore, we subtract these 10 combinations.\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ total combinations} - 10 \\text{ same dish combinations} = 90 \\text{ unique combinations} \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere are \\(\\boxed{90}\\) different combinations of meals that Yann and Camille can order without ordering the same dish."

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
