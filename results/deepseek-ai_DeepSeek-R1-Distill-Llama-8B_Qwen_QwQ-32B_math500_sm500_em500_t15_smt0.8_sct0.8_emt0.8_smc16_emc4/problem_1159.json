            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation here: (3^k)^6 equals 3^6. I need to find the value of k. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you can multiply them. So, (a^b)^c is a^(b*c). Applying that to the left side of the equation, (3^k)^6 should become 3^(6*k). So, the equation simplifies to 3^(6k) equals 3^6.\n\nNow, since the bases are the same (both are 3), the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold true. That means 6k must equal 6. So, I can set up the equation 6k = 6.\n\nTo solve for k, I'll divide both sides by 6. Dividing 6k by 6 gives me k, and dividing 6 by 6 gives me 1. So, k equals 1.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I plug k = 1 back into the original equation: (3^1)^6 becomes (3)^6, which is indeed 3^6. That matches the right side of the equation, so my answer must be correct. I think that's it. k is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\) in the equation \\( (3^k)^6 = 3^6 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   3^{6k} = 3^6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\( \\boxed{1} \\)"
