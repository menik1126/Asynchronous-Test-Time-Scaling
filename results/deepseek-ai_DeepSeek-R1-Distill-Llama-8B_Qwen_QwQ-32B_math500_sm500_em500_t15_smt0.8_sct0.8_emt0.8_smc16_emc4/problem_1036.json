Then, I have to compute the sum of \\(p_i(1)\\) for all these factors.\n\nLet me start by looking at the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). It seems like a quartic in terms of \\(x^4\\), so maybe a substitution can help simplify it. Let me set \\(y = x^4\\). Then the equation becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\\). Hmm, I can try to factor this quadratic equation.\n\nTo factor \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\), I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Let's see, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\). Substituting back in for \\(y = x^4\\), this gives me \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\).\n\nSo, now I have the polynomial factored into two quartic polynomials: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). But I need to check if these quartic polynomials can be factored further over the integers.\n\nLet me first look at \\(x^4 - 1\\). I remember that \\(x^4 - 1\\) is a difference of squares because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and 1 is \\(1^2\\). So, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Then, each of these can be factored further because \\(x^2 - 1\\) is again a difference of squares: \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\). So, putting it all together, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x - "

Let me look at each of these factors:\n\n1. \\(x - 1\\) is a linear polynomial, so it can't be factored further.\n2. \\(x + 1\\) is also linear, so it can't be factored further.\n3. \\(x^2 + 1\\) is a quadratic. Over the integers, can this be factored? Well, \\(x^2 + 1\\) doesn't factor into real polynomials because it has complex roots. So, it remains as is.\n4. Now, check \\(x^4 + 4\\). Hmm, is this factorable over integers? Let me think. \\(x^4 + 4\\) looks similar to a sum of squares, but perhaps it can be factored into quadratics.\n\nI recall that \\(x^4 + 4\\) can be factored using the Sophie Germain identity. The identity states that \\(a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2)\\). Here, if I let \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = 1\\), then it becomes \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). So, that does factor further.\n\nTherefore, \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Both of these are quadratics with discriminant \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), so they don't factor further over the integers.\n\nPutting it all together, the complete factorization of the original polynomial is:\n\n\\[(x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\]\n\nSo, the polynomial is factored into five monic polynomials with integer coefficients,"

All these factors are monic, integer coefficients, and can't be factored further.

Maybe using the original polynomial evaluated at x=1 to check.\n\nLet's compute the original polynomial at x=1: \\(1^8 + 3*1^4 -4 = 1 + 3 -4 = 0\\). Wait, that's zero. So that means 1 is a root of the polynomial. But the factors include \\(x - 1\\), so when we factorize, the constant term would be the product of all roots. But wait, perhaps this gives an alternative way of looking at things.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the product of all these factors equal to the polynomial. So, when x=1, the product equals zero because one of the factors is zero. So, indeed, 1 is a root, which is reflected in \\(x - 1\\) being one of the factors.\n\nThat cross-checks with what I've done before, so I think my approach is correct. So, the sum should be 10.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) factors into \\"
