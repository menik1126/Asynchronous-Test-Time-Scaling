            "output": "First, I need to define variables for the initial number of blue and yellow marbles in the bag. Let's let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles initially.\n\nFrom the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles. So, I can express the initial number of marbles as B = 4k and Y = 3k, where k is a common multiplier.\n\nNext, I'll apply the changes described in the problem. I'm adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles. This changes the number of blue marbles to B + 5 and the number of yellow marbles to Y - 3.\n\nAfter these changes, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles becomes 7:3. So, I can set up the equation (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3.\n\nNow, I'll substitute the initial expressions for B and Y into the equation. This gives me (4k + 5)/(3k - 3) = 7/3.\n\nTo solve for k, I'll cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions. This results in 3*(4k + 5) = 7*(3k - 3). Simplifying both sides, I get 12k + 15 = 21k - 21.\n\nNext, I'll solve for k by moving all terms to one side. Subtracting 12k from both sides gives 15 = 9k - 21. Then, adding 21 to both sides, I find that 36 = 9k. Dividing both sides by 9, I determine that k = 4.\n\nWith k known, I can find the initial number of blue marbles by multiplying 4 by 4, which gives B = 16.\n\nTherefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before any additional marbles were added.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nLet:\n- \\( B \\) = Initial number of blue marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = Initial number of yellow marbles\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Ratio**\n\nGiven the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 4:3 \\), we"
