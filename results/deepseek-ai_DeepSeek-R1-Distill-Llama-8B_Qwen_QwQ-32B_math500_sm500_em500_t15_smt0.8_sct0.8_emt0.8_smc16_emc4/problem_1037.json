Then, I have to sum the values of these polynomials evaluated at \\( x = 1 \\). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the given polynomial: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). The variable is raised to the 8th power, which suggests that maybe substitution could help. I remember that sometimes for polynomials like \\( x^4 + ax^2 + b \\), a substitution like \\( y = x^2 \\) can simplify things. Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me try letting \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). That's a quadratic in terms of \\( y \\), which I can try to factor. Let's see if it factors nicely.\n\nTo factor \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\), I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\).\n\nSubstituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), this becomes \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). Wait, so the original polynomial factors into \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). Now, \\( x^4 - 1 \\) is a difference of squares, so it can be factored further.\n\nIndeed, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - (1)^2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\). And \\( x^2 - 1 \\) is again a difference of squares, so it factors further into \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\).\n\nPutting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\\[ x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)("

However, I should check if any of these can be factored further over the integers.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm, that's a sum of squares, right? \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2)^2 + 2^2 \\). Usually, sums of squares can't be factored over the integers, but wait, \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored if we consider it as a biquadratic. Maybe it factors into two quadratics. Let me try to factor it.\n\nAssume \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) \\). Then expanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\\[ x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd \\]\n\nEquating coefficients with \\( x^4 + 4 \\):\n- Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\): 1 (matches)\n- Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): \\( a + c = 0 \\)\n- Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( ac + b + d = 0 \\)\n- Coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( ad + bc = 0 \\)\n- Constant term: \\( bd = 4 \\)\n\nFrom \\( a + c = 0 \\), we get \\( c = -a \\). Substituting into the other equations:\n\nFrom \\( ad + bc = 0 \\):\n- \\( ad + b(-a) = 0 \\)\n- \\( a(d - b) = 0 \\)\nSo either \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( d = b \\).\n\nIf \\( a = 0 \\), then \\( c = 0 \\). Then, from the constant term \\( bd = 4 \\), possible pairs \\( (b,d) \\) are (1,4), (2,2), (-1,-4), (-2,-2). Plugging into coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n\n\\( ac + b + d = 0 + b + d = b + d = 0 \\)\n\nSo \\( b + d = 0 \\). For integer pairs"

But \\( b*d = 4 \\), so \\( -d^2 = 4 \\) which implies \\( d^2 = -4 \\), which is not possible. So \\( a = 0 \\) leads to no solution.\n\nTherefore, \\( d = b \\). Now, from the constant term \\( bd = 4 \\), so \\( b^2 = 4 \\). Thus, \\( b = 2 \\) or \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nCase 1: \\( b = 2 \\). Then \\( d = 2 \\). From the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( ac + b + d = (-a^2) + 2 + 2 = -a^2 + 4 = 0 \\). So \\( -a^2 + 4 = 0 \\) implies \\( a^2 = 4 \\), so \\( a = 2 \\) or \\( a = -2 \\).\n\nIf \\( a = 2 \\), then \\( c = -2 \\). Check coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( ad + bc = 2*2 + 2*(-2) = 4 - 4 = 0 \\). Perfect.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( a = -2 \\), then \\( c = 2 \\). Coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( ad + bc = (-2)*2 + 2*(-2) = -4 -4 = -8 \\), which isn't zero, so that's not acceptable.\n\nSo, only \\( a = 2 \\), \\( c = -2 \\) gives a valid factorization. Thus, \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nLet me double-check that:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 -4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 -4x + 4 \\)\nSimplify:\n-"

Therefore, the complete factorization is:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1) \\)\n\nNow, we need to compute the sum \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) \\), where each \\( p_i(x) \\) is one of these monic irreducible polynomials.\n\nSo let's compute each evaluation at \\( x=1 \\):\n\n1. \\( p_1(x) = x^2 + 2x"

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, could \\( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\) factor differently? For example, could it factor into more than five factors?

Alternatively, perhaps using Sophie Germain identity or something similar?\n\nWait, but I already used substitution \\( y = x^4 \\) and got \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 -1) \\), and then factored further.
