            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about bus riders at Central H.S. They surveyed 300 males and 300 females in each grade, and they want to know for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 135% means in this context. If the number of males is 135% of females, that implies there are more males than females. So, for each grade, I can calculate the number of males and females who ride the bus and then see if males are 135% of females.\n\nLooking at the table, each grade has males and females percentages. Since they surveyed 300 males and 300 females in each grade, I can calculate the actual numbers by multiplying the percentages by 300. Let me do that for each grade.\n\nStarting with the 9th grade: males are 41.1%, so 41.1% of 300 is 0.411 * 300 = 123.3 males. Females are 39.4%, so that's 0.394 * 300 ≈ 118.2 females. Now, to find out if males are 135% of females, I need to see if 123.3 equals 1.35 * 118.2. Let me calculate 1.35 * 118.2: 118.2 * 1 is 118.2, 118.2 * 0.35 is approximately 41.37, so total is about 159.57. Clearly, 123.3 is not close to 159.57, so 9th grade isn't the one.\n\nMoving on to the 10th grade: males are 34.4%, so 0.344 * 300 = 103.2 males. Females are 33.1%, so 0.331 * 300 ≈ 99.3 females. Again, I'll check if 103.2 is 135% of 99.3. 99.3 * 1.35: 99.3 + 39.585 ≈ 138.885. 103.2 is nowhere near that, so 10th grade isn't it either.\n\nNext is the 11th grade: males are 20.6%, so 0.206 *"

            "output": " 300 = 61.8 males. Females are 13.8%, which is 0.138 * 300 = 41.4 females. Now, is 61.8 equal to 1.35 * 41.4? Let's compute that: 41.4 * 1.35. 41.4 + (41.4 * 0.35) = 41.4 + 14.59 ≈ 56.09. Hmm, 61.8 is higher than 56.09, but not too far off. Maybe this is the closest?\n\nLastly, the 12th grade: males are 11.6%, so 0.116 * 300 = 34.8 males. Females are 8.6%, which is 0.086 * 300 = 25.8 females. Now, checking if 34.8 is 135% of 25.8: 25.8 * 1.35. 25.8 + (25.8 * 0.35). 25.8 + 9.03 ≈ 34.83. Oh! That's really close. 34.8 is almost exactly 135% of 25.8, which is 34.83. That seems like a perfect match.\n\nWait, but the 11th grade was 61.8 males vs. 56.09 females as 135%, which is a difference of about 5.71, and the 12th grade is 34.8 vs. 34.83, which is almost the same. So actually, the 12th grade is spot on. But let me double-check the calculations just to be sure.\n\nFor 11th grade: 1.35 * 41.4 = 1.35 * 40 = 54, 1.35 * 1.4 = 1.89, so total is 54 + 1.89 = 55.89, which I approximated as 56.09 earlier. The actual number of males is 61.8, so the difference is 61.8 - 55.89 = 5.91.\n\nFor 12th grade: 25.8 * 1.35 = 25.8 + (25.8 * 0.35) = 25.8 + 9.03 = 34"

            "output": ".83, which matches exactly with 34.8 males. So the 12th grade is perfect. Hmm, but the question says \"closest,\" so maybe even if it's a tiny bit off, it's still the closest.\n\nWait, but in the 12th grade, it's actually exactly 135%, right? Because 34.8 is exactly 135% of 25.8. So that must be the answer. But let me make sure I haven't made any calculation mistakes.\n\nRechecking 12th grade:\n\n25.8 * 1.35 = ?\n\n25.8 * 1 = 25.8\n\n25.8 * 0.35 = 25.8 * 0.3 + 25.8 * 0.05 = 7.74 + 1.29 = 8.03\n\nAdding together: 25.8 + 8.03 = 33.83. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Earlier I thought it was 34.83, but now it's 33.83. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the multiplication earlier?\n\nWait, no, 25.8 * 0.35: 25.8 * 0.3 is 7.74, 25.8 * 0.05 is 1.29, so 7.74 + 1.29 = 8.03. So total is 25.8 + 8.03 = 33.83, which is approximately 33.83, but the males are 34.8. So that's a difference of about 0.97. Whereas in the 11th grade, the difference was about 5.91.\n\nWait, so 12th grade is very close, just off by about 1%, while 11th grade is off by about 8%. So 12th grade is closer. Therefore, grade 12 is the answer.\n\nHmm, but earlier I thought 12th grade was exact, but upon recalculating, it's 33.83 vs. 34.8, so not exact. Wait, maybe I did it wrong. Let me calculate 25.8 * 1.35 again.\n\n25.8 * 1.35: let's do it as 25.8 * (1 + 0.35) = 25"

Wait, 0.35 is 0.3 + 0.05, so 25.8 * 0.35 is 25.8*(0.3+0.05)=25.8*0.35. Wait, 25.8 * 0.35 is actually 25.8 multiplied by 0.35. Let me do it step by step:\n\n25.8 * 0.35:\n\nFirst, 25 * 0.35 = 8.75\n\n0.8 * 0.35 = 0.28\n\nSo total is 8.75 + 0.28 = 9.03. So that's correct. So 25.8 * 0.35 is 9.03, so total is 25.8 + 9.03 = 34.83. Wait, so my first calculation was right. Then why did I get confused?\n\nAh, I think I miscalculated earlier when I thought it was 33.83. So actually, 25.8 * 1.35 is 34.83, which is very close to 34.8. The male riders are 34.8, so the difference is 34.83 - 34.8 = 0.03. That's a difference of 0.03, which is really, really close. So that's almost exactly 135%.\n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation when I thought it was 33.83. So actually, 25.8 * 1.35 is indeed 34.83, so the male riders are 34.8, which is just 0.03 less. That's practically spot"

So 5.71 difference versus 0.03 difference. Therefore, the 12th grade is the closest.\n\nSo I think I initially made a mistake in calculating 25.8 * 1.35 as 33.83, but upon correcting it, it's actually 34.83, making the 12th grade the exact match, with a tiny error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers were rounded in the percentages, so it's possible that in reality, it's supposed to be exact. So I think the answer is the 12th grade.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders, we calculate the actual number of male and female riders for each grade by multiplying the given percentages by 300 (since 300 males and 300 females were surveyed in each grade).\n\nFor each grade, we check if the number of male riders equals 1.35 times the number of female riders. The 12th grade shows a near-perfect match, with male riders being 34.8 and female riders being 25.8, yielding 1.35 times the female count, which is extremely close.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{12^{\\mathrm{th}}\\ grade}"
