The solutions to this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon. The area is supposed to be expressible in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are relatively prime. Then I have to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the equation is a quartic, meaning it's a fourth-degree polynomial. So, it should have four solutions, which are the four vertices of a convex polygon. Maybe a quadrilateral? Or perhaps a triangle since some solutions might coincide, but given it's a convex polygon, likely a quadrilateral.\n\nFirst, I should try to factor the equation. Maybe it can be factored into quadratics or something else. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). The coefficients involve powers of \\( i \\). Maybe it's related to cyclotomic polynomials or something with roots of unity? Alternatively, maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it.\n\nLet me try a substitution. Let me let \\( w = z + a \\), trying to eliminate some terms. Or perhaps a substitution for \\( z = iy \\) or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a quadratic in \\( z^2 \\). Let me see.\n\nWait, the equation is \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \\). Let me check if it's a quadratic in \\( z^2 \\) but probably not because the exponents are 4,3,2,1,0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a biquadratic, but here it's quartic, but with all degrees. Hmm, maybe another substitution.\n\nI notice the coefficients 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. The coefficients seem to be following a pattern. Let me write them out:\n\n1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i.\n\nHmm, maybe grouping terms. Maybe grouping as \\( (z^4 + 4i z"

Let me compute \\( (z + i)^4 \\):\n\nFirst, \\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4 z^3 i + 6 z^2 (i)^2 + 4 z (i)^3 + (i)^4 \\).\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n1. \\( z^4 \\)\n2. \\( 4 z^3 (i) \\)\n3. \\( 6 z^2 (i^2) = 6 z^2 (-1) = -6 z^2 \\)\n4. \\( 4 z (i^3) = 4 z (-i) = -4i z \\)\n5. \\( (i^4) = 1 \\)\n\nSo, altogether, \\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 \\). \n\nWait a second! Comparing that to the given polynomial: the given polynomial is \\( z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z - i \\). The difference between the two is that the constant term here is \\(1\\) in the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\), but the given equation has \\( -i \\). So, close but not quite. Hmm.\n\nSo, the given polynomial is \\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) \\). Let me check that.\n\nLet me compute \\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) \\):\n\n\\( (z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1) - (1 + i) = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 -1 -i = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i \\).\n\nYes! That's exactly the given equation. Therefore, the equation is \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).\n\nSo that simplifies things! The equation is \\((z + i)^4 = 1 + i\\).

So, each point is at (radius, angle) from the origin, but since the center is at -i (i.e., (0, -1)), the polygon is centered at (0, -1).

However, since the center is not at the origin, it's a square centered at (0, -1). But how does that affect the area? The area is determined by the positions of the vertices, regardless of the center. So, a square is a square; whether it's centered at (0, -1) or (0,0) doesn't change its area. So, the area can be computed as the area of a square with side length related to the distance between adjacent vertices.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to compute the area more directly. Since all four points are on a circle, they form a square inscribed in that circle. The radius \\(r = 2^{1/8}\\), so the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is \\(2r = 2 \\times 2^{1/8} = 2^{9/8}\\).\n\nWait, for a square, if the diagonal is \\(d\\), then the area is \\( (d^2)/2 \\). So, the area would be \\( ( (2^{9/8})^2 ) / 2 = (2^{9/4}) / 2 = 2^{9/4 - 1} = 2^{5/4} = \\sqrt[4]{32} \\).

It's a property of the shape and the distances between the points, not their absolute positions.
