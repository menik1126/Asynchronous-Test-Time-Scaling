Alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with cubic equations, sometimes it's helpful to expand the terms or look for patterns that might simplify things. Let me see if there's a way to simplify the left side or the right side.\n\nLooking at the right side, (2x - 10)^3. I notice that 2x -10 is actually 2*(x - 5). Maybe I can rewrite that to see if it helps with the left side. So, (2x -10)^3 = [2(x -5)]^3 = 8(x -5)^3. Hmm, interesting. So now the equation becomes:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = 8(x -5)^3.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I should expand each side to see if something cancels or combines nicely. Let's start by expanding the left side.\n\nExpanding (x - 3)^3: I can use the binomial theorem. (a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3.\n\nSo, (x -3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x -27.\n\nSimilarly, expanding (x -7)^3: (x -7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x -343.\n\nAdding these two together: (x^3 -9x^2 +27x -27) + (x^3 -21x^2 +147x -343) = 2x^3 -30x^2 +174x -370.\n\nNow, the right side is 8(x -5)^3. Let me expand that as well.\n\n(x -5)^3 = x^3 -15x^2 +75x -125.\n\nMultiplying by 8: 8x^3 -120x^2 +600x -1000.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n2x^3 -30x^2 +174x -370 = 8x^3 -120x^2 +600x -100"

Subtracting the left side from both sides:\n\n0 = 8x^3 -120x^2 +600x -1000 - (2x^3 -30x^2 +174x -370).\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0 = 6x^3 -90x^2 +426x -630.\n\nHmm, that's a cubic equation: 6x^3 -90x^2 +426x -630 = 0.\n\nI can probably simplify this equation by dividing all terms by a common factor. Let's see, 6, 90, 426, 630. They are all divisible by 6, I think.\n\nDividing each term by 6: x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 = 0.\n\nAlright, so the equation is x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 = 0. Now, I need to solve this cubic equation. Maybe I can try rational root theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient. The constant term is -105, and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b15, \u00b17, \u00b115, \u00b121, \u00b135, \u00b1105.\n\nLet me test these one by one.\n\nFirst, x=1: 1 -15 +71 -105 = (1 -15) + (71 -105) = (-14) + (-34) = -48 \u2260 0.\n\nx=3: 27 -135 +213 -105 = (27 -135) + (213 -105) = (-108) + 108 = 0. Ah, x=3 is a root!\n\nGreat, so (x -3) is a factor. Now, I can perform polynomial division to factor the cubic equation.\n\nLet me divide x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 by (x -3). Using synthetic division:\n\n3 | 1  -15  71  -105\n\nMultiply and add:\n\nBring down 1.\n\n1*3=3, add to -15: -12.\n\n-12*3= -36, add to 71: 35.\n\n35*3=105, add to -105: 0. Perfect.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x"

So, (x -5)(x -7).\n\nTherefore, the equation factors completely as (x -3)(x -5)(x -7) = 0.\n\nThus, the roots are x=3, x=5, and x=7.\n\nWait a second, let me check these roots in the original equation to make sure I did everything correctly, because sometimes when expanding and simplifying, mistakes can happen.\n\nFirst, check x=3:\n\nLeft side: (3-3)^3 + (3-7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 -64 = -64.\n\nRight side: (2*3 -10)^3 = (6-10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64.\n\nSo, yes, works.\n\nNext, x=5:\n\nLeft side: (5-3)^3 + (5-7)^3 = (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 -8 = 0.\n\nRight side: (2*5 -10)^3 = (10 -10)^3 = 0^3 = 0. So, works.\n\nLastly, x=7:\n\nLeft side: (7-3)^3 + (7-7)^3 = (4)^3 + 0 = 64 + 0 = 64.\n\nRight side: (2*7 -10)^3 = (14 -10)^3 = 4^3 = 64. So, works.\n\nAll roots check out. Therefore, the roots are 3, 5, and7.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\((x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x -10)^3\\) can be simplified by recognizing that both sides are cubic expressions. By expanding and simplifying, we find that the equation reduces to \\((x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0\\). Therefore, the roots are \\(x = 3\\), \\(x = 5\\), and \\(x = 7\\).\n\n**Answer:** The roots are \\boxed{3}, \\boxed{5}, and \\boxed{7}."
