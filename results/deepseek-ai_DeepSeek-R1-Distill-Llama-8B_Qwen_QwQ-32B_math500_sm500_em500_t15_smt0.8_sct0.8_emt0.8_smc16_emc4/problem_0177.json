            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: given that z is 1 plus i, and w is (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). I need to find the modulus of w, which is |w|. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that z is a complex number, 1 + i. That means z has a real part, which is 1, and an imaginary part, which is 1i. So z = 1 + i. Got that down.\n\nNow, w is given as (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). Since both z and w are complex numbers, I probably need to compute both the numerator and the denominator separately before I can find the modulus of w. Modulus of a complex number a + bi is the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So once I have w expressed in the form a + bi, I can compute its modulus.\n\nAlright, let me write down the numerator first: 3z + 1. Since z is 1 + i, plugging that in, it's 3*(1 + i) + 1. Let me compute that. 3 times 1 is 3, and 3 times i is 3i. So adding the 1, it becomes 3 + 3i + 1, which simplifies to 4 + 3i. So the numerator is 4 + 3i.\n\nNext, the denominator: 5z + 7. Again, substitute z with 1 + i. So it's 5*(1 + i) + 7. Calculating that, 5*1 is 5, and 5*i is 5i. Adding the 7, it becomes 5 + 5i + 7, which simplifies to 12 + 5i. So the denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nNow, w is the numerator divided by the denominator: (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). To find the modulus of w, I can use the formula for modulus of a quotient. I recall that |w| = |numerator| / |denominator|. That's because the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli.\n\nSo let's compute |numerator| first. The numerator is 4 + 3"

            "output": "i. The modulus is sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5. Got that.\n\nNow, compute |denominator|. The denominator is 12 + 5i. Its modulus is sqrt(12^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13. Okay, so the modulus of w is 5 divided by 13, right?\n\nWait a second, that seems straightforward. But just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor the numerator: 3z + 1 where z = 1 + i. 3*(1 + i) is 3 + 3i. Adding 1 gives 4 + 3i. That's correct.\n\nDenominator: 5z + 7. 5*(1 + i) is 5 + 5i. Adding 7 gives 12 + 5i. That also checks out.\n\nThen, modulus of numerator: sqrt(4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) is 5. Denominator modulus: sqrt(12\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) is 13. So |w| is 5/13.\n\nHmm, seems right. But another approach is to express w in the form a + bi and then compute the modulus. Maybe I should try that to confirm.\n\nSo, let's compute w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). To express this in a + bi form, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i.\n\nSo, w = [(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i)] / [(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)]. Let me compute the denominator first because it's a standard multiplication resulting in a real number.\n\nDenominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i) = 12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2 = 144 - 25i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 is -1, this becomes 144 - 25*(-1) = 144 + 25 = 169. So the denominator is 169.\n\nNow the numerator: (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i). Let's expand that. 4*12"

The real parts are 48 and -15i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 is -1, -15i\u00b2 is 15. So real parts: 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nImaginary parts: -20i + 36i = 16i. So the numerator is 63 + 16i.\n\nTherefore, w = (63 + 16i)/169. So we can write w as (63/169) + (16/169)i.\n\nNow, compute the modulus of w: sqrt[(63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2]. Let's factor out 1/169: sqrt[(63\u00b2 + 16\u00b2)/169\u00b2] = sqrt[(3969 + 256)/28561]. Because 63 squared is 3969, and 16 squared is 256. So 3969 + 256 is 4225.\n\nSo sqrt(4225/28561) = sqrt(4225)/sqrt(28561). Now, sqrt(4225) is 65 because 65*65=4225. Sqrt(28561) is 169 because 169*169=28561. So the modulus is 65/169, which simplifies to 5/13. Because 65 divided by 13 is 5, and 169 divided by 13 is 13.\n\nSo both methods give me the same result, 5/13. Therefore, I'm confident that |w| is indeed 5/13.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Compute numerator: 3z + 1 = 4 + 3i | | = 5\n2. Compute denominator: 5z + 7 = 12 + 5i | | = 13\n3. |w| = 5/13\n\nAlternatively, by rationalizing the denominator, I found w as 63/169 + 16/169 i, whose modulus is sqrt((63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2) = 65/169 = 5/13.\n\nSo both ways confirm that"
