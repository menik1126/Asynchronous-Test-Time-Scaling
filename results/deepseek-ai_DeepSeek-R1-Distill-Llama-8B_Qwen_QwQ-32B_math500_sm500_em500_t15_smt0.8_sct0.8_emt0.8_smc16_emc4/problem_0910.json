To do this, I should express the denominator as a power of 10 since the base 10 system is the foundation for decimals.\n\nThe denominator is \\( 2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\). I notice that the prime factors include both 2s and 5s, which are the prime factors of 10. The goal is to create a power of 10 by making the exponents of both 2 and 5 equal.\n\nRight now, there are 2 twos and 7 fives. To make them equal, I'll need to multiply the denominator by \\( 2^{5} \\) so that the total number of twos becomes 7, matching the number of fives. This adjustment will give me \\( 10^7 \\).\n\nSo, multiplying the denominator by \\( 2^5 \\) converts the denominator into a power of 10:\n\\[\n2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\cdot 2^5 = 10^7\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll adjust the numerator accordingly by multiplying it by \\( 2^5 \\) to keep the fraction equivalent:\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\cdot 2^5}{10^7} = \\frac{21 \\cdot 32}{10^7} = \\frac{672}{10^7}\n\\]\n\nFinally, dividing 672 by \\( 10^7 \\) will result in a terminating decimal. Calculating this division:\n\\[\n\\frac{672}{10^7} = 0.0000672\n\\]\n</think>\n\nSure, let's convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Denominator\nFirst, we'll express the denominator as a power of 10. The denominator is:\n\\[\n2^2 \\cdot 5^7\n\\]\n\nTo make this a power of 10, we need equal numbers of both 2 and 5 in the prime factors. Currently, there are:\n- 2 factors of 2\n- 7 factors of 5\n\nWe'll multiply the denominator by \\(2^5\\) to make the number of 2s equal to the number of "
