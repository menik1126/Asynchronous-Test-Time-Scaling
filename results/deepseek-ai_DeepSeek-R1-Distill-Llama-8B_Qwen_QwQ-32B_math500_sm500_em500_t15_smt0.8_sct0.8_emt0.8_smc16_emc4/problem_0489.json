The cube has the shortest possible side lengths. I need to find the volume of the cube in cubic inches. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize what's happening. There's a cube, and from each of its eight corners, they're removing some metal to form a sphere. So, the sphere must fit perfectly into the space where the metal was removed. That means the sphere is inscribed in the cube in some way.\n\nWait, actually, when you remove metal from the corners of a cube, each corner is a small polyhedron, maybe a pyramid or something. But in this case, it says it forms a sphere. So, the shape removed must be such that when you take out material from all eight corners, you end up with a sphere. That suggests that the sphere is perfectly fitting into the space created by the cube after the corners are removed.\n\nSo, maybe the sphere is inscribed such that it touches the midpoints of the cube's edges or something like that. Let me think about the cube. A cube has all sides equal, right? So, if we're removing metal from each corner, the amount removed from each corner should be the same to make a perfect sphere.\n\nI remember that when you remove a corner of a cube, you can model it as cutting off a small octahedral shape, but since the result is a sphere, perhaps each corner is being removed such that the sphere is centered at the center of the cube.\n\nWait, the sphere has a 3-inch radius, so its diameter is 6 inches. Since the sphere is inscribed within the cube, the diameter of the sphere should be equal to the space diagonal of the cube. No, wait, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, if you have a cube, and you remove material from each corner to form a sphere, the sphere must touch the centers of each face of the cube. Because each corner is removed equally, right? So, the sphere's diameter would be equal to the edge length of the cube.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound quite right. Let's take it step by step.\n\nLet me denote the side length of the cube as 's'. When we remove a corner, we're"

Hmm, maybe the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that it touches the centers of the cube's faces. In that case, the sphere's diameter would equal the edge length of the cube. So, the sphere's radius would be half the edge length. But the sphere's radius is given as 3 inches, so the edge length would be 6 inches, making the cube's volume 6^3 = 216. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem mentions removing metal from the corners, so maybe it's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that it touches the midpoints of the edges. Wait, but the sphere is formed by removing the corners. Let me think of the cube and the sphere inside it. The sphere must be entirely within the cube, and the corners of the cube are the parts that are removed. So, the sphere must be tangent to the original cube's edges or faces?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the cube. Wait, that would make the sphere's diameter longer than the edge length, which can't be because the sphere has to fit inside the cube. The space diagonal of a cube with edge length 's' is s\u221a3. If the sphere's diameter is equal to that, then the sphere would extend beyond the cube's faces, which isn't possible. So that's not right.\n\nHmm, maybe the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces. In that case, the sphere's diameter would equal the edge length of the cube. So, if the sphere's radius is 3, then the edge length is 6, so volume is 216. But the problem says the cube has the shortest possible side lengths. Maybe there's a different configuration where the cube can be smaller?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that it touches the edges of the cube. Let me think. The sphere touches the edges, so the distance from the center of the cube to the edge is equal to the radius. The center of the cube is at (s/2, s/2, s/2). The distance from the center"

That's the same result as before, so the volume would be 216.\n\nWait, but maybe the sphere is formed by removing each corner as a pyramid, where each pyramid's apex is at the corner, and its base is a triangle on each face of the cube. So, the volume removed would be the volume of the pyramids, and the sphere would have a radius such that the pyramids' height is such that the sphere's radius is 3 inches. Let me try to model this.\n\nSuppose we have a cube with edge length 's'. At each corner, we remove a right-angled pyramid with legs of length 'a' along the x, y, and z axes. When you remove all eight pyramids, the resulting shape is a sphere. Wait, no, that can't be right because each pyramid's removal would create a concave shape, not a sphere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says the sphere is formed by removing metal from the corners of the cube, so each corner is being cut off, and the removed parts together form the sphere. But that seems unlikely because the sphere is a smooth surface, while the removed parts would create a more complex shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each corner is removed such that the sphere is centered at the cube's center, and each corner removal creates a portion of the sphere. But I'm not sure how that would work. Maybe each corner is a spherical cap, and when you remove eight spherical caps from the cube, you end up with a sphere? That seems a bit contradictory because the cube would then enclose the sphere, and removing parts of the cube to form the sphere would require precise calculation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the sphere is entirely inside the cube, and the cube is the smallest possible cube that can contain the sphere after having the corners removed. But that doesn't make much sense because a sphere inside a cube would just have the cube's edge length equal to the sphere's diameter, which is 6 inches.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, so the cube is larger than the sphere"

If you remove the corners of a cube, the remaining shape is a convex polyhedron, but a sphere is a smooth surface. So perhaps the sphere is the shape that is left after removing the corners? That might not be possible unless the corners are removed in a way that the remaining part is a sphere. Hmm, maybe the cube is the minimal cube that can contain the sphere, but the sphere is inscribed in the cube. Wait, but inscribed sphere in a cube has diameter equal to the edge length, so again 6 inches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere touches the cube's edges. Let me think again. The sphere is inside the cube, and the corners of the cube are removed so that the sphere is the remaining part.

Maybe the sphere is the largest possible sphere that can fit inside the cube after removing the corners.

But the sphere's radius is 3, so s/\u221a2 = 3, so s = 3\u221a2 \u2248 4.24 inches. That's smaller than 6 inches, which would make the cube's volume (3\u221a2)^3 \u2248 54 cubic inches, which is much smaller than 216. But wait, does that make sense? Because if the sphere is tangent to the edges, then the cube's edge length would be 3\u221a2 inches, which is about 4.24 inches.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: If the sphere is tangent to the midpoints of the cube's edges, then the radius of the sphere is equal to the distance from the cube's center to the midpoint of an edge, which is s/\u221a2. Since the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, that gives s/\u221a2 = 3, so s = 3\u221a2.

If the cube has edge length s = 3\u221a2 inches, then each corner is a right-angled corner, and when we remove the corners, we might end up with a sphere. Wait, but how? The removal of corners would create a rounded shape, but I'm not sure if it's a perfect sphere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

So, which is correct?\n\nI think the key is that the sphere is formed by removing the cube's corners. So, the cube's corners are spheres' parts. So, each corner of the cube is removed as a small octant of a sphere. Since the sphere is made by removing all eight corners, each corner removal is an eighth of the sphere. Therefore, the total volume removed is equal to the volume of the sphere.\n\nSo, the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its volume is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0(27) = 36\u03c0 cubic inches. But wait, that's the sphere's volume, so if each corner removed is an eighth of the sphere, then each corner's volume is (36\u03c0)/8 = 4.5\u03c0. But since there are eight corners, the total volume removed is 8*(4.5\u03c0) = 36\u03c0, which equals the sphere's volume.

The corner is a right angle, and the sphere touches the edges at some point. The distance from the corner to the point where the sphere touches the edge is the same along each edge. Let me denote this distance as 'a'. So, along each edge from the corner, the sphere touches the edge at a distance 'a' from the corner. The sphere's center is at the center of the cube, so the distance from the center to the corner is (s/2)*\u221a3 (since the corner is at (0,0,0) and the center is at (s/2, s/2, s/2)). The distance from the center to the point where the sphere touches the edge is the radius, which is 3 inches.\n\nWait, let me formalize this. Let me consider the cube with edge length 's', centered at the origin for simplicity. The corners are at (\u00b1s/2, \u00b1s/2, \u00b1s/2). The sphere is centered at the origin with radius 3. The sphere must touch the edges of the cube. Let's consider an edge along the positive x-axis from (s/2, -s/2, -s/2) to (s/2, s/2, s/2). Wait, actually, edges are along the axes. Let me pick an edge along the x-axis from (0,0,0) to (s,0,0). The sphere is centered at (s/2, s/2, s/2). The distance from the center to the edge can be calculated as follows.\n\nTake a point on the edge, say (x,0,0) where 0 \u2264 x \u2264 s. The distance from the center (s/2, s/2, s/2) to this point is sqrt( (x - s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 ). The minimal distance from the center to the edge is the minimal value of this expression over x in [0, s]. To find the minimal distance, take derivative with respect to x and set to zero.\n\nLet me compute the distance squared to make it easier: D\u00b2 = (x - s/2)^2 + (s"

            "output": "/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 = (x - s/2)^2 + s\u00b2/2.\n\nTo minimize D\u00b2, set derivative with respect to x to zero: 2(x - s/2)*1 = 0 \u21d2 x = s/2. So the minimal distance is sqrt(0 + s\u00b2/2 + s\u00b2/2) = sqrt(s\u00b2) = s. Wait, that can't be right because the minimal distance from the center to the edge should be less than s.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the points. Let's see, a point on the edge is (x, 0, 0) where 0 \u2264 x \u2264 s. The center is at (s/2, s/2, s/2). The distance squared is (x - s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 = (x - s/2)^2 + s\u00b2/2. The minimal value of this is when (x - s/2)^2 is zero, so x = s/2. Then the minimal distance squared is s\u00b2/2, so minimal distance is s/\u221a2. Therefore, the minimal distance from the center to the edge is s/\u221a2.\n\nSince the sphere must touch the edges, this minimal distance must equal the sphere's radius, which is 3. So, s/\u221a2 = 3 \u21d2 s = 3\u221a2 inches. Therefore, the cube's edge length is 3\u221a2 inches, so the volume is (3\u221a2)^3 = 27 * (2\u221a2) = 54\u221a2 cubic inches.\n\nSo, that seems to make sense. Therefore, the cube's volume is 54\u221a2 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nThe cube has the shortest possible side length when the sphere is tangent to the edges of the cube. The radius of the sphere is 3 inches, so the distance from the center of the cube to the midpoint of an edge equals the radius, which gives the edge length of the cube as 3\u221a2 inches. The volume of the cube is then calculated as (3\u221a2)\u00b3 = 54\u221a2 cubic inches.\n\n$\\boxed{54\\sqrt{2}}$ cubic inches."
