The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours and 1 kilometer in 90 seconds at the same speed.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the robot's speed in meters per second. Converting 2.5 hours to seconds by multiplying by 3600 gives 9000 seconds. Then, dividing the distance by the time, the speed is 1000 meters per 9000 seconds, which simplifies to 100/9 meters per second or approximately 11.11 meters per second.\n\nNext, I'll find out how many meters the robot moves in 90 seconds by multiplying the speed by the time: 90 seconds multiplied by 100/9 meters per second equals 1000 meters. Therefore, the hallway is 1000 meters long.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours at a constant speed.\n- The robot travels the length of a hallway in 90 seconds at the same constant speed.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Robot's Speed in Meters per Second**\n\nFirst, we need to find the speed of the robot in meters per second (m/s).\n\n1. Convert 2.5 hours to seconds:\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 9000 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n   \n2. Calculate the speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{100}{9} \\text{ m/s} \\approx 11.11 \\text{ m/s}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Length of the Hallway**\n\nThe robot travels the length of the hallway in 90 seconds at the same speed.\n\n1. Calculate the length using the speed:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = \\frac{100}{9} \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ s} = 1000 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe"
