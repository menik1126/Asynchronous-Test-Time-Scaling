Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, I'll count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\( 42! \\).\n\nFirst, I'll identify how many multiples of 5 are in the numbers from 1 to 42. There are 8 such numbers.\n\nNext, I'll calculate how many multiples of 25 (since 25 contributes an extra 5) are in this range. The only such number is 25, so there is 1 extra 5.\n\nFinally, I'll add the number of basic 5s and the extra 5s from multiples of 25 to find the total number of 5s, which is 8 plus 1, totaling 9.\n\nNow, I'll determine the number of 2s in the prime factors of \\( 42! \\). There are 21 multiples of 2, 10 multiples of 4, 5 multiples of 8, 2 multiples of 16, and 1 multiple of 32. Adding these up gives me 21 plus 10 plus 5 plus 2 plus 1, totaling 39.\n\nSince there are more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros in \\( 42! \\) is determined by the number of 5s, which is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\( 42! \\), we need to count how many times the factor \\( 10 \\) appears in the product. Since \\( 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\), each trailing zero is created by multiplying a pair of \\( 2 \\) and \\( 5 \\) from the prime factors of the numbers in the factorial.\n\nHere's how to calculate it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\( 42! \\):**\n   \n   - Each multiple of \\( 5 \\) contributes at least one \\( 5 \\).\n   - Each multiple of \\( 25 \\) (since \\( 25 = 5^2 \\)) contributes an extra \\( 5 \\).\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 5s} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5}"
