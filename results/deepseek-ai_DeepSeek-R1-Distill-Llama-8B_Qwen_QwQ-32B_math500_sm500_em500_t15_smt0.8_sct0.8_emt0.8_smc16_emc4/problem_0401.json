This happens when the number of revolutions each has made is an integer multiple of their respective periods. \n\nLet \\( t \\) be the time in seconds when both gears point north again. \nFor the first gear: \\( \\frac{5}{9}t \\) must be an integer. \nFor the second gear: \\( \\frac{3}{4}t \\) must also be an integer.\n\nThis means \\( t \\) must be a common multiple of the periods of both gears. \nThe least common multiple (LCM) of the periods will give the smallest time when both gears align.\n\nCalculating the LCM of \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) involves finding the LCM of their numerators divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their denominators.\nThe LCM of 9 and 4 is 36, and the GCD of 5 and 3 is 1. \nSo, the LCM of \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) is \\( \\frac{36}{1} = 36 \\) seconds.\n\nFinally, multiplying 36 seconds by the number of revolutions per second for each gear confirms that both gears will align their marks pointing north after 36 seconds.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's determine after how many seconds the two gears will next have both their marks pointing due north.\n\n1. **Convert Gear Speeds to Revolutions per"
