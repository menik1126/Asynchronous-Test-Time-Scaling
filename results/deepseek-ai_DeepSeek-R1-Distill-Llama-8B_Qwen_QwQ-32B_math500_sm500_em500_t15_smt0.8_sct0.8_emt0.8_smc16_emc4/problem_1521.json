Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that we have a sequence \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\) of positive real numbers. The sums given are:\n\n1. \\( \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n2. \\( \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n3. \\( \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, we're dealing with sums of powers of the sequence elements. That reminds me of moments in statistics or maybe inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or H\u00f6lder's inequality. Let me think about how I can relate these sums to something that can give me information about \\( n \\).\n\nLet me denote the sums as:\n\n- \\( S_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n- \\( S_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n- \\( S_3 = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nI wonder if these sums can help me find \\( n \\) by relating them somehow. Maybe using some inequality or identity that connects these power sums.\n\nI recall that for any sequence of positive numbers, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can be applied. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in its basic form is:\n\n\\( \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \\right) \\)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Maybe if I set \\( b_i = 1 \\) for all \\( i \\), then it becomes:\n\n\\( \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\cdot 1 \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\"

But is this the only constraint? Probably not. Let me think if there are other inequalities or methods that can give me a maximum value for \\( n \\).\n\nI also remember that in the case of all \\( a_i \\) being equal, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality turns into equality. So, if all the \\( a_i \\) are equal, that might give me another condition.\n\nIf all \\( a_i = c \\), then \\( n c = 96 \\) so \\( c = 96 / n \\).\n\nThen, \\( S_2 = n c^2 = n (96/n)^2 = (96)^2 / n \\). From the problem, \\( S_2 = 144 \\), so:\n\n\\( (96)^2 / n = 144 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\( n = (96)^2 / 144 \\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n96^2 = 9216, so 9216 / 144 = 64.\n\nSo, if all \\( a_i \\) are equal, then \\( n = 64 \\). From the earlier Cauchy-Schwarz result, we also have that \\( n \\geq 64 \\). So that suggests that \\( n = 64 \\) is the minimal possible value, but could there be a larger \\( n \\)?\n\nWait, I need to check if larger \\( n \\) is possible. That is, can we have more terms \\( n > 64 \\) such that the sums \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\) are still 96, 144, 216?\n\nTo see if \\( n \\) can be larger, let me consider what happens when"

Hmm, so maybe making one term large and others small would actually make \\( S_2 \\) too big?\n\nAlternatively, maybe making some terms larger and some smaller in a way that balances the sums.

The Power Mean Inequality states that for positive real numbers,\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{S_1}{n} \\right)^k \\leq \\frac{S_k}{n} \\)\n\nWait, actually, the Power Mean Inequality is usually between different exponents.

So, when k=64,\n\nx = 96/64 - 1.5 = 1.5 -1.5=0. But x must be positive, so x=0 is invalid because a_i must be positive. Therefore, k=32.\n\nWhen k=32, compute x:\n\nx=96/32 -1.5= 3 -1.5=1.5. So all variables are 1.5, which brings us back to n=64.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, in this two-variable case, even when forcing some variables to 1.5, the only valid solution is when all variables are 1.5, so n=64.\n\nTherefore, no other n is possible. So, n=64 is the only possible value.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of n is 64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{64}\n</think>\n\nGiven a sequence \\((a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)\\) of positive real numbers with the constraints:\n\n1. \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96\\)\n2. \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = "
