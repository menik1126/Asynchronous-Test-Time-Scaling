            "output": "First, I recognize that the total number of cards is 54, and it's being distributed equally among \\( x \\) players, with each player receiving \\( y \\) cards. This means that \\( x \\times y = 54 \\).\n\nSince each player must receive at least 5 cards, I can set up the inequality \\( y \\geq 5 \\). Substituting \\( y \\) from the equation \\( y = \\frac{54}{x} \\), this becomes \\( \\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5 \\).\n\nTo solve the inequality, I multiply both sides by \\( x \\) (assuming \\( x \\) is positive, which it must be since it represents the number of players), yielding \\( 54 \\geq 5x \\). Dividing both sides by 5 gives \\( x \\leq \\frac{54}{5} \\), which simplifies to \\( x \\leq 10.8 \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be an integer and at least 2, the possible values of \\( x \\) are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Counting these, there are 9 possible values for \\( x \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values for \\( x \\) (the number of players), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Distribution:**\n   - Total cards: \\( 54 \\)\n   - Each player gets \\( y \\) cards.\n   - \\( x \\times y = 54 \\)\n\n2. **Apply the Constraints:**\n   - \\( x \\) must be at least \\( 2 \\) (\\( x \\geq 2 \\)).\n   - \\( y \\) must be at least \\( 5 \\) (\\( y \\geq 5 \\)).\n\n3. **Express \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{54}{x}\n   \\]\n   Given \\( y \\geq 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Inequality for \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by \\( x \\) ("
