Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number that are less than the number itself.\n\nI'll start by finding the prime factorization of 284. I know that 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. Since 142 is also even, it can be divided by 2 again to give 71. Finally, 71 is a prime number.\n\nThe prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71, which is \\(2^2 \\times 71^1\\).\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \\((1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^k)\\) for each prime power \\(p^k\\) in the factorization, I can calculate the sum of all divisors of 284.\n\nFor \\(2^2\\), the sum of divisors is \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\).\nFor \\(71^1\\), the sum of divisors is \\(1 + 71 = 72\\).\n\nMultiplying these together gives the total sum of divisors: \\(7 \\times 72 = 504\\).\n\nSince the sum of all divisors includes the number itself, I'll subtract 284 to find the sum of the proper divisors: \\(504 - 284 = 220\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. Again, I'll start with the prime factorization of 220.\n\n220 is also even, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 220 by 2 gives me 110, which is still even. Dividing by 2 again gives 55. Finally, 55 is divisible by 5 and then by 11.\n\nThe prime factorization of 220 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1\\).\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again, I'll calculate for each prime power.\n\nFor \\(2^2\\), the sum of divisors is \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\).\nFor \\(5^1\\), the sum of divisors is \\(1 + 5 = 6\\).\nFor \\(11^1\\), the sum of divisors is \\(1 + 11"
