            "output": "Alright, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a table with the percentage of bus riders for males and females in each grade from 9th to 12th. The question is asking for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders.\" So, for each grade, we can calculate how many males there are compared to females and see if it's close to 1.35 times the number of females. Essentially, we\u2019re looking for the grade where males are about 35% more than females.\n\nThe table gives us the percentages, but since the survey includes 300 males and 300 females in each grade, I think we need to calculate the actual numbers of male and female bus riders for each grade. Once we have those numbers, we can compute the ratio and see which grade is closest to 1.35.\n\nLet me write down the given data first:\n\n- 9th grade: Males = 41.1%, Females = 39.4%\n- 10th grade: Males = 34.4%, Females = 33.1%\n- 11th grade: Males = 20.6%, Females = 13.8%\n- 12th grade: Males = 11.6%, Females = 8.6%\n\nSince each grade has 300 students, I can calculate the number of males and females who are bus riders for each grade.\n\nFor 9th grade:\n- Male bus riders = 41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300 = let me calculate that. 0.411 * 300 is 123.3\n- Female bus riders = 39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300 = 118.2\n\nSo, the number of male bus riders is 123.3 and female is 118.2. Now, we need to see if 123.3 is closest to 135% of 118.2.\n\nCalculating 135% of 118.2: 0.135 * 118.2 = let me compute that. 118.2 * 0.135. Hmm"

Let me do it step by step.\n\n118.2 * 0.1 = 11.82\n118.2 * 0.035 = 4.127\nSo, adding them together: 11.82 + 4.127 = 15.947\n\nSo, 135% of 118.2 is approximately 15.947. But the number of male bus riders is 123.3, which is much higher than 15.947. Wait, that can't be right. I think I made a mistake here. Wait, hold on. The 135% is of the female riders, which is 118.2, so 135% * female is 15.947, but the males are 123.3, which is way higher. So, this would mean that for 9th grade, males are way more than 135% of females. Is that correct? Hmm, wait, but 123.3 compared to 118.2, the male is roughly how much more? Let me compute the ratio: 123.3 / 118.2 \u2248 1.043. So, approximately 4.3% more males than females. That's nowhere near 135%.\n\nWait, I must have misunderstood. Let me re-read the question. It says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders.\" So, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate, for each grade, the ratio of males to females, and see which ratio is closest to 1.35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way around: 135% of female is male. So, male = 1.35 * female. So, for each grade, check if male % is approximately 1.35 times the female %. Hmm, but since the percentages are each relative to 100%, maybe I need to compute the ratio of male % to female % and see if it's close to 1.35.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For each grade, number of male bus riders is (male %) * "

So, the question is asking for which grade the ratio (male % / female %) is closest to 1.35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"number of male riders is closest to 135% of the number of female riders\", so (male riders) \u2248 1.35*(female riders). So, the ratio (male riders)/(female riders) \u2248 1.35. So, the ratio of male to female riders should be as close as possible to 1.35.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for each grade the ratio (male % / female %) and see which is closest to 1.35. Alternatively, since the number of students is the same (300 each), the ratio of the percentages would be the same as the ratio of the actual numbers. Because (0.411*300)/(0.394*300) = 0.411/0.394. So, the ratio is just the ratio of the percentages. So, that's easier.\n\nTherefore, for each grade, compute (Male % / Female %) and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nLet me compute that for each grade:\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n\nMale % = 41.1, Female % = 39.4\n\nRatio = 41.1 / 39.4 \u2248 Let's calculate that. 41.1 divided by 39.4. Let me do this division.\n\n39.4 goes into 41.1 once, with a remainder of 1.7. So, 1.0, and then 1.7 / 39.4 \u2248 0.043. So total \u2248 1.043. So, approximately 1.043, which is about 104.3%, so that's not close to 135%.\n\n10th grade:\n\nMale % = 34.4, Female % = "

So, 1.0 + 1.3 / 33.1 \u2248 0.0393, so total \u2248 1.0393, which is about 103.93%, still far from 135%.\n\n11th grade:\n\nMale % = 20.6, Female % = 13.8\n\nRatio = 20.6 / 13.8 \u2248 Let me compute. 13.8 * 1 = 13.8, 13.8 * 1.5 = 20.7. So, 20.6 / 13.8 \u2248 1.497. Hmm, about 1.5, which is higher than 1.35. Let me compute more accurately.\n\n13.8 * 1.4 = 19.32\n\n20.6 - 19.32 = 1.28\n\n1.28 / 13.8 \u2248 0.093\n\nSo, total ratio is 1.4 + 0.093 \u2248 1.493. So, approximately 1.493, which is about 149.3%, still higher than 135%.\n\n12th grade:\n\nMale % = 11.6, Female % = 8.6\n\nRatio = 11.6 / 8.6 \u2248 Let me calculate. 8.6 * 1.3 = 11.18, which is close to 11.6. 11.6 - 11.18 = 0.42. So, 0.42 / 8.6 \u2248 0.049. So, total ratio is 1.3 + 0.049 \u2248 1.349. So, about 1.349, which is approximately 134.9%, very close to 135%.\n\nSo, comparing all the ratios:\n\n- 9th: ~1.043 (104.3%)\n- 10th: ~1.039 (103.9%)\n- 11th: ~1.493 (149.3%)\n- 12th: ~1.349 (134.9%)\n\nSo, the 12th grade has a ratio closest to 135%. Therefore, the answer should be 12th grade.\n\nAlternatively, to"

That's a difference of 0.03, which is extremely close. So, in 12th grade, male riders are practically equal to 135% of female riders.\n\nComparing all the actual differences:\n\n- 9th: |123.3 - 158.47| = 35.17\n- 10th: |103.2 - 134.005| = 30.8\n- 11th: |61.8 - 55.89| = 5.91\n- 12th: |34.8 - 34.83| = 0.03\n\nSo, the 12th grade has the smallest difference, only 0.03, which is practically 135%.
