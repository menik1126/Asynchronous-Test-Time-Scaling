            "output": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about a monic cubic polynomial P(x). Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So P(x) is of the form x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, right?\n\nThe problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when it's divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5, and we need to find P(5).\n\nHmm, okay, so I think I can use the Remainder Theorem here. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of a polynomial P(x) divided by (x - k) is P(k). So, if we divide by a quadratic, the remainder will be a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) should be some linear polynomial, like mx + n.\n\nLet me denote R(x) = rx + s.\n\nSo when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So, by the Remainder Theorem, for x = 1 and x = 4, P(1) = R(1) and P(4) = R(4). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nAlso, since P(x) is a monic cubic, P(x) can be written as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nand\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nWhere Q1(x) and Q2(x) are quadratic polynomials, since we're dividing a cubic by a quadratic, so Q1 and Q2 should be linear? Wait, no, because (x - 1)(x - 4) is quadratic, and P(x) is cubic, so Q1(x) must be linear. Similarly, Q2(x) must be linear.\n\nWait, no. If you're dividing a degree 3 polynomial by a degree 2 polynomial, the"

Instead, I can set up equations based on the remainders.\n\nSince P(1) = R(1) and P(4) = R(4). Similarly, P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nSo let's note down the equations:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n3. P(2) = 2R(2)\n4. P(3) = 2R(3)\n\nAlso, we know that P(0) = 5, which is c, since P(0) is the constant term.\n\nSo, let's write R(x) = rx + s.\n\nThen:\n\n1. P(1) = r(1) + s = r + s\n2. P(4) = r(4) + s = 4r + s\n3. P(2) = 2r(2) + 2s = 4r + 2s, but wait, no. R(x) is rx + s, so 2R(2) would be 2*(r*2 + s) = 4r + 2s. So P(2) = 4r + 2s\n4. Similarly, P(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(r*3 + s) = 6r + 2s\n\nSo now, let's write P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\nWe know that:\n\n- P(1) = 1 + a + b + c = r + s\n- P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + c = 4r + s\n- P(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + c = 4r + 2s\n- P(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + c = 6r + 2s\n- P(0) = c = 5\n\nSo from P(0) = 5, c = 5.
