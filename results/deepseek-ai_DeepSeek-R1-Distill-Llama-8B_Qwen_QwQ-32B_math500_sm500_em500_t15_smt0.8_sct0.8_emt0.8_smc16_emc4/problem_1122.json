To find the speed in meters per second, I'll convert the distance from kilometers to meters and the time from hours to seconds.\n\nNext, I'll use the speed calculated from the first scenario to find the length of the hallway in the second scenario. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway length, so I'll set up an equation where speed multiplied by time equals distance.\n\nFinally, I'll solve the equation to find the distance in meters and present the final answer.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**\nA robot moving forward at a constant speed takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer. Moving forward at this same constant speed, it takes the robot 90 seconds to travel the length of a particular hallway. How many meters long is the hallway?\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine the Robot's Speed:**\n   \n   - **Distance (D\u2081):** 1 kilometer (1,000 meters)\n   - **Time (T\u2081):** 2.5 hours\n\n   Speed (\\( S \\)) is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{D_1}{T_1}\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{1,000 \\text{ meters}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}} = 400 \\text{ meters per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert Hours to Seconds:**\n   \n   Since the time taken for the hallway is given in seconds, we need to convert the speed from hours to seconds.\n   \n   - 1 hour = 360 seconds\n   \n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   S = 400 \\text{ meters per hour} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{360 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{400}{360} \\text{ meters per second} \\approx 1.111 \\text{ m/s}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of the Hallway (\\( D_2 \\)):**\n   \n   - **Time (\\( T_2 \\)):** 90 seconds\n   - **Speed (\\( S \\)):** 1.111 meters per second\n\n   Using the formula \\( D = S \\times T \\):\n   \\[\n   D_2"
