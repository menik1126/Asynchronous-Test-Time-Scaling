Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and each of the two positions must be different, I can use permutations for this part.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of possibilities for the digit portion. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9), and similar to the letters, the two digits must be different. Again, I'll use permutations to find the number of valid combinations for the digits.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I'll multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of digit combinations. This will give me the total number of unique license plates that can be formed under the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of unique license plates that can be formed, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of possible combinations for the letters.**\n\n- **Total letters (A-Z):** 26\n- **Positions for letters:** 2 (first and second)\n\nSince each license plate must have **2 different letters**, we can use the permutation formula for selecting 2 distinct items from 26.\n\n\\[\nP(26, 2) = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of possible combinations for the digits.**\n\n- **Total digits (0-9):** 10\n- **Positions for digits:** 2 (third and fourth)\n\nSimilarly, each license plate must have **2 different digits**. We use permutations here as well.\n\n\\[\nP(10, 2) = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique license plates.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total license plates} = P(26, 2) \\times P(10, 2) = 650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{58,\\!500}\n\\]"
