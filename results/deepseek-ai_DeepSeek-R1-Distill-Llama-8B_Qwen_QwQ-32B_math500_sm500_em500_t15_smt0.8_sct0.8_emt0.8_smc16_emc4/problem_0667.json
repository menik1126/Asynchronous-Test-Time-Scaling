So, I can write this relationship as:\n\n10T = 3S + G\n\nThe second sentence states that two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This gives me the equation:\n\n2T + G = S\n\nNow, I'll use substitution to solve for the variables. From the second equation, I can express G in terms of T and S:\n\nG = S - 2T\n\nNext, I'll substitute G in the first equation with the expression I just found:\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\nAdding 2T to both sides:\n\n12T = 4S\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\n3T = S\n\nSo, the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of three treeks.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks (T) weigh as much as three squigs (S) and one goolee (G):\n   \n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. Two treeks and one goolee equal the weight of one squig:\n   \n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1: Express G from Equation 2**\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute G into Equation 1**\n\nSubstitute \\( G = S - 2T \\) into Equation 1:\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for T in Terms of S**\n\nAdd \\( 2T \\) to both sides:\n\\[\n12T"
