            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can be useful when looking for rational roots, which includes integers. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(p/q\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nLooking at my equation, the leading coefficient is 1 for the \\(x^4\\) term, so the denominator of any rational root is going to be 1. That simplifies things! So any rational root must be an integer that divides the constant term, which in this case is -14. \n\nAlright, so the possible integer roots are the factors of 14. Let me list those out. The factors of 14 are: ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. So that gives me a set of possible candidates to test: -14, -7, -2, -1, 1, 2, 7, 14.\n\nNow I need to test each of these values in the original equation to see if they satisfy it, meaning when substituted for \\(x\\), the equation equals zero.\n\nLet's start with the smallest absolute value and work our way up. I'll begin with \\(x = 1\\).\n\nPlugging \\(x = 1\\) into the equation:\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\)\nCalculates to:\n\\(1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 is 6, 6 + 9 is 15, 15 -1 is 14, 14 -14 is 0\\).\nOh, that works! So \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n\nThat’s one down. Next, let me try \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14\\)\nCalculates to:\n\\(1 - 5 + 9 + 1 -14\\)\nLet me add them up step"

Not zero. So \\(x=2\\) isn't a root.\n\nNext, \\(x=-2\\):\n\\((-2)^4 +5(-2)^3 +9(-2)^2 - (-2) -14\\)\nCalculates to:\n16 + 5*(-8) +9*4 +2 -14\nWhich is 16 -40 +36 +2 -14\nAdding them: 16 -40 = -24, -24 +36=12, 12+2=14, 14-14=0. Oh, nice! So \\(x=-2\\) is another root.\n\nGood, now I have two roots: 1 and -2. \n\nLet me try \\(x=7\\):\n\\(7^4 +5(7)^3 +9(7)^2 -7 -14\\)\nCalculates to:\n2401 + 5*343 + 9*49 -7 -14\nWait, let me compute each term:\n7^4 = 49^2 = 2401\n5*(7^3) = 5*343 = 1715\n9*(7^2) = 9*49 = 441\nSo, 2401 + 1715 = 4116; 4116 + 441 = 4557; 4557 -7 = 4550; 4550 -14=4536.

Which is not zero. So \\(x=-14\\) isn't a root.\n\nAlright, so after checking all possible integer candidates, the only ones that worked were \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\). So those must be the only integer roots.\n\nBut hold on a second, since we're dealing with a fourth-degree polynomial, it should have four roots in total, considering multiplicities and complex roots. But the question is about integer roots, so even if there are more roots, they might not be integers.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss anything, I can try performing polynomial division to factor out the known roots and see what remains.\n\nSo, we have two roots: \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\). So that means (x - 1) and (x + 2) are factors. \n\nIf I can factor these out from the quartic, I can break down the equation into smaller polynomials. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's perform polynomial long division or synthetic division to factor out (x - 1).\n\nUsing synthetic division for x=1:\n\nCoefficients of the quartic: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nSet up synthetic division with root 1:\n\n1 | 1   5   9   -1   -14\n   |     1   6   15   14\n   -------------------------\n     1   6   15   14   0\n\nSo the result after division is: \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x +14\\).\n\nNow, let's factor that cubic.

So x = -2 is also a root of the cubic.\n\nTherefore, (x + 2) is a factor again. Let's perform synthetic division on the cubic with root -2.\n\nWait, but synthetic division with x = -2, so we use -2 as the root. The coefficients of the cubic are 1, 6, 15, 14.\n\nSet up synthetic division:\n\n-2 | 1   6   15   14\n    |   -2   -8   -14\n    ---------------------\n      1   4   7   0\n\nSo the result is \\(x^2 +4x +7\\).\n\nTherefore, the original quartic factors as (x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, the quadratic \\(x^2 +4x +7\\) can be checked for roots using the discriminant: \\(b^2 -4ac = 16 -28 = -12\\), which is negative, so no real roots, let alone integer ones.\n\nTherefore, the only integer roots are 1 and -2. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more.
