            "output": "First, I need to calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h. The radius of the beaker is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm. Plugging these values in, the volume of one beaker is V = π * 3² * 8 = 72π cm³.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. The radius of the tank is 6 cm, so the volume is V = (4/3)π * 6³ = 288π cm³.\n\nTo find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker. So, 288π / 72π = 4. Therefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n   Given:\n   - Radius of the beaker (\\( r \\)) = 3 cm\n   - Height of the beaker (\\( h \\)) = 8 cm\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\ \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Given:\n   - Radius of the tank (\\( R \\)) = 6 cm\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\ \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine"
