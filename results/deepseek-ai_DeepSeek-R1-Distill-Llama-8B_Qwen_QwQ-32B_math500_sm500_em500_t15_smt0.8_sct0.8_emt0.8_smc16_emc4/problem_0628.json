            "output": "Alright, so I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2}. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the domain of a function is all the real numbers for which the function is defined. Since this function has a square root, the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to zero. If the inside is negative, the square root wouldn't be a real number, right? So, I need to set up an inequality where (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \u2265 0.\n\nAlright, let me write that down: (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \u2265 0. Now, I think I can simplify this expression before solving the inequality. Maybe by expanding both squares and then subtracting them. Let me try expanding each term.\n\nExpanding (x-3)^2: that's x^2 - 6x + 9. Then expanding (x-8)^2: that's x^2 - 16x + 64. So, substituting back into the inequality, I get:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) \u2265 0. Hmm, okay, let me distribute that negative sign to all terms inside the second parenthesis. That would make it:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 \u2265 0. Now, let's combine like terms.\n\nLooking at the x^2 terms: x^2 - x^2 cancels out, so those are gone. Now the x terms: -6x + 16x is 10x. The constants: 9 - 64 is -55. So, the inequality simplifies to 10x - 55 \u2265 0.\n\nOkay, that's much simpler. Now, solving for x. Let me add 55 to both sides: 10x \u2265 55. Then divide both sides by 10: x \u2265 55/10, which is 5.5. So, x is greater than or equal to 5.5.\n\nWait, so the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x where x is at least 5.5. But the question is"

            "output": " asking for the smallest real number in the domain. Well, since x must be greater than or equal to 5.5, the smallest x is 5.5 itself. So, the answer should be 5.5, which can also be written as 11/2 or 11 over 2.\n\nLet me double-check if I made any mistakes in expanding the squares or subtracting. Let me recalculate (x-3)^2 and (x-8)^2 again. (x-3)^2 is indeed x\u00b2 -6x +9, and (x-8)^2 is x\u00b2 -16x +64. Subtracting the second from the first gives x\u00b2 -6x +9 -x\u00b2 +16x -64, which is (x\u00b2 -x\u00b2) + (-6x +16x) + (9 -64) = 0 +10x -55. Yep, that looks right.\n\nAnd solving 10x -55 \u22650: adding 55 gives 10x \u226555, then x \u22655.5. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the smallest real number x in the domain of g is 5.5.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is found by determining where the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Simplifying \\( (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \\geq 0 \\) leads to \\( 10x - 55 \\geq 0 \\), resulting in \\( x \\geq 5.5 \\). Therefore, the smallest \\( x \\) is 5.5.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}\n\\]"
