            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to rotate the complex number z around another complex number c by \u03c0/4 radians counter-clockwise. Let me break this down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of complex numbers and transformations.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given:\n\nz = 2 + \u221a2 - (3 + 3\u221a2)i  \nc = 2 - 3i\n\nI need to find w, which is z rotated around c by \u03c0/4. Hmm, rotating a point around another point isn't as straightforward as just multiplying by e^(i\u03b8) because that usually rotates around the origin. So, I think I need to translate the system so that c becomes the origin, rotate, and then translate back. That sounds right.\n\nLet me recall the steps for rotation in the complex plane. If I have a point z and I want to rotate it around another point c by an angle \u03b8, I can do the following:\n\n1. Translate z by subtracting c: z - c. This moves the center of rotation to the origin.\n2. Multiply by e^(i\u03b8) to rotate the translated point. Since the rotation is counter-clockwise, the angle is positive.\n3. Translate back by adding c: (z - c) * e^(i\u03b8) + c.\n\nOkay, let me apply that here. First, I need to compute z - c. Let me write z and c as complex numbers.\n\nz = (2 + \u221a2) + (-3 - 3\u221a2)i  \nc = 2 + (-3)i\n\nSo subtracting c from z (z - c):\n\nz - c = [ (2 + \u221a2) - 2 ] + [ (-3 - 3\u221a2)i - (-3)i ]  \n= (\u221a2) + (-3\u221a2 i)\n\nSo, z - c = \u221a2 - 3\u221a2 i\n\nHmm, that's nice. So now, I have a new complex number: \u221a2 - 3\u221a2 i. Let me write that as \u221a2(1 - 3i). That might make calculations easier later.\n\nNext step: multiply by e^(i\u03c0/4). I remember that e^(i\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8. So for \u03b8 = \u03c0/4, that's cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4). The values of these are"

Let me compute that.\n\nLet me denote A = \u221a2(1 - 3i), and B = \u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2. So I need A * B.\n\nMultiplying these:\n\nA * B = \u221a2(1 - 3i) * (\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2)\n\nLet me compute the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, distribute \u221a2:\n\n= \u221a2 * (\u221a2/2)(1 - 3i) + \u221a2 * (i\u221a2/2)(1 - 3i)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: \u221a2 * \u221a2/2 = (2)/2 = 1. So 1*(1 - 3i) = 1 - 3i.\n\nSecond term: \u221a2 * i\u221a2/2. Let's compute \u221a2 * \u221a2 first: that's 2. So 2*i/2 = i. So the second term is i*(1 - 3i).\n\nWait, actually, hold on: The second term is \u221a2 multiplied by i\u221a2/2, which is (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 * i = (2)/2 * i = 1 * i = i. Then, it's multiplied by (1 - 3i). So i*(1 - 3i) = i - 3i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 = -1, that becomes i + 3.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst term: 1 - 3i  \nSecond term: i + 3  \nSo adding them together:\n\n(1 + 3) + (-3i + i)  \n= 4 - 2i\n\nSo A * B = 4 - 2i. So, (z - c) * e^(i\u03c0/4) = 4 - 2i.\n\nNow, the next step is to add back c to this result to get w. So:\n\nw = (z - c) * e^(i\u03c0/4) + c  \n= (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i)  \n= (4 + 2) + (-"

So yes, w should be 6 - 5i.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my multiplication earlier. Let me go back to A * B:\n\nA was \u221a2(1 - 3i) = \u221a2 - 3\u221a2 i  \nB was \u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2  \nMultiplying them:  \n(\u221a2)(\u221a2/2) + \u221a2*(i\u221a2/2) + (-3\u221a2 i)(\u221a2/2) + (-3\u221a2 i)(i\u221a2/2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (\u221a2)(\u221a2)/2 = (2)/2 = 1  \nSecond term: (\u221a2)(i\u221a2)/2 = (2i)/2 = i  \nThird term: (-3\u221a2 i)(\u221a2)/2 = (-3*2 i)/2 = -3i  \nFourth term: (-3\u221a2 i)(i\u221a2)/2 = (-3*2 i\u00b2)/2 = (-6)(-1)/2 = 3\n\nSo altogether:\n\n1 + i - 3i + 3  \n= (1 + 3) + (i - 3i)  \n= 4 - 2i\n\nYes, that matches what I had before. So (z - c)*e^(i\u03c0/4) = 4 - 2i.\n\nAdding c (2 - 3i), we have:\n\n4 + 2 = 6  \n-2i -3i = -5i\n\nSo w = 6 - 5i.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me think if there's another way to check this. Maybe by converting to vectors and using rotation matrices?\n\nLet's consider z and c as points in the plane. So, if I represent z as a point (x, y) and c as (a, b), then the rotation can be done using the rotation matrix.\n\nGiven a point (x, y) rotated around (a, b) by \u03b8, the new point (x', y') is given"
