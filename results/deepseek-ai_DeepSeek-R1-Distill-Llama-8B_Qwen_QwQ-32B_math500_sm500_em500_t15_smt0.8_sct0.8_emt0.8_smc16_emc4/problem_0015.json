            "output": "Alright, I've got this problem about polynomials, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to write down everything I know and then see how to piece it together.\n\nSo, the problem says: Let \\( P(x) \\) be a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so \\( P(x) \\) looks like \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants I need to find. Or wait, maybe it's \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that \\( P(x) \\) has a remainder \\( R(x) \\) when it's divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\). Hmm, okay. So if I divide \\( P(x) \\) by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which is a quadratic, the remainder \\( R(x) \\) should be a linear polynomial, right? Because when you divide a cubic by a quadratic, the remainder is of lower degree.\n\nSimilarly, the problem says that \\( P(x) \\) has a remainder \\( 2R(x) \\) when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\). So same thing; dividing by a quadratic gives a linear remainder. So, \\( 2R(x) \\) must also be a linear polynomial. \n\nSo, let me denote \\( R(x) = mx + n \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants that I need to find. Then, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). So, that means \\( P(1) = R(1) = m(1) + n = m + n \\) and \\( P(4) = R(4) = m(4) + n = 4m + n \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n \\). So, that gives \\( P"

Since \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, which is \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\), so plugging in x=0 gives \\( P(0) = c = 5 \\). So, c is 5.\n\nSo now I have that \\( c = 5 \\). \n\nLet me note down all the equations I have.\n\nFrom the division by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\):\n\n1. \\( P(1) = m + n \\)\n2. \\( P(4) = 4m + n \\)\n\nFrom the division by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\):\n\n3. \\( P(2) = 4m + 2n \\)\n4. \\( P(3) = 6m + 2n \\)\n\nAlso, \\( P(0) = 5 \\), so \\( c = 5 \\).\n\nNow, since \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, I can write it as \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 5 \\).\n\nI also know four points: \\( P(1) \\), \\( P(4) \\), \\( P(2) \\), \\( P(3) \\). So, I can set up equations based on these.\n\nLet me write the expressions for each of these:\n\n1. \\( P(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = 6 + a + b \\). But from the division, this is equal to \\( R(1) = m + n \\). So, equation (1) is \\( 6 + a + b = m + n \\).\n\n2. \\( P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 69 + 16a + 4b \\). From division, this is equal to \\( R(4) = 4m + n \\). So, equation (2) is \\( 69 + 16a +"
