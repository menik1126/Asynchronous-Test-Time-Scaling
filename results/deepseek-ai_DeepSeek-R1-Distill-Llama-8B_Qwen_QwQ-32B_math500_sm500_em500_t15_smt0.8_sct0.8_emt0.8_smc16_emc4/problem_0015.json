            "output": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. It's about polynomials and remainders when they're divided by certain factors. Hmm, okay, so I have a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So it looks like x\u00b3 + something x\u00b2 + something x + constant term.\n\nThe problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5. The goal is to find P(5).\n\nFirst, let me recall the Remainder Theorem. It states that if a polynomial P(x) is divided by a linear factor (x - a), the remainder is P(a). But here, the divisors are quadratic, so the remainder should be of a lower degree, which is 1 or 2. But since R(x) is given as a remainder, I think it's a linear polynomial? Or maybe quadratic? Wait, when dividing by a quadratic, the remainder is of degree less than 2, so it's linear, like ax + b.\n\nSo, P(x) can be expressed in terms of these divisors and remainders. Let me write that down.\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\nand\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x),\n\nwhere Q1(x) and Q2(x) are the quotient polynomials when P(x) is divided by those quadratics.\n\nSince both expressions equal P(x), they must equal each other:\n(x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x).\n\nHmm, maybe I can rearrange this to find a relationship between Q1(x) and Q2(x) or R(x). Let me subtract R(x) from both sides:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + R(x).\n\nWait, that's not"

            "output": " immediately helpful. Maybe another approach. Since R(x) is the remainder when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), then R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, since 2R(x) is the remainder when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), then 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3). \n\nAh, that's a good point! Because when you divide by (x - a)(x - b), the remainder R(x) must satisfy R(a) = P(a) and R(b) = P(b). So, applying that here:\n\nFor the first division:\nR(1) = P(1)\nR(4) = P(4)\n\nFor the second division:\n2R(2) = P(2)\n2R(3) = P(3)\n\nSo, we have these equations. Since R(x) is a linear polynomial (since it's the remainder when divided by a quadratic), let me denote R(x) = ax + b, where a and b are constants to be determined.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nR(1) = a(1) + b = a + b = P(1)\nR(4) = 4a + b = P(4)\n2R(2) = 2(2a + b) = 4a + 2b = P(2)\n2R(3) = 2(3a + b) = 6a + 2b = P(3)\n\nSo, we have expressions for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) in terms of a and b. But how does this help us?\n\nAlso, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, let me write it as:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + cx\u00b2 + dx + e\n\nBecause it's monic, so leading coefficient is 1. We know P(0) = e = 5. So, e = 5. That's one value down.\n\nSo, P(x) = x\u00b3 + cx\u00b2 + dx + 5.\n\nNow, we can write equations for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) using this expression.\n\nLet me compute each:\n\nP(1) = 1"
