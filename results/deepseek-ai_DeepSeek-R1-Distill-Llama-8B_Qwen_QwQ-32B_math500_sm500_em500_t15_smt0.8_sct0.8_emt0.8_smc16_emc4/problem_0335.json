This can be done using the combination formula: C(7,3). Similarly, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4 using the combination formula: C(4,2).\n\nAfter obtaining the number of ways to choose the boys and girls separately, I'll multiply these two numbers together to find the total number of ways to select 3 boys and 2 girls.\n\nFinally, I'll sum up the steps to provide a clear and concise answer to the problem.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Boys and Girls:**\n   - **Number of Boys (B):** 7\n   - **Number of Girls (G):** 4\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Choose 3 Boys from 7:**\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Choose 2 Girls from 4:**\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Total Number of Ways to Choose 3 Boys and 2 Girls:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Ways} = C(7, 3) \\times C(4, 2) = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
