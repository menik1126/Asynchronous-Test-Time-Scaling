Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know:\n\n- z = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i\n- c = 2 - 3i\n\nI need to rotate z around c by 45 degrees (which is π/4 radians) counter-clockwise. Hmm, I remember that in complex numbers, rotating around a point isn't just multiplying by e^(iθ); instead, I have to translate the complex number so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, then apply the rotation, and then translate back. So, the process should be something like:\n\n1. Translate z by -c: z' = z - c\n2. Rotate z' by π/4: w' = z' * e^(iπ/4)\n3. Translate w' back by +c: w = w' + c\n\nLet me make sure I got that right. Rotating around a point c means moving the point relative to c. So yes, subtract c, rotate, then add c back. That makes sense.\n\nOkay, so let's compute each step.\n\nFirst, let's compute z - c.\n\nz = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i\nc = 2 - 3i\n\nSo, z - c = (2 + √2 - 2) + (-3 - 3√2 - (-3))i\nWait, hold on. Let's do this carefully.\n\nz = a + bi, where a = 2 + √2 and b = -(3 + 3√2)\nc = 2 - 3i, so c = 2 + (-3)i\n\nSo, z - c = (a - c_real) + (b - c_imag)i\n= (2 + √2 - 2) + (-(3 + 3√2) - (-3))i\nSimplify real part: 2 - 2 = 0, so just √2\nImaginary part: -(3 + 3√2) + 3 = -3 - 3√2 + 3 = -3√2\n\nSo, z - c = √2 - 3√"
