Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know:\n\n- z = 2 + \u221a2 - (3 + 3\u221a2)i\n- c = 2 - 3i\n\nI need to rotate z around c by 45 degrees (which is \u03c0/4 radians) counter-clockwise. Hmm, I remember that in complex numbers, rotating around a point isn't just multiplying by e^(i\u03b8); instead, I have to translate the complex number so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, then apply the rotation, and then translate back. So, the process should be something like:\n\n1. Translate z by -c: z' = z - c\n2. Rotate z' by \u03c0/4: w' = z' * e^(i\u03c0/4)\n3. Translate w' back by +c: w = w' + c\n\nLet me make sure I got that right. Rotating around a point c means moving the point relative to c. So yes, subtract c, rotate, then add c back. That makes sense.\n\nOkay, so let's compute each step.\n\nFirst, let's compute z - c.\n\nz = 2 + \u221a2 - (3 + 3\u221a2)i\nc = 2 - 3i\n\nSo, z - c = (2 + \u221a2 - 2) + (-3 - 3\u221a2 - (-3))i\nWait, hold on. Let's do this carefully.\n\nz = a + bi, where a = 2 + \u221a2 and b = -(3 + 3\u221a2)\nc = 2 - 3i, so c = 2 + (-3)i\n\nSo, z - c = (a - c_real) + (b - c_imag)i\n= (2 + \u221a2 - 2) + (-(3 + 3\u221a2) - (-3))i\nSimplify real part: 2 - 2 = 0, so just \u221a2\nImaginary part: -(3 + 3\u221a2) + 3 = -3 - 3\u221a2 + 3 = -3\u221a2\n\nSo, z - c = \u221a2 - 3\u221a"

So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, I think w = 6 -5i.\n\nI think that's it. I'm going to check if I made any computational errors.\n\nWait, in the trigonometric approach, when I computed x = 2\u221a5 * cos(\u03b8 + \u03c0/4), which was 2\u221a5 * (2\u221a5/5 ) = 4, correct.\n\nSimilarly, y = 2\u221a5 * (-\u221a5/5 ) = -2, correct.\n\nHence, w = c + (4, -2) = (2 -3i) + (4 -2i) = (6) + (-5i). So, 6 -5i.\n\nAnother way to verify: perhaps using the formula.\n\nIf I write the rotation formula as:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^{i\u03c0/4"

So, in complex numbers, the point Z is (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3*sqrt(2)), which corresponds to the complex number (2 + sqrt(2)) + (-3 - 3*sqrt(2))i, which matches the given z = 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i.
