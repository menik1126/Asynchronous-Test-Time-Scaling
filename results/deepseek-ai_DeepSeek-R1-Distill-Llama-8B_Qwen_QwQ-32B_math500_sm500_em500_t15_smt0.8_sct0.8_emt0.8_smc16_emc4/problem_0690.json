            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: The area of triangle ABC is given by a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2, and I need to find tan A. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be expressed in multiple ways. The most common ones are (1/2)*base*height and using Heron's formula, but since the problem gives an expression involving the sides a, b, c, maybe another formula would be more useful here. Oh, right! The area can also be expressed using the formula (1/2)*ab*sin C, where a and b are sides, and C is the included angle. That might come in handy.\n\nBut wait, the given area is a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2. Let me expand that expression first to see what it simplifies to. So, expanding (b - c)\u00b2 gives b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2, right? Therefore, a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2) simplifies to a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2bc - c\u00b2. Hmm, can this be rewritten in a more meaningful form?\n\nLet me write that down: Area = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2bc. Hmm, I wonder if this relates to any known formula. Wait a second, if I think about the Law of Cosines, I know that a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A. Maybe I can substitute that into the area expression.\n\nLet me do that substitution. So, replacing a\u00b2 with b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A in the area expression:\n\nArea = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A) - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2bc.\n\nSimplify this: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2bc. The b\u00b2 and c\u00b2 terms cancel out, leaving -2bc*cos A + 2bc. Factor out the 2bc: 2bc(1 - cos A).\n\nSo, the area is equal to 2bc(1 - cos A). But the problem also says that the area is a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2, which we already expanded to 2bc(1 - cos A). Therefore, 2bc(1 - cos A)"

            "output": " = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2.\n\nWait, but if I use the other area formula, (1/2)*ab*sin C, in this case, angle A is opposite side a, so maybe I should use (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Because sides b and c form angle A, right?\n\nSo, Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. That's another expression for the area.\n\nNow, setting the two expressions for area equal:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 2bc(1 - cos A).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(1/2)bc sin A = 2bc(1 - cos A).\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by bc since bc isn't zero (they are sides of a triangle). So:\n\n(1/2) sin A = 2(1 - cos A).\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(1/2) sin A = 2 - 2 cos A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\nsin A = 4 - 4 cos A.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I have an equation involving sin A and cos A. I remember that such equations can be solved by using the identity sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 1.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nsin A + 4 cos A = 4.\n\nWait, actually, let me write it as:\n\nsin A = 4(1 - cos A).\n\nSo, sin A = 4 - 4 cos A.\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but wait, I don't have square roots here. Instead, maybe express everything in terms of cos A and then substitute using the Pythagorean identity.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nWe have:\n\nsin A = 4 - 4 cos A.\n\nLet me call this Equation (1).\n\nI also know that sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 1. Let me denote cos A = x for simplicity.\n\nThen, sin A = sqrt(1 - x\u00b2), but from Equation (1), sin A = 4 - 4x.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(1 - x\u00b2) = 4 - 4x.\n\nWait, but sqrt(1 - x\u00b2) must be non-negative, so 4 - 4x must be >= 0. Thus, 4 - 4x >= 0 => x <="
