Since the denominator must be converted to a power of 10 for the decimal to terminate, I can determine the number of decimal places by finding the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization. Here, the exponent of 2 is 2 and the exponent of 5 is 7, so the higher exponent is 7.\n\nNext, I will convert the denominator to \\(10^7\\) by multiplying it by the necessary factors to balance the equation. This requires multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^{7-2} = 2^5\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\times 2^5}{(2^2 \\cdot 5^7) \\times 2^5} = \\frac{21 \\times 32}{2^{2+5} \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{672}{2^7 \\cdot 5^7}\n\\]\n\nNow, the denominator is \\(10^7\\), which means the decimal representation will terminate after 7 places.\n\nFinally, I will perform the division of 672 by 10,000,000 to find the exact decimal value. This will give me the terminating decimal equivalent of the original fraction.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Prime Factors:**\n   - The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).\n   - For a fraction to have a terminating decimal, the denominator must be a power of 10 (i.e., \\(10^n = 2^n \\cdot 5^n\\)).\n\n2. **Balance the Prime Factors:**\n   - The given denominator has more 5s than 2s. To convert it into a power of 10:\n     \\[\n     2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = \\left(10^2\\right) \\cdot \\left(5^{5}\\right)\n     \\]\n     Multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^"
