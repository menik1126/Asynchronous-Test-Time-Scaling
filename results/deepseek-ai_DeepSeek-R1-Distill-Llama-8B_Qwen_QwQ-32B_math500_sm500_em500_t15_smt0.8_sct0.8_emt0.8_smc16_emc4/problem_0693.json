I need to compute \\( \\tan A \\). Hmm, let's start by recalling some formulas related to the area of a triangle.\n\nFirst off, I know that the area \\( \\Delta \\) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula \\( \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\). That's one of the standard formulas, where \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are two sides, and \\( A \\) is the included angle between them. So that's a useful starting point.\n\nThe problem gives me another expression for the area: \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). Let me write that down: \\( \\Delta = a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). Hmm, maybe I can expand that expression to see if it can be simplified or related to the standard area formula.\n\nExpanding \\( (b - c)^2 \\) gives \\( b^2 - 2bc + c^2 \\). So substituting that into the area expression, we get \\( \\Delta = a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) \\). Let me compute this step by step.\n\nSo, \\( a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \\). That simplifies to \\( (a^2 - b^2 - c^2) + 2bc \\).\n\nWait a second, another thought. I remember the Law of Cosines, which relates the sides of a triangle to one of its angles. It states that \\( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\). Maybe this could be helpful here because I see \\( a^2 \\) in both the given area and the standard area formula.\n\nLet me try substituting the Law of Cosines into the area expression. So, from the Law of Cosines, \\( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\). Plugging this into the area given in the problem, \\( \\Delta = a^2 -"

So the area is \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\), and substituting \\( a^2 \\) from the Law of Cosines:\n\n\\( \\Delta = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) \\).\n\nNow, let's expand and simplify this:\n\nFirst, distribute the negative sign into \\( (b - c)^2 \\):\n\n\\( \\Delta = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \\).\n\nLet's combine like terms step by step. \\( b^2 - b^2 = 0 \\), \\( c^2 - c^2 = 0 \\), and then we have the remaining terms:\n\n- \\( -2bc \\cos A + 2bc \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\Delta = (-2bc \\cos A + 2bc) \\). Factor out the \\( 2bc \\):\n\n\\( \\Delta = 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\).\n\nWait a minute, but from the standard area formula, \\( \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin A \\). So we have two expressions for \\( \\Delta \\):\n\n1. \\( \\Delta = 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\) (from the problem statement)\n2. \\( \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin A \\) (standard formula)\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( \\Delta \\), I can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2} bc \\sin A \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let's solve for \\( \\tan A \\). First, let's note that \\( bc \\) is common on both sides and assuming \\( bc \\neq 0 \\) (which makes sense in a triangle because side lengths are positive), we can divide both sides by \\( bc \\):\n\n\\( 2(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin A \\"

I remember that \\( 1 - \\cos x = 2 \\sin^2 (x/2) \\) and \\( \\sin x = 2 \\sin (x/2) \\cos (x/2) \\). Let's try substituting these in.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nLeft side: \\( 4 \\times 2 \\sin^2 (x/2) = 8 \\sin^2 (x/2) \\).\n\nRight side: \\( 2 \\sin (x/2) \\cos (x/2) \\).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n\\( 8 \\sin^2 (x/2) = 2 \\sin (x/2) \\cos (x/2) \\).\n\nAssuming \\( \\sin (x/2) \\neq 0 \\) (which is true because if \\( x \\) were 0, the triangle would be degenerate, which isn't the case here), we can divide both sides by \\( \\sin (x/2) \\):\n\n\\( 8 \\sin (x/2) = 2 \\cos (x/2) \\).\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 4 \\sin (x/2) = \\cos (x/2) \\).\n\nNow,"

But I should check if this makes sense in the context of a triangle. Since in a triangle, each angle is between 0 and 180 degrees, \\( A \\) must be acute if \\( \\tan A \\) is positive because \\( \\tan \\) is positive in the first and third quadrants. Since \\( 0 < A < \\pi \\), \\( A \\) must be between 0 and 90 degrees (acute) or between 90 and 180 degrees (obtuse). But \\( \\tan A \\) positive would only be in the first and third quadrants, but in the third quadrant, angles are greater than 180, which isn't possible in a triangle. So \\( A \\) must be acute, meaning \\( \\tan A \\) is positive, so \\( 8/15 \\) is a valid value.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\( 4 - 4 \\cos A = \\sin A \\).\n\nThen I wrote \\( 4(1 - \\cos A) = \\sin A \\).\n\nThen used identities: \\( 1 - \\cos A = 2 \\sin^"
