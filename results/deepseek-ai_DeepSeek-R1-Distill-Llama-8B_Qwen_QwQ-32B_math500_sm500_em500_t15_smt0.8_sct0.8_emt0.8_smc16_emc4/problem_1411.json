The volume formula for a sphere is \\((4/3)\\pi r^3\\), and with a radius of 6 cm, the tank's volume is \\((4/3)\\pi (6)^3 = 144\\pi\\) cm\u00b3.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The volume formula for a cylinder is \\(\\pi r^2 h\\), and with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, one beaker has a volume of \\(\\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi\\) cm\u00b3.\n\nTo find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the tank's volume by the beaker's volume: \\(144\\pi / 72\\pi = 2\\). Therefore, it will take two cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine how many cylindrical beakers, each with a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm, are required to completely fill a spherical tank with a radius of 6 cm. \n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Given the radius \\( r = 6 \\) cm:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\text{ cm\u00b3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n   Given the radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm and height \\( h = 8 \\) cm:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi (9) (8) = 72\\pi \\text{ cm\u00b3}\n   \\]\n\n"
