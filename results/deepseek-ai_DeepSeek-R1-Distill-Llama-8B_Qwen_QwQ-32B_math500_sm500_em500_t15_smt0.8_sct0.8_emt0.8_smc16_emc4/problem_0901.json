This means the fraction is already in its simplest form and can be expressed as a decimal.\n\nTo convert it to a decimal, I can rewrite the denominator as a power of 10 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^{(7-2)}\\) and \\(5^{(7-2)}\\), which simplifies to \\(2^5 \\cdot 5^2\\). This transforms the denominator into \\(10^7\\).\n\nNext, I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^5 \\cdot 5^2\\) to get:\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\cdot 2^5 \\cdot 5^2}{10^7}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\\[\n21 \\cdot 32 \\cdot 25 = 21 \\cdot 800 = 16,\\!800\n\\]\n\nSo, the fraction becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{16,\\!800}{10^7} = 0.168\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the terminating decimal representation of \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) is 0.168.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Denominator\nThe denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\). Since it's expressed as a product of powers of 2 and 5, the fraction can be converted into a decimal with a finite number of digits.\n\n### Step 2: Adjust the Fraction\nTo convert it to a decimal, express the denominator as a power of 10. This requires multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the necessary factors to make the denominator a power of 10.\n\nSince there are fewer than 7 factors of 2 in the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by \\(2^5\\) to make the denominator a power of 10:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\times"
