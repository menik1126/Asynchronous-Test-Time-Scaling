            "output": "To determine the length of the hallway, I first need to identify the robot's speed. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. \n\nI'll convert the total time from hours to seconds to make the units consistent. Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour, the robot takes 2.5 hours multiplied by 3600 seconds per hour, which equals 9000 seconds per kilometer.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. The speed is 1 kilometer divided by 9000 seconds, resulting in a speed of 0.0001111 kilometers per second.\n\nNow, I'll use the speed to find the length of the hallway. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway. Multiplying the speed by the time gives the distance: 0.0001111 kilometers per second multiplied by 90 seconds equals 0.01 kilometers.\n\nFinally, I'll convert kilometers to meters since the question asks for the length in meters. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so 0.01 kilometers multiplied by 1000 equals 10 meters.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Robot's Speed**\n\nThe robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. To find its speed, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{1\\,\\text{km}}{2.5\\,\\text{hours}}\n\\]\n\nConvert the time to seconds for consistency:\n\n\\[\n2.5\\,\\text{hours} = 2.5 \\times 3600\\,\\text{seconds} = 9000\\,\\text{seconds}\n\\]\n\nSo, the speed is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{1\\,\\text{km}}{9000\\,\\text{seconds}} = 0.0001111\\,\\frac{\\text{km}}{\\text{second}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Length of the Hallway**\n\nThe robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway. Using the speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = 0.0001111"
