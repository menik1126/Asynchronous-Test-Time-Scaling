The operation is subtraction of the next consecutive number, starting with 1.\n\nNext, I note that the series can be regrouped to simplify the calculation. By pairing terms in a specific way, like (1-2) + (3-4) + ... + (99-100), it becomes easier to handle the addition and subtraction.\n\nThen, each pair within the grouping results in a value of -1. Since there are 50 such pairs, the total sum is -1 multiplied by 50, which equals -50.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the series is -50.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the series \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Series Structure**:\n   - The series alternates between positive and negative numbers.\n   - It starts with \\(1\\) and subtracts the next consecutive number, continues with adding the next number, and so on.\n\n2. **Regroup the Terms**:\n   - Pair the terms to simplify the calculation:\n     \\[\n     (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n     \\]\n   - Each pair results in \\(-1\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Pairs**:\n   - There are \\(100\\) terms in total.\n   - Since each pair consists of \\(2\\) terms, there are:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ pairs}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Overall Sum**:\n   - Each pair equals \\(-1\\).\n   - Therefore, the total sum is:\n     \\[\n     50 \\times (-1) = -50\n     \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
