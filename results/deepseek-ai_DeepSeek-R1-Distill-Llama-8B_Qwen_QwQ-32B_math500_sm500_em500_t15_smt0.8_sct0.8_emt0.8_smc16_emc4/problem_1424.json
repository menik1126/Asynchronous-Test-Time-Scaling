Let's assume \\( n \\) is a positive integer greater than 1. This means \\( n \\) can be represented as a product of prime factors or as a single prime raised to some power.\n\nTo find all such \\( n \\), I consider that \\( n \\) must divide the exponent 24 when \\( 2^{24} \\) is expressed as a perfect \\( n \\)-th power. Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nI then list all the positive divisors of 24:\n\\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be greater than 1, I exclude 1 from the list, leaving:\n\\[ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \\]\n\nEach of these remaining values of \\( n \\) satisfies the condition that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)-th power because each \\( n \\) is a divisor of 24, ensuring that raising 2 to the 24th power results in an \\( n \\)-th power.\n\nFinally, I count the number of valid \\( n \\) values:\nThere are 7 such positive integers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) satisfy \\( 2^{24} \\) being a perfect \\( n \\)-th power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need \\( 2^{24} \\) to be an \\( n \\)-th power, i.e., \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n   - This requires that \\( n \\) divides the exponent 24.\n\n2. **Express \\( n \\) in Terms of Exponents:**\n   - Since \\( n \\) must divide 24, \\("
