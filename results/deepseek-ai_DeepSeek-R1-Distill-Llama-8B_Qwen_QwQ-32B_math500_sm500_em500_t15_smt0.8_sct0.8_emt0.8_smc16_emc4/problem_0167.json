            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve for the positive value of x in the equation cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me write that down first to visualize it better. The equation is:\n\ncube_root(x² - 4x + 4) = 16.\n\nAlright, cube roots can be tricky, but I remember that to get rid of a cube root, you can cube both sides of the equation. That should help simplify things. So, if I cube both sides, the equation becomes:\n\n(x² - 4x + 4) = 16³.\n\nWait, what's 16 cubed? Let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16... Hmm, 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, 16³ is 4096. Therefore, the equation now is:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nHmm, okay. Next step, I should bring 4096 to the left side by subtracting it from both sides. So subtracting 4096 from both sides gives:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0.\n\nSimplifying the constants: 4 - 4096 is -4092. So the equation is:\n\nx² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. To solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a), where a=1, b=-4, and c=-4092.\n\nLet me plug those values in. So, b squared is (-4)² which is 16. Then, 4ac is 4*1*(-4092) which is -16368. So the discriminant inside the square root is:\n\n16 - (-16368) = 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nOh, wait, 16384 is a perfect cube because 25 cubed is 15625 and 26 cubed is 17576, so 25.5 cubed is around 164"

            "output": "0. But wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 25 cubed is 15,625, and 26 cubed is 17,576, so 16384 is between them. Hmm, actually, 16384 is equal to 2^14, which is 16384. So sqrt(16384) would be sqrt(2^14) which is 2^7, which is 128. So sqrt(16384) is 128.\n\nSo now, plugging back into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [4 ± 128] / 2.\n\nWait, because b was -4, so -b is 4. So x = (4 ± 128)/2. That gives two solutions:\n\nx = (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66,\n\nand\n\nx = (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62.\n\nBut the problem asks for the positive value of x, so x = 66 is the solution.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation:\n\ncube_root(x² - 4x + 4) = 16.\n\nCubed both sides: x² - 4x + 4 = 16³ = 4096.\n\nSubtracted 4096: x² -4x -4092 = 0.\n\nQuadratic formula: a=1, b=-4, c=-4092.\n\nDiscriminant: (-4)^2 -4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nSquare root of 16384 is 128. So solutions (4 ±128)/2. Positive solution is (132)/2 =66.\n\nWait, but let me verify by plugging x=66 back into the original equation to make sure.\n\nCompute x² -4x +4: (66)^2 is 4356. 4x is 264. So 4356 -264 +4.\n\n4356 - 264 is 4092, then +4 is 4096.\n\nCube root of 4096 is indeed 16, since 16^3 is 4096. So yes, it checks out.\n\nAnd the other solution x=-62: let's see, (-62)^2 is 3844. -4*(-62)=+248. So 384"

So that also works, but since the problem asked for positive x, 66 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is solved by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root, resulting in a quadratic equation. Solving the quadratic using the quadratic formula yields two solutions, with the positive one being 66.\n\n$\\boxed{66}$"
