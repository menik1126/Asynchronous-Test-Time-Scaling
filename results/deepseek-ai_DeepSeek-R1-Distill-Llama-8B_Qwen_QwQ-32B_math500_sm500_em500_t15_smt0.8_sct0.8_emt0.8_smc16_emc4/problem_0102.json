The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, I remember that when you have an equation like this, where a sum of two fractions equals another fraction, you can combine the left side into a single fraction and then compare the numerators. The denominator on the right side is already factored, which is good.\n\nLet me first factor the denominator on the right to see if it matches the denominators on the left. The denominator is \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). Let me try to factor that.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3 work because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, it factors to:\n\n\\[\n(x + 8)(x - 3)\n\\]\n\nGreat, so the denominator is \\((x + 8)(x - 3)\\). That means the right side, \\(\\frac{4x - 23}{(x + 8)(x - 3)}\\), has the same denominator as the left side when combined. So, I can write the left side as a single fraction and then set the numerators equal.\n\nTo combine the left side, I need a common denominator, which is \\((x - 3)(x + 8)\\). So, I'll rewrite each fraction with this common denominator.\n\nFirst fraction: \\(\\frac{C}{x - 3}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\).\n\nSecond fraction: \\(\\frac{D}{x + 8}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\).\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are equal, the numerators must be equal as"

So,\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, I can expand the left side:\n\n\\[\nC x + 8C + D x - 3D = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nThe x terms: \\(C x + D x = (C + D)x\\)\n\nThe constant terms: \\(8C - 3D\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, for this equation to hold for all real x except -8 and 3, the coefficients of x must be equal, and the constant terms must be equal. So, we can write a system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: \\(C + D = 4\\)\n2. Constant term: \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\(C + D = 4\\)\n2. \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nI need to solve this system for C and D. Let's use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nFrom the first equation, I can express C as \\(C = 4 - D\\). Then, substitute this into the second equation.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n\n\\(8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\\)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\(32 - 8D - 3D = -23\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(32 - 11D = -23\\)\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n\\(-11D = -23 - 32\\)\n\n\\(-11D = -55\\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by -11:\n\n\\(D = \\frac{-55}{-11} = 5\\)\n\nSo, D is 5. Then, from equation 1, \\(C + 5 = 4\\), so \\(C = 4 - 5 = -1\\).\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nNow, the question asks for the product CD. So, CD = (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, combining the fractions"
