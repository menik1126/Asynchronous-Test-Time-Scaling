Since the table is square, rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.\n\nI'll start by fixing one person's position to eliminate equivalent rotations. By pinning one person at a specific seat, I can arrange the remaining 7 individuals relative to this fixed point.\n\nNext, I'll consider the arrangement of the other people. Since each side of the table can hold 2 people, I need to divide the remaining 7 seats evenly among the sides. This means that 4 sides will have 2 people each, and there will be 1 seat remaining. To accommodate this, one side will have 3 people, and the rest will have 2 people each.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the number of ways to distribute the people among the sides. There are 7 seats left, and each side can hold a maximum of 2 people. The number of ways to distribute 7 seats with 4 sides each holding 2 people and 1 side holding 3 people is given by the combination formula C(7,3).\n\nAfter determining the distribution, I'll calculate the number of ways to arrange the people in their respective seats. For each side with 2 people, there are 2! ways to arrange them. The side with 3 people will have 3! arrangements. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 2! raised to the power of 4 multiplied by 3!.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the number of ways to distribute the seats by the number of arrangements to get the total number of distinct seating configurations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, where rotations are considered identical, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix One Person's Position:**\n   - To eliminate equivalent rotations, fix one person in a specific seat. This leaves 7 people to be arranged.\n\n2. **Determine Seat Distribution:**\n   - With 4 sides and 2 seats per side, we need to distribute the remaining 7 seats.\n   - One side will have an extra seat, so it will accommodate 3 people; the others will have 2 each.\n\n3. **Calculate Seat Assignments:**\n   - Choose which side will have 3 people: \\( \\binom{4}{1} = 4"

Let me re-express:\n\nThe correct method is fixing one person, then arranging the remaining 7 in 7! ways. Since rotations are considered the same, divide by 4 (the number of rotations). Thus, the answer is \\( \\frac{7!}{4} = \\frac{5040}{4} = 1260 \\).\n\nBut another approach: For circular tables, the formula is (n-1)! for a round table. But here it's a square table with sides. Since rotations are considered the same, fixing one person, the rest can be arranged in 7!.\n\nBut since the table has 4 sides, rotating by 90 degrees (1/4 of a full rotation) would make it the same. So the number of rotational symmetries is 4. Hence, divide by 4.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 7! /4 = 5040/4 = 1260.\n\nBut some sources might say that for a square table, the rotational symmetry is 4, so dividing by 4. Hence, the final answer is 1260.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, arranging n people around a circular table is (n-1)! because rotations are equivalent. For a square table, the rotational symmetry is 4, so the number is n! /4. Here n=8, so 8! /4 = 40320 /4 = 10080. But that contradicts.\n\nWait, but if we fix one person, then the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways, so 7! /1 = 5040. But since rotations are considered the same, but we already fixed one person, so rotations are accounted for. Wait, perhaps fixing one person already accounts for rotations, so the total is 7!.\n\nWait, confusion arises here. Let me think carefully.\n\nWhen arranging people around a circular table, fixing one person's position accounts for rotational symmetry, so the remaining (n-1)!.\n\nSimilarly, for a square table, which has rotational symmetry of order 4 (rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°), fixing one person's position ("
