Hmm, let me first visualize this. The circle is centered at the origin with radius \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), and the parabola opens to the right. The common tangents will touch both the circle and the parabola, and these points of tangency will form a quadrilateral. I need to find the coordinates of these four points and then compute the area.\n\nFirst, I remember that the equation of a tangent to a circle can be written in the form \\( y = mx + c \\), where \\( c \\) is related to the radius. For the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\), the condition for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be a tangent is that the distance from the center (which is the origin here) to the line equals the radius. The distance from the origin to the line \\( mx - y + c = 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} \\). Setting this equal to the radius \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), we get \\( \\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = \\sqrt{2} \\), so \\( |c| = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{m^2 + 1} \\). Therefore, \\( c = \\pm \\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)} \\).\n\nNow, since the tangent also touches the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\), I can substitute \\( y = mx + c \\) into the parabola's equation to find the conditions for tangency. Substituting, we get \\( (mx + c)^2 = 8x \\). Expanding this, \\( m^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 = 8x \\). Rearranging, \\( m^2x^2 + (2mc - 8)x + c^2 = 0 \\).\n\nFor this quadratic equation in \\( x \\) to have exactly one solution (since the line is tangent), the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \\( D \\)"
