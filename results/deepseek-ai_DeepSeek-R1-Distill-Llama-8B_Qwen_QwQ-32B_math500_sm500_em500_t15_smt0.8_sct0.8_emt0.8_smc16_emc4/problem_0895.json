            "output": "I need to convert the fraction 57/160 into a terminating decimal. To do this, I'll start by finding the prime factors of both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 57. 57 is divisible by 3, giving me 57 = 3 × 19. 19 is a prime number.\n\nNext, I'll factorize 160. 160 can be divided by 2 repeatedly: 160 = 2^5 × 5.\n\nNow, I'll express the fraction in terms of its prime factors:\n57/160 = (3 × 19) / (2^5 × 5).\n\nFor the fraction to become a terminating decimal, the denominator must only have prime factors of 2 and 5. I notice that the numerator has prime factors 3 and 19, which aren't in the denominator. To eliminate these, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 19.\n\nSo, multiplying numerator and denominator by 19:\n(3 × 19 × 19) / (2^5 × 5 × 19) = (3 × 361) / (32 × 5 × 19).\n\nThis simplifies to:\n1083 / 3040.\n\nNow, I'll simplify 1083/3040 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 19:\n1083 ÷ 19 = 57, and 3040 ÷ 19 = 160.\n\nThis brings me back to the original fraction, so I'll stop here. Finally, I'll perform the division 57 ÷ 160 to get the terminating decimal.\n\nDividing 57 by 160 gives me 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize the numerator and the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   57 = 3 \\times 19\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   160 = 2^5 \\times 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express the fraction in terms of its prime factors:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{3 \\times 19}{2^5 \\times 5}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **For the decimal to terminate, the denominator must only have prime factors of 2 and 5.** Since the"
