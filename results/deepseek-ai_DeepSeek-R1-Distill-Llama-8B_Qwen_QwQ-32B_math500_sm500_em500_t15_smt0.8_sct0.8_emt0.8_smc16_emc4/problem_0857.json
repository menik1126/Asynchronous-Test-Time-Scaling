So, I set up the equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37 \\)\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\( 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\times (x + 37) \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( 3x - 9 = 2x + 74 \\)\n\nNext, I'll subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides to gather like terms:\n\n\\( 3x - 2x - 9 = 74 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( x - 9 = 74 \\)\n\nFinally, I'll add 9 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x = 74 + 9 \\)\n\nSo, the value of \\( x \\) is 83.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \"Half the value of \\(3x - 9\\) is \\(x + 37\\),\" follow these steps:\n\n1. **Translate the words into an equation:**\n   \n   Half of \\(3x - 9\\) equals \\(x + 37\\).\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\times (x + 37)\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying:\n   \n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to gather like terms:**\n   \n   \\[\n   3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying"
