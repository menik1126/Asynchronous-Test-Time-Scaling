            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under a matrix M. The matrix M takes the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3) and the vector (1, -3) to (7, -1). Hmm, I think I need to figure out what M is first, and then use it to transform the line.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling that a matrix transformation takes each point (x, y) to another point (X, Y) based on the matrix multiplication. So if I can express the transformation as a matrix, I can then apply it to the line y = 2x + 1.\n\nGiven that, the matrix M should be a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with 2D vectors. Let me denote M as:\n\nM = | a  b |\n    | c  d |\n\nSo, applying M to a vector (x, y) gives (a*x + b*y, c*x + d*y). Now, according to the problem, M takes (2, -1) to (9, 3) and (1, -3) to (7, -1). That gives us two equations each for a, b, c, d.\n\nFirst transformation:\nFor (2, -1) mapping to (9, 3):\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSecond transformation:\nFor (1, -3) mapping to (7, -1):\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo, now I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nNow, I need to solve this system for a, b, c, d. Let me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d = 3\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nI can solve Equations 1 and 3 for a and b,"

One approach is to find the image of two points on the line and then determine the equation of the line connecting those transformed points.\n\nSo, let's pick two points on the original line y=2x+1. Let me choose x=0 and x=1.\n\nWhen x=0:\ny=2*0+1=1\nSo, point is (0,1)\n\nWhen x=1"

Now, I need to find the equation of the line passing through these two points.\n\nTo find the equation, I can compute the slope m first:\n\nm = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (5 -1)/(1 - (-1))=4/(2)=2\n\nSo, the slope is 2.\n\nNow, using point-slope form. Let's use point (-1,1):\n\ny -1 = 2*(x - (-1)) => y -1 = 2(x +1) => y = 2x +2 +1 => y=2x +3\n\nWait, but let me verify with the other point (1,5):\n\ny = 2x + b\n\nPlug in x=1: y=2*1 +b =>5=2 +b =>b=3\n\nYes, same result. So, the image of the line under M is y=2x +3.\n\nWait a second, but I need to make sure this is correct. Let me think if I did everything right.\n\nWait, so the original line is y=2x+1. Under the transformation, it's mapped to y=2x+3. That seems interesting because the slope remains the same, 2, but the y-intercept increased by 2. Hmm, is that a coincidence or is there some underlying reason?\n\nWait, maybe because the transformation matrix M has determinant det(M)=ad - bc=4*1 - (-1)*2=4 +2=6, which is non-zero, so it's invertible. But since the original line has a slope of 2, and the image line also has a slope of 2, that makes sense because the determinant tells us"

Maybe parametrizing the original line and then applying the transformation?\n\nAnother way: Let me parametrize the line y=2x+1 as (t, 2t+1). Then, applying M to this vector (t, 2t+1):\n\nX = 4*t + (-1)*(2t +1) =4t -2t -1=2t -1\n\nY=2*t +1*(2t +1)=2t +2t +1=4t +1\n\nSo, now, the image points are (X,Y)=(2t-1,4t+1). Now, let me express this in terms of X and Y.\n\nLet me solve for t from the X equation:\n\nX =2t -1 => 2t = X +1 => t=(X +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into Y:\n\nY=4*( (X+1)/2 ) +1=2*(X+1)+1=2X +2 +1=2X +3\n\nSo, Y=2X +3. Which is the same as y=2x +3. So that confirms the result above. So that seems consistent.\n\nWait, so this parametrization method gives the same answer as the first method. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. The image is y=2x+3. \n\nHmm, so I think that's the answer. But let me think again. In the first approach, when I chose two points on the line, transformed them, found the line between those two transformed points, got y=2x +3. The parametrization method gives the same. So that's good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do it using the general equation of the line. Suppose the original line is y=2x+1, so written as 2x - y +1 =0. To find the image under the linear transformation, perhaps?\n\nWait, but linear transformations can change lines, but since we have an affine transformation? Wait, actually, the problem says \"the image of the line under M\", where M is a matrix. Since matrices represent linear transformations, which map the origin to itself. However, if the line is affine (non-homogeneous), then when we apply the linear"
