To convert a decimal number to base six, I'll divide the number by 6 and record the remainder of each division. This process will be repeated until the quotient is zero.\n\nStarting with 999, I divide by 6, which gives a quotient of 166 and a remainder of 3. I'll record the remainder 3. Next, I'll take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6, obtaining a quotient of 27 and a remainder of 4. I'll note down the remainder 4. Continuing, I'll divide the new quotient 27 by 6, resulting in a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3. I'll record the remainder 3. Finally, I'll divide the quotient 4 by 6, which gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4. I'll note the remainder 4.\n\nAfter collecting all the remainders from each step, I'll arrange them in the order they were obtained to form the base six number. Therefore, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 3443.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide \\(999\\) by \\(6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 3\n\n2. **Divide \\(166\\) by \\(6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 4\n\n3. **Divide \\(27\\) by \\(6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 3\n\n4. **Divide \\(4\\) by \\(6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 4\n\n5. **Arrange the remainders in reverse order** to form the base six number:\n   \\[\n   3, 4, 4, 3 \\rightarrow "
