            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: (x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me start by expanding both sides, but that might take a lot of time. Wait, is there a better way?\n\nI remember that when dealing with sums of cubes, sometimes factoring or looking for patterns can help. Let me see if I can rewrite this equation in a way that makes it easier to handle. Perhaps I can look for common terms or see if both sides have similar structures.\n\nLooking at the left-hand side, we have (x - 3)^3 and (x - 7)^3. If I let a = x - 3, then the first term becomes a^3. Similarly, if I let b = x - 7, then the second term is b^3. So the left side is a^3 + b^3.\n\nNow, the right-hand side is (2x - 10)^3. Let me see if I can express 2x - 10 in terms of a and b. Since a = x - 3, then x = a + 3. Plugging that into 2x - 10, we get 2(a + 3) - 10 = 2a + 6 - 10 = 2a - 4. Similarly, since b = x - 7, then x = b + 7. So 2x -10 = 2(b +7) -10 = 2b +14 -10 = 2b +4. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Let me check that again.\n\nIf a = x -3, then x = a +3. So 2x -10 = 2(a +3) -10 = 2a +6 -10 = 2a -4. Similarly, b = x -7, so x = b +7. Therefore, 2x -10 = 2(b +7) -10 = 2b +14 -10 = 2b +4. Hmm, so 2x -10 can be expressed as either 2a -4 or 2b +4 depending on which substitution I use. Maybe that's a clue.\n\nI also recall that a^3 + b^3 ="

Let's compute a + b and a^2 - ab + b^2.\n\nFirst, a + b = (x -3) + (x -7) = 2x -10. Oh, that's the same as the right-hand side inside the cube! Interesting.\n\nSo, the left side is (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x -10)(a^2 - ab + b^2). But the right side is (2x -10)^3.\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n(2x -10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x -10)^3.\n\nLet me divide both sides by (2x -10), as long as 2x -10 \u2260 0. Wait, but if 2x -10 = 0, then x=5, and plugging back into the original equation: (5-3)^3 + (5-7)^3 = (10 -10)^3 => 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 0 => 8 -8 = 0 => 0 = 0. So x=5 is a solution.\n\nBut for the other solutions, when 2x -10 \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by (2x -10), getting:\n\na^2 - ab + b^2 = (2x -10)^2.\n\nNow, let me compute a^2 - ab + b^2.\n\nGiven that a = x -3 and b = x -7, let's compute each term.\n\nFirst, a^2 = (x -3)^2 = x^2 -6x +9.\n\nSimilarly, b^2 = (x -7)^2 = x^2 -14x +49.\n\nNow, compute ab: (x -3)(x -7) = x^2 -10x +21.\n\nSo, a^2 - ab + b^2 = (x^2 -6x +9) - (x^2 -10x +21) + (x^2 -14x +49).\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n"

When 2x -10=0, which gives x=5, that's a separate solution, as we checked earlier.\n\nSo, in total, there are three real solutions: x=3, x=5, x=7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the original equation differently.\n\nWait, let me see if x=5 is a root, and then factor out (x -5) from the equation.\n\nBut actually, in this case, since after substitution, we had that a + b = 2x -10, which led us to a quadratic equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I could have considered that (2x -10) is equal to a + b, so perhaps setting a + b = 2x -10 might lead to a substitution, but I think the way I did it earlier is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can let u = 2x -10, so that the right-hand side is u^3.\n\nThen, the left side: (x -3)^3 + (x -7)^3. Let me express x in terms of u:\n\nSince u = 2x -10, then x = (u +10)/2.\n\nSo, (x -3) = (u +10)/2 -3 = (u +10 -6)/2 = (u +4)/2.\n\nSimilarly, (x -7) = (u +10)/2 -7 = (u +10 -14)/2 = (u -4)/2.\n\nSo, the left side becomes [(u +"
