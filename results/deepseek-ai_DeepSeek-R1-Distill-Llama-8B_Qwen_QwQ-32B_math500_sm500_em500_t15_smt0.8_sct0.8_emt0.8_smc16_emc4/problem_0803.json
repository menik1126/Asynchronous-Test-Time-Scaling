They told me that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. The roots of this polynomial are distinct integers, and I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and the roots are all integers, I remember that such polynomials are called monic polynomials (meaning the leading coefficient is 1). Wait, no, actually, in this case, a_n is 2, not 1. So it's not monic. That might complicate things a bit. But the roots being integers should help.\n\nI recall that for a polynomial with integer coefficients, if it factors into linear terms, each with integer roots, then those roots must divide the constant term a_0. Since a_0 is 66, that means each root r must satisfy that r divides 66. So possible integer roots are the divisors of 66. Let me list them out: the divisors of 66 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66. So these are the possible roots.\n\nNow, since the roots are distinct integers, and the polynomial is of degree n, which I don't know yet, but a_n is 2. So it's a monic polynomial scaled by 2 or something? Wait, no, it's just a polynomial with leading coefficient 2. So if it factors, it might factor into something like (2x - r1)(2x - r2)...(2x - rn), right? Because when you expand that, the leading term would be 2^n x^n, but in our case, a_n is 2, so n must be 1? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, if the polynomial is 2x^n + ... + 66, then in order to factor it with integer roots, each root r_i would satisfy 2x - r_i is a factor? Wait, that's not quite right. Let me think"

            "output": ". Maybe the polynomial can be written as 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Because then when you expand that, the leading coefficient would be 2*1^n = 2, which matches a_n=2. So the constant term would be 2*(-r1)(-r2)...(-rn) = 2*(-1)^n * r1r2...rn. Since the constant term a_0 is 66, that tells me 2*(-1)^n * (r1*r2*...*rn) =66.\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots r1*r2*...*rn = 66/(2*(-1)^n) = 33/(-1)^n or 33/(±1). Wait, so that product must be an integer, so that works because 2 divides 66, so 66 divided by 2 is 33, and (-1)^n is either 1 or -1, so the product of the roots times that gives 33, which is an integer. Therefore, the product of the roots must be either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. Hmm, maybe?\n\nWait, let me rephrase that equation. Let me denote the product of the roots as P = r1*r2*...*rn. Then according to the constant term:\n\na_0 = 2*(-1)^n * P. Since a_0 is 66,\n\n66 = 2*(-1)^n * P => P = 66/(2*(-1)^n) = 33/(-1)^n.\n\nTherefore, P is 33*(-1)^{n+1}? Wait, no, 33 divided by (-1)^n. So if n is even, then (-1)^n is 1, so P = 33. If n is odd, then (-1)^n is -1, so P = -33. Therefore the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on n's parity. However, the roots are distinct integers, so they have to be different integers from the list we had earlier: ±1, ±2, ±3, etc.\n\nTherefore, I need to choose a set of distinct integers from the divisors of 66"

Then, for each such possible set of roots, I can compute the coefficients, specifically a_{n-1}, which is related to the sum of the roots with a sign and multiplied by something. Let me recall Vieta's formula.\n\nIn a monic polynomial (without the 2 factor), Vieta's formulas say that for f(x) = (x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn), the coefficient a_{n-1} is - (r1 + r2 + ... + rn). But in our case, the polynomial is 2*(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). So when we expand this, the coefficient of x^{n-1} would be 2*(-1)*(r1 + r2 + ... + rn). So a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| is 2*|sum of roots|. So we need to minimize |a_{n-1}|, which means we need to minimize |sum of roots|.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers (from the divisors of 66) such that their product is ±33 and the sum of their absolute values is minimized, but more precisely, the sum itself.\n\nWait, actually, the sum could be positive or negative. We need the minimal |sum|, regardless of the sign, since |a_{n-1}| will take the absolute value.\n\nSo, the strategy is:\n\n1. Find all possible sets of distinct divisors of 66 whose product is ±33.\n2. For each such set, compute the sum of the roots.\n3. Find the set where the absolute value of the sum is the smallest.\n4. Then, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is twice that minimal |sum|.\n\nAlright, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, the divisors of 66 are as I listed earlier: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66. Now, the product of some of these should be 33 or -33. Also, each root must be distinct.\n\nSo, let's think about factorizations of 33 into integers.\n\n33 can be factored into primes as 3*11.

Since the roots can be negative or positive, we need to consider all such combinations.\n\nLet me start with the case where the product is 33. Let's see possible factorizations into distinct divisors:\n\nFirst, prime factors: 3*11 = 33. So that would be two roots: 3 and 11. The product is 33, so that's one possible set {3,11}.\n\nAlternatively, we can have more factors if we include 1 and -1? Wait, but 1 can be included, but we have to keep product 33.

Because (-1)*(-3)=3, times 11 is 33.
