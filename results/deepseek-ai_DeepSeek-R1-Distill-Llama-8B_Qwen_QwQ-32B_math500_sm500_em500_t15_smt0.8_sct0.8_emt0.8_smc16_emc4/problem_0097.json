The equation given is:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\]\n\nHmm, the first thing I notice is that the denominator on the right side is a quadratic. Maybe I should factor that to make things clearer. Let me see if I can factor \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\).\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let's think... 8 and -3? Yes, because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So that factors as:\n\n\\[(x + 8)(x - 3)\\]\n\nOh, that's interesting because the denominators on the left side are also \\(x - 3\\) and \\(x + 8\\). So, the right-hand side has the same denominator as the left when combined. That makes me think that maybe the left side should be able to combine into the same denominator and then we can equate the numerators.\n\nSo let me write the left side with a common denominator. The common denominator would be \\((x - 3)(x + 8)\\). So, I need to combine the two fractions:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8}\\]\n\nTo combine them, I need to have the same denominator. So, for the first fraction, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by \\(x + 8\\), and the second fraction by \\(x - 3\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\]\n\nNow, since the denominators are the same, I can combine the numerators:\n\n\\[\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\]\n\nAnd this is equal to the right-hand side, which is:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\]\n\nSince the denominators are the"

Since this equation needs to hold for all x, the coefficients of like terms should be equal on both sides.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n\\(C(x) + C(8) + D(x) - D(3)\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\((C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\\)\n\nNow, set this equal to the right side:\n\n\\[4x - 23\\]\n\nSo, we can equate the coefficients of x and the constant terms separately.\n\nFirst, for the x terms:\n\n\\(C + D = 4\\) ...(1)\n\nThen, for the constant terms:\n\n\\(8C - 3D = -23\\) ...(2)\n\nNow, I have a system of two linear equations with two variables. I can solve this system to find the values of C and D.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n\\(C = 4 - D\\)\n\nI can substitute this into equation (2):\n\n\\(8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\\)\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply 8 by (4 - D):\n\n\\(32 - 8D\\)\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n\\(32 - 8D - 3D = -23\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(32 - 11D = -23\\)\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n\\(-11D = -23 - 32\\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\(-11D = -55\\)\n\nNow, divide both sides by -11:\n\n\\(D = \\frac{-55}{-11} = 5\\)\n\nSo, D is 5. Now, plug this back into equation (1):\n\n\\(C + 5 = 4\\)\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n\n\\(C = 4 - 5 = -1\\)\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nThe problem asks for the product CD, so:\n\n\\(CD = (-1) \\times 5 = -5\\)\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nPlugging C = -1"
