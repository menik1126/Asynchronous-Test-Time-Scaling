The problem says:\n\nLet \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\) be a sequence of positive real numbers, such that\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i = 96, \\quad \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2 = 144, \\quad \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^3 = 216.\n\\]\nFind the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to find all possible values of \\( n \\) that satisfy these three equations, and then sum those values up.\n\nFirst, I think about what these sums represent. The first sum, \\( \\sum a_i = 96 \\), is the sum of the numbers. The second sum, \\( \\sum a_i^2 = 144 \\), is the sum of their squares, and the third sum, \\( \\sum a_i^3 = 216 \\), is the sum of their cubes.\n\nI remember that when dealing with sums of powers like this, sometimes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities can come into play, but maybe more directly, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality relates the sum of the squares to the square of the sum.\n\nWait, let me think. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality says that \\( (\\sum a_i^2)(\\sum 1^2) \\geq (\\sum a_i)^2 \\). So plugging in the known values, that would be \\( 144 \\times n \\geq 96^2 \\). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute \\( 96^2 \\): 96 times 96 is 9216. So \\( 144n \\geq 9216 \\), which means \\( n \\geq 9216 / 144 \\). Let me compute that division: 9216 \u00f7 144.\n\nCalculating: 144 x 60 = 8640, so 9216 - 8640 = 576. 144 x 4 = 576. So total is 60 + 4 = 64. So \\( n \\geq 64 \\).\n\nHmm, that gives me a lower"

I recall that for positive real numbers, there's the Power Mean inequality, which relates the different power sums.\n\nThe Power Mean inequality states that for positive real numbers and for exponents \\( r > s \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\sum a_i^r}{n} \\right)^{1/r} \\geq \\left( \\frac{\\sum a_i^s}{n} \\right)^{1/s}\n\\]\nSo applying this for \\( r = 3 \\) and \\( s = 2 \\), we get:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{216}{n} \\right)^{1/3} \\geq \\left( \\frac{144}{n} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\nLet me cube both sides and square both sides to eliminate the roots.

Let me compute 144^2 first: 144 x 144.\n\nCompute 144 x 100 = 14400, 144 x 40 = 5760, 144 x 4 = 576. Adding them up: 14400 + 5760 = 20160, plus 576 is 20736. So 144^2 is 20736. Then 144^3 is 20736 x 144.\n\nHmm, that's a big number. Let me see if I can factor this expression to simplify it.\n\nWait, 144 is 12^2, and 216 is 6^3. Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Let me note that 144 is 12 squared, and 216 is 12 cubed, but perhaps more helpful, 144 is 12^2, and 216 is 12^3. Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of prime factors.\n\nLet me factorize 144: 144 = 12^2 = (2^2 x 3)^2 = 2^4 x 3^2.\n\nAnd 216: 216 = 6^3 = (2 x 3)^3 = 2^3 x 3^3.\n\nSo 144^3 = (2^4 x 3^2)^3 = 2^(12) x 3^(6).\n\nAnd 216^2 = (2^3 x 3^3)^2 = 2^6 x 3^6.\n\nSo, the fraction is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{12} x 3^6}{2^6 x 3^6} = 2^{12 - 6} = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\nWait, so \\( \\frac{144^3}{216^2} = 64 \\). Hence, \\( n \\geq 64 \\).\n\nHmm, so from the Power Mean inequality, \\( n \\geq 64 \\), same as the Cauchy-Schwarz result.\n\nWait, but we have equality conditions in these inequalities.

Let me check if that satisfies all three sums.\n\nCompute \\( \\sum a_i^2 = 64 \\times (1.5)^2 = 64 \\times 2.25 = 144 \\). Correct, that's given.\n\nAnd \\( \\sum a_i^3 = 64 \\times (1.5)^3 = 64 \\times 3.375 = 216 \\). Indeed, 64 x 3.375: 64 x 3 = 192, 64 x 0.375 = 24, so 192 + 24 = 216. So yes, it works.\n\nSo \\( n = 64 \\) is possible.\n\nNow, can there be other values of \\( n \\) greater than 64? Because in Cauchy-Schwarz and Power Mean, we have \\( n \\geq 64 \\), so \\( n \\) can be 64, 65, 66, etc. But wait, the problem states that \\( n \\) is the length of the sequence, which is a positive integer. So \\( n \\) must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 64.\n\nBut the question is, are all integers \\( n \\geq 64 \\) possible, or are there constraints that limit \\( n \\) to specific integer values?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\)\". So perhaps \\( n \\) can be any integer greater than or equal to 64. But that would make the possible values of \\( n \\) being 64, 65, 66, and so on to infinity, which doesn't make sense because we can't sum an infinite number of terms. Therefore, perhaps \\( n \\) can only take specific values where the equality condition is met, i.e., when all \\( a_i \\)s are equal, which is only when \\( n = 64 \\).\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misapplying the inequalities here.

But then, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different configuration where some terms are larger and some are smaller, so that the sum of squares can still be 144 even with more terms.
