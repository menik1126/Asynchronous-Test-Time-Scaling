I'll explore combinations that can turn larger positive numbers into negative values to minimize the total.\n\nI'll start by looking at possible groupings that subtract a larger sum from the remaining numbers. For example, grouping 4 + 5 gives 9, which I can then subtract from the rest.\n\nNext, I'll check other potential groupings like 3 - (4 + 5) + 6, which simplifies to 3 - 9 + 6, resulting in a value of 3.\n\nI'll also examine grouping 1 + 2 + 3 together and then subtracting the sum of 4, 5, and 6, which gives 6 - 9 + 6 = 3.\n\nAfter evaluating these possibilities, I find that the smallest value obtained from these groupings is 3.\n</think>\n\nLet's explore different ways to add parentheses to minimize the value of the expression:\n\n1. **Original Expression:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\n   \\]\n   Calculating without parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13\n   \\]\n\n2. **First Grouping (4 + 5):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 - 9 + 6 = 6 - 9 + 6 = 3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Second Grouping (1 + 2 + 3):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 2 + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 - 4 = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13\n   \\]\n\n4. **Third Grouping (3 - 4 + 5):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + (3 - 4 + 5) + 6 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 6"

The original expression must keep the order of terms. Grouping \\(4 + 5 + 6\\) would require parentheses around them, but the term after 3 is \"-4\", so:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = 6 - 15 = -9\n   \\]\n   This is valid and gives a smaller value.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the terms are 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. To group 4 + 5 + 6, we need to consider the subtraction before 4. So the correct calculation would be:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = (1+2+3) - (4+5+6) = 6 - 15 = -9\n\\]\nThis is a valid grouping and results in -9, which is smaller than 3.\n\nWait, but the problem states that we cannot rearrange terms. Let me check again. The original sequence is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. To group 4 + 5 + 6, the parentheses would be around those terms starting from the 4. Since the operator before 4 is a minus, the parentheses would make it subtract the entire group (4+5+6). This is allowed as long as the order isn't changed."

However, in the example given, 1+2+3-(4+5)+6 equals 3, which suggests that placing parentheses in different ways can indeed change the value significantly.\n\nBut according to standard operator precedence, addition and subtraction have the same precedence and are evaluated left to right without parentheses. So without parentheses, the expression is 1+2=3; 3+3=6; 6-4=2; 2+5=7; 7+6=13.\n\nIf we add parentheses as (1+2+3) - (4+5) +6, which changes the order implicitly, that's allowed as we can insert parentheses. So in that case, the calculation is (1+2+3)=6; then 6 - (4+5)=6-9= -3; then -3 +6=3.\n\nAlternatively, if we group 4+5+6, we can do 1+2+3 - (4+5+6)=6-15=-9.\n\nBut is the original expression's order 1 + 2 + 3 -4 +5 +6? So the positions are: 1, 2, 3, -4, +5, +6.\n\nSo to group 4,5,6, we can write 1+2+3 - (4+5+6). Is that allowed? Because the original expression doesn't have those parentheses, but we can add them.\n\nSo according to the problem, we can add parentheses in any location, as long as we don't change the order. Therefore, this is allowed, and the calculation gives -9.\n\nWait, but in the initial exploration, I thought the minimum was 3, but upon closer examination, adding parentheses to group 4,5,6 gives a smaller value.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible value is -9.\n\nWait, but let me verify the calculation:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6) = (1+2+3) - (4+5+6) = 6 - 15 = -9.\n\nYes, that"
