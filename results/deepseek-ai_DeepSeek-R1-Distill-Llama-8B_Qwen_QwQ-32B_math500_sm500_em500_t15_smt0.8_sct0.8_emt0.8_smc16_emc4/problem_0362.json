Let's denote the current number of blue marbles as B and the number of yellow marbles as Y.\n\nGiven that the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3, I can set up the equation B/Y = 4/3, which means 3B = 4Y or Y = (3/4)B.\n\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes 7:3. This gives the equation (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3, which simplifies to 3(B + 5) = 7(Y - 3).\n\nSubstituting Y = (3/4)B into the second equation, I get 3(B + 5) = 7((3/4)B - 3). Expanding and simplifying this equation will allow me to solve for B.\n\nBy solving the equation step by step, I can find the value of B, which represents the original number of blue marbles in the bag.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = Current number of blue marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = Current number of yellow marbles\n\n**Given:**\n1.
