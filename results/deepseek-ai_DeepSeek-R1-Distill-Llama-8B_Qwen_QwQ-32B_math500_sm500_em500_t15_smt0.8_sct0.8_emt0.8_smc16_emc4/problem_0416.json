These roots come in complex conjugate pairs because the coefficients of the polynomial are real. So, that explains why the roots are given as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\).\n\nThe problem is asking for the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\). Hmm, okay, so each term is the reciprocal of the product of a root and its conjugate.\n\nFirst, I recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\). Since \\(r\\overline{r} = |r|^2\\), the reciprocal would be \\(\\frac{1}{|r|^2}\\). So, each term in the sum is essentially \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\), where \\(r_i\\) are the roots.\n\nTherefore, the sum we're looking for is the sum of the reciprocals of the squared magnitudes of each pair of complex conjugate roots.\n\nSince the polynomial is of degree 10, and the roots come in conjugate pairs, I can consider each pair \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r_i}\\) as roots, but their magnitudes squared are the same because \\(|r_i| = |\\overline{r_i}|\\). So, each pair contributes twice the value of \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\). But wait, in the problem, each pair is counted once with \\(r_i\\) and once with \\(\\overline{r_i}\\), but since they are conjugates, their magnitudes are equal, so each pair is represented twice in the sum but each contributes the same value. Therefore, the sum is just five times the reciprocal of the squared magnitude of each root.\n\nWait, actually, in"

Wait, hold on, actually, the problem lists the roots as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\), so there are 10 roots total. The sum is over five terms, each term being the reciprocal of the product of a root and its conjugate. Since each pair \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) has the same product \\(r_i\\overline{r}_i\\), so each term in the sum is \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\), and there are five such terms. Therefore, the total sum is the sum over each pair's reciprocal squared magnitude. So, the problem reduces to finding the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) for each of the five pairs.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) for each root \\(r_i\\), but since each pair contributes the same term, it's just five terms each being \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). Wait, actually, no, each pair is represented once in the sum. Since each pair is \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r_i}\\), but the term is only for each \\(r_i\\), so each pair is counted once.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the polynomial and use Vieta's formula.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me denote the polynomial as \\(P(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\). So, expanding \\( (13x - 1)^{10} \\) using the binomial theorem, but that might be too cumbersome. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it or analyze it to find relations between roots and their conjugates.\n\nWait, but since the sum is only over the reciprocal of squared magnitudes, maybe there's a clever way to express this without computing each root.\n\nI remember that for a polynomial, if we consider the sum of \\(1 / (x \\overline{x})\\) over all roots \\(x\\), perhaps we can relate it to the coefficients. Let me think about the product \\(x \\overline{x}\\), which is \\(|x|^2\\), so \\(1/|x|^2 = 1/x \\overline{x}\\). But how does this relate to the polynomial?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I consider the reciprocal polynomial. Let me define a substitution \\(y = 1/x\\). Then, a polynomial in \\(x\\) can be transformed into a polynomial in \\(y\\).\n\nBut before that, maybe I should think about writing the given equation as \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, but that might not be straightforward because we don't know the roots. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as \\( (x / (13x - 1))^{10} = -1 \\). Since both sides are raised to the 10th power, the left-hand side is a real number if x is real, but since it's a complex equation, maybe that's not"

Taking both sides to the power of 1/10, but since we are dealing with complex numbers, we can write \\(13 z - 1 = \\omega z\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\).

Then, taking the 10th roots of both sides, we have \\(13 z - 1 = \\omega z\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\).

Since each pair \\(r_i, \\overline{r}_i\\) has the same product \\(r_i \\overline{r}_i\\), so each term in the sum is the reciprocal of that product. Therefore, the total sum is the sum over each pair's reciprocal product, so five terms. Each pair corresponds to two roots in the original equation, but each pair contributes one term to the sum. Therefore, the total sum is exactly the sum over each pair's reciprocal product, which is the same as the sum over each pair's \\( |13 - \\omega_k|^2 \\), where each pair corresponds to two roots \\( \\omega_k \\) and \\( \\overline{\\omega_k} \\). Since each pair's contribution to S is \\( |13 - \\omega_k|^2 + |13 - \\overline{\\omega_k}|^2 = 2 |13 - \\omega_k|^2 \\), so the total S is twice the problem's sum.

Since these roots are symmetrically placed on the unit circle, their real parts cancel out. So, sum Re(ω_k) = 0.\n\nTherefore, sum |13 - ω_k|^2 = 10*170 -26*0 = 1700.\n\nTherefore, the sum over all 10 roots is 1700. But since the problem's sum is over five terms, each term being 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) = |13 - ω_k|^2, but each pair of roots contributes two terms to the total sum S, so the problem's sum is S / 2 = 850.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 850.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let me consider the polynomial P(x) = x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}. Let me factor it as (13x -1)^{10} = -x^{10}. Taking the 10th root on both sides, we have 13x -1 = ω x, where ω^10 = -1. So, solving for x gives x = 1/(13 - ω), as before.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x = 1/(13 - ω), where ω are the 10th roots of -1.\n\nSo, the roots are r_j = 1/(13 - ω_j), for j=1 to 10.\n\nTherefore, the product r_j \\overline{r_j} = |r_j|^2 = 1 / |13 - ω_j|^2.\n\nThus, 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |13 - ω_j|^2.\n\nTherefore, the sum over all roots of 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) is sum_{j=1}^{10} |13 - ω_j|^2 = 1700, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut in the problem, the roots are grouped into conjugate pairs, so we have five terms in the sum: 1/(r_1 \\overline{r_1}) + 1/(r_2 \\overline{r_2}) + ... + 1/(r_5 \\overline{"
