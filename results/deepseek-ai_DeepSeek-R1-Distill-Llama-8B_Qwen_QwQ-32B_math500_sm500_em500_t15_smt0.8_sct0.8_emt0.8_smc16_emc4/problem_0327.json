In how many ways can he pick 3 boys and 2 girls to give a group presentation tomorrow? (The order in which the boys and girls are chosen does not matter.)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to select **3 boys** from **7 boys** available.\n   - We also need to select **2 girls** from **4 girls** available.\n   - The order of selection does not matter, so we'll use combinations.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Choose Boys:**\n   - Number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Ways to Choose Girls:**\n   - Number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Total Number of Ways to Form the Group:**\n   - Multiply the number of ways to choose boys by the number of ways to choose girls:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total ways} = \\binom{7}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
