            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of possible combinations of dishes that Yann and Camille can order without any restrictions. Since there are 10 different dishes available, Yann has 10 choices, and for each of those choices, Camille also has 10 options.\n\nThis means the total number of unrestricted combinations is 10 multiplied by 10, which equals 100.\n\nNow, I need to consider the restriction that Yann and Camille cannot order the same dish. To account for this, I'll first calculate the number of combinations where their dishes are identical. Since Yann has 10 options, Camille only has 9 remaining options that are different from Yann's choice. Therefore, there are 10 multiplied by 9, totaling 90, combinations where they order the same dish.\n\nBy subtracting the restricted combinations from the total combinations, I find the number of valid combinations where their dishes are different. So, 100 minus 90 equals 10.\n\nFinally, since it matters who orders which dish, each distinct pairing is unique. Thus, there are 10 different combinations where Yann and Camille order different dishes.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**\nYann and Camille go to a restaurant. If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what\u2014Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Total Number of Possible Combinations Without Restrictions:**\n   \n   - There are 10 dishes available on the menu.\n   - Yann can choose any of the 10 dishes.\n   - For each dish Yann chooses, Camille can also choose any of the 10 dishes.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Combinations} = 10 \\times 10 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of Combinations Where Both Order the Same Dish:**\n   \n   - Yann chooses 1 dish.\n   - Camille must choose the same dish as Yann.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Same Dish Combinations} = 10 \\times 1 = 10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Number of Combinations Where They Order Different Dishes:**\n   \n   -"
