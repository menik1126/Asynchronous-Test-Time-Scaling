            "output": "I need to determine how many different license plates can be formed when each plate consists of two distinct letters from A to Z followed by two distinct one-digit numbers from 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, let me consider the letters. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and each of the two positions on the license plate is to be occupied by a different letter. For the first letter, there are 26 possible choices. Once the first letter is chosen, there are only 25 letters left for the second position. Therefore, the number of possible combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, I will consider the numbers. The digits range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible choices for each digit. Similar to the letters, the first digit has 10 possible choices, and the second digit has 9 remaining choices after the first digit is chosen. So, the number of possible combinations for the numbers is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I need to multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations. This means adding the two results together: 26 * 25 * 10 * 9.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. I should multiply the number of letter combinations (26 * 25) by the number of number combinations (10 * 9) to get the total number of license plates. So, the calculation should be 26 * 25 * 10 * 9.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me correct that. The correct calculation is to multiply the number of letter combinations (26 * 25) by the number of number combinations (10 * 9), resulting in 26 * 25 * 10 * 9.\n\nSo, the total number of license plates that can be formed is 26 * 25 * 10 * 9, which equals 26 * 25 * 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of unique license plates possible under the given conditions, we'll break down the problem into steps.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of possible combinations for the letters.**\n\nThere are 26 letters in the English alphabet. Since we need two different letters:\n\n- For the first letter: 26 options.\n- For the second letter: Since it must be different from the first, there are 25 options.\n\n**Total letter combinations:**  \n26 \u00d7 25"
