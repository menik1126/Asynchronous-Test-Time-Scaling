The problem is asking for the units digit of 4\\$.\\n\\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what the superfactorial is. From the definition given, it looks like n\\$ is a tower of factorials with n! at the top, then another n! below that, and so on, repeating n! times. So for n=4, it's a tower starting with 4!, then 3!, then 2!, then 1!, but wait, that doesn't seem to add up to four factorials. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me see: the notation is n\\$, and it's defined as n! raised to the power of itself n! times. So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(...)) with four 4!s? Wait, no, I think the tower has n levels, so for n=4, it's four levels of factorials: 4!, then 3!, then 2!, then 1!. Wait, no, that's not right, because 4! is the top level, and each level below is another factorial, but if the tower has n! levels, that's way more. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the definition says n\\$ is a tower where the top of the tower is n!, then below that is n! again, all the way down, but the height of the tower is n! levels. So for n=4, the superfactorial 4\\$ is 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!...))) with four 4!s? Wait, that seems confusing. Let me check: the superfactorial is defined as n\\$ = n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}} with n! in the exponent n! times. So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!...))) with four levels? Or is it that the tower has n levels, with each level being n!?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many factorials there are. The notation is n\\$ = [n!]^{[n!]^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}"

But maybe I need to recheck the problem. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: \"The superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = underbrace_{n!} n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}}. So the notation is a tower with exponentiation, with the number of layers being n!, each layer being n!.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misinterpret the definition. The underbrace specifies the number of layers: the expression is an exponential tower of n! terms, each term is n!. So for n, the superfactorial is n! raised to the power of n! raised to the power of n! and so on, with a total of n! terms in the exponent tower. So for n=4, 4\\$ is 4!^(4!^(4!^(...))) with 24 levels. But that seems incredibly large.\n\nWait, but the question is just about the units digit. So perhaps we don't need to compute the whole number, just find its last digit. Since units digit cycles modulo 10, and for exponents, Euler's theorem might help here because Euler's theorem relates to modular arithmetic. Let me recall Euler's theorem: if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n. For n=10, \u03c6(10)=4. So if we can find exponents modulo \u03c6(10)=4, then modulo 10, but this is a tower so we need to consider the modulus at each level.\n\nHowever, since the modulus here is 10, the units digit depends on the power's value modulo 10. But because exponents can be huge, we can use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify. The key idea is that the units digit cycles with period 4 for exponents when the base is coprime to 10, but even when not coprime, there might be patterns.\n\nWait, but first let me confirm the definition again because if n\\$ is a tower of n! terms each of n!, then for 4\\$ it would be 24 copies of 24"

But that's too unwieldy, so perhaps we can find a pattern in the exponents modulo \u03c6(10)=4, because for the topmost exponent, the units digit of a^b depends on b mod 4 when a is coprime to 10.\n\nWait, but 24 is 4! =24, which is 0 mod 10, so 24 ends with 4, but 24 mod 10 is 4, but we need 24 mod \u03c6(10)=4, which is 24 mod 4=0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nWe can represent the superfactorial 4\\$ as a tower of exponents where each level is 4! mod something.\n\nBut let's consider that the units digit (mod 10) of a number depends only on its last digit. So let me consider each factorial:\n\n1! =1, 2!=2, 3!=6, 4!=24 (mod 10=4).\n\nSo when considering 4\\$, it's a tower where each factorial is 24, which is 4 mod 10.\n\nSo 4\\$ is 24^(24^(24^...)) with a total of 24 layers. But that's still too much, so we can use Euler's theorem at each step.\n\nBut first, let me note that 24 and 10 are not coprime (since 24 and 10 share a factor of 2). So Euler's theorem only applies when a and n are coprime. Therefore, for each step, we have to compute the modulus carefully.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the exponents modulo \u03c6(10)=4 and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem if needed.\n\nWait, but 24 mod 10 is 4, so maybe 24^k mod 10 cycles with some period. Let's check.\n\nSince 24 \u22614 mod 10, so 24^k mod 10 =4^k mod 10.\n\nWe know that 4^1=4, 4^2=16\u22616, 4^3=64\u22614, 4^4=256\u22616, and so on. So the cycle is 4"

So the units digit of 4^k is 4 if k is odd, 6 if even.\n\nTherefore, if we can find whether the exponent is even or odd, we can determine the units digit.\n\nWait, but the exponent here is another tower of 24s. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote the tower as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the tower as T = 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 levels. We need to find T mod 10.\n\nFirst, since T = 24^E, where E is the exponent tower of height 23 (since the total height is 24, so the exponent is the tower of 23 24s).\n\nTo compute 24^E mod 10, since 24 mod 10 is 4, so it's equivalent to 4^E mod 10.\n\nAs above, 4^E mod 10 cycles every 2. So if E is even, the result is 6; if odd, 4.\n\nTherefore, we need to determine whether E is even or odd.\n\nE is the exponent tower of 23 24s. Let's see:\n\nE = 24^(24^(...)) with 23 levels.\n\nNow, since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even. So the exponent of the first 24 in the tower (the second level) is 24^(...) which is even. Therefore, the exponent E is 24^(even). But 24 is even, so 24^(anything) is even, so E is even. Wait, but let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the exponent E is 24^(24^(...)) with 23 levels. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the top, the topmost exponent is 24 (the 23rd level). Then the next one down is 24^(24), then 24^(24^(24)), etc. But regardless, each exponent in the tower is 24 raised to something, so each exponent is divisible by 24, hence even. Therefore, the exponent E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nWait, but"

So yes, E is even.\n\nTherefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nBut wait, this might be too simplistic. Let me check with smaller n to see if this approach works.\n\nWait, for n=1, 1\\$ =1, units digit 1.\n\nFor n=2, 2\\$=2!^2!=2^2=4, units digit 4.\n\nFor n=3, 3\\$=3!^(3!^3!)=6^(6^6). Now, 6^6=46656, which is even, so 6^(even) mod 10 is 6, so units digit 6.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, 4\\$=24^(24^...24) with 24 levels. The top exponent is 24, which is even. The next exponent is 24^24, which is even, and so on, so the entire exponent tower E is even. Therefore, 24^E mod 10=4^E mod10=6.\n\nWait, that seems to fit, but let me go through it again.\n\nBut let me think about the exponent's parity. Since the top exponent is 24 (even), the next exponent is 24^24, which is even (since any power of even is even), then the next is 24^(24^24), which is even, and so on. So regardless of how many levels, all exponents in the tower are 24^something, which is even. So E is even. Therefore, 4^E ends with 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n\nWait, but let me test with n=3 as an example. For n=3, 3\\$=6^(6^6). Now, 6^6=46656, which is even, so 6^even ends with 6.

Since E is even, 4^even mod10 is 6. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6. But let me check if there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider the modulus of the exponent with \u03c6(10)=4. Because Euler's theorem says that if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u22611 mod n. Since 4 and 10 are not coprime, Euler's theorem doesn't apply here. So my previous approach is okay because I considered the cycle of 4 mod 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider modulus 10, but since 4 and 10 are not coprime, the exponent cycles might be different. Let me see:\n\n4^1 mod10=4\n\n4^2 mod10=6\n\n4^3 mod10=4\n\n4^4 mod10=6\n\nSo the cycle is indeed 2. So the exponent's parity determines the result. Since E is even, 4^E mod10=6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6. Hmm, but let me see if there's another angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tower is of height n! which is 24, so the tower is 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 copies. But even so, the exponent is a tower of 23 24s. Since each exponent in the tower is even, the total exponent E is even, so 4^E mod10 is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the entire exponent is even. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the tower is 24^(24^(24^...)). Let me consider the exponent E = 24^(24^...). Since the top of the exponent is 24, which is even, so the next exponent down is 24^even, which is even, and so on. So"
