            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to write the expression \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I have to find the sum a + b + c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression has four terms: two involving \u221a2 and two involving \u221a3. Each pair, like \u221a2 and 1/\u221a2, seems to be related. Maybe I can combine each pair separately before tackling the whole expression.\n\nStarting with \u221a2 and 1/\u221a2. I remember that 1/\u221a2 can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a2, so 1/\u221a2 becomes \u221a2/2. So, if I rewrite the expression, it becomes \u221a2 + \u221a2/2. Similarly, for \u221a3 and 1/\u221a3, 1/\u221a3 becomes \u221a3/3 after rationalization. So that part becomes \u221a3 + \u221a3/3.\n\nNow, let's combine the terms for \u221a2 first: \u221a2 is the same as 2*(\u221a2)/2, right? So, adding them together: 2*(\u221a2)/2 + (\u221a2)/2 = (2\u221a2 + \u221a2)/2. That simplifies to (3\u221a2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for \u221a3 and \u221a3/3: \u221a3 is 3*(\u221a3)/3, so adding them together: 3*(\u221a3)/3 + (\u221a3)/3 = (3\u221a3 + \u221a3)/3. That simplifies to (4\u221a3)/3.\n\nSo now, the original expression simplifies to (3\u221a2)/2 + (4\u221a3)/3. Now, I need to combine these two fractions. To add them, they need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator is 6.\n\nTo convert each fraction: (3\u221a2)/2 becomes (3\u221a2 * 3)/6 = 9\u221a2/6, and (4\u221a3)/3 becomes (4\u221a3 * 2)/6 = 8\u221a3/6. Adding those together: 9\u221a2/6"

            "output": " + 8\u221a3/6 = (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nSo, the expression is now (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6. Let me check if this can be simplified further. The denominator is 6, which is the least common multiple of 2 and 3, so I don't think it can be simplified any further in terms of reducing c. So, c is 6.\n\nNow, the numerator is 9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3, which means a is 9 and b is 8. Therefore, a + b + c is 9 + 8 + 6, which equals 23.\n\nWait, hold on. I just realized something. When I added \u221a2 and \u221a2/2, I did 2*(\u221a2)/2 + (\u221a2)/2. Is that correct? Let me check: 2*(\u221a2)/2 is indeed \u221a2, and adding 1/2 of \u221a2 gives 1.5\u221a2, which is 3\u221a2/2. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for \u221a3 and \u221a3/3: 3*(\u221a3)/3 is \u221a3, adding 1/3 of \u221a3 gives (4/3)\u221a3. That also checks out.\n\nWhen combining the fractions, 3\u221a2/2 is equal to 9\u221a2/6 and 4\u221a3/3 is equal to 8\u221a3/6. Adding these gives 9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3 over 6, which is correct.\n\nSo, a is 9, b is 8, c is 6. Adding them together is 9 + 8 + 6 = 23. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by rationalizing the denominators and combining like terms.\n\nFirst, rationalize each fraction:\n- \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\)\n\nRewrite the original expression:\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\]\n\nCombine the terms involving \u221a2 and \u221a3 separately:\n-"
