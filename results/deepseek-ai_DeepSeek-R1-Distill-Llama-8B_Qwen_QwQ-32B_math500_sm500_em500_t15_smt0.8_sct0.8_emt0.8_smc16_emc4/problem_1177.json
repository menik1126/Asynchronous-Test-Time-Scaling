Solving quartic equations can be tricky, but since the solutions form a convex polygon in the complex plane, maybe there's a pattern or a substitution that can simplify this.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). I notice that the coefficients have a pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. That seems almost like the coefficients of a binomial expansion, perhaps \\( (z + i)^4 \\) or something similar. Let me check:\n\nCompute \\( (z + i)^4 \\). \n\nFirst, \\( (z + i)^2 = z^2 + 2zi + i^2 = z^2 + 2zi - 1 \\).\n\nThen, \\( (z + i)^4 = [(z + i)^2]^2 = (z^2 + 2zi - 1)^2 \\).\n\nExpanding that:\n\n\\( (z^2 + 2zi - 1)^2 = z^4 + 4z^3i + (4z^2)(-1) + ... Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully.\n\nLet me expand \\( (z^2 + 2zi - 1)(z^2 + 2zi - 1) \\).\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, \\( z^2 * z^2 = z^4 \\).\n\nThen, \\( z^2 * 2zi = 2z^3i \\).\n\nThen, \\( z^2 * (-1) = -z^2 \\"

Hmm! The only difference is the constant term: in \\( (z + i)^4 \\) it's +1, but here it's -i.

The distance between two points on a circle separated by angle theta is 2r sin(theta/2).

So, that can't be right; I think I'm mixing up some concepts here.\n\nWait, no. Let's recast this.\n\nOriginal square on the circle: radius 2^{1/8}, four roots separated by angle pi/2. So, the original square has vertices on the circle, and side length is 2 * 2^{1/8} * sin(pi/4).

Wait, the original roots are on a circle centered at the origin, so their centroid is the origin. After translating all points by -i, the centroid is shifted to -i, but the shape remains a square with the same side length and area.

The distance between two adjacent vertices is the chord length, which is 2r sin(theta/2). Theta here is 90 degrees, which is pi/2 radians. So, sin(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2. So chord length is 2 * 2^{1/8} * sqrt(2)/2 = 2^{1/8} * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so multiplying gives 2^{1/8 + 1/2} = 2^{5/8}. So that's correct. Then the area of the square is (side length)^2 = (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4}. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^{5/4}, so expressed as p^{a/b} with p prime, so 2^{5/4} is already in that form.
