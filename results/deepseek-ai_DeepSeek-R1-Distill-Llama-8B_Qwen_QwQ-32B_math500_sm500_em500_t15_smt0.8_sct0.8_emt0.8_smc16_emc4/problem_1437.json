Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\\[\n2^{24} = k^n\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is a positive integer and \\( n > 1 \\).\n\nNext, I'll analyze the exponent in the prime factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\). Since \\( 2 \\) is the only prime factor, the exponent is directly related to the value of \\( n \\). For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, \\( n \\) must divide evenly into \\( 24 \\).\n\nTo find all possible values of \\( n \\), I'll list all the divisors of \\( 24 \\) that are greater than \\( 1 \\). These divisors are:\n\\[\n2, \\ 3, \\ 4, \\ 6, \\ 8, \\ 12, \\ 24\n\\]\nEach of these values of \\( n \\) will satisfy the condition that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power because \\( 24 \\) is divisible by each \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, there are \\( 7 \\) positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition\nA perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power means that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\n2^{24} = k^n\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is a positive integer and \\( n > 1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Prime Factorization\n"
