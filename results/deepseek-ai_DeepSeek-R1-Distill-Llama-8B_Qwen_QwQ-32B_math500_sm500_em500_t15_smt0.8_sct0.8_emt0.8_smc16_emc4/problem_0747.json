            "output": "First, I'll start by simplifying the left side of the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x\\). I know that \\(2^3\\) is equal to 8. So the equation becomes \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This gives me \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\), which simplifies to \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(x\\) in the equation \\(3^x = 9\\). I recognize that 9 is equal to \\(3^2\\). Therefore, the equation becomes \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other, which means \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given the equation:\n\\[\n2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Simplify \\(2^3\\).\n\\[\n2^3 = 8\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Divide both sides by 8 to isolate \\(3^x\\).\n\\[\n3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Recognize that 9 can be expressed as a power of 3.\n\\[\n9 = 3^2\n\\]\nSo, the equation is now:\n\\[\n3^x = 3^2\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other.\n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
