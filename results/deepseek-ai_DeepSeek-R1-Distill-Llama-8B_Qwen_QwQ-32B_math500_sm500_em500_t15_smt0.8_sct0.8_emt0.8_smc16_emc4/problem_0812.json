I know that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. The polynomial has distinct integer roots, and I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Since the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, it must be a monic polynomial multiplied by some integer coefficient. But wait, a_n is given as 2, not 1. So maybe the polynomial is 2 times a monic polynomial. Let me think about that.\n\nIf the polynomial has integer roots, let's say the roots are r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, all distinct integers. Then the polynomial can be written as f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n). When I expand this, the constant term a_0 will be 2 times the product of the roots with a sign. Specifically, a_0 = 2*(-1)^n (r_1 r_2 ... r_n). In our case, a_0 is 66, so 2*(-1)^n (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 66. That means r_1 r_2 ... r_n = 66 / 2 * (-1)^n = 33*(-1)^n.\n\nSo the product of the roots is either 33 or -33 depending on whether n is even or odd.\n\nNow, the question is about minimizing the absolute value of a_{n-1}. Let's recall that in the expanded polynomial, the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to 2 times the negative sum of the roots. Wait, no, more precisely, when you expand (x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), the coefficient of x^{n-1} is - (sum of roots). Then, since our polynomial is 2 times that, the coefficient a_{n-1} is 2*(-sum of roots) = -2*(sum of roots). So |a_{n-1}| is | -2*("

So to minimize |a_{n-1}|, I need to minimize |sum of roots|.\n\nSo our goal is to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and whose sum is as close to zero as possible.\n\nWait, but the product is 33 or -33, right? 33 factors into 1, 3, 11, 33. Since the roots are distinct integers, we need to find a factorization of 33 into distinct integers. Also, 33 is positive, so if n is even, the product is 33; if n is odd, it's -33. But since we can choose the signs of the roots to adjust the product, maybe we can also consider negative factors.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to just consider the factors of 33 and -33. Wait, but 33 is positive, so if the number of roots is even, the product is positive, otherwise negative.\n\nSo let's list all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33. Since 33 is 3*11, and 1*3*11 is 33, but are there other factorizations? Let me think.\n\nWait, 33 is prime factors 3 and 11, but considering 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, 33, -33. So perhaps using both positive and negative integers.\n\nWe need distinct integers, so let's try to find small sets where we can get the product to be 33 or -33.\n\nBut the problem is that the product is 33 or -33, but since the product is fixed, whether it's 33 or -33 depends on whether the number of roots is even or odd. Wait, no, earlier I saw that a_0 = 66 is equal to 2*(-1)^n(r1 r2...rn). So 2*(-1)^n (r1 r2...rn) = 66, so r1 r2...rn = 33*(-1)^n.\n\nSo if n is even, then r1 r2...rn = 33, if n is odd, it's -33.
