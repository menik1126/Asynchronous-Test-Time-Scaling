From the definition, the superfactorial of n, denoted as n\\$, is a tower of exponentials where each level is n! (n factorial). So, for example, 4\\$ would be 4!^(4!^(4!^...)) with 4! at the top, right?\n\nWait, actually, no, the definition says it's n! raised to the power of itself n! times. So, 4\\$ is 4!^(4!^(4!^(...))) with four factorials? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify how the tower is built.\n\nLet me write it down step by step. The superfactorial is defined as n\\$ = n!^{n!^{...^{n!}}} with n levels. So for 4\\$, there are four levels: 4!, then 4!^4!, then 4!^{4!^{4!}}, and so on, four times in total? Or is it more? Wait, no, the exponentiation is right-associative, so it's n!^{n!^{...^{n!}}} with n copies of n!.\n\nWait, no, actually, the superfactorial is sometimes defined as a tower of exponents where each level is n!, with the number of levels equal to n. So, for 4\\$, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). Wait, that doesn't make sense because 4! is 24. So 24^24 is 24^(24), which is a huge number, but we only care about the units digit.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I can find a pattern in the units digit when exponentiating 4!.\n\nSince 4! is 24, which ends with a 4. So, 24^k mod 10. The units digit of 24^k cycles every certain number because the units digit of powers cycles with a period.\n\nWhat's the pattern of 4 in the units place when raised to successive powers?\n\n4^1 = 4 (units digit 4)\n4^2 = 16 (units digit 6)\n4^3 = 64 (units digit 4)\n4^4 = 256 (units digit 6)\nSo, the cycle"

But according to the exponent cycles, for powers of 4:\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify: 24 mod 4 is 0, so 24 \u2261 0 mod 4, so when you have 24^k mod 10, maybe the Euler totient theorem can help here?\n\nEuler's theorem states that if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n. But 24 and 10 are not coprime, since they share factors 2. Hmm, so maybe better to separate using Chinese Remainder theorem?\n\nAlternatively, since we just need mod 10, let's see:\n\nThe units digit of 24^k is the same as the units digit of 4^k, because any number ending with 4 raised to a power will have the same units digit as 4^k. Wait, is that true?\n\nLet me test:\n\n24^1 = 24 \u2192 4\n24^2 = 576 \u2192 6\n24^3 = 13,824 \u2192 4\n24^4 = 331,776 \u2192 6\nYes! So indeed, the units digit cycles between 4 and 6 depending on whether the exponent is odd or even. So the pattern is period 2: if exponent is odd, units digit 4; even, 6.\n\nTherefore, if I can determine whether the exponent is even or odd, then I can know the units digit.\n\nSo, working bottom-up, the tower is 24^(24^(24^...)) with four 24s, right?\n\nWait, hold on, the problem says:\n\nThe superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = n!^{n!^{n!^{...}}} with n! instances?

Wait, the subscript says \"n!\" so perhaps the tower has n! levels, each exponent being n!.\n\nWait, that seems a bit more likely. So, for 4\\$, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!^...))) with four layers?

That seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tower has n levels, each level being n!.\n\nWait, no, the subscript is n!, which is 24 for n=4. So perhaps the tower has 24 levels, each exponentiation being 4!.\n\nI think I need to clarify.\n\nLooking up, the superfactorial can be defined as n\\$ = n!^{n!^{...}} with n copies of n!. So, for n=4, 4\\$ is 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!^(4!^...)))) with four 4!s? Or is it more?\n\nWait, I might be overcomplicating, perhaps a better approach is to use properties of modular arithmetic to compute the tower mod 10, since we only care about the units digit.\n\nSo, let's recall that 4! is 24. So, 24 \u2261 4 mod 10. So, if we can compute 4^k mod 10, we can find the units digit.\n\nBut since we have a tower of exponents, we need to reduce the exponents mod \u03c6(10)=4, because of Euler's theorem, but since 4 and 10 are not coprime, we need to be careful.\n\nWait, perhaps to figure out the units digit of 24^k, it's better to note that 24 \u2261 4 mod 10, and 4^k cycles every 2 (as 4^1=4, 4^2=16, etc.), as I saw earlier.\n\nTherefore, if we can find the exponent k mod"

That's a tower of 24 copies of 24? That's an astronomically large number, but maybe we can find the units digit by working modulo 10, and then using Euler's theorem step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition where the number of exponents is n, not n!.\n\nWait, the problem says \"underbrace{ n!^{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}\".\n\nThe underbrace notation usually indicates the number of terms.

Let's denote:\n\nLet T = 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 levels.\n\nWe need to find T mod 10.\n\nSince 24 \u2261 4 mod 10, we can rewrite T \u2261 4^(4^(4^...^4)) mod 10.\n\nSo, T \u2261 4^E mod 10, where E is the exponent tower of 24s with 23 levels (since the last exponent is 24, which is 4 mod 10, so E = 4^(4^(...^4)) with 23 fours.\n\nWait, but 24 is congruent to 4 mod 10, so E \u2261 4^(4^(...^4)) with 23 fours. Wait, maybe we can write T \u2261 4^E mod 10, and E \u2261 4^(E') mod something, recursively.\n\nSo, perhaps we can compute E mod 2 because the cycle of 4 mod 10 is 2.\n\nWait, as before, 4^k mod 10 is 4 if k is odd, 6 if k is even.\n\nSo, if I can compute E mod 2, that will determine whether T is 4 or 6 mod 10.\n\nSo, E is 4^(4^(...)) with 23 fours. Let me denote E = 4^(E'), where E' is 4^(...^4) with 22 fours.\n\nSo, E = 4^{E'}, and we need E mod 2.\n\nBut 4 \u2261 0 mod 2, so 4^anything \u2261 0 mod 2, except 4^0, which is 1, but since all exponents are at least 1, E' is at least 4, so E is 0 mod 2.\n\nTherefore, E is even, so T = 4^E \u2261"
