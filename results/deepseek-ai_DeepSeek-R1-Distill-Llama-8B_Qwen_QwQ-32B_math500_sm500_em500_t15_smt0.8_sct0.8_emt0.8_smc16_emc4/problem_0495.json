            "output": "First, I need to understand the problem. We have a cube, and from each of its 8 corners, we remove a small piece of metal to form a steel sphere. The sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3)πr³. Plugging in the radius, the volume of the sphere is (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic inches.\n\nNext, I need to determine how much metal is removed from the cube to create the sphere. Since each corner of the cube is a right-angled corner, removing a cube of metal from each corner would mean removing a small cube with side length equal to the radius of the sphere, which is 3 inches.\n\nTo find the total volume removed from the cube, I calculate the volume of one of these small cubes and then multiply it by the number of corners, which is 8. The volume of one small cube is 3³ = 27 cubic inches. Therefore, the total volume removed is 8 × 27 = 216 cubic inches.\n\nNow, to find the original volume of the cube before any metal was removed, I add the total volume removed to the volume of the sphere. The original volume of the cube is 216 + 36π cubic inches.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the volume of the cube in cubic inches, so the answer is 216 + 36π cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the steel sphere:**\n   - The sphere has a radius of 3 inches.\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the radius:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (27) = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the volume removed from the cube:**\n   - Each corner of the cube is a small cube with side length equal to the sphere's radius (3 inches).\n   - The volume of one small cube:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{"
