For the first gear, which turns 33 and 1/3 times per minute, one rotation takes 60 divided by 33 and 1/3, which is 1.8 seconds. For the second gear, which turns 45 times per minute, one rotation takes 60 divided by 45, which is 1.(3) seconds, or 1.333... seconds.\n\nNext, I need to find a common time when both gears complete an integer number of rotations, bringing their marks back to pointing north. This means finding a common multiple of their rotation periods. Since 33 and 1/3 is equal to 100/3, the least common multiple (LCM) of 100/3 and 45 can be calculated by converting them to fractions with a common denominator. The LCM of 100 and 45 is 900, so the LCM of 100/3 and 45/1 is 900 divided by 3, which is 300. This means 300 seconds is the next time both marks will align due north.\n</think>\n\nTo determine when the two gears will next have their marks pointing due north simultaneously, follow these steps:\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Rotation Rates**\n- **First Gear:** Turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute.\n- **Second Gear:** Turns \\(45\\) times per minute.\n\n### **Step 2: Convert Rotation Rates to Seconds per Rotation**\n- **First Gear:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Seconds per rotation} = \\frac{60 \\text{ seconds}}{33\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ rotations}} = \\frac{60}{\\frac{100}{3}} = \\frac{60 \\times 3}{100} = 1.8 \\text{ seconds per rotation}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Second Gear:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Seconds per rotation} = \\frac{60 \\text{ seconds}}{45 \\text{ rotations}} = 1.\\overline{3} \\text{ seconds per rotation} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ seconds per rotation}\n  \\]\n\n### **Step 3: Find a Common Rotation Multiple**\nTo align both gears, we need to find a time when both have completed an integer number of rotations"
