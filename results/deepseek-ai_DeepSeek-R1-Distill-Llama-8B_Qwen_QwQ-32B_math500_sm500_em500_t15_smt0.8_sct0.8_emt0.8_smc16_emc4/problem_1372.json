Solving for k gives k < 35/13, approximately 2.69.\n\nSince k must be an integer, the possible values are k = 1 and k = 2.\n\nIf k = 1, then G = 13 and B = 35 - 13 = 22.\nIf k = 2, then G = 26 and B = 35 - 26 = 9.\n\nFinally, I'll check which of these solutions satisfy the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nFor k = 1, G = 13 and B = 22, which means there are more boys than girls, so this doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nFor k = 2, G = 26 and B = 9, which means there are more girls than boys, so this is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys attending the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls = G (a multiple of 13)\n- Number of boys = B\n- More girls than boys are attending the meeting, so \\( G > B \\)\n\n**Step 1: Express the number of girls in terms of a multiple of 13.**\nSince \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13, we can write:\n\\[ G = 13k \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the equation for the total number of students.**\n\\[ G + B = 35 \\]\nSubstituting \\( G \\) from Step 1:\n\\[ 13k + B = 35 \\]\n\\[ B = 35 - 13k \\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the possible values of \\( k \\).**\nSince \\( B \\) must be a"
