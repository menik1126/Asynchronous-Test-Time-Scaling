            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\). Hmm, I think this involves polynomial division. I remember that when you divide one polynomial by another, you get a quotient and possibly a remainder. Since the divisor here is \\( x + 1 \\), which is a linear polynomial, the quotient should be a polynomial of degree one less than the dividend, right? So the dividend is \\( x^6 - 3 \\), which is a degree 6 polynomial, so the quotient should be a degree 5 polynomial. That makes sense because when you multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by a degree 5 polynomial, you get a degree 6 polynomial.\n\nAlright, let me recall how polynomial long division works. It's similar to the long division I did with numbers in elementary school. I need to divide \\( x^6 \\) by \\( x \\) first, which gives me \\( x^5 \\). Then I multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^5 \\) to get \\( x^6 + x^5 \\). Next, I subtract that from the original polynomial:\n\n\\( (x^6 - 3) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 - 3 \\).\n\nSo now, I bring down the next term, but in this case, there's no \\( x^4 \\) term, so I just have \\( -x^5 - 3 \\). I then divide \\( -x^5 \\) by \\( x \\), which gives me \\( -x^4 \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( -x^4 \\) to get \\( -x^5 - x^4 \\). Subtracting that from \\( -x^5 - 3 \\):\n\n\\( (-x^5 - 3) - (-x^5 - x^4) = x^4 - 3 \\).\n\nNext, I divide \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x \\), which is \\( x^3 \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^3 \\) to get \\( x^4 + x^3 \\). Subtracting that from \\( x^4 - 3 \\):\n\n\\( (x^4 - 3) - (x^4 + x^3) = -x^"

Subtracting:\n\n\\( (-x^3 - 3) - (-x^3 - x^2) = x^2 - 3 \\).\n\nNow, divide \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( x \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( x^2 + x \\). Subtracting:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3) - (x^2 + x) = -x - 3 \\).\n\nNext, divide \\( -x \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( -1 \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( -1 \\) to get \\( -x - 1 \\). Subtracting:\n\n\\( (-x - 3) - (-x - 1) = -2 \\).\n\nSo, after all these steps, I have a remainder of \\( -2 \\). That means the division can be expressed as:\n\n\\( x^6 - 3 = (x + 1)(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1) - 2 \\).\n\nBut the question asks for the quotient, which is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\).\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, maybe I should check using the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder when a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is divided by \\( x - a \\) is \\( f(a) \\). In this case, the divisor is \\( x + 1 = x - (-1) \\), so the remainder should be \\( f(-1) \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( f(-1) = (-1)^6 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2 \\). Yes, that matches the remainder I got from the division. So it looks like my quotient is correct.\n\nSo, the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\).\n</think>\n\nThe quotient when \\("
