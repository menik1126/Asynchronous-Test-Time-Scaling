This means the number of blue marbles is now 4x + 5 and the number of yellow marbles is 3x - 3.\n\nSetting up the equation based on the new ratio gives us (4x + 5)/(3x - 3) = 7/3.\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying the equation will help us solve for x. Once we find the value of x, we can determine the initial number of blue marbles by calculating 4x.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let\u2019s define:**\n- Let the number of blue marbles initially be \\( 4x \\).\n- Let the number of yellow marbles initially be \\( 3x \\).\n\n**After adding and removing marbles:**\n- **Blue marbles:** \\( 4x + 5 \\)\n- **Yellow marbles:** \\( 3x - 3 \\)\n\n**Given the new ratio is 7:3:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Cross-multiplying to solve for \\( x \\):**\n\\[\n3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n\\]\n\\[\n12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\\]\n\\[\n12x - 21x = -21 - 15\n\\]\n\\[\n-9x = -36\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\n\n**Calculate the initial number of blue marbles:**\n\\[\n4x = 4 \\times 4 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{16}\\)"
