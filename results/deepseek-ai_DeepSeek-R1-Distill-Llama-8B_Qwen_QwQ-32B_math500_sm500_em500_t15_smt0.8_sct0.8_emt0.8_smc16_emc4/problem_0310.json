These occur where the denominator is zero but the numerator is not zero at those points.\n\nSo, I'll set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 56}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{81}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm 9}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions: \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\), so \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nNext, to find the horizontal asymptote, I'll compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator has a degree of 1, and the denominator has a degree of 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote will be determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nThe leading coefficients are 2 in the numerator and 1 in the denominator. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\), so \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll add \\( a + b + c \\):\n\n\\[\n7 + (-2) + 2 = 7\n\\]\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's analyze the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\) step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Find Vertical Asymptotes\nVertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero (provided the numerator isn't zero at those points).\n\nSet the denominator equal to zero:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\n\\]\nSolve the quadratic equation:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 56}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm 9}{2}\n\\]\nThus, the solutions are:\n\\[\nx = 7 \\quad"
