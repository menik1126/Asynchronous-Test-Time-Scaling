This means finding all divisors \\( n > 1 \\) of the exponent 24.\n\nNext, I'll find all the positive divisors of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\). Using the formula for the number of divisors, which is \\( (3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 8 \\), there are 8 divisors in total.\n\nListing out the divisors, they are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. However, since \\( n > 1 \\), I exclude 1, leaving the possible values of \\( n \\) as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nFinally, I count these values to find that there are 7 positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe need to find all positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n2^{24} = k^n\n\\]\n\nfor some integer \\( k \\). This implies that \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 2: Find All Divisors of 24\nTo find the possible values of \\( n \\), we first determine all the divisors of \\( 24 \\).\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 24**:\n  \\[\n  24 = 2^3 \\times 3^1\n  \\]\n\n- **Number of Divisors**:\n  The formula to find the number of divisors of a number is:\n  \\[\n  (e_"
