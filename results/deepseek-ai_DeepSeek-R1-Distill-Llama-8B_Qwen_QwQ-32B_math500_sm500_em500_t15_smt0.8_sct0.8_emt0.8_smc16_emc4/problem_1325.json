I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the rectangle. As the Asymptote code shows, it's drawn with points A, B, C, D. O is the center, so it should be the intersection point of the diagonals AC and BD. The rectangle has sides AB and AD in a ratio k:1. So, if I let AB = k and AD = 1, then the rectangle's dimensions are determined by this ratio. Alternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates to make it easier.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system with O at the origin (0,0). Then, the rectangle's vertices can be defined relative to the center. Since O is the center, each vertex will be at a distance equal to half the diagonal from O. But first, I need to find the lengths of the sides. Let's denote AB = k and AD = 1. So, AB is the length of the top and bottom sides, and AD is the width of the left and right sides.\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB and CD are both length k, and AD and BC are both length 1. So, the rectangle isn't necessarily a square unless k = 1, which is an interesting case to consider. So, the rectangle is longer in the AB direction if k > 1, and shorter in that direction if k < 1.\n\nLet me correct the coordinate system. If O is the center, then the coordinates of the vertices can be determined as follows:\n\n- Point A: (-k/2, 1/2)\n- Point B: (k/2, 1/2)\n- Point C: (k/2, -1/2)\n- Point D: (-k/2, -1/2)\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think. If AB is length k, then the distance from A to B is k. Since AB is the top side, and the center is O at (0,0), then the top side is at y = 1"

That way, AD, the vertical side from A to D, would be vertical with length 1. Wait, maybe I got the sides mixed up. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should let the coordinates of the rectangle be such that the length AB is horizontal, so the length of the horizontal sides is AB, and the vertical sides are AD. So, if AB is the horizontal length, then the coordinates would be:\n\n- O is the center, so coordinates (0,0).\n- Let the rectangle extend from (-a, -b) to (a, b), so that the length AB (horizontal) is 2a, and the vertical length AD (vertical) is 2b.\n\nThen the ratio AB/AD is (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. Therefore, a = k*b. Let me choose coordinates accordingly. Let me let AD be the vertical side, so AD = 2b. Therefore, if I let b = 1, then AD = 2, but that might complicate things. Maybe I can set the coordinates such that the center is at (0,0), and the rectangle has vertices at (k/2, 1/2), (-k/2, 1/2), etc. That way, the horizontal length AB is k, and the vertical length AD is 1. Wait, yes, that might be better.\n\nSo, let me define the rectangle with vertices at:\n\n- A: (-k/2, -1/2)\n- B: (k/2, -1/2)\nWait, no. Wait. Let me make sure. Let me consider the rectangle with AB as the bottom side, going from left to right. Wait, in the Asymptote code, the coordinates given are like (-250,100) for A, which is labeled NW, so that would be top-left. Wait, the Asymptote code's coordinates are:\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code:\n\ndraw((-250,100)--(250,100)--(250,-100)--(-250,-100)--cycle);\n\n"

But in our problem, the ratio AB/AD is k. So, perhaps the Asymptote code is just an example, but for the problem, we can assign the rectangle dimensions accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to define a coordinate system with O at (0,0) and the rectangle centered there, with sides AB = k and AD = 1 as given. So, the rectangle extends from (-k/2, -1/2) to (k/2, 1/2), right? So, the four vertices would be at (k/2, 1/2), (-k/2, 1/2), (-k/2, -1/2), and (k/2, -1/2). So, O is at (0,0).\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability that a randomly selected point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices: A, B, C, D.\n\nSo, the probability would be the area where the point is closer to O than to any vertex, divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, let me first compute the total area of the rectangle. Since AB = k and AD = 1, the area is AB * AD = k * 1 = k. So, total area is k.\n\nNext, I need to find the area where the point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices.\n\nThis region is the set of points (x, y) such that the distance from (x,y) to O is less than the distance to A, B, C, D.\n\nSo, let's write down the inequalities.\n\nDistance to O: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nDistance to A: sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\nDistance to B: sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\nDistance to C: sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 )\n\nDistance to D: sqrt( (x + k"
