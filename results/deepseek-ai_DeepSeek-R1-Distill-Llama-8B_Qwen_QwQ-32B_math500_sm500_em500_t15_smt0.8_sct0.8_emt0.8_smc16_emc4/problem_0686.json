The constraints are:\n- \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n- \\( y \\geq 5 \\)\n\nTo find the possible values of \\( x \\), we can express the total number of cards as:\n\\[\nx \\times y = 54\n\\]\nSince \\( x \\) must be an integer, \\( y \\) must also be a divisor of **54**. Additionally, \\( y \\) must be at least **5**. Let's list the divisors of **54** and identify those that satisfy the condition \\( y \\geq 5 \\):\n\n1. **Divisors of 54:**\n   \\[\n   1,\\ 2,\\ 3,\\ 6,\\ 9,\\ 18,\\ 27,\\ 54\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify valid \\( y \\) values (\\( y \\geq 5 \\)):**\n   \\[\n   6,\\ 9,\\ 18,\\ 27,\\ 54\n   \\]\n   \n   However, since \\( x \\) must be at least **2**, not all these \\( y \\) values are valid. Specifically, \\( y \\) must satisfy \\( y \\leq \\frac{54}{2} = 27 \\) because if \\( y \\) exceeds **27**, \\( x \\) would be less than"
