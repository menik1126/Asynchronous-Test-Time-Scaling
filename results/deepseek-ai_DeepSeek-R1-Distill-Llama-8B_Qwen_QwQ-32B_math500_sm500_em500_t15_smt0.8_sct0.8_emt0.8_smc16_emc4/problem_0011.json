Let me write down the given information first to get a clear picture.\n\nWe have a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so it should look something like \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\), right? I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, the problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). Similarly, when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Hmm, okay, so both divisions by quadratic polynomials give related remainders. That makes me think about the Remainder Theorem or maybe the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlso, we know that \\( P(0) = 5 \\). That's a good starting point because evaluating a polynomial at 0 gives the constant term. So since \\( P(0) = 5 \\), the constant term \\( c \\) is 5. So, \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 5 \\).\n\nNow, let's think about the division by quadratics. When you divide a polynomial by a quadratic, the remainder should be linear, right? So both remainders \\( R(x) \\) and \\( 2R(x) \\) must be linear polynomials. Let me denote \\( R(x) = mx + n \\) as the remainder when dividing by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\). Then, when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder should be \\( 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n \\).\n\nWait, the problem says the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\) when divided by the second quadratic. So, if \\( R(x) \\) is linear, then \\( 2R(x) \\) is still linear, just scaled by 2. That makes sense.\n\nNow, for division by a quadratic, we can express \\( P(x) \\) as:\n\\( P(x) = ("

Since \\( P(x) \\) is degree 3, the quotients \\( Q_1 \\) and \\( Q_2 \\) must be linear polynomials (since 3 - 2 = 1). But maybe I don't need to focus on the quotients directly.\n\nAlternatively, since the remainder when divided by a quadratic is linear, we can use the Remainder Factor Theorem here. The remainder \\( R(x) \\) when divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) must satisfy \\( R(1) = P(1) \\) and \\( R(4) = P(4) \\). Similarly, the remainder \\( 2R(x) \\) when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\) must satisfy \\( 2R(2) = P(2) \\) and \\( 2R(3) = P(3) \\).\n\nAh, that seems useful. Let me write that down:\n\n1. \\( R(1) = P(1) \\)\n2. \\( R(4) = P(4) \\)\n3. \\( 2R(2) = P(2) \\)\n4. \\( 2R(3) = P(3) \\)\n\nSince \\( R(x) \\) is linear, let me write \\( R(x) = mx + n \\).
