            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a monic cubic polynomial P(x). Let me break it down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of polynomial remainders and divisors.\n\nFirst, the problem says P(x) is monic of degree 3. Monic means the leading coefficient is 1, so P(x) looks like x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c. Cool, that part makes sense.\n\nNext, it mentions that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), it leaves a remainder R(x). Then, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we're given that P(0) = 5, and we need to find P(5). \n\nLet me recall the Remainder Theorem. If you divide a polynomial P(x) by (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But here, we're dividing by quadratic polynomials, so the remainder should be linear, right? So R(x) must be of the form mx + n.\n\nSo, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is a quadratic, the remainder R(x) can be written using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or by using the fact that R(x) is linear. So, R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So, we can write 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3).\n\nHmm, okay, so let me write down these equations.\n\nSince R(x) is linear, let's denote R(x) = kx + m, where k and m are constants to be determined.\n\nThen, from P(x) divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Therefore:\n\nP(1) = R(1) = k*1 + m = k + m\n\nP(4) = R(4) = 4k + m\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so:\n\nP(2"

Since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, we can also express P(x) in terms of its coefficients. Let me write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\nWe know that P(0) = c = 5, so c = 5. That's one variable down.\n\nNow, let's write equations for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4):\n\n1. P(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = (1 + a + b + 5) = (a + b + 6) = k + m\n\n2. P(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = (4a + 2b + 13) = 4k + 2m\n\n3. P(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 = (9a + 3b + 32) = 6k + 2m\n\n4. P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = (16a + 4b + 69) = 4k + m\n\nSo now, we have four equations:\n\nEquation 1: a + b + 6 = k + m\n\nEquation 2: 4a + 2b + 13 = 4k + 2m\n\nEquation 3: 9a + 3b + 32 = 6k + 2m\n\nEquation 4: 16a + 4b + 69 = 4k + m\n\nHmm, so four equations with four variables: a, b, k, m. Let me see how to solve these.\n\nFirst, maybe express k and m in terms of a and b from equations 1 and 4, then substitute into equations 2 and 3?\n\n"
