Let G represent the number of girls and B represent the number of boys attending the math club meeting.\n\nNext, I know that the total number of students is 35. This gives me the equation:\nG + B = 35\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. So, G must be one of the multiples of 13 that is less than or equal to 35. The possible values for G are 13, 26, and 39. However, since the total number of students is 35, G can't be 39 because that would exceed the total. So, G can only be 13 or 26.\n\nFurthermore, there are more girls than boys at the meeting, which means G must be greater than B. This is an important condition to narrow down the possible values.\n\nI'll start by considering G = 13. Plugging this into the total equation:\n13 + B = 35\nThis gives:\nB = 22\n\nNow, I'll consider G = 26:\n26 + B = 35\nThis gives:\nB = 9\n\nSince there must be more girls than boys, let's evaluate both scenarios:\n- If G = 13, then B = 22. However, 13 is less than 22, which means there are more boys than girls, contradicting the condition.\n- If G = 26, then B = 9. Here, 26 is greater than 9, which satisfies the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is B = 9.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys.\n\n**Step 1:** Express the total number of students in terms of girls and boys.\n\n\\[\nG + B = 35 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Identify possible values for G.\n\nSince G is a multiple of 13 and must be less than or equal to 35:\n\n\\[\nG = 13 \\times k \\quad \\text{where} \\quad k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nPossible values for \\( k \\) that satisfy \\( 13k"
