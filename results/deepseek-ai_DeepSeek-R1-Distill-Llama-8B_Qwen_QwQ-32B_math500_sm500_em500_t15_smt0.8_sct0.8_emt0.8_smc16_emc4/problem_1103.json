Hmm, recursive functions can sometimes be tricky because you have to figure out the pattern or maybe even find a closed-form formula. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the definition of the function f(i, j) to make sure I have it right. The function is defined for all non-negative integers i and j, where j is between 0 and 4. The function depends on i and j in a recursive way, so I need to parse the three cases given.\n\nCase 1: If i is 0 and j is between 0 and 4, then f(0, j) is just the remainder when j+1 is divided by 5. So, f(0, j) = mod_5(j + 1). That seems straightforward. For example, if j=0, f(0, 0) = mod_5(1) = 1; if j=1, f(0,1)=2; and so on up to j=4, which would be 5 mod 5 = 0.\n\nCase 2: If i is at least 1 and j is 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1). So, whenever the second argument is 0, we reduce the first argument by 1 and set j to 1. This is like moving down the recursion until we hit i=0.\n\nCase 3: If i is at least 1 and j is between 1 and 4, then f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). That's a bit more complex. It seems like we're nesting the function calls. So, to compute f(i, j), we need to first compute f(i, j - 1), then use that result as the new j in f(i - 1, something).\n\nOkay, so the function is defined recursively, and I need to compute f(2015, 2). 2015 is a pretty large number, so computing it directly step by step would be impractical. I need to find a pattern or maybe a cycle in the function's behavior.\n\nLet me start by computing some small values of f(i,"
