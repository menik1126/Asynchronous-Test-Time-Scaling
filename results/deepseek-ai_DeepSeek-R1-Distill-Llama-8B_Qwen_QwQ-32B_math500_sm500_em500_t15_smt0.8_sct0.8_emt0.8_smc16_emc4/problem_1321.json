Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the rectangle. We have rectangle \\(ABCD\\) with center \\(O\\). The ratio of \\(AB\\) to \\(AD\\) is \\(k\\), so if I let \\(AB = k\\) times some unit length, then \\(AD\\) would be the unit length. But maybe it's easier to assign specific lengths to make the math less abstract. Let me assume that the rectangle has a width of \\(2\\) units and a height of \\(1\\) unit. Wait, no, since \\(AB/AD = k\\), maybe I should define \\(AB = k\\) and \\(AD = 1\\) so that the ratio is directly \\(k\\). Then, the rectangle would be a scaled version depending on the value of \\(k\\). Hmm, but actually, since the problem doesn't specify the dimensions, the probability should be independent of the actual size, right? So maybe I can assume the rectangle is a square for simplicity? Wait, but if it's a square, then \\(k = 1\\), which might not cover all cases. Maybe it's better to keep it as a rectangle with sides \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) where \\(a/b = k\\). So, let me define the rectangle with length \\(AB = a\\) and width \\(AD = b\\) such that \\(a/b = k\\), so \\(a = k b\\). Then, the area of the rectangle would be \\(a \\times b = k b^2\\).\n\nNow, the center \\(O\\) is the intersection point of the diagonals. So, the coordinates of \\(O\\) would be at the midpoint of the rectangle. If I place the rectangle on a coordinate system with \\(O\\) at (0,0), then the rectangle's vertices would be at \\((-a/2, b/2)\\), \\((a/2, b/2)\\), \\((a/2, -b/2)\\), and \\((-a/2, -b/2)\\). Hmm, that might be useful.\n\nWait, but I just realized, if \\(a = k b\\), then the coordinates of the vertices become \\((-(k b)/2, b/"

Let me set coordinates such that the center \\(O\\) is (0,0), so the rectangle extends from \\(x = -a/2\\) to \\(x = a/2\\), and \\(y = -b/2\\) to \\(y = b/2\\). That should make calculations symmetric.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability that a randomly selected point is closer to \\(O\\) than to any of the vertices. So, for any point inside the rectangle, we want the set of points where the distance to \\(O\\) is less than the distance to each vertex.\n\nTo compute this probability, I need to determine the area of the region (let's call it Region R) where all points are closer to \\(O\\) than to any vertex, and then divide that by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, let me figure out the conditions for a point \\((x,y)\\) to be closer to \\(O\\) than to any vertex. Let's denote the four vertices as \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\). Since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe the conditions will have some symmetry too.\n\nLet me first write the coordinates of the four vertices:\n\n- \\(A\\) is at \\((-a/2, b/2)\\)\n- \\(B\\) is at \\((a/2, b/2)\\)\n- \\(C\\) is at \\((a/2, -b/2)\\)\n- \\(D\\) is at \\((-a/2, -b/2)\\)\n  \nThe center \\(O\\) is at (0,0).\n\nFor a point \\(P(x,y)\\), the distance squared to \\(O\\) is \\(x^2 + y^2\\).\n\nThe distance squared to vertex \\(A\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(x + a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, distance squared to \\(B\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(x - a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2\n\\]\n\nTo \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n(x - a/2)^2 + (y + b/2)^2\n\\]\n\nTo \\(D\\):\n\n\\[\n(x + a/2)^"

Therefore, for each vertex, we have a line that divides the plane into two regions: one closer to O, and one closer to the vertex.

Alternatively, perhaps in the general case, when I set AB =a, AD = b, and a/b =k, in the square case, a =b, so the probability is (2a\u00b2)^2 / (8a\u00b2 ) = 16 a^4 / 8 a\u00b2 = 2 a\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right.
