Then, I multiply the second term by 1 to get the third term, which remains 1. Next, I add 2 to the third term to get the fourth term, which is 3. Multiplying the fourth term by 2 gives the fifth term as 6. Adding 3 to the fifth term results in 9 for the sixth term. Multiplying 9 by 3 gives 27 for the seventh term.\n\nContinuing this pattern, I'll alternate between adding and multiplying by the next integer. This process will help me identify the sequence until I find the first term that exceeds 125.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to find the first term greater than 125.\n\n1. **First Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_2 = a_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_3 = a_2 \\times 1 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_4 = a_3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\n   \\]\n\n5. **Fifth Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_5 = a_4 \\times 2 = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n   \\]\n\n6. **Sixth Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_6 = a_5 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n7. **Seventh Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_7 = a_6 \\times 3 = 9 \\times 3 = 27\n   \\]\n\n8. **Eighth Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_8 = a_7 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31\n   \\]\n\n9. **Ninth Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_9 = a_8 \\times 4 = 31 \\times 4 = 124\n   \\]\n\n10. **"

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
