I'll repeat this process for the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades using their respective percentages. \n\nAfter obtaining the actual numbers of male and female bus riders for each grade, I'll calculate the ratio of male to female bus riders. Specifically, I'll determine how many times the number of male bus riders is of the number of female bus riders by dividing the male count by the female count for each grade. \n\nOnce I have the ratio, I'll compare this value to 135% to see how close it is. The grade where the ratio is closest to 1.35 will be the answer. \n\nFinally, I'll summarize the results for each grade, showing the calculated numbers, the ratio, and how close each ratio is to 135%. This will help identify which grade meets the criterion.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to \\(135\\%\\) of the number of female bus riders, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Data:**\n   - Total students surveyed in each grade: **300 males and 300 females**.\n   - The percentages of males and females who ride the bus are provided for each grade.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Bus Riders Per Grade:**\n   - For each grade, compute the number of male and female bus riders using the given percentages.\n   - **Formula:** \n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of Bus Riders} = \\text{Total Students} \\times \\text{Percentage}\n     \\]\n     Since there are 300 males and 300 females in each grade:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Male Bus Riders} = 300 \\times \\text{Percentage of Males}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Female Bus Riders} = 300 \\times \\text{Percentage of Females}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the"
