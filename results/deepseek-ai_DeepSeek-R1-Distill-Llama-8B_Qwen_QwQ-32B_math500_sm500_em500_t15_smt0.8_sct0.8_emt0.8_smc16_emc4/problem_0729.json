            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms, and I need to find the value of x. Hmm, let's see. The problem says two things: first, that log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and second, that log base y of 5x equals 2. Alright, I need to figure out x. \n\nLet me write down both equations separately to make it clearer. The first equation is log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2. The second equation is log_y(5x) = 2. I think I should start by simplifying the first equation since it's a sum of two logarithms with the same base. There's a logarithm property that says log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(ac), right? So applying that here, the first equation becomes log\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nWait, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, so that simplifies to x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. So the first equation now is log\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2. That means that 6\u00b2 equals x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 because log base 6 of something equals 2 implies that something is 6\u00b2, which is 36. So x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36. Okay, that's equation one simplified.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Again, using logarithm properties, log_y(z) = 2 means that y\u00b2 = z, where z is 5x. So that gives me y\u00b2 = 5x. That seems helpful because I can express y in terms of x or vice versa. Let's see, maybe I can express y in terms of x from this equation and substitute it into the first equation.\n\nFrom y\u00b2 = 5x, I can solve for y by taking the square root of both sides. So y = sqrt(5x). Wait, but I have to consider the positive root only because logarithms are defined only for positive numbers. So y is positive. Okay, so y = sqrt(5x). \n\nNow, let's go back to the first equation: x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36. Since y\u00b2 is"

            "output": " 5x, substituting that in gives x\u00b2 - 5x = 36. That simplifies to x\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = 0. Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let me try to factor this quadratic. \n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6. Let's see, if I take 4 and -9, their product is -36 and their sum is -5. Yes! So, the quadratic factors as (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are x = -4 or x = 9. \n\nBut wait, x has to be a positive number because in the original equations, we have logarithms of (x - y) and (x + y). The arguments of logarithms must be positive. So x - y > 0 and x + y > 0. Since x + y is definitely positive if x is positive, but x - y must also be positive. Let's check the possible solutions.\n\nFirst, x = -4. If x is negative, then y\u00b2 = 5*(-4) = -20, which is impossible because y\u00b2 can't be negative. So x = -4 is invalid. Therefore, the only possible solution is x = 9. Let me verify this.\n\nIf x = 9, then y\u00b2 = 5*9 = 45, so y = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5). Let me check the first equation. \n\nFirst, compute x - y = 9 - 3\u221a5 and x + y = 9 + 3\u221a5. Their product is (9)^2 - (3\u221a5)^2 = 81 - (9*5) = 81 - 45 = 36. So log\u2086(36) = 2 because 6^2 = 36. That checks out. \n\nNow, check the second equation: log_y(5x) = log_{3\u221a5}(45). Let's see, since y = 3\u221a5, then y squared is"

            "output": " (3\u221a5)^2 = 9*5 = 45. So y\u00b2 = 45. But 5x is also 5*9 = 45. So log_y(45) = log_{3\u221a5}(45) = 2 because (3\u221a5)^2 = 45. Yep, that works out.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me re-calculate the product (x - y)(x + y) when x = 9 and y = 3\u221a5. That would be (9 - 3\u221a5)(9 + 3\u221a5) = 9^2 - (3\u221a5)^2 = 81 - (9*5) = 81 - 45 = 36. So log\u2086(36) is indeed 2 because 6^2 = 36. Perfect.\n\nAnd for the second equation, since y = 3\u221a5, y\u00b2 = (3\u221a5)^2 = 9*5 = 45, which equals 5x because 5*9=45. So log_{y}(45) is log_{3\u221a5}(45) = 2 because y^2 = 45. So both equations are satisfied.\n\nI think that's solid. So x is 9. Let me just recap everything I did to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake. \n\n1. Started with the first equation, applied logarithm addition to combine the logs, leading to x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n2. Moved to the second equation and used the definition of logarithms to find that y\u00b2 = 5x.\n3. Substituted y\u00b2 into the first equation, leading to a quadratic in x, which factored to (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0, giving x = 9 and x = -4.\n4. Discarded x = -4 because it leads to a negative y\u00b2, which isn't possible.\n5. Checked x = 9 by calculating y and verifying both original equations hold true.\n\nEverything seems to check out. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that x is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the first equation using logarithm properties:\n\n1. **First Equation Simplification**:\n   \\[\n  "
