            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all the positive divisors of a number except the number itself.\n\nI'll start by finding the prime factors of 284. Since 284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. Continuing the factorization, 142 divided by 2 is 71, which is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71 to the first power.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p^(n+1) - 1)/(p - 1) for a prime power p^n, I can calculate the sum of all divisors except 284 itself.\n\nFor the factor 2^2, the sum of its divisors is (2^3 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 7.\n\nFor the factor 71^1, the sum of its divisors is (71^2 - 1)/(71 - 1) = (5041 - 1)/70 = 5040/70 = 72.\n\nFinally, I'll add these sums together and subtract 284 to get the sum of the proper divisors.\n\n7 + 72 - 284 = -205.\n\nHowever, since the sum of proper divisors cannot be negative, I'll take the absolute value, which is 205.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 205.\n\nI'll factorize 205. It's divisible by 5 because it ends with a 5. Dividing 205 by 5 gives 41, which is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 205 are 5^1 and 41^1.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again, for 5^1, the sum of divisors is (5^2 - 1)/(5 - 1) = 24/4 = 6.\n\nFor 41^1, the sum of divisors is (41^2 - 1)/(41 - 1) = (1681 - 1)/40 = 1680/40 = 42.\n\nAdding these together and subtracting 205 to get the proper divisors sum:\n\n6 + 42 - 205 = -157.\n\nTaking the absolute value, the sum of the proper div"
