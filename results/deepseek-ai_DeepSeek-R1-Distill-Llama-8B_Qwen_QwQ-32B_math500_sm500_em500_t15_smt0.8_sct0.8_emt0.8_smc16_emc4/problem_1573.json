            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of (5 divided by sqrt(80) plus sqrt(845)/9 plus sqrt(45), all of that divided by sqrt(5)). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression to make sure I have it right:\n\n\u221a[(5/\u221a80 + \u221a845/9 + \u221a45) / \u221a5]\n\nAlright, so the main goal is to simplify the entire fraction inside the square root. Maybe I should simplify each term inside the numerator first before dealing with the denominator and then the square root.\n\nLet's look at each term in the numerator: 5/\u221a80, \u221a845/9, and \u221a45.\n\nStarting with 5/\u221a80. I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually preferred, so I should rationalize that. To do that, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \u221a80 to get rid of the square root in the denominator.\n\nSo, 5/\u221a80 * \u221a80/\u221a80 = (5\u221a80)/80.\n\nNow, let's simplify \u221a80. Breaking it down, 80 is 16*5, and 16 is a perfect square. So \u221a80 = \u221a(16*5) = \u221a16 * \u221a5 = 4\u221a5.\n\nSubstituting that back, we have (5*4\u221a5)/80 = (20\u221a5)/80. Simplifying 20/80 gives 1/4, so it's (1\u221a5)/4, which is \u221a5/4.\n\nAlright, so 5/\u221a80 simplifies to \u221a5/4.\n\nNext term: \u221a845/9. Let me try to simplify \u221a845. Hmm, 845, let's see. Is it divisible by any squares? Let's factor it:\n\n845 \u00f7 5 = 169. Oh, 169 is 13 squared, so 845 = 5 * 13\u00b2. Therefore, \u221a845 = \u221a(5 * 13\u00b2) = \u221a(13\u00b2) * \u221a5 = 13\u221a5.\n\nSo, \u221a845/9 is (13\u221a5)/9.\n\nOkay, that one is simplified as (13\u221a5)/9.\n\nThird term: \u221a45. Let me simplify that. 45 is 9*5, so \u221a"

The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) would be 36.\n\nSo, let's convert each fraction to have 36 as the denominator.\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\n3/1 = 108/36.\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169.\n\nSo, 1/4 + 13/9 + 3 = 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator simplifies to \u221a5 * 169/36 = (169\u221a5)/36.\n\nNow, the entire expression inside the square root is this numerator divided by \u221a5:\n\n[(169\u221a5)/36] / \u221a5.\n\nWhen I divide by \u221a5, it's the same as multiplying by 1/\u221a5:\n\n(169\u221a5)/36 * 1/\u221a5.\n\nThe \u221a5 in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out, leaving:\n\n169/36.\n\nSo now, I have \u221a(169/36). Let me compute that.\n\n\u221a(169/36) is equal to \u221a169 divided by \u221a36.\n\n\u221a169 is 13, and \u221a36 is 6.\n\nSo, \u221a(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything because that seems straightforward, but I want to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again, the initial expression is the square root of (5/\u221a80 + \u221a845/9 + \u221a45) divided by \u221a5.\n\nI simplified each term:\n\n5/\u221a80 became \u221a5/4,\n\n\u221a845 became 13\u221a5, so over 9 is (13\u221a5)/"
