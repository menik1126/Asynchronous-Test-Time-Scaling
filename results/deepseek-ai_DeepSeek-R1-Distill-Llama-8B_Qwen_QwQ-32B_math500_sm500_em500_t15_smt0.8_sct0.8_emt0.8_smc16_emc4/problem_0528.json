Since Yann and Camille refuse to order the same dish, each dish can be ordered by either Yann or Camille, but not both.\n\nI will start by calculating the total number of possible orders without any restrictions. For each dish, there are 2 choices: Yann orders it or Camille orders it. With 10 dishes, this results in 2 multiplied by itself 10 times, which is 2 to the power of 10, or 1024 possible orders.\n\nHowever, this count includes scenarios where Yann and Camille might order the same dish. To exclude these cases, I will subtract the number of orders where they both choose the same dish. For each dish, there is exactly 1 scenario where both Yann and Camille order it. Since there are 10 dishes, this gives 10 scenarios to subtract.\n\nFinally, I will subtract the 10 identical orders from the total possible orders, resulting in 1024 minus 10, which equals 1014.\n\nTherefore, there are 1014 different combinations of meals that Yann and Camille can order without both selecting the same dish.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll calculate the number of possible meal combinations Yann and Camille can order, considering that they refuse to order the same dish. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - There are **10 dishes** available.\n   - **Yann** and **Camille** each order **one dish**.\n   - They do not want to order the **same dish**.\n   - The order matters (e.g., Yann orders Chicken and Camille orders Fish is different from Yann ordering Fish and Camille ordering Chicken).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Possible Orders Without Restrictions:**\n   - For each dish, there are **2 choices**:\n     - Either **Yann** orders it.\n     - Or **Camille** orders it.\n   - For **10 dishes**, the total number of possible orders is:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times \\ldots \\times 2 \\quad (\\text{10 times}) = 2^{10} = 1024\n    "

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
