            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here that I need to solve. It says:\n\nIf log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then find x.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I should handle the two equations separately first and then see if I can connect them somehow. \n\nStarting with the first equation: log base 6 of (x - y) + log base 6 of (x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying the arguments. So, log6((x - y)(x + y)) = 2. \n\nWait, that simplifies to log6((x - y)(x + y)) = 2. Now, (x - y)(x + y) is x squared minus y squared, so log6(x² - y²) = 2. To get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. So, 6 raised to the power of 2 equals x² - y². That gives me 36 = x² - y². \n\nAlright, so equation one simplifies to x² - y² = 36. I'll write that down as equation (1).\n\nNow moving on to the second equation: log base y of 5x equals 2. Again, I can convert this logarithmic equation to its exponential form. So, y² = 5x. That's straightforward. I'll note that as equation (2): y² = 5x.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1. x² - y² = 36\n2. y² = 5x\n\nMaybe I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to solve for x. Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation (2), y² is equal to 5x. So, in equation (1), wherever I see y², I can replace it with 5x. That gives me x² - 5x = 36.\n\nSo, x² - 5x - 36 = 0. Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let me try to factor this. I need two numbers that multiply to -36 and add to -5. Let's think:"

            "output": " factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Hmm, looking for a pair that adds to -5. Let's see: 4 and -9. 4 * (-9) = -36, and 4 + (-9) = -5. Perfect!\n\nSo, factoring the quadratic: (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are x = -4 or x = 9.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if these solutions make sense in the original logarithmic equations because log functions have domain restrictions. Specifically, both (x - y) and (x + y) must be positive.\n\nFrom equation (2): y² = 5x, so y = sqrt(5x) or y = -sqrt(5x). But since we're dealing with log base y, y must be positive and not equal to 1. So y > 0, which implies 5x > 0, so x > 0. Therefore, x must be positive. That means x = -4 is invalid because it's negative. So we can discard x = -4.\n\nSo the only possible solution is x = 9.\n\nLet me verify this solution to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFrom equation (2): y² = 5x, so if x = 9, y² = 45. Therefore, y = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5) or y = -3*sqrt(5). But since y is the base of a logarithm, it must be positive, so y = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, let's check equation (1): x² - y² = 36. Plugging in x = 9 and y² = 45. So, 9² - 45 = 81 - 45 = 36. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAdditionally, let's check the original logarithmic equations to ensure that all the arguments are positive.\n\nFor the first equation: log6(x - y) + log6(x + y) = 2. We've established that x = 9 and y is positive, so x - y = 9 - 3√5. Since 3√5 is approximately 6.7, 9 - 6"

            "output": ".7 is about 2.3, which is positive. Similarly, x + y is 9 + 6.7 ≈ 15.7, which is also positive. So both arguments are valid.\n\nNow, check the second equation: log base y of 5x = 2. Since y is 3√5, let's see if (3√5)^2 equals 5x. (3√5)^2 = 9*5 = 45. And 5x = 5*9 = 45. So that works too.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the first equation again using the original logs. \n\nlog6(x - y) + log6(x + y) = log6[(x - y)(x + y)] = log6(x² - y²). Since x² - y² is 36, log6(36) = log6(6^2) = 2. Which matches the given equation. Perfect.\n\nSo all the conditions are satisfied with x = 9. Therefore, the solution is x = 9.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. The key was remembering the logarithm properties and checking the domain restrictions to eliminate the negative solution. Also, substituting correctly and verifying the answer in the original equations is important to ensure there were no algebraic errors.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nStarting with the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\).
