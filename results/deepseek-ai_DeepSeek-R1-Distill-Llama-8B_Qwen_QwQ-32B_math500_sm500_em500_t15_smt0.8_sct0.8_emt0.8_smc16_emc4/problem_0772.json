Finally, find \\( a + b \\). \n\nAlright, let's break this down. The distance from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) is given by the distance formula: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Since the point lies on the given graph, \\( y \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( x \\). So, substitute \\( y \\) into the distance formula.\n\nFirst, let me write down the function again:\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\]\nSo, the distance squared from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) on the graph is:\n\\[ D = x^2 + y^2 \\]\nSubstituting \\( y \\) into this, we get:\n\\[ D = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\]\nLet me simplify this step by step.\n\nFirst, square \\( y \\):\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 (x^2 - 3)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\]\nSo, now the distance squared is:\n\\[ D = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\]\nTo find the minimum distance, I can minimize \\( D \\) with respect to \\( x \\). Since the square root function is increasing, the minimum of \\( D \\) will correspond to the minimum distance.\n\nLet me expand \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 \\):\n\\[ (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + "
