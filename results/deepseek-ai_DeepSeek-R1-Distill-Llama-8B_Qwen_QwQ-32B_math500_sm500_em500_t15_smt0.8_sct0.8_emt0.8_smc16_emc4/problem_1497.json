The prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\nNext, I'll list the prime numbers less than 30: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNow, I'll determine which of these prime numbers are odd. Since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, the only even prime number less than 30 is 2.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of the set of prime numbers less than 30 and the set of odd numbers greater than zero includes all prime numbers except for 2.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Set of Prime Numbers Less Than 30**\nPrime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n- 2\n- 3\n- 5\n- 7\n- 11\n- 13\n- 17\n- 19\n- 23\n- 29\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Set of Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero**\nOdd numbers greater than zero are all integers greater than 1 that are not divisible by 2. The set of odd numbers greater than zero is infinite, but for the purpose of intersection, we need to consider the primes.\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Intersection of Both Sets**\nThe intersection consists of all numbers that are both prime (as listed above) and odd. Since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, the only even prime in the list is 2. Therefore, the intersection excludes 2.\n\n**Primes less than 30 (excluding 2):**\n- 3\n- 5\n- 7\n- 11\n- 13\n- 17\n- 19\n- 23\n- 29\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThere are **9** elements in the intersection of the sets.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
