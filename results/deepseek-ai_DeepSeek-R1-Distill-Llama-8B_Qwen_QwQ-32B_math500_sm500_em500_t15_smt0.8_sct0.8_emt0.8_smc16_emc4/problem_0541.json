Since they refuse to order the same dish, I need to ensure that their choices are distinct.\n\nTo calculate the number of valid combinations, I can use the concept of permutations, which accounts for the different orders of selection.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible meal combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, resulting in 90 different combinations.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order without choosing the same dish. Since **each** of them orders **one** dish, and the order matters (i.e., Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken), we can use the concept of **permutations**.\n\n1. **Total Dishes:** There are **10** different dishes on the menu.\n\n2. **First Person (Yann):** Yann has **10** possible choices for his dish.\n\n3. **Second Person (Camille):** After Yann has chosen his dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish. Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining choices.\n\n4. **Total Combinations:** Multiply the number of choices for both Yann and Camille.\n   \n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of different meal combinations they can order is \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."
