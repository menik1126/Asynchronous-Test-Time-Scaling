The \\(\\frac{21}{100}\\) part will be calculated as 0.21, and the \\(\\frac{1}{1}\\) part equals 1.\n\nFinally, I'll add these two results together to obtain the final terminating decimal, which is 1.21.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Denominator:**\n   \n   The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\). To make it compatible with the standard form for terminating decimals, we can factor it to include powers of 10.\n\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 5^5 = (2 \\cdot 5)^2 \\cdot 5^5 = 10^2 \\cdot 5^5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rewrite the Fraction:**\n   \n   Now, rewrite the fraction by separating the factors:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21}{10^2 \\cdot 5^5} = \\frac{21}{100 \\cdot 5^5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   \n   Since \\(5^5 = 3125\\), we can rewrite the fraction as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{100 \\cdot 3125} = \\frac{21}{312500}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   \n   Convert \\(\\frac{21}{312500}\\) to a decimal by dividing 21 by 312500.\n\n   \\[\n"
