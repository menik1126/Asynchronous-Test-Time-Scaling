Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the domain of a function includes all the real numbers for which the function is defined. For square root functions, the expression inside the square root, which is called the radicand, must be non-negative. That means (x - 3)\u00b2 - (x - 8)\u00b2 \u2265 0. So, my first task is to solve this inequality.\n\nAlright, let me write that down:\n\n(x - 3)\u00b2 - (x - 8)\u00b2 \u2265 0.\n\nHmm, this looks like a difference of squares. Remember, the difference of squares formula is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can factor this expression to make it easier to solve.\n\nLet me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). So, applying the difference of squares formula:\n\n[(x - 3) - (x - 8)] * [(x - 3) + (x - 8)] \u2265 0.\n\nLet me simplify each bracket.\n\nFirst bracket: (x - 3) - (x - 8) = x - 3 - x + 8 = (x - x) + (-3 + 8) = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nSecond bracket: (x - 3) + (x - 8) = x - 3 + x - 8 = (x + x) + (-3 - 8) = 2x - 11.\n\nSo now the inequality becomes 5 * (2x - 11) \u2265 0.\n\nHmm, okay, so 5*(2x - 11) \u2265 0. Since 5 is a positive number, multiplying it by something won't change the inequality sign. So effectively, 2x - 11 \u2265 0.\n\nSolving for x, I get:\n\n2x - 11 \u2265 0\n\nAdd 11 to both sides:\n\n2x \u2265 11\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx \u2265 11/2.\n\nWait, 11/2 is 5.5. So the domain of g(x) is all"

            "output": " real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to 5.5. So the smallest real number in the domain would be 11/2 or 5.5.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again, the original expression inside the square root is (x - 3)\u00b2 - (x - 8)\u00b2. I correctly identified this as a difference of squares. Then I set a = x - 3 and b = x - 8, which seems right. Applying the difference of squares: (a - b)(a + b). That simplifies to 5*(2x - 11). So that part seems correct.\n\nThen, 5*(2x - 11) \u2265 0. Since 5 > 0, this inequality simplifies to 2x - 11 \u2265 0. Solving for x: x \u2265 11/2, which is 5.5. So, yes, the domain is x \u2265 5.5, and the smallest real number in the domain is 5.5.\n\nWait, let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the algebra when expanding the squares. Let me compute (x - 3)\u00b2 and (x - 8)\u00b2 separately.\n\n(x - 3)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 6x + 9\n\n(x - 8)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 16x + 64\n\nSubtracting them: (x\u00b2 - 6x + 9) - (x\u00b2 - 16x + 64) = x\u00b2 - 6x + 9 - x\u00b2 + 16x - 64 = (x\u00b2 - x\u00b2) + (-6x + 16x) + (9 - 64) = 10x - 55.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I got 5*(2x - 11), which is 10x - 55. So that's consistent. So either way, whether I factor it or expand it, I end up with the same expression: 10x - 55 \u2265 0.\n\nSo 10x - 55 \u2265 0 \u21d2 10x \u2265 55 \u21d2 x \u2265 55/10 \u21d2 x \u2265 5.5. So that seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't factor it, I could have solved 10x -"

Because I factored the difference of squares, which gives the same thing as expanding it out to 10x - 55. So both approaches agree.\n\nThus, the domain is x \u2265 5.5, so the smallest real number is 5.5, which is 11/2. So in box form, that would be \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}.\n\nWait, before I finish, let me make sure that when x = 5.5, the expression inside the square root is zero, which is allowed because square root of zero is zero, which is defined. So the function is defined at x = 11/2, so that's included in the domain. Therefore, x = 11/2 is indeed the smallest real number in the domain.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \\) requires the expression inside the square root to be non-negative. \n\nFirst, set up the inequality:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \\geq 0\n\\]\nFactor the difference of squares:\n\\[\n[(x - 3) - (x - 8)][(x - 3) + (x - 8)] \\geq 0\n\\]\nSimplify each factor:\n\\[\n(5)(2x - 11) \\geq 0\n\\]\nSince 5 is positive, the inequality reduces to:\n\\[\n2x - 11 \\geq 0 \\implies x \\geq \\frac{11}{2}\n\\]\nThus, the smallest real number in the domain is \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}\n\\]"
