To do this, I'll calculate the number of times 10 is a factor in 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the number of times 2 appears in the prime factors of 42!. This is found by dividing 42 by 2 and then dividing the result by 2 repeatedly until the quotient is less than 1. The total count from this process gives me the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization.\n\nNext, I'll do the same to find the number of times 5 appears in the prime factors of 42!. The exponent of 5 will determine how many times 10 is a factor, because there are typically more 2s than 5s in a factorial.\n\nFinally, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5. By comparing these two counts, I'll arrive at the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeros are at the end of \\(42!\\), we need to calculate the number of times 10 is a factor in \\(42!\\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in \\(42!\\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\quad \\text{( quotients are whole numbers only)}\n   \\]\n   \n   Since \\( \\frac{42}{5} = 8.4 \\), we take the floor value, which is 8.\n\n2. **Check if there are additional factors of 5 in multiples of higher powers (25, 125, etc.):**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\quad \\text{( quotients are whole numbers only)}\n   \\]\n   \n   The value \\(42 \\div 25 = 1.68\\), so we take 1.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\quad \\text{( quot"

There are 39 factors of 2 in \\(42!\\).\n\n5. **Determine the number of trailing zeros:**\n   \n   The number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s. Since there are 39 factors of 2 and 9 factors of 5, the minimum is 9.\n\n\\boxed{9}"
