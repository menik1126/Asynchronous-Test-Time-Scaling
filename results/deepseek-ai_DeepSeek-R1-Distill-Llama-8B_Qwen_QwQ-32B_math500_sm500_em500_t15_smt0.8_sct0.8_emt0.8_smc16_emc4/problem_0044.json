            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number that are less than the number itself.\n\nI'll start by finding the prime factors of 284. Since 284 is even, it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. Continuing the factorization, 142 is also even, so dividing by 2 again yields 71. The number 71 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71\u00b9.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (2 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 18, I know the sum of all positive divisors of 284 is 18. Since we only want the proper divisors, I'll subtract 284 from this sum: 18 - 284 = -266. However, this result is negative, which doesn't make sense for proper divisors. It seems there might be an error in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the sum of divisors. For 2\u00b2, the sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. For 71\u00b9, the sum is 1 + 71 = 72. Multiplying these gives 7 \u00d7 72 = 504. Subtracting 284 from 504 gives 220. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. To do this, I'll determine the prime factors of 220. It's even, so dividing by 2 gives 110. Dividing 110 by 2 again yields 55. The number 55 can be factored into 5 \u00d7 11. Thus, the prime factorization of 220 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b9 \u00d7 11\u00b9.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula: (2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 12. This gives the sum of all positive divisors of 220 as 12. Subtracting 220 from 12 to get the proper divisors' sum: 12 - 220 = -208. This negative result indicates another mistake.\n\nUpon reviewing,"

            "output": " I realize the sum of divisors for each prime factor should be calculated correctly. For 2\u00b2, the sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. For 5\u00b9, it's 1 + 5 = 6. For 11\u00b9, it's 1 + 11 = 12. Multiplying these together: 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 12 = 504. Subtracting 220 gives 504 - 220 = 284. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284. The sum of proper divisors of 284 is 220, so now I need the sum of proper divisors of 220, which I just found to be 284. Therefore, the final answer is 284. However, this seems like a loop between 220 and 284, which are known as amicable numbers. So the answer should indeed be 284.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Let's list the proper divisors of 220 manually. The divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110. Adding these up: 1+2=3, +4=7, +5=12, +10=22, +11=33, +20=53, +22=75, +44=119, +55=174, +110=284. Yes, that's correct. So the sum is indeed 284. Therefore, the answer is 284.\n\nBut wait, the question is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284. The first sum is 220, then the sum of its proper divisors is 284. So the final answer is 284. But the problem might expect me to go another step? Let me check again"
