            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors of a number are all the positive integers that divide that number without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.\n\nI'll start by identifying the prime factors of 284. I know that 284 is an even number, so 2 is one of its factors. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. Since 142 is also even, dividing by 2 again yields 71. Finally, 71 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71 to the first power.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p^(n+1) - 1)/(p - 1) for each prime factor p raised to the power n, I can calculate the sum of all divisors of 284. For 2\u00b2, the sum is (2^3 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 7. For 71\u00b9, the sum is (71^2 - 1)/(71 - 1) = 5040. Multiplying these together gives the total sum of divisors, which is 7 * 5040 = 35280.\n\nSince the sum of all divisors includes 284 itself, I need to subtract 284 to find the sum of the proper divisors. So, 35280 minus 284 equals 35096.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 35096. To do this efficiently, I'll look for patterns or factors that can simplify the calculation. Recognizing that 35096 is a multiple of 4, I'll start by dividing by 4, which gives 8774. Dividing 8774 by 2 yields 4387, which appears to be a prime number.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again, I consider the prime factors 2\u2074 and 4387\u00b9. For 2\u2074, the sum is (2^5 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 31. For 4387\u00b9, since it's prime, the sum is (4387^2 - 1)/(4387 - 1) = 19419400. Multiplying these gives the total sum of divisors as 31 * 19419400 = 603194600.\n\nFinally, subtracting "

            "output": "35096 from this total to exclude the number itself, we get 603194600 minus 35096. However, upon checking my calculations, I realize that multiplying 31 by 19419400 might be incorrect. Let me recalculate. Since 2\u2074 \u00d7 4387 = 16 \u00d7 4387 = 70192, but I initially thought the original number was 35096. Wait, perhaps a mistake occurred in factoring. Let me re-examine the factorization of 35096.\n\nStarting over for 35096: divide by 2 four times gives 35096 / 16 = 2193.5, which isn't an integer, so maybe my earlier division was wrong. Let's see: 35096 \u00f7 2 = 17548, then \u00f72 again = 8774, then \u00f72 = 4387, which is correct. So the prime factors are 2\u00b3 \u00d7 4387\u00b9. Then the sum of divisors would be (2^4 - 1)/(2-1) = 15 multiplied by (4387\u00b2 + 4387 + ... up to power 1). Wait, actually, for prime factors p and q, the formula is (1+p+p\u00b2+p\u00b3)(1+4387). So (1+2+4+8)*(1+4387) = 15 * 4388 = 15*4388. Calculating that: 10*4388=43,880 and 5*4388=21,940, so total is 65,820. Then subtract 35096 to get the proper divisors: 65,820 - 35,096 = 30,724. Wait, but this contradicts my previous step. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial factorization steps. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, the sum of divisors of 284 was calculated as follows: prime factors 2\u00b2"

Therefore, the problem is to find the sum of proper divisors of 220.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the initial steps. Let me go back.\n\nThe original problem is: \"What is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284?\"\n\nSo first, find proper divisors of 284, sum them, then find proper divisors of that sum.\n\nSo step 1: Sum of proper divisors of 284.\n\n284: Let's find its divisors.\n\n284 is even, so 2 is a divisor. 284 \u00f72=142. 142 is even, \u00f72=71. So factors are 2, 71, and the factors of 142 are 2, 71. Also, the factors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, 284.\n\nProper divisors (excluding 284) are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142.\n\nSum: 1+2=3; 3+4=7; 7+71=78; 78+142=220.\n\nSo sum of proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n\nNow, step 2: Find the sum of proper divisors of 220.\n\nFirst, factorize 220.\n\n220 \u00f72=110\n\n110 \u00f72=55\n\n55 \u00f75=11. 11 is prime.\n\nSo prime factors: 2\u00b2 \u00d75\u00b9 \u00d711\u00b9.\n\nSum of all divisors: (1+2+4)(1+5)(1+11)=7*6*12=504.\n\nProper divisors of 220: sum of all divisors minus 220: 504-220=284.\n\nWait, that seems to loop back. So sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284.\n\nBut then the question is asking for the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284, which is the sum of proper divisors of 220, which is 284. So the final result is 284.\n\nWait, but that seems circular"

So indeed, the sum of proper divisors of 284 is 220, and the sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284. Therefore, the answer is 284.\n\nBut let me verify step by step again to be sure.\n\nFirst step: sum of proper divisors of 284.\n\nDivisors of 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, 284. Proper divisors exclude 284, so sum is 1+2+4+71+142 = 220.

So the answer is 284.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my initial factorization steps when I thought the sum was 35096, but that was incorrect because I miscalculated the sum of divisors for 284. The correct sum is 220, leading to the next step being 220's proper divisors summing to 284. Therefore, the final answer is 284.\n\n</think>\n\nThe proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.
