The modulus, which is the distance from the origin, is the square root of (1 squared plus (-1) squared), which equals √2.\n\nThe argument of the complex number is the angle it makes with the positive real axis. Since it's in the fourth quadrant, the argument is -π/4 radians.\n\nNow, raising a complex number to the 8th power involves raising the modulus to the 8th power and multiplying the argument by 8. So, (√2)^8 equals (2^(1/2))^8, which is 2^(4) = 16.\n\nMultiplying the argument by 8 gives 8 * (-π/4) = -2π. However, since angles are periodic with a period of 2π, -2π is equivalent to 0 radians.\n\nFinally, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is the modulus of the resulting complex number, which is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Express \\(1 - i\\) in Polar Form**\n\nA complex number \\(a + bi\\) can be expressed in polar form as \\(r(\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta)\\), where:\n- \\(r\\) is the modulus (distance from the origin),\n- \\(\\theta\\) is the argument (angle from the positive real axis).\n\nFor the complex number \\(1 - i\\):\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-1}{1}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\quad (\\text{since it's in the fourth quadrant})\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\n1 - i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i \\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Raise \\(1 - i\\) to the"
