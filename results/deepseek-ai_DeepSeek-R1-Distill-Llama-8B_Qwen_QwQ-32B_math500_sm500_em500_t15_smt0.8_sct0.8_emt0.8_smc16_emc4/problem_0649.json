Also, I know that P(11) = 181. My goal is to find P(16).\n\nHmm, since P(x) is a quadratic, I can write it in the general form: P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real coefficients that I need to find.\n\nNow, it's given that P(x) is squeezed between two other quadratics: the lower bound is x² - 2x + 2 and the upper bound is 2x² - 4x + 3. So, for all x, P(x) is greater than or equal to the lower quadratic and less than or equal to the upper quadratic.\n\nThis means that if I subtract the lower quadratic from P(x), the result should be non-negative for all x, and similarly, if I subtract P(x) from the upper quadratic, the result should also be non-negative for all x.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n1. P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n2. (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSo, substituting P(x) = ax² + bx + c into both inequalities.\n\nStarting with the first inequality:\nax² + bx + c - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0\nSimplify:\n(a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSimilarly, for the second inequality:\n2x² - 4x + 3 - (ax² + bx + c) ≥ 0\nSimplify:\n(2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nNow, since these quadratic expressions are non-negative for all real x, they must be perfect squares or have a discriminant less than or equal to zero. That is, their leading coefficients should be positive (to open upwards), and their discriminants should be less than or equal to zero (so they don't cross the x-axis).\n\nWait,"

So, both quadratic expressions we obtained must satisfy these conditions.\n\nLet me denote the first quadratic as Q1(x) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2). So, Q1(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSimilarly, the second quadratic as Q2(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c). Q2(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSo, for Q1(x):\n\n1. Leading coefficient: a - 1 > 0 ⇒ a > 1.\n2. Discriminant: [ (b + 2) ]² - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, for Q2(x):\n\n1. Leading coefficient: 2 - a > 0 ⇒ a < 2.\n2. Discriminant: [ (-4 - b) ]² - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0.\n\nSo, combining these, a must satisfy 1 < a < 2.\n\nSo, a is between 1 and 2.\n\nAdditionally, the discriminants must be ≤ 0, so:\n\nFor Q1:\n(b + 2)² - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0.\n\nFor Q2:\n(-4 - b)² - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can set up these inequalities and see if I can find a, b, c.\n\nWait, another thought: since P(x) is between two quadratics, maybe P(x) is exactly equal to one of them somewhere, but that might not necessarily be the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since P(x) is between two quadratics, maybe it's the average of them? Wait, but that's only if the inequalities are sandwiching in a symmetric way. Hmm, not sure if that's the case here.\n\nWait, but let me think. If P(x) is between x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² -4x +3, then maybe P(x) can be expressed as the average or some linear combination of the"

Let me see:\n\nLet me compute the difference between the upper and lower bounds:\n\nUpper - Lower = (2x² -4x +3) - (x² -2x +2) = x² -2x +1 = (x -1)^2.\n\nAh! That's interesting. The difference between the upper and lower bounds is (x -1)^2, which is always non-negative, so that makes sense. So, the upper bound is exactly the lower bound plus (x -1)^2. Therefore, the region between them is exactly the set of quadratics that are between the lower bound and the lower bound plus (x-1)^2.\n\nTherefore, P(x) must be equal to the lower bound plus some multiple of (x -1)^2, but such that the multiple is between 0 and 1. Wait, but since the upper bound is exactly the lower bound plus (x -1)^2, so if we let P(x) = lower + k*(x -1)^2, where 0 ≤ k ≤1, then P(x) would lie between the two bounds. But since P(x) is a quadratic, then k must be a constant, so that would make sense.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nSuppose P(x) = (x² -2x +2) + k*(x -1)^2, where 0 ≤k ≤1. Then, since (x -1)^2 is non-negative, then P(x) would be between the lower bound and the upper bound (since when k=1, it's exactly the upper bound). So that's a good way to parametrize P(x).\n\nTherefore, maybe P(x) can be written as:\n\nP(x) = (x² -2x +2) + k*(x -1)^2, where k is a constant between 0 and 1.\n\nAlternatively, since the difference between upper and lower is (x-1)^2, so P(x) must be equal to the lower bound plus some multiple of (x-1)^2, but the multiple can be a constant between 0 and 1. Since P(x) is quadratic, the multiple has to be a constant, not a function of x. So that's a good approach.\n\nTherefore"
