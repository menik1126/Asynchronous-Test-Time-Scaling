Therefore, the number of players \\( x \\) must satisfy the equation \\( x \\times y = 54 \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be at least 2 and \\( y \\) must be at least 5, I need to find all pairs of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that meet these conditions. This essentially means I'm looking for all the divisors of 54 that are greater than or equal to 2 for \\( x \\) and each corresponding \\( y \\) must be at least 5.\n\nTo find these pairs, I'll list out all the divisors of 54. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. However, since \\( x \\) must be at least 2, I'll exclude 1. This leaves me with possible values of \\( x \\) as 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\nNext, I'll check for each \\( x \\) whether the corresponding \\( y \\) (which is \\( \\frac{54}{x} \\)) is at least 5:\n- For \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 27 \\) which is acceptable.\n- For \\( x = 3 \\), \\( y = 18 \\) which is acceptable.\n- For \\( x = 6 \\), \\( y = 9 \\) which is acceptable.\n- For \\( x = 9 \\), \\( y = 6 \\) which is acceptable.\n- For \\( x = 18 \\), \\( y = 3 \\) which is not acceptable because \\( y < 5 \\).\n- For \\( x = 27 \\), \\( y = 2 \\) which is not acceptable because \\( y < 5 \\).\n- For \\( x = 54 \\), \\( y = 1 \\) which is not acceptable because \\( y < 5 \\).\n\nAfter eliminating the cases where \\( y \\) is less than 5, the valid values of \\( x \\) are 2, 3, 6, and 9. Therefore, there are 4"
