I need to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r_5}}\\). \n\nFirst, let me recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to the modulus squared of \\(r\\), which is \\(|r|^2\\). So, \\(1/(r\\overline{r})\\) is the reciprocal of the modulus squared of \\(r\\). \n\nGiven that the equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), it seems like a high-degree polynomial. Specifically, it's a 20th-degree polynomial if we expand it out, right? Because \\(x^{10}\\) is degree 10 and \\((13x -1)^{10}\\) is also degree 10, so when we add them together, the leading term will be \\(x^{10} + (13x)^{10}\\), which is \\(x^{10}(1 + 13^{10})\\). So, the equation is indeed a 20th-degree polynomial.\n\nNow, the roots of this equation are the 10 complex roots \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). Wait, hold on—the equation is 20th-degree, so shouldn't there be 20 roots? But the user mentions only 10 roots, counting each pair \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\). That makes sense because complex roots come in conjugate pairs when the coefficients of the polynomial are real. So, the 20 roots consist of 10 such pairs.\n\nBut in the problem, we're only being asked about 5 pairs. Hmm, why 5 pairs? Because the equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), which can be rewritten as \\((x)^{10} = - ("

Let me think.\n\nLet me try to rearrange the equation:\n\n\\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\)\n\nTaking both sides to the power of 1/10, but since we are dealing with complex numbers, we have to consider all 10th roots. However, maybe it's better to write this as:\n\n\\(\\left( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} \\right)^{10} = -1\\)\n\nYes, that seems useful. Let me set \\(y = \\frac{x}{13x - 1}\\). Then the equation becomes \\(y^{10} = -1\\). \n\nThe solutions to \\(y^{10} = -1\\) are the 10th roots of -1. Since -1 can be written in polar form as \\(e^{i\\pi + 2\\pi i k}\\) for integer k, so the 10th roots would be \\(e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10}\\) for k from 0 to 9. \n\nTherefore, the solutions for y are \\(y = e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10}\\) for k = 0,1,...,9. \n\nSo, each root y corresponds to a root x via the substitution \\(y = \\frac{x}{13x - 1}\\). Let me solve for x in terms of y:\n\n\\(y = \\frac{x}{13x - 1}\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(13x - 1\\):\n\n\\(y(13x - 1) = x\\)\n\nExpand:\n\n\\(13y x - y = x\\)\n\nBring all terms with x to one side:\n\n\\(13y x - x = y\\)\n\nFactor x:\n\n\\(x(13y - 1) = y\\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\(x = \\frac{y}{13y - 1}\\)\n\nSo, each root y gives a root x via this formula.

So, if I can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\), which is a root of \\(y^{10} = -1\\), then the roots \\(x\\) are each \\(y/(13y - 1)\\).\n\nSo, perhaps instead of working with \\(x\\), it's easier to work with \\(y\\). Let me see what is needed.\n\nWe need to compute the sum \\(\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}}\\). As I thought earlier, this is the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) for each pair \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r_i}\\).\n\nSo, \\(1/|r_i|^2 = 1/|x_i|^2 = \\frac{\\overline{x_i}}{|x_i|^2} = \\frac{\\overline{x_i}}{x_i \\overline{x_i}} = \\frac{1}{x_i \\overline{x_i}}\\).

Therefore, the sum we are to compute is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\frac{1}{x_i \\overline{x_i}}\\).\n\nBut \\(1/(x_i \\overline{x_i})\\) is equal to \\(1/|x_i|^2\\), which is the same as \\(1/|x_i|^2\\).

So, 10 roots in total, grouped into 5 pairs.

The leading term is (13x)^10, so when added to x^{10}, the leading term is (13^{10} +1)x^{10}, so the equation is indeed degree 10? Wait, no, wait, no, the equation is x^{10} + (13x -1)^10 =0.

Wait, (13x -1)^10 is a 10th-degree polynomial, so adding it to x^{10} (which is also 10th-degree) gives a 10th-degree polynomial. Therefore, the equation is 10th-degree, so there are 10 roots.

Wait, hold on. Wait, the roots y_i are the 10th roots of -1, which are complex numbers on the unit circle. Since -1 is real, the roots come in conjugate pairs. For example, if y is a root, then \\overline{y} is also a root. \n\nTherefore, the roots y_i can be grouped into conjugate pairs. Therefore, the sum over all y_i is zero, as we had before. \n\nTherefore, the sum over |13 y_i -1|^2 for all roots y_i is 1700, so the sum over each pair would be |13 y_i -1|^2 + |13 \\overline{y_i} -1|^2. \n\nBut let me compute that:\n\n|13 y_i -1|^2 + |13 \\overline{y_i} -1|^2 = [170 -13(y_i + \\overline{y_i})] + [170 -13(\\overline{y_i} + y_i)] = 170 +170 -13*2*(y_i + \\overline{y_i}).\n\nWait, but that's 340 -26*(y_i + \\overline{y_i}).\n\nBut since the sum over all pairs would be sum_{all pairs} [340 -26*(y_i + \\overline{y_i})]. But since the total sum over all roots is 1700, which is 10 terms, so 5 pairs, each contributing 340 -26*(y_i + \\overline{y_i}), but this seems more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, since the total sum over all roots is 1700, and each pair contributes two terms, so the total sum is indeed 1700, so the problem's sum is 1700 divided by 2, which is 850. \n\nAlternatively, since each term in the problem's sum"

Therefore, the answer is 850.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculation of |13 y_i -1|^2. Wait, |13 y_i -1|^2 = (13 y_i -1)(13 \\overline{y_i} -1) = |13 y_i|^2 -13 y_i -13 \\overline{y_i} +1.\n\nBut |13 y_i|^2 =169 |y_i|^2=169*1=169, so |13 y_i -1|^2 =169 -13(y_i + \\overline{y_i}) +1=170 -13(y_i + \\overline{y_i}). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, sum over all 10 roots is 10*170 -13*sum over 10 roots (y_i + \\overline{y_i})=1700 -13*(sum y_i + sum \\overline{y_i})=1700 -13*(0 +0)=1700. Correct.\n\nTherefore, since the problem's sum is over 5 terms, each 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i})=1/|x_i|^2, which is equal to |13 y_i -1|^2. However, each x_i and \\overline{x_i} correspond to two roots with the same |x_i|^2, so the problem's sum S is the sum over 5 terms, each being 1/|x_i|^2, which is 1700 /2=850. So, the answer is 850.\n\nThus, \\boxed{850}\n</think>\n\nThe equation given is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\).
