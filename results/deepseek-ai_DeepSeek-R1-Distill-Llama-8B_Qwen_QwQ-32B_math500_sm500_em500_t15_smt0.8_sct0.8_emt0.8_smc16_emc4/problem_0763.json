The problem states that for every positive integer k, two things happen: first, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is a geometric sequence, and second, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence. Also, we're given that a13 is 2016, and we need to find a1.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. Let's see. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, that means each term is larger than the one before it. So, a1 < a2 < a3 < ... and so on.\n\nNow, for every k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. That means that the ratio between consecutive terms is constant in each of these geometric sequences. So, for the first k=1, we're looking at a1, a2, a3, which is a geometric sequence. Similarly, for k=2, we have a3, a4, a5; for k=3, a5, a6, a7; and this continues up to k=6, which would be a11, a12, a13 because 2*6+1=13. So, a11, a12, a13 is also a geometric sequence.\n\nAdditionally, for every k, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence. So, that means the difference between consecutive terms is constant in each of these arithmetic sequences. So, for k=1, we have a2, a3, a4 being arithmetic; for k=2, a4, a5, a6; and so on up to k=6, which would be a12, a13, a14.\n\nBut wait, we're given a13=2016. So, our goal is to work backwards or forwards to figure out a1. Since the sequences are intertwined, maybe I can express each term in terms of earlier terms.\n\nLet me try to write out the relationships for a few k values to"

So, maybe we can express a_{2k+2} in terms of a_{2k} and a_{2k+1}.\n\nWait, but this seems to get complicated quickly because each term depends on the previous ones, which might be hard to directly relate all the way up to a13.\n\nMaybe I can represent terms as functions of a1 and some common ratios and differences. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider that for the geometric sequences, each term is multiplied by a common ratio, say r. But wait, does this ratio r vary with k or stay constant?\n\nWait a second, hold on. The problem states that for each k, a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. That suggests that each of these triplets is geometric, but not necessarily with the same ratio as the previous one. So, for k=1, the ratio is r1, for k=2, it's r2, and so on. So, each geometric triplet might have its own ratio.

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence can be expressed in terms of a1 and some common ratio or difference that propagates through the terms.

Since it's arithmetic, the difference is a3 - a2 = a1*r1^2 - a1*r1 = a1*r1(r1 - 1). Therefore, the next term a4 is a3 + (a3 - a2) = 2*a3 - a2 = 2*a1*r1^2 - a1*r1.\n\nSo, a4 = a1*r1*(2r1 - 1).\n\nNow, moving to k=2, the next geometric triplet is a3, a4, a5.
