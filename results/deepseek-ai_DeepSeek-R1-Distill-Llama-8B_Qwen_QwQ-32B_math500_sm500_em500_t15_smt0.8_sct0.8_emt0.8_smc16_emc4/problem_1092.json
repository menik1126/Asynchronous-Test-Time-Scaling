Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nThe function f takes two arguments, i and j, both non-negative integers, but since i can be any positive integer and j is modulo 5, the problem is mostly concerned with j values from 0 to 4. The function is defined in three cases:\n\n1. If i = 0 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 4, then f(0, j) is just mod5(j + 1). So, that's straightforward. For example, f(0, 0) would be mod5(1) which is 1, f(0, 1) is mod5(2) which is 2, and so on, up to f(0, 4) which is mod5(5) = 0.\n\n2. If i ≥ 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) is f(i - 1, 1). So, this is a recursive call, decrementing i by 1 and setting j to 1. That means to find f(i, 0), I need to find f(i - 1, 1).\n\n3. If i ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, then f(i, j) is f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). This looks more complicated. It's a double recursion: to find f(i, j), I first need to find f(i, j - 1), and then use that result as the j parameter for f(i - 1, something).\n\nThe goal is to compute f(2015, 2). That's a large i, but maybe there's a pattern or cycle.\n\nLet me start by computing small values to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n- f(0, 0) = mod5(1) = 1\n- f(0, 1) = mod5(2) = 2\n- f(0, 2) = mod5(3) = 3\n- f(0, 3) = mod5(4) = 4\n- f(0"
