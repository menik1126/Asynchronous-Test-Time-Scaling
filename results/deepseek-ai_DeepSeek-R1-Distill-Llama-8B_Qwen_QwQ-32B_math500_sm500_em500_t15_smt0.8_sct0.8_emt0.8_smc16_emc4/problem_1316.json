I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the rectangle. Since O is the center, it should be the intersection point of the diagonals. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at O. The rectangle has sides AB and AD with a ratio k, which I think means AB = k * AD or AD = k * AB? I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and AD = BC. So, if AB/AD = k, then AB = k * AD or AD = AB/k. Let's assume AB is the length and AD is the width. So, maybe I can denote AB = k and AD = 1, but actually, it might be better to assign variables. Let me define AD = x and AB = kx. So, the sides are AB = kx and AD = x. Therefore, the rectangle has length kx and width x.\n\nBut to make calculations easier, maybe it's better to set specific lengths. Let's suppose that AD = 1 unit, so AB = k units. Therefore, the rectangle has length AB = k and width AD = 1. Then, the area of the rectangle is AB * AD = k * 1 = k. So, the total area is k.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is drawn from (-250,100) to (250,100) to (250,-100) to (-250,-100). So, actually, the rectangle is 500 units long (from -250 to 250) and 200 units wide (from 100 to -100). So, the sides are 500 and 200, making the ratio AB/AD = 500/200 = 2.5. So, in the Asymptote example, k is 2.5. But in the problem, k is general. So, maybe k is the ratio of AB to AD, so AB = k * AD.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem, it's better to consider a general rectangle with AB = k * AD, so the rectangle's sides are in the ratio k:1.\n\n"

Let me set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place the rectangle in coordinate system with center O at (0,0). Then, since O is the midpoint, the coordinates can be set as follows:\n\nLet me denote the length AB as the horizontal side and AD as the vertical side, so the rectangle extends from (-a, -b) to (a, b), so that the horizontal length is 2a, vertical length is 2b. Therefore, AB would be the horizontal side length, so AB = 2a and AD = 2b? Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, actually, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is drawn from (-250, 100) to (250,100) to (250,-100), so in that example, the vertical sides are from -100 to 100, so AD would be the vertical side? Wait, in the Asymptote code, the points are labeled such that A is (-250,100), which is the northwest corner, so coordinates are:\n\nA: (-250,100)\n\nB: (250,100)\n\nC: (250,-100)\n\nD: (-250,-100)\n\nTherefore, AB is the top side from (-250,100) to (250,100), so its length is 500 units. Then AD is from A (-250,100) to D (-250,-100), so that's vertical, 200 units. So in that case, AB = 500 and AD = 200, so their ratio is 5:2, so k = AB/AD = 2.5.

Wait, let me clarify:\n\nIf AB is horizontal and has length k * AD, so if I let AD = 1, then AB = k. Therefore, the rectangle extends from (-k/2, -1/2) to (k/2, 1/2). Then, the center O is at (0,0).\n\nBut actually, in the Asymptote code, they have specific lengths of 500 and 200, but in the problem, it's general. So, to make it easier, let me set AD = 1 and AB = k. So, the sides are AB = k (horizontal) and AD = 1 (vertical). Therefore, the rectangle spans from (-k/2, -1/2) to (k/2, 1/2). But wait, is that correct? If AB is the length of the top side, which is from A to B, and AD is the vertical side.\n\nBut actually, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is centered at (0,0), so O is the center. Therefore, the rectangle extends from (-AB/2, -AD/2) to (AB/2, AD/2). But given that AB/AD = k, so AB = k * AD. So, for computation purposes, I can define AD = 1, AB = k. So, the rectangle will have coordinates from (-k/2, -1/2) to (k/2, 1/2).\n\nBut in the Asymptote code, the coordinates are (-250,100), (250,100), etc., so that would correspond to AB = 500, AD = 200, so k = AB/AD = 500/200 = 2.5, as I thought.\n\nBut to make the problem general, I can proceed with AD = 1 and AB = k.\n\nTherefore, the rectangle is from (-k/2, -1/2) to (k/2, 1/2), and center at (0,0).
