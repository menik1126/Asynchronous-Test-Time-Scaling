The total number of dogs is 28.\n\nUnder the new policy, Denali and Nate can be reassigned new dogs or have their dogs transferred in groups of x. The problem states two scenarios where the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same.\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali walks 4x more dogs, so her total becomes 16 + 4x. Nate still walks 12 dogs. The ratio of their payments would be (16 + 4x) / 12.\n\nIn the second scenario, x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. Denali's total becomes 16 + x, and Nate's total becomes 12 - x. The ratio here is (16 + x) / (12 - x).\n\nSince these two ratios are equal, I can set them equal to each other and solve for x.\n\nSo, (16 + 4x) / 12 = (16 + x) / (12 - x). By cross-multiplying and simplifying, I can find the value of x that satisfies this equation.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks **16 dogs** initially.\n- Nate walks **12 dogs** initially.\n- The company's policy allows reassigning or assigning new dogs in groups of **\\(x\\)** dogs.\n- Two scenarios maintain the same ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay.\n\n**Scenario 1:**  \nDenali walks **\\(4x\\) more** dogs, while Nate stays at **12 dogs**.\n- Denali's total dogs = \\(16 + 4x\\)\n- Nate's total dogs = \\(12\\)\n\n**Scenario 2:**  \n\\(x\\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n- Denali's total dogs = \\(16 + x\\)\n- Nate's total dogs = \\(12 - x\\)\n\n**Setting up the ratios:**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Denali's dogs in Scenario 1}}{\\text{Nate's dogs in Scenario 1}} = \\frac{\\text{Denali's dogs in Scenario 2}}{\\text{Nate's dogs in Scenario 2}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12}"

    "question": "Denali and Nate work for a dog walking business and are paid for each dog they walk. Denali is responsible for $16$ dogs and Nate is responsible for $12$ dogs. Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali. Find $x$ if $x\\neq0$."
