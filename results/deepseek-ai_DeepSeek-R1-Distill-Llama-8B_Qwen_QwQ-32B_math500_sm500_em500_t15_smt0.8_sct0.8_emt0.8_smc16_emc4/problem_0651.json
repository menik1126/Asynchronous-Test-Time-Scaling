            "output": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here where I need to find P(16) for a quadratic polynomial P(x). The problem gives me some inequalities and a specific value. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. So, P(x) must be in the form ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. That makes sense.\n\nNext, there's this inequality: x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all real numbers x. So, P(x) is sandwiched between two other quadratic functions. That means for every x, P(x) is always above the first quadratic and below the second one.\n\nAlso, we're given that P(11) = 181. Our goal is to find P(16).\n\nHmm, okay. So, how can I use these inequalities to figure out the coefficients of P(x)? Maybe I can express P(x) in terms of the difference between these two functions. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the lower bound as Q(x) = x² - 2x + 2 and the upper bound as R(x) = 2x² - 4x + 3. So, P(x) is between Q(x) and R(x) for all real x. That must mean that P(x) - Q(x) is non-negative and R(x) - P(x) is also non-negative for all x.\n\nWait, but since P(x) is a quadratic, and both Q(x) and R(x) are quadratics, then P(x) - Q(x) and R(x) - P(x) must also be quadratics. Moreover, since P(x) is between Q(x) and R(x) for all x, these differences must be non-negative for all x. Thus, they must be non-negative quadratic functions, which implies that they have a discriminant less than or equal to zero and the leading coefficient is non-negative.\n\nSo, let's set P(x) - Q(x) = S(x) and R(x) - P(x) = T(x). Then S(x) = P(x) - Q(x) must be ≥ 0 for all x, and T(x) = R(x) - P(x) must be ≥ "

Wait, actually, for a quadratic to be non-negative for all real x, it must either be a perfect square (i.e., discriminant is zero) or it must have a leading coefficient positive and discriminant negative. Hmm, but actually, if it's non-negative for all x, it must open upwards (leading coefficient ≥ 0) and have discriminant ≤ 0.\n\nSo, for both S(x) and T(x), their leading coefficients must be non-negative, and their discriminants must be ≤ 0.\n\nBut let's write these out. Let me define S(x) = P(x) - Q(x) and T(x) = R(x) - P(x). Then:\n\nS(x) = (a x² + b x + c) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2).\n\nSimilarly, T(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - (a x² + b x + c) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c).\n\nSince S(x) ≥ 0 for all x and T(x) ≥ 0 for all x, we have:\n\n1.

Maybe I can find a relationship between S(x) and T(x). Since S(x) = P(x) - Q(x) and T(x) = R(x) - P(x), adding them gives:\n\nS(x) + T(x) = R(x) - Q(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - (x² - 2x + 2) = x² - 2x + 1.\n\nSo, S(x) + T(x) = x² - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2.\n\nInteresting! So, S(x) + T(x) is a perfect square, (x - 1)^2.\n\nMoreover, since both S(x) and T(x) are non-negative, their sum is (x - 1)^2, which is always non-negative. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, S(x) + T(x) = (x - 1)^2.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express S(x) as (x - 1)^2 - T(x), but that might not be helpful directly. Alternatively, since S(x) and T(x) add up to (x - 1)^2, and both are non-negative, they must somehow partition the square.\n\nBut since both S(x) and T(x) are quadratics, maybe their sum is also a quadratic? Wait, (x - 1)^2 is a quadratic, so S(x) and T(x) are quadratics whose sum is also a quadratic. That suggests that S(x) and T(x) must each be quadratics, so that their sum is a quadratic.\n\nAlternatively, since R(x) - Q(x) is x² - 2x + 1, which is a square, it can be represented as S(x) + T(x).\n\nBut perhaps I can use this to express S(x) or T(x) in terms of the other.

But when x = 1, their sum is 0. Therefore, at x=1, both S(1) and T(1) must be zero, since they are non-negative and sum to 0. Therefore, S(1)=0 and T(1)=0. That gives us specific conditions at x=1.\n\nSo, let's plug in x = 1 into S(x) and T(x):\n\nFirst, S(1) = (a -1)(1)^2 + (b + 2)(1) + (c - 2) = (a -1) + (b + 2) + (c - 2) = (a -1 + b + 2 + c - 2) = (a + b + c -1). Since S(1)=0, so:\n\na + b + c - 1 = 0 => a + b + c = 1.\n\nSimilarly, T(1) = (2 - a)(1)^2 + (-4 - b)(1) + (3 - c) = (2 -a) + (-4 -b) + (3 - c) = (2 -a -4 -b +3 -c) = ( (2 -4 +3) + (-a - b -c) ) = (1) + (- (a + b + c)). But since a + b + c =1, that gives T(1)= 1 -1 =0, which checks out. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, we know that at x=1, both S(x) and T(x) are zero, so they must have (x-1)^2 as a factor?

Let me see.\n\nWait, if a quadratic function is non-negative for all x and equals zero only at x =1 (or maybe more points?), but since S(x) and T(x) have to add to (x -1)^2, which is zero only at x=1.

But then, for S(x) and T(x) to be non-negative, k must be positive and 1 -k must be non-negative, so k ≤1. So, it's possible that S(x) is k*(x -1)^2 and T(x) is (1 -k)*(x -1)^2. Alternatively, maybe S(x) and T(x) are multiples scaled by different factors.\n\nWait, another thought. Since S(x) and T(x) are both quadratics, their sum is (x -1)^2, which is also a quadratic. If S(x) and T(x) add up to (x -1)^2, what if each of them is a multiple of (x-1)^2? Hmm, but that might be too restrictive. Alternatively, maybe they share some relationship.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me denote S(x) = (x -1)^2 - T(x). Then, since S(x) is non-negative and T(x) is non-negative, we can say that (x -1)^2 = S(x) + T(x). Since both S(x) and T(x) are non-negative, each of them must be less than or equal to (x -1)^2.

Since S(x) + T(x) = (x -1)^2, and both S(x) and T(x) are quadratics, let's write S(x) = (x -1)^2 - T(x). But T(x) is also quadratic, so this substitution just gives us the same equation.\n\nAlternatively, since S(x) and T(x) are both quadratics, and their sum is (x -1)^2, which is also a quadratic, the coefficients of x², x, and the constants should add up in a certain way.\n\nLet me write out S(x) and T(x):\n\nS(x) = (a -1)x² + (b +2)x + (c -2).\n\nT"

Since S(x) is non-negative for all x, and S(1)=0, and it's a quadratic with leading coefficient a -1 ≥0, then the quadratic S(x) must have a double root at x=1. Therefore, S(x) must be proportional to (x -1)^2.\n\nSimilarly, T(x) must be proportional to (x -1)^2 as well, because T(1)=0 and T(x) is non-negative for all x, with leading coefficient 2 -a ≥0.

We need to find \\( P(16) \\).\n\nFirst, we define the lower bound \\( Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) and the upper bound \\( R(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\). We know that \\( P(x) \\) must be between \\( Q(x) \\) and \\( R(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nWe express \\( S(x) = P(x) - Q(x) \\) and \\( T(x) = R(x) - P(x) \\). Both \\( S(x) \\) and \\( T(x) \\) are non-negative for all \\( x \\) and their sum is \\( R(x) - Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( S(x) \\) and \\( T(x) \\) are non-negative quadratics, they must be perfect squares. We denote \\( S(x) = k(x - 1)^2 \\) and \\( T(x) = (1 - k)(x - 1)^2 \\) where \\( k \\) is a non-negative constant.\n\nWe express \\( S(x) \\) and \\( T(x) \\) in terms of \\( a, b, c \\):\n- \\( S(x) = (a - 1)x^2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) = k(x - 1)^2 \\)\n- \\( T(x) = (2 - a)x^2 + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) = (1 - k)(x - 1)^2 \\)\n\nFrom the coefficients, we derive:\n- \\( a - 1 = k \\)\n- \\( b + 2 = -2k \\)\n- \\( c - 2 = k \\)\n- \\( 2 - a = 1 -"
