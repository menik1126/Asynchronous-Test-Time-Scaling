            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a cubic monic polynomial P(x). Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. That means when I write it out, the leading coefficient is 1. So I can express P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\nWhere a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nNext, it mentions that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Hmm, I think R(x) must be a linear polynomial because when you divide by a quadratic, the remainder is linear or constant. So let me define R(x) as:\n\nR(x) = dx + e\n\nBut wait, the remainder when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4) is R(x), and when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3) is 2R(x). So both divisions give a linear remainder, so R(x) is linear. Therefore, R(x) is degree 1, as I thought.\n\nGiven that, I can use the Remainder Theorem or the Polynomial Remainder Theorem to write some equations.\n\nThe Polynomial Remainder Theorem tells us that if P(x) is divided by (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But here, it's being divided by a quadratic, so I need to use the concept of plugging in the roots.\n\nWait, no. Since (x - 1)(x - 4) is a quadratic, it has roots at x=1 and x=4. So when P(x) is divided by this quadratic, the remainder R(x) can be written as R(1) and R(4), which is equal to P(1) and P(4), respectively. Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so plugging in x=2 and x=3, I have P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nSo let's write that down.\n\nFirst, since R(x) is the"

P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n3. P(2) = 2R(2)\n4. P(3) = 2R(3)\n\nAlso, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, and R(x) is linear, maybe I can set up equations using these points.\n\nLet me also note that P(0) = 5, which is given. So that's another equation: P(0) = 5.\n\nSo in total, I have five equations (four from the remainders and one from P(0)), and variables are a, b, c (from P(x)), and d, e (from R(x)). So five equations and five unknowns. That should work.\n\nLet me write down all equations step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write expressions for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), and P(0).\n\nGiven P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + c,\n\nP(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + c = c = 5. So that gives me c = 5. That's straightforward.\n\nSo now, c is known. So now, the polynomial is P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + 5.\n\nNow, let's compute P(1):\n\nP(1) = 1 + a(1) + b(1) + 5 = (1 + a + b + 5) = (6 + a + b)\n\nSimilarly, P(4):\n\nP(4) = 4\u00b3 + a(4\u00b2) + b(4) + 5 = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 69 + 16a + 4b\n\nP(2):\n\nP(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 ="
