Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that both sides of the equation have exponents with different bases: 3 and 10. That makes me think that maybe taking logarithms could help, but I'm not entirely sure yet. Let me see if I can manipulate the equation somehow.\n\nLooking at 3^(2x), I remember that 3^(2x) is the same as (3^2)^x, which simplifies to 9^x. So I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n9^x + 19 = 10^x\n\nHmm, that might be a bit simpler to look at. Now, the equation is in terms of 9^x and 10^x. Maybe I can let y = 9^x or y = 10^x and create a substitution. Let's try that.\n\nLet me set y = 9^x. Then, 10^x can be written in terms of y as well. Since 10^x = (10^x)/(9^x) * 9^x, that would be (10/9)^x * 9^x, which is (10/9)^x * y. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write both sides in terms of the same base or relate them somehow. Let's see. If I subtract 9^x from both sides, I get:\n\n19 = 10^x - 9^x\n\nSo, 10^x - 9^x = 19. That seems interesting, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe if I divide both sides by 9^x, I can get an expression in terms of (10/9)^x.\n\nLet me try that. Dividing both sides by 9^x:\n\n(10^x)/9^x = (19)/9^x\n\nSo, that simplifies to (10/9)^x = 19 / 9^x.\n\nWait a second, 19 / 9^x is the same as 19 * (1/9)^x. So now I have:\n\n(10/9)^x = 19 * (1/9"

Since (10/9)^x is equal to (10^x)/(9^x), but I've already been down that path. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me consider the equation again: 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Perhaps I can take the natural logarithm of both sides, but since both sides are exponents, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe graphing both sides could give me an idea of where they intersect.\n\nWait, maybe I can test some integer values of x to see if they satisfy the equation. Let's try x = 1:\n\nLeft side: 9^1 + 19 = 9 + 19 = 28\nRight side: 10^1 = 10\n28 \u2260 10, so x=1 is not a solution.\n\nx=2:\n\nLeft side: 9^2 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100\nRight side: 10^2 = 100\nHey, 100=100! So x=2 is a solution.\n\nWait, that worked out. Let me check x=3:\n\nLeft side: 9^3 + 19 = 729 + 19 = 748\nRight side: 10^3 = 1000\n748 \u2260 1000, so x=3 is not a solution.\n\nHmm, so maybe x=2 is the only integer solution. But are there any other solutions? Maybe fractional x?\n\nLet me try x=0:\n\nLeft side: 9^0 + 19 = 1 + 19 = 20\nRight side: 10^0 = 1\n20\u22601, so no.\n\nx= -1:\n\nLeft side: 9^(-1) + 19 = 1/9 + 19 \u2248 0.111 + 19 \u2248 19.111\nRight side: 10^(-1) = 0.1\nNot equal.\n\nHmm, so far, x=2 works. Maybe it's the only solution, but I should confirm if there are any other possible x's.\n\nLet me think about the behavior of both sides as x increases and decreases.\n\nAs x approaches"

So, 10^x will outpace 9^x, making the left side 9^x + 19 much smaller than the right side.

That would mean that f(x) could have more than one root. But from our earlier tests, f(x) is negative at x=-1, x=0, x=1, zero at x=2, and positive at x=3.\n\nWait, so from x approaching negative infinity to, say, x=a where a is somewhere between -1 and 0, f(x) is decreasing, reaches a minimum, then increases.\n\nIf the minimum is below zero, which it is, because f(-1) is negative and f(0) is also negative, and then f(1) is negative, and at x=2 it crosses zero.\n\nWait, but if f(x) is increasing from x=a to infinity, and f(x) is negative at x=a, then crosses zero at x=2, and continues to increase. That suggests that there is only one root at x=2.\n\nBut wait, actually, between x=-1 and x=0, f(x) is decreasing from x=-infty to x=a, but f(-1)=~ -19.011 and f(0)= -19, so it actually doesn't decrease, it remains negative?

If the minimum value is below zero, then the function could cross zero once on the right side (at x=2) and maybe once on the left side? Wait, but as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches 19 (since 9^x approaches 0 and 10^x approaches 0, so 10^x -9^x approaches 0, so f(x)=0 -0 -19? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, f(x)=10^x -9^x -19. As x approaches negative infinity, 10^x approaches 0, 9^x approaches 0, so f(x) approaches -19. So the function approaches -19 as x approaches negative infinity. The minimum at x=c (between -1 and 0) would be even lower? Or higher?\n\nWait, since the function is decreasing until x=c and then increasing after, so the minimum at x=c is the lowest point. Since f(-1) is about -19.011 and f(0) is -19, so the minimum is probably around x=-1, but maybe slightly higher?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimum is actually higher than -19.011.

Wait, but that can't be, because if at x=-0.5, f(x) is -19.017, which is lower than f(-0.25)=approx -18.764.\n\nHmm, so the function f(x) is decreasing from x approaching negative infinity up to x=c, where c is between -1 and 0, but around x=-0.5, f(x) is lower.\n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, 10^(-0.25) is approximately 10^(-0.25)=1/(10^{0.25})=1/1.778\u22480.561.\n\n9^(-0.25)=1/(9^{0.25})\u22481/3.080\u22480.325.\n\nSo 0.561 -0.325=0.236.\n\nSo f(-0.25)=0.236 -19\u2248-18.764.\n\nHmm, but at x=-0.5:\n\n10^(-0.5)=approx 0.316.\n\n9^(-0.5)=approx 0.333.\n\nSo 0.316 -0.333\u2248-0.017.\n\nThus, f(-0.5)= -0.017 -19\u2248-19.017.\n\nSo, f(-0.5) is less than f(-0.25).
