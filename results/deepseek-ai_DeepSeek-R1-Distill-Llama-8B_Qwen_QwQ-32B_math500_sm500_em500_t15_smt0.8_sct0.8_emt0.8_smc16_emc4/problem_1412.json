            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of water one cylindrical beaker can hold. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the radius of the beaker is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, plugging these values into the formula gives V = \u03c0 * 3\u00b2 * 8 = 72\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3. With a radius of 6 cm, the volume becomes V = (4/3)\u03c0 * 6\u00b3 = (4/3)\u03c0 * 216 = 288\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\nFinally, to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the total volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker. So, the number of beakers required is 288\u03c0 / 72\u03c0 = 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n   Given:\n   - Radius of the beaker, \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   - Height of the beaker, \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n   Plug in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   where \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\n   Given:\n   - Radius of the tank, \\( R = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n   Plug in the values:\n   \\"
