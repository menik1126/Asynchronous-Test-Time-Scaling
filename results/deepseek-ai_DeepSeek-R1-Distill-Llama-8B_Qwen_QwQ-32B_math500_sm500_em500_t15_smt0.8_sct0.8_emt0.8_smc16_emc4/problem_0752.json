The problem states that for every positive integer \\( k \\), two things hold:\n\n1. The subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) forms a geometric sequence.\n2. The subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) forms an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAnd we're given that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\). The task is to find \\( a_1 \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by breaking down what a geometric sequence and an arithmetic sequence are. In a geometric sequence, each term is a multiple of the previous term by a common ratio \\( r \\). So, if I have three terms \\( b, c, d \\) in a geometric sequence, then \\( c = br \\) and \\( d = cr = b r^2 \\).\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, each term is a difference from the previous term by a common difference \\( d \\). So, if I have three terms \\( c, d, e \\) in an arithmetic sequence, then \\( d = c + d \\) and \\( e = c + 2d \\).\n\nGiven that, let's try to write down the conditions for each \\( k \\).\n\nFor each \\( k \\), starting from 1, the following must hold:\n\n- \\( a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \\times r_k \\) (since it's a geometric sequence)\n- \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} \\times r_k \\) (continuation of the geometric sequence)\n- \\( a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k \\) (since it's an arithmetic sequence)\n- \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k \\) (continuation of the arithmetic sequence)\n\nWait, so we can relate \\( a_{2k+1} \\) in two ways: once from the geometric sequence and once from the arithmetic sequence.

So, since \\( r_1 \\) is integer \u2265 2, \\( \\frac{1}{r_1} \\) is \u2264 1/2.\n\nThus, \\( r_2 \\) is between \\( 2 - 1/2 = 1.5 \\) and 2.\n\nWait, but \\( r_2 \\) has to be rational because \\( a_4 \\) and \\( a_3 \\) are integers. Therefore, \\( r_2 \\) must be a rational number.\n\nBut since \\( r_2 = \\frac{2 r_1 - 1}{r_1} = \\frac{2 r_1 - 1}{r_1} \\), which simplifies to \\( 2 - 1/r_1 \\). So, for \\( r_2 \\) to be rational, \\( r_1 \\) must be such that \\( 1/r_1 \\) is rational, which it is because \\( r_1 \\) is integer.\n\nWait, but \\( r_2 \\) is \\( 2 - 1/r_1 \\), so since \\( r_1 \\) is integer \u2265 2, \\( r_2 \\) can be expressed as a fraction.\n\nBut perhaps \\( r_2 \\) is also an integer because \\( a_4 \\) is an integer. So, if \\( r_2 \\) is integer, then \\( (2 r_1 - 1)/r_1 \\) must be integer.
