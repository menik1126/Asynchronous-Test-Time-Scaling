            "output": "To determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of 31 divided by 11,111, I'll start by understanding the problem. The fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) will likely result in a repeating decimal because the denominator doesn't have any factors other than 1 and 11, and 11 is a prime number.\n\nNext, I'll use the concept of the length of the repeating period in a decimal expansion. For a denominator that's a product of powers of primes, the length of the repeating period is determined by the maximum power of those primes that appear in the factorization.\n\nIn this case, since the denominator is \\(11^4\\), the length of the repeating period should be 4. This means that the decimal will repeat every four digits. Therefore, the number of digits that repeat in this repeating decimal is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction and Denominator:**\n   - The fraction given is \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\).\n   - The denominator is \\(11111\\), which factors into \\(11^4\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Length of the Repeating Period:**\n   - For a fraction of the form \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), where \\(b\\) is a product of powers of primes, the length of the repeating period is determined by the highest power of those primes.\n   - In this case, the highest power of 11 in the denominator is \\(11^4\\), so the repeating period will have 4 digits.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) will have a repeating period of 4 digits.\n\n\\boxed{4}"
