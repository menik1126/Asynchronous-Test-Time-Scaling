The question is about cutting it with a plane that's parallel to edges AB and CD and lies halfway between them. Then, I need to find the surface area of one of the resulting pieces.\n\nHmm, first, let me visualize a regular tetrahedron. It has four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so each edge is length 2. Now, the plane in question is parallel to two edges: AB and CD. Since AB and CD are opposite edges, they don't intersect. In a regular tetrahedron, opposite edges are skew lines, meaning they don't lie on the same plane and don't intersect.\n\nSo, the plane is halfway between AB and CD. That probably means the plane is equidistant from both edges. But how does that plane cut the tetrahedron? It must intersect some faces of the tetrahedron, creating a cross-section which is a polygon, likely a quadrilateral or triangle.\n\nWait, the plane is parallel to both AB and CD. Since AB and CD are skew lines, a plane parallel to both would be... Hmm, maybe that plane intersects other edges or parts of the tetrahedron?\n\nAlternatively, since ABCD is regular, symmetry might help here. If the plane is halfway between AB and CD, then perhaps it's located at the midpoint of the line connecting AB and CD. But I'm not exactly sure how to find that.\n\nLet me think of coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron's vertices could help. That way, I can find the equation of the plane and see where it cuts the edges.\n\nOkay, how do I assign coordinates to a regular tetrahedron? One common way is to place the vertices such that one vertex is at the origin, and others are placed symmetrically.\n\nWait, perhaps a better coordinate system is to center the tetrahedron or align it in a way that makes calculations easier. But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, I can place vertex A at (0,0,0), vertex B at (2,0,0), vertex C somewhere in the xy-plane, and vertex D above the xy-plane.\n\nBut to make it regular, all edges must be length 2. Let me recall that in a regular tetrahedron, the coordinates"

But maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps place the base ABC on the xy-plane, with A at (0,0,0), B at (2,0,0), and C at (1, sqrt(3), 0). That forms an equilateral triangle in the xy-plane. Then the fourth vertex D would be above the centroid of ABC.\n\nThe centroid of ABC is at ( (0+2+1)/3, (0 + 0 + sqrt(3))/3, 0 ), which simplifies to (1, (sqrt(3)/3), 0). The height h of the tetrahedron can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The edge length is 2, so the distance from D to the centroid must satisfy sqrt( (distance from centroid to A)^2 + h^2 ) = 2.\n\nFirst, compute the distance from centroid to A. Coordinates of centroid are (1, sqrt(3)/3, 0). A is (0,0,0). The distance squared is (1)^2 + (sqrt(3)/3)^2 = 1 + (1/3) = 4/3. Therefore, sqrt(4/3) = (2)/sqrt(3). Then, since edge length is 2, the height h must satisfy sqrt( ( (2)/sqrt(3) )^2 + h^2 ) = 2.\n\nCalculating:\n\n(4/3) + h² = 4\n\nTherefore, h² = 4 - 4/3 = 8/3 ⇒ h = 2*sqrt(6)/3 ≈ 1.632.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D can be (1, sqrt(3)/3, 2*sqrt(6)/3 ).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved, but okay. Let me confirm this.

Maybe using coordinates is the way to go.\n\nFirst, let me write equations for edges AB and CD.\n\nEdge AB is from A(0,0,0) to B(2,0,0).

So, we need to find the intersection of this plane with the tetrahedron's faces.\n\nSince the plane is parallel to edges AB and CD, it should intersect the other edges or faces.\n\nWait, actually, the plane is parallel to two edges, so it might not intersect those edges.\n\nGiven the plane equation is 2sqrt(6)y + 2sqrt(3)z = 3sqrt(2).\n\nThe tetrahedron has four faces: ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD.\n\nWe can check where the plane intersects each face.\n\nFirst, let's see if the plane intersects face ABC, which is the base on the xy-plane (z=0). The plane equation at z=0 becomes 2sqrt(6)y = 3sqrt(2) ⇒ y = (3sqrt(2))/(2sqrt(6)) = (3sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))/(2*6) ) Hmm, wait:\n\nWait, 2sqrt(6)y = 3sqrt(2) ⇒ y = (3sqrt(2))/(2sqrt(6)).\n\nSimplify sqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(2/6) = sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3). So,\n\ny = (3 * 1/sqrt(3)) / 2 = (sqrt(3))/2 ≈ 0.866.\n\nBut in face ABC, the y-coordinates range from 0 to sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. So, y = sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866, which is between 0 and sqrt(3), so the plane intersects face ABC along the line where y = sqrt(3)/2 and z=0.\n\nSimilarly, check other faces.\n\nFace ABD: points A(0,0,0), B(2,0,0), D(1, sqrt(3)/3, 2sqrt(6)/3).\n\nDoes the plane intersect this face? Let's parametrize face ABD.\n\nWe can write the parametric equations for face ABD as:\n\nA point on ABD can be expressed as A + u*(B - A) + v*(D - A), where u, v ≥ 0 and u"

The cross-section has area 1.\n\nHmm, so the cross-section area is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the original faces.\n\nLet me consider one of the pieces. Let's choose the piece that contains vertex A, for example. Wait, but actually, since the plane is halfway between AB and CD, the two pieces are symmetric with respect to the plane. So, perhaps each piece has the same surface area. But to confirm, let's pick one piece and compute its surface area.\n\nLet me choose the piece that contains vertex A. Let's see which original faces are on that side.\n\nThe plane cuts the tetrahedron into two parts. The piece containing A would have the original faces ABC, ABD, and ACD, but only the parts of those faces on the side of the plane closer to A.\n\nWait, but actually, the plane is cutting through edges AC, AD, BC, BD. So, the piece containing A would have the regions of the faces ABC, ABD, ACD that are on the side of the plane closer to A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each face and determine which portion is on the chosen piece.\n\nLet me consider each face:\n\n1. Face ABC: This face is in the base (z=0). The plane intersects this face along the line between P3(1/2, sqrt(3)/2,0) and P4(3/2, sqrt(3)/2,0). So, the portion of face ABC on the side of the piece containing A would be the region below this line (since"
