The polynomial is given by:\n\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\n\nThey told me that $a_n = 2$ and $a_0 = 66$. Also, all the roots of this polynomial are distinct integers. The question is asking for the least possible value of $|a_{n-1}|$.\n\nHmm, okay. Since the polynomial has integer coefficients and all its roots are distinct integers, I can probably express it in its factored form. If a polynomial has integer roots, then it can be written as a product of linear factors with integer roots. So, if the roots are $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n$, then the polynomial can be expressed as:\n\n$$f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n)$$\n\nBecause the leading coefficient is 2, which is an integer. That makes sense.\n\nNow, expanding this product will give me the standard form of the polynomial, where the coefficients are integers. So, if I can write $f(x)$ in this factored form, I can relate it back to the standard form to find $a_{n-1}$.\n\nGiven that $a_0 = 66$, which is the constant term, that should be equal to the product of the roots times the leading coefficient, but with a sign. Let me recall Vieta's formulas. For a monic polynomial, the constant term is $(-1)^n$ times the product of the roots. But since our polynomial isn't monic, it's leading coefficient is 2, so I think the constant term is $(-1)^n \\times 2 \\times r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n$. \n\nGiven that $a_0 = 66$, so:\n\n$$66 = (-1)^n \\times 2 \\times r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n$$\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n$$2 \\times r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = (-1)^n \\times 66$$\n\nSo, $r_1 r_2 \\cdots r"

Since 66 divided by 2 is 33, but with the sign according to (-1)^n. So, if n is even, the product is 33, and if n is odd, the product is -33. Got it.\n\nSo, I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33. Hmm. But 33 isn't that big, so the roots can't be too large.\n\n33 factors into 1, 3, 11, 33. So, the possible roots would be combinations of these numbers, considering both positive and negative factors because roots can be negative as well.\n\nWait, but since the product is 33 or -33, I need to choose roots such that their product is 33 or -33, and all roots are distinct integers.\n\nI should aim to find such roots so that when I expand the polynomial, the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$, which is $a_{n-1}$, is minimized in absolute value.\n\nSo, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, which is the absolute value of the coefficient of x^{n-1}, I need to choose roots such that when I expand the product, this coefficient is as small as possible.\n\nBut how does the coefficient of x^{n-1} relate to the roots? Using Vieta's formula again, the coefficient $a_{n-1}$ is equal to (-1)^{1} times the sum of the products of the roots taken 1 at a time, multiplied by the leading coefficient. Wait, more precisely, since the polynomial is:\n\n$$f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n)$$\n\nExpanding this, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is equal to 2 times (-1) times the sum of the roots. So, $a_{n-1} = -2(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n)$. Therefore, to find |a_{n-1}|, we can compute | -2(r1 + r"

So, the problem reduces to finding distinct integers r1, r2, ..., rn such that their product is either 33 or -33 (depending on n's parity), and the absolute value of their sum is as small as possible.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find a set of distinct integers with product ±33, and with the smallest possible absolute sum. Then, multiply that sum by 2 and take absolute value, and find the minimal such value.\n\nSo, first, let's consider the possible factorizations of 33 and -33 into distinct integers.

What's the sum? 1 -1 + 3 -11 = -8.\n\nSimilarly, another possible set.\n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. 1 + (-1) + 3 + (-11) = (1 -1) + (3 -11) = 0 + (-8) = -8.\n\nSo, the sum is -8.
