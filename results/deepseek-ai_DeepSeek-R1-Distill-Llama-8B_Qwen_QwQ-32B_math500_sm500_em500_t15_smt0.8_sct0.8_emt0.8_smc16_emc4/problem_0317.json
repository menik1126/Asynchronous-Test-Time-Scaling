I look for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5, which are -7 and +2. So, the denominator factors as \\( (x - 7)(x + 2) \\).\n\nThis means the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Adding these, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\), giving \\( a + b = 5 \\).\n\nNext, to determine the horizontal asymptote, I compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator has degree 1, and the denominator has degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote is at \\( y = 0 \\).\n\nFinally, adding the sum of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote value, we get \\( 5 + 0 = 5 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll analyze the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\) step by step.\n\n### **Step 1: Find the Vertical Asymptotes**\n\nVertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero (provided the numerator isn't also zero there). Let's factor the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\nSo, the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Therefore:\n\\[\na = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = 7\n\\]\n\\[\na + b = (-2) + 7 = 5\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Find the Horizontal Asymptote**\n\nHorizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and denominator:\n- The **numerator** has degree **1**.\n- The **denominator** has degree **2**.\n\nSince the denominator has a higher degree, the horizontal asymptote is at \\( y = 0 \\). Thus, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate \\( a + b + c \\)**\n\n\\[\na + b + c"
