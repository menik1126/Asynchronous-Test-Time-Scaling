            "output": "To determine the number of trailing zeros in 42!, I need to account for the factors of 10 in the factorial. A trailing zero is produced by a factor of 10, which is the product of 2 and 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nI'll start by identifying how many multiples of 5 are present in the numbers from 1 to 42. Each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5 to the prime factorization.\n\nThere are 42 divided by 5, which equals 8.4. Taking the integer part, there are 8 multiples of 5.\n\nHowever, some numbers contribute more than one 5. Specifically, multiples of 25 (which is 5 squared) contribute an additional 5. In the range from 1 to 42, 25 is the only such number.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 + 1 = 9 fives in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nNext, I'll identify the number of 2s in the prime factorization. Since there are more multiples of 2 than 5, the number of 2s will be higher.\n\nDividing 42 by 2 gives 21.\nDividing 42 by 4 gives 10.5, so 10.\nDividing 42 by 8 gives 5.25, so 5.\nDividing 42 by 16 gives 2.625, so 2.\nDividing 42 by 32 gives 1.3125, so 1.\nAdding these up: 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39.\n\nSince there are more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is determined by the number of 5s, which is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) (42 factorial), we need to count the number of times the factor 10 appears in the product. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), each trailing zero is produced by a pair of these factors. \n\n**Step 1: Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\)**  \n- Every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5.\n- There are \\(\\left\\lf"
