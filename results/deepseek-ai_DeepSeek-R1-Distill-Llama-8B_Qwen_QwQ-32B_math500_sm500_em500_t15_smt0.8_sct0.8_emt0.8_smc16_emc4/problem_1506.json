            "output": "First, I need to determine how many choices are available for each part of the license plate.\n\nThe license plate consists of 4 characters: two letters and two numbers.\n\nFor the letters, there are 26 different letters in the English alphabet, and each letter can be either uppercase or lowercase. However, since the problem specifies 2 different letters, I can assume that the case doesn't matter, so there are 26 possible choices for each letter.\n\nFor the numbers, there are 10 digits (0 through 9), and each digit can be used only once in the license plate.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total number of possible license plates by multiplying the number of choices for each part together.\n\nLetters: 26 options for the first letter, 25 options for the second letter.\n\nNumbers: 10 options for the first number, 9 options for the second number.\n\nSo, the total number of license plates is 26 * 25 * 10 * 9.\n\nCalculating that gives me 26 * 25 = 650 and 10 * 9 = 90. Multiplying these together: 650 * 90 = 58,500.\n\nTherefore, there are 58,500 possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Structure of the License Plate**\n- **Letters**: 2 different letters from A to Z (26 letters in total).\n- **Numbers**: 2 different digits from 0 to 9 (10 digits in total).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Number of Possible Combinations for Each Part**\n\n1. **Letters Part**:\n   - **First Letter**: 26 possible choices.\n   - **Second Letter**: Since it must be different from the first letter, there are \\(26 - 1 = 25\\) remaining choices.\n\n2. **Numbers Part**:\n   - **First Number**: 10 possible choices.\n   - **Second Number**: Since it must be different from the first number, there are \\(10 - 1 = 9\\) remaining choices.\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the Number of Choices for Each Part**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total license plates} = \\text{Letters combinations} \\times \\text{Numbers combinations} = 26 \\times 25 \\times 10 \\times 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculations**\n\n"
