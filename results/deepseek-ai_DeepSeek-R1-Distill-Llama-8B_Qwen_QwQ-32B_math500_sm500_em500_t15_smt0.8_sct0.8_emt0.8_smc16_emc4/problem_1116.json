            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where the value of y varies inversely as the square root of x. Hmm, inversely as... I remember that inverse variation means that as one thing increases, the other decreases proportionally. But let me think about the exact formula for inverse variation.\n\nInverse variation is usually represented as y = k / x, where k is a constant. But in this case, it's not just y varying inversely with x, but with the square root of x. So I guess the formula must be something like y = k divided by sqrt(x), right? Because instead of x, it's sqrt(x), so the relationship is adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe problem says that when x is 24, y is 15. So I can plug these values into the equation to find the constant k. Let me write that down: 15 = k / sqrt(24). I need to solve for k. To do that, I can multiply both sides by sqrt(24). So k = 15 * sqrt(24).\n\nWait, sqrt(24) can be simplified, right? Because 24 is 4 times 6, and sqrt(4*6) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(6), which is 2*sqrt(6). So substituting back, k = 15 * 2 * sqrt(6) = 30*sqrt(6). Got it, so the constant k is 30 times the square root of 6.\n\nNow, the question is asking for x when y is 3. So I need to set up the equation again with the new y value. Plugging in y=3, we have 3 = 30*sqrt(6) divided by sqrt(x). \n\nTo solve for x, I should rearrange this equation. Let's rewrite it as sqrt(x) = 30*sqrt(6) divided by 3. Dividing 30 by 3 gives 10, so sqrt(x) = 10*sqrt(6). Now, to find x, I need to square both sides of the equation. \n\nSo, x = (10*sqrt(6))^2. Squaring 10 gives 100, and squaring sqrt(6) gives 6. Multiplying those together, x = 100*6 = 600. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from"

Then, simplifying sqrt(24) to 2*sqrt(6), so k = 30*sqrt(6). Then, with y=3, so 3 = 30*sqrt(6)/sqrt(x), leading to sqrt(x) = 10*sqrt(6), and x = 600. That seems right.\n\nI think I got it.
