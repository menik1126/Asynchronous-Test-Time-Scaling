            "output": "First, I recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nFrom the problem, the volume is given as 45π cubic centimeters.\n\nThe radius r is provided in the diagram as 3 centimeters.\n\nI can substitute the known values into the volume formula:\n\n45π = π * (3)² * h\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n45π = π * 9 * h\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides of the equation by π to eliminate it:\n\n45 = 9h\n\nThen, I'll divide both sides by 9 to solve for h:\n\nh = 5\n\nSo, the height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder and need to find its height \\( h \\). The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n- \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n**Given:**\n- \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters,\n- \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters.\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation by calculating \\( (3)^2 \\).\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi \\cdot 9 \\cdot h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** To solve for \\( h \\), divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\pi \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Finally, divide both sides by 9 to isolate \\( h \\).\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The height of the cylinder is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) centimeters."
