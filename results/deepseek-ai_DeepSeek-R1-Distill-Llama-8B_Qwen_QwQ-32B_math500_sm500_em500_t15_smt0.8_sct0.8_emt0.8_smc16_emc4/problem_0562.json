There are 5 Democrats, so the number of ways they can arrange themselves around the table is (5-1)! which is 24. This accounts for the circular arrangement of the Democrats.\n\nNext, I'll fix the position of the Democrats relative to the table to remove the rotational symmetry. Once the Democrats are seated, the Republicans must sit together as well. There are 5 Republicans, so their arrangement is also (5-1)! which is 24.\n\nFinally, the Independent can sit anywhere around the table. Since the Democrats and Republicans are already seated in blocks, the Independent has only 10 possible positions to choose from.\n\nMultiplying these possibilities together, I'll get the total number of distinct seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for the Senate committee around a circular table, where all members of each party must sit together, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix the Position of One Party**: Since the table is circular, we can fix the position of one party to eliminate rotational symmetry. Let's fix the Democrats.\n\n2. **Arrange the Members of the Fixed Party**: There are 5 Democrats, so they can be arranged in \\((5-1)! = 4! = 24\\) ways around the table.\n\n3. **Arrange the Members of the Second Party**: Next, the Republicans must sit together. There are 5 Republicans, so they can be arranged in \\((5-1)! = 4! = 24\\) ways.\n\n4. **Arrange the Independent**: The Independent can sit in any of the remaining seats. After placing the Democrats and Republicans, there are \\(5 + 5 = 10\\) seats left. Therefore, there are 10 possible positions for the Independent.\n\n5. **Multiply the Arrangements**: The total number of distinct seating arrangements is the product of the arrangements for each party and the positions for the Independent:\n   \\[\n   24 \\times 24 \\times 10 = 5760\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:"
