This is a quartic equation, which means it has four solutions. So, we're talking about a quadrilateral, right? Since a convex polygon with four vertices is a quadrilateral.\n\nBut before I can find the area, I need to figure out what these solutions look like in the complex plane. Maybe the equation can be factored? It has coefficients involving \\( i \\), so perhaps a substitution might help. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the equation, I notice that the coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. That seems like a pattern similar to the expansion of something like \\( (z + i)^4 \\). Let me check:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6 z^2 + 4i z + i^2 \\). Wait, that's \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6 z^2 + 4i z - 1 \\). But our equation is \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \\).

So, probably it's a quadrilateral.\n\nBut to find the area, we can use the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices in the complex plane. Alternatively, since all roots are related through rotations, maybe the polygon is a square or a rectangle or something symmetric.\n\nWait, another approach: If \\( z + i \\) are the fourth roots of \\( 1 - i \\), then each \\( z = -i + \\) a root. So, the points \\( z \\) are translations of the fourth roots of \\( 1 - i \\) by \\( -i \\).

So, each consecutive root is π/2 radians apart. So, the four points are equally spaced on the circle. So, when we subtract \\( i \\), the center moves from origin to \\( -i \\). So, the shape is a regular quadrilateral? Or maybe a square?\n\nWait, if they are equally spaced on the circle, then the polygon is a regular quadrilateral, which is a square.

But the center is at \\( -i \\), so the square is centered at \\( -i \\), but rotated?\n\nWait, but the angle of the first root is 7π/16, which is 78.75 degrees, so the first point is at 7π/16 from the positive real axis. The next is 15π/16, which is 15*11.25= 168.75 degrees, so each step is 8π/16 = π/2, so 90 degrees. So, the points are spaced every 90 degrees, so they form a square. But the center is at -i, so the square is shifted down by i, but the shape is still a square.\n\nWait, but the radius of the circle is 2^{1/8}, so the distance from the center to each vertex is 2^{1/8}. Therefore, the side length of the square can be calculated as the distance between two adjacent vertices. Since in a regular square, the side length s is related to the radius (distance from center to vertex) R by s = sqrt(2) * R. Wait, no, actually, in a regular polygon with n sides, the side length is 2 R sin(π/n). For a square, n=4, so s = 2 R sin(π/4) = 2 R (√2/2) = R√2. So, the side length is R√2. Therefore, the area of the square is s^2 = (R√2)^2 = 2 R^2.\n\nAlternatively, area of a regular polygon is (1/2) n R^2 sin(2π/n). For square, that would be (1/2)*4*R^2*sin(π/2) = 2 R^2 *1 = 2 R^2. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, if the radius is 2^{1/8}, then the area would be 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2*(2^{1/4}) = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, the center of the"

So, does that affect the area?\n\nI think no, because when you translate a figure, the area remains the same. So, the shape is a square with side length s = R√2, where R is the radius of the circle, which is 2^{1/8}. So, the side length would be 2^{1/8} * √2 = 2^{1/8} * 2^{1/2} = 2^{5/8}. Then, area would be (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4}.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because I'm confusing R as the radius from the center to the vertices. So, in a square, the distance from the center to a vertex is R, which is equal to (s√2)/2, which means R = s√2 / 2, so s = 2 R /√2 = √2 R. So, area is s^2 = ( sqrt(2) R )^2 = 2 R^2. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the area is 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2*2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}. So, that's 2^{5/4}, which can be written as 2^{1 1/4} or 2^{5/4}. So, is 2 a prime? Yes, 2 is prime.\n\nSo, the area is 2^{5/4}, so p=2, a=5, b=4. Then, a and b are co-prime, which they are. So, a + b + p = 5 +4 +2=11.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is the center of the polygon really at -i? Because each point z is -i + a root of 1 -i, so the centroid of the polygon would be the average of the roots. But in this case, since the roots are equally spaced, their centroid is at -i.

So, the polygon is a square rotated by some angle, but still a square with side length sqrt(2)*2^{1/8}?\n\nWait, but the distance between two adjacent vertices would be the chord length between two points on the circle separated by 90 degrees. The chord length is 2 R sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. So, theta is 90 degrees, so sin(45 degrees) = sqrt(2)/2. So chord length is 2 * 2^{1/8} * sqrt(2)/2 = 2^{1/8} * sqrt(2) = 2^{1/8} * 2^{1/2} = 2^{5/8}. So, the side length is 2^{5/8}, so area is (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4}, which is the same as before.
