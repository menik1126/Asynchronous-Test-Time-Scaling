            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation is \u221a\u00b3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16. I remember that when dealing with roots, especially cube roots, one useful strategy is to get rid of the radical by cubing both sides. That way, I can simplify the equation and solve for x more easily.\n\nSo, if I cube both sides, the left side becomes just (x\u00b2 - 4x + 4), and the right side becomes 16 cubed. Let me write that down:\n\nCube both sides:\n(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4)\u00b3 = 16\u00b3.\n\nOkay, now I need to compute 16\u00b3. I think 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Let me calculate that:\n\n256 * 16. Well, 256 * 10 is 2560, and 256 * 6 is 1536. Adding those together gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, 16\u00b3 is 4096. That means the equation simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but okay. Now, let me subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nHmm, so I have a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0. I need to solve for x. Since it's a quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [ -b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac) ] / (2a), where a = 1, b = -4, and c = -4092.\n\nLet me plug those values into the formula. First, calculate the discriminant, which is b\u00b2 - 4ac.\n\nCompute b\u00b2: (-4)\u00b2 = 16.\n\nCompute 4ac: 4 * 1 * (-4092) = -16368.\n\nSo, the discriminant is"

            "output": " 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding, so 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nNow, the square root of 16384. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that is off the top of my head. Let me think. I know that 128\u00b2 is 16384 because 128 * 128. Let me verify that:\n\n128 * 128: 100*100=10000, 100*28=2800, 28*100=2800, 28*28=784. So, 10000 + 2800 + 2800 + 784 = 16384. Yes, that's correct. So \u221a16384 = 128.\n\nThat makes the solution x = [4 \u00b1 128] / 2.\n\nWait, hold on. Because quadratic formula is [ -b \u00b1 \u221aD ] / (2a). Here, b is -4, so -b is 4. So, x = (4 \u00b1 128) / 2.\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128) / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66.\n\nSecond solution: (4 - 128) / 2 = (-124) / 2 = -62.\n\nBut the question asks for the positive value of x, so we're looking at 66.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the original equation: cube root of (x\u00b2 -4x +4) = 16.\n\nCubed both sides: x\u00b2 -4x +4 = 16\u00b3 = 4096. Yep, that's right.\n\nThen, quadratic equation: x\u00b2 -4x -4092 = 0.\n\nApplied quadratic formula: x = [4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 16368)] / 2. Wait, the discriminant was 16384, which is 128 squared. So, x = [4 \u00b1 128]/2.\n\nCalculations: 4 + 128 = 132, divided by 2 is 66. 4 - 128 is -124, divided by 2 is -62. So, positive solution is 66.\n\nLet me plug it back into the original equation to verify.\n\nCompute x\u00b2 -4x +4 when x = 66:\n\n66\u00b2 = 435"
