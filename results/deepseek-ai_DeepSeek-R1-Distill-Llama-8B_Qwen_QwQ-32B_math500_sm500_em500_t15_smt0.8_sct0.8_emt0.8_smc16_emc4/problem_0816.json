            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that ω being a cube root of unity means that it's a solution to the equation ω³ = 1. So, the cube roots of unity are the solutions to this equation. I recall that there are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω², where ω and ω² are the primitive roots, meaning they aren't equal to 1. So, ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I think the first step is to try to simplify this expression. Maybe I can combine the fractions or use some properties of complex numbers.\n\nLet me write down the expression again:\n\nS = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²)\n\nTo add these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Therefore, I can rewrite S as:\n\nS = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\nNumerator = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nSo, S = (2 + ω + ω²) / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to simplify the denominator. Let me multiply it out:\n\nDenominator = (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 * 1 + 1 * ω² + ω * 1 + ω * ω²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1 * 1 = 1\n\n1 * ω² = ω²\n\nω * 1 = ω\n\nω * ω² = ω³\n\nWait, but ω³ is equal to 1, right? Because ω³ = 1 is given. So, ω³ = 1.\n\nSo, adding up all the terms in the"

So, the numerator and the denominator are the same. That would mean that S = 1, right? Because any non-zero number divided by itself is 1.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Is there any case where (2 + ω + ω²) could be zero? If that's the case, then S would be undefined or something else.\n\nBut I know that ω and ω² are roots of the equation x² + x + 1 = 0. Let me verify that. The minimal polynomial for the primitive cube roots of unity is x² + x + 1. So, yes, ω and ω² satisfy this equation.\n\nSo, plugging ω into x² + x + 1, we get:\n\nω² + ω + 1 = 0\n\nWhich means ω² + ω = -1\n\nSo, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (ω + ω²) = 2 - 1 = 1\n\nAh, so 2 + ω + ω² equals 1, not zero. Therefore, the denominator isn't zero. So, S = 1 / 1 = 1.\n\nWait, but hold on, another thought. Since we have two different roots, ω and ω², does this expression give the same value for both of them? Let me check with specific numbers.\n\nI know that the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω². Let me assign ω = (-1 + i√3)/2 and ω² = (-1 - i√3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) with these values.\n\nFirst, calculate 1 + ω:\n\n1 + ω = 1 + (-1 + i√3)/2 = (2 - 1 + i√3)/2 = (1 + i√3)/2\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1 - i√3)/2 = (1 - i√3)/2\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 + ω) is the reciprocal of (1 + i"

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):\n\n2*(1 - i√3)/[(1 + i√3)(1 - i√3)] = 2*(1 - i√3)/(1 + 3) = 2*(1 - i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2\n\nSecond term: 2/(1 - i√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i√3):\n\n2*(1 + i√3)/[(1 - i√3)(1 + i√3)] = 2*(1 + i√3)/4 = (1 + i√3)/2\n\nAdding the two terms:\n\n(1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = [1 - i√3 + 1 + i√3]/2 = (2)/2 = 1\n\nSo, that gives me 1. Hmm, so that's consistent with the previous result.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all possible values\". Since ω is a cube root of 1, but not equal to 1, so ω can be either ω or ω². But in both cases, the expression gives 1. So, is 1 the only possible value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if there's another case when ω is 1. But if ω is 1, then the expression would be 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Wait, even if ω is 1, the expression is still 1?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. If ω = 1, then the expression is 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1²) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So even when ω is 1, the expression is still 1. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity we take, the expression is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut the"

Maybe sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, there could be multiple values or something, but in this case, it seems like it's always equal to 1.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this problem from another angle. Since ω³ = 1, we can express ω in exponential form. The cube roots of unity are given by e^(2πik/3) where k = 0, 1, 2. So, for k=0, ω = 1, k=1, ω = e^(2πi/3), and k=2, ω = e^(4πi/3).\n\nBut perhaps using geometric series or another identity.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate, but since ω is a root of x² + x + 1 = 0, maybe I can use that.\n\nWait, I think the initial approach is solid. By combining the fractions, we get that the numerator and denominator are the same, which simplifies to 1. Since 2 + ω + ω² = 1, I can't get 0, so it's safe. Thus, S must be 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of the expression is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we recognize that \\(\\omega\\) is a cube root of unity, so the cube roots of unity are 1, \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) are the primitive roots.
