Since 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, I can set up a ratio to find the equivalent number of Blinkets.\n\nNext, I'll calculate how many Blinkets make up 56 Drinkets. By multiplying 56 Drinkets by the ratio of Blinkets to Drinkets (3 Blinkets per 7 Drinkets), I can find the number of Blinkets needed.\n\nOnce I have the number of Blinkets, I'll convert them to Trinkets. Knowing that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, I'll divide the total number of Blinkets by 4 to find the equivalent number of Trinkets.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer, which shows how many Trinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets in the land of Ink.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Conversions:**\n   - **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**\n   - **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**\n\n2. **Find the Relationship Between Drinkets and Blinkets:**\n   - Since **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**, we can find how many Blinkets are in 1 Drinket.\n   - \\[\n     1\\, \\text{Drinket} = \\frac{3\\, \\text{Blinkets}}{7\\, \\text{Drinkets}}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, **56 Drinkets** would equal:\n     \\[\n     56\\, \\text{Drinkets} \\times \\frac{3\\, \\text{Blinkets}}{7\\, \\text{Drinkets}} = 24\\, \\text{Blinkets}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:**\n   - Since **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**, we can find how many Trinkets are in 24 Blinkets.\n   - \\[\n     24\\, \\text{Blinkets} \\div 4\\, \\text{Blinkets per Trinket} = 6\\, \\text{Trinkets}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"
