            "output": "To determine the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime components.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 84 by 2 to get 42, then divide by 2 again to obtain 21. Next, I'll divide 21 by 3 to get 7, and finally, divide 7 by 7 to reach 1. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nMy goal is to combine these prime factors into distinct integers such that their product is 84, and their sum is as small as possible. I'll consider breaking down the factors into different groupings.\n\nOne approach is to keep the numbers as close to each other as possible because the sum tends to be minimized when the numbers are balanced rather than having a large or small number. \n\nConsidering the prime factors, I can create groups like 2 and 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7, which gives me the numbers 2 and 42. However, the sum of these numbers is 44, which seems quite high.\n\nAlternatively, I can try combining the factors differently. If I group 2 \u00d7 3 and 2 \u00d7 7, I get 6 and 14. Their product is still 84, and the sum is 20, which is lower than 44.\n\nTo further reduce the sum, I can look for more balanced groupings. If I use 2 \u00d7 2, 3, and 7, I get the numbers 4, 3, and 7. These are all distinct and their product is 84. Their sum is 14, which is even lower.\n\nSince 4, 3, and 7 are all prime factors or products of smaller primes, there isn't a way to have smaller distinct integers while maintaining the product of 84. Therefore, the least possible sum is 14.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we can break down 84 into its prime factors and then combine them optimally.\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 84**\n- \\( 84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\)\n\n**Step 2: Find Sets of Distinct Integers**\nWe need to split the prime factors into different groups to form distinct integers.\n\n- **Option "

Their product is \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 7 = 84\\), and their sum is \\(3 + 4 + 7 = 14\\).\n  - Another combination: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) and \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\), resulting in \\(\\{6, 14\\}\\).

Their sum is \\(7 + 12 = 19\\), still higher than 14.\n\n**Step 3: Verify No Smaller Sum Exists**\n- The set \\(\\{3, 4, 7\\}\\) uses all prime factors without duplicates and has the smallest sum found. Testing other groupings (e.g., including 1) would either exceed the product or increase the sum:\n  - Including 1: \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 14 = 84\\), but the sum \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 14 = 20\\) is larger.\n\nThus, the minimal sum is achieved with the set \\(\\{3, 4, 7\\}\\).\n\n\\boxed{14}"
