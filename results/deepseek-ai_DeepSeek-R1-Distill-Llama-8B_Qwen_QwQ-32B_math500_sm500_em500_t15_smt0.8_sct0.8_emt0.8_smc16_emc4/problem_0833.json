Hmm, okay, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function looks like. The numerator is \\(x - y\\), which suggests that if I make \\(x\\) larger than \\(y\\), the numerator becomes positive. On the other hand, if \\(x\\) is smaller than \\(y\\), the numerator is negative. Since we're looking for the maximum value, I probably want the numerator to be positive. That means I should focus on cases where \\(x > y\\). \n\nNow, the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\). Both \\(x^4\\) and \\(y^4\\) are always non-negative because any real number raised to an even power is positive or zero. So the denominator is definitely always positive, which means the function is defined for all real \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). That's good to know.\n\nSince both the numerator and denominator involve \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), maybe I can simplify the expression by expressing one variable in terms of the other. Let me try setting \\(y = kx\\), where \\(k\\) is a real number. That way, I can express everything in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(k\\), which might make it easier to handle.\n\nSubstituting \\(y = kx\\) into the expression, the numerator becomes \\(x - kx = x(1 - k)\\). The denominator becomes \\(x^4 + (k x)^4 + 6 = x^4 + k^4 x^4 + 6 = x^4(1 + k^4) + 6\\). So the entire expression simplifies to \\(\\frac{x(1 - k)}{x^4(1 + k^4) + 6}\\).\n\nHmm, this looks a bit more manageable. Now, let's denote \\(t = x\\). Since \\(x\\) can be any real number, \\(t\\) can also be any real number. So the expression becomes \\(\\frac{t(1 - k)}{t^4(1 + k^4) + 6}\\). But wait, I"

But it's a bit difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use AM-GM inequality?\n\nNote that for positive numbers, but since x and y can be any real numbers, perhaps I can bound the fraction.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe expression is \\(\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 +6}\\).\n\nLet me try to write x - y as numerator, denominator is x^4 + y^4 +6.\n\nPerhaps I can bound the denominator from below.\n\nSince x^4 + y^4 \u2265 (x^2 + y^2)^2 / 2 by Cauchy-Schwarz? Wait no, actually, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that x^4 + y^4 \u2265 (x^2 + y^2)^2 / 2 is not correct.
