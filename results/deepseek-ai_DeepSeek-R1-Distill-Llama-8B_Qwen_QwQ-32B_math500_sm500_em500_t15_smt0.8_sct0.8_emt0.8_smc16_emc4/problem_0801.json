The problem says that all the roots are distinct integers, and specifically, \\( a_n = 2 \\) and \\( a_0 = 66 \\). I need to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nHmm, so since all the roots are distinct integers, the polynomial can be factored as \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), where each \\( r_i \\) is an integer. Given that \\( a_0 = 66 \\), which is the constant term, that should equal \\( 2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\). So \\( (-1)^n \\times 2 \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 66 \\).\n\nFirst, I need to factorize 66 to find possible sets of roots. Let's factorize 66: 66 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11. These are all prime factors, so the possible sets of roots (since each root is an integer) would be combinations of these factors, possibly with negative signs because the product can be positive or negative, depending on the number of negative roots.\n\nWait, but 66 is positive. So, the product of the roots, \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\), multiplied by \\( (-1)^n \\) is 66. So, \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = \\frac{66}{(-1)^n} \\). Let me write that down: \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = (-1)^n \\times \\frac{66}{2} = (-1)^n \\times 33 \\).\n\nSo the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. Let me note that:\n\n- If n is even, product of roots is 33.\n- If n is odd, product of roots is -33.\n\nOkay, so my goal is to choose a set of distinct integers whose product is either"

Since the leading coefficient is 2, which is positive, the coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) is equal to \\( -2 \\times \\) (sum of roots). Wait, let me confirm that:\n\nThe expansion of \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n) \\), so expanding this, the coefficient of \\( x^{n-1} \\) is \\( -2(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n) \\).

So to minimize \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), I need to minimize \\( | \\sum_{i=1}^n r_i | \\).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing distinct integers \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\) such that their product is \u00b133 (depending on parity), and the sum of the roots has the smallest absolute value possible. Then, we multiply that sum by -2, and take the absolute value, so we need the minimal sum in absolute terms.\n\nNow, I need to think about the factors of 33. Since 33 factors into 1\u00d733, 3\u00d711, 3\u00d711\u00d71, but since we have to have distinct integers, and the roots must be distinct. Also, since coefficients are integers, the roots can be arranged with any signs, so negative numbers are allowed. That might help in getting smaller sums.\n\nSo first, let's note that 33 is 3\u00d711, so factors can be 1, 3, 11, 33, but since the roots have to multiply to 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n.

So if the product is 33, and n is even, then the number of negative roots must be even; if n is odd, the number of negative roots is odd.\n\nWait, actually, since f(x) has integer coefficients, the roots don't have to be integers necessarily? Wait, no, the problem says the roots are distinct integers, so all roots are integers, and they are distinct.\n\nSo each root is an integer, so in the factorization, each (x - r_i) corresponds to r_i being an integer. Thus, the product of roots is either 33 or -33, depending on n.\n\nSo now, our task is to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and find the set with the smallest possible sum in absolute value.\n\nLet me consider the possible sets of integer divisors of 33, keeping in mind that they have to be distinct.\n\nFirst, 33 = 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11, or 1 \u00d7 33. But 1 \u00d7 33 is only two factors, while 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11 is three factors.\n\nSimilarly, considering negative numbers, so we can also have -1 \u00d7 -3 \u00d7 33, but wait, that would give a product of -99, which is not 33 or -33. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, for 33, considering all possible ways:\n\nIf we need the product of roots to be 33 or -33, whatever.\n\nLet me enumerate all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 33:\n\n1.

Wait, (-1)*(-3)*11 = 3*11 = 33. Wait, so actually, that's still 3 roots with product 33. Alternatively, maybe 1, -3, -11, their product is (-3)*(-11)*1 = 33.

Alternatively, other factors like 1, -1, 3, 11; but that product would be (1)(-1)(3)(11) = -33. So the product depends on the number of negative numbers.

The idea is to choose the minimal number of roots to get the product, so that the sum can be minimized? Not necessarily, but maybe more roots could have a smaller sum? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to minimize the sum, we need as many small numbers as possible.
