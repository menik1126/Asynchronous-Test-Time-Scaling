Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Fix one person's position:**  \n   By fixing one person's seat, we eliminate rotational symmetry. This means we don't count arrangements that can be rotated into each other as distinct.\n\n2. **Arrange the remaining 7 people linearly around the table:**  \n   Since one position is fixed, the problem reduces to arranging the remaining 7 people in a linear sequence around the table. This is a permutation problem where order matters.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of permutations:**  \n   The number of ways to arrange 7 people in a line is given by the permutation formula \\( P(n, k) = n! \\) when \\( n = k \\).  \n   Here, \\( n = 7 \\) and \\( k = 7 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   P(7, 7) = 7! = 5040\n   \\]\n\n4. **Adjust for identical sides due to the square's symmetry:**  \n   However, in this case, each side must have exactly 2 people, and we've already fixed one position. The remaining 7 people can be arranged linearly without needing further adjustments.\n\n5. **Final"
