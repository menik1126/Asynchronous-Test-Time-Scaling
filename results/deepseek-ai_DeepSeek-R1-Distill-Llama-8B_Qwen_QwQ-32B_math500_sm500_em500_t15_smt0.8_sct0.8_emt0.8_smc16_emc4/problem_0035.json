            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\nProper divisors of a number are all the positive divisors excluding the number itself. So, I'll start by determining all the divisors of 284.\n\nI notice that 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. Therefore, 2 and 142 are divisors.\n\nNext, I'll check if 142 can be divided further. Dividing 142 by 2 yields 71. So, 71 is another proper divisor.\n\nNow, I need to verify if 71 is a prime number. Since 71 is only divisible by 1 and itself, it's a prime number. This means 71 is a proper divisor of 284.\n\nFinally, listing all the proper divisors of 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nAdding these together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 equals 220.\n\nSo, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Sum these proper divisors to get the first total.**\n3. **Find the proper divisors of this sum.**\n4. **Sum these second-level proper divisors to get the final answer.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Proper Divisors of 284**\n\nA **proper divisor** of a number \\( N \\) is a positive integer that divides \\( N \\) without leaving a remainder, excluding \\( N \\) itself.\n\nLet's list all proper divisors of 284:\n\n1. **1** (since every number is divisible by 1)\n2. **2** (284 is even)\n3. **4** (284 \u00f7 4 = 71)\n4. **71** (284 \u00f7 71 = 4)\n5. **142** (284 \u00f7 2 = 142)\n\n**Note**: 142 is also a proper divisor because it's less than 284.\n\n### **Step 2: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284**\n\nNow, let's add these proper divisors:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + "
