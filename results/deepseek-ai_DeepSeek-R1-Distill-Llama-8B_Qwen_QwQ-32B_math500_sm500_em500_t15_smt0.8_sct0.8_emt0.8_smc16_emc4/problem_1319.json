I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, since it's a rectangle, I know that opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The center O would be the intersection point of the diagonals. The ratio AB/AD = k suggests that the length of AB is k times the length of AD. Let me denote AB as the length of the rectangle and AD as the width. So, AB = k * AD. That means the rectangle is not necessarily a square; it could be longer in the AB direction.\n\nTo make things easier, maybe I can assign some coordinate system here. Let's place point O at the origin (0,0). Since O is the center, the coordinates of the vertices can be determined based on the lengths of AB and AD. If I let AB = 2a, then AD should be 2a/k because AB/AD = k, right? Wait, no, AB is k times AD, so if AB = k * AD, then if I let AD = b, then AB = k*b. But since O is the center, the rectangle extends a distance of AB/2 on either side along the x-axis and AD/2 on either side along the y-axis.\n\nSo, maybe I should define AB as 2a and AD as 2b, so that O is at (0,0), A is at (-a, b), B at (a, b), C at (a, -b), and D at (-a, -b). Yeah, that makes sense because the center would then be the midpoint between all these points.\n\nNow, the problem is about distances. I need to find the set of points inside the rectangle that are closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D. The probability will then be the area of this set divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, let me recall the distance formula. The distance from a point (x, y) to O (0,0) is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The distance to a vertex, say A (-a, b), would be sqrt((x + a)\u00b2 + ("

Similarly for the other vertices.\n\nThe condition for a point (x, y) to be closer to O than to A is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) < sqrt((x + a)\u00b2 + (y - b)\u00b2). To simplify this inequality, I can square both sides (since both sides are non-negative):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < (x + a)\u00b2 + (y - b)\u00b2\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 2a x + a\u00b2) + (y\u00b2 - 2b y + b\u00b2)\n\nSo, subtract left side from both sides:\n\n0 < 2a x + a\u00b2 - 2b y + b\u00b2\n\nWait, actually, let me rearrange the inequality:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 < x\u00b2 + 2a x + a\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2b y + b\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n0 < 2a x + a\u00b2 - 2b y + b\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n2a x - 2b y + (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) > 0\n\nHmm, that's the inequality for the region closer to O than to A. Similarly, I need to do this for all four vertices. But maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex. The set of points equidistant to O and a vertex is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining O and that vertex. The region closer to O than the vertex would be on one side of that bisector.\n\nTherefore, the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions closer to O than each vertex. So, I need to find the intersection of four regions, each defined by the perpendicular bisector between O and each vertex.\n\nLet me try to find the equations of these bisectors.\n\nStarting with vertex A (-a, b). The midpoint between O (0,0) and A (-a, b) is (-a/2, b/2). The slope of OA is (b - 0)/(-a - 0) = -b/a. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope of a/b (negative reciprocal). So, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is:\n\ny - b/2 = (a/b)(x + a"

From D: y = (-a/b)x - (a\u00b2)/(2b) - b/2\n\nThese four lines form the boundaries of the region closer to O than to any vertex. The intersection of the regions closer to O than each vertex will be bounded by these four lines. Therefore, the region we're interested in is the area inside the rectangle where all four inequalities are satisfied.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at these equations, it's quite symmetric.

Let me find the lines and their slopes.\n\nFor inequality 2: a x + b y = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2\n\nSlope is -a/b\n\nSimilarly, inequality 3: a x - b y = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2\n\nSlope is a/b\n\nInequalities 1 and 4 have slopes -a/b and a/b, same as inequalities 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the four lines are two pairs of parallel lines with slopes a/b and -a/b, but with different intercepts.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because if four lines include two sets of parallel lines, the region bounded by them would not be a polygon but an infinite strip between them. But since we're considering within the rectangle, perhaps it's bounded.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the shape formed by these four lines.\n\nAlternatively, the region defined by the four inequalities is a parallelogram whose sides are parallel to the lines a x + b y = c and a x - b y = c.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me consider the system:\n\n1. a x - b y > - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2\n2. a x + b y < (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2\n3. a x - b y < (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2\n4. a x + b y > - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2\n\nSo, from 1 and 3, the inequalities a x - b y is bounded between - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2 and (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2\n\nSimilarly, from 2 and 4, a x + b y is bounded between - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2 and (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/2\n\nTherefore, the region is a square in the (a x - b y) and (a x + b y) planes, but in the original (x, y) plane, it's a parallelogram.\n\nWait"
