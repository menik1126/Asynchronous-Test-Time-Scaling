But let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that each term on the left side has a similar structure: a constant numerator and a denominator that's a quadratic expression. Specifically, each denominator is of the form \\(x^2 - k\\), where k is 1, 2, 3, or 4. That might be useful later on.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nI need to find the sum of all complex solutions to this equation. Wait, complex solutions? So, this is a polynomial equation, but it's presented in a rational form. Since it's a rational equation, I might have to manipulate it to turn it into a polynomial equation, which will have roots that I can sum up.\n\nI remember that when dealing with equations of the form \\(f(x) = g(x)\\), to solve for x, we can subtract g(x) from both sides to get \\(f(x) - g(x) = 0\\), which is a polynomial equation. So, let me try that here.\n\nSubtracting \\(2010x - 4\\) from both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to combine all these terms into a single equation.

That is, \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). But that seems like a massive expression. Multiplying all of them would result in a very high-degree polynomial, which might not be manageable.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider the equation as a function:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4.\n\\]\n\nAnd set \\(f(x) = 0\\). To solve for x, cross-multiplying might be necessary. However, because of the multiple denominators, I might have to combine the fractions step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can substitute \\(y = x^2\\). That might simplify the denominators. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define \\(y = x^2\\). Then each denominator becomes \\(y - k\\) where k is 1, 2, 3, 4.

Hmm, but y is \\(x^2\\), so maybe not immediately helpful. Also, the right side still has a linear term in x, so this substitution alone doesn't eliminate x. Maybe this substitution isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about inverting both sides or manipulating the equation to get rid of the fractions.

Since the left side is even in x (since all terms are functions of \\(x^2\\)), but the right side is an odd function (since it's linear in x). Therefore, the equation is not symmetric. So, perhaps the solutions are not symmetric either. Hmm, but maybe that's a clue?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that if I let \\(x = 0\\), but plugging in x=0 would give me:\n\nLeft side: 1/(-1) + 2/(-2) + 3/(-3) + 4/(-4) = -1 -1 -1 -1 = -4.\n\nRight side: 0 -4 = -4.

So yes, x=0 is a solution. That's good to know. So x=0 is one solution. But the problem says \"sum of all complex solutions\", so maybe there are more solutions?\n\nBut how do I find the sum without finding all solutions?\n\nWait, perhaps Vieta's formula can be used here. Vieta's formula relates the sum of roots of a polynomial to its coefficients. But to use that, I need to have a polynomial equation. So, maybe I can manipulate the given equation into a polynomial equation, then find the sum of its roots.\n\nSo, let's try to do that.

Wait, no, quartic is degree 4, so multiplying by x gives degree 5? Wait, no, quartic is degree 4 in x, so multiplying by x gives degree 5? Wait, no, actually, D is (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). Each (x^2 -k) is degree 2, so four of them multiplied together is degree 8. So D is degree 8. Therefore, multiplying by x gives degree 9, and multiplying by a constant gives degree 8. Therefore, the entire term (2010x -4)*D is a degree 9 polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the entire left side after multiplying by D is:\n\n[sum of four degree 6 terms] - [degree 9 term] = 0.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes a degree 9 polynomial equation. \n\nTherefore, the equation is a 9th-degree polynomial equation. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is equal to the negative coefficient of x^8 divided by the coefficient of x^9, according to Vieta's formula. \n\nWait, Vieta's formula states that for a polynomial equation of the form:\n\na_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 = 0,\n\nthe sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in the polynomial obtained after multiplying through by D, then I can compute the sum of the roots. \n\nHowever, computing those coefficients directly seems very tedious.

But in this case, the polynomial after multiplying by D would have real coefficients because all the coefficients in the original equation are real. Therefore, complex roots will be in conjugate pairs, but the sum would still be real.\n\nBut let's get back to the main issue. How can I find the coefficients a9 and a8 in the polynomial after moving everything to one side and multiplying by D?\n\nIs there a better way than expanding all those terms? Maybe using substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the left-hand side before subtracting (2010x -4) is a function f(x) = sum of four terms. Then, the equation is f(x) - (2010x -4) = 0.\n\nBut to compute the polynomial equation f(x) - (2010x -4) = 0, which would result in a degree 9 equation, as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I can write f(x) as a single fraction, then subtract (2010x -4), and then combine everything.\n\nBut writing f(x) as a single fraction would require combining four different denominators, which would be complicated, but let's try.\n\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 -1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 -2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 -3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 -4}.\n\nLet me denote this as f(x).

Let's find the leading term of D. Each factor is x^2 -k, so when multiplied together, the leading term is x^2 * x^2 * x^2 * x^2 = x^8.
