            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out. Let me try to write it down first. \n\nSo, the equation is x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, my goal is to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. Since there's a square root, I remember that usually, the first step is to get rid of the square root by squaring both sides. But before I do that, maybe I should make sure that I understand the equation properly.\n\nFirst, let me think about the domain of this equation because the square root function has some restrictions. The expression inside the square root, which is 11 - 2x, has to be greater than or equal to zero. So, I can write that 11 - 2x \u2265 0. Solving for x, I get -2x \u2265 -11, which means x \u2264 11/2. So, x must be less than or equal to 5.5. That's important because any solution I find must satisfy this condition.\n\nOkay, now that I have the domain, I can proceed. The equation is x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. Let me try to isolate the square root term. So, I can subtract 4 from both sides to get x - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x). That seems like a good move.\n\nNow, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. So, (x - 4)^2 = (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2. Squaring both sides should eliminate the square root. Let me compute both sides.\n\nOn the left side, (x - 4)^2 expands to x^2 - 8x + 16. On the right side, the square of the square root is just the expression inside, so it becomes 11 - 2x. So, now my equation is x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x.\n\nHmm, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side to set it equal to zero. Subtracting 11 and adding 2x to both sides gives me x^2 - 8x + "

            "output": "16 - 11 + 2x = 0. Simplifying that, the constants 16 and -11 combine to 5, and the x terms: -8x + 2x is -6x. So, the equation becomes x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0.\n\nAlright, so I have a quadratic equation: x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. To solve this, I can try factoring it. Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Well, the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. Since the middle term is -6, both numbers should be negative. So, -1 and -5 multiply to 5 and add up to -6. So, the equation factors as (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 5.\n\nWait a minute, hold on. Earlier, I determined that x must be less than or equal to 5.5. Both 1 and 5 are less than 5.5, so that condition is satisfied. But wait, is that all? I should check my solutions in the original equation because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nLet me verify each solution in the original equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4.\n\nFirst, let's check x = 1. Plugging in, I get 1 = sqrt(11 - 2*1) + 4. That's 1 = sqrt(9) + 4. Since sqrt(9) is 3, it becomes 1 = 3 + 4, which is 1 = 7. That doesn't make sense. So, x = 1 is not a valid solution. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, let me check x = 5. Plugging in, I get 5 = sqrt(11 - 2*5) + 4. That's 5 = sqrt(11 - 10) + 4. So, sqrt(1) is 1. Therefore, it becomes 5 = 1 + 4, which is 5 = 5. That works. So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nSo, even though algebraically we got two solutions, one of them doesn't"

When I squared both sides, I might have introduced an extraneous solution, which is why checking is so important. So, step-by-step, I did isolate the square root, squared both sides, solved the quadratic, got two solutions, checked both, found one didn't work. So, that's the process.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the only solution is x = 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find all values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), we start by considering the domain of the equation.
