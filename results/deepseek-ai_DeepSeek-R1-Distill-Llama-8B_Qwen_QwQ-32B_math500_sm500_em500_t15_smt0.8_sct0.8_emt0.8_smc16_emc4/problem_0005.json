            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: there's a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. That's good to note. Now, the polynomial has a remainder R(x) when it's divided by (x - 1)(x - 4). Hmm, and when it's divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we're given that P(0) = 5, and we need to find P(5). \n\nAlright, let's start breaking this down. Since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, it can be written in the form P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, right? Because monic of degree 3 means the coefficient of x\u00b3 is 1. So, P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c. \n\nNow, when you divide a polynomial by a quadratic, the remainder will be of degree less than 2, so it's linear or constant. So, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x), which is linear. Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), also linear.\n\nI remember that the Remainder Theorem can help here. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of a polynomial P(x) divided by (x - k) is P(k). But here, we're dividing by a quadratic, so we need a generalization of that. \n\nWait, actually, when dividing by a quadratic, the remainder can be expressed as a linear polynomial, R(x) = mx + n. So, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Thus, P(1) = R(1) and P(4) = R(4). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So, P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3). \n\nSo, we have four equations:\n1. P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n3. P(2)"

Since P(x) is a cubic, and R(x) is linear, these equations should help me solve for the coefficients a, b, c, m, n.\n\nAlso, since P(0) = 5, that gives me another equation: P(0) = c = 5.\n\nSo, c is known: c = 5. So, P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + 5.\n\nNow, let's note that R(x) = mx + n, so R(1) = m + n, R(2) = 2m + n, R(3) = 3m + n, R(4) = 4m + n.\n\nSo, from equations 1-4:\n1. P(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = 6 + a + b = m + n\n2. P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 69 + 16a + 4b = 4m + n\n3. P(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = 13 + 4a + 2b = 2*(2m + n) = 4m + 2n\n4.
