            "output": "Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. Okay, so we have a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So, it should look something like \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants we need to find.\n\nThe problem states that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). Similarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we're given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall the Remainder Theorem and Polynomial Division concepts. Since \\( P(x) \\) is divided by a quadratic polynomial each time, the remainder should be of degree less than 2, so it's a linear polynomial. Let's denote the remainder when dividing by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) as \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). Similarly, when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n \\).\n\nSo, we can write two equations based on the Remainder Theorem. For the first division, the remainder is \\( R(1) = m(1) + n \\) and \\( R(4) = m(4) + n \\). But wait, actually, the Remainder Theorem tells us that the remainder when dividing by a linear factor is \\( P(k) = R(k) \\) where \\( k \\) is the root. But here, we are dividing by a quadratic, so the remainder is linear. So, I think the correct approach is to set up the equation where \\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x) \\) and \\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x) \\), where \\( Q1(x"

Maybe another approach. Let's evaluate \\( P(x) \\) at the roots of each divisor. So, since \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) has roots at 1 and 4, plugging \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\) into \\( P(x) \\) should give us \\( R(1) \\) and \\( R(4) \\) respectively. Similarly, for the other divisor \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), plugging \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\) should give us \\( 2R(2) \\) and \\( 2R(3) \\).\n\nWait, let's write that out more precisely.\n\nFrom division by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), we get:\n\n\\( P(1) = R(1) \\)\n\n\\( P(4) = R(4) \\)\n\nSimilarly, from division by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\):\n\n\\( P(2) = 2R(2) \\)\n\n\\( P(3) = 2R(3) \\)\n\nSo, we can write four equations:\n\n1. \\( P(1) = R(1) = m(1) + n = m + n \\)\n2. \\( P(4) = R(4) = 4m + n \\)\n3. \\( P(2) = 2R(2) = 2(2m + n) = 4m + 2n \\)\n4. \\( P(3) = 2R(3) = 2(3m + n) = 6m + 2n"
