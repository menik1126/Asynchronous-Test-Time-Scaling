            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to factor the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) into a product of monic polynomials with integer coefficients, and then compute the sum of \\(p_i(1)\\) for each factor. Hmm, okay. Let's start by understanding what the problem is asking for.\n\nFirst, the given polynomial is an eighth-degree polynomial, so it's quite high. It's written as \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). I notice that the exponents are even, which suggests that maybe a substitution could simplify this. Let me try substituting \\(y = x^4\\). Then the polynomial becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\).\n\nNow, that's a quadratic in terms of \\(y\\). Maybe I can factor this quadratic. Let me see: looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because \\(4 \\times (-1) = -4\\) and \\(4 + (-1) = 3\\). So, the quadratic factors as \\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\). \n\nSubstituting back \\(y = x^4\\), we get \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). So, the original polynomial factors into \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). That's a start.\n\nNext, I notice that \\(x^4 - 1\\) is a difference of squares since \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and 1 is \\(1^2\\). So it can be factored further as \\((x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1)\\). Now, \\(x^2 - 1\\) is again a difference of squares, so it factors into \\((x + 1)(x - 1)\\). So putting it all together, we have:\n\n\\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1)\\).\n\nSo far, that's four factors: two quadratics and two linear terms. Wait, but the problem mentions that each \\(p_i(x)\\) is monic, which these all are, and cannot"

The quadratic \\(x^2 + 1\\) is also irreducible over the integers because it doesn't have real roots (discriminant \\(0 - 4 = -4 < 0\\)), so it can't be factored into integer polynomials.\n\nHowever, we still have \\(x^4 + 4\\). Is this polynomial irreducible over the integers? Or can it be factored further? Hmm, that's a key point because if it can be factored, we'll have even more polynomials, and that might affect the sum.\n\nI recall that \\(x^4 + 4\\) is a special polynomial known as a biquadratic polynomial. It might be factorable using a method similar to sum of squares or using complex numbers, but since we need integer coefficients, we need a different approach.\n\nWait, there's a formula for factoring \\(x^4 + a^4\\). It can be factored as \\((x^2 + a x + a^2)(x^2 - a x + a^2)\\) for certain \\(a\\), but in this case, I have \\(x^4 + 4\\), which is \\(x^4 + 2^2\\). Hmm, but 2 is squared, but the formula I just thought of is for \\(x^4 + a^4\\). Wait, \\(4 = 2^2\\), not 2^4. So maybe that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, I think \\(x^4 + 4\\) is a case of \\(x^4 + 4y^4\\), which can be factored using the Sophie Germain identity: \\(x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2)\\). But in this problem, since it's \\(x^4 + 4\\), it's like setting \\(y = 1\\), so it would factor into \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\).\n\nLet me verify that:\n\nMultiply \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)("

So, that's correct.\n\nThen, \\(x^4 +4\\) factors into \\((x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)\\), which I verified by expansion.

But in this case, the factoring seems unique. Let me see, since the polynomial is degree 8 and we've broken it down into two quartics, each of which factors into two quadratics, and the quartic \\(x^4 -1\\) further factors into two linear terms. So, the factorization is unique as monic polynomials with integer coefficients, because each step is based on difference of squares and the Sophie Germain identity. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother check: The original polynomial evaluated at x=1 is \\(1 +3 -4=0\\). So, f(1)=0. Which makes sense because (x -1) is a factor, so one of the p_i(1) will be zero. But in our sum, we have more terms, but their sum is 10. So, that's okay"

But the sum is separate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute the sum without factoring? Let me think. The problem asks for the sum of p_i(1) where each p_i is an irreducible monic factor. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a theorem or formula that relates the sum of the evaluations of the factors at a point to the original polynomial? Hmm, not that I can recall. The product of the factors evaluated at 1 would be equal to the original polynomial evaluated at 1, but the sum isn't directly related. So, probably the way to go is indeed factoring and then adding up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we consider that when you factor a polynomial into irreducibles, the sum of their evaluations at a point can sometimes be related to coefficients, but I don't think so here. So, I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the factors again. Let me recompute each factor at x=1 again to be sure.\n\nFirst factor: \\(x^2 +2x +2\\) at 1: 1 +2 +2 =5.

Further factoring \\(x^2 - 1\\) gives \\((x + 1)(x - 1)\\). Thus, we have the factorization:\n\n\\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1).\\]\n\nWe recognize that \\(x^4 + 4\\) can be factored using the Sophie Germain identity, resulting in \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\).
