Denali is responsible for 16 dogs, and Nate is responsible for 12 dogs.\n\nUnder the new policy, Denali will walk \\(4x\\) more dogs, and Nate's number of dogs will remain at 12. This means Denali will now walk \\(16 + 4x\\) dogs.\n\nNext, if \\(x\\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, Denali's total will increase by \\(x\\), making it \\(16 + x\\) dogs, while Nate's total will decrease to \\(12 - x\\) dogs.\n\nWe know that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay must remain the same in both scenarios.

Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
