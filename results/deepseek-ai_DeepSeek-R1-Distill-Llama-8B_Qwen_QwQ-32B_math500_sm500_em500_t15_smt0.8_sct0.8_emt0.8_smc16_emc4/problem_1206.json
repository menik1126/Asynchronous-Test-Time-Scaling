The line is parameterized, so I think that means it's defined by some parameter \\( t \\), and the direction vector tells us how \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) change as \\( t \\) changes. The direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), so that means for every unit increase in \\( t \\), \\( x \\) decreases by 7 and \\( y \\) increases by \\( b \\).\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code provided, I can see it's drawing a line from point \\( A = (-5,4) \\) to point \\( B = (-1,3) \\). Then it's finding points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) which are the intersections of this line with the vertical lines \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\), respectively. The red line drawn is the parameterized line from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\).\n\nWait, no, actually, the Asymptote code is a bit more detailed. It's drawing a grid, the x-axis, and the y-axis. Then it defines points \\( A = (-5,4) \\) and \\( B = (-1,3) \\). It then finds points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) as the intersections of the line \\( AB \\) with the vertical lines \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\), respectively. So \\( L \\) is the point where \\( AB \\) meets \\( x = -8 \\), and \\( R \\) is where \\( AB \\) meets \\( x = 8 \\). The red line is then drawn from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\), which is the same as the original line \\( AB \\) but extended.\n\nBut how does this help me find \\( b \\)? Hmm. Maybe the direction vector comes from the slope of the line \\( AB \\) or something related.\n\nWait, the line is parameterized, so if it's parameterized from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\), the direction vector should be from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\).

Therefore, the direction vector of line \\( AB \\) should be a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nLet me confirm that. The direction vector of line \\( AB \\) can be found by subtracting coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Let's compute that first.\n\nPoint \\( A \\) is (-5,4), and point \\( B \\) is (-1,3). The direction vector from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is \\( B - A = (-1 - (-5), 3 - 4) = (4, -1) \\). So the direction vector of the line is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nBut the problem states that the direction vector is of the form \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Since direction vectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, these two vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. Therefore, there exists some scalar \\( k \\) such that:\n\n\\( 4 = k \\times (-7) \\)\n\n\\( -1 = k \\times b \\)\n\nSo from the first equation, \\( k = 4 / (-7) = -4/7 \\).

Alternatively, maybe the direction vector given in the problem is the direction of the line from L to R, which might be different? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), so the line's direction vector must be a scalar multiple of that.

So their direction vectors should be the same, just scaled.\n\nSo if direction vector AB is (4, -1), then direction vector LR is also (4, -1), but in the problem, it's given as (-7, b). Therefore, (4, -1) is a scalar multiple of (-7, b). So 4 = -7k and -1 = b k for some scalar k.\n\nSo from first equation: k = 4 / (-7) = -4/7\n\nThen substitute into second equation: -1 = b * (-4/7) \u2192 Multiply both sides by (-7/4): b = (-1)*(-7/4) = 7/4 = 1.75.\n\nTherefore, b = 7/4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the direction vector is from L to R, so maybe I should compute that direction vector.\n\nIn the Asymptote code, L is the extension of line AB with x = -8, and R is the extension with x=8. So I can compute the coordinates of L and R.\n\nFirst, let's find the parametric equations of line AB.

Wait, let me compute that again.\n\nWait, coordinates of R are (8, 3/4), coordinates of L are (-8, 19/4).\n\nSo the difference is:\n\nx-component: 8 - (-8) = 16\n\ny-component: 3/4 - 19/4 = (3 -19)/4 = (-16)/4 = -4\n\nTherefore, direction vector from L to R is (16, -4).
