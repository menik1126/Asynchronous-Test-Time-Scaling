            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number satisfying \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\). Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the equation \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\) has three solutions, which are the cube roots of unity. These are \\(1\\), \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive root, meaning it's not equal to 1. So, in this problem, \\(\\omega\\) could be any of these three roots, right?\n\nWait, actually, the question says \"all possible values\" of the expression. That makes me think that depending on whether \\(\\omega\\) is 1 or a primitive root, the expression might give different results. But hold on, if \\(\\omega = 1\\), then the denominators become \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so each term would be \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and their sum would be 1. But if \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive root, then the expression might be different. So, that suggests that the expression could have two possible values: one when \\(\\omega = 1\\), and another when \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive cube root of unity.\n\nBut the problem says \"all possible values,\" so maybe we need to consider all cases. Let me verify this.\n\nSo, the cube roots of unity are indeed \\(1\\), \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\) satisfy \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) and \\(\\omega^2 \\neq 1\\). They are complex numbers, and importantly, they satisfy the equation \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\). I remember that from my algebra classes. So, that's a useful identity here.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can express the given expression in terms of \\(1 + \\omega\\) and \\(1 + \\omega^2\\). Let me write down the expression again: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2"

To do that, I can find a common denominator, which would be \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\). So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, let me compute the numerator when combining the two fractions:\n\n\\(1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega^2) + 1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega)\\)  \n= \\(1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega\\)  \n= \\(2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\)\n\nSo, the combined fraction becomes:\n\n\\(\\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\\)\n\nNow, I remember that \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), so \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\). Therefore, substituting this into the numerator:\n\n\\(2 + (-1) = 1\\)\n\nOkay, so the numerator simplifies to 1. That's helpful.\n\nNow, let's compute the denominator: \\((1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\\). Let's expand that.\n\nMultiply \\(1 + \\omega\\) and \\(1 + \\omega^2\\):\n\n\\(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot \\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot 1 + \\omega \\cdot \\omega^2\\)  \n= \\(1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + \\omega^3\\)\n\nBut since \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), as given in the problem, \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\). So:\n\n= \\(1 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1\\)  \n= \\(2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\)\n\nAgain, using \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), we can substitute \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\):\n\n= \\(2 + (-1)\\)  \n= \\(1\\)\n\nWow, so the denominator also simplifies to 1. Therefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1}\\)  \n= \\(1\\)\n\nWait, that's interesting. It seems that regardless of whether \\(\\omega = 1\\) or \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive cube root of unity, the expression always evaluates"

So, that suggests that there's only one possible value for the given expression, which is 1.\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Combined the two fractions: Got \\(2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\) in the numerator.\n2. Used the identity \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\) to substitute \\( \\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\), so numerator becomes 1.\n3. Expanded the denominator: Got \\(2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\), same substitution gives denominator as 1.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the expression is always equal to 1, no matter if \\(\\omega\\) is 1 or a primitive cube root of unity.\n\nBut wait, hold on. When \\(\\omega = 1\\), let's compute the expression directly to see if it gives 1.\n\nCompute \\(\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1}\\)  \n= \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\)  \n= 1\n\nOkay, that matches. Now, let me test with a primitive root, say \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3}\\), which is \\(-\\frac{1}{2} + i \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\nCompute \\(1 + \\omega = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + i \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} + i \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\nCompute the reciprocal: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\). Let me compute the modulus squared of \\(1 + \\omega\\):\n\n\\(|1 + \\omega|^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = 1\\), so \\(|1 + \\omega| = 1\\), hence \\(1/(1 + \\omega)\\) is equal to the complex conjugate of \\(1 + \\omega\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{2} - i \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\(1 + \\omega^2"
