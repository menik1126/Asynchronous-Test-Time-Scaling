            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\) given three equations involving \\( x, y, \\) and \\( z \\). Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\). I remember that in algebra, sometimes you can relate these kinds of expressions using symmetric sums or some identities. Let me think about the relationships between these equations.\n\nI know that in symmetric equations, the elementary symmetric sums are \\( S_1 = x + y + z \\), \\( S_2 = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( S_3 = xyz \\). These often come up in problems involving cubic equations, where the roots are \\( x, y, z \\).\n\nGiven that \\( S_3 = xyz = 4 \\), that's our first value. Now, I wonder if I can find \\( S_1 \\) or \\( S_2 \\) using the other equations.\n\nLooking at the second equation: \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). I recall that the sum of cubes can be expressed in terms of \\( S_1 \\), \\( S_2 \\), and \\( S_3 \\). The formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\).\n\nSo substituting the known values, we have:\n\n\\( 4 = S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 + 3 \\times 4 \\).\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( 4 = S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 + 12 \\).\n\nMoving the 12 to the left side:\n\n\\( 4 - 12 = S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 \\)\n\n\\( -8 = S_"

Let me see what information I can get from the third equation.\n\nThe third equation is: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\).\n\nLooking at this, I notice that each term is of the form \\( x y^2 \\), \\( x^2 y \\), etc., which are similar to the terms in expanding \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) \\).\n\nWait, let me check: \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) \\) would expand to:\n\n\\( x \\cdot xy + x \\cdot yz + x \\cdot zx + y \\cdot xy + y \\cdot yz + y \\cdot zx + z \\cdot xy + z \\cdot yz + z \\cdot zx \\).\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n\\( x^2 y + x y z + x^2 z + x y^2 + y^2 z + y x z + x y z + y z^2 + z^2 x \\).\n\nWait, that's a lot. Let me collect like terms:\n\n- \\( x^2 y \\)\n- \\( x^2 z \\)\n- \\( y^2 x \\) (same as \\( x y^2 \\))\n- \\( y^2 z \\)\n- \\( z^2 x \\)\n- \\( z^2 y \\) (same as \\( y z^2 \\))\n- And three terms of \\( x y z \\), so \\( 3 x y z \\).\n\nSo altogether, \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 y + x^2 z + x y^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 + z^2 x + 3 xyz \\).\n\nBut looking back at the third equation given: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\).\n\nWait, that's almost the same as the expansion above, except the expansion has an extra \\( 3 xyz \\)."
