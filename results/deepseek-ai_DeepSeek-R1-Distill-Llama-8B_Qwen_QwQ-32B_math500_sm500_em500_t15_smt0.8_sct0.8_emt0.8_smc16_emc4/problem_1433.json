Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power means that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\). So, I need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) is equal to some integer raised to the \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n\nLet me think about prime factorization here. Since \\( 2^{24} \\) is already a power of a prime number (2), any representation of it as a perfect power must have exponents that are multiples of \\( n \\). So, \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\) because the exponent in \\( k^n \\) would have to be a multiple of \\( n \\).\n\nWait, let me clarify that. If \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\), then \\( k \\) must be a power of 2 as well. Let's say \\( k = 2^m \\). Then, \\( k^n = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn} \\). Setting this equal to \\( 2^{24} \\), we get \\( mn = 24 \\). So, \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers satisfying \\( mn = 24 \\), and \\( n > 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of positive integer divisors \\( n \\) of \\( 24 \\) such that \\( n > 1 \\). Each divisor \\( n \\) will correspond to \\( m = 24/n \\), ensuring that \\( 2^{24} = (2^{m})^n \\).\n\nSo, I need to list all the divisors of 24 and then count those that are greater than 1.\n\nLet me find the divisors of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\). The number of divisors is calculated by adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factors and then multiplying them. So, \\( (3"

So, the possible values of \\( n \\) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. That's 7 numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to ensure that each \\( n \\) in this list indeed satisfies the condition. For each \\( n \\), \\( m = 24/n \\) must be an integer.\n\n- \\( n=2 \\): \\( m=24/2=12 \\), so \\( 2^{12} \\) is indeed a square root of \\( 2^{24} \\).\n- \\( n=3 \\): \\( m=24/3=8 \\), so \\( 2^8 \\) is a cube root of \\( 2^{24} \\).\n- \\( n=4 \\): \\( m=24/4=6 \\), so \\( 2^6 \\) is a fourth root.\n- \\( n=6 \\): \\( m=24/6=4 \\), so \\( 2^4 \\) is a sixth root.\n- \\( n=8 \\): \\( m=24/8=3 \\), so \\( 2^3 \\) is an eighth root.\n- \\( n=12 \\): \\( m=24/12=2 \\), so \\( 2^2 \\) is a twelfth root.\n- \\( n=24 \\): \\( m=24/24=1 \\), so \\( 2^1 \\) is a twenty-fourth root.\n\nAll these check out. Each \\( n > 1 \\) divides 24, so there are 7 such integers. Therefore, the number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) is 7.\n\nI don't think I've missed any. Since 24 has 8 divisors and we exclude 1, it's 7. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we analyze the prime factorization"
