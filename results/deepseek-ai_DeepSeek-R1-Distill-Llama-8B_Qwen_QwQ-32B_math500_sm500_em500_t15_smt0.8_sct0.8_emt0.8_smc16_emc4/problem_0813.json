The leading coefficient a_n is 2, and the constant term a_0 is 66. The roots of this polynomial are distinct integers. We need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for a polynomial with integer coefficients, if it has integer roots, then those roots must divide the constant term. This is because of the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any possible rational root p/q, where p and q are coprime integers, must satisfy that p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient.\n\nIn our case, the leading coefficient is 2, so the possible denominators q for rational roots are 1 or 2. However, since all the roots are integers, q must be 1. Therefore, all possible roots must be integers that divide 66.\n\nLet me list the integer divisors of 66. The divisors of 66 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16, \u00b111, \u00b122, \u00b133, and \u00b166. These are all the possible integer roots.\n\nSince the polynomial has distinct integer roots, we need to choose a set of these divisors such that their product divided by 2 (because the leading coefficient is 2) gives us the constant term 66. Wait, actually, let me correct myself: the product of the roots times a_n (which is 2) should equal a_0, which is 66.\n\nHold on, actually, for a monic polynomial, the constant term is the product of the roots times (-1)^n. But since we have a leading coefficient of 2, the polynomial is not monic. So, we need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me write the polynomial in its factored form. If the roots are r1, r2, ..., rk, then the polynomial can be written as 2*(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rk). When we expand this, the constant term is 2*(-1)^k*(r1*r2*...*rk). Since the constant term is given as 66, we have:\n\n2*(-1)^k*(r1*r2*...*rk) = 66.\n\nSo, (-1)^k*(r1*r2*"

            "output": "...*rk) = 33.\n\nThat means the product of the roots times (-1)^k is 33. Since 33 is positive, (-1)^k must be positive as well, so k must be even because (-1)^k is 1 when k is even and -1 when k is odd. Therefore, the number of roots k is even, and their product is 33.\n\nWait, 33 is equal to 3*11. So, 33 can be factored into integer roots as 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11. Since the roots are distinct, we need to choose an even number of these such that their product is 33.\n\nBut 33 is positive, so the number of negative roots must be even, or all roots positive.\n\nBut wait, 33 is positive, so when we take the product of the roots, it's positive. So, either all the roots are positive or an even number of them are negative.\n\nBut since we want the minimal |a_{n-1}|, which relates to the symmetric sums of the roots, perhaps we should aim for the roots as close to each other as possible? Or maybe the smallest possible in magnitude.\n\nBut let's think in terms of Vieta's formula.\n\nGiven the polynomial is 2*(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rk), then:\n\na_{n-1} is equal to -2*(r1 + r2 + ... + rk).\n\nSo, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|.\n\nHence, we need to minimize 2*|sum of roots|.\n\nSo, our goal is to find a set of distinct integer roots, all dividing 66, such that the product of roots times (-1)^k is 33, and the sum of the roots is as close to zero as possible in absolute value.\n\nBecause if the sum is small, then 2*|sum| will also be small.\n\nSo, first, let's find all possible sets of roots. Since each root is an integer divisor of 66, and the product of the roots is 33 when multiplied by (-1)^k.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that 2*(product of roots)*(-1)^k = 66, so product of roots is 33. Hmm, correct.\n\nSo, the product of the roots is "
