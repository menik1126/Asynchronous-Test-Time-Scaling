For each grade, I'll find how many percentage points separate the male and female percentages.\n\nFor the 9th grade:\nMale percentage = 41.1%\nFemale percentage = 39.4%\nPercentage difference = 41.1 - 39.4 = 1.7%\n\nFor the 10th grade:\nMale percentage = 34.4%\nFemale percentage = 33.1%\nPercentage difference = 34.4 - 33.1 = 1.3%\n\nFor the 11th grade:\nMale percentage = 20.6%\nFemale percentage = 13.8%\nPercentage difference = 20.6 - 13.8 = 6.8%\n\nFor the 12th grade:\nMale percentage = 11.6%\nFemale percentage = 8.6%\nPercentage difference = 11.6 - 8.6 = 3.0%\n\nNext, I'll determine how far each grade's percentage difference is from the 135% target.\n\nFor 9th grade: 1.7 is significantly less than 135.\nFor 10th grade: 1.3 is also much less than 135.\nFor 11th grade: 6.8 is much less than 135.\nFor 12th grade: 3.0 is still less than 135.\n\nSince all grades have percentage differences much lower than 135%, none of them are close to 135%. Therefore, there's no grade where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** The data in the table below shows the percent of bus riders in a survey of Central H.S. students; 300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed.
