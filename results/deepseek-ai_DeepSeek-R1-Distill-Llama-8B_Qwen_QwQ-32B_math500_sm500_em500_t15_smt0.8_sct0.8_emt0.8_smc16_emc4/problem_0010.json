            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find P(5) given some conditions about a cubic polynomial P(x). Let me try to unpack what's given and figure out how to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so P(x) should look something like x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nNext, it mentions that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Hmm, okay, so R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by those quadratics, which means R(x) has a lower degree than 2, so it's a linear polynomial. Let me write that as R(x) = dx + e, where d and e are constants.\n\nAlso, I know that P(0) = 5. Since P(x) is a cubic, plugging in x=0 will give me P(0) = c = 5. So now I know c is 5, so P(x) is x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + 5.\n\nAlright, now I need to use the information about the remainders. When dividing a polynomial by a quadratic, the remainder is of lower degree, so in this case, R(x) is linear. There's a theorem called the Polynomial Remainder Theorem which says that the remainder of dividing P(x) by (x - k) is P(k). But here, we're dividing by a product of two linear factors, so the remainder R(x) can be found by expressing P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x),\n\nwhere Q1(x) is the quotient polynomial when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4). Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so:\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x).\n\nSince R(x) is linear, I"

So, if I plug in x=1 and x=4 into P(x), I get:\n\nP(1) = R(1)\nP(4) = R(4)\n\nSimilarly, when I plug in x=2 and x=3 into P(x), I should get:\n\nP(2) = 2R(2)\nP(3) = 2R(3)\n\nBecause when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so P(2) would be 2R(2), and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should write this down more clearly.\n\nSo, let's write equations for P(1), P(4), P(2), and P(3).\n\nGiven P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x),\nP(1) = R(1)\nSimilarly, P(4) = R(4)\n\nSimilarly,\nP(2) = 2R(2)\nP(3) = 2R(3)\n\nSo, that gives us four equations:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n3. P(2) = 2R(2)\n4. P(3) = 2R(3)\n\nBut R(x) is a linear polynomial, so R(1) = d*1 + e = d + e\nSimilarly,\nR(4) = 4d + e\nR(2) = 2d + e\nR(3) = 3d + e\n\nSo, substituting these into the equations:\n\n1.

P(3) = 2(3d + e) = 6d + 2e\n\nSince P(x) is a cubic polynomial, I can write P(x) as x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + 5 because P(0) = c = 5.\n\n"
