Let me see how I can approach this. The equation involves complex solutions, so I know I can't restrict my attention solely to real numbers. \n\nFirst, looking at the left side, I notice that each term has the form \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\), where \\(n\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. That pattern is interesting. Maybe there's a way to manipulate this equation to make it more manageable.\n\nI remember that sometimes when dealing with equations involving multiple fractions, it's helpful to combine them or find a common denominator. However, in this case, the denominators are all different, which could make combining them messy. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe substitution can simplify things. If I let \\(y = x^2\\), then each denominator becomes \\(y - n\\). So, the left side can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\]\n\nThat might make it easier to handle, but I'm not sure yet. Let me see what the equation looks like in terms of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but \\(y = x^2\\), so \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{y}\\). This might complicate things because of the square root, but perhaps I can find a relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) that can help.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe consider the entire left side as a function of \\(y\\). Let me denote:\n\n\\[\nf(y) = \\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - "

Maybe I can substitute this into the equation:\n\nBut wait, let's think differently. Maybe instead of substitution, consider the left side as a sum of partial fractions or something similar.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's consider that the left-hand side (LHS) is a sum of terms each of which is \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\), which can be expressed as \\(\\frac{n}{(x - \\sqrt{n})(x + \\sqrt{n})}\\). \n\nBut I'm not sure how helpful that is for solving the equation. It might complicate the expression further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let\u2019s look for a clever substitution or manipulation that can relate both sides. The right-hand side (RHS) is linear in \\(x\\), while the LHS is a sum of four rational functions each involving \\(x^2\\). \n\nI wonder if cross-multiplying could work here, but with four terms, that might lead to a very high degree equation. Let me explore this possibility.\n\nSo, starting with the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nLet me denote the common denominator as \\(D\\), which would be the product of all four denominators: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). However, this is going to result in a very lengthy computation. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps consider that the equation is equal to a linear term in \\(x\\), so maybe if I consider that the LHS is some function that equals a linear function,"

Wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, the first four terms when multiplied by D/D would each have denominators canceled, so each term would be of degree 6 (since D is degree 8, divided by a quadratic term gives degree 6). Then, the last term is (2010x -4)*D, which is a degree 9 polynomial. Therefore, the entire equation would be a degree 9 polynomial. \n\nHmm, solving a degree 9 polynomial is going to be really complicated. Maybe there's a trick"

Let me consider that the LHS can be written as a rational function, and the RHS is a linear function. So, the equation is \\(f(x) = g(x)\\), where \\(f(x)\\) is a rational function of degree 6 (since each term is degree -2, multiplied by constants, so when combined, the numerator would be a polynomial of degree 6 over degree 8).

Therefore, Vieta's formula gives sum of roots = - (14)/(-2010) = 14/2010 = 7/1005.\n\nHmm, but the problem says \"the sum of all complex solutions\". So, unless there are some extraneous roots introduced during the process, but since we multiplied both sides by D(x^2), which is (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4), we have to exclude the roots where D(x^2)=0, i.e., x^2 =1,2,3,4. So, x=\u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12. These are excluded from the solutions because they make the original denominators zero. Therefore, the equation we formed includes these roots as potential solutions, but they are actually not solutions to the original equation. Therefore, the polynomial equation has degree 9, but the original equation excludes 8 roots (the ones making denominators zero). Therefore, the actual solutions are the roots of the polynomial equation excluding those 8 roots. Therefore, the sum of the solutions of the original equation would be the sum of all roots of the polynomial minus the sum of the excluded roots.\n\nWait, this is a crucial point! I almost forgot about the excluded roots. So, when we multiplied both sides by D(x^2), we might have introduced extraneous roots at the points where D(x^2)=0, which are x=\u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12. These are 8 roots. Therefore, the polynomial equation of degree 9 includes these 8 roots plus one more root (since 9 total). Therefore, the original equation's solutions are the roots of the polynomial equation except those 8 roots. Therefore, the sum of the original equation's solutions is equal to the sum of all roots of the polynomial minus the sum of the excluded roots.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute:\n\nSum_original = Sum_polynomial - Sum_excluded_roots\n\nFirst, compute Sum_polynomial = 7"
