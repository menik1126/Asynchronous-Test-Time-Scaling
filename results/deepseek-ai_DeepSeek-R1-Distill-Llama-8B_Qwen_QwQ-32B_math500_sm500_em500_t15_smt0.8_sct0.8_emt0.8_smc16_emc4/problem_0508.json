            "output": "Alright, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out how many students take physics at my school. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm going to write down all the information given and then see how I can use it to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the total number of students in the school is 360. Out of these, 15 take calculus, physics, and chemistry, and another 15 don't take any of those three subjects. So, right off the bat, I can subtract those 15 from the total to find out how many take at least one of calculus, physics, or chemistry.\n\n360 total students minus 15 who don't take any of the subjects equals 345 students who take at least one of calculus, physics, or chemistry. That makes sense so far.\n\nNext, it says 180 students take calculus. Hmm, so out of the 345 students taking at least one subject, 180 are taking calculus. That means the remaining students must be taking either physics or chemistry, but I need to figure out how.\n\nIt also mentions that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics. Let me denote the number of students who take physics as P. Then, the number of students taking chemistry would be 2P because it's twice as many. So, P for physics and 2P for chemistry.\n\nNow, moving on. It says 75 students take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry. Wait, so 75 students are taking both calculus and chemistry, and another 75 are taking both physics and chemistry. That seems like a lot, so I need to be careful here.\n\nAlso, only 30 students take both physics and calculus. So, the overlap between physics and calculus is 30, whereas the overlap between physics and chemistry is 75, and between calculus and chemistry is 75.\n\nI think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here to find the total number of students taking at least one subject. The formula for three sets is:\n\nTotal = C + P + Ch - (C\u2229P) - (C\u2229Ch) - (P\u2229Ch) + (C\u2229P\u2229Ch)\n\nWhere C is calculus, P is physics, Ch is chemistry, and the intersections are the overlaps.\n\nBut wait, I don't know how many students are taking all three subjects, calculus, physics,"

            "output": " and chemistry. Wait, actually, the problem says 15 students take all three. So, C\u2229P\u2229Ch = 15. That's given.\n\nSo plugging in the known values:\n\nTotal taking at least one subject = C + P + Ch - (C\u2229P) - (C\u2229Ch) - (P\u2229Ch) + (C\u2229P\u2229Ch)\n\nWe know that the total taking at least one subject is 345 (since 360 -15=345). Let me write down all the known values:\n\nC = 180 (calculus)\nC\u2229P\u2229Ch = 15 (all three)\nC\u2229P = 30 (physics and calculus)\nC\u2229Ch = 75 (calculus and chemistry)\nP\u2229Ch = 75 (physics and chemistry)\nCh = 2P (chemistry is twice physics)\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's combine the terms:\n\n180 (C) + P + 2P (P and Ch) = 180 + 3P\n\nThen subtract the pairwise overlaps:\n\n-30 (C\u2229P) -75 (C\u2229Ch) -75 (P\u2229Ch) = -30 -75 -75 = -180\n\nThen add back the triple overlap:\n\n+15 (C\u2229P\u2229Ch)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n345 = (180 + 3P) - 180 + 15\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, the equation is:\n\n345 = [180 + P + 2P] - [30 + 75 + 75] + 15\n\nWait, actually, the formula is:\n\nTotal = C + P + Ch - (C\u2229P) - (C\u2229Ch) - (P\u2229Ch) + (C\u2229P\u2229Ch)\n\nSo substituting:\n\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 -75 -75 +15\n\nYes, that's correct. Let me compute the numbers step by step.\n\nFirst,"

Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nSo, if P = 110, then chemistry is 2*110=220.\n\nNow, let's plug back into the inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\nC =180, P=110, Ch=220\n\nC\u2229P=30, C\u2229Ch=75, P\u2229Ch=75, C\u2229P\u2229Ch=15\n\nSo total = 180 + 110 + 220 -30 -75 -75 +15\n\nLet's compute:\n\n180 + 110 = 290; 290 +220=510\n\nThen subtract: 30+75=105; 105+75=180; 510 -180=330\n\nAdding back 15: 330 +15=345, which matches the total number of students taking at least one subject.
