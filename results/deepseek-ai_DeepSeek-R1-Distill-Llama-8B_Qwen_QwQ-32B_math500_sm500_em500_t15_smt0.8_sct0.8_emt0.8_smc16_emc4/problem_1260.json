            "output": "First, I need to determine the base six equivalent of the number 999 in base 10. To do this, I'll convert the decimal number to base six by repeatedly dividing the number by 6 and recording the remainders.\n\nI start by dividing 999 by 6. The quotient is 166 and the remainder is 3. This means that 999 in base 10 is equal to 3 in base six.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6 again. This gives a quotient of 27 and a remainder of 4. So, 166 in base 10 is represented as 4 in base six.\n\nContinuing the process, I divide the new quotient 27 by 6. The division yields a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3. This means that 27 in base 10 is equal to 43 in base six.\n\nFinally, I take the quotient 4 and divide it by 6. The division results in a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4. Therefore, 4 in base 10 is represented as 4 in base six.\n\nCombining all the remainders from each division step in reverse order, the base six equivalent of 999 in base 10 is 3444.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of \\(999_{10}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide the number by 6 and record the remainder.**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - The least significant digit (rightmost digit) is **3**.\n\n2. **Take the quotient from the first division and divide by 6.**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - The next digit is **4**.\n\n3. **Take the new quotient and divide by 6 again.**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - The next digit is **3**.\n\n4. **Take the new quotient and divide by 6 one last time.**\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - The most significant digit (leftmost digit"
