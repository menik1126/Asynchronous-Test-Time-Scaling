            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you divide one polynomial by another, you can use polynomial long division or synthetic division. Since the divisor here is a linear term, \\( x + 1 \\), maybe synthetic division would be faster. \n\nFirst, I should set up the synthetic division. The divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), so the root we use is \\( -1 \\) because we're looking for \\( x = -1 \\). I'll write down the coefficients of the dividend \\( x^6 - 3 \\). But wait, the dividend is \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\). So, all coefficients from \\( x^6 \\) down to the constant term. That means I have to include six terms before the constant, all zeros except the last term is -3.\n\nLet me write that out. The coefficients are 1 (for \\( x^6 \\)), then zeros for \\( x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2, x \\), and then -3. So the coefficients are: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nI also need to bring down the coefficients in the order of descending powers. So, let's write the setup:\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n    |      -1   1   -1   1   -1   1\n    -------------------------------\n      1  -1   1   -1   1   -1   2\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I did that right. When I set up synthetic division, I bring down the first coefficient, multiply it by the root (-1), add it to the next coefficient, and so on. Let me step through it:\n\n1. Start with the first coefficient, 1.\n2. Multiply 1 by -1 to get -1. Add this to the next coefficient, which is 0. 0 + (-1) = -1"

Multiply -1 by -1 to get 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 0 + 1 = 1.\n6. Multiply 1 by -1 to get -1. Add to next coefficient (0): 0 + (-1) = -1.\n7. Multiply -1 by -1 to get 1. Add to the last coefficient (-3): -3 + 1 = -2.\n\nWait, so the last term should be -2, not 2. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let me check again step by step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nSet up the coefficients: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1. Add to next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1: 1. Add to next 0: 0 +1 =1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1. Add to next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1: 1. Add to next 0: 0 +1 =1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1. Add to next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1: 1. Add to -3: -3 +1 = -2.\n\nSo the last term is -2, which is the remainder. Therefore, the coefficients of the quotient are 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, and the remainder is -2. Wait, but the quotient's degree should be one less than the dividend. Since the dividend is degree 6, the quotient is degree 5. So the coefficients correspond to x^5 down to x^0. So the quotient polynomial is:\n\n\\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\), and the remainder is -2. \n\nTherefore, the question asks for"

            "output": " the quotient, which is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\) with a remainder of -2. So the final answer is that quotient, but I should express it properly.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is just asking for the quotient, not the remainder, maybe I can write it as that polynomial. Wait, but when you perform the division, it's quotient plus remainder over divisor. So, the division is:\n\n\\( \\frac{x^6 - 3}{x + 1} = x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 - \\frac{2}{x + 1} \\).\n\nBut since they asked for the quotient, which is the polynomial part, that's \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\). But maybe I should write it as \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\), correct.\n\nLet me just double-check the synthetic division steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother way is to use polynomial division.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the Remainder Theorem to check the remainder. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder is f(-1). Let's compute f(-1):\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^6 -3 = 1 -3 = -2. So yes, the remainder is -2, which matches what I got with synthetic division. Therefore, the quotient is correct.\n\nSo, just to recap, the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\), we can use synthetic division.\n\n1. **Set up synthetic division** with the root \\( -1 \\) and the coefficients of the dividend \\( x^6 - 3 \\) (which are 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3).\n\n2. **Perform synthetic division**:\n   - Bring down the 1.\n   - Multiply 1 by -1 to get -1, add to the next 0 to get -1.\n   - Multiply -1 by -1 to get 1, add to the next 0"
