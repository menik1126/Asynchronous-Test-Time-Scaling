I remember from algebra that for polynomials, the sum of the roots can be found using Vieta's formulas, which relates the coefficients of the polynomial to the sum and product of its roots. But this equation isn't a polynomial; it's a rational equation. So I need to manipulate it into a polynomial form to apply Vieta's.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nI notice each term on the left has the form \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\), where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe I can combine these fractions. To do that, I'll need a common denominator. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). So the common denominator would be the product of all four denominators: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\).\n\nBut that seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator to eliminate the fractions. Let me try that.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\):\n\nLeft side becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2"

The left side is a degree 8 polynomial (each term is a product of three quadratics, so 3*4=12? Wait, no, wait: each term is a product of three quadratics, but the denominators are quadratics. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nEach term on the left is of the form \\(k \\times \\) [three quadratics]. Wait, when I multiply each term, I'm multiplying three quadratic denominators, but each term only has three denominators, because the original equation's denominators are four, but each term on the left only has one denominator. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Each term on the left has one denominator, and when I multiply by the common denominator, each term becomes \\(k\\) times the product of the other three denominators. So each term on the left is a cubic in terms of the product? Wait, each denominator is quadratic, so each term is \\(k\\) times a product of three quadratics, which would be a degree 6 polynomial. So the left side is a degree 6 polynomial multiplied by 1,2,3,4, but actually, each of the four terms is a degree 6 polynomial, so the left side is the sum of four degree 6 polynomials. So overall, the left side is a degree 6 polynomial.\n\nThe right side is (2010x -4) times the product of four quadratics, which is a degree 4 polynomial, so the product is degree 8, multiplied by 2010x, so degree 9, and then subtract 4 times that, so also degree 9. So the equation is:\n\nLeft side (degree 6) = Right side (degree 9).\n\nTo bring everything to one side, I subtract the right side:\n\nLeft side - Right side = "

The sum of all complex solutions would be the negative coefficient of x^8 divided by the coefficient of x^9, according to Vieta's formula.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in the polynomial, I can compute the sum.\n\nBut this seems really tedious. Maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's symmetry or substitution that can simplify the equation.\n\nLet me consider substituting y = x^2. Then the denominators become y - 1, y - 2, y - 3, y - 4. The left side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}\n\\]\n\nBut the right side is 2010x -4, which still has an x term. Since y = x^2, this substitution might not help directly because the right side is linear in x, not in y. Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying and rearranging terms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the left side is a function of x^2, so maybe the equation is even in some way? But the right side is 2010x -4, which is not even. So that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving all terms to one side and considering the equation as f(x) = 0, then the sum of roots is the coefficient of x^8 over the coefficient of x^9 with a negative sign. Since the equation is of degree 9, the sum of roots is - (coefficient of x^8)/(coefficient of x^9).\n\nTherefore, maybe I can compute the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 without expanding everything?\n\nLet me see. Let me denote the left side as L(x) and the right side as R(x). Then the equation is L(x) - R(x) = 0. Let me compute the leading terms of L(x) and R(x).\n\nFirst, L(x) is the sum of four terms:\n\nTerm1: 1/(x² -1) multiplied by the common denominator (product of the other three"

So the left side, L(x), is the sum of four 6th-degree polynomials. So the leading term of each term is x^6, so L(x) has leading term 1*x^6 + 2*x^6 + 3*x^6 +4*x^6 = (1+2+3+4)x^6 = 10x^6.\n\nBut the right side R(x) is (2010x -4)*(x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4). Let me compute the leading term of R(x).\n\nFirst, compute the leading term of (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4). Each term is x², so multiplying four x² terms gives x^8. Therefore, the leading term is x^8. Multiplying by 2010x gives 2010x * x^8 = 2010x^9. The next term is 2010x multiplied by the next highest term, which is - (1 + 2 +3 +4)x^6, but I think we need more precise calculation.\n\nWait, actually, (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4) is equal to x^8 - (1+2+3+4)x^6 + ... So in general, when expanding, the expansion would be x^8 - (1+2+3+4)x^6 + ... lower degree terms.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply by (2010x -4), the leading terms would be 2010x * x^8 = 2010x^9 and the next term would be 2010"

To find the sum of all complex roots, we can use Vieta's formula: the sum is equal to - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9).\n\nLooking at the polynomial:\n\nCoefficient of x^9 is -1005.\n\nCoefficient of x^8 is +2.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all roots is - (2)/(-1005) = 2/1005.\n\nSimplify 2/1005: divide numerator and denominator by 1, it's already in lowest terms.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\nWait, is this correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

So the sum is 2/1005. To make sure, 2 and 1005 are coprime? 1005 is 5*201=5*3*67. 2 is a prime, doesn't divide 1005, so 2/1005 is reduced.\n\nSo the sum is 2/1005.

The coefficient of x^8 is +4, so after factoring out 2, it's +2. So yes, the ratio is 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005, which can be simplified as 2/(5×201) = 2/(5×3×67). Since 2 and 1005 share no common factors, so the fraction is reduced.\n\nWait, but let me check again the Vieta's formula. Vieta's formula states that for a polynomial equation of the form a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 =0, the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n.\n\nIn our case, the polynomial is:\n\n-1005x^9 +2x^8 + ... + ... =0.\n\nSo here, a_9 = -1005, a_8 = +2. Therefore, the sum is - (a_8)/a_9 = - (2)/(-1005) = 2/1005. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005. But let me check if there are any restrictions or extraneous roots.\n\nWait, when we multiplied both sides by the common denominator, we might have introduced extraneous roots where the denominator is zero. The denominators are x^2 -1, x^2 -2, x^2 -3, x^2 -4. So x cannot be ±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2. So any roots of the polynomial that are among these values must be excluded. However, the problem says \"sum of all complex solutions\", so we need to exclude those roots which are in the excluded values. But since the problem says \"complex solutions\", perhaps the equation might not have any of those roots as solutions, but we need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the polynomial equation includes those roots as solutions, but they are actually not solutions of the original equation because they make denominators zero. Therefore, when we compute the sum via Vi"

So if the polynomial has roots at x=1, x=-1, x=√2, x=-√2, etc., they are roots of the polynomial but not of the original equation. Therefore, in the original problem, the equation has the polynomial's roots except x=±1, ±√2, etc., as long as they are roots.\n\nBut in the original equation, x must not be any of the roots of the denominators, but when we multiplied both sides, we could have introduced these roots as roots of the new equation, but they are actually not solutions to the original equation.\n\nTherefore, computing the sum via Vieta would include these extraneous roots as well, which are not actually solutions to the original equation. Therefore, perhaps I need to adjust the sum by subtracting these extraneous roots.\n\nBut this complicates things, and I don't have a clear way to compute this.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The equation after cross-multiplying leads to a polynomial equation which has all roots of the original equation, plus the roots where the denominator is zero (since when we multiply both sides, we get that for those x, the left side is undefined, but right side could be anything, so the equation becomes undefined on those points, so those x cannot satisfy the original equation).\n\nSo, to get the roots of the original equation, we need to take the roots of the polynomial equation, excluding x=±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2.\n\nTherefore, the sum is the sum of all roots of the polynomial, minus the sum of the roots that are excluded. So, if the polynomial has roots at x=1, x=-1, x=√2, x=-√2, x=√3, x=-√3, x=2, x=-2, then the sum would be 2/1005 minus the sum of these roots.\n\nBut how do we know if the polynomial has these roots? Let me check:\n\nIf x=1 is a root, plugging x=1 into the polynomial:\n\nL(1) - R(1) should be 0. But let's compute:\n\nL(1) = 10*1^6 -70*1^4 +150*1^2 -96 =10 -70"
