To find the speed in meters per minute, I'll convert the time from hours to minutes and the distance from kilometers to meters.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the speed by dividing the distance by the time. This will give me the robot's speed in meters per minute.\n\nNow, using the calculated speed, I can find out how long it takes the robot to travel the length of the hallway in seconds. Once I have the time taken for the hallway length, I'll divide the hallway length by this time to determine its length in meters.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Robot's Speed**\n\nThe robot travels 1 kilometer (1000 meters) in 2.5 hours.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}} = 400 \\text{ meters per hour}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert the Robot's Speed to Meters per Minute**\n\nSince 1 hour = 60 minutes,\n\n\\[\n400 \\text{ meters per hour} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = 24,000 \\text{ meters per minute}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Time to Travel the Hallway in Minutes**\n\nThe robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway length.\n\n\\[\n90 \\text{ seconds} = \\frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Hallway Length**\n\nUsing the speed and time,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 24,000 \\text{ meters per minute} \\times 1.5 \\text{ minutes} = 36,000 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36,000 \\text{ meters}}\n\\]"

The correct calculation should be:\n\n\\[\n400 \\text{ meters per hour} \\div 60 \\text{ minutes per hour} = \\frac{400}{60} \\approx 6.6667 \\text{ meters per minute}\n\\]\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the initial speed calculation was in meters per hour. To convert to meters per minute, divide by 60:\n\n\\[\n400 \\text{ meters/hour} = \\frac{400}{60} \\approx 6.6667 \\text{ meters per minute}\n\\]\n\n**Revised Step 4: Recalculate the Hallway Length**\n\nUsing the correct speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = 6.6667 \\text{ meters/minute} \\times 1.5 \\text{ minutes} = 10 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right either. Let me start over.\n\n**Correct Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Speed Calculation:**\n   - 1 km = 1000 meters.\n   - 2.5 hours = 2.5 × 60 = 150 minutes.\n   - Speed = 1000 meters / 150 minutes ≈ 6.6667 meters per minute.\n\n2. **Time for Hallway:**\n   - 90 seconds = 90/60 = 1.5 minutes.\n\n3. **Hallway Length:**\n   - Length = Speed × Time = 6.6667 × 1.5 ≈ 10 meters.\n\nWait, but 10 meters seems small. Let me check units again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to use seconds throughout.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n1. **Convert speed to meters per second:**\n   - 2.5 hours = 2.5 × 3600 = 9000 seconds.\n   - Speed = 1000 meters / 9000 seconds ≈ 0.1111 meters per second.\n\n2. **Hallway Length:**\n   - Time = "
