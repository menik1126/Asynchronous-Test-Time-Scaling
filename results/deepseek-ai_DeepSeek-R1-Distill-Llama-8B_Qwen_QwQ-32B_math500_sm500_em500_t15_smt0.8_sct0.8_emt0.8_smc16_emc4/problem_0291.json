Okay, the problem says:\n\nLet \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i \\), and let \\( c = 2 - 3i \\). We need to find \\( w \\), which is the result when \\( z \\) is rotated around \\( c \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) counter-clockwise.\n\nHmm, rotating a complex number around another complex number. I remember that this can be done by translating the complex plane so that \\( c \\) is at the origin, then applying the rotation, and then translating back. \n\nFirst, let me recall that multiplying a complex number by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) rotates it by \\( \\theta \\) radians counter-clockwise. So, \\( e^{i\\pi/4} \\) would be our rotation factor here since we're rotating by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\).\n\nBut since we're rotating around \\( c \\), not the origin, we need to subtract \\( c \\) from \\( z \\), rotate, and then add \\( c \\) back. So, mathematically, that should be:\n\n\\( w = c + e^{i\\pi/4} (z - c) \\)\n\nOkay, let me write that down in terms of complex numbers. Let me denote \\( z = x + yi \\) and \\( c = a + bi \\). Then,\n\n\\( z - c = (x - a) + (y - b)i \\)\n\nMultiplying by \\( e^{i\\pi/4} \\), which is \\( \\cos(\\pi/4) + i\\sin(\\pi/4) \\), so:\n\n\\( e^{i\\pi/4} (z - c) = [\\cos(\\pi/4) + i\\sin(\\pi/4)][(x - a) + (y - b)i] \\)\n\nExpanding that, we get:\n\nReal part: \\( (x - a)\\cos(\\pi/4) - (y - b)\\sin(\\pi/4) \\)\nImaginary part: \\( (x - a)\\sin(\\pi/4) + (y - b)\\cos(\\pi/4) \\)\n\nThen, adding \\( c \\) back:\n\n\\( w ="
