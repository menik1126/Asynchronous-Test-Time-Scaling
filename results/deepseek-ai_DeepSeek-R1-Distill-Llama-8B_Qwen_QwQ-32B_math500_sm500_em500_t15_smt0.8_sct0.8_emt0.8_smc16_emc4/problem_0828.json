I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1 means that \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity, right? One is 1, and the other two are complex numbers. So, \u03c9 can be 1, or e^(2\u03c0i/3), or e^(4\u03c0i/3). Let me write those down:\n\n- \u03c9 = 1\n- \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) = cos(2\u03c0/3) + i sin(2\u03c0/3) = -1/2 + i\u221a3/2\n- \u03c9 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = cos(4\u03c0/3) + i sin(4\u03c0/3) = -1/2 - i\u221a3/2\n\nSo, I need to evaluate the expression for each of these \u03c9 and see what values I get.\n\nLet's start with \u03c9 = 1.\n\nIf \u03c9 = 1, then the expression becomes:\n\n1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1\u00b2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\n\nOkay, so when \u03c9 is 1, the value is 1.\n\nNow, let's try \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3). Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 1 + \u03c9. Since \u03c9 = -1/2 + i\u221a3/2, adding 1 gives:\n\n1 + \u03c9 = 1 + (-1/2) + i\u221a3/2 = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2\n\nSimilarly, \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = -1/2 - i\u221a3/2, so 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + (-1/2) - i\u221a3/2 = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2\n\nSo, 1/(1 + \u03c9) = 1/(1/2 + i\u221a3/2). Let me compute that. I can write this as:\n\n1/(1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = [1]/[ (1 + i\u221a"

            "output": "3)/2 ] = 2/(1 + i\u221a3)\n\nTo simplify this, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\n2/(1 + i\u221a3) * (1 - i\u221a3)/(1 - i\u221a3) = 2(1 - i\u221a3)/(1 + 3) = 2(1 - i\u221a3)/4 = (1 - i\u221a3)/2\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1/(1/2 - i\u221a3/2). Using the same method:\n\n1/(1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = [1]/[ (1 - i\u221a3)/2 ] = 2/(1 - i\u221a3)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by conjugate:\n\n2/(1 - i\u221a3) * (1 + i\u221a3)/(1 + i\u221a3) = 2(1 + i\u221a3)/(1 + 3) = 2(1 + i\u221a3)/4 = (1 + i\u221a3)/2\n\nNow, add the two results together:\n\n(1 - i\u221a3)/2 + (1 + i\u221a3)/2 = [1 + 1]/2 + [-i\u221a3 + i\u221a3]/2 = 2/2 + 0 = 1\n\nWait, so for \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3), the expression is also 1. Hmm, interesting.\n\nLet me check the same for \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3). Since \u03c9\u00b2 is the conjugate of \u03c9, I expect the same result.\n\nCompute 1 + \u03c9\u00b2. \u03c9\u00b2 = -1/2 - i\u221a3/2, so 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 - 1/2 - i\u221a3/2 = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2\n\nSimilarly, (\u03c9\u00b2)\u00b2 = \u03c9^4 = \u03c9^(3+1) = \u03c9^1 = \u03c9, so 1 + (\u03c9\u00b2)\u00b2 = 1 + \u03c9 = 1 + (-1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2\n\nWait, maybe I should just compute 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) and 1/(1 + (\u03c9\u00b2)^2) = 1/(1 + \u03c9). Hmm, but I already know that when I substitute \u03c9"

And when \u03c9 = 1, it's also 1. So, does that mean the only possible value is 1?\n\nBut that seems a bit surprising. Let me think again. Is there another way to compute this expression without plugging in each \u03c9?\n\nMaybe using algebra. Let me denote S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). I need to compute S.\n\nFirst, let me write \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so \u03c9 \u2260 1 because we've considered \u03c9 = 1 separately.\n\nSince \u03c9 \u2260 1, \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0. That's a known identity for cube roots of unity. So, \u03c9\u00b2 = -1 - \u03c9.\n\nWait, maybe I can use that to simplify.\n\nLet me compute S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + (-1 - \u03c9)) because \u03c9\u00b2 = -1 - \u03c9.\n\nSimplify the second denominator:\n\n1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + (-1 - \u03c9) = -\u03c9\n\nSo, S becomes:\n\n1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(-\u03c9)\n\nSo, S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) - 1/\u03c9\n\nWait, that's interesting. Maybe I can combine these terms.\n\nLet me write S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) - 1/\u03c9\n\nTo combine them, I can get a common denominator:\n\n[ \u03c9 - (1 + \u03c9) ] / [ \u03c9(1 + \u03c9) ]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\u03c9 - 1 - \u03c9 = -1"

So regardless of \u03c9 (as long as \u03c9 is a primitive cube root of unity, i.e., not 1), the expression S is 1. And when \u03c9 is 1, we already saw it's also 1. So, in all cases, the value is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, so that's a much simpler way. So, the answer is 1?\n\nBut let me check again with \u03c9 = 1. Let me substitute into the algebraic approach.\n\nIf \u03c9 = 1, then \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 as well. Then, the expression S = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that still holds.\n\nAlternatively, using the algebraic method:\n\nIf \u03c9 = 1, then \u03c9(1 + \u03c9) = 1*(1 + 1) = 2, so S = -1/(2). Wait, but that contradicts?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in the algebraic approach, I assumed that \u03c9\u00b2 = -1 - \u03c9, which is only true when \u03c9 is not 1. Because if \u03c9 = 1, then \u03c9\u00b2 = 1, and 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \u2260 0, so the identity \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0 doesn't hold for \u03c9 = 1. So, the algebraic approach is only valid when \u03c9 is a primitive root, i.e., not 1. So, when \u03c9 = 1, we have to handle it separately, but in that case, the expression is still 1."
