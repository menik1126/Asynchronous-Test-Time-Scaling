Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity, right? One is 1, and the other two are complex numbers. So, ω can be 1, or e^(2πi/3), or e^(4πi/3). Let me write those down:\n\n- ω = 1\n- ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2\n- ω = e^(4πi/3) = cos(4π/3) + i sin(4π/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2\n\nSo, I need to evaluate the expression for each of these ω and see what values I get.\n\nLet's start with ω = 1.\n\nIf ω = 1, then the expression becomes:\n\n1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1²) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\n\nOkay, so when ω is 1, the value is 1.\n\nNow, let's try ω = e^(2πi/3). Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω. Since ω = -1/2 + i√3/2, adding 1 gives:\n\n1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2) + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2\n\nSimilarly, ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2, so 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2) - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). Let me compute that. I can write this as:\n\n1/(1/2 + i√3/2) = [1]/[ (1 + i√"

Hmm, interesting.\n\nLet me check the same for ω² = e^(4πi/3). Since ω² is the conjugate of ω, I expect the same result.\n\nCompute 1 + ω². ω² = -1/2 - i√3/2, so 1 + ω² = 1 - 1/2 - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2\n\nSimilarly, (ω²)² = ω^4 = ω^(3+1) = ω^1 = ω, so 1 + (ω²)² = 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2\n\nWait, maybe I should just compute 1/(1 + ω²) and 1/(1 + (ω²)^2) = 1/(1 + ω).

Is there another way to compute this expression without plugging in each ω?\n\nMaybe using algebra. Let me denote S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I need to compute S.\n\nFirst, let me write ω³ = 1, so ω ≠ 1 because we've considered ω = 1 separately.\n\nSince ω ≠ 1, ω² + ω + 1 = 0. That's a known identity for cube roots of unity.

So regardless of ω (as long as ω is a primitive cube root of unity, i.e., not 1), the expression S is 1. And when ω is 1, we already saw it's also 1. So, in all cases, the value is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, so that's a much simpler way. So, the answer is 1?\n\nBut let me check again with ω = 1. Let me substitute into the algebraic approach.\n\nIf ω = 1, then ω² = 1 as well. Then, the expression S = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that still holds.\n\nAlternatively, using the algebraic method:\n\nIf ω = 1, then ω(1 + ω) = 1*(1 + 1) = 2, so S = -1/(2). Wait, but that contradicts?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in the algebraic approach, I assumed that ω² = -1 - ω, which is only true when ω is not 1. Because if ω = 1, then ω² = 1, and 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 ≠ 0, so the identity ω² + ω + 1 = 0 doesn't hold for ω = 1. So, the algebraic approach is only valid when ω is a primitive root, i.e., not 1. So, when ω = 1, we have to handle it separately, but in that case, the expression is still 1."
