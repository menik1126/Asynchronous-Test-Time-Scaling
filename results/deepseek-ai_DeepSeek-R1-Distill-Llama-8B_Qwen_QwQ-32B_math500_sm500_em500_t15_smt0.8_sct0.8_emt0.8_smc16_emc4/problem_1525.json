I need to find the sum of all possible values of n. Hmm, let me write down the problem again to make sure I have all the details.\n\nThe problem states:\n\nLet (a\u2081, a\u2082, \u2026, a\u2099) be a sequence of positive real numbers such that\n\n\u03a3a_i = 96,\n\n\u03a3a_i\u00b2 = 144,\n\n\u03a3a_i\u00b3 = 216.\n\nFind the sum of all possible values of n.\n\nAlright, so we have three equations with variables a_i, and we need to find n. The variables are all positive real numbers, which is important because it tells me that I don't have to worry about negative numbers messing up the sums or anything like that.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what each equation represents. The first equation is the sum of all the a_i's, which is 96. The second one is the sum of their squares, 144, and the third one is the sum of their cubes, 216.\n\nI know that for sequences, especially when we have these three sums, it might be helpful to think about moments or perhaps some identity that relates these sums. Wait, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something similar? Or perhaps using the concept of variance?\n\nWait, another approach: sometimes when you have sums of powers, you can relate them using the concept of moments, and maybe use some inequalities or identities to find constraints on the variables. Or perhaps if all the a_i's are equal, that might be a starting point.\n\nWait, let me think. If all the a_i's are equal, then each a_i would be 96/n, right? Because the sum is 96. Then the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)\u00b2 = 96\u00b2/n, which should equal 144. Let me check:\n\n96\u00b2 is 9216, so 9216/n = 144. Then n would be 9216 / 144 = 64. But 64 is a possible value for n? Wait, but the sum of cubes would then be n*(96/n)^3 = 96\u00b3 / n\u00b2. Let me compute 96\u00b3: 96*96=9216, 9216*96= let's see,"

If n is 64, then n squared is 4096, so 884736 / 4096 = let's see, 884736 divided by 4096. Let me compute 4096*216 = 4096*(200 + 16) = 4096*200 = 819200 and 4096*16=65536, so total 819200 + 65536 = 884736. So that's exactly 216. So if all the a_i are equal, then n=64 satisfies all three equations. So n=64 is one possible value.\n\nBut the question says \"the sum of all possible values of n\". So there might be other values of n where the a_i are not all equal but still satisfy the three equations. Hmm, so I need to find all possible n for which such a sequence exists, and then add them up.\n\nHmm, so how can there be other n's? Let me think. Maybe if some of the a_i are different, but arranged in such a way that the sums still work out. Maybe there's a case where some terms are larger and some are smaller, but the total sum, sum of squares, and sum of cubes still add up to 96, 144, 216 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to model this with variables. Let me consider that perhaps the sequence can be represented with some variables, maybe with some variables being equal. Let me think of the case where there are two different values, say, some number of a's and some number of b's. Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose that there are k terms equal to a and (n - k) terms equal to b. Then, the equations become:\n\nk*a + (n - k)*b = 96,\n\nk*a\u00b2 +"

Suppose n is larger than 64, but then the terms would have to be smaller on average. But the sum of squares is fixed at 144. Let me see.\n\nSuppose n=65. Then, if all terms were equal, each term would be 96/65 \u2248 1.4769. The sum of squares would be 65*(96/65)^2 = (96)^2 /65 \u2248 9216 /65 \u2248 141.78, which is less than 144. But the problem requires the sum of squares to be 144, so that's too small. Therefore, to get a higher sum of squares, some terms must be larger and some smaller. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, actually, the sum of squares can be increased by having some terms larger and some smaller, even if the average is lower. For example, if you have some terms equal to 2 and some equal to 1, the average might be 1.5, but the sum of squares would be higher than if all were 1.5.

Let me think of the three given sum conditions as equations involving the moments of the sequence. Maybe using the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum n, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to model this with variance. Let me compute the variance of the sequence.\n\nVariance = (\u03a3a_i\u00b2)/n - (\u03a3a_i)^2/n\u00b2 = 144/n - 96\u00b2/n\u00b2 = (144n - 9216)/n\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, if all a_i are equal, variance would be zero, so n=64. But for n>64, the variance is positive, which is allowed.\n\nWait, but does the variance relate to the sum of cubes? Maybe using some inequality involving variance and higher moments.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a different form or another inequality that involves higher moments.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I can try n=64 and see if that's the only solution.\n\nWait, earlier, when I tried the case where all a_i are equal, n=64 works. Now, I'm trying to see if n can be different. Maybe n can be other values, maybe 64 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the inequality that relates the sum of cubes to the sum and the sum of squares. Let me see, from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, (\u03a3a_i\u00b3)^2 \u2264 (\u03a3a_i\u00b2)(\u03a3a_i^4).\n\nWait, but I don't know \u03a3a_i"

So equality holds when all a_i are equal, so n=64 is the minimal n. But the problem says \"sum of all possible values of n\", so maybe n can be any number greater than or equal to 64? But that can't be, because the sum of squares is fixed at 144. Let me see.\n\nWait, for example, if n is larger than 64, say n=65, then the average of the a_i is 96/65 \u2248 1.4769.

Let me go back.\n\nWhen I substituted into the third equation, I had:\n\n3*96*k\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 3*96^2*k a + 96^3 = 72.\n\nWait, that led to dividing by 3:\n\n96 k\u00b2 a\u00b2 -96^2 k a + 96^3 = 24.\n\nWait, 72/3 is 24, not 72/96. Wait, wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, after expanding, I had:\n\n3*96*k\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 3*96^2*k a + 96^3 = 216.\n\nThen I divided by 3:\n\n96 k\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 96^2 k a + 96^3 = 72.\n\nWait, that's correct. Then, 96 k\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 96^2 k a + 96^3 = 72.\n\nThen, factor 96:\n\n96*(k\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 96 k a + 96^2) = 72.\n\nSo,\n\nk\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 96 k a + 96^2 = 72/96 = 3/4.\n\nSo that term becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 a\u00b2 - 96k a + 96^2 - 3/4=0.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nThen, from equation 1, we had:\n\n(k +1) a\u00b2 = 192 a - (9072/k).\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = (192 a - 9072/k)/(k +1).\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\nk\u00b2 * [ (192 a - 9072/k) / (k +1) ] - 96k a + (9216 - 3/4) = 0.\n\nWhich led to a complicated equation.\n\nPerhaps instead of assuming that only two different values exist, maybe the problem only allows for n=64, making it the only possible value. Therefore, the sum of all possible n is 64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the case where all a_i's are equal except one. But this might not lead to a different n.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider the case where all a_i's are equal except for"
