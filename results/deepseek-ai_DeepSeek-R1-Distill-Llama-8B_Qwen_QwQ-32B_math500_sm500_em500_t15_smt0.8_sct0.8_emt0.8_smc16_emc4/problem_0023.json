Let's break this down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Modulus of \\(1 - i\\)\nThe modulus (or absolute value) of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is given by:\n\\[\n|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\nApplying this to \\(1 - i\\):\n\\[\n|1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Raise the Modulus to the 8th Power\nSince the modulus of a complex number raised to a power is the modulus raised to that power:\n\\[\n|1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{(1/2) \\times 8} = 2^4 = 16\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
