Hmm, let me write that down first to visualize it better.\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\n\\]\nAlright, so the cube root of something is 16. To get rid of the cube root, I should cube both sides of the equation. That seems like a good first step.\n\nCubing both sides:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3\n\\]\nSimplifying that, the cube and the cube root cancel each other on the left side, so I get:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3\n\\]\nNow, what's 16 cubed? Let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Let me do 256 * 10 = 2560, 256*6=1536. Adding those together: 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, 16^3 is 4096.\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\\]\nHmm, okay, let's get all terms to one side so we can form a quadratic equation. I'll subtract 4096 from both sides to move it to the left.\n\nSubtracting 4096:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\\]\nSimplifying the constants:\n4 - 4096 = -4092\n\nSo the equation is:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\\]\nNow I have a quadratic equation. I need to solve for \\( x \\). Since it's a quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula: \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\).\n\nIn this equation, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -4092 \\).\n\nPlugging these into the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-"

            "output": "(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\nSimplify each part step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( -(-4) = 4 \\).\n\nNext, the discriminant \\( D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092) \\). Let me compute each part:\n\n\\( (-4)^2 = 16 \\).\n\nThen, \\( -4(1)(-4092) = +4 * 4092 \\). Let me calculate 4 * 4000 = 16,000 and 4 * 92 = 368. So adding those gives 16,000 + 368 = 16,368.\n\nSo the discriminant is:\n16 + 16,368 = 16,384.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but okay. So \\( D = 16,384 \\). Now, let me see if that's a perfect square. Hmm, I know that 128 squared is 16,384 because 128 * 128 is 16,384. Let me check: 128*100=12,800, 128*28=3,584. Adding those: 12,800 + 3,584 = 16,384. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the square root of 16,384 is 128. Now plugging back into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2}\n\\]\nSo we have two solutions:\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66 \\)\n2. \\( x = \\frac{4 - 128}{2} = \\frac{-124}{2} = -62 \\)\n\nWait, the problem asks for the positive value of \\( x \\), so that's 66.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, I should check my answer.\n\nLet's plug \\( x = 66 \\) back into the original equation to see if it works.\n\nFirst, compute \\( x^2 -4x +4 \\):\n\\( 66^2 = 4356 \\)\n\\( 4x = 264 \\)\nSo,\n\\( 4356 - 264 + 4 = 4356 - 264 is 4092, then 4092 +4 is 409"

So the cube root of 4096 is 16, so \\( x = -62 \\) is also a solution, but since the question asks for the positive value, 66 is the answer.\n\nI think that's correct.

Simplified the equation to a quadratic.\n3. Applied the quadratic formula correctly, making sure to compute the discriminant properly.\n4. Calculated the discriminant correctly by recognizing it as a square of 128.\n5. Solved for both roots and selected the positive one.\n6.
