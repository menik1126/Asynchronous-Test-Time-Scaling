            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out step by step. Let me write it down first: x = \u221a(11 - 2x) + 4.\n\nAlright, first things first. Since there's a square root in the equation, I remember that usually, the strategy is to isolate the square root term and then square both sides to eliminate it. So, maybe I should start by getting rid of that square root. How do I do that? Well, I can subtract 4 from both sides to get x - 4 by itself on one side.\n\nSo, subtracting 4 from both sides gives: x - 4 = \u221a(11 - 2x). Nice, that simplifies things a bit. Now, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. That should help me eliminate the radical. Let me do that.\n\nSquaring both sides gives: (x - 4)^2 = (\u221a(11 - 2x))^2. Simplifying both sides, the square and the square root should cancel each other out. So, on the left side, I have (x - 4)^2, and on the right, I have 11 - 2x.\n\nNow, let me expand the left side. (x - 4)^2 is equal to x^2 - 8x + 16. So, putting it all together, the equation becomes: x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x. Okay, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side so that I can solve for x.\n\nSubtracting 11 and adding 2x to both sides: x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0. Combining like terms, the x terms: -8x + 2x is -6x. And 16 - 11 is 5. So, the equation simplifies to x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0. \n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. I can try to factor this. Let me think about two numbers that multiply to 5 and"

            "output": " add up to -6. Well, 5 is a prime number, so the factors are 1 and 5. Since both the middle term is negative and the constant term is positive, both numbers should be negative. So, (-1) and (-5) multiply to positive 5 and add up to -6. Perfect.\n\nSo, factoring the quadratic equation: (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0. Setting each factor equal to zero gives the potential solutions: x = 1 and x = 5. \n\nBut wait, I can't just stop here. I need to check these solutions in the original equation to make sure they work because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions that don't actually satisfy the original equation.\n\nLet me start with x = 1. Plugging it into the original equation: 1 = \u221a(11 - 2*1) + 4. Calculating inside the square root: 11 - 2 is 9. So, \u221a9 is 3. Then, adding 4 gives 3 + 4 = 7. So, 1 vs. 7. That's not equal. Therefore, x = 1 is an extraneous solution and doesn't work.\n\nNow, checking x = 5: 5 = \u221a(11 - 2*5) + 4. Calculating inside the square root: 11 - 10 is 1. \u221a1 is 1. Adding 4 gives 1 + 4 = 5. So, 5 = 5. That works! So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, did I miss any other possible solutions? Let me think about the domain of the original equation. The expression inside the square root, 11 - 2x, must be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real numbers. So, 11 - 2x \u2265 0.\n\nSolving for x: 11 \u2265 2x, which means x \u2264 11/2, which is 5.5. So, x has to be less than or equal to 5.5. Both solutions I found, x = 1 and x = 5, satisfy this condition because 1 \u2264 5.5 and 5 \u2264 5.5. However, we already saw that x"

So, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nLet me summarize the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Original equation: x = \u221a(11 - 2x) + 4.\n2. Subtract 4: x - 4 = \u221a(11 - 2x).\n3. Square both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x.\n4. Expand left side: x\u00b2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x.\n5. Bring all terms to one side: x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = 0.\n6.

Domain check: x \u2264 5.5, both solutions are within this, but only x = 5 is valid.\n9. Therefore, x = 5 is the only solution.\n\nI think that's pretty thorough.
