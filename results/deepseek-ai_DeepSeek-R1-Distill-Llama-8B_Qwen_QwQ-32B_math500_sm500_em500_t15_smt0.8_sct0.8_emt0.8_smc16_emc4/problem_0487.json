Our goal is to find the volume of the original cube.\n\nNext, I'll determine the relationship between the sphere and the cube. When metal is removed from the cube's corners, each corner becomes a quarter-cylinder of the sphere. Since there are 8 corners in a cube, we'll have 8 quarter-cylinders, which together make up a full cylinder.\n\nThe sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is 6 inches. The volume of the sphere is (4/3)πr³, which is (4/3)π*(3)³ = 36π cubic inches.\n\nHowever, since each corner contributes a quarter of a cylinder, the total volume removed from the cube is equal to the volume of a full cylinder with the same diameter as the sphere. The volume of the cylinder is πr²h. Using the sphere's diameter as the height, the volume is π*(3)²*6 = 54π cubic inches.\n\nFinally, to find the volume of the cube, I'll add the volume of the sphere and the volume of the cylinder. This gives 36π + 54π = 90π cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube\n\nWhen metal is removed from each corner of the cube to form the steel sphere, each corner is essentially replaced by a quarter-cylinder shape. Since there are 8 corners in a cube, the total volume removed from the cube is equivalent to the volume of a full cylinder.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Steel Sphere\n\nThe sphere has a radius of 3 inches. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the radius:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi ("

            "output": "27) = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Dimensions of the Cylinder Removed from the Cube\n\nThe cylinder formed by removing metal from the cube's corners must have a diameter equal to the sphere's diameter (since the sphere fits perfectly within the cube). The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diameter} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nThe height of the cylinder must also equal the sphere's diameter to ensure the sphere fits within the cube. Thus, the cylinder has a radius of 3 inches and a height of 6 inches.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Cylinder\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (6) = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 6 = 54\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Volume of the Original Cube\n\nThe original cube must contain both the volume of the sphere and the volume of the removed metal (the cylinder). Therefore, the total volume of the cube is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cube}} = V_{\\text{sphere}} + V_{\\text{cylinder}} = 36\\pi + 54\\pi = 90\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe volume of the cube is \\boxed{90\\pi} cubic inches."
