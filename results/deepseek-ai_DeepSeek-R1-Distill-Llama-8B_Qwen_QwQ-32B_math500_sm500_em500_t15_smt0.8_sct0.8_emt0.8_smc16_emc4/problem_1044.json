            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out the number of different possible rational roots for this polynomial: 2x⁴ + a₃x³ + a₂x² + a₁x + 1 = 0. The polynomial has integer coefficients, and I'm supposed to find how many different possible rational roots there could be. Hmm, I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients is of the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. So in this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. That means the possible values of p are factors of 1, and the possible values of q are factors of 2.\n\nLet me list out the factors of 1. Well, since 1 is a prime number, its only factors are ±1. So p can be 1 or -1. Now, for q, since the leading coefficient is 2, the factors are ±1 and ±2. So q can be 1, -1, 2, or -2. But since denominators are just about the magnitude, I can consider q as 1 and 2 because we can take the absolute value or positive denominators only for simplicity when considering distinct roots.\n\nSo, possible values of p/q are:\n\nWhen q = 1: p can be 1 or -1, so possible roots are 1/1 = 1 and -1/1 = -1.\n\nWhen q = 2: p can still be 1 or -1, so possible roots are 1/2 and -1/2.\n\nWait, but the possible roots are 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. Are there any others? Since 1's factors are only ±1 and 2's factors are ±1 and ±2, but I think in terms of possible denominators, q can be 1, 2, -1, -2, but when considering the form p/q, we can consider the denominators as positive because any negative sign can be absorbed into the numerator, so to avoid duplicate roots, we only take q positive. So that reduces the possible roots to 1, -1, 1/2, and -"

The possible p/q combinations are indeed 1/1, -1/1, 1/2, -1/2. So yes, four different rational numbers. But wait, maybe I need to check if these are actually possible given the polynomial's structure?\n\nWait, the polynomial is of degree 4, so it can have up to four roots, but the question is about the number of different possible rational roots, not the number of roots the polynomial can have. Since the coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁ can be any integers, the possible rational roots could be any of those four, but maybe some of them can't be roots for any choice of coefficients? Hmm, maybe I need to check if each of these candidates can actually be a root for some integer coefficients.\n\nLet me test each possible rational root to see if there exists coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁ such that when substituted into the polynomial, the equation holds.\n\nStarting with x = 1:\n\nPlugging into the polynomial: 2(1)^4 + a₃(1)^3 + a₂(1)^2 + a₁(1) + 1 = 0\n\nSimplifies to: 2 + a₃ + a₂ + a₁ + 1 = 0 → a₃ + a₂ + a₁ = -3\n\nSince a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, this equation is possible. For example, set a₃ = 0, a₂ = 0, then a₁ = -3. So yes, x=1 can be a root.\n\nNext, x = -1:\n\nPlugging in: 2(-1)^4 + a₃(-1)^3 + a₂(-1)^2 + a₁(-1) + 1 = 0\n\nCalculates to: 2(1) + a₃(-1) + a₂(1) + a₁(-1) + 1 = 0 → 2 - a₃ + a₂ - a₁ + 1 = 0 → -a₃ + a₂ - a₁ = -3\n\nAgain, this is an equation with integer coefficients.
