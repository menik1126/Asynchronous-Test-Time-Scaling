This means we need to subtract the scenarios where both have ordered the same dish.\n\nThere are 10 possible scenarios where Yann and Camille order the same dish (Yann orders dish 1 and Camille orders dish 1, Yann orders dish 2 and Camille orders dish 2, and so on up to dish 10).\n\nTherefore, we subtract these 10 unwanted scenarios from the total of 100.\n\n100 total combinations minus 10 unwanted scenarios equals 90 valid combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order without selecting the same dish, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Total Possible Combinations Without Restrictions:**\n   \n   - **Yann's Choices:** 10 dishes.\n   - **Camille's Choices:** 10 dishes.\n   \n   Since each person's choice is independent, the total number of combinations is:\n   \n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 10 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 100 \\text{ combinations}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the Unwanted Scenarios Where Both Order the Same Dish:**\n   \n   - There are 10 possible scenarios where both Yann and Camille order the exact same dish (e.g., both choose dish 1, both choose dish 2, etc.).\n   \n   Subtract these from the total combinations:\n   \n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ total combinations} - 10 \\text{ unwanted scenarios} = 90 \\text{ valid combinations}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
