Solving quartic equations can be pretty complicated, but maybe there's a substitution or some factorization I can do here.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \\).

The coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Let me write them down:\n\n- \\( z^4 \\) term: 1\n- \\( z^3 \\) term: 4i\n- \\( z^2 \\) term: -6\n- \\( z \\) term: -4i\n- Constant term: -i\n\nHmm, that's interesting.

Let me try to factor it.\n\nAssume that \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = (z^2 + a z + b)(z^2 + c z + d) \\).

    "question": "The solutions of the equation $z^4+4z^3i-6z^2-4zi-i=0$ are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane.  The area of this polygon can be expressed in the form $p^{a/b},$ where $a,$ $b,$ $p$ are positive integers, $p$ is prime, and $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime.  Find $a + b + p.$"
