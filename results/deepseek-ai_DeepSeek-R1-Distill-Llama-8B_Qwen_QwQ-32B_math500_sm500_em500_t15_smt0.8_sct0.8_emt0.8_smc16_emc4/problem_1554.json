Let me re-examine:\n\nWait, actually, in circular permutations where rotations are considered the same, fixing one person's position is correct. However, the sides are fixed in direction (e.g., north, east, south, west), so swapping the two people on a side does not create a rotation. Therefore, the initial calculation is correct.\n\nBut let me confirm with another method:\n\nAlternative method:\n- Total linear arrangements (if the table were a line): \\(8!\\), but since it's a square table with rotational symmetry, divide by 4 rotations (rotating 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0). However, this is only if rotations are considered the same. But also, the sides have two seats each, so perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises here. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. A square table has rotational symmetry of order 4 (rotating by 90\u00b0 cycles the positions). \n\nThe standard formula for circular arrangements with rotational symmetry is \\((n-1)!\\). But here, the table has a square shape with two seats per side, so the seats are in fixed positions relative to the table's sides. However, the problem says rotations are considered the same. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the table is not fixed in space, so rotating the entire table doesn't change the seating arrangement. Therefore, we need to divide by the number of rotations (4). \n\nAlternatively, fixing one person's seat accounts for rotational symmetry. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose we fix one person at a specific seat (e.g., the first seat on the north side). Then, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways."

But in this case, with a square table and sides, it's different. Fixing one person's seat is correct because rotations are considered equivalent. The 2^4 accounts for swapping within each side. \n\nBut wait, actually, if we fix one person's seat, that already accounts for the rotation, so the internal arrangements (swapping within sides) just multiply by 2 for each side.\n\nTherefore, the correct number is 7! \u00d7 2^4 = 80640.\n\nBut wait, that seems high.

Wait, actually, if we fix A at seat 1, then seat 2 can be any of the remaining 7, but swapping seat 2 with seat 1 would require moving A, which is fixed. Therefore, the swapping within the side is already accounted for in the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2^4 factor is not needed?\n\nWait, confusion arises here. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a square table with two seats per side. Each side has two seats. The key is whether the seats are distinguishable. If the seats are labeled (like seat 1a and 1b on the north side), then swapping the two on a side is a different arrangement. However, if the table is not labeled, but the sides are fixed (like a real table with a north side), then the two seats on a side are distinguishable by their position (left and right, for example). \n\nHowever, the problem states that rotations are considered equivalent. So rotating the entire table so that a different side faces north would make the configuration equivalent. Therefore, the seats are not labeled in a fixed direction; only their relative positions matter.\n\nWait, but when we fix a person's position, we are effectively choosing a reference point, so that rotations are accounted for. \n\nLet me try the small example again with 4 people:\n\nSuppose 4 people at a square table with 1 person per side (so 1 seat per side). The number of distinct arrangements is (4-1)! = 6. \n\nBut if there are 2 people per side (total 8 people), then fixing one person's seat (say, seat 1 on the north side) would mean the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways. However, each side has two seats, so for each of the remaining sides, the two people can be arranged in 2 ways.

Then, arrange the remaining people in the other seats, considering that on each side, the two seats are distinguishable by their positions (left/right or first/second).\n\nTherefore, after fixing one seat, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. But for each side (except the one with the fixed person), there is a choice of how to arrange the two people on that side. However, since we've fixed one seat, the other seat on that side can be occupied by any of the remaining people, so the 2^4 factor might not apply here.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Since we fixed one seat, the other seats on each side are distinguishable, so their arrangement is part of the permutation. Therefore, the total number is 7!.\n\nBut wait, in that case, for the smaller example with 4 people, we would have:\n\n- Fix person A at seat 1.

Perhaps I need to consider the problem differently.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's refer to the formula for circular arrangements with indistinct rotations and distinguishable sides.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nNumber of distinct arrangements = (n-1)! / (k_1! k_2! ... k_m!) \n\nBut when the table is square, it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, since the table is square and rotations are equivalent, fix one seat, then arrange the rest.

The second seat on the north side (seat 2) can be any of the remaining 7 people. The east side has two seats (3 and 4), which can be filled by any of the remaining 6 people, with 6\u00d75 ways, but considering the order (seat 3 vs seat 4). Similarly for the other sides.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is indeed 7! (since after fixing A, the remaining 7 seats can be filled in 7! ways). The swapping within each side is already included in the permutation because seat 2 is a distinct seat from seat 1, so choosing someone for seat 2 is different from seat 1. Therefore, the 2^4 factor is not needed.\n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier thought. So which is correct?\n\nLet me think of the seats as labeled. If the seats are labeled (like seat 1 to seat 8), then fixing one seat and permuting the rest gives 7!.\n\nBut if the seats are not labeled, but the sides are fixed (like the table has a north, east, etc., side), then the seats are distinguishable by their position relative to the sides. Therefore, the seats are effectively labeled by their side and position (first or second on the side). Thus, the total number of arrangements is 7!.\n\nHowever, the problem states that rotations are considered equivalent. So if you rotate the table, the same arrangement is counted as one. By fixing a person's seat, we've already accounted for rotations, so the remaining seats are distinguishable (since their positions relative to the fixed person are known). Therefore, the total number is 7!.\n\nBut then where does the 2^4 come in?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem allows for flipping the table (i.e., reflections), but the problem doesn't mention that.

So 0.\n\nFixed arrangements under 180\u00b0 rotation: For an arrangement to be fixed under 180\u00b0 rotation, seat 1 must equal seat 5, seat 2 = seat 6, seat 3 = seat 7, seat 4 = seat 8. Since all are distinct, this requires that the pairs (1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8) are the same person, which is impossible. So 0.\n\nFixed arrangements under 270\u00b0 rotation: Same as 90\u00b0, so"

However, when considering the table as a fixed object with sides (like a square table with north, south, etc.), the formula is slightly different.\n\nIn this case, the table has 8 seats with 2 on each side. The rotational symmetry is 4 (rotations by 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0).

But with the square table, it's better to use Burnside's lemma.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10080.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier small example with 4 people, using Burnside's lemma:\n\nFixed arrangements under identity: 4! = 24.\n\nUnder 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0, fixed arrangements: 0 each.\n\nTotal: 24, divided by 4: 6, which is correct (since for 4 people at a square table, with one on each side, the number is 3! = 6).\n\nSimilarly, with 8 people, it would be 8! /4 = 10080.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10080.\n\nBut let me confirm with the approach where you fix one seat:\n\nIf you fix one"

Let me see another perspective.\n\nSuppose the table has 8 seats labeled 1 through 8 in clockwise order. A rotation by 90\u00b0 moves each seat to the next one. The group of rotations is of order 4. The number of distinct arrangements is the number of orbits under this group's action. Burnside's lemma says it's the average number of fixed points, which we calculated as 10080.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10080.\n\nHowever, another way to think is that fixing one seat (say seat 1) to account for rotations, then the remaining 7 seats can be arranged freely, giving 7!.\n\nBut since the rotation group has order 4, fixing one seat is not sufficient because the group is of order 4, not 8.
