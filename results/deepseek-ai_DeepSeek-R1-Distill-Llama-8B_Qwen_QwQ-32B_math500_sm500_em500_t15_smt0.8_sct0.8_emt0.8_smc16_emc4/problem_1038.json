The final answer should be \\(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1)\\).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to factor the given polynomial. It looks like a degree 8 polynomial in \\(x\\), and it's written as \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). Hmmm, that structure seems a bit similar to a quadratic in terms of \\(x^4\\). Let me try substituting \\(y = x^4\\) to see if that helps.\n\nSo, substituting \\(y = x^4\\), the equation becomes:\n\\[y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\\]\nNow, let's solve this quadratic equation for \\(y\\). Using the quadratic formula:\n\\[y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2}\\]\n\nThat gives two solutions:\n1. \\(y = \\frac{-3 + 5}{2} = 1\\)\n2. \\(y = \\frac{-3 - 5}{2} = -4\\)\n\nSo, substituting back, we have \\(x^4 = 1\\) and \\(x^4 = -4\\). These are the roots we need to consider.\n\nLet's start with \\(x^4 = 1\\). The solutions to this equation are the fourth roots of unity. That is, \\(x = 1\\), \\(x = -1\\), \\(x = i\\), and \\(x = -i\\). Since we're factoring over the integers, which are real numbers, we can pair these complex roots into quadratic factors with real coefficients.\n\nSo, \\(x^4 - 1\\) factors as \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\), because:\n- \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\)\n- \\(x^2 + 1\\) is irreducible over the"

So far, that's two factors.\n\nNext, we have the equation \\(x^4 = -4\\). Let's write this as \\(x^4 + 4 = 0\\). This looks like a biquadratic equation. I remember that \\(x^4 + a^4\\) can sometimes be factored using the Sophie Germain identity. Let me recall: \\(a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2)\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), then \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\).\n\nLet me check that multiplication:\n\\[(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 -4x^2 +4x + 2x^2 -4x +4\\]\nCombine like terms:\n- \\(x^4\\)\n- \\(-2x^3 + 2x^3 = 0\\)\n- \\(2x^2 -4x^2 + 2x^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(4x -4x = 0\\)\n- \\(+4\\)\n\nSo, yes, that's correct: \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Both of these quadratics have discriminant \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), which is negative, so they are irreducible over the integers. So, that gives us two more factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the original polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4\\) factors as:\n\\[(x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\]\n\nNow, I need to compute \\(p_1(1) +"
