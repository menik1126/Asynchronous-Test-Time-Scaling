I think I need to solve for x using the two logarithmic equations given. Let me write them down clearly:\n\n1. $\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2$\n2. $\\log_y 5x = 2$\n\nAlright, starting with the first equation. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying the arguments. So, using the logarithm addition rule:\n\n$\\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (a \\times c)$.\n\nApplying that here, equation 1 becomes:\n\n$\\log_6 ((x - y)(x + y)) = 2$.\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the log:\n\n$(x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2$, so:\n\n$\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2$.\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that $\\log_b a = c$ is equivalent to $b^c = a$.\n\nSo, applying that here:\n\n$6^2 = x^2 - y^2$.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n$36 = x^2 - y^2$. Let's label this as equation (3).\n\nNow, moving on to equation (2): $\\log_y 5x = 2$. Again, I can rewrite this in exponential form. That gives:\n\n$y^2 = 5x$.\n\nSo, equation (2) simplifies to:\n\n$y^2 = 5x$. Let's call this equation (4).\n\nNow, my goal is to find x, so I need to solve these equations together. I have equation (3): $36 = x^2 - y^2$ and equation (4): $y^2 = 5x$.\n\nI think I can substitute equation (4) into equation (3) to eliminate y. Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation (4), y\u00b2 = 5x.

Let me rearrange it to standard form:\n\nx\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 + 144)] / 2, because the quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c, so a=1, b=-5, c=-36.\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\nsqrt(25 + 144) = sqrt(169) = 13.\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\nx = [5 + 13]/2 = 18/2 = 9,\n\nor x = [5 - 13]/2 = (-8)/2 = -4.\n\nWait, but x is inside logarithms in the original equations. Logarithms are only defined for positive numbers. So, let's check if these solutions are valid.\n\nFirst, let me check x = 9.\n\nFrom equation (4): y\u00b2 = 5x = 5*9 = 45. So, y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Let's keep in mind that y could be positive or negative, but we have to check the original logarithm arguments.\n\nLooking at the first equation: $\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2$. The arguments of the logs must be positive. So:\n\nx - y > 0,\n\nx + y > 0.\n\nIf x = 9, then y = sqrt(45) \u2248 6.708 or y = -sqrt(45) \u2248 -6.708.\n\nFirst, let's take y = sqrt(45). Then:\n\nx - y = 9 - 6.708 \u2248 2.292 > 0,\n\nx + y = 9 + 6.708 \u2248 15.708 > 0.\n\nSo, that works. Now, if y = -sqrt(45):\n\nx - y = 9 - (-6.708) \u2248 15.708 > 0,\n\nx + y = 9 + (-6.708) \u2248 2.292 > 0.\n\nEither way, the arguments are positive, so x=9 seems valid"

So, y\u00b2 = -20 is not possible with real numbers. Therefore, x = -4 is invalid.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nLet me double-check by plugging back into the original equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n$\\log_6 (9 - y) + \\log_6 (9 + y) = 2$.\n\nWe know from equation (4): y\u00b2 = 45, so y = sqrt(45) \u2248 6.708 or y = -sqrt(45) \u2248 -6.708.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nCase 1: y = sqrt(45).\n\nThen:\n\n$\\log_6 (9 - sqrt(45)) + \\log_6 (9 + sqrt(45))$.\n\nWe can combine the logs:\n\n$\\log_6 [(9 - sqrt(45))(9 + sqrt(45))] = \\log_6 (81 - 45) = \\log_6 (36) = 2$, since 6^2 = 36. That works.\n\nCase 2: y = -sqrt(45).\n\nThen:\n\n$\\log_6 (9 - (-sqrt(45))) + \\log_6 (9 + (-sqrt(45)))$.\n\nWhich is:\n\n$\\log_6 (9 + sqrt(45)) + \\log_6 (9 - sqrt(45))$.\n\nAgain, combining:\n\n$\\log_6 [(9 + sqrt(45))(9 - sqrt(45))] = \\log_6 (81 - 45) = \\log_6 (36) = 2$. So that also works.\n\nNow, let's check equation (2): $\\log_y (5x) = 2$.\n\nWe have x = 9, so 5x = 45. Thus:\n\n$\\log_y 45 = 2$.\n\nWhich implies y^2 = 45, which matches our earlier result. So everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, x = 9 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nSo, after solving the equations, we find that \\( x = 9 \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Given Equations:**\n   - \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log"
