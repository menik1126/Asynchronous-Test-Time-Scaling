There are 10 different dishes.\n\nSince each person will order one dish and they refuse to order the same dish, I'll consider the possible selections for Yann first.\n\nYann has 10 options to choose from.\n\nAfter Yann has chosen, Camille must select a dish different from Yann's choice. That leaves 9 options for Camille.\n\nTo find the total number of different combinations, I'll multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has after Yann's selection.\n\nSo, 10 options for Yann multiplied by 9 options for Camille equals 90 different combinations.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order.\n\n1. **Total Dishes Available:**\n   - There are **10** different dishes on the menu.\n\n2. **Possible Choices for Yann:**\n   - Yann has **10** options to choose from.\n\n3. **Possible Choices for Camille After Yann's Selection:**\n   - Since Camille refuses to order the same dish as Yann, there are **9** remaining options for Camille.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Combinations:**\n   - The total number of unique combinations is the product of Yann's and Camille's choices:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
