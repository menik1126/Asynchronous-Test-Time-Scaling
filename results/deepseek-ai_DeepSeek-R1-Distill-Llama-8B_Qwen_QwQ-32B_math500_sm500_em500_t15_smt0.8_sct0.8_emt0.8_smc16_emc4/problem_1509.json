Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet and each of the two positions must be different, the first letter has 26 possibilities. For the second letter, there are 25 remaining choices.\n\nNext, I'll consider the numbers. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9), and the same digit can be used in both positions since repetitions are allowed. This means there are 10 options for the first number and 10 options for the second number.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I'll multiply the number of choices for the letters by the number of choices for the numbers: 26 * 25 * 10 * 10.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many license plates can be formed under the given conditions, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nCreate a license plate with the following structure:\n- **First Character:** Any letter from A to Z\n- **Second Character:** Any different letter from A to Z\n- **Third Character:** Any digit from 0 to 9\n- **Fourth Character:** Any different digit from 0 to 9\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Letters (Position 1 and 2):**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).\n   - Since the two letters must be different, the number of options for the second letter is reduced by one.\n   \n   **Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   26 \\text{ letters} \\times 25 \\text{ remaining letters} = 650 \\text{ combinations for letters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Digits (Position 3 and 4):**\n   - There are 10 digits in the English numbering system (0-9).\n   - Both digits can be the same or different.\n   \n   **Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ digits} \\times 10 \\text{ digits} = 100 \\text{ combinations for digits}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Combinations:**\n   - Multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n   \n   **Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   650 \\text{ (letters)} \\times 100 \\text{ (digits)} = 65,\\!000 \\text{ total license plates}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed"
