            "output": "To solve this problem, I'll start by defining the variables involved. Let's denote Denali's original number of dogs as D = 16 and Nate's original number as N = 12. The ratio of their pay will be determined by the ratio of their dogs.\n\nUnder the first scenario, Denali takes on 4x more dogs, so Denali's new number of dogs becomes D + 4x = 16 + 4x. Meanwhile, Nate's number of dogs remains the same at 12. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay in this case will be proportional to the ratio of their dogs: (16 + 4x)/12.\n\nUnder the second scenario, x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali. This means Denali's new number of dogs becomes D + x = 16 + x, while Nate's number of dogs decreases to N - x = 12 - x. The ratio of their pay in this case is (16 + x)/(12 - x).\n\nAccording to the problem, these two ratios are equal. Therefore, I can set up the equation:\n\n(16 + 4x)/12 = (16 + x)/(12 - x)\n\nTo solve for x, I'll cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:\n\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n192 - 16x + 48x - 4x\u00b2 = 192 + 12x\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n192 + 32x - 4x\u00b2 = 192 + 12x\n\nSubtracting 192 from both sides:\n\n32x - 4x\u00b2 = 12x\n\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\n-4x\u00b2 + 20x = 0\n\nFactoring out -4x:\n\n-4x(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx = 0 or x = 5\n\nSince x \u2260 0, the solution is x = 5.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Let\u2019s define:**\n- Denali's original number of dogs = \\( D = 16 \\)\n- Nate's original number of dogs = \\( N = 12 \\)\n- The number of dogs to be assigned or reassigned in groups = \\( x \\)\n\n**Scenario 1:**  \nDenali walks \\( "

    "question": "Denali and Nate work for a dog walking business and are paid for each dog they walk. Denali is responsible for $16$ dogs and Nate is responsible for $12$ dogs. Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali. Find $x$ if $x\\neq0$."
