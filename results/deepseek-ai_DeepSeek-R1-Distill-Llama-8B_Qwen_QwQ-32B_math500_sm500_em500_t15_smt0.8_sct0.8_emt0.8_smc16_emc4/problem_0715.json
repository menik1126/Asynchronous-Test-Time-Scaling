            "output": "Alright, so I need to figure out how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that intercepts are points where the graph crosses the axes. The y-intercepts are the points where the graph crosses the y-axis. On the y-axis, the value of x is always 0. So, to find the y-intercepts, I should set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for y. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let's substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\( 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\)\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in terms of y. To solve this, I can rearrange it so that it's in the standard quadratic form, \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\). Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nQuadratic equations can have two solutions, one solution, or no real solutions depending on the discriminant. The discriminant is given by \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\). If D is positive, there are two real solutions; if D is zero, one solution; and if D is negative, no real solutions.\n\nLet me calculate the discriminant for this equation:\n\n\\( D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\)\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. \\( b^2 \\) is 16, and \\( 4ac \\) is 4*1*(-1) which is -4, so subtracting a negative makes it addition. So, 16 + 4 is indeed 20. Okay, so D = 20.\n\nSince 20 is positive, that means the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. Therefore, there are two y-intercepts for the graph of this parabola.\n\nBut hold on, let me visualize the parabola to make sure I understand. The equation is \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\). This is a parabola that opens to the right or to the left. Since the coefficient of \\("

The vertex of this parabola will give me more information about its position.\n\nTo find the vertex, I can complete the square or use the vertex formula. The vertex occurs at \\( y = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\) for a quadratic in the form \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\). Wait, actually, in the standard form \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\), the vertex occurs at \\( y = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\). So in this case, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), so \\( y = -(-4)/(2*1) = 4/2 = 2 \\).\n\nSo the vertex is at y = 2. Let me plug this back into the equation to find the x-coordinate of the vertex:\n\n\\( x = (2)^2 - 4*(2) - 1 = 4 - 8 - 1 = -5 \\).\n\nSo the vertex is at (-5, 2). That's the minimum point of the parabola since it's opening to the right.\n\nNow, since the vertex is at x = -5, which is to the left of the y-axis (x=0), and the parabola opens to the right, it will definitely cross the y-axis. Moreover, since it's a parabola symmetric about its vertex, which is to the left, the arms of the parabola will extend to the right, crossing the y-axis at two points as we found earlier.\n\nWait, but the quadratic equation had two real solutions, which translate to two y-intercepts. That aligns with the earlier conclusion.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me find the actual y-intercepts by solving the quadratic equation.\n\nThe equation is \\( y^2 -4y -1 = 0 \\). Using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{D}}{2a} = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2*1} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\).\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\( y = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{5} \\).\n\nSo, the two"

Since both of these are real numbers, there are indeed two distinct y-intercepts.\n\nTherefore, the graph of the parabola \\( x = y^2 -4y -1 \\) has two y-intercepts.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the equation. The equation is given in terms of x being a function of y, which is a parabola that opens to the right or left. So, the y-intercepts are points where x=0, so solving for y when x=0 gives the y-values where the parabola crosses the y-axis. Since there are two real solutions, that's two points. So yes, two intercepts.\n\nAlternatively, if the equation was in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, then the y-intercept would be found by setting x=0, but in this case, since it's x in terms of y, the same logic applies but solving for y when x=0. So, the number of y-intercepts is the number of real solutions to that equation, which is two.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2. So, the number of y-intercepts is two.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe graph of the parabola has \\boxed{2} y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), we need to find the points where the graph crosses the \\( y \\)-axis.
