            "output": "First, I'll find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. To do this, I need to determine all the positive divisors of 284 that are less than 284 itself.\n\nI'll start by factoring 284. Since 284 divided by 4 equals 71, and 71 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 284 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71\u00b9.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (2\u00b2 + 1)(71\u00b9 + 1), I find that the sum of all divisors of 284 is 5 \u00d7 72 = 360. However, since I'm only interested in the proper divisors, I'll subtract 284 from 360, resulting in 76. So, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 76.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 76. Factoring 76 gives 2\u00b2 \u00d7 19\u00b9. Applying the sum of divisors formula again, (2\u00b2 + 1)(19\u00b9 + 1) equals 5 \u00d7 20 = 100. Subtracting 76 from 100 gives 24. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 76 is 24.\n\nFinally, I'll add the two sums together: 76 + 24 = 100. The final answer is 100.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Use this sum as the new number to find its proper divisors' sum.**\n3. **Finally, add the two sums together.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284**\n\n**1.1.
