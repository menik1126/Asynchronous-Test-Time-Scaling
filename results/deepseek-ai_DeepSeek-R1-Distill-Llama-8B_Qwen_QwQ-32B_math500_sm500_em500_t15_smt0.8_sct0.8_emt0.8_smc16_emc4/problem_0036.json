            "output": "First, I need to find the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all the positive divisors of a number excluding the number itself.\n\nI'll start by factoring 284 into its prime factors. 284 divided by 2 is 142, and 142 divided by 2 is 71, which is a prime number. So, 284 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71.\n\nUsing the prime factorization, I can find all the proper divisors of 284. They are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nNext, I'll sum these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. I'll factorize 220 into its prime factors. 220 divided by 2 is 110, and 110 divided by 2 is 55. 55 divided by 5 is 11, which is a prime number. So, 220 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 11.\n\nUsing the prime factorization, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, and 55.\n\nSumming these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 = 214.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 214.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Sum them to get the first result.**\n3. **Find the proper divisors of that sum.**\n4. **Sum them to get the final answer.**\n\n**Step 1: Proper Divisors of 284**\n\nFirst, we find all proper divisors of 284.\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 284**:\n  \\[\n  284 = 2^2 \\times 71\n  \\]\n  \n- **Proper Divisors**:\n  To find all proper divisors, we can list all divisors except 284 itself.\n  \n  - Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142"
