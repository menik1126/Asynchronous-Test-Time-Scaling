So, the question is about a quadratic polynomial P(x) that's bounded between two other quadratics: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for all real numbers x. Also, we know that P(11) = 181, and we need to find P(16). \n\nFirst, I recall that quadratic polynomials have the general form P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real coefficients. Since P(x) is sandwiched between two known quadratics, maybe I can express P(x) in terms of the difference between these two bounds. That is, maybe P(x) is right in the middle or somewhere between them.\n\nLet me write down the two given inequalities:\n\n1. x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3\n\nHmm, I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound to find the range between them. So, subtracting (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) from (2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3) gives:\n\n2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1\n\nWhich simplifies to (x - 1)\u00b2. So, the difference between the upper and lower bound is (x - 1)\u00b2, which is always non-negative because it's a square.\n\nSince P(x) is between these two quadratics, maybe P(x) can be expressed as the lower bound plus some multiple of (x - 1)\u00b2. Let me think about that. So, let's denote:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 + k(x - 1)\u00b2\n\nWhere k is some constant between 0 and 1 because the difference between P(x) and the lower bound can't exceed (x - 1)\u00b2, which has a maximum of 0 at x=1 and grows as x moves away from 1. Wait, no, actually, since (x - 1)\u00b2 is the difference, and P(x) is between the two bounds, maybe k can be any real number, but considering the inequalities, perhaps k is constrained.\n\nAlternatively, since the difference"

But since the upper bound is exactly the lower bound plus (x - 1)^2, then the multiple must be between 0 and 1. Wait, but maybe that's not necessarily the case. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(x) can be written as a linear combination of the two given quadratics. Let me see. Let me denote the lower bound as L(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and the upper bound as U(x) = 2x\u00b2 -4x +3. Then, maybe P(x) can be expressed as P(x) = L(x) + t*(U(x) - L(x)), where t is between 0 and 1. Since U(x) - L(x) = (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - (x\u00b2 -2x +2) = x\u00b2 -2x +1 = (x-1)^2. So, P(x) = L(x) + t*(x-1)^2. Since t must be between 0 and 1 to stay within the bounds, that might be a good way to model it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even more generally, since P(x) is a quadratic, and the difference between U(x) and L(x) is also a quadratic, perhaps P(x) can be written as a combination of L(x) and U(x). Let me see. Let me suppose that P(x) = a*L(x) + b*U(x), but then we have to ensure that a + b = 1 so that it's a convex combination? Hmm, maybe that's another approach. Let me try both ideas.\n\nFirst, let's try the first idea where P(x) = L(x) + t*(x-1)^2, with t between 0 and 1. Then, since P(11) = 181, we can plug in x=11 and solve for t. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, compute L(11):\n\nL(11) = (11)^2 - 2*(11) + 2 = 121 - 22 + 2 = 101.\n\nThen, (x -1)^2 at x="

Thus, P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 + 0.8*(x - 1)^2.\n\nNow, let me expand 0.8*(x -1)^2: 0.8*(x\u00b2 -2x +1) = 0.8x\u00b2 - 1.6x + 0.8.\n\nSo, adding to L(x): x\u00b2 -2x +2 +0.8x\u00b2 -1.6x +0.8.\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\nx\u00b2 + 0.8x\u00b2 = 1.8x\u00b2\n\n-2x -1.6x = -3.6x\n\n2 + 0.8 = 2.8\n\nThus, P(x) = 1.8x\u00b2 -3.6x + 2.8.\n\nAlternatively, I can write this as (9x\u00b2)/5 - (18x)/5 + 14/5, but maybe 1.8, 3.6, and 2.8 are easier to compute.\n\nWait, let me check my algebra again, because sometimes I might make a mistake in adding terms.\n\nSo, L(x) is x\u00b2 -2x +2.\n\nThen, 0.8*(x -1)^2 = 0.8x\u00b2 - 1.6x + 0.8.\n\nAdding these together:\n\nx\u00b2 + 0.8x\u00b2 = 1.8x\u00b2\n\n-2x - 1.6x = -3.6x\n\n2 + 0.8 = 2.8\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nSo, P(x) = 1.8x\u00b2 -3.6x +2.8.\n\nAlternatively, 1.8 is 9/5, 3.6 is 18/5, and 2.8 is 14/5. So, perhaps it's better to write it as (9/5)x\u00b2 -"

Plugging x=11, that gave t=0.8, which seems fine.\n\nBut another approach: maybe I can write P(x) as a combination of L(x) and U(x). Let me try that as a check.\n\nSuppose P(x) = a*L(x) + (1 - a)*U(x), where a is some constant between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily capture the entire range unless it's a convex combination. Alternatively, maybe P(x) can be written as aL(x) + bU(x), where a and b are scalars. But since U(x) - L(x) = (x-1)^2, which is a perfect square, and the difference between U and L is symmetric around x=1, maybe aL + bU would capture P(x) as a linear combination with a + b =1.\n\nWait, let's try that.

But also, we have the condition that P(x) must lie between L(x) and U(x) for all x. Wait, but if we set P(x) as a combination of L and U, then depending on a, it can be anywhere between them. However, the problem states that P(x) is between L(x) and U(x) for all x, so this approach might work. Let me see if this can also lead to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach is sufficient, but let me see if this second approach can also work.\n\nWe can use the given condition P(11)=181 to solve for a.

So, that's a different approach, but gives a different value for a. Wait, wait, if a = 0.2, then P(x) = 0.2L(x) + 0.8U(x).\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I had expressed P(x) as L(x) + t*(x-1)^2, where t was 0.8, so that would correspond to P(x) = L(x) + 0.8*(U(x) - L(x)) = 0.2L(x) + 0.8U(x), which matches this approach because 0.2 + 0.8 =1, so it's a convex combination. So, both approaches are equivalent.\n\nSo, with a=0.2, let me write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = (2 - 0.2)x\u00b2 + (2*0.2 -4)x + (3 -0.2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1.8)x\u00b2 + (-3.6)x + 2.8\n\nWhich is the same as before.

So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 406. But let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, just to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, since P(x) is a quadratic, and it's bounded between two quadratics, perhaps the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is a multiple of (x-1)^2, as we saw earlier. Since the difference between the upper and lower bound is exactly (x-1)^2, then P(x) must be equal to the lower bound plus some multiple of (x-1)^2. Since the upper bound is the lower bound plus (x-1)^2, the multiple must be between 0 and 1. But in our case, when we plugged in x=11, we found that the multiple was 0.8, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that the quadratic P(x) must touch both bounds at some points, but since the inequalities are for all real numbers, perhaps the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is a non-negative multiple of (x-1)^2, and similarly the difference between the upper bound and P(x) is also non-negative. Wait, but actually, the difference between the upper and lower is exactly (x-1)^2, so if P(x) is between them, then P(x) - L(x) = k*(x-1)^2, where 0 \u2264 k \u22641. So, that's exactly the first approach. So, that's the right way.\n\nTherefore, since we found k=0.8, then P(x) is as above, so P(16)=406.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another condition that I might have missed. The problem states that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients, which we have. Also, the inequalities must hold for all real numbers x. Let me confirm that with our P(x), the inequalities hold.\n\nTake P(x) = 1.8x"
