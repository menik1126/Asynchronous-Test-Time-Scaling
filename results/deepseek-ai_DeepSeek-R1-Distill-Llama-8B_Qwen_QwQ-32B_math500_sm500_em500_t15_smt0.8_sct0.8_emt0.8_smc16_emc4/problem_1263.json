The goal is to convert the decimal number 999 into its base six equivalent.\n\nNext, I should determine how many times 999 can be divided by 6. This will help me figure out the digits for each place in base six.\n\nStarting with the first division, 999 divided by 6 is 166 with a remainder of 3. This means the least significant digit in base six will be 3.\n\nTaking the quotient 166, I divide it by 6 again. This gives 27 with a remainder of 4. So, the next digit in base six is 4.\n\nContinuing with the quotient 27, dividing by 6 results in 4 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, the next digit is 3.\n\nFinally, taking the quotient 4 and dividing by 6 yields 0 with a remainder of 4. This means the most significant digit in base six is 4.\n\nPutting all the remainders together in reverse order, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 4434.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\), we'll perform the conversion process step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Conversion\nWe need to convert a decimal number to base six. This involves dividing the decimal number by 6 and recording the remainders.\n\n### Step 2: Divide by 6 and Record Remainders\n1. **First Division:**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 3\n   - **Quotient:** 166\n\n2. **Second Division:**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 4\n   - **Quotient:** 27\n\n3. **Third Division:**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 3\n   - **Quotient:** 4\n\n4. **Fourth Division:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n  "
