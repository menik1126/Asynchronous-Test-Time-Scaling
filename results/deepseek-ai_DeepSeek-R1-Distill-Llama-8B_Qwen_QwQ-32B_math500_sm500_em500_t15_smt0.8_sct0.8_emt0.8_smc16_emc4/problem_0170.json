            "output": "I need to solve the equation \u221a[3]{x\u00b2 - 4x + 4} = 16. To eliminate the cube root, I'll cube both sides of the equation. This gives me x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 16\u00b3.\n\nNext, I'll calculate 16\u00b3, which is 4096. So now the equation is x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nI can simplify this by subtracting 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero: x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. This simplifies to x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation, I'll use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a = 1, b = -4, and c = -4092. Plugging these into the formula, I get x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\nCalculating the discriminant, b\u00b2 - 4ac, which is (-4)\u00b2 - 4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384. The square root of 16384 is 128.\n\nNow, I'll substitute back into the formula: x = [4 \u00b1 128] / 2. This gives me two possible solutions: x = (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66, and x = (4 - 128)/2 = -124/2 = -62.\n\nSince the problem asks for the positive value of x, the solution is x = 66.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Eliminate the cube root:**\n   Cube both sides of the equation to remove the cube root.\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the equation:**\n   Subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero.\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4x + 4"
