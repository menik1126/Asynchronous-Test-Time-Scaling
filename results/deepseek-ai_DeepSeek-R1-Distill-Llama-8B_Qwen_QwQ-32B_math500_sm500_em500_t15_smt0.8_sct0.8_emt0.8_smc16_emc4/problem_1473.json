            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the cube root of the square root of the square root of 1/729. That sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write it out in symbols to make it clearer: √(∛(√(1/729))). Hmm, that's a lot of roots. I remember that roots can be expressed as exponents, which might make it easier to manipulate.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is √(1/729). A square root is the same as raising to the power of 1/2. So, √(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2). Let me compute that.\n\nBut wait, 729 is a number I recognize. I think 729 is 9 to the power of 3 because 9*9=81, and 81*9=729. Let me confirm: 9^3 is 729, yes. So, √(1/729) is √(1/9^3). Maybe I can rewrite 1/9^3 as (1/9)^(3/2). Hmm, I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute √(1/729) directly. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729 is 27 because 27^2 is 729. So, √(1/729) is 1/27. That's simpler.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have the cube root of that result. So, ∛(1/27). A cube root is the same as raising to the power of 1/3. So, (1/27)^(1/3). What's the cube root of 27? It's 3, because 3^3=27. So, the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3.\n\nAlright, now we have the outermost square root: √(1/3). Again, the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 3 is √3. So, that simplifies to 1/√3.\n\nBut the problem asks for a rational denominator. I remember that having a radical in the denominator isn't typically preferred, so I need to rationalize the denominator. How do I do that"

            "output": "? I think I multiply numerator and denominator by √3 to eliminate the square root from the denominator.\n\nSo, 1/√3 multiplied by √3/√3 equals (√3)/(√3*√3). The denominator becomes √9 which is 3. So, the result is √3/3.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me go through it again.\n\nStart with √(∛(√(1/729))). \n\n1. Compute √(1/729): That's 1/27.\n\n2. Then take the cube root of 1/27: That's 1/3.\n\n3. Finally, take the square root of 1/3: Which is 1/√3.\n\n4. Rationalizing the denominator: Multiply numerator and denominator by √3 to get √3/3.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final simplified expression with a rational denominator is √3 over 3.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but maybe I should verify each step numerically. Let's see:\n\n1/729 is approximately 0.001371742. The square root of that is approximately 0.037037, which is 1/27. Then, the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3, which is about 0.333333. The square root of 1/3 is approximately 0.57735, which is √3/3 because √3 is about 1.732, and dividing by 3 gives roughly 0.57735. So, the numerical values match up with my simplified expression. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the simplified form is indeed √3 divided by 3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\\), we start by evaluating the innermost radical and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost square root:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}\n   \\]\n2. Take the cube root of the result:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n3. Compute the outermost square root:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\"
