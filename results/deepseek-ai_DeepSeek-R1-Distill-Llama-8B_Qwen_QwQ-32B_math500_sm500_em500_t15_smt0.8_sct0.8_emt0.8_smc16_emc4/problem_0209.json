Plugging in the largest radius, 7, I find that the area of the largest circle is \\( 49\\pi \\).\n\nThen, I'll calculate the area of the middle circle with a radius of 6, which gives me \\( 36\\pi \\).\n\nAfter that, I'll compute the area of the smallest circle using the radius of 4, resulting in \\( 16\\pi \\).\n\nNow, I'll identify the regions:\n- Region Z is the area inside the smallest circle, so its area is \\( 16\\pi \\).\n- Region Y is the area between the smallest and middle circles, which is \\( 20\\pi \\).\n- Region X is the area between the middle and largest circles, which is \\( 13\\pi \\).\n\nComparing the areas, Region X has the largest area at \\( 13\\pi \\), and Region Z has the smallest area at \\( 16\\pi \\).\n\nFinally, to find the difference between the largest and smallest areas, I'll subtract the smallest area from the largest: \\( 13\\pi - 16\\pi = -3\\pi \\).
