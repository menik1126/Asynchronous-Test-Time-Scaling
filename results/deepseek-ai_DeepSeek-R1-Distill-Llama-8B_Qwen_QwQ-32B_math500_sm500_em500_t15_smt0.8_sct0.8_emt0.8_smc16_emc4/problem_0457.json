Hmm, let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given. The constraint is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), and I need to minimize \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Since all variables are positive, I know I can apply some inequality techniques, maybe AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz. I should try to express everything in terms that can be related through these inequalities.\n\nLooking at the expression to minimize, \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), it reminds me of expanding products which often leads to quadratic or higher terms. Let me try expanding it:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's an interesting form. I can see \\(y(x + y + z)\\) which appears in the constraint as well. Let me note that \\(x + y + z\\) is a part of the constraint. Maybe I can denote \\(S = x + y + z\\), so the constraint becomes:\n\n\\[\nxyzS = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, our expression becomes \\(yS + xz\\). So, the problem reduces to minimizing \\(yS + xz\\).\n\nHmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful. Maybe I should consider using substitution or homogenization. Since the constraint has \\(xyzS = 1\\), perhaps I can express one variable in terms of the others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can introduce substitution variables to simplify the problem. Let me think about symmetry here. The expression \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\), so perhaps assuming \\(x = z\\) could lead to a minimum. That often works in symmetric problems, although I need to verify if that's indeed the case here.\n\nLet me assume \\(x = z\\). Then, the constraint becomes:\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot y \\cdot x \\cdot (x + y + x) = 1 \\implies x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\n\\]\n\nSo"

Now, the expression to minimize becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)^2\n\\]\n\nWait, because if \\(x = z\\), then \\(y + z = y + x\\), so indeed, the expression becomes \\((x + y)^2\\). So, the problem reduces to minimizing \\((x + y)^2\\) under the constraint \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\).\n\nHmm, that seems a bit simpler. Maybe this is a path forward. Let me set \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = y\\), so the problem becomes minimizing \\((a + b)^2\\) under \\(a^2 b (2a + b) = 1\\). Then, maybe set \\(t = \\frac{b}{a}\\), so that \\(b = ta\\). Then substitute into the constraint:\n\n\\(a^2 (ta) (2a + ta) = a^2 \\cdot ta \\cdot a(2 + t) = a^4 t (2 + t) = 1\\)\n\nSo, solving for \\(a\\):\n\n\\(a^4 = \\frac{1}{t(2 + t)}\\) \\) => \\(a = \\left( \\frac{1}{t(2 + t)} \\right)^{1/4}\\)\n\nThen, the expression to minimize becomes:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = (a + ta)^2 = a^2(1 + t)^2\\)\n\nSubstituting \\(a^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{t(2 + t)} \\right)^{1/2}\\):\n\n= \\(\\left( \\frac{1}{t(2 + t)} \\right)^{1/2} \\times (1 + t)^2 \\)\n\nSo, the expression to minimize is \\( \\frac{(1 + t)^2}{\\sqrt{t(2 + t)}} \\).\n\nTherefore, we can consider this as a function of \\(t > 0\\), and find its minimum.\n\nHmm, now this reduces to a single-variable calculus problem. Let me denote \\(f(t) = \\frac{(1 + t)^2}{t(2 + t)^{1/2}}\\). Wait, actually, let me be precise. The expression is:\n\n\\( f(t) ="

Hmm, but I obtained an explicit value, so maybe this is indeed the minimal. Alternatively, perhaps I need to confirm whether this is the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if this is actually attainable. So, if t = sqrt2 -1, that is, b = ta = (sqrt2 -1)a.\n\nWait, no, in substitution above, b =ta, with a = x, but in the substitution, a = x and b = y. So, when t = sqrt2 -1, then y = t x.

But is this the global minimum?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to confirm that assuming x=z is valid here. Since the problem is symmetric in x and z, so the minimal should occur when x=z. Otherwise, if the minimal occurs when x\u2260z, then swapping x and z would give another minimal, but since the problem is symmetric, the minimal should be the same.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, so the expression becomes y S + x z. The constraint is x y z S =1.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can use AM-GM on terms y S and x z. Let me see:\n\nWe have two terms: y S and x z. Let me see if I can apply AM-GM to them. The product of these terms is y S * x z = x y z S * S = (x y z S) * S = 1 * S = S.

Then, the expression to minimize is a + b, and the constraint is (x y z S) = (x z) * y S = b * a =1. So, we have a * b =1, and need to minimize a + b.

Suppose I take different values where a = y S =1 and x z =1, but not necessarily x = z.\n\nSuppose, for instance, let me set x =2, z = 0.5 (so x z =1).
