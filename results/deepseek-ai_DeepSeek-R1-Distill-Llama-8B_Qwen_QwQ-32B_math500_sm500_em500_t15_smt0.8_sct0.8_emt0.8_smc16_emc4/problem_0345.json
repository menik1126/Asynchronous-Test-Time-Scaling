For each scenario, I'll calculate the result to see which one yields the smallest number.\n\nAfter evaluating several configurations, I'll identify the arrangement that gives the minimum possible value.\n</think>\n\nTo find the minimum possible value of the expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\) by adding parentheses in various locations without changing the order of the terms, let's analyze all possible placements of parentheses.\n\n1. **Original Expression (No Parentheses):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13\n   \\]\n\n2. **Grouping Terms to Minimize the Result:**\n   We need to strategically place parentheses to create sub-expressions that reduce the overall value. One effective way is to group terms in a way that results in a larger negative number, which when subtracted will lower the total.\n\n3. **Example Grouping:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 6 - 9 + 6 = 3\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Another Effective Grouping:**\n   \\[\n   1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + (5 + 6)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 1 + (1) + 11 = 13\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Optimal Grouping to Minimize:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 - 1 + 5 + 6 = 13\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Final Optimal Grouping:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + (5 + 6))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 6 - (4 + 11) = 6 - 15 = -9\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{-9}\n\\]"

    "question": "The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)\n\nEnter your answer as a single value."
