            "output": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this polynomial problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nWe have a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so P(x) looks like x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, right? Our goal is to find P(5).\n\nIt says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, when it's divided by a quadratic polynomial, the remainder should be of lower degree, so R(x) is a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) must be something like mx + n.\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), which would be 2mx + 2n.\n\nSo, maybe I can express P(x) in terms of these divisors.\n\nLet me recall the polynomial division remainder theorem. If we divide P(x) by a quadratic polynomial, say D(x), then P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x), where Q(x) is the quotient and R(x) is the remainder, which has a lower degree than D(x).\n\nSo, applying this to the first division, when we divide P(x) by (x - 1)(x - 4), we have:\n\nP(x) = Q1(x)(x - 1)(x - 4) + R(x)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), we have:\n\nP(x) = Q2(x)(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2R(x)\n\nSince both R(x) and 2R(x) are linear, let me write R(x) = rx + s. Then 2R(x) = 2rx + 2s.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can set up two equations based on these divisions.\n\nBut wait, since both equations are for P(x), maybe I can subtract them or equate them in some way"

            "output": "?\n\nAlternatively, since the remainders are related, perhaps I can use the fact that the remainders when divided by different quadratics are connected through R(x).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Remainder Factor Theorem here. Since the remainder when dividing by (x - a)(x - b) is a linear polynomial, the remainder can be found by evaluating P(a) and P(b). Because when you plug in x = a or x = b into the division equation, the first term becomes zero, so P(a) = R(a) and P(b) = R(b). Similarly for the other divisor.\n\nAh, that's a good point. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, since P(x) divided by (x - 1)(x - 4) gives remainder R(x), then:\n\nP(1) = R(1)\n\nP(4) = R(4)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so:\n\nP(2) = 2R(2)\n\nP(3) = 2R(3)\n\nSo, that gives us four equations:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1)\n\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n\n3. P(2) = 2R(2)\n\n4. P(3) = 2R(3)\n\nSince R(x) is linear, let me denote R(x) = mx + n. Then:\n\nR(1) = m(1) + n = m + n\n\nR(4) = 4m + n\n\nSimilarly, 2R(2) = 2*(2m + n) = 4m + 2n\n\n2R(3) = 2*(3m + n) = 6m + 2n\n\nTherefore, equations become:\n\n1. P(1) = m + n\n\n2. P(4) = 4m + n\n\n3. P(2) = 4m + 2n\n\n4. P(3) = 6m + 2n\n\nAlso, since P(x) is a monic cubic polynomial, let me write it as:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\nWe also know that P(0) = c = 5, so c = 5. That's helpful.\n\nSo"
