            "output": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. It's about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram to visualize it. So, the school has 360 students in total. \n\nFirst, I read that 15 students take calculus, physics, and chemistry, and 15 don't take any of them. So, that leaves 360 - 15 - 15 = 330 students who take at least one of those three subjects. Hmm, wait, actually, 15 take all three, and 15 take none, so the number taking at least one is 360 - 15 = 345. Hmm, maybe I should correct that.\n\nNext, it says 180 take calculus. So, the total number of students in calculus is 180. Then, twice as many students take chemistry as take physics. That means if I let the number of students taking physics be P, then chemistry would be 2P.\n\nIt also says 75 take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry. Wait, so both those pairs have 75 each. Additionally, only 30 take both physics and calculus. So, 30 students are in both physics and calculus.\n\nLet me jot down the information I have:\n\n- Total students: 360\n- Students taking none: 15\n- Students taking all three (calculus, physics, chemistry): 15\n- Students taking calculus: 180\n- Students taking chemistry: 2P\n- Students taking physics: P\n- Both calculus and chemistry: 75\n- Both physics and chemistry: 75\n- Both physics and calculus: 30\n\nI think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for three sets is:\n\nTotal = C + P + Ch - (C\u2229P) - (C\u2229Ch) - (P\u2229Ch) + (C\u2229P\u2229Ch)\n\nWhere C is calculus, P is physics, Ch is chemistry.\n\nBut wait, the total here isn't the 345, because 15 don't take any. So, actually, the total number of students taking at least one of the subjects is 360 - 15 = 345.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\n\nWait, let me make sure. C is 180, P is P"

The intersection of all three is 15.\n\nSo substituting into the formula:\n\nTotal = C + P + Ch - (C\u2229P) - (C\u2229Ch) - (P\u2229Ch) + (C\u2229P\u2229Ch)\n\nSo,\n\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side step by step.\n\nFirst, 180 + P + 2P = 180 + 3P\n\nThen subtract the pairwise intersections: -30 -75 -75 = -180\n\nThen add back the triple intersection: +15\n\nSo altogether:\n\n345 = (180 + 3P) - 180 + 15\n\nSimplify that:\n\n180 - 180 cancels out, so 345 = 3P + 15\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides: 330 = 3P\n\nTherefore, P = 110.\n\nWait, so the number of students taking physics is 110? Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nLet me verify with the numbers. Let me see if all the numbers add up correctly.\n\nFirst, if P = 110, then chemistry is 220.\n\nNow, let's compute each part of the Venn diagram.\n\nWe know that the intersection of all three is 15.\n\nNow, the number taking both calculus and physics is 30, but that includes those who also take chemistry. So, the number taking only calculus and physics would be 30 - 15 = 15.\n\nSimilarly, the number taking both calculus and chemistry is 75, so those taking only calculus and chemistry would be 75 - 15 = 60.\n\nSame with physics and chemistry: 75 total, so only physics and chemistry is 75 -15 = 60.\n\nNow, let's compute the number taking only calculus. The total calculus is 180. Subtract those in intersections:\n\nOnly calculus = 180 - (only CP) - (only C"

And adding the 15 who don't take any makes 360. That checks out.\n\nSo, the number of students taking physics is 110.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of students taking physics using the principle of inclusion-exclusion and given conditions. \n\n1. **Total students:** 360\n   - 15 take none of the subjects, so 345 take at least one.\n2. **Given:**\n   - 180 take calculus (C).\n   - Let P = number taking physics, and 2P = number taking chemistry (Ch).\n   - 15 take all three (C, P, Ch).\n   - 30 take both C and P.\n   - 75 take both C and Ch.\n   - 75 take both P and Ch.\n3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**\n   345 = C + P + Ch - (C\u2229P) - (C\u2229Ch) - (P\u2229Ch) + (C\u2229P\u2229Ch)\n   345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\n   Simplifying:\n   345 = 180 + 3P - 180 + 15\n   345 = 3P + 15\n"
