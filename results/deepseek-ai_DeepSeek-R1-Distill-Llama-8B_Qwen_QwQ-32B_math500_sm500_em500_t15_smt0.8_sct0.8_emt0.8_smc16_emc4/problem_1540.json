Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, optimization problems like this usually involve using calculus, specifically derivatives, to find the maximum or minimum values. But since there are multiple variables, I remember that Lagrange multipliers might be the way to go. Let me recall how that works.\n\nLagrange multipliers are used to find the extrema of a function subject to equality constraints. In this case, my function to maximize is \\( f(a, b, c, d) = ab^2c^3d^4 \\) and the constraint is \\( g(a, b, c, d) = a + b + c + d - 10 = 0 \\). So, I need to set up the Lagrangian function:\n\n\\( \\mathcal{L}(a, b, c, d, \\lambda) = ab^2c^3d^4 - \\lambda(a + b + c + d - 10) \\)\n\nWait, no, actually, it's \\( \\mathcal{L} = f - \\lambda g \\), but since \\( g \\) has to be zero at the maximum, I think it's correct. Now, I need to take the partial derivatives of \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) with respect to each variable and set them equal to zero.\n\nLet me compute each partial derivative:\n\n1. Partial derivative with respect to \\( a \\):\n\\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial a} = b^2c^3d^4 - \\lambda = 0 \\)\nSo, \\( b^2c^3d^4 = \\lambda \\) ... (1)\n\n2. Partial derivative with respect to \\( b \\):\n\\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial b} = 2ab c^3d^4 - \\lambda = 0 \\)\nSo, \\( 2ab c^3d^4 = \\lambda \\) ... (2)\n\n3. Partial derivative with respect to \\( c \\):\n\\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial c} = 3ab^2c^2"

Partial derivative with respect to \\( \\lambda \\):\n\\( \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = -(a + b + c + d - 10) = 0 \\)\nWhich gives the constraint:\n\\( a + b + c + d = 10 \\) ... (5)\n\nNow, I have five equations: (1) through (5). I need to solve these equations to find the values of \\( a, b, c, d \\).\n\nLooking at equations (1) through (4), they all equal to \\( \\lambda \\). So, I can set them equal to each other to find relationships between the variables.\n\nFirst, let's set equation (1) equal to equation (2):\n\n\\( b^2c^3d^4 = 2ab c^3d^4 \\)\n\nHmm, let's simplify this. We can divide both sides by \\( c^3d^4 \\) assuming \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are positive, which they are.\n\nSo, \\( b^2 = 2ab \\)\n\nDivide both sides by \\( b \\) (since \\( b \\) is positive and can't be zero):\n\n\\( b = 2a \\) ... (6)\n\nOkay, so \\( b \\) is twice \\( a \\).\n\nNow, let's set equation (2) equal to equation (3):\n\n\\( 2ab c^3d^4 = 3ab^2c^2d^4 \\)\n\nAgain, let's simplify. First, notice that \\( ab \\) and \\( d^4 \\) are common on both sides and positive, so we can divide both sides by \\( ab d^4 \\):\n\n\\( 2c^3 = 3b c^2 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by \\( c^2 \\) (since \\( c \\) is positive):\n\n\\( 2c ="

Let's see, both sides have \\( ab^2 \\), which is positive, so we can divide both sides by \\( ab^2 \\):\n\n\\( 3c^2d^4 = 4c^3d^3 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by \\( c^2d^3 \\):\n\n\\( 3d = 4c \\)\n\nSo, \\( d = \\frac{4c}{3} \\) ...

Since the problem states that all variables are positive, and the function \\( f(a, b, c, d) = ab^2c^3d^4 \\) is positive, and the constraint is a compact set (since all variables are positive and their sum is 10, which is a closed bounded set in the positive orthant), by the Extreme Value Theorem, the function attains its maximum on this set. Therefore, the critical point we found is indeed the maximum.\n\nWait, hold on, just to be thorough, should I check if this is a maximum? In multivariable calculus, we can check the second-order conditions or see if the function is convex or concave. However, since all the variables are positive and the function is a product of positive terms, it's a bit tricky. But in optimization with positive variables and a sum constraint, the maximum occurs when all variables are proportional to their exponents in the function. Hmm, let me think.\n\nActually, I recall that for maximizing \\( f(a, b, c, d) = ab^2c^3d^4 \\) under the constraint \\( a + b + c + d = 10 \\), the maximum occurs when each variable is proportional to the exponent in the function. That is, \\( a : b : c : d = 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 \\). This is similar to the method of weighted AM-GM inequality.\n\nUsing the AM-GM inequality, the maximum of the product under a sum constraint can be found by setting each variable proportional to its weight in the function.\n\nSo, the weights are the exponents: 1 for \\( a \\), 2 for \\( b \\), 3 for \\( c \\), 4 for \\( d \\). Total weight is \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 \\). So, each variable's proportion is equal to its weight divided by the total weight. So, \\( a"
