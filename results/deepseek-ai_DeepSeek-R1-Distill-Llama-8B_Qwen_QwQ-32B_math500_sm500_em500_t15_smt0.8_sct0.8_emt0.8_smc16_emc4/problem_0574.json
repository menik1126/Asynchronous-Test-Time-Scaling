There are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, making a total of 11 members.\n\nSince the members are sitting around a circular table, the arrangement is considered up to rotation. This means that rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new seating.\n\nThe problem specifies that all members of each party must sit next to each other. This implies that the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent will form three distinct blocks around the table.\n\nTo simplify the problem, I can fix the position of the Independent. This fixes the rotational symmetry and reduces the number of variables.\n\nNow, the remaining 10 members (5 Democrats and 5 Republicans) need to be arranged. However, since each party must sit together, the Democrats can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways and the Republicans in another 5! ways.\n\nWith the Independent's position fixed and the parties arranged within their blocks, the total number of distinct seatings is 5! multiplied by 5!.\n\nCalculating the factorial values, 5! is 120, so the total number of ways is 120 multiplied by 120, which equals 14,400.\n\nTherefore, there are 14,400 different ways for the Senate committee to sit around the circular table under the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe have a Senate committee with:\n- 5 Democrats\n- 5 Republicans\n- 1 Independent\n\nThey need to be seated around a circular table such that all members of each party sit together. Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.\n\n**Step 2: Fix a Position to Eliminate Rotational Symmetry**\n\nSince the arrangement is circular, rotating the entire group doesn't create a new seating. To eliminate rotational symmetry, we can fix the position of one person. Let's fix the Independent.\n\n**Step 3: Arrange the Parties**\n\nNow, the remaining 10 seats are to be occupied by the 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans, with each party sitting together. This means we have three blocks to arrange around the table:\n1. Democratic Block\n2. Republican Block\n3. Independent (fixed position)\n\nSince the Independent's position is fixed, we only need to arrange the two blocks relative to each other.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Arrangements"

Hold on. There's a mistake here. Let me re-examine.\n\n**Step 8: Correct the Mistake**\n\nWait, when we fixed the Independent's position, the two party blocks (Democrats and Republicans) are now arranged around the table. Since the Independent is fixed, the two blocks can only be arranged in 1 way (since rotation is already accounted for by fixing the Independent). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nActually, fixing the Independent's position means that the two blocks (Democrats and Republicans) can be placed in the remaining positions. Since the table is circular and we fixed the Independent, the two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways (either Democrats first then Republicans, or Republicans first then Democrats). \n\nWait, but if we fix the Independent, the two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways. So the calculation is correct. But let me confirm.\n\nWait, the total number of blocks is 3: the Independent is a single block, and the two parties. Wait, no. Wait, the Independent is a single person, so they form a block of size 1. The Democrats form a block of 5, and the Republicans form a block of 5. So total blocks are 3: D, R, I.\n\nWait, but if we"

Because the Independent is a single person, but when we fix their position, we have to consider that the circular arrangement is now linear relative to the fixed position.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's consider that in circular arrangements, fixing one person's position linearizes the problem. So by fixing the Independent, we effectively have a linear arrangement of the remaining 10 seats, which are occupied by two blocks: D and R.\n\nSince it's a circular table with the Independent fixed, the two blocks D and R can be arranged in 2! ways (D first or R first). Then, within each block, the members can be arranged in \\(5!\\) ways for D and \\(5!\\) ways for R.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is indeed \\(2! \\times 5! \\times 5! = 28,800\\).\n\nWait, but in the first place, I thought the answer was 14,400, but now I'm calculating 28,800. Which is correct?\n\n**Step 9: Final Calculation**\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the first place. Let's clarify.\n\nWhen fixing the position of the Independent, the two blocks (D and R) can be arranged in 2! ways: D to the left of I and R to the right, or R to the left of I and D to the right.\n\nWithin each block, the 5 Democrats can be arranged among themselves in \\(5!\\) ways, and the 5 Republicans in \\(5!\\) ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of seating arrangements is:\n\n\\[\n2! \\times 5! \\times 5! = 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 = 28,800\n\\]\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nYes, because:\n- Fixing the Independent breaks"

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, another approach:\n\nIn circular arrangements where groups are to be kept together, the formula is \\((k-1)! \\times \\prod (n_i!)\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of groups and \\(n_i\\) is the size of each group.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for circular arrangements with groups:\n\nWhen arranging \\(k\\) groups around a circular table, the number of ways is \\((k-1)! \\times \\prod (n_i!)\\), where \\(n_i\\) is the size of each group.\n\nHere, the groups are the three parties: D (5), R (5), and I (1). So \\(k = 3\\) groups.\n\nTherefore, the number of arrangements would be:\n\n\\[\n(3-1)! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1! = 2! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1 = 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 = 28,800\n\\]\n\nThis matches the previous result. Therefore, the correct answer is 28,800.\n\nWait, but in my initial reasoning, I thought of fixing the Independent, leading to 2! * 5! *5!.\n\nBut the formula also gives the same result. So why did I initially think it was 14,400?\n\nAh, because I might have considered the Independent as part of the rotation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula accounts for the circular arrangement by dividing by the total number of seats? Wait, no, the formula for circular arrangements with groups is indeed (number of groups -1)! multiplied by the permutations within each group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 28,800.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all the members of each party all sit next to each other\". The Independent is a single member, so they form a group of 1. So the three groups are D, R, and I. So the formula applies here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 2! × 5! ×5! ×1! = 2"

So in this case, k=3, so 2! ×5! ×5! = 28,800.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 28,800.\n\n**Step 10: Conclusion**\n\nThe number of ways the Senate committee can be seated around the circular table with all members of each party sitting together is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{28800}\n\\]"
