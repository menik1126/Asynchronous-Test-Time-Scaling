This allows me to rewrite the right side of the equation. So, \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) becomes \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the power of a power rule, which states that \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\). This means \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\). Since the bases on both sides of the equation are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. Therefore, \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. This gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a Power of 2:**\n   - Recognize that \\( 256 = 2^8 \\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Equation:**\n   - Substitute \\( 256 \\) with \\( 2^8 \\) in the equation:\n     \\[\n     2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Power of a Power Rule:**\n   - Use the rule \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n} \\):\n     \\[\n     (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n     \\]\n   - Now, the equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     2^{2x} = 2^4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Set the Exponents Equal:**\n   - Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:\n     \\[\n     2x = "
