            "output": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I have two logarithmic equations here, and I need to find the value of x. Hmm, let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the equations are:\n1. log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2.\n2. log base y of 5x equals 2.\n\nAlright, starting with the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying the arguments. So, log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. \n\nLet me write that down: log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. The expression inside the log is (x - y)(x + y), which is a difference of squares, so that simplifies to x² - y². So now I have log₆(x² - y²) = 2.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, log base 6 of something equals 2 means that 6 squared is that something. So, 6² = x² - y². Calculating 6 squared, that's 36. So, x² - y² = 36. Got that equation down: x² - y² = 36. I'll note that as equation (1).\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log base y of 5x equals 2. That is, log_y(5x) = 2. I need to convert this logarithmic equation into its exponential form to make it easier to handle. Remember, log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.\n\nApplying that here, base y raised to the power of 2 equals 5x. So, y² = 5x. That's straightforward. I'll write that as equation (2): y² = 5x.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n1. x² - y² = 36\n2. y² = 5x\n\nHmm, since equation (2) gives me y² in terms of x, I can substitute that into equation (1). Let's do that. Replace y² in equation (1) with 5x.\n\nSo, equation"

            "output": " (1) becomes: x² - 5x = 36.\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in terms of x: x² - 5x - 36 = 0. Let's solve this quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic is x² - 5x - 36 = 0. I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a = 1, b = -5, c = -36.\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: b² - 4ac = (-5)² - 4*1*(-36) = 25 + 144 = 169. Oh, that's a perfect square, which is nice.\n\nSo, sqrt(169) is 13. Now, plugging back into the quadratic formula: x = [5 ± 13]/2. So, two possible solutions:\n\nx = (5 + 13)/2 = 18/2 = 9\n\nx = (5 - 13)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4\n\nWait, so x can be 9 or -4? But I have to make sure that the original logarithmic expressions are defined. Remember, logarithms are only defined for positive arguments.\n\nLooking back at the first equation: log₆(x - y) and log₆(x + y). So, both (x - y) and (x + y) must be positive. Also, in the second equation, log_y(5x) is defined only if 5x is positive and y is positive. Also, the base y of the logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1.\n\nSo, let's analyze both solutions.\n\nFirst, x = 9.\n\nFrom equation (2): y² = 5x = 5*9 = 45. So, y² = 45, which means y is sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But since y is the base of a logarithm, it must be positive. So, y = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5). Approximately, sqrt(45) is about 6.708.\n\nNow, we need to check if (x - y) and (x + y) are positive.\n\nx = 9, y ≈6.708.\n\nx - y ≈9 -6.708 ≈2.292,"

Good.\n\nNow, check x = -4.\n\nAgain, from equation (2): y² = 5x = 5*(-4) = -20.\n\nWait, y² = -20? That's not possible because the square of a real number can't be negative. So, y² = -20 implies no real solution for y. Therefore, x = -4 is invalid. So, we can discard this solution.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nLet me just recap:\n\nFrom the first equation, after combining the logs, I got x² - y² = 36.\n\nFrom the second equation, I got y² =5x. Substituting that into the first equation gave a quadratic in x: x² -5x -36=0, which has solutions x=9 and x=-4.\n\nChecked the validity of each solution:\n\n- For x=9: y²=45, so y is positive, and x - y and x + y are positive.\n- For x=-4: y²=-20, which is impossible, so discard.\n\nThus, the answer is x =9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we start with the given equations:\n1. \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\)\n2. \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\)\n\nFor the first equation, we use the property of logarithms that allows us to combine the logs:\n\\[\n\\log_6[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\n\\]\nConverting this to its exponential form, we get:\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\nThus, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = 36 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nFor the second equation, we convert the logarithmic form to its exponential form:\n\\[\ny^2 = 5x \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting equation (2) into equation ("
