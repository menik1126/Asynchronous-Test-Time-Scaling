            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). The answer should be expressed as \u221aa divided by b, where a and b are positive integers, and a isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find a + b. \n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. The smallest distance from the origin to a point on the graph is basically the shortest distance from (0,0) to any point (x, y) on the curve y = (x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2. I remember that the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is calculated using the distance formula: sqrt[(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2]. So, in this case, the distance D from the origin would be sqrt[(x - 0)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2] = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSince we're dealing with the point (x, y) on the given curve, y is dependent on x. So, I can substitute y with (x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2 in the distance formula. That would give me D = sqrt[x\u00b2 + ((x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2)\u00b2]. \n\nWait, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me square both sides to make it easier to work with, because minimizing D is the same as minimizing D squared. So, D squared is x\u00b2 + [(x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2]^2. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's square the y term: [(x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2]^2 = (x\u00b2 - 3)^2 / (2). So, now D squared is x\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 - 3)^2 / 2. Let's write that out:\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + [(x\u00b2 - 3)^2] / 2\n\nNow, to make this a single equation, perhaps I can combine the terms. Let me expand (x\u00b2 - 3)^2:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x\u00b2 + 9\n\nSo, substituting back, D"

To do that, I can write x\u00b2 as (2x\u00b2)/2 so that both terms have the same denominator:\n\nD\u00b2 = (2x\u00b2)/2 + (x^4 - 6x\u00b2 + 9)/2\n\nNow, combine the numerators:\n\nD\u00b2 = [2x\u00b2 + x^4 - 6x\u00b2 + 9] / 2\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n2x\u00b2 - 6x\u00b2 is -4x\u00b2, so:\n\nD\u00b2 = [x^4 - 4x\u00b2 + 9] / 2\n\nOkay, so now the problem reduces to finding the minimum value of D\u00b2, which is the same as minimizing the function f(x) = (x^4 - 4x\u00b2 + 9)/2. Since dividing by 2 doesn't affect where the minimum is, I can instead minimize f(x) without the denominator. Let me define f(x) = x^4 - 4x\u00b2 + 9.\n\nTo find the minimum, I should take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. That will give me the critical points, and then I can check if it's a minimum.\n\nFirst, let's compute the derivative f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [x^4 - 4x\u00b2 + 9] = 4x^3 - 8x\n\nSet this equal to zero for critical points:\n\n4x^3 - 8x = 0\n\nFactor out 4x:\n\n4x(x\u00b2 - 2) = 0\n\nSo, either 4x = 0 or x\u00b2 - 2 = 0.\n\nSolving, x = 0 or x\u00b2 = 2, so x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2).\n\nNow, I have three critical points: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), and x = -sqrt(2). I need to evaluate f(x) at each of these and determine which one gives the smallest value.\n\nLet's compute f(0):\n\nf(0) = 0 - 0 + 9 = 9\n\nf(sqrt(2)) = (sqrt("

So, f(-sqrt(2)) = 5 as well.\n\nSo, f(0) = 9, f(sqrt(2)) = 5, f(-sqrt(2)) = 5.\n\nTherefore, the minimum of f(x) is 5 at x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo, going back, D squared is 5/2, because D\u00b2 = f(x)/2. Hence, D\u00b2 = 5/2. So, D = sqrt(5/2). But the problem says the smallest distance can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, so I need to rationalize that or write it in a form where the denominator is rational.\n\nSo, sqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(10)/2, since sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5 * 2)/2 = sqrt(10)/2. Let me check: sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2, yes because sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nSo, sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2, so D = sqrt(10)/2. Therefore, expressed as sqrt(a)/b, we have a = 10 and b = 2.\n\nWait, but the problem says a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. So, 10 is 2*5, neither of which is a square, so it's square-free, so a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check my steps because sometimes these optimization problems can have minima or maxima, so I need to make sure I didn't"

So critical points at x=0 and x=\u00b1\u221a2. Then, plugging back into f(x):\n\nAt x=0, f(0)=9, which is correct.\n\nAt x=\u221a2, f(\u221a2)= (\u221a2)^4 -4*(\u221a2)^2 +9 = (4) -4*(2) +9 = 4 -8 +9 = 5. Correct.\n\nSo, the minimal value of f(x) is indeed 5, so D squared is 5/2, so D is sqrt(5/2). Then, rationalizing the denominator, sqrt(5/2) is equal to sqrt(10)/2. So, sqrt(10)/2 is the distance. Therefore, a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b is 12. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using geometry or another calculus method, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the distance squared from the origin to a point (x, y) is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. Since y = (x\u00b2 -3)/\u221a2, substituting gives x\u00b2 + [(x\u00b2 -3)/\u221a2]^2. Which is exactly what I did before, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using parametric equations or Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overcomplicating. Let me see with Lagrange multipliers just to check.\n\nWe want to minimize f(x,y) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 subject to the constraint g(x,y) = y - (x\u00b2 -3)/\u221a2 = 0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - \u03bb(y - (x\u00b2 -3)/\u221a2).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 2x - \u03bb*(-2x)/\u221a2 = 0\n\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 2y - \u03bb = 0\n\n\u2202L/\u2202\u03bb = -(y - (x\u00b2 -3)/\u221a2) = 0\n\nSo, from the first equation:\n\n2x - (\u03bb*(-2x))/\u221a2 = 0"
