            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of one cylindrical beaker. To do this, I'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nGiven that each beaker has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, I'll plug these values into the formula:\n\nV = π * (3 cm)² * 8 cm = π * 9 cm² * 8 cm = 72π cm³.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius of the sphere. The tank has a radius of 6 cm, so:\n\nV = (4/3)π * (6 cm)³ = (4/3)π * 216 cm³ = 288π cm³.\n\nFinally, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, I'll divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker:\n\nNumber of beakers = 288π cm³ / 72π cm³ = 4.\n\nTherefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers of water to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the cylinder.\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nGiven:\n- Radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm\n- Height \\( h = 8 \\) cm\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\ \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven:\n- Radius \\( R = 6 \\) cm\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3}"
