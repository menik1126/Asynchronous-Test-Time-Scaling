For example, 1 - 2, 3 - 4, 5 - 6, and so on up to 99 - 100.\n\nEach pair simplifies to -1: 1 - 2 = -1, 3 - 4 = -1, etc.\n\nThere are a total of 50 such pairs since there are 100 numbers in total.\n\nFinally, I multiply the number of pairs by -1: 50 * (-1) = -50.\n\nThus, the sum of the series is -50.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the sum \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Observe the Pattern\nThe series alternates between adding and subtracting consecutive integers:\n\\[\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\n\\]\nThere are 100 terms in total.\n\n### Step 2: Pair the Terms\nWe can pair the terms to simplify the computation:\n\\[\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n\\]\nEach pair is of the form \\( (2k-1) - 2k \\), where \\( k \\) ranges from 1 to 50.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify Each Pair\nEach pair simplifies to:\n\\[\n(2k-1) - 2k = -1\n\\]\nThere are 50 such pairs.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Total Sum\nMultiply the number of pairs by \\(-1\\):\n\\[\n50 \\times (-1) = -50\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
