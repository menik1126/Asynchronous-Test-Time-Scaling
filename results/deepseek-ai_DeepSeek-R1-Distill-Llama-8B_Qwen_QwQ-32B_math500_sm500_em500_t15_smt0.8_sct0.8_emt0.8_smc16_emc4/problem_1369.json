            "output": "I need to determine the number of boys at the math club meeting given that there are 35 students in total and the number of girls is a multiple of 13 with more girls than boys.\n\nFirst, I'll let G represent the number of girls and B represent the number of boys. This gives me the equation G + B = 35.\n\nSince the number of girls is a multiple of 13, possible values for G are 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since the total number of students is 35, G cannot exceed 35. Therefore, the possible values for G are 13, 26.\n\nNext, I'll set up the inequality G > B, which can be rewritten as G > (35 - G) after substituting B = 35 - G. Solving this inequality gives 2G > 35, so G > 17.5. Since G must be a whole number, the smallest possible value for G is 18. However, since G must also be a multiple of 13, the smallest valid value is 26.\n\nFinally, substituting G = 26 into the total students equation, I get B = 35 - 26 = 9. Therefore, there are 9 boys at the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35.\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is greater than the number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls.\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys.\n\n**Equations:**\n1. \\( G + B = 35 \\)\u2003\u2003(1)\n2. \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13, i.e., \\( G = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.  \n3. \\( G > B \\)\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n**From equation (1):**\n\\( B = 35 - G \\)\n\n**Substitute \\( B \\) in equation (2):**\n\\( G > 35 - G \\)  \n\\( 2G > 35 \\)  \n\\( G > 17.5 \\)\n\nSince \\( G \\) must be a whole number and a multiple of 13, the smallest possible value for \\( G \\) is 26.\n\n**Substitute \\( G = 26"
