            "output": "First, I will expand the expression (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) to match the given quadratic form 10x² - x - 24.\n\nMultiplying Ax by Bx gives ABx², and multiplying Ax by 3 gives 3Ax. Multiplying -8 by Bx gives -8Bx, and multiplying -8 by 3 gives -24.\n\nCombining like terms, the expanded expression becomes ABx² + (3A - 8B)x - 24.\n\nNow, I'll set up equations by comparing coefficients with the original quadratic expression.\n\nStarting with the x² term: AB = 10.\n\nNext, for the x term: 3A - 8B = -1.\n\nFinally, the constant term is already matching, -24 = -24.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n1. AB = 10\n2. 3A - 8B = -1\n\nI'll solve these equations simultaneously. From the first equation, I can express A as A = 10/B.\n\nSubstituting A into the second equation: 3*(10/B) - 8B = -1, which simplifies to 30/B - 8B = -1.\n\nMultiplying both sides by B to eliminate the denominator: 30 - 8B² = -B.\n\nRearranging the terms: 8B² - 30 = B.\n\nBringing all terms to one side: 8B² - B - 30 = 0.\n\nNow, I'll solve this quadratic equation for B. Using the quadratic formula, B = [1 ± √(1 + 960)] / 16 = [1 ± 31] / 16.\n\nThis gives two possible solutions for B: (32)/16 = 2 or (-30)/16 = -15/8. Since B must be an integer, B = 2.\n\nSubstituting B = 2 back into AB = 10, we find A = 5.\n\nFinally, calculating AB + B: (5)(2) + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll factor the quadratic expression and find the integers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) such that:\n\n\\[\n10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\n\\]\n\n**Step 1"
