Since 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, I can set up the equation 3B = 7D. Solving for 1D, I get D = 3B/7.\n\nNext, I'll find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to one Trinket. One Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, so 1T = 4B.\n\nNow, I'll convert Drinkets to Blinkets by multiplying 56 Drinkets by 3/7. This gives me 56D * (3B/7) = 24B.\n\nFinally, I'll convert Blinkets to Trinkets by dividing the 24 Blinkets by 4. So, 24B \u00f7 4 = 6T.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are equal to 6 Trinkets in the land of Ink.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the value of **56 Drinkets** in **Trinkets** step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the relationships between the units:**\n   - **1 Trinket (T) = 4 Blinkets (B)**\n   - **3 Blinkets (B) = 7 Drinkets (D)**\n\n2. **Find the relationship between Drinkets and Trinkets:**\n   \n   We need to express **1 Drinket (D)** in terms of **Trinkets (T)**.\n\n3. **Express **1 D** in terms of **Blinkets (B)**:**\n   \n   From the second relationship:\n   \\[\n   3\\,B = 7\\,D \\implies 1\\,D = \\frac{3}{7}\\,B\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express **1 D** in terms of **Trinkets (T)**:**\n   \n   From the first relationship:\n   \\[\n   1\\,T = 4\\,B \\implies 1\\,B = \\frac{1}{4}\\,T\n   \\]\n   \n   Substitute into the equation for **1 D**:\n   \\[\n   1\\,D = \\frac{3}{7}\\times \\frac{1}{4}\\,T = \\frac{3}{28}\\,T\n"
