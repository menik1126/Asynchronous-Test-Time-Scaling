The east-west component will remain \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile, and the north-south component will be \\(1\\) mile. Applying the formula \\(\\sqrt{(\\frac{3}{4})^2 + 1^2}\\) and rounding to the nearest hundredth, the distance is approximately \\(1.22\\) miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**\nBill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south, then \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east, and finally \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south. How many miles is he, in a direct line, from his starting point? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Total Southward Distance:**\n   \n   Bill walks south twice:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eastward Distance:**\n   \n   Bill walks east once:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Direct Line Distance:**\n   \n   To find the straight-line distance from the starting point, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Imagine a right-angled triangle where:\n   - The east-west distance is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile.\n   - The north-south distance is \\(1\\) mile.\n\n   The straight-line distance (\\(d\\)) is given by:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(\\text{east-west})^2 + (\\text{north-south})^2}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} +"
