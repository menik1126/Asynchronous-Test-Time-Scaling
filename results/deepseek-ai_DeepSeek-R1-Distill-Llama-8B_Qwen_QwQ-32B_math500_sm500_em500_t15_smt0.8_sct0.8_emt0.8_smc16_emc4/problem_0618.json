            "output": "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, I will start by finding its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I observe that 196 is divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98.\n\nNext, I check if 98 can be divided by 2. Dividing 98 by 2 results in 49.\n\nNow, I factor 49. Since 49 is 7 multiplied by 7, the prime factors of 196 are 2, 2, 7, and 7.\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is (exponent of each prime factor + 1) multiplied together, I add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and multiply the results.\n\nAdding 1 to each exponent: (2 + 1) and (2 + 1).\n\nMultiplying these together: 3 times 3 equals 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 196**\n\n   Start by breaking down 196 into its prime factors.\n\n   \\[\n   196 \\div 2 = 98\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   98 \\div 2 = 49\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   49 = 7 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n   So, the prime factors of 196 are \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Divisor Formula**\n\n   The formula to find the number of positive divisors is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Divisors} = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\\dots(e_n + 1)\n   \\]\n\n   Where \\( e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n \\) are the exponents of the prime factors.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Divisors**\n\n   Using the exponents \\( 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\) from \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Divisors} = (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9"
