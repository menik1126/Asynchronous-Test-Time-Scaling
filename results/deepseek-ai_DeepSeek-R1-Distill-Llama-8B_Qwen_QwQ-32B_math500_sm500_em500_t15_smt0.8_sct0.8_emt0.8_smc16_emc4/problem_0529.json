Additionally, it matters who orders what, so Yann choosing chicken and Camille choosing fish is different from Yann choosing fish and Camille choosing chicken.\n\nFirst, I should understand the total number of possible combinations without any restrictions. Since both Yann and Camille have 10 choices each, the total number of combinations would be \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\).\n\nHowever, the problem states that they refuse to order the same dish. This means that if Yann chooses a particular dish, Camille cannot choose the same one. So, I need to subtract the scenarios where both have chosen the same dish.\n\nThere are 10 possible dishes that both could choose. For each dish, if Yann chooses it, Camille must choose a different one. Therefore, there are 9 valid choices for Camille. This results in \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\) valid combinations.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a permutation problem where the order matters. The number of ways to choose 2 different dishes out of 10, considering the order, is given by the permutation formula \\(P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!\\). Here, \\(n = 10\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(P(10, 2) = 10! / (10 - 2)! = 10! / 8! = 10 \\times 9 = 90\\).\n\nBoth approaches lead to the same result.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Total Possible Combinations**\n\n- **Yann** has **10** choices (one dish for each menu item).\n- **Camille** also has **10** choices.\n  \nTherefore, without any restrictions:\n\\[\n\\text{Total combinations} = 10 \\times 10 = 100\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Restriction (They Refuse to Order the Same Dish)**\n\n- If **Yann** chooses a specific dish, **Camille** cannot choose the same one.\n- This means for **Camille**, there are only **9** valid choices left (since one dish is already taken by Yann).\n"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
