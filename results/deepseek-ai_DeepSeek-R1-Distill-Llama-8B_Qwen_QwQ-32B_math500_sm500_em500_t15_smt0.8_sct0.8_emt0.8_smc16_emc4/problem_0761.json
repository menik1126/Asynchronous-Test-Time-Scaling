            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. The sequence is defined in a specific way: for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} forms a geometric sequence, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} forms an arithmetic sequence. They told me that a_{13} is 2016, and I need to find a_1. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are. A geometric sequence means that each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, if I have a, b, c as a geometric sequence, then b/a = c/b, which can be rewritten as b^2 = a*c. On the other hand, an arithmetic sequence means that each term is obtained by adding a common difference. So, for a, b, c, we have c - b = b - a, which simplifies to 2b = a + c.\n\nGiven that, the problem is telling me that for every k, the terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} form a geometric sequence, and a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic sequence. Since it's true for every positive integer k, this pattern should continue throughout the sequence.\n\nLet me try writing down some relationships using this info.\n\nFor k=1:\n- The geometric sequence is a1, a2, a3.\n  So, a2^2 = a1 * a3.  [Equation 1]\n\n- The arithmetic sequence is a2, a3, a4.\n  So, 2a3 = a2 + a4.  [Equation 2]\n\nFor k=2:\n- The geometric sequence is a3, a4, a5.\n  So, a4^2 = a3 * a5.  [Equation 3]\n\n- The arithmetic sequence is a4, a5, a6.\n  So, 2a5 = a4 + a6.  [Equation 4]\n\nSimilarly, for k=3:\n- The geometric sequence is a5, a6,"

[Equation 6]\n\nI think this pattern continues, but since I'm given a_13, perhaps I need to relate these equations stepping through each k until I reach the 13th term. Hmm.\n\nSince the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms are positive integers, and each term is larger than the one before. So, all a_i are positive integers, a1 < a2 < a3 < ... < a13 = 2016.\n\nI need to find a1. So, maybe I can find a pattern or a recursive formula for the terms in terms of a1.\n\nLet me try to express each term in terms of the previous ones using the given sequences.\n\nFrom the geometric sequence for k=1: a2^2 = a1 * a3. So, a3 = (a2^2) / a1.\n\nFrom the arithmetic sequence for k=1: 2a3 = a2 + a4. So, a4 = 2a3 - a2.\n\nSubstituting a3 from above: a4 = 2*(a2^2 / a1) - a2.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2:\n\nFrom the geometric sequence: a4^2 = a3 * a5.

So, substituting a3 into a6:\n\na6 = 2*( [ (2*(a2^2 / a1) - a2)^2 ] / (a2^2 / a1) ) - (2*(a2^2 / a1) - a2 )\n\nThat's getting complicated, but maybe we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume some values for a1 and see if the sequence"

So, 160,000 +38,400 +2,304=200,704\n\nYes, so a10^2 = a9 * a11, so that works.\n\nNow, moving back, the geometric triplet a7, a8, a9=224 must satisfy a8^2 = a7 *224.\n\nSo, a7 must divide 224, and a8 must be integer, and a8 >a7, a8 < a9=224.\n\nSo, possible a7 values: divisors of 224 less than 224.\n\nDivisors of 224: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 16, 28, 32, 49, 56, 98, 112, 196, 224.\n\nLet me consider each possible a7 and see if a8 is integer.\n\na7=1:\n\na8^2=224*1=224, which is not a perfect square, since 14^2=196, 15^2=225, so no.\n\na7=2:\n\na8^2=2*224=448. Not a square, since 21^2=441, 22^2=484.\n\na7=4:\n\na8^2=4*224=896. 29^2=841, 30^2=900, 31^2=961. 896 is not a square.\n\na7=7:\n\na8^2=7*224=1568. 39^2=1521, 40^2=1600, so no.\n\na7=8:\n\na"
