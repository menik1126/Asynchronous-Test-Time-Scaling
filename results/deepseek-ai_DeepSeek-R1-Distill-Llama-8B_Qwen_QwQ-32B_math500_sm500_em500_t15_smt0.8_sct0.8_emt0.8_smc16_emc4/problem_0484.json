Hmm, but this might not be the correct approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relationship between the sphere and the cube. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Re-examining the Sphere-Cube Relationship**\n\nThe sphere is entirely contained within the cube, so the sphere's diameter must equal the cube's edge length. Wait, no, that would be if the sphere is inscribed in the cube. But in this case, the sphere is formed by removing metal from the corners, so perhaps the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces?\n\nWait, actually, if the sphere is made by removing the corners, the sphere must fit perfectly inside the cube such that its diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube. Wait, but that would mean the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. But then the radius would be half the edge length. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. If the sphere has radius 3, then diameter is 6, so the cube's edge length is 6 inches. But then why mention removing metal from the corners?\n\nHmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, when you remove the corners of the cube, you are effectively truncating the cube's corners to form a rounded shape. The sphere must be tangent to the original cube's faces and edges. Wait, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces. In that case, the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. So if the sphere has radius 3, then the cube's edge length is 6 inches. But then the volume would be 6\u00b3 = 216 in\u00b3. But the problem states \"removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths.\" If the sphere is inscribed, then the cube's edge length is exactly twice the radius"

            "output": ", which is 6 inches.\n\nBut considering that when you cut off the cube's corners to form a sphere, the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. So the sphere's radius would be half of the cube's edge length, meaning the cube's edge length is twice the sphere's radius. Here, the sphere's radius is 3 inches, so the cube's edge length is 6 inches. Therefore, the cube's volume is 6\u00b3 = 216 in\u00b3.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the space diagonal, but that approach seems conflicting. Let me resolve this.\n\nIf the sphere is formed by cutting off the corners of the cube, the sphere must fit perfectly inside the cube. So the maximum sphere that can be inscribed in a cube touches the centers of the cube's faces. In that case, the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's edge length. Therefore, diameter = edge length, so if the sphere's radius is 3 inches, then the edge length is 6 inches, and the cube's volume is 6\u00b3 = 216 in\u00b3.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider the relationship between the sphere and the cube when cutting off corners.\n\nWhen you cut off each corner of the cube, you're effectively replacing a corner with a spherical segment. However, the sphere formed will have its center at the cube's center and will be tangent to the cube's faces. Thus, the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. Hence, the cube's edge length is 2 \u00d7 sphere's radius = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 inches.\n\nTherefore, the cube's volume is 6\u00b3 = 216 in\u00b3.\n\nHowever, another thought: When you remove a small tetrahedron from each corner, the sphere's radius relates to the cube's edge length differently. Perhaps the space diagonal is involved.\n\nLet me think again. The space diagonal of the cube is \\( s\\sqrt{3} \\). If the sphere is formed by cutting off the corners, then the sphere's diameter should equal the space diagonal of the cube.\n\nGiven the sphere's radius is 3 inches, its diameter is 6 inches. Therefore, \\( s\\sqrt{3} = 6 \\), so \\( s = 6 / \\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\) inches.\n\nThus, the cube's edge length is \\( 2\\sqrt{3}"

But this contradicts the previous approach.\n\nHmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, the problem states that the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of the cube. The key here is that the sphere must be entirely within the cube, and the cube has the shortest possible side lengths. To minimize the cube's side length, the sphere must be as large as possible relative to the cube.\n\nIf the sphere is inscribed in the cube (touching the centers of the faces), then the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. This requires the cube to have edge length 6 inches. However, if the sphere is instead inscribed in the cube's space diagonal, then the sphere's diameter equals the space diagonal, which would require a smaller cube edge length. But which interpretation is correct?\n\nWait, the problem says \"removing metal from the corners of a cube\". When you remove the corners, you are creating a rounded shape. The sphere must be tangent to the original cube's edges or faces. Let me think of the standard case.\n\nIn standard geometry, the largest sphere that can fit inside a cube touches the centers of the cube's faces. This requires the sphere's diameter to equal the cube's edge length. However, if you are removing the corners to form a sphere, perhaps the sphere is tangent to the edges of the cube. Let me consider coordinates.\n\nLet the cube have edge length \\( s \\), centered at the origin. The corners are at \\( (\\pm s/2, \\pm s/2, \\pm s/2) \\). When you remove the corners, you are cutting off each corner such that the sphere is tangent to the original edges. The sphere's center is at the cube's center. The distance from the center to any corner is \\( \\sqrt{(s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2} = s\\sqrt{3}/2 \\). If the sphere is to reach the corners, its radius would be \\( s\\sqrt{3}/2 \\). But the problem states the sphere has radius 3, so:\n\n\\( s\\sqrt{3}/2 = 3 \\implies s = "

It appears that the correct interpretation is that the sphere touches the cube's corners, so the sphere's radius is \\( s\\sqrt{3}/2 \\), leading to \\( s = 2\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nTherefore, the cube's volume is \\( 24\\sqrt{3} \\) in\u00b3.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If the sphere is created by cutting off the corners, the sphere's radius corresponds to the distance from the cube's center to the point where the sphere touches the original cube's edges.\n\nIn a cube with edge length \\( s \\), the distance from the center to the midpoint of an edge is \\( (s/2)\\sqrt{2}/2 = s\\sqrt{2}/4 \\).\n\nIf the sphere's radius is equal to this distance, then:\n\n\\( s\\sqrt{2}/4 = 3 \\implies s = 12/\\sqrt{2} = 6\\sqrt{2} \\approx 8.485 \\) inches.\n\nThis complicates things further. It seems there are multiple ways to interpret the problem. Let's clarify.\n\nThe problem states that the steel sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of the cube. The key is that the sphere is entirely inside the cube, and the cube has the shortest possible side lengths to do so.\n\nThe sphere's radius relates to the cube's edge length based on the geometry of the truncation. If we remove a pyramid from each corner, the sphere's radius is related to the cube's edge length and the truncation amount. However, to ensure the sphere is the largest possible within the cube, the sphere must fit snugly without extending beyond the cube's boundaries.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the initial approach where the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length is the intended interpretation, leading to a cube edge length of 6 inches and volume 216 in\u00b3. However, considering the standard geometric relationship where the sphere touches the cube's edges or corners,"

Since the sphere has radius 3, the edge length is 6, so volume is 6\u00b3 = 216. This is straightforward and likely the correct answer.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths.\" If the sphere is inscribed in the cube (touching the centers of the faces), then the cube's edge length is exactly twice the sphere's radius, so 6 inches. This is the minimal cube that can contain the sphere. Therefore, the volume is 6\u00b3 = 216.\n\nHowever, if the sphere is formed by cutting off the corners, perhaps the sphere is larger than the inscribed sphere? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the sphere is the one that touches the cube's edges, requiring a smaller cube.\n\nWait, let me think of the cube and sphere:\n\n- The inscribed sphere (touching faces) has diameter equal to edge length.\n\n- The sphere touching the edges would have a radius equal to half the space diagonal divided by sqrt(3).

No, because removing the corners would create a rounded shape with a larger radius? No, that's not possible because the sphere must be entirely within the cube.\n\nWait, I think I misapplied. The inscribed sphere is the largest possible sphere that can fit inside the cube without any part sticking out. If you remove the corners, you can actually have a sphere that touches the points where the original cube's corners were, but the sphere can't protrude beyond the cube's original edges.\n\nThus, the sphere's radius is determined by the cube's edge length in relation to the sphere's position.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct relationship is that the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length.
