            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: given z equals 1 plus i and w equals (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). I need to find the modulus of w, which is |w|. Hmm, complex numbers can be a bit tricky sometimes, but I think I can handle this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what modulus means for a complex number. If I have a complex number a + bi, its modulus is the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So, |w| will be the square root of (the real part of w squared plus the imaginary part squared).\n\nNow, I need to figure out what w actually is. It's given by (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). Since z is 1 + i, I can substitute that in. So, let's compute 3z + 1 and 5z + 7 first.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 3z + 1. Since z is 1 + i, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(1 + i) which is 3 + 3i. Then, adding 1, the numerator becomes (3 + 1) + 3i, which simplifies to 4 + 3i.\n\nNext, the denominator: 5z + 7. Again, z is 1 + i, so 5*(1 + i) is 5 + 5i. Adding 7 gives (5 + 7) + 5i, which simplifies to 12 + 5i.\n\nSo now, w is (4 + 3i) divided by (12 + 5i). Dividing complex numbers isn't as straightforward as adding or subtracting them, so I remember that to divide complex numbers, I should multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i.\n\nSo, let's do that. Multiply both numerator and denominator by 12 - 5i:\n\nw = (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) / [(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)]\n\nLet me compute the numerator first. Using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\n(4)(12) + (4)(-5i) + (3i)(12) + ("

            "output": "3i)(-5i)\n= 48 - 20i + 36i - 15i\u00b2\n\nWait, remember that i squared is -1, so -15i\u00b2 is -15*(-1) which is +15. So now, let's combine like terms.\n\n48 + 15 = 63\n-20i + 36i = 16i\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to 63 + 16i.\n\nNow, the denominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i). This is a difference of squares, so it's equal to 12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2.\n\n12 squared is 144. (5i) squared is 25i\u00b2, which is 25*(-1) = -25. So, 144 - (-25) is 144 + 25, which is 169.\n\nSo now, w is (63 + 16i) divided by 169. To separate the real and imaginary parts, I can write this as (63/169) + (16/169)i.\n\nNow, to find |w|, which is the modulus, I need to compute the square root of (real part squared plus imaginary part squared).\n\nSo, let's compute (63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2.\n\nFirst, compute 63 squared: 63*63. Let me think, 60 squared is 3600, plus 2*60*3 is 360, plus 3 squared is 9, so 3600 + 360 + 9 = 3969.\n\nSimilarly, 16 squared is 256.\n\nSo, adding these together: 3969 + 256 = 4225.\n\nSince both terms are over 169 squared, which is 169*169. Let's compute 169 squared. 170 squared is 28900, so 169 squared is 28900 - 2*170 + 1 = 28900 - 340 + 1 = 28561.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me compute 169*169 step by step.\n\n169 multiplied by 100 is 16900.\n\n169 multiplied by 70 is 11830.\n\n169 multiplied by 9 is 1521.\n\nSo adding them together: 16900 + 11830 = 28730, plus 1521 is 30251. Wait, that doesn't make sense because"

Hmm, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, sqrt(4225) is 65 because 65^2 = 4225.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(28561) is 169 because 169^2 = 28561.\n\nSo, sqrt(4225 / 28561) = 65/169.\n\nWait, can this be simplified? Let me see, 65 and 169. 65 factors into 5*13. 169 is 13 squared. So, we can simplify 65/169 as (5*13)/(13*13) which reduces to 5/13.\n\nSo, the modulus of w is 5/13.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recap.\n\nz = 1+i, w=(3z +1)/(5z +7). Substituted z, got 4+3i over 12+5i. Then multiplied numerator and denominator by 12-5i to get 63 +16i over 169. Then modulus squared is (63^2 +16^2)/169^2, which is 4225/28561. Square root of that is 65/169, which reduces to 5/13. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think I did everything correctly.
