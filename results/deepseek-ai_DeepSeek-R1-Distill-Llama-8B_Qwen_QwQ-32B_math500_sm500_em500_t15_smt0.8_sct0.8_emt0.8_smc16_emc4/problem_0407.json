Multiplying 33.333 by 60 gives 2000 rotations per minute. To find the time per rotation in seconds, I'll divide 60 by 2000, resulting in 0.03 seconds per rotation.\n\nFor the second gear, which turns 45 times per minute, I'll perform similar calculations. Multiplying 45 by 60 yields 2700 rotations per minute. Dividing 60 by 2700 gives 0.0222 seconds per rotation.\n\nNext, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two rotation periods to determine when both gears will align again. The LCM of 0.03 and 0.0222 is 0.06 seconds.\n\nFinally, I'll convert 0.06 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60, which gives 1 minute. Therefore, both gears will next point due north after 1 minute, or 60 seconds.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine after how many seconds both gears will have their marks pointing due north again.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Rotation Rates per Second\nFirst, convert the number of rotations per minute to rotations per second.\n\n1. **First Gear:**\n   - Rotations per minute: \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} = 33.333 \\) times\n   - Rotations per second: \\( \\frac{33.333}{60} = 0.5556 \\) times per second\n\n2. **Second Gear:**\n   - Rotations per minute: \\( 45 \\) times\n   - Rotations per second: \\( \\frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \\) times per second\n\n### Step 2: Determine When Both Gears Align\nThe gears will align when the number of rotations each has made is an integer multiple of their respective periods. This means we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods.\n\n1. **Find the LCM of their periods:**\n   - Period of first gear: \\( \\frac{1}{0.5556} \\approx 1.8 \\) seconds per rotation\n   - Period of second gear: \\( \\frac{1"

Wait, this approach is incorrect. Let me correct.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n- LCM of periods in minutes:\n  - Period of first gear: \\( \\frac{1}{100/3} = \\frac{3}{100} \\) minutes\n  - Period of second gear: \\( \\frac{1}{45} \\) minutes\n  - LCM of \\( \\frac{3}{100} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{45} \\):\n    - LCM of numerators (3 and 1): 3\n    - GCD of denominators (100 and 45): 5\n    - LCM: \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) minutes = 36"
