            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Find k if (3^k)^6 equals 3^6. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, (a^b)^c equals a^(b*c). Let me check if that's right. Yeah, that seems correct because exponents rules say that when you have a power raised to a power, you multiply the exponents. So applying that here, (3^k)^6 should be 3^(k*6). \n\nSo now the equation becomes 3^(6k) equals 3^6. Wait, both sides have the same base, which is 3. I remember that if a^b = a^c, then b must equal c, provided that a is not equal to 1 or -1 or 0, because those can sometimes cause issues. But in this case, the base is 3, which is positive and not 1, so it's safe to say that the exponents must be equal. \n\nThat means 6k must equal 6. So, 6k = 6. To solve for k, I can divide both sides by 6. So, k = 6/6, which simplifies to k = 1. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. Starting with (3^k)^6, applying the power rule gives 3^(6k). Setting this equal to 3^6, so 6k = 6, hence k = 1. Yeah, that seems to make sense. I don't think I've made any mistakes here. So, k should be 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\) in the equation \\( (3^k)^6 = 3^6 \\):\n\n1. Apply the power of a power property: \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n} \\).\n2. This gives \\( 3^{6k} = 3^6 \\).\n3. Since the bases are equal, set the exponents equal: \\( 6k = 6 \\).\n4. Solve for \\( k \\): \\( k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\( k = \\boxed{1} \\)"
