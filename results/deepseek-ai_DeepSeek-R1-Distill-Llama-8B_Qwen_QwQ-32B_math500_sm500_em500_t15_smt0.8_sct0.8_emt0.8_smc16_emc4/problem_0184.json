The problem says:\n\nLet z = 1 + i and w = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). Find |w|.\n\nAlright, so z is a complex number, 1 + i. I need to find the modulus of w, which is a complex number resulting from the division of two other complex numbers. \n\nFirst, I think I should compute 3z + 1 and 5z + 7 separately. Since z is 1 + i, I can substitute that in.\n\nSo, let's compute 3z + 1. z is 1 + i, so 3z would be 3*(1 + i) which is 3*1 + 3*i = 3 + 3i. Then, adding 1 gives 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i. So, 3z + 1 equals 4 + 3i.\n\nNext, compute 5z + 7. Again, z is 1 + i, so 5z is 5*(1 + i) = 5*1 + 5*i = 5 + 5i. Adding 7 gives 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i. So, 5z + 7 equals 12 + 5i.\n\nNow, w is (3z + 1)/(5z + 7), which we've now computed as (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). So, w is the fraction (4 + 3i) divided by (12 + 5i).\n\nTo find the modulus of w, I recall that the modulus of a quotient of two complex numbers is equal to the quotient of their moduli. In other words, |w| = |3z + 1| / |5z + 7|.\n\nSince we already computed 3z + 1 = 4 + 3i and 5z + 7 = 12 + 5i, we can find their moduli and then divide.\n\nThe modulus of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, let's compute |4 + 3i| first.\n\nThat's sqrt(4\u00b2"

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, confirming 3z + 1: z is 1 + i, so 3z is 3*(1) + 3*(i) = 3 + 3i. Adding 1: 3 + 1 = 4, so 4 + 3i. Correct.\n\nThen, 5z + 7: 5*(1) + 5*(i) = 5 + 5i. Adding 7: 5 + 7 = 12, so 12 + 5i. Correct.\n\nCalculating |4 + 3i|: sqrt(4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5. Correct.\n\nCalculating |12 + 5i|: sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13. Correct.\n\nThen, |w| = 5 / 13. That seems right. Alternatively, I could compute w by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to get a real number and then take the modulus, just to confirm.\n\nLet me try that method as a cross-check.\n\nSo, w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is 12 - 5i.\n\nSo, numerator becomes (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i).\n\nDenominator becomes (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i) = 12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2 = 144 - 25i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 = -1, this becomes 144 - (-25) = 144 + 25 = 169.\n\nSo denominator is 169. Let's compute numerator:\n\n(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) = 4*12 + 4*(-5i) + 3i*12 + 3i*(-5i)\n\n= 48 - 20i +"

Because when we multiply (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i), we have:\n\nFirst term: 4*12 = 48\n\nSecond term: 4*(-5i) = -20i\n\nThird term: 3i*12 = 36i\n\nFourth term: 3i*(-5i) = -15i\u00b2 = +15 (since i\u00b2 = -1)\n\nSo adding all together: 48 -20i +36i +15 = (48 +15) + (-20i +36i) = 63 +16i.\n\nYes, so numerator is 63 +16i, denominator is 169.\n\nSo, w = (63 +16i)/169.\n\nSo, to find |w|, which is the modulus, compute sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2)/169.\n\nBut wait, no. Since w is (63 +16i)/169, the modulus is |63 +16i| divided by 169, which is sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2)/169.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before because |w| = |3z +1| / |5z +7|, which is 5/13, and sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2)/169 is sqrt(3969 +256)= sqrt(4225)=65. So 65/169=5/13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which reinforces that |w| is 5/13.\n\nHmm, another way to think about it is that modulus is multiplicative, so |w|=|3z +1| / |5z +7| as I did first.\n\nWait, so yeah. Both approaches lead me to 5/13. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe modulus of \\( w \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven \\( z = 1"
