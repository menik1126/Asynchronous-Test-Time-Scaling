Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet and each of the two positions must be different, the number of options for the first letter is 26. For the second letter, there are 25 remaining options because it must be different from the first.\n\nNext, calculate the number of possible combinations for the numbers. There are 10 possible digits (0-9) for the first number and 9 remaining options for the second number, as it must be different from the first.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of possible license plates that can be formed under the given conditions:\n\n**Conditions:**\n- **Letters:** 2 different letters from A to Z.\n- **Numbers:** 2 different one-digit numbers from 0 to 9.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of possible combinations for the letters.**\n\n- **First letter:** There are 26 possible choices (A-Z).\n- **Second letter:** Since it must be different from the first, there are \\(26 - 1 = 25\\) remaining choices.\n\n**Total letter combinations:**\n\\[\n26 \\times 25 = 650\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of possible combinations for the numbers.**\n\n- **First number:** There are 10 possible choices (0-9).\n- **Second number:** Since it must be different from the first, there are \\(10 - 1 = 9\\) remaining choices.\n\n**Total number combinations:**\n\\[\n10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Combine the letter and number combinations.**\n\n- **Total license plates:** \\(650 \\times 90 = 58,500\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{58,\\!500}\n\\]"
