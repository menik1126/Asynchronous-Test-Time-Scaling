            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of a vertical asymptote, another vertical asymptote, and a horizontal asymptote for the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 - 5x - 14). Then, I need to add them all together to get the final answer. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for rational functions like this one, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but only if the numerator isn't zero at those points as well. So, I should start by factoring the denominator to find where it equals zero.\n\nThe denominator is x\u00b2 - 5x - 14. I need to factor this quadratic. Let me see, I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 are...  Let's think: 2 and -7. Because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect. So, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). That means the denominator is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x - 7 = 0, which gives x = -2 and x = 7. So, these are my vertical asymptotes. So, a and b are -2 and 7.\n\nWait, but I should confirm that the numerator isn't zero at these points. The numerator is 2x. So, plugging in x = -2, 2*(-2) = -4 \u2260 0, and x = 7, 2*7 = 14 \u2260 0. So, yes, these are definitely vertical asymptotes.\n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I remember there's a rule for the horizontal asymptote of a rational function where the degrees of the numerator and denominator are compared. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. If the numerator's degree is higher, then there's no horizontal asymptote, but instead, possibly an oblique or slant asymptote.\n\nLooking at f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14), the numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. So, since"

            "output": " the numerator's degree is less than the denominator's, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Therefore, c is 0.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The leading term of the numerator is 2x, and the leading term of the denominator is x\u00b2. So, as x approaches infinity, the function behaves like 2x / x\u00b2 = 2/x, which approaches 0. Yep, so horizontal asymptote at y = 0. That seems right.\n\nSo, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x =7, so a = -2 and b =7, and the horizontal asymptote is y =0, so c=0. Therefore, adding them together: a + b + c = (-2) +7 +0 = 5. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in factoring the denominator. Let me re-factor x\u00b2 -5x -14. Let me see, the factors of -14 that add to -5. Let me list the pairs:\n\nFactors of -14:\n1 and -14 (sum -13)\n-1 and 14 (sum 13)\n2 and -7 (sum -5)\n-2 and 7 (sum 5)\n\nAh, so the correct pair is 2 and -7, so the factors are (x +2)(x -7). So, yes, that gives roots at x = -2 and x =7. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptotes are indeed at x = -2 and x =7, so a and b are -2 and 7. Adding them gives 5, plus c which is 0, so total is 5. \n\nHmm, but wait, the question says \"vertical asymptotes x=a and x=b\". So, a and b are the x-values, so they are -2 and 7. So, a + b is (-2) +7 =5, plus c=0, so total is 5. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just confirm once more about the horizontal asymptote. Since the degree of the numerator is 1, denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So, yes, c=0. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 5. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n"
