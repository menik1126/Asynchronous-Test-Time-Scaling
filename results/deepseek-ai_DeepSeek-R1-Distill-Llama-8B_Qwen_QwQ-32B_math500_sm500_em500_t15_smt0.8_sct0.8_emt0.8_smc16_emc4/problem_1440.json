Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that on the left side, I have 3^{2x}. I remember that 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, which simplifies to 9^x. So, I can rewrite the equation as 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That might make it a bit easier to handle.\n\nNow, the equation is 9^x + 19 = 10^x. I want to get all the terms involving x on one side. Maybe I can subtract 9^x from both sides to get 19 = 10^x - 9^x. Hmm, that seems manageable.\n\nSo, 10^x - 9^x = 19. I wonder if I can factor this somehow. I recall that 10^x can be written as (2*5)^x, which is 2^x * 5^x. But I don't know if that helps immediately. Maybe instead, I should consider substitution.\n\nLet me set y = 10^x. Then, since 9^x is (10/1.111...)^x? Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, 9^x can be written as (10/ (10/9))^x, which is (10)^x / (10/9)^x. Hmm, that seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me consider t = 10^x. Then, 9^x can be written as (9/10)^x * 10^x, which is (9/10)^x * t. So, substituting back, the equation becomes t + 19 = t + (9/10)^x * t. Hmm, let me write that out:\n\nt + 19 = t + [(9/10)^x] * t.\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Maybe I should subtract 9^x from both sides, as I did before: t - (9/10)^x * t = 19. But that seems like I'm going in circles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the ratio of 10^x to 9^x"

Then, moving terms around, 19 = (r * 9^x) - 9^x = 9^x (r - 1). Since r = (10/9)^x, that gives 19 = 9^x [ (10/9)^x - 1 ].\n\nLet me compute (10/9)^x * 9^x. Wait, (10/9)^x * 9^x = (10^x / 9^x) * 9^x = 10^x. So that actually is just the original equation again. Hmm, maybe this substitution isn't helping.\n\nPerhaps I should try plugging in some integer values for x to see if they satisfy the equation. Maybe the solution is an integer?\n\nLet's try x = 0: 3^{0} + 19 = 1 + 19 = 20. On the right side, 10^0 = 1. 20 \u2260 1, so not x=0.\n\nx = 1: 3^2 +19 = 9 + 19 = 28. 10^1 =10. Not equal.\n\nx=2: 3^4 +19 = 81 +19 = 100. 10^2 =100. Hey, that works! 100 = 100. So x=2 is a solution.\n\nWait a second, so x=2 is a solution. But maybe there are more solutions?\n\nLet me check x=3: 3^6 +19 = 729 +19 = 748. 10^3=1000. Nope.\n\nWhat about negative values? Let's try x= -1: 3^{-2} +19 = 1/9 +19 \u224819.111 vs 10^{-1"

But sometimes exponential equations can have more than one solution.\n\nLet me think about the behavior of both sides. The left side is 9^x +19, and the right side is 10^x.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, 10^x grows much faster than 9^x, so 10^x will dominate and eventually, 10^x will be larger than 9^x +19. At x=2, they are equal.\n\nWhat about when x is very negative? 9^x approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity, so left side approaches 19, and 10^x approaches 0 as well. So 19 vs 0, left side is bigger.\n\nSo, maybe the function f(x)=10^x -9^x -19 crosses zero at x=2 and maybe another point. Wait, let's check at x=1: 10 -9 -19= -18. At x=2:100 -81 -19=0.\n\nWhat's happening between x=0 and x=2? At x=0:1 -1 -19= -19.\n\nx=1:10 -9 -19= -18.\n\nx=2:100 -81 -19=0.\n\nSo the function is increasing from x=0 to x=2, going from -19 to 0. Since it's an exponential function, it's always increasing, so it might only cross the x-axis once at x=2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the derivative to see if it's always increasing.\n\nThe derivative of f(x)=10^x -9^x -19 is ln(10)*10^x - ln(9)*9^x. Since 10^x and 9^x are positive for all x, and ln(10) > ln(9), the derivative is positive for all x. Therefore, f(x) is strictly increasing.\n\nSince f(x) is strictly increasing and it was negative at x=0 and zero at x=2, there are no other solutions. So x=2 is the only solution.\n\nBut wait, in my initial"

So only one solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is x=2.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again. Let me plug x=2 into the original equation:\n\n3^{2*2} +19 = 3^4 +19 =81 +19=100. 10^2=100. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the only solution is x=2. I think that's it. I don't see any other possible solutions given the function's behavior.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we rewrite the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\) by recognizing that \\(3^{2x}\\) can be expressed as \\(9^x\\). This gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\n9^x + 19 = 10^x\n\\]\n\nNext, we rearrange the terms to isolate the exponential expressions on one side:\n\n\\[\n10^x - 9^x = 19\n\\]\n\nWe test integer values for \\(x\\) to find potential solutions. Trying \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n3^{2 \\cdot 2} + 19 = 3^4 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100\n\\]\n\\[\n10^2 = 100\n\\]\n\nBoth sides equal 100, so \\(x = 2\\) is a solution. \n\nTo determine if there are other solutions, we analyze the behavior of the function \\(f(x) = 10^x - 9^x - 19\\). The derivative \\(f'(x) = \\ln(10) \\cdot 10^x - \\ln(9) \\cdot 9^x\\) is always positive because \\(\\ln(10) > \\ln(9)\\) and both \\(10^x\\) and \\(9^x\\) are positive. This means \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing. \n\nSince \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing and \\(f(2) = 0\\), there"
