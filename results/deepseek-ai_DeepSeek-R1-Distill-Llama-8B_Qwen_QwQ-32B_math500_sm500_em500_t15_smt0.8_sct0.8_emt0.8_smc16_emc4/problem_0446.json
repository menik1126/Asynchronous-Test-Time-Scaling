The numbers being added are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on, which means they are consecutive odd numbers.\n\nNext, I'll determine how many terms are in this sequence. The last term provided is 199. To find the number of terms, I'll use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference.\n\nHere, a_1 is 1, d is 2 (since the numbers increase by 2), and a_n is 199. Plugging these values into the formula: 199 = 1 + (n - 1)*2. Solving for n gives me n = 100.\n\nNow, I know there are 100 terms in the sequence. To find the sum of the first n odd numbers, I can use the formula Sum = n^2. So, the sum of the first 100 odd numbers is 100^2, which equals 10,000.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the modulo 7 remainder of 10,000. Performing 10,000 divided by 7 gives a quotient of 1428 and a remainder of 4. Therefore, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is a series of consecutive odd numbers.
