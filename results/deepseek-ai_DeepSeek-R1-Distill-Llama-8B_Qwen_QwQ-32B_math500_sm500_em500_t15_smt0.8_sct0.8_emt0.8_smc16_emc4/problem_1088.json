The function f is defined recursively, which means it has a base case and then builds up from there. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem in my own words to make sure I understand it. We have a function f that takes two arguments: i and j. i can be any non-negative integer (0,1,2,...), and j is an integer between 0 and 4, inclusive. The function f: {0,1,2,3,...} \u00d7 {0,1,2,3,4} \u2192 {0,1,2,3,4} is defined recursively with three cases.\n\nThe first case is when i is 0. In this case, f(0, j) is just mod_5(j + 1). mod_5(n) means the remainder when n is divided by 5, right? So for example, mod_5(0) is 0, mod_5(1) is 1, and so on up to mod_5(4) which is 4. Then, when j is 5, it would wrap around to 0 again. But in the first case, i is fixed at 0, and j can be 0 to 4.\n\nThe second case is when i is at least 1 and j is 0. Here, f(i, 0) is equal to f(i - 1, 1). So, if I have f(2015, 0), it would be f(2014, 1). Similarly, f(2014, 0) would be f(2013, 1), and so on, recursively.\n\nThe third case is a bit more complicated. For i at least 1 and j from 1 to 4, f(i, j) is equal to f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). So, it's a nested recursive call where you first compute f(i, j - 1), then use that result as the new j value for f(i - 1, ...).\n\nSo, we need to find f(2015, 2). That seems pretty deep into the recursion, but maybe there's a pattern or cycle that we can exploit instead of computing all"
