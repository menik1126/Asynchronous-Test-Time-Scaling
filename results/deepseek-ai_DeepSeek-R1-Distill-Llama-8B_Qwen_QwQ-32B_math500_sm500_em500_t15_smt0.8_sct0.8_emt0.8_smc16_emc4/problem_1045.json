Hmm, all the coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) are integers, but I don't know their specific values. The polynomial is a quartic (degree 4), so there could be up to four roots, but the question is about possible rational roots.\n\nI remember something called the Rational Root Theorem. Let me try to recall how that works. I think it says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, let me note that down. \n\nThe constant term factors: The factors of 1 are just ±1. \n\nThe leading coefficient factors: The factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. \n\nSo, according to the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is ±1 and \\(q\\) is ±1, ±2. \n\nNow, let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = 1\\): gives 1/1 = 1\n2. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = -1\\): gives -1\n3. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = 2\\): gives 1/2\n4. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = -2\\): gives -1/2\n\nSimilarly, for \\(p = -1\\):\n\n5. \\(p = -1\\), \\(q = 1\\): -1/1 = -1\n6. \\(p = -1\\), \\(q = -1\\): 1\n7. \\(p = -1\\), \\(q = 2\\): -1/2\n8. \\(p = -1\\), \\(q = -2\\): 1/2\n\nWait, but this is going to list some roots twice. For example,"

            "output": " both 1 and -1 are appearing multiple times. So, to avoid duplication, let me list all unique possibilities.\n\nLooking at the possible values for \\(p/q\\), we have:\n\n1/1 = 1, -1/1 = -1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/(-1) which is -1, same as before, 1/-2 which is -1/2, same as before, etc.\n\nSo the unique possible rational roots are: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nThat gives us four possible rational roots.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I haven't missed anything. The theorem says that any rational root in lowest terms must have \\(p\\) dividing the constant term and \\(q\\) dividing the leading coefficient. So yeah, the constant term is 1, so \\(p\\) can only be ±1, and leading coefficient is 2, so \\(q\\) can be ±1 or ±2.\n\nTherefore, all possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2. That's four different possible rational roots.\n\nI can also check an example. Suppose the polynomial is 2x^4 + 3x^3 + 4x^2 + 5x +1. Then possible rational roots would be ±1, ±1/2. If it factors, maybe some of them are actual roots, but the question is about possible, so all four are possible unless some are excluded by the polynomial's structure. But since the coefficients are integers, those four are all possibilities regardless of \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\). So, the number is four.\n</think>\n\nThe possible rational roots of the polynomial are ±1 and ±1/2, totaling four different possible rational roots.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the polynomial structure:**\n   The given polynomial is \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\), where \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) are integers.\n\n2. **Apply the Rational Root Theorem:**\n   The theorem states that any rational solution \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) of the polynomial equation, reduced to lowest terms, must have:\n   - \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term.\n  "
