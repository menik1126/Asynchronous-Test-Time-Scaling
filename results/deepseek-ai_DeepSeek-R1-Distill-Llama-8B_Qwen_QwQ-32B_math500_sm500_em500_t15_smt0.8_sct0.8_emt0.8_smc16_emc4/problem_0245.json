Therefore, the repeating period is a divisor of 11110.\n\nNext, I'll perform the division of 31 by 11111 to find the repeating decimal. Through long division, I find that the decimal is 0.002800028... with \"028\" repeating.\n\nIdentifying the repeating sequence, I see that \"028\" has three digits. Thus, the length of the repeating period is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of digits that repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Fraction\nThe fraction given is \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\). Since the denominator is \\(11111\\), which is a **prime number**, the decimal expansion will be a **repeating decimal**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Length of the Repeating Period\nFor a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), where \\(b\\) is a prime number and the numerator \\(a\\) is not divisible by \\(b\\), the length of the repeating period (the number of digits that repeat) can be found by using Euler's theorem or performing long division.\n\n- **Euler's Theorem Approach**:\n  - Euler's totient function: \\(\\phi(11111) = 11110\\).\n  - The repeating period is a divisor of \\(11110\\). Possible divisors include \\(1, 2, 5, 10, 1111, 2222, 5555, 11110\\).\n  - Through trial, we find that the repeating period is **3 digits**.\n\n- **Long Division Approach**:\n  - Perform long division of \\(31\\) by \\(11111\\):\n    - \\(11111 \\div 31 = 0.\\overline{028}\\).\n  - The repeating sequence is \"028\".\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nThe repeating decimal is"
