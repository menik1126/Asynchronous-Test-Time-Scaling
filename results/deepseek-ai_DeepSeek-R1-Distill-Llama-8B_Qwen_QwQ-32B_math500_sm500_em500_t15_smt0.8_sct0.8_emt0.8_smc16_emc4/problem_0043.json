            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number that are less than the number itself.\n\nI'll start by factoring 284 into its prime components. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. Dividing 142 by 2 again gives me 71, which is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p^(n+1) - 1)/(p - 1) for a prime p raised to the power of n, I can calculate the sum of all divisors of 284. Plugging in the values, the sum is (2^3 - 1)/(2 - 1) + (71^2 - 1)/(71 - 1), which simplifies to 15 + 3,048, which equals 3,063.\n\nNow, I need to identify the proper divisors of 284 by subtracting 284 from the total sum of its divisors, resulting in 3,063 minus 284, which is 2,779.\n\nFinally, I'll find the sum of the proper divisors of 2,779. Factoring 2,779, I notice that it is divisible by 13. Dividing 2,779 by 13 gives me 213. Breaking down 213 further, I find it is divisible by 3, yielding 71 after division. Since 71 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 2,779 is 13 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 71.\n\nApplying the sum of divisors formula again, the sum of all divisors of 2,779 is (13^2 - 1)/(13 - 1) + (3^2 - 1)/(3 - 1) + (71^2 - 1)/(71 - 1), which equals 168 + 8 + 3,048, totaling 3,224.\n\nSubtracting 2,779 from this sum gives me the proper divisors' total, which is 3,224 minus 2,779, resulting in 445.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 445.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow"
