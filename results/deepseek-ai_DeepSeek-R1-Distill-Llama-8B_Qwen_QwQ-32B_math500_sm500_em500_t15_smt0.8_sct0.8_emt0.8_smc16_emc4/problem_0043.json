            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\nTo do this, I'll start by determining all the positive divisors of 284.\n\nSince 284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142.\n\nNext, I'll check if 142 can be divided by smaller prime numbers like 2, 3, and 5. It turns out 142 divided by 2 equals 71, which is a prime number.\n\nNow, I have the prime factors of 284 as 2^2 * 71. Using the formula for the sum of divisors, the sum of all divisors, including 284 itself, is (1 + 2 + 71)(1 + 2) = 74 * 3 = 222.\n\nSubtracting 284 from this total gives the sum of the proper divisors: 222 - 284 = -62. However, this result doesn't make sense since the sum of proper divisors should be positive. I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nRe-evaluating the divisors of 284, I realize that the proper divisors are only 1, 2, and 4. Adding these together gives 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\nFinally, I'll find the sum of the proper divisors of 7. Since 7 is a prime number, its only proper divisor is 1. Therefore, the sum is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n\\n\\n\n**Step 1: Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n\nFirst, identify all proper divisors of 284, which are positive integers less than 284 that divide it without leaving a remainder.\n\n- **List of proper divisors of 284:**\n  - 1 (since 1 divides every integer)\n  - 2 (284 \u00f7 2 = 142)\n  - 4 (284 \u00f7 4 = 71)\n  - 71 (284 \u00f7 71 = 4)\n  - 142 (284 \u00f7 142 = 2)\n\n- **Sum of proper divisors of 284:**\n  \\[\n  1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220\n  \\]\n\n\\n\\n\n**Step 2: Find"
