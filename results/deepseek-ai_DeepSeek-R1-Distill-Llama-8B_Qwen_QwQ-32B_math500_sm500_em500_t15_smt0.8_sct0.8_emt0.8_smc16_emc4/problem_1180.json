I need to solve the equation \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\) and then find the area of the convex polygon formed by its solutions in the complex plane.

Solving quartic equations can be quite involved, but maybe there's a substitution or factoring trick here. Let me see if I can factor this equation.\n\nLooking at the coefficients: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Hmm, the coefficients seem to follow a pattern. Let me check if this is a quadratic in disguise. Maybe I can make a substitution like \\( w = z + i \\) or something similar. Let me consider that.\n\nLet me try substituting \\( w = z + a \\), where \\( a \\) is a constant to be determined. Then, \\( z = w - a \\). Substituting this into the equation might simplify it.\n\nBut before that, let me see if I can factor the equation as a quadratic in \\( z^2 \\).

Since the w's form a square, the area would be the area of that square.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the area of the square formed by the w's, that would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the polygon is a square, so the area is (side length)^2.

The area of a square inscribed in a circle of radius r is 2r^2. Because the diagonal of the square is 2r, so if diagonal d = 2r, then the side length s is d / sqrt(2) = 2r / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) r, so area is s^2 = 2 r^2.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the radius is 2^{1/8}, so area would be 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2*(2^{1/4}) = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me confirm this.\n\nLet me think again. The square is inscribed in a circle of radius R = 2^{1/8}. The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 2R. The area of the square is (diagonal^2)/2. So, ( (2R)^2 ) / 2 = (4R^2)/2 = 2R^2. So yes, that formula holds.\n\nTherefore, substituting R = 2^{1/8}, the area is 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2*(2^{1/4}) = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{"
