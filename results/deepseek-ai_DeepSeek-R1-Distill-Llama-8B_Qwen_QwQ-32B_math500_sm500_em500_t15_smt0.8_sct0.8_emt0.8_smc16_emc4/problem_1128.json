            "output": "First, I need to determine the speed of the robot. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. To find the speed in meters per second, I'll convert the time to seconds and the distance to meters.\n\n1 kilometer equals 1000 meters, and 2.5 hours is equal to 1500 seconds. So, the speed is 1000 meters divided by 1500 seconds, which simplifies to 2/3 meters per second.\n\nNext, I'll use the speed to calculate the length of the hallway. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway's length at a speed of 2/3 meters per second. Multiplying the speed by the time gives the length: (2/3) * 90 = 60 meters.\n\nTherefore, the hallway is 60 meters long.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow the steps below:\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Robot's Speed**\n\nThe robot travels **1 kilometer** in **2.5 hours**. \n\n- Convert kilometers to meters:  \n  \\( 1 \\) km \\( = 1000 \\) meters  \n- Convert hours to seconds:  \n  \\( 2.5 \\) hours \\( = 2.5 \\times 60 = 1500 \\) seconds  \n\n- Speed \\( (v) \\) can be calculated using the formula:  \n  \\[\n  v = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{1500 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ meters/second}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Hallway's Length**\n\nThe robot takes **90 seconds** to travel the hallway's length at the same speed.\n\n- Length of the hallway \\( (L) \\):  \n  \\[\n  L = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ s} = 60 \\text{ meters}\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe hallway is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) meters long."
