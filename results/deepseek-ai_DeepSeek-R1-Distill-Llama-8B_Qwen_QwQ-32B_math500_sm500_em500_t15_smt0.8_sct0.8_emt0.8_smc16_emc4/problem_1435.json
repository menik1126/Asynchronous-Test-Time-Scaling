            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem: I need to find how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) make \\( 2^{24} \\) a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, what does it mean for a number to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power? Well, a number \\( k \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists some integer \\( m \\) such that \\( k = m^n \\). So, in this case, we want \\( 2^{24} = m^n \\) for some integer \\( m \\) and \\( n > 1 \\).\n\nSo, we need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) where \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( m^n \\). That sounds like we need to find all possible exponents \\( n \\) such that when you divide 24 by \\( n \\), you get an integer. Because if \\( m = 2^k \\), then \\( (2^k)^n = 2^{kn} \\), right? So, \\( kn \\) has to equal 24. Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nWait, let me check that logic. If \\( 2^{24} = (2^k)^n \\), then yes, because \\( (2^k)^n = 2^{kn} \\), so \\( kn = 24 \\). Therefore, \\( n \\) must divide 24. So, the number of possible \\( n \\) is equal to the number of divisors of 24 greater than 1.\n\nAlright, so now I need to find all the divisors of 24 and then exclude 1 because \\( n > 1 \\). Let's list the divisors of 24. Starting from 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. So, these are all the divisors. But since \\( n > 1 \\), we exclude 1. That leaves us with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. That's 7 divisors.\n\nWait, hold on, the question is asking for positive"

            "output": " integers \\( n > 1 \\). So, is that it? Do we just count all the divisors of 24 except 1? Hmm, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.\n\nSo, let's double-check. The prime factorization of 24 is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\). The number of divisors is calculated by adding 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization and then multiplying them: \\( (3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\). So, there are 8 divisors, including 1. Excluding 1, we have 7. That seems right.\n\nBut let me think about it another way. Let's consider each divisor \\( n > 1 \\) and see if \\( 2^{24} \\) is indeed a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n\n- For \\( n = 2 \\), \\( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \\). So, yes, that's a perfect square.\n- For \\( n = 3 \\), \\( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 \\). That's a perfect cube.\n- For \\( n = 4 \\), \\( 2^{24} = (2^6)^4 \\). Perfect fourth power.\n- For \\( n = 6 \\), \\( 2^{24} = (2^4)^6 \\). Perfect sixth power.\n- For \\( n = 8 \\), \\( 2^{24} = (2^3)^8 \\). Perfect eighth power.\n- For \\( n = 12 \\), \\( 2^{24} = (2^2)^{12} \\). Perfect twelfth power.\n- For \\( n = 24 \\), \\( 2^{24} = (2^1)^{24} \\). Perfect twenty-fourth power.\n\nEach of these works. So, that gives us 7 values of \\( n \\). Therefore, I think the answer is 7.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The question says \"positive integers \\( n > 1 \\)\". So, does that include all the divisors of 24 greater than 1? Yes. I don't think I missed any because 1 is the only one excluded, and all other divisors are accounted for.\n\nIs there another way"

            "output": " this could be solved? Maybe by considering the exponents in the prime factorization. Since \\( 2^{24} \\) is just a power of 2, any exponent \\( n \\) must divide 24. So, the exponents \\( n \\) are the divisors of 24, excluding 1. Hence, it's the same conclusion: 7.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's list all possible \\( n \\) and confirm:\n\n- \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 24 / 2 = 12 \\), so yes.\n- \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 24 / 3 = 8 \\), which is an integer.\n- \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 24 / 4 = 6 \\), integer.\n- \\( n = 6 \\): \\( 24 / 6 = 4 \\), integer.\n- \\( n = 8 \\): \\( 24 / 8 = 3 \\), integer.\n- \\( n = 12 \\): \\( 24 / 12 = 2 \\), integer.\n- \\( n = 24 \\): \\( 24 / 24 = 1 \\), integer.\n\nSo, all of these \\( n \\) values satisfy that \\( m = 2^{24/n} \\) is an integer. Therefore, each \\( n \\) is valid.\n\nWait, are there any other \\( n \\) values beyond the divisors of 24 that could work? Hmm, let's think. If \\( n \\) doesn't divide 24, then \\( 24/n \\) isn't an integer, so \\( m = 2^{24/n} \\) wouldn't be an integer. For example, if \\( n = 5 \\), then \\( 24/5 = 4.8 \\), so \\( m = 2^{4.8} \\), which isn't an integer. Similarly, \\( n = 7 \\): \\( 24/7 \\approx 3.428 \\), so \\( m \\) is not an integer. Therefore, only the divisors of 24 work.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\)"
