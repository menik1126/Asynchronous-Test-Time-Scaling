            "output": "Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully:\n\n\"If we write √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3 in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c such that a, b, and c are positive integers and c is as small as possible, then what is a + b + c?\"\n\nOkay, so the goal is to combine all these terms into a single fraction where the denominator is a single integer c, and c is the smallest possible. The numerator will then be a combination of a√2 and b√3, where a and b are positive integers. Then, I need to find the sum of a, b, and c.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression again to have it clear:\n\n√2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3\n\nI notice that each of these terms is either a square root or its reciprocal. So, perhaps I can combine the terms with √2 and the terms with √3 separately. That makes sense because they are different radicals.\n\nSo, let's group them:\n\n(√2 + 1/√2) + (√3 + 1/√3)\n\nNow, I can handle each group individually.\n\nStarting with the first group: √2 + 1/√2. Hmm, maybe I can combine these into a single term. To do that, I need a common denominator. Let's see:\n\n√2 can be written as (√2 * √2)/√2, because multiplying numerator and denominator by √2 would give me 2/√2. Wait, that might be a way to get a common denominator.\n\nWait, actually, let me think about this differently. To add √2 and 1/√2, I can write both terms with the same denominator. The denominators are 1 and √2, so the common denominator would be √2.\n\nSo, √2 is equal to (√2 * √2)/√2, because √2 * √2 is 2, so that becomes 2/√2. Then, adding 1/√2 to that:\n\n2/√2 + 1/√2 = (2 + 1)/√2 = 3/√2\n\nWait, that seems off because √2 is approximately 1.414,"

            "output": " so 3/√2 is about 2.121. Let me verify:\n\n√2 ≈ 1.414\n1/√2 ≈ 0.707\nSo, adding them: 1.414 + 0.707 ≈ 2.121\n\n3/√2 ≈ 3 / 1.414 ≈ 2.121, so that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, 3/√2 can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by √2:\n\n(3/√2) * (√2/√2) = (3√2)/2\n\nSo, the first group simplifies to (3√2)/2.\n\nOkay, moving on to the second group: √3 + 1/√3.\n\nI can apply the same method here. Let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 1 and √3, so the common denominator is √3.\n\nSo, √3 is equal to (√3 * √3)/√3 = 3/√3. Then, adding 1/√3:\n\n3/√3 + 1/√3 = (3 + 1)/√3 = 4/√3\n\nAgain, let's verify with approximate values:\n\n√3 ≈ 1.732\n1/√3 ≈ 0.577\nAdding them: 1.732 + 0.577 ≈ 2.309\n\n4/√3 ≈ 4 / 1.732 ≈ 2.309, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let's rationalize 4/√3 by multiplying numerator and denominator by √3:\n\n(4/√3) * (√3/√3) = (4√3)/3\n\nSo, the second group simplifies to (4√3)/3.\n\nNow, putting it all back together, the original expression simplifies to:\n\n(3√2)/2 + (4√3)/3\n\nSo now, we have two fractions with different denominators: 2 and 3. To combine them, we need a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3 is 6. So, we can rewrite each fraction with denominator 6.\n\nFirst, (3√2)/2 can be written as (3√2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = (9√2)/6.\n\n"

            "output": "Second, (4√3)/3 can be written as (4√3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = (8√3)/6.\n\nSo now, adding the two fractions together:\n\n(9√2)/6 + (8√3)/6 = (9√2 + 8√3)/6\n\nSo, that's the combined form: (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nIn this expression, a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is supposed to be as small as possible. Here, c is 6. Let me verify if there's a way to make c smaller.\n\nLooking at the denominators, 2 and 3, their LCM is 6, so 6 is indeed the smallest possible common denominator. Therefore, we cannot have c smaller than 6 in this case.\n\nNow, let's identify a, b, and c from the expression:\n\n(9√2 + 8√3)/6\n\nSo, in the numerator, the coefficients of √2 and √3 are 9 and 8, respectively. Therefore, a = 9, b = 8, and c = 6.\n\nTo find a + b + c, we just add them together:\n\n9 + 8 + 6 = 23\n\nLet me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Grouped √2 and 1/√2 together, combined them to get 3/√2, which is 3√2/2. That seems correct.\n2. Similarly, grouped √3 and 1/√3, combined them to get 4/√3, which is 4√3/3. Also correct.\n3. Then, added the two fractions: 3√2/2 + 4√3/3. Found LCM of 2 and 3 is 6, so converted them to 9√2/6 + 8√3/6. That adds up to (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n4. Identified a=9, b=8, c=6. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(a + b + c\\) is \\boxed{23}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by grouping the terms involving \\"
