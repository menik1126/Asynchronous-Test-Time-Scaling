            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under a matrix M. The matrix M takes the vector [2, -1] to [9, 3] and [1, -3] to [7, -1]. Hmm, okay. I'm going to try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a matrix transforms a vector, it applies the matrix multiplication. So maybe if I figure out what matrix M is, I can then apply it to the entire line y = 2x + 1. Alternatively, I might be able to find the image without explicitly finding M, but I think starting with finding M makes sense.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nSo, when M acts on [2, -1], it should give [9, 3]. So, according to matrix multiplication, that means:\n\n[a  b] * [2] = [9]\n[c  d]   [-1]   [3]\n\nWhich gives me the system of equations:\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, when M acts on [1, -3], it gives [7, -1]. So:\n\n[a  b] * [1] = [7]\n[c  d]   [-3]   [-1]\n\nWhich gives:\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nNow, I can solve this system of equations to find a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me start with equations 1 and 3 to find a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nI can solve this using substitution or elimination. Let's go with elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3: 6a - 3b = 27\n\nNow add equation 3:\n\n6a - 3b + a - 3b ="

Alternatively, let me solve equation 3 for a: a = 7 + 3b, then plug into equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 3: a = 7 + 3b\n\nSubstitute into equation 1: 2*(7 + 3b) - b = 9\n\nCalculate: 14 + 6b - b = 9\nSo, 14 + 5b = 9\n5b = 9 -14 = -5\nb = -1\n\nThen, from equation 3: a = 7 + 3*(-1) = 7 -3 = 4\n\nSo, a=4 and b=-1\n\nNow for c and d. We have equations 2 and 4:\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d = 3\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nLet me solve for c from equation 4: c = -1 + 3d\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n2*(-1 + 3d) - d = 3\n-2 + 6d - d = 3\n-2 +5d =3\n5d=5\nd=1\n\nThen c = -1 +3*(1) = -1 +3=2\n\nSo c=2 and d=1.\n\nPutting it all together, matrix M is:\n\n[4  -1]\n[2   1]\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUsing M on [2, -1]:\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1) = 8 +1=9\n2*2 +1*(-1)=4 -1=3\nThat's correct.\n\nUsing M on [1, -3]:\n4*1 + (-1)*(-3)=4 +3=7\n2*1 +1*(-3)=2 -3=-1\nThat's also correct.\n\nOkay, so M is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M. Since applying M is a linear transformation, the image of a line will generally be another line or perhaps a point, but in this case, since the original line is in the plane, and M is a"

Since y = 2x +1 is a line, the image under M will also be a line.\n\nThere are a couple of approaches to find the image:\n\n1. Find the image of two points on the line y=2x+1 and then determine the equation of the line passing through these images.\n\n2. Express the line y=2x+1 in parametric form and then apply the transformation M to each point.\n\nLet me try the first approach. Choose two points on the line y=2x+1.\n\nLet me pick x=0: y=1, so point (0,1).\n\nAnd x=1: y=3, so point (1,3).\n\nNow, apply M to both points.\n\nFirst, point (0,1):\n\nUsing M:\nx' = 4*0 + (-1)*1 = 0 -1 = -1\ny' = 2*0 +1*1=0 +1=1\nSo image point is (-1,1)\n\nSecond, point (1,3):\n\nx' =4*1 + (-1)*3=4 -3=1\ny'=2*1 +1*3=2 +3=5\nImage point is (1,5)\n\nNow, these two points (-1,1) and (1,5) lie on the image line. Let me find the equation of the line passing through these two points.\n\nThe slope m is (5 -1)/(1 - (-1))=4/2=2.\n\nSo, m=2. Using point (-1,1):\n\ny -1 =2(x +1)\ny=2x +2 +1=2x +3\n\nSo, the equation is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the second approach to parametrize the original line.\n\nExpress the line y=2x+1 parametrically. Let me let x = t, then y=2t +1.\n\nSo, points can be written as (t, 2t +1).\n\nNow, apply M to each point:\n\nx' =4t + (-1)*(2t +1)=4t -2t -1="

But wait, let me check with another point to be sure.\n\nTake another point on the original line, say x=2, then y=5. So (2,5).\n\nApply M:\n\nx'=4*2 + (-1)*5=8 -5=3\n\ny'=2*2 +1*5=4 +5=9\n\nSo the image point is (3,9). Let's see if that lies on y=2x+3.\n\nPlug in x=3: y=2*3 +3=9. Yes, that works.\n\nAnother point: x=-1, then y=2*(-1)+1= -1. So (-1, -1).\n\nWait, no, original line is y=2x+1. If x=-1, then y=2*(-1)+1= -2+1= -1. So point (-1, -1).\n\nApply M:\n\nx'=4*(-1) + (-1)*(-1)= -4 +1= -3\n\ny'=2*(-1) +1*(-1)= -2 -1= -3\n\nSo image point (-3, -3). Let's see if that's on y=2x+3.\n\nPlug in x=-3: y=2*(-3)+3= -6 +3= -3.

So, the image of y=2x+1 should be another line.\n\nAnother approach is to express the line in vector form and apply the transformation.\n\nLet me parametrize the line as:\n\nr(t) = [t, 2t +1]^T, where t is a scalar parameter.\n\nThen, the transformed vector under M is M * r(t).\n\nSo,\n\nM * r(t) = [4  -1; 2   1] * [t; 2t +1] = [4t - (2t +1); 2t + (2t +1)] = [2t -1; 4t +1]\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.
