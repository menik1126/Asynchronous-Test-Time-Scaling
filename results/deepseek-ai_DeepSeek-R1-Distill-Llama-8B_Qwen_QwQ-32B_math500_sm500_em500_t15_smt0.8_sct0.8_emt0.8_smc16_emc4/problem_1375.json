            "output": "First, I recognize that the total number of students attending the math club meeting is 35.\n\nNext, I'll let the number of boys be represented by B and the number of girls by G.\n\nGiven that there are more girls than boys, I know that G is greater than B.\n\nAdditionally, the number of girls is a multiple of 13. So, G can be 13, 26, or 39. However, since there are only 35 students in total, G cannot be 39 because that would exceed the total number.\n\nNow, I'll consider the possible values for G:\n- If G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. However, this doesn't satisfy the condition that G > B because 22 is greater than 13.\n- If G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. Here, 26 is greater than 9, which satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- Number of boys = \\( B \\)\n- Number of girls = \\( G \\)\n\nSince \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys, possible values for \\( G \\) are:\n- \\( G = 13 \\) (since \\( 2 \\times 13 = 26 \\), which is less than 35)\n- \\( G = 26 \\) (since \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\), which is more than 35, so not possible)\n\n**Testing \\( G = 13 \\):**\n- \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\)\n- **Check:** \\( 22 > 13 \\) \u2192 \\( G > B \\) is **not** satisfied.\n\n**Testing \\( G = 26 \\):**\n- \\( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\)\n- **Check:** \\( 26 > 9 \\) \u2192 \\( G > B \\) is satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are **\\(\\boxed{9}\\)** boys at the meeting."
