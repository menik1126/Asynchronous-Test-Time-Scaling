It says there are 10 complex roots, which come in pairs like \\(r_1\\) and its conjugate \\(\\overline{r_1}\\), and so on up to \\(r_5\\) and \\(\\overline{r_5}\\). The problem is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the product of each root with its conjugate, that is, \\(\\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}}\\) for each i from 1 to 5, and then adding them up.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real number. So each term \\(\\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}}\\) is the reciprocal of the square of the modulus of \\(r_i\\). That might be useful.\n\nNext, looking at the given equation, it's a 10th-degree polynomial, which makes sense because it has 10 roots. The equation is a sum of two 10th powers. I wonder if I can factor it or find a substitution that simplifies it.\n\nLet me try to rewrite the equation. Let's set \\(y = 13x - 1\\). Then the equation becomes \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\), where \\(y = 13x - 1\\). Hmm, that's interesting. So the original equation can be thought of as \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\) with a linear relation between x and y.\n\nBut I don't know if that substitution helps directly. Maybe I can consider the polynomial equation and think about its roots in terms of their modulus. Since each term \\(\\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}}\\) is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\), I need to find the sum of these reciprocals squared moduli.\n\nSo perhaps I can find each \\(|r_i|^2\\) and then take the reciprocal and sum them.

So if I can find the product \\(r_i \\overline{r_i}\\), then take reciprocal, and sum over all i from 1 to 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way using Vieta's formula? Since the roots come in conjugate pairs, the polynomial must have real coefficients. Let me check that. The original equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Let's see, expanding \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) would give a polynomial with real coefficients, so when added to \\(x^{10}\\), the entire polynomial has real coefficients. Therefore, complex roots must come in conjugate pairs, which matches the problem's description.\n\nVieta's formula relates the sum and products of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. Since the problem is asking for a sum involving reciprocals of \\(r_i \\overline{r_i}\\), maybe I can relate this to the coefficients somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th roots of both sides, we can write \\(x = \\omega \\cdot ( -1)^{1/10} \\cdot (13x - 1)\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of unity. But this might complicate things because of the roots of unity. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's try to rearrange the equation first. Let me write the equation as:\n\n\\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\)\n\nTaking both sides to the power of 1/10, but since we are dealing with complex numbers, we have to consider all possible roots. So, the solutions are given by:\n\n\\(x = \\zeta \\cdot ( -1)^{1/10} \\cdot (13x - 1)\\), where \\(\\zeta\\) is a 10th root of unity.\n\nHmm, but maybe this approach is getting too involved.

Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is asking for the sum of 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) over i from 1 to 5. Since each pair of roots r_i and \\overline{r_i} contribute the same term, so the total sum is just 5 terms each being 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}), but since each pair is counted once, so actually, the total sum is indeed 5 terms. Wait, the problem lists 10 roots, but grouped into 5 conjugate pairs, so the sum is over each pair once, so 5 terms. So the question is to compute the sum of 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) for each pair.\n\nAlternatively, since r_i \\overline{r_i} is |r_i|^2, so the sum is the sum of 1/|r_i|^2 for each root, but since each pair contributes the same (because |r_i|^2 = |\\overline{r_i}|^2), so the total sum over all roots would be 2*(sum over 1/|r_i|^2 for each pair). Wait, but the problem is only summing over each pair once, so the question is just the sum over the 5 terms. So maybe the problem is equivalent to summing 1/|r_i|^2 for each of the 5 distinct roots (excluding their conjugates). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate this to the coefficients of the polynomial. Let me think of Vieta's formula. Since the polynomial is of degree 10, with roots r_1, \\overline{r_1}, ..., r_5, \\overline{r_5}. So the polynomial can be written as:\n\n\\(P(x) = (x - r_1)(x - \\overline{r_1})(x - r_2)(x - \\overline{r_2})...(x - r_5)(x - \\overline{r_5})\\).\n\nMultiplying each pair (x - r_i)(x - \\overline{r_i}) gives a quadratic with real coefficients:"

So the entire polynomial is a product of five such quadratics.\n\nSo, the constant term of the polynomial is the product of all |r_i|^2, so in Vieta's formula, the constant term is (-1)^10 times the product of all roots, but since each quadratic contributes |r_i|^2 as the constant term, the overall constant term is the product of |r_i|^2 for i=1 to 5. But wait, the given polynomial is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Let me check the constant term.\n\nExpanding (13x -1)^10 using the binomial theorem, the constant term is (-1)^10 = 1. Similarly, x^10 has a constant term of 1. So the given polynomial is x^{10} + (13x -1)^10, so the constant term is 1 + 1 = 2. But when we write the product of the five quadratics, each with constant term |r_i|^2, the overall constant term is the product of |r_1|^2 |r_2|^2 ... |r_5|^2. So Vieta tells us that this product is equal to 2.\n\nWait, that's a useful piece of information. So the product of |r_1|^2 |r_2|^2 ... |r_5|^2 is 2.\n\nHmm, but we need the sum of 1/|r_i|^2 for each i from 1 to 5. Hmm, I don't know if I can get the sum directly from the product, but maybe there's a connection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the sum of 1/|r_i|^2 by considering some transformation or reciprocal polynomial.\n\nWait, let me think about the original equation again: \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\).\n\nIf I set \\(y = 13x - 1\\), then the equation becomes \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\).

Therefore, the required sum is (sum over all roots of 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i})) / 2.\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nEach root r_i (and its conjugate) corresponds to a \u03c9 and \u03c9^{-1}, so each pair contributes two terms of 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) which are equal. Therefore, the total over all roots would be 2*(sum over the 5 terms). But the problem wants the sum over the 5 terms, so the required sum is (total over all roots)/2.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the total over all roots, then divide by 2, that would give the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the sum over all roots of 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) = sum over all roots of 1/|r_i|^2 = sum over all roots of |1 +13 \u03c9|^2, since 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) = |1 +13 \u03c9|^2 as above.\n\nWait, let me recap:\n\nEarlier, we found that for each root x = \u03c9/(1 +13 \u03c9), so |x|^2 = 1 / |1 +13 \u03c9|^2, so 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) = |1 +13 \u03c9|^2. Therefore, the sum over all roots of 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) is the sum over all 10 roots of |1 +13 \u03c9|^2. Since each pair (\u03c9 and \u03c9^{-1}) contribute the same value, so the total sum is 2*(sum over 5 terms). Therefore, the required sum (over 5 terms) is (total sum)/2.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the total sum over all 10 roots of |1 +13 \u03c9|^2, then divide by 2, that would be the answer.\n\nSo, let's compute the total sum over all 10th roots of unity \u03c9 of |1 +13 \u03c9|^2.\n\n"
