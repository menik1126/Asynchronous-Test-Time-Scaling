            "output": "To determine when both gears will have their marks pointing due north again, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods.\n\nFirst, I'll convert the gears' rotation rates from per minute to per second by multiplying by 60 seconds per minute.\n\nGear 1 rotates 33\u202f1/3 times per minute, which is 33\u202f1/3 * 60 = 2000 seconds.\n\nGear 2 rotates 45 times per minute, which is 45 * 60 = 2700 seconds.\n\nNext, I'll express these rotation periods as whole numbers by eliminating the fractions. Since 33\u202f1/3 is equivalent to 100/3, multiplying both sides by 3 gives Gear 1's period as 1000 seconds.\n\nNow, both Gear 1 and Gear 2 have whole number rotation periods: 1000 seconds and 2700 seconds, respectively.\n\nTo find when both gears align again, I'll calculate the LCM of 1000 and 2700. \n\nFirst, I'll factorize each number:\n- 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3\n- 2700 = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present:\n- LCM = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3 = 8 * 27 * 125 = 27000 seconds.\n\nFinally, I'll convert 27000 seconds back to minutes by dividing by 60, which gives 450 minutes.\n\nThus, after 450 minutes, both gears will align their marks pointing due north.\n</think>\n\nTo determine when both gears will align their marks pointing **due north** again, we need to find the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of their rotation periods. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Convert Rotation Rates to Seconds per Minute:**\n   \n   - **Gear 1:** Rotates \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) times per minute.\n     \\[\n     33\\frac{1}{3} \\times 60 = 2000 \\text{ seconds per full rotation}\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Gear 2:** Rotates \\( 45 \\) times per minute.\n     \\[\n     45 \\times 60 = 2700 \\text{ seconds per full rotation}\n"
