The terms alternate between positive and negative.\n\nThere are 100 terms in total, which means there are 50 pairs of two consecutive terms.\n\nEach pair has the form \\((2k - 1) - 2k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 1 to 50.\n\nSimplifying each pair: \\((2k - 1) - 2k = -1\\).\n\nSince all pairs simplify to \\(-1\\), the total sum is \\(50 \\times (-1) = -50\\).\n</think>\n\nTo compute the sum \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Series Pattern:**\n   \n   The series alternates between positive and negative terms:\n   \\[\n   1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Group the Terms into Pairs:**\n   \n   There are 100 terms in total, so we can group them into 50 pairs:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify Each Pair:**\n   \n   Each pair has the form \\((2k - 1) - 2k\\) where \\(k\\) is an integer from 1 to 50:\n   \\[\n   (2k - 1) - 2k = -1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Calculate the Total Sum:**\n   \n   Since each of the 50 pairs equals \\(-1\\), the total sum is:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times (-1) = -50\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{-50}\n   \\]"
