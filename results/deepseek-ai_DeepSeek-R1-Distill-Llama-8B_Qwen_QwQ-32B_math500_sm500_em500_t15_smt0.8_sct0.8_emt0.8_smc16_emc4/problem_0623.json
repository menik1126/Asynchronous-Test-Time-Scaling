I know that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98.\n\nNext, I'll factorize 98. It's also even, so I divide by 2 again to get 49.\n\nNow, 49 is a perfect square. It can be divided by 7, giving me 7 twice. So, the prime factors of 196 are 2² × 7².\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, if a number N has a prime factorization of \\( p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\), then the number of divisors is \\( (a+1)(b+1) \\). Applying this to 196, the number of divisors is \\( (2+1)(2+1) = 9 \\).\n</think>\n\n**Question:** How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo find the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of 196.**\n   \n   - **196 ÷ 2 = 98**  \n   - **98 ÷ 2 = 49**  \n   - **49 ÷ 7 = 7**  \n   - **7 ÷ 7 = 1**\n\n   So, 196 can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the formula for finding the number of divisors.**\n   \n   If a number \\( N \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\dots \\times p_n^{k} \\), then the number of positive divisors of \\( N \\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + 1)(b + 1)(k + 1)\\dots\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Apply the formula to 196.**\n   \n   Given \\( 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\), the exponents are \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).\n   \n   Plugging into the formula:\n  "
