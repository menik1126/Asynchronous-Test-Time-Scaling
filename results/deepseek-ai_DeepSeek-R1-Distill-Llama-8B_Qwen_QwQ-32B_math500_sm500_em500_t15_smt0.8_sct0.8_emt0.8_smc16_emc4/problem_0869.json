I can write \u221a2 as (2)/\u221a2, which allows me to combine these two terms.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for \u221a3 and its reciprocal. Repeating the process, \u221a3 becomes (3)/\u221a3, and I can combine these terms as well.\n\nAfter combining both pairs, the expression simplifies to (2 + 3)/\u221a2 + (3 + 2)/\u221a3. This simplifies further to 5/\u221a2 + 5/\u221a3.\n\nTo rationalize the denominators, I'll multiply each term by \u221a2 and \u221a3 respectively. This results in (5\u221a2)/2 + (5\u221a3)/2.\n\nFinally, I'll factor out the common denominator of 2 to express the entire sum as (5\u221a2 + 5\u221a3)/2. Here, the smallest possible value for c is 2.\n\nAdding the values of a, b, and c gives 5 + 5 + 2, which totals 12.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's carefully combine the terms and simplify step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Combine Like Terms for \u221a2 and \u221a3**\n\nFirst, group the terms containing \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) separately:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) + \\left( \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify Each Group**\n\nFor the \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) terms, we can write \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) as \\(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2 + 1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3"
