            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side. Since the table is square, there are rotational symmetries, meaning some arrangements are considered the same if one can be rotated to look like another.\n\nI'll start by fixing one person at a specific seat to eliminate rotational duplicates. Once one person is fixed, I have 7 remaining people to arrange around the table.\n\nNext, I need to account for reflections. If I fix one person, reflections will still create equivalent arrangements. To handle this, I'll divide the total number of arrangements by 2 to eliminate mirrored duplicates.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the factorial of the remaining 7 people, which gives me the number of unique seating arrangements after considering both rotations and reflections.\n\nSo, the number of distinct ways to seat the 8 people around the square table is 7 factorial, which equals 5040.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways 8 people can be seated around a square table with **2 people on each side** (with rotational equivalence considered), follow these steps:\n\n### **Step 1: Fix One Person's Position**\nTo eliminate rotational duplicates, fix one person at a specific seat. This action effectively reduces the problem to arranging the remaining **7 people** around the table.\n\n### **Step 2: Arrange the Remaining People**\nOnce one person is fixed, the remaining **7 people** can be arranged in **7!** ways.\n\n### **Step 3: Account for Reflections**\nIf we don't fix another person's position, reflections (\u955c\u50cf\u5bf9\u79f0) could lead to duplicate arrangements. However, since we've already fixed one person, reflections result in equivalent arrangements. Thus, no further division is needed here.\n\n### **Final Calculation**\n\\[\n7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\n\\]\n\n### **Answer**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5040}\n\\]"
