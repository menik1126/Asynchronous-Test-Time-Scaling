A number \\( A \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists some integer \\( k \\) such that \\( A = k^n \\).\n\nGiven \\( 2^{24} \\), I need to express it as \\( k^n \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer greater than 1. This means that both the base and the exponent \\( n \\) must satisfy the condition \\( k^n = 2^{24} \\).\n\nTo find the possible values of \\( n \\), I'll examine the prime factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\), which is already given as \\( 2^{24} \\). Since all the exponents in the prime factorization are the same, the number is a perfect power. The possible values of \\( n \\) are the divisors of 24, excluding 1 because \\( n > 1 \\).\n\nThe divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. By excluding 1, the valid exponents are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Counting these gives me 7 possible values for \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 7 positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   We need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that there exists an integer \\( k \\) where \\( k^n = 2^{24} \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   The number \\( 2^{24} \\) is already expressed in its prime factorized form:\n   \\[\n   2^{24} = (2)^{24}\n   \\]\n   This means"
