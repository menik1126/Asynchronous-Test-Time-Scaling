Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\). I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying the arguments. So, maybe I can use that property here. Let me write that down.\n\nUsing the logarithm addition rule:\n\\[\n\\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (a \\cdot c)\n\\]\nSo applying that to the first equation:\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\nAlright, that simplifies to \\(\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\\). Now, the expression inside the logarithm is a difference of squares, which is \\(x^2 - y^2\\). So that becomes:\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\n\\]\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) is equivalent to \\(b^c = a\\). Applying that here, the base is 6, and the exponent is 2, so:\n\\[\n6^2 = x^2 - y^2\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n36 = x^2 - y^2\n\\]\nOkay, so that's one equation involving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\). Similarly, I can rewrite this logarithmic equation in exponential form. Remembering that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) is equivalent to \\(b^c = a\\), so here:\n\\[\ny^2 = 5x\n\\]\nSo now I have two equations:\n1. \\(36 = x^2 - y^2\\)\n2. \\("

            "output": "y^2 = 5x\\)\n\nHmm, so maybe I can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for \\(x\\). Let's try that.\n\nFrom the second equation, \\(y^2 = 5x\\). So, I can replace \\(y^2\\) in the first equation with \\(5x\\). Let's do that:\n\n\\(36 = x^2 - 5x\\)\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of \\(x\\). Let me write it as:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\n\\]\nSo, \\(x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\\). To solve this quadratic equation, I can try factoring it, but I'm not sure if it factors nicely. Let me check.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's think. Factors of 36 are 1&36, 2&18, 3&12, 4&9, 6&6.\n\nTrying 6 and -6: 6 * (-6) = -36, and 6 + (-6) = 0. Not quite -5.\n\nHow about 9 and -4: 9 * (-4) = -36, and 9 + (-4) = 5. But I need them to add up to -5, so maybe -9 and 4: -9 * 4 = -36, and -9 + 4 = -5. Perfect.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as:\n\\[\n(x - 9)(x + 4) = 0\n\\]\nTherefore, the solutions are \\(x = 9\\) or \\(x = -4\\).\n\nBut wait a second, I need to check if these solutions work in the original equations because logarithms have domain restrictions. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, \\(x = 9\\). Let's plug this back into the second equation \\(y^2 = 5x\\), so \\(y^2 = 5*9 = 45\\). So, \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\). Simplifying, \\(\\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5}\\), so \\(y = 3\\sqrt{5}\\) or \\(y = -3\\"

So:\n\n\\(x - y = 9 - 3\\sqrt{5}\\), and \\(x + y = 9 + 3\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nWe need to check if both \\(x - y\\) and \\(x + y\\) are positive because logarithms are defined only for positive numbers.\n\nCompute \\(9 - 3\\sqrt{5}\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{5} \u2248 2.236, so 3*2.236 \u2248 6.708\\). So, \\(9 - 6.708 \u2248 2.292\\), which is positive.\n\nSimilarly, \\(9 + 3\\sqrt{5} \u2248 9 + 6.708 \u2248 15.708\\), which is also positive. So, this is valid.\n\nNow, let's check \\(x = 9\\) and \\(y = -3\\sqrt{5}\\). Then:\n\n\\(x - y = 9 - (-3\\sqrt{5}) = 9 + 3\\sqrt{5}\\), which is positive, and \\(x + y = 9 + (-3\\sqrt{5}) = 9 - 3\\sqrt{5}\\), which is still positive as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, both possibilities for \\(y\\) when \\(x = 9\\) are valid.\n\nNow, let's check \\(x = -4\\). Plugging into the second equation: \\(y^2 = 5*(-4) = -20\\). Wait, \\(y^2\\) can't be negative because any real number squared is non-negative. So, \\(y^2 = -20\\) doesn't have a real solution. Therefore, \\(x = -4\\) is invalid in the context of real numbers because that would make the logarithm undefined.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\(x = 9\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2"

Correct.\n\nSubstituting \\(y^2 = 5x\\) into the first equation: \\(x^2 - 5x = 36\\). So, \\(x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\\). Factored as \\((x - 9)(x + 4) = 0\\). So, \\(x = 9\\) or \\(x = -4\\). Correct.\n\nChecked \\(x = 9\\), both positive \\(y\\) and negative \\(y\\) are valid, but \\(x = -4\\) gives \\(y^2 = -20\\), which is invalid.\n\nSo, yeah, \\(x = 9\\) is the only solution.\n\nJust to make sure, let me plug \\(x = 9\\) back into the original logarithmic equations.\n\nFirst equation: Let's say \\(y = 3\\sqrt{5}\\), so:\n\n\\(\\log_6 (9 - 3\\sqrt{5}) + \\log_6 (9 + 3\\sqrt{5})\\).\n\nWe know from earlier that \\( (9 - 3\\sqrt{5})(9 + 3\\sqrt{5}) = 81 - (3\\sqrt{5})^2 = 81 - 9*5 = 81 - 45 = 36 \\).
