This gives me \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nSince \\(9\\) is equal to \\(3^2\\), the equation becomes \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nFinally, I'll set the exponents equal to each other because the bases are the same. Therefore, \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   So, the equation is now:\n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
