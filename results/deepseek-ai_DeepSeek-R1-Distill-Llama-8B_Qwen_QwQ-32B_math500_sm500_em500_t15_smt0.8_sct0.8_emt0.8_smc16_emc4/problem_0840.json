Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I notice that the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\). Since both \\(x^4\\) and \\(y^4\\) are always non-negative for real numbers, the denominator will always be at least 6. That means the denominator is going to be 6 or larger, which affects the overall value of the fraction.\n\nThe numerator is \\(x - y\\). That can be positive or negative depending on the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So, the fraction can be positive or negative. Since we're looking for the maximum value, I think we should focus on when the numerator is positive because a positive value can be larger than negative ones.\n\nMaybe I can approach this by setting up some kind of substitution or using calculus. Let me think about calculus because I remember that's a way to find maxima and minima. To use calculus, I might need to use partial derivatives with respect to both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and set them equal to zero to find critical points.\n\nLet's define the function as \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). To find its critical points, I need to compute the partial derivatives \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\), set them equal to zero, and solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nStarting with the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\). Using the quotient rule, the derivative of the numerator is 1, and the derivative of the denominator is \\(4x^3\\). So,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{(-"

The derivative of the numerator with respect to \\(y\\) is -1, and the derivative of the denominator with respect to \\(y\\) is \\(4y^3\\). So, yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, to find the critical points, both partial derivatives must be zero. That means the numerators of both derivatives must be zero (since the denominators are always positive, as the denominator is squared and we know it's at least 6).\n\nSo, set the numerators equal to zero:\n\n1. \\(1 \\cdot (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y) \\cdot 4x^3 = 0\\)\n2. \\(-1 \\cdot (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y) \\cdot 4y^3 = 0\\)\n\nLet me write these out:\n\nEquation (1): \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6 - 4x^3(x - y) = 0\\)\n\nEquation (2): \\(- (x^4 + y^4 + 6) -4y^3(x - y) = 0\\)\n\nHmm, okay, let's try to simplify these equations.\n\nStarting with Equation (1):\n\n\\(x^4 + y^4 + 6 - 4x^3x + 4x^3y = 0\\)\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n\\(x^4 + y^4 + 6 - 4x^4 + 4x^3y = 0\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(-3x^4 + y^4 + 4x^3y + 6 = 0\\)\n\nSimilarly, Equation (2):\n\n\\(-x^4 - y^4 -6 -4y^3x + 4y^4 = 0\\)\n\nWait, let me make sure I distributed the negative sign correctly.\n\nWait, Equation (2) is:\n\n\\(- (x^4 + y^4 + 6) -4y^3(x - y) = 0\\)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n\\(-x^4 - y^4 -"
