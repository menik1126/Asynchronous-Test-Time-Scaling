Breaking it down, 160 can be expressed as \\( 2^5 \\times 5 \\).\n\nNext, I'll examine the numerator, 57. Factoring 57 reveals that it is the product of 3 and 19, neither of which are prime factors of the denominator.\n\nSince the denominator has only prime factors of 2 and 5, I can conclude that \\( \\frac{57}{160} \\) can be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n\nFinally, to find the decimal representation, I'll divide 57 by 160. Performing the division gives me 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize the Denominator**:\n   - The denominator is 160. Let's find its prime factors.\n   \\[\n   160 = 2 \\times 80 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 40 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 20 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 10 = 2^5 \\times 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Check for Common Factors**:\n   - The numerator is 57. Let's factorize 57.\n   \\[\n   57 = 3 \\times 19\n   \\]\n   - Neither 3 nor 19 are factors of the denominator (2^5 \u00d7 5). This means the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Determine if the Decimal Terminates**:\n   - A fraction terminates if the denominator has only 2s and/or 5s as prime factors. In this case, the denominator is \\(2^5 \\times 5\\), so the decimal will terminate.\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n   \\]\n\n\\(\\boxed{0.35625}\\)"
