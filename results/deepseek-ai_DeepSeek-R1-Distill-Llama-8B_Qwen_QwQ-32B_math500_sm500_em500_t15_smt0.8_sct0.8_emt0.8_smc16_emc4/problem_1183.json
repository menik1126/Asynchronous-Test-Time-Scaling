The area is expressed in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are relatively prime. Then I have to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what kind of polygon this is. Since it's a quartic equation, there are four solutions (vertices), so it must be a quadrilateral. The problem says it's convex, so it's a convex quadrilateral.\n\nI remember that sometimes higher-degree polynomials can be factored into quadratics or even linear terms. Maybe I can factor this equation to find the roots.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). Hmm, the coefficients involve \\( i \\), which might hint that the roots are related to complex numbers in some rotational symmetry.\n\nWait, the coefficients look similar to the expansion of a binomial. Let me see: \\( (z + i)^4 \\). Let's compute that to check.\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 \\).\n\nSimplify that: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2(-1) + 4zi(-i) + 1 \\).\n\nWhich becomes: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi +1 \\).\n\nHmm, comparing that to the given equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i =0 \\).\n\nThe given equation is similar but instead of +1, it has -i. So, not exactly \\( (z + i)^4 \\), but perhaps related.\n\nLet me write the given equation as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\). Wait, because \\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi"

So, to find the solutions, we need to compute the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), then subtract \\( i \\) from each root.\n\nSo, let me find the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\). To do that, I'll first express \\( 1 + i \\) in polar form. The complex number \\( 1 + i \\) has a magnitude of \\( \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\) and an angle (argument) of \\( \\pi/4 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) \\).\n\nTo find the fourth roots, we take the fourth root of the magnitude and divide the angle by 4. So, each root will have a magnitude of \\( (\\sqrt{2})^{1/4} = (2^{1/2})^{1/4} = 2^{1/8} \\).\n\nThe angles will be \\( \\frac{\\pi/4 + 2\\pi k}{4} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\).\n\nSo, the four fourth roots are:\n\n\\( 2^{1/8} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi/16 + \\pi k/2} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi/16 + \\pi k/2} \\right) \\) for \\( k=0,1,2,3 \\).\n\nLet me compute each root.\n\nFor \\( k=0 \\):\n- Angle: \\( \\pi/16 \\)\n- Root: \\( 2^{1/8} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{16} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\right) \\)\n\nFor \\( k=1 \\):\n- Angle: \\( \\pi/16 + \\pi/2 = 9\\pi/16 \\)\n- Root: \\( 2^{1/8} \\left( \\cos \\frac{9"

Now, since \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\), each root \\( z \\) is the fourth root of \\( 1 + i \\) minus \\( i \\).\n\nTherefore, the solutions \\( z \\) are:\n\n\\( z = 2^{1/8} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{16} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\right) - i \\)\nSimilarly for each \\( k \\).\n\nSo, let's write each solution as \\( z = x + yi \\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are real numbers.\n\nStarting with \\( k=0 \\):\n\n\\( z_0 = 2^{1/8} \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{16} + 2^{1/8} i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{16} - i \\)\n\\( = 2^{1/8} \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{16} + i \\left( 2^{1/8} \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{16} - 1 \\right) \\)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can think of the roots as points in the complex plane, each at a certain distance from the origin, rotated by certain angles, then shifted by subtracting \\( i \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtracting \\( i \\) just translates each root down by 1 unit in the imaginary direction.\n\nSo, the four roots are each on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\"

So, the four roots are located on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), each separated by \\( \\pi/2 \\) radians (since \\( \\pi/16 \\) times 4 gives \\( \\pi/4 \\), but wait, actually the spacing is \\( \\pi/2 \\) because each subsequent root is at \\( \\pi/16, 9\\pi/16, 17\\pi/16, 25\\pi/16 \\), which is 2\\pi/16 each step, so each is separated by \\( 2\\pi/16 = \\pi/8 \\). Wait, no, 9\\pi/16 - \\pi/16 = 8\\pi/16 = \\pi/2. Similarly, 17\\pi/16 - 9\\pi/16 = 8\\pi/16 = \\pi/2. So, the four roots are equally spaced around the circle, each separated by \\( \\pi/2 \\) radians. So, they form a square on the circle, each at 90-degree intervals.\n\nWait, hold on, the angle between them is \\( \\pi/2 \\), so yes, equally spaced. So, the four points form a square inscribed in a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\).\n\nBut then, subtracting \\( i \\) translates each point down by 1 unit in the imaginary direction. So, that will shift the center from origin to somewhere. Wait, but the original points were on a circle centered at origin, and then subtracting \\( i \\) shifts them all down by 1 unit, so their centers shift.\n\nWait, is the polygon still a square? Or does the shift affect the polygon's shape?\n\nYes, the shift will translate each vertex, but since all vertices are shifted equally, the shape remains congruent, just moved. So, it's still a square, just translated.\n\nTherefore, the area of the polygon (which is now a square) is the area of a square with side length equal to the distance between adjacent vertices on the circle,"

However, the distance between the vertices might change?\n\nWait, no, actually, the distance between two adjacent vertices on the original circle (before shifting) is the side length of the square. Since the original square is inscribed in a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), the side length of the square is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times \\text{radius} \\times 2 \\sin(\\pi/4) \\). Wait, let me recall that for a square inscribed in a circle of radius r, the side length is \\( s = \\sqrt{2} r \\times 2 \\sin(\\pi/4) \\). Wait, actually, the side length can be found by the chord length between two points separated by angle \\( \\pi/2 \\).\n\nThe chord length between two points on a circle of radius r separated by angle \u03b8 is \\( 2r \\sin(\\theta/2) \\). So here, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, so chord length is \\( 2r \\sin(\\pi/4) = 2r \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = r \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the original square had side length \\( 2^{1/8} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/8} \\times 2^{1/2} = 2^{5/8} \\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the original square would be \\( (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nBut after shifting all points down by 1 unit, the square is translated, so its area remains the same. Wait, but is that true?\n\nWait, actually, translation doesn't change the area. So, the area of the polygon (the square) is the same as the original square before shifting. Therefore, the area is \\( 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nBut hold on, the problem states that the solutions are the vertices of a convex polygon. If the original square was centered at the origin, then shifting it down by 1 unit would move the center to (0, -1). But does this affect the side length?\n\nWait, the chord length"
