Then, I have to find the sum of each of these polynomials evaluated at 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the polynomial again to make sure I have it right: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Hmm, I notice that the polynomial has terms with exponents 8, 4, and 0 (since it's a constant term). There are no terms with exponents in between, which might suggest that it can be expressed as a composition of lower-degree polynomials. Maybe something like \\( (x^4 + ax^2 + b)^2 \\) or similar?\n\nWait, but if I try squaring a quadratic, let's see: \\( (x^4 + ax^2 + b)^2 = x^8 + 2ax^6 + (a^2 + 2b)x^4 + 2abx^2 + b^2 \\). Comparing this to our original polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\), we can see that unless the coefficients for \\( x^6 \\) and \\( x^2 \\) are zero, it won't match. So, setting \\( 2a = 0 \\) implies \\( a = 0 \\). Then, the \\( x^4 \\) term becomes \\( a^2 + 2b = 3 \\). Since \\( a = 0 \\), we have \\( 2b = 3 \\), so \\( b = 3/2 \\). But \\( b \\) has to be an integer because we need integer coefficients. Hmm, that doesn't work. So maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it factors into two quartic polynomials? Let me try that. Suppose \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)(x^4 + ex^3 + fx^2 + gx + h) \\). Since both factors are quartic and monic, the coefficients of \\("

Now, let's compare the coefficients.\n\nMultiplying out the right-hand side:\n\n\\( x^4 * x^4 = x^8 \\)\n\nThen, the coefficient for \\( x^7 \\) is \\( a + e \\). But in the original polynomial, there's no \\( x^7 \\) term, so \\( a + e = 0 \\).\n\nSimilarly, the \\( x^6 \\) term is \\( ae + af + b + f \\). Again, original has no \\( x^6 \\), so that's 0.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated because having quartic polynomials would mean a lot of terms to equate. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe it's a biquadratic polynomial, meaning it can be expressed in terms of \\( y = x^4 \\). Let me try substituting \\( y = x^4 \\). Then, the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Now, that's a quadratic in \\( y \\), which might be easier to factor.\n\nLet's factor \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Those numbers are 4 and -1, so it factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), we get \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nSo, \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). Now, each of these quartic polynomials can potentially be factored further, so let me check if they can be broken down into polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\). I remember that this is a difference of squares: \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 \\), which factors as \\( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Then, each \\( x^2 - 1 \\) can be factored further into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) \\). So, altogether, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x"

So that's as far as we can go for that part.\n\nNow, the other factor is \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm, this looks like a sum of squares, but \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can actually be factored using the sum of squares formula. Wait, the sum of squares formula is \\( a^2 + b^2 \\), which doesn't factor over integers, but maybe there's another way here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a biquadratic that can be factored as a product of quadratics?\n\nLet me try to factor \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Let me see if it can be written as \\( (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) \\). Multiplying these gives \\( x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd \\). Comparing to \\( x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4 \\), so we have the equations:\n\n1. \\( a + c = 0 \\)\n2. \\( ac + b + d = 0 \\)\n3. \\( ad + bc = 0 \\)\n4. \\( bd = 4 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1, \\( c = -a \\). Substitute into equation 2:\n\n\\( a*(-a) + b + d = -a^2 + b + d = 0 \\Rightarrow b + d = a^2 \\)\n\nEquation 3: \\( a*d + b*(-a) = a(d - b) = 0 \\). So either a = 0 or d = b.\n\nIf a = 0, then c = 0, and equation 2 becomes b + d = 0, but equation 4 is b*d = 4. So then b and d are roots of t^2 - (b + d)t + b*d = t^2 + 0t +4 = t^2 +4, which would mean complex roots, so that's not possible with integers."
