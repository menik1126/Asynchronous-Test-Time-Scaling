First, I should probably try to simplify the equation or make it easier to handle.\n\nLooking at the equation, I see 3^{2x} and 10^x. Wait, 3^{2x} can be rewritten because when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you can multiply them. So, 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, which is 9^x. That's helpful because now both terms on the left side are in terms of x raised to some power. So the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x.\n\nHmm, okay, so now it's 9^x + 19 = 10^x. I need to solve for x here. I don't remember a formula that directly solves equations like this, so maybe I need to use logarithms or graphing. Let me consider if there's a substitution I can make.\n\nMaybe I can let y = 9^x. Then, since 10^x is the other term, and I know that 10^x can be written as (10/9)^x * 9^x. Because (10/9)^x * 9^x = (10^x). So if I let y = 9^x, then 10^x = (10/9)^x * y. Hmm, but that might complicate things more. Let me try that substitution.\n\nSo substituting y = 9^x, the equation becomes y + 19 = (10/9)^x * y. Wait, that simplifies to y + 19 = y*(10/9)^x. Hmm, but now I have y on both sides. Maybe I can rearrange this. Let me subtract y from both sides: 19 = y*( (10/9)^x - 1 ). So, 19 = y*( (10/9)^x - 1 ). Hmm, but I still have two variables here: y and x. So I'm not sure if this substitution is helpful.\n\nLet me think differently. Since the equation is 9^x + 19 = 10^"

Maybe this difference can be expressed as a function and I can see where it equals 19.\n\nLet me define f(x) = 10^x - 9^x. Then the equation is f(x) = 19. To solve this, maybe I can try plugging in integer values for x to see if I can find a solution.\n\nLet's test x = 2. Then 10^2 = 100, 9^2=81, so f(2) = 100 -81 = 19. Oh! That's exactly the value we need. So x=2 is a solution. Wait, but is that the only solution?\n\nWait, maybe check x=1: f(1) =10 -9=1 which is less than 19. x=2 gives exactly 19. Let me check x=3: 10^3 -9^3 = 1000 -729=271 which is way more than 19. Hmm. What about x=0: f(0)=1 -1=0. So between x=0 and 1, it goes from 0 to 1, which is still below 19. x=2 jumps up to 19. Then x beyond 2 increases rapidly.\n\nWait, but could there be another solution when x is negative? Let me check x=-1. f(-1) = 10^{-1} -9^{-1} = 0.1 - 0.111... \u2248 -0.011..., which is negative. So negative x's give negative values, so not 19. So the only integer solution is x=2. But maybe there are non-integer solutions?\n\nWait, let's check between x=1 and x=2. Let's pick x=1.5. Then 10^1.5 is 10^(3/2)=sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)\u224831.62. Similarly, 9^1.5=9^(3"

            "output": "/2)=sqrt(729)=27. So f(1.5)\u224831.62 -27\u22484.62, which is still less than 19. So as x goes from 1 to 2, f(x) goes from 1 to 19, increasing. So it's a continuous function, right?\n\nTherefore, by the intermediate value theorem, there's only one solution where f(x)=19, which is x=2. Wait, but that seems to contradict my initial thought that maybe there's another solution somewhere else. Hmm, but according to the function, it's increasing from x=0 onwards, since both 10^x and 9^x are increasing, but 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so the difference 10^x -9^x is always increasing, never decreasing. Therefore, f(x)=19 will have exactly one solution. So x=2 is the only solution.\n\nWait, but let me test x=1. Let me choose x=0.5. Then 10^0.5 is about 3.16, and 9^0.5 is 3. So f(0.5)=3.16 -3=0.16. Still less than 19. So at x=2, it's 19, and for x>2, it's even larger. So indeed, x=2 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take logarithms on both sides, but the equation isn't straightforward because it's 10^x -9^x=19. It's a nonlinear equation, so taking logarithms directly won't help. But maybe I can manipulate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as 10^x =9^x +19. Then, perhaps I can divide both sides by 9^x to make it in terms of (10/9)^x.\n\nSo, 10^x /9^x =1 + 19/9^x. The left side is (10/9)^x, and the right side is 1 +19/(9^x). Let me denote z = (10/9)^x, then we have z =1 +19/(9^x). But 9^x is (9/10)^x *10^x. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, express 9^x in terms"

But 9^x = (10/9)^{-x} *10^x? Not sure. Alternatively, since z = (10/9)^x, then 9^x =10^x / z. So substituting into 19/(9^x) gives 19*z/(10^x). Hmm, but 10^x is z*9^x, so this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this substitution isn't the way to go. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since we found that x=2 works, maybe that's the only solution. Let me check if there's another solution for x less than 2. Wait, when x approaches negative infinity, 10^x and 9^x both approach zero, so the difference approaches zero. So the function f(x)=10^x -9^x is always increasing, so it can only cross 19 once. Therefore, x=2 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the derivative to see if the function is always increasing. Let me consider f(x)=10^x -9^x. The derivative f\u2019(x)=ln(10)*10^x - ln(9)*9^x. Since ln(10) > ln(9), and 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so for x sufficiently large, the derivative is positive. But even for x=0, f\u2019(0)=ln(10) - ln(9) which is positive. So the function is always increasing. Therefore, there is only one solution where f(x)=19, which is at x=2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x=2. Let me confirm by plugging back into the original equation:\n\n3^{2x} +19 = 10^x. If x=2, then 3^4 +19 = 81 +19 =100. And 10^2 is 100. So yes, that works"
