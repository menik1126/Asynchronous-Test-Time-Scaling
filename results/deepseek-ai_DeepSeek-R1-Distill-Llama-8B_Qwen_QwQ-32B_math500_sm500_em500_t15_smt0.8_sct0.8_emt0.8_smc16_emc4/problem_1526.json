The sequence is \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\), and I'm given that the sum of the numbers is 96, the sum of their squares is 144, and the sum of their cubes is 216. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with sums of powers like this, there's something called the Power Mean Inequality. It relates the different means of a set of numbers. Maybe that could help here. The Power Mean Inequality states that for positive real numbers, the mean of the cubes is greater than or equal to the square of the mean, which in turn is greater than or equal to the mean. So, if I can find the means, maybe I can get some constraints on \\( n \\).\n\nLet me define the arithmetic mean (AM), the quadratic mean (QM), and the cubic mean (CM) of the sequence. \n\nThe arithmetic mean is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{AM} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i}{n} = \\frac{96}{n}\n\\]\n\nThe quadratic mean is:\n\\[\n\\text{QM} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{144}{n}}\n\\]\n\nAnd the cubic mean is:\n\\[\n\\text{CM} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3}{n}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{216}{n}}\n\\]\n\nAccording to the Power Mean Inequality, we have:\n\\[\n\\text{AM} \\leq \\text{QM} \\leq \\text{CM}\n\\]\nSo plugging in the expressions:\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{n} \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{144}{n}} \\leq \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{216}{n}}\n\\]\nHmm, that gives me two inequalities. I can solve both separately to find constraints on \\( n \\).\n\nLet me first work on the left inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{n}"

Or are there more possibilities?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about if all the inequalities are actually equalities at some point. For the Power Mean Inequality, equality holds when all the numbers are equal. So, let's check if equality can be achieved here.\n\nSuppose all \\( a_i \\) are equal.

So, the means are fixed as AM = 96/n, QM = 12/sqrt(n), CM = 6/n^{1/3}. Wait, no: AM is 96/n, QM is sqrt(144/n) = 12/sqrt(n), CM is cube root(216/n) = 6/sqrt[3](n).\n\nWait, but given that the means are fixed, regardless of the distribution of the numbers, as long as they satisfy the given sums.

So perhaps \\( n = 64 \\) is the only possible value? Or can there be other values of \\( n \\) that also satisfy the Power Mean Inequalities with equality?\n\nWait, no, because the Power Mean Inequality gives \\( \\text{AM} \\leq \\text{QM} \\leq \\text{CM} \\). So, in our case, from both inequalities, we have \\( n \\geq 64 \\), but \\( n = 64 \\) is the case when equality holds. So, for \\( n > 64 \\), does the inequality still hold? Hmm.\n\nWait, no.

Wait, but the problem is that the given sums are fixed. Wait, but in this case, if n is 65, but the sums are fixed, so the means are fixed. Wait, but the problem states that the sums are fixed. So, if n is 65, then the arithmetic mean would be 96/65, but the quadratic mean would be sqrt(144/65). But the problem is that the quadratic mean is dependent on n, so if n is different, the quadratic mean would be different. But the problem says that the sum of squares is 144, so the quadratic mean is sqrt(144/n). So, if n is 65, then the quadratic mean is sqrt(144/65). But the arithmetic mean is 96/65. So, the inequality AM \u2264 QM must hold. Let me check if that holds for n=65:\n\n96/65 \u22481.4769 \u2264 sqrt(144/65) \u22481.4884. Yes, that holds.

But does there exist a sequence of 65 positive real numbers with the given sums?\n\nHmm, that's the key question. The Power Mean inequalities are necessary conditions, but not sufficient. So even if the inequalities hold, there might not exist such a sequence. So, perhaps n can be greater than 64?\n\nWait, but how do we know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to model this as equations and see what n can be.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of variables.

The sum of squares minus the square of the sum is related to variance.\n\nBut with the sums of cubes, perhaps the only way for all the inequalities to hold is when all terms are equal, so n=64 is the only possible value.\n\nWait, because if n=64, the equality is achieved. If n>64, then to have the sums fixed, we'd have to have some numbers higher and some lower than the mean, but the question is whether we can still have the same sum, sum of squares, and sum of cubes.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Suppose I have n=65. Then, to keep the sum at 96, perhaps I can have one term increased and another decreased to compensate. But by how much? How does that affect the sum of squares and cubes?\n\nLet me try an example. Suppose in the case where n=64, all a_i are 1.5 because 1.5*64=96. Then sum of squares is 64*(1.5)^2=64*2.25=144, which matches, and sum of cubes is 64*(1.5)^3=64*3.375=216, which also matches.\n\nNow, suppose I take one of the 1.5s and make it 2, and another and make it 1.

So, to keep the sum of squares the same, we need to adjust in such a way that the increase in squares from some terms equals the decrease from others.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of cubes would be 8 +1 =9 instead of 2*(3.375)=6.75, so the total sum of cubes would increase by 2.25. But in our problem, the sum of cubes is fixed at 216, so that's a problem. So, in this case, changing two terms would require more careful balancing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I have one term increased by x and another decreased by x, so that the total sum remains the same. Let me formalize this.\n\nSuppose in the case of n=64, all terms are 1.5. Let me take two terms, say a and b, and set a = 1.5 + x and b = 1.5 - x. Then, the sum remains the same. The sum of squares becomes (1.5 + x)^2 + (1.5 - x)^2 = 2*(1.5)^2 + 2x^2. So, the sum of squares increases by 2x^2. To keep the total sum of squares the same as before (144), we need this to be equal to the original sum. But since the original sum of squares for all terms is 144, changing two terms would require that the total sum of squares remains 144, so the increase from these two terms must be offset by decreases elsewhere. But if we only change two terms, the sum of squares would actually increase, so to keep it the same, we would have to have other terms decrease their squares, but that would require other terms to be adjusted as well.

So, this doesn't satisfy Equation (3). Therefore, this solution is invalid.\n\nHmm, that suggests that for n=65, there's no solution where the terms are adjusted in this way to satisfy all three conditions. Maybe there's another way to adjust terms? Or perhaps n=65 isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to try a different number of terms adjusted. Maybe adjust three terms instead of one or two.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to conclude that the only possible value of n is 64, as any deviation from equality would either require the sum of squares or sum of cubes to change, given the fixed sums, which they can't. Therefore, n=64 is the only possible value.\n\nThus, the sum of all possible values of n is just 64.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\) given the sums of a sequence of positive real numbers. Through the Power Mean Inequality, we determined that \\( n \\) must be at least 64. Checking the case where all terms are equal (a necessary condition for equality in the Power Mean Inequality), we found that \\( n = 64 \\) satisfies all given sums. Attempts to find sequences for \\( n > 64 \\) led to inconsistencies, suggesting that \\( n = 64 \\) is the only valid solution. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\) is 64.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{64}\n\\]"
