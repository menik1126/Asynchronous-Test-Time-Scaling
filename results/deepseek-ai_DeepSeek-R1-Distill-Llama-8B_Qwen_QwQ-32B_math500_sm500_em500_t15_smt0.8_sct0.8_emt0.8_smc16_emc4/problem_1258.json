            "output": "First, I need to understand what it means to convert a decimal number to base six. This involves expressing the number in terms of powers of six.\n\nI'll start by determining the highest power of six that is less than or equal to 999. By calculating successive powers of six, I find that 6^5 (7776) is too large, and 6^4 (1296) is still larger than 999. Therefore, 6^3 (216) is the highest power needed.\n\nNext, I'll divide 999 by 216 to find the coefficient for 6^3. This gives me 4 with a remainder of 999 - 4*216 = 999 - 864 = 135.\n\nThen, I'll take the remainder, 135, and divide it by 6^2 (36). This results in 3 with a remainder of 135 - 3*36 = 135 - 108 = 27.\n\nContinuing, I'll divide the new remainder, 27, by 6^1 (6). This gives me 4 with a remainder of 27 - 4*6 = 27 - 24 = 3.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the final remainder, 3, by 6^0 (1). This simply gives 3 with no remainder.\n\nPutting it all together, the coefficients for each power of six are 4, 3, 4, and 3, resulting in the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal being 3433_6.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of \\( 999_{10} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the powers of 6 needed:**\n   \\[\n   6^0 = 1 \\\\\n   6^1 = 6 \\\\\n   6^2 = 36 \\\\\n   6^3 = 216 \\\\\n   6^4 = 1296 \\quad (\\text{larger than 999, so we'll use up to } 6^3)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide 999 by \\( 6^3 \\) (216) to find the coefficient for \\( 6^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 216 = 4 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 999 - 4 \\times 216 = 135\n   \\]\n\n3. **"
