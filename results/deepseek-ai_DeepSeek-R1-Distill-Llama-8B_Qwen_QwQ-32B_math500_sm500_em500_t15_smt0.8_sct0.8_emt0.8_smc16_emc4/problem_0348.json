This gives me a total of 13.\n\nNext, I need to explore different placements of parentheses to minimize the expression's value. I'll start by grouping the first three numbers: (1 + 2 + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6. Calculating this, 1 + 2 + 3 equals 6, so the expression becomes 6 - 4 + 5 + 6, which totals 13.\n\nThen, I'll try grouping the first two numbers with the minus sign: 1 + (2 + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6. Here, 2 + 3 equals 5, making the expression 1 + 5 - 4 + 5 + 6, resulting in 13.\n\nI'll also consider grouping the subtraction with the next two numbers: 1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6. Calculating this, 3 - 4 equals -1, so the expression becomes 1 + 2 - 1 + 5 + 6, totaling 13.\n\nExploring other combinations, such as (1 + 2) + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6, results in 1 + 2 - 1 + 5 + 6, which is also 13.\n\nI'll test grouping larger sections, like (1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6. Calculating this, 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 equals 2, so the expression becomes 2 + 5 + 6, totaling 13.\n\nFinally, I'll try placing parentheses around the subtraction part: 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6. Calculating this, 4 + 5 equals 9, making the expression 1 + 2 + 3 - 9 + 6, which simplifies to 3.\n\nAfter evaluating all possible placements of parentheses without altering the order of operations, the minimum value obtained is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo find the minimum possible value of the expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 +"

    "question": "The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)\n\nEnter your answer as a single value."
