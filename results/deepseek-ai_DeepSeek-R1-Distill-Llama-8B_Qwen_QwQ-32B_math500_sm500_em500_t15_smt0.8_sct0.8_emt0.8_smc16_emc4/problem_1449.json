I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, sometimes taking logarithms can help, but this one looks a bit tricky because of the \\(3^{2x}\\) term. Maybe I can rewrite it to make it easier to handle.\n\nFirst, I notice that \\(3^{2x}\\) can be written as \\((3^x)^2\\). So the equation becomes \\((3^x)^2 + 19 = 10^x\\). Hmm, that might not help directly, but maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me let \\(y = 3^x\\). Then, \\((3^x)^2\\) becomes \\(y^2\\), so the equation is now \\(y^2 + 19 = 10^x\\).\n\nBut wait, I also have \\(10^x\\). Maybe I can express that in terms of \\(y\\) or something else. Let me think. If \\(y = 3^x\\), is there a way to relate \\(10^x\\) to \\(y\\)? Maybe using logarithms? Let's see. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get \\(\\ln y = x \\ln 3\\), so \\(x = \\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln 3}\\). Then, \\(10^x = e^{\\ln(10^x)} = e^{x \\ln 10} = e^{\\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln 3} \\cdot \\ln 10}\\). Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can take the original equation and express both sides in terms of \\(10^x\\). Let me rearrange the equation:\n\n\\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\)\n\nI can subtract \\(10^x\\) from both sides to get:\n\n\\(3^{2x} - 10^x + 19 = 0\\)\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem immediately helpful. Maybe I can make a substitution. Let me let \\(t = 10^x\\). Then, since \\(3^{2x} = (3^x)^2\\), I can write \\(3^{2x} = (3^x)^2"

Because in the substitution, we have t=10^x, so t must be positive. For t <81, h(t)=t -t^{0.9542}. For t=1, h(1)=1 -1=0. At t=0, h(t)=0 -0=0. Hmm, but does h(t) ever reach 19?\n\nWait, for t=100, h(t)=19 as we saw. What about t=1000:\n\nh(1000)=1000 -1000^{0.9542}=1000 - (1000^{0.9542})=1000 - (10^{3*0.9542})=1000 -10^{2.8626}≈1000 - 10^{2 +0.8626}=1000 - (10^2 *10^{0.8626})=1000 -100 *7.2≈1000 -720=280>19.\n\nSo as t increases beyond 100, h(t) continues to increase. But for t between 1 and 100, h(t) increases from 0 up to 19.\n\nWait, but wait, earlier when I substituted t=10^x, I found that t=100 corresponds to x=2, which gives h(t)=19.\n\nBut when t=100, h(t)=19. So is x=2 the only solution?\n\nWait, but earlier when"

Let me check again.\n\nWait, the substitution was t=10^x, so x=log10(t). The equation becomes t - t^{0.9542}=19. The solution t=100 gives x=2. But if there is another t where h(t)=19, then there would be another solution. But according to the function h(t), when t increases beyond 100, h(t) increases further. So h(t)=19 occurs only once at t=100. Because for t>100, h(t) is greater than 19, and for t<100, h(t) is less than 19. Wait, but when t approaches infinity, h(t)=t - t^{0.9542} ~ t, so it goes to infinity. So h(t)=19 has only one solution at t=100. Therefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of x between 1.9 and 1.95, I thought f(x)=19 might be achieved there, but that must have been an error in calculation. Let me recalculate f(1.95):\n\nWait, f(x)=10^x -3^{2x}=10^x -9^x.\n\nAt x=1.95:\n\n10^1.95 ≈ 10^(1 +0.95)=10*10^0.95≈10*8.912≈89.12\n\n9^1.95=9^(1 +0.95)=9*9^0.95≈9*(9^0.95). Let me compute 9^0.95:\n\nTake natural log: ln(9^0.95)=0.95*ln9≈0.95*2.197≈2.087, so e^2.087≈8.06. So 9^0.95≈8.06, so 9^1.95"

At x=2, f(x)=19.\n\nWait, so actually, f(x) increases from x=1.95 to x=2, so it's increasing, so f(x)=19 is achieved only at x=2.\n\nWait, so earlier when I thought f(x)=19 was achieved before x=2, that must have been an error in calculation.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the solution is x=2.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\) can be approached by testing integer values and analyzing the behavior of the functions involved.\n\n1. **Testing Integer Values:**\n   - For \\(x = 2\\):\n     \\[\n     3^{2 \\cdot 2} + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 10^2 = 100\n     \\]\n     Both sides equal 100, so \\(x = 2\\) is a solution.\n\n2. **Analyzing Function Behavior:**\n   - Define \\(f(x) = 10^x - 3^{2x}\\).\n   - Compute \\(f(x)\\) for values around \\(x = 2\\) and observe that \\(f(x)\\) is increasing for \\(x \\geq 1\\).\n   - The derivative \\(f'(x)\\) is positive, indicating \\(f(x)\\) is increasing.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \\(f(x)\\) is increasing and equals 19 at \\(x = 2\\), there are no other solutions.\n\nThe solution is \\(x = 2\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
