They satisfy three equations:\n\n1. xyz = 4,\n2. x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 + z\u00b3 = 4,\n3. xy\u00b2 + x\u00b2y + xz\u00b2 + x\u00b2z + yz\u00b2 + y\u00b2z = 12.\n\nAnd I need to find the value of xy + yz + zx. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for symmetric equations involving variables like this, sometimes using symmetric sums or Vieta's formulas can help. Maybe I can relate these equations to the roots of a cubic equation.\n\nLet me denote s = x + y + z, p = xy + yz + zx, and t = xyz. From the first equation, I know that t = 4. So that's given.\n\nNow, the second equation is x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 + z\u00b3 = 4. I also remember that x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 + z\u00b3 can be expressed in terms of s, p, and t. The formula is:\n\nx\u00b3 + y\u00b3 + z\u00b3 = (x + y + z)\u00b3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz.\n\nPlugging in what I know, that would be:\n\n4 = s\u00b3 - 3s p + 3*4.\n\nSo simplifying:\n\n4 = s\u00b3 - 3s p + 12.\n\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\ns\u00b3 - 3s p + 12 - 4 = 0,\ns\u00b3 - 3s p + 8 = 0.\n\nHmm, okay, so that's equation (a): s\u00b3 - 3s p + 8 = 0.\n\nNow, moving on to the third equation: xy\u00b2 + x\u00b2y + xz\u00b2 + x\u00b2z + yz\u00b2 + y\u00b2z = 12.\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor or simplify this. Let's write it as:\n\n(xy\u00b2 + x\u00b2y) + (xz\u00b2 + x\u00b2z) + (yz\u00b2 + y\u00b2z) = 12.\n\nFactor out common terms in each pair:\n\nxy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12.\n\nSo, that's x"

Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, notice that each term is of the form x y\u00b2, x\u00b2 y, etc. Maybe factor differently.\n\nWait, another thought: Let's factor by grouping. Let's group terms with x:\n\nxy\u00b2 + x\u00b2y + xz\u00b2 + x\u00b2z + yz\u00b2 + y\u00b2z.\n\nGroup as (xy\u00b2 + x\u00b2y + xz\u00b2 + x\u00b2z) + (yz\u00b2 + y\u00b2z).\n\nFactor x from the first four terms:\n\nx(y\u00b2 + x y + z\u00b2 + x z) + y(z\u00b2 + y z).\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe factor out common terms differently. Let me try:\n\n= xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y)\n= x y (x + y) + x z (x + z) + y z (y + z).\n\nHmm, okay, now that looks similar to the expression for (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx). Let me recall:\n\n(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x\u00b2y + x\u00b2z + y\u00b2x + y\u00b2z + z\u00b2x + z\u00b2y + 3xyz.\n\nWait, that's similar but not quite the same as our third equation. Let's write it out:\n\n(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = xy(x + y) + yz(y + z) + zx(z + x) + 3xyz.\n\nWait, so that's:\n\nxy(x + y) + yz(y + z) + zx(z + x) + 3xyz.\n\nBut in our third equation, we have:\n\nxy\u00b2 + x\u00b2y + xz\u00b2 + x\u00b2z + yz\u00b2 + y\u00b2z = xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z).\n\nWhich is exactly the left-hand side of the expression above minus 3xyz.\n\nSo:\n\nThird equation = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the third equation is equal"

Wait, so is that the answer? Let me check.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when solving equations, especially with substitutions, there might be some hidden assumptions or multiple solutions.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the steps again.\n\nStarting with the third equation:\n\nWe had the third equation equal to 12, which we expressed as (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12.\n\nPlugging in xyz = 4 gives (s)(p) - 12 = 12, so s p = 24. That seems correct.\n\nThen, the second equation: x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 + z\u00b3 = 4, which we expanded using the identity to s\u00b3 - 3 s p + 3 t = 4. Since t = 4, that gives s\u00b3 - 3 s p + 12 = 4, so s\u00b3 - 3 s p = -8. Wait, hold on, let me check that again.\n\nWait, the formula is x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 + z\u00b3 = (x + y + z)^3 -"

Then:\n\nIf x = y = z, then from the first equation, x\u00b3 =4, so x = cube root of 4 \u2248 1.5874.\n\nThen, x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 + z\u00b3 = 3x\u00b3 = 3*(4) =12, but the second equation is 4, so that's not possible.
