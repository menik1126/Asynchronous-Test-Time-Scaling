Dividing 42 by 2 again gives 21. Then, dividing 21 by 3 gives 7, and finally, dividing 7 by 7 gives 1. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nNext, I'll aim to distribute these prime factors into different integers to minimize their sum. I want to use as many small integers as possible because smaller numbers typically result in a smaller sum.\n\nI'll begin by breaking down the factors into distinct integers. Starting with the smallest possible integers:\n\n1. Start with 1. It doesn't affect the product.\n2. Then take 2. So, I have 1 \u00d7 2 = 2.\n3. Next, I can take 3. Now, the product is 2 \u00d7 3 = 6.\n4. Then, I'll include 4. The product is now 6 \u00d7 4 = 24.\n5. I need to reach the product of 84, so I'll check if multiplying by 7 is necessary. Adding 7 gives 24 \u00d7 7 = 168, which is much larger than 84. This means I need to adjust my approach.\n\nSince multiplying by 7 alone overshoots the target, I'll try a different combination. Instead of including 4, I'll use a higher number that when multiplied with 2 and 3 gives 84. Trying 6, I have 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 6 = 36, which is still less than 84. To reach 84, I'll need another factor. Adding 7 gives 36 \u00d7 7 = 252, which is too high.\n\nGiven this, I realize that including 1, 2, 3, and 7 directly would result in a product of 42, which is half of 84. To achieve the exact product of 84, I can multiply one of the numbers by 2. Adding an extra 2 to the 7, making it 14, gives the set {1, 2, 3, 14} with a product of 84 and a sum of 20.\n\nFinally, I'll verify if there's a"
