The answer should be expressed as \u221aa / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find a + b.\n\nAlright, let me think. The distance from the origin to a point (x, y) is given by the distance formula: d = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). So, I need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint that y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3).\n\nHmm, that sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember there are two main methods to tackle this kind of problem: substitution and Lagrange multipliers. Since this seems to be a single-variable problem in disguise, substitution might be simpler.\n\nLet me try substitution. First, I can express y in terms of x from the given equation: y = (x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2. Then, plug this into the distance formula.\n\nSo, d = \u221a(x\u00b2 + [(x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2]^2). To find the minimum distance, I should minimize d\u00b2, which will be easier because the square root is a monotonically increasing function, so the minimum of d\u00b2 corresponds to the minimum of d.\n\nLet me compute d\u00b2 first:\n\nd\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + [(x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2]^2.\n\nSimplify the second term: [(x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2]^2 = (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nNow, I can expand this to make it a function I can differentiate.\n\nFirst, let's compute (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 = x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9.\n\nSo, d\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9)/2.\n\nLet me combine the terms:\n\nd\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (x\u2074)/2 - 3x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2 = -2x\u00b2, so:\n\nd\u00b2 ="

To do that, I should take the derivative f'(x), set it equal to zero, and solve for x.\n\nLet's compute f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = derivative of (x\u2074)/2 is x\u00b3, derivative of -2x\u00b2 is -4x, and derivative of 9/2 is 0. So,\n\nf'(x) = (x\u00b3) - 4x.\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\nx\u00b3 - 4x = 0.\n\nFactor out an x:\n\nx(x\u00b2 - 4) = 0.\n\nSo, the critical points are at x = 0 and x\u00b2 - 4 = 0, which gives x = \u00b12.\n\nAlright, so we have critical points at x = 0 and x = \u00b12. Now, I should test these points to see which gives the minimal f(x). Also, I should check if there's a minimum at these points.\n\nLet's evaluate f(x) at each critical point.\n\nFirst, x = 0:\nf(0) = (0)/2 - 2*(0)\u00b2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2.\n\nNext, x = 2:\nf(2) = (2\u2074)/2 - 2*(2)\u00b2 + 9/2.\nCompute step by step:\n2\u2074 = 16, so 16/2 = 8.\n2*(2)\u00b2 = 2*4 = 8.\nSo, 8 - 8 + 9/2 = 0 + 9/2 = 9/2.\n\nSame for x = -2 because f(x) is even (all exponents are even, so it's symmetric about y-axis). So, f(-2) = 9/2 as well.\n\nInteresting, both x = 0 and x = \u00b12 give f(x) = 9/2. Wait, that suggests that the minimal value might be 9/2? But wait, that can't be right because 9/2 is the"

Maybe I need to do the second derivative test.\n\nLet me compute the second derivative f''(x):\n\nFirst, f'(x) = x\u00b3 - 4x.\n\nThen, f''(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 4.\n\nEvaluate f''(x) at x = 0:\n\nf''(0) = 0 - 4 = -4, which is less than zero. So, at x = 0, the function has a local maximum.\n\nAt x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 3*(4) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8, which is greater than zero.

But then why is f(1) = 3, which is lower than 9/2?\n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me recalculate f(1):\n\nf(1) = (1)^4 / 2 - 2*(1)^2 + 9/2.\n\nSo, 1/2 - 2 + 9/2.\n\n1/2 - 2 is -3/2, plus 9/2 is 6/2 = 3. That's correct.\n\nHmm, so f(1) is 3, which is less than 9/2 (which is 4.5). So, that means that the minimal value is actually lower than 9/2. So, my mistake must be in the critical points?\n\nWait, but the derivative was f'(x) = x\u00b3 - 4x. Setting that to zero gives x(x\u00b2 - 4) = 0, so x = 0, 2, -2. So, that's correct. But then why is f(1) less?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup of f(x). Let me check again.\n\nOriginal distance squared is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, and y = (x\u00b2 - 3)/\u221a2.\n\nSo, y\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 - 3)^2 / 2.\n\nTherefore, d\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 - 3)^2 / 2.\n\nExpanding (x\u00b2 - 3)^2: x^4 - 6x\u00b2 + 9.\n\nTherefore, d\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (x^4 -6x\u00b2 +9)/2.\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nx\u00b2 + (x^4)/2 - 3x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nSo, combining x\u00b2 terms: 1x\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2 = -2x\u00b2.\n\nThus, d\u00b2 = (x^4)/2 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2.

So, x = 0, 2, -2.\n\nSo, derivative is correct, leading to critical points at x = 0, \u00b12.\n\nBut then why does the function at x =1 have a lower value? Maybe because the function is not convex everywhere? Or perhaps f(x) has multiple minima?\n\nWait, perhaps I should plot f(x) or analyze its behavior. Let me consider the behavior as x tends to infinity.\n\nAs x becomes large, the term (x^4)/2 dominates, so f(x) tends to infinity. Similarly, as x tends to negative infinity, same thing. So, the function has minima somewhere. But according to derivative, only at x = \u00b12.\n\nBut wait, at x=1, f(x) is 3, which is less than at x=2 (which is 4.5). That suggests that there's a dip in the function. Maybe the critical points at x=2 are actually maxima or something.\n\nWait, let me compute f''(x) again.\n\nf''(x) = derivative of f'(x) which was x\u00b3 - 4x. So, f''(x) = 3x\u00b2 - 4.\n\nSo, at x = 2, f''(2) = 3*(4) - 4 = 12 -4 = 8, which is positive, so x=2 is a local minimum.\n\nAt x=0, f''(0) = -4, which is negative, so x=0 is a local maximum.\n\nWait, but then if x=2 is a local minimum, but f(x) at x=2 is 9/2 = 4.5, which is higher than f(1)=3.\n\nSo, that suggests that the function might have another local minimum somewhere else. But how come the derivative didn't show it?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that f(x) is f(x)=x^4/2 - 2x^2 +9/2.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to use Lagrange multipliers.

Wait a second! Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the derivative here.\n\nOh no! I see the mistake now. The derivative of (x^4)/2 is (4x^3)/2 = 2x^3, not x^3. So, my earlier calculation of f'(x) was wrong. That's a critical error.\n\nOh my goodness, that's a big mistake.
