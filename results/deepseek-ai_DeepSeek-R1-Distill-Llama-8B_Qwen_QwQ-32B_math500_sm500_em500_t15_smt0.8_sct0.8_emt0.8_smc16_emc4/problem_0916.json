However, since the integers must be distinct, I'll need to combine some of these factors.\n\nFirst, I'll try using the smallest possible integers. Starting with 1, the next smallest distinct integer is 2. Multiplying 1 and 2 gives 2.\n\nNext, multiplying 2 by 3 gives 6. Now, dividing 84 by 6 gives 14, which can be broken down into 7 and 2. However, 2 is already used, so I'll use 14 instead.\n\nThe set {1, 2, 3, 7} multiplies to 84, and their sum is 13.\n\nI'll also consider if using higher numbers could yield a lower sum, but upon checking, the sum remains higher. Therefore, the set {1, 2, 3, 7} provides the smallest possible sum.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 84**:\n   \n   First, factorize 84 into its prime components:\n   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify Distinct Integers**:\n   \n   We need to combine these prime factors into distinct positive integers. To minimize the sum, we should use the smallest possible integers.\n\n3. **Construct the Set**:\n   \n   Start with the smallest positive integer, which is 1:\n   \\[\n   \\{1\\}\n   \\]\n   \n   Next, add the smallest possible distinct integers whose product with 1 still results in 84 when multiplied by other integers:\n   \\[\n   \\{1, 2\\}\n   \\]\n   \n   Continue this process, ensuring all integers are distinct and their product is 84:\n   \\[\n   \\{1, 2, 3, 7\\}\n   \\]\n   \n   **Verification**:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\n   \\]\n   \n   **Sum Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   1"
