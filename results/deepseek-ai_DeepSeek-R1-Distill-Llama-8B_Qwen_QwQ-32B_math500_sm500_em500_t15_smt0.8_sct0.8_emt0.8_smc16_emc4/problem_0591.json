            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: (3)5\u00b2 - 4(5 - a)\u00b2 \u00f7 3 = 63. Hmm, let me try to make sense of it step by step. First, I need to figure out what each part of the equation means and how to approach solving for 'a'.\n\nOkay, starting with the left side of the equation: 3 times 5 squared. Wait, is that 3 multiplied by 5 squared? Let me write that down. 5 squared is 25, so 3 times 25 is 75. Got that part.\n\nNext, there's a minus sign followed by 4 times (5 - a) squared, and then that whole thing is divided by 3. So, the equation now looks a bit clearer: 75 - [4(5 - a)\u00b2 / 3] = 63.\n\nHmm, to make this simpler, maybe I can subtract 75 from both sides to isolate the term with 'a'. Let me do that: - [4(5 - a)\u00b2 / 3] = 63 - 75. That simplifies to - [4(5 - a)\u00b2 / 3] = -12.\n\nNow, both sides are negative, so if I multiply both sides by -1, it becomes 4(5 - a)\u00b2 / 3 = 12. That's a bit nicer. Next, I can get rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides by 3. So, 4(5 - a)\u00b2 = 36.\n\nNow, to get (5 - a)\u00b2 by itself, I can divide both sides by 4. That gives me (5 - a)\u00b2 = 9. Taking the square root of both sides, I remember that this means there's both a positive and negative solution. So, 5 - a = 3 or 5 - a = -3.\n\nLet me solve each equation separately. Starting with 5 - a = 3: subtracting 5 from both sides gives -a = -2, and multiplying both sides by -1, I get a = 2. \n\nNow, the second equation: 5 - a = -3. Subtracting 5 from both sides, I have -a = -8. Multiplying both sides by -1, that gives a = 8.\n\nSo, the possible values for '"

            "output": "a' are 2 and 8. The question asks for the sum of these values. Adding them together: 2 + 8 = 10. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the original equation:\n\n3*5\u00b2 - 4(5 - a)\u00b2 \u00f7 3 = 63. \n\nCalculating 3*25 is indeed 75. Then subtracting [4(5 - a)^2 divided by 3]. So, 75 - (4(5 - a)^2)/3 = 63. Subtract 75: - (4(5 - a)^2)/3 = -12. Multiply both sides by -1: (4(5 - a)^2)/3 = 12. Multiply by 3: 4(5 - a)^2 = 36. Divide by 4: (5 - a)^2 = 9. Square roots: 5 - a = \u00b13. Solving gives a = 2 and 8. Sum is 10. \n\nHmm, seems correct. Let me plug them back into the original equation to verify.\n\nFirst, a = 2:\n\nLeft side: 3*25 - 4*(5 - 2)^2 /3 = 75 - 4*(3)^2 /3 = 75 - 4*9/3 = 75 - 36/3 = 75 - 12 = 63. That matches the right side.\n\nNow, a = 8:\n\nLeft side: 3*25 - 4*(5 - 8)^2 /3 = 75 - 4*(-3)^2 /3 = 75 - 4*9/3 = same as before, 75 - 12 = 63. Yep, that works too.\n\nOkay, so both solutions are valid. Their sum is definitely 10. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\(3 \\cdot 5^2 - 4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63\\).\n\nFirst, simplify the constants:\n\\[\n3 \\cdot 25 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n\\]\n\\[\n"
