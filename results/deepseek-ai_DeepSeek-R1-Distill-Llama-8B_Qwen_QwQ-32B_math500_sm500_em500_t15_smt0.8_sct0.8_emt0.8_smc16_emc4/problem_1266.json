            "output": "I need to solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nFirst, I will simplify the right side of the equation. Since \\(256\\) is a power of \\(2\\) that I recognize, I can express it as \\(2^8\\). This means the equation becomes \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the power of a power property. Raising a power to the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) power is the same as taking the square root. So, \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) becomes \\(2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, the equation is simplified to \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. This gives me \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Right Side:**\n   Recognize that \\(256\\) is a power of \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   256 = 2^8\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the Exponents Equal:**\n   The equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
