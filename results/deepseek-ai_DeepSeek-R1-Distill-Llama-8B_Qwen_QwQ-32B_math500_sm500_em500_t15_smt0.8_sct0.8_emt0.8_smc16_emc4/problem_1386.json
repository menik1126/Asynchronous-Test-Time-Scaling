The matrix M transforms the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3) and the vector (1, -3) to (7, -1). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a matrix transforms a point (x, y), it applies the matrix multiplication to the column vector (x; y). So, if I can figure out what M is, then I can apply it to the line y = 2x + 1.\n\nGiven two points before and after transformation, maybe I can set up equations to find the matrix M. A 2x2 matrix has four entries, so I need two equations each for the two points, which should give me enough information to solve for M.\n\nLet me denote M as:\nM = | a  b |\n        | c  d |\n\nSo, applying M to (2; -1) gives (9; 3). Therefore, the first equation is:\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nWhich simplifies to 2a - b = 9 ... (1)\n\nSimilarly, applying M to (1; -3) gives (7; -1). Therefore, the second equation is:\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nWhich simplifies to a - 3b = 7 ... (2)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) a - 3b = 7\n\nI need to solve these simultaneously. Maybe use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Let me multiply equation (2) by 2 so that the coefficients of a are 2 and 2a:\n\n2*(a - 3b) = 2*7\n2a - 6b = 14 ... (3)\n\nNow subtract equation (1) from equation (3):\n\n(2a - 6b) - (2a - b) = 14 - 9\n2a -6b -2a + b = 5\n-5b = 5\nSo, b = -1.\n\nNow plug back b = -1 into equation (2):\n\na - 3*(-1) = 7\na + 3 = 7"

            "output": "\na = 4.\n\nOkay, so a = 4, b = -1. Now I need to find c and d. Wait, actually, I only have two equations so far, but a matrix has four entries. Maybe I need more information. Since we have two transformations, do I have two separate equations each for c and d? Wait, no. Maybe I need to consider that the matrix is applying to both components, but since we have two separate points, we can probably get c and d from each transformation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to also set up equations for the second component. So for the first transformation, (2, -1) becomes (9, 3). So when I apply M to (2; -1), I get (2a - b; 2c - d) = (9; 3). So we have 2a - b = 9 (which we did) and 2c - d = 3. Similarly, applying M to (1; -3) gives (a - 3b; c - 3d) = (7; -1). So the second component gives a - 3b = 7 (which we did) and c - 3d = -1.\n\nSo now, since we know a and b, which are 4 and -1, we can use these to find c and d.\n\nFrom the second component of the first transformation:\n2c - d = 3 ... (4)\n\nFrom the second component of the second transformation:\nc - 3d = -1 ... (5)\n\nSo now, equations (4) and (5):\n4) 2c - d = 3\n5) c - 3d = -1\n\nLet me solve these equations. Maybe express c from equation (5):\n\nc = -1 + 3d\n\nNow plug into equation (4):\n\n2*(-1 + 3d) - d = 3\n-2 + 6d - d = 3\n-2 +5d =3\n5d =5\nd=1\n\nThen plug back d=1 into c = -1 +3d:\n\nc = -1 +3*1=2\n\nSo c=2, d=1.\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n| 4  -1 |\n| 2   1 |\n\nLet me verify this matrix with the given"

To find its equation, we can take two points on the original line, apply the transformation, and then find the equation of the line through the transformed points.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to express the line parametrically and then apply the matrix to the parametric equations. Let me think which is easier.\n\nFirst method: pick two points on the original line y =2x +1. Let me choose two arbitrary points. Let's pick x=0, then y=1, so the point (0,1). Another point, say x=1, then y=3, so (1,3). Let me also pick another point, maybe x=-1, then y= -2 +1 = -1, so (-1, -1). Wait, but two points are enough to define a line, so maybe just two points.\n\nWait, but actually, since the line is infinite, but the transformation is linear, so if we can find two points on the original line, transform them, then the line through the transformed points will be the image.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the parametric form. Let me try both approaches.\n\nFirst, let's try the point method.\n\nTake two points on the original line y=2x+1.\n\nFirst point: Let me choose x=0"

Same result, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, just to be thorough, maybe I should try another point. Let me take x=2, y=5 on the original line: (2,5).\n\nApply M to (2,5):\n\n4*2 + (-1)*5 =8 -5=3\n\n2*2 +1*5=4 +5=9\n\nSo transformed point is (3,9). Now check if this lies on y=2x+3.\n\ny=2*3+3=9. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, all transformed points lie on the line y=2x +3. So, the image of the line y=2x +1 under M is y=2x +3.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach using linear algebra.\n\nExpress the line y=2x +1 as a parametric form. Let me let x=t, then y=2t +1.\n\nSo, a point on the line is (t; 2"
