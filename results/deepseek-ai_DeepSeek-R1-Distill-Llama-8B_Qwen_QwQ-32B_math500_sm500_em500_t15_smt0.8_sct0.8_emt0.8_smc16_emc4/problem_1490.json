Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Listing them out, the prime numbers less than 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I will list out all the odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. Starting from 1, the sequence of odd numbers is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and so on.\n\nNow, to find the intersection, I need to identify the numbers that appear in both lists. Looking at the prime numbers less than 30, the numbers 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29 are all odd. Therefore, these primes are also present in the list of odd numbers.\n\nExcluding 2 from the prime numbers list because it is the only even prime number, the remaining primes are all odd. This means that all primes less than 30, except for 2, are included in the intersection.\n\nCounting these, there are 9 prime numbers less than 30: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. All of these primes are also odd numbers greater than zero.\n\nThus, the number of elements in the intersection is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and all odd numbers greater than zero, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **List of Prime Numbers Less Than 30**:\n   The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n   \\[\n   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n   \\]\n   \n2. **List of All Odd Numbers"
