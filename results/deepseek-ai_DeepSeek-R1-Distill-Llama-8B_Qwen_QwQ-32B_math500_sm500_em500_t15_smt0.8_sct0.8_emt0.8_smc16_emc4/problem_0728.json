I remember that logarithms have certain properties, so maybe I can use those properties to simplify the equations.\n\nStarting with the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\). I recall that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's the same as the logarithm of the product. So, using that property:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying inside the log, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\n\\]\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) is equivalent to \\(b^c = a\\). So applying that here:\n\n\\[\n6^2 = x^2 - y^2\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n36 = x^2 - y^2\n\\]\n\nOkay, so that's the first equation simplified. Let me note that as Equation (1):\n\n(1) \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\)\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\). This is a logarithm with base \\(y\\), so I can rewrite this in exponential form to make it easier to handle. Remember that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) means \\(b^c = a\\). So here, it becomes:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = 5x\n\\]\n\nLet me note this as Equation (2):\n\n(2) \\(y^2 = 5x\\)\n\nAlright, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\)\n2. \\(y^2 = 5x\\)\n\nI can substitute Equation (2) into Equation (1) to solve for \\(x\\). Let's do that.\n\nFrom Equation (2), \\(y^2 = 5x\\),"

Let me write it clearly:\n\n\\(x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\\)\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), so here:\n\n\\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\), \\(c = -36\\)\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(-36)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\nSimplify each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\n- The first term: \\(-(-5) = 5\\)\n- The discriminant: \\((-5)^2 - 4*1*(-36) = 25 + 144 = 169\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{169}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\sqrt{169}\\) is 13, so:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5 \\pm 13}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\n1. \\(x = \\frac{5 + 13}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9\\)\n2. \\(x = \\frac{5 - 13}{2} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4\\)\n\nSo, the possible values for \\(x\\) are 9 and -4.\n\nBut I can't forget that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are inside logarithms in the original equations. Remember that logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. So, let's check the domain constraints.\n\nFrom the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y)\\) and \\(\\log_6 (x + y)\\) must be defined. That means:\n\n- \\(x - y > 0\\)\n- \\(x + y > 0\\)\n\nFrom the second equation: \\(\\log_y"

Therefore, \\(x = 9\\) is a valid solution, but \\(x = -4\\) is negative, which violates the domain because \\(5x\\) would be negative, and logarithm of a negative number is undefined. So, \\(x = -4\\) is discarded.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\(x = 9\\).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check what \\(y\\) would be in each case. Since \\(y^2 = 5x\\), if \\(x = 9\\), then \\(y^2 = 45\\), so \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\).\n\nBut since \\(y\\) is the base of a logarithm, \\(y\\) must be positive and not equal to 1. So, \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) is approximately 6.708, which is positive and not 1, so that's okay.\n\nIf \\(x = -4\\), then \\(y^2 = 5*(-4) = -20\\), which is impossible because \\(y^2\\) can't be negative. So, that's consistent with our earlier conclusion that \\(x = -4\\) is invalid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\(x\\) must be 9.\n\nWait, let me double-check by substituting back into the original equations.\n\nFirst, when \\(x = 9\\):\n\nFrom Equation (2): \\(y^2 = 5*9 = 45\\), so \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\).
