Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's given. The matrix M transforms the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3), and it also transforms (1, -3) to (7, -1). So, essentially, when M acts on a vector, it's like multiplying the matrix by that vector. So, mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nM * (2; -1) = (9; 3)\n\nand\n\nM * (1; -3) = (7; -1)\n\nSince M is a 2x2 matrix, I can denote it as:\n\nM = [a  b;\n      c  d]\n\nThen, multiplying M by a vector (x; y) gives [a*x + b*y; c*x + d*y]. So, applying this to both given vectors, I can set up a system of equations.\n\nLet's start with the first transformation:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9 \u2192 2a - b = 9 ...(1)\n\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3 \u2192 2c - d = 3 ...(2)\n\nNow, the second transformation:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7 \u2192 a - 3b = 7 ...(3)\n\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1 \u2192 c - 3d = -1 ...(4)\n\nSo, equations (1)-(4) give me four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d.\n\nI need to solve this system. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFrom equation (3): a = 7 + 3b ...(3a)\n\nFrom equation (1): 2a - b = 9. Let's substitute a from (3a):\n\n2*(7 + 3b) - b = 9 \u2192 14 + 6b - b = 9 \u2192 14 + 5b = 9 \u2192 5b = 9 -14 \u2192 5b = -5 \u2192 b = -1\n\nThen, from (3a): a = 7 + 3*(-1) = 7 - 3 = 4\n\nSo, a ="

Let's use equation (2): 2c - d = 3.\n\nFrom equation (4): c = -1 + 3d ...(4a)\n\nPlugging c into equation (2): 2*(-1 + 3d) - d = 3 \u2192 -2 + 6d - d = 3 \u2192 -2 + 5d = 3 \u2192 5d = 5 \u2192 d = 1\n\nThen, from (4a): c = -1 + 3*1 = -1 + 3 = 2\n\nSo, c = 2, d = 1.\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n\n[4   -1;\n2    1]\n\nAlright, now that I have the matrix M, I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M.\n\nHmm, how do I find the image of a line under a matrix transformation? I remember that the image of a line is another line, which can be found by parameterizing the original line and then applying M, and then eliminating the parameter.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the image of a line is the set of all M*v where v is on the original line.\n\nLet me try parameterizing the original line. Let me let x be a parameter, say t. Then, the original line y = 2x +1 can be expressed as:\n\nx = t\n\ny = 2t + 1\n\nSo, any point on the line is (t, 2t + 1).\n\nNow, applying matrix M to this vector:\n\nM*(t; 2t +1) = [4*t + (-1)*(2t + 1); 2*t + 1*(2t + 1)]\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\nFirst component: 4t - (2t +1) = 4t -2t -1 = 2t -1\n\nSecond component: 2t + (2t +1) = 2t + 2t +1 = 4t +1\n\nSo, the image of the point (t, 2t +1) under M is (2t -1, 4t +1).\n\nNow, let me see if this image is a line.

That might be possible, but let me see if there's another way to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the matrix to find the transformation of the line equation directly.\n\nAnother approach: The line y = 2x +1 can be written as 2x - y +1 =0.\n\nUnder the linear transformation M, the image of the line can be found by considering the transformation of points on the line. Alternatively, perhaps using the inverse of the matrix?\n\nWait, but since the line is affine, not a subspace, the image will also be an affine line. Since M is invertible? Let me check if M is invertible.\n\nThe determinant of M is (4)(1) - (-1)(2) =4 +2 =6, which is non-zero, so M is invertible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another way is to consider the direction vector of the original line and the point on the line.\n\nThe original line y =2x +1 has direction vector (1, 2). The point (0,1) is on the line.\n\nSo, the image of the line under M will be the image of the point (0,1) plus the image of the direction vector (1,2) scaled by some parameter.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, image of the point (0,1):\n\nM*(0;1) = [4*0 + (-1)*1; 2*0 +1*1] = (-1;1)\n\nImage of direction vector (1,2):\n\nM*(1;2) = [4*1 + (-1)*2; 2*1 +1*2] = (4 -2; 2 +2) = (2;4)\n\nSo, the direction vector of the image line is (2,4), which can be simplified to (1,2). Wait, so the direction vector remains the same direction? Hmm, so the direction vector is scaled but direction is same?\n\nWait, the direction vector (1,2) is transformed to (2,4), which is 2*(1,2). So, the direction vector is scaled by 2, but the direction is the same. So, the image line"

            "output": " has the same slope as the original line, which is 2. But wait, does that make sense?\n\nWait, but actually, under linear transformation, the direction vector is scaled by the columns of M. The slope is determined by the ratio dy/dx. So, original slope is 2, direction vector (1,2). After transformation, direction vector is (2,4), which is slope 4/2=2. So, same slope.\n\nBut in the earlier approach, the image line was y=2x +3. So, same slope, different intercept.\n\nSo, both approaches seem to give the same result, that the image is a line with slope 2, intercept 3.\n\nBut let me make sure if the intercept calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the image line equation by expressing parametric equations.\n\nI had the image points as (2t -1, 4t +1).
