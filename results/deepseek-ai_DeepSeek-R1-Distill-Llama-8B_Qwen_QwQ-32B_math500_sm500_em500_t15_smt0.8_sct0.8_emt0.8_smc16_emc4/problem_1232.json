But I think I can handle it by using some algebraic manipulation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that when there's a square root in an equation, a common strategy is to isolate that square root term and then square both sides to eliminate it. That way, I can get rid of the radical and make the equation easier to handle. So, let me try that here.\n\nStarting with the original equation:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\]\n\nI want to get the square root by itself. So, I'll subtract 4 from both sides:\n\\[ x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\]\n\nNow, the square root is isolated, which is good. The next step is to square both sides to remove the square root. But before I do that, I should remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll need to check my answers at the end.\n\nSo, squaring both sides:\n\\[ (x - 4)^2 = (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 \\]\n\\[ x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\]\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side to set it equal to zero:\n\\[ x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0 \\]\nCombine like terms:\n- The \\( x^2 \\) term stays as is.\n- The \\( -8x + 2x \\) combines to \\( -6x \\).\n- \\( 16 - 11 \\) simplifies to \\( 5 \\).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\]\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation. I can try factoring it. Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6.\n\nThinking... The factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, if both are negative, they would add up to -6. Let's check:\n- (-1) * (-5) = 5\n-"

So, the equation factors as:\n\\[ (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 \\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the potential solutions:\n1. \\( x - 1 = 0 \\) → \\( x = 1 \\)\n2. \\( x - 5 = 0 \\) → \\( x = 5 \\)\n\nBut wait, I can't forget about the squaring step earlier. Sometimes squaring can introduce solutions that don't actually satisfy the original equation. So, I need to check both x = 1 and x = 5 in the original equation to make sure they work.\n\nLet's start with x = 1:\nOriginal equation:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\]\nSubstitute x = 1:\n\\[ 1 = \\sqrt{11 - 2(1)} + 4 \\]\nCalculate inside the square root:\n11 - 2(1) = 11 - 2 = 9\nSo,\n\\[ 1 = \\sqrt{9} + 4 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 3 + 4 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 7 \\]\nWait, that's not true. 1 does not equal 7. So, x = 1 is an extraneous solution and must be discarded.\n\nNow, checking x = 5:\nOriginal equation:\n\\[ 5 = \\sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4 \\]\nCalculate inside the square root:\n11 - 10 = 1\nSo,\n\\[ 5 = \\sqrt{1} + 4 \\]\n\\[ 5 = 1 + 4 \\]\n\\[ 5 = 5 \\]\nYes, that works. So, x = 5 is the valid solution.\n\nJust to recap my steps:\n1. Original equation: \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\)\n2. Isolate the square root: \\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\)\n3. Square both sides: \\( (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x \\)\n4. Expand and simplify: \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\)\n5. Factor: \\( (x - 1)(x - 5) ="

I didn't make any calculation errors, but just to be safe, I'll go through the steps again to double-check.\n\nStarting from x = 5:\nPlug into original equation:\nLeft side: 5\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 10) + 4 = sqrt(1) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\nSo, 5 = 5. Correct.\n\nFor x = 1:\nLeft side: 1\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 2) + 4 = sqrt(9) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\nSo, 1 ≠ 7. Hence, x =1 is not a solution.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent.
