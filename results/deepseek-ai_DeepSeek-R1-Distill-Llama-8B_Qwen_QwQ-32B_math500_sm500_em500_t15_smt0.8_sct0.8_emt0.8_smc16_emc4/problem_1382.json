Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the matrix M is given as acting on two specific vectors:\n\nIt takes [2; -1] to [9; 3], and [1; -3] to [7; -1].\n\nI think I can use these to find the matrix M. Since M is a 2x2 matrix, let me denote it as:\n\nM = [[a, b],\n     [c, d]]\n\nSo, when M acts on [2; -1], it gives [9; 3]. That means:\n\n[a  b] [2]   [9]\n[c  d] [-1] = [3]\n\nWhich gives two equations:\n\n1. 2a + (-1)b = 9\n2. 2c + (-1)d = 3\n\nSimilarly, when M acts on [1; -3], it gives [7; -1], so:\n\n[a  b] [1]   [7]\n[c  d] [-3] = [-1]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n3. a*1 + b*(-3) = 7\n4. c*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. -2c - d = 3 (Wait, hold on. Equation 2 was 2c + (-1)d = 3, so that's 2c - d = 3, not -2c - d = 3. I need to correct that.)\n\nWait, no, equation 2 was 2c + (-1)d = 3, which is 2c - d = 3.\n\nEquation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nSo, equations:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9\n\n2. 2c - d = 3\n\n3. a - 3b = 7\n\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nSo, I have four equations with variables a, b, c, d. I need to solve for a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me solve equations 1 and "

So, I need to find what happens to y = 2x + 1 when we apply M.\n\nAlternatively, since M is a linear transformation, the image of the line will be the set of all M*v where v is on the line.\n\nBut since the line is affine, I might need to consider it as a point and then transform the direction as well.\n\nWait, maybe an easier way is to note that the image of the line y = 2x + 1 is a line, which is the image of the line under M.\n\nLet me think: the line can be parametrized.

So M*[1;3] = [4*1 + (-1)*3; 2*1 +1*3] = [4 -3; 2 +3] = [1;5]\n\nSo the transformed points are (-1,1) and (1,5). Let me see if these lie on y = 2x +3.\n\nFor (-1,1): 2*(-1) +3 = -2 +3 =1, which matches y=1.\n\nFor (1,5): 2*1 +3 =5, which matches y=5. So that works.\n\nAnother point: Let's take x = -1 on the original line. Then y = 2*(-1)+1 = -1. So point (-1, -1). Applying M:\n\nM*[-1; -1] = [4*(-1) + (-1)*(-1); 2*(-1) +1*(-1)] = [-4 +1; -2 -1] = [-3; -3]\n\nCheck if (-3, -3) is on y=2x +3: 2*(-3) +3 = -6 +3 = -3. Yes, that works.\n\nSo seems like the image is indeed y = 2x +3. Wait, but let me check another point to be sure.\n\nTake x = 2 on the original line: y = 2*2 +1 =5. So point (2,5). Applying M:\n\nM*[2;5] = [4*2 + (-1)*5; 2*2 +1*5] = [8 -5;4 +5] = [3;9]\n\nCheck if (3,9) is on y=2x+3: 2*3 +3 =9.

            "output": " M, and found [2t -1;4t +1], which led to y = 2x +3 when eliminating t.\n\nSecond method, taking specific points and transforming them, also led to points on y=2x +3. So seems consistent.\n\nSo, yes, the image is y = 2x +3.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the general case. If I have a line, which is affine, it's a translation of a direction line. The image under M would be the image of the direction line plus the image of a point.\n\nSo, let's take the direction vector of the line y = 2x +1. The direction vector is [1;2], since the slope is 2. So the direction vector is (1,2).\n\nUnder M, the direction vector [1;2] is multiplied by M:\n\nM*[1;2] = [4*1 + (-1)*2; 2*1 +1*2] = [4 -2; 2 +2] = [2;4]\n\nSo the direction vector becomes [2;4], which has slope 4/2 =2. So same slope, as expected, since M is linear.\n\nSo, the image line has the same slope as the original line, which is 2. Now, what about the intercept?\n\nTo find the intercept, let's take a point on the original line and apply M. Let's take (0,1). Apply M:\n\nM*[0;1] = [-1;1]. So the point (-1,1). So on the image line, with slope 2, passing through (-1,1):\n\ny -1 = 2(x +1) => y = 2x +2 +1 => y=2x +3. So same as before.\n\nTherefore, it's consistent.\n\nSo, I think my conclusion is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe image of the line under the transformation is \\boxed{y = 2x + 3}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first need to determine the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) that transforms the vectors \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) to \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} "
