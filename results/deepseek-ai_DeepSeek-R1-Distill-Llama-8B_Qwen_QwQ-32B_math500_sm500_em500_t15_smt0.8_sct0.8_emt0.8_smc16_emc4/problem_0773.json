Then, express this distance in the form \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{b} \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Finally, I have to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. The function is a parabola because it has an \\( x^2 \\) term. Since the coefficient is positive, it opens upwards. The origin is the point (0,0), so I need to find the point on this parabola closest to the origin.\n\nI remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. If I consider a point \\( (x, y) \\) on the graph, the distance \\( D \\) from the origin is \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Since the square root can complicate things, maybe I can minimize the square of the distance instead, which should give me the same result.\n\nSo, let me define a function \\( D^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\) and then substitute \\( y \\) from the given equation into this.\n\nGiven \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), substituting into \\( D^2 \\) gives:\n\n\\[\nD^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nLet me simplify this step by step. First, square the second term:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\times (x^2 - 3)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2\n\\]\n\nSo, now \\( D^2 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nD^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)\n\\"

Now, check if \\( a \\) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one.\n\n10 factors into 2 × 5, both primes. Neither 4 nor any higher squares divide 10, so it's square-free. So, \\( a = 10 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( a + b = 12 \\).\n\nWait a minute, hold on. Let me think again. When I substituted \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) into the equation for \\( D^2 \\), I got \\( D^2 = 2.5 \\), which is \\( 5/2 \\). So the distance is \\( \\sqrt{5/2} \\) which is \\( \\sqrt{10}/2 \\).

So, \\( D = \\sqrt{5/2} = \\sqrt{10}/2 \\).\n\nAnother way to approach this problem might be using calculus with the original distance function, but since that's similar to what I did, it's probably okay.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the shortest distance from a point to a curve is along the line perpendicular to the tangent of the curve at that point. So, the gradient vector at the closest point should point towards the origin.\n\nLet me try that approach to verify.\n\nThe function is \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). The gradient vector, which is perpendicular to the curve, is given by the negative reciprocal of the derivative dy/dx.\n\nCompute dy/dx:\n\n\\[\ndy/dx = \\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}x\n\\]\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent is \\( \\sqrt{2}x \\), so the slope of the normal line is \\( -1/(\\sqrt{2}x) \\).\n\nThe line connecting the origin (0,0) to the point (x, y) on the curve should have a slope equal to the slope of the normal line at that point.\n\nCompute the slope from origin to (x, y):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Slope} = \\frac{y - 0}{x - 0} = \\frac{y}{x}\n\\]\n\nSo, set this equal to the slope of the normal line:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y}{x} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}x}\n\\]\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply \\( y = -1/\\sqrt{2} \\), but let me check.\n\nWait, hold on. The slope of the normal line is \\( -1/(\\sqrt{2}x) \\), and the slope from the origin to the point (x, y) is \\( y/x \\). So, setting these equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y}{x} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}x}\n\\]\n\nWait, actually"
