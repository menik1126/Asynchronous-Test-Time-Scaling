So for 4\\$, it's 4! raised to the power of 4!, which is then raised to another 4! and so on, a total of 4! times. Wait, no, actually, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nThe superfactorial n\\$ is defined as a tower of n!s, n! times. So for 4\\$, it's 4!^4!^...^4!, with 4! levels. But actually, wait, the notation says the superfactorial is n\\{n!^{{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}}}}, and this tower has n! levels. So for n=4, it's 4!^4!^4!^4!^4!^4!, right? No, wait, n! levels. So for n=4, it's 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of 4!. So total of 4 levels, each 4!?\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me see: the tower starts with n!^{{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}}}, and the number of levels is n!. So for n=4, the tower has 4! = 24 levels. That seems too long, but maybe that's correct. But calculating 24 factorials and raising them to the power of 4! seems impossible manually. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nBut the question is about the units digit. Units digit cycles in patterns, especially for powers. So instead of calculating the whole number, I can find the units digit by considering the cyclicity of the last digit when raising numbers.\n\nFirst, let's break it down. 4\\$ is 4!^4!^4!... with 24 levels. But actually, since exponents are modular with respect to the units digit, perhaps we can compute each level modulo 10 and find the pattern.\n\nLet me start by computing 4! which is 24. So the tower is 24^{24^{24^{"

But that's a tower of 24s of height 24. So the question is, what is the units digit of this tower?\n\nHmm, okay. So the problem reduces to finding the units digit of a tower of 24s of height 24. Let me think about how to compute this.\n\nFirst, note that the units digit of a number raised to a power depends on the base's units digit and the exponent modulo some number. Since we're interested in mod 10, Euler's theorem tells us that if the base and modulus are coprime, then a^\u03c6(10) \u2261 1 mod 10. \u03c6(10)=4. But 24 and 10 are not coprime (they share 2), so Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. Hmm, so maybe we need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the units digit of powers of 24. The units digit of 24^k is the same as the units digit of 4^k, since 24 mod 10 is 4. So 24^k mod 10 = 4^k mod 10. Therefore, the units digit of 24^k is the same as 4^k's units digit. So, if we can find the exponent modulo the period of 4's units digit.\n\nThe units digit of 4^k cycles every 2: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc. So 4^1=4, 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, so the cycle is 4,6,4,6... with period 2. Therefore, the exponent's parity (even or odd) determines the units digit. If the exponent is even, units digit is 6; if odd, 4.\n\nTherefore, to find the units digit of 24^(tower), we need to find whether the exponent (the tower above the base 24"

            "turn": 1,
            "model": "small",
            "output": ") is even or odd.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: what is the parity (even or odd) of the tower 24^(24^(...^24)) with height 23 (since the base is 24, which is level 1, and the tower has 24 levels).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the height is 24 levels, so the exponent we're considering is the tower of 24s with height 23, because the base is level 1, and then 23 levels on top of it. Therefore, the exponent is the value of a tower of 24s of height 23.\n\nSo, let me denote E as the exponent, which is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 levels. So E = 24^(24^...^24) with 23 24s.\n\nWe need to find whether E is even or odd, because the units digit of 4^E will be 6 if E is even, 4 if E is odd.\n\nBut 24 is even, and any power of an even number is even. Therefore, E is even. Thus, 4^E will have units digit 6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's see: 24 is even, so 24^k is even for any k >=1. Therefore, E is even. Therefore, 4^E will end with 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the steps again.\n\n1. 4\\$ is a tower of 4! (which is 24) with 24 levels.\n\n2. The units digit of 24^k is the same as 4^k mod 10, which cycles every 2: even exponents give 6, odd exponents give 4.\n\n3. Therefore, to find the units digit of 24^(tower of 24s of height 24), we need to find the parity of the exponent tower, which is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 levels.\n\n4. Since 24 is even, any tower of 24s with at least one level will be even.\n\nTherefore, the exponent is even, so 4^even has units digit 6.\n\nHence, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe units digit of "
