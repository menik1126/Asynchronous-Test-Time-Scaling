It has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The question asks me to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\) and its conjugate \\(\\overline{r}\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to the square of the modulus of \\(r\\), which is always a non-negative real number. So, \\(r\\overline{r} = |r|^2\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{r\\overline{r}} = \\frac{1}{|r|^2}\\). This means that each term in the sum is essentially the reciprocal of the squared modulus of each root.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to finding the sum of reciprocals of squared magnitudes of the roots. To do this, I need to find some relationship or equation that can help me relate these terms without having to find each root individually.\n\nNext, I recall that for a polynomial, the sum of reciprocals of squared roots can be related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Specifically, if I have a polynomial \\(P(x) = a_{10}x^{10} + a_9x^9 + \\dots + a_0\\), then the sum of the roots is \\(-\\frac{a_9}{a_{10}}\\), the sum of the products of roots two at a time is \\(\\frac{a_8}{a_{10}}\\), and so on. But I'm not directly looking for sums of roots; instead, I need sums involving reciprocals of squared magnitudes.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of Vieta's formula but applied to reciprocals. Alternatively, perhaps I can express \\(\\frac{1}{r_i"

If I consider the polynomial whose roots are \\(1/r_i\\), it would be \\(x^{10}P(1/x)\\). Let's compute that.\n\nGiven \\(P(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\), the reciprocal polynomial \\(Q(x) = x^{10}P(1/x) = 1 + (13/x - 1)^{10}\\). Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated because of the terms with 1/x. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the property that for each root \\(r_i\\), its conjugate \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) is also a root. Therefore, the roots come in pairs, and each pair contributes twice to the sum. So, the total sum would be twice the sum over just five terms. Wait, but the roots are already given as five conjugate pairs, so each \\(r_j\\) and its conjugate are separate. So, for each \\(j\\), \\(r_j\\overline{r}_j = |r_j|^2\\), so each term is just \\(1/|r_j|^2\\), and since each \\(r_j\\) is paired with its conjugate, the sum is over all five terms.\n\nBut I still need a way to relate this to the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nWait a minute, another approach: Let's consider that if \\(r_i\\) is a root of the polynomial, then so is \\(s_i = \\overline{r_i}\\). So, each root \\(r_i\\) satisfies the equation, as does its conjugate.\n\nBut how does this help me? Maybe by considering both \\(r_i\\) and \\(s_i = \\overline{r_i}\\), their product \\(r_i s_i = |r_i|^2\\). So, perhaps if I can find an expression for \\(r_i s_i\\), that could be useful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I consider the polynomial evaluated at \\(x = 0\\), but that might not directly help.\n\nWait, perhaps a better idea: If I define \\(y_j = \\frac{1}{r_j}\\), then \\(|r_j|^2 = \\frac{1}{|y_j|^2}\\).

Let me think of each pair \\(r_j\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_j\\). The term \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r}_j)\\) is the same as \\(1/|r_j|^2\\). Since \\(r_j\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_j\\) are conjugates, their moduli are equal, so each pair contributes one term. Therefore, the total sum over the five terms is exactly the sum over each pair's \\(1/|r_j|^2\\). \n\nHowever, in my calculation, I considered all roots, so each root \\(r_j\\) (and its conjugate) would have their own term. Wait, but in the problem's sum, each pair is represented once. So, if I have 10 roots, each term in the problem's sum corresponds to a pair, so there are five terms. Therefore, the total sum over all roots (each root's \\(1/(r \\overline{r})\\)) would be twice the problem's desired sum, because each pair contributes two terms (for \\(r_j\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_j\\)), but the problem's sum counts each pair once. Wait, no, actually, the problem's sum is written as:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nEach term here is for a pair. Since \\(r_j \\overline{r}_j\\) is the product of the pair, so each term is the reciprocal of that product. Therefore, the problem's sum is exactly the sum over the five terms, each being \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r}_j)\\). \n\nHowever, in my calculation, I considered all roots, so each root \\(r_j\\) (and its conjugate) would have their own term.

            "output": "/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |1 +13 \\omega_j|^2\\). Since each conjugate pair contributes two roots, each contributing the same term \\(|1 +13 \\omega_j|^2\\), so the total sum over all roots is twice the desired sum. Therefore, the sum I calculated, which is 1700, is equal to twice the problem's desired sum.\n\nTherefore, the problem's desired sum is \\(1700 / 2 = 850\\). Therefore, the answer is 850.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me retrace:\n\n- The polynomial has 10 roots: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\).\n\n- Each term in the sum is \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r}_j)\\), so each pair contributes one term.\n\n- The sum we computed, 1700, is the sum over all 10 terms (each of the 10 roots). But in reality, each pair contributes two terms (for \\(r_j\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_j\\)), so the sum over all 10 terms is twice the problem's desired sum.\n\nWait, that's not correct because in our substitution, each root \\(r_j\\) is written in terms of \\(\\omega\\), so each \\(r_j\\) has a unique \\(\\omega_j\\), and the product \\(r_j \\overline{r_j}\\) is \\(1 / |1 +13 \\omega_j|^2\\). Therefore, when we sum over all roots, we get each term, but each term corresponds to each \\(\\omega_j\\). Since the problem's sum is over each pair once, so the total desired sum is 1700 divided by 2, which is 850.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that each pair contributes two terms, so the total sum over all roots is 2 times the sum of the five terms.\n\nTherefore, if total sum is 1700, then the sum over the five terms is 850.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the desired value is 850.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{850}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the equation:\n\n\\[\nx^{10} + (13x - 1"
