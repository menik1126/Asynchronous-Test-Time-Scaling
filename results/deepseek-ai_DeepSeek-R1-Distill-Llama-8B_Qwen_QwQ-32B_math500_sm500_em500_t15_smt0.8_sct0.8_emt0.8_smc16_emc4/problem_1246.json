Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when there's a square root in an equation, a common method is to isolate the square root term and then square both sides to eliminate it. That usually helps simplify things. But before I do that, I should consider the domain of the square root function, which is crucial for the problem's validity.\n\nSo, the expression inside the square root, \\( 11 - 2x \\), must be greater than or equal to zero. That gives me the inequality:\n\\[ 11 - 2x \\geq 0 \\]\nSolving for \\( x \\), I subtract 11 from both sides:\n\\[ -2x \\geq -11 \\]\nNow, divide both sides by -2. But wait, I remember that when you divide or multiply by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, dividing both sides by -2:\n\\[ x \\leq \\frac{11}{2} \\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[ x \\leq 5.5 \\]\nSo, any solution \\( x \\) must be less than or equal to 5.5. That's good to know because it restricts the possible solutions.\n\nOkay, moving on. Let me write down the equation again:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\]\nMy goal is to solve for \\( x \\), so I should isolate the square root term. Let me subtract 4 from both sides to get:\n\\[ x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\]\nNow, to eliminate the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. But before I do that, I remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll have to check my solutions at the end.\n\nSo, squaring both sides:\n\\[ (x - 4)^2 = (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 \\]\nSimplifying both sides:\nLeft side: \\( (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 \\)\nRight side: \\( 11 - 2x \\)\nPutting"

            "output": " it all together:\n\\[ x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\]\nNow, let's bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Subtract \\( 11 \\) and add \\( 2x \\) to both sides:\nLeft side becomes: \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = x^2 - 6x + 5 \\)\nRight side becomes: 0\nSo, the quadratic equation is:\n\\[ x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\]\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. I can try factoring it, looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6.\n\nLet me list the factors of 5:\n1 and 5.\n\nHmm, 1 and 5. Since the middle term is -6x, both numbers should be negative because their sum is negative and their product is positive. So, the equation factors as:\n\\[ (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0 \\]\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n1. \\( x - 5 = 0 \\) => \\( x = 5 \\)\n2. \\( x - 1 = 0 \\) => \\( x = 1 \\)\n\nSo, the potential solutions are \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\). But as I mentioned earlier, I need to check these solutions in the original equation to make sure they don't result in any mathematical inconsistencies, especially because square roots can sometimes yield extraneous solutions.\n\nLet's test \\( x = 5 \\) first:\nOriginal equation:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\]\nSubstituting \\( x = 5 \\):\n\\[ 5 = \\sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4 \\]\nCalculate inside the square root:\n\\[ 11 - 10 = 1 \\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 5 = \\sqrt{1} + 4 \\]\nSimplify the square root:\n\\[ 5 = 1 + 4 \\]\n\\[ 5 = 5 \\]\nThat works. So, \\( x = 5 \\) is a valid solution.\n\nNow, testing \\( x = 1 \\):\nOriginal equation:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} +"
