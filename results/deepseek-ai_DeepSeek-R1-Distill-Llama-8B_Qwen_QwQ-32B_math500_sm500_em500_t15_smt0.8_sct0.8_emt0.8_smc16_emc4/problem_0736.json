The cube of 2 is 8.\n\nSo the equation becomes \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This gives \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\frac{72}{8}\\), I get 9. So now I have \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nSince 9 is equal to \\(3^2\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nFinally, because the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.
