Let me start by writing down what I know.\n\nGiven:\nz = 1 + i\nw = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7)\n\nAnd I need to find |w|, which is the modulus of w.\n\nFirst, I remember that the modulus of a complex number a + bi is calculated as sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, maybe I can find w first and then compute its modulus. Alternatively, I think there might be a property where |w| = |3z + 1| / |5z + 7|, since modulus has the property that |w| = |(3z +1)/(5z +7)| = |3z +1| / |5z +7|.\n\nHmm, that might save me some time instead of having to compute w first. Let me verify that property. Yeah, modulus is multiplicative, so |a/b| = |a| / |b|. So, that should work. Cool.\n\nSo, I just need to compute |3z + 1| and |5z + 7|, then divide them.\n\nGiven z = 1 + i, let's plug that into 3z + 1 and 5z + 7.\n\nStarting with 3z + 1:\n3z = 3*(1 + i) = 3*1 + 3*i = 3 + 3i\nSo, 3z + 1 = (3 + 3i) + 1 = 4 + 3i\n\nSimilarly, 5z +7:\n5z = 5*(1 + i) = 5*1 + 5*i = 5 + 5i\nSo, 5z +7 = (5 + 5i) +7 = 12 + 5i\n\nNow, I need to find the modulus of both 4 + 3i and 12 + 5i.\n\nCalculating |4 + 3i|:\nThat's sqrt(4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nAnd |12 + 5i|:\nThat's sqrt(12\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) = sqrt(144"

Let me double-check.\n\nCompute 3z + 1:\n3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i, then +1 gives 4 + 3i. Correct.\n\nCompute 5z +7:\n5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i, then +7 gives 12 + 5i. Correct.\n\nModuli:\nFor 4 + 3i, sqrt(16 + 9) is sqrt25 = 5. Correct.\n\nFor 12 +5i, sqrt(144 +25) is sqrt169 =13. Correct.\n\nSo, 5 / 13 is the modulus of w. Hmm, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute w first by substituting z into the expression and then compute the modulus.\n\nStarting with w = (3z +1)/(5z +7).\n\nCompute numerator: 3z +1 = 3*(1 +i) +1 = 3 +3i +1 =4 +3i.\n\nCompute denominator:5z +7 =5*(1 +i) +7 =5 +5i +7 =12 +5i.\n\nSo, w = (4 +3i)/(12 +5i). Now, to compute this, I would multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it.\n\nThe conjugate of 12 +5i is 12 -5i.\n\nSo, w = [(4 +3i)*(12 -5i)] / [(12 +5i)(12 -5i)]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(4 +3i)(12 -5i) = 4*12 + 4*(-5i) + 3i*12 + 3i*(-5i)\n= 48 -20i +36i -15i\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n=48 +16i -15(-1) [because i\u00b2 = -1]\n=48 +16i +15\n=63 +16i\n\nDenominator:\n\n(12 +5i)(12 -5i) = 12^2 - (5i)^2 = "

But earlier, I thought |w|=5/13. But 65/169 reduces to 5/13 because 65 \u00f713=5, and 169 \u00f713=13.\n\nSo, yes, |w| is 5/13.
