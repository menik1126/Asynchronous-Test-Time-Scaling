This leaves 9 remaining options for Camille.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - **Total Dishes Available:** 10 items on the menu.\n   - **Condition:** Yann and Camille refuse to order the **same** dish.\n   - **Importance of Order:** The order matters (Yann ordering Chicken and Camille ordering Fish is different from Yann ordering Fish and Camille ordering Chicken).\n\n2. **Calculate the Possible Choices for Yann:**\n   - Since there are 10 dishes, Yann has **10** possible options.\n\n3. **Calculate the Possible Choices for Camille After Yann's Choice:**\n   - After Yann has chosen a dish, Camille must choose a different dish.\n   - Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining options left.\n\n4. **Multiply the Choices:**\n   - To find the total number of different combinations, multiply Yann's choices by Camille's choices:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{90}\n   \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that the order of selection matters, which it does in this case. Hence, the total number of different meal combinations they can order is **90**."

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
