Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that we have a sequence \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\) of positive real numbers. The given conditions are:\n\n1. The sum of all the terms is 96:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i = 96\n   \\]\n2. The sum of the squares of the terms is 144:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2 = 144\n   \\]\n3. The sum of the cubes of the terms is 216:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^3 = 216\n   \\]\n\nAnd we need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, we're dealing with sums of powers of variables. This seems like it might be related to some kind of moment problem or perhaps using inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or H\u00f6lder's inequality. Alternatively, maybe it's about variance since we have sums of squares and cubes, which relate to moments.\n\nLet me think more carefully. Let's denote \\( S_1 = \\sum a_i = 96 \\), \\( S_2 = \\sum a_i^2 = 144 \\), and \\( S_3 = \\sum a_i^3 = 216 \\).\n\nI know that for a set of numbers, we can relate these sums to some variance-like measures. The variance \\( \\sigma^2 \\) is given by \\( \\frac{S_2}{n} - \\left( \\frac{S_1}{n} \\right)^2 \\). Maybe this can help us find some constraints on \\( n \\).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nVariance \\( \\sigma^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 \\).\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( \\sigma^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\frac{9216}{n^2} = \\frac{144n - 9216}{n^2} \\).\n\nSince variance is always non-negative"

Is there an upper bound?\n\nWell, perhaps from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or H\u00f6lder's inequality. Let me think.\n\nWe know that for positive real numbers, \\( (S_1)^3 \\leq S_3 \\times S_1 \\) or something? Wait, no, maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, let me recall that for any positive real numbers, by Cauchy-Schwarz, \\( (S_2)(S_1) \\geq (S_{1.5})^2 \\), where \\( S_{1.5} \\) is the sum of the 1.5 powers, but that might not be directly useful here.\n\nAlternatively, H\u00f6lder's inequality might be more useful here. H\u00f6lder's inequality states that for positive real numbers and exponents \\( p, q \\) such that \\( 1/p + 1/q = 1 \\), we have:\n\n\\( \\sum a_i b_i \\leq (\\sum a_i^p)^{1/p} (\\sum b_i^q)^{1/q} \\).\n\nBut I'm not sure yet how to apply this directly.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps assuming that all the \\( a_i \\) are equal.

Then, \\( S_2 = n*(96/n)^2 = (96^2)/n \\), and \\( S_3 = n*(96/n)^3 = (96^3)/n^2 \\).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nGiven \\( S_2 = 144 = 9216/n \\Rightarrow n = 9216 / 144 = 64 \\).\n\nSimilarly"

Wait, but if the variables are not all equal, then this might not hold.\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe the minimal case is when all variables are equal, but for our problem, it's the other way around.\n\nWait, no, the sum \\( S_1 \\) is fixed, so if all variables are equal, we can compute \\( n \\) from \\( S_1 \\) and see whether the other sums match. But in this case, if all variables are equal, n must be 64 because S2 would be 144 only if each a_i squared times n is 144, so 144 = n*(96/n)^2 = 96^2 /n, so n = 96^2 /144 = 9216 /144 = 64. Similarly, S3 would be 216? Let's check: 96^3 /64^2 = (96/64)^2 * 96 = (3/2)^2 *96= (9/4)*96= 216. Yes! Wait, that actually works.\n\nSo if all the a_i's are equal, each is 96/64=1.5, then S2=64*(1.5)^2=64*2.25=144, which matches, and S3=64*(1.5)^3=64*3.375=216, which also matches. So, in this case, n=64 is a possible value.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that we need the sum of all possible values of n. So, in this case, n=64 is possible, but is that the only possible n?\n\nBecause the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n\", which might imply that n could be other numbers as well.\n\nSo, how can n be different from 64? Well, if the numbers aren't all equal, we might have a different n. So, let's see.\n\nWait, but from the variance, we have n must be at least 64. So, could there be n greater than 64?
