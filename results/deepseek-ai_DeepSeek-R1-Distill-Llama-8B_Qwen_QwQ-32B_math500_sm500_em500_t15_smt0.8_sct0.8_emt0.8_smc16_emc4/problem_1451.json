Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I notice that the equation has two exponentials with different bases: 3 and 10. Since they have different bases, it might be tricky to solve directly. Maybe I can rewrite one of the terms to make the equation easier to handle.\n\nLooking at \\(3^{2x}\\), that's the same as \\((3^x)^2\\), right? So maybe I can let \\(y = 3^x\\) and \\(z = 10^x\\). But wait, that might complicate things because there are two variables now. Alternatively, maybe I can express both sides in terms of the same base or find a common term.\n\nLet me try substituting \\(y = 3^x\\). Then \\(y^2 = 3^{2x}\\). So substituting into the equation, I get \\(y^2 + 19 = 10^x\\). Hmm, but \\(10^x\\) is another variable, so maybe I can express that in terms of \\(y\\) or another substitution.\n\nWait, since \\(y = 3^x\\), I can take the natural logarithm on both sides to get \\(x = \\frac{\\ln y}{\\ln 3}\\). Similarly, \\(10^x = e^{x \\ln 10} = e^{(\\ln y / \\ln 3) \\ln 10}\\). That seems complicated, but maybe I can write it in terms of \\(y\\).\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation: \\(y^2 + 19 = e^{(\\ln y / \\ln 3) \\ln 10}\\). Hmm, that looks like \\(y^2 + 19 = e^{\\frac{\\ln y \\cdot \\ln 10}{\\ln 3}}\\). \n\nWait, \\(\\frac{\\ln 10}{\\ln 3}\\) is a constant. Let me calculate that: \\(\\ln 10 \\approx 2.3026\\) and \\(\\ln 3 \\approx 1.0986\\), so dividing those gives approximately 2.095. So, \\(e^{2.095}\\) is roughly \\(8.13\\). So, the equation becomes \\(y^2 + 19"

Hmm, that's still a transcendental equation, which might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I need to try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking logarithms on both sides? Let me see. The original equation is \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\). If I take the natural log of both sides, I get \\(\\ln(3^{2x} + 19) = \\ln(10^x)\\). But the left side is a logarithm of a sum, which doesn't split into separate terms, so that might not help directly.\n\nHmm, maybe trying to test some integer values for x to see if they satisfy the equation? Let's try x=0: \n\nLeft side: \\(3^{0} +19 =1 +19=20\\). Right side: \\(10^0=1\\). Not equal.\n\nx=1: Left: 3^2 +19=9+19=28. Right:10^1=10. Not equal.\n\nx=2: Left: 3^4 +19=81+19=100. Right:10^2=100. Oh! Wait, that works. So x=2 is a solution.\n\nWait, so x=2 is a solution. Let me check x=3: Left: 3^6 +19=729+19=748. Right:10^3=1000. Not equal. \n\nx=1.5: Let's see. 3^(3) +19=27+19=46. 10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)=~31.62. Not equal.\n\nHmm, so x=2 is a solution.

I want to find where f(x)=0.\n\nCompute f(2)=3^4 +19 -100=81+19-100=0.\n\nNow, let's see behavior for x>2: 3^{2x} grows faster than 10^x, so f(x) would become positive and increase. For x approaching infinity, 3^{2x} dominates, so f(x) tends to infinity.\n\nFor x slightly less than 2, say x=1.9: 3^{3.8}\u2248 3^3 *3^0.8\u224827 * 2.408\u224864.8. 64.8 +19\u224883.8. 10^{1.9}\u224810^2 / 10^{0.1}=100 / 1.258\u224879.4. So f(1.9)=83.8 -79.4\u22484.4>0.\n\nWait, but at x=1.9, f(x) is positive but less than at x=2? Wait, no, at x=2, f(x)=0. So, if f(1.9)= ~4.4, then let me see what happens as x approaches 2 from the left.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another solution between x= somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps for x less than 2.

Let me check x=2.1:\n\n3^{4.2}=3^4 *3^0.2\u224881 *1.2457\u2248100.8. 10^2.1\u224810^2 *10^0.1\u2248100*1.258\u2248125.8. So f(2.1)=100.8+19 -125.8\u2248120 -125.8\u2248-5.8 <0.\n\nAh! So at x=2.1, f(x) is negative. So between x=2 and x=2.1, the function goes from 0 to negative. Wait, but at x=2, it's zero, then at x=2.1 it's negative. So maybe there's another root between x=2 and x=2.1?\n\nWait, but when x approaches infinity, f(x) tends to infinity again. Wait, let me check at x=3, f(3)=3^6 +19 -1000=729+19-1000= -252. Hmm, so at x=3, it's negative. Wait, but as x increases beyond 2, 3^{2x} is 9^x, and 10^x is 10^x. Since 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so for large x, 10^x will dominate, so f(x) would go to negative infinity? Wait, no, 9^x vs 10^x: 10^x grows faster, so 10^x will eventually dominate, so 3^{2x} +19 -10^x will go to negative infinity as x approaches infinity. Wait, so maybe after some point, it becomes negative again?\n\nWait, but at x=5, 3^{10}=59049, 10^5=100000"

So the function is positive for x<2, zero at x=2, then becomes negative, and tends to negative infinity as x approaches infinity. So the only solution is x=2? But wait, when I tried x=2.1, f(x) was negative, and at x=3, it's more negative. So does that mean there's only one real solution at x=2?\n\nWait, but let me check for x>2: Let me check x=4: 3^8 +19 -10^4=6561 +19 -10000\u2248 -6320 <0.\n\nSo f(x) is negative for x>2. Therefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another solution for x<2. Maybe for x negative? Let's try x=-1: 3^{-2} +19 -10^{-1}=1/9 +19 -0.1\u22480.111+19-0.1\u224819.011>0.\n\nx=-2: 3^{-4} +19 -10^{-2}=1/81 +19 -0.01\u22480.012 +19 -0.01\u224819.002>0.\n\nSo for x negative, it's positive as well. So the function f(x)=3^{2x} +19 -10^x is positive for x<2, zero at x=2, and negative for x>2.\n\nSo is there another solution? Let me think, maybe between x=2 and x approaching infinity, but f(x) is negative, so no.\n\nWait, but is it possible that f(x) could cross zero again? Because sometimes with exponentials, functions can cross back up, but in this case, 10^x grows faster than 3^{2x}, so for x>2, 10^x will dominate and f(x) will stay negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for x between 0 and 2? But we've checked x=0,1,1.5,2, and it's always positive except at x=2, where it's zero.\n\nSo perhaps x=2 is the only real solution.\n\nWait, but let"

So the only point where f(x)=0 is at x=2. Therefore, the solution is x=2.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Let me try x=1.99:\n\n3^{3.98} \u22483^(4 -0.02)=3^4 *3^{-0.02}\u224881 *0.993\u224880.4. So 80.4 +19=99.4. 10^1.99\u224810^(2 -0.01)=100 *10^{-0.01}\u2248100*0.977\u224897.7.
