The original equation is:\n\n(3)5\u00b2 - 4(5 - a)\u00b2 \u00f7 3 = 63\n\nI notice that the division by 3 can be combined with the first term:\n\n(3 \u00d7 5\u00b2) - (4 \u00f7 3)(5 - a)\u00b2 = 63\n\nCalculating 3 \u00d7 5\u00b2:\n\n3 \u00d7 25 = 75\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n75 - (4/3)(5 - a)\u00b2 = 63\n\nNext, I'll isolate the term with the squared term by subtracting 75 from both sides:\n\n- (4/3)(5 - a)\u00b2 = 63 - 75\n- (4/3)(5 - a)\u00b2 = -12\n\nThen, I'll multiply both sides by -1 to make the equation positive:\n\n(4/3)(5 - a)\u00b2 = 12\n\nNow, I'll solve for (5 - a)\u00b2 by dividing both sides by 4/3:\n\n(5 - a)\u00b2 = 12 \u00d7 (3/4)\n(5 - a)\u00b2 = 9\n\nTo find the values of a, I'll take the square root of both sides:\n\n5 - a = \u00b13\n\nThis gives me two possible equations:\n\n1) 5 - a = 3\n2) 5 - a = -3\n\nFor the first equation:\n\n5 - a = 3\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n-a = -2\nMultiply both sides by -1:\na = 2\n\nFor the second equation:\n\n5 - a = -3\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n-a = -8\nMultiply both sides by -1:\na = 8\n\nSo, the values of a that satisfy the equation are 2 and 8. Adding these together:\n\n2 + 8 = 10\n\nTherefore, the sum of the values of a is 10.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\((3)5^2 - 4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the equation**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5^2 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(3 \\times"
