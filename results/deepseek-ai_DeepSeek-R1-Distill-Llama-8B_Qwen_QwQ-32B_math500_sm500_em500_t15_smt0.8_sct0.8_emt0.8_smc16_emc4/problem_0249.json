Checking for common factors between the numerator and the denominator, I notice that both 31 and 11111 are prime numbers, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.\n\nNext, I perform the division \\( 31 \\div 11111 \\) to find the decimal representation. Using long division, I divide 31 by 11111 and observe the decimal that results from this division.\n\nDuring the long division process, I carefully track the remainder after each division step. It becomes evident that the division process starts to repeat after a certain number of steps, indicating the onset of a repeating decimal.\n\nFinally, I identify how many digits are repeating in the decimal. By analyzing the sequence of digits that repeat indefinitely, I determine the exact number of digits that form the repeating cycle.\n</think>\n\nLet's convert \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) to a decimal step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Fraction\nFirst, check if the fraction can be simplified. Since 31 is a prime number and 11111 is also a prime number (or at least not divisible by 31), the fraction \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) cannot be simplified further.\n\n### Step 2: Perform Long Division\nTo convert \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) to a decimal, perform the division \\( 31 \\div 11111 \\).\n\n1. **Set Up the Division**:\n   - **Dividend**: 31.000000...\n   - **Divisor**: 11111\n\n2. **Divide 31 by 11111**:\n   - Since 31 is less than 11111, the quotient starts with 0.\n   - Append a decimal point and add zeros to the dividend: 31.000000...\n\n3. **Perform the Division**:\n   - **First Step**:\n     - \\( 11111 \\times 0.0028 = 31 \\)\n   - **Second Step**:\n     - Subtract 31 from 31, resulting in 0.\n   - **Third Step**:\n     - Bring down a 0, making the dividend 0.00.\n\n4. **Identify the Repeating Cycle**:\n   - The remainder after the first division is 0, indicating that the decimal terminates.\n  "

Let me try again.\n\n1. **First Step**:\n   - 31 divided by 11111 is 0.000279017... (since 11111 \u00d7 0.000279 \u2248 3.1). Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\n2. **Alternative Approach**:\n   - The length of the repeating cycle of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) is the smallest integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 10^{k - m} \\mod n \\), where \\( m \\) is the length of the non-repeating part. Since 11111 is co-prime with 10 (as it doesn't have 2 or 5 as factors), the decimal is purely repeating.\n\n3. **Find the Period**:\n   - The period (repeating cycle length) of \\( \\frac{1}{11111} \\) is the order of 10 modulo 11111. We need the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod 11111 \\).\n\n4. **Factorize 11111**:\n   - 11111 divided by small primes: 11111 \u00f7 41 = 271 (since 41 \u00d7 271 = 11111). Thus, 11111 = 41 \u00d7 271.\n\n5. **Euler's Theorem**:\n   - Euler's totient function \u03c6(11111) = \u03c6(41 \u00d7 271) = \u03c6(41) \u00d7 \u03c6(271) = (40)(270) = 10800.\n   - The order of 10 modulo 11111 divides \u03c6(11111) = 10800. We need the smallest \\( k \\) dividing 10800 such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\"
