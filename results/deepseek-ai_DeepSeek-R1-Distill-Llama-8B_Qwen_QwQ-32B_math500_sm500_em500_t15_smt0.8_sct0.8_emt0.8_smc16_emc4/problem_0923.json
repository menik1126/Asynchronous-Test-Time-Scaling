The goal is to minimize the number of integers while keeping them as small as possible.\n\nConsidering the factors:\n- 7 is a prime number and cannot be broken down further.\n- 3 is also a prime number and cannot be factored.\n- 2 \u00d7 2 equals 4, which is already a composite number.\n\nI can rearrange the factors to form different sets:\n1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7 = 84\n   - Sum: 17\n\n2. 1, 2, 3, 7\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 = 42\n   - This doesn't reach 84, so additional factors are needed.\n\n3. 1, 2, 4, 7\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7 = 56\n   - Still less than 84.\n\n4. 1, 3, 4, 7\n   - Product: 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 7 = 84\n   - Sum: 15\n\nComparing the sums, the set 1, 3, 4, 7 results in the smallest sum of 15.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize 84 into its prime components\nFirst, let's break down 84 into prime factors:\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\nThis can also be written as:\n\\[\n84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Form sets of distinct positive integers\nOur goal is to create a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84.

Therefore, we need to combine some factors:\n- Combine the two 2s into 4 (since \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)), resulting in the set \\{2, 3, 4, 7\\}.\n- The product is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 7 = 168\\), which is too large.\n\n#### Option 2: Introduce 1 to reduce the number of factors\nIncluding 1 allows us to use smaller numbers without increasing the product excessively:\n- Consider the set \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 7\\}:\n  - Product: \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 7 = 168\\) (still too large).\n- Adjust by combining factors differently:\n  - Combine 2 and 3 into 6, resulting in \\{1, 2, 6, 7\\}:\n    - Product: \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 84\\).\n    - Sum: \\(1 + 2 + 6 + 7 = 16\\).\n\n#### Option 3: Optimize further\nAnother combination:\n- Combine 2 and 2 into 4, and keep 3 and 7:\n  - Set \\{1, 3, 4, 7\\}:\n    - Product: \\(1 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 7 = 84\\).\n    - Sum: \\(1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15\\).\n\n### Step 3: Compare sums of valid sets\nThe valid sets and their sums are:\n- \\{1, 2, 6, 7\\}: Sum = 16\n- \\{1, 3, 4, 7\\}: Sum = 15\n\nThe smallest sum is 15.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe least possible sum of these integers is \\boxed{15}."
