            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where there's a hot-air balloon H above point O. There are four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. HA is 150 m, HB is 130 m, HC is 150 m, and HD is 130 m. The points A, B, C, and D are positioned directly north, west, south, and east of O, respectively. The distance between C and D is 140 m. The goal is to replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP to reduce the total length of rope used. We need to find the greatest length that can be saved.\n\nFirst, I imagine a coordinate system where O is at the origin (0,0). So, A is north of O, which would be at (0, a) where 'a' is some positive distance. Similarly, B is west of O, so at (-b, 0), C is south of O at (0, -c), and D is east of O at (d, 0). But wait, the problem says A is directly north of O, B directly west, and so on. But it also gives the distance between C and D as 140 m. Since C is at (0, -c) and D is at (d, 0), the distance between them would be sqrt(d^2 + c^2) = 140. So, that's one equation: d\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 140\u00b2.\n\nNow, the balloon H is directly above O, so its coordinates would be (0, h) where h is the height above the ground.\n\nRopes HA, HB, HC, and HD connect H to A, B, C, and D respectively. The lengths of HA, HB, HC, and HD are given as 150 m, 130 m, 150 m, and 130 m, respectively. So, using the distance formula, we can write:\n\nHA: distance from H to A is 150 m. Since A is at (0, a), the distance from H(0, h) to A is |h - a| = 150. Similarly, HB is the distance from H to B, which is at (-b, 0). So, the distance is sqrt( (-b - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2 ) = sqrt(b\u00b2 + h\u00b2) = 130.\n\nSimilarly"

Let me check: If C is directly south of O, then C is at (0, -c), so the vertical distance from H(0, h) to C is h + c. Therefore, HC length is h + c = 150.\n\nSimilarly, HD is the distance from H to D, which is at (d, 0). So that's sqrt( (d)^2 + h^2 ) = 130.\n\nWait a second, so:\n\nFor HA: Since A is directly north of O, which is at (0, a), then the distance from H (0, h) to A is |h - a|. But H is above O, so if O is on the ground, A is also on the ground? Wait, the problem says \"five points lie on a flat field\", so all points except H are on the ground, and H is in the air above O. Therefore, A's coordinates are (0, a), O is (0,0), so the distance between H(0, h) and A(0, a) is vertical distance |h - a|. Wait, but the problem says \"the balloon is held in place by four ropes HA, HB, HC, and HD\". So HA is the rope from H to A on the ground. Since A is north of O, the distance HA is the length of that rope, which would be the straight line distance between H and A, so sqrt( (0 - 0)^2 + (a - h)^2 ), which is |a - h|. Similarly, HB is distance from H to B at (-b, 0): sqrt( (b)^2 + (h)^2 ) = 130.\n\nWait, let me verify coordinates again. Let me set coordinates:\n\nLet me fix O as (0,0). Then:\n\n- A is directly north of O, so along positive y-axis: (0, a)\n\n- B is directly west of O, so along negative x-axis: (-b, 0)\n\n- C is directly south of O, so along negative"

We need to find the optimal point P on CD to replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, such that the total rope length used (HA + HB + HP) is minimized.\n\nWait, no, because the problem says that HA and HB are still present, but HC and HD are to be replaced by HP.

The minimal length of HP is the straight-line distance from H to CD. So the minimal HP would be the perpendicular distance from H to CD. Then, the maximum rope saved would be 280 - minimal_HP.\n\nWait, but in reality, we can't have P exactly where H's perpendicular meets CD if that point is not on CD, but since CD is a straight line, and H is not on CD, the minimal distance would be the perpendicular from H to CD.\n\nWait, but let's check: CD is"
