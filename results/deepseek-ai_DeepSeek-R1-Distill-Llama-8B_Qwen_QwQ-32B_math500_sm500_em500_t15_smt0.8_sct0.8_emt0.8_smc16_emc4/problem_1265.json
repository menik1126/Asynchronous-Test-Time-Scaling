This allows me to rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll simplify the right side of the equation. When a power is raised to another power, I multiply the exponents. So, \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, which gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a power of 2:**\n   \n   \\(256 = 2^8\\)\n\n2. **Substitute into the equation:**\n   \n   \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\)\n\n3. **Simplify the exponent on the right side:**\n   \n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same:**\n   \n   \\(2x = 4\\)\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   \\(x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
