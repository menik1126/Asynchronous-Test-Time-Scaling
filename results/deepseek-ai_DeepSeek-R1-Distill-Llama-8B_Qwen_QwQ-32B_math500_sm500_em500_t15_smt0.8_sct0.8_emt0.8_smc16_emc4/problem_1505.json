            "output": "First, I need to determine how many different letters can be used for the first part of the license plate. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, from A to Z. Since each letter must be different, the number of possible combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, I'll consider the numbers that can follow the letters. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9), and each digit must also be different from the other. This means the number of possible combinations for the digits is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of unique license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations. This will give the final count of possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of possible license plates, we'll break the problem into two parts: the **letter** portion and the **number** portion.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the number of possible combinations for the letters.\n- **Total letters available:** 26 (A through Z)\n- **Condition:** Every license plate must have **2 different letters**.\n  \n  For the first letter, there are **26** possible choices.  \n  For the second letter, since it must be different from the first, there are **25** possible choices.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Letter combinations} = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of possible combinations for the numbers.\n- **Total digits available:** 10 (0 through 9)\n- **Condition:** Every license plate must have **2 different numbers**.\n  \n  For the first number, there are **10** possible choices.  \n  For the second number, since it must be different from the first, there are **9** possible choices.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Number combinations} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total number of possible license plates.\n- **Total letter combinations** \\(\\times\\) **Total number combinations** = \n  \\[\n  650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n  \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{58,\\!500}\n\\]"
