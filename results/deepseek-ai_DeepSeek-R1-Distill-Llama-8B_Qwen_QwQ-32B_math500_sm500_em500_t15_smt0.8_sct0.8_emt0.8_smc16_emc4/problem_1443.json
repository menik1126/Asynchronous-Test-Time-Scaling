            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst off, I notice that both terms on the left side are exponential functions. 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, which is 9^x. So I can rewrite the equation as 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That looks a bit simpler, right?\n\nNow, both sides are exponential functions with different bases: 9 and 10. I remember that exponential functions can sometimes be tricky to solve algebraically, especially when the bases are different. Maybe I can take the logarithm of both sides? But I'm not sure how that would work with the addition of 19.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes these equations can be solved by substitution or graphing. Let me see if I can find a substitution that makes this equation easier. If I let y = 10^x, then 9^x can be written as (9/10)^x * 10^x. Hmm, but that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express both sides in terms of the same base. But 9 and 10 are co-prime, so maybe that's not straightforward. Alternatively, I can take logarithms on both sides, but the addition of 19 complicates things.\n\nSo, maybe I should try plugging in some integer values for x to see if I can find a solution by trial and error. Let's try x=0: 3^{0} + 19 = 1 + 19 = 20, and 10^0=1. So 20 vs 1, not equal.\n\nHow about x=1: 3^{2} + 19 = 9 + 19 = 28, and 10^1=10. 28 vs 10, not equal.\n\nx=2: 3^{4}=81, so 81 + 19=100, and 10^2=100. Oh! That works. So x=2 is a solution.\n\nWait, is that the only solution? Let me check x=3: 3^6=729, 729 +19=748, and 10^3=1000. So 748 vs 1000"

Not equal.\n\nSo, it seems like x=2 is a solution. But is it the only one? Let me think. \n\nConsider the function f(x) = 9^x +19 -10^x. I want to find when f(x)=0.\n\nI can analyze the behavior of f(x) as x approaches infinity and negative infinity.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, 9^x grows exponentially but slower than 10^x. So 9^x -10^x will dominate, and since it's subtracted, f(x) tends to negative infinity.\n\nAs x approaches negative infinity, 9^x approaches zero, 10^x approaches zero, so f(x) approaches 19, which is positive.\n\nSo, the function f(x) crosses from positive to negative as x increases. Since we found x=2 is a solution, maybe it's the only real solution. But wait, let's check if there's another crossing point.\n\nLet me check x=0: f(0)=1+19 -1=19>0.\n\nx=1: f(1)=9 +19 -10=18>0.\n\nx=2: 81 +19 -100=0.\n\nx=3: 729 +19 -1000=748-1000=-252<0.\n\nSo from x=1 to x=2, f(x) goes from positive to zero. It doesn't cross zero more than once because after x=2, it's decreasing further.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe between x= -1 and x=0: f(-1)=1/9 +19 -1/10≈19.111 -0.1≈19.011>0.\n\nx=0: f(0)=19>0. So it doesn't cross zero in negative x.\n\nSo, seems like x=2 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the derivative to see the function's behavior.\n\nf(x)=9^x +19 -10^x.\n\nf'(x)=ln"

So f'(2)=178 -230≈-52, which is negative. So the function is decreasing at x=2, which makes sense.\n\nSince the function is decreasing after x=2, and before x=2, let's see at x=1, f'(1)= ln9*9 - ln10*10 ≈2.197*9≈19.77 and 2.302*10≈23.02. So 19.77-23.02≈-3.25. So even at x=1, the derivative is negative. Wait, so the function is decreasing throughout?\n\nWait, but when x approaches negative infinity, the function tends to 19, and at x=0 it's 19, so maybe the function is always decreasing?\n\nWait, let me check the derivative at x=0: f'(0)= ln9*1 - ln10*1 ≈2.197 -2.302≈-0.105. So negative. So the function is always decreasing?\n\nWait, so if the function is always decreasing, then it can cross zero at most once. Since it goes from 19 at x=-infty to negative infinity as x approaches infinity, so it must cross zero exactly once. Since we found x=2, that's the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x=2.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again. Let me check x=1.5. Let's compute f(1.5):\n\n9^1.5 = sqrt(9^3) = sqrt(729)=27. So 27? Wait, no, 9^1.5 is 9^(3/2)= (9^(1/2))^3=3^3=27. So 27 +19"

Let me compute that.\n\n1.732^2≈3, 1.732^3≈5.196, 1.732^4≈9, 1.732^5≈15.588, 1.732^6≈27, 1.732^7≈46.7. So 9^1.75≈46.7. So 46.7 +19=65.7, and 10^1.75≈10^(7/4)=10^1 *10^(3/4). 10^(1/4)=~1.778, so 10^(3/4)=1.778^3≈5.623. So 10^1.75≈1.778*5.623*10≈10. So wait, 10^1.75=10^(7/4)= (10^(1/4))^7? No, wait, 10^(7/4)=10^(1 + 3/4)=10 *10^(3/4). As I computed, 10^(3/4)=~5.623, so 10^1.75=10*5.623≈56.23.\n\nSo f(1.75)=65.7 -56.23≈9.47>0.\n\nx=1.9: 9^1.9≈? Let's see, 9^1=9, 9^2=81. Let me take natural log: ln(9^1.9)=1.9 ln9≈1.9*2.197≈4.178. So 9^1.9≈e^{4.178}= 57.2 (since e^4≈54.6, e^4.178≈57.2).\n\nSo 57.2 +19=76"

So yes, that seems to solidify that x=2 is the solution.\n\nAlternatively, I can use logarithms, but the presence of 19 complicates it. Let's try.\n\nGiven 9^x +19 =10^x.\n\nRearrange: 10^x -9^x=19.\n\nI can write this as (10/9)^x -1=19/(10^x).\n\nHmm, but I don't know if that helps much. Let me let t=(10/9)^x. Then t -1=19/(10^x). But 10^x= (10/9)^x *9^x= t*9^x. So 19/(t*9^x)=?\n\nWait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps take logs on both sides, but since it's addition, it's not straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I can write it as 10^x -9^x=19, and then factor it as (10 -9)(10^{x-1} + something), but I don't think that factorization is straightforward, since a^2 -b^2= (a -b)(a + b). But here it's a^x -b^x, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take logs after moving terms around:\n\n10^x =9^x +19.\n\nDivide both sides by 9^x: (10/9)^x=1 +19/(9^x).\n\nHmm. Let me set t=(10/9)^x. Then 1 +19/(9^x)=1 +19 e^{(x ln(1/9))} because 9^x= e^{x ln9}, so 1/9^x= e^{-x ln9}= e^{x ln(1/9)}.\n\nWait, maybe that's too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take natural logs on both sides, but since it's 10^x=9^x +19"

But since we already found x=2 is an exact solution, and the function is strictly decreasing, so that's the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is x=2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we start by rewriting \\(3^{2x}\\) as \\(9^x\\). This transforms the equation into:\n\n\\[\n9^x + 19 = 10^x\n\\]\n\nWe then test integer values for \\(x\\):\n\n- For \\(x = 0\\): \\(9^0 + 19 = 1 + 19 = 20\\) and \\(10^0 = 1\\), which are not equal.\n- For \\(x = 1\\): \\(9^1 + 19 = 9 + 19 = 28\\) and \\(10^1 = 10\\), which are not equal.\n- For \\(x = 2\\): \\(9^2 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100\\) and \\(10^2 = 100\\), which are equal. Thus, \\(x = 2\\) is a solution.\n\nNext, we analyze the function \\(f(x) = 9^x + 19 - 10^x\\) to determine if there are other solutions:\n\n- As \\(x \\to \\infty\\), \\(9^x\\) grows slower than \\(10^x\\), so \\(f(x) \\to -\\infty\\).\n- As \\(x \\to -\\infty\\), both \\(9^x\\) and \\(10^x\\) approach 0, so \\(f(x) \\to 19\\).\n\nWe check the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) at key points:\n- \\(f(0) = 19\\), \\(f(1) = 18\\), \\(f(2) = 0\\), \\(f(3) = -252\\"
