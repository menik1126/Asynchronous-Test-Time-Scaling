Since 256 is a power of 2, specifically \\(2^8\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the exponentiation rule that states \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). This simplifies the right side to \\(2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\). Using the property that if \\(a^b = a^c\\), then \\(b = c\\) (since the bases are the same and positive), I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a power of 2:**\n   \n   We know that \\(256 = 2^8\\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the exponentiation rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\):**\n   \n   Using this rule,\n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \n   Since the bases are the same and both sides are equal, the exponents must be equal:\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} ="
