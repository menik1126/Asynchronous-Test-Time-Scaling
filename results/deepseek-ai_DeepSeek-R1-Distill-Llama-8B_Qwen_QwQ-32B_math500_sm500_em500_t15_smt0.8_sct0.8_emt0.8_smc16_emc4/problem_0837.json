Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what exactly the problem is asking. I need to maximize this fraction, which means I need to make the numerator as large as possible while keeping the denominator from getting too big. So, intuitively, I want \\(x - y\\) to be big and \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\) to be as small as possible. But of course, these two things are connected because both involve \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), so I can't just independently maximize the numerator without considering the denominator.\n\nMaybe I should consider some substitution or some symmetry here. Let me think about whether setting \\(x = y\\) would help. If \\(x = y\\), then the numerator becomes zero, which isn't helpful because we want it to be as large as possible. So, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can't be equal. Alternatively, maybe I can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) or vice versa.\n\nWhat if I set \\(y = x - k\\) where \\(k\\) is some positive number? Then the numerator becomes \\(k\\), which is positive. The denominator becomes \\(x^4 + (x - k)^4 + 6\\). Hmm, but this might complicate things further. Maybe there's a better substitution or a different approach.\n\nAnother thought: since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are in the equation, perhaps I can use polar coordinates or something similar, but that might be overcomplicating things. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the problem in terms of variables that can be separated or where some function is minimized.\n\nWait, perhaps using calculus would be the way to go. If I can treat this as a function of two variables, \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\), then I can try to find its critical points by taking partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), setting them equal to zero.\n\nOkay, let's try that.

Well, since we are only considering real numbers, \\(y = -x\\) is the only solution. So, these are the only critical points.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the behavior of the function as \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) go to infinity. What happens as \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) becomes very large?\n\nLooking at the function \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\), as \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) become very large in magnitude, the denominator grows much faster than the numerator, so the entire function tends to zero. Therefore, no maximum or minimum in the limit as variables go to infinity.\n\nAlso, in the case where either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) is very large, the function approaches zero, so the maximum cannot be achieved there. Hence, the critical points we found earlier are where the maximum could be.\n\nLet me check another point just to be safe. For example, if \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 0\\), then \\(f(0, 0) = 0\\), which is less than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). If \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = -1\\), numerator is \\(3\\), denominator is \\(16 + 1 + 6 = 23\\), so \\(f = \\frac{3}{23} \\approx 0.13\\), which is less than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nWhat if \\(x = y\\)?"

Alternatively, perhaps that's not the way. Wait, no, actually, since we are maximizing f(x, y), and f is a function of x and y, we can treat it as an unconstrained optimization problem.\n\nWait, so earlier I took partial derivatives and found critical points, leading to the maximum at (1, -1). So, that might be sufficient.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, I should also check second derivatives to ensure that these critical points are indeed maxima. However, computing the second derivatives might be cumbersome, but let me at least check around the point (1, -1) whether it's a maximum.\n\nAlternatively, since we saw that at (1, -1), the function is 1/4, and elsewhere it's less, we can feel confident that it's the maximum.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking and checking different approaches and points, I believe that the maximum value of the given expression is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum value is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the maximum value of the expression \n\n\\[\n\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\n\\]\n\nover all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we start by considering the function \n\n\\[\nf(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\n\\]\n\nWe use calculus to find the critical points by taking partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and setting them to zero.
