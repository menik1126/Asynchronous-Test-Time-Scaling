So, I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) gives \\( 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\).\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). To find the number of real solutions, I'll calculate the discriminant using the quadratic formula: \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant: \\( D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\).\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (\\( D > 0 \\)), there are two distinct real solutions for \\( y \\). Therefore, the graph has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of **y-intercepts** of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand What a Y-Intercept Is\nA **y-intercept** occurs where the graph crosses the **y-axis**. At this point, the **x-coordinate** is **0**. Therefore, to find the y-intercepts, set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the Equation\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Quadratic Equation\nThe equation is a quadratic in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny^2 - 4y - 1 = 0\n\\]\nTo find the number of real solutions, calculate the discriminant (\\( D \\)) using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\n\\[\nD = (-4)^2 - 4(1)("
