I need to find the number of different possible rational roots for this polynomial. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that for any polynomial with integer coefficients, the Rational Root Theorem can help identify all possible rational roots. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nSo, in this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. That means the possible values for \\(p\\), which are factors of 1, are just \\(\\pm1\\). And for \\(q\\), which are factors of 2, are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\). \n\nWait, so \\(p\\) is 1 or -1, and \\(q\\) can be 1, 2, -1, or -2. Therefore, the possible rational roots are \\(\\frac{1}{1}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(-\\frac{1}{1}\\), \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{1}\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{-1}\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{-2}\\), etc. But actually, since \\(\\frac{1}{-1}\\) is just -1, and \\(\\frac{-1}{-2}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), so we might need to list out all unique possibilities without repetition.\n\nLet me list them systematically:\n\n1. \\(p = 1\\): possible roots are \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n2. \\(p = -1\\): possible roots are \\(\\frac{-1}{1} = -1\\) and \\(\\frac{-1}{2}\\).\n\nSo considering all combinations of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), the possible rational roots are \\(1\\), \\(-1\\), \\(\\frac"

            "output": "{1}{2}\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). Are these all unique? Yes, 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2\u2014four distinct possible rational roots.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The polynomial is of degree 4, so theoretically, there could be up to 4 roots, but since it's not specified if they're all real or complex, but the question is specifically about the number of different possible rational roots.\n\nSo the possible rational roots are limited by the factors of the constant term and the leading coefficient as per the Rational Root Theorem. So as I listed earlier, it's 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That's four possible rational roots.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing another possible value for \\(p\\) or \\(q\\)? Let me double-check. The constant term is 1, so the factors are just 1 and -1. The leading coefficient is 2, whose factors are 1, 2, -1, -2. So the possible denominators \\(q\\) are 1 and 2, but when considering both positive and negative denominators, it's still 1 and 2, because negative denominators just result in negative versions of the numerator.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of unique fractions. Since \\(p\\) is a factor of 1, and \\(q\\) is a factor of 2, the possible \\(p/q\\) are:\n\n- For \\(q = 1\\): \\(p = \\pm1\\), so \\(\\pm1\\).\n- For \\(q = 2\\): \\(p = \\pm1\\), so \\(\\pm1/2\\).\n\nThat gives four possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, there are 4 different possible rational roots.\n\nI don't think I'm missing any other possibilities because any other \\(q\\) would have to be a divisor of 2, and 2's divisors are only 1 and 2, considering positive and negative. Similarly, the constant term 1 has only 1 and -1 as divisors. So, that covers all the bases.\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n</think>"
