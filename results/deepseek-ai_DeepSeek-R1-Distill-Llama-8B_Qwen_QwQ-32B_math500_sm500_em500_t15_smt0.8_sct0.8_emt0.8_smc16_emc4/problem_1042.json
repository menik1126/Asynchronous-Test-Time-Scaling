Hmm, okay. I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem from algebra class. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational solution, or root, of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients is of the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term, and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. So, I need to figure out what possible values \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) can take here.\n\nLooking at the given polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. That means:\n\n- \\(p\\) can be any factor of 1.\n- \\(q\\) can be any factor of 2.\n\nFirst, let's list the factors of 1. Well, 1 only has one positive factor, which is 1 itself, and considering negative numbers as well, it's -1. So, possible values for \\(p\\) are 1 and -1.\n\nNext, the factors of 2 are 1, -1, 2, and -2. So, possible values for \\(q\\) are 1, -1, 2, and -2.\n\nNow, using the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of 1 and \\(q\\) is a factor of 2. Let's calculate each possible combination.\n\nStarting with \\(p = 1\\):\n\n- Divided by \\(q = 1\\): \\(1/1 = 1\\)\n- Divided by \\(q = -1\\): \\(1/(-1) = -1\\)\n- Divided by \\(q = 2\\): \\(1/2\\)\n- Divided by \\(q = -2\\): \\(1/(-2) = -1/2\\)\n\nNow, with \\(p = -1\\):\n\n- Divided by \\(q = 1\\): \\(-1/1 = -1\\)\n- Divided by \\(q = -1"

For example, 1 and -1 appear both from \\(p = 1\\) and \\(p = -1\\). So, we need to compile the list without duplicates.\n\nListing all the unique possible rational roots:\n\nFrom \\(p = 1\\): 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2\n\nFrom \\(p = -1\\): -1, 1, -1/2, 1/2\n\nCombining these, the unique possibilities are: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nWait, is that all? Let me double-check. Are there any other factors of 1 or 2 that I might have missed? \n\nFactors of 1: ±1.\n\nFactors of 2: ±1, ±2.\n\nWait a second, could \\(q\\) also be 2 and -2? Because in this case, \\(p\\) is 1 or -1, so when \\(q\\) is 2, the possible roots are ±1/2. Similarly, when \\(q\\) is -2, they are ∓1/2, but those are also already covered in the ±1/2.\n\nSo that leaves us with 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2 as the possible rational roots.\n\nLet me count them: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That makes four different possible rational roots.\n\nSo, the number of different possible rational roots is 4. I think that's it. But just to make sure, is there any chance I missed another possible rational root?\n\nWait, could the polynomial have other roots? For example, could 2x^4 +... +1 have roots like 2 or -2? Let's see. If we plug in x=2:\n\n2*(16) + a3*(8) + a2*(4) + a1*(2) + 1 = 0.\n\nWhich is 32 + 8a3 + 4a2 + 2a1 + 1 = 0"

But the question is asking for possible rational roots, not whether they actually exist. The Rational Root Theorem just gives possible candidates, so even if some of them can't be roots for certain coefficients, the possible candidates are still those four. So even if, say, 2 can't be a root because of the coefficients, the theorem still lists it as a possible candidate? Wait, no, actually, according to the theorem, the possible candidates are only those fractions where numerator divides the constant term and denominator divides the leading coefficient. Since 2 is a factor of the leading coefficient (2), but the numerator would have to be a factor of 1. Wait, hold on, if I consider 2 as a possible root, that would be p/q where p=1 and q=1/2, but q must be an integer. Wait, no, the theorem says p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient, so the denominator must divide the leading coefficient. So, the denominator can be 1, -1, 2, or -2, but the numerator is 1 or -1. So, 2 would require p/q where p is 2, but p must divide 1, so p can't be 2. Therefore, 2 is not a possible rational root. So my initial list is correct. The possible rational roots are only those four. \n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me write down all possible p/q combinations systematically:\n\nPossible p: ±1\n\nPossible q: ±1, ±2\n\nTherefore, possible p/q:\n\n1/1 = 1\n\n1/-1 = -1\n\n1/2 = 1/2\n\n1/-2 = -1/2\n\n-1/1 = -1\n\n-1/-1 = 1\n\n-1/2 = -1/2\n\n-1/-2 = 1/2\n\nSo, when you list all of them, you get the four unique values: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. \n\nTherefore, the answer should"

So, four different possible rational roots.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\) with integer coefficients, we apply the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any possible rational root \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term (1) and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient (2). The factors of 1 are ±1, and the factors of 2 are ±1, ±2.
