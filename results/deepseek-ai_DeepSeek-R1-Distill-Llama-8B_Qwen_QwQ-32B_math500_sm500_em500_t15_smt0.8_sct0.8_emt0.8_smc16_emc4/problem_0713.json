So, I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). To find the number of real solutions, I'll calculate the discriminant \\( D \\) using the formula \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\[\nD = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant \\( D = 20 \\) is positive, there are two distinct real solutions for \\( y \\). Therefore, the graph of the parabola has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts of the parabola defined by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Y-Intercept\nThe \\( y \\)-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the \\( y \\)-axis. At the \\( y \\)-intercept, the value of \\( x \\) is **0**. So, set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the Equation\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Quadratic Equation\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), where:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -4 \\)\n- \\( c = -1 \\)\n\nThe discriminant \\( D \\) of a quadratic equation determines the nature of its roots. Use the formula:\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\\[\nD = (-"
