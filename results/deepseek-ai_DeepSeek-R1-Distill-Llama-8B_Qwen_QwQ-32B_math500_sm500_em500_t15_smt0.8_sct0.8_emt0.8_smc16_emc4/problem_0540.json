After Yann has made his selection, Camille can choose any of the remaining 9 dishes.\n\nTherefore, the total number of combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nYann and Camille are going to a restaurant with **10 different dishes** on the menu. Each of them will order **one dish**, but they **refuse to order the same dish**. We need to find out how many **different combinations** of meals they can order. It also matters **who orders what**, so Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Combinations**\n1. **Yann's Choices:**\n   - Since there are **10 dishes**, Yann has **10 possible choices**.\n   - For each choice Yann makes, **Camille has one fewer option** because she cannot order the same dish as Yann.\n\n2. **Camille's Choices:**\n   - After Yann has chosen, Camille will have **9 remaining options** to choose from.\n   - This is because she cannot order the dish that Yann has already chosen.\n\n3. **Total Combinations:**\n   - To find the total number of combinations, we multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has.\n   - **Total combinations = Yann's choices × Camille's choices = 10 × 9 = 90**\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe total number of different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish?
