Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, since it's a square root function, whatever is inside the square root, which is the expression under the radical, has to be greater than or equal to zero. Otherwise, we would be taking the square root of a negative number, which isn't a real number. So, I need to set up an inequality where the expression inside the square root is non-negative.\n\nSo, let me write that down: \\( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \\geq 0 \\). Now, I need to simplify this expression. Hmm, it looks like a difference of squares. Remember, the difference of squares formula is \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me set \\( a = (x - 3) \\) and \\( b = (x - 8) \\). Then, the expression becomes \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\). Let me compute \\( a - b \\) and \\( a + b \\).\n\nCalculating \\( a - b \\):\n\\( (x - 3) - (x - 8) = x - 3 - x + 8 = (x - x) + (-3 + 8) = 0 + 5 = 5 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( a + b \\):\n\\( (x - 3) + (x - 8) = x - 3 + x - 8 = (x + x) + (-3 - 8) = 2x - 11 \\).\n\nSo now, the expression simplifies to \\( (5)(2x - 11) \\geq 0 \\). So, \\( 5(2x - 11) \\geq 0 \\).\n\nSince 5 is a positive constant, the sign of the expression depends on \\( (2x - 11) \\). So, I can divide both sides by 5 without changing the inequality direction, which gives me \\( 2x - 11 \\geq 0 \\).\n\n"

The question is asking for the smallest real number in the domain, so that would be the lower bound, which is \\( 5.5 \\). Therefore, the smallest real number \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\) or 5.5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by recognizing that the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. Then, I applied the difference of squares correctly. \\( a = x - 3 \\) and \\( b = x - 8 \\), so \\( a - b = 5 \\) and \\( a + b = 2x - 11 \\). Multiplying those gives \\( 5(2x - 11) \\geq 0 \\). Since 5 is positive, the inequality reduces to \\( 2x - 11 \\geq 0 \\), which leads to \\( x \\geq 5.5 \\). Hmm, that seems right.\n\nIs there any possibility I made a mistake in calculating \\( a - b \\) or \\( a + b \\)? Let me redo those calculations just to be sure.\n\nCalculating \\( a - b \\):\n\\( (x - 3) - (x - 8) \\)\nDistribute the negative sign: \\( x - 3 - x + 8 \\)\nSimplify: \\( (x - x) + (-3 + 8) = 0 + 5 = 5 \\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nCalculating \\( a + b \\):\n\\( (x - 3) + (x - 8) \\)\nSimplify: \\( x - 3 + x - 8 = 2x - 11 \\). Correct again.\n\nSo, the expression is indeed \\( 5(2x - 11) \\geq 0 \\), leading to"

I think that's solid.\n\nAnother thing to consider: sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially after division or multiplication, you have to be careful if you're multiplying/dividing by a negative, but in this case, I wasn't because I just divided by 2, which is positive. So, no issues there.\n\nWait, but let me also verify the expression inside the square root at \\( x = 5.5 \\) to ensure that it's non-negative. Let me substitute \\( x = 5.5 \\) into \\( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( (5.5 - 3)^2 = (2.5)^2 = 6.25 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( (5.5 - 8)^2 = (-2.5)^2 = 6.25 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 6.25 - 6.25 = 0 \\). So, at \\( x = 5.5 \\), the expression inside the square root is zero, which is acceptable because square root of zero is zero, which is a real number.\n\nIf I plug in a number less than 5.5, say \\( x = 5 \\), let's see what happens.\n\n\\( (5 - 3)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\)\n\\( (5 - 8)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9 \\)\nSo, \\( 4 - 9 = -5 \\), which is negative. Thus, \\( x = 5 \\) is not in the domain, which aligns with our earlier result.\n\nWhat about a number greater than 5.5, say \\( x = 6 \\)?\n\n\\( (6 - 3)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\)\n\\( (6 - 8)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4 \\)\nSo, \\( 9 - 4 = 5 \\), which is positive. Thus, \\( x = 6 \\) is in the domain, as expected.\n\nTherefore, I'm pretty confident that my solution is correct. The smallest real number in the domain is 5.5, which is \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the smallest real number \\( x"
