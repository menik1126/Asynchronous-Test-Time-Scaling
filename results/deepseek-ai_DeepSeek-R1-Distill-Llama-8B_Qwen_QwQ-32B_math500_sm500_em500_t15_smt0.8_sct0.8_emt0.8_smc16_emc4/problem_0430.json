Specifically, the sum is \\(\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r_5}}\\). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\). So each term in the sum is essentially \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\). Therefore, the entire sum is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\).\n\nNow, since the equation has 10 roots, which are paired as complex conjugates (like \\(r_1\\) and \\(\\overline{r_1}\\)), each pair contributes two terms to the sum. But in the given sum, we have only 5 terms, which makes sense because each conjugate pair is treated as a single term in the sum. So, for each pair, we're adding \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} + \\frac{1}{|\\overline{r_i}|^2}\\). But wait, since \\(|r_i| = |\\overline{r_i}|\\), this is just \\(2 \\times \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\) for each pair. But in our problem, the sum is from \\(i=1\\) to \\(5\\), implying each term is already considering both roots, right? Or maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the equation is a 10th-degree polynomial, so it has 10 roots. These roots come in conjugate pairs because the coefficients of the polynomial are real. So, if \\(r\\) is a root, so is \\(\\overline{r}\\). That means the 10 roots are \\(r_1, \\overline{r_1}, r_2, \\overline{r_2}, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r_5}\\"

Therefore, the problem is asking for the sum over each pair of \\(\\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}}\\), but since each pair contributes the same value (because \\(r_i \\overline{r_i} = |\\overline{r_i}|^2 = |r_i|^2\\)), so each term in the sum is actually the reciprocal of the magnitude squared of each unique root. Since there are 5 such unique roots (each with their conjugate), the sum is just 5 terms each being \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). Wait, but actually, each term in the sum is \\(\\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}}\\), which is exactly \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). So the problem is asking for the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) for each of the 5 distinct roots (since their conjugates would give the same value). So, the total sum is the sum over all roots divided by 2? Wait, no, because each pair is counted once here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem lists the roots as \\(r_1, \\overline{r_1}, r_2, \\overline{r_2}, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r_5}\\). So the terms in the sum are \\(\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r_5}}\\). Since each \\(r_i \\overline{r_i}\\) is \\(|r_i|^2\\), so each term is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\), and there are 5 terms. So the problem is asking for the sum over each of these 5 terms. So, I need to compute the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) for each of the 5 distinct roots (excluding their conjugates). \n\nAlright, so how do I compute this sum? Maybe I can relate this to the coefficients of the polynomial? Let me recall that for a polynomial, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots squared or something like that can be related to the coefficients. But here, it's the sum of reciprocals"

Hmm, is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe another approach. If I write \\(1/|r_i|^2 = \\frac{\\overline{r_i}}{r_i}\\), since \\(|r_i|^2 = r_i \\overline{r_i}\\), so \\(\\overline{r_i} = |r_i|^2 / r_i\\), hence \\(1/|r_i|^2 = \\overline{r_i} / r_i\\).

Because each \\( r_i \\) and \\( \\overline{r_i} \\) have same \\( 1/|r_i|^2 \\), so the sum over all 10 roots is equal to \\( 2 \\times \\) sum from \\( i=1 \\) to \\( 5 \\).

Therefore, actually, the problem's sum is exactly \\( \\sum_{i=1}^5 |13 \\omega_i -1|^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum we need is sum_{i=1}^{10} 1/|x_i|^2 divided by 2, but the problem is only summing over 5 terms, each 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) which are equal for each pair. So, I need to compute sum_{i=1}^5 |13 \u03c9_i -1|^2, where \u03c9_i are the 10th roots of -1.\n\nSo, more precisely, \u03c9 are the 10th roots of -1, which can be written as \u03c9 = e^{i(\u03c0 + 2\u03c0k)/10} for k = 0,1,...,9.\n\nTherefore, \u03c9_k = e^{i(\u03c0 + 2\u03c0k)/10}, for k=0,...,9.\n\nSo, let me compute |13 \u03c9_k -1|^2 for each \u03c9_k, then sum them up.\n\nNote that |a - b|^2 = (a - b)(\\overline{a} - \\overline{b}) = |a|^2 + |b|^2 - a \\overline{b} - \\overline{a} b.\n\nSince |13 \u03c9_k -1|^2 = |13 \u03c9_k -1|^2.\n\nCompute this:\n\n|13 \u03c9_k -1|^2 = (13 \u03c9_k -"
