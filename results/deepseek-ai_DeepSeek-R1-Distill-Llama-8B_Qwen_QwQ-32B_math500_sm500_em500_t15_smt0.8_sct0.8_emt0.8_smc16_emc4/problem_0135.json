            "output": "Alright, so I need to find the units digit of 4$$, where the superfactorial is defined as this multi-layered factorial. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the superfactorial is defined as n\\$$ which is a tower of factorials. Specifically, for 4\\$$, it's 4! raised to the power of 4!! which is itself a tower. Wait, no, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me read the definition again: n\\$$ is n!^{{n!^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}} with the tower having n! levels. For n=4, that means starting from 4! and then each subsequent exponent is another 4!. Hmm, no, actually, it's a tower where each level is 4! So 4!^{{4!^{{4!^{4!}}}}}.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The definition is: n\\$$ is an expression where you take n! and raise it to the power of n! again, but then each of those n! terms is itself a superfactorial? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe it's a tower of n!s with n! levels. So for 4\\$$, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So 4\\$$ = 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. So, the units digit is the last digit of this number.\n\nTo find the units digit, I can work modulo 10 because the units digit is equivalent to the number mod 10. But considering that exponentiation can be cyclic modulo 10, I can use Euler's theorem or look for patterns.\n\nFirst, let's compute 4! which is 24. So the innermost part is 4! = 24. Then, the next exponent is 4! which is again 24. So 4\\$$ is 24^{24^{24^{24}}}.\n\nTherefore, I need to compute 24^{24^{24^{24}}} mod 10.\n\nBut calculating such a huge exponent directly is impossible. So I need to break it down using properties of modular arithmetic.\n\nFirst, note that 24 mod 10 is 4, so 24^{anything} mod "

But to compute exponents mod 10, I can look at Euler's theorem.\n\nEuler's theorem says that if a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n. φ(10) = 4 since there are four numbers less than 10 coprime to it (1, 3, 7, 9). But 4 and 10 are not coprime (gcd(4,10)=2), so Euler's theorem doesn't apply here.\n\nHmm, so I need another approach for modulus 10 with base 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look at the pattern of 4^k mod 10.\n\nLet's check:\n\n4^1 = 4 → mod10 is 4\n\n4^2 = 16 → mod10 is 6\n\n4^3 = 64 → mod10 is 4\n\n4^4 = 256 → mod10 is 6\n\nSo, the pattern cycles every 2: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc. So the cycle length is 2.\n\nTherefore, if the exponent is even, the result mod10 is 6, if odd, it's 4.\n\nTherefore, to find 4^(big exponent) mod10, I need to find whether the exponent is even or odd.\n\nWait, exponent is 24^{24^{24}}. Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even. Therefore, the exponent is even (since exponent is 24^something, which is even, so evenness is preserved). So the exponent is even, so 4^(even) mod10 is 6. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, first step: 4\\$$ = 24^{24^{24^{24}}} mod 10. Since 24 mod10=4, so 4^{...} mod10. The exponent is 24^{24^{24}}. Let me call the exponent E = 24^{24^{24}}.\n\nSo the"

As 4 and 10 are not coprime, I can't use Euler directly, but I can use the pattern I observed earlier.\n\nPattern for 4^k mod10: cycles every 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nSo, 4^k ≡ 4 if k is odd, 6 if k is even.\n\nTherefore, to find 4^E mod10, we need E mod2.\n\nIf E is even, it's 6; if odd, it's 4.\n\nSo, E = 24^{24^{24}}. Let's compute E mod2.\n\n24 is even, so 24 ≡ 0 mod2. Therefore, any power of 24 is 0 mod2. So E = 24^{something} ≡0 mod2.\n\nTherefore, E is even. So 4^E ≡6 mod10.
