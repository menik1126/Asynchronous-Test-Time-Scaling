Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the function looks like. The numerator is \\(x - y\\), which is linear, meaning it's a straight line in the xy-plane. The denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\), which is always positive because any real number raised to the fourth power is non-negative, and we're adding 6. So the denominator is always at least 6. That means the function's maximum value will be achieved when the numerator is as large as possible relative to the denominator.\n\nSince both x and y can be any real numbers, I should consider whether there are symmetries or substitutions that could simplify this problem. Maybe if I set \\(y = kx\\), where k is a constant, then I can express everything in terms of x and k. Let's try that.\n\nLet \\(y = kx\\). Then, substituting into the function, the numerator becomes \\(x - kx = x(1 - k)\\), and the denominator becomes \\(x^4 + (kx)^4 + 6 = x^4(1 + k^4) + 6\\). So the function becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(x, k) = \\frac{x(1 - k)}{x^4(1 + k^4) + 6}\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Now, the function is in terms of x and k. I wonder if for each fixed k, I can find the maximum over x, and then find the maximum over k. Let's see.\n\nFor a fixed k, the function is \\(\\frac{x(1 - k)}{x^4(1 + k^4) + 6}\\). Let's denote \\(A = 1 + k^4\\) and \\(B = (1 - k)\\). Then, the function becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{Bx}{A x^4 + 6}\n\\]\n\nTo find the maximum of f(x) with respect to x, let's take the derivative. Let me recall that the derivative of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to x"

So here, u = Bx and v = A x^4 + 6.\n\nSo computing u' is B, and v' is 4 A x^3. Plugging into the quotient rule:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{B(A x^4 + 6) - Bx (4 A x^3)}{(A x^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\nN = B(A x^4 + 6 - 4 A x^4) = B(-3 A x^4 + 6)\n\\]\n\nWait, let's do that step by step. Expanding the numerator:\n\n= B * (A x^4 + 6) - Bx * (4 A x^3)\n= B A x^4 + 6 B - 4 A B x^4\n= (B A x^4 - 4 A B x^4) + 6 B\n= (-3 A B x^4) + 6 B\n\nFactor out B:\n\n= B(-3 A x^4 + 6)\n\nSo the derivative is:\n\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{B(-3 A x^4 + 6)}{(A x^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nFor f'(x) = 0, the numerator must be zero (denominator is always positive). So:\n\n\\[\nB(-3 A x^4 + 6) = 0\n\\]\n\nSince B = (1 - k), unless k = 1, B is not zero.

Let's analyze the second derivative or test intervals.\n\nAlternatively, since for each k, the function f(x) tends to zero as |x| tends to infinity (because denominator grows faster than numerator), the critical point we found is likely to be the maximum.\n\nSo, the maximum occurs at x = \\(\\sqrt[4]{2 / (1 + k^4)}\\) or x = -\\(\\sqrt[4]{2 / (1 + k^4)}\\). But since the numerator x(1 - k) depends on the sign of x, we need to check whether positive or negative x would give a higher value.\n\nWait, if k \u2260 1, then 1 - k is a constant. So if 1 - k is positive, we want x positive; if 1 - k is negative, we want x negative. So that the numerator is positive, as the denominator is always positive.\n\nSo, let me define x as:\n\nx = \\(\\sqrt[4]{2 / (1 + k^4)}\\) if (1 - k) > 0\n\nx = \\(-\\sqrt[4]{2 / (1 + k^4)}\\) if (1 - k) < 0\n\nIf (1 - k) = 0, that is, k = 1, then the function f(x) simplifies.\n\nWait, when k = 1, then y = x, so substituting, function becomes:\n\nf(x) = (x - x)/(x^4 + x^4 + 6) = 0/(2x^4 + 6) = 0.\n\nSo, when k = 1, f(x) = 0 for all x.

Wait, but actually, since we have to take the absolute value into account? Wait, no, because we already considered the sign of (1 - k) when choosing the sign of x. So actually, the numerator is |1 - k| * t, but since we can choose the sign of x to make the numerator positive, so the maximum value for each k is (|1 - k| * t)/8. Wait, but actually, in the expression above, since we set x to be positive when (1 - k) is positive, so the numerator is positive. So the expression is (1 - k) * t /8, but if (1 - k) is negative, then we take x negative, so the numerator becomes (1 - k)*x = (1 - k)*(-t) = |1 - k| * t. Wait, actually, let me think again.\n\nSuppose (1 - k) is positive, then x is positive, so numerator is (1 - k)*x = (1 - k)*t. If (1 - k) is negative, then x is negative, so numerator is (1 - k)*x = (1 - k)*(-t) = - (1 - k)*t = |1 - k| * t. So in either case, the numerator is |1 - k| * t. Therefore, the maximum value for each k is (|1 - k| * t)/8, where t = \\(\\sqrt[4]{2/(1 + k^4)}\\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum over x for a given k is:\n\nf_max(k) = \\(\\frac"

Let's denote f(k) = \\(\\frac{|1 - k|}{8} \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{2}{1 + k^4}}\\)\n\nBut to make it easier, since |1 - k| is symmetric around k = 1. Let's consider k >=1 and k <1 separately.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to square both sides or use substitution to make the function more manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that both numerator and denominator involve 1 - k and 1 + k^4. Maybe we can set k = 1/tan\u03b8 or something, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let t = k^2, since we have k^4.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me make substitution u = k^2. Then, u >=0. But the problem is |1 - k|, which is not purely even in u. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe set z = k, and treat the function as a function of z, then take derivative with respect to z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to find critical points of f(k). So, f(k) is:\n\nf(k) = \\(\\frac{|1 - k|}{8} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{2}{1 + k^4} \\right)^{1/4}\\)\n\nSince f(k) is even in k or odd? Wait, when k is replaced by -k, |1 - k| becomes |1 + k|, and k^4 becomes same as before. So f(k) isn't even or odd. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps we can consider k >=0 and k <0 separately.\n\nBut maybe for simplicity, let's consider k >1 and k <1.\n\nBut actually, perhaps a better substitution is to set t = k.\n\nWait, but I think I should proceed by considering k >1 and k <1 separately because |1 - k| = (1 - k) when k <1, and |1 -k | = (k -1) when k>1.\n\nSo, let me define two functions:\n\nf"

When k >1, it's (k -1). So, to make it easier, let's split into two cases.\n\nCase 1: k <1.\n\nThen f(k) = (1 -k)/8 * (2/(1 +k^4))^{1/4}\n\nCase 2: k >=1.\n\nThen f(k) = (k -1)/8 * (2/(1 +k^4))^{1/4}\n\nWe can analyze each case separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let t = k -1, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the function without the absolute value first, and then see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to make the expression easier, let me write f(k) as:\n\nf(k) = (|1 -k|) * (2)^{1/4} / (8) * (1 +k^4)^{-1/4}\n\nSo, f(k) = (2^{1/4}/8) * |1 -k| / (1 +k^4)^{1/4}\n\nHmm, constants can be factored out. Let me compute 2^{1/4}/8. Since 2^{1/4} is the fourth root of 2, and 8 is 2^3, so 2^{1/4}/2^3 = 2^{-11/4}. Wait, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to make the expression simpler, let me set f(k) = C * |1 -k| / (1 +k^4)^{1/4}, where C is a constant (2^{1/4}/8). Since we are looking for the maximum of f(k), the constant C can be ignored for the purpose of finding the maximum, as it's just a scaling factor. So, to maximize f(k), we can instead maximize |1 -k| / (1 +k^4)^{"
