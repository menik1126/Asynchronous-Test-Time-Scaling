Subsequent terms are generated by **alternately adding and multiplying** by successive integers starting from **1**.\n\nHere's how the sequence progresses:\n- **Term 1:** 0 (Initial term)\n- **Term 2:** 0 + 1 = 1\n- **Term 3:** 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- **Term 4:** 1 + 2 = 3\n- **Term 5:** 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n- **Term 6:** 6 + 3 = 9\n- **Term 7:** 9 \u00d7 3 = 27\n- **Term 8:** 27 + 4 = 31\n- **Term 9:** 31 \u00d7 4 = 124\n- **Term 10:** 124 + 5 = 129\n\n### **Identifying the First Term Greater Than 125**\nFrom the sequence:\n- **Term 9:** 124 (Less than 125)\n- **Term 10:** 129 (Greater than 125)\n\nTherefore, the first term in the sequence that exceeds 125 is **129**.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\\boxed{129}"

    "question": "In the sequence 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, ..., the first term is 0.   Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and  multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1.  For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.  What is the value of the first term that is greater than 125?"
