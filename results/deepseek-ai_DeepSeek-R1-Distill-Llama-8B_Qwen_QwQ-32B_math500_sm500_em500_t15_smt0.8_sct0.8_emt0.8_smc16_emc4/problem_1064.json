            "output": "I need to determine the side length of a regular octagon whose perimeter is equal to that of a given regular hexagon.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the perimeter of the hexagon. The hexagon has 6 sides, each measuring 16 cm. So, the perimeter is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon has 8 sides, I'll divide the total perimeter by 8 to find the length of each side of the octagon. Therefore, each side of the octagon is 96 cm divided by 8, which is 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the side length of the regular octagon, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   - The hexagon has **6 sides**, each **16 cm** long.\n   - **Perimeter of the hexagon = Number of sides \u00d7 Side length**\n   - **Perimeter\\(_{hexagon}\\) = 6 \u00d7 16 cm = 96 cm**\n\n2. **Determine the Side Length of the Octagon:**\n   - The octagon has **8 sides**, and its perimeter is equal to that of the hexagon.\n   - **Perimeter of the octagon = Number of sides \u00d7 Side length**\n   - Let **\\( s \\)** be the side length of the octagon.\n   - **96 cm = 8 \u00d7 s**\n   - **\\( s = \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\) cm**\n\n**Answer:** The length of each side of the octagon is \\(\\boxed{12\\text{ cm}}\\)."
