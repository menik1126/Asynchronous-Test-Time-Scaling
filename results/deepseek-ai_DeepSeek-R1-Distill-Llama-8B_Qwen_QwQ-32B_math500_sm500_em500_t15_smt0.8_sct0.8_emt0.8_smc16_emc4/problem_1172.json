            "output": "Alright, so I've got this equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). The solutions to this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon. The area is supposed to be in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime. Then, I have to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, the equation is a quartic, meaning it's a fourth-degree polynomial. So, there should be four roots (solutions) in the complex plane. These roots form the vertices of a convex polygon, which is likely a quadrilateral since there are four vertices. It could be a square, rectangle, parallelogram, or something else, but given the coefficients, I need to figure out the exact figure.\n\nThe equation is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). I notice that the coefficients have a pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. It seems kind of symmetrical with complex coefficients. Maybe this can be factored or transformed into something more manageable.\n\nI remember that sometimes quartic equations can be factored into quadratics or even linear terms. Let me see if this factors. Let's try to factor it as \\( (z^2 + az + b)(z^2 + cz + d) \\) and see if I can find suitable a, b, c, d.\n\nMultiplying out, I get:\n\n\\( z^4 + (a + c)z^3 + (ac + b + d)z^2 + (ad + bc)z + bd \\).\n\nComparing this with the given equation \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \\), I can set up the following system:\n\n1. \\( a + c = 4i \\)  (coefficient of \\( z^3 \\))\n2. \\( ac + b + d = -6 \\)  (coefficient of \\( z^2 \\))\n3. \\( ad + bc = -4i \\"

So, equally spaced  at intervals of pi/2, which is correct for a square.\n\nSo, when translating each w by subtracting i, which is moving each point down by 1 in the imaginary axis, the relative positions remain the same. So the square is just shifted down, but the side lengths and angles remain same, so it's a square.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^{5/4}, so a=5, b=4, p=2, and a + b + p=11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). We need to find the area of the convex polygon formed by its solutions in the complex plane.\n\nFirst, we recognize that the equation can be rewritten by noticing a binomial expansion pattern. We rewrite the equation as:\n\\[ (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\]\n\nLet \\( w = z + i \\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\\[ w^4 = 1 + i \\]\n\nThe complex number \\( 1 + i \\) has a magnitude of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and an argument of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\). Therefore, the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\) are given by:\n\\[ w_k = 2^{1/8} \\left( \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{\\pi k}{2} \\right) + i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{\\pi k}{2} \\right) \\right) \\]\nfor \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\).\n\nEach root \\( w_k \\) is a complex number with magnitude \\( 2^{1/8} \\) and angle \\( \\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{\\pi k}{2} \\). The corresponding root \\( z \\) is given by:\n\\[ z_k = w_k - i \\]\n\nThe solutions \\( z_k \\) lie on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\) centered at the origin but translated"
