            "output": "Okay, so I have this matrix M that transforms one vector to another. The problem is asking me to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. I guess that means I need to apply the matrix transformation to every point on the line and see what shape it becomes. But doing that for every point on the line seems impossible because there are infinitely many points. There must be a smarter way.\n\nFirst, let me recall that if a matrix M is linear, then it will transform lines into lines. So, the image of a line under a linear transformation should also be a line. That's good news because it means I just need to find two points on the original line, apply M to them, and then determine the equation of the line connecting the transformed points.\n\nSo, the original line is y = 2x + 1. Let's pick two easy points on this line. When x = 0, y = 1, so one point is (0, 1). When x = 1, y = 3, so another point is (1, 3). I can use these two points to figure out how the transformation affects them.\n\nBut wait, do I have the matrix M? The problem says M takes [2; -1] to [9; 3] and [1; -3] to [7; -1]. So, I need to write down the matrix M based on this information. Since M is a 2x2 matrix, let's denote it as:\n\nM = [a  b;\n      c  d]\n\nWhen M is multiplied by a vector [x; y], it gives [ax + by; cx + dy]. So, applying M to [2; -1] gives [9; 3], which gives me two equations:\n\n1) a*2 + b*(-1) = 9\n2) c*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, applying M to [1; -3] gives [7; -1], so:\n\n3) a*1 + b*(-3) = 7\n4) c*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo now, I have four equations with four unknowns: a, b, c, d. Let me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 2: 2c"

I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. So, I need to apply M to two points on the line y = 2x + 1, then find the equation of the line connecting the images.\n\nEarlier, I thought of using the points (0,1) and (1,3). Let's try that.\n\nFirst, transform (0,1):\n\nM * [0; 1] = [4*0 + (-1)*1; 2*0 + 1*1] = [ -1; 1 ]\n\nSecond, transform (1,3):\n\nM * [1; 3] = [4*1 + (-1)*3; 2*1 + 1*3] = [4 - 3; 2 + 3] = [1; 5]\n\nSo, the transformed points are (-1, 1) and (1, 5). Now, I need to find the equation of the line passing through these two points.\n\nTo find the equation of a line, I can use the two-point form.\n\nFirst, let's compute the slope (m):\n\nm = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (5 - 1)/(1 - (-1)) = (4)/(2) = 2\n\nSo, the slope is 2. Now, using the point-slope form with one of the points, say (-1,1):\n\ny - 1 = 2(x - (-1)) => y - 1 = 2(x + 1) => y = 2x + 2 + 1 => y = 2x + 3\n\nWait, is that right?

And when x = -1, y = 2*(-1) + 3 = -2 + 3 = 1, which also matches.\n\nSo, the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M is y = 2x + 3.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that the case? Because sometimes when you transform a line, depending on the matrix, it might not remain a line, but in this case, since M is linear, it should.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this using the concept of linear transformations and how they act on lines. Since y = 2x +1 is a line, its image under M will also be a line.\n\nAnother way to think about this is by considering the transformation of the coefficients. Let me try to see if there's a more systematic way.\n\nSuppose we have a line y = mx + b. Let me think about how a linear transformation affects this line.\n\nIn general, when a linear transformation is applied, the line will be transformed into another line, and the equation can be found by substituting the inverse transformation into the original equation.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a more formal approach.\n\nGiven that M is a linear transformation, the inverse transformation M^{-1} exists if M is invertible, which it is because its determinant is not zero.\n\nLet me compute the determinant of M to confirm it's invertible.\n\nDeterminant of M = (4)(1) - (-1)(2) = 4 + 2 = 6 ≠ 0.\n\nSo, M is invertible. Therefore, the inverse transformation exists, and we can write it.\n\nSo, the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M is the set of all points M*v where v is on the line. So, v = [x; 1] because y = 2x +1 implies that for any x, y is determined. But wait, in matrix terms, it's better to express the line as a vector equation.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nSuppose I parametrize the line y = 2x +1. Let me let x = t, then y = 2t +1. So, points on the line can be written as [t; 2t +1] for t ∈ ℝ.\n\nThen, applying M to each point"

So, the image is y = 2x +3. Wait, but let me check with another point to be thorough.\n\nTake another point on the original line, say x = 2, then y = 2*2 +1 =5. So the point (2,5).

Wait, the original line had slope 2, and the image also has slope 2. But that might be a coincidence here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction vector of the original line is [1, 2]^T, since the line y=2x+1 has direction vector (1,2). Applying the matrix M to this direction vector:\n\nM*[1;2] = [4*1 + (-1)*2; 2*1 +1*2] = [4-2; 2+2] = [2;4]. So the direction vector becomes [2;4], which is a scalar multiple of [1;2], so the direction is preserved, but scaled. Therefore, the slope remains 2, since direction vector is (2,4) which is 2*(1,2), so slope is 4/2 =2. So that's why the slope remains the same. Interesting.\n\nTherefore, the image line has the same slope, but different intercept. The intercept is determined by the transformation of the point where the original line crosses the y-axis, which is (0,1). Applying M to (0,1) gives (-1,1).
