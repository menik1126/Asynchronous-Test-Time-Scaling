I need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, \u03c9\u00b3 = 1 means that \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity, which are 1, and the two complex roots. Let me denote them as \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2, right? So \u03c9 can be either the real root 1, or one of the complex roots.\n\nWait, but hold on. If \u03c9 is a cube root of unity, then \u03c9 \u2260 1, so the cube roots are 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1 and \u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u0304 (the complex conjugate of \u03c9). That might be useful later on.\n\nNow, the expression I need to compute is the sum of two fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nHmm, maybe I can find a common denominator or simplify each term separately. Let me try simplifying each fraction first.\n\nStarting with the first term, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\). To simplify this, perhaps I can multiply the numerator and denominator by something to make the denominator real or more manageable. Since \u03c9\u00b2 is the conjugate of \u03c9 (because \u03c9\u00b3 = 1), multiplying by \u03c9\u00b2 might help.\n\nSo, let's try that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} \\times \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)\\omega^2} = \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega^2 + \\omega^3}.\n\\]\n\nWait, but \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so \u03c9\u00b3 is 1. Therefore, the denominator becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\omega^2 + 1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the first term simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same for the second term, \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\):\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u03c9:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1"

So this term simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega}{1 + \\omega}.\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting back into the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{1 + \\omega^2} + \\frac{\\omega}{1 + \\omega}.\n\\]\n\nHmm, now we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{1 + \\omega^2} + \\frac{\\omega}{1 + \\omega}.\n\\]\n\nMaybe I can combine these two fractions into one. Let's see if they have a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) and (1 + \u03c9). Since \u03c9 \u2260 -1 and \u03c9\u00b2 \u2260 -1 (because if \u03c9 were -1, then (-1)\u00b3 = -1 \u2260 1, so that's not a root here), so 1 + \u03c9 and 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 are non-zero.\n\nThe common denominator would be (1 + \u03c9\u00b2)(1 + \u03c9). Let me compute that:\n\n(1 + \u03c9\u00b2)(1 + \u03c9) = 1*(1) + 1*(\u03c9) + \u03c9\u00b2*(1) + \u03c9\u00b2*(\u03c9) = 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3.\n\nBut \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so that becomes:\n\n1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nWait, since 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0 (because it's the sum of cube roots of unity, except 1), because 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. Therefore, 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nBut since \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1 (from 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0), so 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nOh! So the common denominator is 1. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\omega^2}{1} + \\frac{\\omega}{1} = \\omega^2 + \\omega.\n\\]\n\nBut from earlier, we know that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1."

Again, 1 + \u03c9 = -\u03c9\u00b2, so \u03c9/( -\u03c9\u00b2 ) = - \u03c9 / \u03c9\u00b2 = -1/\u03c9.\n\nBut since \u03c9\u00b3 =1, 1/\u03c9 = \u03c9\u00b2, so this term is -\u03c9\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, S = -\u03c9 - \u03c9\u00b2 = -(\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nWe know from 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2=0 that \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1.\n\nTherefore, S = -(-1) = 1.\n\nWait, so through this approach, I get S =1.
