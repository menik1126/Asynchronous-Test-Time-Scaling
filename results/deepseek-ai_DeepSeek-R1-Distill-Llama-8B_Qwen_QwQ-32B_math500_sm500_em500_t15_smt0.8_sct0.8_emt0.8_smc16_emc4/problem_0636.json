Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root has to be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, my first task is to figure out when the expression inside the square root, which is (x-3)^2 minus (x-8)^2, is greater than or equal to zero.\n\nLet me write that down as an inequality: (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \u2265 0. Hmm, looks like a difference of squares. I remember that a difference of squares can be factored as A^2 - B^2 = (A - B)(A + B). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me set A = (x - 3) and B = (x - 8). Then, the expression becomes A^2 - B^2 = (A - B)(A + B). Let me compute A - B and A + B.\n\nCalculating A - B: (x - 3) - (x - 8) = x - 3 - x + 8 = (x - x) + (-3 + 8) = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nCalculating A + B: (x - 3) + (x - 8) = x - 3 + x - 8 = (x + x) + (-3 - 8) = 2x - 11.\n\nSo, now the expression (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 factors to (5)(2x - 11). Therefore, the inequality becomes 5*(2x - 11) \u2265 0.\n\nSince 5 is a positive constant, I can divide both sides of the inequality by 5 without changing the direction of the inequality sign. So, that simplifies to 2x - 11 \u2265 0.\n\nNow, solving for x: 2x \u2265 11 => x \u2265 11/2. So, 11/2 is 5.5. That means the expression inside the square root is non"

            "output": "-negative when x is 5.5 or larger.\n\nTherefore, the domain of the function g(x) is all real numbers x such that x \u2265 5.5. So, in the domain of g(x), x starts from 5.5 and goes to infinity.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest real number x in the domain of g(x). Since the domain is x \u2265 5.5, the smallest such x is 5.5 itself.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me plug x = 5.5 back into the original expression inside the square root to verify.\n\nCalculating (5.5 - 3)^2 - (5.5 - 8)^2: That's (2.5)^2 - (-2.5)^2 = 6.25 - 6.25 = 0. So, sqrt(0) is 0, which is okay because square roots can be zero. So, 5.5 is indeed in the domain.\n\nWhat if I plug in a number smaller than 5.5, say x = 5. Let's see: (5 - 3)^2 - (5 - 8)^2 = 2^2 - (-3)^2 = 4 - 9 = -5. That's negative, so sqrt(-5) is not a real number. So, yes, x has to be at least 5.5.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try x = 6: (6 - 3)^2 - (6 - 8)^2 = 3^2 - (-2)^2 = 9 - 4 = 5. Positive, so sqrt(5) is a real number. That's good.\n\nSo, all checks out. The smallest real number x in the domain of g(x) is 5.5, which is 11/2. So, the answer should be 11/2.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is found by determining when the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Solving the inequality \\( (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \\geq 0 \\) leads to \\( x \\geq \\frac{11}{2} \\). Thus, the smallest \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\"
