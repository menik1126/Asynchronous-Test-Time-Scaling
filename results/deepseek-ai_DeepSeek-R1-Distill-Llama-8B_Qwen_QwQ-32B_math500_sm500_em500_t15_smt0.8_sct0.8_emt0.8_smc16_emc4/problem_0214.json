Concentric circles share the same center, which is key to calculating their areas.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the area of the largest circle with a radius of 7 using the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2. This gives me the total area for region X.\n\nNext, I'll subtract the area of the second circle (radius 6) from the largest circle to find the area of region X that extends beyond the second circle. This will help me identify the area of region Y.\n\nThen, I'll subtract the area of the smallest circle (radius 4) from the second circle to determine the area of region Y that lies between the second and smallest circles.\n\nFinally, by subtracting the area of the smallest circle from the area of the second circle, I'll find the area of region Z, which is the area of the smallest circle itself.\n\nAfter calculating all three areas, I'll identify which region has the greatest area and which has the smallest. Then, I'll compute the difference between these two areas to find the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's analyze the areas of each region step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Radii of the three concentric circles: 4, 6, and 7.\n- Regions labeled \\( X \\), \\( Y \\), and \\( Z \\).\n\n**Understanding the Regions:**\n1. **Region \\( X \\)**: The area between the largest circle (radius 7) and the second circle (radius 6).\n2. **Region \\( Y \\)**: The area between the second circle (radius 6) and the smallest circle (radius 4).\n3. **Region \\( Z \\)**: The area of the smallest circle (radius 4).\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n1. **Area of the Largest Circle (Region \\( X \\) + Region \\( Y \\) + Region \\( Z \\)):**\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{largest}} = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area of the Second Circle (Region \\( X \\) and Region \\( Y \\)):**\n   \\[\n   A_{\\text{second}} = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\n   \\]\n   \\"
