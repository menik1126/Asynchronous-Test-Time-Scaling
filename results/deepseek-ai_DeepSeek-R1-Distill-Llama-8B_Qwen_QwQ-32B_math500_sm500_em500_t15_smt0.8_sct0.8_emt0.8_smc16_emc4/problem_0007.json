            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to find.\n\nFirst, P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. That means the leading coefficient is 1, so the polynomial looks like P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nNow, the problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Hmm, okay. So, R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by a quadratic, which means R(x) must be of degree less than 2. So, R(x) is a linear polynomial, right? Like R(x) = dx + e, where d and e are constants.\n\nAlso, I know that P(0) = 5. Since P(x) is x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, plugging in x = 0 gives P(0) = c = 5. So, c is 5. That's one constant down.\n\nNow, let's think about the division of polynomials. When I divide P(x) by (x - 1)(x - 4), I get some quotient Q(x) and the remainder R(x). Similarly, dividing by (x - 2)(x - 3) gives another quotient, say Q'(x), and the remainder 2R(x).\n\nSince the divisors are quadratic, the quotient Q(x) in each case would be a linear polynomial because the degree of P(x) is 3, and 3 - 2 = 1. So Q(x) = mx + n for the first division, and Q'(x) = px + q for the second division.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to find Q(x) and Q'(x) explicitly. Let me think about the Remainder Theorem or Polynomial Remainder Theorem. When you divide a polynomial P(x) by (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But here, we're dividing by a product of two factors, so the remainder should satisfy certain conditions.\n\nSpecifically, if we have P(x) divided by"

Similarly, when divided by (x - c)(x - d), the remainder 2R(x) must satisfy 2R(c) = P(c) and 2R(d) = P(d).\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Let me recall the Remainder Theorem for higher degree divisors. If a polynomial P(x) is divided by a quadratic polynomial (x - a)(x - b), then the remainder R(x) is of degree less than 2, so linear. Then, R(a) = P(a) and R(b) = P(b). Similarly, if divided by (x - c)(x - d), the remainder S(x) would satisfy S(c) = P(c) and S(d) = P(d). \n\nIn this problem, the remainder when divided by (x -1)(x -4) is R(x), so R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Then, when divided by (x -2)(x -3), the remainder is 2R(x), so 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3). \n\nTherefore, we can write equations:\n\n1. R(1) = P(1)\n2. R(4) = P(4)\n3. 2R(2) = P(2)\n4. 2R(3) = P(3)\n\nSince R(x) is a linear polynomial, let me denote R(x) = dx + e. Then, equations become:\n\n1. d(1) + e = P(1) => d + e = P(1)\n2. d(4) + e = P(4) => 4d + e = P(4)\n3. 2(d(2) + e) = P(2) => 2(2d + e) = P(2)\n4. 2(d(3) + e) = P(3) => 2(3d + e) = P(3)\n\nSo, if I can express P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) in terms of the coefficients of P(x), then I can"

So, P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + 5.\n\nTherefore, I can compute P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) as follows:\n\n- P(1) = 1\u00b3 + a(1)\u00b2 + b(1) + 5 = 1 + a + b + 5 = a + b + 6\n- P(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = 13 + 4a + 2b\n- P(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 = 32 + 9a + 3b\n- P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 69 + 16a + 4b\n\nSo, now, equations 1 to 4 can be rewritten as:\n\n1. d + e = a + b + 6\n2. 4d + e = 69 + 16a + 4b\n3. 2(2d + e) = 13 + 4a + 2b\n   => 4d + 2e = 13 + 4a + 2b\n4. 2(3d + e) = 32 + 9a + 3b\n   => 6d + 2e = 32 + 9a + 3b\n\nSo, now I have four equations:\n\n1. d + e = a + b + 6  \u2192 equation (1)\n2. 4d + e = 69 + 16a + 4b \u2192 equation (2)\n3. 4d + 2e = 13 + 4a + 2b \u2192 equation (3)\n4. 6d + 2e = 32 + 9a + 3b \u2192 equation (4)\n\nI can solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write equations (1), (2), (3"
