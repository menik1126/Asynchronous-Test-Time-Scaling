            "output": "Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to polynomial division and remainders, but I'll do my best to figure it out.\n\nSo, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So P(x) looks like x\u00b3 + something x\u00b2 + something x + something. That's helpful.\n\nNext, it says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Hmm, okay. So in both cases, the remainder is a multiple of R(x). Interesting.\n\nAlso, we know that P(0) is 5. That gives us the constant term of the polynomial. Since P(0) = 5, when we plug in x=0, all terms except the constant term disappear, so the constant term is 5. So, P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + 5. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nWe need to find P(5). So, if I can find the coefficients a, b, and maybe other terms, I can compute P(5). But how?\n\nI remember the Remainder Theorem. When you divide a polynomial P(x) by (x - c), the remainder is P(c). But here, we're dividing by quadratic polynomials, so the remainder should be of lower degree, which is linear or constant. So, R(x) is a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) must be in the form of r x + s.\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), which would be 2r x + 2s. That's interesting because it relates the remainders from two different divisions.\n\nSo, let's formalize this. Since P(x) divided by (x - 1)(x - 4) leaves a remainder R(x), which is linear, we can write:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3),"

Since P(x) is monic, the leading term of Q1 and Q2 must be 1, right? Because when multiplied by the leading term of the divisor (which is x\u00b2), it gives the leading term of P(x), which is x\u00b3. So, Q1(x) is x + something, and Q2(x) is also x + something.\n\nBut maybe I can use the Remainder Factor Theorem here. Since R(x) is the remainder when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), then R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, since 2R(x) is the remainder when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), then 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3). That seems right.\n\nSo, let me write down these equations:\n\n1. R(1) = P(1)\n2. R(4) = P(4)\n3. 2R(2) = P(2)\n4. 2R(3) = P(3)\n\nSince R(x) is linear, let me denote R(x) = m x + n. Then, equations 1-4 become:\n\n1. m(1) + n = P(1) => m + n = P(1)\n2. m(4) + n = P(4) => 4m + n = P(4)\n3. 2(m(2) + n) = P(2) => 4m + 2n = P(2)\n4. 2(m(3) + n) = P(3) => 6m + 2n = P(3)\n\nSo, if I can find expressions for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), then I can set up equations to solve for m and n.
