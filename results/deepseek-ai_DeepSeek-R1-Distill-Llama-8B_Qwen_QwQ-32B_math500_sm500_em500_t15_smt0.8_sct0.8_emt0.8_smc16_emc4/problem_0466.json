Hmm, let's see how I can approach this. Maybe using symmetric sums or something related to Vieta's formulas. \n\nFirst, let me recall that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are:\n\n- \\(s_1 = x + y + z\\)\n- \\(s_2 = xy + yz + zx\\)\n- \\(s_3 = xyz\\)\n\nI know that \\(s_3 = 4\\) from the first equation. So, \\(xyz = 4\\). That's good. \n\nNow, looking at the second equation, \\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\\). I remember there's a formula for the sum of cubes:\n\n\\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz\\)\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3s_3\\)\n\nGiven that \\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\\), and \\(s_3 = 4\\), plug these in:\n\n\\(4 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3(4)\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(4 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 12\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\(s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 = 4 - 12\\)\n\n\\(s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 = -8\\)\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\). Let's keep that aside for now.\n\nNow, let's look at the third equation:\n\n\\(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^"

            "output": "2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\\)\n\nThis looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it somehow. Let's see if I can group terms:\n\nGroup terms with similar variables:\n\n\\(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z\\)\n\nHmm, notice that each pair is like \\(x y (y + x)\\) and \\(x z (z + x)\\) and \\(y z (z + y)\\). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, \\(xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) = xy(x + y)\\)\n\nSimilarly, \\(xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(x + z)\\)\n\nAnd \\(yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(y + z)\\)\n\nSo, the entire left side can be written as:\n\n\\(xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z)\\)\n\nThat's better. So, the third equation becomes:\n\n\\(xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12\\)\n\nHmm, maybe I can express this in terms of symmetric sums. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, note that \\(x + y + z = s_1\\), so \\(x + y = s_1 - z\\), \\(x + z = s_1 - y\\), and \\(y + z = s_1 - x\\). \n\nSo substituting back, the third equation becomes:\n\n\\(xy(s_1 - z) + xz(s_1 - y) + yz(s_1 - x) = 12\\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\n\\(xy s_1 - xyz + xz s_1 - xyz + yz s_1 - xyz = 12\\)\n\nSo, that's:\n\n\\(s_1 (xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12\\)\n\nWait, because each of the terms like -xyz appears three times (once for each variable being subtracted). So, it simplifies to:\n\n\\(s_1 s_2 - 3 s_3 = 12\\)\n\nBecause \\(s_2 = xy + yz + zx\\), so \\(xy + xz + yz = s_2\\"

Therefore:\n\n\\(s_1 s_2 - 3 s_3 = 12\\)\n\nWe know that \\(s_3 = 4\\), so plug that in:\n\n\\(s_1 s_2 - 3(4) = 12\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(s_1 s_2 - 12 = 12\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\(s_1 s_2 = 24\\)\n\nOkay, so now I have two equations involving \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\):\n\n1. \\(s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 = -8\\)\n2. \\(s_1 s_2 = 24\\)\n\nWait, so substitute equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n\\(s_1^3 - 3(24) = -8\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(s_1^3 - 72 = -8\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\(s_1^3 = 64\\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\(s_1 = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\\)\n\nSo, \\(s_1 = 4\\).
