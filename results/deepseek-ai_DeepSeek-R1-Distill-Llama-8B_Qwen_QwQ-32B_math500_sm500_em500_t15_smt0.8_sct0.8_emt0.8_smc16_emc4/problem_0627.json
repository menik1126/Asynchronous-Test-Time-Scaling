Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to zero. Otherwise, the function wouldn't be defined, right? So, the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is all real numbers \\( x \\) such that \\( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \\geq 0 \\).\n\nAlright, so I need to solve the inequality \\( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \\geq 0 \\). Hmm, this looks like a difference of squares. I remember that \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me set \\( a = x - 3 \\) and \\( b = x - 8 \\). Then, the expression becomes \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\). Let me compute \\( a - b \\) and \\( a + b \\).\n\nCalculating \\( a - b \\):\n\\( a - b = (x - 3) - (x - 8) = x - 3 - x + 8 = 5 \\). Oh, that's nice, it's just 5.\n\nNow, calculating \\( a + b \\):\n\\( a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 8) = x - 3 + x - 8 = 2x - 11 \\).\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to \\( 5(2x - 11) \\geq 0 \\).\n\nNow, I can divide both sides by 5, which is positive, so the inequality sign doesn't change:\n\\( 2x - 11 \\geq 0 \\).\n\nAdding 11 to both sides:\n\\( 2x \\geq 11 \\).\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\\( x \\geq \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n\nSo, the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is all real numbers \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\ge"

Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the expression. Let me expand both squares manually to confirm.\n\nExpanding \\( (x - 3)^2 \\):\n\\( = x^2 - 6x + 9 \\).\n\nExpanding \\( (x - 8)^2 \\):\n\\( = x^2 - 16x + 64 \\).\n\nSubtracting them:\n\\( (x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) = x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 \\).\n\nSimplifying term by term:\n- \\( x^2 - x^2 = 0 \\)\n- \\( -6x + 16x = 10x \\)\n- \\( 9 - 64 = -55 \\)\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to \\( 10x - 55 \\geq 0 \\).\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I had \\( 5(2x - 11) \\geq 0 \\), which gives \\( 2x - 11 \\geq 0 \\), same as \\( 10x - 55 \\geq 0 \\). So, both methods give the same inequality. That seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, solving \\( 10x - 55 \\geq 0 \\):\nAdding 55: \\( 10x \\geq 55 \\)\nDividing by 10: \\( x \\geq \\frac{55}{10} = \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, the domain is \\( x \\geq \\frac{11}{2} \\), which is 5.5.\n\nThus, the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain is \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n\nJust to make sure, let me plug \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} \\) back into the original expression to see if it's non-negative.\n\nCompute \\( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \\) when \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} \\):\n\nFirst, \\( x - 3 = \\"

So, \\( (-\\frac{5}{2})^2 = \\frac{25}{4} \\).\n\nSubtracting them: \\( \\frac{25}{4} - \\frac{25}{4} = 0 \\).

I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and plugging in the value checks out.
