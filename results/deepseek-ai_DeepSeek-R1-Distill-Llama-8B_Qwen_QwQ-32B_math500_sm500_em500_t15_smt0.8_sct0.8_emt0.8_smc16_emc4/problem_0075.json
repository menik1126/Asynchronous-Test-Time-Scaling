Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest possible gcd for the two expressions given: n + 7 and 2n + 1.\n\nLet me denote d as the gcd of these two numbers. So, d = gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1). That means d divides both n + 7 and 2n + 1. My goal is to find the maximum possible value of d.\n\nI think one of the properties of gcd is that if d divides both numbers, it also divides any linear combination of them. So, maybe I can express 2n + 1 in terms of n + 7 and find a relationship.\n\nLet me try subtracting multiples of n + 7 from 2n + 1 to eliminate n. Let me see:\n\nIf I have 2n + 1, can I express this in terms of n + 7? Let me try:\n\n2n + 1 = k*(n + 7) + r, where k is some integer and r is the remainder.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to use the Euclidean algorithm. I think that's a systematic way to find the gcd.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then taking the remainder, repeating the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.\n\nSo, in this case, let's consider 2n + 1 and n + 7.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\ngcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\n\nAccording to the Euclidean algorithm, I can write 2n + 1 as 2*(n + 7) - 13. Let me check:\n\n2*(n + 7) = 2n + 14. So, 2n + 1 = 2*(n + 7) - 13. Yeah, that works because 2n + 14 - 13 = 2n + 1.\n\nSo, now, we have:\n\ngcd(n + 7, "

            "output": "2n + 1) = gcd(n + 7, -13). But since gcd is always positive, it's the same as gcd(n + 7, 13).\n\nTherefore, the gcd of n + 7 and 2n + 1 is the same as the gcd of n + 7 and 13. So, the gcd can only be a divisor of 13. Since 13 is a prime number, its divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the possible values of the gcd are either 1 or 13.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value is 13, provided that 13 divides n + 7. So, to get the maximum gcd, we need to have 13 divides n + 7. That is, n + 7 \u2261 0 mod 13, so n \u2261 -7 mod 13. Since -7 mod 13 is the same as 6 mod 13 (because 13 -7 =6), so n \u22616 mod13.\n\nTherefore, if n is congruent to 6 modulo 13, then 13 divides n +7, and since the gcd is 13, that would be the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm that when n \u22616 mod13, then gcd(n +7, 2n +1) is indeed 13. Let me test with a specific example.\n\nLet me choose n =6. Then n +7 =13, and 2n +1 =13. So gcd(13,13)=13. That works.\n\nAnother example: n =6 +13=19. Then n +7=26, and 2n +1=39. gcd(26,39)=13. Yep, that's also 13.\n\nAnother test: n=6+26=32. n+7=39, 2n+1=65. gcd(39,65)=13. Correct again.\n\nSo, that seems to hold. Therefore, the maximum possible gcd is 13.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a case where the gcd could be higher. Since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13,"

Maybe expressing the gcd and solving for d.\n\nSuppose d divides both n +7 and 2n +1.\n\nSo, d | (n +7) and d | (2n +1).\n\nThen, d also divides 2*(n +7) - (2n +1) = 2n +14 -2n -1 =13.\n\nSo, d divides 13, so possible d is 1 or13.\n\nHence, maximum d is 13, as I thought.\n\nSo, yes, the greatest possible value of gcd(n +7,2n +1) is 13.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\), we can use the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nFirst, express \\( 2n + 1 \\) as a linear combination of \\( n + 7 \\):\n\\[\n2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13)\n\\]\nSince 13 is a prime number, the possible values for the gcd are its divisors, which are 1 and 13.
