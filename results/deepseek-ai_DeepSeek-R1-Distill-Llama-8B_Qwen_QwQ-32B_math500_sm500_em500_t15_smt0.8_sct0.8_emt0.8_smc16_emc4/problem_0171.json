            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, cube roots can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this step by step. Let me write it down first to make it clearer.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nI remember that to solve an equation with a cube root, one common method is to get rid of the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. That should help me eliminate the cube root and make the equation easier to handle. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, I'll cube both sides:\n\n[\u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4)]\u00b3 = 16\u00b3\n\nSimplifying the left side, the cube and the cube root cancel each other out, so that becomes just x\u00b2 - 4x + 4.\n\nOn the right side, 16 cubed is... hmm, let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... 4096. So,\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations are usually in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so let's rearrange the equation to fit that form.\n\nSubtracting 4096 from both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\nSimplify 4 - 4096. Well, 4096 minus 4 is 4092, so this becomes negative:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let me double-check my subtraction. If I have 4 - 4096, that's like subtracting a much larger number, so yes, it should be negative. 4 - 4096 is indeed -4092. So the equation is correct.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation: x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a) where a = 1, b = -4, and c = -4092.\n\nSo plugging in those values:\n\nx = [-(-"

So, since it's minus that in the formula, it becomes +16368.\n\nSo the discriminant is 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nHmm, 16384, that's a perfect square, isn't it? Let me think. 128 squared is 16384 because 128*128 is 16384. Let me verify: 128*100=12800, 128*28=3584, so 12800+3584=16384. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, \u221a16384 = 128\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 128] / 2\n\nSo that gives two solutions:\n\nx = (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66\n\nx = (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62\n\nNow, the problem asks for the positive value of x, so 66 is positive, and -62 is negative, so we discard -62.\n\nBut let me just check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make arithmetic errors, especially with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the original equation:\n\n\u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nCubing both sides gives x\u00b2 -4x +4 = 4096, correct.\n\nThen x\u00b2 -4x -4092 =0, yes.\n\nQuadratic formula: a=1, b=-4, c=-4092.\n\nDiscriminant: b\u00b2-4ac = 16 -4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nSquare root of 16384 is 128, correct.\n\nSo x = [4 \u00b1128]/2. That gives 132/2=66, and (-124)/2=-62. So positive solution is 66.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's plug x=66 back into the original equation to check.\n\nCompute inside the cube root: 66\u00b2 -"

Perfect.\n\nJust to check x=-62 as well, even though it's negative.\n\nCompute inside the cube root: (-62)^2 -4*(-62)+4.\n\n(-62)^2 is 3844. -4*(-62) is +248. So 3844 +248 +4 = 3844+248=4092 +4=4096. So cube root of 4096 is still 16, but since the problem asks for positive x, we don't consider -62.\n\nSo, yes, my answer should be correct: 66.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is \u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16. To solve for x, we first cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 16\u00b3  \nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\nRearranging terms gives a quadratic equation:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a  \nx = [4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 16368)] / 2  \nx = [4 \u00b1 128] / 2\n\nThis yields two solutions: 66 and -62.
