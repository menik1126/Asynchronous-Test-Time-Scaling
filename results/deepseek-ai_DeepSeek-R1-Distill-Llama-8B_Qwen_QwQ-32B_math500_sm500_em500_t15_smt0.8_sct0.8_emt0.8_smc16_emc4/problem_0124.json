In this case, the binary number has 11 bits, so we add one zero to make it 12 bits: \\( 010101001110_2 \\).*\n\n3. **Convert Each Binary Group to Octal**:\n   - Each group of eight binary digits converts to a single octal digit.\n   - Convert each of the groups:\n     ```\n     10 -> 2\n     1010 -> E\n     0111 -> 7\n     0 -> 0\n     ```\n   - Combine the results: \\( 2 \\, E \\, 7 \\, 0 \\) \u2192 \\( 2E70_8 \\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The binary number \\( 10101001110_2 \\) is equal to \\( \\boxed{"
