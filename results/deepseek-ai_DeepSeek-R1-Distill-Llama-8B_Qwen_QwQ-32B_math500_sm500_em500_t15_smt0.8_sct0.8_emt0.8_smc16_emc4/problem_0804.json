I need to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\). \n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. The polynomial is monic because \\( a_n = 2 \\), but wait, no, monic would be coefficient 1. So it's not monic. But the leading coefficient is 2. So the polynomial can be written as \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), where each \\( r_i \\) is an integer because the roots are distinct integers. \n\nSince the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is 66, that comes from multiplying the roots and the leading coefficient. Specifically, \\( a_0 = 2 \\times (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\). So, \\( 2 \\times (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 66 \\). \n\nTherefore, \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = \\frac{66}{2 \\times (-1)^n} \\). Wait, \\( 66/2 = 33 \\), so \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 33 \\times (-1)^n \\). So the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd.\n\nBut, since the roots are integers, I need to factor 33 or -33 into distinct integers. Let me list the factors of 33. The prime factors of 33 are 3 and 11, so the possible sets of roots are combinations of these, possibly including -1 or -1 to get the sign right.\n\nSince I need the product to be 33 or -33, let me see. Let's first consider 33 as the product. If n is even, then the product is positive, so 33, and if n is odd, it's negative, so -33. So, depending on the number of roots, the sign will change.\n\nBut wait, n is the degree of the polynomial, so it's the number of roots"

Since the roots are distinct integers, we need to choose n distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, such that when multiplied by 2*(-1)^n gives 66. \n\nBut actually, the product of the roots themselves (not including the leading coefficient) is (product of roots) = (-1)^n * (constant term)/leading coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should recall Vieta's formula properly.\n\nVieta's formula states that for a monic polynomial \\( x^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + c_0 \\), the sum of roots is -c_{n-1}, and the product is (-1)^n c_0. \n\nBut in our case, the polynomial isn't monic. The given polynomial is \\( f(x) = 2x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 \\). So to adjust Vieta's formula, we can factor out the leading coefficient: \n\n\\( f(x) = 2(x^n + \\frac{a_{n-1}}{2}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_0}{2}) \\).\n\nTherefore, the monic polynomial with the roots is \\( x^n + \\frac{a_{n-1}}{2}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + \\frac{a_0}{2} \\). Then, for this monic polynomial, the product of the roots is (-1)^n times the constant term of the monic polynomial, which would be \\( (-1)^n \\times \\frac{a_0}{2} = (-1)^n \\times 33 \\).\n\nThus, the product of the roots is indeed \\( (-1)^n \\times 33 \\). Wait, but earlier I thought it's \\( 33 \\times (-1)^n \\). So, the product of the roots r1*r2*...*rn = (-1)^n * (a0)/leading coefficient. Hmm, the leading coefficient is 2, so that would be (-1)^n*(66)/(2*(-1)^n)? Wait maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of the polynomial as \\( 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn) \\)."

Therefore, r1 r2 ... rn = 33*(-1)^n.\n\nSo the product of roots is either 33 or -33, depending on n's parity. Wait, no, because (-1)^n is either 1 or -1, so r1 r2...rn = 33 * (-1)^n. So if n is even, r1 r2...rn = 33, and if n is odd, it's -33.\n\nSo the product of roots is either 33 or -33. So the roots are integers, so we need to list possible sets of distinct integers that multiply to 33 or -33. Since the roots are distinct, we can't have repeated factors.\n\n33 is 3*11, and 1 and 33. So, the factors are 1, 3, 11, 33 and their negatives. So the possible roots are combinations of these numbers, possibly with some negatives to make the product 33 or -33.\n\nBut we can have more than two roots if n is higher. Wait, but 33 is a product of primes, so to get more roots, we can include 1 and -1 as roots because 1 and -1 multiply to give 1 or -1, which can help adjust the product.\n\nBut let me note that since 33 is 3*11, but we could have more roots if we include 1 and -1 because they multiply to 1 or -1, but we have to keep all roots distinct.\n\nSo, for example, if we have 3 roots, we could have 1, -1, and 33. Then the product is 1*(-1)*33 = -33. So for n=3, the product would be -33. Then, for n=3, roots are 1, -1, 33, product is -33, so 2*(-1)^3*(-1*1*33) = 2*(-1)*(-33) = 66, yes.\n\nAlternatively, for n=2, roots could be 3 and"

Wait, but n=2 would have two roots, so the product would be 3*11=33, so with n even (2), the product is 33, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. So, perhaps the minimal |a_{n-1}| occurs when the roots are arranged in such a way that the sum of the roots (or the sum with some sign) is minimized in absolute value.\n\nBecause Vieta's formula for the coefficient a_{n-1} is related to the sum of the roots. Let me recall:\n\nIn the polynomial \\( f(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn) \\), expanding this, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is 2*(- (r1 + r2 + ... + rn)). Because when you expand the product, the x^{n-1} term comes from choosing one of the -ri terms and the rest x's, so the coefficient is 2*(- (sum of roots)). \n\nTherefore, \\( a_{n-1} = -2 \\times (r1 + r2 + ... + rn) \\). Therefore, the absolute value |a_{n-1}| is 2 times the absolute value of the sum of the roots. So to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize |sum of roots|.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33 (depending on n's parity), such that the absolute value of their sum is as small as possible, and then multiply that by 2 to get |a_{n-1}|. \n\nTherefore, the key is to find such a set of integers with the minimal possible sum in absolute value. \n\nSo, first, let's consider all possible factorizations of 33 and -33 into distinct integers, then compute their sums, and find the minimal |sum|.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where the product is 33 (so n is even). Then, the roots multiply to 33. The factors must be distinct integers. Let's list all possible sets of distinct integers whose"

When n is odd, the product is -33.\n\nSo for n even:\n\nNumber of negative roots must be even.\n\nFor example, n=2: both positive or both negative.\n\nn=4: two negative roots or zero.\n\nWait, but 1 and -1 would be needed for more roots.\n\nWait, actually, let me think: for n even, the product is 33, which is positive.
