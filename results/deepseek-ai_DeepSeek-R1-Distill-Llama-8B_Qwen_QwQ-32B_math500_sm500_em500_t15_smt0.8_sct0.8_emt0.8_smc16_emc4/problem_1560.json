Since rotations of the same configuration are considered equivalent, I'll start by fixing one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\nOnce a person's position is fixed, this reduces the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people. However, because the table is square, there are additional symmetries to consider, such as reflections. For example, flipping the table over would mirror the seating arrangement, leading to equivalent configurations.\n\nTo account for these symmetries, I'll divide by the number of rotational symmetries (4) and then by 2 to account for reflections. This means I have 7! / (4 * 2) distinct seating arrangements after fixing one person's position.\n\nCalculating this gives 5040 / 8, which simplifies to 630. Therefore, there are 630 distinct ways to seat 8 people around the table under the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we need to account for rotational and reflectional symmetries. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Fix One Person's Position:**\n   - Since rotations of the entire arrangement are considered equivalent, we can fix one person's seat. This eliminates the rotational symmetry.\n\n2. **Arrange the Remaining People:**\n   - With one person's seat fixed, we now need to arrange the remaining 7 people in the remaining 7 seats.\n\n3. **Account for Reflectional Symmetry:**\n   - The square table has reflectional symmetry, meaning that flipping the table over (reflected) would result in an equivalent configuration.\n   - Therefore, we must divide by 2 to account for these symmetries.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Arrangements:**\n   - The number of ways to arrange 7 people in 7 seats is \\(7!\\).\n   - Considering the symmetries, the total number of distinct arrangements is \\(\\frac{7!}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Perform the Calculations:**\n   - \\(7! = 5040\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{5040}{2} = 2520\\)\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, we notice that the square table has more symmetry than just reflections.

The remaining symmetry to consider is reflection. Thus, dividing by 2 is correct.\n\nWait, there's a mistake here. Let me re-examine:\n\n- Fixing one person's position removes rotational symmetry, so we don't need to divide by 4 again. The only remaining symmetry is reflection. Therefore, the correct calculation is indeed \\(\\frac{7!}{2}\\).\n\nWait, but another perspective: The total number of rotational symmetries for a square is 4 (rotational group C4), and the reflection symmetries form the dihedral group D4 with 8 elements (4 rotations and 4 reflections). Since the problem states that rotations are considered equivalent, but does it consider reflections as equivalent? The problem says \"Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.\" It does not mention reflections. Therefore, reflections are not considered equivalent unless specified. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.\" So reflections are not considered equivalent.

Let me visualize this. If it's a square table, each side has 2 people. So total people = 8.\n\nIn such a case, the number of distinct arrangements is calculated by fixing one person, then arranging the rest. However, because it's a square, the symmetries include rotations and reflections. The problem states that rotations are considered equivalent, but does not mention reflections. Therefore, we only consider rotational symmetry.\n\nBut wait, in standard combinatorial problems with unmarked tables, both rotations and reflections are considered symmetries, but in this problem, it's specified only that rotations make configurations equivalent. Therefore, we must consider rotational symmetry but not reflectional symmetry.\n\nHence, the number of distinct arrangements is \\( \\frac{8!}{4} \\). But since one person is fixed, it becomes \\( \\frac{7!}{1} = 5040 \\).\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the problem of seating around a square with rotational and reflectional symmetry is considered, but in this case, since only rotations are specified, reflections are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the table as having distinguishable positions because of the sides. For a square table, each position is distinct because each side has a specific seat. For example, seat 1 is north, seat 2 is north-east, seat 3 is east, seat 4 is south-east, seat 5 is south, seat 6 is south-west, seat 7 is west, seat 8 is north-west. So each seat is unique. Therefore, even if you rotate, the positions are fixed relative to the table's sides. Thus, rotation would not necessarily make configurations equivalent because the table's sides are fixed in space.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's think carefully. In the problem statement, it's said that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. So, if you can rotate one arrangement to get another, they are considered the same. If you can't, they are different.\n\nThis suggests that we must consider rotational symmetry only, not reflections or other symmetries.\n\nTherefore, to compute the number of distinct arrangements under rotation:\n\n1. **Total arrangements without considering symmetry:** \\(8!\\"

Let's check:\n\n\\( \\frac{8!}{4} = \\frac{40320}{4} = 10080 \\), which is not equal to \\(7! = 5040\\). Wait, this discrepancy arises because fixing one person's position effectively divides by 8 (the number of rotations), but the problem says rotations are considered equivalent. Wait, perhaps the rotational symmetry group for a square table has 4 elements (rotations by multiples of 90\u00b0), so dividing by 4.\n\nWait, confusion arises here. Let me clarify:\n\nIn circular tables, the number of rotational symmetries is equal to the number of seats, so dividing by n. But for a square table with 8 seats (2 per side), the rotational symmetries are rotations by 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0, and 360\u00b0 (which is identity). So there are 4 rotational symmetries. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is \\( \\frac{8!}{4} \\).\n\nAlternatively, fixing one person's position reduces the problem to arranging the remaining 7, but since the table's rotational symmetry is 4-fold, fixing one person's position actually accounts for the rotational symmetry. Wait, but if you fix one person's seat, you are effectively choosing a reference point, so the remaining can be arranged freely. Since the table's rotational symmetry is 4, but fixing one seat (which is part of the 8 seats) would mean that the rotational symmetry is already accounted for. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from how many seats are there. The table has 8 seats (2 per side). Fixing one person's seat removes rotational symmetry because rotating the table would move that person to a different seat.

Therefore, reflections would result in different configurations. So, by fixing one seat, we eliminate rotational symmetry, and the remaining can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways without considering reflections.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\(7! = 5040\\).\n\nHowever, let me verify this. Suppose we have a square table with 8 seats. If we fix one person's seat, then the rest can be arranged in 7! ways. Since rotations are considered equivalent, but reflections are not, because the problem only mentions rotations.\n\nWait, but in reality, if you have a square table with labeled seats, rotations would make different seatings equivalent. However, if the seats are unlabeled, then only rotational symmetry matters.\n\nBut in this problem, it's not specified whether the seats are labeled or not. If the seats are unlabeled, then arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same.\n\nBut in the absence of specific labels, we have to consider rotational symmetry.

This is the confusion.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when you fix a person's seat, you are effectively choosing a specific rotation, so you don't have to divide by the number of rotations. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we fix person A at a specific seat. Then, the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways. Since rotations are considered equivalent, but we've fixed person A's seat, this accounts for the rotational symmetry. However, the problem is that the square table's rotational symmetry is 4, so fixing a seat might not be sufficient?\n\nWait, no. If you fix a person's seat, you are eliminating rotational symmetry entirely. For example, if you fix person A at seat 1, then rotating the table would move person A to seat 2, 3, etc., which are different configurations. But since we fixed their position, we are considering seat 1 as a reference point, so rotations are no longer considered equivalent.
