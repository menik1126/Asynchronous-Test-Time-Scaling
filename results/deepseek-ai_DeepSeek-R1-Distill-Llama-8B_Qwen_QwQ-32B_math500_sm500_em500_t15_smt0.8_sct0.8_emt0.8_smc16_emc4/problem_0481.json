            "output": "To find the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from its corners, I need to follow these steps:\n\nFirst, determine the radius and diameter of the sphere. The radius is 3 inches, so the diameter is twice that, which is 6 inches.\n\nNext, consider the cube from which the sphere is formed. The cube's corners are removed to create the sphere. This implies that the sphere is inscribed within the cube. In a cube, the space diagonal is equal to the diameter of the inscribed sphere.\n\nThe space diagonal of a cube with side length 's' is calculated using the formula s\u221a3. Setting this equal to the sphere's diameter gives the equation s\u221a3 = 6.\n\nTo find the side length of the cube, solve for 's' by dividing both sides by \u221a3, resulting in s = 6/\u221a3. Simplifying this expression, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a3 to rationalize the denominator, giving s = 2\u221a3 inches.\n\nFinally, calculate the volume of the cube. The volume of a cube is given by s\u00b3, which is (2\u221a3)\u00b3. Expanding this, first cube the numerical part: 2\u00b3 = 8. Then cube the square root of 3: (\u221a3)\u00b3 = 3\u221a3. Multiplying these results together gives 8 * 3\u221a3 = 24\u221a3 cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cube is 24\u221a3 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from its corners, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Diameter of the Sphere:**\n   \n   The diameter \\( D \\) of the sphere is twice the radius.\n   \\[\n   D = 2 \\times \\text{radius} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube:**\n   \n   When a sphere is inscribed in a cube, the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces. This means that:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Space diagonal of the cube} = \\text{Diameter of the sphere}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Relate the Space Diagonal to the Side Length of the Cube:**\n   \n  "
