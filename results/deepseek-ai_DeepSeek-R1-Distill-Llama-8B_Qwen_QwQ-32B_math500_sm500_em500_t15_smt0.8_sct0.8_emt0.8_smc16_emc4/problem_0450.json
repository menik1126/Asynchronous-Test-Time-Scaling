Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given. We have three positive real numbers \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). The condition is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). And we need to minimize the expression \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Alright.\n\nI remember that for optimization problems with constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be useful. But since this is a problem likely solvable with algebraic manipulations, maybe I can use inequalities like AM-GM or others.\n\nLet me denote \\(S = x + y + z\\). Then, our condition becomes \\(xyzS = 1\\). And the expression to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Let's try expanding this expression:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz = yS + xz\n\\]\n\nSo, it's \\(yS + xz\\). Hmm, interesting. So, the expression we need to minimize is \\(yS + xz\\).\n\nWe know from our condition that \\(xyzS = 1\\), so maybe we can express \\(xz\\) in terms of \\(yz\\). Wait, let me think:\n\nIf \\(xyzS = 1\\), then \\(xz = \\frac{1}{yzS}\\). But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express \\(xz\\) as \\(xz = \\frac{1}{yzS}\\). Hmm, let me see.\n\nSo, substituting back into the expression \\(yS + xz\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nyS + \\frac{1}{yzS} = yS + \\frac{1}{yzS}\n\\]\n\nThat looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can make a substitution or find a relationship between variables.\n\nWait, let me consider symmetry here. \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are all positive, so maybe assuming some symmetry in the problem could help.\n\nIn many optimization problems, especially symmetric ones, the extremum occurs when all variables are equal.

Since \\(x = z\\), the constraint becomes \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot x (x + y + x) = x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\). So, maybe setting variables equal can simplify the problem. But I'm not sure if this is the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set \\(x = y = z\\). Let me try that. If \\(x = y = z\\), then the constraint is \\(x^3 \\cdot 3x = 3x^4 = 1\\), so \\(x = (1/3)^{1/4}\\). Then, \\((x + y)(y + z) = (2x)(2x) = 4x^2 = 4 \\times (1/3)^{1/2} = 4/\\sqrt{3}\\). But this might not be the minimum. Maybe the minimum is achieved when variables aren't all equal?\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is better. Let's see, the expression to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Maybe expanding it helps? Let me see:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, group terms:\n\n\\[\n= y(x + y + z) + x z\n\\]\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, since \\(x + y + z = S\\), it's \\(yS + xz\\). Hmm, and we have \\(xyzS = 1\\). Maybe we can combine these expressions.\n\nLet me think of variables in terms of two variables instead of three. Let me set some variables to reduce the number. Let me denote \\(a = x + z\\), so then perhaps express \\(x + y + z = y + a\\), so \\(S = y + a\\).
