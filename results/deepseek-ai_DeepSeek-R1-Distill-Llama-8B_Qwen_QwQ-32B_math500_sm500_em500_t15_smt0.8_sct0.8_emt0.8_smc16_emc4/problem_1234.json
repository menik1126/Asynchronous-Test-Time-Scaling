Hmm, okay, so I need to find all the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy this. Since there's a square root, I think I might need to square both sides at some point to get rid of it. But let me not rush and think carefully about each step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to have it clear:\n\n\\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\)\n\nI want to isolate the square root term so that I can then square both sides. So, maybe I can subtract 4 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on the right. Let's try that:\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\)\n\nOkay, now the square root is by itself on the right side. Now, to get rid of the square root, I should square both sides of the equation. But before I do that, I remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I need to check my answers at the end to make sure they actually work in the original equation.\n\nSo, let's square both sides:\n\n\\( (x - 4)^2 = (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 \\)\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\( (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 = 11 - 2x \\)\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\n\\( x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\)\n\nHmm, I need to get all the terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let me subtract \\( 11 \\) and add \\( 2x \\) to both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = x^2 - 6x + 5 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( 11 - 2x - 11 + 2x = 0 \\)\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n\\( x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in standard form"

Let me see if it's factorable.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\( 5 \\) and add up to \\( -6 \\). Hmm, the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, if both are negative, their product is positive and their sum is negative. So, -1 and -5 multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Perfect!\n\nSo, the factoring would be:\n\n\\( (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 \\)\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\( x - 1 = 0 \\) => \\( x = 1 \\)\n2. \\( x - 5 = 0 \\) => \\( x = 5 \\)\n\nSo, the solutions are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\). But wait, I remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. So, I need to plug each of these back into the original equation to make sure they work.\n\nLet's check \\( x = 1 \\):\n\nOriginal equation: \\( 1 = \\sqrt{11 - 2(1)} + 4 \\)\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n\\( 11 - 2 = 9 \\), so sqrt(9) is 3.\n\nSo, \\( 1 = 3 + 4 \\), which is \\( 1 = 7 \\). Hmm, that's not true. So, \\( x = 1 \\) is an extraneous solution and must be rejected.\n\nNow, let's check \\( x = 5 \\):\n\nOriginal equation: \\( 5 = \\sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4 \\)\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n\\( 11 - 10 = 1 \\), so sqrt(1) is 1.\n\nSo, \\( 5 = 1 + 4 \\), which is \\( 5 = 5 \\). That's true, so \\( x = 5 \\) is a valid solution.\n\nWait, so only \\( x = 5 \\) works. That means even though we got two solutions from the quadratic, only one is valid in the original equation"

Let me double-check the check for \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\( x = 1 \\), so right side is:\n\nsqrt(11 - 2*1) +4 = sqrt(9) +4 = 3 +4=7. Which is not equal to 1. So correct, 1 doesn't work.\n\nFor \\( x=5 \\):\n\nsqrt(11 -10)=sqrt(1)=1. So, right side is 1+4=5, which is equal to left side, x=5. That works.\n\nSo, the only solution is x=5.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I squared both sides, I might have missed something else. Let me check the domain of the original equation, because the expression under the square root must be non-negative.\n\nSo, original equation: \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} +4 \\)\n\nThe expression under the square root is \\( 11 - 2x \\), which must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\nSo, \\( 11 - 2x \\geq 0 \\)\n\nSolving for x:\n\n\\( -2x \\geq -11 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by -2, remembering to flip the inequality sign:\n\n\\( x \\leq 11/2 \\) => \\( x \\leq 5.5 \\)\n\nSo, x has to be less than or equal to 5.5. Our solutions were x=1 and x=5. Both are less than 5.5, so this doesn't affect anything, but it's good to verify.\n\nAnother thing: when we squared both sides, we assumed \\( x -4 = \\sqrt{11 -2x} \\). So, what is the left side? \\( x -4 \\). Since sqrt(11 -2x) is non-negative, so \\( x -4 \\) must also be non-negative, because square roots are non-negative.\n\nSo, \\( x -4 \\geq 0 \\) => \\( x \\geq 4 \\)\n\nSo, in addition to the domain \\( x \\leq 5.5 \\), we also have \\( x \\geq 4 \\). So, x must be between 4 and 5.5 inclusive.\n\nOur solutions are x=1 and x=5. But"

            "output": " x=1 is less than 4, so it's invalid. x=5 is between 4 and 5.5, so that's okay. So that's another way to see that x=1 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nHmm, so I think that's thorough. Let me recap the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\nOriginal equation: x = sqrt(11-2x) +4\n\n1. Subtract 4: x -4 = sqrt(11-2x)\n\n2. Square both sides: (x-4)^2 = 11 -2x\n\n3. Expand left side: x² -8x +16 = 11 -2x\n\n4. Bring all terms to left: x² -6x +5 =0\n\n5. Factor: (x-1)(x-5)=0 => x=1 or x=5\n\n6. Check solutions in original equation:\n\n- x=1: 1 = sqrt(9)+4 → 1=7 → nope\n\n- x=5: 5 = sqrt(1)+4 → 5=5 → yes\n\n7. Also check domain conditions:\n\n- sqrt requires 11-2x ≥0 → x ≤5.5\n\n- LHS after step1 requires x-4 ≥0 → x≥4\n\nThus, valid x must be between 4 and 5.5, so x=5 is the only one.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So, the final answer is 5, boxed.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the square root term**:\n   \\[\n   x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Square both sides** to eliminate the square root:\n   \\[\n   (x - 4)^2 = ( \\sqrt{11 - 2x} )^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n   \\]\n\n3. **"
