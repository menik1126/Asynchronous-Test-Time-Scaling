It indicates that the number of males is 1.35 times the number of females.\n\nFor each grade, I'll calculate the ratio of males to females and see how close it is to 1.35.\n\nStarting with the 9th grade: Males are 41.1%, and females are 39.4%. The ratio is 41.1 / 39.4 \u2248 1.04. This is close to 1.35.\n\nNext, the 10th grade: Males are 34.4%, and females are 33.1%. The ratio is 34.4 / 33.1 \u2248 1.04. Again, this is close to 1.35.\n\nMoving to the 11th grade: Males are 20.6%, and females are 13.8%. The ratio is 20.6 / 13.8 \u2248 1.49. This is further from 1.35.\n\nFinally, the 12th grade: Males are 11.6%, and females are 8.6%. The ratio is 11.6 / 8.6 \u2248 1.35. This is exactly 1.35.\n\nComparing all ratios, the 12th grade has the ratio closest to 1.35, making it the grade where male bus riders are closest to 135% of the female bus riders.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to \\(135\\%\\) of the number of female bus riders.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Required Percentage**\n\n- We need to find the grade where:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Number of Male Bus Riders} = 135\\% \\times \\text{Number of Female Bus Riders}\n  \\]\n  Or:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{\\text{Number of Male Bus Riders}}{\\text{Number of Female Bus Riders}} \\approx 1.35\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Ratios for Each Grade**\n\nLet's compute the ratio of male to female bus riders for each grade.\n\n1. **9th Grade**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{41.1\\%}{39.4\\%"
