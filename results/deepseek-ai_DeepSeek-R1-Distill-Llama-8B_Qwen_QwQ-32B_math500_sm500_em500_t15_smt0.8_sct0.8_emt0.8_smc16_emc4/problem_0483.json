            "output": "To determine the volume of the original cube, I first recognize that it has equal side lengths, which we'll denote as \\( s \\).\n\nNext, I consider the cube from which the steel sphere is made by removing metal from its corners. Each corner of a cube is a right-angled triangle, and removing a sphere from each corner involves taking out a portion of the cube.\n\nI then realize that the sphere's radius is given as 3 inches. To find out how much material is removed, I calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula \\( V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\), which gives \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3)^3 = 36\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n\nHowever, since there are 8 corners in a cube, the total volume removed is \\( 8 \\times 36\\pi = 288\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n\nFinally, I set up the equation \\( s^3 = 288\\pi + 36\\pi \\) to find the original cube's volume. Solving for \\( s \\), I find \\( s = \\sqrt[3]{324\\pi} \\), which simplifies to \\( s = 6\\sqrt{\\pi} \\) inches.\n\nBy cubing \\( s \\) to find the volume, I obtain the final volume of the cube as \\( 216\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nA steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have a cube from which metal is removed from its corners to form a steel sphere.\n   - The sphere has a radius of 3 inches.\n   - We need to find the cube's original volume before any metal was removed.\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Sphere:**\n   - The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n     \\]\n   - Given \\( r = 3 \\) inches:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3"

However, the sphere is formed by removing material from all corners such that the sphere fits perfectly inside the cube.\n   - The sphere must touch the centers of the cube's faces. The sphere's diameter (twice the radius) must equal the cube's side length \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Diameter of sphere} = 2r = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the cube's side length \\( s \\) must be equal to the sphere's diameter:\n     \\[\n     s = 6 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Cube's Volume:**\n   - The volume of the cube is:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3 = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe volume of the cube is \\boxed{216} cubic inches."
