The problem states that for every positive integer k, there are two properties:\n\n1. The subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} forms a geometric sequence.\n2. The subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} forms an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAdditionally, I'm told that a13 is 2016, and I need to find a1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a geometric sequence and an arithmetic sequence are.\n\nA geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio (r). So, if I have terms b, c, d in a geometric sequence, then c = b*r and d = c*r = b*r^2.\n\nAn arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference (d) to the previous term. So, if the terms are c, d, e, then d = c + d' and e = d + d' = c + 2d', where d' is the common difference.\n\nGiven that, let me try to write down what the problem says for a general k.\n\nFor each k, the terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} are in geometric progression. So that means:\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r_k\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k = a_{2k-1} * r_k^2\n\nSimilarly, the terms a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} are in arithmetic progression. So that means:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k = a_{2k} + 2d_k\n\nBut since a_{2k+1} is also related to a_{2k-1} via the geometric progression, I can perhaps link"
