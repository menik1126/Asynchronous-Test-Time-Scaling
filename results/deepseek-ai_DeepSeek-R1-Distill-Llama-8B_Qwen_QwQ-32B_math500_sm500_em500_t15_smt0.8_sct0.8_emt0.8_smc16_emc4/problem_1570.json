            "output": "First, I'll start by simplifying each term inside the numerator: 5 divided by the square root of 80, the square root of 845 divided by 9, and the square root of 45.\n\nI'll begin by simplifying √80. Since 80 can be factored into 16 times 5, and 16 is a perfect square, I can simplify √80 to 4√5. This makes the first term 5 divided by 4√5.\n\nNext, I'll simplify √845. I notice that 845 can be broken down into 5 times 169, and 169 is 13 squared, so √845 becomes 13√5. Dividing this by 9 gives me 13√5 over 9.\n\nThen, I'll simplify √45. Breaking down 45 into 9 times 5, and since 9 is a perfect square, √45 simplifies to 3√5.\n\nNow, I'll rewrite the expression with the simplified terms: 5/(4√5) + 13√5/9 + 3√5, all divided by √5.\n\nTo make the expression easier to handle, I'll rationalize the denominator of the first term by multiplying the numerator and denominator by √5, resulting in (5√5)/20, which simplifies to √5/4.\n\nCombining all the terms, the expression becomes √5/4 + 13√5/9 + 3√5. To add these fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which is 36. Converting each term, I get (9√5)/36 + (52√5)/36 + (108√5)/36. Adding these together results in (169√5)/36.\n\nFinally, I'll divide this sum by √5 to complete the expression. Dividing each term by √5 gives me (169√5)/36 divided by √5, which simplifies to 169/36 after canceling out the √5 terms.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression step-by-step:\n\n1. **Simplify each term in the numerator:**\n   - \\( \\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}} \\):\n     - \\( \\sqrt{80} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 5} = 4\\sqrt{5} \\)\n     - \\( \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} = \\dfrac"
