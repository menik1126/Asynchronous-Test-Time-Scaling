            "output": "First, I'll start by simplifying each term inside the numerator: 5 divided by the square root of 80, the square root of 845 divided by 9, and the square root of 45.\n\nI'll begin by simplifying \u221a80. Since 80 can be factored into 16 times 5, and 16 is a perfect square, I can simplify \u221a80 to 4\u221a5. This makes the first term 5 divided by 4\u221a5.\n\nNext, I'll simplify \u221a845. I notice that 845 can be broken down into 5 times 169, and 169 is 13 squared, so \u221a845 becomes 13\u221a5. Dividing this by 9 gives me 13\u221a5 over 9.\n\nThen, I'll simplify \u221a45. Breaking down 45 into 9 times 5, and since 9 is a perfect square, \u221a45 simplifies to 3\u221a5.\n\nNow, I'll rewrite the expression with the simplified terms: 5/(4\u221a5) + 13\u221a5/9 + 3\u221a5, all divided by \u221a5.\n\nTo make the expression easier to handle, I'll rationalize the denominator of the first term by multiplying the numerator and denominator by \u221a5, resulting in (5\u221a5)/20, which simplifies to \u221a5/4.\n\nCombining all the terms, the expression becomes \u221a5/4 + 13\u221a5/9 + 3\u221a5. To add these fractions, I'll find a common denominator, which is 36. Converting each term, I get (9\u221a5)/36 + (52\u221a5)/36 + (108\u221a5)/36. Adding these together results in (169\u221a5)/36.\n\nFinally, I'll divide this sum by \u221a5 to complete the expression. Dividing each term by \u221a5 gives me (169\u221a5)/36 divided by \u221a5, which simplifies to 169/36 after canceling out the \u221a5 terms.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression step-by-step:\n\n1. **Simplify each term in the numerator:**\n   - \\( \\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}} \\):\n     - \\( \\sqrt{80} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 5} = 4\\sqrt{5} \\)\n     - \\( \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} = \\dfrac"
