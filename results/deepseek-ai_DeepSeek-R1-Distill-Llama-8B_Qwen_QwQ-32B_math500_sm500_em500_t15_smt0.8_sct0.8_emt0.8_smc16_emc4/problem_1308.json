To solve for \\( x \\), I can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.\n\nCross-multiplying gives me \\( 2(x - 5) = 3 \\times 4 \\).\n\nNext, I distribute the 2 on the left side, resulting in \\( 2x - 10 = 12 \\).\n\nThen, I isolate the term with \\( x \\) by adding 10 to both sides, which simplifies to \\( 2x = 22 \\).\n\nFinally, I divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\( x \\), finding that \\( x = 11 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x-5}\\) for \\(x\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiply** to eliminate the fractions:\n   \\[\n   2(x - 5) = 3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distribute** the 2 on the left side:\n   \\[\n   2x - 10 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate** the term with \\(x\\) by adding 10 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x = 22\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\)** by dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 11\n   \\]\n\n\\(\\boxed{11}\\)"
