Dividing 42 by 2 again results in 21. The number 21 can be broken down into 3 and 7.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 84 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nNext, I need to combine these prime factors into distinct positive integers such that their product equals 84. The goal is to minimize the sum of these integers.\n\nI'll consider different groupings:\n- If I keep 2 and 7 as single numbers, I can pair the remaining factors. For example, grouping 2\u00b2 and 3 gives me the numbers 3, 4, and 7.\n- Another grouping could be 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 and 2 \u00d7 7 = 14, resulting in the numbers 6 and 14.\n- I can also explore smaller groupings, like using 1 as one of the integers, but including 1 doesn't help reduce the sum effectively.\n\nCalculating the sums:\n- For the group 3, 4, and 7, the sum is 3 + 4 + 7 = 14.\n- For the group 6 and 14, the sum is 6 + 14 = 20.\n- Including 1 in the groupings doesn't yield a smaller sum.\n\nFinally, the smallest sum achievable with distinct positive integers whose product is 84 is 14.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 84**:\n   - Break down 84 into its prime factors:\n     \\[\n     84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n     \\]\n\n2. **Grouping the Factors**:\n   - We need to combine these prime factors into distinct integers such that their product is 84.\n   - **Option 1**: Keep the factors separated.\n     - \\(2\\) and \\(7\\) are already distinct.\n     - The remaining factor is \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n     - So, the"
