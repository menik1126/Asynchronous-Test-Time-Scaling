Since the number has eleven digits, one group will have two digits.\n\nThe binary number can be divided into 1 010 010 011 10.\n\nNext, I'll convert each group of three binary digits into its corresponding decimal value. \n\nThen, I'll convert each of those decimal values into octal by finding the appropriate octal digit.\n\nFinally, I'll combine all the octal digits to get the final base eight number.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Break the Binary Number into Groups of Three Digits (from right to left):**\n\n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n\n   Note: Since the total number of digits is 11, one group will have two digits.\n\n2. **Convert Each Group of Three Binary Digits to Decimal:**\n\n   - \\(101_2 = 1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5_{10}\\)\n   - \\(010_2 = 0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0 = 0 + 2 + 0 = 2_{10}\\)\n   - \\(011_2 = 0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3_{10}\\)\n   - \\(10_2 = 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0 = 2 + 0 = 2_{10}\\)\n\n3. **Convert Each Decimal Value to Octal:**\n\n   - \\(5_{10} = 5_{8}\\)\n   - \\(2_{10} = 2_{8}\\)\n   - \\(3_{10} = 3_{8}\\)\n   - \\(2_{10} = 2_{8}\\)\n\n4. **Combine the Octal Digits:**\n\n   ```\n   5 2 3 2\n  "
