The complex number \\(1 - i\\) can be represented as \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) multiplied by \\(e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\), because its magnitude is \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\) and its angle (argument) is \\(45^\\circ\\) or \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) radians.\n\nNext, I'll raise this exponential form to the 8th power. Using the properties of exponents, \\((\\sqrt{2})^8 \\times e^{i\\frac{8\\pi}{4}}\\) simplifies to \\(4 \\times e^{i2\\pi}\\).\n\nSince \\(e^{i2\\pi}\\) equals 1, the expression simplifies to 4. Therefore, the absolute value of \\((1 - i)^8\\) is 4.\n</think>\n\nLet's calculate \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\) step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   We need to find the absolute value (or modulus) of the complex number \\( (1 - i)^8 \\).\n\n2. **Express the Complex Number in Polar Form:**\n   The complex number \\( 1 - i \\) can be expressed in polar form \\( r(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\), where:\n   - \\( r \\) is the modulus (magnitude) of the complex number.\n   - \\( \\theta \\) is the argument (angle).\n\n   For \\( 1 - i \\):\n   - \\( r = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n   - \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) (since the complex number is in the fourth quadrant)\n\n   So, \\( 1 - i = \\sqrt{2}\\left(\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} + i\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\).\n\n3. **Raise to the 8th Power:**\n   Using De Moivre's Theorem:\n   \\[\n   (1 - i)^8 = \\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^8 \\left(\\cos"
