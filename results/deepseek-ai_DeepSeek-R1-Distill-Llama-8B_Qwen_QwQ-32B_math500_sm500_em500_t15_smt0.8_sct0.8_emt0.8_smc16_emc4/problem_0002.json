            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, let me make sure I understand all the terms.\n\nA monic polynomial is one where the leading coefficient is 1. Since it's a degree 3 polynomial, I can write it as P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants I need to find.\n\nThe problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, I know that P(0) = 5, which means the constant term c is 5, right? So P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + 5.\n\nNow, let me recall the Remainder Theorem. When a polynomial P(x) is divided by a linear divisor (x - k), the remainder is P(k). However, here we're dividing by quadratic polynomials, which have two roots each. So, for the first division by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder R(x) must be a linear polynomial because the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor. So, let me denote R(x) as rx + s. Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), which is 2rx + 2s.\n\nSo, from the division by (x - 1)(x - 4), when x = 1, P(1) = R(1). Similarly, when x = 4, P(4) = R(4). Similarly, from the division by (x - 2)(x - 3), when x = 2, P(2) = 2R(2), and when x = 3, P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nBut wait, I also know that R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4). That means P(x) can be written as (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x), where Q"

Similarly, P(x) can be written as (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x).\n\nSince P(x) is a cubic polynomial and (x - 1)(x - 4) is quadratic, Q1(x) must be linear. Similarly, (x - 2)(x - 3) is quadratic, so Q2(x) is linear as well.\n\nSo, we have two expressions for P(x):\n\n1. P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + rx + s\n2. P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2rx + 2s\n\nNow, since both expressions equal P(x), we can set them equal to each other:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + rx + s = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2rx + 2s\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, and R(x) is linear, I can use the fact that P(x) - R(x) is divisible by (x - 1)(x - 4). Similarly, P(x) - 2R(x) is divisible by (x - 2)(x - 3).\n\nSo, P(x) - R(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)S(x), where S(x) is a linear polynomial.\n\nSimilarly, P(x) - 2R(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)T(x), where T(x) is also linear.\n\nSince P(x) is cubic, and (x - 1)(x - 4) is quadratic, S(x) must be linear. Similarly, T(x) is linear.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)S(x) + R(x)\nand P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)T(x) + 2R(x)\n\nSo, since both expressions equal P(x), they must equal each other:\n(x - 1)(x - 4)S(x) + R(x) = (x - 2)(x - "

That means my previous approach is flawed.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me consider that P(x) - R(x) is divisible by (x -1)(x -4). So, P(x) - R(x) = (x -1)(x -4)(x -k), where k is some constant, since P is cubic and (x-1)(x-4) is quadratic, so the third factor is linear.\n\nSimilarly, P(x) - 2R(x) is divisible by (x -2)(x -3), so P(x) -2R(x)=(x -2)(x -3)(x -m), where m is another constant.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n1. P(x) = (x -1)(x -4)(x -k) + R(x)\n2. P(x) = (x -2)(x -3)(x -m) + 2R(x)\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(x -1)(x -4)(x -k) + R(x) = (x -2)(x -3)(x -m) + 2R(x)\n\nRearrange:\n\n(x -1)(x -4)(x -k) - (x -2)(x -3)(x -m) = R(x)\n\nBut R(x) is linear, so the left side must be a linear polynomial. Therefore, the left side, which is a cubic minus another cubic, must simplify to something linear, which implies that the cubic terms must cancel out except for a linear term.\n\nThis might be complicated, but perhaps we can evaluate this at certain x values to get equations.\n\nLet me plug in x=0:\n\nLeft side: (-1)(-4)(-k) - (-2)(-3)(-m) = (-1)(-4)(-k) - (6)(-m)= (-4k) +6m\n\nRight side: R(0)=s.\n\nSo, equation: -4k +6m = s.\n\nSimilarly, plug in x=1:\n\nLeft side: (0)(...)(...) - (1-2)(1-3)(1 -m)=0 - (-1)(-2)(1 -m)=0 -2(1 -m)= -2 +2m\n\nRight side: R("
