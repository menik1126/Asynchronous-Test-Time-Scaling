            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Hmm, monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So P(x) should look like x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find. \n\nThe problem says when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when it's divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, they give me P(0) = 5, and I need to find P(5). \n\nAlright, let me recall the Remainder Theorem. When you divide a polynomial P(x) by a linear divisor (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But here, we're dealing with quadratic divisors: (x - 1)(x - 4) and (x - 2)(x - 3). So maybe I can use Polynomial Remainder Theorem, which generalizes the Remainder Theorem for divisors of higher degree.\n\nYes, the Polynomial Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of dividing P(x) by a polynomial D(x) is equal to P(x) evaluated at the roots of D(x). So if D(x) is (x - a)(x - b), then the remainder R(x) satisfies R(a) = P(a) and R(b) = P(b). Similarly, if I divide by another quadratic, say (x - c)(x - d), then the remainder S(x) satisfies S(c) = P(c) and S(d) = P(d). But in this problem, it's said that the remainder when divided by the first quadratic is R(x), and by the second is 2R(x). So, in the first case, dividing by (x - 1)(x - 4), remainder R(x). So R(1) = P(1), R(4) = P(4). Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3).\n\nWait, maybe I can set up equations for R(x) first. Since when P(x) is divided by (x - 1"

            "output": ")(x - 4), the remainder R(x) must be of degree less than 2, so R(x) is linear: R(x) = mx + n.\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So the remainder is a linear polynomial, meaning 2R(x) is also linear, so R(x) is linear as well.\n\nGiven that, I can write equations based on the values of P(x) at certain points.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n1. R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4). So,\n\nP(1) = R(1)\nP(4) = R(4)\n\n2. 2R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3). So,\n\n2R(2) = P(2)\n2R(3) = P(3)\n\n3. P(0) = 5.\n\nAlso, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, and (x - 1)(x - 4) is quadratic, we can write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nSimilarly, since dividing by (x - 2)(x - 3) gives a remainder of 2R(x), we can write:\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nWhere Q1(x) and Q2(x) are linear polynomials because P(x) is degree 3 and the divisors are quadratic, so the quotient must be degree 1.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to involve Q1 and Q2. Since R(x) is a linear polynomial, let me denote R(x) as:\n\nR(x) = ax + b\n\nSo, now, from the problem, P(1) = R(1) = a(1) + b = a + b\n\nP(4) = R(4) = a(4) + b = 4a + b\n\nSimilarly, 2R(2) = 2(a*2 + b) = 4a + 2b\n\nBut 2R(2) = P(2"

So, the remainder 2R(x) is equal to P(2) and P(3) multiplied by the corresponding linear terms?\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Wait, if I have P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x). So, when I plug x = 2, the first term becomes zero, so P(2) = 2R(2). Similarly, P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nThus, P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3). \n\nSince R(x) is linear, R(2) = 2a + b and R(3) = 3a + b.\n\nSo, P(2) = 2*(2a + b) = 4a + 2b\n\nP(3) = 2*(3a + b) = 6a + 2b\n\nSo, now, I have four equations:\n\n1.
