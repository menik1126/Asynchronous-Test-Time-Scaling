That seems complicated, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the units digit of a number depends only on the units digits of the numbers involved. So, I can probably work with modulo 10 arithmetic here. That is, I can compute all operations modulo 10 to find the units digit.\n\nStarting with 4$, which is 4! raised to some tower of exponents. Wait, actually, the superfactorial n\\$ is n!^{{n!^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}. So, for n=4, it's 4!^{{4!^{{4!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{4!}}}}}}}}. Hmm, that seems like a lot. But maybe the exponent tower reduces in a way that I can find a pattern or a cycle in the units digit.\n\nLet me write down the expression step by step:\n\nFirst, 4! is 24. So, 4\\$ = 24^{{24^{{24^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{24}}}}}}}}.\n\nSo, the whole thing is 24 raised to a power that is itself an exponent tower starting with 24, and so on.\n\nBut calculating such a huge exponent directly is impossible. So, I need to find a way to compute the exponent modulo something where the units digit becomes predictable.\n\nSince we\u2019re only interested in the units digit, we can use the fact that for any number a, a^k mod 10 cycles with period depending on a and 10. Euler's theorem tells us that if a and 10 are coprime, then a^\u03c6(10) \u2261 1 mod 10, where \u03c6(10)=4. But 24 and 10 are not coprime because 24 is divisible by 2 and 5. Hmm, so maybe that approach won't directly work. But wait, Euler's theorem works when a and modulus are coprime. So perhaps I can find the exponent modulo \u03c6(10) or something else.\n\nWait"

But since the base is 24, which ends with 4, so maybe the units digit of 24^\u2026 is the same as 4^\u2026 mod 10. So first, maybe I can think of the base as 4. Let me see:\n\nThe units digit of 24^k mod 10 is equal to the units digit of 4^k mod 10, so instead of dealing with 24, I can consider 4 raised to the exponent tower. So, first step simplification: 24^... mod10 \u2261 4^(exponent) mod10. Therefore, I can reframe the problem as finding 4^(huge exponent) mod10.\n\nNow, to compute 4^k mod10, the exponents of 4 cycle every 2 in their last digit. Because:\n\n4^1 = 4 mod10.\n\n4^2 = 16 mod10 \u2192 6.\n\n4^3 = 64 mod10 \u2192 4.\n\n4^4 = 256 mod10 \u2192 6 again.\n\nSo the cycle length here is 2. So the units digit of 4^k alternates between 4 and 6 depending on whether the exponent k is odd or even. So, if the exponent is odd, units digit is 4, even is 6? Wait let me check:\n\nWait:\n\n4^1 =4 \u2192 odd exponent \u2192 4.\n\n4^2 =16 \u2192 even exponent \u21926.\n\n4^3=64 \u2192 exponent3 (odd) \u21924.\n\n4^4=256 \u2192 exponent4 (even)\u21926.\n\nYes, exactly. So cycle length is 2. Therefore, if I can find whether the exponent is even or odd, then I can determine the result.\n\nTherefore, if the exponent in 4^k mod10 is even, units digit 6; odd, 4.\n\nTherefore, to find 4^k mod10, just check if k is even or odd.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the exponent itself is another exponent tower"

So 4\\$ =24^E.\n\nBut 24^E mod10 is equal to 4^E mod10.\n\nSo, if I can compute E mod2, because the cycle length is 2. So, if E is even or odd, then 4^E will be 6 or 4 in mod10.\n\nBut E is 24 raised to some exponent tower: E=24^F, where F is another exponent tower: 24^(24^(...)).\n\nSo, to compute E mod2, which is (24^F) mod2.\n\nBut 24 mod2 is 0. So 24^anything mod2 is 0^anything, which is 0 if the exponent is positive.\n\nWait, but 0 raised to a positive exponent is 0, right? So 24^F mod2 is 0, because 24 is even, so any power of it is even. So E mod2 is 0.\n\nTherefore, E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod10 is 6, as per our earlier observation.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nLet me go through it step by step again.\n\n1. 4\\$ =4!^{{4!^{{...}}}}. 4! is 24.\n\n2. So, 24 raised to a tower of exponents, all of which are 24^... So, we can write 24^(24^(24^...)).\n\n3. So, in mod10, 24 mod10=4. So, the problem reduces to finding 4^(tower exponent) mod10.\n\n4. The tower exponent is 24^(24^(...)). Since 24 is even, any power of it is even. So, the tower exponent is even.\n\n5. So, in 4^(even number) mod10 is 6, because as we saw, 4^even ends with 6, and 4^odd ends with4.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if I considered all possible"

Wait, that's a lot. Wait, but the tower is n! high. So, the height of the exponent tower is n!.\n\nWait, so for n=4, the height is 24. So, the exponent tower is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24. So, the tower is 24 levels high? Wait, no, the height is 24. So, the number of exponents is 24. So, the tower is 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 terms. That's an extremely tall tower.\n\nBut regardless of how tall the tower is, as long as the tower has at least one exponent, the value of the tower is going to be even, right?\n\nWait, but even more, since the base is 24, which is even, so any power of it is even. So, the entire exponent tower is even. Therefore, the exponent E is even, so 4^E mod10 is 6.\n\nWait, but let me think again.

So,\n\nT(1) =24,\n\nT(2)=24^24,\n\nT(3)=24^(24^24),\n\nand so on up to T(24).\n\nThen, the superfactorial 4\\$ is T(24).\n\nWe need to compute T(24) mod10. But as before, since T(24) is 24^T("

Since T(23) =24^(T(22)), and 24 is even, so any power of an even number is even, so T(23) is even, so T(23) mod2=0.\n\nTherefore, 4^T(23) mod10 is 6.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the height (as long as the tower is at least 2 levels high), we can guarantee that the exponent E will be even, so 4^E mod10=6.\n\nBut wait, even if the tower had only 1 level, T(1)=24, which is even, so E=24, which is even, so 4^24 mod10=6. So, same result.\n\nWait, so perhaps the height being n! is just a way to define the tower, but for n=4, it's 24 levels, but because each level is 24, which is even, the exponent in each case is even, so the result is 6.\n\nSo, even without considering the full tower, the fact that the exponent tower is based on 24, which is even, and any power of 24 is even, so the exponent in 4^k is even, giving units digit 6.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I'm correct. What if the tower were to somehow result in an odd number? But since every term in the tower is 24, and 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so the exponent will always be even, no matter how many levels you have.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, yes. Because, for example:\n\nT(1)=24, which is even.\n\nT(2)=24^24, which is even.\n\nT(3)=24^(even), which is even.\n\nEach step, the new tower is 24 raised to an even number, so the result is even.

Then 1\\$ is 1!^1! =1^1=1. Units digit 1. That's correct.\n\nn=2: 2\\$ is 2!^2! =2^2=4. Units digit 4. Correct.\n\nn=3: 3\\$ is 6^6^6^6 (since 3! is 6, and the tower has 6 terms).

Wait, but even so, the exponent tower is 6^6^...^6, which is even, so the exponent is even, so 6^even mod10?\n\nWait, but 6 raised to any power is always 6 mod10. Because 6*6=36, 6^2=36 mod10=6, so 6^anything mod10 is 6. So, 3\\$ would have units digit 6. Let me check:\n\nWait, 3\\$ is 6^(6^(6^...)) with 6 terms. The base is 6, so regardless of the exponent, 6^anything mod10 is 6. So yes, units digit 6. So that works.\n\nWait, so for n=3, the units digit is 6, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: 2!^2! =2^2=4, which is correct.\n\nn=1: 1.\n\nSo, for n=4, following the same logic, since the base is 24, which mod10 is 4, and the exponent is even, so 4^even mod10 is 6. So, the answer should be 6.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me see if there's a case where the exponent could be 0 mod something else.
