            "output": "I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284 first. Proper divisors of a number are all the positive divisors excluding the number itself.\n\nI will start by factoring 284 into its prime factors. 284 divided by 2 is 142, and 142 divided by 2 is 71. Since 71 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 284 is 2² × 71¹.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p⁰ + p¹)(q⁰ + q¹) for a number N = p² × q¹, I calculate the sum of all divisors: (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 71) = (7)(72) = 504.\n\nFinally, I subtract 284 from 504 to find the sum of the proper divisors: 504 - 284 = 220.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. To do this, I'll factorize 220 into its prime components: 220 = 2² × 5¹ × 11¹.\n\nApplying the sum of divisors formula: (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5 + 25)(1 + 11 + 55) = (7)(31)(67) = 7 × 31 × 67 = 130,  Let me calculate that correctly: 7 × 31 = 217, then 217 × 67 = 14,519.\n\nFinally, subtract 220 from 14,519 to get the sum of the proper divisors: 14,519 - 220 = 14,299.\n\nSo, the final answer is 14,299.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of the result obtained in step 1.**\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284\n\n**Prime Factorization of 284:**\n\\[\n284 = 2^2 \\times 71^1\n\\]\n\n**Sum of Divisors (σ(N)):**\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors:\n\\[\nσ(N) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + "
