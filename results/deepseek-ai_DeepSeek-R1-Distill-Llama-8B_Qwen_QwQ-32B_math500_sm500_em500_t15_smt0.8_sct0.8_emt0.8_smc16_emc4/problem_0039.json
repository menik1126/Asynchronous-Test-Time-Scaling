Proper divisors of a number are all its positive divisors excluding the number itself.\n\nStarting with the number 284, I'll list all possible divisors by checking which numbers divide 284 without leaving a remainder. I'll begin with 1, since 1 is a divisor of every integer. Next, I'll check 2, which divides 284 evenly, adding 2 to the list. \n\nContinuing this process, I'll check each subsequent integer up to the square root of 284. When I find a divisor, I'll add both the divisor and its complementary divisor to the list. For example, since 4 divides 284, I'll add 4 and 71 to the divisors. This method ensures that I capture all proper divisors efficiently.\n\nAfter identifying all the proper divisors of 284, I'll calculate their sum. This total will then be used to find the sum of the proper divisors of this total, which is the final step in solving the problem.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n\nA proper divisor of a number \\( N \\) is a positive integer that divides \\( N \\) without leaving a remainder, excluding \\( N \\) itself.\n\nLet's list all proper divisors of 284:\n\n1. Start with 1 (since 1 is a divisor of every integer).\n2. Divide 284 by 2: \\( 284 \\div 2 = 142 \\). So, 2 is a proper divisor.\n3. Divide 284 by 4: \\( 284 \\div 4 = 71 \\). So, 4 is a proper divisor. Its complementary divisor is 71.\n4. Since \\( \\sqrt{284} \\approx 16.85 \\), we'll check divisors up to 16.\n\n- \\( 284 \\div 6 = 47.333 \\) (not an integer).\n- \\( 284 \\div 8 = 35.5 \\) (not an integer).\n- \\( 284 \\div 12 = 23.666 \\) (not an integer).\n- \\( 284 \\div 14 = 20.285 \\) (not an integer).\n- \\( 284 \\div 16 = 17."
