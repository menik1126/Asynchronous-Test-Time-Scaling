The second term is 1, which is obtained by adding 1 to the first term. The third term is 1, which is the result of multiplying the second term by 1. The fourth term is 3, calculated by adding 2 to the third term. The fifth term is 6, achieved by multiplying the fourth term by 2. The sixth term is 9, obtained by adding 3 to the fifth term. The seventh term is 27, the result of multiplying the sixth term by 3.\n\nSo, the pattern alternates between adding the next consecutive integer and multiplying by it. Starting from the first term, we can generalize this process to find each subsequent term.\n\nTo find the first term greater than 125, I should continue applying this alternating addition and multiplication process until the term exceeds 125.\n\nLet me list out the terms step by step to identify when the term surpasses 125.\n\nStarting with 0:\n- Term 1: 0\n- Term 2: 0 + 1 = 1\n- Term 3: 1 * 1 = 1\n- Term 4: 1 + 2 = 3\n- Term 5: 3 * 2 = 6\n- Term 6: 6 + 3 = 9\n- Term 7: 9 * 3 = 27\n- Term 8: 27 + 4 = 31\n- Term 9: 31 * 4 = 124\n- Term 10: 124 + 5 = 129\n\nTerm 10 is 129, which is the first term greater than 125.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to identify the first term greater than 125.\n\n### Understanding the Sequence:\n1. **Start with the first term:** \\( a_1 = 0 \\)\n2. **Alternating operations:**\n   - **Add the next integer when the term number is odd.**\n   - **Multiply by the next integer when the term number is even.**\n\n### Generating the Terms:\nLet's compute each term using the alternating operations:\n\n- **Term 1:** \\( a_1 = 0 \\)\n- **Term 2:** \\( a_2 = a_1 + 1 = 0 + "

    "question": "In the sequence 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, ..., the first term is 0.   Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and  multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1.  For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.  What is the value of the first term that is greater than 125?",
