            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of a fraction. The fraction has three terms in the numerator: 5 over the square root of 80, plus the square root of 845 over 9, plus the square root of 45. And all of that is divided by the square root of 5. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write it out to make sure I have it right:\n\n\u221a[(5 / \u221a80 + \u221a845 / 9 + \u221a45) / \u221a5]\n\nAlright, so I need to simplify the numerator first, then deal with the denominator of the fraction, and then take the square root of the whole thing. Let's start by simplifying each term in the numerator.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 / \u221a80. I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually preferred, so I should rationalize it. To do that, I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by \u221a80. That gives me (5\u221a80) / 80. Then I can simplify \u221a80. Let me think, 80 is 16 times 5, right? And 16 is 4 squared, so \u221a80 is \u221a(16*5) which is \u221a16 * \u221a5 = 4\u221a5. So substituting back in, (5*4\u221a5) / 80. That simplifies to (20\u221a5)/80, which can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 20. That gives \u221a5 / 4.\n\nAlright, so the first term simplifies to \u221a5 / 4.\n\nMoving on to the second term: \u221a845 / 9. Let me see if I can simplify \u221a845. 845 divided by 5 is 169, right? 5*169 is 845, and 169 is 13 squared. So \u221a845 is \u221a(5*169) which is \u221a5 * \u221a169 = \u221a5 * 13 = 13\u221a5. So the second term becomes 13\u221a5 / 9.\n\nOkay, so now the second term is 13\u221a5 / 9.\n\nThird term: \u221a45. Let me simplify that. 45 is 9*5, so \u221a45 is \u221a(9*5) = \u221a9 * \u221a5 = 3\u221a5.\n\nSo the numerator now"

            "output": " has three terms:\n\nFirst term: \u221a5 / 4\n\nSecond term: 13\u221a5 / 9\n\nThird term: 3\u221a5\n\nHmm, all three terms have \u221a5 in them, so I can factor that out. Let me rewrite the numerator as:\n\n\u221a5 (1/4 + 13/9 + 3)\n\nLet me compute the constants inside the parentheses. So I have 1/4, 13/9, and 3. To add these, I'll need a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 is 3/1). The least common denominator for 4 and 9 is 36. So let me convert each term:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = 52/36\n\n3 = 108/36\n\nAdding them up: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = 169/36.\n\nSo the numerator becomes \u221a5 * (169/36) = (169\u221a5)/36.\n\nNow, the entire fraction inside the square root is this numerator divided by \u221a5. So:\n\n[(169\u221a5)/36] / \u221a5\n\nDividing by \u221a5 is the same as multiplying by 1/\u221a5. So:\n\n(169\u221a5) / 36 * 1/\u221a5\n\nThe \u221a5 in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, leaving us with 169/36.\n\nSo now the original expression simplifies to the square root of 169/36.\n\n\u221a(169/36) is equal to \u221a169 divided by \u221a36, which is 13/6.\n\nLet me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. First term: 5 / \u221a80 became \u221a5 /4 after rationalizing. \u221a80 is 4\u221a5, so 5/(4\u221a5) becomes (5\u221a5)/(4*5) = \u221a5/4. That seems correct.\n\n2. Second term: \u221a845 /9 became 13\u221a5 /9. \u221a845 is \u221a(5*169) =13\u221a5. Yes, 13\u221a5 divided by 9 makes sense.\n\n3. Third term: \u221a45 became 3\u221a5. Since \u221a45 is \u221a(9*5)=3\u221a5. Correct"

Converting to 36 denominator:\n\n1/4 =9/36, 13/9=52/36. So 9/36 +52/36=61/36. Then adding 3, which is 108/36. So 61 +108=169, so 169/36. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo numerator is 169\u221a5/36. Divided by \u221a5: (169\u221a5/36)*(1/\u221a5)=169/36. Then taking square root: \u221a(169/36)=13/6.\n\nI think that's correct.
