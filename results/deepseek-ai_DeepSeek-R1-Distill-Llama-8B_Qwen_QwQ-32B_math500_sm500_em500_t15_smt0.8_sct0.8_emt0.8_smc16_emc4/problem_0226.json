            "output": "First, I need to determine Bill's total displacement in the south direction. He walks 1/2 mile south twice, which adds up to 1 mile south.\n\nNext, I'll calculate his displacement east. He walks 3/4 mile east once, resulting in 3/4 mile east.\n\nNow, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point. The south displacement forms one leg of a right triangle, the east displacement forms the other leg, and the straight-line distance is the hypotenuse.\n\nPlugging in the values, the formula becomes √(1² + (3/4)²). Calculating further, this is √(1 + 0.5625) = √1.5625.\n\nThe square root of 1.5625 is 1.25 miles. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, the final answer is 1.25 miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step to determine how far Bill is from his starting point in a direct line.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total South Displacement**\n- Bill walks **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)** mile south twice.\n- **Total South Displacement:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile south.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate East Displacement**\n- Bill walks **\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)** mile east once.\n- **East Displacement:** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\n- To find the straight-line distance from the starting point, we can visualize this as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.\n- Let \\( \\text{Distance} \\) be the straight-line distance.\n- South displacement \\( = 1 \\) mile\n- East displacement \\( = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \\) miles\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{South Displacement})^2 + (\\text{East Displacement})^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0.75^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1 + 0.5625}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{"
