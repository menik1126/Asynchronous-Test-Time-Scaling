For simplicity, let's fix the Independent (I) in a specific seat.\n\n2. **Arrange the Political Parties as Blocks**:\n   - Now, consider the three parties as three separate blocks: Democrats (D), Republicans (R), and Independent (I).\n   - Arrange these blocks around the table. However, since we've fixed the Independent's position, we only need to arrange the remaining two blocks (D and R).\n   - The number of ways to arrange two blocks around the table is \\((2-1)! = 1\\) way.\n\n3. **Arrange Members Within Each Party**:\n   - Each party must sit together, so within each block:\n     - Democrats: \\(5!\\) ways to arrange the 5 Democrats.\n     - Republicans: \\(5!\\) ways to arrange the 5 Republicans.\n     - Independent: Already fixed, so no additional arrangements needed.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements**:\n   - Multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the members within each block:\n"

Fixing the Independent's position already accounts for rotational symmetry, so the blocks (D and R) can be arranged in \\(2!\\) ways (not \\(1!\\)), since there are two remaining blocks. \n\n**Corrected Steps**:\n- After fixing the Independent, the two remaining blocks (D and R) can be arranged in \\(2!\\) ways.\n- Total arrangements: \\(2! \\times 5! \\times 5! = 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 = 28800\\).\n\nWait, but fixing the Independent's position reduces the circular permutations. Let me re-examine:\n\nActually, when fixing the Independent's block, the remaining two blocks (D and R) can be arranged in \\(2!\\) ways (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Thus, the correct total is:\n\n\\[\n2! \\times 5! \\times 5! = 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 = 28800\n\\]\n\nBut hold on, the initial step of fixing the Independent's position already removes rotational symmetry, so the blocks can be arranged in \\(2!\\) ways. Therefore, the final answer is indeed \\(2 \\times (5!)^2\\).\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\boxed{28800}\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem states there are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. The Independent is a single person, so when we treat the parties as blocks, the Independent is a block of size 1. \n\nThe standard formula for circular arrangements with blocks is: \n\nFirst, fix one block to account for rotation. Then, arrange the remaining blocks linearly. \n\nThe number of ways to arrange the blocks is \\((k-1)!\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of blocks. Here, there are 3 blocks (D, R, I). So, fixing one block (say, I), the remaining two"
