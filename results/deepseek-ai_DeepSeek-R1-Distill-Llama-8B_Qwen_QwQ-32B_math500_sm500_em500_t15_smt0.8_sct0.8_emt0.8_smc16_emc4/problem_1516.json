            "output": "To determine how many possible license plates can be created, I'll break down the problem into the components of the plate: the letter part and the number part.\n\nFirst, for the letters, there are 26 possible letters in the English alphabet. Since both letters need to be different, the first letter has 26 options, and the second letter has 25 remaining options.\n\nNext, for the numbers, there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9). Similar to the letters, both digits must be different, so the first digit has 10 options, and the second digit has 9 remaining options.\n\nTo find the total number of license plates, I'll multiply the number of possibilities for each part. That is, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations.\n\nSo, the total number of license plates will be 26 multiplied by 25 multiplied by 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nCalculating this gives 26 * 25 * 10 * 9 = 65,000 possible license plates.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll consider each part of the plate separately and then multiply the possibilities.\n\n1. **Letters:**\n   - There are 26 different letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).\n   - Since both letters must be different:\n     - **First letter:** 26 options\n     - **Second letter:** 25 options (because it can't be the same as the first letter)\n   \n   **Total combinations for letters:** \\( 26 \\times 25 = 650 \\)\n\n2. **Numbers:**\n   - The numbers are from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible digits.\n   - Since both numbers must be different:\n     - **First number:** 10 options\n     - **Second number:** 9 options (because it can't be the same as the first number)\n   \n   **Total combinations for numbers:** \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\)\n\n3. **Total License Plates:**\n   - Multiply the total letter combinations by the total number combinations:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total license plates} = 650 \\times 90 = 58,500\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(\\boxed{58,\\!500}\\)"
