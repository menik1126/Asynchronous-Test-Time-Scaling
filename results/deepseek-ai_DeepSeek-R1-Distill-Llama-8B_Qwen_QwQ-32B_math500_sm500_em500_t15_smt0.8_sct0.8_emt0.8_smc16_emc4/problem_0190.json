            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where z is given as 1 + i, and w is (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). I need to find the modulus of w, which is |w|. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the modulus of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, if I can express w as a complex number x + yi, then |w| would be sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). But w is a fraction, so maybe I should first simplify it by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. That way, I can separate the real and imaginary parts.\n\nSo, let's write down w: \n\nw = (3z + 1) / (5z + 7)\n\nSince z = 1 + i, let me substitute that in:\n\nw = [3(1 + i) + 1] / [5(1 + i) + 7]\n\nLet me compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 3(1 + i) + 1. That should be 3*1 + 3*i + 1, which is 3 + 3i + 1. Adding the real parts: 3 + 1 = 4, so the numerator becomes 4 + 3i.\n\nNow the denominator: 5(1 + i) + 7. That's 5*1 + 5*i + 7, which is 5 + 5i + 7. Adding the real parts: 5 + 7 = 12, so the denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nSo now, w = (4 + 3i) / (12 + 5i). To rationalize the denominator, I need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is 12 - 5i.\n\nLet's do that:\n\nw = [(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i)] / [(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)]\n\nLet me compute the denominator first because that's often simpler. \n\nDenominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i) is a difference of squares, so it's 12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2. 12\u00b2 is 144,"

            "output": " and (5i)\u00b2 is 25i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 is -1, this becomes 144 - 25*(-1) = 144 + 25 = 169.\n\nSo the denominator is 169.\n\nNow the numerator: (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i). I'll use the distributive property (FOIL) to expand this.\n\nFirst, multiply 4 by 12, which is 48. Then 4 by -5i, which is -20i. Next, 3i by 12 is 36i. Finally, 3i by -5i is -15i\u00b2.\n\nSo let's write that out:\n\n48 - 20i + 36i - 15i\u00b2.\n\nNow, combine like terms. First, real parts: 48. Then, the imaginary parts: (-20i + 36i) = 16i. Then, the -15i\u00b2 term. Since i\u00b2 is -1, this becomes -15*(-1) = 15. So the real parts now are 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nPutting it all together, the numerator is 63 + 16i.\n\nSo now, w = (63 + 16i) / 169.\n\nWe can write this as 63/169 + (16/169)i.\n\nSo, the modulus |w| is the square root of (63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to factor out 1/169 first. So:\n\n|w| = sqrt[(63\u00b2 + 16\u00b2) / 169\u00b2] = sqrt[(3969 + 256) / (169\u00b2)] = sqrt[4225 / (169\u00b2)].\n\nWait, 4225 divided by 169 squared. Let me calculate this.\n\nFirst, 169 squared is 28561. So, 4225 / 28561. Hmm, let me see if 4225 is a square number. I think 65 squared is 4225. Yes, because 60\u00b2 is 3600, and 65\u00b2 is 4225.\n\nSo, sqrt(4225) is 65, and sqrt(28561) is 169. So then, |w| = 65 / 169. Simplify that fraction.\n\n65 and 169 are both divisible by 13. 65 \u00f713 is "

            "output": "5, and 169 \u00f713 is 13. So, 65/169 = 5/13.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So |w| is 5/13.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Substituted z = 1 + i correctly into both numerator and denominator.\n2. Expanded both the numerator and denominator correctly after substitution.\n3. Calculated the denominator's modulus correctly, using the conjugate, which is 12 -5i.\n4. Expanded the numerator using FOIL correctly, ending up with 63 + 16i.\n5. Then, separated the real and imaginary parts and squared each, added them, took the square root.\n6. Simplified by noticing that 63\u00b2 + 16\u00b2 is 4225, which is 65 squared, and 169 squared is 28561. So sqrt(4225/28561) is 65/169, which simplifies to 5/13.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check 63\u00b2: 60\u00b2 is 3600, 3\u00b2 is 9, 2*60*3=360, so (60+3)^2=3600+360+9=3969. Yes, that's correct. 16\u00b2 is 256. So 3969 + 256 is 4225, correct. 4225 is 65\u00b2, and 169\u00b2 is 28561. So sqrt is 65/169, which simplifies to 5/13.\n\nTherefore, the modulus of w is 5/13.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( |w| \\), we start with \\( w = \\dfrac{3z + 1}{5z + 7} \\), where \\( z = 1 + i \\).\n\n1.
