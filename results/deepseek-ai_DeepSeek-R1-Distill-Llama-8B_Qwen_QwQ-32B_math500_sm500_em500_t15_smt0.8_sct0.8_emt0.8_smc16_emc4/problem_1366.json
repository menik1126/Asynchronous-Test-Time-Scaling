So, I can express G as 13k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nIt's also given that there are more girls than boys, which means G > B.\n\nSince the total number of students is 35, the equation becomes:\n\n13k + B = 35\n\nTo find B, I'll solve for it:\n\nB = 35 - 13k\n\nNow, I need to find a value of k such that G > B. Substituting B:\n\n13k > 35 - 13k\n\nAdding 13k to both sides gives:\n\n26k > 35\n\nDividing both sides by 26:\n\nk > 35/26\n\nSince k must be an integer, the smallest possible value for k is 2.\n\nNow, substituting k = 2 into B:\n\nB = 35 - 13*2 = 35 - 26 = 9\n\nTherefore, there are 9 boys at the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( G \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is more than the number of boys (\\( G > B \\)).\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = number of boys\n\n**Step 1:** Express the total number of students.\n\\[\nG + B = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Since \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13, we can write \\( G = 13k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute \\( G = 13k \\) into the total students equation.\n\\[\n13k + B = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Solve for \\( B \\).\n\\[\nB = 35 - 13k\n\\]\n\n**Step 5:** Use the condition \\( G > B \\) to find the possible value of \\( k \\).\n\\[\n13k > 35 - 13k\n\\]\n\\[\n13k + 13k > 35\n\\]\n\\[\n26k > 35\n\\]\n\\[\nk > \\frac{35}{26} \\approx"
