            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of the integers C and D. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, I remember that when you have fractions like this, especially with variables in the denominator, it's often useful to combine them into a single fraction. That way, you can compare the numerators or maybe use partial fractions to find C and D. \n\nFirst, let me note the denominators: (x - 3) and (x + 8). The least common denominator (LCD) would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). So, I need to combine the left side over this LCD.\n\nLet me rewrite the left-hand side (LHS) with the LCD:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check the denominator on the right side. The quadratic is x² + 5x -24. I should factor that to make sure it's the same as (x - 3)(x + 8). Let's see: factors of -24 that add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3, yes. So, x² +5x -24 factors to (x - 3)(x + 8). That matches the LCD, good.\n\nSo now, I can set the numerators equal to each other because the denominators are the same:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, my goal is to find the values of C and D such that this equation holds for all x except x = 3 and x = -8. That means the left side must be equal to the right side as a polynomial identity. So, I can expand the left side and then compare coefficients for the corresponding powers of x.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D\n\nCombine"

So, if I set the coefficients equal:\n\nFor the x term:\nC + D = 4\n\nFor the constant term:\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations:\n\n1) C + D = 4\n2) 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve this system for C and D. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nFrom equation 1), I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for D:\n\nD = 4 - C\n\nNow, substitute D in equation 2):\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, substitute back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Therefore, the product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, plugging C = -1 and D =5 into the combined numerator:\n\n(-1)(x +8) +5(x -3) = -x -8 +5x -15 = ( -x +5x ) + ( -8 -15 ) = 4x -23\n\nYes, that's correct because it matches the right side.\n\nSo, that's correct. Therefore, CD = (-1)(5) = -5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), we first combine the fractions on the left-hand side over the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us the equation:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D"
