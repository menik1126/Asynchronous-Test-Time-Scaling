Since it's an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2, the number of terms can be calculated using the formula: \n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{(199 - 1)}{2} + 1 = 100\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll use the formula for the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers, which is \\( n^2 \\). So, the sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = 100^2 = 10,000\n\\]\n\nFinally, I'll find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7. Calculating \\( 10,000 \\div 7 \\) gives a quotient of 1428 and a remainder of 4. Therefore, the modulo 7 remainder is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo 7 remainder of the sum \\( 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Terms:**\n   \n   The given sequence is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. The first term \\( a = 1 \\) and the last term \\( l = 199 \\). The number of terms \\( n \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{(l - a)}{d} + 1 = \\frac{(199 - 1)}{2} + 1 = 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**\n   \n   The sum \\( S \\) of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l) = \\frac{100}{2} \\times (1 + 199) = 50 \\times 200 = 10,000\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Find the Modulo 7 Remainder:**\n   \n   To find \\( 10,000 \\mod 7 \\), perform the division:\n   \\[\n   10,000 \\div 7 = 1428 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n"
