I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem, which says that any possible rational root, p/q, of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nFirst, let me rewrite the equation:\n\n\\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\).\n\nThe leading coefficient is 1 (since the x^4 term has coefficient 1), and the constant term is -14. So according to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a factor of -14 divided by a factor of 1. That simplifies things because the possible rational roots are just the integer factors of -14. \n\nSo, the possible integer roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114. I should test each of these to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet me start with x=1:\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1+5+9) - (1+14) = 15 - 15 = 0\\). \n\nOh, so x=1 is a root! That means (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. Nice, so I can factor out (x - 1) from the polynomial.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for all integer roots, so I might have to find more. Let's test x=-1:\n\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 -14\\). Let me compute that step by step:\n\n1 (from x^4) minus 5 gives -4, plus 9 gives 5, plus 1 gives 6, minus 14 gives -8. So that's not zero. So x=-1 is not a root.\n\nNext, x=2:\n\n\\(2"

            "output": "^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14\\).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n16 (from 2^4) plus 5*(8) = 40, plus 9*(4) = 36, minus 2 is -2, minus 14 is -16.\n\nAdding up: 16 + 40 = 56, +36 = 92, -2=90, -14=76. So 76 \u2260 0. Not a root.\n\nHow about x=-2:\n\n\\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) -14\\).\n\nCompute:\n\n16 (from (-2)^4) plus 5*(-8) = -40, plus 9*(4)=36, plus 2=+2, minus14.\n\nAdding: 16 -40 = -24 +36=12 +2=14 -14=0. Oh! So x=-2 is also a root. Nice. So x=-2 is a root.\n\nNow, x=7:\n\nLet me test x=7:\n\n\\(7^4 +5*7^3 +9*7^2 -7 -14\\).\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n7^4 = 2401, 5*343=1715, 9*49=441. So 2401 +1715 = 4116, +441=4557. Then subtract 7 and 14: 4557 -21=4536. Definitely not zero.\n\nWhat about x=-7:\n\n(-7)^4=2401, 5*(-7)^3=5*(-343)=-1715, 9*(-7)^2=9*49=441, then -(-7)=+7, -14.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n2401 -1715=686 +441=1127 +7=1134 -14=1120 \u22600. So not a root.\n\nNext, x=14:\n\n14^4 is a big number, let me compute 14^2=196, then 14^4=196^2=38416. Then 5*14^3=5*(2744)=13720, 9*14^2=9*196=1764. So putting it all together:\n\n38416 +13720 = 52136 +1764=538"

Let me compute each term:\n\n(-14)^4 = 14^4=38416, 5*(-14)^3=5*(-2744)=-13720, 9*(-14)^2=9*196=1764, -(-14)=+14, -14.\n\nSo adding: 38416 -13720=24696 +1764=26460 +14=26474 -14=26460. Not zero.\n\nSo the possible integer roots we've tested so far are x=1 and x=-2. So maybe those are the only integer roots. But just to be thorough, perhaps I should perform polynomial division to factor out these roots and see if the resulting polynomial has any more integer roots.\n\nSince x=1 is a root, let's divide the original polynomial by (x - 1) to find the reduced polynomial.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nSet up the coefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nUsing root x=1:\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1*1=1, add to next coefficient: 5 +1=6.\n\nMultiply 6*1=6, add to next coefficient: 9+6=15.\n\nMultiply 15*1=15, add to next coefficient: -1 +15=14.\n\nMultiply 14*1=14, add to next coefficient: -14 +14=0. So no remainder, which we already knew.\n\nSo the reduced polynomial is \\(x^3 + 6x^2 +15x +14\\).\n\nNow, we can try to factor this cubic polynomial. Let's see if it has any integer roots.\n\nUsing the Rational Root Theorem again on the cubic, possible roots are factors of 14 (since the constant term is 14) divided by 1, so possible roots \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nTesting x=1 again:\n\n1 +6 +15 +14=36\u22600.\n\nx=-1:\n\n-1 +6*(-1)^2= -1 +6=5, +15*(-1)= -15, +14.

Wait, let me recompute: For the cubic, x=-1:\n\n(-1)^3 +6*(-1)^2 +15*(-1) +14 = -1 +6*1 + (-15) +14.\n\nSo that's -1 +6=5, 5-15=-10, -10+14=4.

So x=-2 is a root again.\n\nGreat, so x=-2 is a root of the cubic. Therefore, (x +2) is a factor.\n\nLet's perform synthetic division on the cubic \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\) with root x=-2.\n\nSet up coefficients: 1, 6, 15, 14.\n\nUsing root x=-2:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1*(-2)= -2, add to 6: 6 + (-2)=4.\n\nMultiply 4*(-2)= -8, add to 15:15 + (-8)=7.\n\nMultiply 7*(-2)= -14, add to 14:14 + (-14)=0.

To find its roots, we can compute the discriminant: \\(b^2 -4ac = 16 -28 = -12\\). Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots, let alone integer roots. \n\nTherefore, all integer roots of the original equation are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nWait, just to double-check, I should make sure there are no other integer roots.
