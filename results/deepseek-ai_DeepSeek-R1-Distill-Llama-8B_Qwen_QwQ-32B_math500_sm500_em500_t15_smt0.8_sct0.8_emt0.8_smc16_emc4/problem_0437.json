            "output": "First, I need to identify the pattern in the sequence of numbers. The series is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., 199. This is an arithmetic sequence where each number increases by 2.\n\nNext, I'll determine the total number of terms in the series. Since the series starts at 1 and ends at 199, with a common difference of 2, the number of terms can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of terms = [(Last term - First term) / Common difference] + 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nNumber of terms = [(199 - 1) / 2] + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100 terms.\n\nNow, I'll find the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series using the formula:\n\nSum = (Number of terms / 2) × (First term + Last term)\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\nSum = (100 / 2) × (1 + 199) = 50 × 200 = 10,000\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 7, I'll perform the division:\n\n10,000 ÷ 7 = 1,428 with a remainder of 4.\n\nTherefore, the remainder of the sum when divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Series Type**:\n   - This is an **arithmetic series** where each term increases by \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms**:\n   - The series starts at \\(1\\) and ends at \\(199\\), with a common difference of \\(2\\).\n   - The number of terms (\\(n\\)) can be calculated using:\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{(Last\\ term - First\\ term)}{Common\\ difference} + 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{(199 - 1)}{2} + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Series**:\n   - The sum (\\(S\\)) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series is:\n"
