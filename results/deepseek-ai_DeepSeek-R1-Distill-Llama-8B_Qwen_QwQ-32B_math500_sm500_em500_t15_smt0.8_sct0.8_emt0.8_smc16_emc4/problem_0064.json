Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the greatest common divisor, or gcd, of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So I need to find the largest possible gcd that divides both n + 7 and 2n + 1.\n\nLet me denote d as the gcd of (n + 7) and (2n + 1). That is, d = gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1). My goal is to find the maximum possible value of d.\n\nNow, since d divides both n + 7 and 2n + 1, it must also divide any linear combination of these two numbers. Maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here, which is a method to find the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm.\n\nSo, let me apply the Euclidean algorithm to n + 7 and 2n + 1. The Euclidean algorithm says that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b). So here, a is 2n + 1 and b is n + 7.\n\nLet me compute (2n + 1) mod (n + 7). To do this, I can express 2n + 1 as 2*(n + 7) - 13. Let me check that:\n\n2*(n + 7) = 2n + 14.\n\nSo, 2n + 14 - 13 = 2n + 1.\n\nTherefore, 2n + 1 = 2*(n + 7) - 13.\n\nThis means that when I divide 2n + 1 by n + 7, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is -13. But in the Euclidean algorithm, we usually work with positive remainders, so the remainder is 13 - maybe? Wait, no, the remainder has to be less than the divisor and positive. So, if the remainder is negative, we can add the divisor to make it positive.\n\nSo, 2n + 1 divided by n + 7 is 2 with a remainder of 13. Because:\n\nLet me verify: 2*(n"

Wait, that doesn't seem like 13. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, actually, the Euclidean algorithm says that the remainder when you divide a by b is a - b*floor(a/b). So in this case, a is 2n + 1, and b is n + 7.\n\nCompute (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13. So the remainder is -13, which is negative. To make it positive, we can add (n + 7) to it.\n\nWait, why do we do that? Because the remainder should be less than the divisor, n + 7. So, if it's negative, adding the divisor will give a positive remainder less than the divisor.\n\nSo, let me do that: (-13) + (n + 7) = n - 6. Now, is n - 6 less than n + 7? Yes, because n - 6 < n + 7 for positive n. So the remainder is n - 6.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I made a wrong turn here. Let me reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write 2n + 1 as q*(n + 7) + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. We found that q is 2, and the remainder is -13. So 2n + 1 = 2*(n + 7) - 13.\n\nBut the problem is that the remainder can't be negative in the context of the Euclidean algorithm. So perhaps I need to adjust for that.\n\nSo, the Euclidean algorithm says that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b), where a mod b is the remainder when a is divided by b, which is always non-negative and less than b. So, in this case, since 2n + 1 is a, and n + 7 is b, let's"

Wait, but adding (n +7) would give us -13 + (n +7) = n -6. But that's still not necessarily positive. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting me confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nLet me compute gcd(n +7, 2n +1). Let me denote d as a common divisor. So d divides (n +7) and (2n +1). Therefore, d divides any linear combination of these two. For example, d divides (2n +1) - 2*(n +7). Let me compute that:\n\n(2n +1) - 2*(n +7) = 2n +1 -2n -14 = -13. So, d divides -13. Since d is a positive integer, it must divide 13.\n\nAh! That's better. So, since d divides 13, the possible values of d are the divisors of 13, which are 1 and 13. Since 13 is prime. Therefore, the greatest possible value of gcd(n +7, 2n +1) is 13, provided that there exists an n such that 13 divides both n +7 and 2n +1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible gcd is 13, but we need to check if such an n exists.\n\nSo, to confirm, let's see if there exists an integer n where 13 divides both n +7 and 2n +1.\n\nIf 13 divides n +7, then n ≡ -7 mod 13. Which is the same as n ≡ 6 mod 13 (since -7 +13 =6).\n\nNow, let's check if 2n +1 is divisible by 13 when n ≡6 mod13.\n\nSubstitute n =13k +6 for some integer k.\n\nThen 2n +1 =2*(13k +6) +1 =26k +12 +1 =26k +13 =13*(2k +1)."

Let me pick n =6.\n\nThen, n +7 =13, and 2n +1=13. So gcd(13,13)=13. That works.\n\nWhat if I pick another n, say n =19 (which is 13*1 +6). Then n +7=26, and 2n +1=39. gcd(26,39)=13.\n\nAnother one: n=32 (13*2 +6). Then, n +7=39, and 2n +1=65. gcd(39,65)=13.\n\nSo it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value is indeed 13.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the greatest possible value of gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1), we start by denoting d as this gcd. Since d divides both n + 7 and 2n + 1, it must also divide any linear combination of these two numbers. \n\nWe compute the linear combination:\n\\[\n(2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13\n\\]\nThus, d divides -13, meaning d must be a divisor of 13. The positive divisors of 13 are 1 and 13. The greatest of these is 13.\n\nTo confirm that 13 is achievable, we find n such that both n + 7 and 2n + 1 are divisible by 13. Setting \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\) (or \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\)), we substitute into 2n + 1:\n\\[\n2(13k + 6) + 1 = 26k + 13 = 13(2k + 1)\n\\]\nThis shows 2n + 1 is divisible by 13. Hence, the greatest possible gcd is indeed 13.\n\n**Final Answer:** The greatest possible value is \\boxed{13}."
