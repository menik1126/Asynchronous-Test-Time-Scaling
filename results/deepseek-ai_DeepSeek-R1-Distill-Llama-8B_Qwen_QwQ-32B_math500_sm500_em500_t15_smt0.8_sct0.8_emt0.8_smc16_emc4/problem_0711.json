            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many y-intercepts does the graph of the parabola x = y² - 4y - 1 have?\" Hmm, y-intercepts... I remember that for a function, the y-intercept is where it crosses the y-axis, which means the x-value is zero. So, to find the y-intercept(s) of this parabola, I need to set x to zero and solve for y.\n\nAlright, let's write that down. The equation is x = y² - 4y - 1. Setting x = 0, so we have:\n\n0 = y² - 4y - 1.\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of y. To solve for y, I can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it factors nicely. The standard form is ay² + by + c = 0, so here a=1, b=-4, and c=-1.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -1 (since a*c = 1*(-1) = -1) and add up to -4 (the coefficient of y). Hmm, let's think. The factors of -1 are 1 and -1. So, 1 and -1 add up to 0, not -4. That doesn't work. Maybe it doesn't factor nicely, so I'll need to use the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula is y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Plugging in the values, a=1, b=-4, c=-1:\n\nDiscriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4*1*(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20.\n\nSince the discriminant is 20, which is positive, there are two real solutions. So, that means there are two y-intercepts.\n\nLet me actually solve for y to find the points. Using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [4 ± √20]/2.\n\nSimplify √20, which is 2√5, so:\n\ny = [4 ± 2√5]/2 = 2 ± √5.\n\nSo, the two y-intercepts are at y = 2 + √5 and y = 2 - √5. Therefore, the graph crosses the y-axis at"

So, discriminant is positive, two real roots. So, yeah, two y-intercepts.\n\nI think that's all. So, the answer should be two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the y-intercepts of the parabola defined by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), we set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n1. Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n   \\]\n\n2. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\n3. Calculate the discriminant:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20\n   \\]\n\n4.
