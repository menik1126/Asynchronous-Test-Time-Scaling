            "output": "Ringo needs to calculate the absolute value of (1 - i) raised to the 8th power.\n\nFirst, I'll find the magnitude of (1 - i). The magnitude of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So for 1 - i, the magnitude is sqrt(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = sqrt(2).\n\nRaising the magnitude to the 8th power gives (sqrt(2))^8. Simplifying this, (sqrt(2))^2 is 2, so (sqrt(2))^8 is 2^4 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is 16.\n</think>\n\nRingo needs to calculate the absolute value of the complex number \\((1 - i)\\) raised to the 8th power. Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Complex Number:**\n   The complex number in question is \\(1 - i\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit with the property \\(i^2 = -1\\). The absolute value (or magnitude) of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   |a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Magnitude of \\(1 - i\\):**\n   Applying the formula for the magnitude:\n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Raising the Magnitude to the 8th Power:**\n   Since the magnitude of \\( (1 - i) \\) is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), raising it to the 8th power gives:\n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n   \\]\n   Simplifying \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\):\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{(1/2) \\times 8} = 2^4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   Therefore, the absolute value of \\((1 - i)^8\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{16}\n   \\]"
