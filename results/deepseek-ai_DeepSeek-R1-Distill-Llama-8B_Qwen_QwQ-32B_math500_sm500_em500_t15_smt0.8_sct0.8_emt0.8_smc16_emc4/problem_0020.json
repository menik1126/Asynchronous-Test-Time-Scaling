The modulus of a complex number a + bi is \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, |1 - i| is \u221a(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = \u221a2.\n\nNext, since |(1 - i)\u2078| is the modulus raised to the 8th power, I can write it as (\u221a2)\u2078.\n\nRaising \u221a2 to the 8th power is the same as (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(8/2) = 2^4 = 16.\n\nTherefore, |(1 - i)\u2078| equals 16.\n</think>\n\nLet's calculate \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\) step by step.\n\n1. **First, compute the modulus of \\(1 - i\\):**\n   \n   The modulus of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is given by \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).\n   \n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Raise the modulus to the 8th power:**\n   \n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = \\left(|1 - i|\\right)^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{8 \\times (1/2)} = 2^4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{16}\\)"
