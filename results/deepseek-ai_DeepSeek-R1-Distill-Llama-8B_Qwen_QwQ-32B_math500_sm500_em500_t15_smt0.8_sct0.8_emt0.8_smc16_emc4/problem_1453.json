Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Alright, so I have exponential terms on both sides. I remember that sometimes when you have exponents with the same base or related bases, you can manipulate the equation to solve for the variable. But here, the bases are 3 and 10, which are different. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.\n\nWait, I notice that 3^{2x} can be rewritten as (3^x)^2 because when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So, 3^{2x} is the same as (3^x)^2. Let me write that down: (3^x)^2 + 19 = 10^x. That might make it a bit easier because now I have terms that are squared and to the first power. Maybe I can set y = 3^x and z = 10^x or something like that. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet me let y = 3^x. Then 3^{2x} would be y^2, right? Because (3^x)^2 = y^2. So the equation becomes y^2 + 19 = 10^x. But 10^x is another term I can express in terms of y or maybe another substitution. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express both sides in terms of the same base or take logarithms on both sides. I know that logarithms can be useful when dealing with exponential equations because they allow me to bring down the exponents.\n\nBut before taking logarithms, perhaps I can try to see if there are any obvious integer solutions. Sometimes, exponential equations have nice integer solutions, so it's worth checking.\n\nLet me test x = 0. Plugging in x = 0: 3^{0} + 19 = 10^{0}, which is 1 + 19 = 1. That simplifies to 20 = 1, which is not true. So x = 0 isn't a solution.\n\nHow about x = 1?"

Wait, that works. So x = 2 is a solution. Nice!\n\nLet me check x = 3 just to see: 3^6 +19 = 729 +19 = 748, and 10^3 = 1000. 748 \u2260 1000, so that's not a solution.\n\nWhat about x = 1.5? Let me see: 3^{3} +19 = 27 +19 = 46, and 10^{1.5} is sqrt(10^3) = sqrt(1000) \u2248 31.62. So 46 \u2248 31.62? No, not equal. Hmm.\n\nHow about x = 1. Let me check again. Wait, already did that. Maybe x = 0.5? Let's see: 3^{1} +19 = 3 +19 =22, and 10^{0.5} is sqrt(10) \u22483.16. Not close.\n\nHmm, so x=2 is a solution. But maybe there's another solution? Let me think. Since exponentials can sometimes cross more than once. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider the function f(x) = 3^{2x} +19 -10^x. We want to find x where f(x)=0.\n\nWe know f(2)=0. Let's check behavior as x approaches infinity and negative infinity.\n\nAs x \u2192 \u221e: 3^{2x} is (9)^x, and 10^x is also exponential. Which one grows faster? 10^x vs 9^x. Since 10>9, so 10^x grows faster. So as x\u2192infty, 10^x will dominate, so f(x"

Wait, no. Wait: 3^{2x} for x\u2192-infty is like (1/9)^|x|, and 10^x is (1/10)^|x|. Since 1/9 >1/10, so 1/9 grows faster. So 3^{2x} grows faster than 10^x as x\u2192-infty. Therefore, f(x) tends to +infty as x\u2192-infty.\n\nSo, the function f(x) tends to +infty as x\u2192-infty and tends to -infty as x\u2192infty. Also, f(2) =0.\n\nSo, could there be another crossing point besides x=2? It depends on whether the function is monotonic or not. Let's check the derivative.\n\nf(x) =3^{2x} +19 -10^x.\n\nf'(x)= ln(3)*2*3^{2x} - ln(10)*10^x.\n\nWe can analyze the sign of f'(x) to see if the function is increasing or decreasing.\n\nCompute f'(x) for some x:\n\nAt x=2: f'(2)=2*ln(3)*9 - ln(10)*100 \u22482*1.0986*9 - 2.3026*100\u224819.7748 -230.26\u2248-210.485.

So positive here.\n\nSo the derivative is positive at x=-1, negative at x=0, so the function has a maximum somewhere between x=-1 and x=0. So the function increases from -infty up to that maximum point, then decreases afterwards. Since f(x) approaches +infty as x\u2192-infty and has a maximum, then decreases to f(2)=0 and then to -infty, there must be another root somewhere between x approaching -infty and the maximum point?\n\nWait, but when x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and at the maximum point, the function is higher than at x=0. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's check f(-1): 3^{-2} +19 -10^{-1}= (1/9)+19 -0.1\u22480.111+19 -0.1\u224819.011. So f(-1)\u224819.011, which is positive.\n\nAt x=0, f(0)=1 +19 -1=19, which is also positive.\n\nWait, so the function is positive at x=-1, x=0, and then at x=2 it's zero. Since the derivative at x=0 is slightly negative, so the function is decreasing from x=0 onwards. So between x=0 and x=2, the function goes from 19 down to 0. So that's one root at x=2. But before x=0, the function is increasing up to the maximum point (since derivative was positive at x=-1 and negative at x=0, so the maximum is between x=-1 and 0). But since f(x) is always positive before x=2, except at x=2, then maybe there is only one real root at x=2?\n\nWait, but when x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so the function is always positive on the left side.
