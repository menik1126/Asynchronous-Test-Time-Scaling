Therefore, we can set up the equation (4x + 5)/(3x - 3) = 7/3.\n\nTo solve for x, cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions: 3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3).\n\nExpanding both sides gives 12x + 15 = 21x - 21.\n\nSubtract 12x from both sides: 15 = 9x - 21.\n\nAdd 21 to both sides: 36 = 9x.\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 9 to find x: x = 4.\n\nUsing this value, the number of blue marbles before adding was 4x = 16.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let’s Define Variables:**\n- Let \\( x \\) be the common multiplier for the ratio.\n- Therefore:\n  - Number of blue marbles initially = \\( 4x \\)\n  - Number of yellow marbles initially = \\( 3x \\)\n\n**Step 1: Apply the Changes**\n- Add 5 blue marbles: \\( 4x + 5 \\)\n- Remove 3 yellow marbles: \\( 3x - 3 \\)\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the New Ratio**\n- The new ratio is \\( 7:3 \\), so:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\\[\n3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n\\]\n\\[\n12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\\]\n\\[\n15 + 21 = 21x - 12x\n\\]\n\\[\n36 = 9x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Find the"
