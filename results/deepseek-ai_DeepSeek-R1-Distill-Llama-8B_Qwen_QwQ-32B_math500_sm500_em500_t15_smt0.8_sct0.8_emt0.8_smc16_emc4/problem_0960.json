The company assigns or unassigns new dogs in groups of x. The key is that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same under two different scenarios.\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali is assigned 4x more dogs, making her total 16 + 4x, while Nate stays at 12 dogs. In the second scenario, x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali, so Denali has 16 + x dogs and Nate has 12 - x dogs.\n\nSince the pay ratio remains the same in both scenarios, I can set up the equations:\n\n(16 + 4x) / 12 = 16 + x / (12 - x)\n\nSolving this equation will help me find the value of x.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Initial Dogs:**\n  - Denali: 16 dogs\n  - Nate: 12 dogs\n- **New Policy:**\n  - Dogs are assigned or unassigned in groups of **\\(x\\)** dogs.\n- **Conditions for Ratio Equality:**\n  1. **If Denali is assigned \\(4x\\) more dogs:**\n     - Denali\u2019s dogs: \\(16 + 4x\\)\n     - Nate\u2019s dogs: 12\n  2. **If \\(x\\) dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali:**\n     - Denali\u2019s dogs: \\(16 + x\\)\n     - Nate\u2019s dogs: \\(12 - x\\)\n  - The ratio of Denali\u2019s pay to Nate\u2019s pay remains the same in both scenarios.\n\n**Let\u2019s denote:**\n- The ratio of Denali\u2019s pay to Nate\u2019s pay as \\( R \\).\n\n**Setting up the Ratios:**\n\n1. **First Scenario:**\n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Second Scenario:**\n   \\[\n   R = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n   \\]\n\n**Equating the Two Ratios:**\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\( x \\):**\n\n1.
