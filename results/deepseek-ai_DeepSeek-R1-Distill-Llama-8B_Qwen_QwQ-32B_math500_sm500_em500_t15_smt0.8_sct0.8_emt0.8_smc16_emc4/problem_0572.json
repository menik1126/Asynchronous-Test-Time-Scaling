They need to sit around a circular table, but all members of each party must sit next to each other. Also, two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when arranging people around a circular table, the number of arrangements is usually (n-1)! because rotations are considered equivalent. But in this case, the parties have to sit together, so it's a bit different.\n\nLet me break it down. There are three groups: Democrats (D), Republicans (R), and Independent (I). Each group needs to be seated together as a block. So, essentially, we have three blocks: D, R, I.\n\nNow, since it's a circular table, the number of ways to arrange these blocks around the table is (3-1)! = 2! ways. That accounts for the rotations. So, that part is straightforward, we have 2 ways to arrange the blocks around the table.\n\nBut wait, each block itself can be arranged internally. For example, the Democrats can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways, the Republicans in 5! ways, and the Independent is just one person, so that's 1! which is 1.\n\nTherefore, for each arrangement of the blocks, we have to multiply by the number of internal arrangements of each group. So, the total number of arrangements would be 2! (for the blocks) multiplied by 5! (Democrats) multiplied by 5! (Republicans) multiplied by 1! (Independent).\n\nSo, putting it all together: 2! * 5! * 5! * 1! = 2 * 120 * 120 * 1 = 28,800.\n\nWait a second, but I should double-check if this makes sense. Let me see, if each party is a block, arranging the blocks around the table gives us 2 ways, and within each block, they can be arranged in 5! ways. So, yeah, 2 * 5! * 5! = 28,800.\n\nI think that's correct. So the final answer should be 28,800 ways.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a"
