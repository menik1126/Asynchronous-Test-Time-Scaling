I'll use the combination formula for this, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose the boys is C(7, 3). Calculating that gives me 35 possible combinations.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to select 2 girls out of the 4 available using the same combination formula: C(4, 2).\n\nCalculating C(4, 2) gives me 6 possible combinations.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls. That means 35 multiplied by 6 equals 210.\n\nSo, there are 210 different ways Mr. Brennan can select the group for the presentation.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n   \n   The formula for combinations is:\n   \\[\n   C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging in the numbers for the boys:\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times (7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times 4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n   \n   Using the same combination formula:\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the total number of ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls.**\n   \n   Since the choices are independent, multiply the number of ways for boys by the number of ways for"
