Let me try to understand how this function works.\n\nFirst, let me write down the definition again to make sure I have it right:\n\nFor every positive integer n, mod_5(n) is the remainder when n is divided by 5. The function f is defined on the set of non-negative integers i and j, where j is from 0 to 4. The function f: {0,1,2,...} \u00d7 {0,1,2,3,4} \u2192 {0,1,2,3,4} is defined recursively as:\n\n- If i = 0 and 0 \u2264 j \u2264 4, then f(0, j) = mod_5(j + 1).\n- If i \u2265 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1).\n- If i \u2265 1 and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 4, then f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)).\n\nI need to compute f(2015, 2). Hmm, okay. Since 2015 is a large number, I don't want to compute this directly. Maybe there's a pattern or a cycle that repeats every so often, which I can exploit to find the answer without computing all previous steps.\n\nLet me start by computing some small values of f(i, j) to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst, when i = 0:\n- f(0, 0) = mod_5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0, 1) = mod_5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0, 2) = mod_5(2 + 1) = 3\n- f(0, 3) = mod_5(3 + 1) = 4\n- f(0, 4) = mod_5(4 + 1) = 0 (since 5 mod 5 is 0)\n\nWait, does that mean f(0, 4) is 0?
