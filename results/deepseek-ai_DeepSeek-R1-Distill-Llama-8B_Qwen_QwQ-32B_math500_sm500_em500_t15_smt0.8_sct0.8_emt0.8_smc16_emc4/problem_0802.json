Let me read it again and understand what it's asking for.\n\nThe polynomial is given as:\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\nIt has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. They told me that \\(a_n = 2\\) and \\(a_0 = 66\\). I need to find the least possible value of \\(|a_{n-1}|\\).\n\nHmm, okay. So since the roots are integers and the coefficients are integers, by the Integer Root Theorem, the possible roots should divide the constant term \\(a_0\\), which is 66. That's a good starting point.\n\nFirst, let me factorize 66 to find its divisors. 66 factors into prime factors as \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 11\\). So the divisors of 66 are all the products of these primes, right? That would be \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66\\).\n\nSo the possible integer roots are limited to these numbers. Now, the polynomial has distinct integer roots, so each root is unique and different from the others.\n\nSince the leading coefficient \\(a_n = 2\\), which is positive, the polynomial will tend to positive infinity as \\(x\\) approaches positive infinity and positive infinity as \\(x\\) approaches negative infinity if the degree is even, or it will tend to negative infinity if the degree is odd. Hmm, but I don't know the degree yet. Maybe I can figure it out based on the number of roots.\n\nWait, the polynomial is monic? No, it's not monic because \\(a_n = 2\\). So the polynomial is quadratic or higher, but the exact degree isn't specified. So I need to consider how many roots there are. Each root corresponds to a factor of the polynomial. So, for example, if it's a quadratic, it will have two roots; if it's cubic, three roots, and so on.\n\nBut I don't know the degree. Hmm, so perhaps I can try different degrees and see which one gives me the minimal \\(|a_{n-1}|\\). Alternatively,"

The problem doesn't specify the degree, so I can choose the degree to be whatever is needed to minimize \\(|a_{n-1}|\\). So likely, the minimal \\(|a_{n-1}|\\) is achieved with as few terms as possible? Hmm. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, the coefficients of a polynomial can be related to the roots via Vieta's formulas. Let me recall Vieta's formulas.\n\nIf the polynomial has roots \\(r_1, r_2, ..., r_n\\), then the polynomial can be written as:\n$$2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n)$$\nSince the leading coefficient is 2, so when expanded, the leading term is \\(2x^n\\), and the constant term is \\(2(-r_1)(-r_2)...(-r_n)\\), which is \\(2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n\\). Given that \\(a_0 = 66\\), so we have:\n$$2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n = 66$$\n\nTherefore, \\(r_1 r_2 ... r_n = \\frac{66}{2(-1)^n}\\). Since the roots are integers, their product must be an integer. Therefore, \\( \\frac{66}{2(-1)^n} \\) must be an integer. Let me see, since \\(2\\) divides 66, so yes, it will be an integer. The sign is determined by \\((-1)^n\\), so depending on whether n is even or odd.\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots \\( r_1 r_2 ... r_n = \\frac{66}{2(-1)^n} = \\frac{33}{(-1)^n} \\). Therefore, if n is even, the product is 33 or -33 depending on the sign. Wait, actually, since dividing by \\( (-1)^n \\), the numerator is 66/(2) which is 33, so if n is even, \\( (-1)^n = 1 \\), so the product is 33. If"

Wait, no, let me correct that step.\n\nWait, original equation is \\(2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n = 66\\). Therefore, \\( (-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n = 33 \\). So the product of the roots \\( r_1 r_2 ... r_n = (-1)^n \\times 33 \\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So depending on the degree n, the product is either 33 or -33. Specifically, if n is even, since \\( (-1)^n = 1 \\), the product is 33. If n is odd, \\( (-1)^n = -1 \\), so the product is -33.\n\nNow, the roots are distinct integers, so they must be distinct divisors of 66, as we found before. So, let's list all possible sets of distinct integer divisors of 66.\n\nBut given that the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, let's look at the divisors of 33. 33's divisors are 1, 3, 11, 33 and their negatives.\n\nWait, but roots can be positive or negative divisors, right? So 33 is 3*11, so it's factors are 1, 3, 11, 33, and their negatives.\n\nWait, but 66 is 2*3*11, so the divisors include 2 and 6 as well. But 33 is 3*11, so it's factors are 1, 3, 11, 33.\n\nWait, but the product is either 33 or -33, so possible roots multiply to 33 or -33.\n\nBut the roots are also among the divisors of 66, which includes 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, 66 and their negatives.\n\nBut, hold on, if the product of the roots is 33, and the roots are distinct integers, then we need to find sets of distinct integers whose product is 33.

Let's start with the product 33.\n\nPossible factors for 33 (positive product):\n\nPossible factors (distinct integers) could be:\n\n- (1, 3, 11): product 1*3*11 = 33, which is 3 numbers.\n\n- (1, 33): two numbers.\n\n- Or even (3, 11) but that product is 33? 3*11=33, so two roots.\n\nAlternatively, ( -1, -3, -11): product (-1)*(-3)*(-11)= -33, so if we have an odd number of negative terms, product becomes negative. Hmm, maybe let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the roots could include negative numbers. So to get a product of 33 (positive), there must be an even number of negative terms, or all positive.\n\nBut since the roots have to multiply to 33, which is positive, the roots must have even number of negative roots or all positive.

So maybe to get the minimal |a_{n-1}|, I need to have as many small coefficients as possible? Hmm, Vieta's formula relates the coefficients to the roots.\n\nSpecifically, the coefficient \\(a_{n-1}\\), which is the coefficient of x^{n-1}, is equal to \\( -2 \\times \\) (sum of roots) times something?\n\nWait, let's recall Vieta's formula for a general polynomial. Let me denote the polynomial as:\n\n\\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\)\n\nTherefore, if we expand this, the coefficient \\(a_{n-1}\\) is the negative of the sum of the roots multiplied by 2.

Wait, so that's a problem. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, if the polynomial is 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn), then the constant term is 2*(-r1)(-r2)...(-rn) = 2*(-1)^n (r1 r2 ... rn). So if the product of roots is 33, then the constant term is 2*(-1)^n * 33. Since the constant term is given as 66, so 2*(-1)^n *33 =66.

To have the total sum zero, p + q = r + s. But as above, the product is 33, so the product of p*q*r*s=33. Since 33 is 3*11, the only way to have four numbers multiply to 33 is to have two 1s and 3 and 11. So the sum p + q = r + s would require 1 + 3 = 1 + 11? 4 vs 12? No. Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using fractions? But roots must be integers. So no.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have four roots with product 33 and sum zero.

So, can't have five roots without duplicating or making the product too big.\n\nTherefore, I think 14 is indeed the minimal.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again.\n\nIn Case 2, the minimal |sum| is 7, achieved by {1, 3, -11}. Therefore, |a_{n-1}|=2*7=14.\n\nIn Case 1, the minimal |sum| is 8, leading to |a_{n-1}|=16.\n\nTherefore, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 14.\n\nHence, the least possible value of |a_{n-1}| is 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe least possible value of \\(|a_{n-1}|\\) is \\boxed{14}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the polynomial\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\nwith integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, where \\(a_n = 2\\) and \\(a_0 = 66\\), we need to find the least possible value of \\(|a_{n-1}|\\).\n\nFirst, we note that the roots of the polynomial are divisors of the constant term 66. The divisors of 66 are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6, \\pm 11, \\pm 22, \\pm 33, \\pm 66\\).\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, we know that the product of the roots is given by:\n$$2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 66 \\implies (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = "
