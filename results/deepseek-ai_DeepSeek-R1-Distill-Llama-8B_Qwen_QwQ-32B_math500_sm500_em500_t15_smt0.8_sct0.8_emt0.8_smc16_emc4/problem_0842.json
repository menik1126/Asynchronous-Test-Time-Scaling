Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the problem is asking. I need to maximize the fraction where the numerator is \\(x - y\\) and the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\). Since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can be any real numbers, I guess I should consider how this fraction behaves. Maybe I can write this as a function \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\) and then try to find its maximum.\n\nTo find the maximum, I remember that I can use calculus, specifically partial derivatives, to find critical points. So, I need to take the partial derivatives of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), set them both equal to zero, and solve the resulting system of equations. That should give me the critical points which could be maxima, minima, or saddle points.\n\nLet me write down the function again:\n\n\\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\)\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\). Using the quotient rule: \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) is \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{(-1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4y^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\\).\n\nNow, to find critical points, I need both partial derivatives to be zero. So, set the numerator of each derivative equal to zero:\n\nFor \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0\\):\n\n\\( (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3) ="

But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider symmetry or substitution variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem as optimizing f(x,y) with variables x and y. Since the denominator is always positive (since x^4 and y^4 are non-negative, so denominator is at least 6), the sign of the function depends on the numerator x - y. To maximize the function, we need to have x - y as large as possible while keeping the denominator as small as possible. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when x is as large as possible and y as small as possible, but the denominator would then be large. Hmm, so there's a trade-off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum occurs at some point where x and y are related in a specific way. Let me think of using Lagrange multipliers.

Wait, let's compute it correctly.\n\nWait, f_max(k)=g(k)/2^{11/4}.\n\nAt k=1, g(1)=1, so f_max=1/2^{11/4}=1/(2^{2 + 3/4})=1/(4 * 2^{3/4})= (1/4)*2^{-3/4}= (1/4)*(1/(2^{3/4}))≈(1/4)*(0.5946)=≈0.148.\n\nBut earlier, when we plugged k=1, we had f=1/4=0.25, which is higher. This suggests a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, f_max(k)= (2^{1/4} (1 +k)) / (8 (1 +k^4)^{1/4} )= (2^{1/4}/8)(1 +k)/(1 +k^4)^{1/4}.\n\nBut 2^{1/4}/8=2^{1/4}/2^3=2^{-11/4}.\n\nAt k=1, f_max=2^{-11/4}*(1 +1)/(1 +1)^{1/4}=2^{-11/4}*2/2^{1/4}=2^{-11/4 +1 -1/4}=2^{-11/4 + 3/4}=2^{-2}=1/4.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, at k=1, f_max=1/4.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value is indeed 1/4, achieved at k=1, i.e., y=-x.\n\nThus, the maximum value of the function is 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum value is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the maximum value of the expression \\(\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\) over all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y"
