The modulus of a complex number a + bi is given by \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, for (1 - i), the modulus is \u221a(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = \u221a2.\n\nNext, I'll use the property that the modulus of a power of a complex number is the modulus raised to that power. Therefore, |(1 - i)\u2078| = (\u221a2)\u2078.\n\nCalculating (\u221a2)\u2078 involves raising \u221a2 to the eighth power. I can rewrite \u221a2 as 2^(1/2). Raising this to the eighth power gives 2^((1/2)*8) = 2^4 = 16.\n\nSo, the absolute value of (1 - i)\u2078 is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Modulus of a Complex Number**:\n   - For a complex number \\( a + bi \\), the modulus is defined as \\( |a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n   - In this case, our complex number is \\( 1 - i \\), where \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Modulus of \\( 1 - i \\)**:\n   - \\( |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n3. **Apply the Property of Modulus to a Power**:\n   - The modulus of a power of a complex number is the modulus raised to that power:\n     \\[\n     |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Simplify \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 \\)**:\n   - \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{(1/2) \\times 8} = 2^4 = 16 \\).\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - Therefore, the absolute value of \\( (1 - i)^"
