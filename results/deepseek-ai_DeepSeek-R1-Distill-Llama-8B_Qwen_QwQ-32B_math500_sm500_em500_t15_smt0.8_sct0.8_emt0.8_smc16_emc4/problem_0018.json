            "output": "First, I recognize that the absolute value of a complex number is its distance from the origin in the complex plane, which is calculated by squaring the sum of the real and imaginary parts and taking the square root.\n\nFor the complex number \\(1 - i\\), the real part is 1 and the imaginary part is -1.\n\nI'll calculate the magnitude using the formula:\n\\[\n|1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSince raising a complex number to a power involves raising both its magnitude and angle to that power, I'll raise \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to the eighth power:\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of \\((1 - i)^8\\) is 16.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step to find \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Magnitude of a Complex Number\nThe **magnitude** (or absolute value) of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is given by:\n\\[\n|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\nThis represents the distance of the point \\((a, b)\\) from the origin in the complex plane.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Magnitude of \\(1 - i\\)\nFor the complex number \\(1 - i\\), where \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = -1\\):\n\\[\n|1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Raise the Magnitude to the 8th Power\nWhen raising a complex number to a power, the magnitude is raised to the same power:\n\\[\n|(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n\\]\nSimplify \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\):\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
