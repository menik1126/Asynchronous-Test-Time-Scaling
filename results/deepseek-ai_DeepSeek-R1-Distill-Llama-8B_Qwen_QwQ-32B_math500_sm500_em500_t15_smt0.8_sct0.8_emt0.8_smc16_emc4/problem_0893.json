To do this, I should check if the denominator has any prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\nStarting with the denominator 160, I'll factor it by dividing by 2 repeatedly:\n160 ÷ 2 = 80\n80 ÷ 2 = 40\n40 ÷ 2 = 20\n20 ÷ 2 = 10\n10 ÷ 2 = 5\n5 ÷ 2 = 2.5 (This is not a whole number, so 2 is no longer a factor.)\n\nNow, the remaining factor is 5, which is one of the allowed prime factors for a terminating decimal.\n\nSince the fraction can be expressed with a denominator that is a product of only 2s and 5s, it will convert to a terminating decimal.\n\nTherefore, 57/160 can be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** Convert \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conditions for a Terminating Decimal:**\n   - A fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will have a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\(b\\) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5 after simplifying the fraction.\n\n2. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   - Start by factoring the denominator \\(160\\):\n     \\[\n     160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^4 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^5 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - So, \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5\\).\n\n3. **Check the Prime Factors:**\n   - The prime factors of \\(160\\) are only \\(2\\) and \\(5\\).\n   - Since the denominator has no other prime factors, the fraction can be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n\n4. **Perform the Division:**\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = 0.355\n     \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.355}\n\\]"
