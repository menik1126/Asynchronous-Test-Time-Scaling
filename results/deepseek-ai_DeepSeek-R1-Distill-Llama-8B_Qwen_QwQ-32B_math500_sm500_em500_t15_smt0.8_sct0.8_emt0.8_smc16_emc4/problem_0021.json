            "output": "First, I recognize that the expression involves a complex number, specifically (1 - i) raised to the eighth power. To find the absolute value of this complex number, I can use the property that the absolute value of a complex number a + bi is equal to the square root of (a squared plus b squared).\n\nNext, I'll calculate the absolute value of (1 - i) by taking the square root of (1 squared plus (-1) squared). This gives me \u221a(1 + 1) = \u221a2.\n\nSince the absolute value of a complex number is multiplicative, raising (1 - i) to the eighth power is the same as raising its absolute value to the eighth power. Therefore, I'll raise \u221a2 to the eighth power.\n\nFinally, I'll compute (\u221a2)^8. Recognizing that (2^(1/2))^8 is equal to 2^(8/2), which simplifies to 2^4, and 2^4 equals 16. So, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Absolute Value of \\( 1 - i \\):**\n   \n   The absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   |a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n   \n   Applying this to \\( 1 - i \\):\n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Raise the Absolute Value to the Eighth Power:**\n   \n   Since the absolute value of a complex number is multiplicative, we can raise it to the power outside the absolute value:\n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 \\):**\n   \n   Remember that \\( (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2})^8 = ((\\sqrt{2})^2)^4 = 2^4 = 16\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer"
