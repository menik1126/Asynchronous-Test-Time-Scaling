The problem says that for every positive integer k, two specific subsequences have special properties: one is a geometric sequence and the other is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nLet me break it down. For every k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} forms a geometric sequence. That means each term after the first is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, in a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. Let me denote the common ratio as r. Then, we have:\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r\n\nand\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r = a_{2k-1} * r\u00b2.\n\nOkay, that's the geometric part. Now, the other subsequence is arithmetic. It says that a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic sequence. In an arithmetic sequence, each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference. Let me denote this common difference as d. So, we have:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d\n\nand\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d = a_{2k} + 2d.\n\nBut wait, from the geometric sequence part, we already have a_{2k+1} in terms of a_{2k-1}. Specifically, a_{2k+1} = a_{2k-1} * r\u00b2.\n\nSo, from the arithmetic sequence, a_{2k+1} is also a_{2k} + d. Therefore, we can equate these two expressions:\n\na_{2k-1} * r\u00b2 = a_{2k} + d.\n\nBut we also know from the geometric sequence that a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r. So, substituting that into the equation:\n\na_{2k-1} * r\u00b2 = (a_{2k-1} * r) + d.\n\nWe can simplify this:\n\na_{2k-1} * r\u00b2 - a_{2k"

So, d is dependent on a_{2k-1} and r. But since the sequence is strictly increasing, both r and d must be such that all terms are positive integers and increasing.\n\nAlso, since it's a geometric sequence, r must be a positive rational number, but since we're dealing with integers, r is probably an integer greater than 1. Otherwise, if r is a fraction, we might get non-integer terms, but the problem says the sequence is of positive integers.\n\nSo, let's assume r is an integer. That makes sense because each term is an integer multiplied by r to get the next term.\n\nSo, if r is an integer greater than 1, and d is also an integer, we can think about how these relate term by term.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence structure. It's built in such a way that every two terms form a geometric pair, and then the next term after that is related by an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo, to get a handle on this, maybe I can consider the first few terms and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet me denote the first term as a\u2081. Then, since the subsequence a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083 is geometric, we have a\u2082 = a\u2081 * r and a\u2083 = a\u2082 * r = a\u2081 * r\u00b2.\n\nThen, the next part is the arithmetic sequence a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084. So, a\u2084 is a\u2083 + d = a\u2081 * r\u00b2 + d.\n\nBut from the geometric sequence, a\u2084 is part of the next geometric triplet: a\u2083, a\u2084, a\u2085. Since a\u2084 = a\u2083 + d, and a\u2085 must be a geometric sequence from a\u2083, so a\u2085 = a\u2084 * r = (a\u2081 * r\u00b2 + d) * r.\n\nBut also, in the arithmetic sequence a\u2084, a\u2085, a\u2086, we have:\n\na\u2085 = a\u2084 + d'.\n\nWait, but hold on. Earlier, we considered the arithmetic sequence as a_{2k},"

So, each geometric triplet can have its own ratio, and each arithmetic triplet can have its own difference. That complicates things because the ratios and differences can vary.\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial assumption that r is a constant is incorrect. Maybe each geometric triplet has its own ratio. That complicates the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern that allows the ratios and differences to be consistent?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios and differences are related in a way that allows the sequence to be built in a consistent manner.\n\nHmm, this might be tricky.

Hmm, but (2r\u2081 -1)/r\u2081 can be simplified as 2 - 1/r\u2081.\n\nFor this to be a rational number, 1/r\u2081 must be rational, which it is since r\u2081 is an integer, but 2 - 1/r\u2081 must be such that r\u2082 would then be a factor to keep a\u2085 as integer.\n\nBut for a\u2085 = a\u2084 * r\u2082 to be integer, and since a\u2084 is already an integer, r\u2082 must be a positive rational number such that it doesn't introduce a denominator that isn't canceled.\n\nSo, r\u2082 = (2r\u2081 -1)/r\u2081 = 2 - 1/r\u2081.
