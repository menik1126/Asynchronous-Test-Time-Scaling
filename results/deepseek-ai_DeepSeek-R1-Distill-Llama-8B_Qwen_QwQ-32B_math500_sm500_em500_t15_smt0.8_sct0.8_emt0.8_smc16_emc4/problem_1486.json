            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: √(∛(√(1/729))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me take it step by step. I remember that when dealing with roots, especially nested ones, it's helpful to express them as exponents because that makes it easier to manipulate and simplify them. So, let me rewrite each root as a fractional exponent.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: √(1/729). Since a square root is the same as raising to the power of 1/2, that part would be (1/729)^(1/2). Then, this is inside a cube root, which is the same as raising to the power of 1/3. So, the entire cube root part would be [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3). \n\nWait, when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, that would be (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3), which is (1/729)^(1/6). \n\nNow, the next layer out is another square root, so that would be [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2). Again, multiplying exponents, that's (1/729)^(1/6 * 1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12). Hmm, okay. Now, I need to see what 729 is as a power of a number because that might help simplify the expression. Let me think, I remember that 9^3 is 729 because 9*9 is 81, and 81*9 is 729. So, 9^3 = 729. But 9 itself is 3^2, so substituting that in, 9^3 = (3^2)^3 = 3^(2*3) = 3^6. \n\nTherefore, 729 = 3^6. So, (1/729) is equal to 1/(3^6). So, now, the expression is [1/(3^6)]^(1/12). \n\nWhen you raise a fraction to an exponent, you can apply the exponent to both the numerator and the denominator. So, [1"

            "output": "^(1/12)] / [3^(6*(1/12))] = 1 / 3^(6/12). Simplifying the exponent in the denominator, 6/12 reduces to 1/2. So, that becomes 1 / 3^(1/2). \n\nNow, 3^(1/2) is the square root of 3, so the expression simplifies to 1/√3. But the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator. Right, we can't have a radical in the denominator, so we need to rationalize it. \n\nTo rationalize 1/√3, we multiply numerator and denominator by √3. That gives (1*√3)/(√3*√3) = √3 / 3. \n\nLet me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the inside:\n\n√(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2). Then cube root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6). Then the square root of that is [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12). \n\nSince 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is 3^(-6). Therefore, (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/3^(1/2) = 1/√3. Then rationalizing gives √3/3. \n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me confirm the exponents again. The exponents are multiplied each time. The first square root is 1/2, then cube root is 1/3, so 1/2 * 1/3 = 1/6. Then another square root, so 1/6 * 1/2 = 1/12. So, the exponent on 1/729 is 1/12. \n\nYes, and since 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is 3^(-6)."

So, the final answer should be √3 divided by 3.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is simplified by expressing each root as an exponent and simplifying step-by-step. \n\n1. Start with the innermost root: √(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2).\n2. Apply the cube root: [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n3. Apply the outer square root: [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n4.
