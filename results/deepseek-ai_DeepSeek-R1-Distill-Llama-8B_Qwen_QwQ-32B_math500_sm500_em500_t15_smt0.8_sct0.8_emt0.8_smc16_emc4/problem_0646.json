So, the question is about a quadratic polynomial P(x) that satisfies two inequalities for all real numbers x: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3. Additionally, we know that P(11) = 181. We need to find P(16). \n\nFirst, let me understand what's given. P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, so it must have the form P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers. The inequalities provided give us two quadratic functions that bound P(x) from below and above, respectively. So, for every x, the value of P(x) is sandwiched between these two quadratics.\n\nLet me write down those two functions:\n\nLower bound: Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2\n\nUpper bound: R(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3\n\nSince P(x) is between Q(x) and R(x) for all real x, it must be that P(x) - Q(x) \u2265 0 and R(x) - P(x) \u2265 0 for all x. \n\nSo, let me define two new functions:\n\n1. S(x) = P(x) - Q(x) \u2265 0\n2. T(x) = R(x) - P(x) \u2265 0\n\nSince both S(x) and T(x) are non-negative for all x, this suggests that P(x) is squeezed between Q(x) and R(x). So, P(x) must coincide with either Q(x) or R(x) at some points, but since Q(x) and R(x) are different, P(x) has to be a quadratic that lies entirely between them.\n\nGiven that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, let's express it as P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. \n\nNow, let's subtract Q(x) from P(x):\n\nS(x) = P(x) - Q(x) = (a - 1)x\u00b2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\n\nSimilarly, subtracting P(x) from R(x):\n\nT(x) = R(x) - P(x) = (2 - a)x\u00b2 + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c)\n\nSince both S(x) and T(x"

So, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 2.\n\nNext, the quadratic S(x) must be non-negative for all x. Since it's a quadratic opening upwards (because a - 1 \u2265 0), it has a minimum at its vertex. Therefore, the discriminant of S(x) must be less than or equal to zero. Similarly for T(x), since it's a quadratic opening downwards (because 2 - a \u2265 0), it has a maximum at its vertex, so its discriminant must also be less than or equal to zero.\n\nSo, let's compute the discriminant for S(x):\n\nDiscriminant of S(x): [ (b + 2) ]\u00b2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) \u2264 0\n\nSimilarly, discriminant of T(x): [ (-4 - b) ]\u00b2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) \u2264 0\n\nThese two inequalities must hold.\n\nSo, writing them down:\n\n1. (b + 2)\u00b2 - 4(a - 1)(c - 2) \u2264 0\n2. ( -4 - b )\u00b2 - 4(2 - a)(3 - c) \u2264 0\n\nSimplify these:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n(b\u00b2 + 4b + 4) - 4(a - 1)(c - 2) \u2264 0\n\nSecond equation:\n\n(16 + 8b + b\u00b2) - 4(2 - a)(3 - c) \u2264 0\n\nNote: (-4 - b)\u00b2 = (b + 4)\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + 8b + 16.\n\nSo now, we have two inequalities:\n\n1. b\u00b2 + 4b + 4 - 4(a - 1)(c - 2"

Since P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, plugging in x = 11:\n\n181 = a*(11)\u00b2 + b*11 + c \u21d2 121a + 11b + c = 181\n\nSo, that's our third equation: 121a + 11b + c = 181.\n\nSo, the problem now reduces to solving these inequalities along with the equation 121a + 11b + c = 181, for a, b, c, with 1 \u2264 a \u2264 2.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can express c from the equation 121a + 11b + c = 181, so c = 181 - 121a - 11b.\n\nLet's substitute c into the inequalities to eliminate c:\n\nFirst inequality:\n\nb\u00b2 + 4b + 4 - 4(a - 1)( (181 - 121a - 11b) - 2 ) \u2264 0\n\nSimplify inside the parenthesis:\n\n(181 - 121a - 11b) - 2 = 179 - 121a - 11b\n\nSo, 4(a - 1)(179 - 121a - 11b) = 4(a - 1)(179 - 121a -11b )\n\nSimilarly, second inequality:\n\nb\u00b2 + 8b + 16 - 4(2 - a)(3 - (181 - 121a -11b)) \u2264 0\n\nSimplify inside the second parenthesis:\n\n3 - (181 - 121a -11b) = 3 - 181 + 121a + 11b = -178 + 121a + 11b\n\nSo, the second inequality becomes:\n\nb\u00b2 + 8b + 16 - 4(2 - a)(-178 + 121a + 11b) \u2264 0\n\nHmm, this seems getting a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Since P(x) lies between Q(x) and R(x), perhaps P(x) is equal to Q(x) plus some multiple of (R(x) - Q(x)), scaled appropriately.\n\nWait, let me consider that P(x"

But wait, since P(x) is quadratic, and Q(x) is quadratic, their difference is a quadratic, so R(x) - Q(x) is (x - 1)^2, which is positive for all x except x = 1, where it's zero.\n\nBut that suggests that P(x) = Q(x) + k(x - 1)^2, where k is a constant between 0 and 1, because R(x) = Q(x) + (x -1)^2. So, if k is between 0 and 1, then P(x) would be between Q(x) and R(x).\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nSuppose P(x) = Q(x) + k(x - 1)^2, where 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1.\n\nThen P(x) would satisfy Q(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 R(x) because when k=0, P=Q, and when k=1, P=R.\n\nSo, let's model P(x) as such.\n\nSo, P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 + k(x - 1)^2.\n\nExpanding (x -1)^2: x\u00b2 - 2x +1.\n\nSo, P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 + k(x\u00b2 - 2x +1) = (1 + k)x\u00b2 + (-2 - 2k)x + (2 + k).\n\nSo, comparing to P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, we have:\n\na = 1 +"
