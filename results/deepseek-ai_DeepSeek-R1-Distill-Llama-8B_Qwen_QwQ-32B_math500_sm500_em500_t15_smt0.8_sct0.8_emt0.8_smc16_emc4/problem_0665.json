            "output": "First, I'll define the weights of each item based on the given information.\n\nLet\u2019s assign variables:\n- Let T represent the weight of one treek.\n- Let S represent the weight of one squig.\n- Let G represent the weight of one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives the equation:\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nFrom the second statement, two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This gives the equation:\n2T + G = S.\n\nNext, I'll substitute the value of S from the second equation into the first equation. Since S = 2T + G, I can replace S with (2T + G) in the first equation:\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding the equation:\n10T = 6T + 3G + G,\n10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides:\n4T = 4G.\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\nT = G.\n\nThis means that one treek weighs the same as one goolee.\n\nNow, I'll substitute T = G back into the second equation to find the relationship between T and S:\n2T + T = S,\n3T = S.\n\nTherefore, one squig weighs three times as much as one treek.\n\nTo find how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, I'll divide both sides of the equation by T:\nS = 3T.\n\nThis shows that three treeks equal the weight of one squig.\n\nSo, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n\n**Let\u2019s define:**\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Step 1:** Translate the first statement into an equation.\n\\[ 10T = 3S + G \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Translate the second statement into another equation.\n\\[ "
