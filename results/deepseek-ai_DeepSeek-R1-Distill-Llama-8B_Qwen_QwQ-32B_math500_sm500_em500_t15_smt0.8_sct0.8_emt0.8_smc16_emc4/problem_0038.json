A proper divisor is a number less than 284 that divides 284 without leaving a remainder.\n\nI'll begin by finding the prime factors of 284. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. Dividing 142 by 2 again results in 71. Finally, 71 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of all the proper divisors. The proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, and 71. Adding these together gives a sum of 78.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of these proper divisors, which is 78.\n\nFinally, I'll sum the proper divisors of 78 to find the final result. The proper divisors of 78 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, and 26. Adding these together results in a total sum of 51.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**  \nFind the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Find the Proper Divisors of 284**  \nA proper divisor of a number \\( N \\) is a positive divisor of \\( N \\) that is less than \\( N \\).\n\n- First, let's find all proper divisors of 284.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 284:**  \n   \\( 284 \\) is an even number, so it's divisible by \\( 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   284 \\div 2 = 142\n   \\]\n   \\( 142 \\) is also even:\n   \\[\n   142 \\div 2 = 71\n   \\]\n   \\( 71 \\) is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factorization of \\( 284 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   284 = 2^2 \\times 71^1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors:**  \n   The proper divisors of \\( 284 \\) are \\( 1, 2, 4, \\) and \\( 71 \\).
