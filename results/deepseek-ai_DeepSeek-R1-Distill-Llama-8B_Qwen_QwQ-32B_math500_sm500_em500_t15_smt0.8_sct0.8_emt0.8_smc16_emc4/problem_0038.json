Since 284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2.\n\nSo, 284 ÷ 2 = 142.\n\nNext, I factorize 142. It's also even, so it's divisible by 2.\n\n142 ÷ 2 = 71.\n\nNow, 71 is a prime number, meaning its only factors are 1 and itself.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2² × 71¹.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (2² + 1) × (71¹ + 1), I can find the sum of all divisors of 284.\n\nCalculating this gives (4 + 1) × (71 + 1) = 5 × 72 = 360.\n\nSince the sum of all divisors includes the number itself, I'll subtract 284 to get the sum of the proper divisors.\n\n360 - 284 = 76.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 76.\n\nFirst, I'll find the proper divisors of 76. Starting with smaller numbers, I'll check which numbers divide evenly into 76.\n\n1, 2, 4 are proper divisors since 76 ÷ 1 = 76, 76 ÷ 2 = 38, and 76 ÷ 4 = 19.\n\nChecking higher numbers, I find that 19 is a divisor because 76 ÷ 19 = 4. Therefore, the proper divisors of 76 are 1, 2, 4, and 19.\n\nFinally, to find the sum of these proper divisors, I'll add them together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 19 = 26.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nFind the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\n**Step 1: Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n\nFirst, determine all positive divisors of 284.\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n  - 284 is even, so divide by 2: \\( 284 ÷ 2 = 142"
