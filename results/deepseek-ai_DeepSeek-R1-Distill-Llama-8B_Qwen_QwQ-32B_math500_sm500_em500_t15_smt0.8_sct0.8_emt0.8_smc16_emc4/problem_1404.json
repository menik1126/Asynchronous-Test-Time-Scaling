Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to sums and products. Since \u03c9 is a primitive 1997th root of unity, \u03c9^1997 = 1, and all the powers of \u03c9 from 1 to 1996 are distinct roots. Also, I know that the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero. So, for n=1997, 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9^2 + ... + \u03c9^1996 = 0. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, the sum I have is S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^2) + ... + 1/(1 + \u03c9^1997). Wait, but \u03c9^1997 is 1, so the last term is 1/(1 + 1) which is 1/2. So, S = sum from k=1 to 1997 of 1/(1 + \u03c9^k).\n\nBut the sum goes up to 1997, which would include \u03c9^0 = 1. So, actually, it's the sum from k=0 to 1996 of 1/(1 + \u03c9^k). But since \u03c9^0 = 1, the last term would be 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2. However, the problem states the sum goes up to \u03c9^1997, which is the same as \u03c9^0. Maybe I should adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, no, the sum is from k=1 to 1997, so the terms would be from \u03c9^1 to \u03c9^1997, which is equivalent to \u03c9^1 to \u03c9^0 (since 1997 mod 1997 is 0). So, perhaps it's better to think of the sum as from k=0 to 1996, which might avoid confusion.\n\nLet me confirm: If k goes from 1 to 1997, and \u03c9^1997 = 1, then yes, the terms go from \u03c9^1 up to \u03c9^0, but since we're starting from"

But the roots from k=1 to k=1996 are all the non-trivial roots except for \u03c9^0.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a symmetry or a pairing of terms here. Since roots of unity come in conjugate pairs, perhaps? Let's think. Since \u03c9^k and \u03c9^{1997 - k} are conjugates? Because \u03c9^{1997 - k} = \u03c9^{-k} since \u03c9^{1997} =1. So \u03c9^{-k} is the conjugate of \u03c9^k because modulus is 1. So maybe pairing terms like 1/(1 + \u03c9^k) and 1/(1 + \u03c9^{-k}).\n\nLet me try that. Let me see if I can pair terms such that their denominators are conjugates, which might lead to simplification.\n\nSo for each term 1/(1 + \u03c9^k), its conjugate would be 1/(1 + \u03c9^{-k}) (since \u03c9^{-k} = \u03c9^{1997 -k}).\n\nTherefore, the sum S can be written as the sum over k=1 to 1996, pairing each term with its conjugate, plus the term at k=1997 (which is 1/2). But since 1996 is even? Wait, 1997 is odd, so the number of non-conjugated terms would be odd? Hmm.\n\nWait, 1997 is an odd number, so the total number of terms from k=1 to 1996 is 1996 terms, which can be paired into 998 pairs. Each pair would be (1/(1 + \u03c9^k) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{-k})) for k from 1 to 998, perhaps.\n\nWait, but actually, \u03c9^{-k} is the same as \u03c9^{1997 - k"

So for each pair of terms 1/(1 + \u03c9^k) and 1/(1 + \u03c9^{-k}), the sum is 1.\n\nSince there are 998 such pairs (since 1996 terms divided by 2 is 998), each contributing 1, the total sum from the pairs is 998.\n\nAdditionally, there's the middle term when k=1997, which is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2.\n\nSo total sum S would be 998 + 1/2 = 998.5.\n\nBut 998.5 is 1997/2.

But wait, no, original sum was from k=1 to 1997, which includes terms from k=1 to k=1997, but since \u03c9^1997=1, so it's equivalent to summing from k=1 to k=1996 (which is 1996 terms, 998 pairs each summing to 1) plus the last term at k=1997, which is 1/2. So that gives 998 + 1/2 = 1997/2.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the sum from k=0 to 1996, which is sum_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + \u03c9^k), then each pair for k and 1997 -k (since \u03c9^{1997 -k} = \u03c9^{-k}) would contribute 1, as shown earlier. So number of such pairs is (1997 -1)/2 = 998, so sum would be 998"

But the problem's sum is from k=1 to 1997, which is the same as the sum from k=0 to 1996, because \u03c9^1997 = \u03c9^0. Wait, actually, the problem's sum is from k=1 to 1997, so that includes k=1997 which is \u03c9^0, so the total sum is exactly the same as the sum from k=0 to 1996. Therefore, the total sum is 1997/2. But let me confirm again.\n\nWait, let me think again step by step.\n\nSuppose S = sum_{k=1}^{1997} 1/(1 + \u03c9^k). Since \u03c9^1997 = 1, so the term when k=1997 is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2. The other terms are from k=1 to 1996. So S = [sum_{k=1}^{1996} 1/(1 + \u03c9^k)] + 1/2.\n\nNow, the sum from k=1 to 1996 can be paired as (1/(1 + \u03c9^1) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{1996})) + (1/(1 + \u03c9^2) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{1995})) + ... + (1/(1 + \u03c9^{998}) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{1997 - 998})).\n\nEach pair is of the form 1/(1 + \u03c9^k) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{-k}), which we showed equals 1. Since there are 998 pairs (since 1996 terms divided by 2 is 998), so the sum from k=1 to 1996 is 998. Then adding the 1/2 gives S = 998 + 1/2"

So the answer is 1997/2.\n\nWait, but let me also check if I can find another way to confirm this result.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula for geometric series or other summation techniques involving roots of unity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity that for a root of unity \u03c9 \u2260 1, 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9^2 + ... + \u03c9^{n-1} = 0 when \u03c9^n = 1.\n\nBut maybe there's a better approach. Let me think about using complex analysis. Let me consider the polynomial f(x) = x^{1997} - 1 = 0, which has roots \u03c9^0, \u03c9^1, ..., \u03c9^{1996}.\n\nWe can write f(x) = (x - 1)(x^{1996} + x^{1995} + ... + x + 1).\n\nThen, 1 + \u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} + ... + \u03c9^{(n-1)k} = 0 when k is not a multiple of n. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity that sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(1 + \u03c9^k} for n odd.\n\nWait, in fact, for n=1997, which is odd, the sum S = sum_{k=0}^{1996} 1/(1 + \u03c9^k) is known to be n/2. Because, as I found earlier, each pair contributes 1, and the middle term, when n is odd, is 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2, and the total number of pairs is (n-1)/2, so total sum is (n-1)/2 * 1 + 1/2 = (n-1)/2 + 1/2 = n/2.\n\nSince the problem asks for the sum from k=1 to 1997, which is sum from k=0 to 1996 of 1/(1 + \u03c9^k), that would be 1997/2. Therefore, the answer is 1997/2.\n\nBut let me verify this with an example for a smaller odd number, like n=3, to see if the formula holds.\n\nSo, for n=3, the roots of x^3 ="
