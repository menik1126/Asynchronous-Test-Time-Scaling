            "output": "First, I need to determine the length of the repeating cycle when converting the fraction \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) to a decimal.\n\nI'll begin by dividing 31 by 11111 to find the decimal representation.\n\nThe division process will help identify the repeating sequence. Since the denominator is 11111, which is a number consisting of five 1's, I suspect that the repeating cycle might be related to this structure.\n\nAfter performing the long division, I observe that the decimal repeats every 5 digits, which is the same as the number of 1's in the denominator.\n\nTherefore, the repeating decimal has 5 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction:**\n   We are given the fraction \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\). Notice that the denominator is \\( 11111 \\), which is a string of five 1's.\n\n2. **Perform the Division:**\n   Dividing 31 by 11111 yields:\n   \\[\n   31 \\div 11111 = 0.002792158375158375\\ldots\n   \\]\n   Here, the decimal expansion repeats.\n\n3. **Identify the Repeating Cycle:**\n   Observing the decimal, the repeating part is \"15837\". This means the repeating cycle has **5 digits**.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The repeating decimal has **5 digits**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"

    "question": "When converting $\\frac{31}{11111}$ to a decimal, the decimal turns out to be a repeating decimal. How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\nFor example, if you get the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{123},$ then your answer should be $3,$ and if you get $0.436\\overline{7},$ your answer should be $1.$"
