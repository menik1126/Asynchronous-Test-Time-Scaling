            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about the superfactorial, right? It's defined as this tower of factorials, and I need to find the units digit of 4\\$. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what the superfactorial is. The problem says it's n\\$ = n!^{{n!^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}} with n! in the exponent. So for 4\\$, it's 4! raised to the power of another tower of factorials. That seems like a huge number, but since I only need the units digit, maybe I can find a pattern or cycle in the units digit without computing the entire number.\n\nLet me write it out more clearly. For 4\\$:\n\n4\\$ = 4!^(4!^(4!^...^4!))\n\nThere are four 4!'s in the exponent tower. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. The superfactorial is n! raised to a tower of n!s, n-1 times. So for 4\\$, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). So it's four levels: the topmost is 4!, then the next is 4!^4!, then the next is 4!^(4!^4!), and the bottom is 4! raised to that. So it's a tower of four 4!s.\n\nBut wait, calculating that directly seems impossible because the numbers get so large so quickly. But since we're only interested in the units digit, maybe I can find a pattern or use modular arithmetic to simplify it.\n\nI remember that for units digits, we can often work modulo 10 because the units digit is the remainder when divided by 10. But since exponents can have cycles, maybe I can find the exponent modulo the totient of 10, which is 4, because \u03c6(10) = 4. But wait, actually, it might be a bit more complicated because the exponent itself can be large.\n\nWait, let's start at the top of the tower and work our way down. That often helps with nested exponentials.\n\nLet me denote the tower as follows:\n\na_1 = 4!\n\na_2 = 4!^a_1"

Wait, hold on, the base is 4! = 24, so each exponent in the tower is 24, right?\n\nWait, actually, the problem defines the superfactorial as n\\$ with a tower of n! number of n!s. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me check the definition again:\n\nThe superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}}} }_{n!}.\n\nWait, so the tower has a total of n! number of n!'s. That would mean for n=4, the tower has 24 terms? Because 4! is 24. That can't be right, because that would be a tower of 24 terms, each being 24. That's way too big. Maybe the question is using a different notation? Wait, maybe the number above the underbrace is the number of exponents? Or perhaps the tower's height is n!\n\nWait, the problem says it's underbrace{...}_{n!}. The underbrace typically indicates that the expression above it has n! terms? Hmm, the standard notation for a tower is like a^a^a with height k, so if this is saying the number of terms in the tower is n!, then for n=4, it's 24 terms each being 24.\n\nBut that seems too big. Maybe I have a misunderstanding here. Let me see the problem again:\n\n\"n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}}}}_{n!} \"\n\nSo the underbrace is indicating that the total number of \"n!\" in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nTherefore, for n=4, the superfactorial is a tower of 24 (since 4! =24) instances of 24.\n\nSo, 4\\$ is 24^"

That's a massive number, but again, we just need the units digit.\n\nBut maybe we can work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute 24^1 mod 10. 24 mod 10 is 4. 4^1 is 4. So units digit is 4.\n\nNext, 24^2 mod 10: 4^2=16, so units digit 6.\n\n24^3 mod 10: 4^3=64, units digit 4.\n\n24^4 mod 10: 4^4=256, units digit 6.\n\nWait, I see a pattern here. The units digit cycles every 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nSo, the cycle length is 2. So if we can find the exponent mod 2, we can determine whether it's in the first position (units digit 4) or the second (units digit 6).\n\nSo for 24^k mod 10, the units digit cycles with period 2.\n\nThus, to find 24^k mod 10, compute k mod 2.\n\nIf k is even, units digit is 6; if k is odd, units digit is 4.\n\nBut now, the exponent in 4\\$ is a tower of 24s 24 levels high. So to compute 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 exponents. To compute this, we have to find the exponent mod \u03c6(\u03c6(10)) because of Euler's theorem.\n\nWait, let me think. Since we have 24^k, and k is some exponent which is itself a tower. Since modulo 10, the totient is 4, but because base 24 is co-prime to 10? Wait, 24 and 10 are not coprime, as 24 is 2^3*3, and 10 is 2*5, so GCD(24,10)=2.\n\nSo Euler's theorem does not apply directly because they share a common factor.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use Chinese Remainder Theorem, by computing modulo 2 and modulo 5, then combine the results.\n\nBut wait, 10=2*5, so we can compute the number mod 2"

So actually, the base 24 can be reduced to 4 mod 10. So the problem reduces to finding 4^(tower of 24s) mod 10.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Since 24 \u2261 4 mod 10, so 24^anything \u2261 4^anything mod 10. Therefore, the entire expression 24^(24^(...)) mod 10 is equivalent to 4^(24^(...)) mod 10. But since the exponent is a tower of 24s, but since we can replace the base 24 with 4 mod 10, but the exponents are still 24s. Wait, but actually, the exponents themselves are part of the tower. Hmm, perhaps I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe entire expression is 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 terms. Since 24 \u2261 4 mod 10, so the base is 4 mod 10. The exponent is 24^(24^...) mod something. To compute 4^E mod 10, where E is the exponent tower above.\n\nSo, to compute 4^E mod 10, since 4 and 10 are not coprime, but 4 is a power of 2, perhaps we can use the fact that 4^1 mod 10 =4, 4^2=16 mod10=6, 4^3=4, etc. So the cycle is 2 as before. So the exponent E mod 2 will determine the result.\n\nTherefore, if E is even, 4^E mod10=6; if E is odd, 4^E mod10=4.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find whether the exponent E (the tower of 24s with 23 more 24s above the"

So the height is 24. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focusing on the parity (even or odd) of the exponent.\n\nSo, since we need to know if E is even or odd, perhaps we can find E mod 2.\n\nSo, E = 24^(24^(...)) with 24 exponents. So is E even or odd?\n\nBut 24 is even, so 24^anything (except 0) is even. So 24^anything is even if the exponent is \u22651.\n\nTherefore, E is 24^(something), which is even, so E is even.\n\nThus, E is even. Therefore, E mod 2=0.\n\nTherefore, 4^E mod10=6.\n\nWait, so putting it all together:\n\nThe units digit of 24^(tower) is 6.\n\nBut let me verify if I did that correctly.\n\nWait, 24\u22614 mod10. So 24^k mod10=4^k mod10.\n\nNow, 4^k mod10 cycles with period 1? Wait, no, 4^1=4, 4^2=6, 4^3=4, 4^4=6, etc. So the cycle is 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nTherefore, to find 4^k mod10, if k is odd, 4; if even, 6.\n\nSo to find 4^E mod10, we need to know if E is even or odd.\n\nBut E is 24^(24^...). Since 24 is even, any 24^something is even, so E is even.\n\nThus, E is even, so 4^E mod10=6.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that E is not 0. Because if E was 0, 4^0=1, but E is 24^(...), which is at least 24^1=24, so E is definitely even and \u226524.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the height of the tower.\n\nWait, the super"

Because the base is the first 24, then the exponent is the next 24, etc. So the total height is 24.\n\nWait, but when we talk about the exponent E, it's the entire tower above the base. So the base is 24, and the exponent is the tower of 23 24s. So E is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 terms.

Then the units digit would be 4^(24 mod 2) mod10? Wait, no, let's compute 24^24 mod10. Since 24 mod10=4, so 4^24 mod10. Since 24 is even, 4^24 mod10=6.
