Hmm, so the table gives us percentages for each grade, but I think we need the actual numbers or maybe just proportions. Wait, no, maybe we can work directly with the percentages.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the grade where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Let me make sure I understand this correctly. For each grade, we have two percentages: one for males and one for females. We need to calculate how many males there would be if females are 100%, then find out what percentage that male number is of the female number, and see which grade is closest to 135%.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the question is saying the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. So, mathematically, for each grade, let's denote:\n\nM = percentage of male bus riders\nF = percentage of female bus riders\n\nWe need to find for which grade, M is approximately 1.35 * F.\n\nSo, for each grade, compute M / F and see if it's closest to 1.35. That ratio M/F would tell us how many times the number of males is compared to females. If M/F is 1.35, then M is 135% of F, which is what we're looking for.\n\nLet me write down the data again:\n\n- 9th grade: M=41.1%, F=39.4%\n- 10th grade: M=34.4%, F=33.1%\n- 11th grade: M=20.6%, F=13.8%\n- 12th grade: M=11.6%, F=8.6%\n\nSo, for each grade, compute M / F.\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n\nM/F = 41.1 / 39.4 \u2248 Let's compute that. 39.4 * 1.035 is roughly 41.1, so 1.035. So the ratio is about 1.035, which is much less than 1.35.\n\n10th grade:\n\n34.4 / 33.1 \u2248 Let me calculate: 33.1 * 1.035 \u2248 34.33, which is close"

So approximately 1.04, which is still way below 1.35.\n\nHmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Wait, perhaps I need to consider the actual numbers of students, since the percentages are of different total numbers? Wait, the problem says \"300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed.\" Oh, that's important! So each grade has 300 males and 300 females surveyed. Therefore, the number of bus riders for each gender is 300 multiplied by the percentage (as a decimal). \n\nAh, so the actual number of male bus riders is 300*(M%) and female is 300*(F%). Therefore, the question is asking for which grade, the number of male bus riders (300*M%) is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders (300*F%). \n\nSo, let's write that equation:\n\n300*M% \u2248 1.35*(300*F%)\n\nWe can cancel out the 300, so M% \u2248 1.35*F%\n\nTherefore, the ratio M% / F% \u2248 1.35. So actually, my initial approach was correct. So, the ratio of the percentages (since the base is the same for both genders) is exactly what we need. So, the ratio M% divided by F% should be as close as possible to 1.35. \n\nTherefore, let's compute M% / F% for each grade and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nLet me recast the percentages as decimals for calculation:\n\n9th grade: M = 0.411, F = 0.394\n\nRatio: 0.411 / 0.394 \u2248 Let's compute that. 0.411 divided by 0.394. Let me do this division:\n\n0.394 * 1 = 0.394\n\n0.394"

So, males are 11.6, females 8.6. So, number of males is 11.6, females are 8.6. So, 11.6 is 135% of 8.6?\n\nWait, let me check 8.6 *1.35 = 11.61. So, 11.6 is approximately 135% of 8.6. So, that's exactly it.\n\nSo, for 12th grade, male bus riders are 11.6, which is 135% of 8.6 female riders, which is exactly 8.6. So, 135% of that is 11.61, so 11.6 is practically 135%.

So, the number of students taking the bus is 300*(percentage).
