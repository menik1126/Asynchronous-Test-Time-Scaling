            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a table with four grades: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. For each grade, we have the percentage of males and females who are bus riders. The total number of students surveyed in each grade is 300 males and 300 females. So, that's 600 students per grade.\n\nThe question is asking for the grade where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders. That means for each grade, I need to calculate how many males and females are bus riders, then see if the number of males is roughly 1.35 times the number of females. Whichever grade is closest to that 135% mark is the answer.\n\nAlright, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. For each grade, calculate the number of male bus riders.\n2. For each grade, calculate the number of female bus riders.\n3. Compute 135% of the female bus riders for each grade.\n4. Find the difference between the number of male bus riders and 135% of female bus riders for each grade.\n5. Determine which grade has the smallest difference; that's our answer.\n\nWait, but before diving into calculations, maybe there's a smarter way to do this. Since the percentages are given, I can find the ratio of males to females in each grade and see if that ratio is approximately 1.35:1.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the total number of students surveyed is 300 males and 300 females in each grade, I can use these to calculate the actual numbers.\n\nLet me do both methods to cross-validate.\n\nStarting with the first method:\n\nFor each grade, compute the actual number of male and female bus riders.\n\nGiven that 41.1% are males in 9th grade, so number of male bus riders is 41.1% of 300, which is 0.411 * 300 = 123.3 males. Similarly, females are 39.4%, so 0.394 * 300 = 118.2 females.\n\nWait, but 123.3 males and 118.2 females. So males are 123."

Wait no, 135% is 1.35, so 118.2 * 1.35.\n\nLet me compute 118.2 * 1.35:\n\nFirst, 100 * 1.35 = 135, 18.2 * 1.35 = ?\n\n18 * 1.35 = 24.3, 0.2*1.35 = 0.27, so total 24.3 + 0.27 = 24.57. So total is 135 + 24.57 = 159.57. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 118.2 * 1.35. Wait, maybe I should do it another way:\n\n118.2 * 1.35:\n\nMultiply 118.2 * 1 = 118.2,\n\n118.2 * 0.3 = 35.46,\n\n118.2 * 0.05 = 5.91,\n\nSo total is 118.2 + 35.46 + 5.91.\n\nAdding 118.2 + 35.46 is 153.66; then +5.91 gives 159.57.\n\nSo 1.35 times the female riders is about 159.57, but the actual number of male riders is only 123.3.\n\nSo the difference is 123.3 vs 159.57? Wait, but actually, the question is asking for male riders closest to 135% of female riders. So the male riders should be compared to 135% of females, so 123.3 vs 135% of "
