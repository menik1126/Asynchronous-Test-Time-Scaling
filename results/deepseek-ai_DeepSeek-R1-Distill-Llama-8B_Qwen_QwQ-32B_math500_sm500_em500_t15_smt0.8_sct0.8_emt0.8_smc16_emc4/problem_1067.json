            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since a regular hexagon has six equal sides, I can calculate the total perimeter by multiplying the side length by 6.\n\nNext, the problem states that the regular octagon has the same perimeter as this hexagon. A regular octagon has eight equal sides, so I'll divide the total perimeter by 8 to find the length of each side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- A regular hexagon with side length \\( 16 \\) cm.\n- The regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon.\n\n**Steps to Find the Side Length of the Octagon:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6** equal sides.\n   \n   - Perimeter of the hexagon \\( = \\text{Number of sides} \\times \\text{Side length} \\)\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Side Length of the Octagon:**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8** equal sides.\n   \n   - The perimeter of the octagon is equal to the perimeter of the hexagon.\n   \n   - Let \\( s \\) be the length of each side of the octagon.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{octagon}} = 8 \\times s\n   \\]\n   \n   - Since the perimeters are equal:\n   \n   \\[\n   8s = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n   \n   - Solve for \\( s \\):\n   \n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{96}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nEach side of the octagon is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) cm long."
