            "output": "I need to simplify the given expression step by step. The expression is a fraction within a square root in the numerator and a square root in the denominator. I'll start by simplifying the terms inside the numerator.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each term in the numerator separately. The first term is 5 divided by the square root of 80. I can simplify the square root of 80 by factoring it into 16 times 5, so the square root of 80 becomes 4 times the square root of 5. This means the first term becomes 5 divided by 4 times the square root of 5, which simplifies to (5/4) times (1 over root 5).\n\nNext, I'll examine the second term, which is the square root of 845 divided by 9. I can factor 845 into 5 times 169, and since 169 is 13 squared, the square root of 845 is 13 times the square root of 5. This makes the second term (13 times the square root of 5) divided by 9, or (13/9) times root 5.\n\nThe third term in the numerator is the square root of 45. Factoring 45 into 9 times 5, the square root of 45 becomes 3 times the square root of 5.\n\nNow, I'll combine all three simplified terms in the numerator: (5/4\u221a5) + (13/9\u221a5) + (3\u221a5). To combine these, I'll express 3\u221a5 as (12/4\u221a5) to have a common denominator with the first term. This gives me (5/4\u221a5) + (13/9\u221a5) + (12/4\u221a5).\n\nAdding the numerators of the first and third terms, I get (5 + 12)/4\u221a5, which is 17/4\u221a5. Then, adding this to the second term, which is 13/9\u221a5, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 9 is 36, so I'll convert both fractions. For 17/4\u221a5, multiplying numerator and denominator by 9 gives 153/36\u221a5. For 13/9\u221a5, multiplying numerator and denominator by 4 gives 52/36\u221a5. Adding these together results in 205/36"

So the entire expression under the square root becomes (205/(36\u221a5)) divided by \u221a5. Dividing by \u221a5 is the same as multiplying by 1/\u221a5, so this becomes 205/(36\u221a5 * \u221a5). Since \u221a5 times \u221a5 is 5, the denominator becomes 36*5 = 180. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 205/180 under the square root.\n\nSimplifying 205/180, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 5. 205 divided by 5 is 41, and 180 divided by 5 is 36. So the fraction becomes 41/36. Therefore, the square root of 41/36 is \u221a41 divided by 6, since the square root of 36 is 6. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake in combining terms. Let me go back to the numerator terms:\n\nFirst term: 5 / sqrt(80) = 5/(4\u221a5). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5): (5\u221a5)/(4*5) = \u221a5/4. So actually, the first term simplifies to \u221a5/4, not 5/(4\u221a5). I think I messed up here earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nStarting over with the first term: 5 divided by sqrt(80). sqrt(80) is 4*sqrt(5), so 5/(4\u221a5). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5): (5*sqrt(5))/(4*5) = sqrt(5)/4. So that term is sqrt(5)/4.\n\nSecond term: sqrt(845)/9. sqrt(845) is sqrt(169*5) = 13*sqrt(5). So that term is (13*sqrt(5))/9.\n\nThird term: sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5). So that term is 3*"
