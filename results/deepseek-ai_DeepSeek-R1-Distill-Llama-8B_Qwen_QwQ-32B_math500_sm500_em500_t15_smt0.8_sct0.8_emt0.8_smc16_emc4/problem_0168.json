            "output": "Alright, so I've got this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems.\n\nFirst off, the equation is \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\\). I remember that cube roots can be a bit tricky sometimes, but I think the key here is to get rid of that cube root to solve for x. So, how do I do that? Well, if I have something equal to a cube root, I can cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube root. That makes sense because cubing should cancel out the cube root effect.\n\nSo, let me try that. I'll cube both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\\right)^3 = 16^3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that, the cube and the cube root should cancel each other out on the left side, leaving me with:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3\n\\]\n\nOkay, now I need to calculate what 16 cubed is. Hmm, 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16? Let me compute that. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, 16 cubed is 4096. That means the equation now is:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I need to move everything to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that, 4 minus 4096 is -4092. So now I have:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\\]\n\nQuadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where a is "

            "output": "1, b is -4, and c is -4092.\n\nBefore I apply the formula, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, original equation: cube root of (x\u00b2 -4x +4) equals 16. I cubed both sides, so x\u00b2 -4x +4 equals 16\u00b3, which is 4096. Then subtract 4096 to get x\u00b2 -4x -4092 = 0. Yep, that seems right.\n\nNow, plugging the coefficients into the quadratic formula:\n\na = 1, b = -4, c = -4092\n\nSo,\n\nDiscriminant (D) = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-4)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384\n\nWait, that's a big number. Let me confirm:\n\n(-4)^2 is 16.\n\n4ac is 4*1*(-4092) = -16368\n\nSo, D = 16 - (-16368) = 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nOkay, 16384. Hmm, I think that's a perfect square. Let me see. What's the square root of 16384? Maybe 128? Because 128 squared is 16384. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo, sqrt(16384) = 128.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(D)]/(2a) = [4 \u00b1 128]/2\n\nBecause b is -4, so -b is 4, and sqrt(D) is 128.\n\nSo, the two solutions are:\n\nx = (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66\n\nand\n\nx = (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62\n\nWait a second, so x can be 66 or -62. But the question specifically asks for the positive value of x. So, the answer should be 66.\n\nLet me just verify my solution to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's plug x = 66 back into the original equation:\n\nCompute x\u00b2 -4x +4:\n\n66 squared is 4356.\n\n4 times 66 is 264.\n\nSo, 4356 - 264 = 4092, plus 4 is 4096.\n\nSo, cube root"

Good.\n\nNow let's check x = -62 just to be thorough.\n\nx\u00b2 is (-62)^2 = 3844.\n\n-4x is -4*(-62)= 248.\n\nSo, 3844 + 248 = 4092, plus 4 is 4096. Cube root of 4096 is still 16.\n\nSo, both x = 66 and x = -62 satisfy the equation. Since the question asks for the positive value, 66 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 -4x +4} = 16\\).\n\nCubing both sides: \\(x^2 -4x +4 = 4096\\).\n\nYes, that's correct because 16 cubed is 4096.\n\nBringing 4096 to the left: \\(x^2 -4x +4 -4096 = 0\\) which simplifies to \\(x^2 -4x -4092 = 0\\). That's right.\n\nQuadratic formula: a=1, b=-4, c=-4092.\n\nDiscriminant D = (-4)^2 -4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nSquare root of 16384 is indeed 128.\n\nSo, solutions x = [4 \u00b1128]/2.\n\nCalculates to 132/2=66 and -24/2=-62.\n\nPlugging back in, both are valid. So, yes, everything checks out.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.
