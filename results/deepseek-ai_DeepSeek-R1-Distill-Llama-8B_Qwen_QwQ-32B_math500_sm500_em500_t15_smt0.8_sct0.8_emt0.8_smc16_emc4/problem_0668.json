            "output": "First, I'll start by assigning variables to each type of weight to make the relationships clearer. Let's let T represent the weight of a treek, S represent the weight of a squig, and G represent the weight of a goolee.\n\nNext, I'll translate the given information into mathematical equations. The first statement says that ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee, so I'll write that as 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThen, the second statement says that two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig, which gives me 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I'll use substitution to solve for the variables. From the second equation, I can express G in terms of T and S: G = S - 2T. I'll substitute this expression for G into the first equation to eliminate G, resulting in 10T = 3S + (S - 2T). Simplifying this, I combine like terms and get 10T = 4S - 2T. Then, I'll add 2T to both sides to isolate the T terms: 12T = 4S.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for S in terms of T by dividing both sides by 4, which gives S = 3T. This means that the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let \\( T \\) represent the weight of one treek.\n- Let \\( S \\) represent the weight of one squig.\n- Let \\( G \\) represent the weight of one goolee.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Statements into Equations**\n1.
