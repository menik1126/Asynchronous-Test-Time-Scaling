Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down the given condition and the expression I need to minimize. The condition is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), and I need to minimize \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Maybe I can express some variables in terms of others or find a substitution that simplifies the problem.\n\nLet me think about symmetry here. The expression I'm trying to minimize, \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\), but not in \\(y\\). So maybe I can assume that \\(x = z\\) to simplify things? Let me try that approach.\n\nIf I set \\(x = z\\), then the condition becomes \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot x \\cdot (x + y + x) = 1\\), which simplifies to \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\). And the expression to minimize becomes \\((x + y)(y + x)\\), which simplifies to \\((x + y)^2\\). So, now I have to minimize \\((x + y)^2\\) under the constraint \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit more manageable. Maybe I can use substitution here. Let me denote \\(s = x + y\\), so \\(y = s - x\\). Substituting back into the constraint, I get:\n\n\\(x^2 (s - x) (2x + (s - x)) = 1\\)\n\nSimplify the second term: \\(2x + (s - x) = x + s\\). So the constraint now is \\(x^2 (s - x)(x + s) = 1\\).\n\nWait, that looks like \\(x^2 (s - x)(s + x)\\). Hmm, \\( (s - x)(s + x) = s^2 - x^2\\), so the constraint becomes \\(x^2 ("

Hmm, but I also have \\(s = x + y\\), and I want to express everything in terms of \\(s\\) and \\(x\\), but maybe that's not the best way. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the expression \\((x + y)^2\\) to minimize, which is \\(s^2\\), maybe I can relate it to the constraint. Let's see:\n\nFrom the constraint, after substituting \\(x = z\\), we have \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\). Let me express \\(y\\) from \\(s = x + y\\), so \\(y = s - x\\), and plug that into the constraint:\n\n\\(x^2 (s - x)(2x + s - x) = x^2 (s - x)(x + s) = 1\\).\n\nWhich again gives \\(x^2 (s^2 - x^2) = 1\\), same as before. So, \\(x^2 s^2 - x^4 = 1\\). Hmm, so we have \\(s^2 x^2 - x^4 = 1\\). Let me solve for \\(s^2\\):\n\n\\(s^2 = \\frac{1 + x^4}{x^2}\\).\n\nSo \\(s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + x^4}{x^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + x^4}}{x}\\).\n\nBut since \\(s = x + y\\), and \\(y\\) is positive, \\(s\\) must be greater than \\(x\\). So, \\(s = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + x^4}}{x}\\) must be greater than \\(x\\). Let's check that:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{1 + x^4}}{x} > x\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(x\\) (since \\(x > 0\\)):\n\n\\(\\sqrt{1 + x^4} > x^2\\)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\(1 + x^4 > x^4\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to \\(1 > 0\\), which is always true. So, that condition is satisfied. Good.\n\nNow, going back"

So, that seems contradictory. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, no. When I assumed \\(x = z\\), I set \\(x = z\\), but in reality, in the Lagrangian, after substituting \\(x = z\\), the equation led me to \\(x^3 - x^2 y = 0\\), implying \\(x = y\\). But if \\(x = y\\), then since \\(x = z\\), all variables are equal, which is not the minimal case.\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps setting \\(x = z\\) is only a path to the minimal value, but we need to ensure that the other equations are satisfied.\n\nWait, maybe I need to revisit the partial derivatives. Let me see.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\( y + z = \\lambda (yzS + xyz) \\)\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\n\\( x + y = \\lambda (xyS + xyz) \\)\n\nLet me divide equation 1 by equation 3:\n\n\\( \\frac{y + z}{x + y} = \\frac{yzS + xyz}{xyS + xyz} \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( \\frac{y + z}{x + y} = \\frac{z(S + x)}{x(S + z)} \\). As before.\n\nBut, given that \\(x = z\\), the left-hand side is \\(\\frac{y + x}{x + y} = 1\\), and the right-hand"
