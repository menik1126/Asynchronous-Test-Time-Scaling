Here, a_1 is 1, d is 2, and a_n is 199. Solving for n gives n = 100.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n). Substituting the known values, S_100 = 50 * (1 + 199) = 50 * 200 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I perform the division: 10,000 \u00f7 7 = 1,428 with a remainder of 4. Therefore, the remainder is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Sequence\nThe given sequence is an arithmetic series where the first term \\(a_1 = 1\\) and the common difference \\(d = 2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Terms\nThe last term \\(a_n = 199\\).
