I remember that when a matrix transforms a point, it can also transform entire lines or shapes. But I'm not entirely sure how to approach this. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the matrix M transforms points in R\u00b2 to R\u00b2. So, if I have a line in R\u00b2, I need to figure out how M maps that line. The line given is y = 2x + 1. Maybe I should consider how the matrix acts on points on this line and then find the equation of the transformed line.\n\nI know that to transform a line, I can transform two points on the line and then find the equation of the line connecting their images. That seems like a solid approach. So, I need to pick two points from the original line y = 2x + 1. Let's pick x = 0 and x = 1 for simplicity.\n\nWhen x = 0, y = 2(0) + 1 = 1. So, the point (0, 1) is on the line. \nWhen x = 1, y = 2(1) + 1 = 3. So, the point (1, 3) is also on the line.\n\nNow, I need to apply the matrix M to both these points. Wait, but I don't actually have the matrix M. Hmm. The problem only tells me what M does to two specific vectors, which are (2, -1) and (1, -3). It seems like M is linear, so maybe I can use that to find M or at least find its effect on the line.\n\nWait a second, maybe I can express the transformation of the line in terms of the given transformations. Let me recall that if a line is transformed by a matrix, the image of the line can be found using the inverse of the matrix or something related. But I don't remember exactly, so I need to figure it out.\n\nLet me denote M as a 2x2 matrix:\n\nM = [a  b]\n      [c  d]\n\nI need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. To do that, I can consider the inverse of the transformation or maybe find the relationship between the original coordinates and the transformed ones.\n\n"

Once I have M, I can apply it to the line equation.\n\nYes, that might be the way to go. Let me try that approach.\n\nGiven that M transforms vector v1 = [2, -1] to [9, 3], and vector v2 = [1, -3] to [7, -1]. So, if I can write M as a matrix, then M*v1 = [9; 3] and M*v2 = [7; -1].\n\nLet me set up equations for the matrix M. Let me denote M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n      [c  d]\n\nThen, applying M to v1:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, applying M to v2:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo, now I have two systems of equations for the variables a, b and c, d.\n\nFirst, let's solve for a and b using the first equations:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 2: a - 3b = 7\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, the second equation for a and b comes from the second vector. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the first vector v1 is [2, -1], so the first equation for the top row is 2a - b = 9, and the bottom row is 2c - d = 3.\n\nThe second vector v2 is [1, -3], so the top row equation is 1*a + (-3)*b = 7, so a - 3b = 7.\n\nSimilarly, the bottom row equation is 1*c + (-3)*d = -1, so c - 3d = -1.\n\nTherefore, we have two separate systems:\n\nFor the top row (a and b):\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) a - 3b = 7\n\nFor the bottom row (c and d):\n\n1) 2c - d = 3\n2) c - 3d = -1\n\nLet me solve the top system first"

Wait, actually, perhaps I confused the substitution.\n\nWait, no, the lines are in the original coordinates, so when I transformed the point (x, y) on the original line, I got (u, v) = (2x -1, 4x +1). So, for the image line, (u, v) must satisfy the relation v = 2u +3. Therefore, in terms of u and v, the image line is y = 2x +3, since in the transformed coordinates, u and v play the roles of x and y.\n\nWait, actually, no. Wait, (u, v) is the new coordinates, so in the transformed system, the image line is v = 2u +3.

Applying M to this vector:\n\nM*(1, 2)^T = [4*1 -1*2; 2*1 +1*2] = [4 -2; 2 +2] = [2; 4]\n\nSo, the direction vector of the image line is (2, 4), which simplifies to (1, 2) again? Wait, no, (2,4) is just a scalar multiple of (1,2). Wait, so the direction vector remains in the same direction? Hmm, interesting.\n\nWait, but the direction vector is transformed, so the direction of the image line is along (2,4), which is the same direction as (1,2). So, the direction is preserved? Wait, but maybe the scaling is different, but the direction is the same. Wait, but that might not necessarily mean the line is parallel, but in this case, since the direction vector is scaled, the direction is the same. So, the image line is parallel to the original line?\n\nWait, but let's check the point. The original line passes through (0,1). Applying M to (0,1):\n\nM*(0,1)^T = [4*0 -1*1; 2*0 +1*1] = [-1; 1]\n\nSo, the transformed point is (-1,1). Therefore, the image line should pass through (-1,1) and have direction vector (2,4). So, the parametric equation of the image line is:\n\n(x, y) = (-1,1) + t*(2,4)\n\nTo convert this to the equation y = mx + b, let's express x and y in terms of t.\n\nLet me write:\n\nx = -1 + 2t\n\ny = 1 + 4t\n\nSolve for t from the x equation: t = (x +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into y equation:\n\ny = 1 + 4*( (x +1)/2 ) = 1 + 2(x +1) = 1 + 2x + 2 = 2x +3\n\nSo, that gives y = 2x +3, which matches the previous"

But let me check with another approach to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother method is to express the transformation of the line as a linear transformation on the vector space. So, the line can be considered as a set of vectors, which are linear combinations of the direction vector and a point vector. So, any point on the line can be written as (0,1) + t*(1,2). Then, applying M, we get M*(0,1) + M*(1,2)*t.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier, leading to (-1,1) + (2,4)*t, so the image is y = 2x +3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more rigorously, the image of a line under a linear transformation is either a line, a point, or no points (if the line is only the origin, but in this case, the line isn't just the origin). So, the image should be a line.\n\nBut then, another way to think about it is to use the inverse of M. Because if we have a point (x', y') on the image line, then there exists a point (x, y) on the original line such that M*(x, y) = (x', y').\n\nSo, perhaps express (x', y') in terms of (x, y), with y = 2x +1.\n\nSo, (x', y') = M*(x, 2x +1)^T.\n\nWhich is:\n\nx' = 4x - (2x +1) = 2x -1\n\ny' = 2x + (2x +1) = 4x +1\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx' = 2x -1\n\ny' = 4x +1\n\nNow, let's express x in terms of x' and substitute into y':\n\nFrom x' = 2x -1, we get x = (x' +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into y':\n\ny' = 4*( (x' +1)/2 ) +1 = 2(x' +1) +1 = 2x' +2"

Let's take the point (0,1) on the original line. Applying M gives:\n\nM*(0,1) = [4*0 -1*1, 2*0 +1*1]^T = (-1,1). So, (-1,1) is on the image line.\n\nAnother point, say (1,3). Applying M:\n\nM*(1,3) = [4*1 -1*3, 2*1 +1*3]^T = (4 -3, 2 +3) = (1,5). \n\nSo, the point (1,5) should be on the image line. Let's see if it satisfies y = 2x +3.\n\nPlugging x =1: 2*1 +3 =5, which matches. \n\nAnother point, let's take x = -1 on the original line. Then y = 2*(-1)+1 = -1. So, point (-1, -1).
