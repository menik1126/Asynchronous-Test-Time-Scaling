            "output": "Okay, so William Sydney Porter was trying to calculate the division of two complex numbers: (-3 + 4i) divided by (1 + 2i). But he made a mistake by missing the minus sign in the numerator, so he did 3 + 4i over 1 + 2i instead. And he got the result as 11/5 - 2/5 i. Now, I need to figure out what the correct answer should have been if he had done it right.\n\nFirst, I remember that dividing complex numbers involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the imaginary unit i from the denominator. The conjugate of (1 + 2i) is (1 - 2i). So, the correct calculation should be:\n\n(-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i) \u00d7 (1 - 2i)/(1 - 2i). The idea is to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by this conjugate.\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: (-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i). Using the distributive property, I'll multiply each term:\n\n-3 \u00d7 1 = -3  \n-3 \u00d7 (-2i) = 6i  \n4i \u00d7 1 = 4i  \n4i \u00d7 (-2i) = -8i\u00b2. Wait, but i\u00b2 is -1, so -8i\u00b2 becomes +8.\n\nNow, adding these together: -3 + 6i + 4i + 8. Combine like terms: (-3 + 8) + (6i + 4i) which is 5 + 10i.\n\nNow, the denominator is (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i). Multiplying these: 1\u00d71 = 1, 1\u00d7(-2i) = -2i, 2i\u00d71 = 2i, 2i\u00d7(-2i) = -4i\u00b2. Again, i\u00b2 is -1, so -4i\u00b2 = +4.\n\nAdding these: 1 - 2i + 2i + 4. The imaginary terms cancel out: (-2i + 2i) = 0, so we're left with 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nSo, putting it together, the result is (5 + 10i)/5, which simplifies"

Let me check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me redo the numerator: (-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i). \n\n-3 * 1 = -3  \n-3 * (-2i) = +6i  \n4i * 1 = 4i  \n4i * (-2i) = -8i\u00b2 = +8 (since i\u00b2 = -1). So adding them up: -3 + 8 is 5, and 6i + 4i is 10i. So numerator is 5 +10i.\n\nDenominator: (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1 - (2i)^2 = 1 - 4i\u00b2 = 1 +4 =5. So denominator is 5.\n\nThus, the result is (5 +10i)/5 = 1 +2i. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but William's result was 11/5 -2/5 i. So perhaps there's a mistake in his calculation. But let me think why. Maybe I misapplied something.\n\nWait, let me make sure that I correctly expanded the numerator. Wait, is (-3 +4i)(1 -2i) correctly calculated?\n\nYes:\n\n-3 *1 = -3  \n-3*(-2i) = 6i  \n4i*1 =4i  \n4i*(-2i) = -8i\u00b2 = +8. So adding: (-3 +8) + (6i +4i) =5 +10i.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nDenominator: (1 +2i)(1 -2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 =1 -4i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 = -1, that becomes 1 -4*(-1)=1 +4=5. So denominator is 5.\n\nThus, the correct result is (5+10i)/5 =1 +2i, which is 1 + 2i.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 1 + 2i, whereas William got 11/5 - 2/5i. Wait, that's strange because 11/5 is 2.2 and"

Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says William missed the minus sign, so he computed (3 +4i)/(1+2i) instead of (-3 +4i)/(1+2i). He got 11/5 -2/5i. Let me verify his calculation to see if that's correct.\n\nLet me compute (3 +4i)/(1+2i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1-2i):\n\nNumerator: (3 +4i)(1 -2i) = 3*1 +3*(-2i) +4i*1 +4i*(-2i)  \n= 3 -6i +4i -8i\u00b2  \n= 3 -2i +8 (since -8i\u00b2 is +8)  \n= 11 -2i.\n\nDenominator is same as before, 5. So (11 -2i)/5 = 11/5 - (2/5)i. That's exactly what he got. So his calculation was correct for the wrong numerator. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed (1 +2i). But let me check again my own calculation for the original problem. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recheck the numerator again for the original problem:\n\nOriginal numerator: (-3 +4i)(1 -2i). \n\n-3*1 = -3  \n-3*(-2i) = +6i  \n4i*1 =4i  \n4i*(-2i)= -8i\u00b2 = +8. \n\nAdding all terms: (-3 +8) =5, (6i +4i)=10i. So numerator is 5+10i. Divided by 5 gives 1+2i. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the correct answer should be 1 +2i. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"What answer should he have obtained?\" So the answer is 1 +2i, which is 1 + 2i. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in fractional form? Let me see:\n\nWait, 5+10i over 5 is (5/5) + (10i)/5 =1 +2i"
