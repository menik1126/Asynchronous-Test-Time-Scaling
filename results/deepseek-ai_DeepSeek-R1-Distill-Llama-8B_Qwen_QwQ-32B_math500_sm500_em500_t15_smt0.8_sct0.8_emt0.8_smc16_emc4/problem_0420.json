Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real number. So, \\(1/(r \\overline{r})\\) is the reciprocal of the squared magnitude of \\(r\\). That makes me think that this sum is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the squared magnitudes of the roots \\(r_1\\) to \\(r_5\\). But wait, there are 10 roots in total, paired as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). So, each pair contributes two roots. \n\nHmm, but the sum is only over the first five roots \\(r_1\\) to \\(r_5\\). Is that correct? Or am I misinterpreting the question? Let me check again. It says \"has 10 complex roots \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\)\", so each \\(r_i\\) is paired with its conjugate.

Since each pair contributes the same value, but actually, each pair is counted once here. Wait, actually, each term is for each \\(r_i\\), so since there are five such terms, each corresponding to a unique pair. So, the total sum is the sum over each of the five pairs of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). \n\nOkay, so maybe I need to find the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) for each of the five distinct roots (excluding their conjugates). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this without having to find each root individually. Since the equation is a polynomial equation, maybe I can use Vieta's formula? Vieta relates the sum and products of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. But since the equation is given as \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), perhaps I can rewrite this equation in a standard polynomial form and then apply Vieta's formula?\n\nLet me try that. Let's first expand the equation:\n\n\\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\)\n\nLet me denote \\(y = 13x - 1\\), but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps rearrange the equation as:\n\n\\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\)\n\nTaking the 10th roots of both sides, but since we are dealing with complex numbers, we can write:\n\n\\(x = \\omega \\cdot (-(13x - 1))\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = 1\\).

But let me check my steps again to be sure.\n\nFirst, I considered each root as \\(x = \\omega/(1 +13 \\omega)\\), where \\(\\omega^{10}=1\\). Then, \\(|r_j|^2 = |x|^2 = |\\omega|^2 / |1 +13 \\omega|^2 = 1 / |1 +13 \\omega|^2\\), so \\(1/|r_j|^2 = |1 +13 \\omega|^2\\). Therefore, the sum over all roots of \\(1/|r_j|^2\\) is the sum over all \\(\\omega^{10}=1\\) of \\(|1 +13 \\omega|^2\\). \n\nThen, expanding \\(|1 +13 \\omega|^2 = (1 +13 \\omega)(1 +13 \\overline{\\omega}) = 1 +13(\\omega + \\overline{\\omega}) + 169|\\omega|^2 = 1 +13*2 Re(\\omega) +169*1 = 170 +26 Re(\\omega). \n\nTherefore, the total sum S is sum_{\\omega} [170 +26 Re(\\omega)] = 10*"

Therefore, the sum over each pair (each \\(1/|r_j|^2\\)) is 1700 /2 =850.\n\nSo, yeah, 850 seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think about another approach to verify.\n\nSuppose we define \\(f(x) = x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}\\). Then, the roots of f(x)=0 are \\(x = \\frac{\\omega}{1 +13 \\omega}\\) as we found before, where \\(\\omega^{10}=1\\).\n\nTherefore, each root \\(r_j = \\frac{\\omega_j}{1 +13 \\omega_j}\\), where \\(\\omega_j\\) is a 10th root of unity.\n\nThus, \\(1/r_j = \\frac{1 +13 \\omega_j}{\\omega_j}\\).\n\nSo, \\(1/r_j = \\frac{1}{\\omega_j} +13\\).\n\nBut \\(1/\\omega_j = \\overline{\\omega_j}\\), since \\(|\\omega_j|=1\\). \n\nTherefore, \\(1/r_j = \\overline{\\omega_j} +13\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(1/r_j \\overline{r_j}\\) is \\(|1/r_j|^2 = |1 +13 \\omega_j|^2\\), which is the same as before. So, same as previous method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum over the reciprocals of \\(r_j \\overline{r_j}\\), which is the sum over \\(1/|r_j|^2\\). So, I need to compute the sum over all roots of \\(1/|r_j|^2\\), and then take half of it, as each pair contributes twice.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to think about the product over all roots. If we can find the product of all roots, then perhaps we can relate it to the constant term. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's consider reciprocal roots. Let me set \\(y =1/x\\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( (1/y)^{10} + (13*(1/y"

Maybe better to stick to the previous approach.\n\nIn any case, I think the first method gave me 850, so perhaps I can accept that as the answer. But just to double-check the steps:\n\n1. Roots: \\(x = \\frac{\\omega}{1 +13 \\omega}\\), \\(\\omega^{10}=1\\).\n\n2. \\(|x|^2 = 1 / |1 +13 \\omega|^2\\), so each term is \\(|1 +13 \\omega|^2\\).\n\n3. Sum over all 10 roots: S = sum_{\\omega} |1 +13 \\omega|^2 =1700.\n\n4. Since each pair contributes twice, the sum over each pair once is 1700 /2=850.\n\nThus, the answer is 850.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is \\boxed{850}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given equation:\n\n\\[x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0.\\]\n\nWe rewrite this as:\n\n\\[x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10},\\]\n\nwhich implies:\n\n\\[x = -\\omega (13x - 1),\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of unity.
