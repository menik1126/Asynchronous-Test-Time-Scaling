            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) to a decimal, I first use long division to divide 31 by 11111. This process reveals that the decimal is repeating, with the repeating part occurring after the decimal point.\n\nAfter identifying the repeating sequence, I count the number of digits that repeat. In this case, the repeating part consists of 1 digit.\n\nTherefore, the number of digits that repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is 1.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** When converting \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) to a decimal, the decimal turns out to be a repeating decimal. How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to convert the fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) into a decimal.\n   - The decimal will be repeating since 11111 is not a factor of powers of 10. Therefore, the fraction cannot be expressed as a finite decimal.\n\n2. **Convert the Fraction to Decimal:**\n   - Perform long division of 31 by 11111.\n   - Write down the decimal digits as they appear during the division.\n\n3. **Identify the Repeating Part:**\n   - Observe the decimal expansion to locate where the repeating sequence starts.\n   - Count the number of digits in this repeating sequence.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Repeating Digits:**\n   - In this case, the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is found to be \\(0.\\overline{0002}\\).\n   - The repeating part is \"0002\", which consists of **4 digits**.\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{4}\\)"
