            "output": "To determine the number of trailing zeros in 42 factorial (42!), I need to account for how many times the number 10 is a factor in 42!. Since 10 is equal to 2 multiplied by 5, the number of trailing zeros is influenced by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate how many times the number 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. This can be done by dividing 42 by 5 and taking the floor of the result: 42 ÷ 5 = 8.4, so there are 8 fives.\n\nNext, I'll identify how many times the number 2 appears as a factor in the same range. Dividing 42 by 2 gives 21, and continuing by dividing by 4 (which is 2 squared) yields 10.5, so there are 10 twos from 2, 4, 8, and 16; and an additional 4.5 from 32. This results in a total of 21 twos.\n\nSince each trailing zero requires one 2 and one 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the smaller count of the two, which in this case is 8. Therefore, 42! ends with 8 trailing zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count how many times the factor 10 is present in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), the number of trailing zeros is equal to the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). Usually, there are more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros.\n\nLet's compute how many times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, there are **8** factors of 5 in \\(42!\\).\n\nNext, we compute how many times 2 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\"
