            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of the original cube.\n\nThe cube has a side length of 3 inches, so the volume is calculated as 3 inches multiplied by 3 inches multiplied by 3 inches, which equals 27 cubic inches.\n\nNext, I should figure out how much metal is removed from the cube to create the steel sphere.\n\nSince the sphere is formed by removing metal from the cube's corners, I need to find out how many cubic inches are removed.\n\nEach corner of the cube that is removed is a small cube with a side length of 3 inches divided by 2, which is 1.5 inches. Therefore, each corner cube has a volume of 1.5 inches × 1.5 inches × 1.5 inches = 3.375 cubic inches.\n\nA cube has 8 corners, so the total volume removed is 8 × 3.375 cubic inches = 27 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, the volume of the cube is the original volume minus the volume of the metal removed, which is 27 cubic inches minus 27 cubic inches, resulting in 0 cubic inches.\n\nThis doesn't make sense because a sphere cannot have a volume equal to the cube. I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me reconsider. If the sphere is formed by cutting off the corners of the cube, the volume removed should be equal to the cube's volume minus the sphere's volume.\n\nUsing the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius of the sphere, I can calculate the sphere's volume.\n\nGiven that the sphere has a radius of 1.5 inches, the volume is (4/3)π(1.5)³ = (4/3)π(3.375) = 4.5π cubic inches.\n\nThis means the volume removed from the cube to create the sphere is the cube's volume minus the sphere's volume, which is 27 cubic inches minus 4.5π cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the original cube's volume is 27 - 4.5π cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, let's follow the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Determine the side length of the cube:**\n   \n   The steel sphere has a radius of 1.5 inches.

            "output": " a small cube. The sphere must fit perfectly inside the cube, touching the centers of each face. The diameter of the sphere (which is twice the radius) must equal the side length of the cube. \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Diameter of sphere} = 2 \\times \\text{radius} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   \n   Wait, this contradicts the given radius of 3 inches. Let me correct this:\n   \n   The sphere's radius is given as 3 inches, so its diameter is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Diameter} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the sphere must fit inside the cube, the cube's side length must equal the sphere's diameter:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Side length of cube} = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the volume of the cube:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume of cube} = (\\text{side length})^3 = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n   \n   The problem states the cube has the \"shortest possible side lengths,\" which aligns with the sphere's diameter being the minimum required to fit the sphere inside.\n\n3. **Verify the removal of metal from corners:**\n   \n   The problem mentions removing metal from the corners, but the sphere's volume is entirely contained within the cube. The volume of the sphere is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume of sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3)^3 = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n   \n   The cube's volume is 216 cubic inches, so the removed metal volume is:\n   \n   \\[\n   216 - 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n   \n   However, the question asks for the volume of the cube itself, not the removed metal. Since the cube must have the shortest possible side length to contain the sphere, the cube's volume is simply \\(6^3 = 216\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{216}"
