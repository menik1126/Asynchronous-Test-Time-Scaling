            "output": "First, I need to find the prime factorization of 196. I start by dividing 196 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. \n\n196 divided by 2 equals 98. This means 2 is a factor. \n\nNext, I divide 98 by 2 again to get 49. So, 2 is a factor once more. \n\nNow, I have 49 left. I check if it's divisible by 2, but it's not. I move on to the next prime number, which is 3. \n\nDividing 49 by 3 doesn't result in a whole number, so 3 is not a factor. \n\nI try the next prime number, which is 5. Dividing 49 by 5 also doesn't give a whole number, so 5 is not a factor either. \n\nFinally, I check 7. Dividing 49 by 7 gives me 7. This means 7 is a factor. \n\nI take 7 and divide it by 7 to get 1. \n\nSo, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared, 7 to the first power, and 7 to the first power. To make it clearer, I can write this as 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. \n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, I add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply the results together. \n\nThat means (2 + 1) multiplied by (2 + 1) equals 3 \u00d7 3, which equals 9. \n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of 196.**\n   \n   - Divide 196 by 2: \\(196 \u00f7 2 = 98\\). So, 2 is a factor.\n   - Divide the result by 2: \\(98 \u00f7 2 = 49\\). Another 2 is a factor.\n   - Now, divide 49 by 7: \\(49 \u00f7 7 = 7\\). So, 7 is a factor.\n   - Finally, divide 7 by 7: \\(7 \u00f7 7 = 1\\). So, 7 is a factor.\n   \n   Therefore, the prime factors of 196"
