            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nI remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0) can be found using the distance formula, which is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). So, my goal is to minimize this distance function subject to the constraint given by the equation of the graph.\n\nSince the distance function is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), it might be easier to minimize the square of the distance, which is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, because the square root function is increasing. That means the point where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 is the smallest will also be the point where the distance is the smallest. So, I can set up a function f(x) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 and substitute y from the given equation into this function.\n\nLet me do that substitution. Given y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3), so y\u00b2 would be [1/\u221a2(x\u00b2 - 3)]\u00b2. Let me compute that:\n\ny\u00b2 = (1/\u221a2)\u00b2 * (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 = (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2.\n\nSo, f(x) = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2.\n\nSimplify this expression. Let me expand (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 = x^4 - 6x\u00b2 + 9.\n\nSo now, f(x) becomes:\n\nf(x) = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x^4 - 6x\u00b2 + 9)\n= x\u00b2 + (1/2)x^4 - 3x\u00b2 + 9/2\n= (1/2)x^4 + (x\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2) + 9/2\n= (1/2)x^4 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nSo, f(x) = (1/2)x^4 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nNow, I need to find the minimum of this function. To find the minima, I can take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x and set it equal to zero. Then"

Since the function f(x) is a quartic with positive leading coefficient, it tends to infinity as x approaches both positive and negative infinity. So, we can expect that the function has a global minimum somewhere.\n\nLet me compute the second derivative to check concavity.\n\nFirst, f''(x) is derivative of f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x\nf''(x) = 6x^2 - 4.\n\nEvaluate f''(x) at the critical points:\n\nAt x = 0:\n\nf''(0) = 0 - 4 = -4.\n\nSince f''(0) < 0, this point is a local maximum.\n\nAt x = \u221a2:\n\nf''(\u221a2) = 6*(\u221a2)^2 - 4 = 6*2 -4 = 12 -4 = 8 > 0. So, it's a local minimum.\n\nSimilarly, at x = -\u221a2:\n\nf''(-\u221a2) = same as above, since x is squared, so 8 > 0. So, x = -\u221a2 is also a local minimum.\n\nSo, the function has two minima at x = \u221a2 and x = -\u221a2 and a local maximum at x = 0.\n\nTherefore, the distance is minimized at x = \u221a2 and x = -\u221a2.\n\nNow, let's compute y at x = \u221a2:\n\ny = (1/\u221a2)( (\u221a2)^2 - 3 ) = (1/\u221a2)(2 -3) = (1/\u221a2)(-1"

At x = \u221a2, x\u00b2 = 2, so y = (2 - 3)/\u221a2 = (-1)/\u221a2, same for x = -\u221a2.\n\nSo, the points are (\u221a2, -1/\u221a2) and (-\u221a2, -1/\u221a2). But since the distance to the origin is the same regardless of the x sign, both points will have the same distance.\n\nNow, compute the distance from the origin for either of these points. Let's take (\u221a2, -1/\u221a2).\n\nDistance squared, which is f(\u221a2):\n\nf(\u221a2) = (1/2)(\u221a2)^4 - 2*(\u221a2)^2 + 9/2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(\u221a2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4, so (1/2)*4 = 2.\n\n(\u221a2)^2 = 2, so -2*2 = -4.\n\nAdding up: 2 - 4 + 9/2 = (-2) + 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nBut let's compute it step by step.\n\nWait, hold on.

Wait, sqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(10)/2 because sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(10)/2. \n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nsqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) = sqrt(10)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2. \n\nBut the problem states that the minimal distance can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers with a square-free. Here, sqrt(10)/2 is already in that form, since 10 is square-free (its prime factors are 2 and 5, neither of which is squared). So, a is 10 and b is 2. Therefore, a + b = 12.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me confirm again. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the function f(x) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, with y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). So substituting gives:\n\nf(x) = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)^2. Then expanding (x\u00b2 - 3)^2 gives x^4 -6x\u00b2 +9, so multiplying by 1/2 gives (1/2)x^4 -3x\u00b2 + 9/2. Adding the x\u00b2 term gives (1/2)x^4 -2x\u00b2 + 9/2. That's correct.\n\nTaking derivative: 2x^3 -4x. Setting to zero gives 2x(x\u00b2 -2)=0, so critical points at x=0, x=\u221a2, x=-\u221a2. Then second derivative at x=\u221a2 is 6*(2) -4 = 12-4=8>0, so minima. \n\nThen, plugging x=\u221a2 into"

So distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2, since 5/2 times 2/2 is 10/4, sqrt(10/4) is sqrt(10)/2.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So a=10, b=2, a+b=12.\n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. Let me see if there are any alternative methods to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using parametric equations. Wait, but this would complicate. Alternatively, maybe using Lagrange multipliers, but that's more involved, and since the substitution seems straightforward, perhaps that's not necessary.\n\nWait, let me see.
