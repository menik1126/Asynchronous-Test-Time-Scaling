I remember that for polynomials with integer coefficients, the Rational Root Theorem can be helpful. Let me recall how that works.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the leading coefficient is 1, so the denominator \\(q\\) can only be \\(\\pm1\\). That means all possible rational roots are integers that are factors of the constant term, which is -14.\n\nSo, let me list all the factors of -14. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, 14, and their negatives: -1, -2, -7, -14. Therefore, the possible integer roots are: \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), \\(\\pm14\\).\n\nNow, I need to test each of these possible roots in the equation to see if they satisfy it, meaning when I substitute \\(x\\) with the value, the equation equals zero.\n\nLet me start with \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1 + 5) + (9 - 1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0\\).\nOh, cool! So, \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n\nNext, let's try \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) -14\\).\nCalculating each term:\n\\((-1)^4 = 1\\),\n\\(5(-1)^3 = -5\\),\n\\(9(-1)^2 = 9\\),\n\\(-(-1) = 1\\),\nConstant term: -14.\nAdding them up: 1 -5 +9 +1 -14 = (1 -5"

Definitely not zero.\n\nNext, \\(x = -2\\):\n\\((-2)^4 +5(-2)^3 +9(-2)^2 -(-2) -14\\).\nCompute:\n\\((-2)^4=16\\),\n\\(5*(-8)=-40\\),\n\\(9*4=36\\),\n\\(-(-2)=2\\),\nConstant term -14.\nAdding up: 16 -40 +36 +2 -14 = (16 -40) + (36 +2) -14 = (-24) +38 -14 = 14 -14=0.\nOh, \\(x = -2\\) is another root. Great.\n\nLet's test \\(x=7\\):\n\\(7^4 +5(7)^3 +9(7)^2 -7 -14\\).\nCalculating each term:\n\\(7^4 = 2401\\),\n\\(5*343=1715\\),\n\\(9*49=441\\),\n-7 is -7,\n-14.\nAdding them: 2401 + 1715 is 4116; 4116 +441 is 4557; 4557 -7 is 4550; 4550 -14 is 4536. That's way bigger than zero, so \\(x=7\\) isn't a root.\n\nHow about \\(x=-7\\):\n\\((-7)^4 +5(-7)^3 +9(-7)^2 -(-7) -14\\).\nCompute:\n\\((-7)^4=2401\\),\n\\(5*(-343)=-1715\\),\n\\(9*49=441\\),\n\\(-(-7)=7\\),\nConstant"

Let me plug it in:\n\\(14^4 +5(14)^3 +9(14)^2 -14 -14\\).\nCalculating each term:\n14^4 = 14*14=196; 196*14=2744; 2744*14=38416. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me compute 14^4 correctly. 14^2 is 196; 14^3 is 196*14=2744; 14^4 is 2744*14, which is 38416.\n\n5*14^3 is 5*2744=13720.\n\n9*14^2=9*196=1764.\n\nSo adding them up:\n\n38416 +13720 = 52136,\n52136 +1764=53900,\nThen subtract 14 and 14: 53900 -28=53872. Definitely not zero, so \\(x=14\\) is not a root.\n\nSimilarly, \\(x=-14\\) would be even bigger in magnitude, so let's skip that.\n\nWait, but did I test all possible integer roots? The possible ones are \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), \\(\\pm14\\). I think I did all. So, among them, \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\) satisfy the equation. So, these are the integer roots.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, perhaps I should factor out these roots and see what remains.\n\nGiven that \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\) are roots, then the polynomial can be factored as \\((x -1)(x +2)\\) times a quadratic. Let me perform the polynomial division to see.\n\nLet me factor out \\((x -1)\\) first. Dividing \\(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\\) by \\(x -1\\).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nWrite down the coefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 ("

Add to -14:0. So, the quotient is \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\).\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as \\((x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14)\\). Now, factor the cubic.\n\nNow, check if the cubic \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\) has any integer roots. Using the same method, possible roots are factors of 14: \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), \\(\\pm14\\).\n\nTesting x=-2: Compute \\( (-2)^3 +6(-2)^2 +15(-2) +14 = -8 +24 -30 +14 = (-8 -30) + (24 +14) = -38 +38=0. So, x=-2 is a root again.\n\nSo, factor out (x +2) from the cubic.\n\nAgain, using synthetic division:\n\nCubic coefficients:1,6,15,14. Using root x=-2.\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by -2: -2. Add to 6:4. Multiply by -2: -8. Add to 15:7. Multiply by -2: -14. Add to14:0. So, the quotient is x^2 +4x +7.\n\nThus, the original polynomial factors as (x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero. The quadratic is \\(x^2 +4x +7=0\\). The discriminant is \\(16 -28 = -12 <0\\), so no real roots, let alone integer ones.\n\nTherefore, the only integer roots are 1 and -2.\n</think>\n\nThe integer roots of the equation are found by testing possible candidates from the Rational Root Theorem. Substituting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\) satisfies the equation, while the other candidates do not. Factoring the polynomial confirms that these are the only"
