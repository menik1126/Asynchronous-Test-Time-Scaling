The line is parameterized, and from the Asymptote code provided, I can get some points on the line. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). This means that for every increase of 1 in the \\( x \\)-direction, the \\( y \\)-direction changes by \\( b \\). So, the slope of the line is \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\).\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, it defines two points \\( A = (-5,4) \\) and \\( B = (-1,3) \\). It also mentions points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), which are extensions of the line \\( AB \\) to meet the axes. Specifically, \\( L \\) is where the line intersects \\( x = -8 \\), and \\( R \\) is where it intersects \\( x = 8 \\). The line is drawn from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\) in red.\n\nSince the direction vector is given, and considering the slope is \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\), I can also compute the slope from the points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Let me calculate that first.\n\nThe slope between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is \\( \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} = \\frac{-1}{4} \\). So, the slope is \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nSince the slope is equal to \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\), I can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\( -\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{b}{-7} \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( b \\), I can cross-multiply:\n\n\\( -1 \\times (-7) = 4 \\times b \\)\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n\\( 7 = 4b \\)\n\nSo, \\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Setting these equal: \\( -1/4 = b / (-7) \\). So, multiplying both sides by -7: \\( (-1/4) * (-7) = b \\), which is \\( 7/4 \\). So, yes, \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this using parametric equations. The line passes through points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), so let's write its parametric form. Let me set the parameter \\( t \\) such that when \\( t = 0 \\), we are at point \\( A \\), and when \\( t = 1 \\), we are at point \\( B \\).\n\nSo, the parametric equations would be:\n\n\\( x = x_A + t(x_B - x_A) \\)\n\\( y = y_A + t(y_B - y_A) \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\( x = -5 + t[(-1) - (-5)] = -5 + t(4) \\)\n\\( y = 4 + t[(3) - (4)] = 4 + t(-1) \\)\n\nSo, the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).

That might mean I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the direction vector provided in the problem is correct. The Asymptote code shows the line from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\), which is between points \\( (-8, y_L) \\) and \\( (8, y_R) \\). The direction vector is determined by the slope between \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), not between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nWait, that might be the case.

But actually, the line is the same line through points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), so the direction vector should be consistent with the direction from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\).\n\nWait, but in my first calculation, I found the slope between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is -1/4, so the direction vector between them is (4, -1). But the problem says the direction vector is (-7, b). Since direction vectors can be scaled, maybe they just want a direction vector in the same direction but scaled by some factor. So, the direction vector (4, -1) can be scaled by any non-zero scalar. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the direction vector is given as (-7, b). So, we need to find a scalar \\( k \\) such that:\n\n\\( 4 \\times k = -7 \\)\n\\( -1 \\times k = b \\)\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\( k = -7 / 4 \\)\n\nThen, substituting into the second equation:\n\n\\( b = -1 \\times (-7/4) = 7/4 \\)\n\nSo that gives the same result as before. So, \\( b = 7/4 \\). Therefore, the answer should be 7/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the equation of the line through points A and B, then find its slope, which would be the same as the direction vector's slope.\n\nThe line through A(-5,4) and B(-1,3):\n\nSlope \\( m = (3 - 4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4 \\). So, the slope is -1/4. The direction vector is (run, rise) which would be (4, -1). But the problem's direction vector is (-7, b). Since direction vectors can be scaled, the direction vector must be a scalar multiple of (4, -1). So, if we have (-7, b) = k*(4, -1), then:\n\n-7 = 4k => k = -7/4\n\nThen, b = -1 * k = -1*(-7/4) = 7/4. So that's the same answer again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the direction vector from L to R? Let me see. Let me compute points L"

So, \u0394y = slope * \u0394x = (-1/4)*(-3) = 3/4.\n\nSo, point L is at (-8, 4 + 3/4) = (-8, 19/4).\n\nSimilarly, starting from point A(-5,4), going to x = 8, which is a change of \u0394x = 8 - (-5) = 13. So, \u0394y = (-1/4)*13 = -13/4.\n\nSo, point R would be at (8,4 - 13/4) = (8, (16/4 -13/4)) = (8, 3/4).\n\nTherefore, the line goes from L(-8, 19/4) to R(8, 3/4). So, the direction vector from L to R is (8 - (-8), 3/4 - 19/4) = (16, -16/4) = (16, -4). But wait, that can't be right because the direction vector is given as (-7, b). Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me compute the direction vector from L to R. From L(-8, 19/4) to R(8, 3/4), the change in x is 16, and change in y is (3/4 - 19/4) = (-16/4) = -4. So, the direction vector is (16, -4), which can be simplified by dividing by 4 to (4, -1). Which matches our earlier result.\n\nBut the problem says the direction vector is (-7, b). So, (-7, b) must be a scalar multiple of (4, -1). So, we can write:\n\n-7 = 4k\nb = -1 * k\n\nSolving for k, k = -7/4, then b = -1"

So, \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nAlternatively, let me check the direction vector from A to B: (4, -1), which we can write as direction vector. Then, from L to R: (16, -4), which is 4 times (4, -1). So, the direction vector is scaled by a factor of 4. But the problem gives a different direction vector (-7, b). So, we need to scale (4, -1) by some factor so that it becomes (-7, b).\n\nLet me denote the scaling factor as k.\n\nSo, 4k = -7 => k = -7/4\n\nThen, -1 * k = b => b = -1*(-7/4) = 7/4.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, \\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the parametric equations of the line using points L and R and see if the direction vector is the same.\n\nFrom point L(-8, 19/4) to R(8, 3/4), the direction vector is (16, -4), as I found earlier, which is same as (4, -1) after scaling by 4. So, same conclusion.\n\nAnother approach: compute the slope of the line using points L and R.\n\nSlope \\( m = (3/4 - 19/4)/(8 - (-8)) = (-16/4)/16 = (-4)/16 = -1/4 \\). Same as before, so slope is -1/4. So, the direction vector is (1, m) or (1, -1/4), but the problem gives a direction vector (-7, b). So, let's see if (-7, b) is a multiple of (1, -1/4).\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\n(-7, b) = k*(1, -1/4)\n\nSo,\n\n-7 = k*1 => k = -7\n\nThen,\n\nb = (-1/4)*k = (-1/4)*(-7) = 7/4\n\nSo again, \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nTherefore, after multiple methods, I keep getting \\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\).

The difference is ( (-1) - (-5), 3 - 4 ) = (4, -1). So direction vector (4, -1). The problem's direction vector is (-7, b). So, to get from (4, -1) to (-7, b), we need to scale by a factor that makes 4k = -7, so k = -7/4. Then, the y-component is -1 * (-7/4) = 7/4. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of direction vectors, they can be in any direction, so even if the direction vector is given as (-7, b), it's still a scalar multiple of the original direction vector (4, -1). So, the ratio between the components must be the same. So, the ratio of the y-component to x-component in the direction vector must be equal to the slope.\n\nSo, for the given direction vector (-7, b), the slope is b / (-7). The slope of the line is -1/4, so:\n\nb / (-7) = -1/4\n\nMultiply both sides by -7:\n\nb = (-1/4)*(-7) = 7/4.\n\nSame result.
