            "output": "Alright, so I've got this equation to solve: \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\). Hmm, it looks like a cubic equation, which can be tricky, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it. \n\nFirst, I remember that there's an identity for the sum of cubes: \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\). Maybe I can apply that here. Let me let \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). Then the left side becomes \\((a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\).\n\nCalculating \\(a + b\\): that's \\((x - 3) + (x - 7)\\), which simplifies to \\(2x - 10\\). Oh, wait a minute! The right side of the equation is also \\( (2x - 10)^3 \\). So, the equation now looks like:\n\n\\[\n(2x - 10)( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 ) = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, interesting. If I let \\(y = 2x - 10\\), then the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\ny \\cdot [ (x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 ] = y^3\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\(y \\neq 0\\), I can divide both sides by \\(y\\), which gives:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 = y^2\n\\]\n\nBut since \\(y = 2x - 10\\), this becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 = (2x - 10)^2\n\\]\n\nLet me expand each term step by step. First, expand the left side:\n\n1. Expand \\((x - 3)^2\\): \\(x^2 - 6x + 9\\).\n2. Expand \\"

Expand \\((x - 7)^2\\): \\(x^2 - 14x + 49\\).\n\nNow, substitute these back into the left side:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49)\n\\]\n\nLet me distribute the negative sign into the second term:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 10x - 21 + x^2 - 14x + 49\n\\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n- \\(x^2 - x^2 + x^2 = x^2\\)\n- \\(-6x + 10x -14x = (-6 -14 +10)x = (-20 +10)x = -10x\\)\n- \\(9 -21 +49 = (9 +49) -21 = 58 -21 = 37\\)\n\nSo, the left side simplifies to \\(x^2 -10x + 37\\).\n\nNow, let me look at the right side: \\((2x -10)^2\\). Expanding that gives \\(4x^2 -40x +100\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^2 -10x + 37 = 4x^2 -40x +100\n\\]\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\nx^2 -10x +37 -4x^2 +40x -100 =0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(x^2 -4x^2 = -3x^2\\)\n- \\(-10x +40x = 30x\\)\n- \\(37 -100 = -63\\)\n\nSo, the equation is now:\n\n\\[\n-3x^2 +30x -63 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, to make it easier, I can multiply both sides by \\(-1\\):\n\n\\[\n3x^2 -30x +63 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify by dividing all terms by 3:\n\n\\[\nx^2 -10x +21 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, I can"

Those numbers would be -3 and -7 because (-3)(-7)=21 and (-3)+(-7)= -10.\n\nSo, the equation factors as:\n\n\\[\n(x -3)(x -7) = 0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the solutions are \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x =7\\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if these solutions satisfy the original equation, just to be sure.
