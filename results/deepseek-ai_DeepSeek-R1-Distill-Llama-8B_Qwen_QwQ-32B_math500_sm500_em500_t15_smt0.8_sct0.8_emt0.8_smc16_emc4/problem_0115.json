I'll repeat this process by taking the quotient and dividing it by 8 until the quotient becomes zero.\n\nFinally, I'll arrange the remainders from last to first to get the binary number in base 8.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\( 10101001110_2 \\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Binary to Decimal Conversion:**\n   \n   Each digit in the binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit (which represents \\( 2^0 \\)).\n\n2. **Calculate the Decimal Equivalent:**\n   \n   \\[\n   10101001110_2 = 1 \\times 2^10 + 0 \\times 2^9 + 1 \\times 2^8 + 0 \\times 2^7 + 1 \\times 2^6 + 0 \\times 2^5 + 0 \\times 2^4 + 1 \\times 2^3 + 1 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   = 1024 + 0 + 256 + 0 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 1406_{10}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Base Eight:**\n   \n   Divide the decimal number by 8 and record the quotient and remainder. Repeat until the quotient is zero.\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1406 \\div 8 &= 175 \\text{ remainder } 2 \\\\\n   175 \\div 8 &= 21 \\text{ remainder } 7 \\\\\n   21 \\div 8 &= 2 \\text{ remainder } 5 \\\\\n   2 \\div 8 &= 0 \\text{ remainder } 2 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n"
