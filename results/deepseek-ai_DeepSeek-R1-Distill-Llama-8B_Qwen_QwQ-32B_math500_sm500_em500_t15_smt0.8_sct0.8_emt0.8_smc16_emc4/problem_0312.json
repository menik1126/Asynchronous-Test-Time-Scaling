Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero but the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I should factor the denominator to find those values. The denominator is x² - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring that.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, possible factors of -14 are (1, -14), (-1, 14), (2, -7), (-2, 7). Let's see, 2 and -7 add up to -5. So, I can factor the denominator as (x + 2)(x - 7). \n\nSo, f(x) = (2x)/[(x + 2)(x - 7)]. Now, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, so x + 2 = 0 gives x = -2, and x - 7 = 0 gives x = 7. So, a = -2 and b = 7. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNext, horizontal asymptotes. I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher by one, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0.\n\nWait, is that always the case? Let me double-check. When the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is indeed y = 0. But if they are equal, then it's the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote but maybe an oblique one. So yeah, in this case, since degree of denominator is higher, y = 0 is the horizontal asymptote. So, c is 0.\n\nNow, the question asks for a + b + c, which is (-2) + 7 + 0. Let's compute that: (-2) +"

            "output": " 7 is 5, and then 5 + 0 is 5. So, the sum is 5.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. I factored the denominator correctly, right? x² -5x -14. Let me check by expanding (x + 2)(x - 7): x² - 7x + 2x -14 = x² -5x -14. Yup, that's correct.\n\nSo, vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x =7, and horizontal asymptote at y=0. So, adding them up: (-2) +7=5, and 5 +0=5. I think that's correct.\n\nI don't think there's any other horizontal asymptote or vertical asymptote I'm missing. Maybe I should also consider if any points make the numerator zero, but that would be just x=0, which doesn't affect vertical asymptotes. So, yeah, I think my calculations are correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the vertical asymptotes and horizontal asymptote of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   The denominator \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\) can be factored into \\( (x + 2)(x - 7) \\).\n\n2. **Find Vertical Asymptotes:**\n   The vertical asymptotes occur at the zeros of the denominator, provided they do not also make the numerator zero.\n   - Setting \\( x + 2 = 0 \\) gives \\( x = -2 \\).\n   - Setting \\( x - 7 = 0 \\) gives \\( x = 7 \\).\n   Thus, the vertical asymptotes are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n\n3. **Determine Horizontal Asymptote:**\n   For the rational function \\( \\frac{\\text{degree 1}}{\\text{degree 2}} \\), the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Sum the Values:**\n   - Vertical asymptotes: \\( a = -2 \\), \\( b = 7 \\)\n   - Horizontal asymptote: \\( c = 0 \\)\n   - Sum: \\( a + b + c = (-2)"
