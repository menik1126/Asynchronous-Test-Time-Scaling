I need to find the maximum value that the greatest common divisor of \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) can take, given that \\( n \\) is a positive integer. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\) is the largest number that divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). In this case, \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\).\n\nOne method I recall for finding the gcd of two numbers is the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me recall how the Euclidean algorithm works. It involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then taking the remainder and repeating the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.\n\nSo, let me try that. Let me write down the two expressions:\n\n\\( a = n + 7 \\)\n\n\\( b = 2n + 1 \\)\n\nI need to compute \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\). Since \\( b = 2n + 1 \\) seems larger than \\( a = n + 7 \\) for positive \\( n \\), I can try applying the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nFirst, I'll express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\). Let me compute \\( b - 2a \\):\n\n\\( b - 2a = (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) \\)\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n\\( 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = (2n - 2n) + (1 - 14) = 0 - 13 = -13 \\)\n\nSo, \\( b - 2a = -13 \\). But in the Euclidean algorithm, the remainder should be positive, so maybe I can take the absolute value, which would be 13. So, this tells me that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, |b - 2a|)"

Now, this simplifies the problem because the gcd can now be either 1 or 13, depending on whether \\( n + 7 \\) is divisible by 13 or not.\n\nSo, the greatest possible value of this gcd is 13. But wait, hold on. Let me verify if that's achievable. If 13 divides \\( n + 7 \\), then there exists some positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n + 7 = 13k \\). Then, substituting back into \\( 2n + 1 \\):\n\n\\( 2n + 1 = 2(13k - 7) + 1 = 26k - 14 + 1 = 26k - 13 = 13(2k - 1) \\)\n\nSo, \\( 2n + 1 \\) is also divisible by 13 when \\( n + 7 \\) is divisible by 13. Therefore, the gcd is indeed 13 when \\( n + 7 \\) is a multiple of 13. Let me check with a specific value to make sure.\n\nLet’s choose \\( k = 1 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 13 \\times 1 = 13 \\) implies \\( n = 6 \\). Then, compute \\( 2n + 1 = 2 \\times 6 + 1 = 13 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\), which works.\n\nAnother example: let \\( k = 2 \\). Then, \\( n = 13 \\times 2 - 7 = 26 - 7 = 19 \\). Then, \\( 2n + 1 = 2 \\times 19 + 1 = 39 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(26, 39) \\). 26 factors are 1, 2, 13, 26; 39 factors are 1, 3, 13, 39. So, gcd is 13. That also works.\n\nTherefore, it seems that 13 is achievable, and since 13 is a prime number, the gcd can't be higher than 13. So, the"

Then, \\( d \\) divides \\( (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) \\), which we already found is \\( -13 \\). Therefore, \\( d \\) must divide 13. Since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the gcd can't be more than 13. Thus, 13 is indeed the maximum possible value.\n\nSo, I think I have reasoned through it correctly. The key was to apply the Euclidean algorithm to reduce the problem and find that the gcd is equivalent to the gcd of \\( n + 7 \\) and 13. Since 13 is prime, the maximum possible gcd is 13, and it's achievable when \\( n + 7 \\) is a multiple of 13.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is \\( 13 \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Problem:**\n   We need to find the maximum value of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two linear expressions in terms of a positive integer \\( n \\): specifically, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   The Euclidean algorithm is a systematic method to compute the gcd of two numbers. It involves dividing the larger number by the smaller and then taking the remainder, repeating the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.\n\n3. **Express \\( 2n + 1 \\) in Terms of \\( n + 7 \\):**\n   Let \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\).\n   Compute \\( b - 2a \\):\n   \\[\n   b - 2a = (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13\n   \\]\n   So, \\( b - 2a = -13 \\).

Since 13 is a prime number, its only positive divisors are 1 and 13.\n\n6. **Check for Maximum Value:**\n   To achieve a gcd of 13, \\( n + 7 \\) must be a multiple of 13. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   n + 7 = 13k \\quad \\text{for some positive integer } k\n   \\]\n   Substituting back, \\( 2n + 1 \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   2(13k - 7) + 1 = 26k - 14 + 1 = 26k - 13 = 13(2k - 1)\n   \\]\n   Thus, both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13, confirming that the gcd is indeed 13.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   The greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is 13, as it is achievable with appropriate values of \\( n \\) (e.g., \\( n = 6 \\) or \\( n = 19 \\)) and cannot be higher due to the prime nature of 13.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe greatest possible value is \\boxed{13}."
