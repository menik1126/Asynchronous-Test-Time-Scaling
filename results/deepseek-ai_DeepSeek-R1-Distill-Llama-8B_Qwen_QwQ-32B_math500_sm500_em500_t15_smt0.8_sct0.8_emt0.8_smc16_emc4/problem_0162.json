            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst off, cube roots. I remember that if you have the cube root of something equals a number, you can get rid of the cube root by cubing both sides. So, maybe I should start by doing that here. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, the equation is: \u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16.\n\nIf I cube both sides, that should eliminate the cube root. On the left side, cubing the cube root just gives me whatever is inside, right? So, that becomes x\u00b2 - 4x + 4. On the right side, I cube 16. Hmm, what is 16 cubed? Let me calculate that.\n\n16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... wait, let me do that correctly. 256 * 16. 256 * 10 is 2560, and 256 * 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 is 4096. So, 16 cubed is 4096.\n\nSo now, the equation is simplified to x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096. Okay, that seems more manageable. Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it so that it equals zero, which is the standard form.\n\nSubtracting 4096 from both sides gives me: x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Let me compute 4 - 4096. That's -4092. So, the equation becomes x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nWow, okay, that looks like a big quadratic. I wonder if I can factor this, but the numbers seem way too large. Probably not. So maybe I need to use the quadratic formula. Let me recall the quadratic formula. It's x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all over 2a.\n\nIn this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Let me plug those into the formula.\n\nSo, discriminant first: b squared is (-"

            "output": "4) squared, which is 16. Then, 4ac is 4 times 1 times (-4092). Let me calculate that. 4 * (-4092) is -16368. So, the discriminant is 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding, so 16 + 16368 is 16384.\n\nOkay, so the square root of 16384. Hmm, do I know what that is? Let me think. 128 squared is 16384 because 128 * 128. Let's check: 100*100=10000, 110*110=12100, 120*120=14400, 130*130=16900. So, 128 is between 120 and 130. Let me calculate 128*128:\n\n128 * 100 = 12800,\n128 * 20 = 2560,\n128 * 8 = 1024.\nAdding those together: 12800 + 2560 = 15360; 15360 + 1024 = 16384. Yes, that's right. So, sqrt(16384) is 128.\n\nSo, substituting back into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(D)] / (2a)\n= [ -(-4) \u00b1 128 ] / (2*1)\n= [4 \u00b1 128] / 2.\n\nSo, that gives me two solutions.\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66.\nSecond solution: (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62.\n\nOkay, so the two solutions are x = 66 and x = -62. But the question asks for the positive value of x, so that's 66.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if these solutions actually satisfy the original equation. It's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, especially with big numbers.\n\nLet's test x = 66. Plugging into the original equation: cube root of (66\u00b2 - 4*66 + 4).\n\nCompute 66 squared: 66*66. 60*60=3600, 60*6=360, 6*60=360, 6*6=36. So 3600 + 360 + 360 + 36 = 4356.\n\nThen, 4*66 is 264.

            "output": ", 66\u00b2 -4*66 +4 is 4356 - 264 +4. Let's compute 4356 - 264 first. 4356 - 200 is 4156, 4156 - 64 is 4092. Then, add 4: 4096.\n\nSo, cube root of 4096. Now, 16 cubed is 4096, so cube root of 4096 is 16. Which matches the original equation. Perfect.\n\nNow, let's test x = -62. Cube root of ((-62)^2 -4*(-62) +4).\n\nCompute (-62)^2: that's 3844. \n\nThen, -4*(-62) is +248. So, 3844 + 248 +4.\n\n3844 + 248: 3844 + 200 = 4044, 4044 + 48 = 4092. Then, plus 4 is 4096. So, cube root of 4096 is 16, which again matches.\n\nWait a minute, both solutions satisfy the equation? How come? So even though the original equation is a cube root, which is a function, and cube roots are defined for all real numbers, so both positive and negative x can result in the cube root being 16.\n\nSo, actually, both x=66 and x=-62 are valid solutions. But the question asks for the positive value, so 66 is the answer. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let's think again. The quadratic came out of cubing both sides, so any solution to the quadratic would satisfy the original equation as long as the cube root operation is defined. Since cube roots are defined for all real numbers, both positive and negative solutions are acceptable here. So yes, both are valid.\n\nBut just to recap:\n\n1. Original equation: \u221b(x\u00b2 -4x +4) = 16\n2. Cube both sides: x\u00b2 -4x +4 = 4096\n3. Rearranged: x\u00b2 -4x -4092 = 0\n4. Quadratic formula: solutions x=66 and x=-62\n5. Both satisfy the original equation.\n\nSo, the positive solution is 66. That's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16"
