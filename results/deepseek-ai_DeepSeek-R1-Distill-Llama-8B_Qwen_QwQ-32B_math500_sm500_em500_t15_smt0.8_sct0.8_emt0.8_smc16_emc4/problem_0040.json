Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. \n\nNext, 142 is also even, so dividing by 2 again yields 71. \n\nNow, I check if 71 is a prime number. It doesn't have any divisors other than 1 and itself, so 71 is prime.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71\u00b9.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (1 + p + p\u00b2 + ... + p^k) for each prime power p^k, I can calculate the sum of all divisors of 284.\n\nFor 2\u00b2, the sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\nFor 71\u00b9, the sum is 1 + 71 = 72.\n\nMultiplying these together gives the sum of all divisors: 7 \u00d7 72 = 504.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors except the number itself, so I subtract 284 from the total sum of divisors.\n\n504 - 284 = 220.\n\nThus, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n\nFinally, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220.\n\nI'll start by factoring 220 into its prime factors. \n\n220 is divisible by 2, so dividing by 2 gives 110.\n\n110 is also divisible by 2, resulting in 55.\n\n55 ends with a 5, so dividing by 5 gives 11.\n\n11 is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 220 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b9 \u00d7 11\u00b9.\n\nApplying the sum of divisors formula again:\n\nFor 2\u00b2: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\nFor 5\u00b9: 1 + 5 = 6.\n\nFor 11\u00b9: 1 + 11 = 12.\n\nMultiplying these together gives the total sum of divisors: 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 12 = 504.\n\nNow, subtract 220 to find the sum of proper divisors: 504 -"
