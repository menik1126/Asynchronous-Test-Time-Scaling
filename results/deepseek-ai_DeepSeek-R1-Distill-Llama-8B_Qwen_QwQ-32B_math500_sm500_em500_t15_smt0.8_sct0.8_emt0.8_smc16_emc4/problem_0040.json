Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number that are less than the number itself.\n\nI'll start by factoring 284 to determine its prime components. \n\n284 divided by 2 is 142.\n\n142 divided by 2 is 71.\n\n71 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71 to the first power: \\(2^2 \\times 71^1\\).\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \\((1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^k)\\) for each prime \\(p\\) raised to the power \\(k\\) in the factorization, I'll calculate the sum of all divisors of 284.\n\nFor the prime 2 with exponent 2: \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\).\n\nFor the prime 71 with exponent 1: \\(1 + 71 = 72\\).\n\nMultiplying these together: \\(7 \\times 72 = 504\\).\n\nSince the problem asks for the sum of proper divisors, I'll subtract 284 from 504: \\(504 - 284 = 220\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220.\n\nI'll begin by factoring 220.\n\n220 divided by 2 is 110.\n\n110 divided by 2 is 55.\n\n55 divided by 5 is 11.\n\n11 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 220 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^1 \\times 11^1\\).\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again:\n\nFor 2 with exponent 2: \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\).\n\nFor 5 with exponent 1: \\(1 + 5 = 6\\).\n\nFor 11 with exponent 1: \\(1 + 11 = 12\\).\n\nMultiplying these together: \\(7 \\times 6 \\times 12 = 504\\).\n\nTo find the sum of proper divisors, I'll subtract 220 from 504: \\(504 - 220 = 284\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 284.\n</think>\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n**Problem:**  \nWe need to find the sum"
