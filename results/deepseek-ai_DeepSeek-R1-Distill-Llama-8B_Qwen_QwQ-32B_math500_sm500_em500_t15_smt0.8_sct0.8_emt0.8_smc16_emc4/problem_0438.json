            "output": "To find the modulo 7 remainder of the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 199, I first need to determine how many terms are in this sequence. The sequence is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n\nBy plugging in the known values, a_n = 1 + (n - 1) * 2. Setting a_n equal to 199 gives the equation 199 = 1 + (n - 1) * 2. Solving for n, I find that there are 100 terms in this sequence.\n\nNext, I'll compute the sum of these 100 terms using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n). Plugging in the values, S_100 = 100/2 * (1 + 199) = 50 * 200 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I'll divide 10,000 by 7. Performing the division, 7 goes into 10,000 a total of 1,428 times with a remainder of 4. Therefore, the modulo 7 remainder of the sum is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the remainder when the sum of the sequence of odd numbers from 1 to 199 is divided by 7, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Sequence\nThe sequence given is:\n\\[ 1, \\, 3, \\, 5, \\, 7, \\, 9, \\, \\ldots, \\, 197, \\, 199 \\]\nThis is an **arithmetic sequence** where:\n- The **first term (a\u2081)** is 1.\n- The **common difference (d)** is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Terms\nThe **n**-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\]\nSet \\( a_n = 199 \\):\n\\[ 199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times "
