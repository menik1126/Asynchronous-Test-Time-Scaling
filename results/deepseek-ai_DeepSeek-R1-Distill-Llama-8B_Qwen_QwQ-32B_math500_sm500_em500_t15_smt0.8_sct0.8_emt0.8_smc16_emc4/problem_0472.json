            "output": "Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have three variables x, y, and z that satisfy these three equations:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nAnd we need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\). Hmm, okay. Let me jot down what I know and see how I can connect these equations.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with symmetric equations involving three variables, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric sums or Vieta's formulas. Maybe if I can express everything in terms of elementary symmetric sums, things might simplify.\n\nThe elementary symmetric sums for three variables are:\n\n- \\( s = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( p = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( t = xyz \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, I see that \\( xyz = 4 \\), so \\( t = 4 \\). That's straightforward.\n\nLooking at the second equation, \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). I recall that the sum of cubes can be expressed in terms of s, p, and t. The formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s^3 - 3s p + 3t \\)\n\nSo, plugging in the values we have:\n\n\\( 4 = s^3 - 3s p + 3*4 \\)\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( 4 = s^3 - 3s p + 12 \\)\nHmm, let's subtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\( 4 - 12 = s^3 - 3s p \\)\n\\( -8 = s^3 - 3s p \\)\nLet me write that as:\n\n\\( s^3 - 3s p = -8 \\)  (Equation A)\n\nNow, moving on to the third equation: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\). This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of s, p"

Let me see if I can express this in terms of s, p, and t.\n\nEach of these terms involves two variables multiplied by their sum. So:\n\n- \\( xy(x + y) \\) can be \\( xy(x + y) \\)\n- Similarly for the others.\n\nWait, notice that \\( x + y + z = s \\), so:\n\n\\( x + y = s - z \\)\n\\( x + z = s - y \\)\n\\( y + z = s - x \\)\n\nSo substituting back, the third equation becomes:\n\n\\( xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = 12 \\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\n- \\( xy(s - z) = s xy - xy z \\)\n- \\( xz(s - y) = s xz - x z y \\)\n- \\( yz(s - x) = s yz - y z x \\)\n\nAdding all these together:\n\n\\( s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12 \\)\n\nBecause each term like \\( -xy z \\) appears three times, once for each variable subtracted.\n\nWe know that \\( xy + xz + yz = p \\), and \\( xyz = t = 4 \\). So substituting these:\n\n\\( s p - 3 * 4 = 12 \\)\nSimplify:\n\n\\( s p - 12 = 12 \\)\nSo,\n\n\\( s p = 24 \\)  (Equation B)\n\nNow, we have Equation A: \\( s^3 - 3s p = -8 \\)\nAnd Equation B: \\( s p = 24 \\)\n\nWait, from"

Seems straightforward.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSo, s = 4, p = 6, t = 4.\n\nFrom the second equation, using the formula:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s^3 - 3s p + 3t = 64 - 3*4*6 + 12 \\)\nCompute:\n\n64 - 72 + 12 = (64 + 12) -72 = 76 -72 = 4, which matches the given second equation.\n\nThird equation: we had s p - 12 = 12.
