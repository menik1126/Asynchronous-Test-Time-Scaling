            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O. The ratio of AB to AD is k. A point is randomly chosen inside the rectangle, and I need to find the probability that this point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the rectangle in my mind. Rectangle ABCD, so opposite sides are equal, right? AB is the length, and AD is the width. So AB/AD = k, meaning AB = k * AD. So the rectangle is longer in the AB direction than in the AD direction.\n\nThe center O is the intersection point of the diagonals, so it's the midpoint of both diagonals. Now, I'm supposed to find the probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices.\n\nProbability is generally the ratio of the favorable area to the total area. So, I need to find the area within the rectangle where any point is closer to O than to A, B, C, or D. Then, the probability would be that area divided by the area of the rectangle.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle to make it easier. Since O is the center, I can place it at the origin (0,0). Then, the rectangle's vertices can be defined relative to O. Let me denote the half-length as (AB/2) and the half-width as (AD/2). Since AB = k * AD, let me denote AD as '2a', so AB becomes '2ak'. So, half of AB is 'ak' and half of AD is 'a'.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the vertices would be:\n- A: (-ak, a)\n- B: (ak, a)\n- C: (ak, -a)\n- D: (-ak, -a)\n\nWait, actually, since O is the center, if the rectangle has dimensions 2ak by 2a, then the coordinates would make sense as such. Let me double-check that. If O is at (0,0), then the four vertices should be at (\u00b1ak, \u00b1a), yes. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the distance from any point (x,y) to O is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The distance from (x,y) to each vertex is sqrt[(x - x_vertex)"

So, we need to find all points (x,y) in the rectangle such that sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) \u2264 sqrt[(x - x_V)^2 + (y - y_V)^2] for each vertex V (A,B,C,D). But since the rectangle is symmetric, perhaps we can exploit symmetry to simplify the problem?\n\nAlternatively, the set of points equidistant to O and a vertex form perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex. The region closer to O than any vertex is the intersection of all the regions closer to O than each vertex. So, to find this region, we can find the boundaries where distance to O equals distance to each vertex, then the area inside all those regions.\n\nLet me consider the bisectors between O and each vertex. Since there are four vertices, we can consider one (say, vertex A) and find the bisector, then by symmetry, the other bisectors will be similar.\n\nFirst, let me compute the bisector between O(0,0) and A(-ak, a). The set of points equidistant to O and A is:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt( (x + ak)^2 + (y - a)^2 )\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x + ak)^2 + (y - a)^2\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n= x\u00b2 + 2akx + (ak)^2 + y\u00b2 - 2ay + a\u00b2\n\nSubtract left-hand side from both sides (or rearrange terms):\n\n0 = 2akx + (ak)^2 - 2ay + a\u00b2\n\nSo, 2akx - 2ay + (ak)^2 + a\u00b2 = 0\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nDivide both sides by 2a:\n\nkx - y + [(ak)^2 + a\u00b2]/(2a) = 0\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, actually, starting from:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x + ak)^2 + (y - a)^2\n\nExpanding RHS: x\u00b2 + 2akx + a\u00b2k\u00b2 +"

Wait, no, unless k is 1. Wait, slope of first pair is k, slope of second pair is -k. So, unless k is 1, they are not perpendicular. Hmm, so the figure formed is a parallelogram, but not necessarily a rectangle unless k=1.\n\nWait, but in the case of a square (k=1), then the slopes would be 1 and -1, which are perpendicular, so it would form a diamond (rotated square).
