There are two given exchange rates: 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets.\n\nTo find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, I'll start by finding out how many Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets. Since 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, I can set up a proportion to find the number of Blinkets in 56 Drinkets.\n\nAfter determining the number of Blinkets, I'll use the exchange rate between Trinkets and Blinkets to convert Blinkets to Trinkets. With that, I'll be able to find the value of 56 Drinkets in terms of Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- \\(1 \\text{ Trinket} = 4 \\text{ Blinkets}\\)\n- \\(3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets}\\)\n\n**We need to find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets.**\n\n**Step 1: Find out how many Blinkets are in 56 Drinkets.**\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets}\n\\]\nTo find \\(X\\) Blinkets in 56 Drinkets, set up a proportion:\n\\[\n\\frac{7 \\text{ Drinkets}}{3 \\text{ Blinkets}} = \\frac{56 \\text{ Drinkets}}{X \\text{ Blinkets}}\n\\]\n\\[\n7X = 3 \\times 56\n\\]\n\\[\n7X = 168\n\\]\n\\[\nX = \\frac{168}{7} = 24\n\\]\nSo, 56 Drinkets are equal to 24 Blinkets.\n\n**Step 2: Convert Blinkets to Trinkets.**\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ Trinket} = 4 \\text{ Blinkets}\n\\]\nTo find how many Trinkets are in 24 Blinkets, set up another proportion:\n\\[\n\\frac{4 \\text{ Blinkets}}{1 \\text{ Trinket}} = \\frac{24 \\text{ Blinkets}}{Y \\text{ Trinkets}}\n\\]\n\\[\n4Y"
