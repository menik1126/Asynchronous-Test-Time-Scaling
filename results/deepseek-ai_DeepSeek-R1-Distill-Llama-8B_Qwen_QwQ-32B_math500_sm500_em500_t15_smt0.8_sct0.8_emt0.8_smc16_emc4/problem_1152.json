This means \\((3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\\).\n\nNow, the equation becomes \\(3^{6k} = 3^6\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same and equal to each other, their exponents must be equal. Therefore, \\(6k = 6\\).\n\nFinally, solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 1\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\(k\\) in the equation \\((3^k)^6 = 3^6\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Rule**:\n   \n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   \n   This simplifies the left side of the equation.\n\n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same and both sides of the equation equal \\(3\\), the exponents must be equal:\n   \n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(k\\)**:\n   \n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
