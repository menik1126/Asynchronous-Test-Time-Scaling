            "output": "I need to determine the length of the hallway that the robot travels in 90 seconds.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the robot's speed. It travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. To make the speed easier to work with, I'll convert the time from hours to minutes.\n\n1 kilometer in 2.5 hours is the same as 1000 meters in 150 minutes because 2.5 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour equals 150 minutes.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the robot's speed in meters per minute by dividing the distance by the time: 1000 meters divided by 150 minutes is approximately 6.6667 meters per minute.\n\nNow, I'll find out how many meters the robot travels in 90 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 90 seconds is 1.5 minutes.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the speed by the time: 6.6667 meters per minute multiplied by 1.5 minutes equals 10 meters. Therefore, the hallway is 10 meters long.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n- The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the length of a particular hallway.\n\n**To Find:** \n- Length of the hallway in meters.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Robot's Speed\nFirst, determine the robot's speed.\n\n- **Distance traveled:** 1 kilometer = 1000 meters\n- **Time taken:** 2.5 hours = 2.5 × 60 minutes = 150 minutes\n\n**Speed = Distance ÷ Time**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{150 \\text{ minutes}} \\approx 6.6667 \\text{ meters/minute}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Convert Time to Minutes for the Hallway\nThe time taken to travel the hallway is 90 seconds.\n\n- **Convert seconds to minutes:**  \n  \\( 90 \\text{ seconds} = \\frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \\text{ minutes} \\)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Length of the Hallway\nUsing the speed calculated and the time taken for the hallway.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 6.666"
