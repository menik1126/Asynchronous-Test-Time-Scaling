Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, in this case, I'm looking for the largest number that divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\). Since \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\), it must also divide any linear combination of them. Maybe I can find a combination that simplifies the problem.\n\nLet me try to express \\( d \\) in terms of these numbers. If \\( d \\) divides \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\), then it must also divide \\( 2(n + 7) \\) because multiplying a number by 2 doesn't change its divisors. So, \\( d \\) divides \\( 2(n + 7) \\), which is \\( 2n + 14 \\).\n\nNow, if \\( d \\) divides both \\( 2n + 14 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\), then it must divide the difference between them. Let me subtract \\( (2n + 1) \\) from \\( (2n + 14) \\):\n\n\\( (2n + 14) - (2n + 1) = 13 \\).\n\nSo, \\( d \\) divides 13. Hmm, 13 is a prime number, so the possible divisors are only 1 and 13. Therefore, the greatest possible value of \\( d \\) is 13. But wait, is 13 always achievable? I need to check if there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13 \\).\n\nLet me set \\( d = 13 \\) and see if I can find \\( n \\). If 13 divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2"

Since -7 mod 13 is the same as 6 mod 13 (because 13 - 7 = 6), so \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\).\n2. \\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\) \u21d2 \\( 2n \\equiv -1 \\mod 13 \\) \u21d2 \\( 2n \\equiv 12 \\mod 13 \\).\n\nNow, if \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\), let's plug that into the second equation. \\( 2 * 6 = 12 \\), so \\( 12 + 1 = 13 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\). That works! So, when \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\), both conditions are satisfied.\n\nFor example, let me pick \\( n = 6 \\) (smallest positive integer satisfying \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\)).\n\nThen, \\( n + 7 = 13 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 13 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\), which is exactly what we wanted.\n\nWait a second, let me test another number just to make sure. Let's take \\( n = 19 \\) (which is \\( 6 + 13 \\)).\n\nThen, \\( n + 7 = 26 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 39 \\). The gcd of 26 and 39 is 13, because 26 factors as 2*13 and 39 as 3*13. So, yes, gcd is 13.\n\nSo, it seems like whenever \\( n \\) is congruent to 6 modulo 13, the gcd will be 13. Since 13 is the largest possible divisor (as shown earlier), the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is indeed 13.\n\nJust to recap my steps: I used the property that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference. I subtracted \\(2n + 1\\) from \\(2n + 14\\) to get 13, which told me the gcd"

If \\( d \\) divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), it divides any linear combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n3. **Find Linear Combinations:** Let \\( d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\). Then \\( d \\) must divide:\n   - \\( 2(n + 7) = 2n + 14 \\)\n   - Subtracting \\( (2n + 1) \\) from \\( (2n + 14) \\) gives \\( 13 \\).\n\n4. **Determine Possible Divisors:** Since \\( d \\) divides 13 and 13 is prime, the possible values for \\( d \\) are 1 and 13. The greatest possible value is 13.\n\n5. **Verify 13 is Achievable:**\n   - Set \\( d = 13 \\).\n   - \\( 13 \\) divides \\( n + 7 \\), so \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod{13} \\) \u21d2 \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod{13} \\) \u21d2 \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod{13} \\).\n   - \\( 13 \\) also divides \\( 2n + 1 \\), so \\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod{13} \\) \u21d2 \\( 2n \\equiv -1 \\mod{13} \\) \u21d2 \\( 2n \\equiv 12 \\mod{13} \\) \u21d2 \\( n \\equiv 6"
