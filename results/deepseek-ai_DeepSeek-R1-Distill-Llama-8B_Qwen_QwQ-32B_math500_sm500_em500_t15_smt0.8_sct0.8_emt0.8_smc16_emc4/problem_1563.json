            "output": "To determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, I need to consider the rotational symmetry of the table.\n\nFirst, if there were no people seated, a square table has rotational symmetry in four different ways: 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. However, once people are seated, some of these symmetries may no longer apply.\n\nIf all four sides are identical with 2 people seated on each side, rotating the table by 180° will result in the same arrangement. This means that each unique arrangement is counted four times in total due to the rotational symmetry.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of linear arrangements for the people. There are 8 seats around the table, and each seat can be occupied by any of the 8 people. So, the total number of linear arrangements is 8 factorial, which is 40320.\n\nSince the table has rotational symmetry, I'll divide the total number of linear arrangements by 4 to account for the equivalent rotations. Therefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements is 40320 divided by 4, resulting in 10080.\n\nIn conclusion, there are 10,080 distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotational symmetry.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we must account for the rotational symmetry of the table. Two configurations are considered equivalent if one can be rotated to obtain the other.\n\n1. **Understand Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - A square table has rotational symmetry in four ways: 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n   - However, once people are seated, certain symmetries may not produce a new arrangement. Specifically, a rotation of 180° will map each person to the person directly across the table, resulting in the same seating arrangement.\n\n2. **Calculate Linear Arrangements:**\n   - Without considering rotations, there are 8 seats around the table.\n   - The number of ways to arrange 8 people in 8 seats is \\(8! = 40,\\!320\\).\n\n3. **Account for Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - Since a 180° rotation does not produce a new arrangement, we divide the total number of linear arrangements by"
