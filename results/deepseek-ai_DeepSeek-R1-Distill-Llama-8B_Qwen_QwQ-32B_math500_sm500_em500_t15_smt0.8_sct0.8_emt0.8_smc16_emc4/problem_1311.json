            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this equation: 2/3 equals 4 divided by (x minus 5). Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer. So, the equation is 2/3 = 4/(x-5). Alright, I'm a bit nervous about fractions, but I think I can handle this. Let me try to recall how to solve equations with fractions.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have fractions on both sides, a good strategy is to eliminate the denominators. That usually makes the equation easier to handle. So, how can I do that here? Well, the left side is 2/3, and the right side is 4 divided by (x-5). Maybe I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominators.\n\nCross-multiplication is when you multiply the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other fraction. So, in this case, that would mean multiplying 2 by (x - 5) and setting that equal to 3 times 4. Let me write that out: 2*(x - 5) = 3*4. Okay, that seems manageable.\n\nLet me compute the right side first. 3 times 4 is 12. So now the equation is 2*(x - 5) = 12. I need to solve for x, so I should probably get x by itself on one side. Let me distribute the 2 on the left side. That gives me 2x - 10 = 12.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check my cross-multiplication step. Yes, 2 times (x - 5) equals 3 times 4, which is 12. Okay, so that's correct. Now, I have 2x - 10 = 12. To get x, I should isolate it. So, I'll add 10 to both sides to move the -10 over.\n\nAdding 10 to both sides: 2x - 10 + 10 = 12 + 10. That simplifies to 2x = 22. Now, to solve for x, I need to get rid of that 2 that's multiplied by x. So, I'll divide both sides by 2. That gives me x = 22/2, which is 11. So, x equals 11.\n\nHmm, let me verify if"

            "output": " this works by plugging it back into the original equation. Let's see, the original equation was 2/3 = 4/(x -5). If x is 11, then the denominator on the right is 11 - 5, which is 6. So, the right side becomes 4/6. Simplify 4/6 by dividing numerator and denominator by 2, and that's 2/3. Which matches the left side of the equation. That checks out! So x = 11 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, but I should also make sure that there's no division by zero in the original equation. The denominator x - 5 would be zero if x is 5, but since we got x = 11, which is not 5, that's fine. So there's no issue here. No extraneous solutions in this case.\n\nSo all steps seem okay. Cross-multiplied, solved the linear equation, checked the solution. So I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{11}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x-5}\\), we can cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions. \n\nFirst, cross-multiply:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot (x - 5) = 3 \\cdot 4\n\\]\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\\[\n2(x - 5) = 12\n\\]\n\nDistribute the 2 on the left side:\n\\[\n2x - 10 = 12\n\\]\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\\[\n2x = 22\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = 11\n\\]\n\nVerify the solution by substituting \\(x = 11\\) back into the original equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{11 - 5} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe equation holds true, and there is no division by zero. \n\nThe solution is \\(\\boxed{11}\\)."
