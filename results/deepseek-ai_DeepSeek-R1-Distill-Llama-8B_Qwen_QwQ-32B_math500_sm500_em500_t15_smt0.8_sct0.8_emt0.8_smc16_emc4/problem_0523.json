Hmm, I remember that when you have a fraction with a square root in the denominator, you can rationalize it by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) would be \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\). That should help eliminate the square root in the denominator.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2 - \\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate.\n\nSo, the numerator becomes \\((1 + \\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})\\). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll distribute 1 over the second parenthesis:\n\n\\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\)\n\n\\(1 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nNext, I'll distribute \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) over the second parenthesis:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 2 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n\\(\\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nSo, combining these terms, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nLet me rearrange the terms to group the constants and the square roots:\n\n\\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nNow, the denominator is \\((2 + \\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})\\). I can use the difference of squares formula here, which is \\( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \\).\n\nSo, applying that:\n\n\\(2^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1\\)\n\nThat's nice because the denominator becomes 1, which simplifies things a lot.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}) / 1 = 2 + 2\\"

Let me see if I can manipulate my expression into that form.\n\nLooking at the current form: \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nI can factor out a 2 from the first two terms:\n\n\\(2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\)\n\nYes, that looks exactly like the form they asked for. So, comparing:\n\n\\(A(1 + \\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D})\\)\n\nIn my case:\n\n- \\(A = 2\\)\n- \\(B = 2\\)\n- \\(C = 3\\)\n- \\(D = 6\\)\n\nWait, let me double-check if \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) are supposed to be positive integers. Yes, they are.\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n\\(A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6\\)\n\nThat's \\(2 + 2 = 4\\), \\(3 + 6 = 9\\), so 4 + 9 = 13.\n\nWait a second, let me confirm my simplification steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\):\n\nNumerator: \\( (1 + \\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) = 2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6} \\)\n\nDenominator: \\((2 + \\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) = 4 - 3 = 1\\)\n\nSo, simplified expression: \\(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nWhich rearranged is \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\), and then factoring gives \\(2"

Let me see if I can represent it another way just to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another form? Let me see:\n\n\\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\) could also be written as \\(2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\), which is what we have. So I think that's the only way to express it as per their instructions.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't miss any steps, let me think again.\n\nSo, starting with \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of denominator, which is \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\). After that, expand the numerator, group like terms, and factor if possible.\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did.\n\nHmm, another way to think about it is to check if the final expression resembles the required form.\n\nGiven that the form is \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C}+\\sqrt{D})\\), looking at my result, which is \\(2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\), so that's exactly matching.\n\nSo, A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6.\n\nAdding them together: 2+2+3+6=13.\n\nYup, that seems solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I think 13 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt"
