I write this term in the quotient and subtract \\( x^6 \\) from \\( x^6 - 3 \\), leaving \\( -3 + x^6 \\).\n\nNext, I repeat the process by dividing \\( -x^6 \\) by \\( x \\), obtaining \\( -x^5 \\). I add this to the existing quotient \\( x^5 - x^5 \\), which simplifies to 0.\n\nContinuing this pattern, each subsequent term cancels out in the quotient, eventually leading to zero. This means that after all terms are processed, the remainder is \\( -3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\) is \\( -x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x + 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( -3 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\), we can use **polynomial long division**.\n\nHere are the step-by-step calculations:\n\n1. **Set Up the Division:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{r}\n   \\displaystyle \\frac{x^6 - 3}{x + 1} \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Divide the Leading Terms:**\n   \n   - Divide \\( x^6 \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( x^5 \\).\n   - Write \\( x^5 \\) in the quotient.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{r}\n   \\displaystyle \\frac{x^6}{x} = x^5 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Multiply and Subtract:**\n   \n   - Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^5 \\) to get \\( x^6 + x^5 \\).\n"
