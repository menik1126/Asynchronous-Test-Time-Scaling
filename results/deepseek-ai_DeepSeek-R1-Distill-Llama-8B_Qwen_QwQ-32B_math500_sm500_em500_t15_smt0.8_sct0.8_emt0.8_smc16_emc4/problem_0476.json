            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\) given three equations. Let me see how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the given equations:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + x^2z + yz^2 + y^2z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, the third equation looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor or simplify it somehow. Let me write it out again:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + x^2z + yz^2 + y^2z \\)\n\nI notice that each term has either two variables multiplied together with one variable squared. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let me try grouping terms:\n\nGroup the terms with similar variables:\n\n- Terms with \\( x \\): \\( xy^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + x^2z \\)\n- Terms with \\( y \\): \\( yz^2 + y^2z \\)\n\nLooking at the terms with \\( x \\), I can factor out an \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x(y^2 + xy + z^2 + xz) \\)\n\nSimilarly, for the \\( y \\) terms, factor out a \\( y \\):\n\n\\( y(z^2 + yz) \\)\n\nSo now, the entire third equation becomes:\n\n\\( x(y^2 + xy + z^2 + xz) + y(z^2 + yz) = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, this still looks a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way. Let me think about symmetric polynomials or using known identities.\n\nI remember that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\). Maybe I can use this identity to relate the given equations.\n\nGiven that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\) and \\( xyz = 4 \\), plugging into the identity:\n\n\\( 4 - 3 \\times 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2"

Let me denote \\( S = x + y + z \\), \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\).\n\nI know that \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \\). So substituting into the above equation:\n\n\\( S( (S^2 - 2P) - P ) = -8 \\)\n\\( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \\)\n\\( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \\)\n\nHmm, so that's one equation involving \\( S \\) and \\( P \\). Now, I need another equation to relate \\( S \\) and \\( P \\). Maybe I can use the third given equation somehow.\n\nLooking back at the third equation:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + x^2z + yz^2 + y^2z = 12 \\)\n\nI notice that this can be written as:\n\n\\( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( x^2y + xy^2 + x^2z + xz^2 + y^2z + yz^2 = 12 \\)\n\nAlternatively, this can be factored as:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let me see if I can express this in terms of \\( S \\), \\( P \\), and \\( Q \\).\n\nLet me consider each term:\n\n- \\( x^2y + x^2z = x^2(y + z) \\)\n- Similarly, \\( xy^2 + xz^2 = y^2x + z^2x = x(y^2 + z^2)"
