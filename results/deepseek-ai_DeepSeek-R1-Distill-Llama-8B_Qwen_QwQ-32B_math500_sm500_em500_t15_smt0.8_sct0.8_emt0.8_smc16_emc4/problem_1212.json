So, the problem says that the direction vector of a line is of the form \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, okay. So, direction vectors are basically the vectors that point in the direction of the line. They can be found by taking the difference between two points on the line.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, it seems like there's a line drawn between points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), which are the intersections of the line \\( AB \\) with the vertical lines at \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\). Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are given as \\( A = (-5, 4) \\) and \\( B = (-1, 3) \\).\n\nI think I need to find the equation of the line \\( AB \\) first. Then, since \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) are points where this line intersects the lines \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\), I can use those to find the direction vector.\n\nWait, actually, since both \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) lie on the line \\( AB \\), the direction vector of \\( AB \\) should be the same as the direction vector of \\( L \\) to \\( R \\) or \\( R \\) to \\( L \\). So, if I can find points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), I can compute the direction vector and then find \\( b \\).\n\nOkay, step one: find the equation of line \\( AB \\). To do that, I can use the two-point form. The slope \\( m \\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\( m = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} = \\frac{-1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nSo, the slope is \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\). Now, using point-slope form with point \\( A(-5, 4) \\):\n\n\\( y - 4 = -\\frac{1}{4}(x + 5) \\)\n\nLet me rewrite that in slope-intercept form:\n\n\\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}"

So the equation of the line is \\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{11}{4} \\).\n\nNow, the points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) are where this line intersects \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\), respectively. Let's find their coordinates.\n\nStarting with point \\( L \\), which is on \\( x = -8 \\):\n\nSubstitute \\( x = -8 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}(-8) + \\frac{11}{4} \\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\( y = 2 + \\frac{11}{4} \\)\n\n\\( y = \\frac{8}{4} + \\frac{11}{4} = \\frac{19}{4} \\)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, \\( -\\frac{1}{4}*(-8) = 2, so 2 + 11/4. 2 is 8/4, so 8/4 + 11/4 is 19/4, which is 4.75. Okay.\n\nSo point \\( L \\) is \\( (-8, 19/4) \\).\n\nNow for point \\( R \\), which is on \\( x = 8 \\):\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 8 \\):\n\n\\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}(8) + \\frac{11}{4} \\)\n\n\\( y = -2 + \\frac{11}{4} \\)\n\n\\( y = -\\frac{8}{4} + \\frac{11}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n\nSo point \\( R \\) is \\( (8, 3/4) \\).\n\nNow, to find the direction vector of the line \\( L R \\), I can subtract the coordinates of \\( L \\) from \\( R \\):\n\n\\( \\text{Vector from } L \\text{ to } R = R - L = (8 - (-8), \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{19}{4})"

So, I need to see if this vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 16 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix} \\) can be scaled to match \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nSo, direction vectors are multiples of each other.

Let me check: 16 * 1 = 16, 16 * 2 = 32, but 28 is between 16 and 32, so 28/16 reduces to 7/4. Yes.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. That seems positive, but the direction vector from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\) was \\( (16, -4) \\). So, the vector from \\( R \\) to \\( L \\) would be \\( (-16, 4) \\). But the problem just mentions the direction vector, so depending on the direction, the scalar could be negative.\n\nWait, let me verify.
