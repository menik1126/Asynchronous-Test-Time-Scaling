This will make it easier to solve for \\(x\\).\n\nNext, I'll express 256 as a power of 2. Since \\(2^8 = 256\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNow, applying the exponent rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\), the right side becomes \\(2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n\nSince the bases are equal, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, solving for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2 gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express both sides with the same base**:\n   \n   Notice that both 2 and 256 are powers of 2.\n   \n   \\[\n   256 = 2^8\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = \\left(2^8\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the right side using exponent rules**:\n   \n   Use the power of a power rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\):\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left(2^8\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   Now, the equation is:\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the exponents equal to each other**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same and \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\), we can set the exponents equal:\n   \n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for"
