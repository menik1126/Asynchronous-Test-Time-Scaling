            "output": "First, let's define the initial number of blue marbles as B and the initial number of yellow marbles as Y.\n\nAccording to the problem, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that B/Y = 4/3.\n\nNext, after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3. So, (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3.\n\nNow, we can solve the first equation for Y in terms of B:\nY = (3/4)B.\n\nSubstitute Y into the second equation:\n(B + 5)/( (3/4)B - 3 ) = 7/3.\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by the denominator:\n3(B + 5) = 7( (3/4)B - 3 ).\n\nSimplify the equation:\n3B + 15 = (21/4)B - 21.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to remove the fraction:\n12B + 60 = 21B - 84.\n\nSubtract 12B from both sides:\n60 = 9B - 84.\n\nAdd 84 to both sides:\n144 = 9B.\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 9:\nB = 16.\n\nSo, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before the changes.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = initial number of blue marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = initial number of yellow marbles\n\n**Given:**\n1. The initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( \\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n2. After adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes \\( \\frac{B + 5}{Y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3} \\).\n\n**Step 1:** Express \\( Y \\) in terms of \\( B \\) using the first ratio.\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\implies Y = \\frac{3}{4}B\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute \\( Y \\) into the second equation.\n\\[\n\\frac{B + 5}{\\frac{3}{4}B"
