            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about triangle ABC. It says that the area of the triangle is equal to \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are the sides of the triangle. I need to compute \\( \\tan A \\). Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a triangle, the area can be calculated using various formulas. One common formula is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times base \\times height \\), but that might not be directly helpful here since I don't know the height. Another formula that comes to mind is Heron's formula, which is \\( \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \\), where \\( s \\) is the semi-perimeter. But that also seems complicated.\n\nWait, another formula for the area of a triangle is \\( \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are two sides and \\( C \\) is the included angle between them. Maybe that's useful here because the problem gives me information involving sides \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). But in this case, I don't know which angle is included between which sides. Hmm, the problem mentions angle \\( A \\), so maybe it's the angle opposite side \\( a \\).\n\nHold on, actually, in triangle notation, side \\( a \\) is opposite angle \\( A \\), \\( b \\) is opposite angle \\( B \\), and \\( c \\) is opposite angle \\( C \\). So, if I want to use the formula \\( \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C \\), I need to figure out which sides and which angle to use. But the problem doesn't specify which sides correspond to which angles explicitly, so maybe I can assume that angle \\( A \\) is between sides \\( b \\) and \\( c \\). That makes sense because angle \\( A \\) is opposite side \\( a \\), so the sides forming angle \\( A \\) would be \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\nSo, if I use that formula, the area \\( \\Delta \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\) would be \\( \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A \\). According to the problem, this area is equal to \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\"

Let's work on simplifying the right-hand side first. Let me compute \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). That looks like a difference of squares, so it factors as:\n\n\\[\na^2 - (b - c)^2 = (a - (b - c))(a + (b - c)) = (a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\\]\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A = (a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\\]\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me think about what else I know. In a triangle, the Law of Cosines relates the sides of the triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. Specifically, for angle \\( A \\), it states that:\n\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A\n\\]\n\nMaybe I can use this equation along with the area equation to solve for \\( \\sin A \\) and then find \\( \\tan A \\) by dividing \\( \\sin A \\) by \\( \\cos A \\).\n\nLet me rewrite the area equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A = (a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\\]\n\nI can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\nbc\\sin A = 2(a - b + c)(a + b - c)\n\\]\n\nNow, let me expand the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, let's compute \\( (a - b + c)(a + b - c) \\). This looks like \\( (a + c - b)(a + b - c) \\). Maybe I can use the difference of squares formula here as well. Let me set \\( x = a + c \\) and \\( y = b \\), then it becomes \\( (x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( (a + c - b)(a + b - c) = (a + c)^2 - b^2 \\). Let's compute that:\n\n"
