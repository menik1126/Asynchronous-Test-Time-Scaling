Let me try to visualize the setup first.\n\nThere's a flat field with points A, B, C, D, and O. O is the origin, I suppose. A is directly north of O, which means it's straight up along the y-axis. B is directly west of O, so that's along the negative x-axis. C is directly south of O, along the negative y-axis, and D is directly east of O, along the positive x-axis.\n\nSo, if I imagine a coordinate system with O at (0,0), then A would be at (0, a) for some a, but since the exact distance isn't given, maybe it's better to assign coordinates based on the information we have.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that the distance between C and D is 140 meters. Let me note that down. If C is south of O and D is east of O, then C is at (0, -c) and D is at (d, 0) for some c and d. The distance between C and D would then be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs c and d.\n\nSo, distance CD = sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) = 140 m. That's one equation.\n\nNow, there's a hot-air balloon at point H directly above O. So H is at (0, h) where h is the height above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. The problem gives the lengths of ropes HC and HD: HC is 150 m and HD is 130 m. So we know the lengths from H to C and H to D.\n\nSince HC is 150 m and C is at (0, -c), the distance from H to C would be the distance from (0, h) to (0, -c), which is |h + c| because they're on the same vertical line. So, HC = h + c = 150 m. Similarly, HD is the distance from H to D, which is from (0, h) to (d, 0). Using the distance formula, HD = sqrt(d\u00b2 + h\u00b2) = 130 m.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. h + c"

Let me write them down again:\n\n1. h + c = 150\n2. sqrt(d\u00b2 + h\u00b2) = 130\n3. sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) = 140\n\nI need to solve for c, d, h first. Let me see how to do that.\n\nStarting with equation 1: h = 150 - c. Let's substitute h into equation 2 and 3.\n\nEquation 2 becomes sqrt(d\u00b2 + (150 - c)^2) = 130. Squaring both sides: d\u00b2 + (150 - c)^2 = 16900.\n\nEquation 3 is sqrt(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) = 140. Squaring that: c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = 19600.\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1. d\u00b2 + (150 - c)^2 = 16900\n2. c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = 19600\n\nLet me subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate d\u00b2.\n\nFirst equation minus second equation:\n\n[d\u00b2 + (150 - c)^2] - [c\u00b2 + d\u00b2] = 16900 - 19600\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(150 - c)^2 - c\u00b2 = -2700\n\nExpand (150 - c)^2: 150\u00b2 - 2*150*c + c\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = 22500 - 300c\n\nSo, 22500 - 300c = -2700\n\nThen, 22500 + 2700 = 300c\n\n25200 = 300c\n\nDivide both sides by 300: c = 25200 / 300 = 84.\n\nSo c = 84"

Now, from equation 1, h = 150 - c = 150 - 84 = 66 meters.\n\nNow, with c = 84, we can find d using equation 3.\n\nEquation 3: c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = 19600.\n\nSo, 84\u00b2 + d\u00b2 = 19600.\n\nCalculate 84\u00b2: 84*84 = 7056.\n\nTherefore, d\u00b2 = 19600 - 7056 = 12544.\n\nSo d = sqrt(12544). Let me compute sqrt(12544).\n\nHmm, 112^2 is 12544 because 100^2=10000, 110^2=12100, 112^2=12544.\n\nSo d = 112 meters.\n\nSo to recap, C is at (0, -84), D is at (112, 0), O is at (0,0), H is at (0, 66).\n\nNow, the problem says that ropes HC and HD are to be replaced by a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. So P is somewhere along CD, which is from (0, -84) to (112, 0).\n\nThe goal is to find the greatest length of rope that can be saved. The total length saved would be the difference between the sum of HC and HD and the length of HP.\n\nSo, total rope length saved = (HC + HD) - HP = (150 + 130) - HP = 280 - HP.\n\nWe need to maximize the rope saved, so we need to minimize HP. So the problem reduces to finding the shortest possible length of HP such that the balloon remains in place.\n\nWait, but how does replacing HC and HD with HP affect the position? Since the balloon is held in place by HA, HB, HC, and HD. When we replace HC and HD with HP, we need to ensure that the balloon is still in equilibrium, i.e., the net forces are balanced. But in this problem, perhaps we can abstract it as requiring that the balloon is connected via ropes HA, HB, HP, so the position of H must satisfy the lengths of HA, HB, and HP.\n\nBut wait, no, the problem says the balloon remains at the same position H above O. So perhaps we can think of it as replacing the two ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP,"

So the problem is purely geometric: find a point P on CD such that the distance from H to P is as small as possible, so that HP is minimized, thereby maximizing the saved rope length.\n\nTherefore, the minimal HP is the shortest distance from H to the line CD, which is the perpendicular distance. Because the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. So if we can find the perpendicular distance from H to CD, that would be the minimal HP, and then the maximum saved rope would be 280 minus that minimal HP.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD, then computing 280 minus that distance.\n\nSo first, let's find the equation of line CD. Since points C and D are (0, -84) and (112, 0), respectively.\n\nThe slope of CD is (0 - (-84))/(112 - 0) = 84/112 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the equation of line CD can be written in point-slope form. Let's use point C (0, -84):\n\ny - (-84) = (3/4)(x - 0)\n\nSo y + 84 = (3/4)x\n\nThus, the equation is y = (3/4)x - 84.\n\nAlternatively, rearranged to standard form: 3x - 4y - 336 = 0 (since multiplying both sides by 4: 4y = 3x - 336 => 3x -4y -336 =0).\n\nNow, the point H is at (0, 66). Wait, hold on, H is directly above O, so O is (0,0), so H is (0, h) where h was found to be 66. So H is (0, 66).\n\nWait, but in the coordinates, C is at (0, -84), D is at (112,0). So H is at (0,66). So we need the distance from H(0,66) to the line CD: 3x -4y -336 =0.\n\n"

Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the equation of line CD is y = (3/4)x -84.\n\nWait, another way to write this is in standard form: (3/4)x - y - 84 =0. To make it ax + by + c=0, multiply through by 4:\n\n3x -4y - 336=0.\n\nSo the equation is 3x -4y -336=0.

The distance from H to CD is 120. Hmm, but let me visualize: H is above O, which is between C and D. The line CD is going from southwest to northeast?
