Brazil is $6$ cents, France is $6$ cents, Peru is $6$ cents, and Spain is $6$ cents.\n\nNext, I'll count the total number of 70s stamps, which is 4 stamps.\n\nI'll calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of stamps by Brazil's price: 4 * 6 = 24 cents.\n\nFinally, I'll find the average by dividing the total cost by the number of stamps: 24 / 4 = 6.0 cents. Rounded to the nearest tenth, the average price is 6.0 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Price of Each Country's Stamps in the 70s:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\$6 cents\n   - **France:** \\$6 cents\n   - **Peru:** \\$6 cents\n   - **Spain:** \\$6 cents\n\n2. **Count the Total Number of 70s Stamps:**\n   - From the chart, there are **4 stamps** from the 70s.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost of 70s Stamps:**\n   - Total Cost = (Number of Stamps \u00d7 Price per Stamp)\n   - Total Cost = (4 \u00d7 \\$6) = \\$24 cents\n\n4. **Compute the Average Price for 70s Stamps:**\n   - Average Price = (Total Cost) \u00f7 (Number of Stamps)\n   - Average Price = \\$24 \u00f7 4 = \\$6.0 cents\n\n5. **Round to the Nearest Tenth of a Cent:**\n   - The average price is already precise to the nearest tenth of a cent.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{6.0}"

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
