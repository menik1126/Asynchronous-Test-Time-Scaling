            "output": "To determine the number of possible license plates, I'll break down the problem into the number of choices for each segment of the license plate.\n\nFirst, for the two different letters, there are 26 letters in the English alphabet. Since both letters must be different, the first letter has 26 possible choices and the second letter has 25.\n\nNext, for the two different digits, there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9). Similar to the letters, the first digit has 10 choices and the second digit has 9.\n\nTo find the total number of combinations, I'll multiply the number of choices for each segment: 26 (letters) multiplied by 25 (letters) for the letters, and 10 (digits) multiplied by 9 (digits) for the digits. Finally, I'll multiply these two results together to get the total number of possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll analyze each segment of the license plate separately and then combine the results.\n\n### 1. Letters Segment\n- **Total letters in the alphabet**: 26 (A-Z)\n- **Condition**: Every license plate must have **2 different letters**.\n  \n  - **First letter**: 26 possible choices.\n  - **Second letter**: Since one letter has already been used, there are **25** remaining choices.\n\n  **Total combinations for the letters segment**:\n  \\[\n  26 \\times 25 = 650\n  \\]\n\n### 2. Digits Segment\n- **Total digits in the decimal system**: 10 (0-9)\n- **Condition**: Every license plate must have **2 different digits**.\n  \n  - **First digit**: 10 possible choices.\n  - **Second digit**: Since one digit has already been used, there are **9** remaining choices.\n\n  **Total combinations for the digits segment**:\n  \\[\n  10 \\times 9 = 90\n  \\]\n\n### 3. Combining the Segments\n- **Total combinations for the license plate**:\n  \\[\n  650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
