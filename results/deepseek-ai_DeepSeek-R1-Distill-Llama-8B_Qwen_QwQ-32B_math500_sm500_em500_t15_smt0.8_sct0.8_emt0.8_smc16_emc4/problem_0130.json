Hmm, I remember that the superfactorial is a tower of n!s, right? So for 4\\$, it's like 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of 4! and so on, four times. Let me write that down properly.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out each step of this superfactorial. Let me start by computing the factorials step by step.\n\nSo, 4! is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 24. Got that. So, the innermost part is 24. Then, moving up, the next exponent would also be 24, because it's just the same factorial again. Wait, no, actually, each level is the factorial of the previous number, but in this case, we're just taking 4! every time. So, it's 4!^4!^4!^4!.\n\nWait, but the definition says it's n! towers of n!s, right? So for n=4, it's a tower of four 4!s. So 4\\$ = 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!))). Let me compute this step by step.\n\nLet me start from the top. The top exponent is 4!, which is 24. Then the next level down is 4!^24, and the level below that is 4!^(4!^24), and the bottom level is 4! raised to that. But wait, maybe I should break it down more methodically.\n\nLet me denote 4\\$ as:\n4\\$ = 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!)))\n\nSo, starting from the top:\n- The top exponent is 4! = 24.\n- The next level is 4!^24.\n- Then, the next level down is 4!^(4!^24).\n- Finally, the bottom level is 4!^(4!^(4!^24)).\n\nWait, no, that's not right.

So when we compute the units digit, perhaps we can use modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 10, because the units digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10.\n\nSo to compute the units digit, I can compute each exponent modulo \u03c6(10), where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. Since 10 and 24 are not coprime, but for modulus 10, \u03c6(10)=4, because the numbers less than 10 that are coprime to 10 are 1,3,7,9.\n\nWait, but 24 and 10 are not coprime, so maybe it's more complicated. Alternatively, I might need to compute exponents modulo 10 directly, but considering the exponents' periodicity modulo 10.\n\nLet me try to compute each step, keeping track of the exponents modulo \u03c6(10) where possible.\n\nWait, perhaps let's break down the units digit computation step by step"

Since 24 mod 10 is 4, so 24 \u2261 4 mod 10. Therefore, 24^E mod 10 is equivalent to 4^E mod 10.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding 4^E mod 10, where E = 24^(24^24).\n\nNow, to compute 4^E mod 10, we can note that powers of 4 mod 10 cycle every 2.

No, in the problem statement, it's written as underbrace n!^{n!^{...}}_{n!} }, so the number of terms is n! which for n=4, is 24 terms. That seems too large, so perhaps I misinterpret the notation again.\n\nWait, maybe the notation is that the tower has n exponents, each being n!. So for n=4, it's 24^24^24^24, but that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the tower has n levels, each being n!.\n\nWait, perhaps the tower is n levels high, meaning that the expression is n!^{n!^{...}} with n levels. So for n=4, it's 24^(24^(24^24)).\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent because n=4 would have four levels, so the tower would be 24^(24^(24^24)), which is three exponents, but that's not four. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way to count. Alternatively, maybe the number of exponents is n, so for n=4, the tower is 24^24^24^24, with four exponents. So, 24^(24^(24^24)).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement: \"The superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{...}} }_{n!} }\n\nWait, so the underbrace is over the exponents, meaning that the number of exponents is n! So for n=4, it's a tower of 24 exponents, each being 4!=24. So the expression is 24^{24^{24^{...}}} with 24 layers. That's a massive tower, and it's not practical to compute directly.

The underbrace is labeled with n!.\n\nAh, perhaps the underbrace is indicating that the number of exponents is n, not n!.\n\nWait, the notation is a bit ambiguous.
