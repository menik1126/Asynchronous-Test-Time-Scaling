            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: \n\nIf log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then find x. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations to make it clearer:\n\n1. log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2\n2. log_y(5x) = 2\n\nAlright, starting with the first equation. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying the arguments. So, log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(a*c). Let me apply that here.\n\nSo, log\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. Multiplying (x - y) and (x + y) gives me a difference of squares, which is x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\nlog\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that here:\n\n6\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2\n\nCalculating 6 squared, that's 36. So:\n\n36 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2\n\nAlright, so that's one equation relating x and y.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Again, I can convert this logarithmic equation to its exponential form. So:\n\ny\u00b2 = 5x\n\nHmm, so y squared is equal to 5 times x. That gives me another equation relating x and y.\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36\n2. y\u00b2 = 5x\n\nIt seems like I can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for x. Let me try that.\n\nFrom equation 2, y\u00b2 = 5x. So, I can replace y\u00b2 in equation 1 with 5x:\n\nx\u00b2 - 5x = 36\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let me rearrange it to standard form:\n\nx\u00b2"

            "output": " - 5x - 36 = 0\n\nTo solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = -5, and c = -36.\n\nCalculate the discriminant first: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (-5)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-36) = 25 + 144 = 169.\n\nSince the discriminant is a perfect square, the roots will be rational. So:\n\nx = [5 \u00b1 sqrt(169)] / 2\nx = [5 \u00b1 13] / 2\n\nThis gives me two possible solutions:\n\n1. x = (5 + 13)/2 = 18/2 = 9\n2. x = (5 - 13)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4\n\nWait a moment, x is in the arguments of logarithms in the original equations. Logarithms are only defined for positive numbers, so x must be positive. Therefore, x = -4 is not a valid solution because it would make the arguments of the logarithms negative, which isn't allowed. So, we discard x = -4.\n\nTherefore, x must be 9.\n\nBut hold on, let me check if this makes sense. If x = 9, then from equation 2, y\u00b2 = 5x = 5*9 = 45. So, y\u00b2 = 45. That means y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But y is also inside logarithms, so y must be positive and not equal to 1, I think.\n\nWait, log base y is defined only when y > 0 and y \u2260 1. So, y is sqrt(45), which is approximately 6.708, so that's fine because it's positive and not 1.\n\nNow, let me also check the original first equation with x = 9 and y = sqrt(45). So, let's see:\n\nlog\u2086(9 - sqrt(45)) + log\u2086(9 + sqrt(45)) should equal 2.\n\nLet me compute (9 - sqrt(45))(9 + sqrt(45)) which is 9\u00b2 - (sqrt(45))\u00b2 = 81 - 45 = 36. So, we have log\u2086(36)"

            "output": " + log\u2086(something) equals 2. Wait, no, that's just the sum of the logs. Wait, actually, we had log\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = log\u2086(36) because (x - y)(x + y) = 36. So, log\u2086(36) is indeed 2 because 6\u00b2 = 36. So, that part checks out.\n\nAlso, checking the second equation, with y = sqrt(45) and x = 9, log_{sqrt(45)}(5*9) = log_{sqrt(45)}(45). Let's compute that. Since sqrt(45) squared is 45, so sqrt(45)^2 = 45. So, log_{sqrt(45)}(45) = 2, which matches the second equation.\n\nTherefore, everything seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, are there any other constraints or possible issues?\n\nLet me see, in the first equation, x + y and x - y must be positive because they are inside logarithms. So, x > y and x > -y. Since x is positive, and y is sqrt(45) which is about 6.708, so x = 9 > 6.708, so x > y holds. Also, x + y is about 15.708, which is positive, so that's fine.\n\nWhat about y? y is sqrt(45) which is positive, so that's okay for the logarithm base.\n\nSo, all the logarithms are defined, so x = 9 is the valid solution.\n\nWait, another thought: in the first equation, when I combined the logs, I assumed that (x - y)(x + y) is positive, which it is because x > y, so their product is positive.\n\nSo, all steps seem to hold, no errors that I can see.\n\nTherefore, x is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by simplifying the first logarithmic equation using logarithmic properties and then substitute from the second equation to form a quadratic equation in \\( x \\). Solving this quadratic equation and considering the constraints of the logarithm domains, we find that \\( x = 9 \\) is the valid solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Combine the logarithms in the first equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\"
