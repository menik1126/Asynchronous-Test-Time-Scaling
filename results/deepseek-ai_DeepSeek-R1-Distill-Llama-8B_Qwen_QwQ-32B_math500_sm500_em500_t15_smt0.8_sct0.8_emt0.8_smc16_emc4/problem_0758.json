The sequence is \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots\\), and it has some specific properties regarding geometric and arithmetic subsequences. Also, we're given that \\(a_{13} = 2016\\), and we need to find \\(a_1\\).\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. The sequence is strictly increasing, which means each term is bigger than the one before it. That helps because it tells me that the ratios and differences will be positive, which is good for dealing with geometric and arithmetic sequences.\n\nNow, the problem says that for every positive integer \\(k\\), the subsequence \\(a_{2k-1}\\), \\(a_{2k}\\), \\(a_{2k+1}\\) is geometric. A geometric sequence has the property that each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. So, for this subsequence, the ratio between \\(a_{2k}\\) and \\(a_{2k-1}\\) should be the same as the ratio between \\(a_{2k+1}\\) and \\(a_{2k}\\). That gives us the equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{a_{2k}}{a_{2k-1}} = \\frac{a_{2k+1}}{a_{2k}} \\)\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n\\( a_{2k+1} = \\left( \\frac{a_{2k}}{a_{2k-1}} \\right)^2 \\times a_{2k-1} \\) or \\( a_{2k+1} = r^2 \\times a_{2k} \\), if \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to just note that in a geometric sequence with three terms \\(a\\), \\(ar\\), \\(ar^2\\), so here \\(a_{2k-1} = a\\), \\(a_{2k} = ar\\), \\(a_{2k+1} = ar^2\\). So, the ratio \\(r\\) is the same across each such triplet.\n\nSimilarly, the problem also states that the subsequence \\(a_{2k}\\), \\(a_{2k+1}\\), \\(a_{2"

An arithmetic sequence has each term differing by a constant difference, so the difference between \\(a_{2k+1}\\) and \\(a_{2k}\\) should be the same as the difference between \\(a_{2k+2}\\) and \\(a_{2k+1}\\).
