It says that there's a sequence of positive real numbers, (a1, a2, ..., an), and it gives me three sums: the sum of the numbers, the sum of their squares, and the sum of their cubes. The sums are 96, 144, and 216 respectively. I need to find the sum of all possible values of n.\n\nHmm, let me write down what I know.\n\nGiven:\n1. Sum of ai from i=1 to n is 96. So, Σa_i = 96.\n2. Sum of ai squared is 144. So, Σa_i² = 144.\n3. Sum of ai cubed is 216. So, Σa_i³ = 216.\n\nI need to find possible n values and sum them up.\n\nI remember that in problems involving sums of powers, sometimes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities come into play, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go here. Alternatively, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the variance, or perhaps considering the relationship between the sums of powers.\n\nWait, another thought: for positive real numbers, there's a relationship between the sums of powers. Maybe if all the ai are equal, then we can compute n easily. Let's check that.\n\nIf all ai are equal, then each ai would be 96/n, right? So, the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)² = 96²/n. Similarly, the sum of cubes would be n*(96/n)³ = 96³/n².\n\nSo, let's set these equal to their given sums.\n\nFor the squares:\n\nn*(96/n)² = 144\nSimplify: 96² / n = 144\nSo, 96² = 144n\nCompute 96²: 9216\nSo, 9216 = 144n\nDivide both sides by 144: 9216 / 144 = 64, so n = 64.\n\nWait, now check with the cubes to see if this holds.\n\nSum of cubes when all ai are equal: 96³ / n²\n\nSo, 96³ / n² should be equal to 216.\n\nCompute 96³: 96*96=9216, 9216*96= let's compute that step by step."

So total 864,000 +17,280 = 881,280. Hmm, that's less than 884,736. Let me see:\n\nWait, 216 * 4096 = ?\n\nWait, maybe better to compute 884,736 ÷ 216.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 884,736 ÷8 = 110,592; 216 ÷8 =27.\n\nSo now 110,592 /27. Let's divide 110,592 by 27:\n\n27*4000 = 108,000. Subtract that from 110,592: 2,592 left.\n\n27*96 = 2,592. So total is 4000 +96 = 4096.\n\nTherefore, n² = 4096, so n = 64. Wait, that's the same n as before. So if all the ai are equal, then n=64 satisfies all three equations.

Maybe that's the only possibility. But I should check if other n's are possible.\n\nLet me see: could n be larger than 64?\n\nWait, from the Cauchy-Schwarz step, we know that n must be at least 64. So possible n's are n ≥64.\n\nBut maybe n can't be larger than 64 because the sum of cubes is fixed. Let me see.\n\nWait, the sum of cubes is 216.
