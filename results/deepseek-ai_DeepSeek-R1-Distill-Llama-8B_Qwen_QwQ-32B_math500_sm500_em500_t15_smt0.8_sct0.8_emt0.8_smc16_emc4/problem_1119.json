            "output": "First, I understand that y varies inversely as the square root of x, which means there's a constant k such that y = k divided by the square root of x.\n\nNext, I'll use the given values to find the constant k. When x is 24 and y is 15, I can substitute these into the equation to solve for k.\n\nOnce I have the value of k, I'll use it to find the new value of x when y is 3. I'll substitute y with 3 and solve the equation for x.\n\nFinally, I'll perform the calculations to determine the value of x when y is 3.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given that \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\). This relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the constant of proportionality.\n\n**Step 1: Find the constant \\( k \\)**\n\nWe are provided with \\( x = 24 \\) and \\( y = 15 \\). Substitute these values into the equation to find \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n15 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{24}}\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( \\sqrt{24} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6} = 2\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\nk = 15 \\times \\sqrt{24} = 15 \\times 2\\sqrt{6} = 30\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Find \\( x \\) when \\( y = 3 \\)**\n\nUsing the constant \\( k = 30\\sqrt{6} \\), substitute \\( y = 3 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}}\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( \\sqrt{x} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x} = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{3} = 10\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, square both sides to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = (10\\sqrt{6})^2 = 10^2 \\times (\\sqrt{6})^2 = 100 \\times 6 = 600\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{600}\n\\]"
