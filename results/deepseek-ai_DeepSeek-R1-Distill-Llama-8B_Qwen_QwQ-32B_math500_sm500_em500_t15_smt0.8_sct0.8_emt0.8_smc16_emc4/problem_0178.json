I remember that for complex numbers, the modulus is like the distance from the origin in the complex plane, right? So, modulus of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). But here, w is a quotient of two complex numbers, so maybe I can find the modulus of the numerator and the denominator separately and then divide them?\n\nLet me write down what z is. z is 1 + i, so substituting that into the expression for w, I get w = [3(1 + i) + 1]/[5(1 + i) + 7]. Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately to avoid mistakes.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 3(1 + i) + 1. That's 3*1 + 3*i + 1, which is 4 + 3i. Okay, so numerator is 4 + 3i.\n\nNow the denominator: 5(1 + i) + 7. That's 5*1 + 5*i + 7, which is 12 + 5i. Hmm, so denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nNow, I need to find the modulus of w, which is |w| = |numerator| / |denominator|. Because I remember that for any two complex numbers, |z1/z2| = |z1| / |z2|.\n\nSo, let's compute |4 + 3i|. That's sqrt(4\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nNext, |12 + 5i| is sqrt(12\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13.\n\nSo, |w| = 5 / 13. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nIs w = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7)? Yes, and z = 1 + i. So, numerator: 3*(1 + i) + 1 is 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i. Denominator: 5"

That should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with complex fractions, people might multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate to rationalize. Maybe I should try that to confirm.\n\nLet me compute w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is 12 - 5i.\n\nSo, numerator becomes (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) = 4*12 + 4*(-5i) + 3i*12 + 3i*(-5i) = 48 -20i +36i -15i\u00b2. Since i\u00b2 = -1, so this becomes 48 +16i +15 = 63 +16i.\n\nDenominator: (12 +5i)(12 -5i) = 12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2 = 144 -25i\u00b2 = 144 +25 =169.\n\nSo, w becomes (63 +16i)/169. So, the modulus is sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2)/169. Let's compute that.\n\n63\u00b2 is 3969 and 16\u00b2 is 256, so 3969 +256 = 4225. sqrt(4225) is 65. Therefore, |w| = 65/169 = 5/13. Okay, same as before. So that confirms it.\n\nI think I did everything right. So, answer is 5/13.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulus of \\( w \\), we start by substituting \\( z = 1 + i \\) into the expression for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{3z + 1}{5z + 7}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( z = 1 + i \\):\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{3(1 + i) + 1}{5(1 + i) + 7}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n\n\\[\n3(1 + i) + 1 = 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i\n\\]\n\nCalculate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n5(1 + i) + 7 = 5 + "
