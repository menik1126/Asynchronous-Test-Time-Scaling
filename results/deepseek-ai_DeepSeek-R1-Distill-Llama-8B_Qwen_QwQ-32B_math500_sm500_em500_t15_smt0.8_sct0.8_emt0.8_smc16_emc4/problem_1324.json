I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the rectangle. Let me consider rectangle ABCD with center O. The Asymptote code shows the rectangle centered at the origin, with points A, B, C, D at (-250,100), (250,100), (250,-100), (-250,-100) respectively. So, AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side.\n\nGiven that AB/AD = k, which is a ratio. So, AB is the length of the top side, and AD is the length of the left side. In the coordinate system, AB would be the distance from A to B, which is from (-250,100) to (250,100), so that's 500 units. AD is from A (-250,100) to D (-250,-100), which is 200 units. So, in the Asymptote code, AB is twice AD, so k would be 2 in this case.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's just given as k, so I should treat it generally. Maybe it's better to take the rectangle dimensions such that AB = k and AD = 1, or some other way. Alternatively, let's consider the rectangle with length AB = 2a and AD = 2b, so that the center O is at (0,0). That might make things symmetric.\n\nWait, let me think about that. If I take AB = 2a and AD = 2b, then the rectangle extends from (-a, b) to (a, -b). Or maybe I should switch the axes? Let me clarify. Typically, in a rectangle, AB is the length along the x-axis, and AD is the length along the y-axis. So, if AB = 2a, then from point A (-a, b) to B (a, b). Then AD is from A (-a, b) to D (-a, -b), so AD is 2b. So, the ratio AB/AD is (2a)/(2b"

            "output": ") = a/b = k. So, a/b = k, so a = k*b. That might be a good way to parameterize it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's simpler to set coordinates such that the rectangle has vertices at (-k, 1), (k, 1), (k, -1), (-k, -1). Then the center O is at (0,0). Then AB would be the length from (-k,1) to (k,1), which is 2k, and AD is from (-k,1) to (-k,-1), which is 2. So the ratio AB/AD is (2k)/2 = k, which matches the problem's condition. That seems manageable. So let's go with that coordinate system.\n\nSo, rectangle with vertices at (-k,1), (k,1), (k,-1), (-k,-1). The center is (0,0). The sides are 2k and 2. The problem is to find the probability that a random point in this rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D.\n\nTo find this probability, I need to determine the region within the rectangle where the distance to O is less than the distance to each of the four vertices. Then, the area of that region divided by the area of the rectangle will be the probability.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the set of points equidistant to two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting them. So, the region where a point is closer to O than to, say, vertex A, is the region on the side of the perpendicular bisector between O and A. Similarly for the other vertices. The intersection of all these regions (closer to O than A, B, C, D) will be the area we need.\n\nAlternatively, the Voronoi region around O with respect to the four vertices. Since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe the regions can be found by constructing perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex, and then the intersection of those regions.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me denote the vertices as follows:\n\nA: (-k, 1)\n\nB: (k, 1)\n\nC: (k, -1)\n\nD: (-k, -1)\n\nO: (0,0)\n\nWe need the set of points (x,y) in the rectangle such that"
