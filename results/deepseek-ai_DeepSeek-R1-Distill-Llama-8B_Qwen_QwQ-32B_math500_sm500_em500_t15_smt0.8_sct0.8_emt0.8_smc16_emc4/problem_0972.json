According to the problem, \\( D = 16 \\) and \\( N = 12 \\).\n\nNext, I'll express the pay ratio. Denali's pay to Nate's pay ratio can be written as \\( \\frac{D}{N} \\), which is \\( \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nNow, consider the first scenario where Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs and Nate stays at 12 dogs. Denali's new number of dogs becomes \\( 16 + 4x \\), and Nate's remains 12. The pay ratio in this case is \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\).\n\nSetting these ratios equal gives the equation \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\). Solving for \\( x \\), I multiply both sides by 12: \\( 16 + 4x = 16 \\). Subtracting 16 from both sides: \\( 4x = 0 \\). Dividing by 4: \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nHowever, the problem states that \\( x \\neq 0 \\), so this scenario doesn't provide a valid solution.\n\nMoving on to the second scenario where \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. Denali's new number of dogs becomes \\( 16 + x \\), and Nate's decreases to \\( 12 - x \\). The pay ratio in this case is \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\).\n\nSetting this ratio equal to the original pay ratio \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), the equation becomes \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3} \\). Cross-multiplying: \\( 3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x) \\). Expanding both sides: \\( 48 + 3x = 48 - 4x \\).\n\nCombining like terms: \\( 7x = 0 \\). Dividing by 7: \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nAgain, this solution doesn't satisfy the condition \\( x \\neq 0 \\). Therefore, there must be an inconsistency in the problem setup"

I'll need to revisit the problem to ensure all information is correctly interpreted.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks **16** dogs.\n- Nate walks **12** dogs.\n- The pay ratio between Denali and Nate remains the same under two different scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:** Denali walks **4x** more dogs, and Nate continues with **12** dogs.\n\n- **Denali's dogs:** \\( 16 + 4x \\)\n- **Nate's dogs:** \\( 12 \\)\n\n**Scenario 2:** **\\( x \\)** of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n\n- **Denali's dogs:** \\( 16 + x \\)\n- **Nate's dogs:** \\( 12 - x \\)\n\n**Let’s denote the original pay ratio as \\( \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).**\n\n**For Scenario 1:**\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n16 + 4x = 16\n\\]\n\\[\n4x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0\n\\]\nSince \\( x \\neq 0 \\), this scenario doesn't provide a valid solution.\n\n**For Scenario 2:**\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x)\n\\]\n\\[\n48 + 3x = 48 - 4x\n\\]\n\\[\n7x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0\n\\]\nAgain, \\( x = 0 \\) doesn't satisfy \\( x \\neq 0 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem setup.

Let me re-examine the problem.\n\n**Revised Interpretation:**\nThe ratio of their **total pay** (not just the number of dogs) must be the same in both scenarios. Suppose their pay is proportional to the number of dogs they walk. Let’s denote their pay rates as \\( p_D \\) and \\( p_N \\). However, the problem states they are paid \"for each dog they walk,\" implying pay is directly proportional to the number of dogs. Thus, the ratio of their pay is the same as the ratio of dogs.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem means the ratio of their **total pay** (including any changes) must be equal in both scenarios. Let me re-express the problem:\n\nThe ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is the same in two cases:\n1. Denali walks \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs, Nate stays at 12.\n2. \\( x \\) dogs are moved from Nate to Denali (so Denali has \\( 16 + x \\), Nate has \\( 12 - x \\)).\n\nThe ratio must be equal in both cases. So the original ratio is \\( \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\). But the problem says the ratio would be the same in both scenarios, which might not necessarily be the original ratio. Wait, the wording is ambiguous here.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.\"\n\nAh! The ratio in both scenarios must be equal to each other, not necessarily the original ratio. That was my mistake earlier.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\nLet’s denote the ratio in both scenarios as equal.\n\nLet \\( R \\) be the common ratio.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\nDenali: \\( 16 + 4x \\), Nate: \\( 12 \\)\n\\[\nR = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12}\n\\]\n\n**Scenario 2:**\nDenali: \\( 16 + x \\), Nate: \\( 12 - x \\)\n\\[\nR = \\frac"
