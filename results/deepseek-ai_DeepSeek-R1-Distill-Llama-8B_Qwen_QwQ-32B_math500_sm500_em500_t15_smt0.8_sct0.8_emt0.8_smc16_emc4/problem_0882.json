            "output": "First, I need to understand what a terminating decimal is. A terminating decimal is a decimal representation that ends after a finite number of digits. To determine if a fraction can be expressed as a terminating decimal, I'll check if the denominator has only the prime factors 2 and/or 5 after simplifying the fraction.\n\nNext, I'll factorize the denominator of the fraction 57/160. The denominator is 160, which can be broken down into prime factors: 160 = 2^5 * 5. Since the denominator only has the prime factors 2 and 5, the fraction can be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n\nNow, I'll convert the fraction to its decimal form by dividing the numerator by the denominator. So, 57 divided by 160 equals 0.35625.\n\nTherefore, the fraction 57/160 is equal to the terminating decimal 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Terminating Decimals:**\n   - A terminating decimal is a decimal that ends after a finite number of digits (e.g., 0.5 or 0.25).\n   - For a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) to be a terminating decimal, the prime factors of the denominator \\(b\\) must only include 2 and/or 5.\n\n2. **Factorize the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is 160. Let's factorize it:\n     \\[\n     160 = 2^5 \\times 5\n     \\]\n   - Since 160 has only the prime factors 2 and 5, the fraction can be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n\n3. **Convert the Fraction to Decimal:**\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n     \\]\n   - The decimal terminates after 5 digits (35625).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
