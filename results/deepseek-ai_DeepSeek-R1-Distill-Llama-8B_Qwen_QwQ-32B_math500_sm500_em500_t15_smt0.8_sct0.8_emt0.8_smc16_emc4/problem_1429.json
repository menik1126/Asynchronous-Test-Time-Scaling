Since \\( 2 \\) is the only prime factor, this simplifies to \\( (2)^{24} \\).\n\nNext, I'll consider the exponent \\( 24 \\) and analyze its prime factors. The exponent \\( 24 \\) can be factored into \\( 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\).\n\nNow, I'll look for all possible exponents \\( n \\) such that \\( n \\) divides \\( 24 \\). The divisors of \\( 24 \\) greater than \\( 1 \\) are \\( 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, \\) and \\( 24 \\).\n\nFinally, each of these divisors corresponds to a value of \\( n \\) where \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.
