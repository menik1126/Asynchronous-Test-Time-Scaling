The problem gives me three sums: the sum of the terms, the sum of their squares, and the sum of their cubes. I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\), which is the number of terms in the sequence. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me write down what's given:\n\n- \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n- \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n- \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, so I have three equations here, all sums involving powers of the sequence terms. I remember that in problems like this, it's often useful to think about the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or maybe the relationship between the arithmetic mean, quadratic mean, and cubic mean. Or perhaps even the concept of moments in probability, but I don't know if that applies here.\n\nWait, another thought: if all the \\( a_i \\) are equal, then we can relate these sums directly. Let me test that. If all \\( a_i = a \\), then:\n\n- \\( \\sum a_i = n \\cdot a = 96 \\) \u2192 \\( a = 96/n \\)\n- \\( \\sum a_i^2 = n \\cdot a^2 = 144 \\)\n- \\( \\sum a_i^3 = n \\cdot a^3 = 216 \\)\n\nSo plugging \\( a = 96/n \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\( n \\cdot (96/n)^2 = 144 \\)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\( n \\cdot (9216/n^2) = 144 \\)\n\\( 9216/n = 144 \\)\nMultiply both sides by \\( n \\):\n9216 = 144n\nDivide both sides by 144:\nn = 9216 / 144\nLet me compute that: 144 goes into 9216 how many times? 144 * 64 = 9216 because 144 * 60 = 8640 and 144 * 4 = 576; 8640 + 576 = 9216.

            "output": "=64\\). Yep, that's an integer, so n=64.\n\nSo, when all terms are equal, n=64.\n\nBut the problem says \"sum of all possible values of n\". So that suggests that n=64 is the only possible value, but maybe there are other sequences where the sums still add up to 96, 144, 216 but with different n. Hmm, that's possible.\n\nWait, but if the terms are not all equal, is there a way to have different n's? For example, if n is different, so the average is different. Hmm.\n\nWait, but for a fixed n, can we have different sequences? Or is n fixed?\n\nWait, the problem seems to allow n to vary, such that for each n, there exists at least one sequence (possibly multiple) that satisfies the three sums. So we need to find all possible integer values of n (since n must be a positive integer, as it's the number of terms) for which such a sequence exists.\n\nSo perhaps n can be other values besides 64, depending on the distribution of the \\( a_i \\). So I need to find all positive integers n such that there exists a sequence \\( (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) \\) of positive real numbers where the sums are 96, 144, 216.\n\nSo how do I find such n?\n\nHmm. Let me recall that in probability theory, if we treat the sequence as probabilities, the sum is 1, but here the sum is 96, and all \\( a_i \\) are positive real numbers, so they can be scaled accordingly. But perhaps an approach using moments or Cauchy-Schwarz or other inequalities could limit the possible values of n.\n\nWait, another idea: If all the \\( a_i \\) are equal, as above, n must be 64. But if the \\( a_i \\) can vary, can n be different?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the relationship between the sums. Let me define S1 = 96, S2 = 144, S3=216.\n\nIf I treat these as the first three moments, perhaps I can use the inequality that relates them. Alternatively, perhaps I can use Cauchy-Schwarz or H\u00f6lder's inequality.\n\nWait, wait: the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality tells us that:\n\n\\( (\\sum a_i^2)(\\sum"

So n must be at least 64. So that gives a lower bound on n. So n \u226564.\n\nWait, so the minimal possible n is 64, which is achieved when all terms are equal. So that's the minimal n. But can n be larger?\n\nHmm, if n is larger than 64, then the terms would have to be smaller on average, but the sum of squares is fixed at 144. Wait, but if n increases, the average of the squares would decrease. Let me see.\n\nSuppose n is larger than 64. Let me think of an example. Suppose we have n=65. Then, to get the sum of a_i to be 96, the average would be 96/65 \u22481.4769. The sum of squares is 144, so the average of squares is 144/65 \u22482.215. The variance would be (average of squares) - (average)^2 \u22482.215 - (1.4769)^2 \u22482.215 - 2.181 \u22480.034. So that's possible, but can we have such a sequence?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if some terms are larger and some smaller, but keeping the total sum, sum of squares, and sum of cubes fixed. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum possible n is unbounded? But the sum of squares is fixed. If n increases, the terms have to get smaller, but their squares would have to add up to 144. However, the sum of cubes is 216. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an upper bound on n as well. Let me think.\n\nSuppose that all but one of the terms are very small, approaching zero, and one term is almost 96. Then the sum of squares would be approximately (96)^2"

So, y=96 -63*1.5=96 -94.5=1.5. So y=1.5, so all terms are 1.5, which satisfies the equations.\n\nWait, so that's the only solution when n=64. So, perhaps when n=64, the sequence must have all terms equal, so y=1.5. So that suggests that n=64 is a possible solution.\n\nNow, what if n=65? Let me see if I can find x and y such that the equations hold.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming.
