This gives me the first decimal digit.\n\nI'll continue this process, multiplying the remainder by 10 each time and dividing by 11111 to find each subsequent digit.\n\nAfter a few steps, I notice that the remainders start repeating. This indicates the start of a repeating decimal.\n\nOnce the repeating remainder is found, I'll determine the length of the repeating sequence by continuing the division until the remainder repeats.\n\nAfter performing all necessary steps, I find that the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is \\(0.\\overline{0000}\\), where \"0000\" repeats indefinitely.\n\nTherefore, the number of digits that repeat in the decimal is \\(4\\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) will result in a repeating decimal.\n   - We need to find the length of the repeating sequence.\n\n2. **Perform Long Division:**\n   - Divide 31 by 11111.\n   - Since 31 is less than 11111, the decimal starts with 0.\n   - Multiply 31 by 10 to get 310.\n   - Divide 310 by 11111 to find the first decimal digit.\n   - Repeat the process with the remainder to find subsequent digits.\n\n3. **Identify the Repeating Sequence:**\n   - Continue dividing until the remainder starts to repeat.\n   - Record the decimal digits up to the point where the remainder repeats.\n\n4. **Determine the Length of the Repeating Part:**\n   - Count the number of digits that repeat indefinitely in the decimal expansion.\n\n5. **Apply to the Given Fraction:**\n   - Performing the long division of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), we find that the decimal expansion is \\(0.\\overline{0000}\\).\n   - The repeating part is \"0000\".\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The repeating decimal \\("
