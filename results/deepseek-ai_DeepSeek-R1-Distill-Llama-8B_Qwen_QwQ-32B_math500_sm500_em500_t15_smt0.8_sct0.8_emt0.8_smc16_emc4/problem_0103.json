This is the common denominator for the left side of the equation.\n\nNext, I'll rewrite each fraction on the left side with the common denominator. This means multiplying the first fraction by \\((x + 8)\\) and the second fraction by \\((x - 3)\\).\n\nAfter expanding both fractions, I'll combine them by adding the numerators together. This gives me a single fraction with the denominator \\((x - 3)(x + 8)\\).\n\nNow, I'll set the numerator equal to the numerator on the right side of the equation, which is \\(4x - 23\\). This results in a linear equation:\n\n\\( (C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)) = 4x - 23 \\)\n\nTo find the values of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), I'll expand and collect like terms:\n\n\\( Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23 \\)\n\nCombining the \\(x\\) terms and constants separately, I get:\n\n\\( (C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23 \\)\n\nThis leads to a system of two equations by equating the coefficients of \\(x\\) and the constant terms:\n\n1. \\( C + D = 4 \\)\n2. \\( 8C - 3D = -23 \\)\n\nSolving this system, I'll use substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. From the first equation, \\( D = 4 - C \\). Substituting into the second equation:\n\n\\( 8C - 3(4 - C) = -23 \\)\n\nSimplify and solve for \\(C\\):\n\n\\( 8C - 12 + 3C = -23 \\)\n\\( 11C - 12 = -23 \\)\n\\( 11C = -11 \\)\n\\( C = -1 \\)\n\nOnce \\(C = -1\\) is found, substitute back to find \\(D\\):\n\n\\( D = 4 - (-1) = 5 \\)\n\nFinally, to find the product \\(CD\\), multiply the values of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\):\n\n\\( CD ="
