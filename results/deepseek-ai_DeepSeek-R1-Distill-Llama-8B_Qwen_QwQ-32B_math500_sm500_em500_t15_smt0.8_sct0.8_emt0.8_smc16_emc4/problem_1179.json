So we have the equation:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\)\n\nAnd we need to find the area of the convex polygon formed by its solutions in the complex plane. The area is supposed to be expressible in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime. Then, we have to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nHmm, okay. First, I remember that the solutions to a polynomial equation are the roots, and these roots can be represented as points in the complex plane. Since it's a fourth-degree equation, there should be four roots, which will form a convex quadrilateral. Maybe a square or some other quadrilateral, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nI think I need to find the roots of this equation. It's a quartic equation, which can be a bit tricky, but perhaps it can be factored or transformed into something more manageable.\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\)\n\nI notice that the coefficients seem to have a pattern. Let me write them out:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\( z^4 \\) is 1.\n2. The coefficient of \\( z^3 \\) is 4i.\n3. The coefficient of \\( z^2 \\) is -6.\n4. The coefficient of \\( z \\) is -4i.\n5. The constant term is -i.\n\nWait a minute, this looks similar to the expansion of some binomial expression. Maybe it's related to \\( (z + i)^4 \\) or something similar because the coefficients look like they might come from such an expansion.\n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem. For any binomial \\( (a + b)^n \\), the expansion is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k \\). So, if I can express the given polynomial as \\( (z + i)^4 \\) or something like that, I might be able to factor it easily.\n\nLet me try expanding \\( (z + i)^4 \\) to see if it matches:\n\n\\("
