Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the polynomial is of degree 8, and it's structured in a way that might suggest a substitution. The exponents are 8, 4, and 0, which are all multiples of 4. So maybe substituting \\( y = x^4 \\) would simplify things. Let me try that.\n\nSubstituting \\( y = x^4 \\), the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). That looks more manageable. Now, I can try to factor this quadratic in \\( y \\).\n\nLooking at \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\), I'm trying to find two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, this quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Therefore, substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), the polynomial factors into \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nNow, I have \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). Let's check if each of these quartic polynomials can be factored further over the integers.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 + 4 \\), I remember that this might be a biquadratic that can be factored into quadratics. Let me try expressing it as \\( (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) \\). Multiplying these out gives \\( x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd \\).\n\nComparing coefficients with \\( x^4 + 4 \\), we have:\n1. The coefficient of \\( x^3 \\) is 0, so \\( a + c = 0 \\).\n2. The coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is 0, so \\( ac + b + d = 0 \\).\n3. The coefficient"

Plugging into equation 3: \\( ad + b(-a) = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( a(d - b) = 0 \\). So either \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( d = b \\).\n\nIf \\( a = 0 \\), then \\( c = 0 \\), and equation 2 becomes \\( 0 + b + d = 0 \\), which implies \\( b = -d \\). But equation 4 says \\( bd = 4 \\). Substituting \\( d = -b \\), we get \\( b(-b) = -b^2 = 4 \\). However, \\( -b^2 \\) is negative, and 4 is positive, which is impossible. So \\( a \\) cannot be 0.\n\nTherefore, \\( d = b \\). Now, equation 4 becomes \\( b^2 = 4 \\), so \\( b = \\pm 2 \\).\n\nLet's try \\( b = 2 \\). Then \\( d = 2 \\).
