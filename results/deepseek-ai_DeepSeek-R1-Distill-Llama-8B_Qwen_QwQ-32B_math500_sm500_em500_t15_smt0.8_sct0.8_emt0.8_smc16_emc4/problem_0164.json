            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Let me write that down to make sure I have it right. It's the cube root symbol, so that means whatever is inside the symbol is raised to the power of 3. So, the equation is:\n\n\u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nHmm, I need to find the positive value of x that satisfies this. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that if there's a cube root of something equals a number, then that something must be the cube of that number. So, to get rid of the cube root, I can cube both sides of the equation. That should simplify things a bit. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I cube both sides, on the left side, the cube root will cancel out because (cube root of a)^3 is just a. And on the right side, it's 16 cubed. Let's compute that. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16... Wait, what's 256 times 16? Let me calculate that. 256 * 10 is 2560, and 256 * 6 is 1536, so adding those together gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, 16 cubed is 4096. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations are of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so I need to rearrange this equation to that standard form. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides to move it to the left side.\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\nSimplifying that, 4 minus 4096 is -4092, so the equation is:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\nHmm, okay, so I have x squared minus 4x minus 4092 equals zero. Now, I need to solve for x. Since it's a quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula, which is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over 2a.\n\n"

            "output": "In this equation, a is 1, because the coefficient of x squared is 1. b is -4, because the coefficient of x is -4. And c is -4092. Let me write that down:\n\na = 1\nb = -4\nc = -4092\n\nSo, plugging into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [ -(-4) \u00b1 \u221a( (-4)^2 - 4*1*(-4092) ) ] / (2*1)\n\nSimplify the numerator first. The negative of negative 4 is 4. So, the numerator starts as 4. Then inside the square root, let's compute the discriminant: (-4)^2 is 16, and then minus 4 times 1 times (-4092). So that's 16 - (4 * -4092). Wait, 4 times -4092 is -16368. So, 16 minus (-16368) is the same as 16 + 16368, which equals 16384.\n\nSo, the square root part becomes \u221a16384. Now, what is the square root of 16384? Hmm, 128 squared is 16384 because 128*128. Let me check: 130 squared is 16900, which is too big. 120 squared is 14400, still too big. 128*128: 120*120 is 14400, 8*120 is 960, 8*8 is 64. So, (120 + 8)^2 = 120\u00b2 + 2*120*8 + 8\u00b2 = 14400 + 1920 + 64 = 14400 + 1984 = 16384. Yes, that works. So, \u221a16384 is 128.\n\nSo, the numerator becomes 4 \u00b1 128, and the denominator is 2*1, which is 2.\n\nSo, now we have two possible solutions:\n\nx = (4 + 128)/2 and x = (4 - 128)/2\n\nLet's compute both.\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128) = 132; 132 / 2 = 66.\n\nSecond solution: (4 - 128) = -124; -124 / 2 = -62.\n\nSo, the two solutions are x = 66 and x = -62.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the positive value"

            "output": " of x. So, x = 66 is the solution we're looking for.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation:\n\n\u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nCubing both sides gives x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 16\u00b3 = 4096, which leads to the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula with a=1, b=-4, c=-4092.\n\nDiscriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nSquare root of discriminant is 128. So, x = [4 \u00b1 128]/2, which gives 66 and -62. Positive solution is 66. That seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe plug x=66 back into the original equation and see if it works.\n\nCompute x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 when x=66: 66\u00b2 is 4356, 4x is 264, so 4356 - 264 + 4.\n\n4356 - 264: Let's subtract 200 from 4356 to get 4156, then subtract 64 more to reach 4092. Then, 4092 + 4 = 4096.\n\nSo, the cube root of 4096 is 16, which matches the original equation. So, yes, x=66 is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's check x=-62 as well, even though the problem asks for positive. For x=-62:\n\nCompute x\u00b2 - 4x + 4: (-62)^2 is 3844, 4x is -248, so 3844 - (-248) +4 = 3844 + 248 +4 = 3844 + 252 = 4096. So, same result, cube root of 4096 is 16. So, x=-62 is also a solution.\n\nBut since the question asks for the positive value, 66 is the one to report.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cube both sides** to eliminate the cube root:\n  "
