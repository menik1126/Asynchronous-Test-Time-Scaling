Let Denali's pay be \\( D \\) and Nate's pay be \\( N \\). The ratio is \\( \\frac{D}{N} = \\frac{16}{12} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{D}{N} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nNow, consider the first scenario where Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs and Nate stays at 12 dogs. Denali's total dogs become \\( 16 + 4x \\) and Nate's remains 12. The new ratio of pays would be \\( \\frac{D'}{N} = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\). Setting this equal to the original ratio gives \\( \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\).\n\nSolving for \\( x \\) in this equation: Multiply both sides by 12 to get \\( 16 + 4x = 16 \\), then subtract 16 from both sides to find \\( 4x = 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( x = 0 \\). However, since \\( x \\neq 0 \\), this scenario doesn't provide a valid solution.\n\nFinally, I'll analyze the second scenario where \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. Denali's total dogs become \\( 16 + x \\) and Nate's become \\( 12 - x \\). The new ratio of pays is \\( \\frac{D''}{N'} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\). Setting this equal to the original ratio gives \\( \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\).\n\nSolving for \\( x \\) in this equation: Cross-multiplying gives \\( 4(12 - x) = 3(16 + x) \\), which simplifies to \\( 48 - 4x = 48 + 3x \\). Combining like terms yields \\( -7x = 0 \\), so \\( x = 0 \\). Again, since \\( x \\neq 0 \\), this scenario also doesn't provide a valid solution.\n\nSince neither"

The company assigns or unassigns new dogs in groups of \\( x \\) dogs. We need to find the value of \\( x \\) (where \\( x \\neq 0 \\)) such that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same under two different scenarios:\n\n1. **First Scenario:** Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, and Nate continues to walk 12 dogs.\n2. **Second Scenario:** \\( x \\) dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Ratios**\n\nLet \\( D \\) be Denali's pay and \\( N \\) be Nate's pay. Initially, the ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{D}{N} = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the First Scenario**\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali walks \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs, and Nate continues to walk 12 dogs. The new ratio becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{D'}{N} = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12}\n\\]\n\nSince the ratio remains the same:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 12:\n\n\\[\n16 + 4x = 16\n\\]\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4x = 0 \\implies x = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, since \\( x \\neq 0 \\), this scenario does not provide a valid solution.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Scenario**\n\nIn the second scenario, \\( x \\) dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali. Denali now walks \\( 16 + x \\) dogs, and Nate walks \\( 12 - x \\) dogs. The new ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{D''}{N'} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nSince the ratio remains the same:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{16"

Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
