            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So P(x) looks like x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c for some coefficients a, b, c.\n\nThe problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when it's divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5. We need to find P(5).\n\nHmm, so let me think about polynomial division and remainders. I remember that when you divide a polynomial by a quadratic, the remainder is linear, right? So R(x) should be of the form mx + n. Similarly, 2R(x) would be 2mx + 2n.\n\nSince P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is a quadratic, the remainder R(x) must satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, P(1) should equal R(1), and P(4) should equal R(4). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nAlso, since P(0) = 5, plugging x = 0 into P(x) gives us 5. So that's useful information.\n\nLet me write down the information step by step.\n\n1. P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x), where Q1(x) is some polynomial.\n2. P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x), where Q2(x) is some polynomial.\n3. P(0) = 5.\n\nFrom 1, evaluating at x = 1 and x = 4 gives:\n- P(1) = R(1)\n- P(4) = R(4)\n\nFrom 2, evaluating at x = 2 and x = 3 gives:\n- P(2) = 2R(2)\n- P(3) = 2R("

Then 2R(x) = 2rx + 2s.\n\nSo from P(1) = R(1) = r*1 + s = r + s,\nP(4) = R(4) = r*4 + s = 4r + s,\nP(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(r*2 + s) = 4r + 2s,\nP(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(r*3 + s) = 6r + 2s.\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1. P(1) = r + s\n2. P(4) = 4r + s\n3. P(2) = 4r + 2s\n4. P(3) = 6r + 2s\n\nBut I also know that P(0) = 5.\n\nSince P(x) is a cubic polynomial, it's determined by four coefficients (a, b, c). Wait, but it's monic, so the coefficient of x\u00b3 is 1, so P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + c. So the coefficients are a, b, c, which are three unknowns. But I have four conditions (from P(1), P(4), P(2), P(3)) plus P(0)=5, which is five equations. Hmm, seems overdetermined. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that R(x) is the same in both cases, so I can express P(1), P(4), P(2), P(3) in terms of r and s, then use P(0)=5 to solve for r and s, and then find P(5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write P(x) in terms of R(x) for the different divisors.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Since (x - 1)(x - 4) divides P(x) with remainder R(x), then P(1) = R(1), P(4) = R(4). Similarly, (x - 2)(x - 3) divides P(x) with remainder 2R(x), so P(2)"
