The problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). And when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, I know that \\( P(0) = 5 \\). I need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling what I know about polynomials and remainders. When a polynomial is divided by a quadratic polynomial (which is what \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) and \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\) are), the remainder will be a linear polynomial, right? So \\( R(x) \\) must be of the form \\( ax + b \\).\n\nSince \\( P(x) \\) is a monic polynomial of degree 3, I can express it as:\n\\[ P(x) = x^3 + c x^2 + d x + e \\]\nwhere \\( c \\), \\( d \\), and \\( e \\) are constants I need to find.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to approach this using the Remainder Theorem. I remember that if you divide a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) by \\( (x - k) \\), the remainder is \\( P(k) \\). But here, we're dividing by a quadratic, so the remainder is linear as I thought.\n\nLet me define \\( R(x) = m x + n \\). Then, according to the problem:\n1. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) = m x + n \\).\n2. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) = 2m x + 2n \\).\n\nSince these are the remainders, for the division by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), I can say:\n\\[ P(1) = R(1) = m(1) + n = m + n \\]\n\\[ P(4"

Since \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, it has four coefficients. Wait, but \\( P(x) \\) is monic, so the leading coefficient is 1, so I can write it as \\( P(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c \\). Then, knowing \\( P(0) = 5 \\) tells me that \\( c = 5 \\).\n\nSo, let me write that down:\n\\[ P(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + 5 \\]\n\nNow, I can compute \\( P(1) \\), \\( P(2) \\), \\( P(3) \\), \\( P(4) \\) using this expression.\n\nLet's compute each:\n1. \\( P(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = a + b + 6 \\)\n2. \\( P(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = 4a + 2b + 13 \\)\n3. \\( P(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 = 9a + 3b + 32 \\)\n4. \\( P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 16a + 4b + 69 \\)\n\nNow, let's set these equal to the equations I had from the remainders.\n\nEquation 1: \\( a + b"
