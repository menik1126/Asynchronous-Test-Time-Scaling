            "output": "To find the least sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime components.\n\nFirst, 84 can be broken down into 84 = 2 × 42. Continuing the factorization, 42 = 2 × 21, and further, 21 = 3 × 7. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nNext, I'll aim to distribute these prime factors into distinct integers such that their product remains 84. The goal is to minimize the sum. \n\nI'll consider the factors of 84: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 84. Since we want distinct integers and the least sum, starting with smaller factors makes sense.\n\nUsing the smallest possible factors, I'll start with 1. However, including 1 doesn't affect the product but adds to the sum. So, it's better to exclude 1 to minimize the sum.\n\nNow, choosing 2, 3, and 7 gives me a product of 42, which is less than 84. To reach the product of 84, I need to multiply these by 2. However, including 2 twice would mean I have 2 as a repeated integer, which isn't allowed.\n\nTo avoid repetition, I'll instead multiply the factors differently. If I include 2, 3, and 7, I'm at 42. To get to 84, I need to multiply by 2 again, but since I can't repeat 2, I'll look for another combination.\n\nAn alternative approach is to include 3, 4, and 7. Their product is 84, and each is a distinct integer. The sum of these numbers is 3 + 4 + 7, which equals 14.\n\nComparing this to the previous attempt, the sum of 14 is smaller than 15. Therefore, the combination of 3, 4, and 7 provides the least sum while maintaining the product of 84 with distinct integers.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll find a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84 and determine the combination that yields the smallest possible sum.\n\n1. **Factorize 84**:\n   \\[\n   84 ="
