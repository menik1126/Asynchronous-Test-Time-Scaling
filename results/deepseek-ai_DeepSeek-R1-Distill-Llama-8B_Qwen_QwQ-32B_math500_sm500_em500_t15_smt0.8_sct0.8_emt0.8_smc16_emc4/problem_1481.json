            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: the cube root of the square root of the square root of 1/729. That sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the expression: it's a nested radical, right? So we have a cube root inside a square root inside another square root. Let me write that down to visualize it better: \u221b(\u221a(\u221a(1/729))). Hmm, that might be easier to tackle if I work from the inside out.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: \u221a(1/729). So what's the square root of 1 over 729? Well, \u221a1 is 1, so it's 1 over \u221a729. Now, 729 seems like a number I recognize. Let me think\u20149 times 9 is 81, 81 times 9 is 729. So 729 is 9^3, which is also 3^6 because 9 is 3 squared, so (3^2)^3 = 3^(2*3) = 3^6. So \u221a729 is \u221a(3^6). The square root of something squared is the base, so that would be 3^(6/2) = 3^3 = 27. So \u221a729 is 27. Therefore, \u221a(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nOkay, so now the expression becomes \u221b(\u221a(1/27)). Let me work on the next layer: \u221a(1/27). Again, \u221a1 is 1, so it's 1 over \u221a27. Wait, what's \u221a27? 27 is 3^3, so \u221a27 is \u221a(3^3). That can be written as 3^(3/2) or 3\u221a3. So \u221a27 is 3\u221a3. Therefore, \u221a(1/27) is 1/(3\u221a3).\n\nNow, the expression is \u221b(1/(3\u221a3)). Let me focus on the cube root of that. So the cube root of 1 divided by (3\u221a3). I can write this as (1/(3\u221a3))^(1/3). To make this easier, maybe I can express the denominator with a rational denominator first. Remember, rationalizing the denominator means getting rid of the square"

Let's see:\n\n1/(3\u221a3) * (\u221a3/\u221a3) = \u221a3/(3*3) = \u221a3/9. Wait, so \u221a(1/27) simplifies to \u221a3/9? Let me check that again. \n\nOriginal: \u221a(1/27) = 1/\u221a27 = 1/(3\u221a3). Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a3: (1*\u221a3)/(3\u221a3*\u221a3) = \u221a3/(3*3) = \u221a3/9. Yes, that's correct. So \u221a(1/27) is \u221a3/9. \n\nTherefore, the next step is the cube root of \u221a3/9. Let me write that as (\u221a3/9)^(1/3). Hmm, maybe it's better to express everything in exponents with the same base. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \u221a3 is 3^(1/2), and 9 is 3^2. So substituting those in, we have (3^(1/2) / 3^2)^(1/3). \n\nUsing exponent rules, when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents: 3^(1/2 - 2) = 3^(-3/2). So the expression becomes (3^(-3/2))^(1/3). \n\nNow, when raising a power to another power, you multiply the exponents: (-3/2)*(1/3) = (-1/2). So that simplifies to 3^(-1/2). \n\nHmm, 3^(-1/2) is the same as 1/(3^(1/2)) which is 1/\u221a3. But the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator. So 1/\u221a3 needs to be rationalized. \n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a3 gives (\u221a3)/(\u221a3 * \u221a3) = \u221a3/3. \n\nWait, so putting it all together, the cube root of \u221a3/9 is 1/\u221a3, which simplifies to \u221a3/3."

Then the next layer is \u221a(1/27) = \u221a3/9. Then taking the cube root of that: (\u221a3/9)^(1/3). \n\nExpressing \u221a3 as 3^(1/2) and 9 as 3^2, so 3^(1/2 - 2) = 3^(-3/2). Then raising that to the 1/3 power gives 3^(-1/2), which is 1/\u221a3. Rationalizing, we get \u221a3/3. \n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to double-check, let me compute each step numerically. \n\n1/729 is approximately 0.001371742. Taking the square root: \u221a0.001371742 \u2248 0.037037. Then the cube root of that: cube root of 0.037037 \u2248 0.32999, which is roughly 1/3. But when I compute \u221a3/3, that's about 1.732/3 \u2248 0.577, which doesn't match 0.32999. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let's try computing each step again. \n\nWait, no, 1/729 is indeed 1 over 3^6, so \u221a(1/729) is 1/27, as we had. Then \u221a(1/27) is 1/(3\u221a3), which is \u221a3/9 as we saw. Then taking the cube root of that: (\u221a3/9)^(1/3).\n\nWait, let me compute that numerically:\n\n\u221a3 \u2248 1.732, so \u221a3/9 \u2248 0.19245. The cube root of 0.19245 is approximately 0.574. But \u221a3/3 \u2248 0.577, so that seems close. Wait, maybe my initial decimal approximation was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express everything as exponents of 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 1/729: that's 3^-6. Then the square root:"

Then the cube root of that: (3^(-3/2))^(1/3) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/\u221a3 = \u221a3/3. \n\nAh, so that's the same result. But when I computed numerically, I thought there was a discrepancy, but maybe I messed up the steps. Let me recalculate:\n\nOriginal expression: sqrt( cube root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nWait, actually, the original problem is sqrt( cube root( sqrt(1/729) ) )? Wait, hold on, the original question is written as sqrt{ \\sqrt[3]{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{729} } } }, so the order is sqrt of (cube root of (sqrt(1/729))). \n\nWait, so let me parse that again:\n\nFirst, sqrt(1/729) = 1/27. Then cube root of that is (1/27)^(1/3). Since 27 is 3^3, so (1/27)^(1/3) = 1/3. Then the square root of that is sqrt(1/3) = 1/\u221a3 = \u221a3/3. Wait, that's different from my previous steps. Wait, did I misinterpret the order?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I messed up the order of operations. Let me check the original problem again:\n\nThe question is: sqrt{ \\sqrt[3]{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{729} } } }\n\nSo the innermost is sqrt(1/729). Then the cube root of that result, then the square root of that. So the order is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nWait, so let me redo the steps with correct order:\n\nStart with sqrt(1/729) = 1/27. Then take the cube root of that: (1/27)^(1/3) = 1/"

Then take the square root of 1/3: sqrt(1/3) = 1/\u221a3, which is \u221a3/3.\n\nAh, so that's different from my initial analysis because I thought the outermost operation was square root then cube root, but no, according to the TeX code, it's sqrt{ \\sqrt[3]{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{729} } } }, so the order is sqrt(cbrt(sqrt(1/729))).\n\nSo in that case, the first step is sqrt(1/729) = 1/27. Then cbrt(1/27) = 1/3. Then sqrt(1/3) = \u221a3/3.\n\nSo in this case, perhaps my initial mistake was miscalculating the order of operations. So that changes things.\n\nSo now, with the correct order, the result is \u221a3/3, which is approximately 0.577. If I compute numerically:\n\nsqrt(1/729) = 1/27 \u2248 0.037037. Then cube root of that is (0.037037)^(1/3) \u2248 0.33. Then square root of that \u2248 0.574, which is close to \u221a3/3 \u2248 0.577. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong before? In my initial first approach, I thought the outermost operation was the cube root, but no, according to the problem, it's the square root that's outside. So the correct order is sqrt( cbrt( sqrt(1/729) ) ), which gives us \u221a3/3.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Compute sqrt(1/729) = 1/27.\n2. Compute cbrt(1/27) = 1/3.\n3. Compute sqrt(1/3) = \u221a3/3.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form with a rational denominator is \u221a3/3.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I had different steps, but I think that was because I misread the order of the operations. So the correct way is indeed to compute from the inside out, with the cube root in the middle.\n\nSo, final answer: \u221a3\u20443.\n\nWait, let me confirm using exponents:\n\n1/729 = (3^6)^-1 = 3^-"
