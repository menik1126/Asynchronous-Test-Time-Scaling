            "output": "Alright, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of (5 over root 80 plus sqrt 845 over 9 plus sqrt 45) all divided by sqrt 5. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me write it down more clearly to visualize it better.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\u221a[(5/\u221a80 + \u221a845 / 9 + \u221a45) / \u221a5]\n\nOkay, the goal is to simplify this to a simplified fraction. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are square roots in numerators and denominators. Maybe I can simplify each square root term before dealing with the entire expression. Let me look at each term inside the big square root.\n\nStarting with 5/\u221a80. I can simplify \u221a80 because 80 is not a prime number. Let me factor 80: 80 is 16 times 5, right? 16 is a perfect square, so \u221a80 = \u221a(16\u00d75) = \u221a16 \u00d7 \u221a5 = 4\u221a5. So 5/\u221a80 becomes 5/(4\u221a5).\n\nWait, 5/(4\u221a5) might be further simplified. Since there's a \u221a5 in the denominator, maybe I can rationalize it. To do that, I can multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a5. So:\n\n(5 \u00d7 \u221a5) / (4\u221a5 \u00d7 \u221a5) = (5\u221a5)/(4\u00d75) = (5\u221a5)/20.\n\nSimplifying that, 5 and 20 can be divided by 5: 5/20 = 1/4, so it becomes \u221a5 / 4.\n\nSo, the first term simplifies to \u221a5 / 4.\n\nNext term: \u221a845 / 9. Let me simplify \u221a845. 845 divided by 5 is 169, so 845 = 5 \u00d7 169. 169 is 13 squared, so \u221a845 = \u221a(5\u00d713\u00b2) = \u221a5 \u00d7 13 = 13\u221a5. Therefore, \u221a845 / 9 = 13\u221a5 / 9.\n\nSo the second term is 13\u221a5 / 9.\n\nThird term: \u221a45. Let me simplify that. 45 is 9\u00d75, so \u221a45 = \u221a(9\u00d75) = 3\u221a5.\n\nSo, \u221a45 is 3\u221a5.\n\n"

            "output": "Now, let's rewrite the expression with these simplifications:\n\n\u221a[(\u221a5 / 4 + 13\u221a5 / 9 + 3\u221a5) / \u221a5]\n\nHmm, now all the terms inside the numerator have \u221a5. That's helpful because I can factor that out or find a common denominator. Let me write them out:\n\n\u221a5 / 4 + 13\u221a5 / 9 + 3\u221a5\n\nLet me factor out \u221a5 from each term:\n\n\u221a5 (1/4 + 13/9 + 3)\n\nWait, 3 can be written as 3/1. So, let me convert all these fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) would be 36.\n\nSo, converting each term:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = 52/36\n\n3/1 = 108/36\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169. So, 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the numerator simplifies to \u221a5 \u00d7 (169/36) = (169\u221a5)/36.\n\nSo now, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\u221a[(169\u221a5 / 36) / \u221a5]\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n\u221a[(169\u221a5) / (36\u221a5)]\n\nBecause dividing by \u221a5 is the same as multiplying by 1/\u221a5.\n\nSimplify the numerator and denominator: \u221a5 cancels out.\n\nSo, we have \u221a[(169 / 36)]\n\nWhich is \u221a169 divided by \u221a36, which is 13/6.\n\nWait, hold on. So, the expression simplifies to 13/6.\n\nWait, let me retrace to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step.\n\nFirst term: 5/\u221a80 became \u221a5/4. Correct.\n\nSecond term: \u221a845 became 13\u221a5, so 13\u221a5 /9. Correct.\n\nThird term: \u221a45 became 3\u221a5. Correct.\n\nAdding them together: \u221a5/4 + 13\u221a5/9 + 3\u221a5.\n\nFactor out \u221a5: \u221a5 (1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Correct.\n\nConvert to common denominator: 36.\n\n1/4 is 9/36, 13/9"

Correct.\n\nSo, \u221a5 \u00d7 169/36 is 169\u221a5 / 36.\n\nThen, dividing that by \u221a5: (169\u221a5 / 36) / \u221a5 = 169/36.\n\nTaking the square root of that: \u221a(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nSo, yeah, 13/6 is the simplified fraction.\n\nWait a second, that seems straightforward, but let me just check the initial step.\n\nWait, is 5/\u221a80 equal to \u221a5 /4? Let me recalculate.\n\n5 / \u221a80. \u221a80 is 4\u221a5, so 5/(4\u221a5). Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a5: (5\u221a5)/(4\u00d75) = \u221a5 /4. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, \u221a845: 13\u00b2 is 169, 169\u00d75 is 845, so yes, \u221a845 is 13\u221a5.

So, 13 and 6 have no common factors, so that's the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if I can represent 13/6 as a mixed number, but the question asks for a fraction, so 13/6 is fine.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is simplified step-by-step as follows:\n\n1. **Simplify each square root term:**\n   - \\( \\sqrt{80} = 4\\sqrt{5} \\) so \\( \\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4} \\).\n   - \\( \\sqrt{845} = 13\\sqrt{5} \\) so \\( \\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9} = \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9} \\).\n   - \\( \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5} \\).\n\n2. **Combine the terms inside the numerator:**\n   - \\( \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4} + \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\\"
