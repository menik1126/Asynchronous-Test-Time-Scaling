Then, express that distance as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Finally, I have to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. The smallest distance from the origin to a point on the graph is essentially the shortest distance from the origin to any point on that curve. Since the graph is a function, every point on it can be represented as \\( (x, y) \\) where \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\).\n\nI remember that the distance from a point \\( (x, y) \\) to the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) is given by the distance formula: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). So, to find the minimum distance, I probably need to minimize this expression with respect to \\( x \\).\n\nBut wait, since we have \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), I can substitute that into the distance formula. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the distance squared as \\( D \\). Since the square root function is increasing, minimizing \\( D \\) will also minimize the distance. So, perhaps I can work with \\( D \\) instead of dealing with the square root, which might make the differentiation easier.\n\nSo, \\( D = x^2 + y^2 \\). Substituting \\( y \\):\n\\( D = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\).\n\nLet me simplify that.\n\nFirst, let me square the \\( y \\) term:\n\\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\).\n\nSo, now \\( D = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\).\n\nHmm,"

Since \\( D \\) is a function of \\( x \\), I can take its derivative with respect to \\( x \\) and set it equal to zero. That will give me the critical points, which I can then test to find the minimum.\n\nSo, let's compute the derivative \\( D' \\).\n\nFirst, write \\( D = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\).\n\nThe derivative of \\( \\frac{1}{2}x^4 \\) is \\( 2x^3 \\).\nThe derivative of \\( -2x^2 \\) is \\( -4x \\).\nThe derivative of \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) is 0.\n\nSo, \\( D' = 2x^3 - 4x \\).\n\nSet \\( D' = 0 \\):\n\\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \\).\n\nFactor out \\( 2x \\):\n\\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, the critical points are:\n1. \\( 2x = 0 \\) => \\( x = 0 \\).\n2. \\( x^2 - 2 = 0 \\) => \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) or \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nOkay, now we need"

So, the distance is from the origin to this parabola. The minimal distance should be somewhere along the curve.\n\nWait, another approach: The distance from a point to a curve can be found by solving for the point where the line connecting the origin to that point is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve at that point.\n\nSo, maybe I can use that condition.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me denote a general point on the curve as \\( (x, y) = (x, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)) \\).\n\nThe gradient of the curve at that point is given by the derivative dy/dx.\n\nCompute dy/dx:\n\n\\( dy/dx = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} * 2x = \\frac{2x}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}x \\).\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at any point \\( x \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2}x \\).\n\nThe slope of the line connecting the origin to the point \\( (x, y) \\) is \\( y/x \\), which is \\( \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)}{x} = \\frac{x^2 - 3}{\\sqrt{2} x} \\).\n\nFor the distance to be minimal, the line connecting the origin to the point should be perpendicular to the tangent line at that point.
