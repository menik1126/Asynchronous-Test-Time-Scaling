I remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric equations involving multiple variables, it's helpful to use symmetric sums or Vieta's formulas. Maybe I can relate these equations to the roots of a polynomial.\n\nLet me denote \\( S = x + y + z \\), \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\). These are the standard symmetric sums. Also, I remember that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( S \\), \\( P \\), and \\( Q \\). The formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S^3 - 3SP + 3Q \\)\n\nGiven that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\) and \\( Q = 4 \\), plugging into the formula gives:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3SP + 3(4) \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3SP + 12 \\)\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\( -8 = S^3 - 3SP \\)\n\nSo, \\( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \\). I'll keep this in mind.\n\nNow, looking at the third equation:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nI can try to factor or rewrite this expression to see if it relates to the symmetric sums. Let me factor terms:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \\)\nSimilarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \\)\nAnd \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \\)\n\nSo, the third equation can be written as:\n\n\\( xy(x"

Let me expand each term:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) = x^2 y + xy^2 \\)\nSimilarly for the others. So, the whole expression is just the given third equation, which is 12.\n\nBut perhaps I can factor this differently. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of symmetric sums.\n\nWait, another approach: I recall that \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y + 3xyz \\)\n\nSo, if I write that out:\n\n\\( S \\times P = (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) + 3xyz \\)\n\nNotice that the expression in the third equation is \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z \\), which is exactly \\( x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y \\). Therefore, the third equation can be written as:\n\n\\( (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12 \\)\n\nComparing this to \\( S \\times P \\), we have:\n\n\\( S \\times P = 12 + 3xyz \\)\n\nBut since \\( xyz = 4 \\), substituting gives:\n\n\\( S \\times P = 12 + 3(4) = 12 + 12 = 24 \\)\n\nSo, \\( S \\times P = 24 \\). So now I have two equations involving S and P:\n\n1. \\( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \\)\n2. \\( S \\times P = 24 \\)\n\nHmm, so from equation 2, \\( P = 24 / S \\), assuming \\( S \\neq 0 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( P = 24/S"
