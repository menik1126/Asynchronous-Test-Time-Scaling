It's a bit tricky, but I'll take it slowly.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem:\n\nWe have a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083, and so on. The sequence has two properties:\n\n1. For every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is a geometric sequence. So, that means each of these three terms is a geometric progression. Since it's a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms must be constant. Let me denote r_k as the common ratio for the k-th geometric subsequence.\n\n2. For every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let me denote d_k as the common difference for the k-th arithmetic subsequence.\n\nGiven that a\u2081\u2083 = 2016, we need to find a\u2081.\n\nLet me break down the problem. Since the sequence is strictly increasing and consists of positive integers, all terms must be positive, and each term is larger than the previous one.\n\nLet's write down what we know for the first few terms using the given properties.\n\nStarting with k = 1:\n\n- The geometric subsequence a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083. So, a\u2082 = a\u2081 * r\u2081, and a\u2083 = a\u2082 * r\u2081 = a\u2081 * r\u2081\u00b2.\n  \n- The arithmetic subsequence a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084. So, a\u2083 = a\u2082 + d\u2081, and a\u2084 = a\u2083 + d\u2081 = a\u2082 + 2d\u2081.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 2:\n\n- The geometric subsequence a\u2083, a\u2084, a\u2085. So, a\u2084 = a\u2083 * r\u2082, and a\u2085 = a\u2084 * r\u2082 = a\u2083 * r\u2082\u00b2.\n  \n- The arithmetic subsequence a\u2084, a\u2085, a\u2086. So, a\u2085 = a\u2084 + d\u2082, and a\u2086 = a\u2085 + d\u2082 = a\u2084 + 2d\u2082.\n\nFor k = 3:\n\n- The geometric subsequence a\u2085, a\u2086,"

So, a\u2088\u00b2 = a\u2087 a\u2089 => a\u2089 = a\u2088\u00b2 / a\u2087\n\nBut a\u2088, a\u2089, a\u2081\u2080 form an arithmetic sequence: a\u2089 = a\u2088 + d\u2084, a\u2081\u2080 = a\u2089 + d\u2084 = a\u2088 + 2 d\u2084.\n\nThis is getting very complicated.
