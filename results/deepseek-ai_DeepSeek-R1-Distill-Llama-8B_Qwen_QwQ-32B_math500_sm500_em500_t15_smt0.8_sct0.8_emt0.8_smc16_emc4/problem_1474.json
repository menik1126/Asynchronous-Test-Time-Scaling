            "output": "First, I notice that the expression involves multiple layers of roots: a cube root and two square roots. To simplify this, I'll start by addressing the innermost radical.\n\nThe innermost expression is the square root of 1 divided by 729. I know that \u221a(1/729) can be simplified by recognizing that 729 is equal to 9 raised to the power of 6, since 9^6 equals 531441, which is larger than 729. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that. Actually, 9^3 is 729. So, \u221a(1/9^3) is equal to 1 over 9^(3/2), which is the same as (1/9) raised to the power of 3/2.\n\nNext, I need to address the cube root of (1/9)^(3/2). Taking the cube root is the same as raising the expression to the power of 1/3. So, ( (1/9)^(3/2) )^(1/3) simplifies to (1/9)^(1/2), which is equal to 1 over the square root of 9, or 1/3.\n\nFinally, I have the square root of 1/3. Taking the square root of the expression 1 divided by 3 is the same as the square root of 1 divided by the square root of 3, which is \u221a1 divided by \u221a3, or simply 1 over \u221a3.\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by \u221a3, resulting in \u221a3 over 3.\n\nTherefore, after simplifying each layer of the radicals step by step, the final answer is \u221a3 divided by 3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify and write the result with a rational denominator, we'll break down each step of the given expression:\n\n**Original Expression:**\n$$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the innermost radical (square root).**\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}$$\n*Explanation:* Since \\( \\sqrt{729} = 27 \\), the square root of \\( \\frac{1}{729} \\) is \\( \\frac"
