Mr. Brennan wants to select 3 boys from these 7.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7 using the combination formula: C(7,3).\n\nThen, I'll move on to the girls. There are 4 girls in the class, and Mr. Brennan needs to select 2 of them. I'll use the combination formula again: C(4,2).\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to form the group, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls: C(7,3) * C(4,2).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll use combinations since the order in which the students are chosen does not matter. \n\n**Step 1: Choose 3 boys out of 7**\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Choose 2 girls out of 4**\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two combinations to find the total number of ways**\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick the group is \\(\\boxed{210}\\)."
