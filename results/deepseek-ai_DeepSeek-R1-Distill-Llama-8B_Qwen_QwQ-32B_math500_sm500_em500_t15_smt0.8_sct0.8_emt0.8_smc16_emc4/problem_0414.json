            "output": "I need to determine after how many seconds both gears will have their marks pointing due north again.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many minutes each gear takes to complete one full revolution.\n\nFor the first gear, it turns 33 and 1/3 times in one minute. To find the time for one revolution, I'll divide the total turns by the number of turns per minute.\n\nSo, 33 1/3 revolutions per minute divided by 33 1/3 revolutions per revolution equals 1 minute per revolution.\n\nThe second gear turns 45 times in one minute. Similarly, dividing 45 revolutions per minute by 45 revolutions per revolution gives 1 minute per revolution.\n\nBoth gears complete one full revolution in 1 minute. However, their marks will align due north more frequently depending on their rotational speeds.\n\nNext, I'll determine their least common multiple of their periods to find when they'll both be pointing north simultaneously.\n\nSince both gears have a period of 1 minute, their least common multiple is 1 minute.\n\nFinally, converting 1 minute to seconds, I multiply by 60, resulting in 60 seconds.\n\nSo, both gears will next have their marks pointing due north after 60 seconds.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n- **Gear A** turns \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) times in a minute.\n- **Gear B** turns \\( 45 \\) times in a minute.\n- Initially, both gears have a mark pointing **due north**.\n- We need to find after how many seconds both gears will **next** have their marks pointing due north.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Rotational Speeds:**\n   - **Gear A** makes \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) full rotations per minute.\n   - **Gear B** makes \\( 45 \\) full rotations per minute.\n\n2. **Convert Rotations to Periodicity:**\n   - The time it takes for a gear to complete **1 full rotation** can be calculated by dividing the number of rotations per minute by the number of rotations per revolution:\n     - For **Gear A**: \n       \\[\n       \\text{Period}_A = \\frac{33\\frac{1}{3}}{33\\frac{1}{3}} = 1 \\text{ minute per revolution}\n       \\]\n     - For **Gear B**:"
