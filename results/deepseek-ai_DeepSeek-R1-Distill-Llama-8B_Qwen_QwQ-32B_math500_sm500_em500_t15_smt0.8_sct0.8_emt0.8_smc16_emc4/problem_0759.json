The problem gives me a specific condition involving the terms of the sequence: for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Also, I know that a\u2081\u2083 = 2016, and I need to find a\u2081.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, let me recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences mean. A geometric sequence has each term multiplied by a constant ratio, while an arithmetic sequence has each term added by a constant difference. So, for the first part, a geometric subsequence: for each k, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} = r * a_{2k}, and a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d. Wait, no, the arithmetic part is a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d and then a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d.\n\nBut let me think again. For the geometric subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, that means:\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r_k,\n\nand\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k.\n\nSo each of these geometric subsequences is three terms where each term is multiplied by the same ratio r_k.\n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic subsequences a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, that means:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k,\n\nand\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k.\n\nSo, each term after a_{2k} is the previous term plus some common difference d_k.\n\nBut here's the thing: for each k, these two properties hold. So, for k=1, the first three terms a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083 form a geometric sequence. Then, for k=1,"

So the sequence alternates between geometric and arithmetic subsequences every two terms?\n\nWait, actually, let me parse the problem again. The problem says \"for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric\" and \"the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic\". So for each k, the triplet starting at the odd index 2k-1 is geometric, and the triplet starting at the even index 2k is arithmetic. So, overlapping triplets?\n\nYes, so for example, when k=1, the first triplet is a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083 (geometric), and the second triplet starting at a\u2082 is a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084 (arithmetic). Then for k=2, the triplet starting at a\u2083 is a\u2083, a\u2084, a\u2085 (geometric), and the triplet starting at a\u2084 is a\u2084, a\u2085, a\u2086 (arithmetic). So each term is part of both a geometric and an arithmetic triplet, except maybe the first and last terms?\n\nSo, the key is to find a sequence that satisfies both these conditions. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms must be positive integers, and each term must be larger than the previous one.\n\nGiven that a\u2081\u2083 is 2016, we need to work backwards or forwards to find a\u2081.

Since r\u2081 is an integer, 1/r\u2081 is a fraction, so r\u2082 is 2 - 1/r\u2081, which is a rational number. But to have a\u2085 integer, since a\u2084 is an integer, then r\u2082 must be a fraction such that a\u2084 * r\u2082 is integer.\n\nLet me see:\n\na\u2085 = a\u2084 * r\u2082 = a\u2081 (2 r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081) * (2 - 1/r\u2081)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 2 - 1/r\u2081 = (2 r\u2081 - 1)/r\u2081,\n\nso,\n\na\u2085 = a\u2081 (2 r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081) * (2 r\u2081 - 1)/r\u2081\n\nSimplify:\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n2 r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081 = r\u2081 (2 r\u2081 - 1)\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u2085 = a\u2081 * r\u2081 (2 r\u2081 - 1) * (2 r\u2081 - 1)/r\u2081 = a\u2081 (2 r\u2081 - 1)^2\n\nAh!

So, a\u2085 is a\u2081 times (2r\u2081 -1)^2.\n\nOkay, so that's helpful.\n\nNow, moving on to the arithmetic triplet starting at a\u2084: a\u2084, a\u2085, a\u2086.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence, so:\n\na\u2085 = a\u2084 + d\u2082,\n\na\u2086 = a\u2085 + d\u2082.\n\nTherefore, d\u2082 = a\u2085 - a\u2084,\n\nand a\u2086 = a\u2085 + (a\u2085 - a\u2084) = 2 a\u2085 - a\u2084.\n\nLet me compute a\u2086:\n\na\u2086 = 2 a\u2085 - a\u2084 = 2 [a\u2081 (2 r\u2081 -1)^2] - [a\u2081 (2 r\u2081"
