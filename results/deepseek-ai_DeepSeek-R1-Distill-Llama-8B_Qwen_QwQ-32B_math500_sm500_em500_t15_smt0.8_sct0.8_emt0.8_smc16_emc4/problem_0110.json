            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers, C and D. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nAnd this equation holds true for all real values of x except -8 and 3 because those values would make the denominators zero, right? So, I guess I need to find the values of C and D first, and then multiply them to get CD. \n\nHmm, okay. So, starting off, I remember that when you have an equation like this, you can combine the fractions on the left side to have a common denominator, and then set the numerators equal. Let me try that.\n\nThe denominators on the left are (x - 3) and (x + 8), so the common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait, the denominator on the right side is x\u00b2 + 5x - 24. Maybe I can factor that to check if it's the same as (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me calculate:\n\n(x - 3)(x + 8) = x\u00b2 + 8x - 3x -24 = x\u00b2 +5x -24. Yes, that's correct. So the denominators are the same, which means the numerators must be equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x -23.\n\nOkay, so now I have this equation:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x -23.\n\nI need to find C and D, so maybe I can expand the left side and then collect like terms.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = 4x -23.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x -23"

            "output": ".\n\nNow, this equation must hold for all x except -8 and 3, so the coefficients of x and the constants must be equal on both sides. That gives me a system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nSo, now I have two equations with two variables, C and D. I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try substitution.\n\nFrom the first equation, C + D = 4, so I can solve for C: C = 4 - D.\n\nThen substitute this into the second equation:\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n8*4 = 32, so 32 - 8D -3D = -23.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23.\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 -32 = -55.\n\nSo, divide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5.\n\nSo, D is 5. Then, from the first equation, C = 4 - D = 4 -5 = -1.\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Now, the problem asks for the product CD. So, CD = (-1)*(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again, plugging C = -1 and D =5 into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: (-1)/(x-3) + 5/(x+8).\n\nLet me combine these fractions:\n\nThe common denominator is (x-3)(x+8), so:\n\n[ (-1)(x+8) + 5(x-3) ] / (x-3)(x+8).\n\nExpanding numerator:\n\n-1*x -8 +5x -15 = 4x -23.\n\nSo, numerator is 4x -23, denominator is (x-3)(x+8) = x\u00b2 +5x -24.\n\nWhich matches the right side of the given equation. So yes, C is -1 and D is 5, so their product is -5.\n\nSo, the answer should be CD = -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe product CD is \\boxed{-5}.\n</think>\n\n"
