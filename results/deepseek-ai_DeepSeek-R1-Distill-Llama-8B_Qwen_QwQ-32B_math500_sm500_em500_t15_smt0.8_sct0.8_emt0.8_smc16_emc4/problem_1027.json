Then, I have to compute the sum of \\( p_i(1) \\) for all these polynomials \\( p_i \\).\n\nFirst, let me just write down the polynomial again to make sure I have it right:\n\n\\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So this is a degree 8 polynomial. It looks a bit intimidating at first, but maybe there's a way to factor it into simpler polynomials. Let me think about how I can approach this.\n\nSince it's a quartic in terms of \\( x^4 \\), maybe I can substitute \\( y = x^4 \\), turning it into a quadratic equation:\n\n\\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\).\n\nWait, that substitution might help. Let me try solving this quadratic equation for y. Using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{ -3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16} }{2} = \\frac{ -3 \\pm 5 }{2} \\).\n\nSo, the solutions are \\( y = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) and \\( y = \\frac{ -8 }{2} = -4 \\).\n\nSo, that gives me that \\( y = 1 \\) or \\( y = -4 \\). Remembering that \\( y = x^4 \\), so plugging back in, we have:\n\nEither \\( x^4 = 1 \\) or \\( x^4 = -4 \\).\n\nBut \\( x^4 = -4 \\) has no real solutions because any real number raised to the 4th power is non-negative. So, maybe I can factor the original polynomial by considering these equations over complex numbers, but since we need integer coefficients, maybe factoring into quadratics or something else.\n\nWait, but let's think about how to factor \\( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\). Perhaps it can be factored into quadratics. Let me try.\n\nLooking at \\( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\), I notice that it's similar to a quadratic in \\("

Wait, let me check that:\n\n\\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = x^8 - x^4 + 4x^4 -4 = x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\). Yes! That works. So, the polynomial factors into \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nOkay, so that's the first step. Now, we need to check if these factors can be factored further over the integers.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\). That's a difference of squares, right? Since \\( x^4 = (x^2)^2 \\), so:\n\n\\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nThen, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) can be factored further as \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) \\), but \\( x^2 + 1 \\) can't be factored over the real numbers, let alone integers. So, breaking down \\( x^4 -1 \\):\n\n\\( x^4 -1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nSo, that's three factors here. Now, moving on to the other factor \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm, can this be factored over integers?\n\nI recall that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is a sum of squares, but it can actually be factored using the Sophie Germain identity. Let me recall that formula. The identity states that \\( a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) \\). \n\nIn this case, if we set \\( b = 1 \\), then \\( x^4 + 4(1)^4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\)."

            "output": " So, applying that identity:\n\n\\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nAlright, so now, we can factor each of these quadratics further? Let me check the discriminant of each quadratic to see if they can be factored into linear terms with integer coefficients.\n\nFor \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\), discriminant is \\( (2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4 \\). Since the discriminant is negative, this quadratic doesn't factor over the reals, so certainly not over integers.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\), discriminant is \\( (-2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = 4 - 8 = -4 \\), same as above. So, neither can be factored further over integers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, our original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nWait, hold on, but when I did the substitution earlier, I had \\( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). So, now, after factoring \\( x^4 - 1 \\) and \\( x^4 + 4 \\), I get the full factorization into these five polynomials:\n\n1. \\( x - 1 \\)\n2. \\( x + 1 \\)\n3. \\( x^2 + 1 \\)\n4. \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\)\n5. \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\)\n\nWait, hold on, that's five factors. But in the original question, the polynomial is expressed as a product \\( p_1(x) p_2(x) \\dotsm p_k(x) \\). Are all these five factors monic with integer coefficients? Let me check.\n\nEach of these factors is monic, except wait: \\( x -1 \\) is monic (leading coefficient 1), \\( x"

Also, none of them can be factored further over integers, as we saw. So, this should be the complete factorization into irreducible monic polynomials over integers.\n\nTherefore, the factors are the five polynomials listed above.

Wait, but in this case, factoring was the only way to approach it, since the problem requires factoring into irreducibles.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check whether my factorization is correct by expanding the product. Let me quickly try that to confirm.\n\nStarting with \\( (x -1)(x +1) = x^2 -1 \\).\n\nThen, \\( (x^2 -1)(x^2 +1) = x^4 -1 \\).\n\nNext, \\( (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) = x^8 +3x^4 -4 \\), which is our original polynomial.
