So, (3^k)^6 becomes 3^(k*6), which is 3^{6k}.\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to 3^{6k} equals 3^6.\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: 6k equals 6.\n\nFinally, solving for k gives me k equals 1.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( k \\) in the equation \\( (3^k)^6 = 3^6 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**:\n   \n   Recall that \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n} \\). Applying this to the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{k \\cdot 6} = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same (\\( 3 \\) in both cases), the exponents must be equal:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \n   Divide both sides of the equation by \\( 6 \\) to isolate \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   The value of \\( k \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1}\n   \\]"
