            "output": "First, I need to determine the robot's speed. It travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. To find the speed in meters per second, I'll convert the distance and time to consistent units.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. This will give me the robot's speed in meters per second.\n\nOnce I have the speed, I can use it to find the length of the hallway. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway's length, so I'll multiply the speed by the time taken to get the distance in meters.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n- The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the length of a hallway at the same constant speed.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Robot's Speed**\n\nFirst, we determine the robot's speed in meters per second.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}}\n\\]\n\nConvert kilometers to meters and hours to seconds for consistent units.\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ km} = 1000 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\\[\n2.5 \\text{ hours} = 2.5 \\times 3600 \\text{ seconds} = 9000 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{1000}{9000} \\text{ m/s} = \\frac{1}{9} \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Length of the Hallway**\n\nUsing the speed calculated, find the hallway's length.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = \\frac{1}{9} \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ seconds} = 10 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"
