Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, the perimeter is 6 times the side length.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the perimeter of the regular octagon. To do this, I need to know the number of sides, which is 8 for an octagon.\n\nFinally, I'll set the perimeters equal to each other and solve for the side length of the octagon.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Perimeter of the Regular Hexagon**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side length is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of the hexagon} = 6 \\times \\text{side length} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perimeter of the Regular Octagon**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the length of each side of the octagon.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of the octagon} = 8 \\times x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Setting the Perimeters Equal**\n   \n   Since the perimeters are equal:\n   \n   \\[\n   8x = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{96}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
