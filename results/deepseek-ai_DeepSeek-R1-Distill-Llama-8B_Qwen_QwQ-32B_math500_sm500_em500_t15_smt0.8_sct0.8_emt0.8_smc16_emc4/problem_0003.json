            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about polynomials, and I need to figure out P(5) given some conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so that tells me the general form of P(x) should be something like x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants I'll need to find.\n\nNext, it says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Hmm, so R(x) is a polynomial that's the remainder when P(x) is divided by these different quadratics.\n\nAlso, it gives me that P(0) = 5, which is the constant term of the polynomial. That should help me find one of the constants, probably c.\n\nI remember that when you divide a polynomial by a quadratic, the remainder is a linear polynomial because the divisor is degree 2, so the remainder R(x) should be something like dx + e. Similarly, 2R(x) would then be 2dx + 2e.\n\nBut wait, R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is a quadratic. So R(x) is a linear polynomial, like ax + b. Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so that would be 2a x + 2b.\n\nI think I should use the Remainder Theorem here. The Remainder Theorem says that the remainder when a polynomial P(x) is divided by (x - k) is P(k). But since we're dividing by a quadratic, the remainder is a linear polynomial, so maybe I can express R(x) using the values of P at x=1 and x=4.\n\nSpecifically, since when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder R(x) is the unique linear polynomial such that:\n\nR(1) = P(1)\n\nR(4) = P(4)\n\nSimilarly"
