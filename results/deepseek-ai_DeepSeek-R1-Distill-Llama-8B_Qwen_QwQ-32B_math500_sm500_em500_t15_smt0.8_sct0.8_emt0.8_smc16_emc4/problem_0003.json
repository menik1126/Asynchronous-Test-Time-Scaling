            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: Let P(x) be a monic polynomial of degree 3. It says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when it's divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5. We need to find P(5).\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, since P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3, it must look something like P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants we need to find. But maybe there's another approach without having to find all the coefficients.\n\nThe problem mentions remainders when divided by two different quadratic divisors. So, maybe I can use the Remainder Factor Theorem here. I remember that when a polynomial is divided by a quadratic, say (x - m)(x - n), the remainder will be a linear polynomial, right? So, R(x) must be of the form rx + s.\n\nGiven that, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So, P(1) = R(1) and P(4) = R(4). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So, P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nWait, so I can write these as equations. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote R(x) = mx + n. Then:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1) = m*1 + n\n2. P(4) = R(4) = m*4 + n\n3. P(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(m*2 + n) = 4m + 2n\n4. P(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(m*3 + n) = 6m + 2n\n\nAlso, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, maybe we can express it in terms of the divisor and the remainder. So, P(x) = ("

So, P(0) = 0\u00b3 + a*0\u00b2 + b*0 + c = c = 5. So, c is 5.\n\nSo, now we have P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + 5.\n\nNow, let's use the four equations we wrote earlier.\n\n1. P(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = 6 + a + b = m + n.\n2. P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 69 + 16a + 4b = 4m + n.\n3. P(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = 13 + 4a + 2b = 4m + 2n.\n4.

Correct.\n\nSo, seems correct now.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried a=79, it didn't work, so perhaps this is the correct approach.\n\nSo, with a=-2.5, b=-10.5, P(x)=x\u00b3 -2.5x\u00b2 -10.5x +5.\n\nWait, but P(0) is 5, which matches.\n\nNow, the question is to find P(5).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nP(5)=125 + (-2.5)(25) + (-10.5)(5) +5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n125,\n\n-2.5*25= -62.5,\n\n-10.5*5= -52.5,\n\n+5.\n\nSo, sum is 125 -62.5=62.5; 62.5 -52.5=10; 10+5=15.\n\nSo, P(5)=15.\n\nWait, that seems too clean. Let me confirm with the polynomial coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another method without finding all coefficients?\n\nWait, the problem says that R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x -1)(x -4), which is a quadratic. So, R(x) is linear, as we've done.\n\nAlso, the remainder when divided by (x -2)(x -3) is 2R(x).\n\nSo, perhaps R(x) is something specific.\n\nWait, from the earlier steps, with this solution, R(x)= -2x -5.\n\nSo, when P is divided by (x -1)(x -4), the remainder is R(x)=-2x -5.\n\nWhen P is divided by (x -2)(x -3), the remainder is 2R(x)= -4x -10.\n\nLet me check if that holds.\n\nSo, P(2)=2R(2)=2*(-4 -5)=2*(-9)=-18, as computed earlier. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, P(3)=2R(3)=2*(-6 -5)=2*(-11)=-22. Correct.\n\nSo, R(x)= -2x -5.\n\nSo, then P(x) = (x -1)(x -4)Q(x) -2x"

Alternatively, since the problem is about remainders when divided by quadratics, perhaps we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem approach?\n\nWait, but since the divisors are (x-1)(x-4) and (x-2)(x-3), which are coprime? Let me see, their GCD is 1, since they have no common roots. So, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, the system of congruences has a unique solution modulo (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4).
