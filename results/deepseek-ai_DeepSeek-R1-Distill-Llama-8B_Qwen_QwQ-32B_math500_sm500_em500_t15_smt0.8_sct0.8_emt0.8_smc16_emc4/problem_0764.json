The problem says that for every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric, and the subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is arithmetic. Also, we know that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are. A geometric sequence has each term multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, if \\( a, b, c \\) are in a geometric sequence, then \\( b/a = c/b \\), which implies \\( b^2 = ac \\). On the other hand, an arithmetic sequence has each term obtained by adding a common difference. So, if \\( b, c, d \\) are in an arithmetic sequence, then \\( c - b = d - c \\), which simplifies to \\( 2c = b + d \\).\n\nGiven that, let's parse the problem again. The sequence is strictly increasing, meaning each term is larger than the previous one. So, all terms are positive integers, and \\( a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \\dots \\).\n\nFor every \\( k \\), the terms \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) form a geometric sequence. So, this means that \\( a_{2k}^2 = a_{2k-1} \\times a_{2k+1} \\) for each \\( k \\). Similarly, the terms \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) form an arithmetic sequence, meaning \\( 2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2} \\) for each \\( k \\).\n\nAlright, so let me try to write down these relationships for a few values of \\( k \\) to see if I can spot a pattern or find a recursive relationship.\n\nLet's start with \\( k = 1 \\). Then, \\( a_1, a_2, a_3 \\"
