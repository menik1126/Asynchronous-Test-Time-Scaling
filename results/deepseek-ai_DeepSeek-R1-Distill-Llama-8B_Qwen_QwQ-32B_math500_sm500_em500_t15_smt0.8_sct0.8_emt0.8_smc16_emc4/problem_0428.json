It has 10 complex roots, and they come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The question is asking me to find the sum of the reciprocals of the products of each root with its conjugate, that is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3 \\overline{r}_3} + \\frac{1}{r_4 \\overline{r}_4} + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5}\n\\]\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what each term in the sum represents. The term \\(\\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r}_i}\\) is the reciprocal of the modulus squared of each root \\(r_i\\). Since for any complex number \\(r\\), \\(r \\overline{r} = |r|^2\\), which is the square of its modulus. So, this term is essentially \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum we're being asked to compute is the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the moduli of each pair of complex roots. Since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each \\(r_i\\) and its conjugate \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) will have the same modulus, so each term in the sum is the same for each pair. Wait, but is that true?\n\nWait, no. Actually, each \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) have the same modulus, so \\(|r_i| = |\\overline{r}_i|\\), but the terms themselves are \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\) for each pair. So, for each pair \\(r_i, \\overline{r}_i\\), the term is \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} + \\frac{1}{|\\overline{r"

The problem statement lists all 10 roots as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) etc. So, each pair is considered a single entity. So, the sum is five terms, each being the sum of \\(\\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r}_i}\\) for each pair. But actually, each pair contributes one term, since \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) are distinct roots but their product is the same. Wait, no, the problem lists all 10 roots and then sums over each pair once. Let me double-check.\n\nThe question is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3 \\overline{r}_3} + \\frac{1}{r_4 \\overline{r}_4} + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5}\n\\]\n\nSo, it's adding five terms: each one is the reciprocal of \\(r_i \\overline{r}_i\\). Since \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) are distinct roots, but for each \\(i\\), \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) is another root. So, each term in the sum is the reciprocal of the squared modulus of each of these five roots (each considered once). Therefore, it's the sum of \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\) for \\(i = 1\\) to 5, where each \\(r_i\\) is one of the five distinct roots (and their conjugates are the others).\n\nTherefore, the sum is \\(\\frac{1}{|r_1|^2} + \\frac{1}{|r_2|^2} + \\frac{1}{|r_3|^2} + \\frac{1}{|r_4|^2} + \\frac{1}{|r_5|^2}\\).\n\nSo, I need"

Let me rewrite this equation as:\n\n\\[\nx^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\n\\]\n\nTaking the 10th roots of both sides, we can write:\n\n\\[\nx = \\omega \\cdot (-(13x - 1))\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of unity.

For example, the sum of \\(1/(1 - x r_i)\\) can be related to \\(P'(x)/P(x)\\). But in this case, it's the sum of \\(1/(|r_i|^2)\\), which is \\(1/x_i \\overline{x_i}\\) if \\(x_i = r_i\\).\n\nAlternatively, note that if \\(x\\) is a root of the equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), then so is \\(x = \\frac{\\omega}{1 + 13\\omega}\\) as we found. So, perhaps we can express \\(|x|^2\\) in terms of \\(\\omega\\) and then sum \\(1/|x|^2\\) over all 10 roots.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the roots come in conjugate pairs, so maybe I can compute the sum over all roots, which includes both \\(x\\) and \\(\\overline{x}\\), and then divide appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, considering the expression \\(|x|^2 = x \\overline{x}\\).

Wait, actually, the problem lists the roots as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\ldots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\), so each pair is grouped as \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\).

Since each root satisfies the equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), which can be rewritten as \\(x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10}\\). Taking both sides to the power of 1/10, we get \\(x = \\omega (-(13x -1))\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = 1\\).

Therefore, the total is indeed 1700 / 2 = 850.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a smarter way to compute this sum without going through all the roots.\n\nLet me think again. Let me consider the polynomial equation \\(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0\\). Let me denote \\(y = 13x -1\\), so the equation becomes \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\), with \\(y = 13x -1\\).
