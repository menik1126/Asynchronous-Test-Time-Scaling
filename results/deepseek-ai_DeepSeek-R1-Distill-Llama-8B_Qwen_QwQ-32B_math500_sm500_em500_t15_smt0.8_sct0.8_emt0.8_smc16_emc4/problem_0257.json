This allows me to convert Blinkets to Trinkets by dividing the number of Blinkets by 3.\n\nNext, since 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets, I can use this to find out how many Trinkets are equivalent to a certain number of Drinkets. By dividing the number of Drinkets by 3, I get the number of Blinkets, and then dividing that by 3 again gives me the number of Trinkets.\n\nApplying this process to 56 Drinkets, I will divide by 3 to find the equivalent number of Blinkets, and then divide by 3 again to convert Blinkets to Trinkets. This will give me the final value in Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - \\(1 \\text{ Trinket} = 4 \\text{ Blinkets}\\)\n   - \\(3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets}\\)\n\n2. **Find the Relationship Between Trinkets and Drinkets:**\n   - Since \\(3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets}\\), we can find out how many Trinkets correspond to Drinkets.\n   \n3. **Convert Drinkets to Blinkets:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Blinkets per Drinket} = \\frac{3 \\text{ Blinkets}}{7 \\text{ Drinkets}} = \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets per Drinket}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Trinkets per Blinket} = \\frac{1 \\text{ Trinket}}{4 \\text{ Blinkets}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\text{ Trinkets per Blinket}\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Find Trinkets for 56 Drinkets:**\n   \\[\n   56 \\text{ Drinkets} \\times \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets per Drinket} = 24 \\text{"
