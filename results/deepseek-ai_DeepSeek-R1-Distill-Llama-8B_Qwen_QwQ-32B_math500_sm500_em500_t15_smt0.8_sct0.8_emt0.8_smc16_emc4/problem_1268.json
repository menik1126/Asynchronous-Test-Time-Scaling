            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 2^{2x} equals 256 to the power of one half. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, it's often helpful to express both sides with the same base. That way, I can set the exponents equal to each other and solve for the variable. \n\nFirst, let me look at the right side of the equation: 256^{1/2}. I know that 256 is a power of 2. Let me see, 2^8 is 256 because 2^10 is 1024, which is way too big, but yeah, 2^8 is 256. So if I can write 256 as 2^8, then 256^{1/2} becomes (2^8)^{1/2}. \n\nNow, there's a rule in exponents that says (a^m)^n equals a^{m*n}. So applying that here, (2^8)^{1/2} would be 2^{8*(1/2)}. Let me calculate that exponent: 8 times 1/2 is 4. So 256^{1/2} simplifies to 2^4. \n\nSo now, the original equation 2^{2x} = 256^{1/2} becomes 2^{2x} = 2^4. That's good because both sides have the same base, which is 2. I remember that if a^b = a^c, then b must equal c, provided that a is not equal to 0 or 1. Since 2 is neither 0 nor 1, this rule applies. \n\nTherefore, I can set the exponents equal to each other: 2x = 4. Now, to solve for x, I just need to divide both sides by 2. So, x equals 4 divided by 2, which is 2. \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I converted 256 to 2^8 correctly because 2^8 is 256. Then, taking the square root of 256, which is the same as raising it to the 1/2 power, should give me 16, since 16 squared is 256. But wait, 2^4 is 16"

            "output": ", so 2^{2x} equals 16. So, 2^{2x} = 16. \n\nLet me solve that again: 2^{2x} = 16. Expressing 16 as a power of 2, we get 2^4. So, 2x must equal 4, which gives x = 2. Yes, that checks out. \n\nAlternatively, I can plug x = 2 back into the original equation to verify. Let's compute both sides. Left side: 2^{2*2} = 2^4 = 16. Right side: 256^{1/2} is the square root of 256, which is also 16. So, both sides equal 16 when x is 2, which confirms that x = 2 is indeed the correct solution. \n\nI think that's all there is to it. I didn't really stumble into any complications here. It was just a matter of expressing both sides with the same base and then equating the exponents. Pretty straightforward once I remembered the exponent rules. Hopefully, I didn't miss anything or make any calculation errors. But checking it twice seems to confirm that x = 2 is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), we can rewrite each side with the same base. \n\nFirst, recognize that \\(256\\) is \\(2^8\\). Therefore, the right side becomes:\n\\[\n256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n\\]\nNow, the equation is:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = 2^4\n\\]\nSince the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal:\n\\[\n2x = 4\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\), we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\nThe solution is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
