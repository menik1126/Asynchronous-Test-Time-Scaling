Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that sometimes, when you have cubes on both sides, it might be helpful to expand them or look for patterns that could simplify the equation.\n\nFirst, I should write down the equation clearly:\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nI notice that on the left side, there are two cube terms, and on the right side, there's one cube term. Maybe I can set a substitution or factor something out. Let me check if the right side can be related to the left side in some way.\n\nLooking at the right side: 2x - 10. Hmm, 2x - 10 is similar to 2*(x - 5), right? Because 2*(x - 5) = 2x - 10. So, the right side is (2x - 10)^3, which is [2*(x - 5)]^3. That simplifies to 8*(x - 5)^3. Okay, so the equation becomes:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8*(x - 5)^3.\n\nThat might be helpful. Now, I have cubes of (x - 3) and (x - 7) on the left, and 8*(x - 5)^3 on the right.\n\nMaybe I can bring everything to one side to see if it factors nicely. Let's subtract 8*(x - 5)^3 from both sides:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 - 8*(x - 5)^3 = 0.\n\nHmm, so we have a polynomial equation. Let me see if I can expand each term to combine like terms. That might be a bit messy, but let's try.\n\nFirst, let's expand (x - 3)^3. Using the binomial expansion:\n\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27.\n\nSimilarly, (x - 7)^3 = x^3 - "

The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -105, and the leading coefficient is 1. So the possible rational roots are factors of -105, which are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.\n\nLet me test these one by one.\n\nFirst, let's try x=1:\n\n1 -15 +71 -105 = (1 -15)= -14 +71=57 -105= -48 ≠0.\n\nx=3:\n\n27 -135 +213 -105 = (27-135)= -108 +213=105 -105=0.

Those would be -5 and -7.\n\nSo, x^2 -12x +35 = (x -5)(x -7).\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors completely as (x -3)(x -5)(x -7)=0.\n\nHence, the roots are x=3, x=5, x=7.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check if these roots satisfy the original equation.\n\nFirst, x=3:\n\nLeft side: (3 -3)^3 + (3 -7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 -64 = -"
