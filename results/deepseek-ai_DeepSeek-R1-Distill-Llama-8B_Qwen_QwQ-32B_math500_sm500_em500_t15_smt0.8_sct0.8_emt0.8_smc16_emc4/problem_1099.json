Hmm, recursive functions can be tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the definition of the function f(i, j). It's defined recursively, so I know I might need to work backwards or find a pattern. The function f: {0,1,2,...} \u00d7 {0,1,2,3,4} \u2192 {0,1,2,3,4} is given with three cases:\n\n1. If i = 0, then f(0, j) = mod5(j + 1). Since j can be 0 to 4, this means:\n   - f(0,0) = 1\n   - f(0,1) = 2\n   - f(0,2) = 3\n   - f(0,3) = 4\n   - f(0,4) = 0 (because 5 mod 5 is 0)\n2. If i >= 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1).\n3. If i >= 1 and 1 <= j <= 4, then f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)).\n\nOur goal is to compute f(2015, 2). That seems like a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or cycle that repeats, especially because mod5 is involved. Let's try to compute some small values of f(i, j) to see if we can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n- f(0,0) = 1\n- f(0,1) = 2\n- f(0,2) = 3\n- f(0,3) = 4\n- f(0,4) = 0\n\nNow, for i = 1, let's compute each j from 0 to 4.\n\nFor j = 0:\n- f(1,0) = f(0,1) = 2\n\nFor j = 1:\n- f(1,1) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,2) = 3\n\nFor"

So indeed, once you hit i=5, all subsequent i's will have f(i,j)=1 for any j.\n\nTherefore, f(2015,2)=1.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a mistake here. Let me see for i=4, f(4,1)=1, so f(5,0)=1. Then f(5,1)=f(4,1)=1, so that's okay. But is there a case where this might not hold?\n\nWait, let me check i=5, j=2 again. f(5,2)=f(4, f(5,1))=f(4,1)=1. Since f(5,1)=1, so yes. So all the f(5,j) are 1. Then for i=6, f(6,0)=f(5,1)=1, and so on. So indeed, once you get to i=5, it's all 1s. Therefore, for any i >=5, f(i,j)=1. Therefore, f(2015,2)=1.\n\nHmm, but let me check with another approach. Maybe the function is similar to a Ackermann function, but with modulus. But in this case, it seems that after a certain point, it stabilizes to 1. Alternatively, maybe there's a cycle of length 5 or something else.\n\nWait, but according to the computations above, once you reach i=5, it's all 1s. Let me see if that's the case.\n\nWait, let me compute f(5,0)=1, f(5,1)=1, etc. So f(5,j)=1 for all j. Then f(6,0)=f(5,1)=1, and f(6,1)=f(5, f(6,0))=f(5,1)=1, so yes, same as before. So indeed, once you hit 1s, they stay 1s. So the function is constant from i=5 onwards.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1. But let me check again with the problem statement to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything.\n\nThe function f is defined for i and j where i is a non-negative integer and j"
