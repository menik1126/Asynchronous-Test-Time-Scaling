Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I want to understand what the expression looks like. The numerator is \\(x - y\\), which is linear in both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), while the denominator is a sum of fourth powers of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) plus 6. So the denominator is always positive because any real number to the fourth power is non-negative, and adding 6 makes it strictly positive. That means the entire expression is a fraction where the denominator is always positive, so the expression can take both positive and negative values depending on the numerator.\n\nSince we're looking for the maximum value, I should focus on when the numerator is positive because the denominator is always positive. So, we can say that \\(\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\) will be maximized when \\(x - y\\) is as large as possible relative to the denominator.\n\nHmm, but how do I find the maximum of this function? I know that for functions of multiple variables, one approach is to use calculus, specifically finding partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero to find critical points. That seems like a possible method here.\n\nLet me denote the function as \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). To find its maximum, I can compute the partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), set them both equal to zero, and solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\). Using the quotient rule, which states that the derivative of \\(f/g\\) is \\((f'g - fg')/g^2\\). So,\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\\)\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) is:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{(-1"

That means their numerators must be zero since the denominator is always positive and never zero.\n\nSo, setting the numerators equal to zero:\n\nFor \\(x\\):\n\n\\(1 \\cdot (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y) \\cdot 4x^3 = 0\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(x^4 + y^4 + 6 - 4x^4 + 4x^3 y = 0\\)\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\(-3x^4 + 4x^3 y + y^4 + 6 = 0\\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\(y\\):\n\n\\(-1 \\cdot (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y) \\cdot 4y^3 = 0\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(-x^4 - y^4 - 6 - 4y^4 + 4y^3 x = 0\\)\n\nWait, hold on, that might not be correct. Let me double-check the signs when differentiating the numerator with respect to \\(y\\). The original numerator is \\(x - y\\), so its derivative with respect to \\(y\\) is \\(-1\\). So the derivative of the numerator with respect to \\(y\\) is \\(-1\\). Then the derivative of the denominator with respect to \\(y\\) is \\(4y^3\\). So the numerator of the derivative for \\(y\\) is:\n\n\\(-1 \\cdot (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y) \\cdot 4y^3\\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\(-x^4 - y^4 - 6 -4y^3 (x - y)\\)\n\nExpanding the last term:\n\n\\(-4y^3 x + 4y^4\\)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\\(-x^4 - y^4 - 6 -4x y^3 + 4y^4 = 0\\)\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\(-x^4 -4x y^3 + 3"

Since we are looking for the maximum, \\(1/4\\) is a candidate.\n\nBut wait, before I conclude, I need to check if these are indeed the global maxima. Is it possible that the function could take a larger value somewhere else?\n\nLet me think about the behavior of the function. As \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) grow large in magnitude, the denominator grows much faster than the numerator because it's a fourth-degree polynomial, whereas the numerator is linear. So, as \\(|x|\\) and \\(|y|\\) become large, the function tends to zero. So, the maximum must occur somewhere at finite values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nSince we found critical points, and evaluated them, but maybe there are other critical points? Or perhaps, these are the only ones.\n\nBut let's check if we have only found these critical points. Remember, we set the partial derivatives equal to zero and arrived at \\(y = -x\\) leading to \\(x = \\pm1\\). Is that all?\n\nWait, let me recap: when we added equation 1 and equation 2, we got \\(x - y =0\\) or \\(x^3 + y^3 =0\\). We saw that \\(x - y=0\\) didn't yield real solutions, so \\(x^3 + y^3 =0\\) leading to \\(y = -x\\). Substituting back into equation 1 gave \\(x^4 =1\\), so \\(x=1\\) or \\(x=-1\\). So, indeed, those are the only critical points.\n\nThus, the maximum value"

So, the maximum when y=0 is about 0.1486, which is less than 1/4. So, okay, so my mistake was in the exponent.\n\nTherefore, the maximum at y=0 is lower than 1/4. So, the previous result of 1/4 still holds.\n\nHmm, so maybe 1/4 is indeed the maximum. Let me check another case. Suppose y is fixed at some value, and x is chosen to maximize the function.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the case when x and y are such that x - y is maximized while keeping the denominator small.

Alternatively, maybe there's a point where the function is slightly higher, but given that the critical point gives exactly 1/4, and all other points I test give lower values, it's likely that 1/4 is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, after testing several points and checking critical points, it seems that the maximum value of the given expression is 1/4, achieved at the points (1, -1) and (-1, 1). Therefore, the maximum value is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\\).\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the maximum value of the function \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\) over all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and set them to zero to find critical points.

Evaluating the function at these points, we get \\(f(1, -1) = \\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(f(-1, 1) = -\\frac{1}{4}\\). \n\nWe also checked other possible values and behaviors, such as when \\(y = 0\\) or \\(x = 0\\), but found that the function values were lower than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). Additionally, considering the behavior of the function as \\(|x|\\) and \\(|y|\\) grow large, the function tends to zero, confirming that the maximum must occur at a finite point.\n\nThus, the maximum value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\\)."
