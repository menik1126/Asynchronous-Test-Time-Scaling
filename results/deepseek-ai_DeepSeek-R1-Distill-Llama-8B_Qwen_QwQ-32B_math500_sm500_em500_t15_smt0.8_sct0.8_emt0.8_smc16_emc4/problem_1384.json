The matrix M is given as a linear transformation that takes the vector [2, -1] to [9, 3] and [1, -3] to [7, -1]. Hmm, okay. So, first, I think I need to figure out what the matrix M actually is. Once I have the matrix, I can then apply it to the line y = 2x + 1.\n\nAlright, so let's start by recalling that a matrix acting on a vector can be represented as M times the vector. So, if we have a vector v, then Mv is the transformation applied to v. So for the first vector [2, -1], M[2; -1] should equal [9; 3], and similarly, M[1; -3] equals [7; -1]. So, with these two equations, I can set up a system to solve for the elements of matrix M.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nSo, when we multiply M with the vector [2; -1], we get:\n\n[a*2 + b*(-1)] = 9\n[c*2 + d*(-1)] = 3\n\nSimilarly, multiplying M with [1; -3] gives:\n\n[a*1 + b*(-3)] = 7\n[c*1 + d*(-3)] = -1\n\nOkay, so now I have a system of four equations:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. -3a + b = 7\n3. 2c - d = 3\n4. -3c + d = -1\n\nHmm, that's two equations for a and b, and two equations for c and d. Let me solve for a and b first.\n\nLooking at equations 1 and 2:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 2: -3a + b = 7\n\nI can add these two equations together to eliminate b. Let me do that:\n\n(2a - b) + (-3a + b) = 9 + 7\n2a - 3a - b + b = 16\n- a = 16\nSo, a = -"

So, 0 - a = 9 + 7 => -a = 16 => a = -16.

Hmm, that's wrong. That means I have an error in my earlier calculation.\n\nHmm, so my earlier method must be incorrect. Let's go back and figure out where I messed up.\n\nWait, when I defined M as [a b; c d], then multiplying M with the vector [x; y] gives [a x + b y; c x + d y]. So when I set up equations based on [2; -1] and [1; -3], I should have:\n\nFor [2; -1]:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9  --> 2a - b = 9 (Equation 1)\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3  --> 2c - d = 3 (Equation 3)\n\nFor [1; -3]:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7 --> a - 3b = 7 (Equation 2)\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1 --> c - 3d = -1 (Equation 4)\n\nSo when I had equations 1 and 2 before, I had equation 1 as 2a - b = 9, equation 2 as -3a + b = 7.\n\nBut equation 2, which is from the second vector, is actually a - 3b = 7, not -3a + b. So my mistake was that I miswrote equation 2.\n\nSo correct equations should be:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 2: a - 3b = 7\nEquation 3: 2c - d = 3\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1"

So, the line y=2x +1 can be parametrized as (x, 2x+1), where x is a real number. Since M is a linear transformation, the image of the line will be another line, because the image of a line under a linear transformation is either a point or a line. Since the matrix is 2x2, it's invertible (since determinant is non-zero? Let's check determinant: (4)(1) - (-1)(2)=4 +2=6. So determinant is 6, which is non-zero, so M is invertible, which means the image is a line.\n\nSo, to find the image of the line under M, I can take two vectors from the line, apply M, and find the equation of the line passing through the two transformed points.\n\nAlternatively, since the line is parameterizable, I can substitute the parameterization into M.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing the line y=2x+1 as r(t) = [t; 2t +1], where t is any real number. Then, M*r(t) = M*[t; 2t+1] = [4t - (2t +1); 2t + (2t +1)].\n\nSimplify that:\n\nFirst component: 4t -2t -1=2t -1\n\nSecond component:2t +2t +1=4t +1\n\nSo, the transformed vector is [2t -1; 4t +1]. \n\nWe can write this as:\n\nx = 2t -1\n\ny=4t +1\n\nNow, express x in terms of t: t=(x +1)/2\n\nPlug into y equation:\n\ny=4*( (x +1)/2 ) +1=2(x +1)+1=2x +2 +1=2x +3\n\nThus, the image of the line y=2x +1"

            "output": " under M is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check with another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, since the line can be written as a vector equation. Let me think of the line as all vectors [x, y]^T where y =2x +1. So, we can write this as [x, 2x +1]^T. Applying M to this vector:\n\nM*[x; 2x +1] = [4x - (2x +1); 2x + (2x +1)] = [2x -1; 4x +1], which is the same as above. So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the general method for transforming lines under linear transformations.\n\nAnother way: The line y =2x +1 can be expressed as a parametric equation. Let me consider points on the line. Let me pick two points on the original line and see where they are mapped, then find the equation of the line through those two images.\n\nLet me choose two points on y=2x+1. Let's pick x=0: then y=1, so point (0,1). Another point, say x=1: y=3, so (1,3). Let's apply M to these points.\n\nFirst point (0,1):\n\nM*[0;1] = [4*0 -1*1; 2*0 +1*1] = [-1;1]\n\nSecond point (1,3):\n\nM*[1;3] = [4*1 -1*3; 2*1 +1*3] = [4-3; 2+3] = [1;5]\n\nSo the transformed points are (-1,1) and (1,5). Let's find the equation of the line through these two points.\n\nThe slope m is (5 -1)/(1 - (-1)) =4/2=2. So slope is 2. Then using point-slope form with point (-1,1):\n\ny -1 =2(x +1)\n\ny =2x +2 +1=2x +3. Same result. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let me check another point. Let me take x = -1 on the original line. Then y=2*(-1)+1= -2 +1= -1. So point (-1, -"

So y=-3, which is correct. So yes, this point lies on the transformed line.\n\nTherefore, the image is indeed y=2x +3.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the image can be found by composing with the matrix transformation or using a different method, but since we have consistent results from multiple approaches, I think it's solid.\n\nSo, after all that, the image of the line y=2x+1 under matrix M is y=2x +3.\n</think>\n\nThe matrix M is found to be:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -1 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe image of the line \\( y = 2x + 1 \\) under M can be found by substituting the parametric form of the line into M.
