            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about bus riders at Central H.S., and I need to figure out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders. Hmm, let me parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, the table gives me the percentage of males and females who are bus riders for each grade: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. The problem says that 300 males and 300 females were surveyed in each grade. So, for each grade, there are 300 boys and 300 girls. Therefore, the number of male bus riders and female bus riders for each grade would be 300 multiplied by their respective percentages.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. If 41.1% of 9th grade males are bus riders, and the same for females, right? So for each grade, I can compute the actual number of bus riders by taking the percentage and multiplying by 300. That makes sense because the percentages represent the proportion of students in each grade who are bus riders.\n\nSo, for each grade, the number of male bus riders would be 300 multiplied by the male percentage, and similarly for females. Then, for each grade, I need to calculate what 135% of the female bus riders would be and see if the number of male bus riders is closest to that.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. For each grade, calculate the number of male bus riders (MalesBus = 300 * MalePercentage).\n2. For each grade, calculate the number of female bus riders (FemalesBus = 300 * FemalePercentage).\n3. Then, compute 135% of FemalesBus, which is 1.35 * FemalesBus.\n4. Now, find the absolute difference between MalesBus and 135% of FemalesBus. The grade with the smallest difference is the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute it more directly. For each grade, I can set up the equation: MalesBus = 1.35 * FemalesBus. I need to find which grade is closest to this ratio.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute for each grade the ratio of males to females in terms of bus riders and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to compute for each grade, MalesBus and FemalesBus, then compute 1.35"

The grade where the difference between MalesBus and 1.35*FemalesBus is the smallest is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even better to compute the ratio (MalesBus)/(FemalesBus) and see which is closest to 1.35. Let me think.\n\nWait, the question says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders\". So, the male number should be as close as possible to 1.35 times the female number. So, the difference between MalesBus and 1.35*FemalesBus should be minimal. Alternatively, the ratio (MalesBus)/(FemalesBus) should be as close as possible to 1.35. Either way, both approaches should work. Let me see which is easier.\n\nLet me try the ratio approach first. Let me compute for each grade the ratio (MalesBus)/(FemalesBus) and see how close it is to 1.35.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of students is 300 each, the percentages can be directly used in the ratio. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor a given grade, let M% be the male percentage, F% be the female percentage. Then, the number of males is 300*(M/100), females is 300*(F/100). So the ratio (MalesBus)/(FemalesBus) is (300*(M/100))/(300*(F/100)) = M/F. So actually, the ratio of the numbers is just the ratio of the percentages. Because the 300 and 100 cancel out. So, the ratio is M/F. Therefore, instead of calculating the actual numbers, I can just compute M/F for each grade and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Since both are out of 300, the ratio simplifies to the ratio of the percentages. So that's a shortcut. So, for each grade, compute M% divided by F%, and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nAlternatively, if I want to compute the difference between MalesBus and 1.35*FemalesBus"

            "output": ", I can compute that as well. Let's see:\n\nMalesBus = 300*(M%) = 300*M/100 = 3*M\n\nFemalesBus = 300*(F%) = 300*F/100 = 3*F\n\n1.35*FemalesBus = 1.35*3*F = 4.05*F\n\nSimilarly, MalesBus - 1.35*FemalesBus = 3*M - 4.05*F\n\nBut since M and F are percentages, so I can compute the actual difference based on that. Let me try both approaches.\n\nLet me start by computing M/F for each grade.\n\nGrade 9: Males 41.1%, Females 39.4%. So M/F = 41.1 / 39.4. Let's compute that.\n\n41.1 ÷ 39.4 ≈ 1.043. So approximately 1.043. How does this compare to 1.35? The difference is 1.35 - 1.043 ≈ 0.307. So the ratio is below 1.35 by about 0.307.\n\nGrade 10: Males 34.4%, Females 33.1%. So M/F = 34.4 / 33.1 ≈ 1.037. 1.35 - 1.037 ≈ 0.313. Again, the ratio is a bit below 1.35, but the difference in this case is similar.\n\nGrade 11: Males 20.6%, Females 13.8%. So M/F = 20.6 /13.8 ≈ 1.493. Let me compute that more accurately:\n\n20.6 ÷13.8. 13.8*1.4=19.32, 20.6-19.32=1.28. So, 1.4 + 1.28/13.8 ≈ 1.4 + ~0.093 = ~1.493. So 1.493 is the ratio.\n\n1.35 - 1.493 = -0.153, so the absolute difference is 0.153.\n\nGrade 12: Males 11.6%, Females 8.6%. M/F = 11.6 /8.6 ≈ 1.3488. Because 8.6"

So that's very close.\n\nSo, let me tabulate:\n\nGrade 9: ratio ≈1.043, difference from 1.35 is ~0.307\n\nGrade10: ratio≈1.037, difference ~0.313\n\nGrade11: ratio≈1.493, difference ~0.153\n\nGrade12: ratio≈1.349, difference ~0.001\n\nSo, the differences are:\n\nGrade9: 0.307\n\nGrade10: 0.313\n\nGrade11: 0.153\n\nGrade12: 0.001\n\nSo the smallest difference is in Grade12, with a difference of just 0.001, which is practically negligible.
