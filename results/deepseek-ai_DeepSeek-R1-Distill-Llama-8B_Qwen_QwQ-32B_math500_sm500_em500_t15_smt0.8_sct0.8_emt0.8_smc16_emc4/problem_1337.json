So, the coefficient of x^9 is -2010,\n\nthe coefficient of x^8 is +4.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all roots (including multiplicity) is - (coefficient of x^8)/(coefficient of x^9) = -4/(-2010) = 4/2010=2/1005.\n\nSo, the sum is 2/1005.\n\nWait, but x=0 is a root, and the 8th degree polynomial has 8 roots, so total of 9 roots, but the sum is 2/1005.\n\nWait, but in the original equation, x=0 is a solution, as we checked.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The equation is:\n\nsum_{k=1}^4 [k/(x\u00b2 -k)] = 2010x -4.\n\nIs x=0 the only real solution? Or are there more?\n\nWait, when x=0, the left side is -4, and the right side is -4, so it's valid.\n\nBut for other values, let's see.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, the left side behaves like:\n\n1/x\u00b2 + 2/x\u00b2 +3/x\u00b2 +4/x\u00b2=10/x\u00b2, which approaches 0,\n\nwhile the right side behaves like 2010x, which approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, for large positive x, right side is positive and large, left side is small positive, so no solution.\n\nFor negative x, right side is negative large, left side is small positive, so no solution.\n\nTherefore, x=0 might be the only real solution, but there could be complex solutions.\n\nBut the problem asks for all complex solutions, so including x=0 and the other 8 roots from the 8th degree equation.\n\nThus, the sum is 2/1005.\n\nWait, but let me compute 4/2010 reduced:\n\n4/2010=2/1005.\n\nYes, because"
