            "output": "I need to determine how far Bill is from his starting point after his walk. I'll analyze each leg of his journey step by step.\n\nFirst, Bill walks half a mile south. This means his starting point is now 0.5 miles south of the origin.\n\nNext, he walks three-fourths of a mile east. This adds an eastward distance without affecting his southern position.\n\nFinally, he walks another half a mile south. Adding this to his current position, he will be 1 mile south of the origin.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from the origin, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. The total eastward distance is three-fourths of a mile, and the total southward distance is 1 mile.\n\nCalculating the straight-line distance:\n√( (3/4)^2 + 1^2 ) = √(0.5625 + 1) = √1.5625 = 1.25 miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down Bill's journey and calculate his final position relative to the starting point using basic geometry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Movements\n- **First Movement:** Bill walks **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south**.\n- **Second Movement:** Then, he walks **\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east**.\n- **Third Movement:** Finally, he walks another **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Total Southward Distance\n- **Total Southward Distance:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile (south)} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile (south)} = 1 \\text{ mile (south)}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Total Eastward Distance\n- **Total Eastward Distance:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile (east)}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Straight-Line Distance\nTo find the straight-line distance from the starting point, use the Pythagorean theorem. Let:\n- \\( d_e \\) = Total Eastward Distance = \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile\n- \\( d_s \\) = Total Southward Distance = 1 mile\n\nThe straight-line distance \\( D \\) is:\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{d_e^2 + d_s^2}\n\\"
