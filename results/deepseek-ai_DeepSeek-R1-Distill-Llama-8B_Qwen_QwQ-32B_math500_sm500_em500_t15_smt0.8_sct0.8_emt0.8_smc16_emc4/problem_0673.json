This means that the product of the number of players and the number of cards each player receives must equal 54.\n\nSo, x multiplied by y equals 54:\nx * y = 54\n\nNext, I need to consider the constraints provided. The number of players, x, must be at least 2, and the number of cards each player receives, y, must be at least 5.\n\nTherefore, I'm looking for all the possible values of x that are factors of 54 and satisfy y being at least 5.\n\nI'll start by listing all the factors of 54:\n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n\nNow, I'll identify which of these factors are at least 2 and result in y being at least 5.\n\n1 is too small for x because x must be at least 2.\n\n2 is a valid number of players. When x = 2, y = 54 / 2 = 27, which is more than 5.\n\n3 is also a valid number of players. When x = 3, y = 54 / 3 = 18, which is more than 5.\n\n6 is a valid number of players. When x = 6, y = 54 / 6 = 9, which is more than 5.\n\n9 is a valid number of players. When x = 9, y = 54 / 9 = 6, which is more than 5.\n\n18 is a valid number of players. When x = 18, y = 54 / 18 = 3, which is less than 5. So, this doesn't meet the requirement for y.\n\n27 is a valid number of players. When x = 27, y = 54 / 27 = 2, which is less than 5. This doesn't meet the requirement for y.\n\n54 is a valid number of players. When x = 54, y = 54 / 54 = 1, which is less than 5. This doesn't meet the requirement for y.\n\nFrom this analysis, the valid values of x are 2, 3, 6, and 9. Therefore, there are 4 possible values of x that satisfy the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the possible values of \\( x"
