Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on complex numbers, but I remember that the modulus of a complex number is like its distance from the origin on the complex plane. So, for a complex number \\( a + bi \\), the modulus is \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\nFirst, though, I think it might be easier to handle powers of complex numbers if I convert \\( 1 - i \\) into its polar form. I remember that any complex number can be expressed as \\( r(\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta) \\) where \\( r \\) is the modulus and \\( \\theta \\) is the argument (or angle). So, let's find \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) for \\( 1 - i \\).\n\nCalculating \\( r \\), it's just the modulus: \\( r = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2} \\). Got that. So the modulus of \\( 1 - i \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nNow, the argument \\( \\theta \\). Since \\( 1 - i \\) is in the fourth quadrant (positive real, negative imaginary), the angle should be measured clockwise from the positive real axis. But I think it's standard to measure counterclockwise, so maybe I should adjust by adding \\( 2\\pi \\) to make it positive. Alternatively, since the angle is in the fourth quadrant, it's \\( -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) if we measure it clockwise or \\( \\frac{7\\pi}{4} \\) counterclockwise. Either way, it's the same. So, \\( \\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) or \\( \\frac{7\\pi}{4} \\).\n\nSo, in polar form, \\( 1 - i \\) can be written as \\( \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}) + i \\sin(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}) \\right) \\).\n\nNow, when we raise this to the "

Let's see, \\( (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\), so \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2)^{4} = 16 \\). Wait, let me confirm that again. Since \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{(1/2)*8} = 2^4 = 16 \\). Yep, that's right.\n\nNext, the angle part: \\( 8 \\times -\\frac{\\pi}{4} = -2\\pi \\). Hmm, so the angle is \\( -2\\pi \\). But angles are periodic with period \\( 2\\pi \\), so adding \\( 2\\pi \\) to \\( -2\\pi \\) gives 0. So, effectively, the angle is 0. \n\nTherefore, \\( \\cos(-2\\pi) = \\cos(0) = 1 \\), and \\( \\sin(-2\\pi) = \\sin(0) = 0 \\). \n\nPutting it all together, \\( (1 - i)^8 = 16 \\times (1 + 0i) = 16 \\). \n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the modulus of \\( (1 - i)^8 \\). The modulus of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). But in this case, the result is 16, which is a real number, so its modulus is just 16. \n\nAlternatively, since modulus has a property that \\( |z^n| = |z|^n \\). So maybe there's a shortcut here. Let me check that way too. \n\nThe modulus of \\( 1 - i \\)"

That might have been a quicker way without converting to polar form.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the modulus is 16.
