            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the cube root of the square root of the square root of 1/729. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it will make more sense. Let me write it out again to visualize it better: \u221a(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))). \n\nFirst, I should probably figure out what each of these roots is. Starting from the inside, we have \u221a(1/729). I know that 729 is a perfect square, right? Let me check: 27 squared is 729 because 25 squared is 625 and 26 squared is 676, so 27 squared must be 729. So, \u221a(1/729) would be sqrt(1)/sqrt(729). The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729 is 27, so that simplifies to 1/27.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, \u221a(1/729) is the same as 1 divided by the square root of 729. Since sqrt(729) is 27, then yes, \u221a(1/729) is 1/27. Okay, so now we have the cube root of that result. So it's \u221b(1/27). Let me think about cube roots. I know that 3 cubed is 27, so the cube root of 27 is 3. Therefore, \u221b(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nSo now the expression is simplified to \u221a(1/3). Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check. Starting from the inside: sqrt(1/729) is 1/27. Then the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then the outermost operation is another square root of 1/3. So, \u221a(1/3) is the last operation. \n\nHmm, so \u221a(1/3) can be written as sqrt(1)/sqrt(3), which is 1/sqrt(3). But the problem asks for a rational denominator, right? So having a square root in the denominator isn't preferred. To rationalize the denominator, I need to get rid of the sqrt(3) in the denominator.\n\nTo do that, I multiply both the numerator and denominator by sqrt(3). So"

            "output": " that would give me (1 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)). The denominator becomes sqrt(9), which is 3. So the result is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me go through each part again step by step. \n\nOriginal expression: sqrt(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))). \n\nFirst step: compute the innermost radical, which is \u221a(1/729). \n\nSince 729 is 27 squared, sqrt(729) is 27, so sqrt(1/729) is 1/27. \n\nSecond step: take the cube root of that result. So \u221b(1/27). Since 3^3 is 27, the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. \n\nThird step: take the square root of that result. So sqrt(1/3). \n\nNow, sqrt(1/3) is equal to 1/sqrt(3). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\n(1 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/3. \n\nYes, that seems right. Let me check if there's another way to approach this by expressing everything with exponents instead of radicals. Maybe that can confirm my answer.\n\nStarting with the original expression:\n\nsqrt(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))) can be written using exponents. \n\nFirst, the innermost radical is the square root of (1/729), which is (1/729)^(1/2). \n\nThen, the cube root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6). \n\nThen, the outermost square root is [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12). \n\nHmm, so the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12). Let me see if that's equivalent to sqrt(3)/3. \n\nAlternatively"

            "output": ", let me compute (1/729)^(1/12). \n\nI know that 729 is 9^3, which is (3^2)^3 = 3^6. So 729 = 3^6. Therefore, 1/729 = 3^(-6). \n\nSo, (1/729)^(1/12) = (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/sqrt(3). \n\nOh, wait, that's the same as before. So sqrt(1/3) is equal to 1/sqrt(3), which rationalized is sqrt(3)/3. Hmm, so that's consistent. Therefore, I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the exponents another way. 729 is 9^3, and 9 is 3^2, so 729 is (3^2)^3 = 3^(2*3) = 3^6. So, sqrt(1/729) is (1/3^6)^(1/2) = 1/3^(6*(1/2)) = 1/3^3 = 1/27. Then the cube root of 1/27 is (1/3^3)^(1/3) = 1/3. Then the square root of 1/3 is 1/sqrt(3), which is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nYeah, same result. So that seems to confirm that the simplified form is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, let me try another approach without rationalizing immediately. Maybe I can express all the roots as exponents and then combine them. So starting over, the expression is:\n\nsqrt(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))).\n\nExpressed with exponents, that's:\n\n( ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) )^(1/2).\n\nMultiplying exponents: 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2 = (1/2)^2 * (1/3) = 1/4 * 1/3 = 1/12. So the whole thing is (1/729)^(1/12). As above, since 729 = 3^6, we"

Therefore, I think the answer is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a different way someone might approach this and get a different answer. For example, maybe miscalculating the exponents? Let me see. Suppose someone thought that the exponents add instead of multiply? Let's see. \n\nSuppose someone does sqrt(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))) and thinks that the exponents add up. The square root is exponent 1/2, cube root is 1/3, and another square root is 1/2. Adding them: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/2 = (3/6 + 2/6 + 3/6) = 8/6, which is not the case. But exponents multiply when you have a power raised to another power. So that's a common mistake, but I didn't do that here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might miscalculate 729 as 27 squared, which is correct, but maybe someone might think 729 is 3^6? Wait, 3^6 is 729. Let me confirm: 3^5 is 243, so 3^6 is 729. Yes. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the cube root of 1/27 is 1/9? Wait, no, because 3^3 is 27, so cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so I think my steps are correct. Therefore, the final answer should be sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but let me check once more with actual numbers. Let me compute each step numerically. \n\nFirst, compute 1/729. That's approximately 0.001371742. \n\nThen take the square root of that. sqrt(0.001371742)."

Let me compute 0.001371742^(1/2). \n\nCalculating it: let's think, 0.001371742 is approximately (0.037)^2 = 0.001369. So sqrt(0.001371742) is about 0.037.\n\nWait, that seems close. So about 0.037. \n\nNow, take the cube root of that. So cube root of ~0.037. \n\nCube root of 0.027 is 0.3, since 0.3^3 is 0.027. Since 0.037 is a bit more, the cube root would be a bit more than 0.3. Let me see: 0.34^3 is 0.0393, which is close to 0.037. So cube root of 0.037 is approximately 0.33.\n\nNow, take the square root of that result, ~0.33. \n\nsqrt(0.33) is about 0.574, because 0.574^2 is approximately 0.33. \n\nNow, let's compute sqrt(3)/3 numerically. sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 1.732/3 is about 0.577. \n\nWait, my approximate calculation gave me ~0.574, and 0.577 is the value of sqrt(3)/3. The slight difference is likely due to rounding errors in my approximation steps. \n\nTherefore, the exact value is sqrt(3)/3, which is approximately 0.577. So this numerical approximation supports my algebraic solution. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the simplified form of the expression with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified expression is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\\), we proceed step by step as follows:\n\n1.
