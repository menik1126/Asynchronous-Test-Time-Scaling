Let's say the number of blue marbles is \\(4x\\) and the number of yellow marbles is \\(3x\\).\n\nNext, I'll consider the change in the number of marbles after adding and removing. Adding 5 blue marbles brings the blue marbles to \\(4x + 5\\), and removing 3 yellow marbles reduces the yellow marbles to \\(3x - 3\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, after these changes, the ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 7:3. So, I can set up the equation \\(\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\\).\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), I'll cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions: \\(3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\\).\n\nExpanding both sides gives \\(12x + 15 = 21x - 21\\).\n\nBringing like terms to one side, I subtract \\(12x\\) from both sides to get \\(15 = 9x - 21\\).\n\nThen, I'll add 21 to both sides to find \\(36 = 9x\\), and finally, divide both sides by 9 to determine that \\(x = 4\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 4\\) back into the original variables, the number of blue marbles before adding more is \\(4x = 16\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Let\u2019s define:**\n- Let \\( x \\) be the common multiplier for the ratio.\n- Number of blue marbles initially = \\(4x\\)\n- Number of yellow marbles initially = \\(3x\\)\n\n**After the changes:**\n- Blue marbles added: \\(5\\)\n- Yellow marbles removed: \\(3\\)\n\n**New counts:**\n- Blue marbles = \\(4x + 5\\)\n- Yellow marbles = \\(3x - 3\\)\n\n**Given new ratio:**\n\\[\n\\frac{Blue\\ marbles}{Yellow\\ marbles} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Cross-multiply to eliminate fractions.\n\\[\n3(4"
