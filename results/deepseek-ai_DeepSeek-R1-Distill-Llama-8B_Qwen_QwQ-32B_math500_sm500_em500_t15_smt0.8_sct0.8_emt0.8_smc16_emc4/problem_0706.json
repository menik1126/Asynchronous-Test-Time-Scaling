            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola given by the equation x = y² - 4y - 1 has. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. \n\nFirst off, I remember that intercepts are points where the graph crosses the axes. The x-intercepts happen where y=0, and the y-intercepts happen where x=0. So, in this case, we're specifically looking for the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. Wait, no, actually, it's the y-intercepts, so that's where x=0, and y can be any value. Got it.\n\nAlright, so to find the y-intercepts, I should set x equal to 0 and solve for y. Let me write that down:\n\n0 = y² - 4y - 1.\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of y. Quadratic equations can have up to two real solutions, right? But I need to solve this equation to see exactly how many solutions there are, which will tell me the number of y-intercepts.\n\nSo, the equation is y² - 4y - 1 = 0. To solve this, I can either factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it factors.\n\nLooking at the coefficients, I have 1y² -4y -1. I need two numbers that multiply to -1 (the constant term) and add up to -4 (the coefficient of y). Hmm, let's see: factors of -1 are 1 and -1. If I take 1 and -1, their product is -1, and their sum is 0, which isn't -4. So, factoring doesn't seem straightforward here. Maybe it doesn't factor nicely, so I should use the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula is y = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a), where a=1, b=-4, and c=-1. Plugging these into the formula:\n\ny = [4 ± sqrt((-4)² - 4*1*(-1))] / (2*1)\ny = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 4)] / 2\ny = [4 ± sqrt(20)] / 2\n\nWait, sqrt(20) can be simplified. Sqrt(20"

            "output": ") is sqrt(4*5) which is 2*sqrt(5). So substituting that back in:\n\ny = [4 ± 2sqrt(5)] / 2\n\nI can factor out a 2 in the numerator:\n\ny = 2 ± sqrt(5)\n\nSo that gives two solutions: y = 2 + sqrt(5) and y = 2 - sqrt(5). Since sqrt(5) is an irrational number approximately equal to 2.236, then 2 + sqrt(5) is about 4.236 and 2 - sqrt(5) is about -0.236. Both of these are real numbers, so that means there are two real solutions for y when x=0. \n\nTherefore, the graph of the parabola x = y² -4y -1 crosses the y-axis at two points. \n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with setting x=0, that's correct for y-intercepts. The equation becomes y² -4y -1 =0. Quadratic formula applied with a=1, b=-4, c=-1. The discriminant is b² -4ac = 16 -4(1)(-1) = 16 +4 =20. Since the discriminant is positive (20>0), there are two distinct real roots. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the number of y-intercepts is two. \n\nHmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I should visualize the parabola. The equation is given in terms of x being a function of y, which means it's a parabola that opens either to the right or to the left. Since the coefficient of y² is positive (1), it opens to the right. \n\nParabolas that open left or right can have multiple x-intercepts or y-intercepts. Since we're looking for y-intercepts, which are points where x=0, so plugging in x=0 gives the y-values. Since the quadratic equation had two real roots, that's two points where the parabola crosses the y-axis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the standard form of a parabola that opens horizontally. The standard form is (y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h). Comparing that to"

            "output": " our equation, which is x = y² -4y -1, I can rewrite it as y² -4y -1 -x =0. Hmm, maybe completing the square on the y terms would help.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nStarting with x = y² -4y -1.\n\nI can rewrite this as x = (y² -4y) -1.\n\nTo complete the square for y² -4y, take half of -4, which is -2, square it to get 4. So,\n\nx = (y² -4y +4 -4) -1\nx = (y² -4y +4) -4 -1\nx = (y -2)^2 -5\n\nSo, the equation becomes x = (y -2)^2 -5.\n\nIn standard form, this is (y -2)^2 = x +5. So, comparing to (y -k)^2 = 4p(x - h), we have 4p =1, so p=1/4, and h=-5. The vertex is at (h, k) = (-5, 2). Since p is positive, the parabola opens to the right.\n\nSo, from the standard form, the y-intercepts occur where x=0, which is (y -2)^2 = 5. Taking square roots, y -2 = ±sqrt(5), so y = 2 ± sqrt(5), which are the two solutions I found earlier. \n\nTherefore, yes, completing the square also confirms that there are two y-intercepts.\n\nWait, another thought: the parabola opens to the right, so it's symmetric about the line y=2. The y-intercepts are the points to the left of the vertex, but since x=0 is less than x=-5 (the vertex x-coordinate is -5), the parabola must cross the y-axis twice. So, that also makes sense. \n\nI think I've covered this from multiple angles now, and each time I arrive at the conclusion that there are two y-intercepts. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the answer is two.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of y-intercepts for the parabola given by \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set \\( x"
