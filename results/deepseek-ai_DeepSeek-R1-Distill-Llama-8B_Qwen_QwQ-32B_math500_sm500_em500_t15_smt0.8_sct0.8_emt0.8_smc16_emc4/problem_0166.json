            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, cube roots can be tricky, but I think I can figure this out step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I got it right: \u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16. Okay, so the cube root of that quadratic expression is 16. \n\nFirst, I remember that if there's a cube root on one side of the equation, I can get rid of it by cubing both sides. That should simplify things a bit. So, if I cube both sides, the left side should just become x\u00b2 - 4x + 4, and the right side will be 16 cubed. Let me calculate 16 cubed. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... hmm, 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, the equation now becomes x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nNext, I need to solve for x in this quadratic equation. To do that, I should probably move everything to one side so that the equation equals zero. Subtracting 4096 from both sides gives x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, so the equation is now x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -4, and c = -4092. I can try to solve this using the quadratic formula, which is x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a). Plugging in the values, b is -4, so -b is 4. Then, b squared is (-4)\u00b2 = 16. Next, 4ac is 4*1*(-4092) = -16368. So, the discriminant, which is the part under the square root, is 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding, so 16 + 16368 ="

            "output": " 16384.\n\nNow, the square root of 16384. Hmm, I think 128 squared is 16384 because 128 times 128. Let me double-check that: 120 squared is 14400, and 8 squared is 64. So, (120 + 8) squared is 120\u00b2 + 2*120*8 + 8\u00b2 = 14400 + 1920 + 64 = 14400 + 1920 is 16320, plus 64 is 16384. Yep, that's right. So, the square root is 128.\n\nPutting it all back into the quadratic formula: x = (4 \u00b1 128) / (2*1) = (4 \u00b1 128)/2. So, that gives two possible solutions: one where it's 4 + 128 over 2, and the other where it's 4 - 128 over 2.\n\nLet's calculate both:\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128) / 2 = 132 / 2 = 66.\n\nSecond solution: (4 - 128) / 2 = (-124) / 2 = -62.\n\nSo, the two solutions are x = 66 and x = -62. But wait, the original equation had a cube root. Cube roots are defined for all real numbers, so negative numbers are okay. However, let me plug them back into the original equation to make sure they actually work.\n\nFirst, testing x = 66:\n\nCalculate x\u00b2 - 4x + 4. 66 squared is 4356. 4 times 66 is 264. So, 4356 - 264 = 4092. 4092 + 4 is 4096. So, the cube root of 4096. Wait, earlier I found that 16 cubed is 4096. So, yes, the cube root of 4096 is indeed 16. So x = 66 works.\n\nNow, testing x = -62:\n\nAgain, x squared is (-62)\u00b2 = 3844. 4 times x is 4*(-62) = -248. So, 3844 - (-248) is the same as 3844 + 248. Let's add those: 3844 + 200 is 4044, plus 48 is 4092. Then, adding 4 gives 4096"
