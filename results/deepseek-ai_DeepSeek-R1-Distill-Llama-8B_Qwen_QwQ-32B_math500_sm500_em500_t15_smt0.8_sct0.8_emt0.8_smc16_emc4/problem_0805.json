            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. The polynomial is given as f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0, where a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. \n\nHmm, let me start by recalling some properties of polynomials with integer coefficients. If the polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, then by Vieta's formulas, the sum and products of the roots relate to the coefficients. Specifically, for a monic polynomial, the coefficients can be expressed in terms of the roots. But here, the leading coefficient a_n is 2, not 1, so I might need to adjust Vieta's formulas accordingly.\n\nLet me denote the roots by r_1, r_2, ..., r_n. Since the polynomial has integer coefficients, the roots must satisfy certain conditions. In particular, if the polynomial is monic, then the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}, but here it's not monic. So, I think the sum of the roots would be -a_{n-1}/(a_n). Since a_n is 2, the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}/2.\n\nAlso, the product of the roots is (-1)^n * a_0 / a_n. Given that a_0 is 66 and a_n is 2, the product of the roots is (-1)^n * 66 / 2 = (-1)^n * 33.\n\nSo, we have that the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. But since the roots are integers, I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33. \n\nWait, 33 factors into 1, 3, 11, and 33. But since the roots are distinct, they can't repeat. So, possible roots could be 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, 33, -33. Also, considering that 33 is 3*11, but perhaps including some negative numbers would help in getting the sum to be a certain value.\n\n"

            "output": "But actually, the product of the roots in terms of the polynomial is (-1)^n * 33, so depending on the number of roots, the product's sign will be determined. Since the coefficients are integers, and the roots are integers, the roots have to multiply to 33 or -33. Since all roots are integers and distinct, perhaps we need to consider all possible factorizations of 33 into distinct integers. Let's note that 33 can be written as 33*1, or 3*11, etc. Also, including negative numbers might allow more flexibility, so maybe the roots can be both positive and negative to adjust the sum.\n\nThe key is that I need to choose roots such that their product is either 33 or -33 (depending on n's parity), but since the roots can be positive or negative, maybe I can choose roots to make the product positive or negative as needed. Alternatively, perhaps I can choose the roots such that the product is 33 or -33, but since the roots are distinct integers, we need to list all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33 and find the set with the minimal possible absolute sum.\n\nWait, actually, since the leading coefficient is 2, the polynomial can be written as f(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Therefore, expanding this, the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to -2*(sum of roots). Because when you expand the product, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is -2(r1 + r2 + ... + rn). Therefore, the absolute value of a_{n-1} is 2 times the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Therefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need the absolute value of the sum of the roots to be as small as possible, right?\n\nYes, so the problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers (roots) whose product is either 33 or -33 (since a0 is 66, and the product of roots is 66/(2)*(-1)^n, so actually, product of roots is (a0 / a_n)*(-1)^n.

Therefore, the product is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. So, the roots multiply to \u00b133.\n\nSo, the roots are distinct integers whose product is \u00b133. So, 33 can be factored into 1, 3, 11, 33 and their negatives.\n\nSo, perhaps the roots are 1, -1, 3, 11, etc., as factors of 33. But I need the product to be either 33 or -33, so I can have some negative roots to flip the sign.\n\nGiven that, I need to choose a set of distinct integers whose product is \u00b133 and whose sum is as close to 0 as possible because the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}/2, so minimizing |sum| will minimize |a_{n-1}|.\n\nWait, so the smaller the absolute value of the sum of the roots, the better. So, I need a set of distinct integers (with product \u00b133) whose sum is as small as possible in absolute value.\n\nSo, let me consider possible sets of roots.\n\nFirst, the prime factors of 33 are 3 and 11, and 1 and 33. Since we need distinct integers, we can use 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, 33, -33.\n\nBut if I include both a number and its negative, then their product is -1, which might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's better to have only positive or only negative numbers.\n\nWait, but 33 has factors that are both positive and negative.

Alternatively, maybe with more roots, but using 1 and -1 to adjust the product?\n\nWait, but if the product is 33, then if I have more roots, I need to include 1 and -1 in such a way that their product still gives 33. For example, 3, 11, 1, and 1 would be duplicates, so that's not allowed. Alternatively, 3, 11, 1, and -1. Then the product would be 3*11*1*(-1) = -33.

So to get a0=66, the product of the roots multiplied by 2 must be 66. Since the product of roots is (-1)^n*(a0/a_n)= (-1)^n*(66/2)= (-1)^n*33. Wait, actually, let me get back to Vieta's formula correctly:\n\nVieta's formula says that the product of the roots is (-1)^n * (a_0)/a_n. Wait, the constant term is a0, and in the polynomial written as a_n(x - r1)...(x - rn), the constant term is a_n*(-1)^n * r1 r2...rn. So, indeed, the product of the roots is (a0 / a_n) * (-1)^n. Wait, actually, let me recheck:\n\nSuppose f(x) = a_n (x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Then expanding this, the constant term is a_n*(-r1)*(-r2)*...*(-rn) = a_n*(-1)^n * (r1 r2 ... rn). \n\nGiven that the constant term is a_0, so a0 = a_n*(-1)^n*(product of roots). Therefore, product of roots = (-1)^n * (a0/a_n).\n\nTherefore, in our case, since a0=66 and a_n=2, product of roots is (-1)^n*(66/2)= (-1)^n*33. So the product of roots is either +33 or -33, depending on the parity of n. So, if we have three roots (so n=3, odd), product must be -33, so product of roots must equal -33.

Then product is -33, so since n=4 (even), the product is (-1)^4*33=33. That's a conflict. So, that can't be. So that would not be allowed.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose n=4. Then the product is 33. So the product of four roots must be 33. So factors have to multiply to 33. But 33 factors into primes 3 and 11. So to get four distinct integers, we need to include 1, -1, and maybe split 3 or 11 into smaller factors. But since they are primes, we can\u2019t. So the only way is to use 1, -1 and include 3, 11 as well. Hence the roots 1, -1, 3, -11 or permutations, as before.\n\nAlternatively, 1, -1, -3, 11 gives product=33. Sum is 8, so |sum|=8. Alternatively, is there a way to get a smaller sum?\n\nWhat about using more numbers like 1, -1, 3, -11, which gives sum -8, but that's absolute 8.\n\nAlternatively, can we use 1, -2, 3, 11? Their product is 1*(-2)*3*11= -66, which is double? Not 33. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 3, -1, 11, and something else? 3*(-1)*11*x=33 \u2192 x= -1. But that would repeat -1. Not allowed.\n\nHmm, seems like with four roots, the minimal sum's absolute value is 8. So leading to |a_{n-1}|=16.\n\nAlternatively, can we have five roots? Let's see. With five roots, the product must be 33 (since n even, so product 33).\n\nFive distinct integers multiplying to"
