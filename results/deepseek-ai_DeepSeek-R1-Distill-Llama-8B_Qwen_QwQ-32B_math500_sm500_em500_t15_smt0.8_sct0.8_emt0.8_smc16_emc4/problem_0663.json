            "output": "First, I need to define variables for each item to represent their weights.\n\nLet T represent the weight of one treek, S for one squig, and G for one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, I know that 10 treeks equal 3 squigs and 1 goolee. So, 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says that two treeks and one goolee equal one squig. That gives me 2T + G = S.\n\nI can solve this system of equations by substitution. From the second equation, G = S - 2T. I'll substitute this into the first equation.\n\nSubstituting G into 10T = 3S + G, I get 10T = 3S + (S - 2T), which simplifies to 10T = 4S - 2T.\n\nAdding 2T to both sides, the equation becomes 12T = 4S. Dividing both sides by 4, I find that 3T = S.\n\nThis means that one squig weighs the same as three treeks.\n\nTo find how many treeks equal one squig, I can express it as 3T = S, so the combined weight of three treeks equals one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\nLet:\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Equations**\nFrom the problem:\n1. \\( 10T = 3S + G \\) \n2. \\( 2T + G = S \\)\n\n**Step 3: Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1**\nFrom equation 2:\n\\[ G = S - 2T \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( G \\) into equation 1:\n\\[ 10T = 3S + (S - 2T) \\]\n\\[ 10T = 4S - 2T \\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( T \\) in Terms of \\( S \\)**\n\\[ 10T + 2T = 4S \\]\n\\[ 12T = 4S \\]\n\\[ 3T = S \\]\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the Result"
