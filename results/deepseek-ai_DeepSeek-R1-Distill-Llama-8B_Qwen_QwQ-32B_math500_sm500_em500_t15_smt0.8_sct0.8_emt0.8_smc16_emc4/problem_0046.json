Since 284 is even, 2 is a divisor.\n\nNext, I'll check if 4 divides 284. 284 divided by 4 is 71, so 4 is also a divisor.\n\nI'll then check if 71 divides 284. 284 divided by 71 is exactly 4, so 71 is a divisor as well.\n\nSince 284 is the product of the prime factors 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 71, the divisors are 1, 2, 4, and 284.\n\nNow, I'll exclude 284 from the list of divisors to find the proper divisors, which are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nFinally, I'll sum these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\nSo, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 7.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nWhat is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284?\n\n**Step 1: Find the Proper Divisors of 284**\nA proper divisor of a number is a positive divisor that is less than the number itself.\n\nFirst, let's find all the proper divisors of 284.\n\n- **Divisors of 284:**\n  To find the divisors, we can factorize 284.\n\n  - **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n    - 284 \u00f7 2 = 142\n    - 142 \u00f7 2 = 71\n    - 71 is a prime number.\n\n  - **Therefore, 284 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71\u00b9**\n\n  - **All Divisors:**\n    - The divisors are formed by multiplying different combinations of the prime factors.\n    - Divisors = 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, 284.\n\n  - **Proper Divisors (excluding 284):**\n    - 1, 2, 4, 71, 142.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Sum of the Proper Divisors of "
