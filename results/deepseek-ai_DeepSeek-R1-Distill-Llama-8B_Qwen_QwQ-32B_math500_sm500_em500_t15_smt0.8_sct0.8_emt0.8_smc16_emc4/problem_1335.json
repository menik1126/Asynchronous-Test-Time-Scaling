The equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, so I need to find all the complex solutions to this equation and then sum them up. That sounds like it involves some complex analysis, but I'm not sure where to start. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I notice that each term on the left side is of the form \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\), where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe I can rewrite each term to make it easier to handle. Let's see, I can factor each denominator:\n\n- \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\)\n- \\(x^2 - 2 = (x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})\\)\n- \\(x^2 - 3 = (x - \\sqrt{3})(x + \\sqrt{3})\\)\n- \\(x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\\)\n\nSo, each term is a rational function with linear factors in the denominator. This might be useful later on, maybe for partial fractions or something. But right now, I'm not sure how helpful that is.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that the left side has terms that could relate to derivatives or something, but that seems a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe I can consider substitution or transforming the equation somehow.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when you have an equation like this, especially with multiple terms, it might be helpful to make a substitution. Let me consider setting \\(y = x^2\\). Then the denominators become \\(y - 1\\), \\(y - 2\\), \\(y - 3\\), \\(y - 4\\). But I'm not sure if that helps directly because the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac"

Maybe that substitution isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider moving all terms to one side and then trying to find roots. Let me denote the left-hand side (LHS) as \\(f(x)\\) and the right-hand side (RHS) as \\(g(x) = 2010x - 4\\). So the equation is \\(f(x) - g(x) = 0\\). The solutions are the roots of this equation. Since we need the sum of all complex solutions, maybe there's a way to use Vieta's formula here?\n\nBut Vieta's formula applies to polynomials, and this equation isn't a polynomial. However, perhaps if I can manipulate it into a polynomial equation, then I can use Vieta's theorem. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's note that the denominators on the LHS are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). So the common denominator would be the product of all these denominators. That's going to be a big polynomial, but maybe manageable?\n\nLet me denote the denominators as follows:\n\nLet \\(D(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). Then, multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(D(x)\\) would eliminate all denominators. Let's try that.\n\nMultiplying through by \\(D(x)\\):\n\n\\[\nD(x) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} \\right) = D(x) \\cdot (2010x - 4)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\nEach term in the sum will have \\(D(x)\\) divided by one of the denominators, so:\n\n- The first term becomes \\( (x^2 -"
