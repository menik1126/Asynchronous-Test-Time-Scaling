Each digit in base six represents a power of six.\n\nFirst, I need to express 999 in terms of its place values in base ten. The number can be broken down into three digits: 9 hundreds, 9 tens, and 9 ones. \n\nNext, I'll convert each digit to its equivalent value in base six. I know that 6 is the base, so each place represents 6^0, 6^1, and 6^2.\n\nFor the units place, 9 in base ten is the same as 9 in base six, since 9 is less than 6. \n\nFor the tens place, 9 in base ten is equal to 1 in base six multiplied by 6. This is because 9 divided by 6 equals 1 with a remainder of 3.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 9 in base ten is equal to 1 in base six multiplied by 6 squared, which is 6 multiplied by 6, giving 36.\n\nFinally, I'll sum the values from each place to get the final base six number. Adding them together, 36 plus 6 plus 9 equals 51. Therefore, the base six equivalent of 999 in base ten is 51.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number **999**, we'll convert each digit of the number from base ten to base six.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Understand Place Values:**\n   - In base ten, each digit represents a power of ten:\n     - \\(9 \\) is in the **hundreds** place (\\(9 \\times 10^2\\))\n     - \\(9\\) is in the **tens** place (\\(9 \\times 10^1\\))\n     - \\(9\\) is in the **ones** place (\\(9 \\times 10^0\\))\n   \n2. **Convert Each Digit to Base Six:**\n   - Since each digit in base ten can be directly converted to base six if it is less than six, we can use the same digits.\n   \n3. **Express 999 in Base Six:**\n   - \\(999_{10} = (9 \\times 6^2) + (9 \\times 6^1) + (9 \\times"
