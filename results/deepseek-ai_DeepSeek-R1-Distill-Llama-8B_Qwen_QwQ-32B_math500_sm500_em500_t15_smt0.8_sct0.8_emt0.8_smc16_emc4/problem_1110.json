            "output": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here where y varies inversely as the square root of x. Hmm, I think inverse variation means that as one thing increases, the other decreases in such a way that their product is constant. Let me try to remember the formula for inverse variation.\n\nIf y varies inversely as \u221ax, I think the formula should be y = k / \u221ax, where k is the constant of proportionality. Yeah, that sounds right. So first, I need to find the value of k using the given information. They told me that when x is 24, y is 15. Let me plug those values into the formula to find k.\n\nSo substituting x = 24 and y = 15 into y = k / \u221ax, I get 15 = k / \u221a24. Hmm, I need to solve for k. To do that, I can multiply both sides by \u221a24. So, k = 15 * \u221a24.\n\nWait, let me calculate \u221a24. I know that 4 times 6 is 24, and \u221a24 is equal to \u221a(4*6) which is \u221a4 * \u221a6, so that's 2\u221a6. So, \u221a24 is 2\u221a6. Therefore, k is 15 times 2\u221a6, right? That would make k = 30\u221a6.\n\nSo now I have the formula y = 30\u221a6 / \u221ax. The next part of the problem asks me to find x when y is 3. So, let me set y to 3 and solve for x.\n\nPlugging in y = 3, the equation becomes 3 = 30\u221a6 / \u221ax. To solve for \u221ax, I can rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by \u221ax to get 3\u221ax = 30\u221a6. Then, divide both sides by 3 to get \u221ax = 10\u221a6.\n\nNow, to find x, I need to square both sides of the equation. So, (\u221ax)^2 = (10\u221a6)^2, which simplifies to x = 100 * 6. 100 times 6 is 600. So, x should be 600 when y is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. Starting from y = 3, plugging into y = 30\u221a6 / \u221ax. 3 = 30"

            "output": "\u221a6 / \u221ax. Multiplying both sides by \u221ax: 3\u221ax = 30\u221a6. Dividing by 3: \u221ax = 10\u221a6. Squaring both sides: x = (10\u221a6)^2 = 100 * 6 = 600. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about inverse variation: y * \u221ax = k. So when y=15 and x=24, 15 * \u221a24 = k. \u221a24 is 2\u221a6, so k = 15 * 2\u221a6 = 30\u221a6. Then when y=3, 3 * \u221ax = 30\u221a6, so \u221ax = 10\u221a6, leading to x=600. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is x=600.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), which gives the relationship \\( y = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}} \\).\n\n1. **Find the constant of proportionality \\( k \\):**\n   - Given \\( x = 24 \\) and \\( y = 15 \\):\n     \\[\n     15 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{24}} \\implies k = 15 \\times \\sqrt{24}\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( \\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6} \\):\n     \\[\n     k = 15 \\times 2\\sqrt{6} = 30\\sqrt{6}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Use the constant \\( k \\) to find \\( x \\) when \\( y = 3 \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( y = 3 \\) into the equation \\( y = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}} \\):\n     \\[\n     3 = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}} \\implies 3\\sqrt{x} = 30\\sqrt{6}\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( \\sqrt{x} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{x} = 10\\sqrt{6}\n     \\]\n   - Square both sides to find \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = (10\\sqrt{6})^2 = 100 \\times 6 = 600\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer"
