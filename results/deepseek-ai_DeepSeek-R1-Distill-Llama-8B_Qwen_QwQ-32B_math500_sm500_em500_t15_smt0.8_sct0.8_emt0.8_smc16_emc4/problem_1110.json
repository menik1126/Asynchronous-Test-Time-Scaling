            "output": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here where y varies inversely as the square root of x. Hmm, I think inverse variation means that as one thing increases, the other decreases in such a way that their product is constant. Let me try to remember the formula for inverse variation.\n\nIf y varies inversely as √x, I think the formula should be y = k / √x, where k is the constant of proportionality. Yeah, that sounds right. So first, I need to find the value of k using the given information. They told me that when x is 24, y is 15. Let me plug those values into the formula to find k.\n\nSo substituting x = 24 and y = 15 into y = k / √x, I get 15 = k / √24. Hmm, I need to solve for k. To do that, I can multiply both sides by √24. So, k = 15 * √24.\n\nWait, let me calculate √24. I know that 4 times 6 is 24, and √24 is equal to √(4*6) which is √4 * √6, so that's 2√6. So, √24 is 2√6. Therefore, k is 15 times 2√6, right? That would make k = 30√6.\n\nSo now I have the formula y = 30√6 / √x. The next part of the problem asks me to find x when y is 3. So, let me set y to 3 and solve for x.\n\nPlugging in y = 3, the equation becomes 3 = 30√6 / √x. To solve for √x, I can rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by √x to get 3√x = 30√6. Then, divide both sides by 3 to get √x = 10√6.\n\nNow, to find x, I need to square both sides of the equation. So, (√x)^2 = (10√6)^2, which simplifies to x = 100 * 6. 100 times 6 is 600. So, x should be 600 when y is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. Starting from y = 3, plugging into y = 30√6 / √x. 3 = 30"

            "output": "√6 / √x. Multiplying both sides by √x: 3√x = 30√6. Dividing by 3: √x = 10√6. Squaring both sides: x = (10√6)^2 = 100 * 6 = 600. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about inverse variation: y * √x = k. So when y=15 and x=24, 15 * √24 = k. √24 is 2√6, so k = 15 * 2√6 = 30√6. Then when y=3, 3 * √x = 30√6, so √x = 10√6, leading to x=600. Yep, same result.\n\nI think that's solid.
