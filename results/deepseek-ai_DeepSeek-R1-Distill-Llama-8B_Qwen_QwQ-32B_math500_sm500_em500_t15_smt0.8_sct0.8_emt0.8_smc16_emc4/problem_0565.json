These groups must each occupy a contiguous block around the table.\n\nSince it's a circular table, the arrangement is considered equivalent if one can be rotated to form another. This means that we can fix the position of one group to eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\nI'll fix the Independent's position to simplify the problem. Now, the remaining seats are divided into two segments: one on either side of the Independent. Each segment will accommodate one of the political parties.\n\nThere are two possible ways to assign the Democrats and Republicans to these segments: Democrats on the left and Republicans on the right, or Republicans on the left and Democrats on the right.\n\nFor each arrangement, the members within a party can be arranged among themselves. The number of ways to arrange 5 Democrats in a line is 5!, and similarly, the number of ways to arrange 5 Republicans is also 5!.\n\nFinally, since the table is circular and the Independent's position is fixed, the only remaining choice is which party occupies the first segment to the left of the Independent. As determined earlier, there are 2 choices for this assignment.\n\nCombining these factors, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is 2 multiplied by (5!) for the Democrats and (5!) for the Republicans. This results in 2 × 5! × 5!.\n\nSo, the total number of ways they can sit around the circular table is 2 × (5!) × (5!).\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table with all members of each party sitting next to each other. We'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Groupings:**\n   - **Democrats:** 5 members.\n   - **Republicans:** 5 members.\n   - **Independent:** 1 member.\n\n2. **Fix the Independent's Position:**\n   - Since the table is circular, we can fix the Independent's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. This leaves us with two segments on either side of the Independent.\n\n3. **Assign the Parties to Segments:**\n   - There are **2 choices** for assigning the two political parties to these segments:\n     - Democrats on the left and Republicans on the"
