Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero, provided the numerator isn't also zero there. So, I need to factor the denominator and find its roots. The denominator is x\u00b2 - 5x - 14. To factor this quadratic, I'll look for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see...  Maybe  -7 and +2? Because -7 * 2 = -14 and -7 + 2 = -5. So, yes, that factors to (x - 7)(x + 2). Therefore, the denominator is zero when x - 7 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, which means x = 7 and x = -2. So, the vertical asymptotes are at x = 7 and x = -2. Therefore, a = 7 and b = -2, or vice versa, but addition is commutative, so the order doesn't matter for the sum.\n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I recall that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator here is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. So, since the degree of the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. The leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the denominator's leading coefficient is 1. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is y = 2/1 = 2. So, c = 2.\n\nNow, let's compute a + b + c. From earlier, a = 7 and b = -2. Adding them together: 7 + (-2) = 5. Then, adding c, which is 2: 5 + 2 = 7.\n\nWait, let me just double-check. For vertical asymptotes, denominator roots are correct: 7 and -2, yes. Horizontal asymptote: degree 2 over degree 1, leading coefficients 2 and 1, so 2. Sum is 7 + (-2) + "

            "output": "2. Hmm, 7 minus 2 is 5, plus 2 is 7. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the horizontal asymptote? Let me recall the rules again. If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Wait, hold on! Wait, the numerator is degree 1, denominator is degree 2. So, the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote should be y = 0, not y = 2. Wait, did I mix up the rule?\n\nOh no, I think I messed up here. Let me check again. The horizontal asymptote for a rational function where the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator is indeed y = 0. If the degrees are equal, it's the ratio of leading coefficients. If the numerator's degree is higher, then you look at the leading terms and divide them. So in this case, since numerator is degree 1, denominator degree 2, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So c should be 0, not 2. That was my mistake earlier. \n\nSo, correcting that, c = 0. Therefore, a + b + c would be 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. Wait, so that's different. Hmm, so I need to figure out where I went wrong in my initial thought. \n\nWait, why did I think it was 2? Maybe I confused the leading coefficients. Let me see. The function is (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). The leading term of the numerator is 2x, and the leading term of the denominator is x\u00b2. So, as x approaches infinity, the function behaves like (2x)/(x\u00b2) = 2/x, which approaches 0. So yes, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Therefore, c is 0, not 2. So my first calculation was wrong, but I caught it when I double-checked. \n\nTherefore, the correct sum is 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Let me plug in a very large x value and see. Let's say x = 10^6. Then numerator is 2*(10^6) = 2*"

            "output": "10^6, denominator is (10^6)^2 -5*10^6 -14 \u2248 10^12. So the function is approximately 2*10^6 / 10^12 = 2*10^-6, which is approaching 0. So yes, horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Therefore, c = 0.\n\nSo, the sum a + b + c is 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in factoring the denominator. The denominator was x\u00b2 -5x -14. Let me try to factor it again: look for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Let me see: 2 and -7. Because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. So, yes, it factors into (x + 2)(x -7), so roots at x = -2 and x =7. Correct.\n\nSo, vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x =7, horizontal asymptote at y=0. So a=-2, b=7, c=0. Therefore, a + b + c is -2 + 7 + 0 =5. That's my final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). The horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Adding these values: \\( -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \\).\n\n\\boxed{5}"
