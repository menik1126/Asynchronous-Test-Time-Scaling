I remember that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\).

So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, two variables are equal?\n\nSuppose two variables are equal, say x=y.\n\nThen, from xyz=4, x² z=4.\n\nFrom x³ + y³ + z³ =2x³ + z³=4.\n\nThird equation: xy² +x² y +xz² +x² z + y z² + y² z =x^2 y +x y^2 +x z² +x^2 z + y z² + y² z\n\nSince x=y,\n\nthen:\n\nx^3 +x^3 +x z² +x^2 z +x z² +x^2 z = 2x^3 +2x z^2 +2x^2 z=4.\n\nHmm, perhaps messy. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the problem allows complex numbers, but the third equation is supposed to be 12, but in my example it's 12+6i. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the third equation.\n\nWait, let me recompute term5 and term6 again.\n\nTerm5: y z². y=1+i, z=1-i. z squared is (1-i)^2=1-2i +i²=1-2i-1= -2i. So, y*z²=(1+i)*(-2i)= -2i -2i²= -2i +2 (since i²=-1). So that's 2 -2i. Wait, no, (1+i)*(-2i)= -2i -2i². Since i²=-1, so -2i -2*(-1)= -2i +2. So that's 2 -2i. Wait, so term5 is 2 -2i?\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate term5 and term6 again carefully.\n\nTerm5: y z².\n\ny =1+i, z=1 -i.\n\nFirst compute z²: (1 -i)^2 =1 -2i +i² =1 -2i -1 = -2i.\n\nThen, y*z² = (1+i)*(-2i)"
