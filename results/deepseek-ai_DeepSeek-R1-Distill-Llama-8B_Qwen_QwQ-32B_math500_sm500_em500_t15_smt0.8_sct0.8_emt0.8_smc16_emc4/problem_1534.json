The problem is about a sequence of positive real numbers, \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\), and we're given three sums:\n\n1. The sum of the terms: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n2. The sum of the squares of the terms: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n3. The sum of the cubes of the terms: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nWe need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, we have these three equations involving sums of powers of the sequence terms. I remember that in such problems, sometimes we can relate these sums to each other using inequalities or by assuming all the terms are equal, but I need to think carefully.\n\nFirst, let me note that all \\( a_i \\) are positive real numbers, which is important because it might allow me to use certain inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or Power Mean.\n\nLet me write down the given information clearly:\n\n1. \\( S_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n2. \\( S_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n3. \\( S_3 = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nI wonder if there's a way to relate these sums to each other. Maybe by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality.\n\nWait, another approach could be to consider that if all the \\( a_i \\) are equal, then these sums would be related to each other in a specific way. Let me explore that.\n\nAssume all \\( a_i = k \\). Then,\n\n- \\( S_1 = n \\cdot k = 96 \\)\n- \\( S_2 = n \\cdot k^2 = 144 \\)\n- \\( S_3 = n \\cdot k^3 = 216 \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( k = \\frac{96}{n} \\).

Because if all variables have to be equal for the sums to satisfy these equations, then \\( n \\) must be 64. Or maybe there are other possibilities if the sequence isn't all equal? Let's see.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the variables are not all the same, but perhaps some of them are repeated, or maybe there's a specific distribution.\n\nWait, but if all \\( a_i \\) are equal, the only possible \\( n \\) is 64. But is there a reason to think that other \\( n \\) could satisfy the equations? Let me see.\n\nWe can try to use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\).

Therefore, the only possible solution is when all terms are equal, so n must be 64. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of n is just 64.\n\nBut the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n\". So maybe there is another case?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me check again.\n\nWe had:\n\n\\( p x^2 (2x - 3) + q y^2 (2y - 3) = 0 \\)\n\nSuppose that x > 3/2 and y < 3/2. Then, the first term is positive, the second term is negative. So, the equation can be written as:\n\n\\( p x^2 (2x - 3) = - q y^2 (2y - 3) \\)\n\nSince RHS is positive (because 2y -3 is negative, so negative times negative is positive), so LHS must equal RHS.
