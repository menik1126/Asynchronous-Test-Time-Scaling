Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember some logarithm rules. The sum of two logs with the same base can be written as the log of the product. So, log6(x - y) + log6(x + y) is the same as log6[(x - y)(x + y)]. That simplifies to log6 of (x\u00b2 - y\u00b2), right? Because (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares.\n\nSo the first equation becomes:\n\nlog6(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2.\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So in this case, 6^2 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. That simplifies to 36 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. I'll write that down:\n\nx\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36. (Equation 1)\n\nAlright, now moving on to the second equation: log base y of (5x) equals 2. So, let me rewrite that.\n\nlog_y(5x) = 2.\n\nAgain, converting this logarithmic equation to exponential form, I get y^2 = 5x. So:\n\ny\u00b2 = 5x. (Equation 2)\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36\n2. y\u00b2 = 5x\n\nI can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 to eliminate y\u00b2. So, replacing y\u00b2 with 5x in Equation 1 gives:\n\nx\u00b2 - (5x) = 36.\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for x. Let me try factoring it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see:\n\nFactors of 36: 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, "

Let's try 6 and -6: 6 * (-6) = -36, and 6 + (-6) = 0. Not quite.\n\nWait, maybe 9 and -4: 9 * (-4) = -36, and 9 + (-4) = 5. That's it! But wait, in the equation, it's x\u00b2 -5x -36, so we have a +5x. So actually, perhaps the factors are (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0. Let me check:\n\n(x - 9)(x + 4) = x\u00b2 +4x -9x -36 = x\u00b2 -5x -36. Yes, that works.\n\nSo the solutions are x = 9 or x = -4.\n\nBut wait, since we have logarithms in the original equations, we need to make sure that the arguments are positive. Let's check for each x.\n\nFirst, x = 9.\n\nFrom Equation 2: y\u00b2 = 5*9 = 45. So y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Which simplifies to 3*sqrt(5) or -3*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, check the first equation: log6(x - y) + log6(x + y) = 2.\n\nWe already have x = 9, so let's compute x - y and x + y.\n\nCase 1: y = 3\u221a5.\n\nx - y = 9 - 3\u221a5 \u2248 9 - 6.708 \u2248 2.292 > 0\n\nx + y = 9 + 3\u221a5 \u2248 9 + 6.708 \u2248 15.708 > 0\n\nSo both are positive, which is good because logarithms require positive arguments.\n\nCase 2: y = -3\u221a5.\n\nx - y = 9 - (-3\u221a5) = 9 + 3\u221a5 \u2248 15.708 > 0\n\nx + y = 9 + (-3\u221a5) \u2248 2.292 > 0\n\nSo regardless of the positive or negative y, both arguments are positive. So x = 9 is a valid"

So we can discard that.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nBut let me double-check everything to be sure.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nlog6(x - y) + log6(x + y) = log6[(x - y)(x + y)] = log6(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2.\n\nWe had x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36, so 6^2 = 36, which checks out.\n\nSecond equation: log_y(5x) = 2. So y^2 = 5x. With x =9, y\u00b2 = 45, so y = sqrt(45). Then log_{sqrt(45)}(5*9) = log_{sqrt(45)}(45). Let me see:\n\nLet me compute log base sqrt(45) of 45. Let me set log_{sqrt(45)}(45) = t. Then (sqrt(45))^t = 45.\n\nsqrt(45) is 45^(1/2), so (45^(1/2))^t = 45^(t/2) = 45^1. Therefore, t/2 =1, so t=2. Which matches the equation. So that works.\n\nTherefore, x=9 is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure there's no other possible solutions. Since the quadratic only had x=9 and x=-4, and x=-4 is invalid, so yes, x=9 is the only solution.\n\nHmm, seems solid. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we use the logarithm property to combine the logs in the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\n\nConverting to exponential form:\n\n\\[\n(x - y)(x + y) = 6^2 \\implies"
