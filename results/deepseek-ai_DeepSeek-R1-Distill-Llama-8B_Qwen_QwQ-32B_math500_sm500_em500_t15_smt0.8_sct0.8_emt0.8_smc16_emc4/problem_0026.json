The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, |1 - i| = \u221a(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = \u221a2.\n\nNext, I'll raise \u221a2 to the 8th power. Since (\u221a2)^2 = 2, raising it to the 8th power is the same as squaring it four times: (2)^4 = 16.\n\nTherefore, |(1 - i)^8| equals 16.\n</think>\n\nRiproarin' Ringo needs to calculate \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\). Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( |1 - i| \\):**\n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Raise \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) to the 8th power:**\n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
