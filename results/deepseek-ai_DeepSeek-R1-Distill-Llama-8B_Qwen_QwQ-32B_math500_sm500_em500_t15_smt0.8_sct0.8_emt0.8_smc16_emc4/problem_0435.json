            "output": "I need to find the remainder when the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 199 is divided by 7. \n\nFirst, I should determine how many terms are in this sequence. Since the sequence is 1, 3, 5, ..., 199, it's an arithmetic series with a common difference of 2. \n\nThe formula to find the number of terms is (last term - first term) divided by the common difference plus 1. So, (199 - 1)/2 + 1 equals 100 terms. \n\nNext, I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is (number of terms divided by 2) multiplied by (first term plus last term). That gives 100/2 multiplied by (1 + 199), resulting in 50 times 200, which equals 10,000. \n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I divide 10,000 by 7. 7 times 1428 is 9996, and the remainder is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum of the sequence \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + \\dots + 199\\) is divided by 7, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Terms**\n   - The sequence is an arithmetic series where:\n     - First term (\\(a\\)) = 1\n     - Common difference (\\(d\\)) = 2\n     - Last term (\\(l\\)) = 199\n   - The number of terms (\\(n\\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1 = \\frac{199 - 1}{2} + 1 = 100\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of the Series**\n   - The sum (\\(S\\)) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the known values:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{100}{2} \\times (1 + 199) = 50 \\times 200 = 10,000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Remainder When Divided by 7**\n   - To find \\(10"
