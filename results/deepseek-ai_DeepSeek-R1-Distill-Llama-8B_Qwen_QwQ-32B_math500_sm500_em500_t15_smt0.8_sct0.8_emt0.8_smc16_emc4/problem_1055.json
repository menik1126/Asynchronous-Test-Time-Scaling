Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nI remember something about the Rational Root Theorem from algebra. Let me try to recall. The Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, of a polynomial with integer coefficients must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, the possible values for p are the factors of 1, which are ±1, and the possible values for q are the factors of 2, which are ±1 and ±2.\n\nWait, so the possible p values are just 1 and -1 because those are the only factors of 1. And for q, we have 1, -1, 2, and -2. So, for each p, we can divide by each q to get possible rational roots.\n\nLet me list them. For p = 1:\n\n1/1 = 1\n\n1/(-1) = -1\n\n1/2 = 0.5\n\n1/(-2) = -0.5\n\nSimilarly, for p = -1:\n\n-1/1 = -1\n\n-1/(-1) = 1\n\n-1/2 = -0.5\n\n-1/(-2) = 0.5\n\nWait a second, I notice that some of these are repeats. For example, 1 and -1 are both obtained from both p=1 and p=-1 when divided by 1 and -1. Similarly, 0.5 and -0.5 are also repeats.\n\nSo, to get all unique possible rational roots, I need to list each unique value from the above. Let's go through them:\n\nFrom p=1 and q=1: 1\n\nFrom p=1 and q=-1: -1\n\nFrom p=1 and q=2: 0.5\n\nFrom p=1 and q=-2: -0.5\n\nFrom p=-1 and q=1: -1\n\nFrom p=-1 and q=-1"

Let me think. Since p can only be ±1 and q can only be ±1, ±2, we've captured all possible combinations. So, we don't have any other possible rational roots beyond these four.\n\nWait, but should I write them as fractions instead of decimals? Maybe that's more precise. So, 0.5 is 1/2 and -0.5 is -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are: ±1 and ±1/2. That's four different possible rational roots.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there a way to have other roots? Suppose we have other factors, but since the constant term is 1 and leading coefficient is 2, we can't get any other numerators or denominators. So, I think that's all.\n\nSo, in total, there are 4 different possible rational roots.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial has integer coefficients with a constant term of 1 and leading coefficient of 2. By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are ±1 and ±1/2. Thus, there are 4 different possible rational roots.\n\nThe number of different possible rational roots is \\boxed{4}."
