            "output": "First, I need to translate the given information into an equation. The problem states that half the value of \\(3x - 9\\) is equal to \\(x + 37\\). \n\nSo, I'll set up the equation by multiplying half of \\(3x - 9\\) to equal \\(x + 37\\). This gives me \\(\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\\).\n\nNext, I'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2. This simplifies the equation to \\(3x - 9 = 2x + 74\\).\n\nThen, I'll subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get all the x terms on one side. This results in \\(x - 9 = 74\\).\n\nAfter that, I'll add 9 to both sides to isolate the x term. This simplifies to \\(x = 83\\).\n\nFinally, I'll verify the solution by plugging \\(x = 83\\) back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal. This confirms that the value of \\(x\\) is indeed 83.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\(x\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Translate the statement into an equation:**\n   \n   \"Half the value of \\(3x - 9\\) is \\(x + 37\\).\"\n   \n   This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the equation:**\n   \n   Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2(x + 37)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \n   Add 9 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = 74 + 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 83\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   \n   Plug"
