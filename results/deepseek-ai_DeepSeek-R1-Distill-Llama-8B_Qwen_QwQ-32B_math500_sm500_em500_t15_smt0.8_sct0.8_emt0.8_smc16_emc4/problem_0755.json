The problem gives me a specific property about this sequence: for every positive integer k, two things are true. First, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. That means each term after the first is a multiple of the previous one by a common ratio. Second, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic, meaning each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference.\n\nAdditionally, I know that a_{13} is equal to 2016, and I need to find a\u2081, the first term of the sequence.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. For each k, the triplet a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, so I can denote the common ratio as r. That means a_{2k} = r * a_{2k-1} and a_{2k+1} = r * a_{2k} = r\u00b2 * a_{2k-1}. Similarly, the arithmetic triplet a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} implies that a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d, where d is the common difference.\n\nWait, but in the arithmetic progression, the common difference would be a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}, which is also equal to a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}. So, in notation, for each k:\n\n1. a_{2k} = r * a_{2k-1}\n2. a_{2k+1} = r * a_{2k}\n3. a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + (a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}) = 2 * a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}\n\nAlso, since the entire sequence is strictly increasing, each term is larger than the one before. Therefore, r must be greater than 1 because it's a geometric progression, and the common difference d must be"

Let's denote the first triplet (k=1):\n\n- The geometric triplet is a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083. So, a\u2082 = r\u2081 * a\u2081, and a\u2083 = r\u2081 * a\u2082 = r\u2081\u00b2 * a\u2081.\n\nThen the arithmetic triplet starting at a\u2082 is a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084. The common difference here is a\u2083 - a\u2082 = (r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081)a\u2081. Therefore, a\u2084 = a\u2083 + (a\u2083 - a\u2082) = 2a\u2083 - a\u2082 = 2r\u2081\u00b2 a\u2081 - r\u2081 a\u2081 = (2r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081)a\u2081.\n\nNow moving to k=2:\n\nThe next geometric triplet is a\u2083, a\u2084, a\u2085. Since this is geometric, the ratio here would be r\u2082. So, a\u2084 = r\u2082 * a\u2083, and a\u2085 = r\u2082 * a\u2084 = r\u2082\u00b2 * a\u2083.\n\nBut we already have an expression for a\u2084 from the previous step. Let me see if that holds. From the arithmetic triplet, a\u2084 = (2r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081)a\u2081. But also, a\u2084 = r\u2082 * a\u2083 = r\u2082 * r\u2081\u00b2 a\u2081. Therefore, equating these two expressions:\n\nr\u2082 * r\u2081\u00b2 a\u2081 = (2r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081)a\u2081 \u21d2 r\u2082 = (2r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081)/r\u2081\u00b2 = 2 - (1/r\u2081)\n\nHmm, interesting. Since r\u2082 must be a rational number (because all terms are integers and a\u2084 must be an integer multiple of a\u2083), and r\u2081 must also be an integer? Wait, not necessarily. Wait, the terms are integers, so the ratios must be rational? Or maybe integers?\n\nWait, actually, the terms are positive integers, so the ratios in the geometric sequences must be rational numbers such that when multiplied by the previous term, they give integers. But since the sequence is strictly increasing, the ratios must be greater than 1. Alternatively, maybe the ratios are integers? Let me think.\n\n"

Alternatively, if r is a fraction, say p/q, with p > q, then a_{2k+1} = (p/q)*a_{2k}, so a_{2k} must be a multiple of q to make a_{2k+1} an integer. But since the sequence is strictly increasing, a_{2k+1} > a_{2k}, so p > q. However, this could complicate things, but perhaps the ratios are integers to make all terms integers easily. Let me assume that r is an integer for now.\n\nSo, from a\u2084 = r\u2082 * a\u2083, and a\u2084 is also equal to (2r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081)a\u2081, which is (2r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081)a\u2081. So:\n\nr\u2082 = (2r\u2081\u00b2 - r\u2081)/r\u2081\u00b2 = 2 - 1/r\u2081\n\nBut for r\u2082 to be rational, since I assumed r\u2081 is integer, 1/r\u2081 must be rational, which it is, but for r\u2082 to be integer, 1/r\u2081 must divide into 2 - something. Wait, but if r\u2081 is an integer greater than 1, 1/r\u2081 would be a fraction. So, unless r\u2081 divides 1, which only holds if r\u2081 is 1, but r\u2081 must be greater than 1 because the sequence is strictly increasing.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Maybe my initial assumption that r\u2081 is integer is wrong. So, r\u2081 could be a rational number. Let me denote r\u2081 = p/q, where p and q are positive integers with p > q and gcd(p,q)=1.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = (p/q) a\u2081, so for a\u2082 to be an integer, a\u2081 must be a multiple of q. Let's denote a\u2081 = q * m, where m is a positive integer. Then, a\u2082 = p * m, and a\u2083 = (p/q) * a\u2082 = (p/q)(p m) = (p\u00b2 / q) m. For a\u2083 to be integer, q must divide p\u00b2 m. Since gcd(p,q)=1, q must divide m. Therefore,"

The arithmetic triplet a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084 must have a common difference. The difference is a\u2083 - a\u2082 = p\u00b2 n - p q n = p n (p - q). Therefore, a\u2084 = a\u2083 + (a\u2083 - a\u2082) = p\u00b2 n + p n (p - q) = p\u00b2 n + p\u00b2 n - p q n = 2 p\u00b2 n - p q n = p n (2 p - q).\n\nNow, moving to the next geometric triplet: a\u2083, a\u2084, a\u2085. Since this is geometric, the ratio r\u2082 must satisfy a\u2084 = r\u2082 a\u2083 and a\u2085 = r\u2082 a\u2084. Let's compute r\u2082:\n\nr\u2082 = a\u2084 / a\u2083 = [p n (2 p - q)] / [p\u00b2 n] = (2 p - q)/p.\n\nSimilarly, a\u2085 = r\u2082 a\u2084 = [(2 p - q)/p] * [p n (2 p - q)] = n (2 p - q)^2.\n\nNow, the next arithmetic triplet is a\u2084, a\u2085, a\u2086. The common difference here is a\u2085 - a\u2084 = n (2 p - q)^2 - p n (2 p - q) = n (2 p - q)[(2 p - q) - p] = n (2 p - q)(p - q).\n\nTherefore, a\u2086 = a\u2085 + (a\u2085 - a\u2084) = 2 a\u2085 - a\u2084 = 2 n (2 p - q)^2 - p n (2 p - q).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a recursive relation or a way to express terms in terms of previous terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern in the terms.
