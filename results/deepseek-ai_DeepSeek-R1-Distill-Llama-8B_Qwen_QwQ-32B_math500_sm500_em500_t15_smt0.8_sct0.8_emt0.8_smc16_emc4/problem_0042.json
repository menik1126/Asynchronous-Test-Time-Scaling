            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number excluding the number itself.\n\nNext, I'll list out all the divisors of 284. To do this, I'll perform prime factorization to break down 284 into its prime components. \n\nI start by checking if 284 is divisible by 2, which it is. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. Continuing the division, 142 divided by 2 is 71. Now, 71 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factors of 284 are 2 squared multiplied by 71.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, if a number's prime factorization is \\( p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\dots \\times p_n^{a_n} \\), the sum of all its divisors is \\( (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{a_1}) \\times \\dots \\times (1 + p_n + p_n^2 + \\dots + p_n^{a_n}) \\). Applying this to 284, the sum of all divisors is \\( (1 + 2 + 4) \\times (1 + 71) = 7 \\times 72 = 504 \\).\n\nSince the sum of all divisors includes the number itself, I subtract 284 from 504 to find the sum of the proper divisors: \\( 504 - 284 = 220 \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. I'll start by finding the prime factors of 220. Dividing 220 by 2 gives 110, then 55, which is 5 times 11. So, 220 is \\( 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11 \\).\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again: \\( (1 + 2 + 4) \\times (1 + 5) \\times (1 + 11) = 7 \\times 6 \\times 12 = 504 \\). Subtracting 220, the sum of its proper divisors is \\( 504 - 220 = 284 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll sum the proper divisors of 284 and 220. That is, \\( "
