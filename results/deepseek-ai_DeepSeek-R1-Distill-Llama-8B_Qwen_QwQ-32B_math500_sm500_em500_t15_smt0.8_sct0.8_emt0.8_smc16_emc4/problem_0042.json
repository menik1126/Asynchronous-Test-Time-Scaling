            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number that are less than the number itself. To do this, I'll start by determining the prime factors of 284.\n\nNext, I'll perform prime factorization on 284. I notice that 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. Since 142 is also even, it can be divided by 2 again, resulting in 71. Now, 71 is a prime number, so the prime factors of 284 are 2, 2, and 71.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \\((p^a + p^{a-1} + \\dots + p + 1)\\) for each prime factor \\(p\\) raised to the power \\(a\\), I'll calculate the sum of divisors for each prime factor:\n\n- For 2\u00b2: \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\)\n- For 71: \\(1 + 71 = 72\\)\n\nMultiplying these results gives the total sum of divisors: \\(7 \\times 72 = 504\\).\n\nFinally, to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284, I subtract 284 from the total sum of divisors: \\(504 - 284 = 220\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of the number 220. I'll start by finding its prime factors. 220 is divisible by 2, giving 110. Dividing 110 by 2 again gives 55, which is divisible by 5 and 11. Therefore, the prime factors of 220 are 2\u00b2, 5, and 11.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula for each prime factor:\n\n- For 2\u00b2: \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\)\n- For 5: \\(1 + 5 = 6\\)\n- For 11: \\(1 + 11 = 12\\)\n\nMultiplying these gives the total sum of divisors: \\(7 \\times 6 \\times 12 = 504\\).\n\nSubtracting 220 from 504 gives the sum of the proper divisors of 220: \\(504 - 220 = 284\\).\n\nFinally, the"
