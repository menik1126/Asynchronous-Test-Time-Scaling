            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nGiven the beaker has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, I'll plug these values into the formula: V = π * (3)² * 8. Calculating this gives V = π * 9 * 8 = 72π cm³.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven the tank has a radius of 6 cm, I'll substitute this into the formula: V = (4/3)π * (6)³. Calculating this gives V = (4/3)π * 216 = 288π cm³.\n\nNow, to find out how many beakers of water are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker: 288π / 72π = 4.\n\nTherefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers of water to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Cylindrical Beaker**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{cylinder}} \\) of a cylinder is:\n\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - \\( r \\) = radius of the cylinder (3 cm)\n   - \\( h \\) = height of the cylinder (8 cm)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) of a sphere is:\n\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3\n   \\]\n\n   Where:\n   - \\("
