Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says P(x) is a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. That means P(x) should look like ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. Cool, so I know the general form.\n\nNext, it gives me inequalities: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for all real x. Hmm, that's interesting. So for every x, P(x) is sandwiched between these two quadratic functions. Also, they told me that P(11) = 181. I need to find P(16).\n\nOkay, so let me try to understand what these inequalities are telling me. Maybe I can express P(x) as a combination of these two functions. Since both are quadratics, and P(x) is also a quadratic, perhaps I can write P(x) as a linear combination of these two.\n\nLet me denote the lower bound as L(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and the upper bound as U(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3. So, the inequality is L(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 U(x) for all x.\n\nIf I think of P(x) as a sum of L(x) and some multiple of a function that lies between 0 and 1, that might work. Since L(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 U(x), then U(x) - L(x) is the difference between the upper and lower bounds. Let me calculate that:\n\nU(x) - L(x) = (2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3) - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1.\n\nWait a minute, x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 factors into (x - 1)\u00b2. So, that's a perfect square. Interesting. So, the difference between U and L is (x - 1)\u00b2, which is always non-negative because any square is non-negative. So, that makes sense because the upper bound is always above the lower bound by at least (x - 1)\u00b2.\n\nNow, how does this help me? Hmm. Maybe"

But since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, and (x - 1)\u00b2 is quadratic, then k(x) must be a constant. Because if k(x) were a function, then multiplying by (x - 1)\u00b2 would give a higher degree unless k(x) is a constant. Since P(x) is quadratic, the coefficient of x\u00b2 in P(x) must be between 1 and 2, right?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me suppose that P(x) can be written as L(x) + t*(x - 1)^2, where t is a constant between 0 and 1. Because then, when t=0, P(x)=L(x), and when t=1, P(x)=U(x). Since the difference between U and L is exactly (x - 1)^2, this makes sense. So, if I set P(x) = L(x) + t*(x - 1)^2, then t must be between 0 and 1 for all x. Wait, but actually, since the inequality must hold for all x, then t must be a constant such that 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1. Because if t were greater than 1, then at some x, P(x) would exceed U(x), and if t were less than 0, it would go below L(x). So, t is a constant between 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) + t*(x - 1)^2, where 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1. Let me check that. Let's expand this expression:\n\nFirst, expand (x - 1)^2: x\u00b2 - 2x + 1.\n\nSo, P(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 + t*(x\u00b2 - 2x + 1)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nThe x\u00b2 terms: (1 + t)x\u00b2\n\nThe x terms: (-2 - 2t)x\n\nThe constants: 2 + t*1 = 2 + t\n\nTherefore, P(x) = (1 + t)x\u00b2 + (-2 - 2t)x + (2 + t)\n\nSo, that's"

Did I make an assumption that P(x)=L(x)+t*(x-1)^2? Could there be another quadratic that satisfies the inequalities and passes through (11,181), but not of this form?\n\nHmm, that is a concern. Maybe I was too quick to write P(x) as L(x) + t*(x-1)^2. Let me think.\n\nI know that for all x, L(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 U(x). So, P(x) - L(x) is non-negative for all x, and U(x) - P(x) is non-negative for all x.\n\nBut the difference U(x) - L(x) is equal to (x -1)^2, which is always non-negative, as we saw. So, perhaps P(x) - L(x) is exactly s*(x -1)^2, where 0 \u2264 s \u2264 1. Because the maximum possible difference is (x -1)^2, so s can't be more than 1, and s must be at least 0.\n\nSo, that approach should be valid because any quadratic between L(x) and U(x) must respect that the difference from L(x) is proportional to (x -1)^2.\n\nThus, my earlier conclusion that P(x) = L(x) + s*(x -1)^2 with s between 0 and1, so my approach is correct.

Let me note that any quadratic polynomial can be written in terms of (x - h)^2 + k, but in this case, since it's between two quadratics, maybe expressing it as L(x) + t*(U(x) - L(x)) is a better idea, where t is between 0 and1.\n\nThat's exactly what I did earlier, so I think that was correct.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the alternative approach is overcomplicating, so I should stick with the first method, which seems to have worked, giving me P(16)=406.\n\nBut just to ensure, let me check if with P(x)=1.8x\u00b2 -3.6x +2.8, whether the inequalities hold.\n\nFirst, L(x)=x\u00b2 -2x +2.\n\nSo, let's compare at x=0: L(0)=0 -0 +2=2, P(0)=1.8*0 + (-3.6)*0 +2.8=2.8.

So, I'm confident that the answer is 406.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{406}\n</think>\n\nGiven a quadratic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) with real coefficients satisfying \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\le P(x) \\le 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\), and knowing that \\( P(11) = 181 \\), we need to find \\( P(16) \\).\n\nFirst, we denote the lower bound as \\( L(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) and the upper bound as \\( U(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\). The difference between these bounds is \\( U(x) - L(x) = (x - 1)^2 \\), which is non-negative for all \\( x \\).\n\nWe express \\( P(x) \\) as \\( L(x) + t(x - 1)^2 \\) where \\( t \\) is a constant between 0 and 1. Expanding this, we get:\n\\[ P(x) = (x^2 - 2x + 2) + t(x^2 - 2x + 1) \\]\n\\[ P(x) = (1 + t)x^2 + (-2 - 2t)x + (2 + t) \\]\n\nGiven \\( P(11) = 181 \\), we substitute \\( x = 11 \\) into the polynomial:\n\\[ 121(1 + t) + (-22)(1 + t) + (2 + t) = 181 \\]\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[ 101 + 100t = 181 \\]\n\\[ 100t = 80 \\]\n\\[ t = 0.8 \\]\n\nThus, the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is"
