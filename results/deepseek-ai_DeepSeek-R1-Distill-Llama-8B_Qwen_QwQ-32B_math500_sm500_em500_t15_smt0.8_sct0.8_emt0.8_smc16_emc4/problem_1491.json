I'll list them out and ensure each is a prime number by checking if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nNext, I'll consider the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. This includes numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on.\n\nNow, I'll find the intersection of these two sets by checking which prime numbers are also odd and greater than zero. Since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, the intersection will consist of all prime numbers less than 30.\n\nFinally, I'll count the number of these primes to determine the size of the intersection.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the set of prime numbers less than 30**:\n   \n   The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}\n   \\]\n   \n   There are **10** prime numbers in this set.\n\n2. **Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than zero**:\n   \n   The set of all odd numbers greater than zero is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, \\dots\\}\n   \\]\n   \n   This is an infinite set, but we are only interested in the elements that are also prime and less than 30.\n\n3. **Find the intersection of the two sets**:\n   \n   The intersection consists of all numbers that are both prime and odd and less than 30. From the list of prime numbers less than 30, exclude the only even prime, which is **2**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\{3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}\n   \\]\n   \n   There are **9** elements in this intersection.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
