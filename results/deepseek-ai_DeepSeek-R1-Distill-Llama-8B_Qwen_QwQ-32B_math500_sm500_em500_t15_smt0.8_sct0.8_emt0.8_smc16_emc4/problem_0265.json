            "output": "First, I'll identify the given exchange rates between the money denominations in the land of Ink.\n\nI know that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets. This means that each Blinket is worth 1/4 of a Trinket.\n\nAdditionally, 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. To find out how much 1 Blinket is worth in Drinkets, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 3. This gives me 1 Blinket = 7/3 Drinkets.\n\nNow, I'll find out how many Trinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets. Since 1 Blinket equals 7/3 Drinkets, I can determine that 56 Drinkets equal 56 multiplied by 3/7 Blinkets. This calculation gives me 24 Blinkets.\n\nFinally, since 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, I'll convert 24 Blinkets into Trinkets by dividing by 4. This means 24 Blinkets equal 6 Trinkets.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are worth 6 Trinkets in the land of Ink.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, let's follow the exchange rates step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- 1 Trinket (T) = 4 Blinkets (B)\n- 3 Blinkets (B) = 7 Drinkets (D)\n\n**Step 1: Find the relationship between Blinkets and Drinkets.**\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[ 3\\,B = 7\\,D \\]\nTo find how many Blinkets are in 1 Drinket:\n\\[ 1\\,D = \\frac{3\\,B}{7} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert Drinkets to Blinkets.**\nWe need to find the value of 56 Drinkets in Blinkets:\n\\[ 56\\,D = 56 \\times \\frac{3\\,B}{7} \\]\n\\[ 56\\,D = 24\\,B \\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert Blinkets to Trinkets.**\nFrom the first equation:\n\\[ 1\\,T = 4\\,B \\]\nTo find how many Trinkets are in 24 Blinkets:\n\\[ 24\\,B = \\frac{24\\,B}{4\\,T} \\]\n\\[ 24\\"
