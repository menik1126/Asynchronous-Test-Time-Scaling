            "output": "To determine which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the female bus riders, I'll start by identifying the given data.\n\nFor each grade, I'll calculate the percentage difference between males and females. This is done by finding the percentage of males relative to females, or vice versa, whichever is closer to 135%.\n\nI'll begin with the 9th grade. Male bus riders are 41.1%, and female bus riders are 39.4%. To see how male riders relate to female riders, I'll calculate 41.1 divided by 39.4, which is approximately 1.042 or 4.2%. This means males are about 4.2% higher than females. Since 135% is significantly higher, the 9th grade doesn't meet the criteria.\n\nNext, I'll consider the 10th grade where males are 34.4% and females are 33.1%. Calculating 34.4 divided by 33.1 gives roughly 1.038 or 3.8%. Again, this percentage is below the required 135%, so the 10th grade also doesn't qualify.\n\nMoving on to the 11th grade, males are 20.6% and females are 13.8%. Dividing 20.6 by 13.8 results in approximately 1.484 or 48.4%. This is still below the target 135%, so the 11th grade doesn't meet the criteria.\n\nFinally, I'll analyze the 12th grade with males at 11.6% and females at 8.6%. Dividing 11.6 by 8.6 yields about 1.348 or 34.8%. This is also below 135%, so none of the grades have the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the female bus riders based on the given data.\n\n\\boxed{ }\\n\\n\nWait, the instructions say to separate my reasoning steps with two newline characters and put the final answer within a box. But in my initial thought process, I concluded that none of the grades meet the 135% criteria. However, let me re-examine the calculations to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nRechecking the 9th grade: 41.1 / 39.4 ≈ 1.042 or 4.2%\n\n10th grade: 34.4 /"

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question. The question asks for the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the actual numbers instead of percentages. Since there are 300 males and 300 females surveyed in each grade, the actual number of riders can be calculated by multiplying the percentage by 300. \n\nLet me recalculate using actual numbers.\n\nFor each grade:\n\n9th grade:\nMale riders: 41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300 = 123.3\nFemale riders: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300 = 118.2\nCompute 123.3 / (118.2 * 1.35) to see if it's close to 1? Or perhaps compute 135% of female riders and see how close it is to male riders.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the number of male riders closest to 135% of the number of female riders. So, for each grade, compute 135% of female riders and see how close that is to the actual male riders.\n\nAlternatively, compute (Male riders) / (135% of Female riders) and see which is closest to 1.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n\nFemale riders: 118.2\n135% of female riders: 1.35 * 118.2 ≈ 159.57\nMale riders: 123.3\nDifference: |123.3 - 159.57| ≈ 36.27\n\nAlternatively, compute the ratio (Male)/(1.35*Female).
