            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about Central H.S. students' bus ridership percentages by grade and gender. The question is asking for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders. Hmm, let me figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the data. The table shows four grades: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. For each grade, it lists the percentage of males and females who are bus riders. The survey included 300 males and 300 females in each grade, so that's 600 students per grade. Wait, no, hold on. The problem says 300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed. So that means for each grade, there are 600 students total. But the percentages given are for each gender. So, for each grade, we can calculate the actual number of male and female bus riders by taking 300 times the percentage.\n\nLet me write this down. For each grade, the number of male bus riders is 300 multiplied by the male percentage, and similarly for female. So, for example, in 9th grade, males are 41.1%, so 300 * 41.1% is the number of male bus riders. Same for females.\n\nBut since the question is about the ratio of male to female bus riders, specifically when male is 135% of female, I need to find the grade where this ratio is closest. So, for each grade, I should calculate the male bus riders and female bus riders, then see if male is 135% of female.\n\nLet me try to compute this for each grade.\n\nStarting with 9th grade.\n\nGrade 9:\n- Male bus riders: 300 * 41.1% = 300 * 0.411 = 123.3\n- Female bus riders: 300 * 39.4% = 300 * 0.394 = 118.2\nSo, ratio of male to female is 123.3 / 118.2 \u2248 1.04, which is about 104%. We need 135%, so this is not close yet, but let's keep going.\n\nGrade 10:\n- Male: 300 * 34.4 = 300 * 0.344 = 103.2\n- Female: 300 * 33.1 = 300"

            "output": " *0.331 = 99.3\nRatio: 103.2 / 99.3 \u2248 1.039 or 103.9%, so even closer to 100%, but still not near 135%.\n\nHmm, getting lower percentages here. Let me check grade 11.\n\nGrade 11:\n- Male: 20.6% of 300 = 20.6/100 * 300. Let's see, 20% of 300 is 60, 0.6% is 1.8, so total 61.8\n- Female: 13.8% of 300. 10% is 30, 3.8% is 11.4, total 41.4\nSo ratio male/female is 61.8 /41.4 \u2248 1.493. That's approximately 149.3%. Hmm, that's closer to 150% which is still above 135%. \n\nGrade 12:\n- Male: 11.6% of 300. So 10% is 30, 1.6% is 4.8, total 34.8\n- Female: 8.6% of 300. 8% is 24, 0.6% is 1.8, total 25.8\nRatio: 34.8 /25.8 \u2248 1.348, so that's about 134.8%. Oh, that's really close to 135%!\n\nWait, hold on, so grade 12's ratio is approximately 134.8%, which is just 0.2% less than 135%. Grade 11 was 149.3%. That's 14.3% over. Then grade 10 and 9th are even lower. Let me confirm:\n\nWait, for grade 11: 61.8 male and 41.4 female. 41.4 *1.35 would be 41.4 + (41.4"

            "output": " *0.35)= 41.4 +14.49=55.89. But male is 61.8, so 61.8 vs 55.89. The difference is about 5.91, which is significant. Whereas in grade 12, the 134.8 is very close to 135. So 134.8 is within 0.2% of 135. \n\nWait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes I can make a mistake.\n\nGrade 12 calculations:\nMale: 11.6% of 300 is 0.116 * 300 = 34.8\nFemale: 8.6% of 300 is 0.086 * 300 = 25.8\nSo male/female ratio is 34.8 /25.8\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 17.4 /12.9 \u2248 1.348\n\nYes, that's correct. And 1.348 *25.8 = 34.8. So it's exactly 134.8% of female bus riders. So that's just 0.2% less than 135%. \n\nIn grade 11, it's 1.493 times, which is 149.3%. So the difference between the two is significant. \n\nSo the closest is grade 12, with 134.8% which is almost 135%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the absolute difference or the percentage difference.\n\nWait, the question is about the number of male bus riders being closest to 135% of female. So for each grade, compute (male bus riders -1.35* female bus riders), but actually, we can compute the ratio and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the absolute difference between the ratio and 1.35.\n\nSo for each grade:\n\nGrade 9: ratio\u22481.0417, |1.0417 -1.35|=0.3083\n\nGrade10:\u22481.039, |1.039-1.35|=0.311\n\nGrade11:\u22481.493, |1.493-1.35|=0.143\n\nGrade12:\u22481.348, |1.348-1.35|=0.002\n\nSo the smallest absolute difference is in grade12, only 0.002, which is extremely"

The difference between 1.493 and 1.35 is 0.143, which is bigger than grade12's 0.002. So yes, grade12 is the closest. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculation for grade12 again. 34.8 divided by 25.8. Let me do that division more precisely. \n\n34.8 divided by 25.8. Let's see:\n\n25.8 *1.3 = 25.8 + 25.8*0.3 = 25.8 +7.74=33.54\n\n25.8 *1.34 = 25.8*(1.3 +0.04)=33.54 +1.032=34.572\n\n25.8 *1.348 = 25.8*(1.34 +0.008)=34.572 + (25.8*0.008)=34.572 +0.2064=34.7784\n\nWhich is very close to 34.8. So 1.348 gives 34.7784, which is just 0.0216 less than 34.8. So the exact ratio is 34.8 /25.8 = (34.8 /25.8). Let me compute that as a decimal:\n\n34.8 divided by 25.8. Let me write it as 348 divided by 258. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 348/6=58, 258/6=43. So 58/43 \u22481.3488. So approximately 1.3488, which is 134.88%, so the difference from 135% is 0.12%. Wait, 135% is 1.35, so 1."
