            "output": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem with logarithms, and I need to find x. Hmm, the equations are:\n\nFirst one: log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2.\n\nSecond one: log base y of 5x equals 2.\n\nAlright, so I need to find x. Hmm, okay, let's start with the first equation. Since both logs are base 6, maybe I can combine them somehow. I remember that log(a) + log(b) is equal to log(ab). So, applying that here, I can write:\n\nlog₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nMultiplying (x - y) and (x + y) gives x² - y², right? So, it becomes:\n\nlog₆(x² - y²) = 2.\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that if log_b(z) = c, then z = b^c. So, applying that here:\n\nx² - y² = 6² = 36.\n\nSo, equation one simplifies to x² - y² = 36. Got that.\n\nNow, onto the second equation: log base y of 5x equals 2. Again, I can convert this logarithmic equation to exponential form. So, log_y(5x) = 2 implies that y² = 5x.\n\nSo, from the second equation, I have y² = 5x. Hmm, okay. That gives me a relationship between y and x. So, maybe I can express y in terms of x and substitute into the first equation.\n\nSo, y² = 5x implies that y = sqrt(5x). Wait, but I'm dealing with equations that have y² and x². Maybe it's better to write y in terms of x and substitute accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express x in terms of y. From y² = 5x, so x = y² / 5.\n\nAlright, so x is y squared over 5. Then, I can substitute this into the first equation, which is x² - y² = 36.\n\nSo, substituting x = y² / 5 into x² - y²:\n\n(y² / 5)² - y² = "

            "output": "36.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, (y² / 5)^2 is y⁴ / 25. Then subtract y², so:\n\ny⁴ / 25 - y² = 36.\n\nHmm, that's a quartic equation, but maybe I can make a substitution to make it a quadratic equation. Let me let z = y². Then, the equation becomes:\n\n(z²)/25 - z = 36.\n\nMultiply both sides by 25 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nz² - 25z = 900.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nz² - 25z - 900 = 0.\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of z. Let's try to solve for z using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is z² -25z -900 =0, so a=1, b=-25, c=-900.\n\nThe quadratic formula is z = [25 ± sqrt( (-25)^2 -4*1*(-900) )]/(2*1).\n\nCalculating discriminant:\n\n(-25)^2 = 625,\n\n4*1*(-900) = -3600,\n\nSo discriminant is 625 - (4*1*(-900))? Wait, no, wait. Wait, discriminant is b² -4ac. So here, b is -25, so b squared is 625, and 4ac is 4*1*(-900) = -3600. Wait, but discriminant is 625 - (4ac) which is 625 - ( -3600 )? Wait, no, no, 4ac is 4*1*(-900) = -3600, so discriminant is 625 - (4ac) would be 625 - (-3600) = 625 + 3600 = 4225.\n\nAh, okay, so sqrt(4225). Hmm, sqrt(4225). Let me think. 65 squared is 4225, because 60² is 3600, 65² is 422"

            "output": "5. So, sqrt(4225) = 65.\n\nSo, z = [25 ±65]/2.\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\nFirst solution: (25 + 65)/2 = 90/2 = 45.\n\nSecond solution: (25 -65)/2 = (-40)/2= -20.\n\nBut z = y². Since y² can't be negative, because square of real number is non-negative, so z can't be -20. Therefore, z=45.\n\nSo, z=45, which means y²=45. Therefore, y= sqrt(45). sqrt(45) can be simplified as 3*sqrt(5). So, y= 3√5.\n\nBut we can also consider that y is positive, because logarithm base must be positive and not equal to 1. So, y>0, so y=3√5.\n\nNow, from earlier, we had x= y² /5. Since y² is 45, x=45/5=9.\n\nSo, x=9.\n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense. Let's verify both equations with x=9 and y=3√5.\n\nFirst equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2.\n\nCompute x - y = 9 - 3√5, and x + y =9 + 3√5.\n\nThen, log₆(9 - 3√5) + log₆(9 + 3√5) = log₆[(9 -3√5)(9 +3√5)] = log₆(81 - (3√5)^2) = log₆(81 - 9*5)= log₆(81 -45)=log₆(36).\n\nSince 6²=36, log₆(36)=2. Which matches the first equation. Good.\n\nSecond equation: log base y of 5x equals 2. So, log_y(5x)=2 implies y²=5x.\n\n5x=5*9=45, and y²= (3√5)^2=9*5=45. So yes, y²=45=5x. So, that works too.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 9.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we combine the logarithms in the first equation:\n\nlog₆[(x"
