At the y-axis, the value of \\( x \\) is 0. So, to find the y-intercepts, I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nSetting \\( x = 0 \\):\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). To find the number of real solutions (which correspond to the y-intercepts), I'll calculate the discriminant (\\( D \\)) of the quadratic equation using the formula \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\[\nD = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (\\( D = 20 > 0 \\)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.
