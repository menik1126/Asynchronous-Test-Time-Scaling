            "output": "To determine the total number of possible license plates, I need to consider the structure of the license plate.\n\nFirst, there are 26 different letters in the English alphabet, and each of the two letter positions can be any letter from A to Z. Since the letters must be different, for the first letter, there are 26 possible choices, and for the second letter, there are 25 remaining choices.\n\nNext, there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9) for each of the two number positions. Similar to the letters, the digits must also be different. This means that for the first number, there are 10 possible choices, and for the second number, there are 9 remaining choices.\n\nTo find the total number of unique license plates, I multiply the number of possibilities for each position together. This is because each choice is independent of the others.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n26 letters for the first position multiplied by 25 letters for the second position, which equals 650 possible combinations for the letters. Then, multiplying that by 10 digits for the first number position and 9 digits for the second position gives:\n650 * 10 * 9 = 58,500.\n\nTherefore, there are 58,500 possible license plates that meet the given criteria.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure:**\n   - Each license plate has **2 different letters** (A-Z) followed by **2 different digits** (0-9).\n   \n2. **Calculating the Number of Choices for Letters:**\n   - **First Letter:** There are **26** possible letters (A-Z).\n   - **Second Letter:** Since it must be different from the first, there are **25** remaining choices.\n   \n   **Total combinations for letters:** \\( 26 \\times 25 = 650 \\)\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Choices for Digits:**\n   - **First Digit:** There are **10** possible digits (0-9).\n   - **Second Digit:** Since it must be different from the first, there are **9** remaining choices.\n   \n   **Total combinations for digits:** \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\)\n\n4. **Combining the Choices:**\n   - The total number of license plates is the product of the letter combinations and the digit combinations.\n   \n   **Total"
