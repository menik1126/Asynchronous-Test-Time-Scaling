            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 - 5x - 14), and then add them up: a + b + c, where a and b are the x-values of the vertical asymptotes and c is the y-value of the horizontal asymptote.\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero and the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I should factor the denominator to find those x-values.\n\nThe denominator is x\u00b2 - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring that. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Let me see:  -7 and 2. Because -7 * 2 = -14, and -7 + 2 = -5. Yes, that works. So, the denominator factors as (x - 7)(x + 2).\n\nSo, the denominator is zero when x - 7 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, which means x = 7 and x = -2. So, the vertical asymptotes are at x = 7 and x = -2. Therefore, a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nNext, horizontal asymptotes. The function is a rational function where the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator. So, if the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nIn the numerator, the leading term is 2x, which is degree 1. In the denominator, the leading term is x\u00b2, which is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. But if the degrees are equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients. In this case, degrees are different, so yes, y=0. So, c=0.\n\nNow, a + b + c is (-2) + 7 + 0. So, that equals 5.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in factoring the denominator. x\u00b2 - 5x - 14. Let"

            "output": "'s check (x - 7)(x + 2). Multiplying out: x*x = x\u00b2, x*2 = 2x, -7*x = -7x, and -7*2 = -14. So combining the middle terms: 2x -7x = -5x. Yes, that's correct. So the roots are indeed 7 and -2.\n\nHorizontal asymptote: numerator degree is 1, denominator is 2. Since numerator degree is less than denominator, horizontal asymptote is y=0. So c is 0. So adding them up: -2 +7 is 5, plus 0 is 5. So the answer should be 5. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. Wait, sometimes people get confused between horizontal and oblique asymptotes. Since the numerator is degree 1 and denominator is 2, the difference is more than one, so there's no oblique asymptote. The horizontal asymptote is indeed y=0. Yeah, that's right. So I think that's correct.\n\nSo, final answer is 5. So, a + b + c = 5. So, boxed answer is \\boxed{5}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), we need to determine where the denominator is zero. Factoring the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the vertical asymptotes at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Thus, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\nNext, to find the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator has degree 1, and the denominator has degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nAdding these values together:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
