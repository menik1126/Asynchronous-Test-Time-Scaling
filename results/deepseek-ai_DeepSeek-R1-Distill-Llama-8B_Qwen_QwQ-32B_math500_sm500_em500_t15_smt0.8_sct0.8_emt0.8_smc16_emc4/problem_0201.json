            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, how do I approach this? I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem, which says that any possible rational root, when written in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nIn this equation, the leading coefficient is 1 because the \\(x^4\\) term has a coefficient of 1, and the constant term is -14. So, that means any rational root must be a factor of -14. The factors of -14 are \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), and \\(\\pm14\\). Since we're looking for integer roots specifically, I can test these values one by one.\n\nLet me start with \\(x=1\\). Plugging it into the equation: \\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\). Calculating that: 1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14. Adding up the positives: 1+5=6, 6+9=15; negatives: -1-14=-15. So 15 -15 = 0. Okay, so x=1 is a root.\n\nNow, since x=1 is a root, I can factor out (x-1) from the polynomial. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to find the other factors. Maybe synthetic division is faster.\n\nSetting up synthetic division with root 1:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 1: 1, add to next coefficient: 5+1=6.\n\nMultiply 6 by 1: 6, add to next coefficient: 9+6=15.\n\nMultiply 15 by 1:15, add to next coefficient: -1 +15=14.\n\nMultiply 14 by1:14, add to last coefficient: -14 +14=0. Perfect, so the result is \\(x"

            "output": "^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\).\n\nNow, I have to factor \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\). Let's try another integer root. Let's test x=-1 first because it's often a common root.\n\nPlugging x=-1: (-1)^3 +6(-1)^2 +15(-1) +14. Calculating: -1 +6 -15 +14. Adding them up: (-1 +6)=5, (5 -15)= -10, (-10 +14)=4. So, not zero.\n\nHow about x=2? Let's see: 8 + 24 +30 +14. Wait, that's way too big. 8+24=32, 32+30=62, 62+14=76. Definitely not zero.\n\nx=-2: (-8) +6*(4) +15*(-2) +14. So: -8 +24 -30 +14. Calculating: (-8+24)=16, (16-30)= -14, (-14 +14)=0. Oh, so x=-2 is a root.\n\nGreat, so now I can factor out (x + 2) from the cubic polynomial. Let's use synthetic division again with root -2.\n\nThe coefficients now are 1,6,15,14.\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2. Add to 6: 6-2=4.\n\nMultiply 4 by -2: -8. Add to 15: 15-8=7.\n\nMultiply 7 by -2: -14. Add to 14: 14-14=0. Perfect, so the result is \\(x^2 +4x +7\\).\n\nNow, I have a quadratic left: \\(x^2 +4x +7\\). Let's check if this quadratic has any integer roots. The possible roots should be factors of 7, so \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm7\\).\n\nTesting x=1: 1 +4 +7=12\u22600.\n\nx=-1: 1 -4 +7=4\u22600.\n\nx=7: 49 +28 +7=84\u22600.\n\nx=-7: 49 -28 +7=28\u22600.\n\nSo, neither of these are roots.
