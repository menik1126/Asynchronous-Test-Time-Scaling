Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Bill walks half a mile south. South is downward on a map, so that means he's decreasing his latitude. If I imagine a coordinate system where he starts at a point (let's say (0,0)), walking south would decrease his y-coordinate. So after walking 1/2 mile south, his position would be (0, -1/2).\n\nNext, he walks 3/4 mile east. East is to the right on a map, which increases the x-coordinate. So from his current position (0, -1/2), he moves 3/4 mile east. That would bring him to (3/4, -1/2).\n\nThen, he walks another half a mile south. Again, this decreases his y-coordinate. So from (3/4, -1/2), walking 1/2 mile south would place him at (3/4, -1/2 - 1/2) which is (3/4, -1).\n\nNow, I need to find the straight-line distance from his starting point (0,0) to his final position (3/4, -1). To do that, I can use the distance formula from coordinate geometry.\n\nThe distance formula is the square root of [(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Plugging in the coordinates, that's sqrt[(3/4 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2].\n\nCalculating each part:\n- (3/4)^2 = 9/16\n- (-1)^2 = 1\n\nAdding those together: 9/16 + 1 = 9/16 + 16/16 = 25/16\n\nTaking the square root of 25/16 gives 5/4, which is 1.25.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So 3/4 squared is indeed 9/16, and (-1) squared is 1, which is 16/16. Adding 9/16 and 16/16 gives 25/16. The square root of 25/16 is 5/4, which is exactly 1.25. So Bill is 1.25 miles directly north of his starting point"

            "output": ".\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the coordinate system. If he starts at (0,0), walks south, which is negative y-direction, then east (positive x), then south again. So his final position is at (3/4, -1). The distance calculation is correct because it's the straight line between (0,0) and (3/4, -1). Yep, that's 5/4 or 1.25 miles.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me visualize it. So, he went 1/2 mile south, then 3/4 mile east, then another 1/2 mile south. So in total, he's 1 mile south and 3/4 mile east. So the straight line distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 1 and 3/4.\n\nCalculating that hypotenuse: sqrt(1^2 + (3/4)^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.5625) = sqrt(1.5625). Wait a minute, sqrt(1.5625) is 1.25 because 1.25 squared is 1.5625. So that's consistent with what I got earlier. So my answer is 1.25 miles.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap:\n\n- South 1/2 mile: y = -1/2\n- East 3/4 mile: x = 3/4\n- South another 1/2 mile: y = -1\n\nDistance from (0,0): sqrt((3/4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(9/16 + 16/16) = sqrt(25/16) = 5/4 = 1.25\n\nYes, that all adds up. So the answer should be 1.25 miles.\n</think>\n\nBill starts at the origin (0,0). He walks 1/2 mile south to (0, -1/2), then 3/4 mile east to (3/4, -1/2), and finally another 1/2 mile south to (3/4, -1). Using the distance formula, the straight-line distance from his starting point is:\n\n√[(3/4)² + (-1)²] = √(9/16 + 16/16) = √(25"
