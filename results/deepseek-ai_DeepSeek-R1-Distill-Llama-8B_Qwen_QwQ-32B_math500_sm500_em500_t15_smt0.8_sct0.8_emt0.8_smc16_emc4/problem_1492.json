The prime numbers in this range are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I will determine the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. These numbers start from 1 and include all odd integers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29.\n\nNow, I'll find the intersection of these two sets. The intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd. From the list of primes less than 30, the odd primes are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nFinally, I'll count the number of elements in the intersection. There are 9 odd prime numbers less than 30.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many elements are in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prime Numbers Less Than 30:**\n   \n   The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n   \\[\n   2,\\, 3,\\, 5,\\, 7,\\, 11,\\, 13,\\, 17,\\, 19,\\, 23,\\, 29\n   \\]\n   *Note:* 2 is the only even prime number.\n\n2. **Identify the Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero:**\n   \n   The set of all odd numbers greater than zero includes:\n   \\[\n   1,\\, 3,\\, 5,\\, 7,\\, 9,\\, 11,\\, 13,\\, 15,\\, 17,\\, 19,\\, 21,\\, 23,\\, 25,\\, 27,\\, 29\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the Intersection of the Two Sets:**\n   \n   The intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd. From the list of primes less than 30, exclude the even prime number 2:\n   \\[\n   3,\\, 5,\\, 7,\\, 11,\\, 13,\\, "
