            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, I remember from school that there's something called the Rational Root Theorem which can help identify possible rational roots of a polynomial equation. Maybe I can use that here.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the Rational Root Theorem states. It says that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the leading coefficient is 1 (since the \\(x^4\\) term has a coefficient of 1), and the constant term is -14. So, the possible rational roots would be the factors of -14 divided by the factors of 1. Which simplifies to just all the factors of -14.\n\nLet me list out the factors of 14. The positive factors are 1, 2, 7, 14, and the negative factors would be -1, -2, -7, -14. So, the possible integer roots are 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14. That gives me a list of eight possible numbers to test.\n\nNow, I need to plug each of these values into the equation and see if they satisfy the equation, meaning the left side equals zero. I'll start testing them one by one.\n\nFirst, let's try \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1 + 5) + (9 - 1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0\\). Oh, that works! So, \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n\nNext, \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 -14\\). Let me compute step by step: 1 -5 = -4, -4 +9"

Adding them up: 16+40=56, 56+36=92, 92-2=90, 90-14=76. Not zero.\n\nHow about \\(x = -2\\):\n\\((-2)^4 +5(-2)^3 +9(-2)^2 - (-2) -14\\). Let's compute each term: 16 +5*(-8) +9*4 +2 -14. That is 16 -40 +36 +2 -14. Adding up: 16-40=-24, -24+36=12, 12+2=14, 14-14=0. Oh, that works! So, \\(x = -2\\) is another root.\n\nMoving on to \\(x = 7\\):\n\\(7^4 +5(7)^3 +9(7)^2 -7 -14\\). Let's calculate each term: 2401 +5*343 +9*49 -7 -14. 2401 is 7^4. 5*343 is 1715, and 9*49 is 441. So adding them up: 2401 +1715=4116, 4116 +441=4557. Then subtract 7 and 14: 4557 -21=4536. Definitely not zero.\n\nNext, \\(x = -7\\):\n\\((-7)^4 +5(-7)^3 +9(-7)^2 - (-7) -14\\). Compute each term: 2401 +5*(-343) +9*49 +7 -14. So, 2401 - 1715 +441 +7 -14. Let's add stepwise: 2401 -1715=686, 686 +441=1127, 1127 +7=1134, 1134 -14=1120. Not zero.\n\nNow, testing \\(x =14\\):\n\\(14^4 +"

            "output": "5(14)^3 +9(14)^2 -14 -14\\). That's going to be a huge number. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n14^4: 14 squared is 196, squared again is 38416. 5*14^3: 14 cubed is 2744, times 5 is 13720. 9*14^2: 196*9=1764. So the equation becomes:\n\n38416 +13720 +1764 -14 -14.\n\nAdding those: 38416 +13720 =52136, 52136 +1764=53900, then subtract 14 and another 14: 53900 -28=53872. Definitely not zero.\n\nFinally, \\(x = -14\\):\n\\((-14)^4 +5*(-14)^3 +9*(-14)^2 - (-14) -14\\). Compute each term: 14^4 is 38416, 5*(-14)^3 is 5*(-2744)= -13720, 9*(-14)^2 is 9*196=1764. So:\n\n38416 -13720 +1764 +14 -14.\n\nCompute: 38416 -13720=24696, 24696 +1764=26460, 26460 +14=26474, and then -14: 26474 -14=26460. Not zero.\n\nSo, from the list, only \\(x =1\\) and \\(x = -2\\) are roots of the equation. Therefore, these are the integer roots.\n\nWait, hold on. The polynomial is of degree 4, so there should be four roots, right? But maybe some of them are non-real or irrational. But since we're only asked for integer roots, so only 1 and -2. But let me double-check if maybe I made a mistake in testing some values.\n\nLet me recheck \\(x = 7\\). 7^4 is 2401, 5*7^3 is 5*343=1715, 9*7^2=9*49=441. So, 2401 +1715 is 4116, plus 441 is 4557. Then, minus 7 and 14 is 4557 -21=4536. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for \\(x = -7\\): (-"

So, just two integer roots:1 and -2.\n\nBut wait, sometimes, after factoring, you can find other roots. So, maybe I can factor the polynomial using the roots I found and see if there are more roots.\n\nSince \\(x =1\\) is a root, let me perform polynomial division to factor out (x -1). Alternatively, I can use synthetic division.\n\nLet me set up synthetic division with root 1.\n\nThe coefficients are: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1*1=1, add to next coefficient: 5 +1=6.\n\nMultiply 6*1=6, add to next coefficient:9 +6=15.\n\nMultiply 15*1=15, add to next coefficient: -1 +15=14.\n\nMultiply 14*1=14, add to next coefficient: -14 +14=0.\n\nSo, after division, the polynomial is (x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic polynomial: x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14.\n\nAgain, using Rational Root Theorem on this cubic.

Oh, x=-2 is a root here as well.\n\nSo, we can factor out (x +2) from the cubic.\n\nUsing synthetic division on x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14, with root -2.\n\nSet up: coefficients 1,6,15,14.\n\nBring down the 1.\n\n"

Let's check its discriminant: \\(b^2 -4ac =16 -28 = -12\\). Since the discriminant is negative, this quadratic has no real roots, only complex ones. Thus, the only real integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miss any other integer roots. Because sometimes, even if your initial test doesn't find any, maybe you missed a possible factor.\n\nBut in the first place, we tested all possible factors of the constant term, which are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114. So all possibilities have been covered. So, that should be it.\n\nTherefore, the integer roots of the equation are 1 and -2.\n</think>\n\nThe integer roots are found by testing possible candidates from the Rational Root Theorem and confirming which satisfy the equation.
