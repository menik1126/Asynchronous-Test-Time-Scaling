Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think if I take it step by step, it'll make more sense.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression clearly so I don't lose track:\n\n√[(5/√80 + √845/9 + √45) / √5]\n\nI think the strategy here is to simplify each square root in the numerator and the denominator first, and then combine everything step by step. Let's start with simplifying each square root term individually.\n\nStarting with √80. I know that 80 can be broken down into 16 times 5 because 16*5 is 80. So, √80 = √(16*5). Since √16 is 4, that becomes 4√5. So, 5 divided by √80 is the same as 5 divided by 4√5. That can be written as 5/(4√5).\n\nNext, let's simplify √845. Hmm, 845 is a bit trickier. Let me see if I can break it down. 845 divided by 5 is 169, right? Because 5*169 is 845. So, √845 = √(5*169). And since √169 is 13, that becomes 13√5. So, √845 over 9 is 13√5/9.\n\nThen, the last term in the numerator is √45. Again, 45 is 9 times 5, so √45 = √(9*5) = 3√5.\n\nSo, putting it all back together, the numerator inside the square root becomes:\n\n5/(4√5) + 13√5/9 + 3√5\n\nHmm, now I have three terms: 5/(4√5), 13√5/9, and 3√5. I need to combine these. But to add them together, they should have the same denominator or be like terms. Let's see if I can express all terms with a common denominator or rationalize the denominator.\n\nStarting with 5/(4√5). I remember that to rationalize a denominator with a square root, I multiply numerator and denominator by √5. So, 5/(4√5) becomes ("

Okay, so that term simplifies to √5/4.\n\nThe other terms are already in terms of √5, so that's good. So now the numerator inside the big square root is:\n\n√5/4 + 13√5/9 + 3√5\n\nNow, let's combine these terms. To add them, they need a common denominator. Let's see, the denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3√5 is the same as 3√5/1). The least common denominator (LCD) of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Let me convert each term to have 36 as the denominator.\n\nFirst term: √5/4. Multiply numerator and denominator by 9 to get (9√5)/36.\n\nSecond term: 13√5/9. Multiply numerator and denominator by 4 to get (52√5)/36.\n\nThird term: 3√5. Multiply numerator and denominator by 36? Wait, actually, 3√5 is the same as (3√5 * 36)/36, but that might complicate. Wait, let me think again. To express 3√5 over 1 as something over 36, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 36. Wait, but that would be 3√5 * 36 / 36. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can write 3√5 as (3√5)*(36/36) but that's the same. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of 3√5 as (3√5)*(36)/36, but that's overcomplicating. Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, 3√5 is equal to (3√5)*(36/36) but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can write 3√5 as (3√5)*(36)/36, but that's the same as 108√5/36?

Hmm, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, actually, since 3√5 is the same as 3√5 * (36/36), but that would be 108√5/36. Wait, that's not correct because 3√5 * 12 is 36√5, so 3√5 is 36√5/12, but that's not over 36. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, let me convert each term to have denominator 36:\n\n√5/4 = (√5 * 9)/36 = 9√5/36\n\n13√5/9 = (13√5 * 4)/36 = 52√5/36\n\n3√5 = 3√5*(36/36) = 108√5/36.

So all terms can be expressed over 36.\n\nSo combining them:\n\n9√5/36 + 52√5/36 + 108√5/36\n\nNow, add the numerators:\n\n9√5 + 52√5 + 108√5 = (9 + 52 + 108)√5 = 169√5.\n\nSo the numerator inside the square root becomes 169√5/36.\n\nSo now, the entire expression is the square root of (169√5/36) divided by √5.\n\nSo, let me write that:\n\n√[(169√5/36) / √5]\n\nDividing by √5 is the same as multiplying by 1/√5, so:\n\n√[(169√5/36) * (1/√5)]\n\nNow, let's simplify inside the square root.\n\n169√5 divided by 36√5.

So the expression simplifies to √(169/36).\n\nTherefore, the square root of 169 over 36 is √169 divided by √36, which is 13/6.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the numerator inside the big square root:\n\nOriginal terms after simplifying each radical:\n\n√5/4 + 13√5/9 + 3√5.\n\nThen converting to common denominator 36:\n\n√5/4 = 9√5/36,\n\n13√5/9 = 52√5/36,\n\n3√5 = 108√5/36.\n\nAdding them gives 9 + 52 + 108 = 169, so 169√5/36.

So sqrt(169/36) is 13/6.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the radicals.\n\nFirst, √80: 80 is 16*5, so √80=4√5. So 5/√80 = 5/(4√5) = (5√5)/(4*5) = √5/4. That's correct.\n\nThen, √845: 845 divided by 5 is 169, so 5*169. √(5*169)=√5*√169=13√5. So √845=13√5. So √845/9=13√5/9. Correct.\n\nThen, √45=√(9*5)=3√5. Correct.\n\nSo numerator inside the big square root is √5/4 +13√5/9 +3√5.\n\nConverting to common denominator 36:\n\n√5/4 = 9√5/36,\n\n13√5/9 =52√5/36,\n\n3√5=108√5/36.\n\nAdding these: 9 +52=61, 61+108=169. So total numerator is 169√5/36. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is sqrt of (169√5/36 divided by sqrt5).\n\nWhich is sqrt( (169√5/36) / sqrt5 ) = sqrt( (169√5)/(36*sqrt5) ) = sqrt(169/36)=13/6.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any step. Another way to approach it could be to combine the terms before taking the square root, but I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, I could have simplified the numerator differently. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider the entire expression under the square root first:\n\n(5/√80 + sqrt845/9 + sqrt45) / sqrt5\n\nI can write this as [5/√80 + sqrt845/9 + sqrt45] multiplied by 1/sqrt5.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express each term multiplied by 1/sqrt5 and then combine them.\n\nLet's see:\n\n5/√80"

Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the entire numerator is (5/√80 + sqrt845/9 + sqrt45), and then divided by sqrt5. So each term in the numerator is divided by sqrt5. So:\n\nFirst term: (5/√80)/sqrt5 = 5/(√80 * sqrt5) = 5/sqrt(80*5) = 5/sqrt(400) = 5/20 = 1/4.\n\nSecond term: (sqrt845/9)/sqrt5 = sqrt845/(9*sqrt5) = sqrt(845/5)/9 = sqrt(169)/9 = 13/9.\n\nThird term: sqrt45 / sqrt5 = sqrt(45/5) = sqrt9 = 3.\n\nWait, that's a different way of simplifying each term before adding them. Let me see if that works.\n\nSo, breaking down each term divided by sqrt5:\n\nFirst term: 5/(√80) divided by sqrt5 = 5/(√80 * sqrt5) = 5 / sqrt(80*5) = 5/sqrt(400). Since sqrt(400)=20, so 5/20 = 1/4. That's correct.\n\nSecond term: (sqrt845)/9 divided by sqrt5 = sqrt845/(9*sqrt5). Let's simplify sqrt845/sqrt5. Since sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(a/b). So sqrt(845/5) = sqrt(169) =13. So that term becomes 13/9.\n\nThird term: sqrt45 divided by sqrt5 = sqrt(45/5) = sqrt(9) = 3. So that term is 3.\n\nTherefore, adding all three terms: 1/4 + 13/9 + 3.\n\nNow, let's compute that.

Therefore, take the square root of that: sqrt(169/36) =13/6.\n\nSo, same result as before. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nI think I've double-checked both approaches: one by combining the terms before dividing and the other by dividing each term first, then combining.
