To do this, I'll start by finding the absolute value of (1 - i).\n\nThe absolute value of a complex number a + bi is given by the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So for the complex number 1 - i, a is 1 and b is -1.\n\nCalculating that, the absolute value is sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) which equals sqrt(2).\n\nNext, I need to raise this absolute value to the 8th power. \n\nSo, (sqrt(2))^8 can be rewritten as (2)^(8/2), which simplifies to 2^4.\n\nFinally, 2 raised to the 4th power is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\), we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Absolute Value of \\( (1 - i) \\)\nThe absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\nFor \\( 1 - i \\), \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\), so:\n\\[\n|(1 - i)| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Raise the Absolute Value to the 8th Power\nNow, we raise the result to the 8th power:\n\\[\n|(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n\\]\nSimplify \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 \\):\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{8/2} = 2^4 = 16\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
