            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about a Senate committee with 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. They need to sit around a circular table, and all members of each party must sit next to each other. Also, two seatings are considered the same if one is just a rotation of the other. Hmm, okay, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, let's visualize the problem. It's a circular table, so seating arrangements that can be rotated into each other are equivalent. That usually means we fix one person's position to avoid counting rotations multiple times. But in this case, it's a bit more complicated because we have groups that must stay together.\n\nSo, the parties are Democrats (D), Republicans (R), and one Independent (I). Each party must sit together, meaning that the three groups D, R, and I form three distinct blocks or \"clusters\" around the table. Since the table is circular, the arrangement of these blocks around the table matters, but rotations of the same block arrangement are considered the same.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. **Fixing a Position**: Because the table is circular, I can fix one party's position to eliminate rotational duplicates. Let's fix the Independent (I) at a specific seat. This means that the entire group around I can be arranged in a line, but the circular nature still affects how we count the rotations within each party.\n\n2. **Arranging the Blocks**: Once I'm fixed, the next step is to arrange the three blocks: D, R, and I. Since each party must sit together, these blocks are treated as single units for this part of the problem. The number of ways to arrange these blocks around the table is (number of blocks - 1)! because in circular permutations, fixing one position reduces the count by one factorial. So, since there are three blocks, it should be (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways. Wait, but I think that's not quite right because in this case, the blocks are distinguishable (D, R, I). So, the number of ways to arrange them around the fixed I should be (3-1)! = 2, but since they are distinct, it's actually 2! = 2. No, wait, fixing one block, the remaining two can be arranged in 2! ways. So, that's 2 ways.\n\n3. **Arr"

            "output": "anging Within Each Block**: Now, within each party block, the members can be arranged among themselves. The Democrats have 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways. The Independent is just one person, so that's 1!.\n\n4. **Considering the Orientation of Each Block**: Wait a second, when arranging the blocks around the table, do we also have to consider the direction each block is facing? For example, the block of Democrats could be arranged clockwise or counterclockwise. Hmm, actually, since the blocks are fixed in their positions once we've arranged them around the table, but the members within each block can be rotated. Wait, but in circular arrangements, if the block is considered as a linear arrangement, then the members can be arranged in a line, but since the block is part of a circular table, does that affect anything?\n\nWait, actually, when the blocks are arranged around the table, each block itself is a linear arrangement because the block is a group of people sitting consecutively. Since the block is part of a circular table, but the block itself is linear, so the number of ways to arrange the members within each block is (number of members)! because they can be arranged in a line. For example, the Democrats can be arranged in 5! ways, and similarly for Republicans. The Independent is just one person, so no arrangement needed there.\n\nBut hold on, when arranging the blocks around the table, since we fixed the Independent's position, the other two blocks (D and R) can be arranged in 2! ways. So, putting it all together:\n\nTotal arrangements = (arrangements of blocks) \u00d7 (arrangements within D) \u00d7 (arrangements within R) \u00d7 (arrangements within I)\n\nBut since I is fixed, maybe the Independent's position is fixed, so the blocks D and R can be arranged in 2! ways around the table. Then, within each block, the members can be arranged in 5! and 5!.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, fix the Independent's position. Since the table is circular, fixing one person's position removes rotational symmetry. So, the Independent is fixed at a specific seat. Now, the remaining two parties (D and R) must be arranged around the table. Since there are"

            "output": " two blocks left, D and R, and the table is circular but we've fixed one position, the number of ways to arrange D and R relative to each other is (2-1)! = 1 way? Wait, no, that's because in a circular arrangement, fixing one position reduces the number of arrangements by (n-1)! But in this case, after fixing I, we have two blocks left, D and R, which can be arranged in 2 ways: either D comes first and then R, or R comes first and then D.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as: once I is fixed, the remaining seats are 10 in total, but divided into two blocks of 5 each (D and R). So, the two blocks must each occupy 5 consecutive seats. The number of ways to arrange these blocks around the table is (2-1)! = 1, because in circular arrangements, fixing one block's position (say, D next to I) leaves only one place for R. But wait, that doesn't sound right because we could have D block on one side and R on the other, but in a circular table, once I is fixed, the direction matters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's (number of blocks - 1)! So, 2 blocks: (2-1)! =1. But since the two blocks are distinguishable (D and R), the number of ways to arrange them is 1! =1? But that can't be right because we can have either D first or R first, so that would be 2 ways.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something here. Let me try to model it as a circular arrangement where one position is fixed. So, let's fix the Independent at a specific seat. Now, the remaining seats are to be occupied by the D and R blocks, each of size 5.\n\nSince the table is circular and I is fixed, the remaining seats form a line in circular order. So, the D and R blocks must be placed next to I or each other. Wait, no, because I is fixed, so the D and R blocks must each occupy a linear block of 5 consecutive seats. But since I is fixed, the arrangement of D and R can be either to the left or right of I, but that would only be two possibilities. Wait, but in a circular table, once I is fixed, the direction ("

Then, the D block can be in seats 2-6 and R in 7-11, or D in 7-11 and R in 2-6. So that's two possibilities. Alternatively, maybe there are more?\n\nWait, actually, the D and R blocks can be arranged in any order around the table, but since the table is circular and we fixed the Independent, the two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways. So, that's 2 ways. So, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is 2!.\n\nThen, within each block, the members can be arranged in 5! ways for D and 5! for R. The Independent is fixed, so 1!.\n\nTherefore, total arrangements would be 2! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5!.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. Let me think of the steps again:\n\n1. Fix the Independent's position to account for rotational symmetry. This is because in circular permutations, fixing one position removes the rotational duplicates. So, we fix the Independent at seat 1.\n\n2. Now, the remaining 10 seats must be divided into two blocks of 5 each (D and R). The two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways (either D first then R, or R first then D) around the table.\n\n3. Within each block, the members can be arranged in 5! ways for each party.\n\nTherefore, total arrangements: 2! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5!.\n\nBut wait, is there another factor here? For example, when arranging the blocks, do we have to consider the direction of each block? Like, the D block can be arranged clockwise or counter-clockwise? Hmm, no, because the members within the block can be arranged in any order, so the direction is accounted for in the 5!.\n\nWait, for example, if the D block is in seats 2-6, then the first seat (seat 2) can be any of the 5 Democrats, so the 5! accounts for all permutations. So, the direction is already considered in the linear arrangement of the block. Since the block is a linear arrangement around the table, but the starting point is fixed once the block is placed next to the Independent."

(for the Independent, but that's just 1, so it's 2! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5!).\n\nLet me compute that numerically to see the value.\n\n5! is 120, so 120 \u00d7 120 = 14,400. Then, multiply by 2: 28,800.\n\nSo, the total number of seating arrangements is 28,800.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the arrangement of the blocks might have more possibilities? For example, is arranging the blocks around the table not just 2! because of the fixed Independent?\n\nYes, because once the Independent is fixed, the two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways relative to each other. So, that's 2 ways.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. The total number of ways is 2 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 120 = 28,800.\n\nWait, but hold on. There's another consideration: the blocks themselves can be rotated, but since we've fixed the Independent's position, the blocks can't be rotated anymore because their positions relative to I are fixed. So, each block is a linear arrangement that starts right after the fixed I, but actually, no, because the table is circular, but I is fixed, and the blocks are next to I on either side.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think that after fixing I, the remaining two blocks can be placed either clockwise or counter-clockwise relative to I. Wait, but in a circular table, once I is fixed, the direction is determined. So, perhaps the D and R blocks can be arranged in two ways: D on one side and R on the other, or vice versa. That is, indeed, 2! ways.\n\nTherefore, yes, 2! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5! = 28,800.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the circular nature of the table and the constraint that each party must sit together. \n\n1. **Fix the Independent's position**: This eliminates rotational symmetry.\n2. **Arrange the blocks**: The two remaining parties (D and R) can be arranged in 2! ways around the fixed"
