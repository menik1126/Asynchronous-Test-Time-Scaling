Proper divisors are all the positive divisors of a number that are less than the number itself.\n\nI'll start by checking if 284 is divisible by small prime numbers. First, I'll check if it's divisible by 2. Since 284 is even, it is divisible by 2, and the result is 142.\n\nNext, I'll check if 142 is divisible by 2. It is, and the result is 71. Now, I'll check if 71 is a prime number. Since 71 is only divisible by 1 and itself, it is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71, which is \\(2^2 \\times 71\\).\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of proper divisors, which is \\((1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^n) - p\\), where p is a prime number and n is its exponent, I can calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\nFor 284, the sum of its proper divisors is \\((1 + 2 + 4) - 2 = 7\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 7. Since 7 is a prime number, its only proper divisor is 1.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 7 is 1.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nFind the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\n**Step 1: Find the Proper Divisors of 284**\n\n- **Definition:** A proper divisor of a number \\( N \\) is a positive integer that divides \\( N \\) without leaving a remainder, excluding \\( N \\) itself.\n  \n- **Find the prime factors of 284:**\n  - 284 is even, so it's divisible by 2.\n  - \\( 284 \\div 2 = 142 \\)\n  - 142 is also even, so it's divisible by 2.\n  - \\( 142 \\div 2 = 71 \\)\n  - 71 is a prime number.\n  \n- **Prime Factorization:**  \n  \\( 284 = 2^2 \\times 71 \\)\n\n- **Calculate the sum of all"
