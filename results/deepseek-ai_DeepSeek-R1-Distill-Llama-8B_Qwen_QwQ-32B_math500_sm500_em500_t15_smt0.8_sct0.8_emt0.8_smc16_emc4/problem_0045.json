Proper divisors of a number are all its positive divisors excluding the number itself.\n\nI'll start by factorizing 284. Since 284 is even, it's divisible by 2.\n\n284 \u00f7 2 = 142\n\nNow, I'll factorize 142, which is also even.\n\n142 \u00f7 2 = 71\n\n71 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71\u00b9.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/(p - 1) for each prime factor p raised to the power n, I'll calculate the sum of all divisors, including 284.\n\nFor the prime factor 2:\n(2\u00b3 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 7\n\nFor the prime factor 71:\n(71\u00b2 - 1)/(71 - 1) = (5041 - 1)/70 = 5040/70 = 72\n\nFinally, I'll find the sum of all divisors by multiplying these results:\n7 \u00d7 72 = 504\n\nSince the sum of all divisors includes 284 itself, I'll subtract 284 to get the sum of the proper divisors:\n504 - 284 = 220\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 220.\n\n220 \u00f7 2 = 110\n110 \u00f7 2 = 55\n55 \u00f7 5 = 11\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 220 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b9 \u00d7 11\u00b9.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again for each prime factor:\n\nFor 2:\n(2\u00b3 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 7\n\nFor 5:\n(5\u00b2 - 1)/(5 - 1) = 24/4 = 6\n\nFor 11:\n(11\u00b2 - 1)/(11 - 1) = (121 - 1)/10 = 120/10 = 12\n\nMultiplying these together gives the sum of all divisors:\n7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 12 = 504\n\nSince this includes 220 itself, I'll subtract 220 to find"
