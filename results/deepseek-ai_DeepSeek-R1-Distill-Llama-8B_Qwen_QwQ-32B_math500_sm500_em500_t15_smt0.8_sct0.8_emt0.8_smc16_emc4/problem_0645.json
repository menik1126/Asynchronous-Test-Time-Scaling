            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find P(16) for a quadratic polynomial P(x). The problem states that for all real numbers x, the polynomial satisfies the inequality \\(x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq P(x) \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3\\). Additionally, I'm given that P(11) = 181. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, it must have the general form \\(P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\), where a, b, and c are real coefficients that I need to determine. The problem gives me two inequalities that this polynomial must satisfy for all real x. So, I can write them as:\n\n1. \\(x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq ax^2 + bx + c\\)\n2. \\(ax^2 + bx + c \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3\\)\n\nThese inequalities must hold for all real numbers x, which suggests that the difference between P(x) and each of the bounding quadratics must be less than or equal to zero for all x. Let me consider each inequality separately.\n\nStarting with the first inequality:\n\n\\(x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq ax^2 + bx + c\\)\n\nSubtracting \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) from both sides gives:\n\n\\(0 \\leq (a - 1)x^2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\\)\n\nThis quadratic expression must be non-negative for all real x. For a quadratic to be non-negative for all x, its leading coefficient must be non-negative, and its discriminant must be less than or equal to zero. So, let me apply these conditions.\n\nFirst, the leading coefficient: \\(a - 1 \\geq 0\\), which implies \\(a \\geq 1\\).\n\nNext, the discriminant condition. The quadratic is \\((a - 1)x^2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\\). The discriminant D is \\([b + 2]^2 - 4(a - 1)(c - 2) \\leq 0\\). So:\n\n\\([b"

Therefore, a must be between 1 and 2, inclusive. So, \\(1 \\leq a \\leq 2\\).\n\nNow, let's look at the two discriminant conditions.\n\nFrom condition (1a):\n\n\\([b + 2]^2 - 4(a - 1)(c - 2) \\leq 0\\). Let me expand that.\n\n\\([b^2 + 4b + 4] - 4(a - 1)(c - 2) \\leq 0\\).\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(b^2 + 4b + 4 - 4(a - 1)(c - 2) \\leq 0\\). Let me write this as \\(b^2 + 4b + 4 \\leq 4(a - 1)(c - 2)\\).\n\nSimilarly, condition (2a):\n\n\\((-4 - b)^2 - 4(2 - a)(3 - c) \\leq 0\\).\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\(16 + 8b + b^2"

Now, let me see if I can relate these two inequalities.\n\nBut before that, maybe I should express P(11) = 181, which is an equation involving a, b, and c. So, substituting x = 11 into P(x):\n\n\\(a(11)^2 + b(11) + c = 181\\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\(121a + 11b + c = 181\\) -> Equation (3).\n\nSo, now I have three unknowns: a, b, c. I can try to find them using the inequalities and Equation (3). But since inequalities might not be straightforward to solve, maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the difference between the upper and lower bounds to find a relation.\n\nWait, let me consider that the polynomial P(x) lies between two quadratics for all real x. So, the difference between the upper and lower bounds is:\n\n(2x^2 -4x +3) - (x^2 -2x +2) = x^2 - 2x +1.\n\nWhich is equal to (x - 1)^2, which is a perfect square, always non-negative. So, the difference between the upper and lower bound is (x - 1)^2, which is always \u22650, so P(x) must lie exactly halfway between these two quadratics at x=1, perhaps? Or maybe it's that P(x) is squeezed between them, so maybe P(x) is the average of the two quadratics? Because if the difference between upper and lower is (x - 1)^2, then the average of upper and lower would be [ (x^2 - 2x + 2) + (2x^2 -4x +3) ] / 2 = (3x^2 -6x +5)/2. Hmm, but wait, that might not necessarily be the case. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe P(x) is exactly equal to the average of the two bounds. Because if P(x) is between the two for all x, and the difference between them is (x -"

Alternatively, perhaps P(x) touches both bounds at some points, so that the inequalities become equalities there, which would give us equations to solve.\n\nAlternatively, since the inequalities must hold for all real x, the quadratic P(x) must be sandwiched between the two given quadratics. Therefore, the difference between P(x) and the lower bound must be a non-negative quadratic, and the difference between the upper bound and P(x) must also be a non-negative quadratic. So, both of these differences must be perfect squares? Or at least non-negative definite quadratics.\n\nWait, but for a quadratic to be non-negative for all x, it must be a perfect square only if its discriminant is zero. Otherwise, it's just a quadratic with leading coefficient positive and discriminant \u22640. So, perhaps in this case, the differences between P(x) and the bounds are non-negative quadratics with discriminant \u22640. But maybe they are perfect squares? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal case is when the inequalities are tight at some points, so that the quadratic P(x) touches the lower bound at some points and the upper bound at others. Since the difference between the upper and lower bound is (x -1)^2, which is zero only at x=1, so maybe P(x) must touch both bounds at x=1?\n\nWait, let's check x=1. Let me plug x=1 into the inequalities.\n\nLower bound at x=1: 1 -2 +2 =1.\n\nUpper bound at x=1: 2(1)^2 -4(1) +3 = 2 -4 +3 =1.\n\nSo, at x=1, both the lower and upper bounds equal 1. Therefore, P(1) must equal 1, since it's sandwiched between 1 and 1. So, P(1)=1.\n\nThat's a key point. So, P(1)=1. Let me note that as Equation (4):\n\n\\(a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c =1\\).\n\nSo now, I have Equation (3): 121a +11b +c =181,\n\nand Equation (4): a + b +"

Wait, let me compute this step carefully.\n\nSo, 4(a -1)(-1 -a -b) = 4(a -1)*(-1)(1 +a +b) = -4(a -1)(1 + a +b).\n\nBut when we subtract that term, it becomes:\n\n(b +2)^2 - [ -4(a -1)(1 +a +b) ] = (b +2)^2 +4(a -1)(1 +a +b).\n\nBecause subtracting a negative is adding a positive.\n\nSo, condition (1a) becomes:\n\n\\( (b + 2)^2 + 4(a -1)(1 +"

Wait, actually:\n\n(2a + b)^2 = 4a\u00b2 +4ab +b\u00b2.
