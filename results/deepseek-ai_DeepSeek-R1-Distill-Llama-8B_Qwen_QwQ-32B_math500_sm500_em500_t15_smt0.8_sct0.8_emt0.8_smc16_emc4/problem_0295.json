The given \\( z \\) is \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i \\), and \\( c \\) is \\( 2 - 3i \\). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that rotating a complex number can be done by translating it so that the center of rotation is the origin, applying the rotation, and then translating back. So, the process involves three main steps: subtracting the center \\( c \\) from \\( z \\) to get the vector from \\( c \\) to \\( z \\), rotating this vector by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), and then adding \\( c \\) back to get the rotated point \\( w \\).\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n\\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i \\)\n\nI can rewrite this as \\( z = (2 + \\sqrt{2}) + (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2})i \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( c = 2 - 3i \\), which is the center of rotation.\n\nSo, first, I need to subtract \\( c \\) from \\( z \\) to get \\( z - c \\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\( z - c = [(2 + \\sqrt{2}) - 2] + [(-3 - 3\\sqrt{2}) - (-3)]i \\)\n\nSimplifying each part:\n\nReal part: \\( (2 + \\sqrt{2}) - 2 = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nImaginary part: \\( (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2}) + 3 = -3\\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nSo, \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check the real and imaginary parts again.\n\nReal part: 2 + sqrt(2) minus 2 is indeed sqrt(2). Good.\n\nImaginary part: (-3 - 3sqrt(2)) minus (-3) is -3sqrt(2). That"
