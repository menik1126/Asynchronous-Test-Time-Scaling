            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer. It's the equation \u221a\u00b3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16. I need to find the positive value of x that satisfies this. \n\nAlright, first things first, I think I should get rid of that cube root to make the equation simpler. Cube roots can be tricky, but I remember that if I cube both sides of the equation, I should be able to eliminate the cube root. So, if I do that, I'll have (x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) equal to 16 cubed. Let me calculate 16 cubed. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16 is... let me do that step by step. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, the equation becomes x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. To do that, I'll subtract 4096 from both sides to set it to zero. So, x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, 4 minus 4096 is -4092. So, the equation is x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nHmm, okay, now I have a quadratic equation. I can try to solve it using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)]/(2a). In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Let me plug those values in.\n\nFirst, let's compute the discriminant, which is b\u00b2 - 4ac. So, that's (-4) squared, which is 16, minus 4 times 1 times (-4092). That would be 16 + 4*4092. Wait, because subtracting a negative is like adding a positive. So, 4*4092 is... let me calculate that. 4 times 4000 is 16000, and 4 times 92 is 368"

            "output": ". So, 16000 + 368 is 16368. Adding that to 16, the discriminant is 16384.\n\nNow, take the square root of 16384. Hmm, I think this is a perfect square. Let me see. 128 squared is 16384 because 128 times 128 is... let me check. 100 times 128 is 12800, 20 times 128 is 2560, 8 times 128 is 1024. Adding those together: 12800 + 2560 is 15360, plus 1024 is 16384. Yes, so the square root of 16384 is 128.\n\nSo now, plug that back into the quadratic formula. We have x = [-(-4) \u00b1 128]/(2*1). That simplifies to x = (4 \u00b1 128)/2. So, that gives us two possible solutions: one where we add 128 to 4, and another where we subtract 128 from 4.\n\nCalculating each: 4 + 128 is 132, and 4 - 128 is -124. So, the two solutions are x = 132 and x = -124. But the question specifically asks for the positive value of x. So, out of these two, 132 is positive and -124 is negative. Therefore, the positive solution is x = 132.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation, cube both sides: (x\u00b2 -4x +4) = 16\u00b3, which is 4096. Then, move 4096 to the left side: x\u00b2 -4x +4 -4096=0, simplifies to x\u00b2 -4x -4092=0. Applied quadratic formula with a=1, b=-4, c=-4092. Discriminant is (-4)^2 -4(1)(-4092)=16 + 16368=16384. Square root of 16384 is 128. So, x=(4 +128)/2=132 and x=(4-128)/2=-62. Wait, hold on, earlier I said 4-128 is -124, but 4 divided by 2 is 2, right? Wait, no: x = [4 \u00b1 128]/2. So, 4"

No, wait. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(D)]/(2a). In this case, b is -4, so -b is 4. So, it's x = (4 \u00b1 128)/2. So, 4 +128 is 132, divided by 2 is 66. 4 -128 is -124, divided by 2 is -62. Wait, that's conflicting with what I had earlier. So, actually, I think earlier I messed up the calculation of (4 \u00b1 128)/2. So, I need to correct that.\n\nSo, let's clarify: 4 + 128 is 132, so 132 divided by 2 is 66. 4 - 128 is -124, divided by 2 is -62. Oh, so actually, the solutions are 66 and -62, not 132 and -124. That changes things. So, the positive solution is 66, not 132.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong before? I think I incorrectly divided 132 by 2 as 66, but earlier I thought it was 132, but actually, no. Wait, no: when I added 4 +128, I thought that was 132, but that was before dividing by 2. So, perhaps I forgot to divide both terms by 2 when I wrote x =132 and x=-124. Because in reality, it's (4 +128)/2 = 132/2=66, and (4 -128)/2=-124/2=-62.\n\nSo, I think that's where I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let's redo that step. If I have x = (4 \u00b1 128)/2, that's two separate fractions: x = [4 + 128]/2 and x = [4 - 128]/2. So, [4 + 128] is 132, divided by 2 is 66, and [4 - 128] is -124, divided by 2 is -62.

So, I need to check where I messed up.\n\nAh, okay, so my mistake was in the first calculation when I thought the solutions were 132 and -124, but actually, I forgot to divide by 2. So, that's an important step. So, the correct solutions are 66 and -62. Therefore, the positive value is 66. Hmm, so I need to verify this again.\n\nLet me check by plugging x =66 into the original equation to see if it works. The original equation is cube root of (x\u00b2 -4x +4) equals 16. Let's compute x\u00b2 -4x +4 when x is 66.\n\nFirst, x squared is 66 squared. 66 squared is 4356. Then, 4x is 4*66=264. So, 4356 minus 264 is 4356 - 264 = 4092. Then, adding 4 gives 4092 +4 = 4096. So, the expression inside the cube root is 4096. The cube root of 4096 is indeed 16, because 16 cubed is 4096. So that works.\n\nNow, let's check x = -62. Plugging in x = -62, x squared is (-62)^2 = 3844. Then, 4x is 4*(-62)= -248. So, x\u00b2 -4x +4 is 3844 - (-248) +4. That's 3844 +248 +4. Let's compute that: 3844 +248 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096. So, same result. The cube root of 4096 is 16, so that also works. So both solutions are valid. But since the question asks for the positive value, it's 66.\n\nWait, so my initial mistake was miscalculating the quadratic formula step. I had forgotten to divide"
