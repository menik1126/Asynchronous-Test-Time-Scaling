            "output": "To convert the fraction 57/160 to a terminating decimal, I first need to determine whether the denominator has any factors of 2 or 5. \n\nI'll start by factoring 160. Breaking it down, 160 can be expressed as 16 multiplied by 10, which are 2^5 and 2 \u00d7 5, respectively. This means that the prime factors of 160 are 2^5 and 5.\n\nNext, I'll examine the numerator, 57. This number is divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (5 + 7 = 12) is divisible by 3. Dividing 57 by 3 gives 19, which is a prime number. Therefore, 57 can be expressed as 3 \u00d7 19.\n\nSince there are no common factors between the numerator (57) and the denominator (160), the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nNow, I'll convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 57 by 160. To make this division easier, I'll express 57 as 57.000 and perform the division.\n\nStarting with 57 divided by 160, the first step is to determine how many times 160 fits into 57. Since 160 is larger than 57, I'll consider 57.000 and see how many times 160 fits into 570 (the first three decimal places). \n\n160 fits into 570 three times because 160 \u00d7 3 = 480, and 160 \u00d7 4 = 640, which is too large. Subtracting 480 from 570 gives a remainder of 90. \n\nNext, I'll bring down the next 0 to make it 900. Then, I'll see how many times 160 fits into 900. Since 160 \u00d7 5 = 800 and 160 \u00d7 6 = 960 (which is too big), 160 fits five times into 900. Subtracting 800 from 900 leaves 100. \n\nNow, I'll bring down another 0 to make it 1000. 160 fits into 1000 six times because 160 \u00d7 6 = 960. Subtracting 960 from 1000 gives a remainder of 40. \n\nBringing down the next 0 makes it 400. 160 fits into 400 exactly two times because 160 \u00d7 2 = 320. Subtracting 320 from 400 leaves "
