This will help in converting the fraction to a decimal.\n\nNext, I'll separate the fraction into two parts: one involving powers of 2 and the other involving powers of 5. This simplifies the calculation.\n\nThen, I'll divide each part by the respective power to convert it into a decimal form.\n\nAfter that, I'll combine these decimal parts to get the final result.\n\nFinally, I'll write the answer as a terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the Denominator**\nThe denominator is already factored into powers of 2 and 5:\n\\[\n2^2 \\cdot 5^7\n\\]\nThis form is ideal for converting to a decimal because it separates the powers of 2 and 5, which are the prime factors of 10.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the Fraction**\nWe can rewrite the fraction by separating the powers of 2 and 5:\n\\[\n\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21}{2^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5^7}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Convert Each Part to Decimal**\n\n- **For the part involving 2:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{21}{2^2} = \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25\n  \\]\n\n- **For the part involving 5:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{5^7} = \\frac{1}{78125} \\approx 0.0000128\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results**\nMultiply the two decimal parts together:\n\\[\n5.25 \\times 0.0000128 = 0.0000672\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0000672}\n\\]"
