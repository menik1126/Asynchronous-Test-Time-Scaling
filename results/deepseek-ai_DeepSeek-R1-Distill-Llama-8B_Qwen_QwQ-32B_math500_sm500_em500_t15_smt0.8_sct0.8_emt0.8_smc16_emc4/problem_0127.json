Each set of three binary digits corresponds to one octal digit.\n\n2. **Group the Binary Number**:\n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n   - Note: Pad the binary number with leading zeros if necessary to ensure the number of digits is divisible by three.\n\n3. **Convert Each Binary Group to Octal**:\n   - **101** in binary = **5** in octal\n   - **010** in binary = **2** in octal\n   - **011** in binary = **3** in octal\n   - **10** in binary = **8** in octal\n\n4. **Combine the Octal Digits**:\n   - The final octal number is **6525\u2088**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{6525_{8}}\n\\]"
