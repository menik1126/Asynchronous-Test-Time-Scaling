            "output": "First, I need to determine the correct calculation that William Sydney Porter intended to perform, which is the division of the complex numbers -3 + 4i by 1 + 2i.\n\nTo simplify this division, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. The complex conjugate of 1 + 2i is 1 - 2i.\n\nAfter multiplying, the expression becomes (-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) divided by (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i).\n\nNext, I'll carry out the multiplication in both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nIn the numerator, multiplying -3 by 1 gives -3, and -3 by -2i gives 6i. Multiplying 4i by 1 gives 4i, and 4i by -2i gives -8i². Since i² is -1, this becomes +8.\n\nCombining the results in the numerator, I have -3 + 6i + 4i + 8, which simplifies to 5 + 10i.\n\nIn the denominator, multiplying 1 by 1 gives 1, and 1 by -2i gives -2i. Multiplying 2i by 1 gives 2i, and 2i by -2i gives -4i². Again, since i² is -1, this becomes +4.\n\nCombining the results in the denominator, I have 1 - 2i + 2i + 4, which simplifies to 5.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the numerator by the denominator: (5 + 10i) / 5, which equals 1 + 2i.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the correct result of the calculation \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate** of the denominator to rationalize it.\n   \n   The complex conjugate of \\(1 + 2i\\) is \\(1 - 2i\\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} \\times \\frac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \\frac{(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 -"
