            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a steel sphere made by removing metal from the corners of a cube. The sphere has a 3-inch radius, and I need to find the volume of the original cube before the metal was removed. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a cube is. A cube has all sides equal, right? So, if the cube has a certain side length, all edges are the same length. Now, the sphere is formed by removing metal from the corners. Wait, when you remove metal from the corners of a cube, each corner is a small polyhedron. Since a cube has 8 corners, each corner removal would create a sort of protrusion or indentation? Hmm, actually, no. Wait, when you remove metal from the corners, you're taking away material such that each corner is replaced by a new face. Each corner is a right angle, so when you cut a corner off, you're essentially replacing that corner with a small flat face. Each of these faces is a triangle because the corner is where three edges meet at right angles. So, each corner removal creates a three-sided face. But wait, that doesn't sound quite right when thinking about spheres. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners. So, perhaps the sphere is inscribed inside the cube? But that doesn't make sense because if you remove metal from the corners, the sphere would be outside the cube, touching the midpoints of the cube's edges. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the sphere is carved out from the cube by cutting off each corner. So, each corner is replaced by a small portion of the sphere. But how does that exactly work?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to visualize this. If you take a cube and cut off each corner to form a sphere, then the sphere will fit snugly inside the cube, touching the centers of each face of the cube. But wait, in that case, the diameter of the sphere would be equal to the edge length of the cube because the sphere would touch the centers of each face. But the radius is given as 3 inches, so the diameter would be 6 inches. Therefore, the edge length of the cube would be 6 inches.\n\nBut let me think again. Is the sphere inside the cube, so that the diameter of the"

So, maybe there's a different way of interpreting this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is formed by removing the corners such that the sphere touches the original cube's edges or vertices. Wait, perhaps the sphere is the one that is tangent to the edges of the cube? Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cube is the minimal cube that can contain the sphere, but the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners. Wait, but the sphere is made from the cube, so the cube must be the original block from which the sphere is carved out. The problem says \"removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths.\" So, the cube must be the minimal cube such that when you remove the corners (in some way), you end up with a sphere of radius 3 inches. \n\nHmm, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so the sphere touches the centers of each face of the cube. In that case, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Since the radius is 3, the diameter is 6, so the cube would have edges of 6 inches. Then the volume would be 6^3 = 216 cubic inches. But that seems straightforward, but maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"removing metal from the corners of a cube\". If you inscribe a sphere in a cube, you don't just remove the corners. You have to remove material from all over the cube. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is formed by cutting off each corner of the cube such that the sphere is the rounded part. Wait, but how exactly would that work? If you cut off each corner of a cube, you can form a rounded shape, but to make a perfect sphere, the cuts have to be such that all the points on the sphere's surface are equidistant from the cube's center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is the inscribed sphere of the cube, but the cube is the minimal cube such that when you remove the corners (the parts beyond the sphere), you get the sphere.

But let's check that.\n\nThe radius is 3 inches, so diameter is 6 inches, so edge length is 6 inches, cube's volume is 6^3 = 216 cubic inches. That seems correct, but let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is formed by the cube's edges being tangent to the sphere's surface. Wait, that could also be the case. So, in that scenario, each edge of the cube would be tangent to the sphere. So, how does that affect the cube's edge length?\n\nWait, let's model this mathematically. Let's consider the cube centered at the origin for simplicity. So, the cube's edges would run from (-a, -a, -a) to (a, a, a), where 'a' is half the edge length of the cube. The sphere is centered at the origin with a radius of 3 inches. Now, the edges of the cube are along the axes, so each edge is along, say, the x-axis from (-a, -a, -a) to (-a, a, a), but wait, no, the edges are from (-a, -a, -a) to (a, -a, -a), etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to model one edge.\n\nWait, but perhaps the sphere touches the midpoints of the cube's edges. So, the midpoints would be at (a,0,0), (-a,0,0), etc. The distance from the origin to each of these points is 'a' units. So, if the sphere is to touch these midpoints, then the radius of the sphere would be equal to 'a', correct? So, if the sphere's radius is 3, then 'a' is 3, making the edge length of the cube equal to 2a = 6 inches. So the cube's edge length is 6 inches, as before. So the volume of the cube is 6^3 = 216 cubic inches.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. But let me make sure by considering another approach. The cube has its edges tangent to the sphere.

The edge length of the cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere, so 6 inches. So, the volume is 6^3 = 216. That seems straightforward, but the problem mentions removing metal from the corners. So, perhaps the sphere is not inscribed, but the corners are cut off such that the remaining shape is a sphere. \n\nWait, but cutting off the corners of a cube can form an octahedron or another shape, but not a sphere. To form a sphere, you need to remove material in such a way that all points on the surface are equidistant from the center. So, perhaps the cube is the minimal cube that can contain the sphere, and the sphere is the result of removing the parts of the cube that are outside the sphere. But in that case, the cube would have edges equal to the diameter of the sphere, so again 6 inches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is the one that touches all the vertices of the cube. Wait, in that case, the sphere would be the circumscribed sphere of the cube. The radius of the circumscribed sphere of a cube is equal to half the space diagonal of the cube. The space diagonal of a cube with edge length 's' is s\u221a3, so the radius would be (s\u221a3)/2. \n\nIf the sphere's radius is 3 inches, then (s\u221a3)/2 = 3, so s = (3 * 2)/\u221a3 = 6/\u221a3 = 2\u221a3 \u2248 3.464 inches.

The problem says the cube has the shortest possible side lengths.

I think I need to clarify: if you remove metal from the cube's corners to make a sphere, then the sphere must fit within the cube. But the question is how the sphere is positioned relative to the cube. If the sphere is made by cutting off the corners, then perhaps the sphere is tangent to the cube's edges but does not touch the cube's vertices. Wait, perhaps the sphere touches the midpoints of the cube's edges, which as we saw earlier, gives the edge length of the cube as 6 inches. So, the cube's edge would be 6 inches, and the volume is 216 cubic inches.\n\nWait, but let's see another approach. Let's model the cube with edge length 's', and the sphere of radius 'r' is cut off from the cube. We need to find the relationship between 's' and 'r'. If the sphere is made by cutting off each corner of the cube, then each corner cut-off is a spherical octant. Wait, but a sphere can't be just made by cutting off cube corners; the sphere would have to have the same radius in all directions. So, perhaps each corner is cut such that the sphere's radius is such that it touches the centers of each face of the cube.\n\nWait, in that case, the sphere's diameter would be equal to the cube's edge length.

The distance from the center (0,0,0) to an edge, say the edge along the x-axis from (s/2, -s/2, -s/2) to (s/2, s/2, s/2).

The cross product of this vector with the direction vector (-s, 0, 0) is:\n\n(s/2)(0) - (s/2)(0) = 0,\n\nWait, actually, let's compute P \u00d7 v, where P is (s/2, s/2, s/2) and v is (-s, 0, 0).\n\nSo cross product is:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|s/2 s/2 s/2|\n|-s \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a00|\n\n= i*(s/2*0 - s/2*0) - j*(s/2*0 - s/2*(-s)) + k*(s/2*0 - s/2*(-s))\n\n= i*(0 - 0) - j*(0 - (-s^2/2)) + k*(0 - (-s^2/2))\n\n= 0i - j*(s^2/2) + k*(s^2/2)\n\nSo the cross product vector is (0, -s^2/2, s^2/2).

Let me think about how the sphere is formed by removing metal from the cube's corners.\n\nIf the sphere is tangent to the cube's edges, then you're removing material from each corner such that the newly formed sphere touches each edge at exactly one point. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if the sphere is inscribed in the cube, touching each face's center, then you're not removing the corners, but removing material from the entire cube except the sphere inside. But the problem specifically says removing metal from the corners, which implies that only the corners are being removed to form the sphere, not the whole cube.\n\nSo, if you remove the corners, each corner is a vertex, and by cutting each corner, you create a new face at each corner. If the sphere is to be formed by these cuts, then the sphere must be tangent to the cube's edges, meaning the sphere touches each edge at one point. Therefore, the distance from the center of the cube to each edge must be equal to the sphere's radius, which is 3 inches.\n\nWait, then as calculated, s = 3\u221a2 inches, so the edge length is 3\u221a2 inches, and the volume is (3\u221a2)^3 = 27*2\u221a2 = 54\u221a2 cubic inches, which is approximately 76.36 cubic inches.\n\nBut now, I'm confused because two different interpretations lead to two different results.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model this as follows: when you remove a corner from a cube, you are effectively cutting the corner with a plane that intersects the edges meeting at that corner. The shape you remove is a corner pyramid. If you make these cuts such that the resulting surface is a sphere, then the sphere must be tangent to each of these planes. Therefore, the"

But the problem states that the cube has the shortest possible side lengths, so we need the minimal cube such that when you remove the corners (in the way that forms a sphere of radius 3), the cube is as small as possible.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too abstract. Let me think of the cube and sphere in terms of coordinates again.\n\nSuppose the cube is centered at the origin with edge length s, so each face is at \u00b1s/2 along each axis. The sphere is also centered at the origin with radius 3. The corners of the cube are at (\u00b1s/2, \u00b1s/2, \u00b1s/2).

The distance from the center to a corner is (s/2)*\u221a3 (since it's the space diagonal divided by 2). So, (s/2)*\u221a3 = 3 inches.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm confusing the sphere with the cube after the corners are removed. If you remove the corners of a cube, you don't create a perfect sphere. You create a polyhedron with new faces where the corners were removed. So, to actually form a perfect sphere, the cube must be shaped such that all points on the cube's surface beyond the sphere have been removed, and the remaining part is a sphere.\n\nBut that would require that the cube is a sphere, which is only possible if the cube is a sphere, which is a contradiction unless the cube is a sphere, which is not possible unless all edges are equal, which they are by definition.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward: the cube is such that when you remove its corners (each corner is a right-angled tetrahedron), the remaining part is a sphere. So, the sphere is the cube minus the eight tetrahedrons at each corner.\n\nBut in that case, the sphere's surface would be defined by the points where the cube's faces are tangent to the sphere after the corners are removed.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let's think of it as the cube with its corners cut off, forming a sphere. So, each corner cut-off is a small pyramid, and the sphere is the result of the cube minus these pyramids.\n\nIn this case, the sphere must be tangent to the cube's original faces. Wait, but that can't be because the original faces are being cut away when you remove the corners.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is such that it touches the centers of each face of the cube. So, the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's edge length, making the edge length 6 inches, and volume 216 cubic inches.\n\nBut then, if you remove the corners of the cube, you get a sphere, which suggests that the cube originally had larger edges, and by cutting off the corners, you create a sphere. Wait, but in that case, the cube's edge length would be larger than the sphere's diameter.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is formed by cutting off each corner such that the distance from the center of the cube to each face of the cube is equal to the sphere's radius. So, each face of the cube is a tangent plane to the sphere, at a distance of 3"

The distance from the center to each face is s/2, so s/2 = 3 inches, so s = 6 inches. Therefore, the cube's edge length is 6 inches, volume 216. \n\nThis seems to make sense. The sphere is inscribed in the cube, touching the centers of each face. To form the sphere, you remove the parts of the cube that are outside the sphere. But the problem says \"removing metal from the corners of a cube\". So, perhaps the corners are the only parts removed, but that's not the case here. The inscribed sphere would require removing material from all over the cube, not just the corners. \n\nHmm, so maybe the problem is using \"removing metal from the corners\" to mean that the only parts removed are the corners, and the rest of the cube remains. But in that case, the remaining shape would not be a sphere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cube is the minimal cube that can contain the sphere, and the sphere is formed by rounding the corners of the cube. The minimal cube would have edges equal to the sphere's diameter, so 6 inches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is the one that touches all the edges of the cube. As calculated earlier, that gives edge length 3\u221a2. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be referring to the cube's corners being the parts that are removed to form the sphere, so the sphere is the remaining part. The sphere must then be entirely within the cube, and the corners of the cube are the parts removed. To have the sphere of radius 3, the cube must be such that the distance from the center to each corner is exactly 3 inches. Wait, but the distance from the center to the corner is (s\u221a3)/2. Setting that equal to 3 gives s = 2\u221a3, so edge length 2\u221a3. \n\nBut in this case, the sphere would have a radius equal to the distance from the center to the corner, so the sphere would pass through the original cube's corners.

To minimize the cube's edge length, the corners must be exactly at the sphere's surface. \n\nTherefore, the distance from the center to each corner of the cube must be exactly 3 inches. \n\nThe distance from the center to a corner is (s/2)*\u221a3.

The cube's corners are exactly at the sphere's surface, so removing the corners (the parts beyond the sphere) leaves the sphere. Since the cube must be as small as possible, this is the minimal edge length.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cube is 24\u221a3 cubic inches. \n\nWait, but let me check units.

Yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the answer 216, thinking of the sphere inscribed in the cube. But according to the problem's wording, since you remove the corners to form the sphere, the sphere must be touching the corners, so the cube's edge length is 2\u221a3. \n\nHmm, but I need to confirm this with another approach. Let's think of the cube and sphere in coordinates. Let the cube have edge length s, centered at the origin. The sphere has radius 3. The corners of the cube are at (\u00b1s/2, \u00b1s/2, \u00b1s/2). The sphere's equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 = 9. \n\nIf the sphere is formed by removing the corners of the cube, then the corners must lie on the sphere.
