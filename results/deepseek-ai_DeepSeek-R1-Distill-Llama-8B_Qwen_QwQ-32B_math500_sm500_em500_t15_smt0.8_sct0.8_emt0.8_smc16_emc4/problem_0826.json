I need to find all possible values of the expression: \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\]\n\nFirst off, \u03c9\u00b3 = 1 means that \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity: 1, and the two complex roots. Let me write them down properly. The cube roots of unity are given by \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0ik/3) where k = 0, 1, 2. So, that's 1, e^(2\u03c0i/3), and e^(4\u03c0i/3). So, \u03c9 can be 1, or the other two complex numbers.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify which \u03c9 we're dealing with. So, we have to consider all possible \u03c9 that satisfy \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, which are 1, e^(2\u03c0i/3), and e^(4\u03c0i/3). So, we need to compute the expression for each of these \u03c9 and see what the value is.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than just plugging in each \u03c9. Maybe we can use some properties of roots of unity.\n\nI also remember that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0 for cube roots of unity. That might be useful here.\n\nLet me note that down: 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo, if I can express the denominators in terms of this, maybe that can help.\n\nLet me write the expression again:\n\nE = \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\]\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can find a common denominator or manipulate the expression to use the fact that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0.\n\nLet me first write E as:\n\nE = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\nMaybe I can combine these two fractions into a single fraction. The common denominator would be (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let's compute that:\n\nDenominator: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1*(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + \u03c9*(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9"

Therefore, denominator is 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The denominator simplifies to 1? Let me check that again step by step.\n\nFirst, expanding (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2):\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n1*1 + 1*\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9*1 + \u03c9*\u03c9\u00b2.\n\nSo that's 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3.\n\nSince \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, substitute that in:\n\n1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nAnd since 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, then \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, substituting that in:\n\n2 + (-1) = 1. So yes, the denominator is indeed 1. That's a nice simplification.\n\nNow, the numerator of the combined fraction would be (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 + \u03c9 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nAgain, using \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1, so numerator is 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression E is numerator/denominator = 1/1 = 1.\n\nWait, so does that mean that regardless of which cube root of unity we take (except maybe 1?), the expression is always 1?\n\nBut hold on, we need to check if \u03c9 = 1 is allowed here. Let me see.\n\nIf \u03c9 = 1, then the original expression becomes:\n\n1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1^2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that still works.\n\nWait, so even when \u03c9 is 1, the expression is 1. So, does that mean that for all"

Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the denominator is 1 for all \u03c9.\n\nWait, the denominator is (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2), which we found is 1. But is that always the case?\n\nLet me test with \u03c9 = 1.\n\nThen (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2*2 = 4, and the numerator is (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 4, so E = 4/4 = 1. That works.\n\nWhat about \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3). Let me compute it numerically.\n\nLet\u2019s compute (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) is a complex number on the unit circle at 120 degrees. Its real part is cos(2\u03c0/3) = -1/2, and imaginary part is sin(2\u03c0/3) = \u221a3/2. Similarly, \u03c9\u00b2 is the conjugate, so it's e^(4\u03c0i/3) with real part -1/2 and imaginary part -\u221a3/2.\n\nCompute (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = (1 - 1/2 - \u221a3/2 i)(1 - 1/2 + \u221a3/2 i). Let's compute this.\n\nMultiply the two complex numbers:\n\n(1 - 1/2 - \u221a3/2 i)(1 - 1/2 + \u221a3/2 i) = [ (1 - 1/2)^2 - (\u221a3/2)^2 ] because (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo, (1 - 1/2)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Then, (\u221a3/2)^2 = 3/4. So, 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/2.\n\nSo, (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = -1/2. Hmm, that's different from 1.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, earlier when I expanded, I got that (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1, but in reality for"

Then, \u03c9*\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9^(3) = 1. So, substituting:\n\n1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nBut since 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, substituting:\n\n2 + (-1) = 1. So that's the algebra.\n\nBut when I computed numerically for \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3), I got (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = -1/2. That contradicts the algebra. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the numerical example again.\n\nLet me compute (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) when \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3).\n\nFirst, \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) = cos(2\u03c0/3) + i sin(2\u03c0/3) = -1/2 + i (\u221a3/2).\n\nThen \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = cos(4\u03c0/3) + i sin(4\u03c0/3) = -1/2 - i (\u221a3/2).\n\nTherefore, 1 + \u03c9 = 1 + (-1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + (-1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nMultiplying these two:\n\n(1/2 + i\u221a3/2)(1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = (1/2)^2 - (i\u221a3/2)^2 = 1/4 - ( (i)^2 * 3/4 ) = 1/4 - ( (-1)*3/4 ) = 1/"

So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the value of \u03c9. Let's double-check. If \u03c9^3 = 1, and \u03c9 is not 1, then \u03c9 must be a primitive cube root of unity.\n\nSo \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) = cos(2\u03c0/3) + i sin(2\u03c0/3) = -1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = cos(4\u03c0/3) + i sin(4\u03c0/3) = -1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo 1 + \u03c9 is 1 + (-1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 is 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nMultiplying these gives (1/2)^2 - (i\u221a3/2)^2 = 1/4 - (-3/4) = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So yeah, the denominator is 1.\n\nTherefore, my initial algebra was correct. Earlier, I must have miscalculated when I thought (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) was -1/2, but no, it's actually 1. So that resolves the discrepancy.\n\nSo, the denominator is indeed 1 for any cube root of unity \u03c9, including \u03c9 = 1.\n\nSo the expression E is 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = [ (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) ] / (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) ) = (2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)/1 = 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nBut since we know that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, E = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo regardless of which cube root of unity \u03c9 is, whether it's 1, e^(2\u03c0i/3), or e^(4\u03c0i/3), the expression E is always "

Yep, that's correct.\n\nIf \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3), then from the expression, it's also 1, as we saw in the denominator calculation.\n\nSame with \u03c9 = e^(4\u03c0i/3), so yeah, in all cases, E is 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but wait a second\u2014is that possible? That the expression is always equal to 1 regardless of \u03c9? It seems a bit surprising, but given that both the numerator and denominator simplify to 1, it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute this expression. Let me try a different approach using complex conjugates or something else.\n\nLet me suppose that \u03c9 is not equal to 1, so \u03c9 \u2260 1. Then \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2 are complex conjugates because \u03c9\u00b2 is the other primitive cube root of unity.\n\nSo, we can write \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) and \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = e^(-2\u03c0i/3).\n\nTherefore, 1 + \u03c9 = 1 + e^(2\u03c0i/3) and 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + e^(-2\u03c0i/3).\n\nSo, 1/(1 + \u03c9) can be written as 1/(1 + e^(2\u03c0i/3)) and 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1/(1 + e^(-2\u03c0i/3)).\n\nI can compute each of these terms using the formula for 1/(1 + e^{i\u03b8}).\n\nUsing the formula 1/(1 + e^{i\u03b8}) = (1 - e^{i\u03b8}) / (1 - e^{2i\u03b8}) multiplied by something?
