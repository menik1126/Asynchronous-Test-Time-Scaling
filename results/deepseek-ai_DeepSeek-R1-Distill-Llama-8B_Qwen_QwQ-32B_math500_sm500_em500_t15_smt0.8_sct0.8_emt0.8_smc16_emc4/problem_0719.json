A y-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the y-axis, which is when \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nSo, I'll substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\( 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\).\n\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation \\( y^2 - 4y - 1 = 0 \\). To find the number of real solutions (which correspond to the y-intercepts), I'll calculate the discriminant using the formula \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\):\n\n\\( D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\).\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (\\( D = 20 \\)), there are two distinct real roots. Therefore, the parabola has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts of the parabola \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), we need to find the points where the graph crosses the \\( y \\)-axis.
