            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to write the expression \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I have to find the sum a + b + c. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at each term separately. I see that there are two terms with \u221a2 and two terms with \u221a3. Maybe I can combine them separately. Let me rewrite the expression:\n\n\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3\n\nI can group the \u221a2 terms together and the \u221a3 terms together:\n\n(\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2) + (\u221a3 + 1/\u221a3)\n\nNow, focusing on the \u221a2 part: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2. I think I can combine these into a single fraction by finding a common denominator. The common denominator for \u221a2 and 1/\u221a2 would be \u221a2. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2, I can write \u221a2 as (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/\u221a2 to get a common denominator. That would be 2/\u221a2. So, \u221a2 is equal to 2/\u221a2. Therefore, adding 2/\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 gives me (2 + 1)/\u221a2, which is 3/\u221a2. Okay, so that simplifies the \u221a2 part to 3/\u221a2.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the \u221a3 part: \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. Similarly, I can write \u221a3 as (\u221a3 * \u221a3)/\u221a3, which is 3/\u221a3. Adding that to 1/\u221a3 gives me 3/\u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 = 4/\u221a3. So, the \u221a3 part simplifies to 4/\u221a3.\n\nPutting it all together, the original expression becomes:\n\n3/\u221a2 + 4/\u221a3\n\nHmm, now I have two fractions with square roots in the denominators. I need to combine these into a single fraction. To do that,"

            "output": " I should probably rationalize the denominators so that both denominators are rational, which will allow me to find a common denominator.\n\nStarting with 3/\u221a2: To rationalize the denominator, I multiply both numerator and denominator by \u221a2. That gives me (3\u221a2)/(\u221a2 * \u221a2) = (3\u221a2)/2.\n\nNext, the term 4/\u221a3: Similarly, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a3. That becomes (4\u221a3)/(\u221a3 * \u221a3) = (4\u221a3)/3.\n\nSo now, the expression is:\n\n(3\u221a2)/2 + (4\u221a3)/3\n\nNow, I need to combine these two fractions into one. To add them together, they need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator (LCD) would be 6.\n\nSo, I can rewrite each fraction with denominator 6. For the first term, (3\u221a2)/2, I multiply numerator and denominator by 3, which gives me (9\u221a2)/6. For the second term, (4\u221a3)/3, I multiply numerator and denominator by 2, resulting in (8\u221a3)/6.\n\nNow, adding these together: (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nWait, let me double-check that:\n\n(3\u221a2)/2 is 3\u221a2 divided by 2. To get denominator 6, I multiply numerator and denominator by 3: 3*3=9, so 9\u221a2 over 6. Similarly, (4\u221a3)/3 multiplied by 2/2 is 8\u221a3 over 6. So yes, adding them gives (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nSo the expression is now in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Are these the smallest possible integers? Let me see if 9 and 8 have any common factors with 6.\n\nLooking at the numerator coefficients: 9 and 8. 9 factors into 3*3, and 8 is 2*2*2. So, they don't share any common factors with each other or with the denominator 6. Wait, but the denominator is 6, which is 2*3. The numerator coefficients are"

So, I think this is the simplest form because if I were to reduce the fractions, for example, 9/6 simplifies to 3/2, but then I would have (3\u221a2 + (8/3)\u221a3)/something, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps 3/2 and 8/3, but I don't think that would help. So, perhaps c=6 is the smallest possible denominator.\n\nBut let me confirm. The original expression after combining was (3\u221a2)/2 + (4\u221a3)/3. So, is 6 the smallest denominator for a common expression? Let's see, is there a smaller denominator? The denominators 2 and 3 have an LCD of 6, so yes, 6 is the smallest. So, c=6 is indeed the smallest possible.\n\nTherefore, the expression is (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6. Hence, a=9, b=8, and c=6.\n\nNow, to find a + b + c, that would be 9 + 8 + 6. Let me compute that: 9 + 8 is 17, and 17 + 6 is 23. So, the answer is 23.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting expression: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3\n\nCombine the \u221a2 terms: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2. I rewrote \u221a2 as 2/\u221a2, which is correct because \u221a2 * \u221a2 = 2. So, 2/\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 = 3/\u221a2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the \u221a3 terms: \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. \u221a3 is 3/\u221a3, so 3/\u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 = 4/\u221a3. Correct.\n\nSo, now it's 3/\u221a2 + 4/\u221a3. Then, rationalizing each term:\n\n3/\u221a2 becomes (3\u221a2)/2, yes.\n\n4/\u221a3 becomes (4\u221a3)/3, yes.\n\nNow, adding them together: need a common denominator, which"

So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, a=9, b=8, c=6. Sum is 23. Hmm, seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to combine terms first before rationalizing. Maybe that could lead to a different result?\n\nLet me try an alternative approach. Let's see:\n\nOriginal expression: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3\n\nAlternatively, instead of grouping the radicals first, maybe combine all terms over a common denominator? But that might be more complicated. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express all terms with denominators first:\n\n\u221a2 is \u221a2/1, so to combine all terms, perhaps find a common denominator of \u221a2 * \u221a3? Hmm, but that might complicate things. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can write the entire expression as a single fraction from the start. Let's see:\n\n\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3\n\nLet me consider all terms:\n\nFirst term: \u221a2 = \u221a2/1\n\nSecond term: 1/\u221a2\n\nThird term: \u221a3/1\n\nFourth term: 1/\u221a3\n\nTo combine all four terms, the denominators are 1, \u221a2, 1, \u221a3. The common denominator would be the product of all distinct denominators, but since denominators are 1, \u221a2, and \u221a3, so the LCD would be \u221a2 * \u221a3. But that might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe it's better to group terms as before.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if my first approach was correct. Since I arrived at (9\u221a2 +8\u221a3)/6, and the problem states that a, b, c are positive integers with c as small as possible, so 6 is the minimal denominator here. Since 9 and 8 are both in the numerator, and they don't have a common factor with 6"

So, a=9, b=8, c=6, sum is 23.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, what if I had rationalized the denominators differently when adding them?\n\nStarting again from the step where I had 3/\u221a2 + 4/\u221a3.\n\nAlternatively, could I combine these two fractions without rationalizing first? Let me try that.\n\nTo add 3/\u221a2 and 4/\u221a3, I need a common denominator. The denominators are \u221a2 and \u221a3, so the LCD would be \u221a2 * \u221a3 = \u221a6. So, to get denominators to \u221a6:\n\nFor 3/\u221a2: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a3 to get 3\u221a3 / \u221a6.\n\nFor 4/\u221a3: multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a2 to get 4\u221a2 / \u221a6.\n\nSo now, adding these together gives (3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2)/\u221a6.\n\nHmm, so that's another form: (4\u221a2 +3\u221a3)/\u221a6. Comparing with my earlier result, which was (9\u221a2 +8\u221a3)/6.\n\nWait, since (4\u221a2 +3\u221a3)/\u221a6 can be rationalized.\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a6:\n\n(4\u221a2 +3\u221a3) * \u221a6 / (\u221a6 * \u221a6) = (4\u221a12 +3\u221a18)/6.\n\nWait, \u221a12 is 2\u221a3, so 4\u221a12 is 4*2\u221a3 = 8\u221a3.\n\n\u221a18 is 3\u221a2, so 3\u221a18 is 3*3\u221a2 =9\u221a2.\n\nSo that gives (8\u221a3 +9\u221a2)/6, which is the same as before. So, it's the same expression, just in a different form when rationalized.\n\nSo, therefore, it still comes down to (9\u221a2 +8\u221a3)/6. So, a=9, b=8, c=6.\n\nTherefore, the sum a + b + c is 23.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(a + b + c\\) is \\boxed{23}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt"
