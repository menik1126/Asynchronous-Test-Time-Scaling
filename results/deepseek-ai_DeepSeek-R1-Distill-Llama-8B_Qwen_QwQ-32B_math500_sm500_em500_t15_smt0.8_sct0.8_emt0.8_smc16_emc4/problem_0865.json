            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to write the expression √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3 in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I have to find the sum a + b + c. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at each term separately. I see that there are two terms with √2 and two terms with √3. Maybe I can combine them separately. Let me rewrite the expression:\n\n√2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3\n\nI can group the √2 terms together and the √3 terms together:\n\n(√2 + 1/√2) + (√3 + 1/√3)\n\nNow, focusing on the √2 part: √2 + 1/√2. I think I can combine these into a single fraction by finding a common denominator. The common denominator for √2 and 1/√2 would be √2. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have √2 + 1/√2, I can write √2 as (√2 * √2)/√2 to get a common denominator. That would be 2/√2. So, √2 is equal to 2/√2. Therefore, adding 2/√2 + 1/√2 gives me (2 + 1)/√2, which is 3/√2. Okay, so that simplifies the √2 part to 3/√2.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the √3 part: √3 + 1/√3. Similarly, I can write √3 as (√3 * √3)/√3, which is 3/√3. Adding that to 1/√3 gives me 3/√3 + 1/√3 = 4/√3. So, the √3 part simplifies to 4/√3.\n\nPutting it all together, the original expression becomes:\n\n3/√2 + 4/√3\n\nHmm, now I have two fractions with square roots in the denominators. I need to combine these into a single fraction. To do that,"

            "output": " I should probably rationalize the denominators so that both denominators are rational, which will allow me to find a common denominator.\n\nStarting with 3/√2: To rationalize the denominator, I multiply both numerator and denominator by √2. That gives me (3√2)/(√2 * √2) = (3√2)/2.\n\nNext, the term 4/√3: Similarly, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by √3. That becomes (4√3)/(√3 * √3) = (4√3)/3.\n\nSo now, the expression is:\n\n(3√2)/2 + (4√3)/3\n\nNow, I need to combine these two fractions into one. To add them together, they need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator (LCD) would be 6.\n\nSo, I can rewrite each fraction with denominator 6. For the first term, (3√2)/2, I multiply numerator and denominator by 3, which gives me (9√2)/6. For the second term, (4√3)/3, I multiply numerator and denominator by 2, resulting in (8√3)/6.\n\nNow, adding these together: (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nWait, let me double-check that:\n\n(3√2)/2 is 3√2 divided by 2. To get denominator 6, I multiply numerator and denominator by 3: 3*3=9, so 9√2 over 6. Similarly, (4√3)/3 multiplied by 2/2 is 8√3 over 6. So yes, adding them gives (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nSo the expression is now in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Are these the smallest possible integers? Let me see if 9 and 8 have any common factors with 6.\n\nLooking at the numerator coefficients: 9 and 8. 9 factors into 3*3, and 8 is 2*2*2. So, they don't share any common factors with each other or with the denominator 6. Wait, but the denominator is 6, which is 2*3. The numerator coefficients are"

            "output": " 9 and 8, which don't have factors of 2 or 3 that would interfere. So, I think this is the simplest form because if I were to reduce the fractions, for example, 9/6 simplifies to 3/2, but then I would have (3√2 + (8/3)√3)/something, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps 3/2 and 8/3, but I don't think that would help. So, perhaps c=6 is the smallest possible denominator.\n\nBut let me confirm. The original expression after combining was (3√2)/2 + (4√3)/3. So, is 6 the smallest denominator for a common expression? Let's see, is there a smaller denominator? The denominators 2 and 3 have an LCD of 6, so yes, 6 is the smallest. So, c=6 is indeed the smallest possible.\n\nTherefore, the expression is (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Hence, a=9, b=8, and c=6.\n\nNow, to find a + b + c, that would be 9 + 8 + 6. Let me compute that: 9 + 8 is 17, and 17 + 6 is 23. So, the answer is 23.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting expression: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3\n\nCombine the √2 terms: √2 + 1/√2. I rewrote √2 as 2/√2, which is correct because √2 * √2 = 2. So, 2/√2 + 1/√2 = 3/√2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the √3 terms: √3 + 1/√3. √3 is 3/√3, so 3/√3 + 1/√3 = 4/√3. Correct.\n\nSo, now it's 3/√2 + 4/√3. Then, rationalizing each term:\n\n3/√2 becomes (3√2)/2, yes.\n\n4/√3 becomes (4√3)/3, yes.\n\nNow, adding them together: need a common denominator, which"

So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, a=9, b=8, c=6. Sum is 23. Hmm, seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to combine terms first before rationalizing. Maybe that could lead to a different result?\n\nLet me try an alternative approach. Let's see:\n\nOriginal expression: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3\n\nAlternatively, instead of grouping the radicals first, maybe combine all terms over a common denominator? But that might be more complicated. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express all terms with denominators first:\n\n√2 is √2/1, so to combine all terms, perhaps find a common denominator of √2 * √3? Hmm, but that might complicate things. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can write the entire expression as a single fraction from the start. Let's see:\n\n√2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3\n\nLet me consider all terms:\n\nFirst term: √2 = √2/1\n\nSecond term: 1/√2\n\nThird term: √3/1\n\nFourth term: 1/√3\n\nTo combine all four terms, the denominators are 1, √2, 1, √3. The common denominator would be the product of all distinct denominators, but since denominators are 1, √2, and √3, so the LCD would be √2 * √3. But that might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe it's better to group terms as before.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if my first approach was correct. Since I arrived at (9√2 +8√3)/6, and the problem states that a, b, c are positive integers with c as small as possible, so 6 is the minimal denominator here. Since 9 and 8 are both in the numerator, and they don't have a common factor with 6"

            "output": " beyond 1, I think that is the minimal form. So, a=9, b=8, c=6, sum is 23.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, what if I had rationalized the denominators differently when adding them?\n\nStarting again from the step where I had 3/√2 + 4/√3.\n\nAlternatively, could I combine these two fractions without rationalizing first? Let me try that.\n\nTo add 3/√2 and 4/√3, I need a common denominator. The denominators are √2 and √3, so the LCD would be √2 * √3 = √6. So, to get denominators to √6:\n\nFor 3/√2: multiply numerator and denominator by √3 to get 3√3 / √6.\n\nFor 4/√3: multiply numerator and denominator by √2 to get 4√2 / √6.\n\nSo now, adding these together gives (3√3 + 4√2)/√6.\n\nHmm, so that's another form: (4√2 +3√3)/√6. Comparing with my earlier result, which was (9√2 +8√3)/6.\n\nWait, since (4√2 +3√3)/√6 can be rationalized.\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by √6:\n\n(4√2 +3√3) * √6 / (√6 * √6) = (4√12 +3√18)/6.\n\nWait, √12 is 2√3, so 4√12 is 4*2√3 = 8√3.\n\n√18 is 3√2, so 3√18 is 3*3√2 =9√2.\n\nSo that gives (8√3 +9√2)/6, which is the same as before. So, it's the same expression, just in a different form when rationalized.\n\nSo, therefore, it still comes down to (9√2 +8√3)/6. So, a=9, b=8, c=6.\n\nTherefore, the sum a + b + c is 23.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(a + b + c\\) is \\boxed{23}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt"
