So, we have a cubic sequence defined by \\( a_n = n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d \\), where \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are integers. We need to determine the possible values of \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\).\n\nFirst, I remember that sequences like this can often be analyzed by looking at the structure of \\( a_n \\). Since it's a cubic polynomial, each term is a function of \\( n \\). The coefficients \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are constants, so they don't change as \\( n \\) changes.\n\nLet me write out what \\( a_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} \\) would be. Plugging in \\( n = 2015 \\) and \\( n = 2016 \\) into the formula:\n\n\\( a_{2015} = (2015)^3 + b (2015)^2 + c (2015) + d \\)\n\n\\( a_{2016} = (2016)^3 + b (2016)^2 + c (2016) + d \\)\n\nAlright, now we need to find the product \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\). But that seems really complicated because those numbers are huge. Maybe there's a smarter way instead of expanding everything.\n\nWait, I remember that sometimes when dealing with polynomials, especially consecutive terms, it can be useful to look at their difference or ratio. Let me consider \\( a_{2016} - a_{2015} \\). That might simplify things.\n\nCalculating the difference:\n\n\\( a_{2016} - a_{2015} = [(2016)^3 - (2015)^3] + b[(2016)^2 - (2015)^2] + c[(2016) - (2015)] \\)\n\nEach of these terms can be simplified using the difference of cubes, squares, etc. Let me recall the formulas:\n\n1. \\( x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) \\)\n2. \\( x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) \\)\n3. \\( x - y = 1 \\) since 2016 - 201"

Maybe instead of looking at the difference, I should consider the ratio \\( \\frac{a_{2016}}{a_{2015}} \\) or something related, but I'm not sure if that will help directly.\n\nAnother approach: Since it's a cubic polynomial, perhaps we can express it in a shifted form. Let me define \\( m = n - k \\) for some shift \\( k \\) to make the sequence align in a way that simplifies things. Wait, but without more information, I'm not sure if that's the right move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the factors of \\( a_n - n^3 \\). Because \\( a_n = n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d \\), so \\( a_n - n^3 = b n^2 + c n + d \\). Let me denote this as \\( p(n) \\), so \\( p(n) = b n^2 + c n + d \\).\n\nSo, \\( a_n = n^3 + p(n) \\).

From earlier, \\( a_{n+1} - a_n = 3n^2 + (3 + 2b)n + (1 + b + c) \\). Since this is a quadratic, it's possible that this can take any integer value.

From the expression \\( a_n = n^3 + p(n) \\), and \\( p(n) \\) is a quadratic, so \\( p(n) \\) can be any integer as \\( n \\) varies. Therefore, \\( k = p(2015) \\) and \\( m = p(2016) - p(2015) \\) can be any integers where \\( m = 4031b + c \\). So, since \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are integers, \\( m \\) can be any integer as well. Therefore, for any integer \\( m \\), we can choose \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) such that \\( m = 4031b + c \\).\n\nThus, substituting back, \\( a_{2015} = 2015^3 + k \\) and \\( a_{2016} = 2016^3 + k + m \\).
