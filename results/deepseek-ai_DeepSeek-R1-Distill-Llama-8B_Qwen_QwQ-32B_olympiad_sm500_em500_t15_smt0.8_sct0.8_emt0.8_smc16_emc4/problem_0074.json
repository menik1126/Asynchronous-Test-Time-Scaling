Maybe instead of trying to compute it directly, I can think about the possible factors or see if the product can be expressed in terms of some identity.\n\nAlternatively, consider that \\( a_n \\) is divisible by \\( n \\), so \\( a_n = n \\cdot k_n \\), where \\( k_n \\) is another integer. Therefore, \\( a_{2015} = 2015 \\cdot k_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} = 2016 \\cdot k_{2016} \\). Therefore, the product is \\( 2015 \\times 2016 \\times k_{2015} \\times k_{2016} \\).\n\nSo, the product is a multiple of \\( 2015 \\times 2016 \\), because both \\( a_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} \\) are multiples of their respective \\( n \\)'s. Therefore, the product \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\) is a multiple of \\( 2015 \\times 2016 \\).\n\nBut 2015 and 2016 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime.
