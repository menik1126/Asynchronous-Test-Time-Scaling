The key property these subsets need to have is that for every integer \\( n \\geq 15 \\), and for each subset \\( A_i \\), there exist two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) whose sum is exactly \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, the set of positive integers is infinite, so we're dealing with an infinite partitioning. The challenge is to ensure that for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), each subset \\( A_i \\) contains at least two numbers that add up to \\( n \\). So, each subset \\( A_i \\) must be \"dense\" enough in the integers so that for any large \\( n \\), there are pairs in \\( A_i \\) summing to \\( n \\).\n\nI remember that in number theory, similar problems often involve concepts like arithmetic progressions or coloring the integers in a way that satisfies certain additive conditions. Maybe I can model this problem using graph theory or something related.\n\nWait, actually, this sounds a bit like a covering problem. For each \\( n \\geq 15 \\), we need to cover all numbers \\( n \\) with sums from each \\( A_i \\). That is, for each \\( n \\), each \\( A_i \\) must cover \\( n \\) as a sum of two distinct elements from its own set.\n\nBut how does partitioning the integers affect this? We're limited by the number of subsets \\( k \\). The goal is to find the maximum \\( k \\) such that this covering is possible.\n\nLet me think about how to construct such subsets. Perhaps if each subset \\( A_i \\) contains numbers with certain properties that allow their sums to cover all large \\( n \\).\n\nAn idea comes to mind: if each subset \\( A_i \\) is a progression with a certain difference. For example, if \\( A_i \\) is the set of numbers congruent to some \\( a_i \\) modulo \\( k \\), but I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, no. If each \\( A_i \\) is a single congruence class modulo \\( k \\), then the sum of two elements from \\( A_i \\)"

That might not work because the residues would be limited.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different partitioning strategy. Let me think of the classic example where you partition numbers into even and odd. Then, the sum of two evens is even, and two odds is even, but an even and an odd would be odd. However, in this problem, each subset must cover all \\( n \\geq 15 \\). If we partition into evens and odds, then for the even subset, they can only form even sums, so they can't form odd \\( n \\). Similarly, the odd subset can only form even sums (since odd + odd = even). Wait, actually, the odd subset can't form odd sums. So that partition would not satisfy the condition because, for example, an odd \\( n \\geq 15 \\) would require the even subset to have two elements summing to it, but even + even is even, so that can't happen. So that partition is invalid.\n\nHmm, so partitioning into even and odd is bad. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a greedy method. Let me think of the minimal k. The question is asking for the maximum k. So maybe the maximum possible k is 2? Or maybe higher?\n\nWait, let's think of the problem in terms of Schur numbers. Schur numbers deal with partitioning integers into colors so that there's no monochromatic solution to \\( a + b = c \\). But this is a different condition. Here, we need that for every n >=15, each color class has a monochromatic pair summing to n. So it's kind of the opposite of Schur's problem. Instead of avoiding monochromatic solutions, we require that every n has at least one in each color.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the concept of additive bases. An additive basis of order 2 is a set such that every sufficiently large integer can be written as the sum of two elements from the set. Here, each subset must be an additive basis for the integers starting at 15, but each subset must individually cover all n >=15 as a sum of two of its elements.\n\nTherefore, each subset \\( A_i \\) must"

So the maximum \\( k \\) such that this is possible.\n\nWait, but I know that in additive number theory, the concept of additive basis applies to the entire set of integers, but here we need each subset to cover the integers starting at 15. So maybe the minimal size of such a basis is relevant.\n\nWait, let's think of the minimal size of a basis of order 2 for the integers >=15.\n\nFor example, if you have a set \\( A \\) such that every integer >=15 can be written as \\( a + b \\) with \\( a, b \\in A \\), then \\( A \\) is a basis of order 2 for the integers >=15.\n\nWhat is the minimal size of such a set \\( A \\)? I think it's known that the minimal size is 2. For example, the set \\( A = \\{1, 14\\} \\) can generate all numbers >=15 by adding 1s and 14s, but wait, wait. Actually, 1 + 14 = 15, 1 + 1 = 2, which is less than 15, so that doesn't work. So maybe a better example is needed.\n\nWait, no. If \\( A \\) must have the property that every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) can be expressed as \\( a + b \\) with \\( a, b \\in A \\), and \\( a \\neq b \\) (since they need to be distinct).

Suppose \\( A \\) is an arithmetic progression starting at \\( a \\), with difference \\( d \\). Then the minimal sum is \\( 2a \\), and the maximal sum can be as large as needed. To cover all numbers from 15 upwards, we need that the minimal sum \\( 2a \\leq 15 \\), so \\( a \\leq 7.5 \\), so \\( a \\leq 7 \\).

Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimal number of subsets required. Wait, actually, the question is asking for the maximum k. So, the more subsets we have, the harder it is to satisfy the condition because each subset has to individually cover all n >=15. So, the more subsets, the sparser each subset can be, but they still have to cover all n.

For example, {1,14} can only generate 15 and beyond, but in pairs. Wait, {1,14} would only give 15, 16=1+15, but 1 is only once. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, no. The set {1,14} can only form sums 1+14=15, 1+1=2 (but they have to be distinct elements, so 1+14=15 is the only sum they can form. So, they can't form 16,17,...

For instance, if A is an arithmetic progression with difference d, then the minimal sum is 2a, and then adding d successively. But unless d is 1, you can't cover all n >=15.\n\nWait, for example, if A is the set of all even numbers starting from 2: 2,4,6,...\n\nThen, the minimal sum is 4, and by adding even numbers, you can get all even numbers >=4. But we need to cover all n >=15, including the odd numbers. So in this case, even numbers alone won't do it. Similarly, the odd numbers also can't cover all n because their sums are even.\n\nWait, so maybe each subset A_i needs to contain both even and odd numbers, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each A_i must be a \"complete\" set in that it can represent every n >=15 as"

Let me try to define A as numbers congruent to 0 or 1 mod 3, and B as 2 mod 3. Wait, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split numbers into even and odd, but as before, that doesn't work because even + even is even, odd + odd is even, so neither can form odd numbers. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split numbers into two sets where each set contains both even and odd numbers. For example, A contains numbers congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4, and B contains 2 or 3 mod 4. Then, in A, you can have even and odd numbers. Let's see:\n\nIn A: 0 mod4 (even) and 1 mod4 (odd). So, adding two elements from A:\n\n0+0 mod4 = 0 mod4,\n\n0+1 mod4 =1 mod4,\n\n1+1 mod4=2 mod4.\n\nSo the possible sums mod4 are 0,1,2.

Similarly, B can cover all mod5 classes, but A can't.\n\nSo this partition isn't good either.\n\nHmm, maybe a different approach.\n\nPerhaps each subset needs to contain both small and large numbers so that their sums can cover all the required n.\n\nWait, if each subset A_i contains both numbers greater than or equal to 15/2=7.5, so at least 8, and also numbers below that, then their sums can cover all n >=15.\n\nBut if we partition the integers such that each subset contains a certain range, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, think of each subset A_i as containing numbers from certain intervals.\n\nWait, maybe the greedy algorithm.
