So, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. I need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) where, no matter what monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) I choose, with integer coefficients, I can always find some \\( k \\) (between 1 and \\( n \\)) and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers such that the sum of \\( P \\) evaluated at the first \\( k \\) integers is equal to \\( P \\) evaluated at the \\( (k+1) \\)-th integer.\n\nSo, essentially, for each such polynomial, there exists a solution to this equation with the specified conditions on \\( k \\) and the integers \\( x_i \\).\n\nI think the key here is to consider the properties of monic polynomials with integer coefficients. Monic means the leading coefficient is 1, and integer coefficients. So, for example, linear polynomials would be of the form \\( P(x) = x + c \\), quadratics would be \\( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\), and so on.\n\nSince the problem says \"for every monic polynomial\", I need to make sure that regardless of what \\( P \\) is, this condition holds. So, I need to find all \\( n \\) where this is true.\n\nMaybe I should start by testing small values of \\( n \\) and see if they satisfy the condition or not.\n\nLet me try \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nCase 1: \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P \\) is a monic polynomial of degree at most 1, which means it can be linear or constant.

I think in some conventions, the degree of a constant polynomial is considered as -1 or something, but in the context of polynomials of degree at most \\( n \\), perhaps the constant polynomial is allowed. Hmm, but in our problem, the polynomial is monic, so if it's constant, it has to have leading coefficient 1. But that would mean the constant term is 1, because the only term is \\( 1 \\). So, yes, constant polynomials with leading coefficient 1 are allowed.\n\nWait, but if \\( P \\) is a constant polynomial, say \\( P(x) = 1 \\), then \\( P(x_1) = 1 \\) for any \\( x_1 \\). So, to find \\( k \\) and \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) such that \\( 1 + 1 + \\ldots + 1 \\) (k times) equals 1. So, that would require \\( k = 1 \\), because \\( 1 = 1 \\).

So, similar to before, for constant polynomials, \\( k=1 \\) works.\n\nFor linear polynomials, same as before, but now \\( k \\) can be up to 2.

If \\( c=0 \\), then \\( x_3=1 \\), which is same as \\( x_2 \\). So, we need to choose differently.\n\nSo, let me adjust. Let's pick \\( x_1 = 0 \\), \\( x_2 = 2 \\).

Similarly, for any quadratic, the axis of symmetry will allow us to find two distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\).\n\nWait, but quadratics with integer coefficients might not necessarily have such symmetry. Wait, for a quadratic with integer coefficients, it can be written as \\( P(x) = (x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\( h \\) and \\( k \\) are integers. Therefore, the vertex is at \\( x = h \\), integer. So, for any integer \\( x \\), \\( P(h + t) = P(h - t) \\) for any integer \\( t \\). Therefore, we can take \\( x_1 = h + t \\), \\( x_2 = h - t \\), giving two distinct integers (as long as \\( t \\neq 0 \\)) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). Therefore, \\( k=1 \\) works for quadratics.\n\nAlternatively, even if the quadratic is not symmetric, maybe we can choose other pairs? Wait, but for a quadratic, it's a parabola, so unless it's a perfect square, but even so, for integer coefficients, the axis of symmetry is integer. So, yes, symmetry allows two distinct integers where the polynomial takes the same value. Therefore, \\( k=1 \\) works for quadratics.\n\nAlternatively, even without using the axis of symmetry, maybe for quadratics with certain \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), we can find two distinct integers with the same value. Hmm, but I think the axis of symmetry approach gives a straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we didn't know about symmetry, but just considered solving \\( x_1^2 + b x_1 + c = x_2^2 + b x_2 + c \\). That simplifies to \\( x_1^2 + b x_1 = x_2^2 + b x_2 \\implies x_1^2 - x_2^2 + b(x_1 - x_2) =0 \\implies (x_1 - x_2)(x_1 + x_2) + b(x_1 - x_2) =0 \\implies (x_1 - x_2"
