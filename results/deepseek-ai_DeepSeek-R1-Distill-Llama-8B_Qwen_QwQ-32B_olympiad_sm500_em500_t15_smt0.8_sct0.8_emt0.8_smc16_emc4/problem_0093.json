Here, \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among the four triangles \\( AA_1D_1, BB_1A_1, CC_1B_1, DD_1C_1 \\), and \\( S_1 \\) is the area of quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the problem. Let me sketch a convex quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\). Points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) are on sides \\( AB, BC, CD, DA \\) respectively. Then, the four triangles mentioned are formed by connecting these points. The quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\) is inside \\( ABCD \\), and its area is \\( S_1 \\).\n\nMy goal is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( k S_1 \\geq S \\), where \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among those four triangles. So, no matter how we choose the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\), this inequality must hold.\n\nI think the key here is to use some sort of inequality or optimization principle. Maybe I can use areas ratios based on the positions of the points. Since the points are on the sides, perhaps I can express their positions using parameters like ratios of lengths. That might help in expressing the areas of the triangles in terms of those ratios.\n\nLet me consider parameterizing the positions of \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\). For each side, I can let the points divide the sides in some ratio. Let's denote \\( a \\) as the ratio \\( \\frac{BA_1}{AB} \\), similarly \\( b = \\frac{BC_1}{BC} \\), \\( c = \\frac{CD_1}{CD} \\), and \\( d"

It might also be useful to express these points in terms of affine parameters, maybe between 0 and 1, since they lie on the sides.\n\nBut before getting into that, perhaps it's better to consider specific cases. Maybe if I assume the quadrilateral is a parallelogram or a square, it might simplify the problem and give me some insight into the value of \\( k \\).\n\nLet me consider a square \\( ABCD \\) with side length 1. Let me place it in the coordinate system for easier calculations. Let \\( A = (0,0) \\), \\( B = (1,0) \\), \\( C = (1,1) \\), \\( D = (0,1) \\).

Triangle \\( AA_1D_1 \\): Points are \\( A(0,0) \\), \\( A_1(t,0) \\), \\( D_1(0, 1 - v) \\). Using the formula for area of a triangle with coordinates, the area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} | (t \\cdot (1 - v)) | \\) since the base and height can be considered along the axes.
