Maybe there was a previous part (a) that I need to consider. Since I don't have part (a), I'll have to think about what condition could lead to such a problem. Often in these kinds of problems, there's a condition that involves the sequence having consecutive terms that are consecutive integers or something similar. \n\nLet me think. If the question is about the product \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\), perhaps part (a) requires that consecutive terms differ by a specific amount, like 1. That would make the sequence consist of consecutive integers.
