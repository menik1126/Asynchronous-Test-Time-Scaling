We have a convex quadrilateral, which means all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) are on the respective sides. The problem involves areas of triangles formed by connecting these points in a certain way and the area of the inner quadrilateral formed by them.\n\nI think it might help to use barycentric coordinates or area ratios since the problem deals with areas and their ratios. Maybe I can assign variables to the positions of these points on the sides and express the areas in terms of these variables.\n\nLet me denote the positions of the points as follows:\n\n- Let \\( A_1 \\) divide \\( AB \\) in the ratio \\( t:1-t \\), so \\( AA_1 = t \\cdot AB \\) and \\( A_1B = (1-t) \\cdot AB \\).\n- Similarly, \\( B_1 \\) divides \\( BC \\) in the ratio \\( u:1-u \\).\n- \\( C_1 \\) divides \\( CD \\) in the ratio \\( v:1-v \\).\n- \\( D_1 \\) divides \\( DA \\) in the ratio \\( w:1-w \\).\n\nSince the quadrilateral is convex, all these points lie on the sides, so \\( t, u, v, w \\) are between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, let's denote the area of triangle \\( AA_1D_1 \\) as \\( S_A \\), the area of \\( BB_1A_1 \\) as \\( S_B"

Because the quadrilateral can be any convex quadrilateral, so perhaps the worst case (i.e., where \\( S / S_1 \\) is maximized) is when the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, or maybe when it's a square.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it's given for any convex quadrilateral, so we need a \\( k \\) that works for all of them. Therefore, the minimal \\( k \\) is the supremum (least upper bound) of \\( S / S_1 \\) over all possible convex quadrilaterals and points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\).\n\nSo, I need to compute \\( S \\) and \\( S_1 \\) in terms of the positions \\( t, u, v, w \\), and then find the maximal value of \\( S / S_1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use affine transformations to convert the quadrilateral into a square because affine transformations preserve ratios of areas. Since the problem is affine-invariant, perhaps I can without loss of generality assume that the quadrilateral is a square, and then find \\( k \\) accordingly.\n\nWait, is the problem affine-invariant? Let me think.\n\nThe area ratios should be preserved under affine transformations, so \\( S \\) and \\( S_1 \\) would scale by the determinant of the transformation. Therefore, the ratio \\( S / S_1 \\) would remain the same.
