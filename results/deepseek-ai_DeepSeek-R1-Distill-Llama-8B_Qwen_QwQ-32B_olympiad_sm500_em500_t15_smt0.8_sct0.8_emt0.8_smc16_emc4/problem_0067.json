I need to figure out the possible values of a_{2015} multiplied by a_{2016}. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what a_{2015} and a_{2016} are. Using the given formula:\n\na_{2015} = (2015)\u00b3 + b*(2015)\u00b2 + c*(2015) + d  \na_{2016} = (2016)\u00b3 + b*(2016)\u00b2 + c*(2016) + d\n\nSo, the product a_{2015} * a_{2016} would be the product of these two expressions. That seems a bit complicated because expanding both terms will lead to a lot of terms, especially since it's a cubic sequence. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this without getting bogged down in expanding everything.\n\nWait a minute, the problem mentions that this is a cubic sequence satisfying the condition from part (a). I don't have part (a) here, but since it's about a cubic sequence, maybe the condition is related to the sequence being equidistributed or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps part (a) refers to a condition that relates a_n and a_{n+1} in a specific way, maybe something to do with their consecutive differences or ratios.\n\nHold on, maybe part (a) is about the difference between consecutive terms? For a cubic sequence, the second difference is constant, right? Let me recall: for a quadratic sequence, the first difference is linear, and the second difference is constant. For a cubic sequence, the first difference is quadratic, the second difference is linear, and the third difference is constant. So, maybe the condition from part (a) is something about the third difference being constant or maybe some relationship between a_n and a_{n+1}.\n\nBut since I don't have part (a), I might need to make some assumptions or think differently. Alternatively, maybe part (a) requires that the sequence is a cubic polynomial with integer coefficients, which it already is because a_n = n\u00b3 + b n\u00b2 + c n + d, and b, c, d are integers. So, perhaps without part (a),"

Since b and c can be any integers, this product can be any integer, because you can choose b and c to adjust the terms. Wait, but that can't be, because even with varying b and c, the product is constrained by the structure of the cubic.\n\nWait, actually, if b, c, d are arbitrary integers, then the product a_{2015}*a_{2016} can indeed be any integer. Because for any integer k, you can choose coefficients such that the product equals k. For example, set b=c=0 and choose d such that a_{2015} = 1 and a_{2016}=k, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps you can set up equations to solve for b, c, d such that the product is any desired integer. Since there are three variables (b, c, d) and the product is a function of them, it's likely that the product can take any integer value. But the problem says \"possible values\", so maybe the answer is all integers? But that seems too broad, and the problem is likely expecting a specific answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe part (a) imposed a condition that restricts the coefficients such that the product is a perfect square or something. For example, if part (a) required that the cubic sequence is a perfect cube, then the product would be a perfect sixth power. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe part (a) required that the cubic sequence is such that a_{n} = a_{-n}, but as before, that would require the cubic to"

For example, a_{n} \u2261 n\u00b3 mod 1, which is trivial. Alternatively, if we consider modulo 2, a_{n} \u2261 n\u00b3 + b n\u00b2 + c n + d mod 2, but since we can choose b, c, d, the residues can be anything. So, perhaps the product a_{2015}*a_{2016} can be any integer.\n\nBut wait, from the initial problem statement, it says \"Determine the possible values...\", so maybe the possible values are all integers, but given that a_{2015} and a_{2016} are cubics, their product would also be a degree 6 polynomial, but the coefficients b, c, d can adjust the product to be any integer. Therefore, the possible values are all integers.\n\nBut the problem comes from part (b) after part (a), so perhaps part (a) was a condition that restricts the possible values. Since I don't have part (a), I can't be sure. So, perhaps the answer is that the possible values are all integers, or that the product is a perfect cube, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a multiple of some fixed number, but without part (a), I can't tell.\n\nWait, let me think again. If part (a) was that a_n is divisible by n for all n, then a_n = n*(n\u00b2 + b n + c). Then, a_{2015} = 2015*(2015\u00b2 + b*2015 + c)  \na_{2016} = 2016*(2016\u00b2 + b*2016 + c)  \nSo, their product is 2015*2016*(2015"

But since b and c can be chosen to make those terms anything, the product can be any integer divisible by 2015*2016. But even that might not be the case, because the terms in the parentheses are related through b and c. For example, if I set b and c such that (2015\u00b2 + b*2015 + c) = k and (2016\u00b2 + b*2016 + c) = m, then we can choose b and c to make k and m any integers, because it's a system of two equations with two variables.

Thus, for any integers k and m, there exist integers b and c that satisfy the equations. Therefore, the terms (2015\u00b2 + b*2015 + c) and (2016\u00b2 + b*2016 + c) can be any integers. Thus, the product a_{2015}*a_{2016} can be any integer multiple of 2015*2016, but since k and m can be any integers, the product can actually be any integer, because 2015*2016 is just a fixed integer, and the terms in the parentheses can cover all integers. Therefore, the product can be any integer.\n\nBut wait, can it? Because 2015*2016 is 2015*2016 = 2015*2016 = 2015*(2015+1) = 2015\u00b2 +2015, which is a large number, but since the product is 2015*2016*k*m, where k and m are any integers, then the possible values are all multiples of 2015*2016. But that's not correct because the terms k and m can be any integers, so the product can be any integer, because you can choose k and m to be any integers. For example, you can set k=1 and m=1, then the product is 2015*2016*1*1 = 2015*2016. Or set k=2 and m=1, then you get 2*2015*2016, etc. But can you get every integer as a multiple of 2015*2016? No, because 2015*2016 is a specific integer, so the product can only be multiples of it, but that's not possible either because k and m can be chosen to make any product.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. Suppose you fix k and m to be any integers, including zero and positive/negative, then the product 2015*2016*k*m can indeed be any integer because 2015*2016 is a constant, and k and m can be any integers, so their product can be any integer.

Hmm, no, that approach doesn't work. Alternatively, since 2015 and 2016 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so 2015*2016 is the least common multiple of 2015 and 2016. Therefore, to have a_{2015}*a_{2016} = x, x must be divisible by 2015*2016. Because a_{2015} =2015*(...) and a_{2016}=2016*(...), so their product is 2015*2016 times two other integers, so the product must be a multiple of 2015*2016.\n\nWait, but earlier when I assumed that k and m can be any integers, I thought that any integer can be achieved, but that's incorrect. Because 2015 and 2016 are coprime, the product 2015*2016 divides a_{2015}*a_{2016}. So, for any integer x, if x is divisible by 2015*2016, then it's possible. So the possible values are all integers divisible by 2015*2016.\n\nBut wait, let's think again with specific examples. Suppose I set k=1 and m=1, then the product is 2015*2016*1*1 = 2015*2016. If I set k=2 and m=1, then the product is 2015*2016*2*1=2*2015*2016. Similarly, if I set k=1 and m=2, same result. If I set k=3 and m=1, then 3*2015*2016. Now, can I get a product of, say, 1? That would require 2015*2016*k*m=1, which is impossible because 2015*2016 is larger than 1. So, no, you can't get 1. Similarly, any integer not divisible by 2015*2016 can't be obtained.
