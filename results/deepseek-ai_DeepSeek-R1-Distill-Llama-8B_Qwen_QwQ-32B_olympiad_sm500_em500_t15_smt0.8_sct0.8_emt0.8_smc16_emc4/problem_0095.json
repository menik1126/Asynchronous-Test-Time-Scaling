The problem involves a convex quadrilateral \\( ABCD \\) with points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) on the sides \\( AB, BC, CD, DA \\) respectively. Then, we consider the areas of four triangles: \\( AA_1D_1 \\), \\( BB_1A_1 \\), \\( CC_1B_1 \\), and \\( DD_1C_1 \\). The sum \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among these four, and \\( S_1 \\) is the area of the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\). The goal is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( kS_1 \\) is always greater than or equal to \\( S \\).\n\nHmm, okay, let me try to visualize this. I have a convex quadrilateral, so all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) are somewhere along the sides. The areas of these four triangles depend on where these points are placed. The problem states that no matter how these points are chosen, the sum \\( S \\) (of the two smallest areas) will be less than or equal to \\( kS_1 \\) multiplied by the area of \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\).\n\nWait, actually, more precisely, \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among those four triangles, and \\( S_1 \\) is the area of the quadrilateral formed by connecting these points. So the inequality \\( kS_1 \\geq S \\) must hold for all possible configurations of \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( k \\) such that this holds is the one where \\( kS_1 - S \\geq 0 \\) for all configurations, and \\( k \\) is as small as possible.\n\nI think the key here is to find a lower bound for \\( S \\) in terms of \\( S_1 \\). So maybe I can find some relation or inequality that relates the"

Each of these triangles is formed by connecting a vertex of the quadrilateral to two points on adjacent sides. For instance, \\( AA_1D_1 \\) is formed by vertex \\( A \\) and points \\( A_1 \\) on \\( AB \\) and \\( D_1 \\) on \\( DA \\).\n\nI remember that in similar problems, sometimes barycentric coordinates or mass point geometry can be useful, but I'm not sure here. Maybe I can express the areas in terms of the ratios of the segments.\n\nLet me denote the position of each point with a parameter. For example, for point \\( A_1 \\) on \\( AB \\), let \\( t \\) be the ratio such that \\( AA_1 = t \\cdot AB \\), where \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq 1 \\). Similarly, I can define other ratios for \\( B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) with parameters \\( u, v, w \\).\n\nWait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since the problem is symmetric with respect to all four sides, perhaps the worst case scenario (i.e., when \\( S \\) is maximized relative to \\( S_1 \\)) occurs when the points are placed in a symmetric way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the quadrilateral as a parallelogram or a square, as those are the most symmetric convex quadrilaterals, and perhaps in that case, the problem becomes easier.\n\nLet me assume that \\( ABCD \\) is a square. Then, due to symmetry, I might be able to relate the areas more easily. Let me set \\( A(0,0) \\), \\( B(1,0) \\), \\( C(1,1) \\), \\( D(0,1) \\).
