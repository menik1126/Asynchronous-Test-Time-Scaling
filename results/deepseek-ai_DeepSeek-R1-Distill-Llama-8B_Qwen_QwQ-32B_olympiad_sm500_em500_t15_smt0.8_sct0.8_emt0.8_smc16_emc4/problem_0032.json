Let me try to break it down and see if I can understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: Determine all positive integers \\( n \\) such that for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\), and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) satisfying the equation:\n\n\\[\nP(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})\n\\]\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) for which the above condition holds for any monic polynomial \\( P \\) with integer coefficients and degree at most \\( n \\). So, regardless of what \\( P \\) we pick (as long as it's monic and has integer coefficients), we must be able to find such integers \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) for some \\( k \\leq n \\) that satisfy the given equation.\n\nHmm, okay. So, maybe starting with small values of \\( n \\) would be a good idea. Let me try \\( n = 1 \\), \\( n = 2 \\), and so on, and see if I can find a pattern.\n\n**Case 1: \\( n = 1 \\)**\n\nIf \\( P \\) is a monic polynomial of degree at most 1 with integer coefficients, then \\( P(x) \\) is either linear or constant. Since it's monic, the linear term has coefficient 1. So, \\( P(x) = x + c \\) where \\( c \\) is an integer (if degree 1) or \\( P(x) = c \\) (if degree 0).\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\n- **Degree 0:** \\( P(x) = c \\), a constant. Then the equation becomes \\( c + c = c \\), which is \\( 2c = c \\), implying \\( c = 0 \\). But since \\( P \\) must be monic, and the constant polynomial is monic only if the coefficient"
