Here, \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are integer constants, and \\( n \\) can be any integer, including negative ones. The question is asking me to determine the possible values of \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\) for such a cubic sequence.\n\nFirst off, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. A cubic sequence is just a polynomial sequence where each term is a cubic function of \\( n \\). So, \\( a_n \\) is a cubic polynomial in \\( n \\). The constants \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are integers, which is important because the sequence consists of integers. That should help in figuring out possible values because we can use integer properties.\n\nThe problem is asking about \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\). That means I need to compute the product of the 2015th term and the 2016th term of this sequence. To do this, I might need to find expressions for \\( a_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} \\) in terms of \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\), multiply them together, and then see what possible values this product can take given the constraints on the constants.\n\nBut before jumping into that, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Sometimes, in these sequence problems, looking for patterns or using differences can help simplify things. Since we're dealing with cubic sequences, maybe there's a recursive relationship or some identity that can relate \\( a_n \\) and \\( a_{n+1} \\) in a way that makes the product easier to compute.\n\nLet me write down \\( a_n \\) again:\n\n\\( a_n = n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d \\).\n\nSo, \\( a_{2015} = 2015^3 + b \\cdot 2015^2 + c \\cdot 2015 + d \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( a_{2016} = 2016^3 + b \\cdot 2016^2 + c \\cdot 2016 + d \\).\n\nTo find \\( a_{2015} \\"
