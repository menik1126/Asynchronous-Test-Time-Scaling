The key property is that for all integers \\( n \\geq 15 \\) and for each subset \\( A_i \\), there must exist two distinct elements whose sum is \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay, let me try to unpack this. So, I need to partition all positive integers into \\( k \\) subsets. Each subset must be such that for every number \\( n \\) starting from 15 upwards, there are two distinct numbers in the subset that add up to \\( n \\). My goal is to find the largest possible \\( k \\).\n\nFirst, I should consider what this means. If I have more subsets, each subset will have fewer numbers. Since the condition requires that for each \\( n \\geq 15 \\), every subset must contain at least one pair that sums to \\( n \\), it's a pretty strict condition. The challenge is to figure out how many subsets we can have while still satisfying this condition.\n\nMaybe I should start by thinking about the minimal requirements. For each subset \\( A_i \\), it needs to have enough numbers so that every \\( n \\geq 15 \\) can be expressed as a sum of two distinct elements from \\( A_i \\).\n\nLet me consider the possible structure of these subsets. If I can ensure that each subset contains a sufficient number of consecutive integers or numbers that are spaced out in a way that their sums cover all \\( n \\geq 15 \\), then that might work.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any partition, not necessarily consecutive numbers. So maybe it's about the density of numbers in each subset.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I can model this after the concept of arithmetic progressions. If each subset is structured in a certain way, maybe their sums can cover all the required \\( n \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of graph theory. If I consider each positive integer as a vertex, and connect two vertices with an edge if their sum is \\( n \\geq 15 \\). Then partitioning the set of positive integers into subsets such that each subset is a clique in this graph. But wait, no, that's not quite right because the requirement is that for each \\( n \\ge"

Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of each subset as needing to be a basis for the integers starting at 15. A basis of order 2, but with the added condition that it's partitioned into multiple bases.\n\nWait, in additive number theory, a basis of order 2 is a set of numbers such that every sufficiently large integer can be expressed as the sum of two elements from the set. Here, the problem is similar but each subset must individually be a basis for all \\( n \\geq 15 \\), and the entire set is partitioned into such subsets. So the question is, what's the maximum number of such subsets?\n\nSo, the problem reduces to partitioning the natural numbers into as many subsets as possible, each of which is a basis of order 2 for the integers \\( \\geq 15 \\).\n\nI recall that the minimal size of a basis of order 2 is known, but here we need the maximal number of disjoint bases. Since each basis must cover all numbers from 15 onwards, the more subsets we have, the sparser each subset can be, but they still need to cover all the required sums.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a standard result here. Wait, perhaps the answer is 2? But I need to think through.\n\nAlternatively, let me try small cases. Let me see if k=2 is possible, then see if higher k is possible.\n\nSuppose k=2. Let me try to partition the integers into two subsets A and B such that each can form all n >=15 as a sum of two distinct elements.\n\nHow could I do that?\n\nOne possible way is to split numbers into even and odd. Let's see:\n\nIf A is all even numbers, B is all odd numbers.\n\nCheck for A: The sum of two even numbers is even. So for even n >=15, A can form them. But for odd n >=15, A cannot. So that's bad.\n\nSimilarly, B: sum of two odds is even, so same problem. So that partition doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so splitting into even and odd is not good.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe partition numbers into residue classes mod 3 or something else.\n\nSuppose mod 3.

We need each n >=15 to be expressed as a sum of two numbers, each from a different subset. Wait, no, actually each n must be the sum of two numbers from each subset.\n\nSo, each subset must individually have a pair that sums to n.\n\nSo, for example, subset A1 must have two numbers that add up to 15, 16, 17, etc.\n\nSimilarly for A2, A3, ..., Ak.\n\nSo, each subset has to contribute at least one pair for each n >=15.\n\nBut since the subsets are disjoint, the same number cannot be used in multiple subsets.\n\nTherefore, the problem requires that for each n >=15, and for each subset, there's a pair in that subset that sums to n.\n\nGiven that, how can I maximize the number of subsets?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I use the concept of partition regularity.

Therefore, this partition doesn't satisfy the condition because, for n=15, it's not in A1's residue class, so A1 cannot form it. So this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better partitioning method is needed.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe partition the numbers into two subsets where one subset is the even numbers and the other is the odd numbers. But as I thought before, the even subset can only form even sums, and the odd subset can only form even sums as well, since odd+odd=even and even+even=even. So that's no good because numbers like 15, which is odd, cannot be formed by even numbers.

Let me try to construct such subsets.\n\nSuppose we start with the first subset A1. To satisfy the condition for n=15, A1 must contain two numbers that add to 15. Let's say 1 and 14. Then for n=16, A1 needs two numbers adding to 16, say 2 and 14 (but 14 is already used). Wait, but they can be different pairs. Alternatively, 3 and 13. But then, each time, we have to make sure that for each n, there's a pair in A1.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe a better way is to think of each subset as containing an arithmetic progression with a certain difference.\n\nWait, for example, if a subset is an arithmetic progression with difference d, then the possible sums would also form an arithmetic progression. Let me see.\n\nSuppose A is an arithmetic progression starting at a with difference d. Then the elements are a, a+d, a+2d, etc. The sums of two elements would be 2a + kd for various k. So the sums form another arithmetic progression with difference 2d.
