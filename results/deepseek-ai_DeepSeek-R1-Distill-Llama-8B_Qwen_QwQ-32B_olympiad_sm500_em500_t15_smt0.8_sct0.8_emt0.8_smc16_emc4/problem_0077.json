The question is about a cubic sequence defined by \\( a_n = n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d \\), where \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are integer constants. The task is to determine the possible values of \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\) for such a cubic sequence.\n\nHmm, okay, first things first, I should make sure I understand what a cubic sequence is. It's a sequence where each term is a cubic polynomial in \\( n \\). So for any integer \\( n \\), \\( a_n \\) is just \\( n^3 \\) plus some quadratic, linear, and constant terms. Got it.\n\nThe problem mentions part (a), but since it's not provided here, maybe it's from a previous question or a condition that was given earlier. Since I don't have part (a), I have to assume what the condition might be. Often, in problems like this, part (a) might involve some initial conditions or specific terms of the sequence. Perhaps it asks for something like \\( a_0 \\), \\( a_1 \\), \\( a_2 \\) or relates consecutive terms? Or maybe it's about the differences between terms? Hmm. Wait, let me think.\n\nIf part (a) isn't provided here, perhaps it relates to the differences between terms, like in a recursive sequence. But cubic sequences can be a bit tricky because their differences aren't linear. Wait, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, part (a) could involve the use of finite differences. For a cubic sequence, the third difference is constant. So if part (a) talks about finite differences, that could be key. Let me try to recall.\n\nWait, actually, without part (a), maybe I should make an assumption or see if the problem can be solved with the given information. But it's unclear. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe part (a) is about something like the sequence being a cubic polynomial, so perhaps it mentions that it's a cubic sequence, which is given. So maybe part (a) relates to the coefficients \\( b \\), \\( c \\), \\( d \\) in some way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about the product \\( a_n \\cdot a_{n+1} \\) for some \\( n \\), in this case, \\( n = "
