Hmm, that's quite a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. I need to find all n where this condition holds. That is, no matter what monic polynomial P of degree \u2264 n with integer coefficients I pick, I can always find some k (between 1 and n) and k+1 distinct integers where the sum of P evaluated at the first k integers equals P evaluated at the (k+1)th integer.\n\nSince the polynomial is monic, that means the leading coefficient is 1. So for a degree d polynomial, it looks like x^d + a_{d-1}x^{d-1} + ... + a\u2080, where the a's are integers.\n\nI think a good starting point is to consider small values of n and see what happens. Maybe n=1, n=2, n=3, and see if the condition holds or fails, which might give me a pattern or the solution.\n\nLet's start with n=1.\n\n**Case n=1:**\n\nHere, the polynomial P is linear, so P(x) = x + c, where c is an integer because the coefficients are integers. Wait, actually, a monic polynomial of degree 1 is x + c, right? Or more generally, P(x) = x + c, where c is an integer constant.\n\nBut wait, I think I need to correct myself. A monic polynomial of degree d has leading coefficient 1, so for d=1, it's x + a\u2080, where a\u2080 is an integer. So P(x) = x + a\u2080.\n\nNow, I need to find a k \u2264 1, so k can only be 1, and k+1=2 distinct integers x\u2081, x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). Wait, because k is 1, so sum from i=1 to 1 of P(x_i) equals P(x_{"

Because k=1, so sum from i=1 to 1 of P(x_i) equals P(x_{2})).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's P(x\u2081) + ... + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1}).\n\nSo for k=1, that is P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). So I need two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082).\n\nBut wait, P(x) = x + a\u2080, so P(x\u2081) = x\u2081 + a\u2080 and P(x\u2082) = x\u2082 + a\u2080. So setting them equal, x\u2081 + a\u2080 = x\u2082 + a\u2080 implies x\u2081 = x\u2082, but x\u2081 and x\u2082 have to be distinct. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, that seems like a problem. So for n=1, the condition fails because for any a\u2080, P(x) = x + a\u2080, there are no two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 with P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). Because P is linear and injective over integers, meaning that if x\u2081 \u2260 x\u2082, then P(x\u2081) \u2260 P(x\u2082).\n\nWait a second, but if k=1, then we have to find two distinct integers where P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). But if P is injective, which it is for linear functions with integer coefficients, then that's impossible. So for n=1, the condition fails.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. For n=1, we can have k from 1 to 1, so k=1. Then, we need x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). But for a linear polynomial, that only happens when x\u2081 = x\u2082, which can't be since they must be distinct. So indeed, n=1 doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think again. Maybe I'm misapplying the condition. Let me verify.\n\nWait, the problem states that for every monic polynomial P of degree at most n, there exists a positive integer k \u2264 n and k+1 distinct integers x\u2081,...,x_{k+1} such that the sum of P(x\u2081),...,P"

But as I saw, that's impossible because P is injective over integers. So n=1 is out.\n\nWait, perhaps for higher k? Wait, no, because for n=1, we're only allowed to take k \u2264 1, so k=1. So n=1 doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake because maybe for k=2, but wait, n=1 can only take k=1 because k is up to n. So n=1 cannot satisfy the condition because for any linear polynomial, you cannot find two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 with P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). Hence, n=1 is excluded.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nSo for n=1, P is linear, so P(x) = x + c, right? So P(x\u2081) = x\u2081 + c and P(x\u2082) = x\u2082 + c.\n\nIf P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082), then x\u2081 + c = x\u2082 + c, so x\u2081 = x\u2082, but x\u2081 and x\u2082 must be distinct, so there is no solution. Hence, for n=1, the condition fails.\n\nSo n=1 is not a solution.\n\n**Case n=2:**\n\nNow, let's consider n=2. So the polynomial P is of degree at most 2, so it's quadratic or linear.\n\nWait, but for n=2, k can be 1 or 2.\n\nSo for each quadratic or linear monic polynomial P with integer coefficients, we can choose k=1 or k=2 and find the required integers.\n\nLet me first think about whether this condition holds for n=2.\n\nFirst, let's check if it's possible for any quadratic monic polynomial. Let's suppose P(x) is quadratic, so P(x) = x\u00b2 + a x + b, where a and b are integers.\n\nNow, we need to find k=1 or 2 and the corresponding x's.\n\nLet's try k=1 first. Then, as before, we'd need two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x"

So for x\u2081 and x\u2082 equidistant from the vertex but on opposite sides. However, their images under P would be equal. Wait, but since the coefficients are integers, maybe this can be arranged.\n\nWait, for instance, suppose P(x) = x\u00b2 + a x + b. Let me pick an example where I can compute this.\n\nTake P(x) = x\u00b2. Then, let me see: can I find x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that x\u2081\u00b2 = x\u2082\u00b2? Yes, like x\u2081 = 1 and x\u2082 = -1. So then, with k=1, that would satisfy P(1) = P(-1) = 1. So x\u2081=1, x\u2082=-1, so two distinct integers. So in this case, it works.\n\nSimilarly, for general P(x) = x\u00b2 + a x + b, can we find two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082)?\n\nLet me set P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082):\n\nx\u2081\u00b2 + a x\u2081 + b = x\u2082\u00b2 + a x\u2082 + b\n\nSimplify: x\u2081\u00b2 - x\u2082\u00b2 + a(x\u2081 - x\u2082) = 0\n\nFactor: (x\u2081 - x\u2082)(x\u2081 + x\u2082) + a(x\u2081 - x\u2082) = 0\n\nFactor out (x\u2081 - x\u2082):\n\n(x\u2081 - x\u2082)(x\u2081 + x\u2082 + a) = 0\n\nSince x\u2081 \u2260 x\u2082, then (x\u2081 - x\u2082) \u2260 0, so we must have x\u2081 + x\u2082 + a = 0.\n\nTherefore, x\u2082 = -x\u2081 - a.\n\nTherefore, for any x\u2081, if we set x\u2082 = -x\u2081 - a, then P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). So as long as x\u2081 and x\u2082 are distinct, which requires that x\u2081 \u2260 -x\u2081 - a, i.e., 2x\u2081 + a \u2260 0.

So if a is even, then x\u2082 = -x\u2081 - a is equal to x\u2081 only when x\u2081 = -a/2. Otherwise, x\u2081 and x\u2082 are distinct.\n\nWait, but for any integer x\u2081, except when x\u2081 = -a/2, x\u2082 is -x\u2081 - a, which is another integer. So except in the case where a is even and x\u2081 = -a/2, you can find two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082).\n\nWait, but if a is even, say a = 2m, then x = -a/2 = -m is an integer. So for x\u2081 = -m, x\u2082 = -(-m) - 2m = m - 2m = -m. So then x\u2081 = x\u2082 = -m.

But wait, but if a is even, then yes, you can still choose other x\u2081's. For example, if a is 2m, then choosing x\u2081 = 0, then x\u2082 = -0 - 2m = -2m, so P(0) = 0 + 0 + b = b, and P(-2m) = ( -2m )\u00b2 + 2m*(-2m) + b = 4m\u00b2 - 4m\u00b2 + b = b.

So yes, that's a valid solution. So for P(x)=x\u00b3, with k=2, we can have x\u2081=1, x\u2082=-1, x\u2083=0. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, another example: 8 + (-1) =7? Wait, 2\u00b3 + (-3)^3 =8 -27 =-19, which is not a cube. Hmm, but maybe other combinations.\n\nWait, but the first example works. So for P(x)=x\u00b3, there exists such a triplet. So k=2 works here.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if k=3 works. Then, need four distinct integers x\u2081,x\u2082,x\u2083,x\u2084 such that P(x\u2081)+P(x\u2082)+P(x\u2083)=P(x"

Hmm, that might be possible too, but the question is whether for every cubic polynomial, such k exists.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is that for any P, it's possible to find k=2 or k=3. Let me check another cubic polynomial to see.\n\nLet me take P(x)=x\u00b3 + x\u00b2. Let me see if I can find k=2 and three distinct integers such that x\u2081\u00b3 +x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2082\u00b3 +x\u2082\u00b2 =x\u2084\u00b3 +x\u2084\u00b2.\n\nHmm, this seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can look for k=2 with small integers.\n\nLet me try x\u2081=0: Then P(0)=0 +0=0.\n\nThen, set x\u2082=1: P(1)=1 +1=2.\n\nSo P(0)+P(1) =0 +2=2. So I need x\u2084 such that P(x\u2084)=2.\n\nSo x\u2084\u00b3 +x\u2084\u00b2 =2.\n\nLooking for integer solutions. Let's try x=1: 1 +1=2, so x=1 works. But then x\u2084=1. So the triplet would be x\u2081=0, x\u2082=1, x\u2084=1. But x\u2084=1 is not distinct from x\u2082=1. So that's not allowed.\n\nHmm, maybe try x\u2081=0, x\u2082= -1.\n\nP(0)=0, P(-1)=(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 =-1 +1=0.\n\nSo P(0)+P(-1)=0+0=0.

Wait, but wait, a monic polynomial of degree at most 3 must have leading term x\u00b3 or lower. But a constant polynomial would require degree 0, which would only be if the polynomial is constant, but monic constant polynomial is 1, so P(x)=1.\n\nWait, for P(x)=1, we need sum from i=1 tok of 1 = 1.\n\nSo for example, k=1: 1=1, but x\u2082 must be different from x\u2081. But since P(x)=1 for any x, maybe we can pick x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081)=P(x\u2082)=1, and then sum from i=1 tok=1 would be 1=1=P(x\u2082). So in that case, x\u2081 and x\u2082 must be distinct but P(x) is the same, which for P(x)=1, is always true.\n\nSo, for P(x)=1, we can pick x\u2081=0, x\u2082=1, so P(0)=1, P(1)=1, then P(0)=1=1=P(1). So that works with k=1, which gives 1=1.\n\nWait, but wait, for k=1, we need P(x\u2081)=P(x_{2}), and x's are distinct. So if P is constant, then P(x) is same for all x. So for any two distinct x's, P(x\u2081)=P(x\u2082). So, for a constant polynomial, k=1 works because you can take any two distinct x's and set x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that"
