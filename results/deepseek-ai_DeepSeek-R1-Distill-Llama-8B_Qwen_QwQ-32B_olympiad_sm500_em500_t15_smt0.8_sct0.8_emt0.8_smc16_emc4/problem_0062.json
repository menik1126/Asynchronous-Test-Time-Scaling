Then, y\u2099 is defined as 2^{x\u2099} - 1. We need to find the largest possible k such that for some a, y\u2081 through y_k are all prime.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's start by understanding the sequence. If x\u2081 = a, then x\u2082 = 2a + 1, x\u2083 = 2*(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3, and so on. So each term is doubling the previous term and adding 1. That seems like it's growing exponentially.\n\nNow, y\u2099 is 2^{x\u2099} - 1. So y\u2081 = 2^a - 1, y\u2082 = 2^{2a + 1} - 1, y\u2083 = 2^{4a + 3} - 1, etc. These are all Mersenne numbers, right? Mersenne primes are primes of the form 2^p - 1 where p itself is prime. But in this case, a can be any positive integer, not necessarily prime, so maybe some of the y\u2099s could still be prime even if a isn't prime.\n\nThe question is asking for the largest k such that for some a, y\u2081 to y_k are all prime. So, we need to find the maximum number of consecutive Mersenne primes starting from some a. Interesting.\n\nLet me try to compute y\u2081, y\u2082, y\u2083, etc., for small a and see if they are prime. Maybe I can spot a pattern or find a limit.\n\nLet's start with a = 1.\n\na = 1:\nx\u2081 = 1\ny\u2081 = 2^1 - 1 = 1. Hmm, 1 is not prime.

Then y2=2^{2*127 +1} -1 = 2^{255}-1. 255 is 3*5*17, so 2^{255}-1 is divisible by 2^3 -1=7, so composite. So, y2 is composite.\n\nThus, even with a=127, k=1.\n\nHmm, so no improvement.\n\nAlternatively, a= 89:\n\ny1=2^{89}-1, which is a Mersenne prime. Then y2=2^{179}-1. 179 is a prime exponent? Let me check if 2^{179}-1 is prime. I don't know, but 179 is a prime number, so it could be a Mersenne prime. Wait, but I think M179 is not known to be prime. Let me recall.\n\nWait, the known Mersenne primes up to exponent"

Therefore, y2 is composite.\n\nSo, even with a=89, y1 is prime, y2 is composite.\n\nWait, but from what I see, the maximum number of consecutive primes is two, achieved by a=2 and a=3.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible k is 2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose a= some number where y1=2^a -1 is prime, and y2=2^{2a+1}-1 is prime, but 2a+1 is also a Mersenne exponent, but in that case, since 2a+1 can be even or odd.\n\nWait, no, 2a +1 is always odd, since a is integer. So, 2a +1 would just be an odd exponent.\n\nBut I think in all the cases where a is such that y1 is prime, y2 is prime only for a=2 and a=3, but for higher a, y2 becomes composite.\n\nSo, it's likely that the maximum k is 2.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves determining the largest possible \\( k \\) such that for some positive integer \\( a \\), the numbers \\( y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k \\) are all prime.
