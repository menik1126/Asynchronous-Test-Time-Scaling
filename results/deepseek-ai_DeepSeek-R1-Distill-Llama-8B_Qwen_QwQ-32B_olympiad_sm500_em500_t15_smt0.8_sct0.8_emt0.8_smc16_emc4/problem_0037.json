So, the question is about finding all positive integers n such that for every monic polynomial P of degree at most n with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer k \u2264 n and k+1 distinct integers x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x_{k+1} satisfying the equation:\n\nP(x\u2081) + P(x\u2082) + ... + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1}).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We have to determine for which n, no matter what monic polynomial with integer coefficients you choose (of degree up to n), you can always find such k and the integers x_i that make the equation hold. So, it's a condition that must hold for all possible P's of that degree.\n\nLet me start by considering small values of n to see if I can spot a pattern or get some intuition.\n\nCase 1: n = 1\n\nIf n = 1, then P is a linear polynomial. Monic linear polynomial with integer coefficients has the form P(x) = x + c, where c is an integer.\n\nWe need to find k \u2264 1, so k = 1, and k+1 = 2 distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) + P(x\u2082) = P(x\u2083). Wait, but k+1 is 2, so it should be x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) + P(x\u2082) = P(x_{k+1}), but wait, k is 1, so it's x\u2081, x\u2082, so x\u2081 and x\u2082, and then P(x\u2081) + P(x\u2082) = P(x\u2083). But wait, wait, the original statement says k+1 distinct integers x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x_{k+1}. So, when k = 1, we have 2 distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) + P(x\u2082) = P(x_{k+1}) = P(x_{2}).\n\nWait, no, wait: When k = 1, you have k+1 = 2, so you need two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 where P(x\u2081) + P(x\u2082) = P(x\u2081').

So, for P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082), that would require x\u2081 + c = x\u2082 + c, so x\u2081 = x\u2082. But the problem states that x\u2081, ..., x_{k+1} must be distinct. So, for k=1, we have k+1=2, so x\u2081 and x\u2082 must be distinct, but then P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082) would require x\u2081 = x\u2082, which is a contradiction. Therefore, for n=1, is the condition satisfied? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating k. Let's check for n=1. So, k must be \u22641, so k can be 1. So, the equation would be P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082), but since P is linear, P(x) = x + c, so we need x\u2081 + c = x\u2082 + c, so x\u2081 = x\u2082. But they have to be distinct, so that's impossible. Thus, for n=1, the condition doesn't hold because we cannot find such x\u2081 and x\u2082. Therefore, n=1 is not a solution. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps for n=1, the condition is automatically satisfied. Because the problem says \"for every monic polynomial P of degree at most n\". So maybe for n=1, since P is linear, maybe we can find k=1 and two distinct x's where P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). Wait, but as we saw, that requires x\u2081 = x\u2082, so it can't be done. Therefore, n=1 does not satisfy the condition.\n\nCase 2: n=2\n\nSo, P is a monic quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients. So P(x) = x\u00b2 + bx + c, where b and c are integers.\n\nWe need to find k \u2264 2, so k=1 and k=2.\n\nFirst, consider k=1. Then we need two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x"

So, either x\u2081 = x\u2082, which we don't want, or x\u2081 + x\u2082 + b = 0. So, if we can find x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that x\u2081 + x\u2082 = -b, then P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). So, for example, setting x\u2082 = -b - x\u2081, and then choosing x\u2081 as any integer, x\u2082 would be determined. For example, let x\u2081 = 0, then x\u2082 = -b. So, P(0) = 0\u00b2 + b*0 + c = c. Similarly, P(-b) = (-b)^2 + b*(-b) + c = b\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c = c. So, P(0) = P(-b) = c. Therefore, for k=1, we can have x\u2081 = 0 and x\u2082 = -b, and then P(x\u2081) + ... + P(x_k) = P(x\u2081) = c, and P(x_{k+1}) = P(x\u2082) = c, so indeed, c = c. Therefore, for k=1, it works because we can choose x\u2081=0 and x\u2082=-b, which are distinct as long as b \u2260 0. Wait, but if b=0, then x\u2081 = 0 and x\u2082 = 0, which are not distinct. So, in that case, we might need to pick another pair.\n\nWait, if P(x) = x\u00b2 + c, so b=0. Then P(x\u2081) = c for any x\u2081. So, suppose we pick x\u2081 = 1 and x\u2082 = 2, then P(1) + P(2) = c + c = 2c. We need to find x\u2083 such that P(x\u2083) = 2c. But P(x) = x\u00b2 + c, so x\u00b2 + c = 2c => x\u00b2 = c. So, if c is a perfect square, then x = sqrt(c) and x = -sqrt(c). But if c is not a perfect square, then we might not have integer solutions. So, wait, but the problem states"

But wait, are x\u2081=0, x\u2082=1, and x\u2083=-1 distinct? Yes, 0, 1, -1 are all distinct. So, P(0) + P(1) = 1 + (0 + 1) = 2, and P(-1)= (-1)^2 + 1 = 2, so indeed, 1 + 1 = 2. So, in this case, it works. So, k=2, and x\u2081=0, x\u2082=1, x\u2083=-1.\n\nWait, but that seems to work for c=1 as well. So, maybe for any c, we can find such x's. Let me see.\n\nIf I set x\u2081=1, x\u2082=2, then P(1) + P(2) = (1 + c) + (4 + c) = 5 + 2c. We need x\u2083 such that P(x\u2083) = 5 + 2c, so x\u2083\u00b2 + c = 5 + 2c => x\u2083\u00b2 = 5 + c.

So, then we need x\u2083 such that P(x\u2083) = 2c. So, x\u2083\u00b2 + c = 2c => x\u2083\u00b2 = c. Therefore, if c is a perfect square, say c = m\u00b2, then x\u2083 = m or x\u2083 = -m. So, if c is a square, then we can set x\u2083 = m. Then, the integers are x\u2081=0, x\u2082=1, x\u2083=m, provided m is not 0 or 1 or -1, to ensure they're distinct.

So, for any c, can we find such a triple?\n\nWait, but in my example above with c=5, I was unable to find such x's. Wait, but maybe I can find another triple.\n\nWait, perhaps x\u2081=5, x\u2082=12, then x\u2081\u00b2=25, x\u2082\u00b2=144, sum=169=13\u00b2. So, then, x\u2083=13.\n\nThus, P(5)=25 +5=30, P(12)=144 +5=149, sum=30 +149=179. So, P(13)=169 +5=174. 179 \u2260174, so that doesn't work. Wait, that's not correct because 25 + 144 =169, so x\u2083=13, so P(5)+P(12)=30 +149=179, but P(13)=174, so 179 \u2260174.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in this case, it doesn't work because even though x\u2081\u00b2 + x\u2082\u00b2 = x\u2083\u00b2, when you add P(x\u2081) + P(x\u2082), you get (x\u2081\u00b2 + c) + (x\u2082\u00b2 + c) = (x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2082\u00b2) + 2c = x\u2083\u00b2 + 2c, while P(x\u2083) is x\u2083\u00b2 + c. So, unless x\u2083\u00b2 +2c =x\u2083\u00b2 +c, which would require c=0, which is not the case. Therefore, my earlier approach is flawed because I thought that x\u2081\u00b2 +x\u2082\u00b2 =x\u2083\u00b2 would imply that P(x\u2081)+P(x\u2082)=P(x\u2083), but in reality, it doesn't because of the added constants. So, I made a mistake"

Alternatively, maybe the condition fails for n=3 because some polynomials might not allow such representations.\n\nBut I'm not finding a clear counterexample yet. Alternatively, perhaps n=2 is the maximum, and n=3 doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but wait, let's think of a specific polynomial where it's impossible.\n\nConsider P(x) =x\u00b3 + x.\n\nWe need to find k \u22643 and k+1 distinct integers such that the sum of k terms equals another term.\n\nLet's try k=2:\n\nP(x\u2081) + P(x\u2082) = x\u2081\u00b3 +x\u2081 +x\u2082\u00b3 +x\u2082 = (x\u2081\u00b3 +x\u2082\u00b3) + (x\u2081 +x\u2082) = P(x\u2083) =x\u2083\u00b3 +x\u2083.\n\nWe need x\u2081\u00b3 +x\u2082\u00b3 +x\u2081 +x\u2082 =x\u2083\u00b3 +x\u2083.\n\nLet me try small integers.\n\nLet x\u2081=0: P(0)=0 +0=0. So, need 0 + x\u2082\u00b3 +x\u2082 =x\u2083\u00b3 +x\u2083.\n\nSo, x\u2082\u00b3 +x\u2082 =x\u2083\u00b3 +x\u2083.\n\nWhich implies x\u2082\u00b3 +x\u2082 -x\u2083\u00b3 -x\u2083=0.\n\nThis can be written as (x\u2082 -x\u2083)(x\u2082\u00b2 +x\u2082 x\u2083 +x\u2083\u00b2) + (x\u2082 -x\u2083)=0.\n\nFactor out (x\u2082 -x\u2083):\n\n(x\u2082 -x\u2083)(x\u2082\u00b2 +x\u2082 x\u2083 +x\u2083\u00b2 +1)=0.\n\nSo, either x\u2082=x\u2083, which they can't be, or x\u2082\u00b2 +x\u2082 x\u2083 +x\u2083\u00b2 +1=0.\n\nBut since x\u2082 and x\u2083 are integers, squares are non-negative"
