Here's what I thought through:\n\nThe problem is about a sequence defined by starting with a positive integer \\( a \\), then each subsequent term is defined as \\( x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 \\). Then there's another sequence \\( y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1 \\). The goal is to find the largest possible \\( k \\) such that for some positive integer \\( a \\), the numbers \\( y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k \\) are all prime.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, let's understand how the sequences \\( x_n \\) and \\( y_n \\) behave.\n\nStarting with \\( x_1 = a \\), then:\n- \\( x_2 = 2a + 1 \\)\n- \\( x_3 = 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3 \\)\n- \\( x_4 = 2(4a + 3) + 1 = 8a + 7 \\)\n- And so on. It looks like each \\( x_n \\) is doubling the previous term and adding 1. So, in general, \\( x_n = 2^{n-1}a + (2^{n-1} - 1) \\). Let me check that formula with the initial terms:\n  - For \\( n=1 \\): \\( 2^{0}a + (2^{0} - 1) = a + 0 = a \\)\n  - For \\( n=2 \\): \\( 2^{1}a + (2^{1} - 1) = 2a + 1 \\)\n  - For \\( n=3 \\): \\( 2^{2}a + (2^{2} - 1) = 4a + 3 \\)\n  Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, \\( y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1 \\). Since we want \\( y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_k \\) to be primes, each of these must be prime numbers.\n\nOur task is to find the maximum possible \\( k \\) across all possible starting values \\( a \\) such that \\( y_1 \\"

So, as long as \\( a \\) is such that \\( 2^a - 1 \\) is prime. There are known Mersenne primes, which are primes of the form \\( 2^p - 1 \\). So, the maximum \\( a \\) for which \\( y_1 \\) is prime can be large, but for our purposes, since we're looking for the largest \\( k \\), maybe larger \\( k \\) would be more informative.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is to find the largest \\( k \\) such that for some \\( a \\), the first \\( k \\) terms \\( y_1 \\) to \\( y_k \\) are all prime. So, perhaps \\( k \\) is limited by the point where \\( y_k \\) becomes composite, regardless of how large \\( a \\) is.\n\nSo, let me try small starting values \\( a \\) and compute \\( y_1, y_2, \\ldots \\) to see when they stop being prime.\n\nLet me start with \\( a = 2 \\):\n- \\( x_1 = 2 \\)\n- \\( y_1 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \\) (prime)\n- \\( x_2 = 2*2 +1 = 5 \\)\n- \\( y_2 = 2^5 -1 = 32 - 1 = 31 \\) (prime)\n- \\( x_3 = 2*5 +1 = 11 \\)\n- \\( y_3 = 2^{11} -1 = 2048 -1 = 2047 \\). Now, is 2047 prime? I recall that 2047 is 23*89, so it's composite. So, with \\( a=2 \\), we get \\( y_1 \\) and \\( y_2 \\) prime, but \\( y_3 \\) isn't. So, for \\( a=2 \\), \\( k=2 \\).\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find the largest possible \\( k \\)"
