The sequence is defined as x\u2081 = a, and x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1. Then y_n is defined as 2^{x_n} - 1. \n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, x starts at a, and each subsequent term is twice the previous one plus one. So each x_n is built from doubling and adding one. Then y_n is 2 raised to that x_n minus one. So y_n is essentially a Mersenne number since it's of the form 2^p - 1 where p is prime, but in this case, x_n could be composite too, but the problem here is whether y_n is prime.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't say x_n has to be prime, just that y_n has to be prime. So x_n could be composite, but y_n is 2^x_n - 1. Now, I recall that for y_n to be prime, x_n itself must be prime, otherwise, 2^x_n - 1 might be composite. But wait, is that always true? Hmm, no. For example, if x_n is composite, say 4, then 2^4 - 1 is 15, which is composite. But sometimes a composite exponent can lead to a prime. Wait, no, I think more accurately, if x_n is composite, then 2^{x_n} - 1 is also composite. Because if x_n is composite, say x_n = ab, then 2^{ab} - 1 factors as (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + ... + 1). So yeah, if x_n is composite, y_n is definitely composite. So, for y_n to be prime, x_n must be prime.\n\nTherefore, both x_n and y_n must be primes. So, we can rephrase the problem as finding a starting a such that x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x_k are primes, and y\u2081, ..., y_k are primes. But since y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1, which is a M"

Given x\u2081 = a, which is a prime, since x\u2081 has to be a prime to get y\u2081 prime. Then x\u2082 = 2a + 1. For x\u2082 to be prime, 2a + 1 must be prime. Similarly, x\u2083 = 2x\u2082 + 1 = 2*(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3. For x\u2083 to be prime, 4a + 3 must be prime, and so on.\n\nSo, if I can find a starting prime a such that x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x_k are all primes, and also y\u2081 = 2^a - 1, y\u2082 = 2^{2a + 1} - 1, ..., y_k = 2^{x_k} - 1 are all primes. So, we're looking for a starting prime a and a k such that this holds.\n\nNow, to find the largest possible k, maybe I can try small k first and see if it's possible.\n\nLet me start with k=1. Then, y\u2081 = 2^a - 1 must be prime. So, a must be a prime such that 2^a - 1 is also prime. That is, a is a Mersenne prime exponent. The known Mersenne primes have exponents that are primes, but not all primes give Mersenne primes. So, a is a Mersenne prime exponent. The smallest ones are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, etc. So, a can be any of these, but we need to find a sequence where a is such that 2a + 1 is prime, and perhaps more terms. So maybe k=1 is too small; let's think of k=2.\n\nSo for k=2, we need y\u2081 and y\u2082 to be prime. So, a must be prime, 2a + 1 must be prime, and 2^a - 1 and 2^{2a + 1} - 1 must be primes.\n\nLet's try some small a.\n\nStart with a=2. Then x\u2081=2, which is prime. y\u2081="
