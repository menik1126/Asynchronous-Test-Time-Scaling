The question is asking about the possible values of a_{2015} multiplied by a_{2016}. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that a cubic sequence is a polynomial sequence where each term is a cubic function of n. So, the general form is given, which is pretty straightforward. The constants b, c, d are integers, so the coefficients are fixed. The variable n can be any integer, including negatives, which might be important later.\n\nNow, the problem is about finding a_{2015} * a_{2016}. That sounds like I need to compute each term separately and then multiply them, but given the exponents, maybe there's a smarter way to handle this without crunching all the numbers.\n\nLet me write down the expressions for a_{2015} and a_{2016}. So, substituting n = 2015 into the formula, a_{2015} = (2015)\u00b3 + b*(2015)\u00b2 + c*(2015) + d. Similarly, a_{2016} = (2016)\u00b3 + b*(2016)\u00b2 + c*(2016) + d.\n\nI need to compute the product of these two, which will be [ (2015)\u00b3 + b*(2015)\u00b2 + c*(2015) + d ] * [ (2016)\u00b3 + b*(2016)\u00b2 + c*(2016) + d ]. That looks complicated because it's a product of two cubics, but maybe there's some pattern or identity I can use here.\n\nWait, the question also mentions part (a). Hmm, I don't have the exact statement of part (a), but usually in these problems, part (a) might ask about properties of the sequence, like its behavior, differences, sums, or something else that can help here. Since part (a) isn't provided, I need to think if there's a standard result or property that could link a_{2015} and a_{2016}.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the difference between a_{2016} and a_{2015}. Let me compute that:\n\na_{2016} - a_{2015}"

Let me compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: 2016\u00b3 - 2015\u00b3. There's a formula for the difference of cubes: a\u00b3 - b\u00b3 = (a - b)(a\u00b2 + ab + b\u00b2). Here, a = 2016, b = 2015, so a - b = 1. Therefore, this term is 1*(2016\u00b2 + 2016*2015 + 2015\u00b2).\n\nSecond term: b*(2016\u00b2 - 2015\u00b2). Similarly, difference of squares: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). So, 2016\u00b2 - 2015\u00b2 = (2016 - 2015)(2016 + 2015) = 1*(4031). So this term is b*4031.\n\nThird term: c*(2016 - 2015) = c*1 = c.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\na_{2016} - a_{2015} = [2016\u00b2 + 2016*2015 + 2015\u00b2] + b*4031 + c.\n\nHmm, okay. But how does this help me with the product a_{2015}*a_{2016}? Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem in part (a) required that the sequence has some property, like being an arithmetic sequence or geometric sequence? Wait, but it's a cubic sequence, so it can't be arithmetic or geometric unless the cubic terms cancel out, which would require coefficients to be zero. But since it's a cubic sequence, the cubic term is present"

Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: cubic sequences can have integer terms for all integers n, so the coefficients b, c, d must be chosen such that the terms are integers. That might be related to part (a). Maybe in part (a), there was a condition that the sequence is strictly increasing or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to consider that the product a_n * a_{n+1} is a quadratic function in n, because multiplying two cubics gives a degree 6 polynomial, but perhaps it can be expressed in some form. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me compute a_n * a_{n+1}:\n\na_n = n\u00b3 + b n\u00b2 + c n + d\n\na_{n+1} = (n+1)\u00b3 + b(n+1)\u00b2 + c(n+1) + d\n\nLet me expand a_{n+1}:\n\n= n\u00b3 + 3n\u00b2 + 3n + 1 + b(n\u00b2 + 2n + 1) + c(n + 1) + d\n\n= n\u00b3 + (3 + b)n\u00b2 + (3 + 2b + c)n + (1 + b + c + d)\n\nSo, multiplying a_n * a_{n+1}:\n\n(n\u00b3 + b n\u00b2 + c n + d) * [n\u00b3 + (3 + b)n\u00b2 + (3 + 2b + c)n + (1 + b + c + d)]\n\nThis is going to be a bit messy, but let's try:\n\n= n\u00b3*(n\u00b3 + (3 + b)n\u00b2 + (3 + 2b + c)n + (1 + b + c + d)) + b n\u00b2*(... ) + c n*(...) + d*(...)\n\nBut this will result in a 6th-degree polynomial, which seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the identity that a_n * a_{n+1} is a perfect square. Wait, is that true? Let me check for a simple cubic function.\n\nSuppose a_n = n\u00b3. Then a_n * a_{n+1} = n\u00b3(n+1)\u00b3 = (n(n+1))\u00b3, which is a perfect square? No, wait, (n(n+1))\u00b3 is a cube"

Since part (a) isn't given, I need to think of possible standard conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps part (a) required that the cubic sequence has the property that a_{n+1} - a_n is a quadratic function, which it is, since the difference is a quadratic in n.

So maybe the possible values include zero and all other integers, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but if a_{2015}*a_{2016} can be any integer, then zero is included, because you can choose k=2015 or k=2016, making either a_{2015}=0 or a_{2016}=0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is always an integer, so possible values are all integers.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because for each cubic, the product is a fixed integer once b, c, d are fixed.
