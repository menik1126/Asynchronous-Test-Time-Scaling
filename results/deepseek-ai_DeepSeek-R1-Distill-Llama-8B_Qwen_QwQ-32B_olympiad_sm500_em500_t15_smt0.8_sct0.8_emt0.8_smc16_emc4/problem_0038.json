First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about polynomials with integer coefficients, specifically monic ones (meaning the leading coefficient is 1). The condition is that no matter which such polynomial I pick, I can always find some \\( k \\) (from 1 to \\( n \\)) and some distinct integers where the sum of \\( k \\) evaluations of the polynomial equals another evaluation.\n\nSo, essentially, for each polynomial, there exists a set of inputs where plugging them into \\( P \\) and adding \\( k \\) of them gives another single value of \\( P \\). Interesting.\n\nI guess I should start by testing small values of \\( n \\) to see if I can spot a pattern or figure out for which \\( n \\) this condition holds.\n\nLet's consider \\( n = 1 \\). So, \\( P \\) is a linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients, which looks like \\( P(x) = x + c \\), where \\( c \\) is an integer.\n\nI need to find \\( k \\leq 1 \\), so \\( k \\) can only be 1. Then, we need two distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). Wait, is that possible?\n\nBut \\( P(x) = x + c \\), so \\( P(x_1) = x_1 + c \\) and \\( P(x_2) = x_2 + c \\). Setting these equal gives \\( x_1 + c = x_2 + c \\implies x_1 = x_2 \\). But \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) must be distinct. So, can't have"

So, if for \\( n = 1 \\), the condition fails for some polynomials, then \\( n = 1 \\) is not a solution.\n\nWait a second, let me think again. If \\( k = 1 \\), we need one polynomial evaluation on the left and one on the right, but \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) have to be distinct, which would require \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) with \\( x_1 \\neq x_2 \\), but for a linear function, that's only possible if the function is constant. But \\( P \\) is monic, so unless it's degree 0 (which it's not, since it's monic of degree at most 1), it can't be constant. So, for \\( n = 1 \\), the condition fails. Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) is not a solution.\n\nWait, but \\( k \\) is 1, so we have \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) with \\( x_1 \\neq x_2 \\). For a linear polynomial, this is impossible. Therefore, the condition is not satisfied for \\( n = 1 \\), so \\( n = 1 \\) is out.\n\nNow, let's check \\( n = 2 \\). So, \\( P \\) is a quadratic monic polynomial with integer coefficients: \\( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nWe need to find \\( k \\leq 2 \\).

For a quadratic, the equation \\( x_1^2 + b x_1 + c = x_2^2 + b x_2 + c \\) simplifies to \\( x_1^2 - x_2^2 + b(x_1 - x_2) = 0 \\). Factoring"

So, we just need to find two integers that add up to \\( -b \\). Since \\( b \\) is an integer, this is doable, as for any integer \\( -b \\), we can choose \\( x_1 = t \\) and \\( x_2 = -b - t \\) for some integer \\( t \\).\n\nSo, for \\( k = 1 \\), we can find such integers. Hence, for \\( n = 2 \\), the condition is satisfied for any quadratic polynomial.

If k is 3, the left side is 6th degree or something, but the right is 3. That doesn't make sense, unless maybe k is 1 or 2.\n\nWait, no, wait: For each \\( P(x_i) \\), the degree is at most 3, so sum of k of them would be a polynomial of degree at most 3k. On the right, we have P(x_{k+1}), which is a degree at most 3.\n\nThus, unless k is 1 or 2, the left side will be of higher degree than the right, which would make the equation impossible because the leading terms can't cancel.\n\nWait, so for \\( k = 3 \\), the left side is degree at most 9, right side degree 3"

So, to have equality, we need \\( x_1^3 + x_2^3 + x_3^3 = x_4^3 \\). Which is exactly the equation we had before. So, if such integers exist, then it's possible. But for some polynomials, maybe even with lower degree terms, this can be arranged?\n\nWait, but in the problem, the coefficients are fixed for a given polynomial. So, for a general cubic polynomial, even if the leading terms can be matched, the lower degree terms might not.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a cubic polynomial \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\).
