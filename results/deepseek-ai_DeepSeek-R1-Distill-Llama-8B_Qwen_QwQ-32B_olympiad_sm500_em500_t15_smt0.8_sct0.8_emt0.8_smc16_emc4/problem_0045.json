Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. I need to find all \\( n \\) where every monic polynomial \\( P \\) (with integer coefficients) of degree up to \\( n \\) has some property related to this equation. The property is that there exists some \\( k \\) (from 1 to \\( n \\)) and a set of \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers such that the sum of \\( P \\) evaluated at the first \\( k \\) integers equals \\( P \\) evaluated at the last integer.\n\nSo, for each \\( n \\), I need to check whether this is true for all such polynomials. If that's the case, then \\( n \\) is a solution. Otherwise, if there's even one polynomial where this doesn't hold, then \\( n \\) isn't a solution.\n\nLet me start with small values of \\( n \\) and see if I can spot a pattern or come up with a general idea.\n\n**Case 1: \\( n = 1 \\)**\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), \\( P \\) is a monic polynomial of degree at most 1, so \\( P(x) = x + c \\) where \\( c \\) is an integer.\n\nWe need to find \\( k \\leq 1 \\), which can only be \\( k = 1 \\), and then have two distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nP(x_1) = P(x_2)\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( x_1 + c = x_2 + c \\implies x_1 = x_2 \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k"

This means that unless \\( x_1 = x_2 \\), \\( P(x_1) \\neq P(x_2) \\). However, \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) must be distinct, so \\( P(x_1) \\neq P(x_2) \\).

But since they need to be distinct, this is impossible. So, does that mean for \\( n = 1 \\), the condition fails?\n\nBut maybe I've made a mistake here. Let's check the problem again. It says \"there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\)\". So, for \\( n = 1 \\), only \\( k = 1 \\) is possible. But as we saw, it's impossible because \\( P(x_1) = x_1 + c \\) and \\( P(x_2) = x_2 + c \\), which are equal only if \\( x_1 = x_2 \\), which isn't allowed.\n\nWait, but that would mean that for \\( n = 1 \\), the condition isn't satisfied because there exists a polynomial (in fact, all polynomials of degree 1) where no such distinct integers exist. So, does \\( n = 1 \\) satisfy the condition? Or not? It seems like it doesn't.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Therefore, even though \\( k = 1 \\), it's satisfied.\n\nSo, in this case, yes, \\( k = 1 \\) works.\n\nWait, so in general, for quadratic polynomials, since they are symmetric around their vertex (if we ignore the linear and constant terms), it's possible to find two distinct integers symmetric around the vertex such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). For monic quadratics, the vertex is at \\( x = -b/(2a) \\), but since coefficients are integers, unless \\( b \\) is even, the vertex won't be at an integer.\n\nBut even if the vertex isn't at an integer, perhaps there are still integers symmetric around the vertex, so that their \\( P(x) \\) values are equal.\n\nWait, for example, suppose \\( b \\) is odd. Then, the vertex is at \\( x = -b/2 \\), which is a half-integer. So, for integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) symmetric around this half-integer, \\( x_1 - x_2 = 1 \\). Then, \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\).\n\nThus, even in that case, you can have such \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\).\n\nTherefore, for any quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients, there exist two distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). Therefore, for \\( n = 2 \\), \\( k = 1 \\) suffices.\n\nBut wait, is that always true? Let's see.\n\nSuppose \\( P(x) = x^2 + x + 0 \\). Then, can I find \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( x_1^2 + x_1 = x_2^2 + x_2 \\).\n\nWhich simplifies to \\( x_1^2 - x_2^2 + x_1 - x_2 = 0 \\implies (x_1 - x_2)(x_1 + x_2) + (x_1 - x_2) = 0"

Wait, actually, cubics are monotonic if their derivative doesn't change sign. But for a general cubic, the derivative is quadratic, so it may have two critical points, meaning the cubic can have a local maximum and minimum. Therefore, it's possible that for some \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\), \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\).\n\nHowever, unlike quadratics, the function isn't symmetric around a line, so it's not guaranteed that for every cubic, such \\( x_1, x_2 \\) exist.\n\nWait, actually, for a cubic function, it's injective if it's monotonic. If it's not monotonic, meaning it has a local maximum and minimum, then it might not be injective. So, it might take the same value at two different points.\n\nBut is it always"
