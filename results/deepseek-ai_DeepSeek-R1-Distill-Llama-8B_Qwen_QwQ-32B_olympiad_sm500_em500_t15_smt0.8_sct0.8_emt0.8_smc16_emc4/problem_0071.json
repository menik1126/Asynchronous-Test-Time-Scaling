The constants \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are integers, and \\( n \\) can be any integer, including negatives. The question is asking for the possible values of \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is referring to in part (a). It says \"satisfying the condition in part (a)\", but since I don't have the actual part (a), I might need to assume something. Maybe part (a) mentions a specific condition that the sequence must satisfy, like being a cubic polynomial with integer coefficients. Well, since \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are already integers, that part is already satisfied by the given formula. So perhaps part (a) relates to something else, but without more information, I'll proceed with the assumption that it's just about the cubic sequence as defined.\n\nSo, moving on, I need to find \\( a_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} \\), multiply them, and figure out what the possible values are. Since \\( a_n \\) is a cubic polynomial, maybe there's a clever way to express \\( a_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} \\) in a form that makes their product manageable. Let's think about that.\n\nLet me write down the expressions for \\( a_{2015} \\) and \\( a_{2016} \\):\n\n\\( a_{2015} = 2015^3 + b \\cdot 2015^2 + c \\cdot 2015 + d \\)\n\n\\( a_{2016} = 2016^3 + b \\cdot 2016^2 + c \\cdot 2016 + d \\)\n\nNow, the product \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\) will be:\n\n\\( (2015^3 + b \\cdot 2015^2 + c \\cdot 2015 + d) \\cdot (2016^3 + b \\cdot 2016^2 + c \\cdot 2016 + d) \\)\n\nThat looks pretty complicated.
