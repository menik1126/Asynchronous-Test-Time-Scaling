The sequence is defined as x\u2081 = a, and x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 for n \u2265 1. Then y_n is defined as 2^{x_n} - 1. \n\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. First, let me understand how the sequence x_n behaves. Starting with x\u2081 = a, each subsequent term is double the previous term plus one. So it's like a recursive sequence. Let me write out the first few terms:\n\nx\u2081 = a\n\nx\u2082 = 2x\u2081 + 1 = 2a + 1\n\nx\u2083 = 2x\u2082 + 1 = 2*(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 2 + 1 = 4a + 3\n\nx\u2084 = 2x\u2083 + 1 = 2*(4a + 3) + 1 = 8a + 6 + 1 = 8a + 7\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Each x_n is 2^{n-1} * a + (2^{n-1} - 1). Let me check that:\n\nFor n=1: 2^{0}*a + (2^{0} - 1) = a + (1 - 1) = a. Correct.\n\nn=2: 2^{1}*a + (2^{1} - 1) = 2a + 1. Correct.\n\nn=3: 2^{2}*a + (2^{2} - 1) = 4a + 3. Correct.\n\nn=4: 2^{3}*a + (2^{3} - 1) = 8a + 7. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems right. So in general, x_n = 2^{n-1}*(a) + (2^{n-1} - 1). Which can also be written as x_n = (2^{n-1}) * (a + 1) - 1. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, 2^{n-1}*a + (2^{n-1} - 1"

So y_n is a Mersenne number, because it's of the form 2^p - 1 where p is prime, but in this case, x_n can be any integer, not necessarily prime. \n\nBut wait, for y_n to be prime, 2^{x_n} - 1 must be prime. So that would mean that x_n must be a prime number because if 2^m - 1 is prime, then m must be prime. Otherwise, if m is composite, say m = ab, then 2^{ab} - 1 factors as (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + ... + 1), which means it's composite.\n\nSo for each y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1 to be prime, x_n must be prime. So that means for y\u2081, y\u2082, ..., y_k to be prime, each x_n must be prime.\n\nTherefore, not only does a have to be chosen such that x\u2081 is prime, but also x\u2082 must be prime, x\u2083 must be prime, and so on up to x_k must be prime.\n\nGiven that x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1, so each term is twice the previous term plus one.
