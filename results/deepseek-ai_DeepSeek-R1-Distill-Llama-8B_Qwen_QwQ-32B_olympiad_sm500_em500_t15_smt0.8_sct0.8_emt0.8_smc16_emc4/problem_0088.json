Here, \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest areas among the four triangles \\( AA_1D_1, BB_1A_1, CC_1B_1, DD_1C_1 \\), and \\( S_1 \\) is the area of the quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I need to understand the problem better. We have a convex quadrilateral, which means all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) are on the respective sides. So each of these points divides the sides into two segments. For example, \\( A_1 \\) is on \\( AB \\), so \\( A_1 \\) could be somewhere between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nThen, we're looking at four triangles inside the quadrilateral. Each triangle is formed by connecting two of these points with a vertex. Specifically, \\( AA_1D_1 \\), \\( BB_1A_1 \\), \\( CC_1B_1 \\), and \\( DD_1C_1 \\). The areas of these triangles are considered, and \\( S \\) is the sum of the two smallest ones among these four.\n\nThe goal is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\) times the area of quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\) is always at least \\( S \\). So we need \\( k \\) to be as small as possible while still satisfying \\( k S_1 \\geq S \\) for all possible configurations of the quadrilateral and the points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\).\n\nI think maybe it's helpful to consider some special cases where the quadrilateral is a square or rectangle because that might give some symmetry and allow us to compute areas more easily. Or perhaps if the quadrilateral is"

Or maybe the case where two triangles are very small and two are larger, so we have to make sure that \\( k S_1 \\) is still larger than the sum of the two smallest ones.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recall some theorems or inequalities related to areas in quadrilaterals with points on sides. I remember something about Rado's theorem or maybe something related to convex areas. Or perhaps mass point geometry? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe thinking about affine transformations could help, as they can turn any convex quadrilateral into a square, preserving area ratios. That might simplify things because working with a square might be easier.\n\nLet me try to outline a plan. First, perhaps assume without loss of generality that the quadrilateral is a square. That might make computations easier. Then, express the areas of the triangles and quadrilateral in terms of the positions of \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\). By varying these positions, we can see how \\( S \\) and \\( S_1 \\) relate, which will lead us to determine the minimal \\( k \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe set specific coordinates for the quadrilateral to make the problem algebraic. For example, place \\( A, B, C, D \\) at coordinates \\( (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1) \\) making it a unit square. Then, let \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\) be points on the sides.

This is just a guess; maybe the exact positions need more thought.\n\nWait, actually, on second thought, the positions might not be symmetrically placed.
