The key property required is that for every integer \\( n \\geq 15 \\), and for each subset \\( A_i \\), there exist two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) whose sum is \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, the problem is about partitioning all positive integers into \\( k \\) subsets with a specific condition on their sums. The condition is quite strong: for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), each subset must contain two distinct numbers that add up to \\( n \\).\n\nSo, my goal is to find the maximum possible \\( k \\). That means I need to figure out the largest number of subsets such that each subset still satisfies this sum condition for all \\( n \\geq 15 \\).\n\nLet me think about what this implies. If I have too many subsets, say \\( k \\) is too large, then each subset might not contain enough numbers to cover all the required sums \\( n \\geq 15 \\). On the other hand, if \\( k \\) is too small, maybe the subsets are too large, which could make the condition easier to satisfy but not necessarily maximize \\( k \\).\n\nI recall something about Schur numbers and Ramsey theory, which deal with partitioning integers and ensuring monochromatic solutions to equations like \\( x + y = n \\). Maybe that's related here.\n\nIn Ramsey theory, a Schur number \\( S(k) \\) is the largest integer such that the set \\( \\{1, 2, ..., S(k)\\} \\) can be partitioned into \\( k \\) subsets, each of which is sum-free (meaning no two elements in the same subset add up to another element in the subset). But in this problem, it's kind of the opposite: we require that in each subset, for every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there exists a pair adding up to \\( n \\). So, it's the opposite of sum-free; in fact, it's a covering condition.\n\nHmm, so maybe this is about ensuring that each subset is \"dense\" enough to cover all sums beyond 15.

So, in each subset \\( A_i \\), it needs to have numbers spread out in such a way that the gaps between numbers aren't too large, otherwise, some sums \\( n \\) would be missing.\n\nLet me try to model this. For \\( A_i \\) to have pairs adding up to every \\( n \\geq 15 \\), \\( A_i \\) must contain numbers that cover all such \\( n \\). So, for each \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there must be at least one pair \\( (x, y) \\) in \\( A_i \\) where \\( x + y = n \\).\n\nThis seems to require that each subset \\( A_i \\) is quite \"complete\" in terms of covering all the sums. So, how can we maximize \\( k \\) while still maintaining this property?\n\nPerhaps I should consider how numbers are grouped in each subset. If a subset has too many numbers, it could interfere with the ability of other subsets to cover all sums. Alternatively, if subsets are too sparse, they might not cover all the necessary sums.\n\nLet me think about the density required in each subset.

So, for each \\( n \\), \\( A_i \\) must contain at least one pair \\( (x, n - x) \\).\n\nThis seems similar to saying that each subset must contain a \"complementary\" pair for each \\( n \\geq 15 \\). But since numbers are infinite, this can't be directly applied, but perhaps there's a way to structure the subsets so that they cover all necessary sums.\n\nWait, another thought. If we consider that each number can be paired with another number to sum up to a target \\( n \\), then each number can only be used in one subset. But since the problem allows for multiple pairs in the same subset, maybe each subset needs to contain a sufficiently large arithmetic progression or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look at the minimal number of subsets needed so that each subset doesn't have too many numbers, but still"

Can we partition the integers into two subsets such that each subset has pairs adding to every \\( n \\geq 15 \\)?\n\nLet me try to construct such a partition. Let's say we split the numbers into even and odd. Then, in the even subset, all numbers are even. The sum of two even numbers is even, so for even \\( n \\geq 15 \\), we can have pairs, but for odd \\( n \\geq 15 \\), we can't get an odd sum from two even numbers. Similarly, the odd subset can't form even sums. So that partition doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so splitting into even and odd is bad because each subset can't cover both even and odd sums. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe partition numbers in some other way. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSuppose we use a greedy method.

Then, for each subsequent \\( n \\geq16 \\), we need to ensure that each subset has a pair for that \\( n \\). To do this, we can \"reuse\" numbers from previous pairs or introduce new numbers.\n\nHowever, since each number can only be in one subset, we have to carefully assign numbers so that they can be part of multiple pairs in their subset.\n\nWait, but each number can be part of multiple pairs. For example, the number 1 can be part of pairs (1,14), (1,15), (1,16), etc., but all those pairs must be in the same subset.

But if you have multiple subsets, you can't have all subsets contain all large numbers, but perhaps they can contain overlapping large numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps instead, each subset is co-finite, meaning it misses only finitely many numbers. But I'm not sure if that would work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is related to the chromatic number of the graph where vertices are numbers and edges connect pairs that sum to \\( n \\geq15 \\). The chromatic number would be the minimal number of colors needed so that no two connected numbers share the same color.
