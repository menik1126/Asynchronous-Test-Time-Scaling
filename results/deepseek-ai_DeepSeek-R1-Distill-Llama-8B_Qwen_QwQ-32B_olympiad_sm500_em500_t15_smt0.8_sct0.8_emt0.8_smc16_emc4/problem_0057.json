The sequence is defined as x\u2081 = a, and x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 for n \u2265 1. Then y_n is defined as 2^{x_n} - 1. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the sequence x_n looks like. Starting with x\u2081 = a. Then x\u2082 = 2a + 1, x\u2083 = 2*(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3, x\u2084 = 2*(4a + 3) + 1 = 8a + 7, and so on. So, it seems like each term is doubling the previous term and adding 1. So, the nth term would be x_n = 2^{n-1} * a + (2^{n-1} - 1). Wait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nFor n=1: 2^{0} *a + (2^{0} -1) = a + 0 = a. Correct.\nn=2: 2^{1} *a + (2^{1} -1) = 2a + 1. Yup, that's x\u2082.\nn=3: 4a + 3 = 2^{2}a + (2^{2} -1). Yes.\n\nSo, general formula is x_n = (2^{n-1})*a + (2^{n-1} -1). I can factor that as x_n = 2^{n-1}(a + 1) -1. So, x_n = 2^{n-1}(a +1) -1.\n\nNow, y_n = 2^{x_n} -1. So y_n = 2^{(2^{n-1}(a +1) -1)} -1.\n\nHmm, okay, so y_n is a Mersenne number. Mersenne primes, right? They are primes of the form 2^p -1, where p itself is prime. But not all exponents p lead to Mersenne primes; many are composite.\n\nBut in this case, the exponent x_n is defined in"

So, the task is to find the maximum k such that there exists an a where y\u2081, y\u2082, ..., y_k are prime.\n\nLet me start with small k and see possible a.\n\nCase k=1: y\u2081 = 2^{x\u2081} -1 = 2^a -1. So, to have y\u2081 prime, a must be prime, but not all primes a will give a Mersenne prime. For example, a=11 gives 2^11 -1=2047=23*89, not prime. But a=3 gives 7, which is prime, so k=1 is possible.\n\nBut we need larger k. Let's try k=2.\n\nCompute y\u2081 = 2^a -1, which needs to be prime. Then y\u2082 = 2^{x\u2082} -1 = 2^{2a +1} -1.\n\nSo, for a given a where y\u2081 is prime, we need y\u2082 to also be prime.\n\nLet me pick a=3.\n\nThen x\u2081=3, y\u2081=7 (prime). x\u2082=2*3 +1=7, y\u2082=2^7 -1=127, which is prime.

So, not useful.\n\nWait, maybe if I pick a such that x\u2081 is prime, y\u2081 is prime, x\u2082 is prime, y\u2082 is prime, etc.\n\nWait, but in order to have y\u2081 prime, x\u2081 must be prime? Because y\u2081=2^a -1 is a Mersenne prime if and only if a is prime. But not always, as a=11 gives 2047, which is composite.\n\nSimilarly, for y\u2082 to be prime, x\u2082=2a +1 must be prime.\n\nBecause y\u2082=2^{x\u2082} -1, which is a Mersenne number. So, for y\u2082 to be prime, x\u2082 must be prime.\n\nSimilarly, for y\u2083 to be prime, x\u2083=2x\u2082 +1 must be prime, etc.\n\nSo, the chain is that each x_n must be prime for y_n to be prime (assuming Mersenne primes follow that exponents must be prime, which is a necessary condition, though not sufficient). So, perhaps, if we can find a a such that x\u2081, x\u2082, x\u2083, ..., x_k are all primes, then maybe y\u2081, y\u2082, ..., y_k will be primes or at least have a chance to be prime.\n\nWait, for a=2: x\u2081=2 (prime), x\u2082=5 (prime), x\u2083=11 (prime), x\u2084=23 (prime), x\u2085=47 (prime), etc. So, the x_n sequence is 2,5,11,23,47,...\n\nAll these x_n are primes.

Let me check.\n\n2^23 is 8388608. 8388608 -1=8388607. Hmm, does this number have factors?\n\nWell, I recall that 2^p -1 is prime only if p is prime, but not all prime p"
