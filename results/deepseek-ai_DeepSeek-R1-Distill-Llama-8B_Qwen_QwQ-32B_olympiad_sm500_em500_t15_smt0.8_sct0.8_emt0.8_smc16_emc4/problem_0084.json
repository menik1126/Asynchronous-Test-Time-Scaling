On each side, there are points \\( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 \\). Then, we form four triangles by connecting these points. Each triangle uses two adjacent points and a point on the next side. The areas of these triangles are considered, the two smallest ones are summed to get \\( S \\), and the area of the inner quadrilateral \\( A_1B_1C_1D_1 \\) is \\( S_1 \\). We need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( kS_1 \\geq S \\).\n\nI think I should consider using area ratios or perhaps some geometric inequalities. Maybe using barycentric coordinates or affine transformations could help, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe mass point geometry can be useful here.\n\nAnother thought: Since the problem is about areas, perhaps I can express the areas of the triangles and the quadrilateral in terms of the sides and ratios in which the points divide the sides. Let me denote the ratios on each side.\n\nLet me define:\n- On side \\( AB \\), point \\( A_1 \\) divides \\( AB \\) in the ratio \\( t : 1 - t \\), so \\( AA_1 = t \\cdot AB \\) and \\( A_1B = (1 - t) \\cdot AB \\).\n- Similarly, on side \\( BC \\), point \\( B_1 \\) divides \\( BC \\) in the"
