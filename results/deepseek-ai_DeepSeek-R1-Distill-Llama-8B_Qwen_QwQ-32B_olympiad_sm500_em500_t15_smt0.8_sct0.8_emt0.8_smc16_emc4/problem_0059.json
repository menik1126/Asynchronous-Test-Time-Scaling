The setup is a bit involved, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem. We have a sequence defined by x\u2081 = a, where a is a positive integer. Then, each subsequent term is x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is double the previous one plus one. Then, y_n is defined as 2^{x_n} - 1. I need to find the maximum k such that for some a, the first k y's are all prime.\n\nHmm, okay. So, y\u2081 = 2^{x\u2081} - 1 = 2^a - 1. Then y\u2082 = 2^{x\u2082} - 1 = 2^{2a + 1} - 1, and so on. Each y_n is a Mersenne number, which are numbers of the form 2^p - 1 where p is prime. But not necessarily prime themselves.\n\nI remember that Mersenne primes are primes of the form 2^p - 1, where p itself is a prime number. But here, x_n could be composite, so y_n might not be prime even if x_n is prime.\n\nWait, but in this problem, a can be any positive integer, so x\u2081 = a, which could be prime or composite. Then x\u2082 = 2a + 1, which might be prime or not, depending on a. Similarly, x\u2083 = 2*(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3, and so on. So the x sequence depends on a.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find the largest k such that y\u2081, ..., y_k are all prime. So, we need to pick a such that y\u2081 = 2^a - 1 is prime, y\u2082 = 2^{2a + 1} - 1 is prime, y\u2083 = 2^{4a + 3} - 1 is prime, etc., as far as possible.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start with small values of a and see what happens. Let me try a = 2.\n\nIf a = 2"

Because if x_n is composite, say x_n = m*k, then 2^{m*k} -1 can be factored.\n\nWait, is that always true? Let me recall.\n\nYes, if n is composite, say n=ab with a >1 and b>1, then 2^n -1 = (2^a -1)(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + ... +1). So, if x_n is composite, y_n is composite. Therefore, 2^{x_n} -1 is prime only if x_n is prime. So for each y_n to be prime, x_n must be prime.\n\nTherefore, in order for y_n to be prime, each x_n needs to be prime.\n\nGiven that, x_n is defined as a recurrence: x_{n+1}=2x_n +1.\n\nSo, starting from x\u2081=a, which must be prime, then x\u2082=2a +1 must be prime, x\u2083=4a +3 must be prime, and so on.\n\nSo, to get the maximum k, we need the longest possible chain of primes generated by this recursion.\n\nGiven that, the problem reduces to finding the maximal k such that x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x_k are all primes.\n\nTherefore, the problem becomes: Find the longest possible sequence of primes defined by x_{n+1}=2x_n +1, starting from a prime x\u2081=a.\n\nSo, perhaps I can rephrase the problem: find the longest possible chain of primes a, 2a+1, "

Wait, but the problem counts y\u2081 to y_k. Wait, but in the problem, y\u2081 corresponds to x\u2081, so the number of primes y\u2081,...,y_k requires that x\u2081,...,x_k are primes, so the length of the chain of primes in x's is exactly k.

So, I can't just assume that all y_n will be prime even if x_n is prime. Thus, my previous conclusion was wrong.\n\nSo, x_n being prime is a necessary condition, but not sufficient for y_n to be prime.\n\nTherefore, I must consider both x_n being prime and y_n being prime.\n\nSo, the problem is not just finding the longest chain of primes x\u2081, x\u2082,...,x_k, but also ensuring that 2^{x_n} -1 is prime for each n from 1 to k.\n\nThis complicates things. So, even if I have a long chain of x's being primes, I still need to check whether the corresponding y's are primes.\n\nSo, for instance, in the case of a=2, y\u2083=2047 is composite, so that breaks the chain.
