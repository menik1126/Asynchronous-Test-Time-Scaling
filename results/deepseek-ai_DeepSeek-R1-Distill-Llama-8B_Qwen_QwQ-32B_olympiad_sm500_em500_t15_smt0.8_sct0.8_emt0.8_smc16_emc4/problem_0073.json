The sequence is defined by the formula \\( a_n = n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d \\), where \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are integer constants, and \\( n \\) can be any integer, including negatives. The question is asking for the possible values of \\( a_{2015} \\cdot a_{2016} \\) for such a cubic sequence that satisfies a condition mentioned in part (a). Hmm, but I don't have part (a) in front of me, so I need to figure out what that condition could be.\n\nWait, maybe I can work around it. Since it's a cubic sequence, it's determined by four coefficients: the leading coefficient is 1 for \\( n^3 \\), and then \\( b \\), \\( c \\), \\( d \\) are the other coefficients. The fact that \\( n \\) ranges over all integers, including negatives, might be important. Maybe part (a) has something to do with roots or factors of the cubic equation, perhaps?\n\nI recall that for polynomials with integer coefficients, if there's an integer root, it must divide the constant term. But this isn't directly about roots, though. Let's think differently.\n\nSince \\( a_n \\) is defined for all integers \\( n \\), maybe part (a) is about the sequence having no real roots or something like that? Or perhaps it's about the sequence being a bijection? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, it could be about the cubic being irreducible over the integers, meaning it doesn't factor into polynomials with integer coefficients besides the trivial ones.\n\nWait, let me read the question again. It just says \"a cubic sequence satisfying the condition in part (a)\". Since I don't have part (a), maybe the condition is given in the problem statement but wasn't mentioned here. Wait, perhaps the problem is a continuation from part (a)? Without knowing part (a), it's tricky, but maybe I can deduce it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is about the cubic having certain properties, like being monotonic or something. But since it's a cubic, it's generally monotonic after a certain point if the leading coefficient is positive.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about whether the cubic has distinct roots or something like that.

So it's possible that on the integer points, the function is strictly increasing. Let me check.\n\nIf the cubic has its derivative always positive for integers, then the function would be strictly increasing, hence injective.\n\nThe derivative of \\( a_n \\) is \\( 3n^2 + 2b n + c \\). For this derivative to be positive for all integers \\( n \\), the quadratic in \\( n \\) must be always positive. But over the reals, such a quadratic will always be positive if its discriminant is negative and the leading coefficient is positive.\n\nThe discriminant is \\( (2b)^2 - 4 \\times 3 \\times c = 4b^2 - 12c \\). So if \\( 4b^2 - 12c < 0 \\), then the quadratic is always positive. That would require \\( 4b^2 < 12c \\) or \\( b^2 < 3c \\).
