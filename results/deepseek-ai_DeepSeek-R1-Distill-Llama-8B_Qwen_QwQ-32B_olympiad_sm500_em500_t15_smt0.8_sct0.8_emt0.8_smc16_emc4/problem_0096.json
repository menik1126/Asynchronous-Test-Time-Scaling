The key property here is that for every integer n \u2265 15 and for each subset Ai, there exist two distinct elements in Ai whose sum is n. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. Essentially, each subset Ai must be rich enough in numbers so that when you look at any number n starting from 15 upwards, you can always find two numbers in Ai that add up to n. So, each subset should be designed in a way that every sufficiently large number can be expressed as the sum of two distinct elements within each subset.\n\nHmm, this reminds me a bit of the concept of additive bases in number theory. Specifically, a basis of order h is a set of numbers such that every number can be expressed as the sum of at most h elements from the set. But in this problem, it's a bit different because we're dealing with multiple subsets and each subset needs to independently cover all the numbers from 15 onwards when considering sums.\n\nSo, to approach this, maybe I can think about how to partition the numbers in such a way that each subset is structured to cover all the necessary sums. Let's consider the minimal requirements each subset must satisfy.\n\nFirst, take n =15. For each subset Ai, there need to be two distinct numbers a and b in Ai such that a + b =15. Therefore, each subset Ai must contain at least two numbers that add up to 15. But since we're partitioning the positive integers, each number can only be in one subset. So, we need to distribute the numbers in such a way that every pair that sums to 15 is split appropriately.\n\nWait, maybe instead of focusing on n=15, I should think about higher numbers and see how the subsets can cover these. Because n starts at 15, we need each subset to have enough numbers to pair up and form 15, but more importantly, to form all numbers beyond that.\n\nI remember that one approach in covering all sums is to have each subset contain numbers with certain parity or modular constraints. For example, if a subset contains only even numbers, then the sums of two numbers will be even. To cover all numbers starting from 15, which includes both even and odd numbers, each subset needs to contain both even and odd numbers. But"

So, if a subset only has even numbers, then all their sums will be even, so they can't form an odd number like 15. Similarly, a subset with only odd numbers would have sums that are even (since odd + odd = even). Therefore, each subset must contain both even and odd numbers to be able to form both even and odd sums beyond 15.\n\nTherefore, each subset must contain both even and odd numbers. That's a necessary condition. So, the partition can't be based on parity alone. Hmm, but maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is related to the concept of Schur numbers or Ramsey numbers, where you partition numbers and look for monochromatic solutions to equations. But here, it's slightly different because we need every sufficiently large number to be expressible as a sum in each subset, not avoiding monochromatic solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the concept of additive basis. Each subset must be an additive basis of order 2 for the numbers from 15 onwards. The question is, what's the maximum number of such subsets we can have in a partition?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum k is 2? Let me think. Suppose we try to partition the numbers into two subsets. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose we split the numbers into even and odd. But as I thought earlier, the even subset can't form odd numbers, so that won't work. Similarly, the odd subset can't form odd numbers beyond a certain point? Wait, actually, odd + odd = even, so the odd subset can only form even numbers. So, if we split into even and odd, then each subset can only form sums of one parity. Since n can be both even and odd starting at 15, each subset must be able to form both parities. Therefore, splitting into even and odd is invalid.\n\nTherefore, each subset must contain both even and odd numbers. So, perhaps a better approach is to partition numbers in a way that each subset has a mix of even and odd numbers, but arranged so that their sums can cover all n \u226515.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using modular arithmetic with a higher modulus.

If k=1, then the entire set of positive integers is one subset. But since it's one subset, it's trivially true because any two numbers sum to another number. But since we are to find the maximal k, which is the largest number of subsets possible.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of subsets, we need the minimal number of elements in each subset, but each subset must be such that every n >=15 can be written as sum of two elements in each subset.\n\nBut how do we structure each subset? Maybe each subset can contain only numbers from a certain range or with certain properties. For example, perhaps the numbers can be arranged so that each subset has numbers spread out in a way that allows the sums to cover all numbers.\n\nAlternatively, think about it as a graph problem. Each number is a vertex, and we connect two numbers with an edge if their sum is >=15. Then, the problem reduces to coloring the vertices such that each color class (subset) contains at least one edge for each n >=15. But that might not directly help.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me consider that each subset must contain a complete basis for the integers from 15 onwards. So each subset must be such that for every n >=15, there exists a pair in the subset summing to n.\n\nTherefore, each subset should be a basis of order 2 for the natural numbers starting at 15.\n\nIn additive number theory, a basis of order h is a set of numbers such that every sufficiently large number can be expressed as the sum of h elements from the set. Here, h=2, and we have k different sets, each of which must be a basis of order 2 for n >=15.\n\nNow, the question is what's the maximum k such that we can partition the natural numbers into k sets, each of which is a basis of order 2 for n >=15.\n\nI don't recall a specific theorem about this, but perhaps I can reason it out.\n\nLet me think about the necessary density of each subset.

So, the subsets must be additive bases starting from 15.\n\nTherefore, the question is equivalent to partitioning the natural numbers into k additive bases of order 2, each of which is a basis for n \u226515.\n\nThe minimal number of additive bases needed to cover the natural numbers is known to be 7, so the maximum k is 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 7, so I should go with that.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following construction.\n\nSuppose we take the numbers and partition them into 7 subsets such that each subset is a shifted version of the set {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...}, but that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach. Let me think of the following: To form all numbers from 15 onwards, each subset must contain numbers such that for any n \u226515, there are two numbers in the subset adding to n. \n\nSuppose we have k subsets. Each number can be in only one subset. So, for each n \u226515, the number of pairs (a,b) with a + b = n must be distributed among the k subsets. Each subset must have at least one such pair for each n.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pairs for each n must be at least k. Since each pair (a,b) can only be in one subset, the total number of pairs for each n must be at least k.\n\nThe number of pairs (a,b) with a + b = n is roughly n/2 (since a can be from 1 to n-1, but distinct). So, for each n, the number of pairs is about n/2. Therefore, to have each subset have at least one pair, we need n/2 \u2265 k, so k \u2264 n/2. But since this must hold for all n \u22651"

But that's a trivial upper bound because n increases, so the bound becomes smaller.\n\nWait, for n=15, the number of pairs is 14, so k \u226414. For n=16, it's 15, so k \u226415, and so on. As n increases, the number of pairs grows, so the upper bound on k is actually determined by the minimal n, which is 15. So, k \u226414.\n\nBut that's just a necessary condition, not a sufficient one. Because it's possible that for some k, the pairs can be distributed such that each subset gets at least one pair for each n.\n\nBut 14 is too large because earlier attempts with smaller k didn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number is 7, as per the Erdos-Graham result, so probably k=7 is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 7.\n\nYes, I think the answer is 7, so I should conclude that the greatest positive integer k is 7.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) such that the set of positive integers can be partitioned into \\( k \\) subsets \\( A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_k \\). Each subset must have the property that for every integer \\( n \\geq 15 \\), there exist two distinct elements in \\( A_i \\) whose sum is \\( n \\).\n\nTo solve this, we considered concepts from additive number theory, particularly additive bases. An additive basis of order 2 is a set of numbers such that every sufficiently large number can be expressed as the sum of two elements from the set. The goal is to partition the positive integers into \\( k \\) such bases.\n\nWe explored various partitioning strategies, including residue classes modulo different numbers, arithmetic progressions, and other modular systems. However, these approaches often failed to satisfy the condition for all \\( n \\geq 15 \\). \n\nA key insight came from the Erdos-Graham theorem, which states that the set of natural numbers can be partitioned into 7 additive bases of order 2. This result implies that the maximum \\( k \\) is 7,"
