It's about finding all positive integers \\( n \\) such that for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\) and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) satisfying the equation:\n\n\\[\nP(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})\n\\]\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, we need to determine for which \\( n \\) this condition holds for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree \\( \\leq n \\). That means no matter what monic polynomial with integer coefficients we choose (as long as its degree is up to \\( n \\)), we should be able to find such a \\( k \\) and those integers \\( x_i \\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the condition better. For a given \\( P \\), we have to find \\( k \\) and a set of \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers where the sum of \\( P \\) evaluated at the first \\( k \\) integers equals \\( P \\) evaluated at the last integer.\n\nLet me think about small values of \\( n \\) to get an idea.\n\nStarting with \\( n = 1 \\):\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), \\( P \\) is a linear monic polynomial with integer coefficients. So, \\( P(x) = x + c \\) for some integer \\( c \\). We need to find \\( k \\leq 1 \\), so \\( k = 1 \\). Then, we need two distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\).\n\nWait, for \\( k = 1 \\), the equation becomes \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). Since \\( P \\) is linear, \\( x_1 + c = x_2 + c \\), which simplifies to \\( x_1 = x_2 \\). But the problem says they must be distinct, so \\( x_1 \\neq x_2 \\). So, is this possible?\n\nWait, if \\( P"

Therefore, for \\( n = 1 \\), the condition fails.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\)\", so for \\( n = 1 \\), we have only \\( k = 1 \\). Since for \\( k = 1 \\), we can't have two distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2 \\) with \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\), because \\( P \\) is injective, as I thought earlier. So, \\( n = 1 \\) doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, that's confusing. The original problem says \"for every monic polynomial \\( P \\)\", so if there's even one polynomial where this isn't possible, then the \\( n \\) doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but hold on, if \\( n = 1 \\), the only monic polynomial is linear, and for that, as I reasoned, \\( k = 1 \\) doesn't work because we can't have \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) for distinct \\( x_1, x_2 \\). Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) doesn't work.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. For \\( k = 1 \\), it's just \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). For linear polynomials, this can't happen with \\( x_1 \\neq x_2 \\), so indeed, no solutions. Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) is invalid.\n\nMoving on to \\( n = 2 \\):\n\nFor \\( n = 2 \\), we have quadratics. So, \\( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\) with integer coefficients.

So, choosing \\( x_1 = 1 \\) and \\( x_2 = -1 \\), we get \\( P(1) + P(-1) = 2 \\times 1 = 2 = P( \\sqrt{2} ) \\). Wait, no, that's not correct because \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) isn't an integer. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, no, for \\( k = 1 \\), the equation is \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). So, if I have \\( x_1 = a \\) and \\( x_2 = -a \\), then \\( P(a) = P(-a) \\). So, yes, for any quadratic, this is possible because the function is even around its vertex if the linear term is zero, but even if it's not zero, it's symmetric around the vertex's x-coordinate.

Since it's monic, the leading coefficient is positive, so it tends to infinity as \\( x \\) increases and negative infinity as \\( x \\) decreases. Therefore, it is injective? Wait, no. Because a cubic function is bijective over the reals, but over integers, it might not be injective? Wait, over integers, a cubic can have multiple roots if it's composite, but if it's monic and has no integer roots, it might still be injective.\n\nWait, let me take an example. Let \\( P(x) = x^3 \\). Then, \\( P(x) \\) is strictly increasing for all real \\( x \\), so over integers, \\( x^3 \\) is injective.
