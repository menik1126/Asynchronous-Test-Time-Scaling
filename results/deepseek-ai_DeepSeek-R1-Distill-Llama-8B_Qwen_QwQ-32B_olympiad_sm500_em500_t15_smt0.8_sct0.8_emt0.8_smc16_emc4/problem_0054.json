The sequence is defined by starting with x\u2081 = a, and then each subsequent term is x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1. Then y_n is defined as 2^{x_n} - 1. \n\nLet me break this down step by step. First, I should understand how the x sequence behaves. Starting with x\u2081 = a, then x\u2082 = 2a + 1, x\u2083 = 2x\u2082 + 1 = 2(2a + 1) + 1 = 4a + 3, and so on. So each term is doubling the previous term and then adding 1. That seems like a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2 and then adding 1 each time.\n\nNow, y_n is 2^{x_n} - 1. So y\u2081 = 2^a - 1, y\u2082 = 2^{2a + 1} - 1, y\u2083 = 2^{4a + 3} - 1, and so on. Each y_n is a Mersenne number, which is numbers of the form 2^p - 1 where p is prime. But in this case, the exponents x_n themselves are following a specific recurrence relation. \n\nThe problem is asking for the largest k such that y\u2081, y\u2082, ..., y_k are all prime. So I need to find an a such that as many y_n as possible are prime. Since we're dealing with primes, we have to ensure that each y_n is a prime number. \n\nFirst, let's compute y\u2081: y\u2081 = 2^a - 1. For y\u2081 to be prime, it must be a Mersenne prime. So a needs to be a prime number because Mersenne primes are of the form 2^p - 1 where p is prime. But wait, not all primes p give a Mersenne prime; only certain primes do. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, etc. So a must be a prime for y\u2081 to have a chance of being prime, but it's not guaranteed. \n\nLet me consider"
