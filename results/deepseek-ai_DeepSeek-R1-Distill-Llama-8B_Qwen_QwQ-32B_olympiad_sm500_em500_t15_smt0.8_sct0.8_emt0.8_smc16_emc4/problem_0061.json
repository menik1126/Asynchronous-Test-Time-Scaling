Let me start by understanding what's given and what I need to find.\n\nFirst, the problem defines a sequence x\u2081, x\u2082, ... where x\u2081 = a and x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1 for n \u2265 1. So, starting from some positive integer a, each subsequent term is twice the previous term plus one. That seems straightforward. Then, y_n is defined as 2^{x_n} - 1. So, each y_n is a Mersenne number, which are numbers of the form 2^p - 1 where p is prime. But here, x_n is part of a recursively defined sequence, not necessarily prime.\n\nThe goal is to find the largest k such that for some a, the numbers y\u2081, y\u2082, ..., y_k are all prime. So, I need to choose a starting value a such that when I generate the sequence x\u2081, x\u2082, ..., x_k, each corresponding y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1 is prime, and then find the maximum possible k across all such a.\n\nLet me start by computing some terms with small a to get a sense of what the sequence looks like.\n\nLet's try a = 2.\n\nThen, x\u2081 = 2.\n\nx\u2082 = 2*x\u2081 + 1 = 2*2 + 1 = 5.\n\nx\u2083 = 2*x\u2082 + 1 = 2*5 + 1 = 11.\n\nx\u2084 = 2*11 + 1 = 23.\n\nSo, y\u2081 = 2\u00b2 - 1 = 3 (prime).\n\ny\u2082 = 2\u2075 - 1 = 31 (prime).\n\ny\u2083 = 2\u00b9\u00b9 - 1 = 2047.

Let me think about how the sequence x_n progresses.\n\nThe recursion is x_{n+1}=2x_n +1. So, each term is roughly doubling each time. So, the numbers are growing exponentially. Since Mersenne primes are rare, perhaps only small a will give consecutive primes.\n\nI remember that Mersenne primes are primes of the form 2^p -1 where p itself is prime, but that's not necessarily required here, because x_n doesn't have to be prime, just that 2^{x_n} -1 is prime.\n\nWait, but in our problem, x_{n+1}=2x_n +1, so x_n is starting from a, then x_2=2a+1, x_3=2x_2 +1=4a + 3, x_4=8a +7, and so on.

So, x_n must be prime for y_n to be a Mersenne prime.\n\nWait, but in this problem, x_n doesn't necessarily have to be prime, but in our consideration, since for y_n to be prime, x_n must be prime.\n\nSo, each y_n must be a Mersenne prime. But wait, in our problem, it's possible that x_n is composite, but y_n=2^{x_n} -1 might still be prime. But Mersenne primes require that the exponent is prime, as I just thought. So, perhaps in our case, even for y_n to be prime, x_n must be prime. Therefore, if any x_n is composite, y_n is composite. Thus, for y_1, y_2, ..., y_k to all be prime, each x_n must be prime.\n\nSo, that tells me that each term in the x_n sequence must be a prime. Therefore, starting from a, each x_n must be prime.\n\nSo, for example, a must be prime, x\u2082=2a +1 must be prime, x\u2083=2x\u2082 +1=4a +3 must be prime, etc.\n\nSo, if a is 2: x\u2081=2 (prime), x\u2082=5 (prime), x\u2083=11 (prime), x\u2084=23 (prime), x\u2085=47 (prime), x\u2086=95, which is not prime (composite). So, y\u2081=3, y\u2082=31, y\u2083=2047 (which is 23*89, so composite). So, as we saw before, with a=2, we get y\u2081 and y\u2082 prime, but y\u2083 composite. But if I check up to x\u2085=47, y\u2085=2^{47}-1, which is a known Mersenne prime (M15). So, y\u2081 to y\u2085 would be 3,31,2047, which is composite.
