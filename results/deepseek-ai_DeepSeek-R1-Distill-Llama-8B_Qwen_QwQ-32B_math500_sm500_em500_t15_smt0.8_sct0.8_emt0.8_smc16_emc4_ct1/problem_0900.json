Hmm, I remember that a fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator has only 2s and 5s as prime factors after simplifying. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the given fraction: \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\). The denominator is \\(2^2 \\times 5^7\\), which is already in the form that contains only 2s and 5s. That seems promising because I know that such denominators result in terminating decimals when converted.\n\nBut wait, the numerator is 21, which is 3 times 7. Neither 3 nor 7 are factors of 2 or 5, so maybe I need to adjust the fraction to make sure the denominator is only 2s and 5s. Or maybe since the denominator already has 2s and 5s, I can just work with that.\n\nAlright, so perhaps I can write the fraction as \\(\\frac{21}{4 \\times 78125}\\), because \\(2^2 = 4\\) and \\(5^7 = 78125\\). So, 4 times 78125 is the denominator.\n\nNow, to convert this into a decimal, I could try dividing 21 by 4 first and then by 78125. Or maybe find a common factor or something. Wait, actually, the denominator is 4 times 78125, which is \\(2^2 \\times 5^7\\), so maybe I can adjust the fraction to have a power of 10 in the denominator because 10 is 2 times 5.\n\nI recall that if the denominator can be expressed as \\(10^n\\) where n is a positive integer, then the decimal will terminate. So, let me try to make the denominator a power of 10. To do that, I need to have the same number of 2s and 5s in the prime factors. Currently, I have two 2s and seven 5s.\n\nTo balance them, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 5s until the number of 5s equals the number of 2s. Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 2s until the number of 2s equals the number"

Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the denominator is \\(2^2 \\times 5^7\\). To make it a power of 10, which is \\(2^n \\times 5^n\\), I need to have the exponents of 2 and 5 equal. The exponent of 2 is 2, and exponent of 5 is 7. So, the smaller exponent is 2. Therefore, to make them equal, I can multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^{7 - 2} = 2^5\\), so that the denominator becomes \\(2^{2+5} \\times 5^7 = 2^7 \\times 5^7 = 10^7\\). That way, the denominator is 10^7, which is 10,000,000. \n\nAlternatively, I could multiply numerator and denominator by 5^(2 - 7) but that would give negative exponents, which isn't helpful. So, the correct approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5 to get the denominator to 10^7.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21 \\times 2^5}{(2^2 \\cdot 5^7) \\times 2^5} = \\frac{21 \\times 32}{2^7 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21 \\times 32}{10^7}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator: 21 multiplied by 32. Let me compute that. 20*32 is 640, and 1*32 is 32, so total is 640 +32 = 672. So the numerator is 672, and the denominator is 10^7, which is 10,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{672}{1"

            "output": ",000,0000}\\). To write this as a decimal, I can perform the division 672 divided by 10,000,000. \n\nWait, 10,000,000 has seven zeros, so moving the decimal point seven places to the left. So, 672.0 becomes 0.000672 after moving the decimal seven places.\n\nWait, let me check: moving the decimal one place is dividing by 10, so 672.0 becomes 67.20, then 6.720, then 0.6720, then 0.06720, 0.006720, 0.0006720, and finally 0.00006720? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 10^7 is 10,000,000, and 672 divided by 10,000,000 is 0.000672.\n\nHold on, maybe I confused the number of places. Each multiplication by 10 moves the decimal one place. So, 10^1 is dividing by 10, moving one place, 10^2 two places, etc. So 10^7 would be moving seven places.\n\nStarting with 672 divided by 10,000,000:\n\n1. 672.0 /10 = 67.20\n2. 67.20 /10 = 6.720\n3. 6.720 /10 = 0.6720\n4. 0.6720 /10 = 0.06720\n5. 0.06720 /10 = 0.006720\n6. 0.006720 /10 = 0.0006720\n7. 0.0006720 /10 = 0.00006720\n\nWait, but that gives me 0.00006720, but that's 6.72 x 10^-5, but 672 x 10^-7 is 0.000672, which is 6.72 x 10^-4. Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated the number of decimal places.\n\nWait, no. 10^7 is 10,000,000, so 1/10,000,000 is 0.0000001, so 672/10,000,000 would be 0.000672.\n\nWait, let me use another approach. 1/10^7 is 0.0000001,"

I can write both numerator and denominator in terms of powers of 10.\n\n10,000,000 is 1 followed by seven zeros, so 672 is 6.72 x 10^2, and 10,000,000 is 10^7.\n\nSo, 6.72 x 10^2 / 10^7 = 6.72 x 10^(2-7) = 6.72 x 10^-5.\n\nWait, 10^5 is 100,000, so 6.72 / 100,000 is 0.0000672.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the division step by step, I ended up with 0.00006720, which is 6.72 x 10^-5.

Let me actually compute 672 ÷ 10,000,000.\n\nLet me write 10,000,000 as 1e7. So 672 ÷ 1e7.\n\nIn decimal terms, that is 0.0000672. Because 1e7 is 10 million, so 672 divided by 10 million.\n\nSo 10 million times 0.0000672 is 672. Because 0.0001 times 10 million is 1000, so 0.0000672 is 67.2 times 0.001, which is 67.2 / 10,000, or 0.00672.

Let's think differently.\n\nIf I write 10,000,000 as 10^7, then 672 / 10^7 is equal to (672 / 10^2) / 10^5, which is 6.72 / 10^5, which is 0.0000672.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, 672 ÷ 4 = 168, and 10,000,000 ÷4 = 2,500,000. So 168/2,500,000. Then, 168 ÷4 =42, 2,500,000 ÷4 =625,000. So, 42/625,000.

Since 625 is 5^4, and 10^3 is 2^3 *5^3. So together, the denominator is 5^7 *2^3. Wait, but that's not matching with the original denominator.\n\nWait, maybe I'm"
