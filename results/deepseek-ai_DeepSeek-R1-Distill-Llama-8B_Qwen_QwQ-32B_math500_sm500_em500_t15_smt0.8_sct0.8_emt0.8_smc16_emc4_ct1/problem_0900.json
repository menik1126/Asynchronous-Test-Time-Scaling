However, rounding to the nearest 7 decimal places gives \\(0.00001235\\).)\n\nWait, actually, let me check the division again. Let me compute 21 divided by 312500 step by step.\n\nFirst, note that 312500 is 3.125 × 10^5. So, 21 divided by 312500 is the same as 21 divided by 3.125 × 10^5. Let me compute 21 divided by 3.125 first.\n\n21 ÷ 3.125 = 21 ÷ (25/8) = 21 × (8/25) = (21×8)/25 = 168/25 = 6.72.\n\nThen, divide by 10^5 (which is 100000):\n\n6.72 ÷ 100000 = 0.0000672. Wait, that contradicts my previous result. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 2^2 *5^7 = 4 * 78125 = 312500. So 21 divided by 312500.\n\nLet me do this division step by step.\n\n21 divided by 312500:\n\nFirst, note that 312500 × 0.00001 = 3.125\n\nSo, 0.00001 corresponds to 3.125. So, 21 divided by 312500 is (21 / 3.125) × 0.00001.\n\n21 divided by 3.125:\n\n3.125 × 6 = 18.75\n\n21 - 18.75 = 2.25\n\n3.12"
