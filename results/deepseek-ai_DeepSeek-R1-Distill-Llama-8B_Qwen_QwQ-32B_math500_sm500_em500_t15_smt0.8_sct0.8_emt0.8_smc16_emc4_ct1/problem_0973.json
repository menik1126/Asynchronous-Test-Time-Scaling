The pay is based on the number of dogs each walks.\n\nUnder the new policy, dogs are assigned or unassigned in groups of \\( x \\) dogs.\n\nThere are two scenarios where the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same:\n\n1. Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, and Nate stays at 12 dogs.\n2. \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n\nI'll set up equations based on these scenarios and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, let's denote the initial ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay.\n\nDenali's initial dogs: 16\n\nNate's initial dogs: 12\n\nLet the ratio of their pays be the same as the ratio of their dogs, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4x + 16}{12}\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think again.\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, so her new dog count is \\( 16 + 4x \\), and Nate still walks 12 dogs. The ratio of their pays should be the same as the ratio of their dogs.\n\nSo the ratio after the first change is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16}{12}\n\\]\n\nWait, no. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay should equal the ratio of their dogs. So if the ratio remains the same, then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16}{12}\n\\]\n\nBut this implies \\( 16 + 4x = 16 \\), which would mean \\( x = 0 \\). But \\( x \\) can't be zero. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nPerhaps the ratio remains the same as before, which was \\( \\frac{16}{12} \\). So after the first scenario, the ratio should still be \\( \\frac{16}{12} \\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16}{12}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to \\( 16 + 4x ="

The problem states that the ratio of their pay would be the same under two different scenarios. So the ratio under scenario 1 must equal the ratio under scenario 2, not necessarily the original ratio. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem states: \"The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking 4x more dogs and Nate stayed at 12 dogs or if x of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.\"\n\nSo both scenarios should result in the same ratio. Therefore, the two scenarios must produce the same ratio between their pays, not necessarily the original ratio.\n\nLet me write the two ratios:\n\nFirst scenario:\n\n- Denali's dogs: 16 + 4x\n\n- Nate's dogs: 12\n\nTherefore, the ratio is \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\).\n\nSecond scenario:\n\n- x dogs are moved from Nate to Denali.\n\nThus:\n\n- Denali's dogs: 16 + x\n\n- Nate's dogs: 12 - x\n\nThe ratio here is \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, these two ratios must be equal. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for x.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\( (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = (16 + x)(12) \\)\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side:\n\n16*12 + 16*(-x) + 4x*12 + 4x*(-x)\n\n= 192 - 16x + 48x -4x\u00b2\n\n= 192 + 32x -4x\u00b2\n\nRight side:\n\n16*12 + x*12\n\n= 192 + 12x\n\nSo setting left equal to right:\n\n192 + 32x -4x\u00b2 = 192 + 12x\n\nSubtract 192 from both sides:\n\n"
