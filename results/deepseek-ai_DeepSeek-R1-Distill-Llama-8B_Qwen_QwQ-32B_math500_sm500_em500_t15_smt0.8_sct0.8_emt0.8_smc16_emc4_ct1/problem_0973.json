The company assigns or unassigns dogs in groups of x.\n\nI need to find the value of x such that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same under two different scenarios: one where Denali gets 4x more dogs and the other where x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali.\n\nLet's denote Denali's new number of dogs as D and Nate's as N.\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali walks D = 16 + 4x dogs, and Nate still walks N = 12 dogs.\n\nThe ratio of their pay should be the same as the original ratio, which is 16:12 or 4:3.\n\nSo, D / N = 4 / 3.\n\nSubstituting D, we get (16 + 4x) / 12 = 4 / 3.\n\nSolving this equation will give me one possible value for x.\n\nIn the second scenario, x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali. So Denali walks D = 16 + x dogs, and Nate walks N = 12 - x dogs.\n\nThe ratio of their pay should still be 4 / 3.\n\nSo, (16 + x) / (12 - x) = 4 / 3.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. (16 + 4x) / 12 = 4 / 3\n2. (16 + x) / (12 - x) = 4 / 3\n\nI can solve the first equation to find one value for x and then check if it satisfies the second equation.\n\nAlternatively, since both ratios must hold true, solving both equations simultaneously will give me the correct value for x.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks \\(16\\) dogs.\n- Nate walks \\(12\\) dogs.\n- Company assigns or unassigns dogs in groups of \\(x\\).\n- The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same under two scenarios:\n  1.
