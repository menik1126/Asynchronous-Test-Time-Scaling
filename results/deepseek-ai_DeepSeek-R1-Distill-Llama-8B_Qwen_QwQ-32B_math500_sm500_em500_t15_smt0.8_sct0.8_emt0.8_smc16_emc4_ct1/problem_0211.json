            "output": "First, I need to determine the areas of the three regions labeled X, Y, and Z by calculating the areas of the circles and subtracting the smaller circles from the larger ones.\n\nStarting with region X, it is the area of the smallest circle with a radius of 4. The area is calculated using the formula πr², which gives 16π.\n\nRegion Y is between the circles with radii 6 and 4. Subtracting the area of the smallest circle from the middle circle gives the area of region Y as (36π - 16π) = 20π.\n\nFinally, region Z is the area of the largest circle with a radius of 7, minus the area of the middle circle. This results in (49π - 36π) = 13π.\n\nComparing the areas of all regions, the largest area is 20π, which belongs to region Y, and the smallest area is 13π, belonging to region Z.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the difference between the area of the largest and smallest regions, we'll calculate the areas of each region step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the area of each circle:**\n   - **Circle with radius 4 (Region X):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{X} = \\pi \\times (4)^2 = 16\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 6 (Region Y):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{Y} = \\pi \\times (6)^2 = 36\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 7 (Region Z):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{Z} = \\pi \\times (7)^2 = 49\\pi\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the areas of the regions:**\n   - **Region X:** Area of the smallest circle.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{X} = 16\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Region Y:** Area between the middle circle and the smallest circle.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{Y} = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Region Z:** Area between the largest circle and the middle circle.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{Z} = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n     \\]\n\n"
