            "output": "I need to find a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84 and has the smallest possible sum.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 84 to understand its prime components. 84 can be broken down into 2 × 2 × 3 × 7, which means the prime factors are 2², 3¹, and 7¹.\n\nNext, I'll consider distributing these prime factors into different integers. Since the goal is to minimize the sum, I should aim to make the integers as close to each other as possible, as this tends to result in a smaller overall sum.\n\nLet me try creating a set with three integers. If I use 2, 3, and 14 (since 2 × 7 = 14), the product is 2 × 3 × 14 = 84, and the sum is 2 + 3 + 14 = 19.\n\nAnother possible set could be 4, 3, and 7. The product is 4 × 3 × 7 = 84, and the sum is 4 + 3 + 7 = 14, which is lower.\n\nFinally, I'll check if using four integers can give a smaller sum. Possible integers could be 2, 3, 2, and 7, but since the integers must be distinct, this isn't allowed. Therefore, the set with 4, 3, and 7 provides the minimal sum of 14.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84** into its prime components: \\(84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n\n2. **Distribute these prime factors** into distinct positive integers such that their product is 84 and their sum is minimized.\n\n3. **Evaluate different sets of integers** and calculate their sums to find the minimum.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - \\(84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\)\n   - We need to combine these factors into distinct integers.\n\n2. **Possible Sets of Integers:**\n   - **Set 1:** \\(2, 3, 14\\) (since \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\))\n     - Product: \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 14 = 84\\)\n    "
