            "output": "To determine the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime components. Breaking it down, 84 equals 2 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 7. This gives me a prime factorization of \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n\nNext, I'll aim to distribute these prime factors into distinct integers such that their product is 84. The goal is to minimize the sum, so I should avoid creating larger numbers if possible. \n\nOne effective strategy is to use as many small numbers as possible. Starting with the smallest positive integers, I'll attempt to assign factors to each number without repeating any. \n\nFirst, I'll allocate the smallest prime factors to the numbers. Since 2 is the smallest prime factor, I'll assign it to the first number. This gives me the number 2. \n\nNow, with the remaining factors, I'll move on to the next number. The next smallest prime factor is 2, but since I need distinct integers, I can't use 2 again. Instead, I'll multiply the remaining 2 by 3 to create the number 6. \n\nFinally, I'll assign the remaining prime factor, which is 7, to the third number. This gives me the number 7.\n\nCompiling these, the set of distinct integers is {2, 6, 7}. Calculating their sum, 2 + 6 + 7 equals 15.\n\nI'll also consider if combining the factors differently could yield a smaller sum. For instance, if I combine 2 and 2, I get 4, resulting in the set {4, 3, 7} with a sum of 14. However, this set doesn't include the number 2, which is smaller. \n\nAnother possibility is to include the number 1, but since 1 doesn't affect the product, including it allows me to use smaller numbers. Trying this, the set {1, 2, 6, 7} has a product of 84 and a sum of 16, which is larger than 15.\n\nAfter evaluating different combinations, the set {2, 6, 7} provides the smallest possible sum of 15.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we'll explore different combinations"
