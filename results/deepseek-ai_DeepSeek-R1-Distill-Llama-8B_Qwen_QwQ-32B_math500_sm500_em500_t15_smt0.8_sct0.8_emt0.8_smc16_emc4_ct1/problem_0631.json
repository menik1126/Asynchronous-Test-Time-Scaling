            "output": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2]. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to zero because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x for which (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I need to solve the inequality (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0. Hmm, that looks like a difference of squares. I remember that a difference of squares can be factored as (A - B)(A + B), where A and B are expressions. Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me set A = (x - 3) and B = (x - 8). Then, the expression becomes A^2 - B^2, which factors into (A - B)(A + B). So, substituting back in, it's ( (x - 3) - (x - 8) ) * ( (x - 3) + (x - 8) ). Let me simplify each part.\n\nFirst, let's compute (A - B): (x - 3) - (x - 8). That simplifies to x - 3 - x + 8. The x terms cancel out: x - x is 0, and -3 + 8 is 5. So, that becomes 5.\n\nNext, compute (A + B): (x - 3) + (x - 8). That's x - 3 + x - 8. Combining like terms: x + x is 2x, and -3 -8 is -11. So, this simplifies to 2x - 11.\n\nPutting it all together, the difference of squares factors into 5*(2x - 11). So, our inequality is now 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0.\n\nI can divide both sides by 5 because 5 is positive, and dividing by a positive number doesn't"

Then, divide both sides by 2: x ≥ 11/2.\n\nWait a second, so the expression inside the square root is non-negative when x ≥ 11/2, which is 5.5. Therefore, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to 11/2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the smallest real number x in the domain. Since x must be greater than or equal to 11/2, the smallest x would be 11/2 itself.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. Let's check each part again.\n\n1. The expression inside sqrt must be ≥0: Correct.\n2. Factoring as difference of squares: Correct, with A = x -3 and B = x -8.\n3. Simplifying (A - B): (x -3) - (x -8) = 5. Correct.\n4. Simplifying (A + B): (x -3) + (x -8) = 2x -11. Correct.\n5. So, 5*(2x -11) ≥0: Correct.\n6. Dividing by 5: 2x -11 ≥0: Correct.\n7. Solving: x ≥11/2: Correct. 11/2 is 5.5.\n8. Therefore, the smallest x is 11/2.\n\nLet me double-check by plugging x = 11/2 into the original expression to ensure it's non-negative.\n\nCompute (x - 3)^2 - (x -8)^2 at x = 11/2.\n\nFirst, (11/2 -3) = (11/2 -6/2) = 5/2. Square is (25/4).\n\nSecond, (11/2 -8) = (11/2 -16/2) = (-5/2). Square is (25/4).\n\nSo, (25/4) - (25/4) = 0. Perfect, it's exactly zero. Which is allowed because sqrt(0) is defined.\n\nIf I pick x just below "

That confirms that x must be at least 11/2.\n\nSo, there's no x smaller than 11/2 in the domain because for any x less than that, the expression inside the square root becomes negative. Therefore, 11/2 is indeed the smallest real number in the domain.\n\nI think that covers all the steps. It's pretty straightforward once you factor the difference of squares. I was initially worried I might have made a mistake with the signs or the algebra, but checking each step and plugging the number back in helped me confirm that I was correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \\), we first need to ensure the expression inside the square root is non-negative.\n\n1. Set up the inequality:\n   \\[\n   (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   \n2. Factor the expression using the difference of squares:\n   \\[\n   [(x - 3) - (x - 8)][(x - 3) + (x - 8)] \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   \n3.
