            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2]. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x for which (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 is greater than or equal to zero.\n\nAlright, let's write that inequality down:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0.\n\nNow, I remember that a^2 - b^2 can be factored as (a - b)(a + b). So maybe I can apply that here. Let me try expanding both squares first to see if that helps.\n\nExpanding (x - 3)^2 gives me x^2 - 6x + 9, and expanding (x - 8)^2 gives me x^2 - 16x + 64. Now, subtracting these two, I get:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) = x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64.\n\nSimplifying that, the x^2 terms cancel out, so I have:\n\n(-6x + 9) + (16x - 64) = (10x - 55).\n\nWait, so the expression simplifies to 10x - 55. Hmm, that's a lot simpler! So, our inequality now is:\n\n10x - 55 ≥ 0.\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\n10x - 55 ≥ 0\n\nAdding 55 to both sides:\n\n10x ≥ 55\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\nx ≥ 5.5\n\nSo, the domain of g(x) is x ≥ 5.5. Therefore, the smallest real number x in the domain would be 5.5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the original expression:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2.\n\nI expanded both"

So, 10x -55. That seems right.\n\nThen, solving 10x -55 ≥0:\n\n10x ≥55 → x ≥5.5. So, the smallest x is 5.5, which is 11/2 or 5.5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when x =5.5, the expression inside the square root is zero, so it's allowed. So, is 5.5 the smallest x? Because for x less than 5.5, the expression inside would be negative, which isn't allowed. So, yes, the domain starts at 5.5, including it.\n\nHmm, so the minimal x is 5.5, which is 11/2. So, I can write that as either 5.5 or 11/2, depending on the preference. Since the question asks for the smallest real number, both representations are correct, but perhaps as a fraction, 11/2 is more precise.\n\nWait, let me check if I can do it another way, maybe by factoring the original expression without expanding. Let's try that.\n\nWe have (x -3)^2 - (x -8)^2. As I thought earlier, a^2 - b^2 factors into (a - b)(a + b). So, here, a is (x -3) and b is (x -8), so:\n\n[(x -3) - (x -8)] * [(x -3) + (x -8)] ≥0.\n\nLet's compute each bracket.\n\nFirst bracket: (x -3) - (x -8) = x -3 -x +8 = (x -x) + (-3 +8) = 5.\n\nSecond bracket: (x -3) + (x -8) = x -3 +x -8 = 2x -11.\n\nSo, the inequality becomes: 5 * (2x -11) ≥0.\n\nNow, since 5 is"

So, the domain is x ≥5.5, so the smallest real number in the domain is 5.5. Therefore, the answer is 11/2 or 5.5. Since the question says \"real number\", either is fine, but boxed, probably as a fraction. Let me check if 11/2 is 5.5. Yes, so either way is correct, but maybe the problem expects fractional form. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the factoring step? Let me check again.\n\nFirst bracket: (x -3) - (x -8) = x -3 -x +8 = 5. Correct.\n\nSecond bracket: (x -3) + (x -8) = 2x -11. Correct. So, 5*(2x -11) ≥0. Yep, so 2x -11 ≥0. So, x ≥11/2. So, that's 5.5. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal x is 11/2. So, the answer is 11/2. I think that's the way to present it in boxed form.\n\nWait, but let me also check with plugging in x =5.5 into the original expression to confirm.\n\nCompute (5.5 -3)^2 - (5.5 -8)^2.\n\nFirst term: (2.5)^2 = 6.25\n\nSecond term: (-2.5)^2 = 6.25\n\nSo, 6.25 -6.25 =0. So sqrt(0)=0, which is okay. So, x=5.5 is allowed.\n\nWhat about x=5? Let's see:\n\n(5-3)^2 - (5-8)^2 = (2)^2 - (-3)^2 =4 -9 = -5. Negative, so not allowed. So, 5 is too small.\n\nx=5.5 is the first point where it's zero, so that's the minimum x. So, I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore,"
