            "output": "First, I recognize that dividing a polynomial like \\( x^6 - 3 \\) by \\( x + 1 \\) will involve polynomial long division.\n\nI'll set up the division: \\( x + 1 \\) goes into \\( x^6 \\) how many times? Since the highest power of \\( x \\) in \\( x + 1 \\) is 1, it will go into \\( x^6 \\) \\( x^5 \\) times.\n\nNext, I'll multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^5 \\) to get \\( x^6 + x^5 \\). Then, I'll subtract this from the original polynomial to eliminate the \\( x^6 \\) term, leaving me with \\( -x^5 \\).\n\nI'll repeat this process, determining how many times \\( x + 1 \\) goes into \\( -x^5 \\). It goes \\( -x^4 \\) times. Multiplying \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( -x^4 \\) gives \\( -x^5 - x^4 \\), and subtracting this from the current polynomial results in \\( x^4 \\).\n\nContinuing, \\( x + 1 \\) goes into \\( x^4 \\) \\( x^3 \\) times. Multiplying \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^3 \\) yields \\( x^4 + x^3 \\), and subtracting this leaves \\( -x^3 \\).\n\nThis pattern will continue, with \\( x + 1 \\) successively dividing into the highest remaining term each time, producing a sequence of quotients \\( x^5, -x^4, x^3, -x^2, x, 1 \\).\n\nAfter each subtraction step, the degree of the remaining polynomial decreases by one. Eventually, after six steps, the remaining polynomial will be a constant, and I'll have a remainder.\n\nFinally, combining all the quotients and the remainder, the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\) is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 2 \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\) using polynomial long division.\n\n**Step 1:"
