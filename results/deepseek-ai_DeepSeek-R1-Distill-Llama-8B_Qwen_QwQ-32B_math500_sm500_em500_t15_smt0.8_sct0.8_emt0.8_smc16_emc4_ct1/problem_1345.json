Since synthetic division is quicker, I'll use that method.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the synthetic division with the root \\( -1 \\) and the coefficients of the dividend polynomial: 1 (for \\( x^6 \\)), 0 (since there's no \\( x^5 \\) term), 0 (for \\( x^4 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^3 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^2 \\)), 0 (for \\( x \\)), and -3 (the constant term).\n\nNext, I'll bring down the first coefficient and multiply it by -1, then add it to the next coefficient. I'll repeat this process for each term until I reach the end of the coefficients. The final coefficients obtained will give me the quotient polynomial, and the last number calculated will be the remainder.\n\nAfter performing the synthetic division, the quotient polynomial is \\( x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x - 1 \\) with a remainder of -4. Therefore, the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\) is \\( x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x - 1 \\) plus the remainder over \\( x + 1 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\), we can use **synthetic division**. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Synthetic Division\n- **Dividend**: \\( x^6 - 3 \\)\n- **Divisor**: \\( x + 1 \\), so the root is \\( -1 \\).\n- **Coefficients** of the dividend: \\( 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3 \\) (since there are no \\( x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2, x \\) terms).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r|ccccccc}\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -3 \\\\\n\\hline\n & 1 & -1 & 1 &"
