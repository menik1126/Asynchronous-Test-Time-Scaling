It seems a bit complex with all these numbers and subjects, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me try to list out all the information given:\n\n1. Total students: 360.\n2. 15 students take calculus, physics, and chemistry (so that's the intersection of all three).\n3. 15 students don't take any of them, so they are outside all three subjects.\n4. 180 students take calculus.\n5. Twice as many students take chemistry as take physics.\n6. 75 students take both calculus and chemistry.\n7. 75 students take both physics and chemistry.\n8. Only 30 take both physics and calculus.\n\nHmm, okay, so I think I can use a Venn diagram to visualize this. There are three subjects: calculus (C), physics (P), and chemistry (Ch). Each student can be in any combination of these subjects or none.\n\nLet me note down the given numbers:\n\n- Total students: 360\n- Students not taking any: 15, so students taking at least one subject: 360 - 15 = 345.\n\n- C = 180 (total taking calculus)\n- 15 take all three: C, P, Ch.\n- 75 take both C and Ch.\n- 75 take both P and Ch.\n- 30 take both P and C.\n- Let me note that the number taking Ch is twice the number taking P. So if I let P = x, then Ch = 2x.\n\nWait, so if Ch = 2x, then the number taking both P and Ch would be related to both. Hmm, but how?\n\nLet me try to structure the information in a table or something.\n\nFirst, let's note the overlaps.\n\nWe have students in C, P, Ch, and their overlaps.\n\nSince 15 take all three, that part is given. So the center of the Venn diagram where all three overlap is 15.\n\nThen, the overlaps between two subjects:\n\n- C and Ch: 75\n- P and Ch: 75\n- P and C: 30\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused here because the intersection of C and Ch is 75, but 15 of them also take P. Similarly, the intersection of P and Ch is"

            "output": " 75, but again 15 are in all three. So maybe the numbers given for the two-way overlaps include those who are in all three?\n\nYes, I think that's how it works. So for example, the number of students taking both C and Ch is 75, which includes those who also take P. So the number taking only C and Ch would be 75 - 15 = 60. Similarly, the number taking only P and Ch would be 75 - 15 = 60, and the number taking only P and C would be 30 - 15 = 15.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The intersection of C and P is 30, which includes those who also take Ch. Since 15 are in all three, then the number taking only C and P is 30 - 15 = 15. Similarly, the intersection of C and Ch is 75, so subtract the 15 in all three to get 60 taking only C and Ch. Same with P and Ch: 75 total, minus 15 gives 60 only P and Ch.\n\nOkay, so now, let's denote the regions of the Venn diagram:\n\nLet me use variables for the different regions:\n\n- Only C: a\n- Only P: b\n- Only Ch: c\n- Only C and P: d = 15 (since total C\u2229P is 30, minus 15 in all three)\n- Only C and Ch: e = 60 (since total C\u2229Ch is 75, minus 15)\n- Only P and Ch: f = 60 (similar logic)\n- All three: g = 15\n- None: 15\n\nTotal students in at least one subject: a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 345.\n\nWe also know the total for each subject:\n\nCalculus (C): a + d + e + g = 180\n\nPhysics (P): b + d + f + g = ?\n\nChemistry (Ch): c + e + f + g = ?\n\nGiven that the number taking Chemistry is twice that taking Physics. Let me denote the total Physics as P_total = b + d + f + g. Then Chemistry total is 2*P_total"
