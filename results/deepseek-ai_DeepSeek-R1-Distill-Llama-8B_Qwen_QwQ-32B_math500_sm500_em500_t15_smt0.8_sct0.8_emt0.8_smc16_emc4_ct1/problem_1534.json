This is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way to have the sum of squares fixed at 144 is to have all terms equal, so n must be 64.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of Lagrange multipliers. Suppose we want to find the minimal n such that there exists a sequence of n positive numbers with the given sums. But since we already have n=64, which is the minimal possible, and the problem asks for all possible n, maybe there are other n's where you can have the same sums by having some terms larger and some smaller.\n\nWait, but the problem requires the sum of cubes to be exactly 216. Since the cube function is convex, the sum of cubes is minimized when all terms are equal. So, if you have any variation, the sum of cubes would increase. But in our problem, the sum of cubes is"
