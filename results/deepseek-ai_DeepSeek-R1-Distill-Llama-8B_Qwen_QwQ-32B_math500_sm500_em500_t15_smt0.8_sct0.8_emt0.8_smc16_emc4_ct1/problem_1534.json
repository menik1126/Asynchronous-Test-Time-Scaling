Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given:\n\n1. The sum of the sequence: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n2. The sum of the squares of the sequence: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n3. The sum of the cubes of the sequence: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, we have three equations involving the sums of \\( a_i \\), \\( a_i^2 \\), and \\( a_i^3 \\). I'm trying to think if there's a way to relate these sums to each other or to some known identities or theorems.\n\nWait, maybe the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality could be helpful here since it relates sums of squares and products. But before jumping into inequalities, perhaps I should consider the possibility that all the \\( a_i \\)s are equal. That often simplifies things.\n\nIf all \\( a_i \\)s were equal, then each \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\). Let me plug that into the other equations.\n\nSum of squares would be \\( n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9216}{n} \\). According to the problem, this equals 144. So:\n\n\\( \\frac{9216}{n} = 144 \\)\n\nSolve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\( n = \\frac{9216}{144} \\)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\( 144 \\times 64 = 9216 \\), so \\( n = 64 \\).\n\nWait, is 64 a possible value of \\( n \\)? Let me check the sum of cubes then.\n\nIf all \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{64} = \\frac{3}{2} \\), then the sum of cubes is \\( 64 \\times \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right)^3 \\).\n\nCalculating:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{3}{2"

So, if all \\( a_i = \\frac{3}{2} \\), then all three conditions are satisfied with \\( n = 64 \\). So, 64 is a possible value.\n\nBut the question says \"the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\)\", so there might be more than one. I need to check if there are other values of \\( n \\) possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \\( a_i \\)s are not all equal. Let me think. Suppose that there are two different numbers repeating, say \\( k \\) times \\( x \\) and \\( m \\) times \\( y \\), such that \\( k + m = n \\). Then, perhaps I can model the problem in terms of two variables.\n\nLet me try that. Let's say we have two distinct numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), with \\( k \\) instances of \\( x \\) and \\( m \\) instances of \\( y \\). So, \\( k + m = n \\).\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\n1. \\( kx + my = 96 \\)\n2. \\( kx^2 + my^2 = 144 \\)\n3. \\( kx^3 + my^3 = 216 \\)\n\nSo now, I have three equations with variables \\( k, m, x, y \\).\n\nHmm, that seems complicated because I have more variables than equations. Maybe I can find relationships between them. Let me think about how to relate these.\n\nLet me consider equations 1 and 2. Let me denote \\( S_1 = 96 \\), \\( S_2 = 144 \\), \\( S_3 = 216 \\).\n\nI can also think about the variance or some measure of spread. Since variance is related to the mean and the sum of squares, maybe I can compute the variance here.\n\nBut wait, variance is \\( \\frac{S_2}{n} - (\\text{mean})^2 \\). Let's compute that.\n\nThe mean \\( \\mu = \\frac{96}{n} \\).\n\nSo, variance \\( \\sigma^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\mu^2 = \\frac{144}{n}"

But in the case where all terms are equal, variance is zero, which is allowed. So, if \\( n = 64 \\), variance is zero, which is okay. If \\( n > 64 \\), then variance can be positive. But if \\( n < 64 \\), variance would be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, \\( n \\geq 64 \\).\n\nHmm, so that gives a lower bound on \\( n \\). So, possible values of \\( n \\) must be integers greater than or equal to 64. But the problem says \"sum of all possible values of \\( n \\)\", so maybe there are multiple \\( n \\geq 64 \\) that satisfy the conditions?\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this.

So, \\( n \\) must be at least 64.\n\nBut does this necessarily mean that \\( n = 64 \\) is the only possible value, or could there be other values?\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nSuppose that \\( n > 64 \\). Then, the mean \\( \\mu = 96/n \\) is less than \\( 96/64 = 1.5 \\). The sum of squares is 144, so the mean of the squares is \\( 144/n \\), and since \\( n > 64 \\), that mean is less than \\( 144/64 = 2.25 \\). So, the variance \\( \\sigma^2 = 144/n - (96/n)^2 \\). Since \\( n > 64 \\), \\( 144/n \\) decreases slower than \\( (96/n)^2 \\), so \\( \\sigma^2 \\) is positive, which is okay.\n\nBut the question is whether such a set of numbers exists for \\( n > 64 \\). Maybe, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the \\( a_i \\) have to be equal? Why? Because if the variance is positive, i.e., not all \\( a_i \\) are equal, maybe we can have another configuration.\n\nWait, but without more constraints, it's hard to say. Let me see if another \\( n \\) is possible.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 72 \\). Then, the sum is 96, so the mean is \\( 96/72 = 1.\\overline{3} \\). Then, the sum of squares is 144, so the mean of squares is \\( 144/72 = 2 \\). Hence, variance is \\( 2 - (1.\\"

Thus, n = 64 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try another configuration where two variables are different.\n\nSuppose that we have two variables, say, one variable is different, and another variable is different from the rest. Wait, but that's similar to what I tried before.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that two variables are higher and the rest are lower. Let me think if that can yield another solution.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think about the equality condition in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nWait, another thought: the given sums S1, S2, S3 are in arithmetic progression as well as geometric progression when scaled.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nS1 = 96, S2 = 144, S3 = 216\n\nCompute ratios: 144 / 96 = 1.5, 216 / 144 = 1.5.\n\nSo, each next sum is 1.5 times the previous. So, S1, S2, S3 form a geometric progression with ratio 1.5.\n\nThat's interesting.\n\nBut how does that relate to the sums of powers of variables?\n\nHmm, in general, if all variables are equal, then their sum, sum of squares, etc., would form a certain progression.\n\nBut in this case, the sums themselves form a geometric progression.\n\nWait, if all \\( a_i \\) are equal, then \\( S2 = n \\times (S1/n)^2 = (S1"
