            "output": "I see that the problem involves the ratio of blue to yellow marbles in a bag. Initially, the ratio is 4:3. \n\nFirst, I'll define variables for the number of marbles. Let’s say the number of blue marbles is 4x and the number of yellow marbles is 3x. This maintains the initial ratio.\n\nNext, the problem states that after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3. So, the new number of blue marbles is 4x + 5, and the new number of yellow marbles is 3x - 3.\n\nI can set up an equation based on the new ratio:\n(4x + 5) / (3x - 3) = 7 / 3\n\nCross-multiplying gives 3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\nCombining like terms:\n21x - 12x = 15 + 21  \n9x = 36  \nx = 4\n\nFinally, the initial number of blue marbles is 4x, which is 4 * 4 = 16.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's denote the number of blue marbles as \\(4x\\) and the number of yellow marbles as \\(3x\\) initially. This maintains the given ratio of \\(4:3\\) for blue to yellow marbles.\n\nAfter adding \\(5\\) blue marbles and removing \\(3\\) yellow marbles, the new number of blue marbles becomes \\(4x + 5\\) and the new number of yellow marbles becomes \\(3x - 3\\). According to the problem, the new ratio becomes \\(7:3\\). We can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.\n\n\\[\n3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Distribute the multiplication on both sides.\n\n\\[\n12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Bring like terms together.\n\n\\[\n21x - 12"
