Let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles initially in the bag.\n\nFrom the given ratio, I can write the equation B/Y = 4/3. This means 4 blue marbles correspond to 3 yellow marbles.\n\nNext, I'll express B in terms of Y using the ratio. So, B = (4/3) * Y.\n\nThen, I'll consider the changes made to the marbles. By adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new number of blue marbles becomes B + 5 and the new number of yellow marbles becomes Y - 3.\n\nThe new ratio is given as (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3. I'll substitute B from the earlier equation into this new ratio to solve for Y.\n\nAfter substituting and simplifying, I'll find the value of Y, which represents the initial number of yellow marbles. Finally, I'll calculate the initial number of blue marbles using B = (4/3) * Y.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = Number of blue marbles initially\n- \\( Y \\) = Number of yellow marbles initially\n\n**Given:**\n1. The initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( \\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n2. After adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes \\( \\frac{B + 5}{Y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3} \\).\n\n**Step 1:** Express \\( B \\) in terms of \\( Y \\) from the first ratio.\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\implies B = \\frac{4}{3}Y\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute \\( B \\) into the second ratio.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}Y + 5}{Y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.\n\\[\n3\\left(\\frac{4}{3}Y + 5\\right) = 7(Y - 3)\n\\]\n\\[\n4Y + "
