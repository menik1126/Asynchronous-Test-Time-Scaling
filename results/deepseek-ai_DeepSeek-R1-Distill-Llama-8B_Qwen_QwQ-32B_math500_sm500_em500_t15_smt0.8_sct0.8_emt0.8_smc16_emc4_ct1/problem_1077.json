The first term is 0.\n\nThe second term is obtained by adding 1 to the first term, so 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe third term is obtained by multiplying the second term by 1, so 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nThe fourth term is obtained by adding 2 to the third term, so 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThe fifth term is obtained by multiplying the fourth term by 2, so 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nThe sixth term is obtained by adding 3 to the fifth term, so 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nThe seventh term is obtained by multiplying the sixth term by 3, so 9 * 3 = 27.\n\nContinuing this pattern helps identify the operations alternately applied with each successive integer starting from 1.\n\nNow, to find the first term greater than 125, I'll list the terms step by step using the defined operations until I surpass 125.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the given sequence step by step to determine the first term that exceeds 125.\n\n### Understanding the Sequence\nThe sequence starts with **0**. Subsequent terms are generated by **alternately adding and multiplying** by each successive integer beginning with **1**.\n\n- **Term 1:** 0\n- **Term 2:** Add 1 → 0 + 1 = **1**\n- **Term 3:** Multiply by 1 → 1 × 1 = **1**\n- **Term 4:** Add 2 → 1 + 2 = **3**\n- **Term 5:** Multiply by 2 → 3 × 2 = **6**\n- **Term 6:** Add 3 → 6 + 3 = **9**\n- **Term 7:** Multiply by 3 → 9 × 3 = **27**\n- **Term 8:** Add 4 → 27 + 4 = **31**\n- **Term 9:** Multiply by 4 → 31 × 4 = **124**\n- **Term 10:** Add 5 → 124 + 5 = **129**\n\n### Identifying the First Term Greater Than 125\nFrom the above, **Term 10** is **129**, which is the first term in the sequence greater than 125.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{129}"

    "question": "In the sequence 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, ..., the first term is 0.   Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and  multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1.  For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.  What is the value of the first term that is greater than 125?",
