Starting from the second term, the operations alternate between addition and multiplication using successive integers starting from 1.\n\nLet me list out the operations step by step to identify the pattern:\n\n- Term 1: 0\n- Term 2: 0 + 1 = 1\n- Term 3: 1 \u00d7 1 = 1\n- Term 4: 1 + 2 = 3\n- Term 5: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n- Term 6: 6 + 3 = 9\n- Term 7: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27\n- Term 8: 27 + 4 = 31\n- Term 9: 31 \u00d7 4 = 124\n- Term 10: 124 + 5 = 129\n- Term 11: 129 \u00d7 5 = 645\n- Term 12: 645 + 6 = 651\n- Term 13: 651 \u00d7 6 = 3906\n- Term 14: 3906 + 7 = 3913\n- Term 15: 3913 \u00d7 7 = 27391\n- Term 16: 27391 + 8 = 274,  8? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nWait, let me double-check Term 16:\nTerm 15 is 27391.\nTerm 16: 27391 + 8 = 274,  8? Wait, that can't be right. Actually, 27391 + 8 is 274,  8? No, 27,391 + 8 is 27,399.\n\nTerm 17: 27399 \u00d7 8 = 219,192\nTerm 18: 219,192 + 9 = 219,201\nTerm 19: 219,201 \u00d7 9 = 1,971,809\nTerm 20: 1,971,809 + 10 = 1,971,819\nTerm 21: 1,971,819 \u00d7 10 = 19,718,190\nTerm 22: 19,718,190 + 11"

Wait, that's not correct. Calculating 33,909,517,591 \u00d7 14 is a large number.\n\nI notice that the numbers are growing rapidly. Since we are looking for the first term greater than 125, I'll check each term until I find the one that exceeds 125.\n\nReviewing the terms:\n\n- Term 1: 0\n- Term 2: 1\n- Term 3: 1\n- Term 4: 3\n- Term 5: 6\n- Term 6: 9\n- Term 7: 27\n- Term 8: 31\n- Term 9: 124\n- Term 10: 129\n\nTerm 10 is 129, which is greater than 125.

Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1. For instance, the second term is produced by adding 1 to the first term; the third term is produced by multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so on. What is the value of the first term that is greater than 125?\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Sequence:**\n   - The sequence starts with **0**.\n   - From the second term"
