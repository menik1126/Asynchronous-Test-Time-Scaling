Therefore, Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\nBy multiplying the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has after Yann's selection, we calculate the total number of unique combinations: 10 multiplied by 9 equals 90.\n\nThis calculation assumes that the order in which they choose their dishes matters, as specified in the problem.\n\nThus, there are 90 different meal combinations they can have.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n- **Total dishes on the menu:** 10\n- **Condition:** Yann and Camille refuse to order the same dish.\n- **Order matters:** (Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Choices for Each Person**\n- **Yann's Choices:** Since there are 10 dishes and no restrictions initially, Yann has **10** options.\n- **Camille's Choices:** After Yann has chosen, Camille cannot choose the same dish. Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining options.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Combinations**\n- Since the order matters, we multiply the number of choices for Yann by the number of choices for Camille.\n  \n\\[\n\\text{Total Combinations} = \\text{Choices for Yann} \\times \\text{Choices for Camille} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
