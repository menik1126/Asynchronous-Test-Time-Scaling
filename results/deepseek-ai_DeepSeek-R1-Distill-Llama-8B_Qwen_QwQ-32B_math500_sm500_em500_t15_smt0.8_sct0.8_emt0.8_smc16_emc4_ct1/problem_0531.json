            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of possible choices each person has. There are 10 different dishes on the menu.\n\nSince both Yann and Camille refuse to order the same dish, I must calculate the number of combinations where their choices are unique.\n\nI can start by considering all the possible pairs of dishes they could order. For each dish that Yann chooses, Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\nSo, the total number of unique combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n\nAdditionally, since the order matters (Yann and Camille are distinct individuals), there are no duplicates, and each combination is unique.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different meal combinations they can order is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - **Restaurants Menu:** 10 different dishes.\n   - **Ordering Rules:**\n     - Each person must order one dish.\n     - They refuse to order the same dish.\n     - The order matters (Yann ordering Chicken and Camille ordering Fish is different from Yann ordering Fish and Camille ordering Chicken).\n\n2. **Calculate the Possible Combinations:**\n   - **First, choose a dish for Yann:** There are **10** possible dishes.\n   - **Second, choose a different dish for Camille:** After Yann has chosen, Camille has **9** remaining options.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Combinations:**\n   - Multiply the number of choices for each person:\n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{90}\n   \\]\n\n**Summary:** Yann and Camille have a total of **90** different meal combinations they can order without selecting the same dish."

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
