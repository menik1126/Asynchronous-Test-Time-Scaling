            "output": "First, I need to find a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84 and determine the set with the smallest possible sum.\n\nI'll start by factoring 84 to understand its prime components.\n\n84 can be factored into 2 × 2 × 3 × 7, which means the prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nNext, I'll consider different combinations of these prime factors and other distinct positive integers to see which combination gives a product of 84.\n\nOne possible set is {2, 3, 7}, which multiplies to 2 × 3 × 7 = 84. The sum of these numbers is 2 + 3 + 7 = 12.\n\nAnother set could include the number 4, which is 2 × 2. So the set {2, 3, 4, 7} multiplies to 2 × 3 × 4 × 7 = 336, which is more than 84, so that's not valid.\n\nIf I include 6, which is 2 × 3, the set {6, 7} multiplies to 6 × 7 = 42, which is less than 84. To reach the target, I would need to add another number, but that would exceed the product.\n\nTherefore, the set {2, 3, 7} with a sum of 12 is the smallest possible sum that meets the criteria.\n</think>\n\nLet's find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84.\n\n**Step 1: Factorize 84**\nFirst, factorize 84 into its prime factors:\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\nSo, the prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Possible Sets**\nWe need to find distinct positive integers whose product is 84. Consider the following sets:\n\n1. **Set A:** \\{2, 3, 7\\}\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 42 \\quad (\\text{This is not } 84)\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set B:** \\{2, 3, 7, 1\\}\n   \\[\n   1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 42 \\quad (\\"
