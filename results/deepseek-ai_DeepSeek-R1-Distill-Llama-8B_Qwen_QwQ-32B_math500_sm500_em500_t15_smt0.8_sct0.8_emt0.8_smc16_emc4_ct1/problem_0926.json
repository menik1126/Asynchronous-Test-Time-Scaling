To achieve the smallest sum, the integers should be as close to each other as possible.\n\nFirst, I'll assign the largest prime factor, 7, to a single integer. Then, I'll distribute the remaining factors: 2 and 3 into two separate integers. This gives me the numbers 7, 2, and 3, with a sum of 12.\n\nI notice that splitting the factor of 4 into two 2s might allow for a smaller sum if possible, but in this case, it doesn't reduce the total sum below 12.\n\nFinally, by ensuring all integers are distinct and their product equals 84, the minimum sum is determined to be 12.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84:**\n   \\[\n   84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distribute the factors to form distinct integers:**\n   - To minimize the sum, it's best to have the integers as close to each other as possible.\n   - Start by assigning the largest prime factor to one integer:\n     \\[\n     7\n     \\]\n   - Next, assign the remaining factors to other integers:\n     \\[\n     2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2 \\times 3 = 6\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the sum:**\n   \\[\n   7 + 2 + 6 = 15\n   \\]\n\n4. **Improve the distribution:**\n   - Instead of \\(6\\) and \\(2\\), try combining the factors differently:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 2 = 6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2\n     \\]\n     This gives the same sum of \\(15\\).\n\n5. **Optimize further:**\n   - Try another distribution:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 2 = "
