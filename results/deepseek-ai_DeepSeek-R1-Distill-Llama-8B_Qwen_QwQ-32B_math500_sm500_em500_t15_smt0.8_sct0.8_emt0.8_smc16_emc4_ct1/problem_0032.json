            "output": "To determine the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284, I'll start by finding the proper divisors of 284.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 284. Breaking it down, I find that 284 divided by 2 equals 142, and 142 divided by 2 is 71, which is a prime number. Thus, the prime factors of 284 are 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p\u207f + p\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + ... + p), I'll calculate the sum of all divisors of 284:\n(2\u00b2 + 2\u00b9) \u00d7 (71\u00b9) = (4 + 2) \u00d7 71 = 6 \u00d7 71 = 426.\n\nNext, I'll identify the proper divisors of 426. These include 1, 2, 3, 6, 71, 142, and 213.\n\nFinally, I'll sum these proper divisors:\n1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 71 + 142 + 213 = 438.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 438.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Find the Proper Divisors of 284**\n   \n   - **Prime Factorization of 284**:\n     \\[\n     284 \\div 2 = 142 \\\\\n     142 \\div 2 = 71 \\quad (\\text{71 is a prime number})\n     \\]\n     So, \\( 284 = 2^2 \\times 71^1 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of All Divisors (Including 284) Using the Sum of Divisors Formula**:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma(284) = (2^2 + 2^1) \\times (71^1) = (4 + 2) \\times 71 = 6 \\times 71 = 426\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Find the Proper Divisors of 426**:\n   \n   - Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number excluding the number itself.\n   - To find them, factorize 426:\n     \\[\n     426 = 2 \\times 213 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 71 \n     \\]\n"
