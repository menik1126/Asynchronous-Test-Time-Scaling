That sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that proper divisors of a number are all the positive divisors excluding the number itself. So, for 12, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Got it. So, for any number N, the proper divisors are numbers less than N that divide N without leaving a remainder.\n\nOkay, so the first step is to find the proper divisors of 284. Let me start by factoring 284 to make this easier. I think 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Let me check: 284 divided by 2 is 142. So, 2 is a divisor. Now, 142 is also even, so dividing by 2 again gives me 71. Hmm, is 71 a prime number? Let me think. Yes, I believe 71 is a prime number because it doesn't have any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2^2 * 71^1. Now, to find the sum of the proper divisors, I can use the formula for the sum of divisors. The formula is: for a number n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, the sum of divisors is (1 + p1 + p1^2 + ... + p1^a1) * (1 + p2 + ... + p2^a2) * ... * (1 + pk + ... + pk^ak).\n\nBut since we need the sum of proper divisors, I need to subtract the number itself from the total sum of divisors. So, let me calculate the sum of all divisors first.\n\nFor 284, the prime factors are 2^2 and 71^1. So, the sum of divisors is (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 71). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\n1 + 71 = 72\n\nNow, multiply 7 and 72: 7 * 72. Let me do that step by step:\n\n7 * "

            "output": "70 = 490\n\n7 * 2 = 14\n\nSo, 490 + 14 = 504. So, the sum of all divisors of 284 is 504.\n\nBut we need the sum of proper divisors, which excludes 284 itself. So, 504 - 284 = 220. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n\nNow, the next part is to find the sum of the proper divisors of this result, which is 220. So, I need to find the proper divisors of 220 and then sum them up.\n\nLet me factorize 220. I know 220 is 22 multiplied by 10, and 22 is 2*11, so 220 is 2^2 * 5^1 * 11^1. So, the prime factors are 2, 5, and 11 with exponents 2, 1, and 1 respectively.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again: (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 5) * (1 + 11).\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n\n1 + 5 = 6\n\n1 + 11 = 12\n\nNow, multiply them together: 7 * 6 = 42, and 42 * 12 = let me compute that.\n\n42 * 10 = 420\n\n42 * 2 = 84\n\nSo, 420 + 84 = 504.\n\nWait a second, the sum of all divisors of 220 is 504. That's the same as the sum of divisors of 284. Interesting.\n\nBut we need the sum of proper divisors, so subtract 220 from 504: 504 - 220 = 284.\n\nSo, the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284.\n\nWait, hold on. So, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, and then the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284. So, the answer would be 284.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with 284:\n\n284 = 2^2 * 71^1\n\nSum of divisors: (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 71) ="

Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, the process seems correct. I didn't miss anything. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 284.\n</think>\n\nThe proper divisors of 284 are calculated by first finding its prime factors and applying the sum of divisors formula. The prime factorization of 284 is \\(2^2 \\times 71\\). The sum of its divisors is \\(504\\), so the sum of proper divisors is \\(504 - 284 = 220\\). Next, we find the proper divisors of 220, which has a prime factorization \\(2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11\\). The sum of all divisors is \\(504\\), leading to the proper divisors sum being \\(504 - 220 = 284\\).\n\n\\boxed{284}"
