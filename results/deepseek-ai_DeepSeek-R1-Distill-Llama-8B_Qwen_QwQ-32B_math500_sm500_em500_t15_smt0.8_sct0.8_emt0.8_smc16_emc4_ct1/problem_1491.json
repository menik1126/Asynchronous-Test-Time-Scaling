This includes numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to find the intersection of these two sets. This means I'm looking for numbers that are both prime and odd.\n\nFrom the list of primes less than 30, I can see that all primes except for 2 are odd. So, the primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29 are all included in the intersection.\n\nCounting these, there are 9 prime numbers that are also odd numbers greater than zero.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Prime Numbers Less Than 30:**\n   - The prime numbers less than 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n\n2. **Identify Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero:**\n   - The set of odd numbers greater than zero is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., and so on.\n\n3. **Find the Intersection of the Two Sets:**\n   - The intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd.\n   - From the list of primes less than 30:\n     - 2 is even, so it is excluded.\n     - All other primes (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29) are odd.\n\n4. **Count the Intersection:**\n   - There are **9** prime numbers less than 30 that are also odd.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
