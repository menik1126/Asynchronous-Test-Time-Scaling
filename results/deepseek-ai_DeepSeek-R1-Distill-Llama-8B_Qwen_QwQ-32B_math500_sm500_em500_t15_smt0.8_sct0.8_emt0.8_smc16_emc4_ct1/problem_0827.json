            "output": "Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. First, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. I also recall that cube roots of unity have some specific properties. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1. Moreover, I think these roots satisfy the equation ω³ = 1, so they are the solutions to the equation x³ - 1 = 0.\n\nWait, but another way to think about cube roots of unity is that they can be represented on the complex plane as points on the unit circle at angles 0°, 120°, and 240°. So, 1 is at 0°, ω is at 120°, and ω² is at 240°. That might help me visualize or use some properties from there.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is the sum of two fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nI wonder if I can find a common denominator or manipulate these terms somehow. Alternatively, maybe using properties of cube roots of unity could simplify this expression.\n\nLet me recall that for cube roots of unity, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That's a key identity. So, maybe I can use that to simplify something.\n\nLet me write down the given expression again:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nI need to compute S. To add these two fractions, I can find a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute the numerator:\n\nNumerator = (1)(1 + ω²) + (1)(1 + ω) = (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nBut I remember that ω + ω² = -1, since"

            "output": " 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Therefore, ω + ω² = -1.\n\nSo, numerator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo, S = [1] / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].\n\nNow, I need to compute the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²).\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so that term is 1. So,\n\nDenominator = 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nAgain, I know that ω + ω² = -1, so denominator = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nWait, so denominator is 1, and numerator is 1. So S = 1 / 1 = 1.\n\nWait, that would mean S is 1 in all cases, regardless of ω. But does that make sense?\n\nLet me check with specific values. Let's choose ω = e^(2πi/3) which is (-1/2) + i(√3/2). Then, ω² is e^(4πi/3) which is (-1/2) - i(√3/2).\n\nCompute S:\n\nFirst, 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2) + i(√3/2) = 1/2 + i(√3/2). Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1/2 - i(√3/2).\n\nSo, S = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2) + 1/(1/2 - i√3/2).\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\n1/(1/2 + i√3/2) can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n1/(1/2 + i√3/2) * (1/2 - i√3/2)/(1/2 - i√3/2) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/( (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/(1/4 + 3/4 )"

So S = 1.\n\nAlternatively, if I take ω = 1, but wait, if ω =1, then the original expression would be 1/(1 +1) + 1/(1 +1) = (1/2) + (1/2) = 1. So yes, it's 1.\n\nWait, but does ω =1 is also a cube root of unity? Yes, because 1^3 =1.\n\nWait, so for all three cube roots of unity, ω, ω², and 1, the expression S is equal to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nHmm, that seems to confirm that S =1 regardless of which cube root of unity we take.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nSo, earlier steps:\n\nS = [1]/[(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].\n\nThen, denominator (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. Since ω³ =1, that is 1 + ω + ω² +1 = 2 + ω + ω². Since 1 + ω + ω²=0, then ω + ω² = -1, so denominator is 2 -1=1.\n\nTherefore, S = 1/1=1.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe only possible value is \\boxed{1}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\n\\]\n\nFirst, we note that \\(\\omega\\) is a"
