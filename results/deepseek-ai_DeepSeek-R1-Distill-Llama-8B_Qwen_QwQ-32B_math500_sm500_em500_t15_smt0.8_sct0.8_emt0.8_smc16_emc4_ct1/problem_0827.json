I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, I remember that ω being a cube root of 1 means it's a solution to the equation ω³ = 1. So, the cube roots of 1 are 1, and the two complex roots, which are usually denoted as ω and ω². These are the non-real cube roots of unity. They satisfy the equation ω³ = 1, and importantly, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. I should note that down because it might come in handy later.\n\nThe expression I need to evaluate is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, adding these two fractions. Maybe I can combine them into a single fraction? Let me think. To add them, I need a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So, let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator: 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω². Wait, but I remember that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (-1) = 1. So, the numerator simplifies to 1.\n\nNow, the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand that:\n\n(1)(1) + (1)(ω²) + (ω)(1) + (ω)(ω²) = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut since ω³ = 1, the last term is 1. So, the denominator becomes 1 + ω + ω² + 1, which simplifies to 2 + ω + ω². Again, using 1 + ω + ω² = 0, this becomes 2 +"

But hold on, ω can be either of the two complex roots, right? Let me check if this holds for both ω and ω². Maybe the expression is the same regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the value for each ω separately. Let me take ω as a primitive cube root of unity. So, ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2, and ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nLet's compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2. Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). Let me rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate, which is (1/2 - i√3/2):\n\n(1) * (1/2 - i√3/2) / [(1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = (1/2 - i√3/2) / (1/4 + 3/4) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2). Rationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1/2 + i√3/2):\n\n(1) * (1/2 + i√3/2) / [(1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nNow, adding these two results:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = (1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/"

Let me check that case.\n\nIf ω = 1, then 1 + ω = 2, so 1/(1 + ω) = 1/2. Similarly, ω² = 1, so 1 + ω² = 2, and 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/2. Adding them gives 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, even when ω = 1, the expression is 1.\n\nWait a second, so whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², the value is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially roots of unity, things can get tricky. Let me try another approach.\n\nSince we know that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we can express ω² = -1 - ω. Let me substitute that into the original expression.\n\nCompute \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nExpressing ω² as -1 - ω, so 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1 - ω) = -ω.\n\nSo, the second term becomes 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.\n\nSo, now the expression becomes:\n\n1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω.\n\nHmm, but let me compute 1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω. To combine these, find a common denominator, which would be ω(1 + ω).\n\nSo,\n\n[ω - (1 + ω)] / [ω(1 + ω)] = [ω -1 - ω] / [ω(1 + ω)] = (-1)/[ω(1 + ω)].\n\nAgain, from 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we have 1 + ω = -ω². So, substitute that in denominator:\n\n-1/[ω(-ω²)] = -1/[-ω³] = -1/[-1] because ω³ = 1. So,"

So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another method: let me let x = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\), and try to express x in terms of ω.\n\nExpressed as x = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nLet me find a common denominator:\n\nx = \\(\\frac{1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\\) as I did earlier.\n\nAs before, the numerator becomes 2 + ω + ω² = 1, and the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³ = 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω² = 1.

Let me verify:\n\nFor ω = 1: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nWait, that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, so when ω = 1, the denominator is (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 * 2 = 4, and the numerator is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. So, 4/4 = 1. That holds.\n\nWait, but in the previous case, when ω is a primitive root, (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = ?\n\nFor ω = e^(2πi/3), 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nMultiply these two: (1/2 + i√3/2)(1/2 - i√3/2) = (1/2)^2"

When ω is 1, denominator is 4, numerator is 4, so 1. So, in all cases, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is just 1. But the problem says \"find all possible values\", implying there might be more than one? But according to my calculations, it's always 1 regardless of which cube root of 1 we take. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the cube roots of 1 are 1, ω, ω². So, if we take ω as 1, then the expression is 1. If we take ω as the other roots, it's still 1. So, the expression is always 1, so the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering different substitutions? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1. Find all possible values of [expression].\" Since ω can be any of the three cube roots, but in each case, the expression evaluates to 1, so the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose someone might think that when ω is 1, the denominators become 2, so 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. When ω is a primitive root, the expression is also 1. So, in all cases, it's 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. So, the answer is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra steps. Let me try plugging in numbers again.\n\nTake ω = ω (the complex root). Let me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nSuppose ω = -1/2 + i√3/2. Then 1 + �"
