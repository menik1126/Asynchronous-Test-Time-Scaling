The constant term matches, so no additional information is needed.\n\nI'll solve the first equation for one variable in terms of the other.

Therefore, there is no integer solution for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nSince no valid integer pairs"

Let me try factoring the original quadratic.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(10 \\times (-24) = -240\\) and add to \\(-1\\). The numbers 15 and -16 work because \\(15 \\times (-16) = -240\\) and \\(15 + (-16) = -1\\).\n\nSplitting the middle term:\n\\(10x^2 + 15x - 16x -24\\)\n\nGrouping:\n\\(5x(2x + 3) -8(2x + 3)\\)\n\nFactoring out \\((2x + 3)\\):\n\\((5x -8)(2x +3)\\)\n\nThus, \\(A =5\\) and \\(B =2\\). Therefore, \\(AB + B = 5 \\times 2 + 2 = 12\\).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the expression is written as \\((Ax -8)(Bx +3)\\). Comparing with my result \\((5x -8)(2x +3)\\), so A is 5 and B is 2. Therefore, AB + B is 5*2 +2 = 12. That should be the answer.\n\nI think my initial approach had an error in solving the equations, but factoring directly worked better here. The correct values are A=5 and B=2, so the final answer is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by expanding the expression \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\).
