This gives me the equation \\(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\).\n\nNext, I expand the right-hand side of the equation. Multiplying the terms inside the parentheses, I get \\(ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24\\).\n\nNow, I compare the coefficients of corresponding terms from both sides of the equation. This means setting the coefficients of \\(x^2\\), \\(x\\), and the constant term equal to each other. So, I have three equations: \\(AB = 10\\), \\(3A - 8B = -1\\), and \\(-24 = -24\\). The last equation is always true, so it doesn't provide new information.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\(AB = 10\\), I list the factor pairs of 10: (1,10), (2,5), (-1,-10), (-2,-5). I need to find which pair satisfies the second equation, \\(3A - 8B = -1\\).\n\nI test each pair:\n- For (A=2, B=5): \\(3(2) - 8(5) = 6 - 40 = -34\\), which is not -1.\n- For (A=5, B=2): \\(3(5) - 8(2) = 15 - 16 = -1\\), which matches.\n\nTherefore, A is 5 and B is 2. Finally, I calculate \\(AB + B\\), which is \\(5 \\times 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n**Given:**\n\\[ 10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) \\]\nwhere \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are integers.\n\n**Step 1: Expand the right-hand side (RHS).**\n\n\\[\n(Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Set the expanded form equal to the original quadratic expression.**\n\n\\[\n10x^2 - x - "
