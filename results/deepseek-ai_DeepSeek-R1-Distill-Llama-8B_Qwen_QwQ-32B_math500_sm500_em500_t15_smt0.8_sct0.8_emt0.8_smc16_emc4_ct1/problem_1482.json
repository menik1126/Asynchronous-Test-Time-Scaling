Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It's the square root of the cube root of the square root of 1/729. So, in mathematical terms, that would be:\n\n√(∛(√(1/729)))\n\nAlright, let's start from the innermost part, which is the square root of 1/729. I know that the square root of a fraction is the same as the square root of the numerator divided by the square root of the denominator. So, let me calculate √(1/729).\n\nCalculating √1 is straightforward—it's 1. Then, √729 is something I should recall. Since 27 squared is 729, that means √729 is 27. So, √(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 27 times 27 is indeed 729, so yes, that's correct. So, the innermost square root simplifies to 1/27.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, we have the cube root of 1/27. Cube root of 1 is 1, and cube root of 27 is 3, because 3 times 3 times 3 is 27. So, ∛(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nHold on, that seems right. 3 cubed is 27, so taking the cube root of 1/27 gives 1/3. Cool, so that simplifies nicely.\n\nNext, we have the square root of 1/3. Again, similar to before, the square root of a fraction is the square roots of the numerator over the denominator. So, √1 is 1 and √3 is √3, so √(1/3) is 1/√3.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for a rational denominator, right? So, having a square root in the denominator isn't ideal. I remember that to rationalize the denominator, you can multiply the numerator and denominator by √3. Let me do that:\n\n(1 * √3) / (√3 * √3) = √3 / 3\n\nSo, √(1/3"

Let me make sure I didn't mix up the order.\n\nOriginal expression: sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nSo first step: sqrt(1/729) = 1/27. Then cube root of that is (1/27)^(1/3) = 1/3. Then the square root of that is sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/3. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form is sqrt(3)/3. But let me see if there's another way to approach this using exponents with fractional powers, maybe that would make it clearer.\n\nStarting over, let's express everything using exponents. The original expression is:\n\nsqrt( ∛( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nExpressed with exponents, that's:\n\n( ( ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) )^(1/2) )\n\nWait, let me check the order. The innermost is sqrt(1/729) which is (1/729)^(1/2). Then the cube root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3). Then the square root of that result is [ ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) ]^(1/2). \n\nMultiplying the exponents step by step:\n\nFirst exponent: 1/2 (from the first square root)\n\nThen, raising that to the 1/3 power: (1/2)*(1/3) = 1/6\n\nThen raising that to the 1/2 power: (1/6)*(1/2) = 1/12\n\nSo overall, the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12). \n\nHmm, so 1/729 is the same as 729^(-1). Let me see if 729 is a power of some number. 729 is 9^3"

            "output": " because 9*9*9 is 729. And 9 is 3^2, so 729 is (3^2)^3 = 3^(6). Therefore, 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is 3^(-6).\n\nTherefore, (1/729)^(1/12) is (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/√3. \n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. Earlier, I got √3 / 3, which is the same as 1/√3, just rationalized. So, both methods agree.\n\nSo, okay, so either way, whether I simplify step by step or use the exponents, I end up with 1/√3, which can be written as √3 / 3 with a rational denominator.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me calculate 729^(1/12). 729 is 3^6, so 729^(1/12) is (3^6)^(1/12) = 3^(6*(1/12)) = 3^(1/2) = √3. Therefore, 1/729^(1/12) is 1/√3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, both approaches confirm that the expression simplifies to 1/√3, or √3/3.\n\nLet me just recap the steps again:\n\n1. Simplify the innermost radical: sqrt(1/729) = 1/27.\n2. Take the cube root of 1/27, which is 1/3.\n3. Take the square root of 1/3, which is 1/√3.\n4. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by √3, giving √3 / 3.\n\nAlternatively, using exponents:\n\n1. Express each operation as exponents: (1/729)^(1/2)^(1/3)^(1/2).\n2. Multiply exponents: (1/2)*(1/3)*(1/2) = 1/12.\n3. So, it's 1/729^(1/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/√3 = √3 / 3.\n\nEither way, the result"

Let me just check with a calculator if needed, but I think the exponents and radicals should work out as above. 729^(1/12) is indeed √3 because (3^(1/2))^12 is 3^6 which is 729. Therefore, 3^(1/2) is the 12th root of 729, so 1/729^(1/12) is 1/3^(1/2) = 1/√3.\n\nSo yes, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is √3 divided by 3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression √(∛(√(1/729))) and write it with a rational denominator, follow these steps:\n\n1.
