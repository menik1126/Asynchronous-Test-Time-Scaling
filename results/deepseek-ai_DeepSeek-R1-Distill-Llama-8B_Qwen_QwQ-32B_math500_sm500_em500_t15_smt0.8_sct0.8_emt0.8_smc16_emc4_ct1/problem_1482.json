            "output": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to simplify this expression: the cube root of the square root of the square root of 1/729. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense.\n\nOkay, first, let's look at the innermost part: the square root of 1/729. I remember that taking the square root of a fraction means taking the square root of the numerator and the denominator separately. So, the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729... Hmm, what's the square root of 729? I think 27 squared is 729 because 25 squared is 625 and 26 squared is 676, which is still less than 729. Let me confirm: 27 times 27 is indeed 729. So, the square root of 1/729 is 1/27.\n\nAlright, so now we have the cube root of that result. That means we have the cube root of 1/27. Let's see, cube root of 1 is 1, and cube root of 27 is... Hmm, since 3 cubed is 27, the cube root of 27 is 3. So, the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but that's just the middle part. The original problem has another square root outside of that. So, we have the square root of 1/3. Let's compute that. Again, square root of 1 is 1, and square root of 3 is irrational, so it stays as sqrt(3). So, the square root of 1/3 is 1/sqrt(3).\n\nBut the problem asks for a rational denominator. I recall that we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by sqrt(3). So, 1/sqrt(3) becomes (1*sqrt(3))/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)). The denominator simplifies to 3, so it's sqrt(3)/3.\n\nPutting it all together, the original expression simplifies to sqrt(3)/3. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the inside: square root of 1/729 is 1/27. Cube root of that is 1/3. Then"

            "output": " square root of 1/3 is 1/sqrt(3), which rationalizes to sqrt(3)/3. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should express all the exponents in fractional form to see if there's another way to approach it. Let me try that. The original expression is sqrt(cbrt(sqrt(1/729))). Let's write each root as an exponent. The square root is exponent 1/2, cube root is 1/3, and the outer square root is another 1/2. So, combining the exponents: ( ( ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) )^(1/2) ). \n\nMultiplying all the exponents together: 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/12. So, the entire expression is (1/729)^(1/12). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. The order is sqrt of the cube root of the sqrt, so exponents multiply in order. Let me see:\n\nStarting with (1/729)^(1/2) for the inner sqrt. Then that result is raised to 1/3 for the cube root, so ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6). Then taking the square root of that would be (1/729)^(1/12). Hmm, so that's 729 to the power of -1/12. \n\nBut 729 is 9^3, which is also 3^6. Let me see: 3^6 = 729. So, 729^(1/12) would be (3^6)^(1/12) = 3^(6/12) = 3^(1/2). Therefore, 1/729^(1/12) is 1/(3^(1/2)) which is 1/sqrt(3), which again leads to sqrt(3)/3. So that matches my previous result. \n\nTherefore, the simplified form with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3. I think that's correct. Let me just confirm once more each step:\n\n"
