Alright, I need to find all values of x that satisfy this equation. \n\nFirst, I remember that when there's a square root in an equation, a common method is to isolate the square root and then square both sides to eliminate it. That usually helps in solving such equations. So let's try that approach here.\n\nStarting with the original equation:\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nI think I should get rid of the square root first. To do that, I'll subtract 4 from both sides. That way, the square root term will be by itself on one side. Let me do that step by step.\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides:\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nOkay, so now we have x minus 4 equals the square root of (11 minus 2x). The next step is to square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. Squaring both sides should help me get rid of that radical.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n(x - 4)² = (√(11 - 2x))²\n\nOn the right side, squaring the square root just gives me the expression inside, which is 11 - 2x. On the left side, I need to expand the squared term. Let me remember how to expand (x - 4) squared.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n(x - 4)(x - 4) = x² - 8x + 16\n\nSo now my equation becomes:\nx² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nHmm, okay. Now I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side so I can set it equal to zero. I'll subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides.\n\nSubtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\nx² - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplifying that:\nx² - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nAlright, so now I have a quadratic equation: x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals"

Hmm, the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. If both are negative, they would add to -6. Let me check:\n\n(-1) * (-5) = 5 and (-1) + (-5) = -6. Perfect, that works.\n\nSo factoring the quadratic:\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives me the potential solutions:\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5\n\nSo I have two solutions: x is 1 or x is 5. But wait, I remember that when we deal with square roots in equations, sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions. That means I need to check both of these solutions in the original equation to make sure they work.\n\nLet's test x = 1 first:\nOriginal equation: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4\nPlugging in x = 1:\n1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4\nSimplify inside the square root:\n1 = √(11 - 2) + 4\n1 = √9 + 4\n√9 is 3, so:\n1 = 3 + 4\n1 = 7\nWait, that's not true. 1 does not equal 7. So x = 1 is an extraneous solution. Hmm, so we have to discard that.\n\nNow let's check x = 5:\nPlugging x = 5 into the original equation:\n5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4\nSimplify inside the square root:\n5 = √(11 - 10) + 4\n5 = √1 + 4\n√1 is 1, so:\n5 = 1 + 4\n5 = 5\nYes, that's true. So x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nWait, but I should also check the domain of the original equation to make sure that both x = 1 and x = 5 are within the possible range. The expression inside the square root, 11 - 2x, must be greater than or"

Both 1 and 5 are less than or equal to 5.5, so they are within the domain. However, when we tested x = 1 earlier, it didn't satisfy the original equation, so it's an extraneous solution. \n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x = 5. \n\nWait a second, I just thought of something. When I squared both sides, sometimes squaring can sometimes create solutions that didn't exist before, but in this case, x =1 didn't work, so it's just an extraneous solution. But is there another way I could have approached this problem? Maybe by considering substitution or another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe graphing both sides of the equation could help visualize the solutions. Let's consider the left side, which is just a linear function y = x, and the right side is y = √(11 - 2x) + 4. The point where these two graphs intersect would be the solution(s).\n\nThe right side, y = √(11 - 2x) + 4, is a square root function shifted to the right and up. Let me think about its shape. The square root function generally has a parabola-like shape, starting at x = 5.5, y = 4. It increases slowly. On the other hand, the left side is a straight line with a slope of 1. So, at x =5, we have y =5 on the left, and on the right, √(11 -10)+4=1+4=5. So both sides meet at (5,5). \n\nBut when x=1, right side is 3 +4=7, while left side is 1, so they don't meet there. So, yes, that reinforces that x=5 is the only solution.\n\nIs there a possibility that I missed another solution? Let me think. When we squared both sides, sometimes the equation can have another solution, but in this case, we ended up with"

Let me check again.\n\nOriginal equation:\nx = √(11 -2x) +4\n\nSubtract 4:\nx -4 = √(11 -2x)\n\nSquare both sides:\n(x -4)^2 = 11 -2x\n\nExpand left side:\nx² -8x +16 =11 -2x\n\nBring all terms to left:\nx² -8x +16 -11 +2x =0 → x² -6x +5 =0\n\nFactor:\n(x -1)(x -5)=0 → x=1 or x=5\n\nYes, that's correct. So the algebra steps are okay. The problem is that when we squared both sides, the equation (x -4)^2 = 11 -2x is a quadratic equation which can have two solutions, but only those that satisfy the original equation are valid. Since x=1 didn't satisfy the original equation, it's discarded.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nWait, but let me also check if there's another way to approach this problem. For instance, maybe substituting variables. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set y = √(11 -2x). Then the original equation becomes x = y +4. So, substituting x = y +4 into the expression for y:\n\ny = √(11 -2(y +4))\n\nLet me simplify inside the square root:\n\n11 -2y -8 = 3 -2y\n\nSo, y = √(3 -2y)\n\nNow, we have y = √(3 -2y). Let's square both sides here:\n\ny² = 3 -2y\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\ny² +2y -3 =0\n\nFactor this quadratic:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to +2. Those would be 3 and -1.\n\n(y +3)(y -1)=0\n\nThus, y = -3 or y =1\n\nBut y was defined as the square root of (11 -2x), which is always non-negative. So y cannot be negative. Therefore, y = -3 is invalid. So only y=1 is valid.\n\nThen, since x = y +4"

So that reinforces the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, after checking, substitution, and considering domain restrictions, the only solution is x=5.\n\nAnother thing to think about: sometimes when equations are manipulated, especially squaring both sides, we might lose information. But in this case, the substitution method helped us find the correct solution without extraneous roots.\n\nTo confirm, when x=5, let's plug back into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: 5\nRight side: √(11 - 2*5)+4 = √(11 -10)+4 = √1 +4 =1+4=5\n\nSo 5=5, which works.\n\nAnd for x=1:\n\nLeft side:1\nRight side:√(11 -2*1)+4=√9+4=3+4=7\n\n1≠7, so it doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, only x=5 is the valid solution.\n\nWait, but sometimes, could there be more than one solution? In this case, algebra suggests two, but only one works. But perhaps if the quadratic had given more solutions, but in this case, only one works.\n\nLet me also consider the function f(x) = x and g(x) = √(11 -2x) +4. The intersection points would give solutions. f(x) is a straight line, increasing with slope 1. g(x) is a square root function shifted up by 4 and shifted to the right.\n\nThe square root function starts at x=5.5, g(5.5)=√(11 -11)+4=0+4=4. So at x=5.5, g(x)=4, which is below f(x)=5.5. At x=5, g(x)=5, same as f(x)=5. So that's one point.\n\nLooking at the behavior, g(x) increases as x decreases towards 5.5. So to the left of x=5, g(x) is higher than f(x). At x=1, g(x)=7 vs f(x)=1. So it's above. But after x=5, g(x) increases only slowly, while f(x) continues to increase with slope 1.\n\nSo, beyond x=5, does g(x) ever catch up to f"
