Since S = 2T + G, I can replace S in the first equation:\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding the equation:\n10T = 6T + 3G + G,\n10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides:\n4T = 4G.\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\nT = G.\n\nSo, one treek weighs as much as one goolee.\n\nGoing back to the second equation:\n2T + G = S,\nbut since T = G,\n2G + G = S,\n3G = S.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1.
