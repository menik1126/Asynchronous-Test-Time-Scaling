            "output": "First, I'll define the variables: Let T represent the weight of one treek, S represent the weight of one squig, and G represent the weight of one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives me the equation 10T = 3S + G.\n\nFrom the second statement, Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This gives me the equation 2T + G = S.\n\nNext, I'll substitute the expression for S from the second equation into the first equation. So, 10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding the equation, I get 10T = 6T + 3G + G, which simplifies to 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides, I have 4T = 4G. Dividing both sides by 4, I find that T = G.\n\nSince T equals G, I can substitute back into the second equation to find S. So, 2T + T = S, which gives S = 3T.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of three treeks is equal to the weight of one squig. So, three treeks weigh the same as one squig.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many treeks weigh the same as one squig, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\nLet:\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Given:**\n1.
