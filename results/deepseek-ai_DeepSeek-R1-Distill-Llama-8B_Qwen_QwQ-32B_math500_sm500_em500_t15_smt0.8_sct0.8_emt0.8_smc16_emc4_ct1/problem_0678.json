Therefore, multiplying the number of players x by the number of cards each player gets y gives the total number of cards distributed, which is 54.\n\nSo, the equation to find possible values of x is x multiplied by y equals 54. Mathematically, this is represented as:\n\nx * y = 54.\n\nNext, I need to determine how many possible values of x there are, given that x is at least 2 and y is at least 5. To find this, I'll list all the factors of 54 and identify those that meet the given conditions.\n\nThe factors of 54 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nNow, I'll remove the factors that don't meet the conditions. Since x must be at least 2 and y must be at least 5, I eliminate the factor 1 because that would leave y equal to 54, which is greater than 5 but doesn't fit the minimum requirement for x.\n\nThe remaining factors are:\n\n2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nEach of these values of x will result in a corresponding value of y that is also an integer and meets the condition of being at least 5.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If x = 2, then y = 54 / 2 = 27, which is at least 5.\n- If x = 3, then y = 54 / 3 = 18, which is at least 5.\n- And so on for the remaining values.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible values for x is 7.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many possible values of \\( x \\) there are, given that \\( x \\) is at least 2 and \\( y \\) is at least 5, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship**:\n   The total number of cards is \\( 54 \\). When distributing the cards to \\( x \\) players, each player gets \\( y \\) cards. Therefore, the relationship is:\n   \\[\n   x \\times y = 54\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify Possible Values of \\( y \\)**:\n   Since \\( y \\) must be at least 5, we list the divisors"
