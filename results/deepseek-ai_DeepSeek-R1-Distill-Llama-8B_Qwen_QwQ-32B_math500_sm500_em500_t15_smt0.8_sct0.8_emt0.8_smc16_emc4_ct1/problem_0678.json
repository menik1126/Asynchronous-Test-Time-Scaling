Since there are x players, the total number of cards distributed can be expressed as x multiplied by y, so x × y = 54.\n\nNext, I need to determine all the possible values of x that satisfy the given conditions. x must be at least 2 and y must be at least 5. To find the possible values of x, I'll list all the divisors of 54.\n\nStarting with x = 2, y would be 54 ÷ 2 = 27, which is greater than 5, so x = 2 is valid.\n\nFor x = 3, y = 54 ÷ 3 = 18, which also satisfies y ≥ 5.\n\nContinuing this process:\n- x = 6, y = 9\n- x = 9, y = 6\n- x = 18, y = 3\n- x = 27, y = 2\n\nAfter listing all possible divisors, I identify that the valid values of x are 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, and 27.
