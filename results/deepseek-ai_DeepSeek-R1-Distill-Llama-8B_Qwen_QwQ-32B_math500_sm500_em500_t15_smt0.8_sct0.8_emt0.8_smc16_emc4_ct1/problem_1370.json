            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many boys are at the math club meeting. There are 35 students total. The number of girls is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of students is 35, which is the sum of girls and boys. So, if I let G represent the number of girls and B represent the number of boys, I can write the equation:\n\nG + B = 35\n\nNext, the problem says the number of girls is a multiple of 13. So, G must be 13, 26, 39, etc. But wait, since the total number of students is only 35, G can't be more than 35. So the possible values for G are 13 and 26. Because 39 is already higher than 35, it's not possible.\n\nNow, the problem also states that there are more girls than boys. That means the number of girls is greater than the number of boys. So, G > B. Since G + B = 35, if G is 26, then B would be 35 - 26 = 9. Is 26 greater than 9? Yes, that works because there would be more girls than boys.\n\nWhat if G is 13? Then B would be 35 - 13 = 22. But in that case, G is not more than B because 13 is less than 22. So that doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the only valid number of girls is 26, which leaves 9 boys. Let me just double-check that. 26 girls + 9 boys equals 35 students. Yes, that adds up. And 26 is a multiple of 13, which fits the first condition. Also, since 26 > 9, there are indeed more girls than boys. So, everything checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of students is 35. Let G be the number of girls and B the number of boys. We know:\n\n1. G = 13k (k is an integer)\n2. G > B\n3. G + B = 35\n\nTesting k=1: G=13, then B=22. But G=13 < B=22, which doesn't satisfy G>B.\n\nTesting k=2: G=26,"
