            "output": "First, I note that the total number of students attending the math club meeting is 35.\n\nLet’s denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B.\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of girls is a multiple of 13, so G = 13k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nAlso, there are more girls than boys, which means G > B.\n\nSince the total number of students is G + B = 35, I can substitute G with 13k:\n\n13k + B = 35\n\nTo find B, I'll solve for it:\n\nB = 35 - 13k\n\nGiven that G > B, I can set up the inequality:\n\n13k > 35 - 13k\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n26k > 35\n\nDividing both sides by 26:\n\nk > 35/26\n\nCalculating 35 divided by 26 gives approximately 1.346.\n\nSince k must be an integer, the smallest possible value for k is 2.\n\nNow, substituting k = 2 back into the expression for B:\n\nB = 35 - 13*2 = 35 - 26 = 9\n\nTherefore, there are 9 boys attending the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nThirty-five students attend a math club meeting. The number of girls at the meeting is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls than boys attending the meeting. How many boys are at the meeting?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( G \\) represent the number of girls.\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the number of boys.\n   - Total number of students \\( = G + B = 35 \\).\n\n2. **Given Conditions:**\n   - \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13:  \n     \\( G = 13k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n   - More girls than boys:  \n     \\( G > B \\).\n\n3. **Express \\( B \\) in Terms of \\( G \\):**\n   - From the total number of students:\n     \\[\n     B = 35 - G\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( G = 13k \\):\n     \\[\n     B = 35 - 13k\n     \\]\n\n4. **Apply the Condition \\( G > B \\"
