            "output": "First, I need to help William Sydney Porter correct his calculation. He initially tried to compute \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\) but mistakenly used \\(\\frac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\), resulting in \\(\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\). To find the correct answer, I'll start by rewriting the original expression with the negative sign properly included.\n\nNext, I'll apply the complex conjugate method to simplify the division. This involves multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. Multiplying \\(-3 + 4i\\) by \\(1 - 2i\\) gives a new numerator, while multiplying \\(1 + 2i\\) by \\(1 - 2i\\) gives the denominator.\n\nAfter performing the multiplications, I'll separate the real and imaginary parts of the numerator and denominator. Then, I'll divide both the real parts and the imaginary parts by the denominator's real part to obtain the simplified complex number.\n\nFinally, I'll compare William's incorrect result with the correct one to identify the error and provide the accurate answer he should have obtained.\n</think>\n\nTo correct William Sydney Porter's calculation, let's perform the division \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\) properly.\n\n1. **Express the complex numbers in standard form:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expand the numerator using the distributive property:**\n   \\[\n   (-3)(1) + (-3)(-2i) + 4i(1) + 4i(-2i) = -3 + 6i + 4i - 8i^2\n   \\]\n   Since \\(i^2 = -1\\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -3 + 10i + 8 = 5 + 10i\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expand the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   (1)(1) + (1)(-2i"
