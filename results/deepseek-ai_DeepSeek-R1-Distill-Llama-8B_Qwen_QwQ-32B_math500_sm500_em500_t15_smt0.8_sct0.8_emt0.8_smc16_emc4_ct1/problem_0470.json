I remember that in algebra, when dealing with symmetric equations involving three variables, sometimes it's useful to use symmetric sums or Vieta's formulas. Maybe I can relate these equations to the roots of a cubic polynomial.\n\nLet me denote the variables as \\( x, y, z \\). I know that for symmetric sums, we can express them in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials. The elementary symmetric polynomials for three variables are:\n\n- \\( s_1 = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( s_2 = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( s_3 = xyz \\)\n\nFrom the given equations, I can see that \\( s_3 = xyz = 4 \\). That's helpful.\n\nNow, the second equation is \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). I recall that there's a formula for the sum of cubes:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\)\n\nUsing this, I can write:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 3 s_3 \\)\n\nPlugging in what I know:\n\n\\( 4 = s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 3 \\times 4 \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( 4 = s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 12 \\)\nMove the 12 to the left:\n\\( s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 12 - 4 = 0 \\)\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\( s_1^3 - 3 s_1 s_2 + 8 = 0 \\)\nLet me note this as equation (4):\n\n\\( s_1"

It seems like a combination of terms where each variable is squared and multiplied by another variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me try to group terms:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \\)\nSimilarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \\)\nAnd \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \\)\n\nSo, the entire expression can be written as:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\)\n\nHmm, that's a bit better. But I wonder if there's another way to express this. Maybe in terms of symmetric sums.\n\nLet me think. Alternatively, another approach could be to factor it as:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \\)\n\nWait, maybe I can factor this differently. Let's see:\n\nNotice that each term has two variables, and each is multiplied by the square of another. Perhaps another approach is to factor it as:\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) \\)\n\nWait, but that's just the original expression, so maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, if I denote \\( s_1 = x + y + z \\), \\( s_2 = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( s_3 = xyz = 4 \\), then perhaps I can express the third equation in terms of \\( s_1 \\), \\( s_2 \\), and \\( s_3 \\).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to relate the third equation directly to \\( s_1 \\) and \\( s_2 \\). Let me try expanding it.\n\n"
