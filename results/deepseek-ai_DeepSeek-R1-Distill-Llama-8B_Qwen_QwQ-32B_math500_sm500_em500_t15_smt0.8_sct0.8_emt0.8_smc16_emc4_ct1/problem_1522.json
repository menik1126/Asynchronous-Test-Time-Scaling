The given conditions are that the sum of the numbers is 96, the sum of their squares is 144, and the sum of their cubes is 216. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with sums of powers like this, sometimes it's helpful to think about the relationships between these sums. Maybe I can use some inequality or identity here. I remember that for sequences, especially when all the terms are positive, there are some standard inequalities that might apply, like Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder's inequality.\n\nWait, actually, another approach could be to consider if all the a_i are equal. If they are, then we can model this as each a_i being the same, which would simplify things. So if all a_i are equal, then each a_i would be 96/n. Then the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)^2 = 96^2 / n. Similarly, the sum of cubes would be n*(96/n)^3 = 96^3 / n^2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nIf a_i = 96/n for all i, then:\n\nSum of squares: n*(96/n)^2 = 96^2 / n = 144\n\nSum of cubes: n*(96/n)^3 = 96^3 / n^2 = 216\n\nSo from the sum of squares, I can set up an equation:\n\n96^2 / n = 144\n\nSimilarly, from the sum of cubes:\n\n96^3 / n^2 = 216\n\nLet me compute 96^2 and 96^3 first.\n\n96^2 = 9216\n\n96^3 = 96 * 9216 = Let me compute that:\n\n9216 * 96: 9216*100 = 921600, minus 9216*4=36864, so 921600 - 36864 = 884,736.\n\nSo, 96^3 = 884,736.\n\nSo from the sum of squares:\n\n9216 / n = 144 => n = 9216 / 144 = 64.\n\nSimilarly, from the sum of cubes:\n\n884736 / n^2 = 216 => n^"

So total n^2 = 4000 + 96 = 4096.\n\nSo n^2 = 4096 => n = 64. Because n has to be positive, we take the positive square root.\n\nSo, if all a_i are equal, n must be 64. Hmm, so that's one possible value for n.\n\nBut the question says \"the sum of all possible values of n.\" So is 64 the only possible value? Or could there be other values where the a_i aren't all the same?\n\nI need to check if n=64 is the only solution or if there are other possible n's where the sums hold. Maybe I should consider if the equality conditions in Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder's apply, which would require all terms to be equal. But perhaps there are other possibilities if the sequence isn't uniform.\n\nWait, let me think about variance. The sum of squares can tell us about the variance. If all a_i are equal, the variance is zero, which would mean the sum of squares is minimized. So if our sum of squares is exactly 144, which is less than if the numbers were more spread out, but wait, actually for a given sum, the sum of squares is minimized when all the numbers are equal, right? Because of the inequality that says sum(a_i^2) ≥ (sum a_i)^2 / n, which is true because of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nSo, in our case, if sum a_i^2 = 144 and (sum a_i)^2 / n = 96^2 / n, which must be ≤ sum a_i^2. So 96^2 / n ≤ 144, which implies n ≥ 96^2 / 144.\n\nCompute that: 9216 / 144 = 64. So n must be at least 64. So n ≥ 64.\n\nSimilarly, for sum of cubes, I wonder if there's an inequality that relates sum a_i^3 and sum a_i and sum a_i^2"

Therefore, the only possible n is 64.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for n=65, the minimal sum of squares is lower than 144, so maybe there's a way to get sum of squares exactly 144 by having some terms larger and some smaller. But when I tried to set up the equations, it didn't seem feasible. So perhaps indeed n=64 is the only possibility.\n\nThus, the sum of all possible values of n is just 64.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by considering the given sums and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which gives us \\( n \\geq 64 \\). We then check if a uniform sequence (all \\( a_i \\) equal) satisfies the given sums, finding that \\( n = 64 \\) is the only solution. Further analysis using Power Mean inequality confirms \\( n \\geq 64 \\), but since higher \\( n \\) would violate the exact sum of squares and cubes, \\( n = 64 \\) is the only possible value.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**\n\n1. **Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:**\n   The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that \\( \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^2 \\leq n \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\).\n   Plugging in the given sums:\n   \\[\n   96^2 \\leq n \\times 144 \\implies 9216 \\leq 144n \\implies n \\geq 64.\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Checking Uniform Sequence (All \\( a_i \\) Equal):"

Similarly, the minimal sum of cubes would also be less than 216. Hence, \\( n > 64 \\) is impossible. For \\( n < 64 \\), the minimal sum of squares would exceed 144, which is also impossible.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The only possible value of \\( n \\) is 64.
