The problem states that we have a sequence of positive real numbers \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\) with the following sums:\n\n1. \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n2. \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n3. \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\). Hmm, interesting. I think this has something to do with inequalities or maybe some algebraic identities. Let me recall some concepts that might be useful here.\n\nI remember that for any set of positive real numbers, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality relates the sum of the numbers to the sum of their squares. Similarly, there might be a relationship involving the sum of cubes, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should think about how these sums can be related through different means.\n\nAnother thought: the question provides sums of the first, second, and third powers of the sequence elements. This reminds me of the power sums in symmetric polynomials, which makes me think about Newton's identities, connecting power sums to elementary symmetric sums. Hmm, but I don't know the elementary symmetric sums here. Maybe that's too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the first and second powers. Let me write that down.\n\nBy Cauchy-Schwarz, we have:\n\n\\( \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 \\right) \\geq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{2} \\right)^2 \\)\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check: The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form \\( (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2)(y_1^2 + y_2^2 + \\dots + y_n^2) \\geq (x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + \\dots + x"

So if I set \\( x_i = a_i^{1.5} \\) and \\( y_i = a_i^{0.5} \\), then maybe?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider the Cauchy-Schwarz in terms of vectors. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality between the vectors \\( (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) \\) and \\( (a_1^2, a_2^2, ..., a_n^2) \\). Wait, but that might not directly apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz in the form:\n\n\\( \\left( \\sum a_i \\right)^2 \\leq n \\sum a_i^2 \\). Let me compute that.\n\nGiven that \\( \\sum a_i = 96 \\), so \\( (96)^2 = 9216 \\leq n \\times 144 \\). Therefore, \\( 9216 \\leq 144n \\implies n \\geq 9216 / 144 = 64 \\). So n must be at least 64. Hmm, that's a useful lower bound.\n\nSo n is at least 64. But the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n\". So maybe there are multiple n's possible? Or perhaps only one?\n\nWait, but maybe there's an upper bound as well? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the terms are equal? Let me check that case first. Suppose all the a_i are equal. Then each a_i would be 96/n. Then the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)^2 = 9216/n. According to the problem, this is equal to 144. So 9216/n = 144 => n = 9216 / 144 = 64. Similarly, the sum of cubes would be n*(96/n)^3 = (96)^3 / n^2. Let's see if that equals 216. Let's compute (96)^3 / (64)^2. 96^3 is 96*96*96. 96^2 is "
