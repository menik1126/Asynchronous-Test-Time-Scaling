This means his initial displacement is 0.5 miles in the southern direction.\n\nNext, he goes three-fourths of a mile east, so his displacement in the eastern direction is 0.75 miles.\n\nFinally, Bill walks another half a mile south, adding another 0.5 miles to his southern displacement, making the total southern displacement 1.0 mile.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. The southern displacement is 1.0 mile, and the eastern displacement is 0.75 mile.\n\nUsing the formula \\( \\sqrt{(east)^2 + (south)^2} \\), the straight-line distance is \\( \\sqrt{1.0^2 + 0.75^2} \\).\n\nCalculating this gives a distance of approximately 1.60 miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine how far Bill is from his starting point using a step-by-step approach.\n\n1. **Breaking Down the Displacements**:\n   - **First Movement**: Bill walks \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - **Second Movement**: He then walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n   - **Third Movement**: Finally, he walks another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n\n2. **Calculating Total Displacements**:\n   - **Southern Direction**:\n     - Initial Southward Movement: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile\n     - Additional Southward Movement: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile\n     - **Total Southern Displacement**: \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile\n   - **Eastern Direction**:\n     - **Total Eastern Displacement**: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile\n\n3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   - To find the straight-line distance from the starting point, we consider the southern and eastern displacements as the legs of a right-angled triangle.\n   - Let:\n     - \\( \\text{South Displacement} = 1 \\) mile\n     - \\( \\text{East Displacement} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) miles \\( ="
