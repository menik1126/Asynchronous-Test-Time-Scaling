            "output": "Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the function given is \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\). I need to find the vertical asymptotes \\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\), and the horizontal asymptote \\( y = c \\). Then, I have to add them together to get \\( a + b + c \\).\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, let me set the denominator equal to zero and solve for x.\n\nThe denominator is \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\). To find when this is zero, I'll solve the quadratic equation:\n\n\\( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \\)\n\nI can use the quadratic formula here, which is \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -5 \\), and \\( c = -14 \\).\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14)}}{2(1)} \\)\n\nSimplifying inside the square root:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 56}}{2} \\)\n\nBecause \\( (-5)^2 = 25 \\) and \\( 4*1*(-14) = -56 \\), but since it's minus that, it becomes +56.\n\nSo, \\( \\sqrt{25 + 56} = \\sqrt{81} = 9 \\).\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{5 + 9}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\)\n\nand\n\n\\( x = \\frac{5 - 9}{2} = \\frac{-4}{2} = -2 \\)\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). So, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\), or vice versa. The order doesn't matter for addition, so \\( a + b = -2 + 7 = 5 \\).\n\nNow,"

            "output": " moving on to the horizontal asymptote. I recall that for a rational function, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.\n\nIn this case, the numerator is degree 1 (since it's \\( 2x \\)), and the denominator is degree 2. The rule says that if the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote but maybe an oblique one.\n\nSo here, numerator degree is 1, denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote \\( y = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should double-check. So, the horizontal asymptote \\( y = c \\) is determined as follows:\n\n1. If degree of numerator < degree of denominator: \\( y = 0 \\)\n2. If equal: \\( y = \\frac{a}{b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are leading coefficients\n3. If numerator degree > denominator degree: no horizontal asymptote\n\nIn our case, numerator is \\( 2x \\), degree 1, denominator is \\( x^2 - 5x -14 \\), degree 2. So, 1 < 2, so horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). So, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nThat seems straightforward. So, now, adding them up: \\( a + b + c \\). Wait, which a and b? Since a and b are the vertical asymptotes, which are -2 and 7. So, a + b is -2 +7 =5, plus c=0, so total is 5 +0=5.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that the function behaves as expected near the asymptotes. Sometimes, factors in the numerator might cancel factors in the denominator, leading to holes instead of vertical asymptotes. Let me check if that's the case here.\n\nThe numerator is 2x, which can be factored as 2x, and the denominator is \\( x^2 -5x -14 \\). Let me try to factor the denominator.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5. Hmm, let's"

            "output": " see: factors of -14 could be -7 and +2, because -7 +2 = -5. Yes, so the denominator factors as (x -7)(x +2). Let me check:\n\n\\( (x -7)(x +2) = x^2 +2x -7x -14 = x^2 -5x -14 \\). Perfect, that's correct.\n\nSo, the denominator factors into (x -7)(x +2). The numerator is 2x, which doesn't have any common factors with the denominator. Therefore, there are no cancellations, so the vertical asymptotes are indeed at x =7 and x = -2. So that's confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x =7, so a and b are -2 and7, so their sum is 5. The horizontal asymptote is y=0, so c=0. Therefore, the total is 5 +0 =5.\n\nWait, but hold on, the question says \"vertical asymptotes x=a and x=b\". So, the problem is correct, since there are two vertical asymptotes. So, the answer is 5 +0 =5. So, the final answer is 5. Therefore, in boxed form, \\boxed{5}.\n\nHmm, but let me just check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in the horizontal asymptote?\n\nThe horizontal asymptote is when x approaches infinity. Let me compute the limit as x approaches infinity of f(x):\n\n\\( \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{2x}{x^2 -5x -14} \\).\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by x (the highest power in the denominator is x^2, but since numerator is degree 1, dividing by x would make denominator degree 1, but maybe better to divide by x^2.\n\nAlternatively, since numerator degree is less than denominator, the limit is 0. So, yes, horizontal asymptote at y=0. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I do divide numerator and denominator by x^2:\n\nNumerator becomes \\( \\frac{2x}{x^2} = \\frac{2}{x} \\), denominator becomes \\( 1 - \\frac{5}{x} - \\frac{14}{x^2} \\). As x approaches infinity, numerator approaches "
