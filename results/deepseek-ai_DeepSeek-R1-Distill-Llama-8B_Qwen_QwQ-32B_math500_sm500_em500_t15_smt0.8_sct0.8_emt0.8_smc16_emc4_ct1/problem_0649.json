The problem states that P(x) lies between two other quadratics: the lower bound is x² - 2x + 2, and the upper bound is 2x² - 4x + 3. Also, it tells me that P(11) is 181.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, I can write it in the general form: P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are real coefficients that I need to determine.\n\nBut before jumping into that, maybe I can use the given inequalities to find out more about P(x). The inequalities are:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all real x.\n\nHmm, so for every x, P(x) is sandwiched between these two quadratics. Maybe the difference between P(x) and these two quadratics is always non-negative or non-positive? Let me consider that.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLower(x) = x² - 2x + 2\n\nUpper(x) = 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nSo, Lower(x) ≤ P(x) ≤ Upper(x).\n\nIf I subtract Lower(x) from P(x), I get P(x) - Lower(x) ≥ 0 for all x. Similarly, Upper(x) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nLet me compute these differences.\n\nFirst, P(x) - Lower(x):\n\nP(x) - Lower(x) = (ax² + bx + c) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\n\nSimilarly, Upper(x) - P(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - (ax² + bx + c) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c)\n\nSince both of these differences must be non-negative for all x, and because quadratics can open upwards or downwards, the leading coefficients must be non-negative, and the discriminant must be non-positive to ensure that the quadratic is always non-negative.\n\nSo, for P(x) - Lower(x):\n\nQuadratic: (a - 1"

Not necessarily, but since P(x) is between them, perhaps their difference is non-negative, but not necessarily zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps instead of working with the inequalities, I can think about P(x) as a convex combination of the two bounds.\n\nAlternatively, since both differences must be non-negative, they must have a common quadratic form.\n\nWait, another approach: the difference between P(x) and both lower and upper bounds must be non-negative quadratics.\n\nBut since P(x) is a quadratic, their differences are quadratics.\n\nSo, both (P(x) - Lower(x)) and (Upper(x) - P(x)) are non-negative quadratics.\n\nBut each requires that the leading coefficient is non-negative, as we had earlier, and that the discriminant is non-positive.\n\nSince we have constraints on a, as 1 ≤ a ≤ 2.\n\nWait, maybe P(x) is such that both differences are perfect squares? Because otherwise, they would just be non-negative quadratics, but perhaps in this problem, they actually touch zero at some point, which would help solve for a, b, c.\n\nWait, for the difference quadratics to have discriminant zero, they would touch the x-axis at one point. So if, for instance, P(x) - Lower(x) is a perfect square (i.e., discriminant zero), then it would only touch the x-axis at one point, meaning that it's always non-negative. Similarly for the upper difference.\n\nWait, perhaps that is the case. Maybe the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is a perfect square, and same with the upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(x) is the average of the two bounds? But that would be more specific.\n\nWait, let me compute the average of Lower(x) and Upper(x):\n\n( (x² - 2x + 2) + (2x² -4x +3) ) /2 = (3x² -6x +5)/2.\n\nHmm, is P(x) equal to that?

So that's not it.\n\nHmm, so that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P(x) is a linear combination of the two bounds?\n\nWait, perhaps P(x) = k*Lower(x) + (1 -k)*Upper(x), but that might not necessarily work unless k is between 0 and 1. Let me see.\n\nWait, but if I set P(x) = Lower(x) + t*(Upper(x) - Lower(x)), where t is between 0 and 1, then P(x) would be between the two. Let me see:\n\nUpper(x) - Lower(x) = (2x² -4x +3) - (x² -2x +2) = x² -2x +1 = (x -1)^2.\n\nAh! That's interesting. The difference between the upper and lower bounds is (x -1)^2. So, Upper(x) - Lower(x) = (x -1)^2.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the upper and lower is a perfect square, which is always non-negative, as expected.\n\nTherefore, since P(x) is between Lower(x) and Upper(x), then P(x) can be written as:\n\nP(x) = Lower(x) + k(x)*(Upper(x) - Lower(x)) = Lower(x) + k(x)*(x -1)^2,\n\nwhere k(x) is a function between 0 and 1 for all x.\n\nBut since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, and Lower(x) and Upper(x) are quadratics, then k(x) must be a constant function. Because otherwise, if k(x) is a function, then P(x) would have higher degree terms unless k(x) is constant.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose P(x) = Lower(x) + k*(x -1)^2, where k is a constant between 0 and 1.\n\nThen, since (x -1)^2 is a quadratic, adding it to Lower(x) (which is quadratic) would give another quadratic.
