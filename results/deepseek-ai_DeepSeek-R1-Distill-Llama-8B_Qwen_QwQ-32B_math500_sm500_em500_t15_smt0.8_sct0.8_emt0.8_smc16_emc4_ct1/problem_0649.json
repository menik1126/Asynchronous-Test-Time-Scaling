Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, so it must have the general form:\n\nP(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\nwhere a, b, and c are real coefficients that I need to find.\n\nThe problem gives me two inequalities that P(x) must satisfy for all real numbers x:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3\n\nAdditionally, I'm given that P(11) = 181.\n\nSo, my goal is to find a, b, and c such that these inequalities hold for all x, and also P(11) = 181.\n\nLet me think about how to approach the inequalities. Since both inequalities must hold for all real x, they must hold for every x, which could help me set up equations or inequalities to solve for a, b, and c.\n\nLet me write down the inequalities again:\n\nLower bound: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x)\nUpper bound: P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3\n\nSo, substituting P(x) into these:\n\n1. x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n2. ax\u00b2 + bx + c \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3\n\nThese inequalities must hold for all real x. So, for the lower bound, for all x:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x + 2 - (ax\u00b2 + bx + c) \u2264 0\nSimplify that:\n\n(1 - a)x\u00b2 + (-2 - b)x + (2 - c) \u2264 0 for all x\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound:\n\nax\u00b2 + bx + c - (2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3) \u2264 0\nSimplify:\n\n(a - 2)x\u00b2 + (b + 4)x + (c - 3) \u2264 0 for all x\n\nNow, since a quadratic expression is less than or equal to zero for all real x, it must open downwards (if a < 0) and have a non-positive discriminant (so that it doesn't cross the x-axis, ensuring it's never positive).

Because if the quadratic is always non-negative (for the lower bound difference) and non-positive (for the upper bound difference), then they must be perfect squares multiplied by non-positive coefficients.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe lower bound inequality is:\n\nP(x) - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) \u2265 0 for all x.\n\nSimilarly, the upper bound inequality is:\n\n(2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - P(x) \u2265 0 for all x.\n\nTherefore, both expressions must be non-negative for all x. Since they are quadratics, they must be perfect squares multiplied by non-negative coefficients. Wait, but since they are non-negative for all x, they must be squares of linear terms or zero.\n\nWait, more precisely, if a quadratic is non-negative for all x, it must be a square of a linear term plus a non-negative constant, but actually, the standard form is that it must have a non-negative leading coefficient and discriminant \u2264 "
