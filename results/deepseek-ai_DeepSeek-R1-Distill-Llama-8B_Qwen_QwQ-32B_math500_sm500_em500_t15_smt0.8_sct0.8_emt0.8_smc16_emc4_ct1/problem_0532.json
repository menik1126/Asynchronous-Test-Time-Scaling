Specifically, we are looking for the number of ways two people can choose different dishes from 10 options.\n\nThe formula for permutations when selecting two distinct items from a set of 10 is calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of combinations = 10 (choices for the first person) × 9 (choices for the second person) = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order without selecting the same dish.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's calculate the number of possible meal combinations Yann and Camille can order under the given conditions.\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Dishes:**\n   - There are **10 dishes** on the menu.\n\n2. **Select a Dish for Yann:**\n   - Yann has **10 choices** since he can choose any dish from the menu.\n\n3. **Select a Dish for Camille:**\n   - After Yann has chosen his dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish.\n   - Therefore, Camille has **9 choices** left.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Combinations:**\n   - Multiply the number of choices for Yann by the number of choices for Camille.\n   - **Total combinations = 10 × 9 = 90**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\(\\boxed{90}\\)"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
