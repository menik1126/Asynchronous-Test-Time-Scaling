Additionally, the order matters (i.e., Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken).\n\n1. **First, consider the choices available to Yann:**\n   \n   - Yann has **10** possible dishes to choose from.\n\n2. **Then, consider the choices available to Camille:**\n   \n   - After Yann has chosen a dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish. Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining choices.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of combinations:**\n   \n   - Since the choices are independent, we multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has.\n   \n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(\\boxed{90}\\)"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
