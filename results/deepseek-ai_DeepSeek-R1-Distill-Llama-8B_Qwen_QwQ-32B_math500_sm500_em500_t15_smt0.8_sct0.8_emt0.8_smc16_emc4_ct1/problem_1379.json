Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a matrix transforms a vector, it essentially applies a linear transformation to it. So, if I have two vectors being transformed, I can use these transformations to figure out the matrix M. Once I have M, I can then apply it to the line y = 2x + 1. But wait, the line is a set of points, so I need to figure out how the entire line transforms under M. I think this might involve finding the image of the line under the linear transformation, which should also be a line, right?\n\nAlright, let's start by writing down what we know. The first vector is [2, -1] which is transformed to [9, 3]. So, if I denote the transformation as M, then M * [2, -1]^T = [9, 3]^T. Similarly, the second vector [1, -3] is transformed to [7, -1]. So, M * [1, -3]^T = [7, -1]^T.\n\nSince M is a linear transformation, it can be represented by a 2x2 matrix. So, let me assume that M is:\n\n[ a  b ]\n[ c  d ]\n\nThen, applying M to the first vector:\n\n[ a  b ]   [2]   [9]\n[ c  d ] * [-1] = [3]\n\nSo, that gives me two equations:\n\n1) 2a + (-1)b = 9\n2) 2c + (-1)d = 3\n\nSimilarly, applying M to the second vector:\n\n[ a  b ]   [1]   [7]\n[ c  d ] * [-3] = [-1]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n3) 1a + (-3)b = 7\n4) 1c + (-3)d = -1\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nI"

Let's call this equation (3).\n\nSo, we have two equations with two variables a and b.\n\nI can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me use elimination.\n\nLet me multiply equation (3) by 2: 2a - 6b = 14. Let's call this equation (3a).\n\nNow, subtract equation (1) from equation (3a):\n\n(2a - 6b) - (2a - b) = 14 - 9\n\n2a -6b -2a + b = 5\n\n-5b = 5\n\nSo, b = -1.\n\nNow, plugging back b = -1 into equation (1):\n\n2a - (-1) = 9 => 2a +1 =9 => 2a=8 => a=4.\n\nSo, a=4 and b=-1.\n\nNow, let's find c and d using equations 2 and 4.\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d =3.\n\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1.\n\nSo, two equations:\n\n2c - d =3 ... (2)\n\nc -3d = -1 ... (4)\n\nLet me solve this system. Maybe express c from equation (4):\n\nFrom equation (4): c = 3d -1.\n\nPlug this into equation (2):\n\n2*(3d -1) - d =3 => 6d -2 -d =3 =>5d -2=3 =>5d=5 =>d=1.\n\nThen, c= 3d -1= 3*1 -1=2.\n\nSo, c=2 and d=1.\n\nSo, the matrix M is:\n\n[4   -1]\n[2    1]\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any errors. Plugging M into the first vector:\n\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1)=8+1=9. That's correct.\n\n4*(-1) + (-1)*1= -4 -1= -5. Wait, but the result was ["

So, I need to figure out what happens to the line y=2x +1 when we apply M.\n\nAlternatively, the image of the line can be found by transforming two points on the line and then finding the equation of the line passing through those transformed points.\n\nWait, let me think about it.\n\nSo, perhaps the line y=2x +1 can be parameterized. Let me choose two points on the line, say x=0: y=1, so point (0,1); and x=1: y=3, so point (1,3). These two points are on the line. Then, if I apply the transformation M to both points, I can get two transformed points, and then determine the line connecting those two transformed points. That should give me the image of the line.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to express the line in vector form and then see how it transforms, but maybe using two points is more straightforward.\n\nSo, let me take the two points (0,1) and (1,3).\n\nApplying matrix M:\n\nFor (0,1):\n\nM * [0;1] = [4*0 + (-1)*1; 2*0 +1*1] = [ -1; 1 ]\n\nWait, that's [-1, 1]^T.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,3):\n\nM"

Now, I can find the equation of the line through these two points.\n\nFirst, compute the slope m:\n\nm = (5 -1)/(1 - (-1)) = 4/2 = 2.\n\nSo, the slope is 2. Then, using point-slope form with one of the points, say (-1,1):\n\ny -1 = 2(x - (-1)) => y -1 = 2(x +1) => y = 2x +2 +1 => y=2x +3.\n\nWait, but let me check with the other point (1,5):\n\nPlugging into y=2x +3: 2*1 +3=5, which matches. So, the line would be y=2x+3?\n\nHmm, but wait, is that correct? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check with another point on the original line to be sure. Let me pick another point, say x=2, then y=5. So, the original point (2,5). Applying M:\n\nM*[2;5] = [4*2 + (-1)*5; 2*2 +1*5] = [8-5;4+5] = [3;9]. So, (3,9).\n\nNow, check if (3,9) lies on y=2x+3. 2*3 +3=9, yes, that works. So, that seems okay.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is that the line y=2x+1 is an affine line, not a linear subspace, so the transformation is an affine transformation? Wait, but the matrix M is a linear transformation, so it will map lines to lines, but the origin might not be preserved. Wait, but linear transformations can shift the line? Wait, no, linear transformations preserve the origin. Wait, actually, linear transformations map lines not through the origin to other lines, but they might not be parallel. Hmm, but in this case, since the original line is y=2x+1, which is not through the origin,"

            "output": " so perhaps it's affine.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: express the line in terms of vectors.\n\nWait, the line y=2x+1 can be written as points (x, 2x+1). So, let me consider a vector along the line. The direction vector of the line is (1,2). So, any point on the line can be written as (t, 2t +1) for some parameter t.\n\nSo, let me consider a general point (t, 2t +1). Applying the matrix M, we can find where it maps.\n\nSo, M * [t; 2t +1] = [4t - (2t +1); 2t + (2t +1)].\n\nWait, compute that:\n\nFirst component: 4t - (2t +1) =4t -2t -1= 2t -1.\n\nSecond component:2t + (2t +1)= 4t +1.\n\nSo, the image point is (2t -1, 4t +1). Now, let's see if this can be expressed as a linear function of t, which it is. Let's express y in terms of x.\n\nFrom x =2t -1, we can solve for t: t=(x +1)/2.\n\nThen, substitute into y=4t +1: y=4*(x +1)/2 +1= 2(x +1) +1=2x +2 +1=2x +3.\n\nSo, the image of the line y=2x +1 under M is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the transformation of the line is given by M * (x, y) = (4x - y, 2x + y). Then, the image of the line y=2x +1 is the set of points (4x - y, 2x + y) where y=2x +1.\n\nWait, so substituting y=2x +1:\n\nx' =4x - (2x +1)=2x -1\n\ny'=2x + (2x +1)=4x +1.\n\nSo, now, we can solve for x and y.\n\nFrom x'=2x -1, x=("

So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the image is y=2x+3. Hmm, so that seems to check out.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M\". Since M is a linear transformation, but the line is affine, so the image is also an affine line. The process seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the transformation of the direction vector and a point on the line.\n\nThe original line has direction vector (1,2). The direction vector after transformation is M*(1,2). Let's compute that:\n\nM*[1;2] = [4*1 -1*2; 2*1 +1*2] = [4-2;2+2] = [2;4]. So, the direction vector becomes (2,4), which is equivalent to (1,2) scaled by 2. So, the direction is the same as the original direction, but scaled. Wait, but the slope would be 4/2=2, so the slope remains the same? Wait, but in our previous calculation, the image line had the same slope, 2, but different intercept. So that's consistent.\n\nThen, the direction of the line is preserved in terms of slope, but the intercept changes. To find the intercept, we can take a point on the original line, like (0,1), which maps to (-1,1). So, the line passes through (-1,1) with slope 2, so equation is y -1 =2(x +1), which is y=2x +3. So that's the same as before.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is y=2x+3. But let me just confirm once more.\n\nWait, let me try another point on the original line. Let's take x = -1, then y = 2*(-1) +1 = -2 +1 = -1. So"

Using y=2x +3: 2*(-3)+3= -6 +3=-3. Yes, (-3, -3) is on the line.\n\nAnother point: if x= -2, y=2*(-2)+1= -4 +1= -3. So, point (-2, -3).
