I remember that to find the image of a line under a linear transformation, I can represent the line as a vector function and then apply the matrix transformation. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given information. The matrix M transforms the vector v1 = [2, -1] to Mv1 = [9, 3]. Similarly, it transforms v2 = [1, -3] to Mv2 = [7, -1]. So, M is a 2x2 matrix that can be determined using these two vectors. Maybe I should find the matrix M first.\n\nSince Mv1 = [9, 3], I can write this as M * [2, -1]^T = [9, 3]^T. Similarly, M * [1, -3]^T = [7, -1]^T. To solve for M, I can set up equations. Let me assume M is [[a, b], [c, d]]. Then:\n\nM * [2, -1]^T = [9, 3]^T\nWhich gives:\n2a - b = 9\n-2c + d = 3\n\nSimilarly, for the second vector:\n\nM * [1, -3]^T = [7, -1]^T\nWhich gives:\na - 3b = 7\n-c + (-3)d = -1\n\nWait, let me write these equations down clearly:\n\nFrom the first transformation:\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) -2c + d = 3\n\nFrom the second transformation:\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) -c - 3d = -1\n\nNow, I have four equations with four unknowns: a, b, c, d. Let me try to solve them.\n\nFirst, let's solve equations 1 and 3 for a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nI can solve equation 3"

Let me check my calculations here.\n\nWait, let's do that again step by step.\n\nEquation 4: -c - 3d = -1\n\nSubstituting d = 3 + 2c into equation 4:\n\n-c -3*(3 + 2c) = -1\n\nExpand the terms:\n\n-c -9 -6c = -1\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-c -6c) + (-9) = -1\n\n-7c -9 = -1\n\nAdd 9 to both sides:\n\n-7c = 8\n\nSo, c = -8/7. Hmm, okay, that's correct. Then d = 3 + 2*(-8/7) = 3 - 16/7 = 21/7 -16/7 = 5/7.\n\nSo, c = -8/7 and d = 5/7.\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n\n[ a    b ]   [ 4     -1 ]\n[ c    d ] = [ -8/7  5/7 ]\n\nWait, let me confirm these values with the original equations.\n\nCheck equation 2: -2c + d = 3\n\nPlugging in c = -8/7 and"

To find it, I can parameterize the line and then apply the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the line y = 2x +1 as a vector function. Let's see. Any point (x, y) on the line satisfies y =2x +1. So, for any x, the point can be written as (x, 2x +1).\n\nSo, to apply M, we can write the vector [x, 2x +1] and then multiply by M.\n\nBut wait, perhaps more systematically, the image of the line is the set of all M*v where v is on the line.\n\nSo, v can be written as [x, 2x +1] for some x.\n\nSo, the image is M*[x, 2x +1]^T = [4x - (2x +1), (-8/7)x + (5/7)(2x +1)]^T.\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\nFirst component: 4x - (2x +1) = 4x -2x -1 = 2x -1\n\nSecond component: (-8/7)x + (5/7)(2x +1) = (-8/7)x + (10/7)x +5/7 = [(-8 +10)/7]x +5/7 = (2/7)x +5/7"

Applying M:\n\n[4*1 + (-1)*3, (-8/7)*1 + (5/7)*3] = [4 -3, (-8/7) +15/7] = [1, (7/7)] = [1,1].\n\nSo, the transformed point is (1,1).

The original line had a slope of 2, and the image line has a slope of 1/7, which seems reasonable, given the matrix M. The determinant of M would give the scaling factor of areas, but perhaps that's not needed here.\n\nAlternatively, another method: represent the line y =2x +1 as a vector function and compute M*(t) where t is a parameter.

So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the line as a set of points and find the image by applying the transformation. Since the line is affine, not necessarily through the origin, the image will also be an affine line. The direction vector of the original line is [1, 2]^T (since the slope is 2). The direction vector of the image line will be M*[1,2]^T. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute M*[1,2]^T:\n\nFirst component:4*1 + (-1)*2 =4-2=2\n\nSecond component: (-8/7)*1 + (5/7)*2 = (-8/7 +10/7)=2/7\n\nSo, the direction vector of the image line is [2, 2/7]^T, which corresponds to a slope of (2/7)/2 =1/7, which matches the slope we found earlier.\n\nNow, to find the equation of the image line, we need a point on the line and the direction. We already have a point, like when t=0, which gave us (-1,5/7).
