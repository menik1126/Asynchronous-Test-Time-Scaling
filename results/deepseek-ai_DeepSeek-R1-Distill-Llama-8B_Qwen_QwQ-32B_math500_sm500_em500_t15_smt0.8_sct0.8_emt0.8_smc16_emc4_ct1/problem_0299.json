Let me see, complex numbers can sometimes be a bit tricky, but I think I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. The complex number z is given as z = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i. So, if I break that down, the real part is 2 + √2 and the imaginary part is -(3 + 3√2). Hmm, that's a bit messy, but I guess that's okay.\n\nThen, c is given as c = 2 - 3i. So c is a complex number with real part 2 and imaginary part -3. I think c is the center around which we're rotating z. That makes sense because when you rotate a point around another point, the center is kind of like the pivot.\n\nNow, w is the result after rotating z around c by π/4 radians counter-clockwise. I remember that rotating a complex number can be done using the rotation formula. Wait, is it just multiplying by e^{iθ}? Yeah, I think that's right. So, if I translate z so that c is at the origin, then rotate, then translate back. That should give me w.\n\nLet me recall the rotation formula. To rotate a point z around another point c by an angle θ, the formula is:\nw = e^{iθ} * (z - c) + c\n\nSo, e^{iθ} would be cosθ + i sinθ. Since θ is π/4, cos(π/4) is √2/2 and sin(π/4) is also √2/2. So, e^{iπ/4} is √2/2 + i√2/2.\n\nAlright, so I need to compute z - c first, right? Let me compute that. z is 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i, and c is 2 - 3i. So subtracting c from z:\n\nz - c = (2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i) - (2 - 3i)\n= (2 + √2 - 2) + (-3 - 3√2)i - (-3i)\n= √"

            "output": "2 + (-3 - 3√2 + 3)i\n= √2 + (-3√2)i\n\nWait, let me check that again. The real parts: 2 + √2 minus 2 is √2. The imaginary parts: the original z has an imaginary part of -(3 + 3√2)i, so that's -3i - 3√2 i. Then subtracting c's imaginary part, which is -3i, so subtracting a negative is adding. So:\n\nImaginary part: (-3 - 3√2)i - (-3i) = (-3 - 3√2 + 3)i = (-3√2)i. Yeah, that's right. So z - c simplifies to √2 - 3√2 i. Hmm, that's a bit simpler.\n\nNow, I need to multiply this by e^{iπ/4}, which is √2/2 + i√2/2. Let me write that as (√2/2)(1 + i). Maybe that's easier to handle.\n\nSo, multiplying (√2 - 3√2 i) by (√2/2)(1 + i). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, factor out the √2 from the first term. The first term is √2*(1 - 3i). Wait, actually, let me see:\n\nWait, z - c is √2 - 3√2 i. So that can be written as √2*(1 - 3i). So, that's helpful. So, then multiplying by (√2/2)(1 + i):\n\nSo, √2*(1 - 3i) * (√2/2)*(1 + i) = (√2 * √2/2) * (1 - 3i)(1 + i)\n\n√2 times √2 is 2, so 2*(1/2) = 1. So the constants multiply to 1. So that simplifies to (1 - 3i)(1 + i). That's nice, the constants canceled out.\n\nNow, let's compute (1 - 3i)(1 + i). Let's use distributive property:\n\n1*(1) + 1*(i) - 3i*(1) - 3i*(i)\n= 1 +"

So:\n\n1 + i - 3i + 3\n= (1 + 3) + (i - 3i)\n= 4 - 2i\n\nSo, that gives me (1 - 3i)(1 + i) = 4 - 2i.\n\nTherefore, after multiplying, (z - c) rotated by π/4 is 4 - 2i. Now, I need to add c back to this result because the rotation formula is w = e^{iθ}(z - c) + c.\n\nSo, w = (4 - 2i) + c. Since c is 2 - 3i, let me add them:\n\n(4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i)\n= 6 - 5i\n\nWait, hold on. So, adding 4 and 2 gives 6, and adding (-2i) and (-3i) gives -5i. So, w is 6 - 5i. That seems straightforward.\n\nLet me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, translating z - c, which I did correctly. Then, applying the rotation factor, which was e^{iπ/4} = √2/2 + i√2/2. Then, factoring out √2 from the translated z - c, so √2*(1 - 3i). Then, multiplying by √2/2*(1 + i), which simplified to 1*(1 - 3i)(1 + i). Then, computing that product, which gave 4 - 2i. Then, adding c which is 2 - 3i, resulting in 6 - 5i. Seems right.\n\nWait a second, let me verify the multiplication more carefully.\n\nCompute (1 - 3i)(1 + i):\n\n1*1 = 1\n\n1*i = i\n\n-3i*1 = -3i\n\n-3i*i = -3i² = -3*(-1) = 3\n\nSo, adding them all together:\n\n1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i.\n\nYep, that's"

Let me see if there's another way to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do the rotation using coordinates. Let me think of complex numbers as vectors in the plane. Let me write z and c as coordinates.\n\nFirst, z is given as 2 + √2 (real part) and the imaginary part is -(3 + 3√2). Wait, hold on, the original z is 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i. So, the real part is 2 + √2, and the imaginary part is - (3 + 3√2). So, in coordinates, that would be (2 + √2, - (3 + 3√2)). \n\nWait, but in the Asymptote code, they have Z = (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3*sqrt(2)). Which matches, because the imaginary part is -3 -3√2, so that's the same as -(3 + 3√2). So that's correct.\n\nThe center c is (2, -3). So, in coordinates, the point z is (2 + √2, -3 - 3√2). The center is (2, -3). So, to rotate around c, we can translate the system so that c is at the origin, perform the rotation, then translate back.\n\nSo, translating z by subtracting c: the vector from c to z is ( (2 + √2 - 2), (-3 - 3√2 - (-3)) ) = (√2, -3√2). So that's the same as the complex number √2 - 3√2 i, which matches what I had before.\n\nNow, rotating this vector (√2, -3√2) by π/4 counter-clockwise. The rotation matrix for an angle θ is [cosθ -sinθ; sinθ cosθ]. For θ = π/4, cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So the matrix is:\n\n[ √2/2  -√2/"

Then, translating back by adding c, which is (2, -3). So, the final coordinates are (4 + 2, -2 - 3) = (6, -5). \n\nTherefore, the complex number w is 6 - 5i. That matches what I found earlier. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this in terms of complex multiplication. So, if I have the translated z as √2 - 3√2 i, and I multiply by e^{iπ/4} = √2/2 + i√2/2, then I can write the multiplication as:\n\n(√2 - 3√2 i) * (√2/2 + i√2/2)\n\nLet me multiply this out:\n\nFirst, √2 * √2/2 = (2)/2 = 1\n\n√2 * i√2/2 = i*(2)/2 = i\n\n-3√2 i * √2/2 = -3*(2)/2 i = -3i\n\n-3√2 i * i√2/2 = -3*(i²)*(2)/2 = -3*(-1)*1 = 3\n\nSo, adding all these terms together: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i.\n\nSo, same as before, rotated vector is 4 - 2i, then add c (2 - 3i) to get 6 -5i.\n\nAlright, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps using the formula for rotation in complex plane as w = c + e^{iθ}(z -"

So that's correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. z - c = √2 - 3√2 i\n2. Multiply by e^{iπ/4}:\n   - Factor out √2: √2*(1 - 3i)\n   - Multiply by (√2/2 + i√2/2): equals 1*(1 - 3i)(1 + i) = 4 - 2i\n3. Add c: 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 -5i\n\nAll steps check out.\n\nI think that's solid. So, w is 6 -5i.\n\nWait, just thinking if there's any alternative method, perhaps using vectors or something else, but I think the method I did is the standard approach. So unless I made a computational error in the arithmetic, which I've checked multiple times, I think 6 -5i is correct.\n\nI suppose another way is to compute the polar form of z - c, rotate it by π/4, and then convert back. Let me try that method just to confirm.\n\nSo, z - c is √2 - 3√2 i, which can be expressed in polar form as r*(cosφ + i sinφ). Let's compute r and φ.\n\nr = |z - c| = sqrt( (√2)^2 + (-3√2)^2 ) = sqrt( 2 + 9*2 ) = sqrt(2 + 18) = sqrt(20) = 2√5.\n\nThen, cosφ = real part / r = √2 / (2√5) = 1/√10, and sinφ = imaginary part / r = (-3√2)/ (2√5) = (-3)/√10.\n\nSo, φ is in the fourth quadrant, arctangent of (-3√2)/√2 = -3, so φ = arctan(-3).\n\nThen, when we rotate by π/4, the new angle becomes φ + π/4. Then, in polar form, the rotated vector is r*(cos(φ + π/4) + i sin(φ + π"

Then, converting back to rectangular coordinates.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit more involved, but let's try.\n\nFirst, let me compute cos(φ + π/4) and sin(φ + π/4) using angle addition formulas.\n\ncos(φ + π/4) = cosφ cos(π/4) - sinφ sin(π/4)\n\nsin(φ + π/4) = sinφ cos(π/4) + cosφ sin(π/4)\n\nWe know cosφ = 1/√10, sinφ = -3/√10.\n\ncos(π/4) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.\n\nSo,\n\ncos(φ + π/4) = (1/√10)(√2/2) - (-3/√10)(√2/2)\n\n= (√2)/(2√10) + 3√2/(2√10)\n\n= ( (1 + 3)√2 ) / (2√10 )\n\n= (4√2)/(2√10) = (2√2)/√10 = 2√(2/10) = 2*(1/√5) = 2/√5\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, 4√2 divided by 2√10 is 2√2 / √10. Then, √2/√10 is 1/√5, so 2*(1/√5) = 2/√5. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, sin(φ + π/4):\n\nsinφ cos(π/4) + cosφ sin(π/4)\n\n= (-3/√10)(√2/2) + (1/√10)(√2/2)\n\n= [ -3√2/(2√10) + √2/(2√10) ]\n\n= ( (-3 +1 )√2 ) / (2√10 )\n\n= (-2√2)/(2√10) = (-√2)/√10 = -√(2/10) = -1/√5\n\nTherefore, the rotated vector in rectangular coordinates is:\n\nr * [ cos(φ + π/4) + i sin(φ + π/4) ]\n\n= 2"
