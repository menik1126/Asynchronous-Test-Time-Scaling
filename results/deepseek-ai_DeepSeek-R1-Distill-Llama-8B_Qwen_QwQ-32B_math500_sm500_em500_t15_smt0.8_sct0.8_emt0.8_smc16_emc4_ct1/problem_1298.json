This gives me 2 times (x - 5) equals 4 times 3.\n\nNext, I'll distribute the 2 on the left side, resulting in 2x minus 10 equals 12.\n\nNow, I'll add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x. This simplifies to 2x equals 22.\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for x, which gives me x equals 11.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x - 5}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Cross-Multiply to Eliminate Fractions**\n\\[\n2 \\times (x - 5) = 4 \\times 3\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n2(x - 5) = 12\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Distribute on the Left Side**\n\\[\n2x - 10 = 12\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Isolate the Variable Term**\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\\[\n2x = 22\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)**\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = 11\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
