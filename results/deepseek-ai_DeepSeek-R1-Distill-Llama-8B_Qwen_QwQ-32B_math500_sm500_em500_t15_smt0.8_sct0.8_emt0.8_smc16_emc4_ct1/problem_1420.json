The radius of the spherical tank is 6 cm, so plugging that into the formula gives me the tank's volume.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The beaker has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, so I'll use these values to calculate its volume.\n\nAfter calculating both volumes, I'll divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank. This will give me the exact number of beakers required.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\]\nWhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven:\n- Radius of the spherical tank, \\( r = 6 \\) cm\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\pi \\times (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\pi \\times 216 = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\nWhere:\n- Radius of the beaker, \\( r = 3 \\) cm\n- Height of the beaker, \\( h = 8 \\) cm\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{beaker}} = \\pi \\times (3)^2 \\times 8 = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n**Step "
