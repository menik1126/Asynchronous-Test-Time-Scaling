Given that the beaker has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, plugging in these values will give me the volume.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is V = (4/3)πR³. The tank has a radius of 6 cm, so I'll substitute this value into the formula to find its volume.\n\nAfter obtaining both volumes, I'll divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank completely. This division will give me the exact number of beakers required.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( r = 3\\, \\text{cm} \\) (radius of the beaker)\n   - \\( h = 8\\, \\text{cm} \\) (height of the beaker)\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{beaker}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi\\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( R = 6\\, \\text{cm} \\) (radius of the tank)\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{tank}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 288\\pi\\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many beakers are needed to fill the tank.**\n   \n  "
