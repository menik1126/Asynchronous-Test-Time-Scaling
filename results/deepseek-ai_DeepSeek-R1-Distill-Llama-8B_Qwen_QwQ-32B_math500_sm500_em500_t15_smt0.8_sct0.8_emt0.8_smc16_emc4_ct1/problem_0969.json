This means Denali's and Nate's dog counts can change by multiples of \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, I'll consider the scenario where Denali is assigned 4 more groups of \\( x \\) dogs, making her total 16 + \\( 4x \\) dogs, while Nate remains at 12 dogs. The pay ratio should remain the same.\n\nSecond, I'll examine the case where \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, resulting in Denali having 16 + \\( x \\) dogs and Nate having 12 - \\( x \\) dogs. Again, the pay ratio should be consistent.\n\nBy setting up equations based on the pay ratios in both scenarios and solving them simultaneously, I'll be able to find the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies both conditions.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks **16 dogs**.\n- Nate walks **12 dogs**.\n- Dogs are reassigned in **groups of \\( x \\) dogs**.\n\n**Under the New Policy:**\n1. **If Denali starts walking \\( 4x \\) more dogs and Nate stays at 12 dogs:**\n   - Denali's new number of dogs: \\( 16 + 4x \\)\n   - Nate's number of dogs: \\( 12 \\)\n   - **Pay Ratio:** \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16}{12} \\)\n\n2. **If \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali:**\n   - Denali's new number of dogs: \\( 16 + x \\)\n   - Nate's new number of dogs: \\( 12 - x \\)\n   - **Pay Ratio:** \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{16}{12} \\)\n\n**Since the pay ratio must remain the same in both scenarios, we can set up the equations:**\n\n1. \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16}{12} \\)\n   \n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   16 + 4x = 16 \\implies"

Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
