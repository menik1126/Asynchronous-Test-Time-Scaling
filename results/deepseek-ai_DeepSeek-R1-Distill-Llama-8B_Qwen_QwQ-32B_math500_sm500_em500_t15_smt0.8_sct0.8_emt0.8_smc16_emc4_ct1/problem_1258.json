So, the least significant digit is 3.\n\nNext, I'll divide 166 by 6 to determine the next digit, which is the 6^1 place.\n\n166 divided by 6 is 27 with a remainder of 4. Therefore, the next digit is 4.\n\nContinuing this process, I'll divide 27 by 6 to find the digit for the 6^2 place.\n\n27 divided by 6 is 4 with a remainder of 3. So, the next digit is 3.\n\nFinally, I'll divide 4 by 6 to find the digit for the 6^3 place.\n\n4 divided by 6 is 0 with a remainder of 4. Hence, the digit is 4.\n\nNow, I'll combine all the remainders from each division step to get the base 6 equivalent: 4 3 4 3.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's convert the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\) to its equivalent in base six using step-by-step division.\n\n### Step 1: Divide by 6\n\\[\n999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ remainder } 3\n\\]\n- **Digits collected (from least significant to most):** 3\n\n### Step 2: Divide by 6\n\\[\n166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ remainder } 4\n\\]\n- **Digits collected:** 3, 4\n\n### Step 3: Divide by 6\n\\[\n27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ remainder } 3\n\\]\n- **Digits collected:** 3, 4, 3\n\n### Step 4: Divide by 6\n\\[\n4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ remainder } 4\n\\]\n- **Digits collected:** 3, 4, 3, 4\n\n### Final Base Six Number\nReading the remainders from last to first, the base six equivalent of \\(999_{10}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4343_6}\n\\]"
