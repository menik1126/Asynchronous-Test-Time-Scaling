            "output": "To find the base six equivalent of 999 in base ten, I first need to understand what the number represents in base six.\n\nI'll start by expressing 999 in base ten as a sum of powers of six. The powers of six are 6^0, 6^1, 6^2, and so on.\n\nCalculating each power:\n6^0 = 1\n6^1 = 6\n6^2 = 36\n6^3 = 216\n6^4 = 1296\n\nSince 6^4 is greater than 999, I'll stop at 6^3.\n\nNext, I'll determine how many times each power of six fits into 999.\n\nStarting with the highest power:\n999 divided by 216 equals 4 with a remainder. So, the coefficient for 6^3 is 4.\n\nNow, take the remainder and divide by the next lower power, 36:\n999 minus (4 * 216) is 27. Then, 27 divided by 36 is 0 with a remainder of 27. Therefore, the coefficient for 6^2 is 0.\n\nNext, divide the remainder by 6:\n27 divided by 6 is 4 with a remainder of 3. So, the coefficient for 6^1 is 4.\n\nFinally, the remaining 3 is the coefficient for 6^0.\n\nCombining all the coefficients, the base six representation of 999 in base ten is 4*6^3 + 0*6^2 + 4*6^1 + 3*6^0, which simplifies to 4403 base six.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the powers of six**:\n   The powers of six up to the value of \\( 999_{10} \\) are:\n   \\[\n   6^0 = 1, \\quad 6^1 = 6, \\quad 6^2 = 36, \\quad 6^3 = 216, \\quad 6^4 = 1296\n   \\]\n   Since \\( 6^4 \\) is greater than 999, we'll use up to \\( 6^3 \\).\n\n2. **Determine the coefficients for each power of six**:\n   - **For \\( 6^3"
