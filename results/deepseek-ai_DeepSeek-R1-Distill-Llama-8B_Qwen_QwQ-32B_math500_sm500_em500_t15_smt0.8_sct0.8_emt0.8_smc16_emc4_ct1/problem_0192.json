            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation here: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, integer roots are numbers that are whole numbers, both positive and negative, which when plugged into the equation make it equal to zero. So, maybe I can try plugging in some integer values and see if they work. But considering it's a fourth-degree polynomial, that might take a while. Is there a smarter way?\n\nI remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me recall... Oh right! It states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(p/q\\), p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots should be the factors of -14. Since the leading coefficient is 1, q is 1, so all possible integer roots are the integer factors of -14.\n\nSo, let's list all the possible integer roots. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, 14, and their negatives. Therefore, the possible integer roots are: \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\), \\(\\pm7\\), \\(\\pm14\\). That gives me eight possible values to test.\n\nNow, I'll start testing these one by one. Let's start with the smaller integers because often roots are in the smaller numbers, but I can't assume that. Let me begin with x = 1.\n\nPlugging x=1 into the equation:\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14\\).\nCalculating step by step:\n1 + 5 = 6\n6 + 9 = 15\n15 - 1 = 14\n14 -14 = 0\nWow, so x=1 is a root! Nice, that's one down.\n\nNext, x= -1:\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 -5 + 9 +1 -"

Wait, 52136 +1764: 52,136 +1,764 is 53,900. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 53,900 -14=53,886. Definitely not zero.\n\nTesting x=-14 would be a huge number, but let's see:\n(-14)^4=14^4=38416,\n5*(-14)^3=5*(-2744)= -13720,\n9*(-14)^2=9*196=1764,\nSo plugging in:\n38416 -13720=24696\n24696 +1764=26460\n26460 -(-14) is 26460+14=26474\n26474 -14=26460. Not zero.\n\nSo, the possible integer roots are 1 and -2. But wait, is that all? Because we can factor the polynomial using these roots.\n\nSince x=1 and x=-2 are roots, (x-1) and (x+2) are factors of the polynomial. So, let's perform polynomial division to factor them out.\n\nFirst, let's divide the polynomial by (x - 1).

Perfect, so no remainder.\n\nSo, after division by (x-1), we have the polynomial as (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, we have a cubic polynomial: x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14.\n\nLet's try to factor this cubic.

Perfect, x=-2 is a root again.\n\nSo, we can factor out (x +2) from the cubic.

Let's check if this quadratic has any real roots. The discriminant is \\(b^2 -4ac = 16 -28 = -12\\), which is negative, so no real roots, hence no integer roots.\n\nTherefore, the only integer roots of the original equation are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nI should double-check my work to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, verifying x=1:\n1 +5 +9 -1 -14 =0.
