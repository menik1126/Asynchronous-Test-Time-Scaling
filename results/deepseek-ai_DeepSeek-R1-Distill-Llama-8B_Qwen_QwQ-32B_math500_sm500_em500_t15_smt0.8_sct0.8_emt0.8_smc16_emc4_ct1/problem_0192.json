            "output": "Okay, so I've got this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem is useful for finding possible rational roots. The theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at the equation, the leading coefficient is 1 (since the term with \\(x^4\\) is 1 times \\(x^4\\)), so the denominator \\(q\\) has to be 1. That means all possible rational roots are integers that divide the constant term, which is -14.\n\nSo the possible integer roots are the factors of -14. Let me list them out. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14, so considering both positive and negative, the possible integer roots are: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nAlright, now I need to test these possible roots in the equation to see which ones satisfy it, meaning when I plug them into the equation, it equals zero.\n\nLet me start with the smallest absolute value in case there are multiple roots. Trying x = 1 first.\n\nPlugging x=1:\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 -14\\)\nCalculating:\n1 + 5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0. Oh, so x=1 is a root!\n\nGreat, so (x - 1) is a factor. Now, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor the polynomial.\n\nLet me try synthetic division with root x=1.\n\nSetting up synthetic division:\n1 | 1  5   9   -1   -14\n            1   6    15    14\n        -------------------------\n            1  6   15    14     0\n\nSo the coefficients after division are 1"

            "output": ", 6, 15, 14, which gives the quotient polynomial: \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\).\n\nNow I need to factor this cubic polynomial: \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\). Again, applying the Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 14, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nTesting x = -1 first:\n(-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 +15(-1) +14 = -1 + 6 -15 +14\nCalculating:\n-1 +6 is 5, 5 -15 is -10, -10 +14 is 4. Not zero, so x=-1 isn't a root.\n\nTesting x = -2:\n(-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 +15(-2) +14 = -8 + 24 -30 +14\nCalculating:\n-8 +24 is 16, 16 -30 is -14, -14 +14 is 0. So x=-2 is a root!\n\nAwesome, so (x + 2) is another factor. Now, perform synthetic division on the cubic polynomial with x=-2.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n-2 | 1  6   15   14\n           -2   -8   -14\n       -----------------\n           1  4   7     0\n\nSo the quotient is \\(x^2 + 4x + 7\\). Now, we have the polynomial factored as (x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7).\n\nNow, we need to check if the quadratic \\(x^2 + 4x + 7\\) has any integer roots. Applying the Rational Root Theorem again. The possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b17.\n\nTesting x = -1:\n(-1)^2 + 4(-1) +7 = 1 -4 +7 = 4 \u2260 0\n\nTesting x = 1:\n1 +4 +7 = 12 \u2260 0\n\nTesting x = -7:\n49 + (-28) +7 = 28 \u22600\n\nTesting x=7:\n49 +28 +7=84 \u22600\n\nSo the quadratic doesn't have any integer roots. Therefore, the only"

I tested 1, -1, -2, and others. Since the remaining quadratic doesn't factor further over integers, these are the only integer roots.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014did I test x=-14? No, but considering that it's a fourth-degree polynomial, there can be up to four roots, but not necessarily integer.
