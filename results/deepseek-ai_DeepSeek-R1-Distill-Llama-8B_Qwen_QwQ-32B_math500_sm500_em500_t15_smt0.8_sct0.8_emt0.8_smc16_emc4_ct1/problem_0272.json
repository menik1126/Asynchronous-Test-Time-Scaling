The sequence starts with positive numbers and then subtracts the next number.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, I can group the terms in pairs. Each pair consists of a positive number followed by a negative number. For example, (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + ... + (99 - 100).\n\nCalculating each pair, I find that each pair equals -1. Since there are 50 such pairs (because 100 divided by 2 is 50), the total sum becomes -1 multiplied by 50, which equals -50.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the series is -50.\n</think>\n\nLet's compute the series step by step.\n\n**Given Series:**\n\\[ 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100 \\]\n\n**Step 1: Group the Terms in Pairs**\nNotice that the series alternates between addition and subtraction.
