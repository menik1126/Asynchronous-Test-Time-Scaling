I notice that each pair of numbers adds up to a specific value, but because of the alternating signs, each pair effectively becomes negative or positive alternately.\n\nSo, grouping the terms into pairs: (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + ... + (99 - 100). Each of these pairs equals -1.\n\nThere are 50 such pairs in total because 100 divided by 2 is 50.\n\nNow, multiplying the sum of each pair by the number of pairs: -1 * 50 = -50.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the series is -50.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the series \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pattern**:\n   The series alternates between subtraction and addition of consecutive integers.\n\n2. **Group the Terms**:\n   Pair the terms to simplify the calculation:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate Each Pair**:\n   Each pair simplifies to \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) = -1 \\\\\n   (3 - 4) = -1 \\\\\n   \\vdots \\\\\n   (99 - 100) = -1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Determine the Number of Pairs**:\n   There are \\(100 / 2 = 50\\) pairs in total.\n\n5. **Sum All Pairs**:\n   Since each pair equals \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   -1 \\times 50 = -50\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Final Answer**:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{-50}\n   \\]"
