            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\nTo do this, I'll start by determining all the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are numbers less than 284 that divide it without leaving a remainder.\n\nI'll factorize 284 to identify its prime factors. 284 divided by 2 is 142, and 142 divided by 2 is 71. Since 71 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p\u2070 + p\u00b9 + ... + p\u207f) \u00d7 (q\u2070 + q\u00b9 + ... + q\u1d50), where p and q are the prime factors, I can calculate the sum of all divisors of 284. This gives us (1 + 2 + 4) \u00d7 (1 + 71) = 7 \u00d7 72 = 504.\n\nSubtracting 284 from this sum, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 504 - 284 = 220.\n\nFinally, I'll find the sum of the proper divisors of 220 by applying the same method. Factorizing 220, I get 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 11. Using the sum of divisors formula again, (1 + 2 + 4) \u00d7 (1 + 5) \u00d7 (1 + 11) = 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 12 = 504. Subtracting 220 from this gives the sum of proper divisors as 504 - 220 = 284.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 284.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of the result obtained from step 1.**\n3. **Sum up the proper divisors obtained from step 2.**\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284**\n\nFirst, we need to find all the proper divisors of 284 and sum them up.\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n  \\[\n  284 = 2^2 \\times"
