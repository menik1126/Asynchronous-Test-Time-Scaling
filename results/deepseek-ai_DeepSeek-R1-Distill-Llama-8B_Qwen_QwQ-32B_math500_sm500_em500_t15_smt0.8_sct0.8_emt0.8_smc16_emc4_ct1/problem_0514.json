            "output": "Alright, so I need to simplify the expression \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\). The goal is to express it in the form \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D})\\), where \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are positive integers, and then find the sum \\(A + B + C + D\\). \n\nHmm, okay, I remember that when you have a fraction with a radical in the denominator, a common method is to rationalize the denominator. To do that, you multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate changes the sign between the terms. So, in this case, the denominator is \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\), so its conjugate would be \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\). \n\nLet me write this out step by step. First, I'll set it up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{(2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the denominator first using the difference of squares:\n\n\\[\n(2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the denominator simplifies to 1, which is nice because that makes the entire fraction equal to the numerator after multiplication. Now, let me expand the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\nUsing the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\nFirst, multiply \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\).\n\nOuter, \\(1 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nInner, \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 2 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nLast, \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nSo, combining these terms:\n\n\\[\n2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, since the denominator is 1, the entire expression simpl"

Let me see how to manipulate the current form into that.\n\nLooking at my result:\n\n\\[\n2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nI can group the constants and the radicals separately:\n\n\\[\n(2) + (2\\sqrt{2}) + (-\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\nWait, maybe I can factor out the 2 from the first two terms, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, notice that the expression can be rewritten by factoring out a 2 from the first two terms, but that would complicate the other terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the desired form: \\(A(1 + \\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D})\\). So, this suggests that the expression can be written as a multiple of (1 + sqrt something) minus another sum of square roots.\n\nLooking at the current expression, perhaps I can factor out a 2 from the entire thing? Wait, but 2 is only in front of \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\) and the 2. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as 2*(1 + sqrt{2}) minus something.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nTake out a 2 from the terms that can be expressed as 2*(1 + sqrt{2}). However, the constant term is 2, which is 2*1, and the other radical is 2*sqrt{2}.\n\nSo, 2 + 2*sqrt{2} = 2*(1 + sqrt{2}), correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\nBecause:\n\n\\[\n2*(1 + \\sqrt{2}) = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nSo, subtracting these gives:\n\n\\[\n2*(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} +"

Perfect!\n\nTherefore, comparing to the desired form \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D})\\), we can see that:\n\n- \\(A = 2\\)\n- \\(B = 2\\) (since the term inside the first parentheses is \\(1 + \\sqrt{2}\\))\n- \\(C = 3\\) (from \\(\\sqrt{3}\\))\n- \\(D = 6\\) (from \\(\\sqrt{6}\\))\n\nTherefore, the sum \\(A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting from the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{1}\n\\]\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n1*2 = 2,\n\n1*(-√3) = -√3,\n\n√2*2 = 2√2,\n\n√2*(-√3) = -√6,\n\nSo altogether, 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6. \n\nYes, that's correct. Then grouping as 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). \n\nYes, because 2(1 + √2) is 2 + 2√2, and subtracting (√3 + √6) gives exactly the terms. \n\nTherefore, the values are A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. \n\nAdding them up: 2+2=4, 4+3=7, 7+6=13. \n\nHmm, seems correct. Let me check if there's another way to represent it, but I think this is the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different grouping, but the problem states the form must be A(1 + sqrt B) minus the sum of two square roots.
