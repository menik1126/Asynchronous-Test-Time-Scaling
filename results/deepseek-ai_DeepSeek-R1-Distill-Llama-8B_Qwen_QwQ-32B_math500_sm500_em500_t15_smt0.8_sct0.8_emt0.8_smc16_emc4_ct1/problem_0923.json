Since larger numbers can contribute more to the sum, I want to minimize the number of large integers in the set.\n\nOne effective way is to combine the smallest prime factors first. Combining 2 and 3 gives 6, and then combining 2 and 7 gives 14. This results in the set {6, 14}, but since 6 and 14 are not distinct, I need to find another combination.\n\nInstead, I can pair 2 with 7 to get 14, leaving me with 3 and 2. Combining 3 and 2 gives 6. Now, I have the set {6, 14}, which are distinct positive integers.\n\nCalculating the sum of these integers: 6 + 14 equals 20. This seems like a good starting point, but I should explore other combinations to see if a smaller sum is possible.\n\nAnother approach is to include more small integers in the set. By breaking down 84 into smaller factors, such as 2, 3, 6, and 7, I get the set {2, 3, 6, 7}. These are all distinct positive integers, and multiplying them together gives 2 × 3 × 6 × 7, which equals 504, not 84. This means I need to adjust my factors to get the correct product.\n\nPerhaps I can include more numbers without increasing the product too much. If I use 2, 3, 7, and 6, the product is still too large. I need to find a balance where the product equals 84, and the sum is minimized.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, I realize that the initial set {6, 14} gives a product of 84 with a sum of 20. Attempting to add another distinct positive integer while keeping the product at 84 results in a larger sum, such as {2, 3, 14}, which sums to 19 but"

Then their sum is 2 + 3 + 14 = 19. That's better than 20. Is there an even better set?\n\nAnother combination: {1, 2, 3, 14}. But 1 × 2 × 3 × 14 = 84. Sum is 1+2+3+14=20, which is worse. But including 1 might not be helpful because it adds 1 to the sum without contributing to the product.\n\nWait, let me see another possibility. The prime factors are 2×2×3×7. To form a set of integers, perhaps distributing the factors into as many small numbers as possible. \n\nBreaking the prime factors into 2, 2, 3, and 7. But they need to be distinct. To make them distinct, I can combine pairs. For instance, 2 and 2 can be combined to form 4, so the set becomes {3,4,7}, but 3×4×7=84. That's good! The sum here is 3+4+7=14. Wait, that seems much better. Is that correct?\n\nMultiplying 3×4×7 is indeed 84. But wait, 4 is 2×2, so that works. So here we have three numbers: 3,4,7. Their sum is 14. That's better than 19, so maybe that's the answer? But did I make a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, let me check another combination. The prime factors are 2,2,3,7.
