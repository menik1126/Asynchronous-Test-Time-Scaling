So I'll remove one 2, leaving me with {2, 3, 7}.\n\nCalculating the sum: 2 + 3 + 7 = 12.\n\nI should check if there's a more optimal grouping, such as including 4 instead of 2 and 2.\n\nIf I use 4 in place of 2 and 2, the set becomes {3, 4, 7}.\n\nThe sum here is 3 + 4 + 7 = 14, which is higher than 12.\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum is 12 with the set {2, 3, 7}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize 84 into its prime factors.\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\nSo, the prime factors are \\(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n\n### Step 2: Combine the prime factors into distinct integers.\nTo minimize the sum, we aim to have numbers as close to each other as possible.\n\n- We can use \\(2, 3,\\) and \\(7\\) directly. However, this only accounts for \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 42\\), which is less than 84. Therefore, we need to include another factor.\n\n- Multiply one of the existing factors by 2 to reach the product of 84. This gives us the set \\(\\{2, 3, 7, 2\\}\\). However, the integers must be **distinct**, so we remove one 2.\n\n- The final set is \\(\\{2, 3, 7\\}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the sum.\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 7 = 12\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe least"
