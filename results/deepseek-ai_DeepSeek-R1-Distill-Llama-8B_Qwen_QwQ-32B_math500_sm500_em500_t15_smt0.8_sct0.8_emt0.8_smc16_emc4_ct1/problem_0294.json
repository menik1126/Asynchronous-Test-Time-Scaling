            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find a complex number w by rotating another complex number z around a point c by π/4 radians counter-clockwise. Hmm, okay. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.\n\nFirst, let's note down the given complex numbers:\n\nz = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i\n\nc = 2 - 3i\n\nSo, z is a complex number, and c is another complex number which is the center of rotation. The rotation is by π/4 radians, which is 45 degrees, counter-clockwise. So, I need to rotate z around c to get w.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? I remember that rotating a point around another point involves translating the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, performing the rotation, and then translating back. So, maybe I should translate z by subtracting c, rotate the result, and then add c back?\n\nLet me recall the formula for rotation of a complex number. If I have a complex number z and I want to rotate it by an angle θ around the origin, the formula is:\n\nw = z * (cosθ + i sinθ)\n\nBut this is when rotating around the origin. But here, we're rotating around another point c. So, I need to first translate z by subtracting c, then rotate, then add c back.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Translate z by subtracting c: z' = z - c\n2. Rotate z' by θ: w' = z' * (cosθ + i sinθ)\n3. Translate back by adding c: w = w' + c\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's compute each step.\n\nFirst, compute z - c. Let's write z and c:\n\nz = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i\n\nc = 2 - 3i\n\nSo, subtracting c from z:\n\nz - c = (2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i) - (2 - 3i)\n\nLet me compute the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\nReal part: 2 + √2 - 3 - 3√2 = (2 - 3) + (√2 - 3√2) = (-1) + (-2√2) = -1 - 2√2"

Since π/4 is 45 degrees, the cosine and sine are both √2/2.\n\nSo, cos(π/4) = sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071\n\nSo, the rotation factor is cosθ + i sinθ = √2/2 + i √2/2\n\nSo, w' = z' * (√2/2 + i √2/2)\n\nLet me compute this multiplication.\n\nRemember, for a complex number a + bi multiplied by c + di, the result is (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i.\n\nSo, let me denote z' as (a) + (b)i, where a = -1 - 2√2 and b = -3√2\n\nSo, a = -1 - 2√2, b = -3√2\n\nMultiply by c + di = √2/2 + i √2/2\n\nSo, let me compute ac - bd and ad + bc.\n\nFirst, compute a*c:\n\na*c = (-1 - 2√2)*(√2/2) = (-1)*(√2/2) + (-2√2)*(√2/2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-1*(√2/2) = -√2/2\n\n-2√2*(√2/2) = (-2√2 * √2)/2 = (-2*2)/2 = -4/2 = -2\n\nSo, a*c = (-√2/2) - 2\n\nNow, compute b*d:\n\nb*d = (-3√2)*(√2/2) = (-3√2 * √2)/2 = (-3*2)/2 = -6/2 = -3\n\nSo, ac - bd = [(-√2/2) - 2] - (-3) = (-√2/2 - 2)"

Apply rotation matrix for 45 degrees: result is (4, -2) which is 4 - 2i\n3. Translate back by adding c: (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 -5i\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the answer is 6 -5i.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of rotating \\( z \\) around \\( c \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) counter-clockwise is \\(\\boxed{6 - 5i}\\).\n</think>\n\nGiven the complex numbers \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\) and \\( c = 2 - 3i \\), we need to find \\( w \\) which is the result of rotating \\( z \\) around \\( c \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) counter-clockwise.\n\n1. **Translate \\( z \\) by subtracting \\( c \\)**:\n   \\[\n   z - c = (2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i)\n   \\]\n   Real part: \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} - 2 = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n   Imaginary part: \\( - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i + 3i = -3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\n   Thus, \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\n\n2. **Rotate \\( z - c \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\)**:\n   The rotation factor is \\( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\).\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i) \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{"
