            "output": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: \"How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?\" Hmm, divisors. I remember that divisors are numbers that can divide another number without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 2 is a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is a whole number. But I guess this question is asking how many such divisors 196 has. \n\nLet me think. I think there's a method involving prime factorization. Yeah, that sounds right. I remember that to find the number of divisors, you first have to express the number as a product of prime numbers, each raised to a certain power. Then, you add one to each of those exponents and multiply them together. That gives the total number of divisors. \n\nSo, first step, I need to find the prime factors of 196. Okay, 196. I know that 14 times 14 is 196, right? So, 14 squared is 196. But 14 isn't a prime number because it's 2 times 7. So, maybe I can break it down further. Let me try that. \n\n196 divided by 2 is 98. Then, 98 divided by 2 is 49. Hmm, so 196 is 2 times 98, which is 2 times 2 times 49. Now, 49 is a prime number? Wait, no, 49 is 7 times 7. So, putting it all together, 196 is 2 squared times 7 squared. So, in exponent form, that's 2² * 7². \n\nNow, according to the method I remember, to find the number of positive divisors, you take each of the exponents, add one to them, and then multiply those together. So, for 2², the exponent is 2, adding 1 gives me 3. For 7², the exponent is also 2, adding 1 gives me 3 as well. Then, I multiply 3 by 3 to get the total number of divisors. So, 3 times 3 is 9. \n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, the formula is (exponent of each prime + 1) multiplied together. So, for each prime factor, you take its exponent,"

            "output": " add one, and multiply. \n\nLet me test this with a smaller number to see if I'm on the right track. Let's take 6, which is 2 * 3. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. That's four divisors. Applying the formula: exponents are both 1, so (1+1)*(1+1)=2*2=4. That works. \n\nAnother example: 4, which is 2². Its divisors are 1, 2, 4. That's three divisors. Applying the formula: (2+1)=3. Yep, that's right. \n\nSo, going back to 196. Since it's 2² * 7², the exponents are 2 and 2. Adding one to each gives 3 and 3. Multiplying them gives 9. So, there should be 9 divisors. \n\nBut maybe I should list them out to confirm. Let's see. \n\nStarting from 1: 1 divides everything. \n\nThen, 2 divides 196 because it's even. 196 divided by 2 is 98. \n\n3? Let's check 196 divided by 3. 3*65=195, so remainder 1. So no. \n\n4: 196 divided by 4 is 49. That's a whole number, so yes. \n\n5: 196 divided by 5 is 39.2, so no. \n\n6: already saw that 3 isn't a factor, so 6 won't be either. \n\n7: 196 divided by 7 is 28. That's a whole number. \n\n8: 196 divided by 8 is 24.5, so no. \n\n9: 196 divided by 9 is about 21.777, so no. \n\n10: 196 divided by 10 is 19.6, nope. \n\n11: 11*17 is 187, 11*18 is 198, so no. \n\n12: 12*16 is 192, 12*17"

So, 14 is a divisor. \n\n15: Already checked earlier. \n\n16: 16*12 is 192, 16*13 is 208, so no. \n\n17: 17*11 is 187, 17*12 is 204, so nope. \n\n18: 18*10=180, 18*11=198, so no. \n\n19: 19*10=190, 19*10+6=196, so no. \n\n20: 20*9=180, 20*10=200, so no. \n\nWait, up to this point, I have found: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Hmm, that's 9 numbers. So that's confirming the formula's answer. \n\nWait, how did I get 28? Oh, because 196 divided by 7 is 28, right? So 28 is a divisor. And 49 is a divisor because 7 squared is 49, and 49 times 4 is 196. So, 49, 28, 98, which is 49*2, and 196, which is 49*4.\n\nSo, listing them:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. \n\nYes, that's nine numbers. So, that lines up with the formula's result of 9. \n\nI guess another way to think about it is that if a number is expressed as a product of primes, each exponent represents the number of times that prime can be used in a divisor. So, for 2², in the divisors, 2 can be used 0, 1, or 2 times. Similarly, 7 can be used 0, 1, or 2 times. So, the number of combinations is 3 for 2's exponents and 3 for 7's exponents, leading to 3*3=9 total combinations. Each combination corresponds to a different divisor."
