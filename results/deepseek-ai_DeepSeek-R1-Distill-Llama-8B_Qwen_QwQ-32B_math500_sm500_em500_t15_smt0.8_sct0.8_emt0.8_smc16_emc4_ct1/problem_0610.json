            "output": "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, I first need to find its prime factorization.\n\nI begin by dividing 196 by 2, which gives me 98. Dividing 98 by 2 again results in 49, which is no longer even. At this point, 49 is divisible by 7, giving me 7. Finally, 7 divided by 7 equals 1. So, the prime factors of 196 are \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nNext, I apply the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is to add one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply these results. This means I take 2 (from \\(2^2\\)) and 2 (from \\(7^2\\)), add 1 to each, giving me 3 and 3, and then multiply them together to get \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 196\n\n1. **Divide by 2**:\n   \\[\n   196 \\div 2 = 98\n   \\]\n   So, \\(196 = 2 \\times 98\\).\n\n2. **Divide 98 by 2**:\n   \\[\n   98 \\div 2 = 49\n   \\]\n   Now, \\(196 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 49\\).\n\n3. **Divide 49 by 7**:\n   \\[\n   49 \\div 7 = 7\n   \\]\n   Next, \\(196 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 7 \\times 7\\).\n\n4. **Divide the remaining 7 by 7**:\n   \\[\n   7 \\div 7 = 1\n   \\]\n   Finally, \\(196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Divisor Formula\n\nIf a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of the form \\(N = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\cdots \\times p_n^{a_n}\\), then the number"
