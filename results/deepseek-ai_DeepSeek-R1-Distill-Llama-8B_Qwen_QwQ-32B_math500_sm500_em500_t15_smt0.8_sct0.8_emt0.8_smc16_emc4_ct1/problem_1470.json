The distance between C and D is 140 meters. There's a hot-air balloon H directly above O, and it's held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. Rope HC is 150 meters long, and HD is 130 meters long. \n\nThe task is to replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. The goal is to find the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the setup. Let me sketch a coordinate system with O at the origin. If I do that, then A would be at (0, a) for some a, since it's directly north. Similarly, B is directly west, so that would be (-b, 0). C is directly south, so that would be (0, -c), and D is directly east, at (d, 0). But wait, the problem says the distance between C and D is 140 meters. Since C is at (0, -c) and D is at (d, 0), the distance between them should be sqrt(d² + c²) = 140. So, that gives me an equation: d² + c² = 140².\n\nBut perhaps it's better to assume that all the points are in standard compass directions, meaning A is (0, a), B is (-b, 0), C is (0, -c), D is (b, 0), since they're directly opposite each other in their respective directions. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the points form a square or something. Hmm. Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, A is at (1,1), D is at (1.5, -0.3), B is at (-1.5, 0.3), C is at (-1, -1), and O is at (0, 0). H is at (0, 2.5). But that's just the Asymptote drawing, which might not be to scale.\n\nWait, maybe I can"

Let me let the coordinates be as follows:\n\n- Let O be (0,0).\n\n- Since A is directly north of O, let's say A is at (0, y_A).\n\n- B is directly west of O, so B is at (-x_B, 0).\n\n- C is directly south of O, so C is at (0, -y_C).\n\n- D is directly east of O, so D is at (x_D, 0).\n\nThe distance between C and D is given as 140 m. The coordinates of C are (0, -y_C) and D are (x_D, 0). The distance between them is sqrt[(x_D - 0)^2 + (0 - (-y_C))^2] = sqrt(x_D² + y_C²) = 140. So that's one equation.\n\nNow, the balloon H is directly above O, so H has coordinates (0,0, h) if we consider 3D, but since all the ropes are from H to the points on the ground, maybe we can model this in 2D with H at (0, h) if we consider the vertical coordinate as the y-axis. Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, H is at (0, 2.5), so maybe in their coordinate system, the vertical direction is along the y-axis. But in any case, let's think in 3D coordinates for clarity.\n\nLet me consider O as (0,0,0). Then H is directly above O, so H is (0,0, h). The ropes HA, HB, HC, HD are the lines from H to each of the points on the ground. The lengths of HC and HD are given as 150 m and 130 m respectively. \n\nSo, the length of HC is the distance from H to C. Since C is (0, -y_C, 0), the distance HC is sqrt[(0 - 0)^2 + (-y_C - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2] = sqrt(y_C² + h²) = 150.\n\nSimilarly, the length of HD is the distance from H to D, which is at (x_D, "

(Equation 1)\n2. x_D² + h² = 130². (Equation 2)\n\nAnd from the distance between C and D, we had sqrt(x_D² + y_C²) = 140, which gives x_D² + y_C² = 140². (Equation 3)\n\nSo, let me collect the equations:\n\nEquation 1: y_C² + h² = 22500.\n\nEquation 2: x_D² + h² = 16900.\n\nEquation 3: x_D² + y_C² = 19600.\n\nSo, let's see, from Equations 1 and 3, we can write y_C² = 22500 - h², from Equation 1, and plug that into Equation 3:\n\nx_D² + (22500 - h²) = 19600.\n\nSo, x_D² = 19600 - 22500 + h².\n\nThat simplifies to x_D² = -290 + h².\n\nBut from Equation 2, x_D² = 16900 - h².\n\nSo, setting these equal:\n\n16900 - h² = -290 + h².\n\nSo, 16900 + 290 = h² + h².\n\n16900 + 290 = 2h².\n\n17200 = 2h².\n\nSo, h² = 8600.\n\nTherefore, h = sqrt(8600). Let me compute that: sqrt(8600) = sqrt(100 * 86) = 10 * sqrt(86). Approximately, sqrt(86) is about 9.2736, so 10*9.2736 ≈ 92.736 meters.\n\nWait, but let me hold on: h² is 8600, so h = sqrt(8600). Yes.\n\nSo, with h known, let's compute y_C and x_D.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\ny_C² = 22500 - h² = 22500 - 8600 = 13900.\n\nSo y_C ="

So, P lies somewhere along the line segment CD.\n\nSo, to replace HC and HD with HP, we can think of this as combining the two ropes into one. The total length of ropes now would be HP instead of HC + HD. So, to save rope, we need to find the point P on CD such that HP is as short as possible, thereby minimizing the total rope length used. The difference between the original length (150 + 130 = 280 m) and the new length HP would be the amount saved. We need to maximize the saving, so we need to minimize HP.\n\nWait, actually, wait. The total rope used before is HA + HB + HC + HD. After the change, it's HA + HB + HP. So, the amount saved is (HC + HD - HP). So, to maximize the saved length, we need to minimize (HC + HD - HP), which would happen when HP is as long as possible.

So, to maximize savings, we need HP to be as small as possible. So, in fact, the problem reduces to finding the point P on CD such that HP is minimized.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nThe current total rope length is HA + HB + HC + HD. After replacing HC and HD with HP, the total rope length becomes HA + HB + HP. So the amount saved is (HC + HD - HP). So, yes, to maximize the savings, we need to minimize (HC + HD - HP), which is same as minimizing HP.\n\nWait, no. Because if HP is as small as possible, the amount saved is (HC + HD - HP) would be as large as possible. So, yes, correct, to save the most, we need HP to be as small as possible.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to think in terms of the shortest possible HP. So the minimal length of HP is the straight line from H to CD, which is the minimal possible distance from H to any point on CD.\n\nSo, yes, the minimal HP is the minimal distance between H and the line CD, which is the perpendicular distance from H to CD.\n\nWait, but CD is a straight line on the ground, from C to D. So, H is at (0,0,h), and CD is on the ground (z=0). So, the minimal distance from H to CD is the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD.\n\nSo, if I can compute that perpendicular distance, that would be the minimal HP, and hence the maximum amount of rope saved.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the equation of the line CD.\n\nGiven that, since in our coordinate system, C is at (0, -y_C, 0) and D is at (x_D, 0, 0), so the line CD can be parameterized as:\n\nx = x_D * t,\n\ny = -y_C + (0 + y_C) * t,\n\nz = 0,\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nWait, alternatively, since the line CD goes from C(0, -y_C, 0) to D(x"

So, yes, y = -y_C + y_C * s.\n\nAlternatively, the vector from C to D is (x_D - 0, 0 - (-y_C)) = (x_D, y_C). So, the parametric equation can be written as:\n\n(x, y) = (0, -y_C) + s*(x_D, y_C), where s ∈ [0,1].\n\nSo, the coordinates are:\n\nx = x_D * s,\n\ny = -y_C + y_C * s,\n\nfor s between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, the point H is at (0,0,h).

So, the distance HP is sqrt( (x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2 ) = sqrt(x² + y² + h²).\n\nTherefore, to minimize HP, we need to minimize sqrt(x² + y² + h²) where (x,y) lies on CD.\n\nAlternatively, since sqrt is a monotonic function, we can minimize the square of the distance, which is x²"
