A is directly north of O, B is directly west of O, C is directly south of O, and D is directly east of O. The distance between C and D is 140 meters. There's a hot-air balloon at point H, which is directly above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. The lengths given are HC = 150 meters and HD = 130 meters. \n\nThe goal is to replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. We need to find the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this. So, essentially, I need to figure out how much we can reduce the total rope length by combining HC and HD into HP.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the setup. O is the origin, with A north, B west, C south, and D east. So, if I imagine a coordinate system, O is at (0,0), A is at (0, some positive y), but since it's directly north, maybe (0, a). Similarly, B is directly west, so maybe (-b, 0). C is directly south, so maybe (0, -c). D is directly east, so (d, 0). The distance between C and D is 140 meters, which is the straight line between (0, -c) and (d, 0). \n\nBut wait, actually, in the Asymptote code provided, it defines the coordinates like A=(1,1), D=(1.5,-.3), B=(-1.5,.3), C=(-1,-1), O=(0,0), H=(0,2.5). Hmm, so in the drawing, A is northeast, B is southwest, C is southeast, D is northeast but lower. But the exact positions might not matter because the problem gives distances. So, maybe it's better to think in terms of variables.\n\nLet me define O as the origin (0,0). Then, since A is directly north of O, A has coordinates (0, a) for some a. Similarly, B is directly west, so (-b, 0), C is directly south, so (0,"

So that gives us one equation: d² + c² = 140². \n\nNow, the balloon H is directly above O, so its coordinates would be (0,0,h), where h is the height. Since HA is a rope from H to A, which is (0,a), then the length HA is sqrt((0 - 0)^2 + (a - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2) = sqrt(a² + h²). Similarly, HB is sqrt(b² + h²), HC is sqrt(c² + h²), and HD is sqrt(d² + h²). \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, they give the lengths of HC and HD as 150 and 130, respectively. So:\n\nHC = sqrt(c² + h²) = 150,\n\nHD = sqrt(d² + h²) = 130. \n\nSo, we can write two equations here:\n\n(1) c² + h² = 150²,\n\n(2) d² + h² = 130²,\n\nAnd from the distance between C and D, we have (3) c² + d² = 140².\n\nWait, but if I have equations (1), (2), and (3), can I solve for c, d, h?\n\nLet me see. Let me subtract equation (2) from equation (1):\n\n(c² + h²) - (d² + h²) = 150² - 130²\n\nSo, c² - d² = (150 - 130)(150 + 130) = 20 * 280 = 5600.\n\nOn the other hand, from equation (3): c² + d² = 140² = 19600.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\nc² + d² = 19600,\n\nc² - d² = 5600.\n\nAdding these two equations: 2c² = "

Let me compute these:\n\nsqrt(12600) = sqrt(100*126) = 10*sqrt(126). Hmm, sqrt(126) is approx 11.225, so c ≈ 10*11.225 ≈ 112.25 m.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(7000) = sqrt(100*70) = 10*sqrt(70) ≈ 10*8.366 ≈ 83.66 m.\n\nSo, c ≈ 112.25 m, d ≈ 83.66 m, and then from equation (1):\n\nc² + h² = 150² => 12600 + h² = 22500 => h² = 9900 => h = sqrt(9900) ≈ 99.498 m.\n\nSo, the height h is approximately 99.5 meters.\n\nNow, the original total rope length for ropes HC and HD is 150 + 130 = 280 meters.\n\nNow, if we replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line segment CD, then the total rope length would be the length of HP. But wait, to hold the balloon in place, the point P must satisfy that HP must be equal in length to both HC and HD? Or is it that the balloon must remain at H?\n\nWait, no, replacing HC and HD with HP. So, before, the balloon was held by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, HD. So, when replacing HC and HD with HP, the balloon is still held by HA, HB, and HP. So, does that mean HP has to be equal in length to HC and HD? Or is HP somehow a replacement for both ropes?\n\nWait, no. Let's think about it. Before, the balloon is supported by four ropes. Now, instead of having HC and HD, we have HP. So, now, the balloon is supported by HA, HB, and HP. So, HP must be at least as long as HC and HD? Or, more precisely, the combination of the two.\n\nWait, no,"

So, the total rope length used is HA + HB + HP instead of HA + HB + HC + HD. Therefore, the saving is (HC + HD) - HP. So, to maximize the saving, we need to minimize HP. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible length of HP where P is on CD, and then the maximum saving is (150 + 130) - HP_min.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find the minimal length of HP where P is on CD. Since H is fixed at (0,0,h), and P is a point on CD. Let me formalize this.\n\nFirst, let's set up coordinates. Let me use coordinates with O at (0,0). Let me define coordinates for all points:\n\n- O is (0,0).\n\n- A is (0, a), where a is the distance from O to A. But actually, since HA is a rope, but we don't have its length given. However, since we have HC and HD, maybe we can find coordinates in terms of variables.\n\nWait, but actually, since we already found c and d, and h, perhaps we can assign coordinates numerically?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use coordinates with O at (0,0), so:\n\n- Point C is (0, -c), since it's directly south of O.\n\n- Point D is (d, 0), directly east of O.\n\nTherefore, the line CD connects (0, -c) to (d, 0). So, any point P on CD can be parametrized as moving from C to D. Let me parameterize P as follows:\n\nLet me let t be a parameter between 0 and 1, where t=0 corresponds to point C (0, -c) and t=1 corresponds to D (d, 0). Then, the coordinates of P can be written as:\n\nP = (d*t, -c*(1 - t))\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nAt t=0: (0, -c), which is C.\n\nAt t=1: (d, 0), which is D. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to write the parametric equations for CD. The vector from C to D is ("

So, P = (d*t, c*(t - 1)).\n\nAlternatively, it might be better to write in terms of a scalar multiple along CD.\n\nSo, the length of HP is the distance from H to P, which is at (0,0,h) to (d*t, c*(t - 1)).\n\nSo, the distance squared would be:\n\n(d*t)^2 + (c*(t - 1))^2 = h² + [distance PH]^2.\n\nWait, no, the distance from H to P is sqrt( (d*t - 0)^2 + (c*(t - 1) - h)^2 ). But since H is (0,0,h), and P is (d*t, c*(t - 1)), so the distance is sqrt( (d*t)^2 + (c*(t - 1) - h)^2 ).\n\nBut h is known, approximately 99.5 m. However, perhaps in exact terms, h = sqrt(9900) = 99.498 approx. So, in any case, h is fixed.\n\nSo, to find the minimal HP, we need to minimize the expression:\n\nsqrt( (d*t)^2 + (c*(t - 1) - h)^2 )\n\nBut to minimize this distance, it's equivalent to minimizing the squared distance:\n\n(d² * t²) + (c² * (t - 1)^2 - 2*c*h*(t - 1) + h²)\n\nSo, let's write it as:\n\nd² t² + c² (t² - 2t + 1) - 2 c h (t - 1) + h²\n\nExpanding:\n\n= d² t² + c² t² - 2 c² t + c² - 2 c h t + 2 c h + h²\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= (d² + c²) t² + (-2 c² - 2 c h) t + (c² + 2 c h"

Let me note that.\n\nSo, once we have t, we can plug back into the expression for f(t) to get the minimal squared distance, then take the square root for HP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute this more directly.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for H and the line CD, the minimal distance from H to the line CD is the perpendicular distance. Wait, but H is above the plane, so the minimal distance from H to the line CD would be the 3D distance. Wait, but in this case, the point P is constrained to lie on CD, so the minimal HP is the minimal distance from H to any point on CD.

So, the minimal distance from H to CD is the distance from (0,0,h) to the closest point on CD in 3D space. Wait, that point would be the projection of H onto CD. But is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because the projection of H onto CD would be a point P on CD such that HP is perpendicular to CD.

So, if I imagine a vertical line from O to H, then the point P on CD closest to H would form a right triangle with O, P, and H.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps we can think of it as the minimal HP is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the minimal distance from O to CD, and the other leg is h.\n\nWait, maybe. Let me try that.\n\nWhat is the minimal distance from O to CD? So, in the plane, the minimal distance from O to CD is the perpendicular distance.\n\nGiven that CD is from (0, -c) to (d, 0). So, the equation of line CD can be found.\n\nLet me find the distance from O (0,0) to line CD.\n\nFirst, find the equation of line CD.\n\nPoints C (0, -c) and D (d, 0).\n\nSlope of CD is m = (0 - (-c))/(d - 0) = c / d.\n\nTherefore, equation of CD is y -"
