            "output": "First, let's define the number of blue and yellow marbles at the beginning. Let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles. Therefore, we can express the initial numbers as:\n- Blue marbles: 4x\n- Yellow marbles: 3x\n\nNext, we add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles. This changes the number of each type of marble:\n- New blue marbles: 4x + 5\n- New yellow marbles: 3x - 3\n\nAfter these changes, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles becomes 7:3. This gives us the equation:\n(4x + 5) / (3x - 3) = 7/3\n\nTo solve for x, we'll cross-multiply:\n3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\nNext, we'll bring like terms together by subtracting 12x from both sides:\n15 = 9x - 21\n\nThen, add 21 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n36 = 9x\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 9 to find the value of x:\nx = 4\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can determine the initial number of blue marbles:\nInitial blue marbles = 4x = 4 * 4 = 16\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nLet:\n- \\( B \\) = Number of blue marbles initially.\n- \\( Y \\) = Number of yellow marbles initially.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Ratio**\n\nGiven the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 4:3 \\), we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{4}{3}Y \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Changes**\n\nAdd 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles:\n- New number"
