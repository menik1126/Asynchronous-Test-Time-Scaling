The problem states two main properties:\n\n1. For every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is a geometric sequence.\n2. For every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAdditionally, we're given that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\), and we need to find \\( a_1 \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let's try to unpack this step by step. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms must be positive integers and each term is larger than the previous one. That should help with ensuring the sequences are well-defined.\n\nFirst, let's understand the first property. For every \\( k \\), the three terms \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) form a geometric sequence. Remember, in a geometric sequence, each term is a multiple of the previous one by a common ratio, say \\( r \\). So, \\( a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \\times r \\) and \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} \\times r = a_{2k-1} \\times r^2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, the second property says that \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) form an arithmetic sequence. In an arithmetic sequence, each term is a sum of the previous term and a common difference, say \\( d \\). So, \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d \\) and \\( a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d = a_{2k} + 2d \\).\n\nSo, combining these two properties, we can relate the geometric and arithmetic conditions. Let me try to write down these relationships for a general \\( k \\).\n\nFrom the geometric sequence:\n- \\( a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \\times r \\) (1)\n- \\( a_{2"

But from equation (1), \\( a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \\times r \\). Therefore, substituting into equation (3), we get:\n\n\\( a_{2k+1} = (a_{2k-1} \\times r) + d \\).\n\nBut from equation (2), \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k-1} \\times r^2 \\).
