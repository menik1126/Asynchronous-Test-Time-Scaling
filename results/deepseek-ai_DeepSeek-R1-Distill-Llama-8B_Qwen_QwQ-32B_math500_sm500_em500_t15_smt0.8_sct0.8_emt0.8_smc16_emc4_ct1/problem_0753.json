The problem says that for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} forms a geometric sequence, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} forms an arithmetic sequence. Also, I know that a_{13} is 2016, and I need to find a_1.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand what the problem is saying. A geometric sequence has each term multiplied by a common ratio, so for the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, this means that a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k}, which implies that the ratio r is consistent. So, a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r and a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r = a_{2k-1} * r^2.\n\nOn the other hand, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence, which means that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}, which implies that 2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}. Therefore, a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}.\n\nLet me denote the terms in terms of a geometric ratio and common difference. Wait, but since the first part is geometric and the second is arithmetic, perhaps I can relate the geometric ratio and the common difference.\n\nLet me denote r as the common ratio for the geometric sequences, so that a_{2k+1} = a_{2k-1} * r^2. Also, since the arithmetic sequence part gives me a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}, I can express a_{2k+2} in terms of a_{2k} and a_{2k+1}"

Let me check the indices again. The problem states that for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. So for each k, the triplet starting at the (2k-1)th term is geometric. So the next triplet after that would be for k+1, which is a_{2(k+1)-1} = a_{2k+1}, a_{2(k+1)}, a_{2k+3}.
