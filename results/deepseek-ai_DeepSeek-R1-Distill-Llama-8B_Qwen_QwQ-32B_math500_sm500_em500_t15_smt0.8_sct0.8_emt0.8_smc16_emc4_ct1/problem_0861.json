What is the value of \\(x\\)?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   \n   According to the problem, half of \\(3x - 9\\) is equal to \\(x + 37\\). This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eliminate the Fraction:**\n   \n   To simplify the equation, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\times (x + 37)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides:\n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to gather like terms:\n   \\[\n   3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \n   Next, add 9 to both sides to isolate \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x - 9 + 9 = 74 + 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 83\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{83}\n\\]"
