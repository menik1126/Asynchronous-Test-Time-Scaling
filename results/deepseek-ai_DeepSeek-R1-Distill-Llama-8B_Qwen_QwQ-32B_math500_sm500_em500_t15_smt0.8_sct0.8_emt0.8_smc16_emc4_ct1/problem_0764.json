The problem is about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers, denoted as \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots\\). There are two important properties mentioned:\n\n1. For every positive integer \\(k\\), the subsequence \\(a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}\\) is geometric.\n2. For every positive integer \\(k\\), the subsequence \\(a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}\\) is arithmetic.\n\nAdditionally, we're given that \\(a_{13} = 2016\\), and we need to find \\(a_1\\).\n\nAlright, let me digest this information.\n\nFirst, let's recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are. A geometric sequence has the property that each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, \\(r\\). So, for a geometric sequence, \\(b_2 = b_1 \\times r\\) and \\(b_3 = b_2 \\times r = b_1 \\times r^2\\), and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, an arithmetic sequence has the property that each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference, called the common difference, \\(d\\). So, \\(c_2 = c_1 + d\\) and \\(c_3 = c_2 + d = c_1 + 2d\\), etc.\n\nGiven these definitions, let's try to model the sequences as per the problem.\n\nGiven the sequence \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots\\), for every positive integer \\(k\\), the terms \\(a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}\\) form a geometric sequence. Similarly, the terms \\(a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}\\) form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo, for \\(k=1\\), we have:\n\n- Geometric: \\(a_1, a_2, a_3\\)\n- Arithmetic: \\(a_2, a_3, a_4\\)\n\nFor \\(k=2\\):\n\n- Geometric: \\(a_3"

So, each pair of consecutive terms, starting from an odd index, forms a geometric progression, and the next pair, starting from the next even index, forms an arithmetic progression.\n\nGiven that the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms must be positive integers, and each term must be larger than the previous one.\n\nWe are to find \\(a_1\\), given \\(a_{13} = 2016\\). Let me see how we can approach this.\n\nPerhaps, we can find a general formula for \\(a_n\\) in terms of \\(a_1\\) or another initial term, and then use \\(a_{13} = 2016\\) to solve for \\(a_1\\).\n\nLet me try to express the relations step by step for the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nStarting with \\(k=1\\):\n\n1. Geometric sequence: \\(a_1, a_2, a_3\\)\n\nSo, \\(a_2 = a_1 \\times r_1\\) and \\(a_3 = a_2 \\times r_1 = a_1 \\times r_1^2\\), where \\(r_1\\) is the common ratio for the first geometric progression.\n\n2. Arithmetic sequence: \\(a_2, a_3, a_4\\)\n\nHere, \\(a_3 = a_2 + d_1\\) and \\(a_4 = a_3 + d_1 = a_2 + 2d_1\\). So, \\(a_4 = a_2 + 2(d_1)\\).\n\nBut wait, \\(a_3\\) is also equal to \\(a_1 \\times r_1^2\\). But from the arithmetic progression, \\(a_3 = a_2 + d_1 = a_1 r_1 + d_1\\). Therefore, we can set these equal:\n\n\\(a_1 r_1^2 = a_1 r_1 + d_1\\)\n\nSimilarly, \\(a_4 = a_2 + 2d_1 = a_1 r_1 + 2d_1\\)\n\nNow, moving to \\(k=2\\):\n\n1. Geometric sequence:"
