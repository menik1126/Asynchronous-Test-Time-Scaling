The problem states two important properties:\n\n1. For every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric. That means each of these three terms forms a geometric progression. So, \\( \\frac{a_{2k}}{a_{2k-1}} = \\frac{a_{2k+1}}{a_{2k}} \\), which implies \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k}^2 / a_{2k-1} \\).\n\n2.
