In this case, \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\nTo find all such \\( n \\), I list all the divisors of \\( 24 \\) that are greater than \\( 1 \\). These divisors are \\( 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, \\) and \\( 24 \\).\n\nFinally, I count these divisors to find that there are \\( 7 \\) positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) that satisfy the condition.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) satisfy the condition that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - A number \\( m \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( m = k^n \\).\n   - Here, \\( m = 2^{24} \\), so we need \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Insight:**\n   - The prime factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\) is \\( 2^{24} \\).\n   - For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Find All Possible \\( n \\):**\n   - \\( n \\) must be a divisor of \\( 24 \\).\n   - List all positive divisors of \\( 24 \\):\n     \\[\n     1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( n > 1 \\), exclude \\("
