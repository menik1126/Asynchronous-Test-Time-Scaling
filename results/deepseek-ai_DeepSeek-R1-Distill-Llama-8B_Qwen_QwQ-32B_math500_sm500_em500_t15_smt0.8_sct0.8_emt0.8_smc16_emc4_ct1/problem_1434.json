This means \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nNext, I'll list all the positive divisors of 24. These are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nSince the problem specifies \\( n > 1 \\), I'll exclude 1 from the list, leaving me with \\( n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 7 positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)-th power.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)-th power, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\). This means \\( 2^{24} \\) must be a perfect \\( n \\)-th power.\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization\nFirst, express \\( 2^{24} \\) in its prime factorization form:\n\\[\n2^{24} = (2)^{24}\n\\]\nHere, the prime base is 2, and the exponent is 24.\n\n### Step 3: Determining \\( n \\)\nFor \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n \\)-th power, the exponent \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\). In other words, \\( n \\) must be a **divisor** of 24.\n\n### Step 4: Finding Divisors of 24\nThe positive divisors"
