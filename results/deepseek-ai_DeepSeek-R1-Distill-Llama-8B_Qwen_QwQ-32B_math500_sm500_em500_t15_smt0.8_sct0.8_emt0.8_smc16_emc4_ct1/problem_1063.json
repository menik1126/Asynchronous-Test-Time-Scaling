            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, and there are 6 equal sides, the perimeter is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, I'll find the perimeter of the regular octagon. The problem states that the perimeters of the hexagon and the octagon are the same, so the octagon's perimeter is also 96 cm. A regular octagon has 8 equal sides, so each side length can be calculated by dividing the total perimeter by 8. Therefore, each side of the octagon is 96 cm divided by 8, which is 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   - A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the perimeter of the regular octagon.**\n   - The problem states that the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon.\n   - Therefore, the perimeter of the octagon is also **96 cm**.\n\n3. **Find the length of each side of the regular octagon.**\n   - A regular octagon has 8 equal sides.\n   - Let \\( s \\) represent the length of each side of the octagon.\n   \n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{\\text{Number of sides}} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe length of each side of the octagon is \\(\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\\)."
