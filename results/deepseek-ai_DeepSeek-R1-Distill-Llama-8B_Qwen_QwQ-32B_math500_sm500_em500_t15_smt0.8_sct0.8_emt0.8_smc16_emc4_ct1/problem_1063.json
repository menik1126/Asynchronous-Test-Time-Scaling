Since it has six sides, each with a length of 16 cm, the total perimeter is 6 multiplied by 16, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, the problem states that a regular octagon has the same perimeter as this hexagon. To find the length of one side of the octagon, I divide the total perimeter by the number of sides of the octagon, which is eight.\n\nTherefore, each side of the octagon is 96 cm divided by 8, resulting in 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon**\n   - The hexagon has **6 sides**, each with a length of **16 cm**.\n   - **Perimeter of Hexagon** = \\(6 \\times 16 = 96\\) cm.\n\n2. **Determine the Perimeter of the Octagon**\n   - The octagon has **8 sides**.\n   - Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, its perimeter is also **96 cm**.\n\n3. **Find the Length of One Side of the Octagon**\n   - **Perimeter of Octagon** = \\(8 \\times \\text{side length of octagon}\\)\n   - Let \\(s\\) be the length of one side of the octagon.\n   - \\(8s = 96\\)\n   - Solve for \\(s\\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\ \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
