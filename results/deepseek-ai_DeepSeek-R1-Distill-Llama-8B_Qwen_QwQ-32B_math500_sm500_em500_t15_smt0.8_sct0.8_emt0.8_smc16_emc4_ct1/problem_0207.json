            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x⁴ + 5x³ + 9x² - x - 14 = 0. I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, where do I start? I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me think... Yeah, it says that any possible rational root, p/q, is such that p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this equation, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are the factors of -14 divided by 1, which are just ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. That narrows it down a bit. So I can test these integer values to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet me start with x=1. Plugging in 1: 1⁴ + 5*1³ + 9*1² -1 -14 = 1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14 = 0. Hey, that works! So 1 is a root.\n\nNow, since (x - 1) is a factor, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out. Let me try synthetic division with root x=1.\n\nSet up the coefficients: 1 (x⁴), 5 (x³), 9 (x²), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nBring down the 1. Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient: 5 + 1 = 6. Multiply by 1: 6. Add to next coefficient: 9 + 6 = 15. Multiply by 1: 15. Add to next coefficient: -1 +15 =14. Multiply by 1:14. Add to last coefficient: -14 +14=0.\n\nSo the polynomial factors into (x -1)(x³ +6x² +15x +14). Now, I need to factor the cubic polynomial: x³ +6x² +15x +14.\n\nAgain, let's use the Rational Root Theorem on this cubic. The constant term is 14, leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nTesting x=-1: (-1)³ +6*(-1)² +15*(-1"

            "output": ") +14 = -1 +6 -15 +14 = 4 ≠0.\n\nTesting x=-2: (-2)³ +6*(-2)² +15*(-2) +14 = -8 +24 -30 +14 = 0. Aha! So x=-2 is another root.\n\nNow, factor out (x +2) from the cubic. Use synthetic division again.\n\nCoefficients:1 (x³), 6 (x²), 15 (x), 14.\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by -2: -2. Add to next coefficient:6 + (-2)=4. Multiply by -2: -8. Add to next coefficient:15 + (-8)=7. Multiply by -2: -14. Add to last coefficient:14 + (-14)=0.\n\nSo the cubic factors into (x +2)(x² +4x +7). Thus, the original quartic is factored as (x -1)(x +2)(x² +4x +7).\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero. We already have x=1 and x=-2.\n\nThe quadratic factor is x² +4x +7. Let's check its discriminant: b² -4ac = 16 -28 = -12. Since it's negative, there are no real roots from this quadratic, let alone integer roots. So the only integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, did I miss any possible integer roots? Let me double-check. The original equation's possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. I tested 1, which worked, and -2, which worked. Let me just test 7 and see why it didn't work, in case I made a mistake earlier.\n\nTesting x=7: 7⁴ +5*7³ +9*7² -7 -14. Let's compute:\n\n7⁴ = 2401, 5*7³ =5*343=1715, 9*7²=9*49=441, then -7 -14= -21.\n\nAdding them up:2401 +1715=4116, 4116 +441=4557, 4557 -21=4536 ≠0. So not a root. Similarly, x=-7: (-7)^4=2401, 5*(-"
