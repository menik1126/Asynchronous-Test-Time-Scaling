I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help identify possible rational roots, which includes integers since integers are rational numbers. \n\nFirst, let me recall the Rational Root Theorem. It states that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term of the polynomial and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. \n\nSince the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are simply the factors of -14. Factors of -14 include the integers that can divide into -14 without leaving a remainder, which are: ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. So, these are the possible integer roots I need to test.\n\nNow, I can use the method of substitution to test each possible integer to see if it satisfies the equation. If substituting the integer into the polynomial results in zero, then that integer is indeed a root.\n\nLet me list out the possible integer roots again: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14. I'll go through each one by one.\n\nStarting with x = 1:\nPlugging in x = 1 into the polynomial:\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14\\)\nCalculating that: 1 + 5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0. So, wow, x = 1 is a root! That's one.\n\nNext, x = -1:\nPlugging in x = -1:\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14\\)\nCalculating: 1 -5 is -4, plus 9 is"

Oh, so x = -2 is another root!\n\nAlright, now x = 7:\nPlugging in x = 7:\n\\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14\\)\nCalculating each term:\n7^4 is 49^2, which is 2401.\n5*(7^3) is 5*343 = 1715.\n9*(7^2) is 9*49 = 441.\nSo adding them up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116, plus 441 is 4557.

Definitely not zero.\n\nx = -7:\nPlugging in x = -7:\n\\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) - 14 = 2401 - 1715 + 441 + 7 -14\\)\nCalculating step by step:\n2401 -1715 = 686; 686 +441 = 1127; 1127 +7=1134; 1134 -14=1120.

Although since we already found two roots, perhaps it's overkill, but let's try.\n\nIf x=1 and x=-2 are roots, then (x -1)(x +2) is a factor. So let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor them out.\n\nLet me use polynomial long division to divide the original polynomial by (x -1)(x +2) = x^2 + x -2.\n\nDividing \\(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\\) by x^2 +x -2.\n\nSet it up:\n\nDividend: x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\n\nDivisor: x^2 +x -2\n\nWe'll perform the division step by step.\n\nFirst term: x^4 divided by x^2 is x"
