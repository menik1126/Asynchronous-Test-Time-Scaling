Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I recall that the circle is centered at the origin with a radius of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), since the equation is \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\). The parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\) opens to the right, with its vertex at the origin as well.\n\nNow, both the circle and the parabola are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. That probably means the points of tangency will also be symmetric in some way. So, if I can find two points of tangency, the other two will just be their reflections across the x-axis.\n\nI need to find the equations of the common tangents to both the circle and the parabola. Once I have these tangent lines, I can find their points of intersection with the circle and the parabola, which will give me the points of tangency.\n\nI remember that the equation of a tangent line to a parabola \\(y^2 = 4ax\\) is given by \\(y = mx + \\frac{a}{m}\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope. In our case, the parabola is \\(y^2 = 8x\\), so \\(4a = 8\\) which means \\(a = 2\\). So, the tangent lines to the parabola would be \\(y = mx + \\frac{2}{m}\\).\n\nBut these lines must also be tangents to the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\). For a line \\(y = mx + c\\) to be tangent to a circle centered at the origin with radius \\(r\\), the condition is that the distance from the origin to the line is equal to \\(r\\). The distance from the origin to the line \\(y = mx + c\\) is given by \\(\\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{1 + m^2}}\\).\n\nSo, applying this condition to our circle, we have \\(\\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{1 + m^2}} = \\sqrt{2}\\). But from the parabola's tangent condition, \\("

Substituting \\(c\\) into the circle's condition:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left|\\frac{2}{m}\\right|}{\\sqrt{1 + m^2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSince the parabola is in the first and second quadrants, and the circle is symmetric, I can assume the tangent lines will have positive and negative slopes, so \\(m\\) can be positive or negative.

The Asymptote code draws points A, B, C, D as (-1,1), (2,4), (-1,-1), (2,-4). So, the quadrilateral is formed by connecting these points.\n\nLooking at these points, it's a quadrilateral centered at the origin, with points in each quadrant. So, perhaps the points of tangency are at (1, sqrt(1)) but scaled somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the exact points where the tangents touch both the circle and the parabola.\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach is correct, but perhaps I missed something. Let me try another approach.\n\nAnother way to find the common external tangents is to solve the system of equations for the circle and the parabola and set their derivatives equal at the points of tangency.\n\nSo, let me consider a point \\((x, y)\\) lying on both the circle and the parabola, and also having the same tangent line for both curves at that point.\n\nFirst, the parabola is \\(y^2 = 8x\\), so differentiating both sides, we get \\(2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 8\\), so \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{4}{y}\\).\n\nFor the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\), differentiating both sides gives \\(2x + 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\\), so \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{y}\\).\n\nAt the point of tangency, these two derivatives must be equal. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{y} = -\\frac{x}{y}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(y \\neq 0\\) (otherwise, the derivative would be undefined for the parabola), we can multiply both sides by \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n4 = -x\n"

Hmm, that can't be right. So, this suggests that there is no point where the tangent lines to both curves coincide? But the problem states there are two common tangents. So, maybe my approach here is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the common tangent lines are not tangent to both curves at the same point? Wait, no, a common tangent should touch both curves at their respective points. So, each tangent line touches the circle at one point and the parabola at another point, but the line is tangent to both. So, the points of tangency are different for each curve. Therefore, my previous approach of setting the tangent line equations equal might be better.\n\nWait, let me go back to the first method.
