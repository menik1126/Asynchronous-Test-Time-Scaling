            "output": "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, I will start by finding its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I recognize that 196 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98.\n\nNext, I check if 98 is divisible by 2 again, and it is. Dividing 98 by 2 results in 49.\n\nNow, 49 is not divisible by 2, but it can be divided by 7. Dividing 49 by 7 gives me 7.\n\nFinally, 7 is a prime number, so its only divisors are 1 and itself. Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, if a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the total number of divisors is \\((a + 1) \\times (b + 1)\\).\n\nApplying this to 196, the exponents are 2 and 2. Thus, the total number of divisors is \\((2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of 196.**\n\n   - **196 \u00f7 2 = 98**  \n     196 is even, so it's divisible by 2.\n   - **98 \u00f7 2 = 49**  \n     98 is also even, so it can be divided by 2 again.\n   - **49 \u00f7 7 = 7**  \n     49 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 7.\n   - **7 \u00f7 7 = 1**  \n     7 is a prime number.\n\n   So, the prime factors of 196 are \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\n2. **Use the formula for the number of divisors.**\n\n   If a number \\(N\\) has the prime factorization \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the total number of positive divisors is \\((a + 1"
