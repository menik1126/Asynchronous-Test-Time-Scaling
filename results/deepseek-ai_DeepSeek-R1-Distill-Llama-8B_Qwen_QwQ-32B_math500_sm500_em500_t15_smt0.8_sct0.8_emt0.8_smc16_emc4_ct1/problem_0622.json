            "output": "To determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, I'll start by finding its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, note that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98.\n\nNext, 98 is also even, so I divide by 2 again to get 49.\n\nNow, 49 is a perfect square. Dividing by 7 yields 7. Finally, 7 is a prime number, and dividing by 7 gives me 1.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, if a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the number of divisors is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\).\n\nApplying this to 196:\n\\[\n(a+1)(b+1) = (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors \\(196\\) has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - \\(196\\) is even, so divide by \\(2\\): \\(196 \\div 2 = 98\\)\n   - \\(98\\) is also even, divide by \\(2\\) again: \\(98 \\div 2 = 49\\)\n   - \\(49\\) is a perfect square (\\(7 \\times 7\\)), so divide by \\(7\\): \\(49 \\div 7 = 7\\)\n   - Finally, divide by \\(7\\) to reach \\(1\\): \\(7 \\div 7 = 1\\)\n\n   **Prime Factorization of \\(196\\):** \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Divisors**:\n   - If a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of the form \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the total number of positive divisors is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\).\n   - For \\(196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\\):\n     \\[\n     (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3"
