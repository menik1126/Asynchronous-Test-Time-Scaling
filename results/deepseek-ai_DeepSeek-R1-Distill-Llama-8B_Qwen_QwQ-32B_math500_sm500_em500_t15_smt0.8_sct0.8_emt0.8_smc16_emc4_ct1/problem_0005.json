            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about polynomials, and I need to find P(5) given some conditions. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so P(x) should look like x³ + something x² + something x + constant term. \n\nNext, it mentions that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5. Our goal is to find P(5).\n\nHmm. So, maybe I can think about the Remainder Theorem or polynomial division here. I remember that when you divide a polynomial by a quadratic, the remainder should be of a lower degree, so in these cases, R(x) must be a linear polynomial, right? Because dividing by a quadratic gives a remainder of degree less than 2, which is linear or constant.\n\nLet's denote R(x) as ax + b, where a and b are constants to be determined.\n\nSo, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is x² - 5x + 4, the remainder is R(x) = ax + b. Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3) = x² - 5x + 6, the remainder is 2R(x) = 2ax + 2b.\n\nSo, in both cases, when P(x) is divided by these quadratics, it leaves a certain remainder. Let's think about how to use this information.\n\nI remember that for any polynomial, say P(x), if it's divided by (x - c), the remainder is P(c). But here, we're dividing by quadratic factors. So perhaps P(x) can be written as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nand also\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nWhere Q1(x) and Q2(x) are the quotient polynomials when divided by those"

Since P(x) is degree 3, Q1(x) and Q2(x) must be linear polynomials (degree 1), because dividing a cubic by a quadratic gives a linear quotient plus a linear remainder.\n\nBut maybe instead of dealing with the quotients, I can use the Remainder Factor Theorem in another way. Since the remainder when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4) is R(x), then evaluating P at x = 1 and x = 4 should give the same as R(x) evaluated at those points. Similarly, evaluating P at x = 2 and x = 3 should give the same as 2R(x) evaluated there.\n\nSo, let me write that down:\n\nP(1) = R(1) = a(1) + b = a + b\n\nP(4) = R(4) = a(4) + b = 4a + b\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(2a + b) = 4a + 2b\n\nP(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(3a + b) = 6a + 2b\n\nSo now we have four equations:\n\n1) P(1) = a + b\n\n2) P(4) = 4a + b\n\n3) P(2) = 4a + 2b\n\n4) P(3) = 6a + 2b\n\nBut since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, we can also express it in terms of its coefficients. Let me write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = x³ + cx² + dx + e\n\nSince it's monic, the leading coefficient is 1. We also know that P(0) = e = 5. So e = 5. That's one value down.\n\nSo now, P(x) = x³ + cx² + dx + 5.\n\nNow, let's plug in x = 1, 2, 3, 4 into this expression to get equations involving c, d, a, b.\n\nLet's compute P(1):\n\nP(1) = 1 + c + d + 5 = (1 + 5) + c + d = 6 + c + d\n\nBut from equation 1, P(1"
