            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So it's something like x^3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c. I need to find P(5), given some conditions about the remainders when P(x) is divided by certain quadratic polynomials. \n\nFirst, let me write down what I know:\n\n1. P(x) is a monic cubic polynomial. So, P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + c.\n\n2. When P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So, R(x) is the remainder of this division, which should be a linear polynomial because we're dividing by a quadratic. So, R(x) = d x + e.\n\n3. Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So, again, 2R(x) is the remainder, which would also be a linear polynomial, so it's 2d x + 2e.\n\n4. We're also given that P(0) = 5. Since P(x) is x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + c, plugging in x=0, we get c = 5. So, that gives us one equation right away: c = 5.\n\n5. So, summarizing, P(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + 5.\n\n6. Now, since when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x) = d x + e. By the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when a polynomial is divided by (x - k) is P(k). But here, it's divided by a quadratic, so I think I need to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem approach for polynomials. Specifically, since (x - 1)(x - 4) is a product of two linear factors, the remainder R(x) can be expressed as R(x) = P(1) * (x - 4) + P(4) * (x - 1). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Alternatively, since R(x) is a linear polynomial, we can write it as"

Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3). \n\nAh, that seems better. So, the key idea is that when you divide a polynomial P(x) by a quadratic divisor D(x), the remainder R(x) is a linear polynomial (degree less than 2), and the remainder evaluated at the roots of D(x) must equal P evaluated at those roots. So, for the first division by (x - 1)(x - 4), the roots are 1 and 4, so P(1) = R(1) and P(4) = R(4). Similarly, for the second division by (x - 2)(x - 3), the roots are 2 and 3, so P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3). \n\nTherefore, we can set up equations based on these equalities. Let me write them down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note that R(x) is a linear polynomial, so let me denote R(x) = m x + n. Wait, but in the problem statement, they called it R(x), so maybe I should stick with that notation. Let me use R(x) = d x + e. \n\nSo, equations from the first division:\n\nP(1) = R(1) = d(1) + e = d + e,\n\nP(4) = R(4) = d(4) + e = 4d + e.\n\nEquations from the second division:\n\nP(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(2d + e) = 4d + 2e,\n\nP(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(3d + e) = 6d + 2e.\n\nAdditionally, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, we can also use the fact that P(0) = 5, so that gives us another equation. \n\nSo, in total, we have"
