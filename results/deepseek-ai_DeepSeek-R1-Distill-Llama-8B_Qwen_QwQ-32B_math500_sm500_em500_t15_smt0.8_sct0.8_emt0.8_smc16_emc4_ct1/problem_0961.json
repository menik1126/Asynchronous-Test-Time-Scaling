Denali has 16 dogs, and Nate has 12 dogs.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay will remain the same under two different scenarios. \n\nFirst, if \\( 4x \\) more dogs are assigned to Denali, his total number of dogs becomes \\( 16 + 4x \\), while Nate's number remains at 12. The ratio of their dogs will be \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\).\n\nSecond, if \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, his new total becomes \\( 16 + x \\), and Nat's becomes \\( 12 - x \\). The ratio here is \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\).\n\nSince the ratios are equal in both scenarios, I can set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for \\( x \\). This leads to the equation \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\).\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, I'll cross-multiply: \\( (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x) \\). Expanding both sides and simplifying will result in a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\).\n\nAfter simplifying, the equation becomes \\( x^2 + 16x = 0 \\), which factors to \\( x(x + 16) = 0 \\). This gives two potential solutions: \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = -16 \\). However, since \\( x \\) cannot be negative, \\( x = -16 \\) is not a valid solution. Therefore, the only feasible solution is \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nI'll double-check the calculations to ensure there are no errors in the process. Once confirmed, the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies both conditions is found to be \\( 0 \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks initially **16 dogs**.\n- Nate walks initially **12 dogs**.\n- Under the new policy, dogs are assigned or unassigned in **groups of \\( x \\) dogs**.\n- The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's"
