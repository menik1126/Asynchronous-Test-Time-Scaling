    "question": "Denali and Nate work for a dog walking business and are paid for each dog they walk. Denali is responsible for $16$ dogs and Nate is responsible for $12$ dogs. Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali. Find $x$ if $x\\neq0$.",
