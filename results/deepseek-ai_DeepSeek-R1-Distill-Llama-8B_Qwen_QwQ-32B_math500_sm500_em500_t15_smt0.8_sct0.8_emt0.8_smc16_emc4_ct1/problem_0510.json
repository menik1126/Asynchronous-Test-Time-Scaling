To find the total number of students taking at least one course, I can subtract the 15 students who take none from the total of 360, giving 345 students.\n\nUsing the formula for three sets, the total number of students taking at least one course is equal to the sum of students in each subject minus the sum of students taking any two subjects plus the students taking all three.\n\nSo, Students taking at least one course = C + P + Ch - (C∩P + C∩Ch + P∩Ch) + (C∩P∩Ch)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n345 = 180 + P + Ch - (30 + 75 + 75) + 15\n\nSince the number of students taking chemistry is twice the number taking physics, let's denote physics as P, so chemistry is 2P.\n\nSubstituting Ch with 2P:\n\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - (30 + 75 + 75) + 15\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n345 = 180 + 3P - 180 + 15\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n345 = 3P + 15\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n330 = 3P\n\nDivide by 3:\n\nP = 110\n\nTherefore, the number of students taking physics is 110.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step using the given information.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students in the school: 360\n- Students taking **calculus (C)**, **physics (P)**, and **chemistry (Ch)**: 15\n- Students taking **no courses**: 15\n- Students taking **calculus (C)**: 180\n- Students taking **chemistry (Ch)**: \\(2"
