            "output": "First, I'll start by noting the total number of students, which is 360.\n\nI know that 15 students take none of the subjects, so 360 minus 15 equals 345 students who are taking at least one of calculus, physics, or chemistry.\n\nOut of these 345 students, 180 take calculus. That means the number of students taking only calculus is 180 minus the number taking both calculus and chemistry and those taking both calculus and physics.\n\nHowever, I see that 75 students take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry. But only 30 students take both physics and calculus.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing because the numbers provided don't align perfectly. It's possible there's an overlap or an error in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the conflicting information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the number of students taking both physics and chemistry is 75, as provided.\n\nI'll use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of students taking at least one subject. However, due to the complexities and overlapping numbers, I'll need to re-evaluate the problem step by step to avoid inaccuracies.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the data, I realize that the numbers provided lead to inconsistencies, making it difficult to determine the exact number of students taking physics.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find the number of students taking physics.\n\n**Given Data:**\n- Total students in the school: 360\n- Students taking none of the subjects: 15\n- Students taking at least one subject: 360 - 15 = 345\n\n**Subjects and Enrollments:**\n1. **Calculus (C):** 180 students\n2. **Physics (P):** To be determined\n3. **Chemistry (Ch):** To be determined\n4. **Both Calculus and Chemistry (C ∩ Ch):** 75\n5. **Both Physics and Chemistry (P ∩ Ch):** 75\n6. **Both Physics and Calculus (P ∩ C):** 30\n7. **Students taking both Physics and Calculus and Chemistry (P ∩ C ∩ Ch):** Not provided\n\n**Key Relationships:**\n- **Twice as many students take Chemistry as take Physics:**  \n  Let \\( P \\) be the number of students taking Physics.
