            "output": "First, I recognize that to determine the number of repeating digits in the decimal representation of 31/11111, I'll need to perform division and inspect the pattern of the decimal.\n\nI'll start by dividing 31 by 11111. This involves long division, which may take several steps, but the key is to identify when the remainders start repeating.\n\nAs the division progresses, I'll keep track of the remainders after each step. When a remainder repeats, it indicates the start of a repeating cycle in the decimal.\n\nAfter performing the division, I observe that the decimal begins to repeat after a certain number of digits. The specific pattern of these repeating digits is crucial for determining how many digits are involved in the repeating cycle.\n\nBy analyzing the sequence of digits that repeat, I can identify the length of the repeating segment. This length will be the number of digits that repeat indefinitely in the decimal representation of 31/11111.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), let's utilize the concept of dividing the numerator by the denominator.\n\n1. **Perform the Division:**\n   \\[\n   31 \\div 11111\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Analyze the Remainders:**\n   When dividing 31 by 11111, the key is to observe when the remainder starts repeating. This repetition indicates the start of a repeating cycle in the decimal.\n\n3. **Track the Decimal Expansion:**\n   After performing the division, the decimal begins to repeat after a specific number of digits. The sequence of these repeating digits is crucial for determining the length of the repeating cycle.\n\n4. **Identify the Repeating Pattern:**\n   By examining the pattern of the decimal, we can identify how many digits are involved in the repeating segment.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is a repeating decimal where **2 digits** repeat indefinitely.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
