            "output": "Alright, so I've got this equation to solve: \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\). Hmm, it's a cubic equation, and I need to find its roots. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that cubic equations can have up to three real roots, or maybe some complex ones, but since all the coefficients here are real, any complex roots would come in conjugate pairs. But I'm not sure if this equation has complex roots or not. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the equation, I notice that both sides have similar structures. The left side is the sum of two cubes, and the right side is a single cube. I wonder if there's a way to simplify this equation by expanding or factoring.\n\nWait a minute, the right side is \\((2x - 10)^3\\). I can factor that as a cube of a multiple of \\((x - 5)\\), because \\(2(x - 5) = 2x - 10\\). So, the right side is \\([2(x - 5)]^3\\), which is \\(8(x - 5)^3\\). That might be useful later.\n\nOn the left side, we have \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3\\). I recall that \\(a^3 + b^3\\) can be factored as \\((a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\). Maybe applying this identity here would help. Let me try that.\n\nLet \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). Then, \\(a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\\). Interesting, that's exactly the same as the right side inside the cube. So, \\(a + b = 2x - 10\\), which is the term we have on the right side.\n\nSo, the left side becomes \\((a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\), which is \\((2x - 10)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2]\\). Therefore, the original equation is:\n\n\\[\n(2x - "

            "output": "10)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nNow, I can move everything to one side to set the equation to zero. Let me subtract the right side from both sides:\n\n\\[\n(2x - 10)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] - (2x - 10)^3 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\((2x - 10)\\):\n\n\\[\n(2x - 10)\\left[ (x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 - (2x - 10)^2 \\right] = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, now the equation is factored into two parts multiplied together, each in square brackets. For this product to be zero, either factor must be zero. So, setting each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\(2x - 10 = 0\\)\n2. \\( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 - (2x - 10)^2 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's solve the first equation first:\n\n\\(2x - 10 = 0\\) implies \\(2x = 10\\), so \\(x = 5\\). So, one root is 5. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, onto the second equation. Let me simplify the expression inside the brackets step by step.\n\nFirst, expand each term:\n\n- \\((x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\\)\n- \\((x - 3)(x - 7)\\): Let's compute this. Multiply (x - 3)(x - 7). Using FOIL:\n\n  - First: \\(x \\times x = x^2\\)\n  - Outer: \\(x \\times (-7) = -7x\\)\n  - Inner: \\(-3 \\times x = -3x\\)\n  - Last: \\(-3 \\times (-7) = 21\\)\n  \n  So, combining these: \\(x^2 - 7x - 3x + "

Let's go term by term:\n\n1. \\(x^2 - x^2 + x^2 - 4x^2 = (1 - 1 + 1 - 4)x^2 = (-3x^2)\\)\n2. \\(-6x + 10x - 14x + 40x = (-6 + 10 -14 +40)x = (30)x\\)\n3. \\(9 - 21 + 49 - 100 = (9 -21) + (49 -100) = (-12) + (-51) = -63\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(-3x^2 + 30x - 63 = 0\\)\n\nHmm, let's simplify this quadratic equation. First, I can factor out a -3:\n\n\\(-3(x^2 - 10x + 21) = 0\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0\\)\n\nNow, let's factor this quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 21 and add up to -10. Wait, 21 factors into 3 and 7, and 3 + 7 = 10. Since the middle term is -10x, the signs would both be negative. So,\n\n\\((x"
