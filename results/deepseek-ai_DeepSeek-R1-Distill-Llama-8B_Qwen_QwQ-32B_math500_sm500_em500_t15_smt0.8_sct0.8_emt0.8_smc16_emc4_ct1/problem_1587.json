            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, I need to find the roots of this equation. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with equations involving cubes, sometimes factoring or looking for patterns can help. Maybe I can expand both sides and see if something simplifies. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the left side: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3. I know that a^3 + b^3 can be factored as (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe that will help. Let me compute a and b first.\n\nSo, let a = x - 3 and b = x - 7. Then, a + b would be (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10. Oh, interesting, because the right side of the equation is (2x - 10)^3. So, a + b is equal to the cube root of the right side. That could be useful.\n\nSo, applying the sum of cubes formula: a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Therefore, the left side becomes (2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2). The right side is (2x - 10)^3. \n\nWait, so I can write the equation as:\n\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor out (2x - 10) from both sides. Let me see: (2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2 - (2x - 10)^2) = 0.\n\nYes, that makes sense because if I subtract (2x - 10)^3 from both sides, I get:\n\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) - (2x - 10)^3 = 0.\n\nFactor out (2x - 10):\n\n(2x - 10)[(a^2 - ab + b^2) - (2x - 10)^2] = 0.\n\n"

Therefore, x=7 or x=3.\n\nSo, from case 2, the roots are x=7 and x=3.\n\nWait a minute, but I should check these roots in the original equation because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially when cubing, extraneous solutions can appear.\n\nLet me test x=5 first.\n\nOriginal equation: (5 -3)^3 + (5 -7)^3 = (2*5 -10)^3.\n\nCompute left side: (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0.\n\nRight side: (10 -10)^3 = 0^3 = 0.\n\nSo, 0=0, which is true.

Let me check the degree.\n\nLeft side: (x-3)^3 + (x-7)^3. Each term is a cubic, so when expanded, the highest degree term is x^3 +x^3 =2x^3. The right side is (2x -10)^3, which when expanded is 8x^3 - ... So, the equation is 2x^3 + ... =8x^3 + ... So, moving everything to left, it would be -6x^3 + ... So, the equation is a cubic equation, so it can have up to three real roots, which we found here. So, three roots: 3,5,7. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to see this. Let me think.\n\nLet me set y = x -5. Maybe shifting the variable to center around 5, since 3 and 7 are symmetric around 5. Let me see.\n\nLet me let y = x -5. Then, x = y +5.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n(x -3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x -10)^3.\n\nSubstituting x = y +5:\n\n(y +5 -3)^3 + (y +5 -7)^3 = (2(y +5) -10"
