            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}| for a polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients. The polynomial has distinct integer roots, the leading coefficient a_n is 2, and the constant term a_0 is 66. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that for a polynomial with integer coefficients, if it has integer roots, then those roots must be divisors of the constant term a_0. In this case, a_0 is 66, so the possible integer roots are the divisors of 66. Let me list them out: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66. That's quite a list, but maybe not all of them will be necessary.\n\nSince the polynomial has distinct integer roots, let's denote them as r_1, r_2, ..., r_k. The polynomial can be factored as f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_k), because the leading coefficient is 2 and each root contributes a linear term with coefficient -1. When expanded, the constant term a_0 is 2 times the product of all the roots with a sign based on the number of negative roots. But since a_0 is 66, which is positive, there must be an even number of negative roots or none at all. But wait, actually, the product of the roots times 2 should be equal to 66. Wait, no, the constant term is a_0 = 2*(-1)^k*(r_1*r_2*...*r_k). So, 2*(-1)^k*(product of roots) = 66.\n\nTherefore, (-1)^k*(product of roots) = 33. Hmm, so the product of the roots times (-1)^k is 33. 33 factors into 3*11, and also considering the negative divisors, so possible combinations could be 1*3*11, (-1)*(-3)*11, etc. But let me think about how this affects the product.\n\nSo, if I have an even number of negative roots, then (-1)^k is positive, so the product of the roots is 33. If k is odd, then (-1)^k is negative,"

But since the roots are integers, their product must be an integer, so that's okay.\n\nBut the key is that the product of the roots (times 2*(-1)^k) must be 66. So, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the number of roots. Wait, actually, the product of the roots is (product of roots) = (a_0)/(2*(-1)^k). Wait, maybe I need to re-express this.\n\nLet me recall Vieta's formula. For a monic polynomial (leading coefficient 1), the product of the roots is (-1)^n * a_0. But here, the polynomial is not monic; it's 2 times a monic polynomial. So, if the polynomial is f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), then expanding it, the constant term is 2*(-r_1)(-r_2)...(-r_n) = 2*(-1)^n (r_1 r_2 ... r_n). Therefore, the constant term a_0 is 2*(-1)^n (product of roots). Since a_0 is given as 66, we have:\n\n2*(-1)^n (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 66\n\nTherefore, (-1)^n (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 33\n\nSo, the product of the roots times (-1)^n is 33. Therefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. Wait, actually, if n is even, then (-1)^n is 1, so product of roots is 33. If n is odd, then (-1)^n is -1, so product of roots is -33. So, the product of the roots is 33 or -33, but the exact value depends on the degree n. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the degree, so maybe the degree can be chosen as needed? Wait, but the roots have to be distinct integers, so the number of roots (the degree n) must be at least the number of distinct factors required to get the product 33 or"

So, I need to consider how to choose distinct integer roots whose product is 33 or -33, then arrange them in such a way that when I expand the polynomial, the coefficient a_{n-1} is minimized in absolute value.\n\nBut I also need to consider that a_{n-1} is related to the sum of the roots. Specifically, in a polynomial f(x) = 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), the coefficient a_{n-1} is 2*(-1)^{n-1} times the sum of the roots. So, a_{n-1} = 2*(-1)^{n-1}*(sum of roots). Therefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize |sum of roots| multiplied by 2. So, the absolute value of the sum of the roots should be as small as possible.\n\nSo, our goal is to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33 (depending on n) such that the sum of those integers is as close to zero as possible. Because the smaller the absolute value of the sum, the smaller |a_{n-1}| will be.\n\nSo, let me consider first the product 33. So, the roots multiply to 33 or -33, depending on n. But actually, since 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66, product of roots is 33 when n is even because (-1)^n is 1, and product is -33 when n is odd because (-1)^n is -1.\n\nTherefore, the product of roots is 33 if n is even, and -33 if n is odd.\n\nSo, perhaps we can consider both cases: n even and n odd, and see which gives a smaller |a_{n-1}|.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to try both possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about all divisors of 66, but since the roots are integers, their product must divide 66, but 66 is 2*3*11.\n\nBut maybe let's think of small numbers of roots.

Hmm, that's a higher sum. So maybe fewer roots are better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using 33 as a single root? But then the product would be 33, but then the other roots would have to be 1? Wait, but the roots have to multiply to 33. If we have only one root, then the product is 33, but then the polynomial would be 2(x - 33), but then the constant term would be 2*(-33) = -66, which is not 66. Wait, so that's a problem.

To get 33 as a product of distinct integers, the minimal number of roots is 2? Let's see: 3 and 11, but 3*11 is 33. So two roots. Then the product is 33, so if n is even (since product is 33, so n must be even). So n=2. Then the polynomial would be 2(x - 3)(x - 11). Let's check the constant term: 2*(3*11"

Hmm, that's a pretty large value.\n\nIs there a way to get a smaller |a_{n-1}|?\n\nLet's see. Maybe using more roots with a sum that's zero. For instance, if we can have positive and negative roots that cancel each other out, their sum would be smaller.\n\nSo, let's see: can we write 33 as a product of several distinct integers where their sum is small, preferably zero.\n\nSo, 33 can be factored into 1, 3, 11, but as I saw before, their sum is 15, which gives a_{n-1} as 2*(-1)^{2}*(15) = 30, which would be 30, but wait, in the previous case, with two roots, the sum was 3 + 11 =14, so a_{n-1} was -28. Wait, but for n=2, the polynomial is quadratic, so a_{n-1}= -28.\n\nWait, but perhaps if we take more roots, maybe four roots, such that some positive and negative numbers cancel out.\n\nWait, but 33 is positive, so if we have an even number of negative roots, their product will be positive.

So that's invalid.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me use 1, -1, 3, 11, and another number. Let me see, 1*(-1)*3*11*k = -33k. So, to get -33, k should be 1, which is a duplicate. So that's not allowed.\n\nHmm, maybe include a larger negative number. Let me try: 1, -1, 3, 11, and k. So, the product is 1*(-1)*3*11*k = -33k.\n\nTo get -33, set k=1, but duplicate.\n\nAlternatively, 1, -1, 3, -11, and k. So, 1*(-1)*3*(-11)*k = 33k. To get -33, k would need to be -1, which is a duplicate.\n\nHmm, seems impossible.\n\nSo, maybe with n=5, it's not possible to get a better sum than with n=3.\n\nTherefore, the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 14.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem states that the polynomial has \"distinct integer roots\" and \"integer coefficients\". Therefore, any root can be any integer, as long as they are distinct and the coefficients remain integers, which they will since the roots are integers.\n\nSo, perhaps trying with"
