So, the question is about finding the least possible value of |a_{n-1}| given that the polynomial f(x) has integer coefficients, distinct integer roots, a_n = 2, and a_0 = 66. Hmm, okay, let's unpack this.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial is monic (a_n = 2, but wait, monic polynomials have a leading coefficient of 1. Hmm, maybe not monic, but it's a degree n polynomial with leading coefficient 2. So, f(x) = 2x^n + ... + a_0. And all coefficients are integers. The roots are distinct integers, so it must factor into linear terms with integer roots.\n\nGiven that a_0 = 66, which is the constant term. In a polynomial, the constant term is the product of the roots times (-1)^n times the leading coefficient. So, in this case, since the leading coefficient is 2, and the constant term is 66, then the product of the roots is 66 divided by (-1)^n times 2. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nIf the polynomial is f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), then expanding this, the constant term a_0 would be 2*(-1)^n*(r_1*r_2*...*r_n). So, a_0 = 2*(-1)^n*(r_1r_2...rn) = 66. Therefore, the product of the roots times (-1)^n is 33, because 66 divided by 2 is 33. So, r_1r_2...rn = (-1)^n * 33.\n\nSo, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n. Wait, no, actually, because a_0 = 66 = 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots). So, 66 = 2*(-1)^n*(product), which means product of roots is 66 / [2*(-1)^n] = 33 / (-1)^n. So, the product of the roots is 33 if n is even, and -33 if n is odd. Got it.\n\nSo, the roots are distinct integers, whose product is either"

Let's recall that in the polynomial f(x) = 2(x - r_1)...(x - r_n), the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to 2 times the sum of the roots multiplied by (-1)^{n-1} divided by something? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, let's consider the expansion of the polynomial. Let me write the polynomial as 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n). Let's denote the monic polynomial as P(x) = (x - r_1)...(x - r_n). Then f(x) = 2*P(x). The coefficients of f(x) will be twice the coefficients of P(x). \n\nIn the monic polynomial P(x), the coefficient of x^{n-1} is - (sum of roots). So, the coefficient of x^{n-1} in P(x) is - (r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n). Therefore, in f(x), the coefficient a_{n-1} is 2*(- (sum of roots)). So, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. \n\nWait, so to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Since the roots are integers, distinct, and their product is either 33 or -33, depending on n's parity. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33 (depending on n's parity) such that the absolute value of their sum is as small as possible. Then, multiply that by 2 to get |a_{n-1}|, and find the minimal such value.\n\nBut since n can be any degree, but the roots have to be distinct integers, so the number of roots is the degree n. So, the number of roots is variable here. Wait, but the problem says \"the polynomial has integer coefficients, and its roots are distinct integers.\" So, the degree n is equal to the number of roots, which must be at least "

If the product is 33, then n must be even. So, the number of roots must be even. So, for example, 2 roots: 3 and 11 (product 33, but 3*11=33, so two roots. Then n=2, which is even.

That's better than the 28 in the n=2 case.\n\nSo, that's a better minimal value.\n\nBut maybe we can do even better with more roots.\n\nWait, let's try n=6. Hmm, 6 is even. So, product of roots is 33. Let's try to find 6 distinct integers whose product is 33. But 33 has only a few factors, so that might be tricky.\n\nWait, 33 is 3*11, or 1*3*11. If we need 6 distinct integers, the only possible factors are 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, but that's 6 numbers, but their product is (1)(-1)(3)(-3)(11)(-11)= (1*-1)(3*-3)(11*-11)= (-1)(-9)(-121)= (-1)*(-9)=9; 9*(-121)= -1089, which is way bigger than 33. So, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if we include 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -1, but that's not distinct. Wait, no, the roots have to be distinct, so we can't repeat numbers. So, perhaps using more smaller factors, but 33 is 3*11, which are primes, so it's difficult to get more than three distinct factors. So, probably for n=6, we cannot have distinct integer roots with product 33.\n\nTherefore, n=4 seems feasible with roots 1, -1, 3, -11.

So, 2 can't be a root here. So, the possible roots are limited to divisors of 33, which are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33. So, the possible roots are limited to those numbers.
