There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).\n\n1. **First Letter:**  \n   There are 26 possible choices for the first letter.\n   \n2. **Second Letter:**  \n   After choosing the first letter, there are 25 remaining choices for the second letter.\n\nSince the order of the letters matters, we'll use the **permutation** formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Letter Combinations} = 26 \\times 25\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Letter Combinations} = 650\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Number of Possible Number Combinations**\n\nEach license plate also consists of 2 different one-digit numbers (0-9).\n\n1. **First Number:**  \n   There are 10 possible choices for the first number.\n   \n2. **Second Number:**  \n   After choosing the first number, there are 9 remaining choices for the second number.\n\nAgain, since the order of the numbers matters, we'll use the **permutation** formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Number Combinations} = 10 \\times 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of Number Combinations} = 90\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of License Plates**\n\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, we multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total License Plates} = \\text{Number of Letter Combinations} \\times \\text{Number of Number Combinations}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total License"
