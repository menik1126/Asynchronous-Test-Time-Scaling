Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet and each position must be different, I'll use permutations.\n\nFor the first letter, there are 26 possible choices. After selecting the first letter, there are 25 remaining letters for the second position. So, the total number of combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, I'll consider the digits that can follow the letters. Each digit can be any number from 0 to 9, so there are 10 possible choices for each of the two digit positions. However, since the digits must also be different from each other, I'll use permutations again.\n\nFor the first digit, there are 10 possible choices, and for the second digit, there are 9 remaining choices. Therefore, the total number of combinations for the digits is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, I'll multiply the number of combinations for the letters by the number of combinations for the digits. This means multiplying 26 by 25 and then multiplying that result by 10, and finally multiplying by 9.\n\nBy performing these calculations, I can determine the total number of unique license plates that can be formed under the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nHow many license plates can be formed if every license plate has **2 different letters (A through Z)** followed by **2 different one-digit numbers (0-9)**?\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Number of Letter Combinations\n\nThere are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z). We need to choose **2 different letters** for the license plate.\n\nThis is a permutation problem because the order of the letters matters.\n\n- **First letter:** 26 choices\n- **Second letter:** 25 choices (since one letter is already used)\n\nSo, the total number of letter combinations is:\n\\[\n26 \\times 25 = 650\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Digit Combinations\n\nNext, we need to choose **2 different one-digit numbers** for the license plate. Digits can be from 0 to 9 (total of 10 digits).\n\nThis is also a permutation problem because the order of the numbers matters.\n\n- **First digit:** 10 choices\n- **Second digit:**"
