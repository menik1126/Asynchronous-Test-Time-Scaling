So, the initial equation to consider is \\( x \\times y = 54 \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are both positive integers, I need to find all possible pairs \\( (x, y) \\) that satisfy this equation. Additionally, the problem specifies that \\( x \\) must be at least 2 and \\( y \\) must be at least 5. This means I should focus on the divisors of 54 that meet these conditions.\n\nTo find the possible values of \\( x \\), I'll list all the divisors of 54. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, and 27, and 54. However, since \\( x \\) must be at least 2, I can exclude 1 from the list. This leaves me with 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\nNext, for each of these values of \\( x \\), I'll calculate the corresponding \\( y \\) by dividing 54 by \\( x \\):\n- If \\( x = 2 \\), then \\( y = 27 \\).\n- If \\( x = 3 \\), then \\( y = 18 \\).\n- If \\( x = 6 \\), then \\( y = 9 \\).\n- If \\( x = 9 \\), then \\( y = 6 \\).\n- If \\( x = 18 \\), then \\( y = 3 \\).\n- If \\( x = 27 \\), then \\( y = 2 \\).\n- If \\( x = 54 \\), then \\( y = 1 \\).\n\nNow, I need to ensure that \\( y \\) is at least 5 for all these pairs. Checking each:\n- \\( y = 27 \\) is valid.\n- \\( y = 18 \\) is valid.\n- \\( y = 9 \\) is valid.\n- \\( y = 6 \\) is not valid because \\( y \\) must be at least 5.\n- \\( y = 3 \\) is not valid.\n- \\( y = 2 \\) is not valid.\n- \\( y = 1 \\) is not valid.\n\nAs"
