There are 26 different letters in the English alphabet, and since the two letters must be different, I'll use the permutation formula for 26 items taken 2 at a time. This gives me 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, I'll handle the number part of the license plate. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9), and again, the two digits must be different. I'll use the permutation formula for 10 items taken 2 at a time, which is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of number combinations to find the total number of possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of possible license plates, we'll analyze the structure provided:\n\n- **Letters:** 2 different letters from A to Z.\n- **Numbers:** 2 different digits from 0 to 9.\n\nWe'll calculate the permutations for each part separately and then multiply them to get the total number of license plates.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the number of possible letter combinations.\n\n- **Total letters (A-Z):** 26\n- **First letter:** 26 options\n- **Second letter:** Since it must be different from the first, there are \\(26 - 1 = 25\\) options.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of letter combinations} = 26 \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of letter combinations} = 650 \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of possible number combinations.\n\n- **Total digits (0-9):** 10\n- **First digit:** 10 options\n- **Second digit:** Must be different from the first, so there are \\(10 - 1 = 9\\) options.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of number combinations} = 10 \\times 9 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of number combinations} = 90 \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Multiply the two results to find the total number of license plates.\n\n\\[ \\text{Total license plates} = \\text{Number of letter combinations} \\times \\text{Number of number combinations} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total license plates} = 650 \\times 90 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total"
