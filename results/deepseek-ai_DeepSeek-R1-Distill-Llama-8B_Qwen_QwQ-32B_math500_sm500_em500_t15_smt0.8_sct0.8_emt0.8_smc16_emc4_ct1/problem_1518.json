            "output": "I need to calculate the number of possible license plates that can be created with the given requirements.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the letters. There are 26 different letters in the alphabet, and each license plate requires 2 different letters. Since the order of the letters matters, I'll use permutations for this part.\n\nNext, I'll think about the numbers. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9), and again, each license plate needs 2 different digits. Similar to the letters, the order of the digits is important, so I'll use permutations for the numbers as well.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of possible number combinations to get the total number of unique license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, let's break down the requirements:\n\n1. **Letters:**  \n   - There are 26 different letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).  \n   - We need **2 different letters**, and the order matters (e.g., \"AB\" is different from \"BA\").  \n   - The number of ways to arrange 2 different letters out of 26 is calculated using permutations:  \n     \\[\n     P(26, 2) = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n     \\]\n\n2. **Numbers:**  \n   - There are 10 different digits (0-9).  \n   - Similar to the letters, we need **2 different digits**, and the order matters (e.g., \"12\" is different from \"21\").  \n   - The number of ways to arrange 2 different digits out of 10 is calculated using permutations:  \n     \\[\n     P(10, 2) = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Combinations:**  \n   - Each license plate consists of a combination of letters followed by numbers.  \n   - To find the total number of unique license plates, multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations:  \n     \\[\n     650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe total number of possible license plates is \\(\\boxed{58500}\\)."
