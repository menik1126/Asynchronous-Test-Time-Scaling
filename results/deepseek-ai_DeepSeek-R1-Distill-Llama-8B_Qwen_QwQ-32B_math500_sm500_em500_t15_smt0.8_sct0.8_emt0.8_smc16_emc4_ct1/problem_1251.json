            "output": "First, I recognize that to convert the decimal number 999 to base six, I need to express it as a sum of powers of six.\n\nI'll start by determining the highest power of six that is less than 999. I know that 6³ is 216, and 6⁴ is 1296, which is greater than 999. So, the highest power to use is 6³.\n\nNext, I'll divide 999 by 6³ to find the coefficient for six cubed. Dividing 999 by 216 gives me approximately 4.629. Since I can only use whole numbers, the coefficient is 4.\n\nNow, I'll multiply 4 by 6³ (216) to get 864, and subtract that from 999, leaving a remainder of 135.\n\nMoving on, I'll use 6² (36) and divide it into 135. Dividing 135 by 36 gives me approximately 3.75, so the coefficient for six squared is 3.\n\nMultiplying 3 by 36 gives 108. Subtracting this from 135 leaves a remainder of 27.\n\nNext, I'll use 6¹ (6) and divide it into 27. Dividing 27 by 6 gives me 4.5, so the coefficient for six is 4.\n\nMultiplying 4 by 6 gives 24. Subtracting this from 27 leaves a remainder of 3.\n\nFinally, I'll use 6⁰ (1) and divide it into 3. This gives me 3, so the coefficient for 1 is 3.\n\nCombining all these coefficients, the base six equivalent of 999 is 4*6³ + 3*6² + 4*6¹ + 3*6⁰, which simplifies to 4434 in base six.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Place Values in Base Six:**\n   - Base six represents numbers using powers of six. The places in base six are:\n     \\[\n     6^0 = 1,\\quad 6^1 = 6,\\quad 6^2 = 36,\\quad 6^3 = 216,\\quad 6^4 = 1296,\\quad \\ldots\n     \\]\n   \n2."
