This means there will be 27 six-hundreds in the base six number.\n\nNext, I'll divide the remainder by 6 to find the number of sixes. Dividing 27 by 6 yields 4 with a remainder of 3, indicating 4 sixes in the base six number.\n\nFinally, the remaining 3 will represent the units place in base six. Combining these results, the base six equivalent of 999 is 2433\u2086.\n</think>\n\nTo find the **base six equivalent** of the decimal number **999**, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Highest Power of 6 Less Than 999\nFirst, identify the largest power of 6 that fits into 999.\n\n- \\( 6^0 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 6^1 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 6^2 = 36 \\)\n- \\( 6^3 = 216 \\)\n- \\( 6^4 = 1296 \\)\n\nSince \\( 6^4 = 1296 \\) is greater than 999, the highest power we'll use is \\( 6^3 = 216 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Coefficient for \\( 6^3 \\)\nDivide 999 by 216 to find how many times 216 fits into 999.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{999}{216} = 4 \\text{ with a remainder}\n\\]\n\n\\( 4 \\times 216 = 864 \\)\n\nSubtract this from 999:\n\n\\[\n999 - 864 = 135\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Coefficient for \\( 6^2 \\)\nNext, divide the remainder by \\( 6^2 = 36 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{135}{36} = 3 \\text{ with a remainder}\n\\]\n\n\\( 3 \\times 36 = 108 \\)\n\nSubtract this from 135:\n\n\\[\n135 - 108 = 27\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Coefficient for \\( 6^1 \\)\nNow, divide the new remainder by \\( 6^1 = 6 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{"
