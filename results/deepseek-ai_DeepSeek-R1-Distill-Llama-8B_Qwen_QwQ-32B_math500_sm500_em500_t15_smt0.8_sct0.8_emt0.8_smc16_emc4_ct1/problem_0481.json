The cube has the shortest possible side length. I need to find the volume of the cube in cubic inches.\n\nFirst, let me visualize what's happening here. There's a cube, and from each of its eight corners, they're cutting off a piece of metal to create the sphere. Since the sphere is made from these corner pieces, the sphere must fit perfectly within the cube. That means the sphere can't be larger than the cube in any dimension.\n\nThe sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is twice that, which is 6 inches. The diameter is important because it tells me how much space the sphere takes up in each direction within the cube. Since the sphere is formed by cutting each corner, the cube's edge length must be just enough to accommodate the sphere without any overlap or gaps.\n\nNow, if I think about the cube, each edge is the same length. Let's call that length 's' inches. When you cut off a corner of a cube, you're essentially removing a small cube from each corner. The edge of that small cube (which is actually a corner piece) is determined by how much metal is removed from the corner.\n\nSince the sphere is formed by these eight removed corners, the diameter of the sphere should be equal to the edge length of the cube. Wait, is that right? Hmm, no, maybe not exactly. Because when you remove the corners, the sphere sits inside the cube, touching the centers of each original cube's face. So the diameter of the sphere would relate to the space diagonal of the cube.\n\nLet me recall that the space diagonal of a cube relates to its edge length. For a cube with edge length 's', the space diagonal is s√3. The space diagonal is the longest diagonal that goes from one corner of the cube to the opposite corner, passing through the interior of the cube.\n\nIn this case, the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the cube because the sphere touches the centers of each face, and the space diagonal connects these centers. So, if the sphere has a diameter of 6 inches, that should equal the space diagonal of the cube.\n\nPutting that together: s√3 = 6 inches.\n\nTo solve for 's', I can divide both sides by √3"

Let me think again. Is the sphere's diameter actually equal to the space diagonal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is inscribed within the cube, but in a different way. Normally, an inscribed sphere in a cube touches the centers of the cube's faces, so its diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube. But in this problem, the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners. That might mean that the sphere is actually inscribed in the cube in the standard way, so the edge length of the cube would be equal to the sphere's diameter. Wait, that would mean s = 6 inches. But then why mention removing metal from the corners?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the sphere is not inscribed in the cube in the usual way. Let me read the problem again: \"A steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths.\" So the cube is the original block of metal, and by removing the metal from the corners, you're left with the sphere. Therefore, the sphere must be entirely within the cube, and the cube's edges are as small as possible to just contain the sphere.\n\nWait, but how exactly is the sphere formed by removing the corners? Maybe the sphere is tangent to each face of the cube, so the edge length of the cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which would be 6 inches. But then why remove the corners? Maybe the sphere is not just touching the centers of the faces but is somehow related to the corners?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that the sphere touches the midpoints of the edges or something else. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is inscribed in the cube in the standard way, so the sphere's diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube. So if the sphere has a radius of 3, diameter 6, then the cube's edge length is 6, so volume is 6^3 = 216. But the problem says \"removing metal from the corners of"

            "output": " a cube\", which suggests that the sphere is formed by the removed corners. That might imply that the sphere is somehow formed by those corners, which would require the sphere to be touching the cube in a way that each corner removal contributes to the sphere. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it mathematically. Let's consider the cube with edge length 's'. From each corner, we remove a small octahedral part. The remaining object is a sphere. Wait, no, that's not correct. Removing the corners from a cube doesn't result in a sphere; it's a different shape. Maybe the sphere is formed by the rounded edges where the corners were removed. But no, the sphere is a smooth surface, so perhaps each corner is replaced by a quarter of a sphere, but that would create a shape with flat faces where the corners were, not a smooth sphere.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a different approach. If you remove a small cube from each corner of the original cube, the piece removed is a cube with edge length 'x'. So each corner is replaced by a spherical segment. But if the result is a sphere, then that would require that those eight segments combine to form the sphere.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because each corner cut is a three-dimensional segment. Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is formed by the surfaces of the cube after the corners are removed. So the sphere's surface is the same as the cube's surface after the corners are cut off.\n\nWait, maybe it's like this: when you remove a corner (a small cube), you create a new face on each corner. If you remove eight such small cubes, the original cube's corners are removed, and the space left behind is a sphere.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think in terms of the sphere being tangent to certain points in the cube.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, but the cube is designed such that when you remove the corners, you end up with a sphere. So, the sphere's diameter would be equal to the edge length of the cube. Therefore, the sphere's diameter is 6, so the cube's edge length is 6, and volume is 6^3 = 216.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, considering the problem mentions removing metal from the corners. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is inscribed in a different way. If we consider that"

Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that the sphere touches the cube at the midpoints of the edges. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube in the standard way, so the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's edge length. So if the sphere has radius 3, diameter 6, then the cube's edge length is 6, so volume is 216. But the problem says \"removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths\". If the cube's edge length is 6, then removing the corners would just be removing a small part from each corner, but the sphere is already inscribed. Maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is not inscribed in the cube but is instead the largest possible sphere that can be formed by removing the corners. So the sphere must fit within the cube, but the corners are removed to allow the sphere to be as large as possible. Wait, but the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners, so the sphere is the remaining part after removing the corners.

So the sphere must be tangent to the cube's faces, edges, or corners?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces, so the edge length of the cube is equal to the sphere's diameter, so 6 inches. But then the corners of the cube would be outside the sphere. So to form the sphere, you have to remove the parts of the cube that are outside the sphere, which includes the corners.

So the cube with edge length 6 inches contains the sphere. The volume of the cube is 216, and by removing the material of the cube outside the sphere, you get the sphere.\n\nWait, but in reality, removing the corners of the cube to form a sphere would involve more than just subtracting the corners. It would involve creating a surface that's spherical, which might require more than just cutting off the corners. So perhaps the sphere's diameter isn't the cube's edge length but something else.\n\nWait, let me try to model it mathematically.\n\nIf you have a cube with edge length 's', and you remove a corner, you can imagine removing a small cube of edge length 'x' from each corner. The remaining shape would have the original cube's face areas reduced by squares of side 'x', and the corners replaced with new faces of side 'x√2' because when you cut off a corner of a cube, the new face is a right-angled triangle, but since you're removing a cube, the cut is a square face, but in 3D, the new face is a square's diagonal, so maybe the face is a square with side 'x√2'.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is formed by the convex hull of the eight removed corners. Wait, but that's not a sphere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each removed corner contributes a spherical segment to form the sphere. Wait, perhaps each corner is a quarter of a sphere, but that would require the radius to be such that the eight quarter-spheres combine into a full sphere. But that doesn't align with the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each corner is replaced by a spherical cap, and the sum of these caps forms the sphere. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is entirely within the cube, and the cube's edge length is such that the sphere touches the centers of each face. In that case, the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's edge length, so s = 2r = 6 inches, so volume is 6^3 = 216.\n\nBut the problem says \"removing metal from the corners\", which suggests that the sphere is not just sitting inside the cube but is formed by"

Therefore, the sphere must be entirely within the cube, and the corners are the parts that are removed. So the sphere must be tangent to the original cube's edges or faces.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere touches the midpoints of the cube's edges. Let me think: the distance from the center of the cube to the midpoint of an edge is (s/2)*sqrt(2)/2 = s/(2√2). Wait, no, the distance from the center to the midpoint of an edge is (s/2)*sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 )? Wait, maybe better to compute coordinates.\n\nLet me set the cube with coordinates from (0,0,0) to (s,s,s). The center is at (s/2, s/2, s/2). The midpoint of an edge, say the edge from (0,0,0) to (s,0,0), is at (s/2, 0, 0). The distance from the center to this midpoint is sqrt( (s/2 - s/2)^2 + (0 - s/2)^2 + (0 - s/2)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + (s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 ) = sqrt( s²/4 + s²/4 ) = sqrt( s²/2 ) = s/√2.\n\nIf the sphere is centered at the cube's center and touches those midpoints, then the radius would be s/(√2). If the sphere has radius 3, then s/(√2) = 3 → s = 3√2 ≈ 4.2426. But then the cube's edge length would be shorter than 6, which might be the minimal possible.\n\nWait, but then the sphere would extend beyond the original cube's faces? Wait, no, if the sphere's radius is s/(√2), then the distance from the center to a face is s/2. Since s/(√2) must be greater than s/2 for the sphere to reach the edges, but actually, s/(√2) is equal to s/2 * sqrt(2), which is larger than s/2. So the sphere would actually extend beyond the cube's faces. That"

            "output": " can't be, because the sphere is supposed to be inside the cube.\n\nWait, that suggests that the sphere cannot touch the midpoints of the edges if it's entirely inside the cube. Therefore, perhaps the sphere must be tangent to the cube's faces at their centers. So the sphere's radius is equal to the distance from the cube's center to its face center. That is, the sphere's radius is s/2. So if the sphere has radius 3, then s/2 = 3 → s = 6, so the cube's edge length is 6, and volume is 216.\n\nBut then why remove the corners? Because the cube would have the sphere inside, and by removing the corners, you're left with the sphere. So the volume of the cube is 6³ = 216, and the volume of the sphere is (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π27 = 36π. So the volume of the cube minus the removed corners equals the sphere's volume.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners. So perhaps the sphere's volume is equal to the volume of the cube minus the volume of the removed corners. But actually, no, because when you remove metal from the corners, you're not just removing the corners; you're also creating the spherical surface. So maybe the sphere's volume is exactly the volume of the cube minus the volume of the eight corners.\n\nBut let's compute that. Volume of cube is s³, volume of sphere is (4/3)πr³ = 36π as above. The volume removed is s³ - 36π, which would be equal to the volume of the eight corners. But perhaps that's a different approach, but I'm not sure if it's necessary for this problem.\n\nWait, the question only asks for the cube's volume. So if the cube's edge length is 6 inches, then its volume is 216 cubic inches, regardless of how much is removed to form the sphere. Therefore, the answer would be 216.\n\nBut earlier I thought that perhaps the space diagonal relates to the sphere's diameter. Let me test that again. If s√3 = sphere's diameter, which is 6, then s = 6/√3 = 2√3 ≈ 3.464 inches. Then the volume would be (2√3)³ = "

Is the sphere's diameter equal to the cube's edge length (so 6 inches, volume 216) or equal to the space diagonal (so edge length 2√3, volume 24√3)?\n\nThe problem states that the cube has the shortest possible side lengths. So whichever configuration requires the smallest cube would be the answer. If the sphere is inscribed in the cube (touching the centers of the faces), then the cube's edge length is 6. But if the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that it touches the corners, then the sphere's diameter would be the space diagonal, so edge length 2√3, which is smaller. But can a sphere be inscribed in a cube such that it touches the corners?\n\nWait, the sphere inscribed in a cube touches the centers of the faces, not the corners. The corners are further away. The distance from the center of the cube to a corner is (s/2)*√3, which is the radius of the sphere that would touch the corners. So if the sphere is to touch the corners, its radius would have to be s√3 / 2. But in this problem, the sphere has a radius of 3 inches. So if the sphere is touching the corners, then s√3 / 2 = 3 → s = 6/√3 = 2√3 ≈ 3.464. But then the sphere would extend beyond the faces of the cube, since the distance from center to face is s/2 = √3 ≈ 1.732, which is less than the radius 3. That can't be, because the sphere would then protrude outside the cube. So that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the sphere must be entirely within the cube, so the maximum distance from the center to any face must be less than or equal to the radius. Wait, no, actually, the sphere's radius must be less than or equal to the distance from the center to the face. Wait, the sphere is inside the cube, so the radius must be less than or equal to s/2.

But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is the result of a cube with edge length 's', and from each corner, a cube of edge length 'x' is removed. The remaining shape is a sphere. But this seems unlikely because removing a cube from each corner would leave a shape with flat square faces, not a smooth sphere.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is formed by the intersection of the cube with a octahedral shape. Alternatively, maybe each corner is replaced by a spherical segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is such that the cube's corners are rounded off to form the sphere. So the cube's edge length is the same as the sphere's diameter minus something. Maybe the cube's edge length is equal to the sphere's diameter.
