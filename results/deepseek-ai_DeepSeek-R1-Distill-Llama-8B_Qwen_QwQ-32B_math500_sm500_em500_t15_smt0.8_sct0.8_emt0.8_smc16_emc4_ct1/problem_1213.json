Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem is about a line that's drawn on a graph. There's some Asymptote code provided, but I think that's mainly for drawing the graph. The important thing is that the line is parameterized, and its direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, the direction vector tells me that for every 1 unit I move in the x-direction, I move \\( b \\) units in the y-direction. My task is to find \\( b \\).\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, it sets up a coordinate system with x-axis and y-axis. It defines two points, A and B. Point A is (-5,4), and point B is (-1,3). Then it finds points L and R, which are the intersections of the line AB with the vertical lines at (8,0) and (-8,0). Then it draws the line from L to R in red.\n\nWait, maybe I should visualize this. The line AB goes from (-5,4) to (-1,3), and it's extended to meet the vertical lines at x = 8 and x = -8, which are beyond the main graph. So, the line is being extended both to the right and to the left beyond the points shown.\n\nHmm, so the direction vector of this line is given, and one of its components is -7. Since the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), the slope of the line should be \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\), right? Because slope is rise over run, which in this case would be \\( \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{b}{-7} \\) or \\( -\\frac{b}{7} \\).\n\nBut maybe I should calculate the slope of the line AB from points A and B. Let me do that. Point A is (-5,4) and point B is (-1,3). The slope \\( m \\) is calculated as:\n\n"

So the slope of the line is -1/4. \n\nBut the direction vector's slope should also be equal to the slope of the line. The direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) has a run of -7 and a rise of \\( b \\), so the slope would be \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\), and that's supposed to equal the line's slope of -1/4. \n\nSo setting those equal: \n\n\\( \\frac{b}{-7} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nSolving for \\( b \\):\n\nMultiply both sides by -7:\n\n\\( b = (-\\frac{1}{4}) \\times (-7) \\)\n\nThat gives \\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nWait, let me check that again. So if the slope is \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\), which equals the line's slope of \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\), then:\n\n\\( \\frac{b}{-7} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\( 4b = 7 \\)\n\nWait, hold on, let me go step by step.\n\nMultiply both sides by -7:\n\n\\( b = (-1/4) * (-7) \\)\n\nYes, that's 7/4, right? So positive 7/4. \n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying:\n\nStarting with \\( \\frac{b}{-7} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nCross multiply: 4 * b = (-1) * (-7)\n\nWhich is 4b = 7, so b=7/4. Yep, that seems right. So that would mean \\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\). \n\nBut let me just verify because I might have messed up somewhere. The key point is that the direction vector's slope must match the line's slope.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of direction vectors between points A and B. Let"

So the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). But the problem says the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So how do these relate?\n\nWait, perhaps the direction vector given in the problem is just a scalar multiple of the actual direction vector of the line AB. So, the direction vector from A to B is (4, -1), which can be scaled by a factor to get (-7, b). \n\nSo, if I think of the direction vector (4, -1) being scaled to (-7, b), I can set up a proportion. So each component is scaled by some factor k.\n\nSo, 4 * k = -7\n\nand -1 * k = b\n\nSo, solving for k first:\n\nk = -7 / 4.\n\nThen, substituting into the second equation:\n\nb = (-1) * (-7 / 4) = 7/4.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So that confirms it: b is 7/4.\n\nSo, both approaches give me the same answer, which is reassuring. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the line's equation.\n\nFrom points A (-5,4) and B (-1,3), I can write the equation of the line. Let me do that.\n\nThe slope m is -1/4, as I calculated earlier. So using point-slope form with point A:\n\n\\( y - 4 = -\\frac{1}{4}(x - (-5)) \\)\n\\( y - 4 = -\\frac{1}{4}(x + 5) \\)\n\\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{5}{4} + 4 \\)\n\\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{11}{4} \\)\n\nSo, the line equation is \\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{11}{4} \\).

Since the slope is -1/4, the direction vector can be written as (4, -1) because the slope is rise over run, so for a run of 4, the rise is -1. Alternatively, any scalar multiple of that vector is also a direction vector. \n\nSo, if the direction vector is given as (-7, b), then this must be a scalar multiple of (4, -1). Let me see:\n\nLet’s suppose that ( -7, b ) = k*(4, -1). \n\nSo, -7 = 4k, so k = -7/4. \n\nThen, b = -1 * k = -1*(-7/4) = 7/4. \n\nSame result again. \n\nAlternatively, if the direction vector is given as (-7, b), then the slope would be (b)/(-7). Since the slope of the line is -1/4, then:\n\nb / (-7) = -1/4 → b = (-7)*(-1/4) = 7/4. \n\nYep, so all methods lead to the same answer. \n\nTherefore, the value of \\( b \\) is \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the Asymptote code again. The line is drawn from L to R, which are the intersections with x=-8 and x=8. Maybe I should confirm that the line actually has the same slope?\n\nLet me compute the coordinates of L and R. \n\nThe line AB is extended to meet the left and right sides of the coordinate system (since the grid goes from x=-8 to x=8). The points L and R are the intersections with the vertical lines at x=-8 and x=8. \n\nLet me compute the equation of the line again, which is \\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{11}{4} \\). \n\nTo find point L, which is the intersection with x=-8:\n\nPlug x = -8 into the equation:\n\ny = -1/4*(-8) + 11/4 = 2 + 11/4 = 8/4 + 11/4 = 19/4. \n\nWait, but in the Asymptote code"

            "output": ", it's drawing from L to R, which is the red line. So point L is (-8,19/4) and R is (8, y). Let me compute y when x=8:\n\ny = -1/4*(8) + 11/4 = -2 + 11/4 = (-8/4 + 11/4) = 3/4. \n\nSo point R is (8, 3/4).\n\nNow, the direction vector of the line from L to R would be from (-8, 19/4) to (8, 3/4). Let me compute the components of this vector.\n\nChange in x: 8 - (-8) = 16.\n\nChange in y: 3/4 - 19/4 = (3 - 19)/4 = (-16)/4 = -4.\n\nSo the direction vector is (16, -4). But in the problem, the direction vector is given as (-7, b). Hmm, so wait, that doesn't seem to align. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The direction vector between L and R is (16, -4), but according to the problem, it's (-7, b). How do these relate?\n\nWell, the problem might have a different direction vector, perhaps due to the line being parameterized differently. Alternatively, perhaps the direction vector is from A to B, which is (4, -1), as we saw earlier, whereas from L to R, it's (16, -4), which is 4 times larger. So, perhaps in the problem, the direction vector is scaled by some factor.\n\nWait, so the direction vector from A to B is (4, -1). So, the problem's direction vector is (-7, b), which might be a scaled version. Let me check:\n\nIf (4, -1) is scaled by some factor k to become (-7, b), then:\n\n4k = -7, so k = -7/4.\n\nThen, -1*k = b → b = 7/4, as before.\n\nBut wait, the vector from L to R is (16, -4). So 16 is 4 times 4, and -4 is 4 times -1. So, if the direction vector from L to R is (16, -4), that's equivalent to the direction vector (4"

So, the direction vector can be any scalar multiple. \n\nTherefore, the problem's direction vector is (-7, b), which is another scalar multiple of the original direction vector. So, the key is that the direction vector must be a scalar multiple of (4, -1). \n\nTherefore, the ratio between the components must be the same. \n\nSo, the direction vector given is (-7, b). The original direction vector is (4, -1). \n\nTherefore, the ratios of the components must be equal. \n\nSo, the ratio of x-component to y-component in the original direction vector is 4 / (-1) = -4. \n\nIn the given direction vector, the ratio is (-7)/b. \n\nTherefore, setting them equal:\n\n-7 / b = 4 / (-1)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n-7*(-1) = 4*b → 7 = 4b → b = 7/4. \n\nSame result again. \n\nAlternatively, the slope must be the same. The slope from direction vector (4, -1) is -1/4, which matches the slope of the line. The direction vector (-7, b) must also have a slope of b / (-7) = -1/4, so solving for b gives 7/4. \n\nTherefore, all methods confirm that \\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\). \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key was to realize that the direction vector must be a scalar multiple of the direction vector between points A and B, which gives the ratio needed to solve for \\( b \\). \n\nAlternatively, using the slope directly is straightforward here. Since the slope is determined by the points given, and the direction vector's slope must match, so that's another way. \n\nEither way, the answer is 7/4. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( b \\) in the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) for the given line, we start by determining the slope of the line using points \\( A(-5, 4) \\) and \\( B(-1, 3) \\).\n\n1. **Calculate the slope of the line:**\n   \\[\n  "
