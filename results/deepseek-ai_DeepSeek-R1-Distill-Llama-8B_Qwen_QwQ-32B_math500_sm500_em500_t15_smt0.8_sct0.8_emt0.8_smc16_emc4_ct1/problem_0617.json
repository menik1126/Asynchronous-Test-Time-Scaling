            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, I remember that divisors are numbers that can divide 196 without leaving a remainder. But how do I find all of them? Maybe I should start by factoring 196 into its prime components. That might help me figure out the number of divisors.\n\nAlright, let's start by dividing 196 by small prime numbers. I know that 2 goes into 196 because it's an even number. So, 196 divided by 2 is 98. That's one prime factor, which is 2. Now, 98 is also even, so I can divide by 2 again. 98 divided by 2 is 49. So, another 2. Now, 49 isn't even, so I can't divide by 2 anymore. I'll move on to the next prime number, which is 3.\n\nDoes 3 go into 49? Let me check: 3 times 16 is 48, which is close to 49, but 48 plus 3 is 51, which is more than 49. So, 3 doesn't divide 49 evenly. Next prime number is 5. Similarly, 5 times 9 is 45, which is less than 49, but 5 times 10 is 50, which is over. So, 5 doesn't work either. \n\nNow, the next prime number is 7. Let me see if 7 divides into 49. Yes, because 7 times 7 is 49. So, that's another prime factor, which is 7. And now, I've broken down 49 completely into 7 times 7. So, putting it all together, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared, 7 squared. So, 196 equals 2 squared times 7 squared.\n\nI remember there's a formula for finding the number of divisors based on the exponents in the prime factorization. It goes like this: if a number N can be expressed as N = p1^a * p2^b * p3^c * ... , then the total number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... and so on for each prime factor. \n\nApplying that to 196, which is 2^2 * 7^2."

            "output": " So, the exponents are both 2. Therefore, the number of divisors should be (2+1)(2+1). Let me calculate that. 2+1 is 3, and 3 multiplied by 3 is 9. So, does that mean 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors?\n\nWait, let me double-check that by listing all the divisors to make sure I haven't missed anything. Starting from 1, since 1 is always a divisor. Then, 2, because 196 is even. 4, since 196 divided by 4 is 49. Then 7, because 7 times 28 is 196. 14, because 14 times 14 is 196. 28, as I just mentioned. 49, because 49 times 4 is 196. Then 98, which is 49 times 2, and finally 196 itself.\n\nLet me count them: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors in total. Yikes, so that matches the calculation. That makes me feel better about the answer.\n\nSo, I think the correct number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9. I don't think I've missed any because when I listed them all out, I only got those 9. Plus the formula gave me the same number, so that must be correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number 196 can be factored into its prime components as \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\). Using the formula for the number of divisors, which is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\) for exponents \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we get \\((2+1)(2+1) = 9\\). Listing the divisors confirms this: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Therefore, 196 has 9 positive divisors.\n\n\\boxed{9}"
