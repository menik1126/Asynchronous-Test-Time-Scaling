Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98, so 2 is a prime factor.\n\nNext, I divide 98 by 2 again, resulting in 49. Now, 2 has been factored out completely.\n\nWith 49, I move to the next prime number, which is 7. Dividing 49 by 7 yields 7. So, 7 is another prime factor.\n\nFinally, I divide 7 by 7 to obtain 1, completing the factorization.\n\nThe prime factorization of 196 is therefore 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared, or \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, if a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the total number of divisors is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\).\n\nApplying this to 196, where \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=2\\), the number of divisors is \\((2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 196\n1. **Start with the smallest prime number, 2:**\n   - \\(196 \\div 2 = 98\\)\n   - \\(98 \\div 2 = 49\\)\n   \n   So, 2 is a prime factor, and we have \\(2^2\\) so far.\n\n2. **Move to the next prime number, 7:**\n   - \\(49 \\div 7 = 7\\)\n   - \\(7 \\div 7 = 1\\)\n   \n   So, 7 is another prime factor, and we have \\(7^2\\).\n\nThe prime factorization of **196** is:\n\\[\n196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the Formula for the Number of Divisors\nIf a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of"
