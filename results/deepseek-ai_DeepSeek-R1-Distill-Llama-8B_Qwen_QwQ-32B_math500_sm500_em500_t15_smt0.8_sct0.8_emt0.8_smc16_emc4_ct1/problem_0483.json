I have a cube with the shortest possible side length, and when I remove metal from its corners to create a steel sphere, the radius of the sphere is 3 inches.\n\nNext, I should figure out the relationship between the cube's side length and the sphere's radius. The corners being removed form a sphere, so the distance from each corner to the center of the cube is equal to the sphere's radius.\n\nThe cube has eight corners, and each corner is equidistant from the center. This distance is related to the cube's side length. If the cube has a side length of 's', then the distance from a corner to the center can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.\n\nSo, the sphere's radius 'r' is equal to half of the cube's space diagonal. This means r = (√3/2) * s.\n\nGiven that the radius r is 3 inches, I can set up the equation 3 = (√3/2) * s. Solving for 's' gives s = (2 * 3) / √3, which simplifies to s = 2√3 inches.\n\nFinally, to find the volume of the cube, I use the formula for the volume of a cube, which is s³. Plugging in s = 2√3 inches, the volume becomes (2√3)³ = 8 * 3√3 = 24√3 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- A steel sphere with a radius of 3 inches is formed by removing metal from the corners of a cube.\n- The cube has the shortest possible side lengths.\n\n**To Find:**\n- The volume of the cube in cubic inches.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between the Cube and the Sphere**\n\nWhen metal is removed from the corners of the cube to form a sphere, each corner that is removed is a small octant of the sphere. The radius of the sphere is equal to the distance from the center of the cube to any of its corners.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Sphere's Radius to the Cube's Space Diagonal**\n\nThe distance from the center of the cube to any corner is half of the cube's space diagonal. The space diagonal \\( d \\) of a cube with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n\\[ d = s"
