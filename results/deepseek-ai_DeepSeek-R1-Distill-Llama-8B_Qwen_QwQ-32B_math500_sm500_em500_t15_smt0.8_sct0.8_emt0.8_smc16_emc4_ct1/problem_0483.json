            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a steel sphere made by removing metal from the corners of a cube. The sphere has a 3-inch radius, and I need to find the volume of the original cube. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, the cube has all sides equal, right? So, if I remove metal from the corners, those corners are going to be replaced by something, probably a sphere. Wait, actually, the sphere is what's left after removing the corners. So, the sphere is inscribed within the cube, touching the centers of each face of the cube.\n\nWait, but the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of the cube. So, maybe the sphere is formed by cutting off each corner, each of which is a small octant of a sphere. That makes sense because a cube has eight corners, and each corner can be replaced by a small sphere segment.\n\nSo, each corner is a right-angled trirectangular tetrahedron, right? Because when you cut off a corner, you're removing a portion where three edges meet at right angles. The sphere must fit perfectly into that space, meaning that the radius of the sphere is related to the amount we're cutting off from each corner.\n\nWait, but the sphere's radius is given as 3 inches. So, the radius of the sphere is related to the cube's edge length. Let me think.\n\nIf the sphere is perfectly fitting into the cube after cutting off the corners, then the sphere's diameter must relate to the cube's edge length. But actually, the sphere is formed by the eight small spheres removed from the cube's corners. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is what's left after removing the corners. So, the cube is the original shape, and the sphere is carved out by cutting off each corner, which would adjust the cube's edges to form a sphere. But that seems a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no, maybe the sphere is formed by the removal of the corners, meaning that the sphere is inside the cube, touching the centers of the cube's faces. Because if you remove a corner, you're taking away a trirectangular tetrahedron from each corner, and the sphere would fit snugly into each corner cut-out.\n\nWait, but if the sphere is inside the cube, then the diameter of the sphere would be equal"

But then the volume would be 6^3 = 216. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem mentions removing metal from the corners, so maybe there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so the sphere touches the centers of each face of the cube. In that case, the sphere's diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube. So, if the radius is 3, the diameter is 6, so the cube's edge length is 6, volume 216. But the problem says the cube has the shortest possible side lengths. Hmm, maybe that's the case?\n\nWait, but maybe the sphere is not inscribed in the cube but is formed by the corners being removed. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the cube has side length 's'. The corners are being removed such that the remaining material forms a sphere. Each corner is a cube corner, so when you remove a corner, you might be cutting off a small octant of a sphere. The sphere's radius would then be such that the distance from the corner to the center of the sphere's portion is equal to the radius. Wait, perhaps the sphere is centered at the cube's center, and the corners are cut such that the sphere touches the original cube's edges or faces?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is the largest possible sphere that can fit inside the cube after removing the corners. To maximize the sphere's size, the corners have to be cut in such a way that the sphere touches the edges or faces of the cube. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nLet me consider the cube with side length 'a'. The sphere is inside this cube, and the sphere's radius is 3 inches. The problem states that the cube has the shortest possible side lengths. So, we need to find the minimal 'a' such that the sphere can be formed by removing metal from the corners of the cube.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so the sphere touches the centers of each face.

So, when you cut off the corners of a cube, the sphere that's formed must fit perfectly within the cube. So, each corner is a trirectangular tetrahedron, and the sphere's radius is related to how much we're cutting off from each corner.\n\nLet me model this mathematically. Suppose the cube has edge length 'a'. When we cut off a corner, we're removing a small tetrahedron from each corner. The sphere that remains would have its center at the center of the cube, which is at (a/2, a/2, a/2). The radius of the sphere is given as 3 inches.\n\nNow, the key is to find the relationship between the cube's edge length and the sphere's radius. Since the sphere is formed by the removal of the corners, the radius of the sphere would be related to the distance from the cube's center to the newly cut surfaces.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere's radius is equal to the distance from the cube's center to the points where the new faces (from the corners being cut off) intersect the original cube edges. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, the sphere will touch the points where the cut-off corners meet the original cube's faces. So, the point of contact between the sphere and the cube's face is along the midpoint of each face. Wait, but if the sphere is centered at (a/2, a/2, a/2), then the distance from the center to any face is a/2. If the sphere's radius is 3, then a/2 must be equal to 3, so a = 6. That would make the cube's volume 6^3 = 216. But that seems the same as before.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if you cut off the corners, you're removing material, but the sphere's presence would require that the cube's edges are adjusted accordingly. So perhaps the radius is related to how much you cut off from each corner.\n\nWait, perhaps each corner that's cut off is a small cube octant, and the sphere's radius is determined by the length from the corner to the point where it meets the sphere's surface.\n\nWait, let me consider that when"

The intersection of this plane with the edges of the cube will form a triangle. The sphere must be tangent to these planes. The radius of the sphere would then be the distance from the center of the cube to the plane.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's suppose that when we cut off each corner, we make a plane that cuts each of the three edges meeting at that corner at some distance 'x' from the corner. So, each edge of the cube is cut at a distance 'x' from each corner. Therefore, the length of each edge of the cube between two cuts is a - 2x, since each corner is cut by x.\n\nThe plane cutting the corner is equidistant from the center of the cube. The sphere's center is at the cube's center, so the distance from the center to the cutting plane must be equal to the sphere's radius, 3 inches.\n\nLet me set up coordinates. Let's place the cube in a coordinate system with one corner at (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (a,a,a). The center of the cube is at (a/2, a/2, a/2). Let's consider one corner at (0,0,0). The cutting plane here would intersect the edges along the x, y, and z axes at (x,0,0), (0,x,0), and (0,0,x). The equation of the plane cutting off this corner can be found using these three points.\n\nThe general equation of a plane is Ax + By + Cz + D = 0. Plugging in (x,0,0): Ax + D = 0 => A = -D/x. Similarly, B = -D/x, C = -D/x. So the equation becomes (-D/x)x + (-D/x)y + (-D/x)z + D = 0. Simplifying: -D + (-D/x)(y + z) + D = 0? Wait, maybe I need to do this more carefully.\n\nLet me use the three points (x,0,0), (0,x,0), (0,0,x). The plane equation can be found by finding a plane that passes through these three points.

Wait, let me do it again.\n\nWait, for (x,0,0): p*x + q*0 + r*0 = s => p = s/x.\n\nSimilarly, (0,x,0): q = s/x, and (0,0,x): r = s/x.\n\nSo the equation is (s/x)x + (s/x)y + (s/x)z = s.\n\nSimplify: s + (s/x)y + (s/x)z = s, which reduces to (s/x)(y + z) = 0. But that can't be right because y and z can vary, so the only way this equation holds is if s=0, which would make p, q, r zero, which isn't useful. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is better represented in a symmetric form. Since the plane is equidistant from the origin in terms of x, y, z, perhaps the equation is x + y + z = k for some constant k.\n\nTesting this with point (x,0,0): x = k => k = x.\n\nSimilarly, (0,x,0): y = x, so k = x. And same for z. So yes, the plane is x + y + z = x. Wait, that can't be right because substituting (x,0,0) into x + y + z = x gives x = x, which is 0 = 0, but that's all points on that plane.

Hmm, that's not possible unless d=0, which would make the equation 0=0, which is not a plane. So clearly, my approach is wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use a different method. Let me think of the normal vector to the plane. Since the plane cuts the edges at (x,0,0), (0,x,0), (0,0,x), the vectors from the origin to these points are along the axes. The normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of two vectors lying on the plane.\n\nTake vectors from (x,0,0) to (0,x,0): (-x, x, 0)\n\nand from (x,0,0) to (0,0,x): (-x, 0, x)\n\nCross product of these two vectors:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-x \u00a0x \u00a0\u00a00|\n|-x \u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0x|\n\n= i*(x*x - 0*0) - j*(-x*x - 0*(-x)) + k*(-x*0 - x*(-x))\n\n= i*(x\u00b2) - j*(-x\u00b2) + k*(x\u00b2)\n\nSo the normal vector is (x\u00b2, x\u00b2, x\u00b2).

Instead, the sphere is formed by the removal of the corners, so its radius relates to the cube's edge in a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can confirm with a=2\u221a3 and the sphere's radius being 3.

That's not possible because x must be positive. So, clearly, I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the plane equation. Let me go back.\n\nEarlier, I considered the plane equation as X + Y + Z = x, but when I calculated the distance from the center to the plane, I ended up with x = 3a/2 - 3\u221a3, leading to a=2\u221a3, which gave x=0, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the mistake is that the normal vector for the plane is (1,1,1), and the plane equation is X + Y + Z = d, but the distance from the center (a/2, a/2, a/2) to this plane is |(a/2)+(a/2)+(a/2) - d| / sqrt(1+1+1).\n\nWhich is |(3a/2 - d)| / sqrt(3)"

If that's the diameter of the sphere, then x\u221a3=2r=6 \u21d2x=2\u221a3. So the distance along each edge cut from the corner is 2\u221a3.\n\nThen the original cube's edge length must be such that when you cut 2\u221a3 from each corner along each edge, you can form the sphere. Wait, but each edge is shared between three corners, so perhaps the edge length a needs to be at least x*2?\n\nWait, each edge of the cube has two corners, so the total cut off from each edge is twice x. So the original edge length a must be at least 2x. So if x=2\u221a3, then a must be at least 4\u221a3\u22486.928.\n\nWait, but then the sphere's diameter is 6 inches, so the cube's edge length being 4\u221a3 is about 6.928. So the sphere would fit inside.\n\nBut this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe minimal cube that can contain a sphere of radius 3 inches is a cube with side length equal to the sphere's diameter, so 6 inches. The volume is 6\u00b3=216. The act of removing the corners is just a way to sculpt the sphere from the cube. Since they ask for the volume of the cube with the shortest possible side lengths, 216 is the answer.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 216.\n\nBut in my first calculation, I ended with a=2\u221a3 invalid because x=0, which suggests that the correct approach is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere touches the edges of the cube. The distance from the center to the edges is a/\u221a2 as before. Set equal to radius:\n\na/\u221a2 =3 \u21d2 a=3\u221a2\u22484.24, which is shorter than 6 inches. However, in this case, the sphere would protrude beyond the face centers.\n\nIf the sphere has radius 3 and is centered in the cube, then the distance to a"

Therefore, the minimal cube is 6 inches edge, volume 216.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe volume of the cube is \\boxed{216} cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere is made by removing metal from the corners, we start by noting that the sphere has a radius of 3 inches. \n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The sphere is formed by removing metal from the corners of a cube. The goal is to determine the volume of the original cube, which must have the shortest possible side lengths.\n\n2. **Sphere and Cube Relationship**: The sphere is inscribed within the cube, touching the centers of each face of the cube. The radius of the sphere is 3 inches, so the diameter of the sphere is 6 inches.\n\n3. **Edge Length of the Cube**: The sphere's diameter is equal to the edge length of the cube. This is because the sphere touches the centers of each face of the cube, and the distance from the center of the cube to any face is half the edge length. Therefore, the edge length of the cube is 6 inches.\n\n4. **Volume Calculation**: The volume of a cube is given by the formula \\(a^3\\), where \\(a\\) is the edge length. Substituting \\(a = 6\\) inches, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volume of the cube is \\(\\boxed{216}\\) cubic inches."
