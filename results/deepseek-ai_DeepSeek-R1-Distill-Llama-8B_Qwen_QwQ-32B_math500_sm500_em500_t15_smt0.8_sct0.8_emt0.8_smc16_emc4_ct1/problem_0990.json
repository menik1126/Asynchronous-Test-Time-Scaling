            "output": "First, I need to understand the problem William Sydney Porter faced. He was supposed to calculate the complex fraction \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\) but mistakenly used the numerator \\(3 + 4i\\) instead. The result he got was \\(\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\). However, this isn't the correct answer for the original problem he intended to solve.\n\nTo find the correct answer, I'll perform the calculation step by step using the original numerator \\(-3 + 4i\\) and the same denominator \\(1 + 2i\\).\n\nFirst, I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it. The complex conjugate of \\(1 + 2i\\) is \\(1 - 2i\\).\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll expand the numerator using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\\[\n(-3)(1) + (-3)(-2i) + (4i)(1) + (4i)(-2i) = -3 + 6i + 4i - 8i^2\n\\]\nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n-3 + 10i + 8 = 5 + 10i\n\\]\n\nNow, for the denominator, I'll multiply the complex conjugates:\n\\[\n(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (-4) = 5\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together, the fraction simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + 10i}{5} = 1 + 2i\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer William Sydney Porter should have obtained is \\(1 + 2i\\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the correct result of the calculation \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\), let's follow the proper steps to perform the division of complex numbers.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Given Expression\n\\[\n\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2:"
