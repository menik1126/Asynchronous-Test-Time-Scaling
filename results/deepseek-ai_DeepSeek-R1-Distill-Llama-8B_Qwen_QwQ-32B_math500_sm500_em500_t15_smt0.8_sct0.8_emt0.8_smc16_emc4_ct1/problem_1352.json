            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from algebra that when you divide one polynomial by another, you can use long division or synthetic division. Since the divisor here is a binomial, \\( x + 1 \\), maybe synthetic division would be the quicker method. I think that\u2019s especially useful when the divisor is of the form \\( x - c \\), where c is a constant. In this case, the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), which can be written as \\( x - (-1) \\). So, that means c is -1.\n\nAlright, so let me set up synthetic division. I know the coefficients of the dividend polynomial are needed for this. The dividend is \\( x^6 - 3 \\). Wait, but that\u2019s a sixth-degree polynomial, which means it will have seven terms when fully expanded, right? Let me write out all the coefficients correctly. So starting from the highest power, which is \\( x^6 \\), the coefficients would be:\n\n1 (for \\( x^6 \\)), 0 (since there's no \\( x^5 \\) term), 0 (no \\( x^4 \\)), 0 (no \\( x^3 \\)), 0 (no \\( x^2 \\)), 0 (no \\( x^1 \\)), and -3 (the constant term). So the coefficients are: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nNow, I need to perform synthetic division with c = -1. Let me remember the steps: bring down the leading coefficient, multiply by c, add to the next coefficient, repeat this until all coefficients are processed. Also, the last term will be the remainder. Since I'm dividing by a first-degree polynomial, the quotient will be a sixth-degree polynomial, and the remainder will be a constant.\n\nLet me set this up step by step.\n\nFirst, I write down the coefficients: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nI start by writing c = -1 on the left side. So:\n\n-1 | 1  0  0  0  0  0  -3\n\nNow, the first"

Sometimes when I do these step by step, especially with negative numbers, I can get mixed up. Let me verify a couple of steps.\n\nSo after the first step, we have:\n\n1.\n\nThen, multiply 1 by -1: -1. Next coefficient is 0, so 0 + (-1) = -1. That seems correct.\n\nThen, take -1, multiply by -1 gives 1. Add to next 0: 1. Correct.\n\nNext, take 1, multiply by -1: -1. Add to next 0: -1. Correct.\n\nThen, take -1, multiply by -1: 1.

But the original polynomial is \\( x^6 -3 \\). Hmm, so that means the remainder is actually -2, so when we add the remainder, it should be \\( x^6 -1 -2 = x^6 -3 \\). That checks out. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the quotient is indeed \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\), and the remainder is -2. Since the question asks for the quotient, that's the polynomial part, so the answer should be that fifth-degree polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can also do this using polynomial long division to confirm.
