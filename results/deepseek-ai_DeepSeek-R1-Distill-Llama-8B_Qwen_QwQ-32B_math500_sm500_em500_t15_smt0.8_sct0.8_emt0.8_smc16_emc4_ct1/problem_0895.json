            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, I start by examining the denominator, 160.\n\nI recall that a fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. \n\nSo, I factorize 160 into its prime components: \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5\\). Since 2 and 5 are the only prime factors, the fraction can be expressed with a decimal that terminates.\n\nNext, I convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 57 by 160. \n\nPerforming the division, \\(57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\\). \n\nFinally, I verify that 0.35625 is a terminating decimal by checking that there are only a finite number of digits after the decimal point.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** Convert \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Condition for Terminating Decimals:**\n   - A fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will have a terminating decimal if the denominator \\(b\\) (after simplifying the fraction) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n   - Here, the denominator is **160**, which is \\(2^5 \\times 5\\). Since 2 and 5 are the only prime factors, \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) will indeed be a terminating decimal.\n\n2. **Perform the Division:**\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Verify the Decimal Representation:**\n   - The decimal \\(0.35625\\) terminates after the 5th decimal place.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
