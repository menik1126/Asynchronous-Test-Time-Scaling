            "output": "To convert the fraction 57/160 to a terminating decimal, I need to determine if the denominator has only 2 and 5 as prime factors because these are the only primes that result in terminating decimals.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 160. Breaking it down, 160 can be divided by 2 repeatedly: 160 \u00f7 2 = 80, 80 \u00f7 2 = 40, 40 \u00f7 2 = 20, and 20 \u00f7 2 = 10. After dividing by 2 four times, I get 10, which can be further divided by 2 to give 5. So, 160 = 2^5 \u00d7 5.\n\nSince the denominator factors into only 2s and 5s, the fraction can be expressed as a decimal that terminates.\n\nNext, I'll convert the fraction by dividing 57 by 160 directly. Performing the division, 57 \u00f7 160 equals 0.35625. This shows that the decimal terminates after five decimal places.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is 160. Let's factor it into its prime components.\n   \\[\n   160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^4 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^5 \\times 5\n   \\]\n   - The prime factors of the denominator are only 2s and 5s.\n\n2. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   - Since the denominator has only 2s and 5s, the decimal will terminate.\n   - Perform the division \\(57 \\div 160\\).\n   \\[\n   57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Terminating Decimal:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.35625}\n   \\]"
