They form three regions labeled X, Y, and Z.\n\nNext, I'll determine the areas of each region by calculating the area of each circle and subtracting the smaller circles from the larger ones.\n\nFor region X, it is the area between the circles with radii 4 and 6. So, I'll subtract the area of the inner circle (radius 4) from the area of the middle circle (radius 6).\n\nFor region Y, it is the area between the circles with radii 6 and 7. Similarly, I'll subtract the area of the middle circle (radius 6) from the area of the outer circle (radius 7).\n\nRegion Z is the area of the largest circle, which is the circle with a radius of 7. I'll calculate its area directly.\n\nAfter calculating the areas, I'll identify which region has the greatest area and which has the smallest. Then, I'll find the difference between these two areas and express the answer in exact form.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the difference between the areas of the largest and smallest regions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the area of each circle:**\n   - **Circle with radius 4:**\n     \\[\n     A_4 = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 6:**\n     \\[\n     A_6 = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 7:**\n     \\[\n     A_7 = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the areas of each region:**\n   - **Region X (between radii 4 and 6):**\n     \\[\n     A_X = A_6 - A_4 = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Region Y (between radii 6 and 7):**\n     \\[\n     A_Y = A_7 - A_6 = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Region Z (area of the largest circle, radius 7):**\n    "
