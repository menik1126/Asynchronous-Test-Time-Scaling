Then, I need to evaluate each of these polynomials at \\( x = 1 \\) and sum up their values. \n\nFirst, let me write down the polynomial again to have it clear: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Hmm, this looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Let me substitute \\( y = x^4 \\). Then, the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\). \n\nWait, that substitution might be helpful. Let me solve this quadratic equation for \\( y \\). Using the quadratic formula, \\( y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2} \\). So, \\( y = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\) or \\( y = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4 \\). \n\nTherefore, \\( x^4 = 1 \\) or \\( x^4 = -4 \\). Let me write down these equations:\n1. \\( x^4 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( x^4 = -4 \\)\n\nFor the first equation, \\( x^4 = 1 \\), I can factor this as \\( (x^2)^2 = 1 \\), so \\( x^2 = \\pm1 \\). Hence, \\( x = \\pm1 \\) or \\( x = \\pm i \\). But since we're dealing with real coefficients, the complex roots will come in pairs. So, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - i)(x + i) \\), but over integers, it factors into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nFor the second equation, \\( x^4 = -4 \\), let me rewrite this as \\( x^4 + 4 = 0 \\). Hmm, this is similar to the sum of squares, but can I factor this over"

            "output": " integers?\n\nWait, I remember that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored as a product of two quadratics. Let me recall how. I think it's related to the Sophie Germain identity, which states that \\( a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) \\). In this case, \\( b = 1 \\), so \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\). \n\nSo, combining both factorizations, the original equation \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) can be written as:\n\\[\n(x^4)^2 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\n\\]\nBut let me check if these factors can be factored further over integers.\n\nLooking at each quadratic:\n- \\( x^2 - 1 \\) factors into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) \\), which are linear and can't be factored further.\n- \\( x^2 + 1 \\) has discriminant \\( (-1)^2 - 4*1*1 = 1 - 4 = -3 \\), which is negative, so it's irreducible over integers.\n- \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\) has discriminant \\( (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\), which is also negative, so it's irreducible.\n- Similarly, \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) also has discriminant \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), so it's irreducible.\n\nHence, the complete factorization is:\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\n\\]\nWait, but the original polynomial is degree 8, and this factorization gives me"

Wait, no, the x^4 +4 factors into two quadratics, so that's two quadratics. So total factors: 2 linear, 1 quadratic (x^2 +1), and two quadratics from x^4 +4. So total of 2 +1 +2 = 5 factors.

The problem states that each non-constant polynomial must be monic and irreducible over integers. So, the linear factors are monic, which they are. The quadratics are also monic. So, this seems okay. \n\nBut let me check if the factorization is correct. Let me multiply them back to see if I get the original polynomial.\n\nFirst, multiply (x -1)(x +1) = x^2 -1.\n\nMultiply that by (x^2 +1): (x^2 -1)(x"
