I need to compute \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) \\).\n\nHmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the given polynomial is an eighth-degree polynomial: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). It looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\), right? So maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it.\n\nLet me try substituting \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\( y \\). Let me solve for \\( y \\):\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, \\( y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 3 \\), and \\( c = -4 \\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant: \\( b^2 - 4ac = 9 + 16 = 25 \\).\n\nSo, \\( y = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2} \\).\n\nThat gives two solutions:\n\n1. \\( y = \\frac{-3 + 5}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\)\n2. \\( y = \\frac{-3 - 5}{2} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4 \\)\n\nSo, \\( y = 1 \\) or \\( y = -4 \\). But remember, \\( y = x^4 \\). So, substituting back, we have:\n\n1. \\( x^4 = 1 \\)\n2. \\( x^4 = -4 \\)\n\nLet me solve each of these equations.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 = 1 \\). Taking the fourth root of both sides, \\( x = \\pm 1 \\) or \\( x = \\pm i \\). But since we are dealing with integer coefficients, complex roots come"

Hmm, this is a biquadratic equation. I think this can be factored further over integers.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the original polynomial as a product of quadratics or something else. Let me try.\n\nFirst, notice that \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) is similar to a quadratic in \\( x^4 \\). So, it factors as \\( (x^4 + a)(x^4 + b) \\). But since the original polynomial is monic and each factor is monic, then \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) should add up to something... but wait, the product \\( (x^4 + a)(x^4 + b) = x^8 + (a + b)x^4 + ab \\). Comparing this with our original polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\), so:\n\n\\( a + b = 3 \\)\n\n\\( ab = -4 \\)\n\nSo, let me solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The quadratic equation would be \\( t^2 - 3t -4 = 0 \\), where \\( t = a \\) or \\( t = b \\). Using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\( t = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm 5}{2} \\).\n\nThus, \\( t = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\) or \\( t = \\frac{-2}{2} = -1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = 4 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\), or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial factors as \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nBut wait, \\( x^4 - 1 \\) can be factored further, right? Since \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). And \\( x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) \\). So, putting it all together:\n\n\\( x^"

Coefficient of \\( x \\): a d + b c = 0. Substitute c = -a: a d - a b = 0 \u21d2 a(d - b) = 0\n5. Constant term: b d = 4\n\nNow, let's consider possible integer solutions.\n\nFrom equation 4: Either a = 0 or d = b.\n\nIf a = 0, then c = 0. Then equation 3 becomes 0 + b + d = 0 \u21d2 b + d = 0. But equation 5: b d = 4. So, solving b + d = 0 and b d = 4. Then d = -b, so b*(-b) = -b\u00b2 =4 \u21d2 b\u00b2 = -4, which is impossible. So"
