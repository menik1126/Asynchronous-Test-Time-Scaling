They satisfy three equations:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\).\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that sometimes, when dealing with symmetric equations involving variables, it's helpful to use symmetric sums or try to relate them to the roots of a polynomial. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me note the given equations:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)  -- this is the product of the variables.\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\) -- the sum of their cubes.\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\) -- this looks a bit complicated, but I think it can be broken down.\n\nI need to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\), which is a standard symmetric sum. Let me denote this sum as S, so \\( S = xy + yz + zx \\).\n\nI also remember that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are:\n\n- \\( e_1 = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( e_2 = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( e_3 = xyz \\)\n\nGiven that \\( e_3 = 4 \\), which is straightforward.\n\nNow, the second equation is \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). I recall that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\) can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric sums.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\]\n\nSo, substituting in the known values, we have:\n\n\\( 4 = e_1^3 - 3 e_1 e_2 + 3 e_3"
