I have this problem where I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\) given these three equations:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, that's a bit complex. Let me try to make sense of it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that there are some identities related to sums of cubes and symmetric expressions. Maybe I can use those here. Let me recall some important identities:\n\n1. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n2. \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) \\)\n\nThese might come in handy. Let me denote \\( S = x + y + z \\), \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\).\n\nFrom the second identity, we can express \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\) in terms of \\( S \\) and \\( P \\). Let me write that down:\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \\)\n\nNow, looking at the first equation, which is \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). Using the identity I mentioned earlier:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\( 4 - 3 \\times 4 = S(S^2 - 2P - P) \\)\n\nWait, let's compute that. The left side becomes \\( 4 - 12 = -8 \\). So,\n\n\\( -8 = S(S^2 - 3P) \\)\n\nThat's equation (a): \\( S^3 - 3SP + 8 = "

So, \\( S^3 - 3SP + 8 = 0 \\). Hmm, that seems right.)\n\nNow, moving on to the third equation: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\).\n\nLooking at this, it seems like a symmetric expression. Let me try to factor it or find a pattern. Maybe I can factor terms or group them in a way that relates to \\( S \\) or \\( P \\).\n\nWait, let's consider \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z \\). I can factor each pair:\n\n- \\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) = xy(S - z) \\) because \\( x + y + z = S \\), so \\( x + y = S - z \\).\n- Similarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) = xz(S - y) \\)\n- And \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) = yz(S - x) \\)\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) \\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\n- \\( xyS - xyz \\)\n- \\( xzS - xyz \\)\n- \\( yzS - xyz \\)\n\nNow, combining all together:\n\n\\( xyS + xzS + yzS - 3xyz \\)\n\nFactor out \\( S \\):\n\n\\( S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz \\)\n\nBut \\( xy + xz + yz = P \\), and \\( xyz = Q = 4 \\). So, substituting:\n\n\\( S \\times P - 3 \\times 4 = SP - 12 \\)\n\nBut the original expression is given as 12, so:\n\n\\( SP - 12 = 12 \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\("

Let me double-check.\n\nStarting from the third equation, I correctly expanded it into \\( SP - 12 = 12 \\), leading to \\( SP = 24 \\). Then, using the first equation, substituted into the identity correctly, and found \\( S = 4 \\). Substituting back, \\( P = 6 \\). Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me check if all the values fit into the original equations.\n\nGiven \\( S = 4 \\), \\( P = 6 \\), \\( Q = 4 \\).\n\nThen, \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). Let me compute it using the identity:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S^3 - 3SP + 3Q \\) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the identity is \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\). Wait, that's actually correct.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S^3 - 3SP + 3Q \\)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\( 4 = 4^3 - 3(4)(6) + 3(4) \\)\n\\( 4"
