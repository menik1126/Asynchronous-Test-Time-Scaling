            "output": "First, I identify the equation of the parabola given: x = y² - 4y - 1.\n\nI notice that the equation is not in the standard form of a parabola. To analyze the y-intercepts, I need to rewrite the equation in terms of y.\n\nI'll solve for y in terms of x. Starting with the given equation, I can rewrite it as y² - 4y = x + 1.\n\nNext, I'll complete the square for the y terms to convert the quadratic equation into a standard form.\n\nCombining the y terms, I get y² - 4y + 4 = x + 5, which simplifies to (y - 2)² = x + 5.\n\nSolving for y, I take the square root of both sides: y - 2 = ±√(x + 5). Therefore, y = 2 ± √(x + 5).\n\nThe y-intercepts occur where x is zero. Substituting x = 0 into the equation, I get y = 2 ± √5.\n\nSince √5 is a positive real number, there are two distinct y-intercepts: y = 2 + √5 and y = 2 - √5.\n\nTherefore, the graph of the parabola x = y² - 4y - 1 has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of y-intercepts of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the y-intercept condition**: A y-intercept occurs where \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation**:\n   \\[\n   0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation for \\( y \\)**:\n   \\[\n   y^2 - 4y - 1 = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}"
