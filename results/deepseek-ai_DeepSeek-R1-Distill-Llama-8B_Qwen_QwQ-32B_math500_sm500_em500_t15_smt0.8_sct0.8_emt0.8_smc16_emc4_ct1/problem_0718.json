So, I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\nThis results in a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). To find the number of real solutions, I'll calculate the discriminant (\\( D \\)) of the quadratic equation using the formula \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\):\n\n\\[\nD = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (\\( D > 0 \\)), there are two distinct real solutions for \\( y \\). This means the parabola will intersect the \\( y \\)-axis at two points.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the \\( y \\)-Intercept\nThe \\( y \\)-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the \\( y \\)-axis. At the \\( y \\)-intercept, the value of \\( x \\) is **0**. Therefore, set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Quadratic Equation\nThe equation is a quadratic in the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), where:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -4 \\)\n- \\( c = -1 \\)\n\nTo find the number of real solutions, calculate the discriminant (\\( D \\)) using the formula:\n\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n\\[\nD = (-4)^2 - 4 \\times "
