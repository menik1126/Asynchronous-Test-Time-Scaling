            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). Then, express this distance as \u221aa / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is square-free. Finally, I have to find a + b.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The distance from the origin to a point (x, y) is given by the distance formula: \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Since I want to minimize this distance, I can set up an equation for the distance squared, which is easier to work with because the square root can complicate things.\n\nSo, let me define D as the distance from the origin to a point (x, y) on the graph. Then,\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nGiven that y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3), I can substitute that into the distance equation:\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + [ (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3) ]\u00b2.\n\nHmm, let me compute that step by step. First, square the y-term:\n\n[ (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3) ]\u00b2 = (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2.\n\nSo now, D\u00b2 becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2.\n\nI need to find the minimum value of D\u00b2, which will correspond to the minimum distance D.\n\nLet me expand the (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 term:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 = x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9.\n\nSo substituting back into D\u00b2:\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9).\n\nLet me distribute the 1/2:\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)x\u2074 - (6/2)x\u00b2 + (9/2).\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)x\u2074 - 3x\u00b2 + 4.5.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2 is -2x\u00b2, so:\n\nD\u00b2 = (1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 4.5.\n\nHmm, so D\u00b2 is a function in terms"

To find its minimum, I can take the derivative with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.\n\nBut before taking derivatives, maybe it's better to write the equation in terms of a single variable. Let me let t = x\u00b2, so that t \u2265 0.\n\nThen, substitute into D\u00b2:\n\nD\u00b2 = (1/2)t\u00b2 - 2t + 4.5.\n\nSo, D\u00b2 as a function of t is (1/2)t\u00b2 - 2t + 4.5. Now, to find the minimum, take the derivative with respect to t and set it to zero.\n\nLet me compute d(D\u00b2)/dt:\n\nd(D\u00b2)/dt = (1/2)(2t) - 2 + 0 = t - 2.\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\nt - 2 = 0 \u21d2 t = 2.\n\nSo the minimum occurs at t = 2. Since t = x\u00b2, this means x\u00b2 = 2 \u21d2 x = \u221a2 or x = -\u221a2.\n\nNow, let's find the value of D\u00b2 at t = 2:\n\nD\u00b2 = (1/2)(2)\u00b2 - 2(2) + 4.5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/2)(4) = 2,\n\n-2(2) = -4,\n\nSo, 2 - 4 + 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nSo, D\u00b2 = 2.5 \u21d2 D = \u221a(2.5).\n\nHmm, 2.5 is 5/2, so D = \u221a(5/2) = (\u221a10)/2? Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, \u221a(5/2) is equal to (\u221a10)/2 because \u221a(5/2) = \u221a5 / \u221a2 = (\u221a5 * \u221a2) / (\u221a2 * \u221a2) = \u221a10 / 2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minimum distance is \u221a10 / 2. Therefore, a = 10 and b = 2. But wait, let me make sure that a is square-free. 10 factors into 2 and 5, neither of which is a square, so yes, it's square-free.\n\nTherefore, a = 10 and b = 2. So a + b = 12.\n\nBut"

Then, substituted into D\u00b2, which led me to (1/2)x^4 - 2x\u00b2 + 4.5. Correct.\n\nThen, substitution with t = x\u00b2, so D\u00b2 as (1/2)t\u00b2 - 2t + 4.5. Taking the derivative: d(D\u00b2)/dt = t - 2, which gave t = 2.\n\nPlugging back, yes, t = 2, so x = \u00b1\u221a2. Then, D\u00b2 at t=2: (1/2)(4) - 4 + 4.5 = 2 - 4 + 4.5 = 2.5. So D is \u221a2.5.\n\nWait, hold on, 2.5 is 5/2, so \u221a(5/2). Which is equal to \u221a10 / 2 because 5/2 is 10/4, and \u221a(10/4) is \u221a10 / 2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nSo, a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b is 12.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest distance from the origin to the graph is \u221a10 / 2, so a = 10 and b = 2, giving a + b = 12.\n\n\\boxed{12}"
