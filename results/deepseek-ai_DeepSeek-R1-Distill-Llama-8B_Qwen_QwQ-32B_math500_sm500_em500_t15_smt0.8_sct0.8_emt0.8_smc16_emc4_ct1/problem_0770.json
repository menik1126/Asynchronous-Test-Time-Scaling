The answer should be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I remember that the distance between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by the distance formula: \\( \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\). Since we're looking for the distance from the origin to a point on the graph, the origin is \\( (0, 0) \\) and the point on the graph is \\( (x, y) \\).\n\nSo, substituting the given function into the distance formula, the distance \\( D \\) from the origin to the point \\( (x, y) \\) on the graph is:\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) - 0 \\right)^2} \\)\n\nSimplifying that, it becomes:\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{x^2 - 3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2} \\)\n\nLet me compute the square of the distance to make it easier. So, \\( D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{x^2 - 3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( \\left( \\frac{x^2 - 3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\), since squaring a square root cancels them out, it becomes \\( \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\).\n\nSo, \\( D^2 = x^2 + \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\).\n\nTo minimize \\( D \\), it's equivalent to minimizing \\( D^2 \\)"

To express this as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), let's rationalize the denominator:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{5/2} = \\sqrt{5}/\\sqrt{2} \\), but we can rationalize it by multiplying numerator and denominator by \\( \\sqrt{2} \\):\n\n\\( \\sqrt{5}/\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{5} * \\sqrt{2}) / ( \\sqrt{2} * \\sqrt{2} ) = \\sqrt{10}/2 \\).\n\nSo, the minimal distance is \\( \\sqrt{10}/2 \\).\n\nThus, \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).

Correct.\n\nSetting derivative to zero: 2x(x^2 -2)=0, so x=0 or x=±√2. Correct.\n\nSecond derivative: 6x² -4. Correct. At x=0, second derivative negative (max), at x=√2, positive (min). Correct.\n\nEvaluating f(0): 9/2=4.5.\n\nAt x=√2: x²=2, x⁴=4. So f(√2) = (4 -8 +9)/2=5/2=2.5. So D²=2.5=5/2, so D=√(5/2)=√10 / 2. Correct.\n\nThus, expressed as √10 / 2, so √10 is already square-free, cannot simplify further. So a=10, b=2, sum is 12.\n\nAlternatively, if the minimal distance is √10 / 2, which is approximately 1.581.

The distance from origin is sqrt( (√2)^2 + (-1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt(2 + (1/2)) = sqrt(2.5) = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I plug in x=1, then y=(1 -3)/√2 = (-2)/√2 ≈ -1.414. Distance squared is 1 + ( ( -2/√2 )^2 ) = 1 + (4/2)=1+2=3, so sqrt(3)≈1.732, which is bigger than sqrt(10)/2≈1.581. So that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, at x=2, y=(4-3)/√2=1/√2≈0.707. Distance squared is 4 + (1/2)=4.5, which is 9/2, so sqrt(4.5)=~2.121, which is bigger.

The tangent to the curve at (x, y) has a slope equal to the derivative of the function at that point.\n\nThe derivative of y with respect to x is dy/dx = (2x)/√2 = x√2.\n\nThe direction of the tangent line is (1, dy/dx).

Therefore, the gradient of the distance squared (which is in the direction of the normal) should have the same direction as the normal vector of the curve, which is ( -dy/dx, 1 ) or ( dy/dx, -1 ). Wait, actually, the normal vector is perpendicular to the tangent, so it's direction is ( -dy/dx, 1 ) or ( dy/dx, -1 ). Let me clarify:\n\nIf the tangent has a slope of m = dy/dx, then the normal vector has a slope of -1/m. Therefore, the normal vector can be represented as (1, -1/m), or scaled appropriately.\n\nSo, the gradient of the distance squared (2x, 2y) must be a scalar multiple of the normal vector (1, -1/m). So, 2x = k * 1, and 2y = k * (-1/m). But m = dy/dx = x√2.\n\nTherefore, 2x = k, and 2y = -k/m = -2x / (x√2) = -2/(√2) = -√2.\n\nTherefore, 2y = -√2, so y = -√2/2.\n\nBut from the original curve, y = (x² -3)/√2.\n\nSo, set (x² -3)/√2 = -√2/2.\n\nMultiply both sides by √2:\n\nx² -3 = - (√2 * √2 ) / 2 = -2 / 2 = -1.\n\nThus,\n\nx² -3 = -1 => x²=2 => x=√2 or x=-√2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance occurs at x=√2 or x=-√2, as before. Then, y = (-1)/√2, as we saw earlier.\n\nThus, the minimal distance is sqrt(2 + (1/2)) = sqrt(5/2)=sqrt(10)/2. So, same result.\n\nHence, this method also gives the same answer, which reinforces that it's correct.\n\nTherefore, a = 10, b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( a + b \\)"
