            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Then, express this distance as √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is square-free. Finally, I have to find a + b.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The distance from the origin to a point (x, y) is given by the distance formula: √(x² + y²). Since I want to minimize this distance, I can set up an equation for the distance squared, which is easier to work with because the square root can complicate things.\n\nSo, let me define D as the distance from the origin to a point (x, y) on the graph. Then,\n\nD² = x² + y².\n\nGiven that y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), I can substitute that into the distance equation:\n\nD² = x² + [ (1/√2)(x² - 3) ]².\n\nHmm, let me compute that step by step. First, square the y-term:\n\n[ (1/√2)(x² - 3) ]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nSo now, D² becomes:\n\nx² + (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nI need to find the minimum value of D², which will correspond to the minimum distance D.\n\nLet me expand the (x² - 3)² term:\n\n(x² - 3)² = x⁴ - 6x² + 9.\n\nSo substituting back into D²:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9).\n\nLet me distribute the 1/2:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - (6/2)x² + (9/2).\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + 4.5.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx² - 3x² is -2x², so:\n\nD² = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 4.5.\n\nHmm, so D² is a function in terms"

To find its minimum, I can take the derivative with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.\n\nBut before taking derivatives, maybe it's better to write the equation in terms of a single variable. Let me let t = x², so that t ≥ 0.\n\nThen, substitute into D²:\n\nD² = (1/2)t² - 2t + 4.5.\n\nSo, D² as a function of t is (1/2)t² - 2t + 4.5. Now, to find the minimum, take the derivative with respect to t and set it to zero.\n\nLet me compute d(D²)/dt:\n\nd(D²)/dt = (1/2)(2t) - 2 + 0 = t - 2.\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\nt - 2 = 0 ⇒ t = 2.\n\nSo the minimum occurs at t = 2. Since t = x², this means x² = 2 ⇒ x = √2 or x = -√2.\n\nNow, let's find the value of D² at t = 2:\n\nD² = (1/2)(2)² - 2(2) + 4.5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/2)(4) = 2,\n\n-2(2) = -4,\n\nSo, 2 - 4 + 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nSo, D² = 2.5 ⇒ D = √(2.5).\n\nHmm, 2.5 is 5/2, so D = √(5/2) = (√10)/2? Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, √(5/2) is equal to (√10)/2 because √(5/2) = √5 / √2 = (√5 * √2) / (√2 * √2) = √10 / 2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minimum distance is √10 / 2. Therefore, a = 10 and b = 2. But wait, let me make sure that a is square-free. 10 factors into 2 and 5, neither of which is a square, so yes, it's square-free.\n\nTherefore, a = 10 and b = 2. So a + b = 12.\n\nBut"

Then, substituted into D², which led me to (1/2)x^4 - 2x² + 4.5. Correct.\n\nThen, substitution with t = x², so D² as (1/2)t² - 2t + 4.5. Taking the derivative: d(D²)/dt = t - 2, which gave t = 2.\n\nPlugging back, yes, t = 2, so x = ±√2. Then, D² at t=2: (1/2)(4) - 4 + 4.5 = 2 - 4 + 4.5 = 2.5. So D is √2.5.\n\nWait, hold on, 2.5 is 5/2, so √(5/2). Which is equal to √10 / 2 because 5/2 is 10/4, and √(10/4) is √10 / 2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nSo, a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b is 12.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest distance from the origin to the graph is √10 / 2, so a = 10 and b = 2, giving a + b = 12.\n\n\\boxed{12}"
