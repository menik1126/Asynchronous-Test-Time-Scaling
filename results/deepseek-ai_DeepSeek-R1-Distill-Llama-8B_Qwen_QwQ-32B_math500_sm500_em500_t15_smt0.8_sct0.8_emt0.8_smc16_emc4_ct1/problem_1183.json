The problem states that these solutions are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of this polygon.\n\nFirst, I need to find the four roots of the equation. Since it's a quartic, maybe it can be factored into quadratics or even linear terms. Let me look at the equation again: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). Hmm, the coefficients involve powers of i, so perhaps there's a substitution to simplify it.\n\nI notice that the coefficients 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i look somewhat symmetric but not in the usual way. Maybe I can factor this by grouping. Let me try to group terms like (\\( z^4 + 4z^3i \\)) and (\\( -6z^2 -4zi -i \\)):\n\n\\( (z^4 + 4z^3i) - (6z^2 + 4zi + i) = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, maybe factor out terms from each group:\n\nFrom the first group, factor out \\( z^3 \\): \\( z^3(z + 4i) \\).\n\nFrom the second group, let's see: \\( 6z^2 + 4zi + i \\). Maybe factor out a common term? It's a quadratic in z, but with coefficients involving i. Let me check the discriminant to see if it's factorable.\n\nThe quadratic is \\( 6z^2 + 4zi + i \\). Treating it as \\( 6z^2 + 4zi + i = 0 \\), discriminant \\( (4i)^2 - 4*6*i = (-16) - 24i \\). Hmm, that's a negative real number minus an imaginary number, which isn't a perfect square, so it doesn't factor nicely. So maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quartic can be expressed as a quadratic in \\( z^2 \\) or something similar. Let me check: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -"

The difference between 9π/16 - π/16 = π/2 radians. So, yes, each root is spaced by π/2 radians from the next, so they are equally spaced on the unit circle? Wait, but their magnitudes are the same: each has magnitude 2^{1/8}. So all four roots lie on a circle of radius 2^{1/8}, each separated by 90 degrees or π/2 radians.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the four solutions are points on a circle of radius 2^{1/8} spaced at 90-degree intervals. So their positions are at angles π/16, 9π/16,17π/16,25π/16.\n\nWait, but 25π/16 is equivalent to (16π/16 +9π/16) =25π/16, which is more than 2π. Since 2π is 32π/16, 25π/16 is still less than 32π/16, so it's a valid angle.\n\nWait, but wait a second: 25π/16 is more than 2π (which is 32π/16), but actually, in terms of the unit circle, angles are periodic modulo 2π.

Since they are equally spaced on a circle, so the polygon formed by connecting them is a square, right?\n\nWait, if four points are equally spaced on a circle, they form a square. So the polygon is a square, so the area would be (side length)^2. But to compute the area, we can use the formula for the area of a square inscribed in a circle of radius r: the diagonal of the square is 2r, so the side length is (2r)/√2 = √2 r, so area is (√2 r)^2 = 2r². Alternatively, since the radius is the distance from center to vertex, so the area is 2*(radius)^2.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nIf a square is inscribed in a circle of radius r, then the diagonal of the square is 2r. The side length s of the square is s = (2r)/√2 = √2 r. Then the area is s² = 2r². So yes, area is 2r².\n\nAlternatively, since the four points are vertices of a square, the area can also be calculated as (d1 * d2)/2 where d1 and d2 are the diagonals, but in a square, diagonals are equal, so ( (2r)^2 ) /2 = (4r²)/2 = 2r². Same result.\n\nTherefore, if the four roots form a square inscribed in a circle of radius 2^{1/8}, then the area would be 2*(2^{1/8})² = 2*(2^{1/4}) = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, the radius here is 2^{1/8}, so squared is 2^{1/4}, so 2*(2^{1/4}) = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}. So the area would be 2^{5/4}?\n\nBut let me check again.

But the problem states that the area is expressed as p^{a/b}, where p is prime, and a and b are coprime.\n\nSo 2^{5/4}= (2^{5})^{1/4}=32^{1/4}. So, 32 is 2^5, which is a prime power, so p=2, a=5, b=4. Thus, a + b + p= 5+4+2=11.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the four roots actually form a square. Let me confirm this.\n\nEach root is at radius 2^{1/8} and angles π/16, 9π/16,17π/16,25π/16.

Therefore, the area of the polygon formed by the z_k is also 2^{5/4}.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^{5/4}, which is equal to 2^{1.25}. The problem states that the area can be written as p^{a/b} where p is prime, so 2 is prime, a=5, b=4, which are coprime. Therefore, a + b + p =5 +4 +2=11.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there's a mistake here. The problem says the solutions are the vertices of a convex polygon. Since the roots are equally spaced on a circle, they form a regular quadrilateral, which is a square, so convex. So that's okay.\n\nBut let me think again: the roots w_k are on a circle of radius 2^{1/8}, centered at the origin, forming a square. Then shifting all points by -i (i.e., moving down by 1 unit on the imaginary axis) would translate the square to a new position, but the shape remains a square with the same side lengths and angles, so the area remains the same.

The side length of the square can be found using the distance between two adjacent points, or using the formula for the area of a regular polygon.\n\nThe formula for the area of a regular polygon with n sides of length s is (n * s^2)/(4 * tan(π/n)). For a square, n=4, so area= (4 * s²)/(4 * tan(π/4))= (4 * s²)/(4 * 1) )= s².\n\nBut in our case, the distance from the center to each vertex is r = 2^{1/8}, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the square. For a square, the relation between the side length s and the radius r is s = r * sqrt(2). So s = 2^{1/8} * sqrt(2) = 2^{1/8} * 2^{1/2} = 2^{5/8}. Then, the area is s² = (2^{5/8})² = 2^{5/4}.\n\nSo that's consistent with what I had before. Thus, the area is 2^{5/4} = 2^{1.25} = (2^5)^{1/4} =32^{1/4}.\n\nThus, a=5, b=4, p=2, so a + b + p=5+4+2=11.\n\nI think that's correct. So my final answer is 11.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\) can be rewritten as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).
