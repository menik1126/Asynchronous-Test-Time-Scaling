The final answer should be in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are relatively prime. Then, I have to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I remember that finding roots of quartic equations can be tricky, but maybe this equation can be factored or transformed into something more manageable. The coefficients involve \\( i \\), which suggests that maybe it's related to cyclotomic polynomials or something with roots on the unit circle, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking closely, the equation is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). Hmm, I notice that the coefficients are 1, \\( 4i \\), -6, \\( -4i \\), and -i. That looks kind of symmetric but with alternating signs and complex terms. Wait, maybe this can be expressed as a quadratic in terms of \\( z^2 \\) or something similar? Let me try to rearrange or factor it.\n\nAnother approach might be substitution. Let me let \\( w = z + i \\), maybe. Sometimes shifting the variable can simplify things. Let me try that. If \\( w = z + i \\), then \\( z = w - i \\). Let me substitute \\( z = w - i \\) into the equation.\n\nFirst, compute \\( z^4 \\):\n\\( z^4 = (w - i)^4 \\). That might get messy, but let's compute it step by step.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\\( (w - i)^4 = w^4 - 4w^3i + 6w^2i^2 - 4wi^3 + i^4 \\).\nSimplify each term:\n- \\( w^4 \\) stays as is.\n- \\( -4w^3i \\) is straightforward.\n- \\( 6w^2i^2 = 6w^2(-1) = -6w^2 \\).\n- \\( -4"

Shifting a point in the complex plane is equivalent to translating it. So, each root \\( w \\) is moved \\( -i \\) units, which in the coordinate system is a downward shift by 1 unit.\n\nTo find the effect on the polygon, let's consider the original polygon formed by the \\( w \\) roots.

So, how does this affect the polygon?\n\nShifting all vertices of a polygon doesn't change its area, right? Wait, no, that's only if the shift is the same for all, which it is here. Shifting all points by a fixed vector doesn't change the area of the polygon.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have a square, and after shifting down by 1, it's still a square, just moved down. So, the area remains the same. So, the area is still \\( 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe it's transformed differently? Let's think. If you have a square of side length \\( s \\), area is \\( s^2 \\). The diagonal is \\( s\\sqrt{2} \\), and relates to the radius of the circumscribed circle.\n\nWait, another approach. The area of a regular polygon can be found by \\( \\frac{1}{2} n R^2 \\sin(2\\pi/n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of sides, \\( R \\) is the radius.\n\nIn our case, \\( n=4 \\), \\( R=2^{1/8} \\). So area is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times4 \\times (2^{1/8})^2 \\times \\sin(\\pi/2) \\).\n\nSince \\( \\sin(\\pi/2)=1 \\), it simplifies to \\( 2 \\times 2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the area is \\( 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nWait, but the question says \"The area of this polygon can be expressed in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( a, b, p \\) are positive integers, \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are relatively prime"

So \\( a + b + p = 5 +4 +2 =11 \\).\n\nBut hold on, before I get too confident, let me check again. Because maybe the polygon isn't regular? Wait, the roots of \\( w^4 = 1 + i \\) are equally spaced on a circle, so they form a square. But when we shift them down by \\( i \\), does that preserve the square?\n\nWait, shifting a square in the plane doesn't change its shape or size, so it's still a square, just translated. Therefore, the area remains the same. So the area is indeed \\( 2^{5/4} \\), so the answer is 5+4+2=11.\n\nBut let me think again. Wait, the problem says \"the solutions of the equation are the vertices of a convex polygon\". The equation in terms of z is after substitution, so the roots in z are the shifted roots. So the polygon is the square shifted down by i. Since translation doesn't affect area, the area is the same as the original square formed by the w's. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution step? Let me check the substitution again.\n\nOriginal equation: \\( z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i =0 \\).\n\nAfter substituting \\( z = w -i \\), we ended up with \\( w^4 =1 +i \\). Let me verify that substitution again step by step.\n\nWait, when I substituted, I had to compute each term:\n\nFirst, \\( z^4 \\) was expanded as \\( (w -i)^4 \\), which I did step by step. Then, the other terms:\n\n\\( 4i z^3 =4i (w -i)^3 \\), which I expanded. Then, -6 z^2, etc. Then, when adding all terms, everything except constants canceled out, leading to \\( w^4 -1 -i =0 \\).

Therefore, equation is \\( w^4 -1 -i =0 \\), so \\( w^4 =1 +i \\). That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, substituting correctly simplifies the equation to \\( w^4 =1 +i \\). So, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the roots \\( w \\) are indeed the fourth roots of \\(1 +i \\), which is a complex number on the angle of \\(45^\\circ\\) with magnitude \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). The fourth roots will then be at angles \\( \\pi/16, 9\\pi/16, 17\\pi/16, 25\\pi/16 \\), each with magnitude \\( (2)^{1/8} \\).\n\nThus, these w's form a square in the complex plane, and when shifted down by i, which just translates them all downward, the figure remains a square, so the area is preserved.\n\nThus, area is \\(2^{5/4}\\), which is \\(2^{1 + 1/4} = 2 \\times 2^{1/4}\\).

Maybe I should try computing one of the roots to check.\n\nLet me try computing one of the roots. Since \\( w^4 =1 +i \\), let me compute the magnitude. |w|^4 = |1 +i| = sqrt(2).

Hmm, but when you plot all four points, they form a square shifted down by 1 unit in the imaginary direction. Since shifting doesn't affect the area, the area remains the same as the original square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is rotated? Since the original square is at angles pi/16, etc., so it's rotated 22.5 degrees from the axes, but shifting doesn't change rotation or scaling, so area remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the coordinates of the four points and compute the area directly?\n\nLet me try that.
