Let me write them down again to make sure I have everything straight:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + x^2z + yz^2 + y^2z = 12 \\)\n\nI need to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\). Hmm, algebraic equations, so maybe symmetric polynomials or Vieta's formula could be helpful here. Let me think about how these equations relate to each other.\n\nFirst, let me note down what each equation represents. The first equation is the product of the three variables, which is the same as the constant term in a cubic polynomial whose roots are \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\). The second equation is the sum of their cubes, and the third equation looks like a combination of their products and squares.\n\nI remember that for symmetric sums, we can denote:\n\n- \\( S_1 = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( S_2 = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( S_3 = xyz \\)\n\nGiven that \\( S_3 = 4 \\), so that's known. Maybe I can express the other equations in terms of \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\).\n\nStarting with the second equation: \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). There's a formula for the sum of cubes in terms of \\( S_1 \\), \\( S_2 \\), and \\( S_3 \\). Let me recall it.\n\nI think the formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\)\n\nSo plugging in the known values:\n\n\\( 4 = S_1^3 - 3S_1 S_2 + 3 \\times 4 \\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( 4 = S_1^3 - 3S_1 S_2 + 12 \\)\n\nSubtract"

Maybe I can find another equation involving these terms.\n\nLooking at the third equation: \\( xy^2 + x^2y + xz^2 + x^2z + yz^2 + y^2z = 12 \\). This seems a bit complicated. Let me try to factor or rewrite it.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\n- \\( xy^2 + x^2y = xy(y + x) \\)\n- Similarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2z = xz(z + x) \\)\n- And \\( yz^2 + y^2z = yz(z + y) \\)\n\nSo, the third equation can be written as:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, is there a way to relate this to other symmetric sums? Let's think about how to express this in terms of \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\).\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n- \\( xy(x + y) = x^2 y + x y^2 \\)\n- \\( xz(x + z) = x^2 z + x z^2 \\)\n- \\( yz(y + z) = y^2 z + y z^2 \\)\n\nSo, adding them up, we get the original equation.\n\nBut perhaps I can factor this another way or relate it to other symmetric expressions. Let me consider that \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) \\) expands to:\n\n\\( x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y + 3xyz \\)\n\nSo, \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = \\sum_{sym} x^2 y + 3xyz \\)\n\nNotice that our third equation is \\( \\sum_{sym} x^2 y = 12 \\). Therefore, the third equation is equal to \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz \\). So:\n\n"
