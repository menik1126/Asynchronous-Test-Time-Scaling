Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.\n\nFirst, the equations given are:\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\). Hmm, okay. So, I have these three equations involving x, y, z. It seems like it's a system of equations, and I need to find a relationship between them to get the desired expression.\n\nLet me think about how these equations are related. The first one is a product, the second is a sum of cubes, and the third is a combination of products of variables with squared terms. Hmm, perhaps there's a way to relate them using some algebraic identities.\n\nI remember that for three variables, there are some standard identities. For example, the identity for the sum of cubes:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nThat might be useful here since I have both \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\) and \\( xyz \\). Maybe I can use this identity to relate the two equations I have.\n\nGiven that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\) and \\( xyz = 4 \\), plugging these into the identity:\n\n\\( 4 - 3(4) = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\( 4 - 12 = -8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nSo, \\( -8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nHmm, that's"

That's a bit complicated. Let's see if I can factor or simplify that expression.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\n- \\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \\)\n- \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \\)\n- \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \\)\n\nSo, the entire expression can be written as:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, that's an interesting expression. Let me denote \\( S = x + y + z \\), \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\).\n\nI know from the first equation that \\( Q = 4 \\). Maybe I can express the third equation in terms of S, P, and Q.\n\nLet me try that. The third equation is:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\n- \\( xy(x + y) = x^2 y + x y^2 \\)\n- \\( xz(x + z) = x^2 z + x z^2 \\)\n- \\( yz(y + z) = y^2 z + y z^2 \\)\n\nWhich is exactly the original expression. So, perhaps I can relate this to S, P, and Q.\n\nLet me add up all these terms:\n\n\\( x^2 y + x y^2 + x^2 z + x z^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 \\)\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n\\( x^2(y + z) + y^2(x + z) + z^2(x + y) \\)\n\nAlternatively, factoring each term:\n\n= \\( x^2(y + z) + y^2(x + z) + z^2(x + y) \\)\n\nNow, since \\( x + y + z = S \\), then \\( y + z = S - x \\"

So, from equation (5): \\( S T = 16 \\), equation (6): \\( S (T - P) = -8 \\). Then, equation (6) can be written as \\( S T - S P = -8 \\). Since \\( S T = 16 \\), substitute to get \\( 16 - S P = -8 \\implies S P = 24 \\). Then, \\( T = (2/3) P \\). Also, \\( T = S^2 - 2P \\). Therefore, \\( S^2 - 2P = (2/3) P \\implies S^2 = (8/3) P \\). Then, since \\( S = 24 / P \\), substituting into \\( S^2 = (8/3) P \\) gives \\( (24 / P)^2 = (8/3) P \\implies 576 / P^2 = (8/3) P \\implies 576 = (8/3) P^3 \\implies multiply both sides by 3: 1728 = 8 P^3 \\implies P^3 = 216 \\implies P = 6 \\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recap:\n\nGiven that we have \\( xyz = 4 \\), \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\), and the third equation.
