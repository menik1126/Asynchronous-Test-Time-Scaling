Hmm, I remember that when you have a fraction with radicals in the denominator, a common method is to rationalize the denominator. That way, the denominator becomes free of radicals, which is usually considered simpler. \n\nAlright, so to rationalize the denominator, I should multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a binomial a + b is a - b. In this case, the denominator is 2 + \u221a3, so its conjugate should be 2 - \u221a3. \n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(1 + \u221a2)/(2 + \u221a3) * (2 - \u221a3)/(2 - \u221a3)\n\nMultiplying these two fractions, I can consider it as multiplying the numerators together and the denominators together. So,\n\nNumerator: (1 + \u221a2)(2 - \u221a3)\nDenominator: (2 + \u221a3)(2 - \u221a3)\n\nI need to compute both the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nStarting with the denominator, since it's a difference of squares, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. So here, a is 2 and b is \u221a3. Let's compute that:\n\nDenominator: (2)\u00b2 - (\u221a3)\u00b2 = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nOh, that's nice! The denominator simplifies to 1, which makes things easier.\n\nNow, moving on to the numerator: (1 + \u221a2)(2 - \u221a3). I need to expand this using the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply the First terms: 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nNext, the Outer terms: 1 * (-\u221a3) = -\u221a3.\n\nThen, the Inner terms: \u221a2 * 2 = 2\u221a2.\n\nLastly, the Last terms: \u221a2 * (-\u221a3) = -\u221a6.\n\nPutting it all together, the numerator becomes:\n\n2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6.\n\nSo now, the entire expression after rationalizing is:\n\n(2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6)/1.\n\nSince the denominator is 1, it simplifies to:\n\n2 - \u221a3 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a6.\n\nNow"

            "output": ", the problem asks for the simplified expression in the form A(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD), where A, B, C, and D are positive integers.\n\nLet me write down what I have:\n\n2 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a3 - \u221a6.\n\nHmm, comparing this with the desired form: A(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD).\n\nSo, looking at the terms:\n\n2 is a constant term, 2\u221a2 is a term with a single radical, -\u221a3 and -\u221a6 are terms with radicals.\n\nIn the desired form, A(1 + \u221aB) would produce terms: A*1 and A\u221aB. Then, subtracting (\u221aC + \u221aD) would subtract \u221aC and \u221aD.\n\nSo, let me try to match the terms.\n\nFirst, the constant term in my expression is 2. In the desired form, A(1 + \u221aB) contributes A. The other terms involve subtraction of radicals. So probably, A needs to account for the constant term and possibly the other radicals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is such that when we distribute it, it can help combine some terms. Let me think further.\n\nAlternatively, let me write my expression as:\n\n2 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a3 - \u221a6.\n\nI need to express this as A(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD).\n\nLet me distribute A:\n\nA + A\u221aB - \u221aC - \u221aD.\n\nNow, let's compare to my expression:\n\nConstant term: 2 vs A.\nRadical term with \u221a2: 2\u221a2 vs A\u221aB.\nRadical terms with \u221a3: -\u221a3 vs -\u221aC.\nRadical terms with \u221a6: -\u221a6 vs -\u221aD.\n\nSo, let me set up equations based on the terms:\n\n1. Constant term: A = 2.\n2. Radical term \u221a2: A\u221aB = 2\u221a2.\n   Since A is 2, 2\u221aB = 2\u221a2. Therefore, \u221aB = \u221a2. Thus, B = 2.\n3. Radical term \u221a3: -\u221aC = -\u221a3. Therefore, C = 3.\n4. Radical term \u221a6: -\u221aD = -\u221a6. Therefore, D = 6.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nIf I set A = "

Perfect!\n\nTherefore, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6.\n\nAdding them up: A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything to be sure.\n\nOriginal expression: (1 + \u221a2)/(2 + \u221a3). After rationalizing, we got 2 + 2\u221a2 - \u221a3 - \u221a6. Then, expressing as 2(1 + \u221a2) - (\u221a3 + \u221a6). So yes, that's exactly the form given. So A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. Sum is 2+2+3+6=13.\n\nHmm, but let me check if there's another way to represent it. For instance, maybe the problem expects different groupings? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms can be arranged differently, but I don't think so. Let me see:\n\nSuppose I tried to write it as A(1 + \u221aB) - (\u221aC + \u221aD). The key is that the first term must account for the constants and the 2\u221a2. Since the constant term is 2, A must be 2, and then the \u221aB term must be \u221a2, so that when multiplied by A=2 gives 2\u221a2. So that's exactly what I did. The other terms are straightforward. So I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13. So the final answer is 13, which in boxed form is \\boxed{13}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\):\n\n"
