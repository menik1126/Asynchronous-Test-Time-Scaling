Hmm, I remember that when you have a fraction with radicals in the denominator, a common method is to rationalize the denominator. That way, the denominator becomes free of radicals, which is usually considered simpler. \n\nAlright, so to rationalize the denominator, I should multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a binomial a + b is a - b. In this case, the denominator is 2 + √3, so its conjugate should be 2 - √3. \n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(1 + √2)/(2 + √3) * (2 - √3)/(2 - √3)\n\nMultiplying these two fractions, I can consider it as multiplying the numerators together and the denominators together. So,\n\nNumerator: (1 + √2)(2 - √3)\nDenominator: (2 + √3)(2 - √3)\n\nI need to compute both the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nStarting with the denominator, since it's a difference of squares, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So here, a is 2 and b is √3. Let's compute that:\n\nDenominator: (2)² - (√3)² = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nOh, that's nice! The denominator simplifies to 1, which makes things easier.\n\nNow, moving on to the numerator: (1 + √2)(2 - √3). I need to expand this using the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply the First terms: 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nNext, the Outer terms: 1 * (-√3) = -√3.\n\nThen, the Inner terms: √2 * 2 = 2√2.\n\nLastly, the Last terms: √2 * (-√3) = -√6.\n\nPutting it all together, the numerator becomes:\n\n2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\nSo now, the entire expression after rationalizing is:\n\n(2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6)/1.\n\nSince the denominator is 1, it simplifies to:\n\n2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\nNow"

            "output": ", the problem asks for the simplified expression in the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D), where A, B, C, and D are positive integers.\n\nLet me write down what I have:\n\n2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nHmm, comparing this with the desired form: A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D).\n\nSo, looking at the terms:\n\n2 is a constant term, 2√2 is a term with a single radical, -√3 and -√6 are terms with radicals.\n\nIn the desired form, A(1 + √B) would produce terms: A*1 and A√B. Then, subtracting (√C + √D) would subtract √C and √D.\n\nSo, let me try to match the terms.\n\nFirst, the constant term in my expression is 2. In the desired form, A(1 + √B) contributes A. The other terms involve subtraction of radicals. So probably, A needs to account for the constant term and possibly the other radicals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is such that when we distribute it, it can help combine some terms. Let me think further.\n\nAlternatively, let me write my expression as:\n\n2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nI need to express this as A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D).\n\nLet me distribute A:\n\nA + A√B - √C - √D.\n\nNow, let's compare to my expression:\n\nConstant term: 2 vs A.\nRadical term with √2: 2√2 vs A√B.\nRadical terms with √3: -√3 vs -√C.\nRadical terms with √6: -√6 vs -√D.\n\nSo, let me set up equations based on the terms:\n\n1. Constant term: A = 2.\n2. Radical term √2: A√B = 2√2.\n   Since A is 2, 2√B = 2√2. Therefore, √B = √2. Thus, B = 2.\n3. Radical term √3: -√C = -√3. Therefore, C = 3.\n4. Radical term √6: -√D = -√6. Therefore, D = 6.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nIf I set A = "

Perfect!\n\nTherefore, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6.\n\nAdding them up: A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything to be sure.\n\nOriginal expression: (1 + √2)/(2 + √3). After rationalizing, we got 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6. Then, expressing as 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). So yes, that's exactly the form given. So A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. Sum is 2+2+3+6=13.\n\nHmm, but let me check if there's another way to represent it. For instance, maybe the problem expects different groupings? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms can be arranged differently, but I don't think so. Let me see:\n\nSuppose I tried to write it as A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D). The key is that the first term must account for the constants and the 2√2. Since the constant term is 2, A must be 2, and then the √B term must be √2, so that when multiplied by A=2 gives 2√2. So that's exactly what I did. The other terms are straightforward. So I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.
