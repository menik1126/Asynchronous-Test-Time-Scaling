            "output": "I need to simplify the given expression step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on simplifying the numerator: (5/\u221a80) + (\u221a845/9) + \u221a45.\n\nI'll start by simplifying each term individually.\n\nFor 5/\u221a80, I can simplify \u221a80. Since 80 is 16 times 5, \u221a80 is \u221a16 * \u221a5, which equals 4\u221a5. So, 5/\u221a80 becomes 5/(4\u221a5) and then rationalizing the denominator, it becomes 5\u221a5 / 20, which simplifies to \u221a5 / 4.\n\nNext, for \u221a845, I'll factor 845. Dividing 845 by 5 gives 169, which is 13 squared. So, \u221a845 is \u221a(5 * 13\u00b2) = 13\u221a5. Therefore, \u221a845 / 9 becomes (13\u221a5)/9.\n\nFor \u221a45, I'll simplify it by breaking it down into \u221a(9 * 5) = 3\u221a5.\n\nNow, adding the simplified terms:\n\u221a5 / 4 + (13\u221a5)/9 + 3\u221a5.\n\nTo add these, I'll find a common denominator, which is 36. Converting each term:\n(9\u221a5)/36 + (52\u221a5)/36 + (108\u221a5)/36 = (169\u221a5)/36.\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to 169\u221a5 / 36.\n\nNow, the original expression is (169\u221a5 / 36) divided by \u221a5. Dividing by \u221a5 is the same as multiplying by 1/\u221a5, which gives (169\u221a5) / (36 * \u221a5) = 169 / 36.\n\nSince 169 and 36 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}}+\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9}+\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt{5}}}$$\n\n**Step 1:** Simplify each term in the numerator.\n\n1.
