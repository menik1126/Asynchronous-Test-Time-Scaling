            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of a fraction. The numerator inside the square root is (5 divided by the square root of 80) plus (the square root of 845 divided by 9) plus the square root of 45. All of that is divided by the square root of 5. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I can try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to simplify each of these terms in the numerator before I can deal with the square root and the overall fraction. Let's take each term one by one.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 divided by the square root of 80. I remember that having a square root in the denominator is something we usually rationalize. So, how do I simplify √80? Well, 80 can be factored into 16 times 5 because 16 times 5 is 80. And since 16 is a perfect square, its square root is 4. So, √80 is √(16*5) which is √16 times √5, which is 4√5. Therefore, 5 divided by √80 is 5 divided by 4√5. Hmm, that still has a square root in the denominator. Maybe I can rationalize that.\n\nTo rationalize 5/(4√5), I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by √5. That gives me (5√5)/(4*√5*√5). The denominator becomes 4*√25, which is 4*5, so 20. So, the first term simplifies to (5√5)/20, which can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 5, giving √5/4.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second term: √845 divided by 9. I need to simplify √845. Let's see if 845 has any square factors. 845 divided by 5 is 169. So, 845 is 5*169. Now, 169 is 13 squared, so √845 is √(5*13²) which is 13√5. Therefore, the second term becomes (13√5)/9.\n\nNow the third term: √45. Similarly, I need to simplify √45. 45 is 9*5, and 9 is a perfect square. So, √45 is √(9*"

            "output": "5) which is 3√5.\n\nOkay, so now let's rewrite the entire numerator with these simplified terms. The first term was √5/4, the second term was (13√5)/9, and the third term was 3√5. So, the numerator becomes:\n\n√5/4 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5.\n\nHmm, that's all in terms of √5, so I can factor that out. Let me write it as:\n\n√5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. Since each term has √5, yes, factoring it out gives √5 times the sum of the coefficients. So, the coefficient is 1/4 + 13/9 + 3.\n\nNow, I need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator for 4, 9, and 1 is 36. So, let's convert each fraction:\n\n1/4 is equal to 9/36.\n\n13/9 is equal to 52/36.\n\n3 is equal to 108/36.\n\nNow, adding them together: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36. Let's compute the numerators:\n\n9 + 52 is 61, and 61 + 108 is 169. So, the sum is 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is √5*(169/36) = (169√5)/36.\n\nSo, going back to the original expression, the numerator is (169√5)/36, and the denominator is √5. So, the entire expression inside the square root is ((169√5)/36) divided by √5.\n\nDividing these, the √5 in the numerator and the denominator will cancel out. So, we have (169/36) divided by 1, which is just 169/36.\n\nNow, the original expression is the square root of this. So, √(169/36). I know that √(a/b) is √a / √b, so √169 is 13, and √36 is 6. So, that reduces to 13/6.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make"

That seems correct.\n\n2. √845: 845 is 5*13², so √845 is 13√5. Divided by 9, so (13√5)/9. Correct.\n\n3. √45: 45 is 9*5, so √45 is 3√5. Yes.\n\nAdding them up: √5*(1/4 +13/9 +3). Converting to common denominator 36:\n\n1/4 = 9/36, 13/9 = 52/36, 3 = 108/36. Adding: 9 +52=61, 61+108=169. So, 169/36. Therefore, numerator is (169√5)/36.\n\nThen, the entire expression is ((169√5)/36) / √5. The √5 cancels, leaving 169/36. Taking the square root: √169 / √36 =13/6. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, the final simplified fraction is 13/6.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is simplified by rationalizing each term, factoring out √5, finding a common denominator, and then taking the square root.
