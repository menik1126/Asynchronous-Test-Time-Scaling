            "output": "First, I need to translate the given statement into an equation. The problem says that half the value of \\(3x - 9\\) is equal to \\(x + 37\\).\n\nTo find half of \\(3x - 9\\), I divide the entire expression by 2. This gives me the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 9}{2} = x + 37\n\\]\n\nNext, to eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply every term in the equation by 2. This simplifies the equation to:\n\\[\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\\]\n\nNow, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. I'll subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get:\n\\[\nx - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\nThen, I'll add 9 to both sides to find the value of \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = 83\n\\]\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n\\]\n\nLet's solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Multiply both sides by 2** to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2(x + 37)\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Distribute** the \\( 2 \\) on the right side:\n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Subtract \\( 2x \\)** from both sides to gather like terms:\n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Add 9** to both sides to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 83\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{83}\n\\]"
