What is the value of \\(x\\)?\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1. **Interpret the Given Equation:**\n   \n   We are told that half the value of \\(3x - 9\\) equals \\(x + 37\\). This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eliminate the Fraction:**\n   \n   To simplify the equation, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\times (x + 37)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get all terms containing \\(x\\) on one side:\n   \\[\n   3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n"
