The answer should be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers with \\( a \\) square-free, and then find \\( a + b \\). Hmm, let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance between two points \\( (x, y) \\) and \\( (0, 0) \\) is given by the distance formula: \\( d = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} \\), which simplifies to \\( d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nSince the point \\( (x, y) \\) lies on the graph of the given function, I can substitute \\( y \\) with \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). That means the distance equation becomes \\( d = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\).\n\nLet me write that out more clearly:\n\n\\( d = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{x^2 - 3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2} \\)\n\nSimplifying the second term, squaring the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{x^2 - 3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\)\n\nSo now, the distance squared (since minimizing \\( d \\) is equivalent to minimizing \\( d^2 \\)) is:\n\n\\( d^2 = x^2 + \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\)\n\nLet me set up an equation for this:\n\n\\( d^2 = x^2 + \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\)\n\nTo find the minimum distance, I need to find the critical points of this function. That means taking the derivative with respect to \\( x \\), setting it equal to zero, and solving for \\( x \\). Let's compute the derivative.\n\nFirst, let me"

The function is a parabola opening upwards since it's quadratic in x with a positive coefficient.\n\nThe vertex of the parabola is at x=0, y= (1/√2)(0 -3)= -3/√2. So, the vertex is below the origin.\n\nBut the origin is at (0, 0). So, the distance from origin to the vertex is sqrt(0^2 + (-3/√2)^2)= sqrt(9/2)= 3/√2.\n\nWe found a point at x=√2, y= (1/√2)( ( (√2)^2 -3 ))= (1/√2)(2 -3)= -1/√2.\n\nTherefore, the point is (√2, -1/√2). Distance from origin is sqrt( (√2)^2 + (-1/√2)^2 )= sqrt(2 + 1/2)= sqrt(5/2)= sqrt(10)/2≈1.581.\n\nCompare that to distance at vertex: 3/√2≈2.121.
