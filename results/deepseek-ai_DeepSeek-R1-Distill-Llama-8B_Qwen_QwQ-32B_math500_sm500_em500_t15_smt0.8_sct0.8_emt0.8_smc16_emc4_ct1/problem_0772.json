The answer should be expressed in the form \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the distance from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) is given by the distance formula: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Since I need to find the smallest distance, I should find the minimum value of this distance function subject to the constraint that \\( y \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\).\n\nMaybe I can set up this as an optimization problem. I remember that to minimize a function with a constraint, I can use calculus, specifically the method of Lagrange multipliers. But I'm a bit fuzzy on how exactly that works, so maybe I should approach it another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the distance squared is easier to work with because the square root can complicate things when taking derivatives, I can consider minimizing the square of the distance. The square of the distance \\( D \\) from the origin to the point \\( (x, y) \\) is \\( x^2 + y^2 \\). So, if I substitute \\( y \\) from the given equation into this distance formula, I can get a function in terms of \\( x \\) alone, which I can then minimize.\n\nLet me try that. Substitute \\( y \\) into \\( D \\):\n\n\\( D = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\)\n\nExpanding that:\n\nFirst, square the \\( y \\) term:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( D \\) becomes:\n\n\\( D = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}("
