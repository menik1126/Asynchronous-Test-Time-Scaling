Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit confused about the exponents and the roots, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, let's write down what we know. A equals 8, so that's \\( a = 8 \\). The expression we need to evaluate is \\( \\left(16\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe if I break it down, it'll make more sense.\n\nI think the first thing I should do is substitute \\( a = 8 \\) into the equation. So wherever I see an \\( a \\), I can replace it with 8. Let me write that out:\n\n\\( \\left(16\\sqrt[3]{8^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nAlright, now I need to figure out what \\( 8^2 \\) is. Squaring 8, I remember that 8 times 8 is 64. So:\n\n\\( 8^2 = 64 \\).\n\nSo substituting that back in, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\left(16\\sqrt[3]{64}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nNow, I need to compute the cube root of 64. I know that the cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives the original number. So, what number multiplied by itself three times gives 64? Let me think.\n\nI recall that \\( 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64 \\). So, \\( \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\). Let me check that: 4 cubed is indeed 64 because 4 times 4 is 16, and 16 times 4 is 64. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, replacing \\( \\sqrt[3]{64} \\) with 4, the equation now is:\n\n\\( \\left(16 \\times 4\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nCalculating 16 times 4 next. I know that 16 multiplied by 4 is "

            "output": "64 because 16 times 2 is 32, and 32 plus 32 is 64. So, 16 times 4 is 64. So now the equation becomes:\n\n\\( (64)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nWait, so that's 64 raised to the power of 1/3. What does that mean? I know that a fractional exponent like \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) indicates a cube root. So, \\( 64^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\) is the cube root of 64, which we just figured out is 4. So, putting it all together:\n\n\\( (64)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 4 \\).\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 4. Let me just recap all the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Start with \\( a = 8 \\).\n2. Substitute into the expression: \\( \\left(16\\sqrt[3]{8^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n3. Calculate \\( 8^2 = 64 \\).\n4. Compute \\( \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\).\n5. Multiply 16 by 4 to get 64.\n6. Then take the cube root of 64, which is 4.\n\nEach step seems correct, and I don't see any errors in my calculations. I think I did that right. So, the final answer should be 4.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me approach it differently. Maybe using exponent rules instead of calculating step by step.\n\nOriginal expression: \\( \\left(16\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nI can rewrite 16 as \\( 2^4 \\) because 2^4 is 16. So, \\( 16 = 2^4 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( a = 8 \\), and 8 is \\( 2^3 \\). So, \\( a^2 = (2^3)^2 = 2^{6} \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\sqrt[3]{a^2} = \\sqrt[3]{2^6} \\). The cube root of \\( 2^6 \\) is \\( 2^{6 \\times \\frac{1}{3}} = 2^{2} = 4 \\"

That's another way to see it.\n\nThen, multiply that by 16: \\( 16 \\times 4 = 64 \\), which is \\( 2^6 \\).\n\nNow, taking the cube root of 64 (which is \\( 2^6 \\)) is \\( (2^6)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2^{6 \\times \\frac{1}{3}} = 2^{2} = 4 \\).\n\nHmm, same result. That's reassuring. So, this method also gives 4. So, I think I can confidently say the answer is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the expression as exponents and roots combined. Let me write it all as exponents.\n\n\\( \\left(16 \\times \\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nExpressed in exponents, \\( \\sqrt[3]{a^2} = (a^2)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nSo, the expression becomes \\( 16 \\times (a^2)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\), all raised to the 1/3 power. Wait no, actually, it's the entire thing inside the brackets raised to 1/3.\n\nWait, actually, let me do that step by step.\n\nThe expression is \\( (16 \\times (a^2)^{\\frac{1}{3}})^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nUsing the property that \\( (a \\times b)^c = a^c \\times b^c \\), so we can separate this into:\n\n\\( 16^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\times (a^2)^{\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, it's a product inside a power. So, actually, I think my initial step was correct: \\( (16 \\times (a^2)^{\\frac{1}{3}})^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nAnother approach is to use the exponent rule \\( (a \\times b)^c = a^c \\times b^c \\). So, applying that here:\n\n\\( 16^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\times \\left( (a^2)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\right)^{\\frac{1"

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, exponent rules: when you have a power raised to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, \\( \\left( (a^2)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = (a^2)^{\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3}} = (a^2)^{\\frac{1}{9}} \\). Hmm, but that seems like a different path. Let me see if this approach works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should combine all the exponents first before plugging in the value of a. Let me try that.\n\nStarting over, the original expression is \\( \\left(16\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\nExpress everything in exponents:\n\n16 is 2^4,\n\nsqrt[3]{a^2} is a^(2/3),\n\nso the inside becomes 2^4 * a^(2/3).\n\nThen, raising that to the 1/3 power:\n\n(2^4 * a^(2/3))^(1/3) = 2^(4/3) * a^(2/3 * 1/3) = 2^(4/3) * a^(2/9).\n\nHmm, but then substituting a = 8, which is 2^3,\n\nso a^(2/9) = (2^3)^(2/9) = 2^(6/9) = 2^(2/3).\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes 2^(4/3) * 2^(2/3) = 2^(4/3 + 2/3) = 2^(6/3) = 2^2 = 4.\n\nOh, that's another way to get the same answer. So, that's good. So, even when I approach it through exponent rules, I still end up with 4. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nHmm, so all"
