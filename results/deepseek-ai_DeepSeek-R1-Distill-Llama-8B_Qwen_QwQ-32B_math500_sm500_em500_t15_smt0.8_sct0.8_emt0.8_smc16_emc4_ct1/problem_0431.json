It's given that this equation has 10 complex roots, which are \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The problem is asking for the value of the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the equation. It's a polynomial equation of degree 10, so it should have 10 roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities. The roots come in conjugate pairs because the coefficients of the polynomial are real, as given. So, each \\(r_i\\) has its complex conjugate \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) as another root.\n\nI need to find the sum of the reciprocals of the magnitudes squared of these roots. Remember that for any complex number \\(z\\), the product \\(z\\overline{z}\\) is equal to \\(|z|^2\\), which is the square of the modulus of \\(z\\). So, \\(\\frac{1}{r_i\\overline{r}_i}\\) is the reciprocal of the modulus squared of each root \\(r_i\\).\n\nI recall from complex analysis that for polynomials, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots (or products of roots) can be related to the coefficients of the polynomial. But I need to be precise here.\n\nGiven the polynomial \\(P(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Let me try to expand it or at least understand its structure.\n\nWait, expanding \\( (13x - 1)^{10} \\) would give me a polynomial of degree 10, so when I add it to \\(x^{10}\\), the resulting polynomial will have terms from \\(x^{10}\\) down to the constant term. But it might be complicated to compute all the coefficients.\n\nInstead, maybe I can think about the roots. Since it's a degree 10 polynomial, it has 10 roots as"

Alternatively, we can write:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} \\right)^{10} = -1\n\\]\n\nLet me check that step again. If I have \\(x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10}\\), then dividing both sides by \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x}{13x -1} \\right)^{10} = -1\n\\]\n\nYes, that works. Since if \\(13x -1\\) is zero, then the original equation would have \\(x^{10} = 0\\), but \\(x = 1/13\\) would make \\(13x -1 = 0\\), so that's a point of conflict. Wait, actually, if \\(x = 1/13\\), then the left-hand side would be \\((1/13)^{10}\\) and the right-hand side would be \\(-0^{10} = 0\\), so it's not a solution. So \\(x = 1/13\\) is not a root of the equation, so dividing by \\(13x -1\\) is okay.\n\nTherefore, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} \\right)^{10} = -1\n\\]\n\nTaking the 10th roots of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{13x - 1} = e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9\n\\]\n\nEach of these 10 roots corresponds to a different \\(k\\).

Therefore, each pair contributes twice the same term.\n\nBut hold on, in my earlier analysis, each k=0,...,9, the terms |13 ω_k -1|^2 are all distinct? Or maybe in pairs.\n\nWait, let's compute |13 ω_k -1|^2 for each k.\n\nGiven that ω_k = e^{i(theta_k)}, theta_k = (pi + 2 pi k)/10.\n\nSo, |13 ω_k -1|^2 = (13 ω_k -1)(13 \\overline{ω_k} -1) = 169 +1 -26 Re(13 ω_k)=170 -26*13 cos(theta_k).\n\nWait, wait a second, is that correct?\n\nWait, (13 ω -1)(13 \\overline{ω} -1) = 13^2 ω \\overline{ω} -13 ω -13 \\overline{ω} +1.\n\nSince ω \\overline{ω}=|ω|^2=1, this is 169 -13 ( ω + \\overline{ω} ) +1=170 -13*2 Re(ω)=170 -26 Re(ω).\n\nSo, yes, 170 -26 cos(theta_k). So, for each k, the term is 170 -26 cos(theta_k).\n\nBut when we sum over k=0,...,9, we get 10*170=1700 minus 26 times sum_{k=0}^9 cos(theta_k).\n\nWe have already found that sum_{k=0}^9 cos(theta_k)=0, so sum over all 10 roots is 1700.\n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the sum over 5 roots (each pair has r_i and \\overline{r_i}), each contributing 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}), which is equal to |13 ω_i -1|^2 for one root and the same for its conjugate. Therefore, for each pair, the sum is 2 * |13 ω_i -1|^2.\n\nWait, no, because r_i and \\overline{r_i} both satisfy the equation, so each pair (r_i, \\overline{r_i}) corresponds to two different"

Therefore, the total over all roots is twice the desired sum. Therefore, the desired sum is 1700 /2 =850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850. But let me check with an example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the step where I considered the roots as given by x = ω_k/(13 ω_k -1). Let me verify that.\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\nx^{10} + (13x -1)^10 =0\n\n=> (x/(13x -1))^10 = -1\n\nLet me set z = x/(13x -1). Then z^10 = -1, so z = e^{i(pi + 2 pi k)/10}, which are the 10 roots. So z = ω_k as before.\n\nThen solving for x:\n\nz = x/(13x -1)\n\n=> z*(13x -1) =x\n\n=>13 z x - z =x\n\n=>13 z x -x = z\n\n=>x(13 z -1)= z\n\n=>x = z/(13 z -1)\n\nYes, so x = ω_k/(13 ω_k -1). So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the modulus squared of x is |x|^2 = |ω_k|^2 / |13 ω_k -1|^2 =1/|13 ω_k -1|^2. Therefore, 1/(x \\overline{x}) = |13 ω_k -1|^2. So each term in the sum over all roots is |13 ω_k -1|^2, so the total over all roots is 1700, so the desired sum is 850.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts each pair once, so the answer is 850. But let me see if there is another way to approach this problem, maybe through Vieta's formula.\n\nAlternatively, consider the polynomial equation x^{10} + (13x -1)^10 =0. Let me denote y ="

Let me recheck that.\n\nThe angles theta_k are (pi + 2 pi k)/10 for k from 0 to 9. So, these are angles spaced every 2pi/10 radians, starting at pi/10. So, they are the 10th roots of -1, which are equally spaced on the unit circle, starting at angle pi/10, and each subsequent one is 2pi/10 further.\n\nThe sum of the real parts (cos(theta_k)) of equally spaced points on the unit circle over a full period is zero.
