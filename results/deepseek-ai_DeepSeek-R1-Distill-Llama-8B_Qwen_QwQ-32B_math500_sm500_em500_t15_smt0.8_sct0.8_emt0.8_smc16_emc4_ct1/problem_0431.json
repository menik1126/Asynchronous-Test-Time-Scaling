It says it has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The question is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the products of each pair, i.e., \\(\\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}}\\) for each \\(i\\) from 1 to 5, and then summing those up. \n\nHmm, first, let me recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), \\(r \\overline{r} = |r|^2\\). So, \\(\\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}} = \\frac{1}{|r|^2}\\). That means I'm being asked to compute the sum of the reciprocals of the magnitudes squared of each pair of conjugate roots.\n\nNow, the equation is a polynomial of degree 10, so it has 10 roots, as stated. Each complex root \\(r\\) will have its conjugate \\(\\overline{r}\\) also as a root because the coefficients of the polynomial are real. That makes sense, so each pair \\(r_i, \\overline{r}_i\\) are roots, and there are five such pairs.\n\nI remember that for polynomials, Vieta's formulas relate the sums and products of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. Maybe I can use Vieta's here. Let me consider the given equation in a transformed form to make it more manageable.\n\nLet's set \\(y = 13x - 1\\). Then, the equation becomes \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\). Substituting back, since \\(y = 13x -1\\), we have \\(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0\\). Hmm, that's the same as the original equation.\n\nBut maybe instead of substitution, I can consider the equation \\(x^{10} = -(13x -1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, we get \\(x = \\omega (13x -1)\\"

That seems to confirm the formula's result. Therefore, the sum of cos(theta_k) from k=0 to 9 is zero.\n\nTherefore, the sum over all ten roots of Re(omega) is zero. Therefore, since S = (sum over all ten roots of Re(omega))/2 = 0/2 =0.\n\nWait, but if S = sum over five roots of Re(omega_i) is zero, then going back to our earlier calculation:\n\nThe desired sum is 850 -26*S = 850 -26*0 = 850.\n\nWait, so the sum is 850?
