So, it's like a plus sign with O in the center. The balloon is at point H directly above O. There are ropes from H to each of these points: HA, HB, HC, and HD. \n\nThe lengths of ropes HC and HD are given: HC is 150 meters and HD is 130 meters. The problem says that instead of having two separate ropes for HC and HD, we can replace them with a single rope HP, where P is a point somewhere along the straight line between C and D. The goal is to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this. \n\nSo, to approach this, I think I need to visualize the setup. Let me try to picture the coordinate system. Let’s assume O is at the origin (0,0). Then, since A is directly north, A would be at (0, a) for some a. Similarly, B is directly west, so B would be at (-b, 0), C directly south at (0, -c), and D directly east at (d, 0). Since the diagram shows them as cardinal directions, probably a, b, c, d are positive distances.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the Asymptote code provided, it defines A as (1,1), D as (1.5, -0.3), B as (-1.5, 0.3), and C as (-1, -1). So in this specific case, it's a particular coordinate system where A is northeast, B is southwest, C is southeast, and D is northeast but a bit lower. However, in the problem statement, it's just a flat field, so the coordinates are more abstract. \n\nBut since the problem mentions distances between C and D, and the Asymptote code provides specific coordinates, maybe in the Asymptote code, the distance between C and D is 140 meters. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, C is at (-1, -1) and D is at (1.5, -0.3). So the distance between C and D would be sqrt[(1.5"

So probably, the coordinate system in the problem is scaled such that the distance CD is 140 m. Maybe each unit in the Asymptote code corresponds to, say, 50 m or something? But perhaps it's better not to rely on the diagram's coordinates but rather the problem's textual description. \n\nThe problem says that the distance between C and D is 140 m. Since C is directly south of O and D is directly east of O, then in coordinates, if O is (0,0), C would be (0, -c) and D would be (d, 0). The straight line between C and D would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 0 to d east and vertically from -c to 0. Wait, actually, no—the straight line distance between C and D is sqrt(d² + c²) = 140. \n\nSo that gives us an equation: d² + c² = (140)^2. \n\nNow, the balloon H is directly above O, so H has coordinates (0,0, h) if we consider three dimensions. But since all the ropes are in the horizontal plane, perhaps we can consider it as a vertical height h. The ropes HA, HB, HC, HD connect H to the points A, B, C, D. \n\nGiven that HC is 150 m, so the length from H to C is sqrt((distance from O to C)^2 + h^2) = 150. Similarly, HD is 130 m, so sqrt((distance from O to D)^2 + h^2) = 130. \n\nLet me denote the distances from O to C as c, so |OC| = c, and from O to D as d, so |OD| = d. Then,\n\nHC: sqrt(c² + h²) = 150,\n\nHD: sqrt(d² + h²)"

Let me compute h²:\n\nFrom equation 1: c² + h² = 22500 → h² = 22500 - 12800 = 9700.\n\nSo h = sqrt(9700) ≈ 98.49 meters.\n\nSo, the vertical height is about 98.49 meters.\n\nNow, the problem wants to replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP where P is a point on the straight line CD.

So, we need to maximize the saved length, which is equivalent to minimizing the new length HP.\n\nSo, the total rope length before replacement is HC + HD = 150 + 130 = 280 m.\n\nAfter replacement, it's HP. So the saved length is 280 - HP. To maximize the saved length, we need to minimize HP.\n\nSo, the minimal HP is the shortest distance from H to the line CD. Since H is at (0, h), and CD is a line on the ground. So the minimal distance is the perpendicular distance from H to CD.\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of line CD.

But in terms of distance, the length of HA would be sqrt((0 - 0)^2 + (a - 0)^2 + (h)^2) = sqrt(a² + h²). Similarly, HC is sqrt( (0 - 0)^2 + (-c - 0)^2 + h² ) = sqrt(c² + h²). Wait, but in the problem statement, HC is 150 m, so that's consistent with the equations above.\n\nBut in the problem, the distance between C and D is 140 m. Since C is (0, -c) and D is (d, 0), the distance between them is sqrt( (d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2 ) = sqrt(d² + c²) = 140, which is the third equation.\n\nSo, in order to find the minimal HP, where P is on CD, we can model this as follows:\n\nThe point P is somewhere along CD.

The minimal distance will be the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD.\n\nSo, to find the minimal distance, we can compute the perpendicular distance from point H to line CD.\n\nThe formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line defined by ax + by + c = 0 is |a x0 + b y0 + c| / sqrt(a² + b²).\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of line CD in standard form.\n\nWe already have the equation earlier: y = (c/d)x - c.

So, to find the minimal distance from H to any point P on CD, we can compute the minimal length HP, which is the minimal distance between H and the line CD in 3D space.\n\nWait, but in 3D, the minimal distance from a point to a line is computed by taking the cross product. The formula is |(PH) × v| / |v|, where v is the direction vector of the line.\n\nSo, let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define the line CD. In 3D, points C is (0, -c, 0) and D is (d, 0"

In the cross product approach, we consider the minimal distance in 3D space.

So, the precise calculation is 280 - sqrt(14224.5) ≈ 160.73 meters. But perhaps we can express this in exact terms.\n\nLet me see:\n\nHP = sqrt( (d t)^2 + ( -c + c t )^2 + h² )\n\nBut we can express it in exact terms:\n\n( d t ) = d * (c² / (c² + d²)) = (d c²)/(c² + d²),\n\n( -c + c t ) = -c + c*(c² / (c² + d²)) )= c*(- (d²)/(c² + d²)) = - (c d²)/(c² + d²).\n\nSo, \n\n( d t )² + ( -c + c t )² + h² \n\n= [ (d² c^4)/(c² + d²)^2 ) ] + [ (c² d^4)/(c² + d²"
