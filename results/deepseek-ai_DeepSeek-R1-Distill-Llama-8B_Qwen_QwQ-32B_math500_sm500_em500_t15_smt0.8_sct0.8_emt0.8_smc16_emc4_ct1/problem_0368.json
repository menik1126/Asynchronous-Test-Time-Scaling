The question is saying that there's a plane that's parallel to edges AB and CD and lies halfway between them. This plane cuts the tetrahedron into two pieces, and I need to find the surface area of one of these pieces.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a regular tetrahedron is. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, so every edge is length 2 in this case.\n\nNow, the plane is parallel to edges AB and CD. Since AB and CD are skew lines in 3D space (they don't intersect and aren't parallel), a plane can be parallel to both without containing either. The plane is also said to lie halfway between them. I need to figure out where exactly this plane is cutting the tetrahedron.\n\nI should probably visualize this. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are the same, so edges AB and CD are both length 2 and are opposite edges. The plane cutting them halfway would divide the tetrahedron into two smaller pieces. The key here is to find the cross-section created by this plane and then compute the surface areas of the resulting pieces.\n\nSince the plane is parallel to AB and CD, the cross-section should be a quadrilateral, because the intersection of a plane with a tetrahedron can result in a triangle or a quadrilateral depending on the plane's orientation. In this case, since the plane is parallel to two edges, the cross-section is likely a parallelogram, perhaps even a rectangle or another shape, but I need to confirm.\n\nWait, hold on. In a regular tetrahedron, all faces are equilateral triangles. If a plane is cutting the tetrahedron, the cross-section might not necessarily be a parallelogram. Hmm, maybe it's a smaller triangle or another shape. I need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, since the plane is parallel to two edges, perhaps the cross-section is a quadrilateral. Let me consider the positions of these edges.\n\nEdges AB and CD are opposite in the tetrahedron. So, in the tetrahedron, each pair of opposite edges is non-adjacent. The plane is cutting halfway between them. So, halfway in terms of distance.\n\nI should probably"

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each face is split into two parts, so each piece has half of each face.\n\nWait, but let me think of the tetrahedron divided by the plane x=0. The original tetrahedron has vertices at (1/\u221a2,1/\u221a2,1/\u221a2), (1/\u221a2,-1/\u221a2,-1/\u221a2), (-1/\u221a2,1/\u221a2,-1/\u221a2), (-1/\u221a2,-1/\u221a2,1/\u221a2).\n\nThe plane x=0 divides the tetrahedron into two parts: one part with x \u22650 and one with x \u22640.\n\nThe vertices with x=1/\u221a2 (A and B) are on the x \u22650 side, and vertices with x=-1/\u221a2 (C and D) are on the x \u22640 side.\n\nTherefore, the piece with x \u22650 includes vertices A and B, and the piece with x \u22640 includes vertices C and D.\n\nTherefore, the piece with x \u22650 ("
