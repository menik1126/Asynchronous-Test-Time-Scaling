Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the function definition.\n\nThe function f is defined recursively with three cases:\n\n1. If i = 0 and j is between 0 and 4 (inclusive), then f(i,j) is just mod_5(j + 1). So for i=0, j=0, f(0,0)=1; j=1, f(0,1)=2, and so on up to j=4, f(0,4)=0 (since 5 mod 5 is 0).\n\n2. If i is at least 1 and j = 0, then f(i,0) is equal to f(i-1, 1). So regardless of what i is (as long as i \u2265 1), when j=0, we look at f(i-1,1).\n\n3. If i is at least 1 and j is between 1 and 4, then f(i,j) is equal to f(i-1, f(i,j-1)). So, we have to compute f(i,j-1) first and then use that result as the new j value for the next recursive call, all while decrementing i by 1.\n\nSo, the function f(i,j) can sometimes lead to multiple recursive calls, especially when j is not zero.\n\nMy goal is to compute f(2015, 2). That seems pretty far out, but maybe there's a pattern or cycle that repeats every so often, so I don't have to compute all previous values.\n\nLet me start by understanding what f(i,j) represents. It seems like it's a nested function where each step depends on the previous one. Maybe it's similar to a state machine where each state depends on the previous state in a sequence.\n\nTo get f(2015,2), I need to find a way to express it in terms of smaller i's. Let me see if I can find a recursive pattern or perhaps a cycle in the values.\n\nLet me try computing f(i,j) for small values of i and j to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with i=0:\n\nf(0,0) = mod5(0 + 1) = 1\n\nf(0,1"
