Hmm, I remember that when you have a fraction with a radical in the denominator, you can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\). So, let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the original expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}\n\\]\n\nLet me compute the denominator first because that seems straightforward. Using the difference of squares formula: \\((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\\). Here, \\(a = 2\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{3}\\), so the denominator becomes:\n\\[\n(2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\\]\nOh, that's nice. The denominator simplifies to 1, which makes things easier.\n\nNow, let me work on the numerator: \\((1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})\\). I need to multiply these two binomials. Let's use the distributive property (FOIL method):\n- First: \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\)\n- Outer: \\(1 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}\\)\n- Inner: \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 2 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\)\n- Last: \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nNow, add all these terms together:\n\\[\n2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\nSo, the numerator simplifies to:\n\\[\n2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominator is 1, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n2"

Let me see if I can rewrite my simplified expression to match that form.\n\nLooking at my numerator: \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\). Hmm, the first two terms are constants and a multiple of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), the next two terms are negative square roots. So, perhaps I can factor out a 2 from the terms involving \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nLet me try that:\n\\[\n2 + 2\\sqrt{2} = 2(1 + \\sqrt{2})\n\\]\nAnd the remaining terms are \\(-\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\). So putting it all together:\n\\[\n2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\n\\]\nNow, comparing this to the desired form \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D})\\), I can see that:\n- \\(A = 2\\)\n- \\(B = 2\\)\n- \\(C = 3\\)\n- \\(D = 6\\)\n\nNow, adding these together: \\(2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13\\). Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the original expression, rationalizing the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate. The denominator became 1, which is correct. The numerator expanded to \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\). Factoring out a 2 from the first two terms gave the desired form. \n\nI think that's correct. So, \\(A=2\\), \\(B=2\\), \\(C=3\\), \\(D=6\\), and their sum is 13.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate"
