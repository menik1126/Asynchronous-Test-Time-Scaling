I remember that when dealing with polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help identify possible rational roots, which includes integers since they are a subset of rationals.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(p/q\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are just the factors of -14. That would be \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). Since we're looking for integer roots, we can test each of these.\n\nOkay, let's start testing these possible roots one by one by plugging them into the equation.\n\nFirst, let's try \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1 + 5) + (9 - 1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0\\). Wow, that works! So, 1 is a root.\n\nNow, since 1 is a root, we can factor out \\((x - 1)\\) from the polynomial. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to find the depressed polynomial. Let me use synthetic division because it's usually faster.\n\nSetting up synthetic division with root 1:\n\n1 | 1  5  9  -1  -14\n        1   6   15   14\n      -------------------\n        1  6  15   14    0\n\nSo, after division, the depressed polynomial is \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\). Now, we can factor this cubic polynomial to find more roots.\n\nAgain, using the Rational Root Theorem on the cubic: possible roots are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). Let's"

Not a root.\n\nNext, \\(x=2\\):\n\n\\(8 + 24 + 30 +14 = 8+24=32; 32+30=62; 62+14=76\\neq 0\\). Not a root.\n\nNext, \\(x=-2\\):\n\n\\(-8 + 24 -30 +14 = (-8 +24)=16; (16 -30)= -14; (-14 +14)=0\\). Oh, that's zero! So, -2 is a root. Great.\n\nSo, now we can factor out \\((x + 2)\\) from \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\). Let's do synthetic division again with root -2.\n\n-2 | 1  6  15  14\n         -2  -8  -14\n      ----------------\n         1  4   7    0\n\nSo, the depressed polynomial is now \\(x^2 + 4x +7\\). Hmm, okay, that's a quadratic. Let me check if this quadratic has integer roots.\n\nQuadratic equation: \\(x^2 +4x +7 =0\\). Using the quadratic formula, discriminant \\(D = 16 -28 = -12\\). Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots, let alone integer roots.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic doesn't contribute any real roots, so our only integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any possible roots. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nOriginal equation: \\(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\\). I tested x=1, x=-2, and they worked. Any other integer possibilities?\n\nWait, maybe I should test x=7 and x=14, just to be thorough, because sometimes factors can be larger.\n\nTesting x=7:\n\n\\(7^4 +5*7^3 +9*7^2 -7 -14\\"
