Hmm, okay, where do I start?\n\nFirst off, I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help find possible rational roots. Since the problem asks for integer roots, I can apply this theorem. The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at the equation, the constant term is \\(-14\\), and the leading coefficient is \\(1\\) because the highest power of \\(x\\) is \\(x^4\\). So, the possible values for \\(p\\) are the factors of \\(-14\\), which are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). And since \\(q\\) is \\(1\\), the possible rational roots are just these integers: \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\).\n\nAlright, so I need to test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation and seeing if the equation equals zero.\n\nLet's start with \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1+5) + (9-1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0\\).\n\nOh, that works! So, \\(x=1\\) is a root. Great, one root found.\n\nNow, let's try \\(x = -1\\):\n\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 -5 + 9 +1 -14\\).\n\nCalculating step by step: \\(1 -5 = -4\\), \\(-4 +9 =5\\), \\(5 +1=6\\), \\(6 -14 =-8\\). Not zero. So, \\(x=-1\\) isn't a root.\n\nNext, \\(x=2\\):\n\n\\(2^4 +5("

So, \\(x=2\\) isn't a root.\n\nHow about \\(x=-2\\):\n\n\\((-2)^4 +5(-2)^3 +9(-2)^2 - (-2) -14 = 16 -40 +36 +2 -14\\).\n\nCalculating: \\(16-40=-24\\), \\(-24+36=12\\), \\(12+2=14\\), \\(14-14=0\\). Oh, that's zero! So, \\(x=-2\\) is another root.\n\nMoving on to \\(x=7\\). Maybe that's a bit big, but let's try:\n\n\\(7^4 +5(7)^3 +9(7)^2 -7 -14\\). Let's compute each term:\n\n\\(7^4 = 2401\\), \\(5*7^3 = 5*343=1715\\), \\(9*7^2 = 9*49=441\\), then subtract 7 and 14.\n\nAdding them up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116; 4116 + 441 = 4557; 4557 -7 -14 = 4557 -21 = 4536. That's way too big, definitely not zero. So, \\(x=7\\) isn't a root.\n\nWhat about \\(x=-7\\):\n\n\\((-7)^4 +5(-7)^3 +9(-7)^2 - (-7) -14\\). Let's compute each term:\n\n\\((-7)^4 = 2401\\), \\(5*(-7)^3 = 5*(-343) = -1715\\), \\(9*(-7)^2=9*49=441\\), then subtract (-7) which is +7, and minus 14.\n\nAdding up: 2401 -1715 = 686; 686 +441 = 1127; 1127 +7=1134; 1134 -14=1120. Not zero. So, \\(x=-7\\) isn't a root.\n\nNow, \\(x=14\\)."

Let me compute step by step.\n\n14 squared is 196, so 14^4 is 196^2. 196*196: 200^2 = 40000; subtract 4*200*1 + (1^2)= 40000 - 800 -1 = 39200 -1=39200? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 196 is 200-4, so (200-4)^2=200^2 - 2*200*4 +4^2=40000 -1600 +16= 40000-1600=38400+16=38416.\n\nSo, \\(14^4=38416\\), \\(5*14^3=5*(2744)=13720\\), \\(9*14^2=9*196=1764\\).\n\nAdding them up: 38416 +13720 = 52136; 52136 +1764=538, 52136 +1764 is 538 (wait, no, 52136 +1764: 52000 +1764=53764, plus 136: 53764+136=53900).

So, after finding two integer roots, I can factor the polynomial using these roots and then find the remaining roots.\n\nSo, let me try to factor the polynomial.\n\nGiven the equation \\(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14 =0\\). Since \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\) are roots, then \\((x -1)\\) and \\((x +2)\\) are factors.\n\nSo, let's perform polynomial division to factor out these terms.\n\nFirst, let's divide the polynomial by \\((x-1)\\).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nSet up for \\(x=1\\):\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 1: 1*1=1.
