            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². So, ω can be any of these three values. That might be important later on.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I want to find all possible values of S as ω varies over the cube roots of unity. Since there are three roots, ω, ω², and 1, maybe the value of S will be different for each of these, or maybe some are the same.\n\nLet me consider each case one by one.\n\nFirst, let's take ω = 1. Then the expression becomes S = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So when ω is 1, S = 1.\n\nNext, let's take ω such that ω ≠ 1. Since ω³ = 1, ω is a primitive cube root of unity. In this case, ω² + ω + 1 = 0. I remember this identity from algebra; it comes from the equation x³ - 1 = 0, which factors as (x - 1)(x² + x + 1) = 0. So, since ω ≠ 1, ω² + ω + 1 = 0.\n\nThat might help simplify the expression. Let's see.\n\nSo, starting with S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nPerhaps I can find a common denominator or manipulate these fractions to relate them to the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express ω² in terms of ω using that identity. Since ω² = -ω - 1, from ω² + ω + 1 = 0.\n\nLet me try substituting ω² into the expression.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω²) becomes 1/(1 + (-ω - 1))"

            "output": " = 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If ω² = -ω -1, then 1 + ω² = 1 + (-ω -1) = -ω. So yes, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.\n\nSimilarly, let's see the first term: 1/(1 + ω). Let's see if we can manipulate that as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adding the two fractions directly.\n\nLet me try adding them:\n\nS = [1/(1 + ω)] + [1/(1 + ω²)].\n\nLet me compute the common denominator, which is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's compute numerator:\n\n(1)(1 + ω²) + (1)(1 + ω) = (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo numerator is 2 + ω + ω², denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²).\n\nBut from the identity ω² + ω + 1 = 0, we know that ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, the numerator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo numerator is 1, denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Therefore, S = 1 / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].\n\nHmm, so now I need to compute the denominator. Let's compute (1 + ω)(1 + ω²).\n\nExpanding that, it's 1*(1) + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω².\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, the last term is 1.\n\nSo altogether, the denominator becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = (1 + 1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (-1) = 1, since ω + ω² = -1.\n\nWait, let me check that again step by step:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1"

So if I substitute ω² in terms of ω and get S, I end up with S = 1, whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root.\n\nWait, earlier, when I set ω = 1, I also got S = 1, so does that mean that for all cube roots of unity, S is equal to 1?\n\nBut hold on, let me cross-verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let's try with ω = e^(2πi/3), which is one of the primitive cube roots of unity. Then ω² is e^(4πi/3).\n\nCompute S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nLet me compute 1 + ω and 1 + ω² numerically.\n\n1 + ω = 1 + e^(2πi/3). Let's compute this in rectangular form. e^(2πi/3) is cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2. So 1 + ω = 1 - 1/2 + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2, which in the complex plane is a vector pointing at 60 degrees with magnitude 1.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² is 1 + e^(4πi/3). e^(4πi/3) is cos(4π/3) + i sin(4π/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2, so 1 + ω² = 1 - 1/2 - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2. That's the complex conjugate of 1 + ω.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω) = 1"

Similarly, for ω = e^(4πi/3), I can do the same calculation and likely get the same result.\n\nWait, perhaps for all cube roots of unity, S is equal to 1, including when ω = 1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought S might be different, but algebraically and numerically it seems it's 1 in all cases.\n\nWait, let me test when ω = 1 separately. When ω = 1, 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2, same for 1/(1 + 1) is 1/2. So adding them gives 1, same as the other cases. So that would mean that regardless of whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², S is always 1.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because when ω is 1, the denominators are real numbers, but when ω is a primitive cube root, the denominators are complex.\n\nBut according to both algebraic manipulation and numerical calculation, the sum is 1 in both cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the original algebraic approach again.\n\nWe"
