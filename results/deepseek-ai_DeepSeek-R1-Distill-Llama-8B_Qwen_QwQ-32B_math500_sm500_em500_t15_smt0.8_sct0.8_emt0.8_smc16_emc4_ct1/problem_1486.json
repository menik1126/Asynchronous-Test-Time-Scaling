Since 729 is 9³, which is 9 multiplied by itself three times, the square root of 1/729 is 1 divided by 9, or 1/9.\n\nNext, I'll handle the cube root of 1/9. The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 9 is approximately 2.08, but since we want an exact expression, it's better to keep it as 1/9 under the cube root.\n\nFinally, I'll take the square root of the cube root of 1/9. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of the cube root of 9 remains under the radical as (1/9)^(1/2). To rationalize the denominator, I'll express 1/9 as 1/9.\n\nAfter simplifying, the expression becomes (1/9)^(1/2), which is the same as 1/3. Therefore, the simplified form of √(∛(√(1/729))) is 1/3.\n</think>\n\nLet's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Step 1:** Simplify the innermost radical.\n\nWe have:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}\n$$\n\nSince \\(729 = 9^3\\), we can write:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9^3}} = \\frac{1}{9^{3/2}} = \\frac{1}{9 \\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{1}{9 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{27}\n$$\n\n**Step 2:** Take the cube root of the result from Step 1.\n\n$$\n\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\n**Step 3:** Take the square root of the result from Step 2.\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n$$\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}\n$$"
