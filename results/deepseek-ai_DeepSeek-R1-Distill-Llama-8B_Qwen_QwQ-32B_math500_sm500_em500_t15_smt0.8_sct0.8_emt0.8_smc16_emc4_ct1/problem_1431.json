For a number to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\nSince \\( 2^{24} \\) only has the prime 2 raised to the 24th power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\). This means that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nNext, I'll find all the positive divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since \\( n > 1 \\), the possible values for \\( n \\) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) it is true that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Perfect Powers:**\n   - A number \\( a \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( a = k^n \\).\n   - For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Insight:**\n   - The prime factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\) is \\( 2^{24} \\).\n   - The exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\) for \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n\n3. **"
