Instead, we can analyze the pattern of units digits for powers of 24.\n\n3. **Pattern of Units Digits for Powers of 24:**\n   The units digit of \\(24^k\\) depends only on the units digit of \\(4^k\\) (since 24 ends in 4). The units digit of powers of 4 cycles every 2:\n   \\[\n   4^1 = 4 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 4) \\\\\n   4^2 = 16 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 6) \\\\\n   4^3 = 64 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 4) \\\\\n   4^4 = 256 \\quad (\\text{units digit } 6) \\\\\n   \\]\n   Thus, the units digit cycles between 4 and 6 for exponents 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\n4. **Simplify the Exponent Modulo 2:**\n   To determine whether the exponent is even or odd, we compute the exponent modulo 2. The exponent here is \\(24^{24^{24^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{24}}}}}}\\) (with 24 terms). Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is also even. Therefore, the exponent is even.\n\n5. **Determine the Units Digit:**\n   Since the exponent is even, the units digit of \\(4^{\\text{even}}\\) is 6. However, this is only the first layer of the tower. But notice that the tower itself is extremely large, and even the first exponent (24) is already even. However, since the base of the tower is 24 (ending in 4), and any tower of exponents with an even exponent will result in a units digit of 6. However, we must consider the entire tower's effect.\n\nWait, actually, there's a mistake here. Let me re-examine:\n\nWait, the tower is \\(24^{24^{24^{\\cdot"

Then, the entire tower is \\(24^{E}\\). \n\nWait, no. Actually, the superfactorial is \\(24^{24^{24^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{24}}}}}}}\\) with 24 terms, which is the same as \\(24^{E}\\), where \\(E\\) is the same tower with 24 exponents.\n\nBut since 24 is even, the exponent E is \\(24^{24^{\\dots}}\\), which is even. But the exponent is even, so:\n\n\\(24^{E} \\mod 10 = (24 \\mod 10)^{E} \\mod 10 = 4^{E} \\mod 10\\)\n\nNow, since E is even, \\(4^{E} \\mod 10 = 6\\). So, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but earlier thought that it would be 0. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nActually, the key is that in the tower exponentiation, once you have an exponent tower that is 24, 24, etc., the final exponent is enormous, but since it's even, the result is 6. However, for the problem of \\(4\\$$, it's similar to 24^{24^{...}}, which is 24^{E}, with E being 24^{...}, which is even.\n\nWait, but 24 has units digit 4. So, 24^{anything even} would be 6 mod 10.\n\nBut in the superfactorial \\(4\\$$, we have 4! is 24, so the tower above is 24^{24^{...}} with 24 levels, which is 24^{E}, with E=24^{...} with 24 levels.\n\nWait, but in the end, the exponent is even, so 4^{even} ends with 6.\n\nBut wait, actually, in the superfactorial, it's not 24^{24^{...}}; the base is 24, and then each level is 24.\n\nBut regardless, let's think step by step.\n\n1.

Let me try again.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe units digit of a tower a^b^c^... mod 10 can be found using Euler's theorem, but since 10 factors into 2 and 5, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to note that for modulus 10, the units digit cycles every certain number.\n\nAlternatively, since 24 is divisible by 4, so 24 mod 4 is 0.

Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, if I consider modulus 10, but perhaps I need to consider modulus 4 for the exponent?\n\nWait, let me try another approach using Euler's theorem properly.\n\nEuler's theorem requires that the base and modulus are coprime. Since 4 and 10 are not coprime (gcd(4,10)=2), Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. So, we can't use \u03c6(10)=4 here.\n\nTherefore, the previous approach of noting the cycle of 4's powers mod 10 is better.\n\nSince 4^1 mod10=4, 4^2=6, 4^3=4, etc., the cycle length is 2.

If the tower has only 1 term, then it's just 24, which has units digit 4. But the problem states that the superfactorial is defined with n! terms, so for n=4, it's 24 terms. So, with 24 terms, the exponent is even, so the result is 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 6.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought that 24 mod 4 is 0, so 24^anything mod 4 is 0, but that's not directly helpful here.
