Hmm, okay, the superfactorial is like taking n! and raising it to the power of n! repeatedly, right? So for 4$$, it's 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of 4! and so on, how many times? It says it's n! times. Since 4! is 24, so 4$$ is 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 exponents. That seems like a lot, but I only need the units digit.\n\nI remember that units digits often repeat in cycles when you exponentiate numbers. So maybe I can find a pattern in the units digit of powers of 4! or something like that. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out what 4! is. 4! = 24. So the base here is 24. The units digit of 24 is 4, so maybe I can consider powers of 4 and see how the units digit behaves.\n\nWait, but 24 is 2 more than 20, but perhaps considering modulo 10 would be better since we're interested in the units digit. So, 24 mod 10 is 4. So, the units digit of 24^k is the same as the units digit of 4^k. That simplifies the problem because I can just consider powers of 4 and find the pattern in their units digits.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the units digit of 4^k where k is a tower of exponents: 24^24^24^24^24. That's a huge exponent. But since units digits cycle every 4 for powers of 4, right? Let me recall:\n\n4^1 = 4 (units digit 4)\n4^2 = 16 (units digit 6)\n4^3 = 64 (units digit 4)\n4^4 = 256 (units digit 6)\nAnd then it repeats every 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nWait, so the cycle length is 2, not"

Therefore, the units digit of 4^k is 4 if k is odd, and 6 if k is even.\n\nTherefore, to determine the units digit of 24^(24^(...^24))...), which is 4^(k), where k is a tower of exponents.

The definition says it's an exponent tower of n! terms, each being n!.\n\nSo, since n is 4, n! is 24, so the tower has 24 instances of 24. Therefore the expression is:\n\n24^(24^(24^...(24 times)...))\n\nSo, to compute the units digit of this, since we found that 24 mod 10 = 4, and 24 \u2261 4 mod 10.

Since we need the exponent k here, which is the entire tower except the bottom 24, which is 24^(24^(...)) with 23 more 24's on top.\n\nWait, but maybe this can be tackled step by step using Euler's theorem or something similar?\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with mod 10, perhaps break into mod 2 and mod 5 and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Hmm, but maybe it's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, since we found that the units digit of 4^k depends on whether k is even or odd. Let me think.\n\nWait, 4^k's units digit is 4 if exponent k is odd, 6 if even.\n\nTherefore, to find the units digit of the entire tower, we need to know whether the total exponent (the tower above the bottom 24) is even or odd.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe"

So for n=4, it's a tower with 24 exponents, each being 24.\n\nSo, expression is:\n\n24^(24^(24^(...))) with 24 exponents. So the top exponent is 24, the next one is 24^(24), and so on, until the 24th exponent.\n\nBut wait, that's 24 layers. So, the top layer is 24, the second layer is 24^24, the third layer is 24^(24^24), and so on.\n\nSo when we compute the units digit, it depends on the exponent tower. So, 24^(something) mod 10 is equal to 4^(something) mod 10. And as I saw before, 4^k mod10 cycles with period 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nThus, 4^k mod10 is 4 if k is odd, 6 if k is even.\n\nTherefore, to find 24^(something) mod10, we need something mod2, because 4^k mod10 depends only on k mod2.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is:\n\n1.

Hmm, maybe I can break it down mod2 and mod5, then use Chinese Remainder The.\n\nWait, 4 and 10 are not coprime, so Euler's theorem doesn't apply here. Alternatively, perhaps better to compute the exponent tower mod2 and mod5 separately, since 10=2*5, and"

Let me call that exponent E. So the total expression is 24^E mod10 = 4^E mod10. Since 4^E mod10 is 4 if E is odd, 6 if even. So we need to find whether E is even or odd.\n\nBut E is 24^(24^(...)) with 23 exponents. Let's see, 24 is even, so any power of 24 is even. So 24^anything is even. Therefore, the exponent E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod10 is 6. Wait, but hold on, let me check.\n\nWait, the exponent E is 24^(24^(...)) with 23 exponents. Since 24 is even, any exponentiation of 24 will still be even. So even if the exponent is 1, 24^1 is 24, which is even. So E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod10 is 6. Therefore, the units digit is 6?\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I need to check more carefully. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the exponent E is 24^(24^(...)) with 23 exponents. Let me see:\n\nLet me consider the tower of exponents. Let me denote the tower with k exponents as T(k). So T(1) =24, T(2)=24^24, T(3)=24^(24^24), etc. So the total exponent E is T(23). Then the total expression is 24^E = T(24).\n\nWe need to find T(24) mod10. Since T(24) =24^E mod10 =4^E mod10.

Therefore, T(23) is even. Thus, E is even. So 4^E mod10 is 6.\n\nHence, the units digit of 4$$ is 6.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check whether all exponents above are even.\n\nSuppose I have 24^anything: since 24 is even, any power of 24 is also even. Therefore, in the exponent tower, no matter how many exponents, as long as the base is even, the result is even. So E is 24^something, which is even. Therefore, E is even.\n\nTherefore, the exponent E is even. So 4^E mod10 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me test with smaller n to see if the same reasoning holds.\n\nSuppose n=1: 1! =1. Then 1$$=1, units digit 1.\n\nn=2: 2! =2. 2$$=2^2^2? Wait, no. Wait, n=2, so the tower has n! =2 exponents, both 2. So it's 2^2=4. So 2$$=4, units digit 4.\n\nUsing the same approach: 2! =2, so base is 2. The exponent is 2 (from n! =2). So is it 2^2=4. So yes, units digit 4.\n\nWait, but let me see if for n=3:\n\n3! =6.

So all exponents in the tower are even, so the total exponent E is even, so 4^E mod10 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 6. Hmm, but let me think again.\n\nWait, let me consider the tower step by step for n=4.\n\nLet me try to compute the tower step by step modulo 4 and modulo 2, but maybe that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the tower as follows:\n\nThe tower is 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 levels. The question is whether the exponent (the top 23 levels) is even or odd. Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so the exponent is even. Therefore, 4^even ends with 6. So the answer is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think of a smaller tower. Let's say the tower has 2 levels: 24^24. The exponent is 24, which is even, so 24^24 mod10 is 4^24 mod10. Since 24 is even, 4^24 mod10 is 6. So that's correct.\n\nIf the tower had 3 levels: 24^(24^24).
