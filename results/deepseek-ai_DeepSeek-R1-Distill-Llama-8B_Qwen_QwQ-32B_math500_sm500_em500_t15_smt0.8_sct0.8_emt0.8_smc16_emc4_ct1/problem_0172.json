            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with cube roots, the equation cube_root(some_expression) = something means that if I cube both sides, I can get rid of the cube root. So, maybe I should start by cubing both sides of the equation. That makes sense because cube and cube root are inverse operations, right?\n\nSo, the original equation is:\n\u221a\u00b3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nIf I cube both sides, I get:\n(\u221a\u00b3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4))\u00b3 = 16\u00b3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 16\u00b3\n\nNow, I need to calculate 16 cubed. Let me do that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16... Hmm, let's see. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. So, adding those together, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 16 * 16 is 256, yes. 256 * 16: 200*16=3200, 50*16=800, 6*16=96. So, 3200 + 800 is 4000, plus 96 is 4096. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\nHmm, okay. So, I can rewrite this equation as:\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\nx\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\nWait a second, is that right? Let me check the subtraction. 4 minus 4096 is indeed -4092. So, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Since it's a quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is:\nx = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / ("

Hmm, what's 4092*4? Let's calculate that. 4000*4=16,000, 92*4=368, so total is 16,368.\n\nTherefore, the discriminant (the part under the square root) is 16 + 16,368, which equals 16,384.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\nx = [4 \u00b1 \u221a16,384] / 2\n\nWait, I need to compute \u221a16,384. Let me see if I can figure that out. I know that 128 squared is 16,384 because 128*128: 120*120=14,400 and 8*128=1,024, so 14,400 + 1,024=15,424. Hmm, that's 128\u00b2=16,384. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 128 * 128: 100*100=10,000; 100*28=2,800; 28*100=2,800; 28*28=784. So adding all together: 10,000 + 2,800 + 2,800 + 784. 10,000 + 5,600 is 15,600, plus 784 is 16,384. Oh, okay, so \u221a16,384 is 128. So the square root simplifies to 128.\n\nSo now, plugging that back in:\nx = [4 \u00b1 128] / 2\n\nSo, I have two solutions:\n1. x = (4 + 128) / 2\n2. x"

So x\u00b2 -4x +4 =4096. Then x\u00b2 -4x = 4096 -4 =4092. So equation is x\u00b2 -4x -4092=0. Correct.\n\nQuadratic formula: a=1, b=-4, c=-4092.\n\nDiscriminant: b\u00b2 -4ac = 16 -4*(1)*(-4092) =16 +16,368=16,384. Right, square root of that is 128. So x=(4 \u00b1128)/2. So that gives 66 and -62. Positive solution is 66.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe plug it back into original equation.\n\nCompute cube_root(x\u00b2 -4x +4) for x=66.\n\nCompute x\u00b2: 66^2 is 4,356.\n\nCompute -4x: -4*66 is -264.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 -4x +4 is 4,356 -264 +4.\n\n4,356 -264: Let's subtract 264 from 4,356.\n\n4,356 -200 = 4,156\n\n4,156 -64 =4,092\n\nThen, add 4: 4,092 +4=4,096.\n\nCube root of 4,096. Now, 16^3 is 4,096. So cube_root(4,096) is 16. Which matches the original equation. So, yes, x=66 is indeed the solution.\n\nI think that's thorough. So, x=66 is the positive solution.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is solved by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root, resulting in a quadratic equation. Solving this quadratic using the quadratic formula yields two solutions, with the positive one being 66.\n\n\\boxed{66}"
