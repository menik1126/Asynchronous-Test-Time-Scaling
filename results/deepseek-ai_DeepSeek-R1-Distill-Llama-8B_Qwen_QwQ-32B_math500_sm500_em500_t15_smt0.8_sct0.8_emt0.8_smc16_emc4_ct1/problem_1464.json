The setup is that A is directly north of O, B is directly west of O, C is directly south of O, and D is directly east of O. So, if I imagine a coordinate system with O at the origin, A would be at (0, y), B at (-x, 0), C at (0, -y), and D at (x, 0), where x and y are positive distances. \n\nNow, the hot-air balloon is positioned at point H, which is directly above O. So, H would have the same x and y coordinates as O but at some height. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. The lengths of HC and HD are given as 150 meters and 130 meters respectively. \n\nThe problem says that to reduce the total length of ropes used, we can replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. The goal is to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the positions of all these points. Let me assign coordinates to make it clearer.\n\nLet’s set O at (0, 0). Then:\n- A is directly north of O, so A is at (0, a) where a is the distance north.\n- B is directly west of O, so B is at (-b, 0) where b is the distance west.\n- C is directly south of O, so C is at (0, -c) where c is the distance south.\n- D is directly east of O, so D is at (d, 0) where d is the distance east.\n\nBut actually, since A is north, C is south, B is west, and D is east, the coordinates should be:\n- A at (0, a)\n- B at (-b, 0)\n- C at (0, -c)\n- D at (d, 0)\n\nNow, H is directly above O, so H has coordinates (0, 0, h), where h is the height above the field.\n\nBut in the Asymptote code provided, it shows that A is at (1,1), B at (-1.5,0."

But in the problem, the distances are given as 140 m between C and D, so perhaps I can use that to find the distances between the points.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, points are plotted with O at (0,0), A at (1,1), which would mean A is northeast of O, but according to the problem, A is directly north of O. Similarly, D is at (1.5, -0.3), which is almost east but slightly south, which doesn't align with the problem statement. So perhaps the Asymptote code is just a rough drawing, and the exact positions can be determined based on the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between C and D is 140 m. So, if I set up O at (0,0), then:\n\n- A is (0, a)\n- B is (-b, 0)\n- C is (0, -c)\n- D is (d, 0)\n\nThen, the distance between C (0, -c) and D (d, 0) is sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2) = sqrt(d² + c²) = 140 m.\n\nSo, that gives me one equation: d² + c² = 140².\n\nNow, we have four ropes: HA, HB, HC, HD.\n\nHA is the rope from H to A, which is (0, a) to (0, 0, h).

Wait, no, HA is the rope from H to A, so both A and H are points in 3D space. Wait, but in the problem statement, all five points lie on a flat field, so they are all on the same plane (the ground).

But the problem is to find the greatest length of rope that can be saved, i.e., the maximum savings, which would correspond to the minimal possible HP.\n\nWait, but in our case, the current total for HC and HD is 150 + 130 = 280 m. If we can replace them with a single HP that's shorter than 280 m, then we save the difference. So, the maximum possible saving would be when HP is as short as possible, approaching zero, but HP cannot be shorter than the straight line from H to the line CD.\n\nWait, but in reality, we can’t have HP shorter than the minimal distance from H to CD. So, the minimal possible HP is the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD.
