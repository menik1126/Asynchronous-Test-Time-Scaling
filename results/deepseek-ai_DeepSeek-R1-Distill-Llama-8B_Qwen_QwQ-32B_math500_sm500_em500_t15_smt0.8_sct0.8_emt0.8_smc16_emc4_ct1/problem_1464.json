The ropes HA, HB, HC, and HD anchor the balloon at H.\n\nGiven that HC is 150 meters and HD is 130 meters, the total length of these two ropes is 280 meters. When replacing them with a single rope HP, we want to minimize the total rope length used.\n\nTo find the optimal point P on the line between C and D that minimizes the sum of HA, HB, HP, and HD, I'll consider the problem mathematically. \n\nLet me denote the coordinates:\n- O is at (0, 0).\n- A is at (0, a) where 'a' is the distance north of O.\n- B is at (-b, 0) where 'b' is the distance west of O.\n- C is at (-b, -a) directly south of B.\n- D is at (d, 0) directly east of O.\n- H is at (0, h) directly above O.\n\nSince the balloon is held in place by all four ropes, the lengths HA, HB, HC, and HD must satisfy certain conditions based on the Pythagorean theorem. Specifically, the horizontal distances from H to each anchor point squared plus the vertical distance squared must equal the square of the rope lengths.\n\nFor example, for rope HC:\n(-b)^2 + (-a - h)^2 = HC²\nBut since HC is 150 meters, this becomes:\nb² + (a + h)² = 150²\n\nSimilarly, for rope HD:\nd² + (h)² = 130²\n\nNow, when replacing HC and HD with a single rope HP, point P must lie somewhere along the line connecting C and D. The goal is to find the position of P such that the sum of the distances from H to P, HA, HB, and HD is minimized.\n\nThis is an optimization problem, and I recall that the shortest path involving reflections might be useful here. By reflecting point H across the line CD, we can find a straight-line path that represents the minimal total rope length.\n\nReflecting H across CD gives a new point H'. The minimal path from H to P to H' would correspond to the straight line between H and H', intersecting CD at"

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since P is on CD, and we need to find the shortest HP, but actually, the problem wants to replace the two ropes HC and HD with HP, so the total rope length saved would be (HC + HD) - HP. To maximize the saving, we need to minimize HP as much as possible. The minimal HP would be the distance from H to the line CD, but since P has to be on CD, the shortest distance is indeed the perpendicular distance. So, if the balloon is at H, the closest point P on CD would give the minimal HP, which is the perpendicular distance. Then the maximum saving would be (150 + 130) - perpendicular distance.\n\nWait, but does this account for the actual positions? Let me try to formalize this.\n\nFirst, let's establish coordinates. Let’s set O as (0,0). Let me first try to find the coordinates of C and D.\n\nWait, the distance between C and D is given as 140 meters. Let me note that.\n\nC is directly south of O, so coordinates (0, -y_C). Wait, but B is west, A is north, D is east of O.

But the problem states that the distance between C and D is 140 m.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"distance between C and D is 140m\". So CD is sqrt( (x - (-x))² + (0 - (-y))² )?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe coordinates need to be better established.\n\nLet me re-define coordinates more precisely.\n\nSince O is the origin.\n\nLet me set coordinates such that:\n\n- A is (0, a) (north of O)\n\n-"

    "question": "Five points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $O$ lie on a flat field.  $A$ is directly north of $O$, $B$ is directly west of $O$, $C$ is directly south of $O$, and $D$ is directly east of $O$. The  distance between $C$ and $D$ is 140 m.  A hot-air balloon is positioned in the air at $H$ directly above $O$. The balloon is held in place by four ropes $HA$, $HB$, $HC$, and $HD$.  Rope $HC$ has length 150 m and rope $HD$ has length 130 m.
