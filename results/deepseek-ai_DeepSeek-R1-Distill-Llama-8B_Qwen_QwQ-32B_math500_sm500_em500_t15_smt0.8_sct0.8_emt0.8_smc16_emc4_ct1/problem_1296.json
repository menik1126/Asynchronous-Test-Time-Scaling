            "output": "I begin by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions. This gives me 2 times (x - 5) equals 3 times 4.\n\nNext, I simplify both sides of the equation to further isolate x. This results in 2x minus 10 equals 12.\n\nThen, I add 10 to both sides to move the constant term. This gives me 2x equals 22.\n\nAfter that, I divide both sides by 2 to solve for x, which gives me x equals 11.\n\nFinally, I verify the solution by substituting x back into the original equation to ensure it holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x - 5}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiply**:  \n   \\[\n   2 \\times (x - 5) = 3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2(x - 5) = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distribute the 2**:  \n   \\[\n   2x - 10 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add 10 to both sides**:  \n   \\[\n   2x = 22\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide both sides by 2**:  \n   \\[\n   x = 11\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:  \n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
