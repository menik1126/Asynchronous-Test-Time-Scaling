The sequence starts with 0, and then alternates between adding and multiplying by successive integers starting from 1.\n\nLet me list out the initial terms to observe the pattern:\n- Term 1: 0\n- Term 2: 0 + 1 = 1\n- Term 3: 1 * 1 = 1\n- Term 4: 1 + 2 = 3\n- Term 5: 3 * 2 = 6\n- Term 6: 6 + 3 = 9\n- Term 7: 9 * 3 = 27\n\nContinuing this pattern, I can generate more terms to see when the first term exceeds 125.\n\nTerm 8: 27 + 4 = 31  \nTerm 9: 31 * 4 = 124  \nTerm 10: 124 + 5 = 129  \n\nNow, comparing 129 to 125, it is greater. Therefore, the first term that exceeds 125 is 129.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step-by-step to determine the first term that exceeds 125.\n\n### Understanding the Sequence\n1. **Initial Term**: The sequence starts with the first term \\( a_1 = 0 \\).\n2. **Operations**:\n   - **Add**: Starting from the first term, alternately add and multiply by successive integers.\n   - **Multiplication**: The second operation is multiplication by the next integer.\n\n### Generating the Sequence\nLet's generate the terms one by one:\n\n| Term | Operation | Value |\n|------|-----------|-------|\n| 1    | Start     | 0     |\n| 2    | Add 1     | 0 + 1 = 1 |\n| 3    | Multiply by 1 | 1 * 1 = 1 |\n| 4    | Add 2     | 1 + 2 = 3 |\n| 5    | Multiply by 2 | 3 * 2 = 6 |\n| 6    | Add 3     | 6 + 3 = 9 |\n| 7    | Multiply by 3 | 9 * 3 = 27 |\n| 8    | Add 4     | 27 + 4 = 31 |\n| 9    | Multiply by 4 | "

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
