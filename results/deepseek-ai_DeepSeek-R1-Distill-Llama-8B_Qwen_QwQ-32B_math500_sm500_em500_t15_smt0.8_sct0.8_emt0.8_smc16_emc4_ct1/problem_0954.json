Dividing the coefficients, 40 \u00f7 8 equals 5.\n\nThen, for the variables, r\u2079 divided by r\u2074 is r\u2075.\n\nCombining these results, the simplified expression is 5r\u2075.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators:**\n   \\[\n   10r^3 \\times 4r^6 = 40r^{3+6} = 40r^9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40r^9}{8r^4} = 5r^{9-4} = 5r^5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{5r^5}\n   \\]"
