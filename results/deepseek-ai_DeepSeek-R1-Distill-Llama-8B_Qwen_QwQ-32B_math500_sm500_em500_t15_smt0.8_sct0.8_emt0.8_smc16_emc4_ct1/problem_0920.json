            "output": "To find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers with a product of 84, I should start by factoring 84 into its prime components.\n\nFirst, 84 divided by 2 is 42. Dividing 42 by 2 again gives 21. Then, dividing 21 by 3 results in 7, and finally, 7 is a prime number. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7.\n\nNext, I need to combine these prime factors into distinct integers greater than 1. The smallest possible integers are 2, 3, and 7. Multiplying these together gives 2 × 3 × 7 = 42, which is less than 84. To reach the product of 84, I can include the additional factor of 2, making the set {2, 3, 7, 2}.\n\nHowever, the integers must be distinct, so I cannot have duplicate factors. Therefore, I should aim for the smallest possible integers without repeating any. By using 2, 3, and 7, the product is 42, which is less than 84. To reach the target product, I'll include another prime factor, which is 2, resulting in the set {2, 3, 7, 2}. Since duplicates are not allowed, I need to find a way to include all prime factors without repeating.\n\nOne solution is to break one of the numbers into smaller integers. For example, I can replace 2 with 4, making the set {2, 3, 4, 7}. The product is now 2 × 3 × 4 × 7 = 168, which exceeds the desired product of 84. To adjust, I can remove one of the larger factors and replace it with a smaller one. Removing 4 and including 2 gives the set {2, 3, 7, 2}, but this still has duplicates.\n\nTo avoid duplication, I'll consider using the prime factors directly. The set {2, 3, 7} gives a product of 42, which is less than 84. To increase the product, I can replace one of these numbers with a larger integer while keeping the sum as low as possible. Replacing 3 with 6 gives the set {2, 6, 7}, resulting in a"

The sum here is 3 + 4 + 7 = 14, which is better.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3 × 4 × 7 is indeed 84, and the sum is 14. That's better than 15. Is there a way to get an even lower sum?\n\nAnother possibility is using four numbers. Let's see. The prime factors are 2, 2, 3, 7. To make them distinct, we can combine the two 2s into a 4. So, {3, 4, 7} gives the product 84 with a sum of 14. Alternatively, using four numbers: {2, 3, 2, 7} is invalid due to duplicates. If I use {2, 3, 7, 2}, same problem. To make four distinct numbers, perhaps {1, 2, 3, 14}? Let's check the product: 1×2×3×14 = 84. The sum is 1+2+3+14 = 20, which is higher than 14. Not better.\n\nAnother four-number set: {1, 2, 6, 7} gives product 1×2×6×7 = 84. The sum is 1+2+6+7 = 16, still higher than 14.\n\nAlternatively, {1, 3, 4, 7} gives 1×3×4×7 = 84, sum is 1+3+4+7 = 15. Still higher.\n\nWhat about three numbers? The set {3, 4, 7} gives sum 14. Another three-number set: {2, 6, 7} gives sum 15. So 14 is better.\n\nIs there a three-number set with a lower sum?

To make four distinct numbers, perhaps combine the two 2s into a 4, so 4,3,7, and then we need another number. Wait, but 4×3×7=84, so that's three numbers. To make four numbers, we need to split one of them into smaller factors. For example, split 4 into 2 and 2, but that brings back duplicates. Alternatively, split 3 into 1 and 3, but then 1 is allowed. So {1,2,2,21} but duplicates again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, split 7 into 1 and 7, but that gives {1,2,3, 2×7=14} again duplicates? Wait, 2 is already there. So 1,2,3,14. Which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split the factors differently. Let's see, 2×3=6, so 6, 2,7. That's three numbers.

But wait, 3×4=12, 12×7=84. Yes, correct. Sum is 3+4+7=14.\n\nIs there a better set? For example, using 2,6,7: 2×6×7=84, sum 15.
