Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem properly.\n\nFirst, I know that 84 is the product of these integers. I need to find distinct positive integers, meaning each number in the set has to be different and greater than zero. The goal is to have the smallest possible sum. So, I should probably use numbers that are as small as possible, right? But I also need to make sure that their product is exactly 84, not less or more.\n\nLet me think about the factors of 84. 84 can be factored into primes as 2 * 2 * 3 * 7. So, that's 2\u00b2 * 3 * 7. Now, I need to break this down into distinct integers. Since I want the minimal sum, I should try to use the smallest possible numbers. \n\nStarting with the smallest, let's try 1. If I include 1, that doesn't affect the product because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the number. So, including 1 might help me use smaller numbers elsewhere. \n\nWait, but 1 is already a positive integer, so that's allowed. So, let's see. If I have 1, then I need the product of the remaining numbers to be 84. So, the remaining numbers should multiply to 84, and they also need to be distinct and greater than 1. \n\nHmm, maybe I can break 84 into smaller factors. Let's list all the factors of 84:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84.\n\nSince I want distinct integers, I need to pick a combination of these that multiply to 84 and use as few numbers as possible because fewer numbers might lead to a smaller sum. Wait, actually, more numbers could allow me to use smaller factors, which might lower the total sum. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, actually, if I use more numbers, each will be smaller, but the sum might be larger or smaller depending on the distribution. Maybe I should aim for the fewest number of integers possible because using more numbers would require more smaller integers, but the sum might still be higher. Let me try both approaches.\n\nFirst,"

Since there are two 2s, which are duplicates, so that's not allowed. So, maybe combine some of them. For example, 2*2=4, so then the factors would be 4, 3, 7. That's three numbers, all distinct. Their product is 4*3*7=84. The sum would be 4+3+7=14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination. Let's see, 2, 3, and 14. 2*3*14=84. The sum is 2+3+14=19, which is higher. Not better. \n\nOr 2, 6, 7. 2*6*7=84. Sum is 2+6+7=15. That's better than 19 but worse than 14. \n\nWait, so the first combination (4,3,7) gives 14. \n\nAlternatively, if I use four numbers. Let's see. Let's try to split the factors into more numbers. For example, 1, 2, 3, 14. The product is 1*2*3*14=84. The sum is 1+2+3+14=20. That's worse. \n\nAlternatively, 1, 2, 6, 7.

So, maybe 1 isn't helpful here.\n\nWait, let me go back. So, using the minimal number of integers seems better because the sum is 14, which is lower than when I use more numbers. Maybe 3 numbers is better.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can have fewer than 3 numbers. Let's see, 84 as a product of two numbers. So, factors of 84 are:\n\n1 and 84 (sum 85), 2 and 42 (sum 44), 3 and 28 (sum 31), 4 and 21 (sum 25), 6 and 14 (sum 20), 7 and 12 (sum 19). So, the minimal sum for two numbers is 19 (7 and 12). That's worse than 14.\n\nSo, three numbers give me a sum of 14, which is better than two numbers.\n\nIs there a way to get even fewer numbers? Well, no, because the minimal number of integers is 1, but 84 itself is 84, sum is 84, which is way higher than 14. So, three numbers seem better.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I can get a lower sum by using more numbers but appropriate factors. For example, can I have four numbers, each as small as possible, whose product is 84?\n\nLet me see. Let's try to break down 84 into four distinct positive integers. So, starting with the smallest possible, which is 1, 2, 3, and something. So, 1*2*3*x=84 \u21d2 x=14.
