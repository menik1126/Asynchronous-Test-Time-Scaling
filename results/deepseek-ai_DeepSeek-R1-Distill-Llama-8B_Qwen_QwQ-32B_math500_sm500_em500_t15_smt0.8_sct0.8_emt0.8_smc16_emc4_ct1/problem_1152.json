Applying this to the left side, I get 3^{k*6} = 3^6.\n\nSince the bases are the same and the equation is equal, the exponents must be equal as well. Therefore, 6k = 6.\n\nFinally, solving for k by dividing both sides by 6, I find that k = 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\) in the equation \\( (3^k)^6 = 3^6 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the power of a power property**:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{k \\times 6} = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the exponents equal**:\n   Since the bases are the same and the expressions are equal, the exponents must be equal.\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
