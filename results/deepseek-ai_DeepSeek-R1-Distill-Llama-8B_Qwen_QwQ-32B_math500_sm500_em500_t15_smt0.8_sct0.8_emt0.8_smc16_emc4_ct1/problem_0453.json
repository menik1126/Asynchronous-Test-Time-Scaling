Hmm, okay, let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down what I know. The expression I need to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Let me expand that to see if it can be simplified or expressed in a more manageable form. Multiplying it out, I get:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem immediately helpful. Maybe I should think about how to utilize the given condition \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). Since I have a product of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and their sum, perhaps some inequality might come into play here, like the AM-GM inequality.\n\nI remember that the AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So maybe if I can express the given condition or the target expression in terms that allow me to apply AM-GM, that could help.\n\nLet me denote \\(S = x + y + z\\). Then the given condition is \\(xyzS = 1\\). So, \\(xyz = \\frac{1}{S}\\). Hmm, maybe I can express the target expression in terms of \\(S\\) and \\(xyz\\).\n\nLooking at \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), maybe I can factor out \\(y\\) to get \\(y(x + y + z)\\). Wait, that's \\(yS\\). Interesting, so:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + yz = yS + yz\n\\]\n\nWait, no, let me double-check that. If I expand \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) again, it should be \\(xy + y^2 + yz + xz\\). So, factoring isn't straightforward. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider using substitution to reduce the number of variables. Since \\(xyzS = 1\\"

Hmm, that might not be straightforward to solve for a variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such that symmetry can be exploited. Since the expression to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), it seems symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) when paired with \\(y\\). Maybe assuming some symmetry between these variables?\n\nLet me think: if the problem is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) in some way, perhaps the minimum occurs when \\(x = z\\). Let me test that assumption.\n\nSuppose \\(x = z\\). Then let me denote \\(x = z = a\\), so the variables become \\(a\\), \\(y\\), \\(a\\). Then the condition becomes:\n\n\\( a \\cdot y \\cdot a \\cdot (a + y + a) = 1 \\)\n\nSimplify this:\n\n\\( a^2 y (2a + y) = 1 \\)\n\nAnd the expression to minimize is:\n\n\\( (x + y)(y + z) = (a + y)(y + a) = (a + y)^2 \\)\n\nSo, we need to minimize \\((a + y)^2\\) given that \\( a^2 y (2a + y) = 1 \\). Hmm, maybe this substitution can lead somewhere. Let me denote \\(b = a + y\\), but not sure yet. Alternatively, set variables to make it easier. Let me consider setting \\(a = y\\), perhaps? Wait, but that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use substitution in terms of variables that can apply AM-GM. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) in terms of \\(S\\) and maybe other terms. Let me see.\n\nLet me note that \\((x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz = yS + xz\\). Since \\(S = x + y + z\\), that's an expression. Hmm, so \\( (x + y)(y + z) = yS + xz \\). Then, given the"

Hmm, perhaps I should check if this is indeed the minimal value without the substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is indeed the minimal value because when I set \\(x = z\\), the minimal value is found, and due to symmetry, it's likely the global minimum.\n\nBut let me think if there could be a lower value without that substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the target expression \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Let me denote this as \\(E = (x + y)(y + z)\\). Let me try to express \\(E\\) in terms of other variables.\n\nSince \\(S = x + y + z\\), let me note that \\(E = y(x + y + z) + xz = y S + xz\\), as I did before.\n\nGiven that \\(xyz S = 1\\), which is \\(xyz = \\frac{1}{S}\\).\n\nSo, \\(E = y S + xz\\). Let me see if I can express \\(xz\\) in terms of other variables.\n\nFrom the condition, \\(xyz = \\frac{1}{S}\\), so \\(x z = \\frac{1}{y S}\\). Therefore,\n\n\\(E = y S + \\frac{1}{y S}\\)\n\nSo, \\(E = y S + \\frac{1}{y S}\\).\n\nHmm, that's a function in terms of \\(y S\\). Let me set \\(t = y S\\). Then, \\(E = t + \\frac{"

Therefore, the minimal value of \\(E\\) is 2, provided that \\(t = 1\\) is achievable under the given constraints.\n\nWait, this is a much simpler approach! Let me verify this.\n\nSo, if I can set \\(y S = 1\\), then \\(E = 2\\). But is this possible?\n\nGiven that \\(xyz S = 1\\), and \\(xz = \\frac{1}{y S}\\), so if \\(y S = 1\\), then \\(xz = 1/(1) = 1\\). So, \\(xz = 1\\), and \\(y S = 1\\). Let me see if there exist positive real numbers \\(x, y, z\\) such that \\(xz = 1\\), \\(y S = 1\\), and \\(xyz S = 1\\).\n\nWait, substituting \\(xz = 1\\) and \\(y S = 1\\) into the original condition:\n\n\\(xyz S = (x z) y S = (1)(y S) = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\), which satisfies the condition. So, yes, it is possible. Therefore, the minimal value is indeed 2, achieved when \\(y S = 1\\) and \\(xz = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimal value is 2. But in my previous approach with substitution \\(x = z\\), I also arrived at the same value, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value is 2. But let me check with another method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, using AM-GM inequality on \\(E = (x + y)(y + z)\\). Let me see.\n\nLet me consider variables \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\). Let me denote \\(a = x + y\\), \\(b = y + z\\). Then, \\(E = ab\\). We need to minimize \\(ab\\) given that \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\).\n\nBut perhaps express \\(x + y + z = (x + y) + z = a + z\\), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively"

Alternatively, maybe using Holder's inequality?\n\nAlternatively, note that \\(E = (x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz = y S + xz\\).
