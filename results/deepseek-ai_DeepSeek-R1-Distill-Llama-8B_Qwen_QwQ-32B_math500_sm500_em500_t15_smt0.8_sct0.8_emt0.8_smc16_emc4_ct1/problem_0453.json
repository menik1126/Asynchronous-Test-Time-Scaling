Hmm, okay, let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, the expression I need to minimize is (x + y)(y + z). Maybe I can expand this to make it easier to work with. Let me try that.\n\nExpanding (x + y)(y + z), I get:\nx*y + x*z + y*y + y*z = xy + xz + y² + yz.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe there's a better way to handle this. I remember that sometimes when dealing with products like this, it helps to apply some inequality principles, like AM-GM inequality. But I'm not exactly sure how to apply it here directly.\n\nWait, the condition given is xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Maybe I can relate this to the expression I need to minimize. Let me write that condition down again: xyz(x + y + z) = 1.\n\nSo, xyz times the sum of x, y, z equals 1. I need to connect this to (x + y)(y + z). Maybe I can express (x + y)(y + z) in terms of other variables or relate it to the given condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use substitution to reduce the number of variables. Let me try setting some variables equal to each other to simplify the problem, assuming symmetry might lead me somewhere.\n\nWait, but the expression (x + y)(y + z) isn't symmetric in x, z because only x and z are added to y, but not both to y. Hmm, so maybe symmetry isn't the way to go here. Maybe I should try a substitution where I set a = x + y, b = y + z, and see if I can express the condition in terms of a and b.\n\nBut before that, let me think about the degrees of the variables in both the condition and the expression to minimize. The given condition has three variables x, y, z each to the first power, and one of them is also summed. So it's like a product of a term linear in each variable and a linear term.\n\nThe expression (x + y)(y + z"

That is, express the expression in terms of the given condition so that I can apply inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers here since it's an optimization problem with a constraint. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me recall that with Lagrange multipliers, I can set up the function to minimize as f(x, y, z) = (x + y)(y + z), and the constraint is g(x, y, z) = xyz(x + y + z) - 1 = 0.\n\nThe method says that the gradient of f should be proportional to the gradient of g at the minimum point. So, compute the partial derivatives.\n\nFirst, compute the partial derivatives of f:\n\nf = (x + y)(y + z) = xy + y² + yz + xz.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to x:\ndf/dx = y + z.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to y:\ndf/dy = (x + y)'(y + z) + (x + y)(y + z)' \nWait, actually, better to compute directly:\n\ndf/dy = (x + y)'(y + z) + (x + y)*(y + z)' \nWait, no, actually, since f = (x + y)(y + z), then:\n\ndf/dy = (1)(y + z) + (x + y)(1) = (y + z) + (x + y) = x + 2y + z.\n\nSimilarly, partial derivative with respect to z:\ndf/dz = (x + y)*(1) = x + y.\n\nNow, the gradient of f is (y + z, x + 2y + z, x + y).\n\nNow, compute the gradient of g, where g = xyz(x + y + z) - 1.\n\nFirst, let me write g = xyzS - 1, where S = x + y + z.\n\nSo, compute partial derivatives:\n\ndg/dx = yzS + xyz*(1) = yz(x + y + z) + xyz = yzS + xyz = yz(S + x) = yz(x + y + z + x) = yz(2x + y + z).\n\nWait, maybe better to compute step by step:\n\ng = xyz(x + y + z)."

Alternatively, factor out xyz:\n\nLooking at dg/dx: yz(S + x) = yz(x + y + z + x) = yz(2x + y + z).\n\nHmm, but maybe a better approach is to set the gradient of f equal to λ times the gradient of g.\n\nSo, from Lagrange multipliers, ∇f = λ∇g.\n\nThat gives us the following equations:\n\n1) y + z = λ(yzS + xyz)\n2) x + 2y + z = λ(xzS + xyz)\n3) x + y = λ(xyS + xyz)\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy.
