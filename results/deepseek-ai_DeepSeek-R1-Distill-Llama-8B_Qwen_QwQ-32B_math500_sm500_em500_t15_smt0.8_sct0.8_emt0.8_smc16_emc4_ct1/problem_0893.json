            "output": "To convert the fraction 57/160 to a terminating decimal, I first need to determine the prime factors of the denominator.\n\nI'll start by breaking down 160. Dividing by 2 gives 80, and dividing by 2 again gives 40. Continuing this process, I find that 160 is equal to 2 raised to the seventh power (2^7).\n\nSince the denominator\u2019s prime factorization only contains 2s, I can now convert the fraction by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to make the denominator a power of 10.\n\nMultiplying 57 by 5 gives 285, and multiplying 160 by 5 gives 800. This changes the fraction to 285/800.\n\nFinally, I'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to simplify the fraction further. Dividing 285 by 5 gives 57, and dividing 800 by 5 gives 160. This simplifies to 57/160, which is the same as the original fraction. However, since the denominator is now 160, which is a power of 10, I know that dividing 57 by 160 will result in a terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is 160.\n   - Factorize 160:\n     \\[\n     160 \\div 2 = 80 \\\\\n     80 \\div 2 = 40 \\\\\n     40 \\div 2 = 20 \\\\\n     20 \\div 2 = 10 \\\\\n     10 \\div 2 = 5 \\\\\n     \\]\n   - So, \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n2. **Convert the Fraction to Have a Denominator of 10^n:**\n   - Since the denominator has both 2s and 5s, you can make it a power of 10 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the 5 in the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57 \\times 5}{160 \\times 5} = \\frac{285}{800}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     800 = 2^5 \\times 5^2\n     \\]\n   - However,"
