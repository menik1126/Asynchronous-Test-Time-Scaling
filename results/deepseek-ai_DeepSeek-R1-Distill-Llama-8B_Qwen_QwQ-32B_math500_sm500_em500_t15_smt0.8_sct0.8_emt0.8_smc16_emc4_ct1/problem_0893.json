The prime factors of 57 are 3 and 19, while the prime factors of 160 are 2 raised to the 5th power and 5 raised to the 1st power.\n\nNext, I'll identify the highest power of 2 and 5 from the prime factors. In this case, the highest power of 2 is \\(2^5\\) and the highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\).\n\nFinally, I'll multiply these highest powers together to find the least common multiple of the denominators. Multiplying \\(2^5\\) by \\(5^1\\) gives me 160, which is also the denominator of the original fraction.\n\nSince the denominator of the fraction is already equal to the least common multiple, the fraction can be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize the numerator and denominator** to determine their prime factors.\n\n   - **Numerator (57):**\n     \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\)\n   \n   - **Denominator (160):**\n     \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\\)\n\n2. **Identify the highest power of 2 and 5** from the prime factors of the denominator:\n   \n   - The highest power of 2 is \\(2^5\\).\n   - The highest power of 5 is \\(5^1\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the least common multiple (LCM)** of the denominator by multiplying these highest powers:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM of denominator} = 2^5 \\times 5^1 = 32 \\times 5 = 160\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express the fraction with the LCM as the denominator**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57}{160}\n   \\]\n\nSince the denominator is already a power of 10 (specifically, \\(10^1 = 10\\)), the fraction can be written as a terminating decimal without further conversion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n"
