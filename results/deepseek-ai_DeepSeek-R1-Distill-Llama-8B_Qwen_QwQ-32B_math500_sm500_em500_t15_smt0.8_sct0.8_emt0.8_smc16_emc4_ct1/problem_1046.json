            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial: 2x⁴ + a₃x³ + a₂x² + a₁x + 1 = 0. It's a quartic polynomial with integer coefficients. I need to find the number of different possible rational roots it could have. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nI remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. I think it helps in determining the possible rational roots of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Let me recall what it says. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms as p/q, must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nAlright, so in this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. That means p, the numerator of the rational root, must be a factor of 1, and q, the denominator, must be a factor of 2.\n\nFactors of 1 are just ±1, right? Because 1 only has two factors, itself and -1. And factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. So, possible values for p are ±1, and possible values for q are ±1, ±2.\n\nNow, the possible rational roots would be p divided by q. So let's list all combinations.\n\nStarting with p = 1:\n- 1/1 = 1\n- 1/-1 = -1\n- 1/2\n- 1/-2 = -1/2\n\nThen p = -1:\n- -1/1 = -1\n- -1/-1 = 1\n- -1/2 = -1/2\n- -1/-2 = 1/2\n\nWait, so when p is -1 and q is -2, we get 1/2, which we already have from the first p=1, q=2. Similarly, p=-1 and q=-1 gives -1, which we already have from p=1, q=-1.\n\nSo, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2.\n\nBut wait, are all these distinct? Let's see:\n\n1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nYes, each is unique. So that's four possible rational roots.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something? Let me think again. The constant term is 1, so"

            "output": " p can only be 1 or -1. The leading coefficient is 2, so q can be 1, -1, 2, or -2. When I list all the combinations, simplifying them gives exactly those four.\n\nBut let me be careful. The Rational Root Theorem states that all possible rational roots are of the form ±(factor of constant term)/(factor of leading coefficient). Since the constant term's factors are only ±1, and leading coefficient's factors are ±1, ±2, the possibilities are indeed ±1, ±1/2.\n\nSo, even though the polynomial has other coefficients like a₃, a₂, a₁, which are integers, their specific values can't restrict the possible rational roots further? Wait, actually, maybe not. The question is asking for all the possible rational roots that the polynomial could have, given that a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers. So, it's about the possible values that a rational root could take for some integers a₃, a₂, a₁.\n\nWait a second, so maybe not all of these four are possible? Because depending on the coefficients, maybe some of these roots might not be achievable? For example, maybe for some roots, there's no integer coefficients possible to make the equation hold?\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Let me think. The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots that the polynomial can have. So the answer is the number of possible distinct candidates that can actually be roots for some choice of integers a₃, a₂, a₁. Because theoretically, the Rational Root Theorem gives the possible candidates, but not all of them might actually be achievable for this form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all four are possible. Let's see. Let's try each candidate and see if there exist integer coefficients that would make the polynomial have that root.\n\nStarting with root 1. If 1 is a root, plugging into the equation:\n\n2(1)^4 + a₃(1)^3 + a₂(1)^2 + a₁(1) + 1 = 0\n\nThat gives 2 + a₃ + a₂ + a₁ +1 = 0 → a₃ + a₂ + a₁ = -3. Since a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, there are definitely integers that satisfy this equation.\n\nSimilarly, for root -1:\n\n2"

Again, integers can satisfy this.\n\nNow for 1/2: plug x = 1/2 into the polynomial.\n\n2*(1/2)^4 + a₃*(1/2)^3 + a₂*(1/2)^2 + a₁*(1/2) + 1 = 0\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\na₃*(1/8)\na₂*(1/4)\na₁*(1/2)\n+1 = 1\n\nSo, adding these up:\n\n1/8 + (a₃)/8 + (a₂)/4 + a₁/2 +1 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ +8 = 0 → (a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁) = -9\n\nSo, we have a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ = -9. Are there integers a₃, a₂, a₁ that satisfy this? Yes, for example, a₃= -1, a₂=0, a₁=1. Then, -1 + 0 + 4(1) = 3 ≠ -9. Hmm, let me try another one. a₃= -5, a₂=1, a₁=1. Then, -5 + 2(1) +4(1)= -5 +2 +4=1. Still not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a₃= -9, a₂=0, a₁=0. That gives -9 +0 +0 =-9. Perfect. So, choose a₃=-9, a₂=0, a₁=0. Then the polynomial becomes 2x⁴ -9x³ +0x² +0x +1=2x⁴ -9x³ +1. Plugging x=1"

Let's see. Let me choose a₃=9, a₂=0, a₁=0. Then 9 -0 +0=9. So, plug into the polynomial:2x⁴ +9x³ +0x² +0x +1=2x⁴ +9x³ +1.

Therefore, all four are possible. Thus, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nWait, but hold on. The question is about possible rational roots. So, even though for each possible rational root, we can find some integer coefficients that make it a root, the question is about the possible ones for this"

So, yeah, 4.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no mistake. Maybe some roots might not be achievable despite the theorem. Let me consider again.\n\nWait, take x=1 and x=-1. For x=1, plugging into the polynomial:\n\n2 + a₃ +a₂ +a₁ +1=0 → a₃ +a₂ +a₁= -3. So, for example, set a₃=0, a₂=0, then a₁=-3. So the polynomial becomes 2x⁴ -3x +1. Plugging in x=1: 2 -3 +1=0. So, works.\n\nSimilarly, for x=-1: 2*(-1)^4 +a₃*(-1)^3 +a₂*(-1)^2 +a₁*(-1) +1=2 -a₃ +a₂ -a₁ +1=3 - (a₃ + a₂ + a₁)=0 → a₃ + a₂ + a₁=3. So, choose a₃=0, a₂=0, a₁=3. Then polynomial is 2x⁴ +3x +1.
