            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial equation: 2x⁴ + a₃x³ + a₂x² + a₁x + 1 = 0. It's a quartic polynomial with integer coefficients. The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial.\n\nHmm, I remember something called the Rational Root Theorem. I think it helps in finding the possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Let me try to recall how it works.\n\nFrom what I remember, the Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational solution, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients must satisfy that p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. So, applying the theorem here, p must be a factor of 1, and q must be a factor of 2.\n\nThe factors of 1 are just ±1 because 1 only has two divisors: 1 and -1. The factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2 since 2 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the possible values for p are 1 and -1, and the possible values for q are 1, -1, 2, and -2. Now, to get all possible rational roots, we have to consider all possible combinations of p and q.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. When p = 1:\n   - q = 1: 1/1 = 1\n   - q = -1: 1/(-1) = -1\n   - q = 2: 1/2\n   - q = -2: 1/(-2) = -1/2\n\n2. When p = -1:\n   - q = 1: -1/1 = -1\n   - q = -1: -1/(-1) = 1\n   - q = 2: -1/2\n   - q = -2: -1/(-2) = 1/2\n\nNow, let's combine all these possibilities and see which ones are unique. From the above, the possible rational roots are: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2, -1/2, 1/2, 1, and -1."

            "output": " But many of these are duplicates.\n\nLooking at them, 1 and -1 appear twice because both p = 1 and p = -1 with q = 1 and q = -1 give these results. Similarly, 1/2 and -1/2 also appear twice because p = 1 and p = -1 with q = 2 and -2 give these. So, the unique possible rational roots are 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2.\n\nWait, but that seems like four different possible rational roots. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe factors of the constant term 1 are indeed ±1, and the factors of the leading coefficient 2 are ±1, ±2. So, all possible p/q are ±1, ±1/2. That's 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. So, four in total.\n\nIs there any other possibility? For example, could there be any other fractions or integers that I'm missing? Let's think. Since 1 is the constant term, the only possible integer roots would be ±1, and from the leading term, the denominator could be 1 or 2, so the fractions would be ±1, ±1/2.\n\nYes, that seems comprehensive. So, the possible rational roots are 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2. That makes four distinct possible rational roots.\n\nWait, another thought—could any of these be duplicates? Let me check:\n\n- 1 is unique\n- -1 is unique\n- 1/2 and -1/2 are also unique\n\nSo yes, each of these is a different rational number. So, the number of different possible rational roots is four.\n\nI should also recall that the Rational Root Theorem gives all possible candidates, but they might not all be actual roots of the polynomial. The question is asking for possible rational roots, not necessarily which ones actually satisfy the equation. So, regardless of whether they are roots, they are possible candidates.\n\nSo, yeah, the answer is four.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial is of the form \\(2x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + 1 = 0\\) with integer coefficients. Using the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided"
