The prime factors of 160 are 2^5 * 5^1.\n\nSince 57 and 160 are coprime, I can ignore the numerator and focus on simplifying the denominator.\n\nNext, I'll express the fraction with a denominator that is a power of 10 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the same factor that will eliminate the existing factors of 2 and 5.\n\nTo achieve this, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2^(5-1) = 16, and then by 5^(1-1) = 1.\n\nAfter these multiplications, the denominator becomes 160 * 16 * 1 = 2560, which is a power of 10.\n\nFinally, I'll perform the division to find the decimal equivalent of the fraction.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand Terminating Decimals\nA fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will convert to a terminating decimal if the denominator \\(b\\) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. This is because the decimal system is base 10, which is \\(2 \\times 5\\).\n\n### Step 2: Factor the Denominator\nFactor the denominator \\(160\\) into its prime components:\n\\[\n160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^5 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^6 \\times 5\n\\]\nSo, \\(160\\) has only the prime factors 2 and 5, which means the decimal will terminate.\n\n### Step 3: Convert to a Power of 10\nTo convert the denominator to a power of 10, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number until the denominator becomes a power of 10. Specifically, we want to eliminate the factors of 2 and 5 by multiplying by their complements.\n\nSince the denominator has \\(2^6 \\times 5^1\\), multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^{6-1} \\times 5^{1-1} = 2^5 \\times 1 = 32\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{"

Let me correct this step.\n\nActually, to make the denominator a power of 10, we need to balance the exponents of 2 and 5. The denominator \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\\). To make it \\(10^n\\), we need equal exponents of 2 and 5. The maximum exponent between 5 (for 2) and 1 (for 5) is 5. So, we need to multiply by \\(5^{5-1} = 5^4\\) to get \\(5^5\\), but that would make the denominator \\(2^5 \\times 5^5 = 10^5\\). Alternatively, since the current exponents are 2^5 and 5^1, we need to multiply by 5^(5-1) = 5^4? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the denominator is 2^5 * 5^1. To make it 10^n, we need to have equal exponents of 2 and 5. The current exponents are 5 (for 2) and 1 (for 5). To make them equal, we can multiply by 5^(5-1) = 5^4? Wait, no. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me recall the correct method. To convert the denominator to a power of 10, we need to have the denominator as 10^k = 2^k * 5^k. The current denominator is 2^5 * 5^1. To make it 2^k *5^k, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 5^(k-1) and 2^(k-5). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the smallest k such that 10^k is divisible by 160. \n\nAlternatively, the standard method is to adjust the denominator to have exponents of 2 and 5 equal. Let me see:\n\nThe denominator is 2^5 *5^1. To make it 10^5 (since the exponent of 2 is higher), we need to"
