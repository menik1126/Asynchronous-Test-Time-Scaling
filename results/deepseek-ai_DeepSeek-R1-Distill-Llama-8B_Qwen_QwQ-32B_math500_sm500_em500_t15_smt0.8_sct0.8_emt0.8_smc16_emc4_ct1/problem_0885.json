This means the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Express the Denominator as \\(10^n\\)**:\n   - To convert a fraction to a terminating decimal, the denominator must be a power of 10.\n   - Currently, the denominator is \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5\\). To make it a power of 10, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^4\\) to eliminate the remaining \\(2\\) in the denominator.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57 \\times 2^4}{160 \\times 2^4} = \\frac{57 \\times 16}{10^5} = \\frac{912}{100000}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide the Numerator by the Denominator**:\n   - \\(\\frac{912}{100000} = 0.00912\\)\n\n5. **Final Terminating Decimal**:\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) converts to the terminating decimal \\(0.00912\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.00912}\n\\]"
