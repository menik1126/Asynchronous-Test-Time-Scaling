Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how to simplify radicals with different indices. I know that the index of a radical is the root degree, like the cube root has an index of 3, square root is 2, and so on. Also, to rationalize a denominator, sometimes we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by a suitable expression to eliminate the radical from the denominator.\n\nLooking at the given expression: \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\\). Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside, I have \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}\\). That's the innermost radical. So, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}\\). Well, 729 is a number I recognize from multiplication tables. Let me check: 9 times 9 is 81, 81 times 9 is 729. So, 729 is \\(9^3\\) or \\(3^6\\), because 3 cubed is 27, and 27 squared is 729. So, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3^6}}\\).\n\nNow, the square root of a fraction is the same as the fraction of the square roots. So, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3^6}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3^6}}\\). The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of \\(3^6\\) is \\(3^{6/2} = 3^3 = 27\\). So, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}\\). That's simpler.\n\nSo now, the original expression becomes \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}}\\). Let me deal with the cube root next. The cube root of \\(\\frac{1}{27}\\) is straightforward because I know that \\(\\sqrt[3]{27} = 3\\), since 3 times 3 times 3 is 27. Therefore, \\(\\sqrt"

            "output": "[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nNow substituting back, the expression is now \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). Wait, so the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3, so then the next step is taking the square root of that. So, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). \n\nHmm, but the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator. The square root of 1/3 is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\). But the denominator here is irrational because of the square root. To rationalize the denominator, I need to multiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) to get rid of the radical in the denominator. \n\nSo, \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). That gives a rational denominator. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the steps correctly. Let me retrace:\n\nOriginal expression: sqrt(cbrt(sqrt(1/729)))\n\nFirst step: sqrt(1/729) = 1/27. Correct, since sqrt(3^6) is 3^3.\n\nSecond step: cbrt(1/27) = 1/3. Correct, since cube root of 3^3 is 3, so 1/3.\n\nThird step: sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3). Then rationalizing gives sqrt(3)/3. That seems right.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to approach this by expressing everything with exponents instead of radicals. Maybe that would make it clearer?\n\nStarting over, using exponents:\n\nThe original expression is sqrt( (cbrt( sqrt(1/729) )) )\n\nExpressed with exponents, sqrt is exponent 1/2, cube root is exponent 1/3, and the inner sqrt is also exponent 1/2. So:\n\nFirst, the innermost part: sqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^{1/2}\n\nThen, the cube root of that is [ (1/729"

Then rationalizing gives sqrt(3)/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I express all operations in terms of exponents to 3?\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify the exponents step by step.\n\nLet me think:\n\nStart from the inside:\n\nsqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^{1/2}\n\nThen cube root of that: (1/729)^{1/2 * 1/3} = (1/729)^{1/6}\n\nThen, sqrt of that: (1/729)^{1/6 * 1/2} = (1/729)^{1/12}\n\n729 is 3^6, so (1/(3^6))^{1/12} = 3^{-6*(1/12)} = 3^{-1/2} = 1/3^{1/2} = 1/sqrt(3)\n\nThen, rationalizing, as before, gives sqrt(3)/3.\n\nAnother way is to express all the roots as exponents:\n\nStarting expression: sqrt( cbrt( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nThis is: (1/729)^{1/2} inside the cube root, so (1/729)^{1/2 * 1/3} inside the square root.\n\nWait, maybe let me clarify: each root operation is applied sequentially, so starting from the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst operation: sqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^{1/2}\n\nSecond operation: cbrt( (sqrt(1/729)) ) = ( (1/729)^{1/2} )^{1/3} = (1/729)^{1/6}\n\nThird operation: sqrt( cbrt(...) ) = ( (1/729"

So same result.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form is 1/sqrt(3), but with a rational denominator, so multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\n(1 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is sqrt(3)/3. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent calculations. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting with the innermost radical:\n\nsqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^{1/2} = 1^{1/2}/729^{1/2} = 1/(729^{1/2}).\n\nSince 729 is 27 squared? Wait, 27 squared is 729? Wait, 27 squared is 729? Let me check: 27*27 is 729? 27*20 is 540, 27*7 is 189, so 540+189=729. Yes, so 27^2 is 729. Wait, but 27 is 3^3, so 27 squared is (3^3)^2 = 3^6. So, 729 is 3^6. Therefore, sqrt(729) is sqrt(3^6) = 3^3 = 27. So that's correct.\n\nThen, cube root of (1/27) is (1/27)^{1/3} = 1^{1/3}/27^{1/3} = 1/3, since 27 is 3^3. So that's correct.\n\nThen sqrt(1/3"

Correct.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe express all radicals as exponents with denominator 3, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let's express 1/729 in terms of base 3.\n\n1/729 is 3^{-6} as 729 is 3^6.\n\nSo, sqrt(3^{-6}) is 3^{-3} = 1/27. Then, cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then sqrt(1/3) is 1/sqrt(3). So same result.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I can write all the roots in terms of exponents and then combine the exponents?\n\nThe original expression is sqrt(cbrt(sqrt(1/729)))\n\nExpressed with exponents:\n\nsqrt(...) = exponent 1/2\n\ncbrt(...) = exponent 1/3\n\nsqrt(...) = exponent 1/2\n\nSo, starting from the inside:\n\nsqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^{1/2} = (3^{-6})^{1/2} = 3^{-3} = 1/27\n\nThen, cbrt(1/27) = (1/27)^{1/3} = (3^{-3})^{1/3} = 3^{-1} = 1/3\n\nThen, sqrt(1/3) = (1/3)^{1/2} = 3^{-1/2} = 1/sqrt(3)\n\nSo, same as before. Thus, rationalizing gives sqrt(3)/3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can think about this in terms of the order of operations, making sure I follow each step correctly.\n\nAnother way to check is to compute numerically:\n\nCompute sqrt(1/729). 1/729 is approximately 0.001371742. The square root of that is about 0.037037, which is 1/27.\n\nThen, cbrt(1/27). 1/27 is approx 0.037037. The cube root of that is 0.1, which is 1/10? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, (1/27)^{1/3} is 1/3.
