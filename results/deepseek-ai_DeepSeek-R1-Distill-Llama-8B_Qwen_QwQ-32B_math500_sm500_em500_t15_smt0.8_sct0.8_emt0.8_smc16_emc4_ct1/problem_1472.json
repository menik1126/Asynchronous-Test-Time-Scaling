            "output": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to simplify this expression: the cube root of the square root of 1/729. Hmm, okay, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that 729 is a number I've seen before in math problems. I think it's a power of 9 because 9 times 9 is 81, and 81 times 9 is 729. So, 9 cubed is 729. That means 9^3 = 729. So, 1/729 is the same as 1/(9^3). \n\nNow, the expression inside the radicals is 1/729. The first operation is taking the cube root of that. The cube root of 1/729... Hmm, let me think. Since 729 is 9^3, the cube root of 9^3 is just 9. So, the cube root of 1/729 should be 1/9, because the cube root of 1 is 1 and the cube root of 729 is 9. So, cube root of 1/729 is 1/9.\n\nOkay, so now the expression simplifies to the square root of 1/9. What's the square root of 1/9? Well, the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 9 is 3, so the square root of 1/9 should be 1/3. Because sqrt(1)/sqrt(9) = 1/3.\n\nWait, but the original expression was the cube root of the square root of 1/729. So, first cube root, which gave me 1/9, then the square root of that, which is 1/3. So, putting it all together, sqrt(cube_root(1/729)) simplifies to 1/3.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should write it in terms of exponents to see if that helps. Let's see, the cube root is the same as raising to the power of 1/3, and the square root is raising to the power of 1/2. So, let's rewrite the expression:\n\nsqrt(cube_root(1/729)) = (1/729)^(1/3 * 1/2) = (1/"

Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the original problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says: sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). Wait, actually, the innermost is sqrt(1/729), then the cube root of that, then the square root of the cube root. Hmm, so maybe I did it in the wrong order before?\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression again carefully. The problem is written as sqrt{ \\sqrt[3]{ \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{729} } } }, so the order is: first take the square root of 1/729, then take the cube root of that result, and then take the square root of the cube root. So, the order is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). \n\nHmm, so my initial approach was correct. Let me go through each step again step by step.\n\nFirst step: compute the innermost radical, which is sqrt(1/729). \n\nsqrt(1/729) = sqrt(1)/sqrt(729) = 1/27, because sqrt(729) is sqrt(9^3) = 9^(3/2) = 9*sqrt(9) = 9*3 = 27? Wait, hold on, sqrt(9^3) is 9^(3/2) which is indeed 9^(1.5) = 9*3 = 27. So yes, sqrt(729) is 27, so sqrt(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nWait a second, so I made a mistake earlier. Initially, I thought the cube root of 1/729 is 1/9, but actually, the first step is taking the square root of 1/729, which is 1/27. Then, the cube root of that result, so cube root of 1/27. Since 27 is 3^3, so cube root of 1/27 is 1"

            "output": "/3.\n\nThen, after that, we take the square root of 1/3. So, sqrt(1/3) is equal to (1)/sqrt(3). To write this with a rational denominator, we can rationalize it by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(3), giving sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because I had two different pathways here. Initially, I thought the order was cube root first, but now I'm seeing that no, the order is square root first, cube root next, then square root again. So, I think I messed up the initial order.\n\nWait, the original problem is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). So, the innermost is sqrt(1/729) = 1/27, then cube_root(1/27) = 1/3, then sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/3 after rationalizing.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my first approach where I took cube_root(1/729) first, which was wrong because of the order of operations.\n\nSo, in the first approach, I incorrectly took cube_root(1/729) as 1/9, but that's not the case. Because the expression is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ), so the correct order is:\n\n1. Compute sqrt(1/729) = 1/27.\n\n2. Then compute cube_root(1/27) = 1/3.\n\n3. Finally, take sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nTherefore, the simplified result is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, let me write the expression as exponents to make it clearer.\n\nThe original expression is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). Let's express each radical as a fractional exponent.\n\nsqrt(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2).\n\nThen, cube_root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n\nThen, sqrt of that is [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nHmm, so 1/729 is "

Therefore, 729^(-1/12) = (3^6)^(-1/12) = 3^(-6/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/(3^(1/2)) = 1/sqrt(3). Then, rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3): (sqrt(3))/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSo that's the same result as before. So, the final answer is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but let me check again step by step:\n\nFirst step: sqrt(1/729). Since 729 is 27 squared? Wait, 27 squared is 729? Wait, 27 squared is 729? Let me compute 27*27. 27*20 is 540, 27*7 is 189, so 540+189=729. Oh, so 27 squared is 729. Wait, so sqrt(729) is 27. Therefore, sqrt(1/729) is 1/27. That's correct.\n\nSecond step: cube root of 1/27. Since 27 is 3^3, so cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Correct.\n\nThird step: sqrt(1/3). Which is sqrt(1)/sqrt(3) = 1/sqrt(3). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\n(1 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/3. \n\nYes, that's correct.
