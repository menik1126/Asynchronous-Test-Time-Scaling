Here, the denominator is already \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).\n\nNext, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators' powers of 2 and 5, which is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\). To convert the fraction, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^{3}\\) and \\(5^{0}\\) to make the denominator a power of 10.\n\nAfter adjusting, the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{21 \\cdot 2^3}{10^7}\\). Calculating \\(21 \\cdot 8\\) gives 168. Therefore, the fraction simplifies to \\(\\frac{168}{10^7}\\).\n\nFinally, I'll divide 168 by \\(10^7\\) to find the decimal equivalent.

Let me check again.\n\nWait, in step 2, I multiplied numerator and denominator by \\(2^5\\), but the original denominator has \\(2^2\\). So multiplying by \\(2^5\\) gives \\(2^{2+5}=2^7\\), and the denominator becomes \\(2^7 \\cdot 5^7 = 10^7\\). The numerator is 21 * 32 = 672. So the fraction is 672/10^7. \n\nBut 672 divided by 10^7 is 0.0000672. But the original question was 21/(2²*5⁷). Let me verify with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the denominator is 2²*5⁷, the number of decimal places needed is the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5, which is 7. So we can write the fraction as (21 * 5^(7-2)) / 10^7, since we need to make the exponent of 2 equal to 7. Wait, 2²*5⁷ = 2²*5²*5⁵ = (2*5)^2 *5⁵ = 10²*5⁵. Hmm, maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, to make the denominator 10^7, we need to have 2^7 and 5^7. Since the original denominator is 2²*5⁷, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7-2)=2^5 to get 2^7*5^7=10^7. \n\nSo numerator becomes 21 * 2^5 = 21*32 = 672. So the fraction is 672/10^7 = 0.0000672. \n\nWait, but the initial problem says 21/(2²*5⁷). Let me compute 2²*5⁷:\n\n"

Add decimal point and zeros: 312500 goes into 210000 0 times. 312500 goes into 2100000 6 times (6*312500=1,875,000). Subtract 1,875,000 from 2,100,000: 225,000. Bring down next 0: 2250000. 312500 goes into 2250000 7 times (7*312500=2,187,500). Subtract: 2250000 - 2187500 = 62500. Bring down next 0: 625000. 312500 goes into 625000 2 times (2*312500=625000).
