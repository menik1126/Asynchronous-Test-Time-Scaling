The denominator is \\( 2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\), which means it has both 2s and 5s as prime factors.\n\nSince the denominator has only 2s and 5s, the fraction can be expressed with a denominator that is a power of 10. I'll convert the denominator by considering the maximum exponent between the exponents of 2 and 5. Here, the exponent of 2 is 2 and the exponent of 5 is 7. The higher exponent is 7, so I'll use \\( 10^7 \\) as the common denominator.\n\nNext, I'll adjust the numerator and denominator to achieve this common denominator.

Let me check the calculation again. The numerator is 672, and the denominator is \\(10^7\\), which is 10,000,000. So placing 672 over 10^7 would mean moving the decimal point seven places to the left. Starting from 672, which is 672.0, moving the decimal seven places left gives 0.0000672. But earlier I thought it was 0.0006720. Hmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, 10^7 is 10,000,000. So 672 divided by 10,000,000. Let's count the decimal places:\n\n- 672 divided by 10 is 67.2 (1 place)\n- Divided by 100 is 6.72 (2 places)\n- Divided by 1000 is 0.672 (3 places)\n- Divided by 10,000 is 0.0672 (4 places)\n- Divided by 100,000 is 0.00672 (5 places)\n- Divided by 1,000,000 is 0.000672 (6 places)\n- Divided by 10,000,000 is 0.0000672 (7 places)\n\nAh, so my second calculation is correct. The first step had an error in the decimal placement. The correct decimal is 0.0000672.\n\nWait, but"

The denominator is 2\u00b2 * 5\u2077 = 4 * 78125 = 4 * 78125. Let me compute that:\n\n78125 * 4 = 312,500. So denominator is 312,500. Wait, but 2\u00b2 is 4, 5\u2077 is 78125. 4 * 78125 = 312,500. So the fraction is 21 / 312,500.\n\nWait, so 21 divided by 312,500. Let me compute that division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step when I converted to 10^7. Let me see:\n\nOriginal fraction: 21/(2\u00b2 *5\u2077). To make denominator 10^7, since 10^7 = 2^7 *5^7. So to get from denominator 2\u00b2 *5\u2077 to 2^7 *5^7, we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7-2)=2^5=32. So:\n\n21 *32 / (2\u00b2*5\u2077 *2^5) = 21*32 / (2^7 *5^7) = 21*32 /10^7.\n\n21*32 is 672, so 672/10^7. 10^7 is 10,000,000. So 672 divided by 10,000,000.\n\nNow, 672 divided by 10,000,000:\n\nLet me write 672 as 672.0. Moving the decimal point 7 places to the left:\n\nStart: 672.0 \u2192 move 1: 67.20 \u2192 2: 6.720 \u2192 3: 0.6720 \u2192 4: 0.067"
