So, I need to find \\( x \\) where the cube root of \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 \\) equals 16. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that cube roots can be a bit tricky, but one way to handle them is by cubing both sides of the equation. That should eliminate the cube root and make the equation easier to solve. Let me write that down.\n\nStarting with the original equation:\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\n\\]\nIf I cube both sides, that should give me:\n\\[\n(x^2 - 4x + 4) = 16^3\n\\]\nWait, 16 cubed. What's 16 cubed? Let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... 4096. Yes, 16^3 is 4096.\n\nSo, substituting that back in, I have:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\\]\nOkay, so now I have a quadratic equation. It's a bit simpler, but I need to rearrange it so that it's set to zero. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides to do that.\n\nSubtracting 4096:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\\]\nSimplifying that:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\\]\nAlright, now I have the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\). I need to solve for \\( x \\). Since it's a quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -4092 \\).\n\nLet me plug these values into the formula. First, identify \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and"

Hmm, what's the square root of 16384? Let me think. I know that 128 squared is 16384 because 128*128 is 16384. Let me verify that: 128*100=12800, 128*28=3584; 12800+3584=16384. Yes, so sqrt(16384)=128.\n\nSo, the square root is 128. Therefore, plugging back into the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2}\n\\]\nNow, we have two possible solutions:\n1. \\( x = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} \\)\n2. \\( x = \\frac{4 - 128}{2} \\)\n\nLet's compute both.\n\nFirst solution:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\nSecond solution:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-124}{2} = -62\n\\]\nSo, the two solutions are \\( x = 66 \\) and \\( x = -62 \\).\n\nBut the problem asks specifically for the positive value of \\( x \\). So, that would be 66.\n\nLet me just double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the discriminant or the calculations.\n\nStarting from the original equation:\nCube root of"

Wait, because 16 + 16368 is 16384, sqrt is 128.\n\nSo, x = (4 +128)/2=132/2=66 or x=(4-128)/2=-124/2=-62.
