            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this equation: the cube root of (x² - 4x + 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better. So it's ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. Alright, cube roots can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that to get rid of a cube root, I can cube both sides of the equation. That should simplify things.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again: ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. If I cube both sides, the cube root on the left should disappear, right? So that would give me (x² - 4x + 4) = 16³. Now, what's 16 cubed? Let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16—let me compute that step by step. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together: 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, 16³ is 4096.\n\nSo now, my equation is x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. Hmm, that seems manageable. I need to solve for x here. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero because then I can have a quadratic equation. So, x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, right? So the equation becomes x² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. I think I can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a), where a is the coefficient of x², which is 1, b is the coefficient of x, which is -4, and c is the constant term, which is -4092.\n\nLet me plug those values into the formula. So, first, compute the discriminant: b² - 4ac. Plugging in the numbers, that's (-4)² - 4*(1)*(-"

            "output": "4092). Let's calculate that. (-4) squared is 16. Then, 4 times 1 times (-4092) is -16368. So, subtracting that negative, it becomes 16 + 16368, which is 16384.\n\nNow, the discriminant is 16384. Then, the square root of 16384—let me see what that is. I remember that 128 squared is 16384 because 128 times 128 is 16384. So, √16384 is 128. Now, plugging back into the quadratic formula, we have x = [4 ± 128] / (2*1). So, that simplifies to x = (4 ± 128)/2.\n\nTherefore, we have two possible solutions: one where we add 128 to 4, and another where we subtract 128 from 4. So, first solution is (4 + 128)/2, which is 132/2, which equals 66. The second solution is (4 - 128)/2, which is (-124)/2, which is -62.\n\nBut the question asks for the positive value of x, so we discard the negative one. So, the positive solution is x = 66. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nSo, plugging x = 66 back into the original equation: ∛(66² - 4*66 +4). Let me compute 66 squared: 66*66. I think 60 squared is 3600, and 6 squared is 36, and then cross terms would be 2*60*6=720. So, 3600 + 720 + 36 = 4356. Then, 4*66 is 264. So, subtracting 4x gives 4356 - 264 = 4092. Then, adding 4 gives 4096. So, ∛4096. Earlier, I said that 16 cubed is 4096, so ∛4096 is indeed 16. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, x = 66 is the correct solution. I think that covers everything. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16."
