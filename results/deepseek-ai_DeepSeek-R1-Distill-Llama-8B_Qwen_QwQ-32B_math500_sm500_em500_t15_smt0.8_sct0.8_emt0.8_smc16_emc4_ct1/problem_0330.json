This can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for the boys, C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35 ways.\n\nNext, I need to determine how many ways there are to choose 2 girls out of the 4 available. Using the same combination formula, C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6 ways.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls, I multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls. Therefore, the total number of ways is 35 * 6 = 210.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n   \n   The number of ways to choose \\( k \\) items from \\( n \\) items without considering the order is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n   \\]\n   \n   Applying this to the boys:\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n   \n   Using the same combination formula:\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Find"
