            "output": "First, I need to determine how many trailing zeros are in 42 factorial, denoted as 42!.\n\nI recall that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, the number of trailing zeros is essentially the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of times 5 is a factor in 42!. This can be done by dividing 42 by 5 and taking the floor of the result. So, 42 ÷ 5 equals 8.4, and taking the floor gives me 8.\n\nSimilarly, I'll calculate the number of times 2 is a factor in 42!. Dividing 42 by 2 gives 21, and since 21 is already an integer, there are 21 factors of 2.\n\nNow, each pair of 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero. Since there are 8 fives and 21 twos, the limiting factor here is the number of fives. Therefore, there are 8 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many trailing zeros are in \\(42!\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**:  \n   Trailing zeros in a factorial are created by factors of 10, which are the product of 2 and 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of 5s in \\(42!\\)**:  \n   Divide 42 by 5 and take the floor of the result to find how many multiples of 5 are in the factorial.\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 8.4 \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   So, there are **8** factors of 5 in \\(42!\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of 2s in \\(42!\\)**:  \n   Similarly, divide 42 by 2 and take the floor of the result.\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\"
