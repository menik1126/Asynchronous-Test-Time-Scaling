Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I'll need to figure out how many pairs of 2s and 5s are in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nHowever, there are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial, so the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros. I'll count how many multiples of 5 are in 42!. \n\nStarting from 5, every fifth number is a multiple of 5. Therefore, I'll divide 42 by 5 to find the number of multiples of 5: 42 / 5 = 8.4. Since I can't have a fraction of a multiple, I'll take the whole number part, which is 8.\n\nBut wait, some numbers are multiples of higher powers of 5, like 25, 125, etc. These contribute more than one 5 to the factorization. So, I'll divide 42 by 25: 42 / 25 = 1.68. Taking the whole number gives me 1 additional 5.\n\nThere are no multiples of 125 in 42, so I won't add any more 5s.\n\nFinally, adding up the 5s from the multiples of 5 and 25, I have 8 + 1 = 9 fives. Since there are more than enough 2s to pair with these 5s, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we'll count the number of pairs of these factors in \\(42!\\).\n\n1. **Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\):**\n   \n   - Every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5.\n   - Higher powers of 5 (like 25) contribute more than one 5.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of 5s} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25"
