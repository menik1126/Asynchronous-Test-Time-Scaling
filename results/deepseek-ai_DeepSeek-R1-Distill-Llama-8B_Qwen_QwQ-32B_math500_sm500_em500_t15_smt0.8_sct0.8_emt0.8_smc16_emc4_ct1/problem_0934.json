Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I need to find how many pairs of 2s and 5s are in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 5s in the factors of 42!. I do this by dividing 42 by 5 and considering the quotient. 42 divided by 5 is 8 with a remainder, so there are 8 fives.\n\nThen, I'll count the number of 2s in the factors of 42!. Dividing 42 by 2 gives 21, and dividing by 4 gives 10, by 8 gives 5, by 16 gives 2, and higher powers of 2 don't contribute further. Adding these up: 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 equals 38.\n\nFinally, the number of trailing zeros is the smaller number of paired 2s and 5s, which is the minimum of 8 and 38. Therefore, there are 8 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count how many times the factor 10 appears in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we'll count the number of pairs of these factors in \\(42!\\).\n\n### Step 1: Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\)\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n\\]\nThis accounts for all multiples of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 42.\n\n### Step 2: Count the number of 2s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\)\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 21 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 10 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{8} \\right\\rfloor = 5 \\\\\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{16} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\\\\n\\left\\"
