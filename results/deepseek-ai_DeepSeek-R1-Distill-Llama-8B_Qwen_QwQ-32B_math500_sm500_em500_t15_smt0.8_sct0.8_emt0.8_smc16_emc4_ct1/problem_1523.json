So, I remember that in problems like these, sometimes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities come into play, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since all the \\(a_i\\) are positive real numbers, they must satisfy certain conditions. I also recall that for sequences of numbers, there are relations between the sums of their powers. Maybe I can use these to find constraints on \\(n\\).\n\nLet me denote the sum of the \\(a_i\\) as \\(S_1 = 96\\), the sum of their squares as \\(S_2 = 144\\), and the sum of their cubes as \\(S_3 = 216\\).\n\nOne thing that comes to mind is the relationship between the squares of sums and the sums of squares. I think that:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 + 2 \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} a_i a_j.\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n96^2 = 144 + 2 \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} a_i a_j.\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(96^2 = 9216\\). So,\n\n\\[\n9216 = 144 + 2 \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} a_i a_j.\n\\]\nSubtract 144 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n9216 - 144 = 2 \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} a_i a_j,\n\\]\n\\[\n9072 = 2 \\sum_{1 \\leq"

But I'm not sure how this helps me find \\(n\\). Maybe I should think about some kind of inequality that relates these three sums.\n\nI remember the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality which states that for any real numbers, the square of the sum is less than or equal to the product of the sums of squares. But in this case, I have three different sums. Maybe the Power Mean inequality can help here?\n\nThe Power Mean inequality says that for positive real numbers, the mean of the squares is at least the square of the mean. Let me compute the mean of the \\(a_i\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{96}{n}.\n\\]\n\nThen, the mean of the squares is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{144}{n}}.\n\\]\n\nAccording to the Power Mean inequality,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{144}{n}} \\geq \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right).\n\\]\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. The Power Mean inequality for \\(p=2\\) and \\(p=1\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i^2 \\right)^{1/2} \\geq \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i \\right).\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.

Perhaps I can relate \\(S_3\\) to \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) somehow.\n\nI remember that for positive numbers, the following inequality holds:\n\n\\[\n\\sum a_i^3 \\leq \\left( \\sum a_i \\right)^3 / n^2.\n\\]\n\nWait, is that correct? Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe another approach. Let me consider the relationship between the sum of cubes and the sum of the numbers.\n\nIf all the \\(a_i\\) are equal, then \\(a_i = \\frac{96}{n}\\), and then \\(S_2\\) would be \\(n \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{96^2}{n}\\).

Wait, no, actually 144 is less than \\(96^2 / n\\), so:\n\nIf all \\(a_i\\) are equal, then \\(144 = \\frac{9216}{n}\\), which would imply \\(n = 9216 / 144 = 64\\). So, when \\(n =64\\), the sum of squares is 144 only if all \\(a_i\\) are equal to 1.5, since \\(96 /64 = 1.5\\), and \\(1.5^2 = 2.25\\), multiplied by 64 gives 144.\n\nWait, but if \\(n >64\\), then \\(S_2\\) would be less than 144, because \\(96^2 / n\\) decreases as \\(n\\) increases. But in our problem, \\(S_2 = 144\\). So, for \\(n >64\\), \\(96^2 /n <144\\), but in our problem \\(S_2=144\\). Hmm, that suggests that if \\(n >64\\), the sum"

Wait, but maybe that's possible?\n\nAlternatively, if \\(n <64\\), then \\(96^2 /n >144\\), so the sum of squares would be higher than 144 if all terms are equal, but maybe by having some terms larger and some smaller, you can get the sum of squares down to 144.

So, the minimal possible \\(n\\) is 64. But can \\(n\\) be larger than 64?\n\nHmm, perhaps. Let me think. For example, if some of the \\(a_i\\) are zero, but the problem states that all \\(a_i\\) are positive real numbers. So, they can't be zero, but they can be very small. So, maybe you can have more terms by having some terms very small and others"

Let me see if that's possible. Let me assume that \\(n >64\\). Then, I can distribute the total sum of 96 over more terms, making some terms very small.\n\nBut then, would the sum of squares remain 144? Let me see. If I have \\(n=65\\), for instance, then each \\(a_i\\) would on average be \\(96/65 ≈ 1.4769\\). The sum of squares would be 65*(1.4769)^2 ≈ 65*(2.184) ≈ 142.2, which is less than 144. So, if I have more terms, the sum of squares goes down. To reach 144, I need to have some terms larger than the average and some smaller.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the sum of squares is exactly 144, which is higher than the sum of squares if all \\(a_i\\) are equal. Wait, that can't be, because if all \\(a_i\\) are equal, \\(n=64\\) gives the sum of squares as exactly 144. If \\(n >64\\), then the sum of squares would be less than 144. But our problem has sum of squares equal to 144, so that would only be possible if \\(n=64\\), because for \\(n >64\\), the sum of squares would be less than 144 when all \\(a_i\\) are equal, but perhaps more if some \\(a_i\\) are larger and others smaller. Hmm, this seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. If \\(n=65\\), for example, and all \\(a_i\\) are 96/65, then the sum of squares would be 65*(96/65)^2 = 65*(9216/4225) = 9216/65 ≈142.15, which is less than 144. So, if some of the \\(a_i\\) are increased, and others are decreased, then the sum of squares would increase beyond that. So, perhaps if I have \\(n>64\\), I can have some \\(a_i\\) slightly higher than 1.5 and others lower, so that the sum of squares remains 144."

Then, perhaps only solution is when n=64.\n\nBut when n=64, then (n-1)=63,\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n64 b² -192 b +9072/63=0.\n\nCompute 9072 ÷63=144.\n\nSo,\n\n64b² -192b +144=0.\n\nDividing by 16,\n\n4b² -12b +9=0.\n\nThis factors as (2b -3)^2=0, so b=3/2=1.5.\n\nThus, when n=64, m=1, and (n-1)=63 variables are 1.5, and one variable a=96 -63*1.5=96-94.5=1.5. So, all variables are 1.5, which is the equal case. So, in this case, the only solution for m=1 is n=64.\n\nSimilarly, for m=2, let me set up the equations:\n\n2a + (n-2)b=96,\n\n2a² + (n-2)b²=144,\n\n2a³ + (n-2)b³=216.\n\nThis seems more complicated, but perhaps if n=64, then m=2 and (n-2)=62 variables are b.\n\nSo,\n\n2a +62b=96,\n\n2a² +62b²=144,\n\n2a³ +62b³=216.\n\nLet me see if this can be solved.\n\nFrom the first equation, 2a=96 -62b ⇒ a=(96 -62b)/2=48 -31b.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n2*(48 -31b)^2 +62b²=144.\n\nCompute (48 -31b)^2=48² -2*48*31b + (31b)^2=2304 -2976b +961b².\n\nSo,\n\n2*(2304 -2976b +961b²)+62b²=144,\n\n2*2304=4608,\n\n2*(-2976b)= -5952b,\n\n2*961b²=1922b²,\n\nAdding 62b²: 1922b² +62b²=1984b².\n\nThus,\n\n4608 -5952b +198"

So, 4464=1984*2.25, so 4464/1984=2.25.\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nb² -3b +2.25=0,\n\nWhich factors as (b -1.5)^2=0 ⇒ b=1.5.\n\nThus, a=48 -31*1.5=48 -46.5=1.5.\n\nTherefore, in this case, a=1.5, b=1.5, meaning all variables are 1.5, so again n=64.\n\nThus, it seems that regardless of how I set the variables, the only solution that works is when all variables are equal, giving n=64.
