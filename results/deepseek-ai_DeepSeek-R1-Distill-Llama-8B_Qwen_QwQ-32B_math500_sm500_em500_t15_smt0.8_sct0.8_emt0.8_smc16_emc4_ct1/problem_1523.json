Because the Power Mean Inequality gives that n must be at least 64, but perhaps n=64 is the minimal, and the only possible n since any higher n would require the sums to spread out more, but the third equation might not hold.\n\nWait, but n can be larger if the a_i are not equal. Hmm, but does that affect the third sum? Let me think.\n\nIf n is larger, then for the sum of cubes to remain at 216, the individual a_i's would have to be smaller, but their squares would also be smaller. However, the sum of squares is fixed at 144, which is less than what it would be if all a_i were equal (which was 64*144=9216? Wait no, the sum of squares when all a_i are equal would be 64*(144/64) = 144, which is consistent. Wait, but the sum of cubes would be 64*(216/64)^3 = 64*(216^3/64^3) = 216^3/(64^2) = 216^3/4096 ≈ (certainly not 216).

So if the variables are not equal, the sums would deviate, but we have fixed sums. So maybe the minimal n is 64, and there's no higher n possible because if n increases beyond 64, the sums would require the individual a_i to be too small, but then the sum of squares might not add up to 144.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the sum of cubes and squares. Let me think about that.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the concept of moments. Let me consider the variables \\( x_i = a_i \\).

For example, n=65.\n\nSuppose that 64 of the a_i are 1.5 each, contributing 96 total, 64*(1.5) = 96, but wait, no: 64*1.5 = 96, so that's correct. Then the sum of squares would be 64*(1.5)^2 = 64*2.25=144, which matches. The sum of cubes would be 64*(3.375)=216. So that works.\n\nWait, but if we set n=65, we need 65 variables adding up to 96, each with squares adding to 144, and cubes to 216. But if 64 of them are 1.5, then the 65th would have to be 96 - 64*1.5 = 96 - 96 = 0. But the problem states that the numbers must be positive real numbers, so 0 is not allowed.

But we know from Cauchy-Schwarz that n ≥64, so n can be 64,65,...,72.\n\nBut also, from the Power Mean Inequality, n cannot exceed 64 because beyond that, the cubic mean would be less than quadratic mean, which violates the inequality. So the only possible n is 64.\n\nThus, r=2 only works for n=64.\n\nLet me check n=64:\n\nThen, from equation 1: y=96/(k +64)\n\nFrom equation 2: y²(3k +64)=144\n\nSubstitute y:\n\n(96/(k +64))^2 (3k +64)=144 ⇒\n\n(9216/(k +64)^2)(3k +64)=144 ⇒\n\n9216(3k +64) =144(k +64)^2 ⇒\n\nDivide both sides by 144:\n\n64(3k +64) = (k +64)^2 ⇒\n\n192k +4096 =k² +128k +4096 ⇒\n\n192k =k² +128k ⇒\n\nk² -64k=0 ⇒k(k -64)=0 ⇒k=0 or k=64\n\nBut k=0 would mean all a_i are y=96/(0 +64)=1.5, which is the case we already know. k=64 would mean 64 terms of x=2y and 0 terms of y, but then n=64 +0=64, which is the same as before. So no new solution.\n\nThus, with r=2, the only possible n is 64.\n\nLet me try r=3, perhaps.\n\nIf r=3, then x=3y.\n\nThen, equation 1: k(3y - y)"
