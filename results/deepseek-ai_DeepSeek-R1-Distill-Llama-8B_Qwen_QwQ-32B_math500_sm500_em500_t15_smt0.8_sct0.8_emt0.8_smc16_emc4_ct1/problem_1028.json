It says, let me write it down first to make sure I have it right:\n\nWe have the polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) and it's supposed to factor into polynomials \\( p_1(x), p_2(x), \\dotsc, p_k(x) \\). Each of these non-constant polynomials is monic with integer coefficients, and they can't be factored further over the integers. Then, I need to compute the sum \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dotsm + p_k(1) \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to factor this polynomial into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients and then evaluate each at 1 and sum them up. Sounds like I need to factor the given polynomial first.\n\nLet me write down the polynomial again: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). It's an eighth-degree polynomial, so factoring it might be a bit involved. Maybe I can try substitution or look for patterns.\n\nNotice that the exponents are 8, 4, and 0. That suggests perhaps a substitution like \\( y = x^4 \\). Let's try that. If I let \\( y = x^4 \\), the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of y.\n\nLet me solve \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\). Using the quadratic formula: \\( y = [-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}]/2 = [-3 \\pm 5]/2 \\). So, the solutions are \\( y = (-3 + 5)/2 = 1 \\) and \\( y = (-3 - 5)/2 = -4 \\). Therefore, \\( y = 1 \\) or \\( y = -4 \\).\n\nSo, substituting back, since \\( y = x^4 \\), we have \\( x^4 = 1 \\) and \\( x^4 = -4 \\). Wait, \\( x^4 = -4 \\) would lead to \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{-4} \\), but that would give complex roots. However, since we're factoring over integers, maybe there's"

Since \\( y^2 + 3y -4 = (y - 1)(y + 4) \\), substituting back gives \\( (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4) \\). So, the original polynomial factors into \\( (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4) \\). But are these factors irreducible over the integers?\n\nHmm, let's check each factor. Starting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\). That's a difference of squares, right? \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Then, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) factors further into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) \\). So, \\( x^4 - 1 \\) factors into linear terms over integers. But the problem states that each \\( p_i(x) \\) is monic, irreducible over integers, so we need to factor it as far as possible.\n\nSo, \\( x^4 -1 \\) factors into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Wait, but \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible over integers because it doesn't factor into real linear factors, but over integers, it can't be factored into polynomials with integer coefficients. Let me confirm that. Suppose \\( x^2 + 1 = (x + a)(x + b) \\), then \\( a + b = 0 \\), \\( ab = 1 \\). So, a and b would have to be 1 and 1 or -1 and -1, but then their sum would be 2 or -2, not zero. So, no, it can't be factored over integers. So, \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible. So, the factorization of \\( x^4 -1 \\) is three factors: two linear and one quadratic.\n\nNow, the other factor is \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm, can this be factored over integers? Let me think. I recall that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is a sum of squares"

Yes, because in general, \\( x^4 + a^4 = (x^2 + ax \\sqrt{2}) (x^2 - ax \\sqrt{2}) \\), but that has irrational coefficients. However, wait, actually there's a formula for factoring \\( x^4 + 4 \\) over integers.\n\nYes, it's called the Sophie Germain identity: \\( x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2) \\). If we set y=1, then \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\). Let me check: Multiplying \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\):\n\n\\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 4 \\). Let's combine like terms:\n\n- x^4 term: 1\n- x^3 terms: (-2x^3 + 2x^3) = 0\n- x^2 terms: (2x^2 - 4x^2 + 2x^2) = 0\n- x terms: (4x - 4x) = 0\n- Constant term: 4.\n\nSo, it indeed gives \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Great! So, \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nNow, are these quadratics irreducible over integers? Let's check their discriminants. For \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\), discriminant is \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), which is negative, so no real roots, so it can't be factored over integers. Similarly, \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) has"

So, total factors are 5 polynomials.

So, let's evaluate each of these polynomials at x =1.\n\nFirst, \\( p_1(x) = x - 1 \\). So, p1(1) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nSecond, \\( p_2(x) = x + 1 \\).

Yeah, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's another way to compute this without factoring, perhaps using roots or something.\n\nWait, another approach: for a polynomial f(x) factored as p1(x)p2(x)...pk(x), then f(1) is equal to the product of p_i(1).\n\nSo, if I compute f(1) first, it should be equal to p1(1)*p2(1)*...*pk(1). But in this case, since each p_i is evaluated at 1, then f(1) is the product of p_i(1). So, maybe if I compute f(1) and then compare it to the product of p_i(1), I can verify my result.\n\nLet's compute f(1): f(x) = x^8 + 3x^4 -4. So, f(1)=1 + 3 -4=0.\n\nWait, f(1)=0. That's interesting. So, the product of p_i(1)=0.\n\nLooking at my earlier calculation: 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 +1=10. But according to this, the product is 0, which is p1(1)=0. So, indeed, the product is zero, meaning one of the p_i(1) is zero, which is p1(1)=0, as in our earlier computation.\n\nSo, that seems consistent, but it doesn't directly help me unless I have more information.
