Then, after factoring it into these polynomials \\( p_1(x), p_2(x), \\) etc., I have to compute the sum of each \\( p_i(1) \\).\n\nFirst off, I remember that monic polynomials have leading coefficients of 1, and irreducible ones can't be factored further. So I need to factor \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) into such polynomials. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nMaybe I can consider substitution to simplify the polynomial. Let me set \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\). Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of y. Let me try to factor that quadratic equation.\n\nLooking at \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\), I'm trying to find two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. That would be 4 and -1 because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, I can factor it as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back, that gives \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nWait, so now we have \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). But \\( x^4 - 1 \\) is a difference of squares, right? So I can factor that further.\n\nYes, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\). And \\( x^2 - 1 \\) can be factored again as \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\). So putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as \\( (x^4 + 4)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nLet me double-check that:\n\n\\( (x + 1"

Yep, that's correct.\n\nOkay, so now I have the factorization: \\( (x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 4) \\).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure each factor is irreducible over the integers. Let me check each one:\n\n1. \\( x + 1 \\) is linear, so it's irreducible.\n\n2. \\( x - 1 \\) is also linear, so it's irreducible.\n\n3. \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is quadratic. Let me see if it factors further. The discriminant is \\( 0^2 - 4*1*1 = -4 \\), which is negative, so it doesn't have real roots and hence is irreducible over the integers.\n\n4. \\( x^4 + 4 \\) looks like it might factor further. I remember that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored using the sum of squares formula, but wait, over the integers, I think it can be factored into quadratics.\n\nIndeed, \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\). Let me check by expanding:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\)\n= \\( x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 4 \\)\n= \\( x^4 + ( -2x^3 + 2x^3 ) + (2x^2 - 4x^2 + 2x^2 ) + (4x - 4x) + 4 \\)\n= \\( x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 +"

Perfect, that's correct.\n\nSo that means \\( x^4 + 4 \\) factors into \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\), both of which are monic quadratics with integer coefficients.\n\nSo putting it all together, the full factorization is:\n\n\\( (x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nNow, I need to verify that each of these factors is irreducible.\n\n- \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\) are linear, so they are irreducible.\n\n- \\( x^2 + 1 \\) cannot be factored further as its roots would be complex.\n\n- \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\) and \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) both have discriminant \\( (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\) and \\( (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\) respectively, so they have no real roots and thus can't be factored further over integers. So they are irreducible.\n\nSo, all factors are monic, irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the sum \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) \\).\n\nEach \\( p_i(1) \\) is simply the value of each polynomial at x=1.

Then x^4+4 was further factored into (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2). So altogether, that's 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 polynomials.
