However, since the binary number has 11 digits, the leftmost group will have two bits.\n\nNext, I'll convert each group of three bits into their corresponding octal values. For the first group (110), that's 6 in octal. The second group (1010) will be split into two parts: 10 and 10, which are 2 each. For the single remaining bit (1), that's 1 in octal.\n\nFinally, I'll combine these octal values: 6, 2, 2, and 1 to get the final octal number as 6221. So, 10101001110 in binary is equal to 6221 in base eight.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\( 10101001110_2 \\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Break the binary number into groups of three bits** starting from the right.\n   \n2. **Convert each group of three bits into its corresponding octal value**.\n   \n3. **Combine the octal values** to get the final base eight number.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Binary number: } & \\quad 10101001110_2 \\\\\n\\text{Break into groups of three: } & \\quad 1\\ 01\\ 010\\ 011\\ 10 \\\\\n& \\quad (\\text{Note: The leftmost group may have fewer than three bits}) \\\\\n\\text{Convert each group: } & \\\\\n& \\quad 01\\ 010\\ 011\\ 10 \\\\\n& \\quad 1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4 \\\\\n& \\quad 6\\ 2\\ 2\\ 1 \\\\\n& \\quad 1 \\\\\n\\text{Combine the octal values: } & \\quad 6\\ 2\\ 2\\ 1 \\\\\n& \\quad 6221_8 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6221_8}\n\\]"
