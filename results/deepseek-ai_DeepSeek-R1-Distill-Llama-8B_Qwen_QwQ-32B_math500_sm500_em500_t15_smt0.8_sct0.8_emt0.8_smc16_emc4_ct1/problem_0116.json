            "output": "I need to convert the binary number 10101001110 to base eight. First, I'll separate the binary number into groups of three digits each, starting from the right. \n\nStarting from the right:\n- The binary digits are 101 010 011 10.\n- To make complete triplets, I'll add leading zeros to the leftmost group, resulting in 101 010 011 10 → 010 101 011 10.\n\nNext, I'll convert each triplet from binary to decimal:\n- 010 in binary is 2 in decimal.\n- 101 in binary is 5.\n- 011 is 3.\n- 10 is 2.\n\nFinally, I'll combine these decimal values to get the base eight number. So, the base eight representation is 2 5 3 2, which together makes 2532 in base eight.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right:**\n   \n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n   \n   If necessary, add leading zeros to make complete groups. In this case, the last group has only two digits, so we add one zero to the left:\n   \n   ```\n   010 101 011 10\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert each binary triplet to its decimal equivalent:**\n   \n   - \\(010_{2} = 2_{10}\\)\n   - \\(101_{2} = 5_{10}\\)\n   - \\(011_{2} = 3_{10}\\)\n   - \\(10_{2} = 2_{10}\\)\n\n3. **Combine the decimal equivalents to form the octal number:**\n   \n   ```\n   2\\,5\\,3\\,2_{8}\n   ```\n   \n   So, \\(10101001110_{2}\\) is equal to \\(2532_{8}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{2532_{8}}"
