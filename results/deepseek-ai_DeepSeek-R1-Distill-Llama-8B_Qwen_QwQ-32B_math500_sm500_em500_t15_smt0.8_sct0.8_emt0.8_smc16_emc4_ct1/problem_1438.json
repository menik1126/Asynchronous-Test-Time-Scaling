A number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if it can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nNext, I factorize \\( 2^{24} \\) into its prime components. Since 2 is a prime number, this simplifies to \\( 2^{24} \\). \n\nFor \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\). This means that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nI then list all the positive divisors of 24. These are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. \n\nSince the problem specifies \\( n > 1 \\), I exclude 1, leaving the valid exponents as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. \n\nCounting these, there are 7 valid values of \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition\nA number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that:\n\\[\n2^{24} = k^n\n\\]\nThis implies that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of the exponent 24.\n\n### Step 2: Factorize the Exponent\nThe exponent in \\( 2^{24} \\) is 24. We need to find all divisors \\( n \\) of 24 where \\( n > 1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: List the Divisors of 24\nFirst, factorize 24:\n\\[\n24 = 2^3 \\times 3^1\n\\]\nThe number of divisors of a"
