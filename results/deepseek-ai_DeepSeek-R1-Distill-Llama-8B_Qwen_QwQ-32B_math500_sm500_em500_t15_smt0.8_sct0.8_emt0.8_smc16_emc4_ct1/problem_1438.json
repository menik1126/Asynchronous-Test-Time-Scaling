In this case, \\( 2^{24} \\) needs to be expressed as \\( k^n \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nTo find the possible values of \\( n \\), I'll start by expressing \\( 2^{24} \\) as a product of prime factors. Since 2 is a prime number, \\( 2^{24} \\) can be written as \\( 2^{24} \\).\n\nNext, I'll consider the prime factorization for \\( k^n \\). If \\( k^n = 2^{24} \\), then \\( k \\) must also be a power of 2. Let's express \\( k \\) as \\( 2^m \\), where \\( m \\) is a positive integer.\n\nSubstituting \\( k \\) into the equation gives:\n\\[\n(2^m)^n = 2^{24}\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2^{m \\cdot n} = 2^{24}\n\\]\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore:\n\\[\nm \\cdot n = 24\n\\]\nHere, both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are positive integers, and \\( n > 1 \\). This means \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24 greater than 1.\n\nTo find all possible values of \\( n \\), I'll list the divisors of 24:\n\\[\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\\]\nHowever, since \\( n > 1 \\), I'll exclude 1 from the list:\n\\[\n2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\\]\nEach of these divisors represents a valid exponent \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition \\( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nTherefore, there are "
