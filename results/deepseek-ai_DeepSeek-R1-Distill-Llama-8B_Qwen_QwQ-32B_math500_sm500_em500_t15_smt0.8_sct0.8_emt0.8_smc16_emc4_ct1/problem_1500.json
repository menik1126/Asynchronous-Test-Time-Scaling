These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll identify which of these primes are odd. The number 2 is the only even prime number, so all the others are odd.\n\nThat leaves me with the primes: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nFinally, I'll count these numbers to determine the total number of elements in the intersection.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the two sets:\n\n1. **Set of all prime numbers less than 30:**\n   - These are the prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n\n2. **Set of all odd numbers greater than zero:**\n   - These are the odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29.\n\n3. **Finding the intersection:**\n   - Identify the common elements between the two sets.\n   - The only even prime number is **2**, which is not in the set of odd numbers.\n   - Therefore, all other prime numbers less than 30 are also odd numbers.\n\n4. **Counting the common elements:**\n   - The common elements are: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n   - There are **9** elements in total.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{9}"
