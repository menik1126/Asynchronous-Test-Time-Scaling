Since 284 is an even number, 2 is a divisor.\n\nFactoring 284:\n284 ÷ 2 = 142\n142 ÷ 2 = 71\n71 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2² × 71¹.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors:\nSum of divisors = (2² - 1) × (71¹ + 1) = (4 - 1) × (71 + 1) = 3 × 72 = 216.\n\nNow, subtract 284 from 216 to get the sum of the proper divisors: 216 - 284 = -68. However, since the sum of proper divisors cannot be negative, I should reconsider.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize the correct approach is to consider that if 284 is a prime number, its only proper divisor is 1. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 1.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the sum of the proper divisors of this sum: 1 + 1 = 2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Calculate the sum of the proper divisors of the result from step 1.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284\n\nA **proper divisor** of a number \\( N \\) is a positive divisor of \\( N \\) that is less than \\( N \\).\n\nFirst, factorize 284:\n\\[\n284 = 2 \\times 142 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 71 = 2^2 \\times 71^1\n\\]\n\nThe formula for the sum of all divisors (including \\( N \\) itself) of a number \\( N = p^a \\times q^b \\) is:\n\\[\n(1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^a)(1 + q + q^2 + \\dots + q^b)\n\\]\n\nApplying this formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of all divisors of } 284 = (1 + 2"
