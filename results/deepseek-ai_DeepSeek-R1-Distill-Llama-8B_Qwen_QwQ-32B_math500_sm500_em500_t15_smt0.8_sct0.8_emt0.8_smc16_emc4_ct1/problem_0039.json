Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142.\n\nNext, I'll check if 142 has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 142 divided by 2 is 71, which is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 284 is \\(2^2 \\times 71\\).\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \\((1 + 2 + 4) \\times (1 + 71)\\), the sum of all divisors of 284 is \\(7 \\times 72 = 504\\).\n\nProper divisors exclude the number itself, so the sum of proper divisors of 284 is \\(504 - 284 = 220\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220.\n\nFirst, I'll determine the prime factorization of 220. It's divisible by 2, giving 110. Then, 110 is divisible by 2 again, giving 55, which is \\(5 \\times 11\\).\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 220 is \\(2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11\\).\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula, the sum of all divisors is \\((1 + 2 + 4) \\times (1 + 5) \\times (1 + 11)\\), which calculates to \\(7 \\times 6 \\times 12 = 504\\).\n\nFinally, subtracting 220 from 504 gives the sum of the proper divisors of 220, which is \\(504 - 220 = 284\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Then, find the sum of the proper divisors of the result from step 1.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284**\n\nA **proper divisor** of a number \\( N \\) is a positive divisor of \\( N \\) that is less than \\( N"
