            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the units digit of 4$$, where the superfactorial n$$ is defined as a tower of factorials. Specifically, 4$$ would be something like 4!^(4!^(...)) with n=4. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the superfactorial for a number n is a very large value, especially as n increases. For n=4, it's going to be 4! raised to the power of itself multiple times, but since n=4, I think it's only three levels deep? Wait, no, actually, the notation might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem says n$$ is defined as n! raised to the power of n! raised to the power of ... n! times n! levels. So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). That's a lot, but I don't need the actual value, just the units digit. So, I need to compute the units digit of 4$$.\n\nI remember that for units digits, modular arithmetic, specifically mod 10, is useful. So, if I can find 4$$ mod 10, that will give me the units digit.\n\nBut calculating 4$$ directly is impossible because it's way too large. So, I need to find a pattern or a cycle in the units digits when dealing with factorials and exponents.\n\nLet me start by computing the smaller levels and see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst, compute 4!:\n\n4! = 24. The units digit is 4.\n\nSo, the innermost part of 4$$ is 4! = 24. Then, moving out, it's 24^(24^(...)).\n\nWait, that seems recursive. So, after the first step, 4$$ becomes 4!^(4$$), but wait, no, actually, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!))... and it's 4 levels, right? Because n is 4, so the tower has n levels. So, 4 levels of exponents? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the notation is underbrace{n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}} with the number"

So for n=4, the number of terms in the tower is 4! = 24. So the superfactorial 4$$ is a tower of 24 copies of 4! (which is 24) exponentiated. So, it's 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24. That's an astronomically large number. But again, we just need the units digit.\n\nHmm, so the problem reduces to finding the units digit of 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24 in the exponent tower. Since the base is 24, which has a units digit of 4, the problem becomes finding the units digit of 4 raised to some exponent tower. Wait, but actually, the base is 24, so the units digit of the base is 4, so the units digit of the entire expression will depend on the exponent's value mod 4, because the units digit cycles every 4 for powers of 4? Wait, let me recall Euler's theorem.\n\nEuler's theorem states that if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n. \u03c6(10) is 4, since the numbers coprime to 10 are 1,3,7,9. But 4 and 10 are not coprime, so Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the units digit of powers of 4 cycles every 2: 4^1=4, 4^2=16 (units digit 6), 4^3=64 (4), 4^4=256 (6), so the cycle is 4,6,4,6,... with period 2. So, the units digit of 4^k depends on whether k is even or odd. If k is even, it's 6;"

            "output": " if k is odd, it's 4.\n\nTherefore, to find the units digit of 24^k, we just need to know if k is even or odd. Since 24 is even, any exponent on 24 will result in an even number. But when we're raising 24 to some exponent, the result will be even, and since 24 ends with 4, the units digit of the result will cycle between 4 and 6 depending on the exponent's parity.\n\nWait, but in our case, 4$$ is 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 levels. So, essentially, the exponent is another tower of 24's. So, to compute the units digit of 4$$, which is the units digit of 24^(E), where E is the exponent tower of 24's.\n\nSince 24 has a units digit of 4, the units digit of 24^E depends on the units digit of E. Because, as established, units digit of 4^k cycles every 2. So, if E is even, 4^E ends with 6; if E is odd, ends with 4.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find whether E is even or odd.\n\nBut E is itself 24^(24^(...)) with 23 levels (since the tower has n! = 24 levels for n=4). Wait, no, actually, in the tower, the number of levels is 24, not 23. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the superfactorial is defined as n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}} with a total of n! levels. So for n=4, it's 24 levels. So, E is a tower of 24's with 24 levels.\n\nNow, to check if E is even or odd, we can look at the exponent tower starting from the top. But 24 is even, and any power of an even number is even, so E is even. Therefore, E is even.\n\nTherefore, the exponent E in 24^E is even, so the units digit of 24^E is 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4$$ is 6.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me verify this because I might be skipping steps. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst"

Let's denote the tower as T = 24^(24^(...^24)) with 24 levels.\n\nTo find T mod 10, we can use the fact that the units digit cycles with period 4 for exponents when the base is coprime to 10, but since 24 and 10 are not coprime, maybe we need to use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the base is 24, which ends with 4, the units digit of 24^k depends on k mod 2, as 4 cycles every 2. So, as before, if the exponent is even, units digit is 6; if odd, 4.\n\nTherefore, to find T mod 10, we need to compute the exponent part (the tower above the first 24) mod 2, because 4^(even) mod 10 is 6, and 4^(odd) mod 10 is 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the base is 24, so 24 mod 10 is 4, so 24^k mod 10 is equivalent to 4^k mod 10. Therefore, yes, the units digit of 24^k is the same as 4^k mod 10, so the exponent's parity determines the result.\n\nTherefore, the exponent E (the tower above the first 24) is 24^(24^(...^24)) with 23 levels. Since 24 is even, any tower of exponents with 24's will be even, so E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6. Therefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller tower to see if this holds.\n\nSuppose we have a tower of 2 levels: 24^24. The exponent is 24, which is even, so 24^24 mod 10 is 4^24 mod 10. Since 24 is"
