            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about the superfactorial, which is defined as n\\$, and I need to find the units digit of 4\\$. Hmm, I remember that the superfactorial is a tower of factorials, right? So, for example, 4\\$ would be 4!^{4!^{...}} with four 4!s stacked on top. Wait, actually, no, let me check the definition again. It says n\\$ is n! raised to the power of n! raised to the power of n!, and so on, n! times. So, for 4\\$, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}, which is four 4!s stacked. That makes sense.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what 4! is. 4 factorial is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 24. So, 4! is 24. Now, 4\\$ is 24 raised to the power of 24, but then that is raised to the power of 24 again, and that is raised to the power of 24 one more time. So, it's 24^(24^(24^24)). That's a massive number, but I just need the units digit, so maybe I can find a pattern or use modular arithmetic to simplify it.\n\nI remember that the units digit of a number is the same as the number modulo 10. So, if I can find 4\\$ mod 10, that will give me the units digit. To compute this, I can break it down step by step.\n\nLet me start from the top of the tower and work my way down. The tower is 24^(24^(24^24)). Let's denote the exponent as E = 24^(24^24). So, 4\\$ = 24^E. I need to find 24^E mod 10.\n\nFirst, 24 mod 10 is 4, so 24 \u2261 4 mod 10. Therefore, 24^E \u2261 4^E mod 10. Now, I need to find 4^E mod 10. The units digit of 4 raised to some power cycles in a pattern. Let's recall that 4^1 = 4, 4^2 = 16 (units digit 6), 4^3 ="

Therefore, to find 4^E mod 10, I need to find E mod 2, since if E is even, it's 6 mod 10, and odd would be 4 mod 10? Wait, let's verify:\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf exponent is 1: 4^1 = 4 (units digit 4)\nExponent 2: 16 (6)\nExponent 3: 4^3=64 (4)\nExponent 4: 256 (6)... yeah, so cycle length 2. So the units digit is 4 if exponent is odd, 6 if even. Therefore, to find 4^E mod 10, we just need to know if E is even or odd. Since 24^anything is always even, except maybe 0? Wait, 24^something is 24 to any positive exponent is certainly even. So E = 24^(24^24). Since 24^24 is a positive integer, so 24^(something) is even. Therefore E is even. Therefore 4^E mod 10 would be 6. Wait, but hold on, let me check that again.\n\nWait, if E is even, then 4^even mod10 is 6? Yes, because 2 exponents cycle, so even exponents give 6, odd give 4. Since E is even, so the result is 6. Wait, but let me not jump to conclusions here. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again. Let me retrace:\n\n4\\$ = 24^(24^(24^24)). Let me call the exponent tower starting from the top as follows:\n\nLet me define the tower from the top down:\n\nLet me call the innermost exponent as a = 24^24.

So maybe I should define it more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the exponents step by step, starting from the top. So the tower is 24^(24^(24^24)). Let me compute from the top down.\n\nLet me compute a = 24^24 first.\n\nCompute a = 24^24. But 24 mod something? Wait, if I need to compute 24^24 mod something, perhaps. Wait, but I need to find 24^(24^(24^24)) mod 10, as per earlier.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to compute 24^(24^(24^24)) mod 10. Since 24 \u2261 4 mod 10, so it's equivalent to 4^(24^(24^24)) mod 10. Then, as before, 4 has a cycle of 2, so we need to find the exponent 24^(24^24) mod 2, because the cycle length is 2. So, 4^k mod10 is 4 if k is odd, 6 if k is even. So to determine which one it is, I need to find whether the exponent k = 24^(24^24) is even or odd.\n\nWell, 24 is even, so 24 raised to any positive integer power is still even. Because 24 is even, and any power of an even number is even. So 24^(24^24) is even, meaning k is even. Therefore, 4^k mod10 is 6. Therefore, 4\\$ has units digit 6.\n\nWait, but let me challenge this conclusion. Let me see, since 4^k mod10 is 6 when k is even, but could there be a higher modulo involved? Because 4^k mod10 is dependent on k mod 2, so we can say that as long as k is even, 4^k mod10 is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps"

So Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. So maybe my initial approach is okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of mod 10 as mod 2 and mod 5, then use Chinese remainder theorem. Let me try that approach as a check.\n\nFirst, compute 4\\$ mod 2 and mod 5, then combine them.\n\nStarting with mod 2:\n\n4\\$ is 24^(24^(24^24)). Since 24 is even, 24 mod 2 is 0.

Let's see.\n\nFirst, 24 mod5 is 4, since 25 is 0 mod5, so 24 \u2261 -1 mod5. So 24 \u22614 mod5. So 24 \u22614 mod5. So 24^anything mod5 is equivalent to 4^anything mod5.

Since 4 and 5 are coprime, \u03c6(5)=4. So 4^4 \u22611 mod5. Therefore, 4^E mod5 = 4^(E mod4) mod5.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute E mod4, where E =24^(24^24).\n\nSo first compute E mod4.

Therefore, 4^E mod5=4^(0) mod5=1.\n\nWait, because 4^(4) \u22611 mod5, so 4^(4k)\u22611^k=1 mod5. So if E is a multiple of 4, then 4^E \u22611 mod5.\n\nSo, from mod5, 4\\$ \u22611 mod5.\n\nNow, from mod2, it's 0. So we have 4\\$ \u22610 mod2 and \u22611 mod5. Now, we can use Chinese remainder theorem to find the number congruent to 0 mod2 and 1 mod5. Let's find a number x \u22611 mod5 and \u22610 mod2.\n\nPossible numbers are 6,16,26,36, etc. So the units digit would be 6, because 6 mod10 is 6, which is 0 mod2 and 1 mod5. So the units digit is 6. Therefore, both approaches give me units digit 6.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So 4\\$ \u22616 mod10, so units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes when we have cycles, especially when dealing with exponents, it's easy to make mistakes.\n\nWait, let me go back to the initial step. So 4\\$ is 24^(24^(24^24)). 24 mod10 is 4, so 24^E mod10 is 4^E mod10. The cycle for 4 is periods of 2: 4,6,4,6... So exponent E determines whether it's 4 or 6.\n\nE is 24^(24^24). But 24 is even, so any power of 24 is even, so E is even. Therefore, 4^even mod10 is 6. So units digit is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the exponents step by step more carefully.\n\nLet me compute from the top:\n\nStart with the top exponent: 24^24.

So from our earlier reasoning, since E =24^(24^24) is even, then 4^E mod10 is 6.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So therefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but let me try another angle. Let's compute the exponent E modulo 2 and modulo 4, to see if it holds up.\n\nFirst, compute E =24^(24^24).\n\nCompute E mod2: 24 is 0 mod2, so 24^k mod2 is 0 for any positive k. So E is 0 mod2.\n\nCompute E mod4: 24 is 0 mod4, so 24^k mod4 is 0 for any k>=1. So E is 0 mod4.\n\nTherefore, E is divisible by 4, meaning E=4m for some integer m.\n\nSo, 4^E mod10 is 4^(4m) mod10.

Wait, no, because 4^4 is 256, which is 6 mod10, and 4^8 is (4^4)^2=256^2= (mod10) 6^2=36, so 6 again.

Since E is even, so E=2k. Then 4^E = (4^2)^k = 16^k mod10. Since 16 mod10 is 6, so 6^k mod10. Now, 6 raised to any power is always 6 mod10. So 6^k mod10 is 6. Therefore, regardless of k, it's 6. Therefore, 4^E mod10 is 6. So that's another way to see it.\n\nAh, that's a good point. Since 4^2 = 16, which ends with 6, and any power of a number ending with 6 will also end with 6. So once you have 4^2, which is 16, then 4^E where E is even can be written as (4^2)^{E/2} = 16^{E/2}, and since 16^anything ends with 6, so the result is 6 mod10.
