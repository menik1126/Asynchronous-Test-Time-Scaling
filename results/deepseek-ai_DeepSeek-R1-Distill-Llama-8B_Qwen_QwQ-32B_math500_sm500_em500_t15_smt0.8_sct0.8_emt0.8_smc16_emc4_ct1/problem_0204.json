            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials, especially with integer coefficients, the Rational Root Theorem can be helpful. I think it says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(p/q\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the leading coefficient is 1 because the \\(x^4\\) term has a coefficient of 1, and the constant term is -14.\n\nSo, if I apply the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of -14 divided by the factors of 1. That means the possible integer roots are just the factors of -14, right? Let me list them out: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. These are the possible integer roots I need to test.\n\nAlright, so I should plug each of these into the equation and see if the result is zero. Let's start with x=1.\n\nPlugging in 1:\n\\(1^4 + 5*1^3 + 9*1^2 - 1 - 14\\)\nCalculates to:\n1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14 = 1 +5 is 6, 6+9 is 15, 15-1 is 14, 14-14 is 0. Oh, so x=1 is a root!\n\nGreat, so (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. Now, maybe I can factor it out using polynomial division or synthetic division. Let me try synthetic division with x=1.\n\nSetting up synthetic division:\n\n1 | 1  5  9  -1  -14\n        1   6   15   14\n    -------------------\n      1  6  15   14    0\n\nSo, the result is the coefficients 1, 6, 15, 14, and the remainder is 0, as expected. That means the polynomial can be factored as (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + "

The possible integer roots are factors of 14: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nLet me test x=1 again.\n\nPlugging in 1:\n1 + 6 + 15 + 14 = 1+6=7, 7+15=22, 22+14=36. Not zero.\n\nx=-1:\n-1 + 6*(-1)^2 + 15*(-1) + 14\n= -1 + 6*1 + (-15) +14\n= -1 +6 is 5, 5 -15 is -10, -10 +14 is 4. Not zero.\n\nx=-2:\n-8 + 6*4 +15*(-2) +14\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, x=-2, so let me compute step by step.\n\n(-2)^3 is -8, 6*(-2)^2 is 6*4=24, 15*(-2) is -30, and constant is 14.\n\nAdding them up: -8 +24 is 16, 16 -30 is -14, -14 +14 is 0. So x=-2 is a root.\n\nNice! So, (x + 2) is a factor. Let me perform synthetic division again on the cubic.\n\n-2 | 1  6  15  14\n        -2   -8  -14\n      1  4    7    0\n\nSo the cubic factors into (x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7).\n\nNow, we have the original polynomial factored as (x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7). The quadratic factor is \\(x^2 + 4x + 7\\). Let me check if this quadratic has any real roots.\n\nThe discriminant is \\(b^2 - 4ac = 16 - 28 = -12\\), which is negative, so there are no real roots, let alone integer roots. So, the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nWait, let me"

Let me see, but wait, perhaps I skipped some factors.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought the possible roots for the cubic were ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14, as the constant term is 14.\n\nI tested x=1, which didn't work, x=-1 didn't work, x=-2 worked, so maybe that's the only one. Let me check x=7 quickly.\n\nx=7:\n7^3 + 6*7^2 + 15*7 +14\n343 + 6*49 is 343 + 294 = 637, plus 15*7 is 105: 637 + 105 = 742, plus 14 is 756. Not zero.\n\nx=-7:\n(-7)^3 is -343, 6*(-7)^2 is 6*49=294, 15*(-7)= -105, +14.\n\nSo adding up: -343 +294 = -49, -49 -105=-154, -154 +14 = -140.
