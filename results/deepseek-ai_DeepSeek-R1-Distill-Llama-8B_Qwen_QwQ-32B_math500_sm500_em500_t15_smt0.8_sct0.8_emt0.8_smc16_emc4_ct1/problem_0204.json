I remember that one way to approach this is by using the Rational Root Theorem. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients must have a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are just the factors of -14, which are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). Since we're specifically looking for integer roots, we can ignore the fraction part and just focus on these integers.\n\nAlright, so I have a list of possible roots to test: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14. Let me start by testing each of these to see if they satisfy the equation \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I'll plug each value into the equation and see if it equals zero.\n\nFirst, let's test \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 4\\). Hmm, that's not zero. So, 1 is not a root.\n\nNext, \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14 = -8\\). Not zero either.\n\nOkay, moving on to \\(x = 2\\):\n\\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14 = 76\\). Nope, that's too big.\n\nHow about \\(x ="

Now, maybe we can factor this out of the polynomial to find the other roots. If -2 is a root, then \\((x + 2)\\) is a factor. So, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to divide the original polynomial by \\((x + 2)\\).\n\nI think synthetic division might be quicker here. Let me set it up. The coefficients of the original polynomial are: 1 (for \\(x^4\\)), 5 (for \\(x^3\\)), 9 (for \\(x^2\\)), -1 (for \\(x\\)), and -14 (constant term). The root we found is -2, so we'll use -2 in synthetic division.\n\nSetting up synthetic division:\n\n-2 | 1   5   9   -1   -14\n     |     -2   -6   -6    14\n     -------------------------\n       1   3    3   -7     0\n\nWait, let me double-check that:\n\nStart by bringing down the 1. Multiply 1 by -2 to get -2. Add to the next coefficient: 5 + (-2) = 3.\n\nMultiply 3 by -2 to get -6. Add to the next coefficient: 9 + (-6) = 3.\n\nMultiply 3 by -2 to get -6. Add to the next coefficient: -1 + (-6) = -7.\n\nMultiply -7 by -2 to get 14. Add to the last coefficient: -14 + 14 = 0. Perfect, no remainder.\n\nSo, after dividing by \\((x + 2)\\), the polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x - 7\\). So, the equation can be factored as \\((x + 2)(x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x - 7) = 0\\).

Let's test each of these.\n\nStarting with \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^3 + 3(1)^2 + 3(1) - 7 = 1 + 3 + 3 - 7 = 0\\). Hey, that's zero! So, 1 is a root.\n\nGreat, so \\(x = 1\\) is another integer root. Now, we can factor out \\((x - 1)\\) from the cubic polynomial. Let me use synthetic division again.\n\n1 | 1   3   3   -7\n     |     1   4   7\n     -----------------\n       1   4   7   0\n\nSo, the cubic polynomial factors into \\((x - 1)(x^2 + 4x + 7)\\). Therefore, the original polynomial is now factored as \\((x + 2)(x - 1)(x^2 + 4x + 7) = 0\\).\n\nNow, we have a quadratic factor left: \\(x^2 + 4x + 7\\). To find the roots of this quadratic, we can use the quadratic formula, which is \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = 7\\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant: \\(b^2 - 4ac = 16 - 28 = -12\\). Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots, let alone integer ones. So, the quadratic factor doesn't contribute any integer roots.\n\nTherefore, the only integer roots of the original equation are the ones we found: -2 and 1.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible integer roots. I remember that the Rational Root Theorem gives the possible candidates, but just to be thorough, let me check if any other values from my initial list might actually work. I've tested 1, -1, 2,"

Maybe I should double-check those in case I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I factored out (x + 2), I reduced the original quartic to a cubic, and then factoring out (x - 1) from the cubic, I had the quadratic left. So, those higher possible roots (7, -7, 14, -14) were already factors of the original quartic, but after factoring out (x + 2)(x - 1), the remaining quadratic doesn't have those as roots. So, perhaps they aren't necessary to check again. Let me test x = 7 in the original equation just to be safe.\n\nTesting x = 7 in the original equation:\n\\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14 = 2401 + 5*343 + 9*49 - 7 -14\\). Let's compute each term:\n\n7^4 = 2401\n\n5*7^3 = 5*343 = 1715\n\n9*7^2 = 9*49 = 441\n\nSo adding them up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116; 4116 + 441 = 4557.\n\nThen subtract 7 and 14: 4557 - 21 = 4536. Definitely not zero. So, 7 isn't a root.\n\nWhat about x = -7:\n\n\\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) -14 = 2401 - 5*343 + 9*49 +7 -14\\).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2401\n\n-5*343 = -1715\n\n9*49 = 441\n\n-14 + 7 is -7.\n\nSo, 2401 - 1715 = 686; 686 + 441 = 1127; 1127 - 7 = 1120.

So, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nIn the first step, I tested x=1: 1^4 +5*1 +9*1 -1 -14. That's 1 +5 +9 -1 -14.\n\n1 +5 is 6, 6 +9 is 15, 15 -1 is 14, 14 -14 is 0. So, x=1 is a root.

So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the initial testing, when I thought x=1 gave 4, that was a mistake because I miscalculated. So, that was an error, but upon recalculating, it does equal zero.\n\nSo, that means both -2 and 1 are indeed integer roots.
