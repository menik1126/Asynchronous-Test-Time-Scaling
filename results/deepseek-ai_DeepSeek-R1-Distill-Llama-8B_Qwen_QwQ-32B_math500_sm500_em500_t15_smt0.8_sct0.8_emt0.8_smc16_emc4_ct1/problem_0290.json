The given complex numbers are \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i \\) and \\( c = 2 - 3i \\). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that rotating a complex number around another complex number isn't just a simple multiplication by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) because that would rotate it around the origin. Instead, I need to translate the system so that \\( c \\) becomes the origin, perform the rotation, and then translate back. That makes sense because rotation around a point other than the origin involves translating the point to the origin, rotating, and then translating back.\n\nSo, the formula for rotating \\( z \\) around \\( c \\) by an angle \\( \\theta \\) should be:\n\\[ w = c + (z - c) \\cdot e^{i\\theta} \\]\nRight? Because \\( z - c \\) moves \\( z \\) to the origin relative to \\( c \\), then multiplying by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) rotates it, and then adding \\( c \\) brings it back.\n\nAlright, let me write that down more explicitly:\n1. Find the translation of \\( z \\) by subtracting \\( c \\): \\( z - c \\)\n2. Multiply this by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) where \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\)\n3. Then add \\( c \\) back to the result to get \\( w \\)\n\nFirst, let me compute \\( z - c \\). Given \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i \\) and \\( c = 2 - 3i \\), subtracting \\( c \\) from \\( z \\) should be:\n\\[ z - c = (2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) \\]\nLet me compute this term by term. The real parts are \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\) and subtracting \\( 2 \\),"
