Hmm, I remember that in complex numbers, rotation can be done by multiplying by a rotation factor. Let me recall the formula for rotating a point around another point. \n\nFirst, I think to rotate a complex number z around another complex number c by an angle \u03b8, you can translate the system so that c becomes the origin, rotate z by \u03b8, and then translate back. So, mathematically, this should be something like:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^(i\u03b8)\n\nWhere \u03b8 is \u03c0/4 in this case. Okay, so let me write that down.\n\nGiven:\nz = 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3*sqrt(2))i\nc = 2 - 3i\n\nSo, first, I need to compute z - c. Let's subtract c from z.\n\nz - c = (2 + sqrt(2) - 3i) - (2 - 3i)\nWait, hold on, no. Let me correct that. Let me write out the complex numbers properly.\n\nz is 2 + sqrt(2) minus (3 + 3*sqrt(2))i. So in standard form, that's:\nz = (2 + sqrt(2)) + (-3 - 3*sqrt(2))i\n\nc is 2 - 3i, so in standard form:\nc = 2 + (-3)i\n\nTherefore, z - c is:\n\n(2 + sqrt(2) - 2) + (-3 - 3*sqrt(2) + 3)i\n\nSimplify that:\n\nsqrt(2) + (-3 - 3*sqrt(2))i\n\nWait, is that right? Let me do it step by step.\n\nReal parts: (2 + sqrt(2)) - 2 = sqrt(2)\nImaginary parts: (-3 - 3*sqrt(2))i - (-3)i = (-3 - 3*sqrt(2) + 3)i = (-3*sqrt(2))i\n\nSo z - c is sqrt(2) - 3*sqrt(2)i\n\nSo z - c = sqrt(2) - 3*sqrt(2)i\n\nAlternatively, that can be factored as"

            "output": " sqrt(2)*(1 - 3i). Hmm, that might be useful later.\n\nNow, we need to rotate this vector (z - c) by \u03c0/4 radians counter-clockwise. The rotation factor for an angle \u03b8 is e^(i\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8. Since it's \u03c0/4, cos(\u03c0/4) = sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2. So the rotation factor is (sqrt(2)/2 + i*sqrt(2)/2).\n\nTherefore, multiplying (z - c) by this rotation factor will give the rotated vector. Then, adding back c will give w.\n\nSo let me compute (z - c) * e^(i\u03c0/4):\n\nFirst, let me write (z - c) as sqrt(2)*(1 - 3i). So:\n\nsqrt(2)*(1 - 3i) * [cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4)]\n\nSince cos(\u03c0/4) = sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2, so substituting:\n\nsqrt(2)*(1 - 3i) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i*sqrt(2)/2)\n\nLet me compute this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply sqrt(2) with the rotation factor:\n\nsqrt(2) * [sqrt(2)/2 + i*sqrt(2)/2] = sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)*i*sqrt(2)/2\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so:\n\n2/2 + i*2/2 = 1 + i\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(1 - 3i)*(1 + i)\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. Wait, actually, the sqrt(2) is part of (z - c), so the multiplication is:\n\nsqrt(2)*(1 - 3i) multiplied by (sqrt(2)/2 + i*sqrt(2)/2). Let me do it term by term.\n\nLet me denote A = sqrt(2)*(1 - 3i), and B = (sqrt(2)/2 + i*sqrt(2)/2). Then A * B is:\n\nsqrt(2)*(1 - 3i) * sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)*(1 - 3i)*i*"

So first term is 1*(1 - 3i) = 1 - 3i\n\nSecond term: sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)*i*(1 - 3i) = same as above, 2/2*i*(1 - 3i) = i*(1 - 3i)\n\nSo second term is i - 3i^2. Since i^2 = -1, so this is i + 3.\n\nTherefore, adding the two terms together:\n\nFirst term: 1 - 3i\n\nSecond term: i + 3\n\nAdding them:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n-3i + i = -2i\n\nSo total is 4 - 2i.\n\nSo the rotated vector is 4 - 2i.

Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, computing z - c:\n\nz = 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i = (2 + sqrt(2)) + (-3 - 3 sqrt(2))i\n\nc = 2 - 3i = 2 + (-3)i\n\nTherefore, z - c is:\n\nReal: 2 + sqrt(2) - 2 = sqrt(2)\n\nImaginary: (-3 - 3 sqrt(2)) - (-3) = (-3 - 3 sqrt(2) + 3) = -3 sqrt(2)\n\nSo z - c = sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2)i.

I think I did this correctly.\n\nWait, alternatively, another way is to factor sqrt(2) from z - c:\n\nz - c = sqrt(2)*(1 - 3i)\n\nThen multiply by (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i)\n\nSo sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 (1 - 3i)(1 + i) = (2)/2 (1 - 3i)(1 + i) = 1*(1 + i - 3i -3i^2)\n\nCompute (1 - 3i)(1 + i):\n\n1*1 + 1*i -3i*1 -3i*i = 1 + i -3i -3i^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 - 2i -3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 1 - 2i +3 = 4 - 2i\n\nSo yes, same result. Then adding c: 4 - 2i + 2 -3i = 6 -5i\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but let me confirm once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not factor anything but just do the multiplication directly.\n\nCompute (sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2)i) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2)\n\nMultiply each term:\n\nsqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = (2)/2 = 1\n\nsqrt(2)*i sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(2)*i sqrt(2)/2 = (2i)/2 = i\n\n-3 sqrt(2)i * sqrt(2)/2 = -3*(2)i /2 = -3i\n\n-3 sqrt(2)i * i sqrt(2)/2 = -3*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2)*i^2 = -3*2/2*(-1) = -3*(-1) = 3\n\nSo now, sum all terms:\n\n1 (from first term) \n\n+ i (from second term)\n\n-3i (from third term)\n\n+3 (from fourth term)\n\nSo 1 + 3 = 4\n\ni -3i = -2i\n\nThus, total is 4 - 2i"

Let me check if the coordinates make sense.\n\nIn the Asymptote code, point Z is defined as (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3*sqrt(2)), and point C is (2, -3). So in the complex plane, Z is at (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3 sqrt(2)) and C is at (2, -3).\n\nWait, so when you rotate Z around C by \u03c0/4, you should get W.\n\nBut according to my calculation, w = 6 -5i, which as coordinates would be (6, -5).\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nWait, the Asymptote code seems to plot Z as (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3 sqrt(2)), so real part is 2 + sqrt(2), imaginary part is -3 - 3 sqrt(2). So in complex number terms, that's z = 2 + sqrt(2) + (-3 - 3 sqrt(2))i, which is consistent with what's given. Then c is (2, -3), which is 2 -3i.\n\nSo w is the rotation of z around c by pi/4. So when I computed w, I got 6 -5i, so coordinates (6, -5). Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me see: the translation of vector from c to z is sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2)i, whose coordinates are (sqrt(2), -3 sqrt(2)). Rotating this vector by 45 degrees (pi/4) should give (sqrt(2) cos(pi/4) - (-3 sqrt(2)) sin(pi/4), sqrt(2) sin(pi/4) + (-3 sqrt(2)) cos(pi/4)).\n\nWait, cos(pi/4) and sin(pi/4) are both sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo:\n\nx' = sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) - (-3 sqrt(2))*(sqrt(2)/2)\n\n= (2)/2 + (3*2)/2\n\n= 1"
