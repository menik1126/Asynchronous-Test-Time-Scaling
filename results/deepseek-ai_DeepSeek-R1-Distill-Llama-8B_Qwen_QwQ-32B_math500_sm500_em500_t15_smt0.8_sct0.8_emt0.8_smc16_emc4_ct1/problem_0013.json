            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about polynomials, and I need to find P(5). Let me just write down what's given to get a clear picture.\n\nFirst off, P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so it should look something like P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants that I need to find.\n\nIt's given that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Hmm, okay. So R(x) is the remainder when divided by a quadratic, which means R(x) is a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) should be something like mx + n, where m and n are constants.\n\nAlso, we know that P(0) = 5. Since P(x) is x³ + ax² + bx + c, plugging in x=0 gives c = 5. So that's one constant down.\n\nSo, let's start by considering the first division. When P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is a quadratic, the remainder R(x) is linear. So, we can express this as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nWhere Q1(x) is the quotient polynomial, which is a first-degree polynomial since P(x) is cubic and the divisor is quadratic. So Q1(x) should be linear, like dx + e.\n\nSimilarly, for the second division, P(x) divided by (x - 2)(x - 3) gives a remainder of 2R(x). So,\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nAgain, Q2(x) is a linear polynomial, say fx + g.\n\nBut wait, I don't know if Q1(x) and Q2(x) are related. Maybe I'll come back to that later.\n\nSince R(x) is the remainder when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), it must satisfy that R(1) = P(1"

R(1) = P(1)\n2. R(4) = P(4)\n3. 2R(2) = P(2)\n4. 2R(3) = P(3)\n\nSince R(x) is linear, let me denote R(x) = mx + n. Then, substituting into these equations:\n\n1. m(1) + n = P(1)\n2. m(4) + n = P(4)\n3. 2(m(2) + n) = P(2)\n4. 2(m(3) + n) = P(3)\n\nBut also, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, I can write P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + 5 (since c=5). Therefore, I can compute P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) in terms of a and b.\n\nLet me compute each of these:\n\nP(1) = 1³ + a(1)² + b(1) + 5 = 1 + a + b + 5 = a + b + 6\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = 4a + 2b + 13\n\nP(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 = 9a + 3b + 32\n\nP(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 16a + 4b + 69\n\nNow, substituting into the equations from the remainders:\n\n1. m + n = a + b + 6\n2. 4m + n = 16a + 4b + 69\n3. 2*(2m + n) = 4a + 2b + 13\n4. 2*(3m + n) = 9a + 3b + 32"
