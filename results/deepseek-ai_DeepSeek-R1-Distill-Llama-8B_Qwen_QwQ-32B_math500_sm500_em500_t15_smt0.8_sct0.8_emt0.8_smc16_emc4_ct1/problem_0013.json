Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So, \\( P(x) \\) looks like \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants we might need to find.\n\nThe problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). And when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we're given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, since polynomials are involved and remainders when divided by other polynomials, I think the Remainder Theorem might be useful here. The Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - a) \\), the remainder is \\( P(a) \\). But here, we are dividing by quadratic polynomials, not linear ones. So, I think the generalization of the remainder theorem applies here.\n\nWhen a polynomial is divided by a quadratic polynomial, say \\( (x - a)(x - b) \\), the remainder will be a linear polynomial, which can be written as \\( Rx + S \\). So, in this case, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) = rx + s \\). Similarly, when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) = 2rx + 2s \\).\n\nSo, we have two division statements:\n\n1. \\( P(x) = Q_1(x)(x - 1)(x - 4) + R(x) \\)\n2. \\( P(x) = Q_2(x)(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2R(x) \\)\n\nWhere \\( Q_1(x) \\) and \\( Q"
