            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number satisfying ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. These roots satisfy the equation ω³ - 1 = 0, which can be factored as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. So, the non-real roots ω and ω² satisfy ω² + ω + 1 = 0. Maybe this equation will come in handy later.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). To simplify this, I can try to combine the two fractions into a single fraction. To do that, I'll need a common denominator.\n\nThe denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me write that out:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ].\n\nSimplifying the numerator: (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nThe denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me multiply that out:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nWait, but I remember that ω³ = 1 from the problem statement. So, ω³ = 1, which means I can substitute that in:\n\nDenominator becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo now the expression is [2 + ω + ω²] / [2 + ω + ω²]. Hmm, that's interesting. The numerator and the denominator are the same, so the entire expression simplifies to 1.\n\nBut wait, that can't be"

            "output": " right. Let me double-check my steps because it's surprising that it's equal to 1 for all ω. Maybe I made a mistake while expanding the denominator.\n\nLet me redo the denominator:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω².\n\nSo, that's 1 + ω² + ω + ω³. Since ω³ = 1, this becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω². Correct, so that part is right.\n\nThe numerator is also 2 + ω + ω², so indeed, it's [2 + ω + ω²]/[2 + ω + ω²] = 1.\n\nBut wait, if that's the case, then regardless of ω being ω or ω², the expression always equals 1. So, does that mean the only possible value is 1?\n\nHmm, maybe. Let me test with specific values. Let's choose ω = e^(2πi/3) which is a primitive cube root of unity. So, ω = -1/2 + i√3/2. Let's compute each term.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω): 1/(1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2)) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2) = 2/(1 + i√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):\n\n2*(1 - i√3)/[(1 + i√3)(1 - i√3)] = 2*(1 - i√3)/(1 + 3) = 2*(1 - i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute 1/(1 + ω²). Since ω² is the other primitive root, which is the complex conjugate of ω, so ω² = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1 - 1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2) = 2/(1 - i√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i√3):\n\n2*(1 + i√3)/(1 + 3) = 2*(1 + i√3)/4 ="

Let me try with ω = 1 just to see what happens. If ω = 1, then ω² = 1 as well because 1 is a cube root of unity.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Interesting, even when ω = 1, the expression is 1.\n\nBut wait, is that allowed? The original problem says ω³ = 1, so ω = 1 is also a solution, but the other roots are ω ≠ 1. So, does the expression evaluate to 1 in all cases, whether ω is 1, ω, or ω²?\n\nYes, as I showed, both when ω is 1 and when ω is the primitive roots, the expression evaluates to 1. So, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut wait, this seems too straightforward. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using properties of cube roots of unity.\n\nWe know that 1 + ω + ω² = 0 for ω ≠ 1. So, 1 + ω = -ω², and 1 + ω² = -ω.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(-ω²) = -1/ω².\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.\n\nSo, the expression becomes -1/ω² - 1/ω.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nExpression = -1/ω² - 1/ω.\n\nI can factor out -1: Expression = - (1/ω + 1/ω²).\n\nNow, 1/ω is equal to ω² because ω³ = 1 implies ω^{-1} = ω². Similarly, 1/ω² = ω.\n\nTherefore, Expression = - (ω² + ω).\n\nBut from the equation 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we know that ω + ω²"

Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity we take (except maybe 1?), but even when ω is 1, we saw that it still works. Wait, but when ω is 1, then 1 + ω = 2, so 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2, and similarly for the other term, so 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, indeed, even when ω is 1, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nHmm, so the problem says \"all possible values\", but since the expression is always 1 regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, then the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we let ω be a primitive cube root of unity, so ω ≠ 1. Then, since ω³ = 1, we can use the relation ω² = -ω -1. Let me substitute that into the denominators.\n\nFirst term: 1/(1 + ω). The second term is 1/(1 + ω²). Since ω² = -ω -1, substitute into the second denominator:\n\n1 + ω² = 1 + (-ω -1) = -ω. So, the second term is 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.\n\nSimilarly, the first term is 1/(1 + ω). Let me see if I can express that in terms of ω as well. Since 1 + ω = -ω² (from 1 + ω + ω² =0), so 1/(1 + ω) = -1/ω².\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes -1/ω² -1/ω. Which is the same as before. Then, since 1/ω is ω² and 1/ω² is ω, so substituting:\n\n- (ω² + ω) = -(-1) = 1. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using substitution variables. Let me set S = 1/(1 + ω"

Since 1 + ω = -ω² as before.\n\nAnother approach, maybe rationalize the denominators by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate or something similar.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier when I substituted ω and ω². So, I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that over the field of complex numbers, 1/(1 + ω) and 1/(1 + ω²) can be represented in terms of ω, and then adding them up cancels the complex parts.\n\nBut I think I have sufficient confirmation that the expression equals 1 regardless of the cube root of unity chosen.\n\nBut perhaps I should think about the general case for roots of unity. Suppose I have a root of unity of order n, say ζ, then expressions like 1/(1 + ζ) might have certain properties. But in this case, specifically, when it's a cube root, and the expression simplifies to 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using symmetric sums or Vieta's formulas.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me denote a = 1/(1 + ω) and b = 1/(1 + ω²). Then, the expression is a + b. Let me compute ab:\n\nab = [1/(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].\n\nEarlier, we found that (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 2 + ω + ω². So, ab = 1/(2 + ω + ω²).\n\nBut 2 + ω + ω² = (1 + ω + ω²) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo, ab = 1/1 = 1.\n\nSo, a and b are such that ab = 1, and we need to find a + b.\n\nThis is a classic problem where if ab =1, then a + b = (a + b). But wait, that doesn't directly help. Wait, unless we know more about a and b.\n\nWait, another thought: Since (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²) are related, perhaps there's a way to write a and b in terms of each other.\n\nBut I think this is getting too convoluted.

If ω =1, then 1/(1 +1) +1/(1 +1)= 1/2 +1/2 =1. So that's okay. For ω being the other roots, we saw it's also 1. So, yeah, the only possible value is 1.
