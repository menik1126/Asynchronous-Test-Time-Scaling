I need to find all possible values of the expression \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. I remember that the cube roots of unity are solutions to the equation \u03c9\u00b3 - 1 = 0. This can be factored as (\u03c9 - 1)(\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1) = 0. So, the cube roots of unity are 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1 and \u03c9\u00b2 \u2260 1.\n\nBut in this case, we are dealing with the non-real cube roots, so \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2. These satisfy certain properties. For example, 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, the expression we need to evaluate is \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Let me denote this sum as S. So, S = \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Maybe I can combine these two fractions into one to simplify.\n\nTo add the two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + \u03c9) and (1 + \u03c9\u00b2), so the common denominator would be (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me compute the numerator accordingly.\n\nSo, S = \\[\\frac{1 \\cdot (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1 \\cdot (1 + \u03c9\u00b2)}{(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2)}.\\] Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. When adding fractions, it's numerator1 * denominator2 + numerator2 * denominator1, all over denominator1 * denominator2.\n\nSo, S = \\[\\frac{1 \\cdot (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1 \\cdot (1 + \u03c9)}{(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2)}.\\] Let me compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nFirst, numerator: 1*(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1*(1 + \u03c9) = (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + ("

Let me expand that.\n\n(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1*(1) + 1*(\u03c9\u00b2) + \u03c9*(1) + \u03c9*(\u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3. But \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so this becomes 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2. So, denominator is 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2, which is the same as the numerator. Therefore, S = \\[\\frac{2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2}{2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2}.\\] Which simplifies to 1.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting again: S = \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \u03c9} + \\frac{1}{1 + \u03c9\u00b2}.\\] Combine them over a common denominator:\n\nNumerator: (1)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1)(1 + \u03c9) = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 + \u03c9 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Expanding this:\n\n(1)(1) + (1)(\u03c9\u00b2) + (\u03c9)(1) + (\u03c9)(\u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3.\n\nSince \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, this is 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2. So denominator is same as numerator.\n\nThus, S = \\[\\frac{2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2}{2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2} = 1.\\] Hmm, so does that mean S is equal to 1?\n\nWait, but I recall that sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, the expression can have multiple values or something more interesting. But in this case, does the expression always equal 1 regardless of \u03c9?\n\nBut wait, since \u03c9 is a root other than 1, so \u03c9 \u2260 1 and \u03c9\u00b2 \u2260 1. So, maybe the sum is always 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the computation. Let me check the initial problem statement again.\n\nYes, it's definitely S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using another approach"

Let me see if that can help.\n\nLet me try substituting \u03c9\u00b2 = -1 - \u03c9 into the expression.\n\nFirst, let me compute 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me write the second term's denominator as 1 + \u03c9\u00b2. Since \u03c9\u00b2 = -1 - \u03c9, then 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + (-1 - \u03c9) = -\u03c9. So, 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1/(-\u03c9) = -1/\u03c9.\n\nSimilarly, the first term is 1/(1 + \u03c9). Let me see:\n\nSo, S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + (-1/\u03c9). Let me combine these terms.\n\nFirst, let me write them with a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + \u03c9) and \u03c9. So common denominator is \u03c9(1 + \u03c9).\n\nSo, S = [1 * \u03c9 - 1*(1 + \u03c9)] / [\u03c9(1 + \u03c9)].\n\nCompute numerator: \u03c9 - (1 + \u03c9) = \u03c9 -1 - \u03c9 = -1.\n\nDenominator: \u03c9(1 + \u03c9).\n\nTherefore, S = -1 / [\u03c9(1 + \u03c9)].\n\nHmm, so now S is expressed as -1 divided by [\u03c9(1 + \u03c9)]. Let me see if I can simplify this further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0 again. Let me see:\n\nSince 1 + \u03c9 = -\u03c9\u00b2, so substituting that into the denominator:\n\nDenominator: \u03c9(1 + \u03c9) = \u03c9*(-\u03c9\u00b2) = -\u03c9\u00b3. But \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so this is -1.\n\nTherefore, denominator is -1, so S = -1 / (-1) = 1. So that gives the same result as before. So S = 1.\n\nHmm, so both methods give me 1. But the problem says \"find all possible values\". Since \u03c9 is a cube root of unity, other than 1, so \u03c9 can be either \u03c9 or \u03c9\u00b2"

Let me check for both \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nCase 1: \u03c9 is \u03c9, so \u03c9\u00b2 is the other root, let's say it's a complex number.\n\nCompute S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). As we saw, that adds up to 1.\n\nCase 2: \u03c9 is \u03c9\u00b2, so compute S with \u03c9 being \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nSo, S = 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1/(1 + (\u03c9\u00b2)^2). Wait, but (\u03c9\u00b2)^2 = \u03c9^4. But since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, \u03c9^4 = \u03c9.\n\nSo, S becomes 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1/(1 + \u03c9). Which is the same as the original expression. Hence, same result.\n\nThus, regardless of which non-real cube root of unity we pick, the sum S is 1.\n\nWait, so is the only possible value 1? That seems to be the case.\n\nBut wait, the problem is phrased as \"find all possible values\", so it's expecting a set of possible values. Since S is always equal to 1, then the only possible value is 1. So the answer is 1.\n\nWait, let me think again. Perhaps I need to rationalize the denominator or express it differently, but in this case, it's a complex number, so it's fine. But the expression simplifies to 1 regardless of \u03c9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of minimal polynomials or something else.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let me define z = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me compute z.\n\nFrom 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so 1 + \u03c9 = -\u03c9\u00b2, and 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -\u03c9.\n\nTherefore, z = 1/(-\u03c9\u00b2) + 1/(-\u03c9) = -1/\u03c9\u00b2 -1/\u03c9 = -(1/\u03c9 + 1/\u03c9\u00b2).\n\nNow, 1/\u03c9 + 1/\u03c9\u00b2 = (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)/(\u03c9 * \u03c9\u00b2). But since \u03c9 * \u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, and \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1, as from the equation 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 ="

So the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values\", so maybe there's a case when \u03c9 is 1? But the problem states \u03c9^3 = 1, so \u03c9 could be 1, but then the denominators would be 1 + 1 = 2, so let me check that case.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem says \"Let \u03c9 be a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1.\" So \u03c9 can be 1, \u03c9, or \u03c9\u00b2. But if \u03c9 is 1, then the expression becomes 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1\u00b2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So even when \u03c9 is 1, the expression is still 1. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity \u03c9 is, the expression is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. So the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nHmm, so that's the conclusion. But let me just confirm once more with actual numerical values. Let me take \u03c9 as a primitive cube root of unity.
