            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve: If log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then I need to find x. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky at first glance, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the first equation: log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2. I remember that logarithms have some properties that let me combine them. Specifically, the sum of two logs with the same base can be written as the log of the product. So, if I apply that here, it should become log\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nAlright, so (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, which simplifies to x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. So, now the equation is log\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2. I can convert this logarithmic equation back to exponential form to get rid of the log. Remembering that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a, so applying that here, 6\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. Calculating 6 squared, that's 36. So, 36 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\nSo, now I have my first equation simplified: x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36. That's equation (1).\n\nNext, let's look at the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Again, this is a logarithmic equation, so I can convert it to exponential form. Remembering the same rule, log_y(a) = b is equivalent to y^b = a. So, here, y\u00b2 = 5x. That gives me 5x = y squared. So, x = y\u00b2 / 5. Let me note that down as equation (2): x = y\u00b2 / 5.\n\nNow, my goal is to find x. I have two equations, so I can substitute one into the other to solve for y first, and then find x. Let's see how to do that.\n\nFrom equation (2), I have x expressed in terms of y: x = y\u00b2 / 5. I can substitute this expression for x into equation (1), which is x"

That would be y\u2074 / 25. So, the equation becomes:\n\ny\u2074 / 25 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nHmm, this looks like a quartic equation, but maybe I can make a substitution to make it a quadratic equation. Let me let z = y\u00b2. Then, y\u2074 is z\u00b2. So substituting z into the equation:\n\n(z\u00b2)/25 - z = 36.\n\nMultiply both sides by 25 to eliminate the denominator:\n\nz\u00b2 - 25z = 900.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nz\u00b2 - 25z - 900 = 0.\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of z. Let's try to solve for z using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is z = [25 \u00b1 sqrt(25\u00b2 + 4*1*900)] / (2*1).\n\nCalculating the discriminant first:\n\n25 squared is 625, and 4*1*900 is 3600. So, the discriminant is 625 + 3600 = 4225.\n\nThe square root of 4225 is... Hmm, let me think. 65 squared is 4225 because 60\u00b2 is 3600 and 5\u00b2 is 25, and cross terms 2*60*5=600, so (60+5)^2 = 60\u00b2 + 2*60*5 +5\u00b2 = 3600 + 600 +25 = 4225. So sqrt(4225) is 65.\n\nTherefore, z = [25 \u00b1 65]/2.\n\nSo, two solutions:\n\nFirst solution: (25 + 65)/2 = 90/2 = 45.\n\nSecond solution: (25 - 65)/2 = (-40)/2 = -20.\n\nBut z was defined as y\u00b2, and since y\u00b2 can"

            "output": "'t be negative (as squares are always non-negative), the second solution z = -20 is not possible. So, we discard that. Therefore, z = 45.\n\nSo, z = 45, which is y\u00b2 = 45. Therefore, y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). However, before we proceed, let me think about the domain of the original equations.\n\nLooking back at the first equation: log\u2086(x - y) and log\u2086(x + y). The arguments of the logarithms must be positive. So, x - y > 0 and x + y > 0.\n\nSimilarly, in the second equation: log_y(5x) is defined only if y > 0 and 5x > 0.\n\nTherefore, y must be positive because log_y(5x) implies y > 0 and 5x > 0. So, y is positive, which means y = sqrt(45). So, y = sqrt(45).\n\nSimplify sqrt(45): sqrt(9*5) = 3*sqrt(5). So, y = 3\u221a5.\n\nNow, using equation (2): x = y\u00b2 / 5. Let's compute y squared: y\u00b2 = (3\u221a5)^2 = 9*5 = 45. Therefore, x = 45 / 5 = 9.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again, after substituting x from equation (2) into equation (1), I had x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36. Substituting x = y\u00b2 /5:\n\n(y\u00b2 /5)^2 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nWhich is y\u2074 /25 - y\u00b2 -36 =0.\n\nThen, substituting z = y\u00b2:\n\nz\u00b2 /25 - z -36 =0. Multiply by 25: z\u00b2 -25z -900 =0.\n\nQuadratic in z: z = [25 \u00b1 sqrt(625 + 3600)] /2 = [25 \u00b1 65]/2.\n\nSo, z = (25 +65)/2 = 90/2=45, and z=(25-65)/2=-20.\n\nDiscard negative z, so z=45. So y\u00b2=45, y=3\u221a5.\n\nThen x="

So x=9.\n\nNow, let's check if this satisfies the original equations.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = log\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = log\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2). Since x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 9\u00b2 -45 =81 -45=36. So log\u2086(36)= log\u2086(6\u00b2)=2. That works.\n\nSecond equation: log_y(5x)= log_{3\u221a5}(5*9)= log_{3\u221a5}(45). Let's see if that equals 2.\n\nFirst, 5x is 45. So, log_{3\u221a5}(45) = 2?\n\nLet me compute (3\u221a5)^2 = 9*5 =45. So yes, (3\u221a5)^2 =45. Therefore, log_{3\u221a5}(45)=2. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nAlso, check the domain conditions:\n\nx - y =9 - 3\u221a5. Since \u221a5 is approx 2.236, so 3\u221a5\u22486.708. So 9 -6.708\u22482.292>0.\n\nx + y =9 +6.708\u224815.708>0. So both logs are defined.\n\nAlso, y is positive, and 5x=45>0, so the second log is okay.\n\nTherefore, all conditions are satisfied. So x=9 is the correct solution.\n\nHmm, so I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes here. Let me just recap the steps again to be thorough.\n\n1. Combined the two logarithms in the first equation using log(a) + log(b) = log(ab).\n\n2. Converted the logarithmic equation to its exponential form, leading to x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 =36.\n\n3. For the second equation, converted log base y of 5x =2 into exponential form, getting y\u00b2=5x, so x= y\u00b2/5.\n\n4. Substituted x in terms of y into the first equation, leading to a quartic equation, which was simplified by substituting z=y\u00b2, turning it into a quadratic equation"
