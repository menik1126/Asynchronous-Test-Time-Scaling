            "output": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have two logarithmic equations, and I need to find the value of x. The equations are:\n\n1. log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2.\n2. log base y of 5x equals 2.\n\nHmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying the arguments. So, log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. That simplifies to log₆[(x² - y²)] = 2. \n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, 6^2 = x² - y². That means 36 = x² - y². So, that's equation (1a): x² - y² = 36.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Similarly, I can rewrite this in exponential form. That gives y² = 5x. So, equation (2a): y² = 5x.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. x² - y² = 36\n2. y² = 5x\n\nHmm, seems like substitution will work here. Since equation (2a) gives y² in terms of x, I can substitute y² into equation (1a). So, replacing y² with 5x in equation (1a):\n\nx² - 5x = 36.\n\nSo, now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nLet me solve for x using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax² + bx + c = 0, so here, a=1, b=-5, c=-36.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nx = [5 ± sqrt(25 + 144)] / 2\nx ="

            "output": " [5 ± sqrt(169)] / 2\nsqrt(169) is 13, so:\n\nx = [5 + 13]/2 or [5 - 13]/2\nx = 18/2 = 9 or x = (-8)/2 = -4.\n\nSo, x could be 9 or -4. But wait, let me think about the original logarithmic equations. Logarithms are only defined for positive arguments. So, (x - y) and (x + y) must be positive. Also, the base y of the logarithm in the second equation must be positive and not equal to 1.\n\nFirst, let's check if x is 9.\n\nFrom equation (2a): y² = 5x = 5*9 = 45. So y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But since y is the base of a logarithm in the second equation, y must be positive and not equal to 1. So y = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708, which is positive and not 1, so that's fine.\n\nNow, let's check the first equation: x - y and x + y.\n\nx = 9, y ≈ 6.708.\n\nSo, x - y ≈ 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292, which is positive.\nx + y ≈ 9 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708, which is also positive.\n\nSo, x = 9 seems valid.\n\nNow, check x = -4.\n\nFrom equation (2a): y² = 5*(-4) = -20. Wait, that's a problem because y² can't be negative. So, y² = -20 is not possible in real numbers. Therefore, x = -4 is invalid.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nLet me just double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. For x = 9, y² = 45, so y = sqrt(45). Then, x - y ≈ 2.292 > 0, and x + y ≈ 15.708 > 0, which satisfies the first equation's domain.\n\n2. The second equation, log_y(5x) = 2. Plugging in x = 9 and y = sqrt(45), we have log_{sqrt(45)}"

            "output": "(45). Let me compute that. Let me denote y = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5). So, log_{3√5}(45) = ?\n\n45 can be written as (3√5)^2 because (3√5)^2 = 9*5 = 45. So, log_{3√5}( (3√5)^2 ) = 2, which matches the second equation. So that's correct.\n\nAnd for x = -4, y² would be negative, which is impossible, so x = -4 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by converting the logarithmic equations into their exponential forms.\n\n1. From the first equation:\n   \\[\n   \\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2 \\implies \\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2 \\implies (x - y)(x + y) = 6^2 = 36.\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - y^2 = 36 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}.\n   \\]\n\n2. From the second equation:\n   \\[\n   \\log_y (5x) = 2 \\implies y^2 = 5x \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}.\n   \\]\n\nSubstitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x = 36 \\implies x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\\]\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 144}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm 13}{2}.\n\\]\nThis gives two solutions: \\(x = 9\\) and \\(x = -4\\).\n\nChecking \\(x = 9\\):\n- \\(y^2 = 5 \\times 9 = 45\\) so \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\), which is valid as it is positive and not equal to 1.\n- The arguments of the logarithms in the first equation are positive:\n  \\[\n  x - y = 9 - \\sqrt{45} > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\"
