Let me start by trying to simplify the equation. The equation is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, so it should have four solutions. If I can factor this equation, it might be easier to find the roots.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). I notice that the coefficients have a specific pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Hmm, maybe this is a binomial expansion? Let me check.\n\nI recall that \\( (z + a)^4 \\) expands to \\( z^4 + 4a z^3 + 6a^2 z^2 + 4a^3 z + a^4 \\). Comparing this with my given equation, the coefficients don't exactly match. Wait, but the coefficients have alternating signs and some are multiplied by i. That makes me think that maybe instead of \\( a \\) being a real number, it's a complex number, perhaps involving i.\n\nWait, there's also a -i at the end. Maybe it's better to factor this directly or try substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution \\( w = z - i \\) could simplify the equation. Let me try that. But before that, another thought: sometimes when you have coefficients with alternating signs, it might be a form of a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me consider \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i \\).
