The solutions to this equation form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon. The answer should be in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime. Then, I have to find \\( a + b + p \\). Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation is a quartic (degree 4) in \\( z \\). Solving quartic equations can be quite involved, but maybe there's a substitution or a factorization that can make this manageable. Let me write the equation out again:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, looking at the coefficients, I notice that they seem to be related to powers of \\( i \\). Let's recall that \\( i^1 = i \\), \\( i^2 = -1 \\), \\( i^3 = -i \\), \\( i^4 = 1 \\), and so on. Let's see if we can rewrite the equation in terms of \\( i \\):\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \\).\n\nIf I factor terms:\n\n- \\( z^4 - 6 z^2 - i = \\) terms without \\( i \\)\n- \\( 4i z^3 - 4i z = 4i(z^3 - z) \\)\n\nSo, maybe I can write the equation as:\n\n\\( (z^4 - 6 z^2 - i) + 4i(z^3 - z) = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet. Wait, maybe I can factor this equation as a quadratic in \\( z^2 \\), but it doesn't seem straightforward because of the \\( z^3 \\) and \\( z \\) terms.\n\nAnother approach: sometimes, quartic equations can be factored into quadratics.

The rotation would rotate the entire translated circle.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Maybe instead of trying to track the transformations, I can compute the coordinates of the four roots and then compute the area.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's compute the four roots \\( w \\):\n\nEach root is \\( w = \\sqrt[4]{1 + i} \\). Since \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} e^{i \\pi/4} \\), so the fourth roots are \\( ( \\sqrt{2} )^{1/4} e^{i ( \\pi/16 + k \\pi/2 ) } \\), for \\( k = 0,1,2,3 \\).\n\nSo, \\( ( \\sqrt{2} )^{1/4 } = (2^{1/2})^{1/4} = 2^{1/8} \\).\n\nTherefore, each root \\( w \\) has magnitude \\( 2^{1/8} \\), and angles \\( \\pi/16, 9\\pi/16, 17\\pi/16, 25\\pi/16 \\).\n\nLet me compute the coordinates of each \\( w \\):\n\nFirst root (k=0):\n\nAngle \\( \\pi/16 \\):\n\n\\( w_0 = 2^{1/8} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{16} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\right) \\).\n\nSecond root (k=1):\n\nAngle \\( 9\\pi/16 \\):\n\n\\( w_1 = 2^{1/8} \\left( \\cos \\frac{9\\pi}{16}"

So, the angles are equivalent to 9π/16, 17π/16, 25π/16, π/16.\n\nSo, the four roots \\( z \\) lie on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), with angles 9π/16, 17π/16, 25π/16, and π/16.\n\nSo, these angles are equally spaced by π/2 (90 degrees). So, the four points form the vertices of a square inscribed in a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\).\n\nBut wait, we"
