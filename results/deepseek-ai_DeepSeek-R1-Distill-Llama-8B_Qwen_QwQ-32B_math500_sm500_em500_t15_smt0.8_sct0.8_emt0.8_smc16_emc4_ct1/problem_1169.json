Let me start by trying to simplify the equation. The equation is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, so it should have four solutions. If I can factor this equation, it might be easier to find the roots.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). I notice that the coefficients have a specific pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Hmm, maybe this is a binomial expansion?

Wait, but the coefficients have alternating signs and some are multiplied by i. That makes me think that maybe instead of \\( a \\) being a real number, it's a complex number, perhaps involving i.\n\nWait, there's also a -i at the end. Maybe it's better to factor this directly or try substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution \\( w = z - i \\) could simplify the equation. Let me try that. But before that, another thought: sometimes when you have coefficients with alternating signs, it might be a form of a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me consider \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i \\).
