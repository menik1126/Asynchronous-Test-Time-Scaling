Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst off, I notice that all the denominators on the left side are quadratic expressions, and they follow a pattern: \\(x^2 - k\\) where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. The numerators are also increasing by 1 each time: 1, 2, 3, 4. That seems significant\u2014not sure how yet, but maybe it will help later.\n\nSo, the equation is a sum of four fractions equal to a linear expression in \\(x\\). Since we're dealing with complex solutions, I should remember that \\(x\\) can be any complex number, not just real numbers. But before jumping into complex analysis, maybe there's a clever substitution or something that simplifies this.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to handle such an equation. Usually, for equations involving multiple fractions, a common approach is to find a common denominator and combine them. But with four different denominators, that would result in a pretty complicated denominator. Maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rewrite each fraction in a more manageable form. For example, \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1}\\) can be expressed using partial fractions? Wait, but that's more for when you have polynomials in the denominator and you want to break them down into simpler fractions. Here, we already have simple denominators, so partial fractions might not help directly.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps consider the substitution \\(y = x^2\\). Then, each term becomes \\(\\frac{n}{y - n}\\) where \\(n\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. So, let's rewrite the equation in terms of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010"

Since \\(y = x^2\\), maybe we can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\), but that would involve square roots, which complicates things because \\(x\\) could be positive or negative. Hmm, maybe that substitution isn't helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cross-multiplying everything to eliminate denominators? Let's see. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). The common denominator would be the product of all these denominators. That would be a huge polynomial, degree 8, which would lead to a very high-degree equation. Solving an 8th-degree equation sounds really tough, especially since the right-hand side is linear. Maybe there's a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions. In polynomial equations, the sum of solutions is related to the coefficients via Vieta's formula. But this equation isn't a polynomial equation yet. Maybe if I can manipulate it into a polynomial equation, then I can apply Vieta's theorem?\n\nLet me try that. Let's move everything to the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow, to combine all terms into a single rational function, I need a common denominator. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\), and the terms without denominators (the -2010x and +4) can be considered as having a denominator of 1. So the common denominator would be the product of all four denominators:\n\n\\[\nD = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\n\\]\n\nTherefore, multiplying each term by D to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\[\nD \\cdot \\"
