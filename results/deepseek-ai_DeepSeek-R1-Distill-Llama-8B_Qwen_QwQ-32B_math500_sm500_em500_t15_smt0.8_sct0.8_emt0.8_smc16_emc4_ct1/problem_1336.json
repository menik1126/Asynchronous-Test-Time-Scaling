Let me start by trying to combine the fractions on the left side. They all have denominators that are quadratic, so perhaps I can find a common denominator. But wait, each denominator is different: \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). That seems tricky because the common denominator would be the product of all four, which would make the equation very messy. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rewrite each term. Let me note that \\(x^2 - k\\) can be factored as \\((x - \\sqrt{k})(x + \\sqrt{k})\\), but I don't know if that helps yet. Another thought: perhaps I can set \\(y = x^2\\) to simplify the equation. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet \\(y = x^2\\). Then each denominator becomes \\(y - 1\\), \\(y - 2\\), \\(y - 3\\), and \\(y - 4\\). The equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but this substitution didn't eliminate the \\(x\\) term on the right side. That's still a problem because \\(y = x^2\\) relates \\(y\\) to \\(x\\), but the right side is linear in \\(x\\). So maybe that substitution doesn't help as much as I hoped. Let me think differently.\n\nWhat if I consider the equation as a function equal to zero? Let me move everything to one side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\"

Now, perhaps I can consider this as a function \\(f(x) = 0\\), and we're looking for the roots of \\(f(x)\\). The sum of all roots of a polynomial can be found using Vieta's formula, but this isn't a polynomial. It's a rational function plus a linear term. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps if I multiply both sides by the product of the denominators, I can turn it into a polynomial equation. That might help because then I can find the sum of roots using Vieta. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). Their product is:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by this product would eliminate the denominators. However, this will result in a very high-degree polynomial, but maybe it's manageable. Let's denote \\(P(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nP(x) \\left( \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} \\right) - (2010x - 4)P(x) = 0.\n\\]\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2(x^2 - 1) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2) + 4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) - (2010x - 4)P(x) = 0.\n\\]\n\nWait, perhaps that's too cumbersome.

Therefore, \\(Q(x)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n2010x^9 - 4x^8 + \\text{(lower degree terms)} = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, the polynomial \\(Q(x)\\) is of degree 9 with leading coefficient 2010 and the coefficient of \\(x^8\\) is \\(-4\\).\n\nThe sum of all roots of \\(Q(x)\\) is given by \\(-\\frac{a_8}{a_9}\\), which in this case is \\(-\\frac{-4}{2010} = \\frac{4}{2010}\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\frac{2}{1005}\\), which can be reduced as \\(\\frac{2}{1005}\\).\n\nWait, is that the final answer? Wait, but hold on. The equation is \\(Q(x) = 0\\), and it's a degree 9 polynomial. So, the sum of all roots (with multiplicity) is \\(-a_8 / a_9\\). Since \\(a_9 = 2010\\) and \\(a_8 = -4\\), so the sum is \\(-(-4)/2010 = 4/2010 = 2/1005\\).\n\nBut hold on, the original equation had denominators \\(x^2 - k\\), so we have to exclude any roots where any denominator becomes zero, as these would make the original equation undefined. So, when we multiplied through by \\(P(x)\\), we introduced extraneous roots where \\(P(x) = 0"

But in the equation \\(Q(x) = 0\\), these are roots, but they are not solutions to the original equation. Therefore, we must exclude these from our count when computing the sum.\n\nSo, how does this affect the sum of roots? The polynomial \\(Q(x)\\) includes these extraneous roots. Therefore, the sum we computed earlier, 2/1005, includes these roots, but they shouldn't be included. Therefore, we need to subtract their contributions.\n\nSo, let me find the sum of these extraneous roots. The roots are \\(x = \\pm 1\\), \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{2}\\), \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{3}\\), \\(x = \\pm 2\\). So, let's compute their sum.\n\nSum of \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\) is \\(0\\).\n\nSum of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{2}\\) is \\(0\\).\n\nSimilarly, sum of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(0\\).\n\nSum of \\(2\\) and \\(-2\\) is \\(0\\).\n\nTherefore, all these roots sum up to zero. Therefore, the original sum we found, 2/1005, includes these extraneous roots which sum to zero, so effectively, the sum of all valid roots is still 2/1005.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because when we consider Vieta's formula, the sum of all roots (including extraneous ones) is 2/1005. But the extraneous roots sum to zero, so the sum of the valid roots is also 2/1005.\n\nHmm, yes, that seems right. Because if the total sum is S_total = S_valid + S_extraneous, and S_extraneous = 0, then S_valid = S_total.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions to the original equation is 2/1005.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the steps again.\n\n1. The original equation has denominators \\(x^2 - 1\\), etc., so all roots \\(x\\) must satisfy \\(x^2 \\ne "

Since those roots are excluded, but their sum is zero, so the total sum remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005.

The second part is -4 * 1 (since the coefficient of \\(x^8\\) in P(x) is 1). So that gives -4.\n\nNow, the second part is the sum term: \\(\\sum_{k=1}^4 k \\cdot \\prod_{j \\ne k} (x^2 - j)\\). Each term in the sum is a product of three quadratics, so each term is degree 6. Therefore, the entire sum is degree 6, so the coefficient of \\("

When we multiply the denominators, are there any potential sign issues or other considerations?
