Let me start by reading the question carefully.\n\nWe have a quadratic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) with real coefficients. The problem states that for all real numbers \\( x \\), the polynomial satisfies the inequality \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq P(x) \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\). Additionally, we're given that \\( P(11) = 181 \\). The goal is to find \\( P(16) \\).\n\nFirst, since \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial, I know it has the general form:\n\n\\[ P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are real coefficients that we need to determine.\n\nThe problem gives inequalities that bound \\( P(x) \\) between two other quadratic expressions. So, let's write down these inequalities explicitly.\n\n1. \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq P(x) \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\) for all real \\( x \\).\n\nThis means that for every \\( x \\), \\( P(x) \\) is sandwiched between these two quadratics. So, if we subtract the lower bound from \\( P(x) \\), we get a non-negative expression, and similarly, subtracting \\( P(x) \\) from the upper bound gives a non-negative expression.\n\nLet me express this mathematically:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq ax^2 + bx + c \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\]\n\nTo make this easier, I can subtract \\( P(x) \\) from each part of the inequality. But actually, maybe a better approach is to express the inequalities as:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq ax^2 + bx + c \\]\nand\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\]\n\nLet me rewrite these inequalities so that all terms are on one side:\n\n1. \\( ax^2 + bx + c - (x^2 - 2x + 2) \\geq 0 \\)\n2. \\( 2x^2 - 4x"
