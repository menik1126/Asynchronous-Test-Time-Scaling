            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a quadratic polynomial P(x). The problem says that P(x) satisfies two inequalities: x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all real numbers x. Also, they give me that P(11) = 181, and I need to find P(16).\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out what P(x) is. Since it's a quadratic polynomial, it has the general form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers.\n\nThe problem gives me two inequalities that P(x) must satisfy for all x. So, for every x, P(x) is between x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nI think I can write these inequalities as:\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ ax² + bx + c ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nHmm, maybe I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound to find something about the coefficients a, b, c.\n\nLet's subtract the left inequality from the right inequality:\n(2x² - 4x + 3) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ (ax² + bx + c) - (ax² + bx + c)\nSimplifying the left side:\n2x² - 4x + 3 - x² + 2x - 2 = x² - 2x + 1\nAnd the right side is 0 because the polynomials cancel out.\n\nSo, x² - 2x + 1 ≥ 0 for all x. But x² - 2x + 1 is (x - 1)², which is always non-negative since any real number squared is non-negative. So, that's good because it means the inequalities are consistent.\n\nBut how does that help me find a, b, c?\n\nMaybe I should look at the inequalities again, breaking them down.\n\nFirst inequality: x² - 2x + 2 ≤ ax² + bx + c\n\nI can rearrange this as (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≤ 0 for all x.\n\nSimilarly, the second inequality: ax² + bx + c ≤"

But a can't be both less than 1 and greater than 2 at the same time. That seems impossible. So maybe I have to check my initial step.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the quadratics are not strictly positive or negative, but only non-positive and non-negative. So, perhaps the quadratics touch the x-axis, meaning discriminant is zero, but in the case of the first inequality, it's allowed to be zero at some point. Similarly, the second inequality can be zero at some point.\n\nWait, but for the first inequality, (a -1)x² + (b +2)x + (c -2) ≤0 for all x. So, if a quadratic is always less than or equal to zero, it can't have any part above zero. So it must either be a negative definite quadratic.\n\nBut in that case, the leading coefficient is negative (a -1 <0) and the discriminant is less than or equal to zero (so it doesn't cross the x-axis). Similarly, the second inequality's quadratic must be positive definite, so leading coefficient positive (a -2 >0) and discriminant ≤0.\n\nBut that's conflicting because from first condition a <1, second condition a >2.

Because if a is such that a -1 = 0 and a -2 = 0, which is only possible if a is undefined, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe the only way for both inequalities to hold is if the two quadratics inside the inequalities are both zero for all x, meaning their coefficients are zero.\n\nWait, so let me try that approach.

Let's see if that is ≥0 for all x. Let's compute discriminant: (2)^2 -4*(-1)*(-1) =4 -4=0. So discriminant is zero, so it's a perfect square. The quadratic is -x² +2x -1 = -(x² -2x +1) = -(x-1)^2. So that's always ≤0, but the second inequality requires it to be ≥0. So that's the opposite. So that's not possible. So that approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so maybe the quadratics are not identically zero, but they just touch the x-axis at some points. Wait, but the problem states that P(x) is sandwiched between the two quadratics for all x. So perhaps the inequalities are tight at some points, but not everywhere. But the problem says \"for all real numbers x\", so the inequalities must hold everywhere. So the difference between P(x) and the lower bound must be a non-positive quadratic, and the difference between upper bound and P(x) must be non-negative quadratic. But as we saw, the coefficients of the leading terms would require a to be both less than 1 and greater than 2, which is impossible. So maybe there's a different approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic P(x) is exactly equal to the lower bound or the upper bound at certain points, but not everywhere.
