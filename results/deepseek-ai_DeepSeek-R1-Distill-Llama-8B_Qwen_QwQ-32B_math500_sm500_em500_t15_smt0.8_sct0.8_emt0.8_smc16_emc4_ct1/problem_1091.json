Let me try to understand each case and maybe compute some small values to see a pattern or figure out how the function behaves.\n\nFirst, the function f is defined for non-negative integers i and j, where j can be 0 to 4. The definition is recursive, so I'll probably need to build up the values step by step.\n\nStarting with the base case: when i = 0, f(0, j) = mod_5(j + 1). Since mod_5(n) is the remainder when n is divided by 5, which means for j from 0 to 4, f(0, j) will be:\n\n- f(0, 0) = mod_5(1) = 1\n- f(0, 1) = mod_5(2) = 2\n- f(0, 2) = mod_5(3) = 3\n- f(0, 3) = mod_5(4) = 4\n- f(0, 4) = mod_5(5) = 0\n\nOkay, so that's straightforward. Now, what about when i >= 1? Let's look at the next cases.\n\nCase 2: If i >= 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1). So, for any i, to get f(i, 0), I need to compute f(i - 1, 1).\n\nCase 3: If i >= 1 and j >= 1, then f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). So, this is a nested recursion where each step depends on a previous f(i, j - 1), which in turn depends on f(i - 1, ...), and so on until it reaches the base case i=0.\n\nHmm. This seems a bit complicated, but maybe computing some small values will help.\n\nLet me make a table for small i and j to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with i=0:\n\n- f(0,0)=1\n- f(0,1)=2\n- f(0,2)=3\n-"
