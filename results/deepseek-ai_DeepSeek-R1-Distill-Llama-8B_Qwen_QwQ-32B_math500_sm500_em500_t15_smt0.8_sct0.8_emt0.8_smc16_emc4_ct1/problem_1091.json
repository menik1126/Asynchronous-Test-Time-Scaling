The function f is defined recursively, which means it's going to refer back to itself multiple times. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the definition of the function to make sure I understand it:\n\nf(i, j) is defined as:\n- mod_5(j + 1) if i = 0 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 4.\n- f(i - 1, 1) if i ≥ 1 and j = 0.\n- f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)) if i ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 4.\n\nSo, f takes two arguments, i and j. Both i and j can be any non-negative integer, but j is specifically within 0 to 4 because of the mod_5 function.\n\nSince the question is about f(2015, 2), which is i = 2015 and j = 2, I probably need to find a pattern or some periodicity in the function's values because computing it recursively all the way up to 2015 seems impossible manually.\n\nLet me start by computing some small values of f(i, j) to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst, when i = 0:\nf(0, j) = mod_5(j + 1) for j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\nSo,\nf(0, 0) = mod_5(0 + 1) = 1,\nf(0, 1) = mod_5(1 + 1) = 2,\nf(0, 2) = mod_5(2 + 1) = 3,\nf(0, 3) = mod_5(3 + 1) = 4,\nf(0, 4) = mod_5(4 + 1) = 0.\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's start with i = 1.\n\nFor i = 1 and j = 0:\nf(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2.\n\nFor i = 1 and j = 1:\nf(1, 1) = f(0, f(1, 0"

Got it.\n\nFor i = 1 and j = 2:\nf(1, 2) = f(0, f(1, 1)) = f(0, 3) = 4.\n\nSimilarly,\nf(1, 3) = f(0, f(1, 2)) = f(0,4) = 0,\nf(1,4) = f(0, f(1, 3)) = f(0,0) = 1.\n\nSo, for i = 1, we have:\nf(1,0) = 2,\nf(1,1) = 3,\nf(1,2) = 4,\nf(1,3) = 0,\nf(1,4) = 1.\n\nInteresting, so for i = 1, it's like shifting j + 2, but wrapping around modulo 5. Wait, let's see:\n\nAt j=0, f(1,0) = 2,\nj=1: 3,\nj=2: 4,\nj=3: 0,\nj=4:1.\n\nSo, it's a shift of 2, but mod 5. Because 0 becomes 2, 1 becomes 3, etc. So, it's j + 2 mod 5.\n\nHmm, is that a general pattern? Let me check for i=2.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nf(2,0) = f(1,1) = 3.\n\nf(2,1) = f(1, f(2,0)) = f(1,3) = 0.\n\nf(2,2) = f(1, f(2,1)) = f(1,0) = 2.\n\nf(2,3) = f(1, f(2,2)) = f(1,2) = 4.\n\nf(2,4) = f(1, f(2,3)) = f(1,4) = 1.\n\nSo, for i=2, the results are:\nf(2,0)=3,\nf(2,"
