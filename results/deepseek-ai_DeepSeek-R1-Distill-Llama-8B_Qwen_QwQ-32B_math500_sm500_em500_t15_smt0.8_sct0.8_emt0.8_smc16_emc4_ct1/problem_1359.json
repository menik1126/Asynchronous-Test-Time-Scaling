Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you divide one polynomial by another, the result is another polynomial called the quotient, and it's of lower degree than the divisor. Since the divisor here is \\( x + 1 \\), which is a first-degree polynomial, the quotient should be a fifth-degree polynomial. That means the quotient will have terms from \\( x^5 \\) down to the constant term.\n\nBut how do I actually perform this division? Well, I could try using polynomial long division. I think that's the method for dividing one polynomial by another. Let me recall how that works.\n\nSo, the dividend is \\( x^6 - 3 \\) and the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\). I'll set up the long division. Let me visualize it:\n\nDividend: \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\)\nDivisor: \\( x + 1 \\)\n\nI wrote out the dividend with all the missing terms so that each power of x is accounted for. This should make it easier to perform the division term by term.\n\nNow, I'll start the division. The first term of the dividend is \\( x^6 \\) and the first term of the divisor is \\( x \\). When I divide \\( x^6 \\) by \\( x \\), I get \\( x^5 \\). That should be the first term of the quotient. Then, I multiply the entire divisor by \\( x^5 \\), which gives \\( x^6 + x^5 \\).\n\nNext, I subtract this from the dividend. So,\n\n\\( (x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nSo now, the new polynomial is \\( -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + "

The next term to divide is \\( -x^5 \\) by \\( x \\), which gives \\( -x^4 \\). That's the next term in the quotient.\n\nMultiply the divisor by \\( -x^4 \\), which is \\( -x^5 - x^4 \\). Subtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n\\( (-x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (-x^5 - x^4) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nSo now, the new polynomial is \\( x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nNext, I divide \\( x^4 \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( x^3 \\). Multiply the divisor by \\( x^3 \\), resulting in \\( x^4 + x^3 \\).\n\nSubtract this from the current polynomial:\n\n\\( (x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^4 + x^3) = -x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nNow, the polynomial is \\( -x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nDividing \\( -x^3 \\) by \\( x \\) gives me \\( -x^2 \\). Multiply the divisor by \\( -x^2 \\) to get \\( -x^3 - x^2 \\).\n\nSubtracting that:\n\n\\( (-x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (-x^3 - x^2) = x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nSo, now we have \\( x^2 - 3 \\).\n\nDivide \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( x \\). Multiply the divisor by \\( x \\), resulting in \\( x^2 + x \\).\n\nSubtract this:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^2 + x) = -x -"

The quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( -2 \\). To verify, I can multiply the divisor \\( x + 1 \\) by the quotient and add the remainder, which should give me the original dividend \\( x^6 - 3 \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( (x + 1)(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1) + (-2) \\).\n\nMultiplying term by term:\n\n\\( x * x^5 = x^6 \\)\n\n\\( x * (-x^4) = -x^5 \\)\n\n\\( x * x^3 = x^4 \\)\n\n\\( x * (-x^2) = -x^3 \\)\n\n\\( x * x = x^2 \\)\n\n\\( x * (-1) = -x \\)\n\nNow, \\( 1 * x^5 = x^5 \\)\n\n\\( 1 * (-x^4) = -x^4 \\)\n\n\\( 1 * x^3 = x^3 \\)\n\n\\( 1 * (-x^2) = -x^2 \\)\n\n\\( 1 * x = x \\)\n\n\\( 1 * (-1) = -1 \\)\n\nAdding all these together:\n\n\\( x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1"

That means my quotient and remainder are correct. Therefore, the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\) is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( -2 \\).\n\nAlternatively, I remember something called the Remainder Theorem which says that the remainder when a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is divided by \\( x - a \\) is \\( f(a) \\). Wait, in this case, the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), which is \\( x - (-1) \\). So, according to the theorem, the remainder should be \\( f(-1) \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( f(-1) \\):\n\n\\( f(-1) = (-1)^6 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2 \\).\n\nYes, that's the same remainder I got from polynomial long division. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the quotient. So, in this case, since the divisor is linear, the quotient is the fifth-degree polynomial I found, and the remainder is the constant term. So the final answer for the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\).\n\nLet me just write that again to make sure I didn't make any sign errors during the subtraction steps. Each step of subtracting the products seems correct, but sometimes signs can flip.\n\nQuotient: \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\).\n\nI think that's right.
