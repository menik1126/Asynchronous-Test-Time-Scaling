This simplifies the equation to \\( 8 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\).\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate \\( 3^x \\). This gives me \\( 3^x = 9 \\).\n\nNow, I recognize that 9 is equal to \\( 3^2 \\). Therefore, \\( 3^x = 3^2 \\).\n\nSince the bases are the same and the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold true, I conclude that \\( x = 2 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 2^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate \\( 3^x \\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   So, the equation now is:\n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Since the bases are equal, set the exponents equal:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
