This simplifies the equation to \\( 8 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\).\n\nNext, I divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate \\( 3^x \\), resulting in \\( 3^x = \\frac{72}{8} \\) or \\( 3^x = 9 \\).\n\nRecognizing that 9 is \\( 3^2 \\), I now have the equation \\( 3^x = 3^2 \\). Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, \\( x = 2 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\), follow these step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 2^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Isolate \\( 3^x \\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
