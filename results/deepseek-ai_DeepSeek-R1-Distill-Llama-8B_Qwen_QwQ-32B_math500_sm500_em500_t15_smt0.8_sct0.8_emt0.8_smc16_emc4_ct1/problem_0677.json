We know that x is at least 2 and y is at least 5. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I think the total number of cards must be divisible by y because each player gets the same number of cards. So, 54 divided by y should give us an integer. That means y has to be a divisor of 54.\n\nWait, no, actually, the total number of cards is 54, and each player gets y cards, so the number of players x must satisfy x multiplied by y equals 54. So, x = 54 / y. Since x has to be an integer, y must divide 54 exactly.\n\nSo, y has to be a divisor of 54. Also, y has to be at least 5. So, let's find all the divisors of 54 that are 5 or greater.\n\nFirst, let's list the divisors of 54. To do that, I'll factorize 54. 54 is 6 times 9, and 6 is 2 times 3, and 9 is 3 squared. So, the prime factors of 54 are 2, 3, and 3, 3. Wait, no, 54 is 2 * 3^3. So, the exponents for 2 are 0 or 1, and for 3 are 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo, the divisors of 54 are:\n- 2^0 * 3^0 = 1\n- 2^0 * 3^1 = 3\n- 2^0 * 3^2 = 9\n- 2^0 * 3^3 = 27\n- 2^1 * 3^0 = 2\n- 2^1 * 3^1 = 6\n- 2^1 * 3^2 = 18\n- 2^1 * 3^3 = 54\n\nSo, the divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nBut wait, y has to be at least 5"

            "output": ", so let's exclude the divisors less than 5. That means y can be 6, 9, 18, 27, or 54.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 54 divided by y must be an integer, and y has to be at least 5. So possible y values are 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nNow, for each of these y values, we can find x as 54 divided by y.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If y = 6, then x = 54 / 6 = 9\n- If y = 9, then x = 54 / 9 = 6\n- If y = 18, then x = 54 / 18 = 3\n- If y = 27, then x = 54 / 27 = 2\n- If y = 54, then x = 54 / 54 = 1\n\nBut wait, the problem states that x is at least 2. So, when y = 54, x would be 1, which is less than 2. So, that's not allowed. Therefore, y = 54 is invalid because it would make x = 1.\n\nSo, let's update our list of valid y values. The possible y values are 6, 9, 18, and 27. Each of these gives a valid x value that is at least 2.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n- y = 6 → x = 9\n- y = 9 → x = 6\n- y = 18 → x = 3\n- y = 27 → x = 2\n\nSo, the possible x values are 2, 3, 6, and 9. That means there are 4 possible values of x.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any other divisors of 54 between 5 and 54? Let me check the list again: the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. So, between 5 and 54, the next divisor after 3 is 6, which is included, and then 9, 18, 27, 54. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, for each of these y values"

Therefore, the possible x values are 2, 3, 6, and 9.\n\nSo, that's four values. I don't think any other divisors qualify because the next divisor after 54 would be 108, which is higher than our total cards, so that's not applicable. So, yes, 4 possible x values.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\), we start by noting that \\( x \\times y = 54 \\) and both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be integers with \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( y \\geq 5 \\). \n\nFirst, we find the divisors of 54:\n\\[ 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54 \\]\n\nNext, we identify the divisors that are at least 5:\n\\[ 6, 9, 18, 27, 54 \\]\n\nFor each valid \\( y \\), we calculate \\( x \\):\n- \\( y = 6 \\) → \\( x = 9 \\)\n- \\( y = 9 \\) → \\( x = 6 \\)\n- \\( y = 18 \\) → \\( x = 3 \\)\n- \\( y = 27 \\) → \\( x = 2 \\)\n- \\( y = 54 \\) → \\( x = 1 \\) (invalid since \\( x \\geq 2 \\))\n\nThus, the valid \\( x \\) values are 2, 3, 6, and 9, yielding 4 possible values.\n\nThe number of possible values of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{4}."
