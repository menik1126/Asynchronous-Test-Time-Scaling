The argument \u03b8 is arctan(-1/1) = -\u03c0/4.\n\nRaising (1 - i) to the 8th power means raising its modulus to the 8th power and multiplying its argument by 8. So, (\u221a2)^8 = (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16.\n\nThe new argument is -\u03c0/4 * 8 = -2\u03c0. Adding 2\u03c0 to this argument to stay within the [0, 2\u03c0) range, it becomes 2\u03c0.\n\nFinally, converting back to rectangular form: |1 - i|^8 = 16(cos(2\u03c0) + i sin(2\u03c0)) = 16(1 + 0i) = 16.\n\nSo, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\(|1 - i|^8\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the complex number to polar form:**\n   \n   - **Modulus (r):**\n     \\[\n     r = |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Argument (\\(\\theta\\)):**\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-1}{1}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}\n     \\]\n     \n   So, \\(1 - i\\) in polar form is:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i \\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Raise the complex number to the 8th power:**\n   \n   - **Raise the modulus to the 8th power:**\n     \\[\n     (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16\n     \\]\n     \n   - **Multiply the argument by 8:**\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{\\"
