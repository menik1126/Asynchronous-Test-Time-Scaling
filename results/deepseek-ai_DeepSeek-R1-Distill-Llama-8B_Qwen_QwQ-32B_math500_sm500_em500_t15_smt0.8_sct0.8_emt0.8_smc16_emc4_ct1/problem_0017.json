Therefore, \\( |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll compute \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 \\). Since \\( (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \\) and \\( 2^4 = 16 \\), squaring \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) four more times gives \\( 16 \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's calculate \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\) step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Modulus of a Complex Number**:\n   - For a complex number \\(a + bi\\), the modulus \\(|a + bi|\\) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     |a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n     \\]\n   - Apply this to \\(|1 - i|\\):\n     \\[\n     |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Apply Exponentiation to the Modulus**:\n   - The modulus of a complex number raised to a power can be calculated using the property:\n     \\[\n     |(a + bi)^n| = |a + bi|^n\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\)**:\n   - Simplify step by step:\n     \\[\n     (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (\\sqrt{2})^4 = (2)^"
