I'll multiply both sides of the equation by \\((x - 5)\\) and then by 3 to isolate \\(x\\).\n\nNext, I'll solve the resulting equation for \\(x\\) by simplifying each side. After that, I'll verify my solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it holds true.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to solve the equation for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x - 5}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Cross-Multiply**\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, cross-multiply:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot (x - 5) = 3 \\cdot 4.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify Both Sides**\n\nMultiply out the left side:\n\\[\n2x - 10 = 12.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\)**\n\nAdd 10 to both sides:\n\\[\n2x = 22.\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = 11.\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Solution**\n\nSubstitute \\( x = 11 \\) back into the original equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{11 - 5} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\\]\nBoth sides are equal, confirming that \\( x = 11 \\) is the correct solution.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
