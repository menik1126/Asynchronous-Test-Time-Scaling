These tangents form four points of tangency, and I need to find the area of the quadrilateral made by connecting these four points. Hmm, okay, let me figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations given. The circle is \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\), so its center is at (0,0) and radius \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). The parabola is \\( y^2 = 8x \\). I remember that this is a right-opening parabola with vertex at the origin. The standard form for such a parabola is \\( y^2 = 4px \\), where p is the focal length. Comparing, \\( 4p = 8 \\), so p = 2. That means the focus is at (2,0).\n\nNow, the problem mentions common tangents. So, these are lines that touch both the circle and the parabola at exactly one point each. Since there are two common tangents, they will each touch the circle and the parabola once, making four points of tangency in total. The quadrilateral formed by connecting these four points is what I need to find the area of.\n\nTo find the points of tangency, I need to find the equations of the common tangents first. I think the method to find the common tangents between a circle and a parabola involves using the condition that the distance from the center of the circle to the tangent line is equal to the radius, and also that the line is tangent to the parabola.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the equation of a tangent to a parabola \\( y^2 = 4px \\). I recall that the tangent at a point \\( (at^2, 2at) \\) for the standard parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\) is \\( ty = x + at^2 \\). Since our parabola is \\( y^2 = 8x \\), which is \\( y^2 = 4*2x \\), so a = 2. So, the tangent equations become \\( ty = x + 2t^2 \\). \n\nOkay, so the tangent to the parabola can be written as \\( ty"

The condition for a line to be tangent to a circle is that the distance from the center to the line equals the radius.\n\nThe equation of the tangent line is \\( ty - x - 2t^2 = 0 \\). The distance from the center (0,0) to this line is given by:\n\n\\( \\frac{|0 - 0 - 2t^2|}{\\sqrt{t^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{2t^2}{\\sqrt{t^2 + 1}} \\)\n\nThis distance should be equal to the radius of the circle, which is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).

Since \\( u = t^2 \\), it can't be negative, so \\( u = 1 \\). Therefore, \\( t^2 = 1 \\), so \\( t = 1 \\) or \\( t = -1 \\).\n\nThus, the tangent lines are for t = 1 and t = -1. Plugging"

Hmm, so the points of tangency on the circle must be different?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the points where the tangent lines touch both the circle and the parabola. The tangent lines are common to both, so each tangent line touches the circle at one point and the parabola at another. Therefore, the four points of tangency are two on the parabola and two on the circle? Wait, but the problem says \"forming four points of tangency\". Wait, maybe each tangent line touches both the circle and the parabola, so each line has two points of tangency? But that can't be, since a line can only be tangent to a circle at one point and tangent to a parabola at another point. So, two lines, each with two points of tangency (one on each curve), so total four points. So the four points are two on the parabola and two on the circle. The quadrilateral is formed by connecting these four points.\n\nWait, but in the Asymptote code, the points are A=(-1,1), B=(2,4), C=(-1,-1), D=(2,-4). Let me check if these points are on the curves.\n\nFirst, point A (-1,1):\n\nCheck if it's on the circle: (-1)^2 +1^2 = 1 +1 = 2, yes. On the parabola? y^2 = 1, 8x = -8, so 1 vs -8, no. So A is on the circle but not on the parabola. Similarly, point B (2,4):\n\nOn the parabola: y^2 = 16, 8x = 16, so yes. On the circle: 4 + 16 = 20 ≠ 2. So B is on the parabola but not on the circle. Similarly, C (-1,-1) is on the circle, D (2,-4) is on the parabola. So the four points are two on the circle and two on the parabola, connected to form a quadrilateral.

So when you connect A to B, that's a line from (-1,1) to (2,4); connecting C to D is a line from (-1,-1) to (2,-4).
