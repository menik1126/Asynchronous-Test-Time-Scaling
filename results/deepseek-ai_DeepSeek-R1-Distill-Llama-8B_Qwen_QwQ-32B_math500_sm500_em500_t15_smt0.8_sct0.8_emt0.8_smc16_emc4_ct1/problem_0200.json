I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help find possible rational roots, which might be integers in this case since we're looking for integer roots. \n\nFirst, let me recall the Rational Root Theorem. It says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(p/q\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. Since 1 is a factor of everything, the possible rational roots are just the factors of -14. \n\nSo, factors of -14 are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). These are the possible integer roots I should test. That narrows it down—only eight possible candidates. Let me list them out: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14. \n\nNow, I can test each of these by plugging them into the equation to see if they make it equal to zero. Let's start with the smaller numbers first because they're easier to compute.\n\nStarting with \\(x=1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\)\nCalculates to:\n1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0. Oh, wow, so 1 is a root! That's one down.\n\nNext, \\(x=-1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14\\)\nCalculates to:\n1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14\nAdding up: 1 -5 is -4, plus 9 is 5, plus 1 is 6, minus 14 is -8. Not zero, so -1 isn't a root.\n\nMoving on to \\(x=2\\):\n\\(2^4 + "

            "output": "5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14\\)\nThat's 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 -14\n16+40 is 56, plus 36 is 92, minus 2 is 90, minus 14 is 76. Definitely not zero.\n\nHow about \\(x=-2\\):\n\\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) -14\\)\nWhich is 16 - 40 + 36 +2 -14\n16-40 is -24, plus 36 is 12, plus 2 is 14, minus 14 is 0. So, -2 is another root!\n\nCool, two roots so far: 1 and -2. Let me note that down.\n\nNext, \\(x=7\\):\n\\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 -7 -14\\)\nCalculate each term:\n7^4 is 2401, 5*343 is 1715, 9*49 is 441\nSo adding up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116, plus 441 is 4557. Then, minus 7 is 4550, minus 14 is 4536. That's way more than zero. So 7 is not a root.\n\nHow about \\(x=-7\\):\n\\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) -14\\)\nCompute step by step:\n(-7)^4 is 2401, 5*(-343) is -1715, 9*49 is 441\nSo 2401 -1715 = 686, plus 441 is 1127, plus 7 is 1134, minus 14 is 1120. Not zero.\n\nOkay, moving to \\(x=14\\):\n\\(14^4 +5*14^3 +9*14^2 -14 -14\\)\nThat's 14^4 which is 14*14=196, 196*14=2744, 2744*14=38416\nThen, 5*14^3: 14^3 is 2744, so 5*2744=13720\n9*14^2: 14^2=196"

That's way too big.\n\nLastly, \\(x=-14\\):\n\\((-14)^4 +5*(-14)^3 +9*(-14)^2 -(-14) -14\\)\nCalculates to:\n(-14)^4 is 14^4=38416, 5*(-14)^3=5*(-2744)=-13720, 9*(196)=1764\nSo, 38416 -13720 = 24696, plus 1764 is 26460, plus 14 is 26474, minus 14 is 26460. Definitely not zero.\n\nSo, from testing all the possible integer candidates, only \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\) satisfy the equation. Therefore, the integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me double-check for \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\).\n\nFor \\(x=1\\):\n\\(1 +5 +9 -1 -14 = (1+5)=6, 6+9=15, 15-1=14, 14-14=0\\). Correct.\n\nFor \\(x=-2\\):\n\\(16 -40 +36 +2 -14 = (16-40)=-24, (-24 +36)=12, (12+2)=14, (14-14)=0\\). Correct.\n\nEverything checks out. So yeah, the integer roots are 1 and -2.\n</think>\n\nThe integer roots of the equation are 1 and -2.\n\n1, -2\n\n\\boxed{1}, \\boxed{-2}"
