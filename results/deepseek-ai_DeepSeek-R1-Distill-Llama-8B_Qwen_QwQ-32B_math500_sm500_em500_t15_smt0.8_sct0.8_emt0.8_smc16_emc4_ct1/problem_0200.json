            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: x\u2074 + 5x\u00b3 + 9x\u00b2 - x - 14 = 0. I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, where do I start? I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. I think it says that any possible rational root, like p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nIn this case, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, possible values for p are the factors of -14, which are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, and \u00b114. Since q is 1, the possible rational roots are just these p values: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114. \n\nAlright, so I need to test these candidates to see if they satisfy the equation. Let me start by plugging in the positive ones first.\n\nTesting x = 1:  \n1\u2074 + 5*1\u00b3 + 9*1\u00b2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1+5) + (9-1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0.  \nOkay, so x=1 is a root!\n\nSince 1 is a root, I can factor out (x - 1) from the polynomial. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division. Maybe synthetic division is quicker.\n\nSetting up synthetic division with root 1:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x\u2074), 5 (x\u00b3), 9 (x\u00b2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nBring down the 1. Multiply by 1: 1*1=1. Add to next coefficient: 5+1=6.\n\nMultiply 6 by 1: 6*1=6. Add to next coefficient: 9+6=15.\n\nMultiply 15 by 1: 15*1=15. Add to next coefficient: -1+15=14.\n\nMultiply 14 by 1: 14*1=14. Add to last coefficient: -14+14=0. Perfect, no remainder.\n\nSo the polynomial factors as (x - 1)(x\u00b3 + 6x\u00b2 + 15x + 14).

            "output": " need to factor the cubic polynomial.\n\nLet me try possible roots on the cubic again using the Rational Root Theorem. The constant term is 14, and leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nTest x = -1:  \n(-1)\u00b3 + 6*(-1)\u00b2 + 15*(-1) +14 = -1 + 6*1 + (-15) +14 = -1 +6 -15 +14 = (-1 +6) + (-15 +14) = 5 -1 = 4 \u22600.\n\nx = -2:  \n(-2)\u00b3 + 6*(-2)\u00b2 +15*(-2) +14 = -8 + 6*4 + (-30) +14 = -8 +24 -30 +14 = (-8+24) + (-30+14) = 16 -16=0.  \nAwesome, x=-2 is a root!\n\nSo, factor out (x + 2) from x\u00b3 +6x\u00b2 +15x +14.\n\nUsing synthetic division again with root -2:\n\nCoefficients: 1, 6, 15, 14.\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by -2: 1*(-2)=-2. Add to 6: 6 + (-2)=4.\n\nMultiply 4 by -2: 4*(-2)=-8. Add to 15:15 + (-8)=7.\n\nMultiply 7 by -2:7*(-2)=-14. Add to 14:14 + (-14)=0. Perfect.\n\nSo now the cubic factors into (x + 2)(x\u00b2 +4x +7). Therefore, the original polynomial is (x -1)(x +2)(x\u00b2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, look at the quadratic: x\u00b2 +4x +7. Let's check if it factors or has real roots. Discriminant D = 16 -28 = -12, which is negative, so no real roots. Therefore, the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, did I check all possible integer roots? I considered all \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114 for the first polynomial, and only 1 and -2 worked. So yes, I think that's all.\n</think>\n\nThe integer roots of the"

The problem says \"Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.\" So probably the correct formatting is two boxed numbers separated by commas.

But maybe they want both in one box. Let me check the example in the problem. The user's example shows \"Please put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So maybe all answers in one box separated by commas. Let me see.\n\nThe standard way for multiple answers is \\boxed{1} and \\boxed{-2} each boxed individually, but the problem says \"Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.\" So maybe inside a single box: \\boxed{-2,1} or \\boxed{1, -2}. Let me confirm.\n\nThe problem says \"Enter all the integer roots, separated by commas.\" So the answer should be like \\boxed{1}, \\boxed{-2} but the instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" Hmm, conflicting. Wait, the user's instruction says \"Please must put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" So maybe all in one box.

Please must put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nSo the final answer must be within a single box. So if there are multiple answers, they should be inside the box separated by commas. So the correct formatting is \\boxed{-2, 1} or \\boxed{1, -2}. Since order doesn't matter, but usually from smallest to largest, so \\boxed{-2,1} is better.\n\nWait, but in my solution, I found 1 and -2. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I tested x=1, it worked. Then factoring out (x-1), then the cubic had x=-2 as a root, so that's correct. So the integer roots are 1"
