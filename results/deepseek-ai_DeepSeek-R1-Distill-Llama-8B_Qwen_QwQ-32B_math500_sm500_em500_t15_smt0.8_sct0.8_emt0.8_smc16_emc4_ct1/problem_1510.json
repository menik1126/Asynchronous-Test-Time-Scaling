Since there are 26 different letters in the alphabet and each of the two positions must be different, the number of options for the letters is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of possible combinations for the digits. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9), and each of the two digit positions must also be different. Therefore, the number of options for the digits is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of possible license plates, we'll analyze the number of choices for each segment of the plate.\n\n1. **Letters Segment:**\n   - There are 26 different letters (A-Z).\n   - Since the two letters must be different, the number of possible combinations is:\n     \\[\n     26 \\times 25 = 650\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Digits Segment:**\n   - There are 10 different digits (0-9).\n   - Again, since the two digits must be different, the number of possible combinations is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Total License Plate Combinations:**\n   - Multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations:\n     \\[\n     650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{58,\\!500}\n\\]"
