            "output": "First, let's determine how many choices there are for the letters part of the license plate. Since each license plate requires two different letters and there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, the number of possible combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, we'll calculate the number of possible combinations for the numbers part of the license plate. Each license plate needs two different single-digit numbers, and there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9). Therefore, the number of combinations for the numbers is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nAfter determining the combinations for both the letters and the numbers, we'll multiply these two results together to find the total number of possible license plates. This is because each letter combination can be paired with each number combination.\n\nSo, the total number of license plates that can be formed is (26 \u00d7 25) \u00d7 (10 \u00d7 9).\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many license plates can be formed under the given conditions.\n\n**Problem:**  \nYou need to determine the total number of unique license plates that can be created if each license plate consists of:\n- **2 different letters** from the alphabet (A-Z).\n- **2 different single digits** from the numbers (0-9).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Number of Possible Letter Combinations**\n\n1. **Total Letters:** There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).  \n2. **Choosing the First Letter:** For the first position, you can choose any of the 26 letters.  \n3. **Choosing the Second Letter:** For the second position, you cannot choose the same letter as the first, so you have 25 remaining options.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Letter Combinations} = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Number of Possible Number Combinations**\n\n1. **Total Numbers:** There are 10 digits (0-9).  \n2. **Choosing the First Number:** For the first position, you can choose any of the 10 digits.  \n3. **Choosing the Second Number:** For the second position, you cannot choose the same digit as the first, so you have 9 remaining options.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number Combinations} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Total Number of License Plates**\n\nSince each letter combination"
