A fraction will result in a repeating decimal if the denominator has prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\nThe fraction is \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\). I need to factorize the denominator, 11111. One way to factorize is to check if it's a prime number. However, doing so manually is time-consuming. Instead, I can use a factoring tool or recognize that 11111 is a repunit number. Repunit numbers are of the form \\(10^n - 1\\). For \\(n = 5\\), \\(10^5 - 1 = 99999\\), which is close but not exactly 11111. Therefore, 11111 might have smaller prime factors.\n\nUpon further research, I find that 11111 factors into \\(41 \\times 271\\). Both 41 and 271 are prime numbers. Since the denominator has prime factors other than 2 and 5, the decimal will indeed be a repeating decimal.\n\nNext, to find the length of the repeating period, I can use the formula related to the maximum of the orders of 10 modulo each prime factor. The orders of 10 modulo 41 and 271 need to be calculated. Specifically, I need to determine the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod 41\\) and \\(10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod 271\\).\n\nCalculating the order of 10 modulo 41:\n- \\(10^1 \\mod 41 = 10\\)\n- \\(10^2 \\mod 41 = 100 \\mod 41 = 19\\)\n- \\(10^3 \\mod 41 = 190 \\mod 41 = 8\\)\n- \\(10^4 \\mod 41 = 80 \\mod 41 = 12\\)\n- \\(10^5 \\mod 41 = 120 \\mod 41 = 20\\)\n- \\(10^6 \\mod 41 = 200 \\mod 41 = 16\\)\n- \\(10^7 \\mod 41 = 160 \\mod 41 = 7\\)\n- \\(10^8 \\mod 41 = 70 \\mod 41 = 5\\)\n- \\(10^"
