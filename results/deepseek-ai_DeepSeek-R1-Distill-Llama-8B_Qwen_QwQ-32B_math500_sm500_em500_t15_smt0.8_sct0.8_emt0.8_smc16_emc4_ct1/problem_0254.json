            "output": "To determine how many digits repeat in the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), I need to understand the concept of repeating decimals. When a fraction like \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) results in a repeating decimal, the number of repeating digits is related to the denominator after simplifying the fraction.\n\nFirst, I'll simplify \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\). Since 31 is a prime number and does not divide evenly into 11111, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nNext, I'll consider the properties of the denominator, which is 11111. To find the number of repeating digits, I'll need to determine the length of the repeating cycle. This is done by finding the smallest positive integer \\(d\\) such that \\(10^d \\equiv 1 \\mod 11111\\). This is related to the concept of the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 11111.\n\nSince 11111 is equal to \\(10^5 - 1\\), it can be factored as \\(11111 = 41 \\times 271\\). The least common multiple of the orders of 10 modulo 41 and 271 will give the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 11111.\n\nCalculating the multiplicative order for each prime factor:\n- For 41, the order is 4 because \\(10^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 41\\).\n- For 271, the order is 5 because \\(10^5 \\equiv 1 \\mod 271\\).\n\nThe least common multiple of 4 and 5 is 20, so the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 11111 is 20. This means the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) will have a repeating cycle of 20 digits.\n\nTherefore, the number of digits that repeat in the decimal expansion is 20.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - When a fraction like \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) results in a repeating decimal, the length of the repeating sequence of digits is determined by the properties of the denominator after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n2. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - The given fraction is \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\).\n  "

This is known as the multiplicative order of 10 modulo 11111.\n   - To find this, we calculate the multiplicative orders of 10 modulo each prime factor (41 and 271) and then take their least common multiple (LCM).\n\n5. **Calculate Multiplicative Order for Each Prime Factor:**\n   - **For 41:**\n     - Find the smallest \\(d_1\\) such that \\(10^{d_1} \\equiv 1 \\mod 41\\).\n     - Testing powers of 10 modulo 41, we find \\(10^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 41\\).
