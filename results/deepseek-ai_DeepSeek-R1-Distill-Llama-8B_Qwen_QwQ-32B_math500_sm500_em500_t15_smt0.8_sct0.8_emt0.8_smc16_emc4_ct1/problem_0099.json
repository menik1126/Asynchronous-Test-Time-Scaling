The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nAnd I know that this has to be true for all real values of x except -8 and 3 because those would make the denominators zero and the expression undefined.\n\nHmm, I remember from school that when you have an equation like this where two fractions add up to another fraction, you can probably combine them on the left side and then set the numerators equal. So, let me try that.\n\nFirst, I notice that the denominators on the left side are (x - 3) and (x + 8). To add these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The common denominator would be the product of (x - 3) and (x + 8), right? So, that would be (x - 3)(x + 8).\n\nLet me rewrite each fraction with this common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait, I should check if the denominator on the right side factors correctly. The denominator is x² + 5x - 24. Let me factor that. I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 5. Let's see, 8 and -3 work because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, it factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). That matches the common denominator I found. Good.\n\nSo, the left side after combining becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x -"

Since this is a linear equation in x, the coefficients of x and the constant terms must be equal on both sides.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) is Cx + 8C\n\nD(x - 3) is Dx - 3D\n\nSo combining these gives:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nSo, the left side is (C + D)x + (8C - 3D) and the right side is 4x - 23.\n\nNow, since these are equal for all x, the coefficients of x must be equal and the constant terms must be equal. That gives me a system of two equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nSo now I have a system:\n\nC + D = 4\n\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve for C and D. Let's use substitution or elimination. Maybe substitution is easier here.\n\nFrom the first equation, I can express D in terms of C:\n\nD = 4 - C\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the second term:\n\n8C - 3*4 + 3*C = -23\n\nWhich is:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8C + 3C) - 12 = -23\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, substitute C back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Therefore, the product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my work.\n\nIf C ="
