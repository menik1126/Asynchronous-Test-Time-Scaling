            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD given that the sum of two fractions, C/(x - 3) and D/(x + 8), equals another fraction (4x - 23)/(x² + 5x - 24) for all real x except -8 and 3. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a rational expression like this, especially when it's equal to another rational expression, you can probably use partial fractions to break it down. Partial fractions are useful because they allow you to express a complicated fraction as a sum of simpler ones, which in this case are C/(x - 3) and D/(x + 8). So, I think I should set up the equation accordingly.\n\nLet me write down what's given:\n\nC/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/(x² + 5x - 24).\n\nNow, I notice that the denominator on the right side can be factored. Let me try factoring x² + 5x - 24. To factor a quadratic of the form x² + bx + c, I need two numbers that add up to b and multiply to c. In this case, b is 5 and c is -24. Hmm, what two numbers add up to 5 and multiply to -24? Let me think: 8 and -3. Yes, because 8 + (-3) = 5 and 8 * (-3) = -24. So, the denominator factors as (x + 8)(x - 3). \n\nTherefore, I can rewrite the equation as:\n\nC/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)].\n\nNow, the left side has two fractions with denominators (x - 3) and (x + 8), and the right side has a single denominator that's the product of these two. This is perfect for combining the left side over a common denominator. Let me do that.\n\nSo, to combine C/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8), I'll multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by (x + 8) and the second fraction by (x -"

So, I can set the numerators equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23.\n\nNow, expanding the left side:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23.\n\nLet me combine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23.\n\nSo, this equation is supposed to hold true for all x except 3 and -8. That means the coefficients of the corresponding powers of x must be equal on both sides. So, I can set up a system of equations by equating the coefficients of x and the constant terms.\n\nFirst, the coefficients of x:\n\nC + D = 4.\n\nSecond, the constant terms:\n\n8C - 3D = -23.\n\nSo now I have a system of two equations:\n\n1) C + D = 4\n\n2) 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I need to solve this system for C and D. Let me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. From Equation 1, I can express C in terms of D or vice versa. Let me solve Equation 1 for C:\n\nC = 4 - D.\n\nNow, substitute C into Equation 2:\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23.\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23.\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5.\n\nSo, D is 5. Now, substitute back into Equation 1 to find C:\n\nC = 4 -"
