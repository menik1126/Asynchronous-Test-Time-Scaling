This means both gears should have made an integer number of full rotations.\n\nFor the first gear, it turns 33 1⁄3 times per minute. To find out how many full rotations it makes in one minute, I can write 33 1⁄3 as the fraction 100/3, meaning it makes 100/3 rotations per minute. Therefore, in 3 minutes, it completes 100 rotations.\n\nFor the second gear, it turns 45 times per minute. This means it completes 45 full rotations every minute.\n\nTo find when both gears align again, I need to find a common multiple of their rotation periods. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 1 is 3. This means after 3 minutes, both gears will have made complete rotations and their marks will point north again.\n\nFinally, to convert 3 minutes into seconds, I multiply by 60, resulting in 180 seconds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine when both gears will have their marks pointing due north again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods after which each gear completes an integer number of full rotations.\n\n1. **First Gear:**\n   - Turns **33 1⁄3** times per minute.\n   - Convert to a fraction: \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\) turns per minute.\n   - Therefore, the gear makes **100** full turns in **3** minutes.\n\n2. **Second Gear:**\n   - Turns **45** times per minute.\n   - This gear makes **45** full turns in **1** minute.\n\n3. **Finding the LCM:**\n   - We need the smallest time when both gears complete an integer number of turns.\n   - LCM of **3** (from first gear) and **1** (from second gear) is **3** minutes.\n\n4. **Convert Minutes to Seconds:**\n   - \\( 3 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds per minute} = 180 \\text{ seconds} \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{180}"
