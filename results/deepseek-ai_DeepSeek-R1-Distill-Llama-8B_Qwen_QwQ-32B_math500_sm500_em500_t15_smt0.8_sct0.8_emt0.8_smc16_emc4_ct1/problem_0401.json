The first gear turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute, and the second gear turns 45 times per minute. To find when their marks will both point north again, I should find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods.\n\nSince the first gear turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute, I'll convert this to a fraction to make calculations easier. \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) is the same as \\(\\frac{100}{3}\\) rotations per minute.\n\nNext, I'll find the LCM of \\(\\frac{100}{3}\\) and 45. To do this, I can use the formula for the LCM of two fractions:\n\\[\nLCM\\left(\\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}\\right) = \\frac{LCM(a, c)}{GCD(b, d)}\n\\]\nHere, \\(a = 100\\), \\(b = 3\\), \\(c = 45\\), and \\(d = 1\\). The LCM of 100 and 45 is 900, and the GCD of 3 and 1 is 1. Therefore, the LCM is \\(\\frac{900}{1} = 900\\) rotations.\n\nHowever, since we're looking for the time in seconds, I need to convert the LCM from rotations per minute to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\\[\n900 \\text{ rotations} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds per rotation} = 54,\\!000 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\nFinally, I'll verify by checking the rotation counts for each gear after 54,000 seconds to ensure they both align their marks north.\n</think>\n\nTo determine when both gears will next align their marks pointing due north, we'll analyze their rotation rates and find the next time they both complete an integer number of full rotations simultaneously. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### **Step 1: Understand Gear Rotations**\n- **Gear A:** Turns \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) times per minute.\n- **Gear B:** Turns \\( 45 \\) times per minute.\n\n### **Step 2: Convert"
