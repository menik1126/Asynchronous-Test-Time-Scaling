            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me picture the rectangle. Since AB is the length and AD is the width, and AB/AD = k, that means the rectangle is longer in the direction of AB. So, if I consider the rectangle centered at the origin O(0,0), then the coordinates of the vertices would be something like A(-a, b), B(a, b), C(a, -b), and D(-a, -b), right? Wait, let me think about how to define the sides. Maybe it's better to assign AB as the length 2a and AD as the width 2b, so that O is the center. Then AB = 2a and AD = 2b, which gives AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, that means a = k*b. Okay, that seems manageable.\n\nSo, the rectangle has vertices at (-a, b), (a, b), (a, -b), (-a, -b). Now, the center O is at (0,0). I need to figure out the region within this rectangle where any point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D. The probability will be the area of that region divided by the area of the rectangle.\n\nHmm, how do I determine the set of points closer to O than to any vertex? Well, for a given point (x,y), the distance to O is sqrt(x² + y²). The distance to A is sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²), right? Similarly, distances to B, C, D can be written down. So, I need the set of points where the distance to O is less than the distance to each of A, B, C, D.\n\nBut that might be complicated because each condition would define a region, and the intersection of all those regions would be the locus of points closer to O than to any vertex. Maybe it's easier to find the boundaries where the distance to O equals the distance to each vertex and then find the intersection of the regions"

Since the rectangle is symmetric, perhaps the regions closer to each vertex are congruent and arranged symmetrically. So, maybe the area closer to O is the central region bounded by the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex?\n\nWait, yes, that's probably the way to go. The set of points equidistant to O and a vertex is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining O and that vertex. So, for each vertex, the bisector between O and that vertex will form a boundary. The region where the point is closer to O than to that vertex is on the O side of the bisector. The intersection of all these regions (for all four vertices) will be the area we need.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the equations of these bisectors and then find the area of the region bounded by all four bisectors within the rectangle.\n\nLet me try to work this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define coordinates. Let me set the rectangle with center at (0,0). Let me let the rectangle have length 2a along the x-axis and width 2b along the y-axis. So, vertices are at (a, b), (-a, b), (-a, -b), (a, -b). Wait, actually, hold on. Wait, if AB is the length, then AB is the side from A to B. Let me confirm the coordinates again.\n\nAssuming the rectangle is placed with sides parallel to the axes, then:\n\n- Let’s say point A is (-a, b), B is (a, b), C is (a, -b), D is (-a, -b). Then AB is the top side, from (-a, b) to (a, b), so the length of AB is 2a. The side AD is from (-a, b) to (-a, -b), so its length is 2b. Therefore, the ratio AB/AD is (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, a = k*b. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the rectangle has sides of length 2a and 2b, with a = k*b. The area of the rectangle is (2a)*(2b) = 4ab = 4k*b². But maybe it's better to keep a and b as separate variables for now,"

The midpoint between O(0,0) and A(-a, b) is (-a/2, b/2). The slope of OA is (b - 0)/(-a - 0) = -b/a. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal, which is a/b.\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is (y - b/2) = (a/b)(x + a/2).\n\nSimilarly, for vertex B(a, b). The midpoint is (a/2, b/2). The slope of OB is (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a, so the perpendicular bisector has slope -a/b.\n\nEquation: (y - b/2) = (-a/b)(x - a/2).\n\nSame idea for vertices C(a, -b) and D(-a, -b). Let me check:\n\nFor C(a, -b): midpoint is (a/2, -b/2). Slope of OC is (-b - 0)/(a - 0) = -b/a, so perpendicular bisector slope is a/b.\n\nEquation: (y + b/2) = (a/b)(x - a/2).\n\nFor D(-a, -b): midpoint is (-a/2, -b/2).

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region closer to O than any vertex is the set of points where the distance to O is less than the distance to each vertex. So, for each vertex, the inequality is sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt( (x - x_v)^2 + (y - y_v)^2 ), where (x_v, y_v) is the vertex.\n\nSquaring both sides (since distances are non-negative):\n\nx² + y² < (x - x_v)^2 + (y - y_v)^2\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\nx² - 2x x_v + x_v² + y² - 2y y_v + y_v²\n\nSubtract left side:\n\n0 < -2x x_v + x_v² -2y y_v + y_v²\n\nSo,\n\n2x x_v + 2y y_v < x_v² + y_v²\n\nSo, for each vertex, this inequality must hold.\n\nTherefore, for each vertex, we can write the inequality.\n\nLet me do this for each vertex:\n\nVertex A: (-a, b)\n\nInequality:\n\n2x*(-a)"
