I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the rectangle. Asy code shows that it's drawn from (-250, 100) to (250, 100) to (250, -100) to (-250, -100), and O is at the origin (0,0). So, the rectangle is centered at the origin, with sides of length 500 (from -250 to 250) in the x-direction and 200 in the y-direction. Wait, is that right? AB is the length from A(-250,100) to B(250,100), so that's 500 units. AD is from A(-250,100) to D(-250,-100), which is 200 units. So, AB is 500, AD is 200. So, the ratio AB/AD is 500/200 = 2.5. But in the problem, this ratio is given as k. So, k = AB/AD = 2.5 in this case. But actually, in the problem, k is given as a variable, so maybe I should express my answer in terms of k.\n\nBut let me first consider the problem without assigning specific values. The rectangle has AB and AD as its sides, with AB/AD = k, so AB = k * AD. Therefore, if I let AD = x, then AB = kx. But maybe it's easier to assign specific lengths for AB and AD based on the aspect ratio given by k. So, let me assume that AB = k and AD = 1, just to make calculations easier. Then, the rectangle is k units long and 1 unit wide, centered at O. Wait, but in the Asy code, the rectangle's dimensions are specific, but maybe I should just use a general case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use coordinates. Let me place rectangle ABCD such that O is the origin (0,0), and the rectangle extends from (-a, b) to (a, b) to (a, -b) to (-a, -b). So, the length AB would be 2"

Wait, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides. Let me clarify. In rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, BC is the next, etc. Since O is the center, then coordinates could be set as follows:\n\nLet me let the rectangle have vertices at (-m, n), (m, n), (m, -n), (-m, -n). So that the center is at (0,0). Then, the length of AB would be the length from (-m, n) to (m, n), which is 2m. The length of AD is from (-m, n) to (-m, -n), which is 2n. Wait, actually, AD is from A to D. Wait, in the Asy code, A is (-250,100), D is (-250,-100). So AD is vertical. So AB is horizontal, AD is vertical. Therefore, AB length is 500 (from -250 to 250), AD length is 200 (from 100 to -100). Therefore, in general terms, if AB is the horizontal side and AD is the vertical side, then AB = 2m and AD = 2n. Therefore the ratio k = AB/AD = (2m)/(2n) = m/n. So, k = m/n, so m = k*n. So, if I let AD be 2n, then AB is 2k n. Hmm, maybe I can define the rectangle's sides as length 2a and 2b, so that AB = 2a and AD = 2b, so k = (2a)/(2b) = a/b. So a = k*b. Then coordinates would be (-a,b), (a,b), etc. So maybe this is a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to set AD=1, then AB=k, so AD=1, AB=k, so the rectangle has length k and height 1, centered at the origin. That might simplify calculations. Let me try that.\n\nSo let me set the rectangle's vertices as (-k/2, -1/2"

The sides AB and AD will then have lengths k and 1, respectively, as given by the problem.\n\nSo, the rectangle extends from x = -k/2 to x = k/2, and y = -1/2 to y = 1/2. So, the area of the rectangle is k * 1 = k. Wait, no, the area is length * width, which is AB * AD, which is k * 1, so area is k. But actually, in my coordinates, the length is k (from -k/2 to k/2 is k units) and the width is 1 (from -1/2 to 1/2 is 1 unit). So yes, area is k*1 = k.\n\nWait, but in the Asy code, the rectangle is from (-250,100) to (250,100), etc., which is length 500 in x and 200 in y, but in the problem, AB is the horizontal side, AD is the vertical side, so AB/AD is 500/200=2.5, so k=2.5.\n\nBut perhaps we should not assign specific values but keep it symbolic. So, let's proceed.\n\nI need to find the region within the rectangle where any point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D. Then, the probability will be the area of that region divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, first, let's figure out the set of points (x,y) in the rectangle such that the distance from (x,y) to O is less than the distance to each of the four vertices.\n\nSo, the distance from (x,y) to O is sqrt(x² + y²). The distance from (x,y) to vertex A is sqrt((x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2), where A is (-a, -b), right? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Let me define the rectangle's vertices as follows:\n\n- A is (-a, b)\n\n- B is (a, b)\n\n- C is (a, -b)\n\n- D is (-a, -b"

The vertical side from A to D would go from (-a, b) to (-a, -b), so the length AD is 2b.\n\nTherefore, the ratio AB/AD is (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k, so a = k b.\n\nTherefore, in terms of variables, we can set a = k b. Therefore, the vertices coordinates are:\n\nA: (-k b, b)\n\nB: (k b, b)\n\nC: (k b, -b)\n\nD: (-k b, -b)\n\nAnd the rectangle is centered at (0,0).

Since a = k b, then area is 4k b². Hmm, but perhaps it's better to set b = 1 for simplicity, so that AD = 2, but maybe that complicates.

Alternatively, perhaps to use the rectangle as defined by AB = k and AD = 1, so that the sides are AB = k, AD = 1, so the rectangle is k units in the x-direction and 1 unit in the y-direction, centered at the origin, so points from (-k/2, -1/2) to (k/2, 1/2). So, that the length AB is k, and AD is 1.\n\nBut perhaps this is complicating. Let me fix the rectangle dimensions such that the sides are AB = k and AD = 1. So, the rectangle extends from (-k/2, -1/2) to (k/2, 1/2), so that AB is k (from -k/2 to k/2) and AD is 1 (from -1/2 to 1/2). Therefore, the area is k * 1 = k, which is good because the probability is area-based.\n\nSo, now, let me consider a point (x, y) inside this rectangle.

Wait, actually, the point must be closer to O than to any of the four vertices, so it must satisfy the inequality for all four vertices. Therefore, the region is the intersection of the four regions where the distance to O is less than the distance to each vertex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the Voronoi regions around each vertex and the center, but since the center is not a vertex, it's a bit different.

So, this region is the intersection of the regions where distance to O is less than distance to A, less than distance to B, less than distance to C, and less than distance to D.\n\nAlternatively, since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe the regions where the point is closer to O than to each vertex can be found by constructing perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex, and the intersection of those regions would be the desired area.\n\nLet me try to find the equations for each bisector.\n\nFirst, let's consider the bisector between O and A.\n\nThe set of points equidistant to O and A is the perpendicular bisector of the segment OA.\n\nSimilarly for the other vertices.\n\nSo, let's compute the perpendicular bisector between O(0,0) and A(-k/2, -1/2).\n\nThe midpoint between O and A is (-k/4, -1/4).\n\nThe slope of OA is ( -1/2 - 0 ) / ( -k/2 - 0 ) = (-1/2)/(-k/2) = 1/k.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector will have slope -k.\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is:\n\ny - (-1/4) = -k (x - (-k/4))\n\nSimplify:\n\ny + 1/4 = -k (x + k/4)\n\ny = -k x - (k^2)/4 - 1/4\n\nSimilarly, we can find the bisectors between O and the other vertices.\n\nLet me do"

The area is 1.\n\nThe region closer to O than to any vertex would be the set of points where distance to O is less than distance to any corner.\n\nIn a square, this region is known to be a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at the centers of the sides of the original square.\n\nWait, in a square of side length 1 (from -0.5 to 0.5 in x and y), the region closer to the center than to any corner is a square with vertices at (±0.25, ±0.25), forming a smaller square rotated by 45 degrees. Wait, actually, the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side is 0.5, but the distance to the corner is sqrt(0.5² +0.5²)=sqrt(0.5). The region closer to the center would be within a circle of radius sqrt(0.5)/2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute for k=1.\n\nLet me set k=1, so the rectangle is a square with vertices at (-0.5, -0.5), (0.5, -0.5), etc.\n\nThe four inequalities become:\n\n1. 1*x + y > - (1 +1)/4 = -0.5 → x + y > -0.5\n\n2. -1*x + y > -0.5 → -x + y > -0.5\n\n3. -1*x - y > -0.5 → -x - y > -0.5 → x + y < 0.5\n\n4. 1*x - y > -0.5 → x - y > -0.5 → -x + y < 0.5\n\nWait, let me re-express all inequalities for k=1:\n\n1. x + y > -0.5\n\n2. -x + y > -0.5\n\n3. -x - y > -0.5 → x + y < 0.5\n\n4. x - y > -0.5 → -x + y < 0.5\n\nWait, the fourth inequality: x - y > -0.5 → rearranged as y < x +0.5\n\nWait, perhaps better to write all four inequalities:\n\n"
