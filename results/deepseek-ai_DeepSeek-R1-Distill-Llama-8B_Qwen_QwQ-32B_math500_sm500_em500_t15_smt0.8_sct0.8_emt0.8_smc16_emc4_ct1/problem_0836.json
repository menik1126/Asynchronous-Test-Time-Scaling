Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. It wants the maximum value of a fraction where the numerator is \\(x - y\\) and the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\). Since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can be any real numbers, I need to find the pair \\((x, y)\\) that makes this fraction as large as possible.\n\nI remember that when dealing with fractions, to maximize the value, I want the numerator to be as large as possible and the denominator to be as small as possible. So, I should look for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(x - y\\) is maximized while \\(x^4 + y^4\\) is minimized.\n\nHmm, but it's tricky because both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) affect the numerator and denominator. Maybe I can set up some kind of equation or use calculus to find the extrema.\n\nLet me denote the function as \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). To find its maximum, I can use partial derivatives and set them equal to zero.\n\nFirst, I'll compute the partial derivatives of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\) is:\n\\[\nf_x = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\nSimplify the numerator:\n\\[\n= \\frac{x^4 + y^4 + 6 - 4x^4 + 4x^3 y}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n= \\frac{-3x^4 + 4x^3 y + y^4 + 6}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) is:\n\\[\nf_y = \\frac{-(1"
