This leaves the possible values of x as:\n2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n\nTherefore, there are 7 possible values for x.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of possible values for \\( x \\) when distributing \\( 54 \\) cards among \\( x \\) players, where each player gets \\( y \\) cards. The constraints are \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( y \\geq 5 \\).\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship:**\n   \n   \\[\n   x \\times y = 54\n   \\]\n   \n   This means that \\( y \\) must be a divisor of \\( 54 \\).\n\n2. **Find the Divisors of 54:**\n   \n   To find the possible values of \\( x \\), we first list all divisors of \\( 54 \\):\n   \n   \\[\n   1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Apply the Constraint \\( x \\geq 2 \\):**\n   \n   Since \\( x \\) must be at least \\( 2 \\), we exclude \\( 1 \\) from the list of divisors.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Possible values of } x: 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Count the Possible Values:**\n   \n   There are \\( 7 \\) possible values for \\( x \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]"
