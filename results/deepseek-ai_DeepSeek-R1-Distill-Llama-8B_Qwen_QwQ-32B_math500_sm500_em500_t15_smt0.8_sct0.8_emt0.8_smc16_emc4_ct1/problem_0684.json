Therefore:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{54}{y}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( y \\) is at least 5, the smallest possible value for \\( y \\) is 5. I'll list all the possible divisors of 54 that are greater than or equal to 5.\n\nThe divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54. From this list, the values that satisfy \\( y \\geq 5 \\) are 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\nThus, the possible values for \\( x \\) are 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54, making a total of 5 possible values.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of possible values for \\( x \\) given the constraints:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Total cards: \\( 54 \\)\n   - Each player receives \\( y \\) cards.\n   - \\( x \\) (number of players) is at least \\( 2 \\) (\\( x \\geq 2 \\)).\n   - \\( y \\) (cards per player) is at least \\( 5 \\) (\\( y \\geq 5 \\)).\n\n2. **Express \\( x \\) in Terms of \\( y \\):**\n   Since the total number of cards distributed is \\( 54 \\), and each player gets \\( y \\) cards, the number of players \\( x \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{54}{y}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Determine Possible Values of \\( y \\):**\n   Given \\( y \\geq 5 \\), we need to find all divisors of \\( 54 \\) that are greater than or equal to \\( 5 \\).\n\n4. **List the Divisors of 54:**\n   \\[\n   54 \\divisors = 1,\\ 2,\\ 3,\\ 6,\\ 9,\\ 18,\\ "
