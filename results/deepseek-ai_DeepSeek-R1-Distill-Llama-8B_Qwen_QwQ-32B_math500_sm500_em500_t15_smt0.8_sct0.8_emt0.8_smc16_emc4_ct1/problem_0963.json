Initially, Denali walks \\( 16 \\) dogs and Nate walks \\( 12 \\) dogs, so the ratio is \\( R = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nUnder the first scenario, if Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, she'll have \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs, while Nate still has \\( 12 \\) dogs. The new ratio becomes \\( R = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\). Since the ratio remains the same, I can set up the equation \\( \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nIn the second scenario, if \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, Denali will have \\( 16 + x \\) dogs and Nate will have \\( 12 - x \\) dogs. The new ratio is \\( R = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\). Setting this equal to \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), I get the equation \\( \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\). Solving this will give me the value of \\( x \\).\n\nAfter solving both equations, I'll ensure that \\( x \\) is consistent across both scenarios to find the correct value.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let**:\n- \\( D = \\) Denali's number of dogs = 16\n- \\( N = \\) Nate's number of dogs = 12\n- \\( x = \\) number of dogs in the group for assignment/reassignment\n\n**Given Ratios**:\n1. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is the same in both scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1**: Denali is assigned \\( 4x \\) more dogs, while Nate stays at 12 dogs.\n- Denali's new dogs: \\( D + 4x = 16 + 4x \\)\n- Nate's dogs remain: \\( N = 12 \\)\n- **Ratio**: \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\"
