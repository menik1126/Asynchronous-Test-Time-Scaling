            "output": "First, I recognize that the denominator of the fraction is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\). The presence of both 2 and 5 as prime factors means the denominator is a product of powers of 2 and 5, which is necessary for the fraction to be a terminating decimal.\n\nTo convert the fraction to a decimal, I'll express it with a denominator that only has 10 as the prime factor. This can be done by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \\(5^{(2-7)}\\) to reduce the exponent of 5 in the denominator.\n\nCalculating \\(5^{(2-7)}\\) gives \\(5^{-5}\\), which is the same as \\(\\frac{1}{5^5}\\). Multiplying the numerator by \\(\\frac{1}{5^5}\\) results in \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21 \\cdot 5^{-5}}{10^5}\\).\n\nNext, I'll divide 21 by \\(10^5\\) to find the decimal representation. Dividing 21 by 100,000 yields 0.00021.\n\nFinally, I'll present the fully converted fraction as 0.00021.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\). Since the prime factors of the denominator include both 2 and 5, the fraction is already set up to be a terminating decimal.\n\n2. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   To express the fraction with a base of 10 (i.e., \\(10^5\\)), you can rewrite the denominator as \\(10^5\\) times the remaining power of 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21}{(2^2 \\cdot 5^2) \\cdot 5^5} = \\frac{21}{10^2 \\cdot 5^5}\n   \\]\n   \n   Multiply numerator and denominator by \\(5^5\\) to eliminate the \\(5^5\\) in the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\cdot 5^5}{10^2 \\cdot 5^5 \\"

Let me correct it.\n\n   **Correct Approach:**\n   To convert the denominator to a power of 10, note that \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 5^5 = 10^2 \\cdot 5^5\\). To make the denominator \\(10^7\\), multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^5\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\times \\frac{2^5}{2^5} = \\frac{21 \\cdot 2^5}{(2^2 \\cdot 2^5) \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21 \\cdot 32}{10^7}\n   \\]\n   \n   Calculate \\(2^5 = 32\\), so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\cdot 32}{10^7} = \\frac{672}{10^7}\n   \\]\n   \n   Now, divide 672 by \\(10^7\\) (which is 10,000,000):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{672}{10,000,000} = 0.0000672\n   \\]\n   \n   Wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion. Let me re-examine.\n\n   **Final Correct Approach:**\n   The denominator \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\) can be rewritten as \\(5^5 \\cdot 10^2\\). To make the denominator a power of 10, multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^5\\) to balance the exponents of 2 and 5:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\times \\frac{2^5}{2^5} = \\frac{21 \\cdot 2^5}{(2^2 \\cdot 2^5) \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21 \\cdot 32}{10^7}\n   \\]\n"
