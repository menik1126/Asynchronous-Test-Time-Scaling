Add 1 to get the second term: 0 + 1 = 1.\n2. Multiply by 1 to get the third term: 1 × 1 = 1.\n3. Add 2 to get the fourth term: 1 + 2 = 3.\n4. Multiply by 2 to get the fifth term: 3 × 2 = 6.\n5. Add 3 to get the sixth term: 6 + 3 = 9.\n6. Multiply by 3 to get the seventh term: 9 × 3 = 27.\n7. Add 4 to get the eighth term: 27 + 4 = 31.\n8.

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
