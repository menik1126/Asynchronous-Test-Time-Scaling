            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the absolute value of w, where w is given as (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7), and z is 1 + i. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that for complex numbers, the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number a + bi is calculated as the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So, if I can express w in the form a + bi, then I can find its modulus by applying this formula.\n\nGiven z = 1 + i, let me compute 3z + 1 and 5z + 7 first. Maybe I should calculate those separately before plugging them into w.\n\nStarting with 3z + 1: since z is 1 + i, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(1 + i) = 3*1 + 3*i = 3 + 3i. Then adding 1, we get 3 + 3i + 1, which simplifies to 4 + 3i.\n\nSimilarly, for 5z + 7: 5*(1 + i) = 5*1 + 5*i = 5 + 5i. Adding 7 gives 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i.\n\nSo now, w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). Hmm, dividing complex numbers can be tricky. I think the standard method is to multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it.\n\nThe conjugate of the denominator, which is 12 + 5i, is 12 - 5i. So, I should multiply both the numerator and denominator by 12 - 5i.\n\nLet's do that:\n\nw = [(4 + 3i)*(12 - 5i)] / [(12 + 5i)*(12 - 5i)]\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the denominator because it's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which should give a real number. Let me compute that:\n\n(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i) = 12^2 - (5i)^2 = 144 - 25i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 144 - 25*(-1) = "

            "output": "144 + 25 = 169.\n\nOkay, so the denominator is 169. That simplifies things.\n\nNow, the numerator is (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i). Let me use the distributive property (FOIL method) to expand this:\n\nFirst, 4*12 = 48.\n\nOuter, 4*(-5i) = -20i.\n\nInner, 3i*12 = 36i.\n\nLast, 3i*(-5i) = -15i^2.\n\nSo, combining all these terms:\n\n48 - 20i + 36i -15i^2.\n\nLet me combine like terms. The real parts are 48 and -15i^2. Since i^2 is -1, -15i^2 is equal to 15. So, 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nThe imaginary parts are -20i + 36i, which is 16i.\n\nSo, putting it together, the numerator is 63 + 16i.\n\nNow, w is equal to (63 + 16i)/169. Since the denominator is real, this is already in the form a + bi, where a = 63/169 and b = 16/169.\n\nTo find |w|, the modulus, I use the formula sqrt(a^2 + b^2):\n\n|w| = sqrt( (63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2 )\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute each squared term:\n\n(63/169)^2 = (3969)/(169^2)\n(16/169)^2 = (256)/(169^2)\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n3969 + 256 = 4225\n\nSo, |w| = sqrt(4225 / (169^2)).\n\nBut 4225 is a perfect square; let me recall, 65^2 is 4225. So,\n\nsqrt(4225 / (169^2)) = sqrt(4225)/sqrt(169^2) = 65 / 169\n\nWait, sqrt(4225) is 65 because 65*65 = 4225, and sqrt(169^2) is 169 because 169*169 is 28561.\n\nSo, 65/169 can be simplified. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 13. 65 ÷13 = 5, and"

Correct.\n\n5z +7: 5*(1+i)=5+5i, +7 is 12+5i. Correct.\n\nw=(4+3i)/(12+5i). Multiply numerator and denominator by 12-5i.\n\nDenominator: (12+5i)(12-5i)=144-25i^2=144+25=169. Correct.\n\nNumerator: (4+3i)(12-5i)= 4*12=48, 4*(-5i)=-20i, 3i*12=36i, 3i*(-5i)=-15i²=15. So, 48 +15=63; -20i +36i=16i. So, numerator is 63 +16i. Correct.\n\nSo, w=(63+16i)/169.
