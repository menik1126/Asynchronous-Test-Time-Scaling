            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where z is given as 1 + i, and w is defined as (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). I need to find the magnitude of w, which is denoted as |w|. Hmm, complex numbers can sometimes be a bit tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for complex numbers, the magnitude can be found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. So, if I can express w in the form a + bi, then |w| would just be sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). That seems straightforward, but I also need to handle the complex expressions here.\n\nSo, starting with the given z = 1 + i. Let me note that z is a complex number with real part 1 and imaginary part 1. Now, w is given as (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). That looks like a complex fraction. Maybe I should compute both the numerator and the denominator separately and then simplify.\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 3z + 1. Since z = 1 + i, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i. Then adding 1 to that would be 3 + 1 + 3i = 4 + 3i. So, the numerator simplifies to 4 + 3i.\n\nNow, the denominator is 5z + 7. Again, z is 1 + i, so 5*z is 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i. Adding 7 to that gives 5 + 7 + 5i = 12 + 5i. So, the denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nSo now, w is equal to (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). This is a complex fraction; it's a complex number divided by another complex number. My next step should be to rationalize the denominator. I can do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.\n\nThe complex conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i, because you just change the sign of the imaginary part. So, let me multiply both numerator and denominator by 12 - 5i.\n\nSo, that gives"

Now, I need to compute both the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nStarting with the denominator: (12 + 5i)*(12 - 5i). I recall that when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you get a real number. The formula is (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. So, here, a is 12 and b is 5i. Therefore, it's 12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2. 12 squared is 144, and (5i) squared is 25i\u00b2. But since i\u00b2 is -1, that becomes 25*(-1) = -25. So, 144 - (-25) is 144 + 25 = 169. So, the denominator simplifies to 169.\n\nNow, the numerator: (4 + 3i)*(12 - 5i). Let me use the distributive property (FOIL method) here. Multiply each term in the first complex number by each term in the second.\n\nSo, 4*12 is 48, 4*(-5i) is -20i, 3i*12 is 36i, and 3i*(-5i) is -15i\u00b2. Let's write that out:\n\n48 - 20i + 36i - 15i\u00b2.\n\nNow, combining like terms. The real parts are 48 and -15i\u00b2. The imaginary parts are -20i + 36i.\n\nI know that i\u00b2 is -1, so -15i\u00b2 is -15*(-1) = 15. So, the real parts become 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nFor the imaginary parts, -20i + 36i is (36 - 20)i = 16i.\n\nSo, putting it together, the numerator is 63 + 16i.\n\nTherefore, w is (63 + 16i)/169.\n\nTo find |w|, which is the magnitude, I can now write w as (63/169) + (16/169)i. So, the real part is 63/169 and the imaginary part is 16/169.\n\nThus, |w| is sqrt[(63/169)\u00b2 + (16/169)\u00b2]. Hmm"

Then take the square root, which would give sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2)/169.\n\nWait, actually, sqrt[(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2)/(169\u00b2)] is equal to sqrt(63\u00b2 + 16\u00b2)/169. So, calculating sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2) first.\n\nLet me compute 63 squared: 63*63. Let me do that calculation:\n\n60\u00b2 = 3600, 3\u00b2 = 9, and 2*60*3 = 360. So, (60 + 3)\u00b2 = 60\u00b2 + 2*60*3 + 3\u00b2 = 3600 + 360 + 9 = 3969.\n\nSimilarly, 16 squared is 256. So, adding 3969 and 256: 3969 + 256. Let's compute that:\n\n3969 + 200 = 4169, 4169 + 56 = 4225. So, 63\u00b2 +16\u00b2 = 4225.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(4225) is 65, since 65\u00b2 = 4225. So, sqrt(4225) is 65.\n\nTherefore, |w| is 65/169. Now, I can simplify that fraction. Let me see if 65 and 169 have any common factors. 65 is 5*13, and 169 is 13\u00b2. So, both have a factor of 13.\n\nSo, 65 divided by 13 is 5, and 169 divided by 13 is 13. Therefore, 65/169 simplifies to 5/13.\n\nSo, the magnitude of w is 5/13.\n\nWait, let me just go through that step again to confirm I didn't make a mistake. Calculating sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2) gives 65, yes, and sqrt(169\u00b2) is 169, so overall sqrt(4225/28561). Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, no, my calculation might have gone a bit off.\n\nWait, let me correct that. When I write sqrt[(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2)/(169\u00b2)], that's the same as sqrt(4225)/(169), because 63\u00b2 +16\u00b2 is 4225, and "

So, sqrt(4225)/169 = 65/169, which simplifies to 5/13 as before.\n\nWait, but 65/169 is 5/13, because 65 divided by 13 is 5, and 169 divided by 13 is 13. So, yes, 5/13.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about this another way: Once I have w = (63 +16i)/169, then |w| is |63 +16i| divided by 169. Because |w| = |(63 +16i)| / |169|, and since 169 is a real number, |169| is 169. But |63 +16i| is sqrt(63\u00b2 +16\u00b2) = 65, so |w| is 65/169 =5/13.\n\nSo, I think that checks out.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I can compute w numerically and then find its magnitude, as a way to verify.\n\nz =1 +i, so let me compute numerator 3z +1: 3*(1 +i) +1 =3 +3i +1 =4 +3i, as before.\n\nDenominator 5z +7 =5*(1 +i) +7 =5 +5i +7=12 +5i, as before.\n\nSo, w=(4+3i)/(12+5i). Dividing complex numbers: let me compute that as a decimal. Maybe that will help me cross-verify.\n\nSo, let me compute (4 + 3i)/(12 +5i).\n\nFirst, I can write this as (4 +3i)*1/(12 +5i). Let me compute this.\n\nAlternatively, compute the magnitude of numerator and denominator, then take the quotient.\n\nThe magnitude of numerator is sqrt(4\u00b2 +3\u00b2)=5. The magnitude of denominator is sqrt(12\u00b2 +5\u00b2)=13. Therefore, |w| =5/13.\n\nWait, that's another way to think about it. So, since |w| = |numerator| / |denominator|, because when you divide complex numbers, their magnitudes divide. So, |w|= |3z +1| / |5"

Since |w| = |(3z +1)/(5z +7)| = |3z +1| / |5z +7|.\n\nSo, compute |3z +1| and |5z +7| separately.\n\nFirst, compute 3z +1 where z =1 +i. As before, that's 3*(1 +i) +1 =4 +3i. The magnitude is sqrt(4\u00b2 +3\u00b2)=sqrt(16+9)=sqrt(25)=5.\n\nThen, compute 5z +7. That's 5*(1 +i) +7 =5 +5i +7=12 +5i. The magnitude is sqrt(12\u00b2 +5\u00b2)=sqrt(144 +25)=sqrt(169)=13.\n\nTherefore, |w|=5/13. So, that's the same answer as before, but with a much simpler calculation. So, that's a good check.\n\nHmm, so why did I go through the trouble of rationalizing the denominator earlier? Because I thought I had to compute the real and imaginary parts, but actually, since magnitude is multiplicative over division, I could have just taken the magnitudes of numerator and denominator directly. That's a good reminder.\n\nSo, the key insight here is that the magnitude of a quotient of complex numbers is the quotient of their magnitudes. So, |w| = |3z +1| / |5z +7|. That's a much more straightforward approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5/13. Let me just confirm once again.\n\nWait, let me check the first method again where I multiplied out the numerator and denominator. The final result was (63 +16i)/169. Let me compute the magnitude of that:\n\nsqrt( (63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2 ) = sqrt( (63^2 +16^2)/169^2 ) = sqrt(4225)/169 = 65/169 =5/13. Yep, same result. So, both methods agree.\n\nTherefore"
