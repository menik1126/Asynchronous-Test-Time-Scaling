            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find P(16) for a quadratic polynomial P(x). The problem says that P(x) is sandwiched between two other quadratics for all real numbers x. Specifically, it's given that x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3. Additionally, we know that P(11) = 181. I need to figure out what P(16) is.\n\nFirst off, let me digest what's given. P(x) is a quadratic, so it has the general form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers. The inequalities tell me that for every x, the value of P(x) must lie between two other quadratics: the lower bound is x² - 2x + 2, and the upper bound is 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nSo, to write this out mathematically, for all real x:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ ax² + bx + c ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nThat means that both the lower and upper inequalities must hold for all x. That is:\n\n1. ax² + bx + c ≥ x² - 2x + 2 for all x.\n2. ax² + bx + c ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all x.\n\nSince these inequalities hold for all x, they must hold for all the coefficients of corresponding powers of x. So, if I subtract the left-hand sides from both sides or the right-hand sides, I should get equalities for the coefficients.\n\nLet me write the inequalities as:\n\n(1) ax² + bx + c - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n(2) (2x² - 4x + 3) - (ax² + bx + c) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSimplifying both:\n\nFor inequality (1):\n\n(a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nFor inequality (2):\n\n(2 - a)x² + (-b - 4)x + (3 - c) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nNow, since these quadratics in x are non"

For this quadratic to be non-negative for all x, the leading coefficient (a - 1) must be ≥ 0. Also, discriminant D1 must be ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, for inequality (2):\n\nQuadratic: (2 - a)x² + (-b - 4)x + (3 - c). The leading coefficient here is (2 - a). Since this must be non-negative (because the quadratic must be ≥0 for all x), so 2 - a ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≤ 2.\n\nAdditionally, its discriminant D2 must also be ≤ 0.\n\nSo let's write down the conditions:\n\nFrom inequality (1):\n1. a - 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≥ 1\n2. D1 = (b + 2)² - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0\n\nFrom inequality (2):\n1. 2 - a ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≤ 2\n2. D2 = (-b - 4)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0\n\nAdditionally, we have the condition that P(11) = 181. Since P(x) = ax² + bx + c, substituting x=11:\n\na*(11)^2 + b*(11) + c = 181 ⇒ 121a + 11b + c = 181. Let's note that equation as (3).\n\nNow, so the problem is to find a, b, c such that all these conditions are satisfied, and then compute P(16) = a*(16)^2 + b*(16) + c.\n\nSince the quadratic inequalities must hold for all x, the quadratics in (1) and (2) must be perfect squares or always non-negative. But perhaps the inequalities are tight at some points? Maybe equality holds at some points, which would give us equations instead of inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, since both quadratics ("

            "output": "from inequalities 1 and 2) must be non-negative for all x, their discriminants must be non-positive. So we can write down those discriminant conditions.\n\nLet me write discriminant conditions:\n\nFor D1 ≤ 0:\n\n(b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, for D2 ≤ 0:\n\n(-b -4)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0.\n\nThese give us two inequalities:\n\n1. (b + 2)^2 ≤ 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2)\n2. (-b -4)^2 ≤ 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c)\n\nMoreover, we have a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ 2.\n\nSo, now we have a system with three equations: the two discriminant inequalities and the equation from P(11)=181, which is 121a +11b +c=181.\n\nBut this is a system of inequalities and an equation, which might be a bit tricky. Maybe I can think of it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think that the quadratics in inequalities (1) and (2) must touch the x-axis at exactly one point each because they must be non-negative for all x, so they must have discriminant zero (i.e., they are perfect squares). So, maybe the inequalities are actually equalities at discriminant zero, so the quadratics are tangent to the x-axis.\n\nIf that's the case, discriminants D1 and D2 would be zero.\n\nLet me assume that both D1 and D2 are zero. Maybe that's the only way the inequalities hold for all x. Because if the discriminant is positive, then the quadratic will cross the x-axis somewhere, meaning it wouldn't be non-negative everywhere. So, for the inequalities to hold for all x, the discriminants must be zero, meaning the quadratics are perfect squares, just touching the x-axis. So, D1 = D2 = 0.\n\nSo, setting D1 = 0 and D2 = 0:\n\n1. (b + 2)^2 = 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2)\n2. (-b -4)^2 = 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c)\n\nThese give two equations.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: ("
