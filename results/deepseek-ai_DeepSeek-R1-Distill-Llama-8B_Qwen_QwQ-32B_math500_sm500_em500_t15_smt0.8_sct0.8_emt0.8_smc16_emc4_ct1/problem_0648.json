            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a quadratic polynomial P(x). Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. That means P(x) is of the form ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers. \n\nIt also gives an inequality: x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all real numbers x. Hmm, okay, so P(x) is sandwiched between these two quadratics for every real x. That probably means that P(x) is kind of in the middle of these two functions, maybe touching them at certain points? Or perhaps they are the same polynomial? But no, the coefficients are different.\n\nThey also tell me that P(11) = 181, and I need to find P(16). Alright, so my goal is to find the value of P at 16, given this information.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since P(x) is a quadratic between two other quadratics, perhaps I can express P(x) as a linear combination of these two. Let me define:\n\nP(x) = λ(x² - 2x + 2) + μ(2x² - 4x + 3)\n\nWhere λ and μ are constants between 0 and 1 because the inequalities have ≤ and ≤. So, 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ μ ≤ 1. Is that right? Because if λ is more than 1, then P(x) might exceed the upper bound, and if μ is more than 1, it might exceed the lower bound. So yes, λ and μ must be between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, but does that necessarily cover all quadratics between those two? Hmm, actually, maybe. Because if you take any quadratic that's between the two, it can be expressed as a convex combination, right? Since both 2x² -4x +3 and x² -2x +2 are quadratics, and the space of quadratics is two-dimensional, you can write P(x) as a linear combination with coefficients between 0 and 1.\n\nOkay, so I can write P(x) as λ(x² - 2x + 2) + μ(2x² -4x +3)."

Let me see:\n\nLet me compute that expression:\n\nλ(x² - 2x + 2) + μ(2x² -4x +3) = (λ + 2μ)x² + (-2λ -4μ)x + (2λ + 3μ)\n\nSo, P(x) = (λ + 2μ)x² + (-2λ -4μ)x + (2λ + 3μ)\n\nSince P(x) is a quadratic, this is okay. But also, the coefficients must satisfy the inequalities for all x. Wait, but actually, the way I set it up, if λ and μ are between 0 and 1, then P(x) would be between the two quadratics. But maybe there's another way to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is non-negative, and the difference between the upper bound and P(x) is non-negative. So:\n\nP(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x,\n\nand\n\n(2x² -4x +3) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nTherefore, both of these expressions must be non-negative quadratics. Since they are quadratics, their discriminants must be non-positive (so they don't cross the x-axis) and their leading coefficients must be non-negative.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me denote:\n\nLet me call Q1(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x,\n\nand Q2(x) = (2x² -4x +3) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nTherefore, Q1(x) and Q2(x) are both non-negative quadratics. \n\nLet me write Q1(x) = P(x) - (x² -2x +2) = (a -1)x² + (b +2)x + (c -2) ≥ 0 for all x,\n\nand Q2(x) = (2x² -4x +3) - P(x) = (2 -a)x² + (-4 -b)x + (3 -c) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSince both Q1 and Q2 are non-negative for all real x, they must be quadratic polynomials that"

Maybe from the discriminant conditions?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps there is a smarter way. Since P(x) is between the two quadratics for all x, they must touch at their \"vertex points\" or something like that. Maybe they have the same vertex? Because if P(x) is between them everywhere, their minima must coincide, right?\n\nSo let's compute the vertex of both quadratics.\n\nThe general form of a quadratic is f(x) = Ax² + Bx + C. Its vertex is at x = -B/(2A). The minimum value is f(-B/(2A)).\n\nSo, let's find the vertex of x² - 2x + 2.\n\nA = 1, B = -2, so vertex at x = 2/(2*1) = 1.\n\nCompute f(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1.

Both quadratics have their minimum at x=1, and both have the same minimum value of 1. So they both touch at the point (1,1). So the minimum of both is 1 at x=1. Therefore, P(x) must also have its minimum at x=1, and since it's sandwiched between them, its minimum must also be 1. Because if P(x) is between them everywhere, then at x=1, P(1) must be between 1 and 1, so exactly 1. Therefore, P(1) =1.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Since at x=1, the lower bound is 1 and the upper bound is also 1, so P(1) must equal 1. So that gives another equation: P(1) =1.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n1. P(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c =1.\n\n2. P(11) = 121a +11b +c =181.\n\nSo that's two equations. We need a third equation. Since P(x) is a quadratic, and it's between the two given quadratics, perhaps the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is a perfect square? Or maybe the difference between upper and lower is a perfect square?\n\nAlternatively, since both quadratics have the same vertex, maybe P(x) is also a quadratic with vertex at x=1, so its vertex is at (1,1). Let me see.\n\nIf P(x) has its vertex at (1,1), then its equation can be written as P(x) = k(x -1)^2 +1. Since it's a quadratic, that's possible. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nWait, but if P(x) is between the two quadratics, which also have their vertex at (1,1), then maybe P(x) is also of the form k(x-1)^2 +1, but with k between 1 and 2?

Let's test that.\n\nCompute P(x) = a(x² -2x +1) +1 = a x² -2a x +a +1.\n\nTherefore, P(x) is a quadratic with leading coefficient a, linear coefficient -2a, and constant term a +1.\n\nSo let me write the coefficients as:\n\na = a,\n\nb = -2a,\n\nc = a +1.\n\nSo we can express b and c in terms of a.\n\nSo now, let's plug P(11) =181 into that.\n\nCompute P(11) = a*(121) + (-2a)*(11) + (a +1) = 121a -22a +a +1 = (121 -22 +1) a +1 = 100a +1 = 181.\n\nSo 100a +1 =181 ⇒ 100a =180 ⇒ a = 1.8.\n\nHmm, 1.8 is 9/5 or 1.8.\n\nSo a=1.8=9/5.\n\nThus, P(x) = (9/5)x² - (18/5)x + (9/5 +1) = (9/5)x² - (18/5)x + 14/5.\n\nSo P(x) = (9/5)x² - (18/5)x + 14/5.\n\nNow, let's check whether this indeed lies between the two quadratics given.\n\nLet me compute P(x) - (x² -2x +2) = (9/5 -1)x² + (-18/5 +2)x + (14/5 -2) = (4/5)x² + (-8/5)x + 4/5.\n\nFactor 4/5: 4/5(x² -2x +1) = 4/5(x-1)^2, which is always non-negative, as expected.\n\nSimilarly, (2x² -4x +3) - P(x) = (2 - 9/5)x² + (-4 + 18/5)x + ("
