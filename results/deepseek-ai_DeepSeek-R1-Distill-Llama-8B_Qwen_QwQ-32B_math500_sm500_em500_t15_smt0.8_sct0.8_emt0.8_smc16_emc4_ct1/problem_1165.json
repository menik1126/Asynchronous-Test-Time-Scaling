So, (3^k)^6 becomes 3^(k*6).\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to 3^(6k) = 3^6.\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: 6k = 6.\n\nFinally, to solve for k, I'll divide both sides by 6, which gives k = 1.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[\n(3^k)^6 = 3^6\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Apply the Power of a Power Property**\n\nRecall that when a power is raised to another power, you multiply the exponents:\n\\[\n(a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\n\\]\nApplying this to the left side of the equation:\n\\[\n(3^k)^6 = 3^{k \\cdot 6}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Set the Exponents Equal**\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n3^{6k} = 3^6\n\\]\nSince the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[\n6k = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\(k\\)**\n\nTo find \\(k\\), divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n\\[\nk = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
