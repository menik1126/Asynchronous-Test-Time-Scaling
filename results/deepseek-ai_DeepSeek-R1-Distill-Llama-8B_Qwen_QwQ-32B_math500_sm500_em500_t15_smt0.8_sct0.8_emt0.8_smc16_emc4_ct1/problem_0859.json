            "output": "First, I understand that the problem says half the value of \\(3x - 9\\) is equal to \\(x + 37\\). So, I'll start by writing this relationship as an equation.\n\nNext, to make it easier to solve, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2. This will eliminate the fraction and give me a simpler equation to work with.\n\nAfter that, I'll distribute the multiplication on both sides to remove the parentheses. This results in a linear equation with no variables on the right side, which is easier to solve.\n\nNow, I'll combine like terms on the left side by adding 9 and 18. This gives me an equation with \\(x\\) on both sides, which is a good step toward isolating the variable.\n\nTo get all the \\(x\\) terms on one side, I'll subtract \\(x\\) from both sides. This leaves me with a constant on the other side, which can then be solved for \\(x\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing the constant term by the coefficient of \\(x\\). This gives me the value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the original equation.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Problem:**\nHalf the value of \\( 3x - 9 \\) is \\( x + 37 \\). What is the value of \\( x \\)?\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Write the equation**\nAccording to the problem, half the value of \\( 3x - 9 \\) equals \\( x + 37 \\). This can be written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate the fraction**\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\cdot (x + 37)\n\\]\n\\[\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Rearrange the equation**\nSubtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides to gather like terms:\n\\[\n3x - 2x - 9 = 2x - 2x + 74\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)**\nAdd 9 to both"
