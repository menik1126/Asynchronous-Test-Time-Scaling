This implies that I need to multiply the expression \\(3x - 9\\) by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times (3x - 9)\\) equals \\( \\frac{3x}{2} - \\frac{9}{2} \\).\n\nNext, I'll set this equal to \\(x + 37\\) as given in the problem.\n\nThis gives the equation: \\( \\frac{3x}{2} - \\frac{9}{2} = x + 37 \\).\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, I'll multiply the entire equation by 2. This simplifies the equation to \\(3x - 9 = 2x + 74\\).\n\nNow, I'll subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get all the x terms on one side: \\(x - 9 = 74\\).\n\nFinally, I'll add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\), resulting in \\(x = 83\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction.\n\n\\[\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to isolate the \\(x\\)-terms.\n\n\\[\n3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n\\[\nx = 74 + 9\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 83\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{83}\n\\]"
