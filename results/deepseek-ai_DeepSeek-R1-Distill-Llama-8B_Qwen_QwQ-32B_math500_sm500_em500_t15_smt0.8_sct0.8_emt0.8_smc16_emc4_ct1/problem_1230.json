Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with congruences, especially modulo operations, replacing the variable with its equivalent value modulo the given number can simplify things. So since n is congruent to 2 mod 7, that means n ≡ 2 (mod 7). Therefore, I can replace every n in the expression with 2 to simplify the calculation. That should make it easier to compute.\n\nSo, the expression is (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Let me compute each term one by one.\n\nStarting with n + 2: Since n ≡ 2, substituting gives 2 + 2 = 4. So, the first term is 4.\n\nNext, n + 4: Substituting again, that would be 2 + 4 = 6. So, the second term is 6.\n\nThen, n + 6: Substituting, 2 + 6 = 8. But wait, 8 divided by 7 gives a remainder. Let me check that. 7 goes into 8 once with a remainder of 1, so 8 ≡ 1 mod 7. So, the third term is 1.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to multiplying these three results: 4 * 6 * 1. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 4 and 6: 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nThen, multiply 24 by 1: 24 * 1 = 24.\n\nSo, the product is 24. Now, I need to find 24 modulo 7 to find the remainder when divided by 7. Let's divide 24 by 7.\n\n7 * 3 = 21, which is less than 24. The difference is 24 - 21 = 3. Therefore, 24 ≡ 3 mod 7.\n\nHmm, so the remainder should be 3. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Replace n with 2 in each term because n ≡ 2 mod"

            "output": " 7. That gives me 4, 6, and 1. That seems right.\n2. Multiply them: 4 * 6 is 24, then 24 * 1 is still 24. That makes sense.\n3. Finally, 24 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 3. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this in a different way. Maybe using properties of modular arithmetic instead of substitution. Let me explore that to confirm.\n\nI know that (a * b * c) mod m = [(a mod m) * (b mod m) * (c mod m)] mod m. So, that property holds because modular multiplication distributes over addition.\n\nSo, let's compute each term modulo 7 first.\n\n(n + 2) mod 7: Since n ≡ 2, 2 + 2 = 4 mod 7.\n\n(n + 4) mod 7: 2 + 4 = 6 mod 7.\n\n(n + 6) mod 7: 2 + 6 = 8, which is 1 mod 7.\n\nSo, same as before, multiplying 4 * 6 gives 24, which is 3 mod 7, and 3 * 1 = 3 mod 7.\n\nYep, same result. So, that confirms it. The remainder is 3.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. I considered substitution and verifying through both methods.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we utilize the given congruence and substitute \\( n \\) with its equivalent value modulo 7.\n\n1.
