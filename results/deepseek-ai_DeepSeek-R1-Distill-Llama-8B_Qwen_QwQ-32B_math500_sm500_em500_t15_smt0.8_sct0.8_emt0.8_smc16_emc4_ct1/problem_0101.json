The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nAnd this has to hold for all real values of x except -8 and 3, because those would make the denominators zero. \n\nHmm, alright. So I remember that when you have an equation like this, where you have two fractions on the left and one on the right, it's probably a case for partial fractions or something like that. Maybe I can combine the left side into a single fraction and then set it equal to the right side, then equate the numerators.\n\nFirst, let me factor the denominator on the right side to see if it matches the left side. The denominator is \\( x^2 + 5x - 24 \\). Let me see, can I factor that? Let's find two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3: 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So yes, it factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). So the right side denominator is (x + 8)(x - 3), same as the left side denominators. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if I have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nThen, the strategy is to combine the left side into a single fraction with denominator (x - 3)(x + 8). To do this, I'll need a common denominator, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). So, I'll have to adjust the numerators accordingly.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal for all x (except -"

I can expand the left side:\n\nC * x + C * 8 + D * x - D * 3 = 4x - 23\n\nLet me combine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nSo, this means that the coefficients of x on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms must be equal.\n\nSo, setting up the system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nSo now I have two equations with two variables, C and D. I can solve this system to find C and D.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nC + D = 4      ...(1)\n\n8C - 3D = -23 ...(2)\n\nI can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nFrom equation (1): C = 4 - D\n\nSo, substitute this into equation (2):\n\n8*(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 -32\n\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo, D is 5.\n\nNow, substitute D = 5 back into equation (1):\n\nC + 5 = 4\n\nSo, C = 4 -5 = -1\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nTherefore, the product CD is (-1) * 5 = -5.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to be sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, with C = -1 and D = 5, plug back into equation (1):\n\n-1 + 5 = 4, which is correct.\n\nNow, plug into equation (2):\n\n8*(-1) -3*(5) = -8 -15 = -23, which is also correct.\n\nSo, that"
