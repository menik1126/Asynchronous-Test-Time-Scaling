            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product CD, where C and D are integers. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, first, I remember that when you have fractions like this, especially with linear denominators, you can combine them using partial fractions. Maybe that's the method I should use here. \n\nLet me rewrite the equation to make it clearer. The denominator on the right side is a quadratic, which can be factored. Let me see if I can factor \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let me think: 8 and -3. Because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, the denominator factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). \n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, I remember that to solve for C and D, I can express the right side as a sum of two fractions with denominators (x - 3) and (x + 8). So, let me write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nI think the next step is to combine the left side so that it has the same denominator as the right side. That way, I can equate the numerators. To combine the left side, I'll need a common denominator, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). \n\nSo, I'll multiply the first fraction by (x + 8)/(x + 8) and the second fraction by (x - 3)/(x - 3):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3"

That gives us a system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: \\(C + D = 4\\)\n2. Constant term: \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nSo now, I have two equations with two variables, C and D. I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(C = 4 - D\\)\n\nSubstituting into equation 2:\n\n\\(8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\\)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\(32 - 8D - 3D = -23\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(32 - 11D = -23\\)\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n\\(-11D = -55\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\n\\(D = 5\\)\n\nNow, substitute D = 5 back into equation 1:\n\n\\(C + 5 = 4\\)\n\nSo, \\(C = 4 - 5 = -1\\)\n\nTherefore, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nThe question asks for the product CD, which is (-1) * 5 = -5.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting from the original equation, I correctly factored the denominator. Then, set up the equation with partial fractions, combining the numerators correctly.

            "output": ", leading to the system of equations C + D = 4 and 8C - 3D = -23.\n\nSolving by substitution: C = 4 - D, so substituted into the second equation: 8*(4 - D) - 3D = -23. 32 -8D -3D = -23, so 32 -11D = -23. Then subtract 32: -11D = -55, so D = 5. Then C = 4 -5 = -1.\n\nThat seems correct. The product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nI think that's the right answer.
