There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and each license plate must have 2 different letters. Since the order of the letters matters, I'll calculate the number of permutations for the letters.\n\nNext, I'll address the digits. There are 10 possible digits (0-9), and each of the two number positions must also be different. Similar to the letters, the order of the digits matters, so I'll calculate the permutations for the digits.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of digit combinations to find the total number of unique license plates that can be formed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll analyze the given constraints:\n\n1. **Letters**: \n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).\n   - We need **2 different letters** for each license plate.\n   - **Order matters** (e.g., \"AB\" is different from \"BA\").\n\n2. **Digits**:\n   - There are 10 possible digits (0-9).\n   - We need **2 different digits** for each license plate.\n   - **Order matters** (e.g., \"11\" is not allowed, and \"12\" is different from \"21\").\n\n**Calculations**:\n- **Letters Combinations**:\n  \\[\n  P(26, 2) = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n  \\]\n  \n- **Digits Combinations**:\n  \\[\n  P(10, 2) = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n  \\]\n\n- **Total License Plates**:\n  \\[\n  650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
