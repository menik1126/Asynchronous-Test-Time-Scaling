            "output": "To determine the number of possible license plates, I need to consider the structure of the license plate. Each plate has 2 different letters followed by 2 different digits.\n\nFirst, for the letters, there are 26 possible choices for the first letter and 25 remaining choices for the second letter since they must be different. This gives 26 multiplied by 25 possible combinations for the letters.\n\nNext, for the digits, there are 10 possible choices for the first digit and 9 remaining choices for the second digit. This results in 10 multiplied by 9 possible combinations for the digits.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of unique license plates, I multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Structure of the License Plate:**\n   - **Letters:** 2 different letters from A-Z.\n   - **Digits:** 2 different digits from 0-9.\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Possible Letter Combinations:**\n   - **First Letter:** 26 options (A-Z).\n   - **Second Letter:** 25 options (since it must be different from the first letter).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total letter combinations} = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Number of Possible Digit Combinations:**\n   - **First Digit:** 10 options (0-9).\n   - **Second Digit:** 9 options (since it must be different from the first digit).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total digit combinations} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determining the Total Number of License Plate Combinations:**\n   - Multiply the total letter combinations by the total digit combinations.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total license plates} = 650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
