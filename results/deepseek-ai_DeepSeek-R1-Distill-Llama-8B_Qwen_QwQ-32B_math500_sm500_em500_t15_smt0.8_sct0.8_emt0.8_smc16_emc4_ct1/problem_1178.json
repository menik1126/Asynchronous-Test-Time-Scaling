First, I remember that complex roots can be plotted on the complex plane, forming points. Since it's a fourth-degree equation, there should be four roots, which would form a quadrilateral—probably a convex one.\n\nBut before jumping into plotting, maybe I can factor the equation. It looks a bit complicated, but perhaps it can be written in a more manageable form. Let me try to see if it resembles any known polynomial forms.\n\nLooking at the coefficients: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Hmm. The coefficients involve i, which is the imaginary unit. Maybe this polynomial can be expressed in terms of another variable substitution. It reminds me of something similar to the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\), but let me check that.\n\nLet's compute \\( (z + i)^4 \\):\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 \\)\nSimplify each term:\n\n- \\( z^4 \\) stays as is.\n- \\( 4z^3i \\) is okay.\n- \\( 6z^2i^2 = 6z^2(-1) = -6z^2 \\).\n- \\( 4zi^3 = 4z(-i) = -4zi \\).\n- \\( i^4 = 1 \\).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi + 1 \\).\n\nWait a second, that looks almost like our original equation.

So, this suggests that if I can adjust the equation to match \\( (z + i)^4 \\), maybe by subtracting 1 and adding i.\n\nLet me write:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi + 1 \\)\n\nSo, if I have:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 - 1 - i = 0 \\)\n\nWhich would mean:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\)\n\nHmm, let me check:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\)\n\nSo, this equation is a fourth-degree polynomial, and perhaps it's easier to solve by taking the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, if I let \\( w = z + i \\), then the equation becomes:\n\n\\( w^4 = 1 + i \\)\n\nSo, the solutions for \\( w \\) are the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\). Once I find those, I can subtract \\( i \\) from each to get \\( z \\), the original variable.\n\nAlright, so first, let's express \\( 1 + i \\) in polar form because taking roots is easier that way.\n\n\\( 1 + i \\) is in the first quadrant. The modulus is \\( \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\). The argument is \\( \\pi/4 \\) radians because tan^{-1}(1/1) is 45 degrees or \\( \\pi/4 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) \\).\n\nTo find the fourth roots, we can write each root as \\( \\sqrt[4]{|\\sqrt{2}|} \\left( \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi/4 + 2\\pi k}{4} \\right) + i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi/4 + 2\\pi k}{4} \\"

So if \\( w = u + iv \\), then \\( z = u + iv - i = u + i(v - 1) \\).\n\nSo, in modulus and argument terms, subtracting \\( i \\) is equivalent to subtracting 1 from the imaginary part.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the coordinates after subtracting \\( i \\).\n\nBut perhaps I can stick to using coordinates directly.\n\nSo, let me compute each root \\( z_k \\):\n\n\\( z_k = w_k - i \\).\n\nSo, for each \\( k = 0,1,2,3 \\), compute \\( w_k - i \\):\n\nGiven that \\( w_k = 2^{1/8} [ \\cos(\\theta_k) + i \\sin(\\theta_k) ] \\), so\n\n\\( z_k = 2^{1/8} [ \\cos(\\theta_k) + i \\sin(\\theta_k) ] - i \\)\n= \\( 2^{1/8} \\cos(\\theta_k) + i [2^{1/8} \\sin(\\theta_k) - 1 ] \\)\n\nSo, the real part is \\( 2^{1/8} \\cos(\\theta_k) \\), and the imaginary part is \\( 2^{1/8} \\sin(\\theta_k) - 1 \\).\n\nSo, coordinates of \\( z_k \\) are \\( ( 2^{1/8} \\cos(\\theta_k), 2^{1/8} \\sin(\\theta_k) - 1 ) \\"

The formula was \\( \\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{\\pi k}{2} \\). So:\n\nFor k=0: π/16 + 0 = π/16\n\nk=1: π/16 + π/2 = π/16 + 8π/16 = 9π/16\n\nk=2: π/16 + π = π/16 + 16π/16 = 17π/16\n\nk=3: π/16 + 3π/2 = π/16 + 24π/16 = 25π/16\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, each angle is spaced by π/2 (90 degrees), starting at π/16. So, the four roots of \\( w^4 = 1 + i \\) are equally spaced around a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), starting at angle π/16 and every π/2 radians.\n\nTherefore, when we subtract i (which is (0,1) in complex plane), each of these points is shifted down by 1 unit in the imaginary direction.\n\nHmm, so the polygon is formed by these four points. Since the original roots w are on a circle, but shifted down by i, so the polygon is a rotated and shifted square? Or maybe a rotated square?\n\nWait, but the original roots w are equally spaced on a circle, so they form a square.

If I shift each point by a translation, the distances and angles remain the same, just the position changes.\n\nSo, if originally the points form a square (they're equally spaced on a circle), then after shifting, they still form a square, just moved somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, the polygon is a square, and the area is the same as the area of the original square.\n\nSo, what's the area of the original square? Since the roots lie on a circle of radius \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\). The side length of the square is \\( s = 2r \\sin(\\pi/4) = 2r \\times \\sqrt{2}/2 = r \\sqrt{2} \\). Wait, no, actually, no, the distance between two adjacent points on the circle is the chord length.\n\nWait, chord length between two points separated by angle θ on a circle of radius r is \\( 2r \\sin(\\theta/2) \\). Here, the angle between each adjacent point is π/2, so θ = π/2. Therefore, chord length is \\( 2r \\sin(\\pi/4) = 2r (\\sqrt{2}/2) = r \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nBut actually, for a square inscribed in a circle, the side length is equal to \\( \\sqrt{2} r \\), since the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 2r. So, the diagonal d = 2r, so side length s = d / sqrt(2) = 2r / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) r.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting, but let's think: For a square inscribed in a circle of radius r, the diagonal is 2r. Therefore, the side length is 2r / sqrt(2) = r * sqrt(2). So, area is (side length)^2 = (r * sqrt(2))^2 = 2 r^2.\n\nSo, the area of the square is 2 r^2. Since r is \\( 2^{1/8} \\), r^2 is \\( 2^{1/4} \\). Therefore, area is 2 * 2^{1/4} = 2^{1"

Since 5 and 4 are coprime, that would be the answer. Then a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.\n\nBut wait, but hold on. The problem says the solutions are the vertices of the polygon. But we shifted the square down by 1 unit. Does that affect the area?\n\nWait, no. Translating a shape doesn't change its area.

Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the equation given is z^4 +4 z^3 i -6 z^2 -4 z i -i =0.\n\nI noticed that (z + i)^4 expands to z^4 +4 z^3 i -6 z^2 -4 z i +1. Comparing to the given equation, the difference is the constant term: +1 vs -i. Therefore, the equation can be written as (z + i)^4 = 1 + i.

The roots w are the fourth roots of 1 + i, which are equally spaced on a circle of radius |1 + i|^{1/4} = (sqrt(2))^{1/4} = 2^{1/8}, as I had before. The angles are spaced at π/2 starting from π/16.

But, in the complex plane, these roots are four points on a circle of radius 2^{1/8}, each separated by angle π/2, but shifted down by 1 in the imaginary direction.\n\nSo, in effect, the polygon is a square, but the four points aren't equally spaced on the original circle—they're each shifted down. But when you connect them, it's still a square because the distances and the geometric relations are preserved via translation.\n\nBut is that the case? Because translation doesn't preserve angles, but when you translate a square, it's still a square. So, yes, the polygon remains a square, just moved.\n\nTherefore, the area remains same.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^{5/4}. So, in the required form, 2^{5/4} is 2^{5/4}, so p=2, a=5, b=4.
