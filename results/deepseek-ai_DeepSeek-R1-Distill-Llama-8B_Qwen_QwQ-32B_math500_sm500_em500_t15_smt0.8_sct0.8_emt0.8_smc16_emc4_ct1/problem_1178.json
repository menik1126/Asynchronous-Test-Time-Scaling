Then, express the area in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( p \\) is prime, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime, and then find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst off, this looks like a quartic equation, which can have up to four roots. Since it's a convex polygon, it's probably a quadrilateral, maybe a square or rectangle, but I need to check.\n\nLooking at the equation, I notice that the coefficients are a bit complex—pun intended. Let me see if I can factor this equation or maybe recognize a pattern.\n\nI remember that sometimes complex equations can be factored by grouping or by substitution. Alternatively, maybe this is a quadratic in terms of \\( z^2 \\) or something else. Let me try to manipulate the equation.\n\nWait, the coefficients seem to repeat: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. If I write it as \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i =0 \\), perhaps I can factor it as a quadratic in \\( z^2 \\). Let me try that.\n\nBut hold on, the exponents aren't matching. It's a quartic, but the exponents are 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. So maybe it's a quartic in \\( z \\). But is there a substitution I can make?\n\nAlternatively, maybe this equation is a form of a self-reciprocal polynomial or something similar. Let me check if substituting \\( w = z + 1/z \\) or some other substitution simplifies things.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes higher degree equations can be factored into quadratics or even into linear terms if they have symmetries or roots that satisfy certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I let \\( z = it \\), where \\( t \\) is real, and then see if the equation simplifies.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to rewrite the equation in terms of \\( z \\) and \\( i \\). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively"

Let me check the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( (z + i)^4 \\):\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4 z^3 i + 6 z^2 (i)^2 + 4 z (i)^3 + (i)^4 \\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( z^4 \\)\n- \\( 4 z^3 i \\)\n- \\( 6 z^2 (-1) \\) because \\( i^2 = -1 \\)\n- \\( 4 z (-i) \\) because \\( i^3 = -i \\)\n- \\( 1 \\) because \\( i^4 = 1 \\)\n\nSo altogether:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z + 1 \\)\n\nHmm, comparing this to the given equation:\n\nOriginal equation: \\( z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i =0 \\)\n\nThe expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\) is \\( z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 \\). So the given equation is almost like \\( (z + i)^4 \\), except the constant term is different. Instead of +1, it's -i. So maybe the equation can be written as \\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) = 0 \\). Let me check:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 - (1 + i) = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i \\). Yes! That's exactly the given equation. So the equation simplifies to \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).\n\nTherefore, the solutions are the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), shifted by \\( -i \\). So, if I can find the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), then subtract \\( i \\) from each to get the solutions \\( z \\).\n\nAlright, so first step: find the fourth roots"

The complex number \\( 1 + i \\) has a magnitude of \\( \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\) and an argument (angle) of \\( 45^\\circ \\) or \\( \\pi/4 \\) radians because it lies on the line y = x in the first quadrant.\n\nSo, \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) \\).\n\nTo find the fourth roots, we take the fourth root of the magnitude and divide the angle by 4.

Now, remember we have to subtract \\( i \\) from each of these roots because our original equation was \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\), so \\( z = -i \\times \\) [fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\) ].\n\nWait, no: correcting myself. Actually, \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\), so the solutions are \\( z + i = \\) [fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\) ], so \\( z = -i \\times \\) [fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\) ].\n\nSo, it's each root of \\( 1 + i \\)'s fourth roots multiplied by \\( -i \\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite correct. Let me think.\n\nIf \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\), then \\( z + i = \\) each fourth root of \\( 1 + i \\). So \\( z = -i + \\) each fourth root of \\( 1 + i \\).\n\nThus, to find z, we take each fourth root of \\( 1 + i \\) and subtract \\( i \\).\n\nSo, let me denote each fourth root as \\( w_k \\), so \\( z = w_k - i \\).\n\nSo, each solution z is a point in the complex plane obtained by taking each fourth root of \\( 1 + i \\), moving them down by \\( i \\).\n\nAlternatively, it's a shift, but perhaps it's better to express \\( w_k - i \\) in terms of their polar forms.\n\nSo, if \\( w_k = 2^{1/8} e^{i (\\pi/16 + \\pi k/2)} \\), then \\( z = w_k - i = 2^{1/8} e^{i (\\pi/16 + \\pi k/2)}"

Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the polygon formed by the roots is a square, since the roots of a complex number are equally spaced on a circle, so when shifted by a constant, they might form a square or another regular polygon.\n\nWait, but shifting all roots by the same complex number (in this case, subtracting \\( i \\)) would translate the polygon in the complex plane, but the shape and area remain the same. So the area of the polygon formed by the roots of the original equation is the same as the area formed by the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), just shifted down by \\( i \\). Since translation doesn't affect area, I can compute the area of the polygon formed by the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), and that will be the same as the desired area.\n\nTherefore, maybe I can compute the area of the polygon formed by the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), which are equally spaced on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), with angles separated by \\( \\pi/2 \\), since they are fourth roots. Wait, but the angles were calculated as \\( \\pi/16 + \\pi k/2 \\), so the angle between consecutive roots is \\( \\pi/2 \\), so they are spaced every 90 degrees, so they form a square?\n\nWait, but the starting angle is \\( \\pi/16 \\), so the roots are not aligned with the axes, but they are still spaced at 90-degree intervals. So, the four roots lie on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), separated by 90 degrees, so they form a square rotated by \\( \\pi/16 \\) radians (about 11.25 degrees) from the standard position. However, the area of a square is determined by the distance between its vertices, so even if it's rotated, the area remains the same as if it were axis-aligned, as long as the side lengths are the same.\n\nAlternatively, the area of a square with side length \\( s \\) is \\( s^2 \\), but here the square is inscribed in a circle of radius \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\).

So \\( s = d / \\sqrt{2} = (2 r) / \\sqrt{2} = r \\sqrt{2} \\). Therefore, the area is \\( s^2 = (r \\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 r^2 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\), so:\n\nArea = \\( 2 \\times (2^{1/8})^2 = 2 \\times 2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nHmm, so area is \\( 2^{5/4} \\). Express this as \\( p^{a/b} \\). Well, \\( 2 \\) is prime, and \\( 5/4 \\) is already in simplest terms. So \\( p = 2 \\), \\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 4 \\). Then \\( a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second, is the polygon really a square? Because when I take the fourth roots, they’re spaced at 90-degree intervals along the circle, so their convex hull is indeed a square, regardless of the starting angle. So the area should be the same as that of a square inscribed in the circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check whether the roots are actually forming a square or if the polygon is something else. Let me consider the roots as points on a circle of radius \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\) at angles \\( \\pi/16, 9\\pi/16, 17\\pi/16, 25\\pi/16 \\).\n\nIf I plot these points, they are each 90 degrees apart, but starting from \\( \\pi/16 \\) instead of 0. So the polygon formed is a regular quadrilateral, which is a square, just rotated.\n\nBut the area of a regular quadrilateral (square) inscribed in a circle of radius \\("
