            "output": "First, I need to subtract 0.7 repeating by 0.4 repeating. To make this easier, I'll convert each repeating decimal into a fraction.\n\n0.7 repeating can be expressed as 7/9, and 0.4 repeating is 4/9. Subtracting these gives 7/9 - 4/9, which equals 3/9 or 1/3.\n\nNext, I add 0.2 repeating to 1/3. Converting 0.2 repeating to a fraction gives 2/9. So now, I need to add 2/9 to 1/3, which is the same as 3/9.\n\nFinally, adding these together, 3/9 plus 2/9 equals 5/9. Therefore, the final answer is 5/9.\n</think>\n\nLet's compute the expression step by step.\n\n**Step 1:** Subtract the repeating decimals.\n\\[\n0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} = \\frac{7}{9} - \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Add \\( 0.\\overline{2} \\) to the result.\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} + 0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{9}}\n\\]"
