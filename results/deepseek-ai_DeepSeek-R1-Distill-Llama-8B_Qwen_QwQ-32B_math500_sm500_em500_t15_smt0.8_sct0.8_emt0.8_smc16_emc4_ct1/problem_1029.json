Then, I need to compute the sum of \\( p_i(1) \\) for each polynomial \\( p_i \\). \n\nFirst, I should probably try to factor the given polynomial. It's an eighth-degree polynomial, so factoring it into lower-degree polynomials makes sense. Since it's monic, each factor will also be monic, which might help.\n\nLet me write down the polynomial again: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Hmm, it looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Let me check: if I substitute \\( y = x^4 \\), then the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). That's a quadratic equation, which I can try to factor.\n\nSo, let's factor \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, it factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), we get \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nNow, we have \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). Next step is to factor each of these quartic polynomials further.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\). That's a difference of squares because \\( x^4 = (x^2)^2 \\) and 1 is \\( 1^2 \\). So, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Each of these can be factored further:\n\n- \\( x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) \\)\n- \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible over the integers because it has no real roots and can't be factored into polynomials"

Hmm, \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is a sum of squares. Wait, I remember that sometimes these can be factored using the sum of squares formula. But in general, over integers, \\( a^2 + b^2 \\) doesn't factor, but for specific cases, like \\( a^4 + 4b^4 \\), we can use something called the Sophie Germain identity.\n\nThe Sophie Germain identity says that \\( a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) \\). Let me check if this applies here. Our polynomial is \\( x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4*1^4 \\). So, yes, \\( a = x \\) and \\( b = 1 \\). So, applying the identity:\n\n\\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nSo, that's two factors: \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\) and \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\). I need to check if these are irreducible over the integers.\n\nLooking at \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\), the discriminant is \\( (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\), which is negative, so it has no real roots, so it's irreducible over the integers.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\), the discriminant is \\( (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\), so it's also irreducible over the integers. So, that's two more factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x"

Let me recount: original factors are (x-1), (x+1), (x^2+1), (x^2+2x+2), (x^2-2x+2). That's five factors, correct.\n\nSo, each of these is monic, irreducible over integers, so the factorization is complete. Therefore, the sum is 10.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me just make sure that the initial polynomial factors correctly.\n\nSo, \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 -1) = x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\). Let me multiply out the factors to confirm.\n\nFirst, \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 -1) = x^8 -x^4 +4x^4 -4 = x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the factorization is correct. Therefore, the sum is indeed 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{10}\n</think>\n\nTo factor the polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) into monic polynomials with integer coefficients, we start by treating it as a quadratic in \\( x^4 \\). Substituting \\( y = x^4 \\), we get the quadratic \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\), which factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\]\n\nNext, we factor each quartic polynomial further. The polynomial \\( x^4 - 1 \\) is a difference of squares:\n\n\\[ x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\]\n\nFurther factoring \\( x^2 - 1"
