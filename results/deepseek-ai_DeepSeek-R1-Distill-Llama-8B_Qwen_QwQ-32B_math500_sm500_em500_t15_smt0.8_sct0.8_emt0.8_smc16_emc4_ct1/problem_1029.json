Then, I need to compute the sum of each of these factors evaluated at \\(x = 1\\).\n\nFirst, let me write down the given polynomial: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). It looks like a degree 8 polynomial. The task is to factor it into monic polynomials with integer coefficients, which is essentially factoring it into irreducible polynomials over the integers.\n\nI know that for polynomials with symmetric forms, sometimes substituting \\(y = x^4\\) can help reduce the degree. Let me try that.\n\nLet \\(y = x^4\\). Then, the polynomial becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). Hmm, maybe I can factor this quadratic in \\(y\\).\n\nTrying to factor \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\): I look for two numbers that multiply to \\(-4\\) and add up to \\(3\\). Those numbers would be \\(4\\) and \\(-1\\). So, the quadratic factors as \\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\).\n\nSubstituting back \\(y = x^4\\), it becomes \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). Now, each of these factors can potentially be factored further.\n\nLooking at \\(x^4 - 1\\), that's a difference of squares because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\). So, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). And \\(x^2 - 1\\) can be factored further into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\).\n\nSo now, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\\[\n(x^4 + 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^4 + 4)\n\\]\nFurther factoring \\((x^2 - 1)\\) and \\((x^2 + 1)\\):\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^"

I recall that \\(x^4 + 4\\) is a biquadratic and can be factored using the Sophie Germain identity. The identity states that \\(x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2)\\). Here, if I let \\(y = 1\\), then \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Let me verify that:\n\nMultiplying \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)\\) and \\((x^2 - 2x + 2)\\):\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 4\n\\]\nSimplify term by term:\n- \\(x^4\\)\n- \\(-2x^3 + 2x^3 = 0\\)\n- \\(2x^2 - 4x^2 + 2x^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(4x - 4x = 0\\)\n- \\(+4\\)\n\nSo, yes, it simplifies back to \\(x^4 + 4\\). Great, so \\(x^4 + 4\\) factors into those two quadratics. Therefore, the complete factorization over integers is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to compute the sum \\(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1)\\). Each \\(p_i(x)\\) is one of these factors, all monic, irreducible over integers, and each is monic.\n\nLet me evaluate each polynomial at \\(x = 1\\):\n\n1. \\(p_"
