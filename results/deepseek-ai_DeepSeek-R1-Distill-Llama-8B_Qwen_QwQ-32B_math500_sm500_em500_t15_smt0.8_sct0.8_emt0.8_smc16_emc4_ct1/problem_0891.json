Since all the prime factors in the denominator are 2 and 5, the decimal representation will terminate.\n\nNext, I'll perform the division of 57 by 160. Dividing 57 by 160 gives 0.35625. To ensure the result is accurate, I'll multiply 0.35625 by 160 and check that it equals 57, confirming that the conversion is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Denominator\nFirst, factorize the denominator to determine if it has only the prime factors 2 and/or 5. This is necessary because a fraction will have a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5 after simplifying.\n\n- **Denominator:** \\(160\\)\n\n- **Prime Factorization:**\n  \\[\n  160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^4 \\times (2 \\times 5) = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n  \\]\n  \n  Since the denominator \\(160\\) can be expressed as \\(2^5 \\times 5^1\\), which only contains the primes 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Division\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator to find the decimal equivalent.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Result\nTo ensure the conversion is accurate, multiply the decimal by the denominator and confirm it equals the numerator:\n\n\\[\n0.35625 \\times 160 = 57\n\\]\n\nSince the multiplication yields the original numerator, the conversion is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
