            "output": "First, I recognize that the fraction \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) can be simplified or converted into a decimal. To do this, I will perform the long division of 31 by 11111.\n\nNext, I'll carry out the division step by step. Since 11111 is a prime number, the decimal representation of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) will be a repeating decimal. I'll write down each digit of the quotient as it appears during the division process.\n\nAfter completing the division, I'll identify the repeating part of the decimal. By observing the quotient from the division, I'll determine how many digits repeat continuously.\n\nFinally, I'll count the number of repeating digits and provide that as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal representation of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111}\n   \\]\n   Here, 31 is the numerator, and 11111 is the denominator.\n\n2. **Perform the Division:**\n   Divide 31 by 11111 manually or through long division.\n\n   Since 11111 is a prime number and greater than 31, the decimal will not terminate. Instead, it will repeat indefinitely.\n\n3. **Identify the Repeating Sequence:**\n   Perform the division step by step:\n   \\[\n   11111 \\div 31 \\approx 3.572...\n   \\]\n   However, to find the exact repeating pattern, let's consider the decimal expansion.\n\n4. **Decimal Expansion:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111} \\approx 0.0028002750225...\n   \\]\n   Here, the repeating part is \"275.\"\n\n5. **Determine the Number of Repeating Digits:**\n   In the repeating sequence \"275,\" there are **3** digits that repeat.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"
