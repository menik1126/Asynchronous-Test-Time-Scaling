            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, let me write that down to make sure I have it right. The equation is:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, so the goal is to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. Since there's a square root involved, I think I'll have to square both sides at some point to eliminate the radical. But before I do that, maybe I should isolate the square root term or something. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I should check the domain of the equation because the expression under the square root can't be negative. So, 11 - 2x has to be greater than or equal to zero. Let me write that down:\n\n11 - 2x ≥ 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n-2x ≥ -11  \nDividing both sides by -2 (and remembering to flip the inequality sign):\n\nx ≤ 11/2  \nWhich is x ≤ 5.5\n\nSo, whatever solution I get, it has to be less than or equal to 5.5. That might help later when I check my answers.\n\nNow, going back to the original equation:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nI think I should try to get rid of the square root. Maybe I can subtract 4 from both sides so that the square root is by itself on one side. Let's try that:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nOkay, now the square root is isolated. Good. Now, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. So, let me do that:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16  \nRight side: 11 - 2x\n\nSo, now I have:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nLet me bring all the terms to the left side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0  \nSimplify the terms:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = "

Wait, 5 is a prime number, so the factors are 1 and 5. Since the middle term is -6x, both factors should be negative because they add up to -6 and multiply to +5. So:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5  \nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nAlright, so I have two potential solutions: x = 1 and x = 5. But wait, earlier I found that x has to be less than or equal to 5.5. Both 1 and 5 are less than 5.5, so that's good. But I need to make sure these solutions actually satisfy the original equation. Sometimes when you square both sides of an equation, you can introduce extraneous solutions, so it's important to check them.\n\nLet me start with x = 1:\n\nLeft side: x = 1  \nRight side: √(11 - 2*1) + 4 = √(11 - 2) + 4 = √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, 1 ≠ 7. Hmm, that doesn't work. So, x = 1 is an extraneous solution. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. So, I had:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)  \nSquared both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x  \nExpanded: x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x  \nBrought all terms to the left: x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0  \nFactored: (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0  \nSolutions: x = 5 and x = 1.\n\nPlugging x = 5 into the original equation:\n\nx = 5  \nRight side: √(11 - 2*5) + 4 = √(11 - 10) + 4 = √"

Now, x = 1:\n\nx = 1  \nRight side: √(11 - 2*1) + 4 = √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7  \nBut 1 ≠ 7, so x = 1 is not a solution.\n\nWait, so why did squaring give me x = 1 as a solution? Let me think. When we square both sides of the equation x - 4 = √(11 - 2x), squaring can sometimes introduce solutions that don't satisfy the original equation because squaring is not a reversible operation—it can create both true and false solutions.\n\nSo, since x = 1 didn't work when I plugged it back in, it's an extraneous solution. Therefore, the only valid solution is x = 5.\n\nHmm, just to make sure I didn't make any other mistakes, let me go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4  \nSubtract 4: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x)  \nSquare both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x  \nExpand: x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x  \nBring all terms to left: x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0  \nFactor: (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0  \nSolutions: x = 5 and x = 1.\n\nChecked x = 5: works.  \nChecked x = 1: doesn't work.  \nSo, only x = 5 is the solution.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered the domain, isolated the square root, squared both sides, solved the quadratic, and checked both solutions. So, the conclusion is that x = 5 is the only valid solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), we first consider the domain, which requires \\( 11 - 2x \\geq 0 \\), giving \\( x \\leq 5.5 \\). Next, we isolate the square root by subtracting 4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx - 4 = \\sqrt{"
