            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\]\n\nAnd it's mentioned that this holds true for all real values of x except -8 and 3. Hmm, okay. I remember that when dealing with equations like this, especially with fractions, it might involve partial fractions. Partial fractions is a method where you express a complicated rational expression as a sum of simpler ones. That seems to fit here because the left side is a sum of two fractions, and the right side is a single fraction.\n\nFirst, I should probably factor the denominator on the right side to make sure it's in its simplest form. Let me factor \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). To factor this quadratic, I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let's see, 8 and -3 multiply to -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, the denominator factors as:\n\n\\(x^2 + 5x - 24 = (x + 8)(x - 3)\\)\n\nWait, but that would make the denominator (x + 8)(x - 3), which are the same as the denominators on the left side. Interesting. So, both sides have the same denominator. That makes sense why the equation holds for all x except -8 and 3 because those would make the denominators zero.\n\nOkay, so if both sides have the same denominator, I can combine the fractions on the left side to have a common denominator and then set the numerators equal to each other. Let me try that.\n\nThe left side is:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8}\\]\n\nTo combine these, the common denominator would be (x - 3)(x + 8). So, I'll rewrite each fraction with this common denominator:\n\n\\[\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)("

That means the coefficients of like terms should be equal on both sides. Let me expand the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) = Cx + 8C\n\nD(x - 3) = Dx - 3D\n\nSo, combining them:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = (C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nNow, set this equal to the right side numerator:\n\n4x - 23\n\nSo, equating the coefficients:\n\nFor the x term:\nC + D = 4\n\nFor the constant term:\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. C + D = 4\n2. 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve this system for C and D. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nFrom equation 1, I can express D as D = 4 - C.\n\nThen substitute D into equation 2:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n8C - 3*(4 - C) = -23\n\nFirst, compute the multiplication:\n\n8C - (12 - 3C) = -23\n\nThen distribute the negative sign:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8C + 3C) + (-12) = -23\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow that I have C = -1, I can substitute back into equation 1 to find D:\n\n-1 + D = 4\n\nSo, D = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nTherefore, C = -1 and D = 5.\n\nThe question asks for the product CD. So, multiplying them:\n\nCD = (-1"
