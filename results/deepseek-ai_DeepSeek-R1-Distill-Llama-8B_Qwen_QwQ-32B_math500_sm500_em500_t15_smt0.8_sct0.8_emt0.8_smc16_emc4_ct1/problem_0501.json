            "output": "First, I need to figure out how many students take physics. Let's break down the information step by step.\n\nThere are 360 students in total. Out of these, 15 don't take any of calculus, physics, or chemistry. That means 360 minus 15 equals 345 students are taking at least one of the three subjects.\n\nNext, I know that 15 students take all three subjects: calculus, physics, and chemistry. So, 345 minus 15 equals 330 students take at least two of the subjects.\n\nNow, I'll consider the students taking both calculus and chemistry. It's given that 75 students take both calculus and chemistry.\n\nSimilarly, 75 students take both physics and chemistry.\n\nAdditionally, 30 students take both physics and calculus.\n\nSince 75 students take both physics and chemistry and 30 take both physics and calculus, the number of students taking both physics and chemistry only would be 75 minus 30, which equals 45.\n\nNow, I can determine the number of students taking only physics and chemistry by subtracting the overlap from the total: 75 minus 45 equals 30.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the students taking only calculus and physics: 30 minus 30 equals 0.\n\nThen, the students taking only calculus and chemistry: 75 minus 0 equals 75.\n\nNow, I can find the students taking only physics by subtracting those taking only physics and chemistry, only calculus and physics, and the overlap from the total physics students. However, since there are no students taking only calculus and physics, the calculation simplifies.\n\nFinally, adding up all the categories should total 345 students, which helps in verifying the numbers. Solving these equations will give me the exact number of students taking physics.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Total Number of Students**\n\n- Total students: 360\n- Students not taking any of the three subjects (Calculus, Physics, Chemistry): 15\n- So, students taking at least one subject: \\( 360 - 15 = 345 \\)\n\n**Step 2: Students Taking All Three Subjects**\n\n- Students taking Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry: 15\n\n**Step 3: Students Taking Two Subjects**\n\n- Students taking Calculus and Chemistry: 75\n- Students taking Physics and Chemistry: 75\n- Students taking Physics and Calculus: 30\n\n**Step 4"
