            "output": "First, I'll identify the key information from the problem. The robot's speed is constant, and it travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. This allows me to calculate the robot's speed.\n\nNext, I'll convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second, as the hallway length is requested in meters and the time taken is in seconds.\n\nAfter determining the speed, I'll use the formula speed equals distance divided by time to find the length of the hallway.\n\nFinally, I'll substitute the known values into the formula and perform the calculations to find the hallway's length in meters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of the hallway, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Robot's Speed**\n\n   The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. \n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1\\ \\text{kilometer}}{2.5\\ \\text{hours}} = 0.4\\ \\text{kilometers per hour (km/h)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert Speed to Meters per Second**\n\n   Since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds:\n   \n   \\[\n   0.4\\ \\text{km/h} = 0.4 \\times 1000\\ \\text{meters} / 3600\\ \\text{seconds} = 0.1111\\ \\text{m/s}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Length of the Hallway**\n\n   The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway length at the calculated speed:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 0.1111\\ \\text{m/s} \\times 90\\ \\text{seconds} = 10\\ \\text{meters}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10\\ \\text{meters}}\n\\]"
