The sequence is (a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ), and I'm given three sums: the sum of the numbers, the sum of their squares, and the sum of their cubes. The sums are 96, 144, and 216 respectively. I need to find the sum of all possible values of n.\n\nHmm, let me think about what I know. When dealing with sequences and sums of powers, sometimes it helps to think about moments or use inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder's inequality. But I'm not sure yet which approach is right.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I have:\n\n1. Sum of a_i: S₁ = 96\n2. Sum of a_i²: S₂ = 144\n3. Sum of a_i³: S₃ = 216\n\nI remember that for sequences of numbers, especially when dealing with sums of powers, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality might come into play. Also, maybe I can use the power mean inequality, which relates the different means of a set of numbers.\n\nThe Power Mean Inequality states that for positive real numbers and for exponents r < s, the r-th power mean is less than or equal to the s-th power mean. The inequality is given by:\n\n(M_r) ≤ (M_s)\n\nWhere M_r = ( (S_r)/n )^(1/r) and similarly for M_s.\n\nIn this case, let's compute the first few power means.\n\nFirst, compute the arithmetic mean, which is M₁:\n\nM₁ = S₁ / n = 96 / n\n\nNext, the quadratic mean, M₂:\n\nM₂ = (S₂ / n)^(1/2) = (144 / n)^(1/2)\n\nSimilarly, the cubic mean, M₃:\n\nM₃ = (S₃ / n)^(1/3) = (216 / n)^(1/3)\n\nAccording to the Power Mean Inequality, M₁ ≤ M₂ ≤ M₃. So:\n\n96/n ≤ sqrt(144/n) ≤ (216/n)^(1/3)\n\nLet me write that down without the division by n for simplicity:\n\n96 ≤ sqrt(144 * n) ≤ (216 n)^(1/3)\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should handle each inequality separately.\n\nFirst inequality"

That's interesting. So the lower bound is 64. But the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n\". So maybe n can be 64 or higher? But there must be an upper bound as well?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider equality conditions here. Because the Power Mean inequalities become equalities when all the terms are equal. So if all a_i are equal, then equality holds. Let me check that.\n\nSuppose all a_i are equal. Let each a_i = a. Then:\n\nSum a_i = n a = 96 ⇒ a = 96/n\n\nSum a_i² = n a² = 14"

So, yes, n = 64.\n\nWait, so in the case when all a_i are equal, n is 64. So equality holds when n=64.\n\nBut earlier, I had from Power Mean inequalities that n must be at least 64. So if n=64, equality holds, which is allowed. But what if n > 64? Does that still satisfy the inequalities?\n\nWait, the Power Mean inequalities tell us that for any positive real numbers, n must be ≥ 64. So if n=64, it can satisfy the given sums with all a_i equal. But can n be greater than 64?\n\nWait, let me think about it. If I have a larger n, but keeping the sum, sum of squares, and sum of cubes the same, then the numbers can't all be equal anymore, but perhaps some are larger and some are smaller. Hmm, but does that even work?\n\nWait, if n increases beyond 64, the individual a_i's would have to adjust to keep the same sum, same sum of squares, and same sum of cubes. It seems that n=64 is the only possible value. Because if you have more numbers, you have to distribute the sum, sum of squares, and sum of cubes among more variables, but it's constrained by the given totals. Maybe n is uniquely determined as 64.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n.\" So if n can only be 64, then the sum is 64.\n\nBut let me verify this more carefully.\n\nSuppose n is greater than 64. Let me try to see if it's possible.\n\nSuppose n=65.

Since the equations are given, maybe the only solution is when all a_i are equal, so n must be 64. But maybe there are other solutions with different n?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are two possible values of n? The problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n,\" so maybe there are two?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the case where some of the a_i are zero?

So all a_i must be positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where some of the a_i are equal to 1, and others are different?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to find the minimal n?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of variance. Let me compute the variance of the sequence.\n\nThe variance is given by (S₂/n - (S₁/n)^2). Let me compute that:\n\nVariance = (144/n - (96/n)^2 )\n\nBut variance must be non-negative, so:\n\n144/n - (96/n)^2 ≥ 0\n\nMultiply both sides by n² (since n is positive):\n\n144 n - 96² ≥ 0 ⇒ 144n ≥ 9216 ⇒ n ≥ 64.\n\nSo that's the same as before. So the variance is non-negative, so n must be at least 64. So n can't be less than 64. So the minimal n is 64. But can n be greater?\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me suppose that n is 64. Then, as we saw, all a_i must be equal to 96/64 = 1.5. Then, the sum of squares would be 64*(1.5)^2 = 64*(2.25) = 144, which matches. The sum of cubes would be 64*(3.375) = 216, which also matches.

So, perhaps this approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe having more than one different term? Maybe two different numbers? But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n=64 is the only possible value, as it's the minimal, and higher n is not possible because it's constrained by the sums.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n is uniquely determined by the equality case, so n=64.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I tried n=65, it gave a sum of cubes less than 216, but actually, the moment they ask for is sum=216, so if it's less than, that doesn't satisfy the condition. Hmm, maybe I have to have n=64 because for higher n, the sum of cubes would be too low? Wait, but that seems counterintuitive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a constrained optimization problem: with fixed sum, sum of squares, and sum of cubes, what is the possible n?\n\nBut in that case, perhaps the only possible n is 64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the sum of cubes.\n\nAlternatively, think about the Newton identities, connecting the power sums to the elementary symmetric sums. But that might get complicated, especially without knowing the specific values.\n\nWait, another thought. The sums S₁, S₂, S₃ can be considered as the first three power sums. In the case of variables being equal, we have the minimal case for the variance. If n increases, keeping the power sums fixed, it's possible that the variance increases, but the power sums remain same.\n\nWait, but since we have all three power sums given, it might be that only a specific n is possible. So when n=64, all a_i=1.5, giving S₁=96, S₂=144, S₃=216.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if n is larger, the variables can't all be equal and still satisfy the higher power sum. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps consider that for the sum of cubes, if n increases, but the sum of cubes remains the same, the individual variables would have to be larger or smaller depending on the distribution. But perhaps in this case, it's constrained.\n\nWait, another approach: let me use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let me consider"
