            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve: If log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then I need to find x. Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down both equations so I can see them clearly.\n\n1. log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2\n2. log_y(5x) = 2\n\nAlright, starting with the first equation. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product. So, log₆(a) + log₆(b) = log₆(ab). Applying that here, I get:\n\nlog₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\nSimplify the expression inside the log. Notice that (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, which equals x² - y². So now, the equation becomes:\n\nlog₆(x² - y²) = 2\n\nTo get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that if log_b(c) = d, then c = b^d. Applying that here, base 6 raised to the power of 2 equals x² - y².\n\nSo, 6² = x² - y²\nThat's 36 = x² - y²\n\nI'll note that down as equation (1a):\nx² - y² = 36\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2\n\nAgain, I can rewrite this in exponential form. log_y(a) = b means that y^b = a. So, y² = 5x.\n\nSo, equation (2a):\ny² = 5x\n\nNow, I have two equations: x² - y² = 36 and y² = 5x. My goal is to find x, so let's substitute y² from equation (2a) into equation (1a).\n\nFrom equation (2a): y² = 5x\n\nPlugging this into equation (1a):\nx² - (5x) = 36\n\nSo, x²"

            "output": " - 5x - 36 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let me write it down:\n\nx² - 5x - 36 = 0\n\nTo solve this quadratic, I can try factoring. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Let's see:\n\nFactors of 36:\n1 and 36\n2 and 18\n3 and 12\n4 and 9\n6 and 6\n\nLooking for a pair that adds up to -5. Let's try 3 and -12: 3 * (-12) = -36, and 3 + (-12) = -9. Not quite. How about 4 and -9: 4 * (-9) = -36, and 4 + (-9) = -5. Yes, that's the pair!\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as:\n(x + 4)(x - 9) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\nx + 4 = 0 => x = -4\nx - 9 = 0 => x = 9\n\nSo, x could be -4 or 9. But wait, we have logarithms in the original problem, so we need to make sure that the arguments of the logarithms are positive.\n\nLooking back at the first equation: log₆(x - y) and log₆(x + y). So, both (x - y) and (x + y) must be positive.\n\nFrom equation (2a): y² = 5x. Since y² is always non-negative, 5x must be non-negative. Therefore, x ≥ 0.\n\nSo, x cannot be negative. That means x = -4 is not a valid solution because it's negative. So, we discard x = -4.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is x = 9.\n\nJust to double-check, let's find the corresponding y for x = 9.\n\nFrom equation (2a): y² = 5x = 5*9 = 45\nSo, y² = 45 => y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45)\nSimplify sqrt(45): sqrt(9*5) = 3*sqrt(5) ≈ 6.708\n\nBut we need to verify that both (x - y) and (x + y) are positive"

Thus, x = 9 is indeed a valid solution.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure that both values of y satisfy the original logarithmic equation.\n\nWe already used the first equation to get to x² - y² = 36, and from there, we found x. So, as long as y² = 5x and (x - y)(x + y) = 36, the logarithmic expressions are defined. Since we've verified that for x = 9, both (x - y) and (x + y) are positive, regardless of y being positive or negative, so it's okay.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is x = 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given logarithmic equations. \n\n1. **First Equation:**  \n   \\(\\log_6(x - y) + \\log_6(x + y) = 2\\)  \n   Using the logarithm property, this becomes:  \n   \\(\\log_6[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\\)  \n   Simplifying the argument:  \n   \\(\\log_6(x^2 - y^2) = 2\\)  \n   Converting to exponential form:  \n   \\(x^2 - y^2 = 6^2 = 36\\)  \n\n2. **Second Equation:**  \n   \\(\\log_y(5x) = 2\\)  \n   Converting to exponential form:  \n   \\(y^2 = 5x\\)  \n\n3. **Substitute \\(y^2\\) from the second equation into the first equation:**  \n   \\(x^2 - 5x = 36\\)  \n  "
