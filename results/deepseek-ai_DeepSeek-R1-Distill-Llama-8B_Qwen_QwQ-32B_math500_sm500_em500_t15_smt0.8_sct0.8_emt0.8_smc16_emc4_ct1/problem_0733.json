            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: \n\nIf log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then find x.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem involves logarithms with different bases. I remember some logarithm rules, but I might need to recall them carefully.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2.\n\nI think when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So, log\u2086(A) + log\u2086(B) = log\u2086(A * B). Applying that here:\n\nlog\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nWait, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, so that simplifies to x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. So the equation becomes:\n\nlog\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2.\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that if log_b(C) = D, then b^D = C.\n\nSo, 6^2 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\nCalculating 6 squared, that's 36.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nI'll note that as equation (1): x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2.\n\nAgain, I can convert this logarithmic equation to exponential form. So, y^2 = 5x.\n\nThat gives me y\u00b2 = 5x, which is equation (2): y\u00b2 = 5x.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36\n2. y\u00b2 = 5x\n\nI can substitute equation (2) into equation (1). Since y\u00b2 = 5x, then x\u00b2 - 5x = 36.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let me try to solve for x.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula: x = [5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 + 144)] / 2.\n\nWait,"

            "output": " where did I get the 144 from? Because the quadratic is x\u00b2 -5x -36, so a=1, b=-5, c=-36.\n\nSo discriminant D = (-5)^2 - 4*1*(-36) = 25 + 144 = 169.\n\nSo sqrt(169) is 13.\n\nThus, x = [5 \u00b113]/2.\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\nx = (5 +13)/2 = 18/2 = 9,\n\nor x = (5 -13)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4.\n\nNow, I should check if these solutions make sense in the original logarithmic equations because logarithms have domain restrictions.\n\nLooking back at the first equation: log\u2086(x - y) and log\u2086(x + y).\n\nFor these logarithms to be defined, the arguments must be positive.\n\nSo, x - y > 0 and x + y > 0.\n\nAlso, in the second equation, log_y(5x) must be defined, so y must be positive and not equal to 1, and 5x must be positive.\n\nAdditionally, since y is in the base of a logarithm, it must satisfy y > 0 and y \u2260 1.\n\nLet me analyze each possible value of x.\n\nFirst, x = 9.\n\nFrom equation (2): y\u00b2 = 5x = 5*9 = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45).\n\nBut since y must be positive (as it's a logarithm base), y = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, checking x - y and x + y:\n\nx - y = 9 - 3\u221a5 \u2248 9 - 6.708 \u2248 2.292 > 0.\n\nx + y = 9 + 3\u221a5 \u2248 15.708 > 0.\n\nSo both are positive, which is good.\n\nThus, x=9 seems valid.\n\nNow, x = -4.\n\nAgain, from equation (2): y\u00b2 = 5*(-4) = -20.\n\nBut y\u00b2 can't be negative, so this is impossible. So x=-4 is invalid.\n\nSo the only solution is x=9.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check using both equations.\n\nUsing x=9:\n\nFrom equation (2), y\u00b2 = 45, so"
