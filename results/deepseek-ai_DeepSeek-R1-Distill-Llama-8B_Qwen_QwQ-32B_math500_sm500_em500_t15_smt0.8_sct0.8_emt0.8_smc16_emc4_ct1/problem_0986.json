This step ensures that the denominator becomes a real number, making the calculation easier.\n\nThen, I'll carry out the multiplication for both the numerator and the denominator. After expanding, I'll simplify the expressions by combining like terms.\n\nOnce the numerator and the denominator are simplified, I'll separate the real and imaginary parts of the result to present the final answer in the standard form of a complex number.\n\nFinally, I'll compare William's incorrect result with the correct one to identify the error and provide the accurate answer he should have obtained.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the correct result of the calculation \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\), let's follow the proper steps for dividing complex numbers.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Complex Numbers**\nWe have:\n- **Numerator:** \\(-3 + 4i\\)\n- **Denominator:** \\(1 + 2i\\)\n\n**Step 2: Multiply Numerator and Denominator by the Complex Conjugate of the Denominator**\nThe complex conjugate of \\(1 + 2i\\) is \\(1 - 2i\\).
