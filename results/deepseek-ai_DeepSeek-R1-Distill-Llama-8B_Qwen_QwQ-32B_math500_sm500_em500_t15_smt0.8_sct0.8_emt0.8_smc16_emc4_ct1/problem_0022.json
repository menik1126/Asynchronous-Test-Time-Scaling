To simplify this, I'll convert it into polar form by finding its modulus and argument.\\n\\nThe modulus of (1 - i) is \u221a(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = \u221a2. The argument is -45 degrees or 315 degrees, which is \u03b8 = -\u03c0/4 radians. Using De Moivre's Theorem, raising a complex number to the 8th power means raising its modulus to the 8th power and multiplying its argument by 8.\\n\\nSo, (\u221a2)^8 = (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16. Multiplying the argument by 8 gives 8 * (-\u03c0/4) = -2\u03c0, which is equivalent to 0 radians in terms of modulus since e^(-i2\u03c0) = cos(0) + i sin(0) = 1.\\n\\nTherefore, |(1 - i)^8| = 16.\n</think>\n\nTo determine \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Number**:\n   - The expression \\(1 - i\\) represents a complex number where:\n     - Real part = 1\n     - Imaginary part = -1\n\n2. **Convert to Polar Form**:\n   - **Modulus (r)**:\n     \\[\n     r = \\sqrt{(1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n   - **Argument (\u03b8)**:\n     \\[\n     \u03b8 = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-1}{1}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians or } 315^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n3. **Apply De Moivre's Theorem**:\n   - De Moivre's Theorem states that for any complex number \\(r(\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta)\\):\n     \\[\n     [r(\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta)]^n = r^n \\left( \\cos(n\\theta) + i \\sin(n\\theta) \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(n = 8\\), \\(r = \\sqrt{2"
