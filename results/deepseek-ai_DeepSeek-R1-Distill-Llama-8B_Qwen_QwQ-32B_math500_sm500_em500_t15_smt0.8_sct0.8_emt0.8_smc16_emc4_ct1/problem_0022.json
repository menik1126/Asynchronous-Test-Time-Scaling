To calculate the modulus, it's easier to work with the complex conjugate.\n\nBy finding the complex conjugate of \\( (1 - i) \\), which is \\( (1 + i) \\), I can use the formula for the modulus of a complex number:\n\\[\n|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\nApplying this formula to both \\( (1 - i) \\) and its conjugate \\( (1 + i) \\), I get:\n\\[\n|1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n|1 + i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSince the modulus of a complex number raised to a power is the modulus raised to that power, I can simplify:\n\\[\n|1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 \\):\n\\[\n(\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{(1/2) \\times 8} = 2^4 = 16\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Modulus of a Complex Number**:\n   \n   For any complex number \\(a + bi\\), the modulus is given by:\n   \\[\n   |a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n   Similarly, the modulus of a number and its complex conjugate are equal.\n\n2. **Calculate the Modulus of \\(1 - i\\)**:\n   \n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Raise the Modulus to the 8th Power**:\n   \n   Since the modulus of a complex number raised to a power is the modulus raised to that power:\n   \\[\n   |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Simplify the Expression**"
