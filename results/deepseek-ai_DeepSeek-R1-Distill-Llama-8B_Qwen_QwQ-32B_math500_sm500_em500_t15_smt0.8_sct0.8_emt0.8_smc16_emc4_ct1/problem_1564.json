Each side will have 2 people seated.\n\nI'll start by calculating the number of ways to arrange the 8 people in a line. This can be done in 8! ways.\n\nNext, I need to consider the circular arrangement around the table. In circular permutations, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! because one person's position can be fixed to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique seating arrangements around the table is (8-1)! = 7!.\n\nHowever, since the table is square, there's an additional rotational symmetry. The table can be rotated by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees, each of which may create equivalent configurations.\n\nTo account for this, I should divide the total number of arrangements by 4 (the number of possible rotational symmetries).\n\nSo, the final number of unique seating arrangements is 7! / 4.\n\nCalculating this gives 5040 / 4 = 1260.\n\nTherefore, there are 1260 unique ways to seat 8 people around the square table with 2 people on each side.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Linear Arrangement**: First, consider arranging the 8 people in a straight line. This can be done in \\(8!\\) ways.\n\n2. **Circular Arrangement**: Since the table is circular, we need to account for rotational symmetry. In circular permutations, the number of arrangements is \\((n-1)!\\) because one position can be fixed to eliminate rotations that would otherwise count as distinct arrangements. Here, \\(n = 8\\), so the number of circular arrangements is \\(7!\\).\n\n3. **Square Symmetry**: The table is square, which adds an additional layer of symmetry. A square can be rotated by \\(90^\\circ\\), \\(180^\\circ\\), or \\(270^\\circ\\), each creating equivalent configurations. Therefore, we divide the number of circular arrangements by 4 to account for these symmetries.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: Combining the above steps, the number of unique seating arrangements is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\"
