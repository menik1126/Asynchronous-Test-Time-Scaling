This accounts for the circular nature of the table where rotations are considered the same.\n\nNext, since the table is square, there are only 4 distinct rotational positions due to the four sides. Therefore, each unique seating arrangement can be rotated into 4 different configurations.\n\nFinally, to find the number of distinct seating arrangements, I'll divide the total number of arrangements by the number of rotational symmetries: 5040 / 4 = 1260 ways.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways 8 people can be seated around a square table with 2 people on each side, we need to account for the rotational symmetries of the table.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table.**\n\nFor a circular arrangement, the number of distinct ways to arrange \\( n \\) people is \\( (n-1)! \\). Therefore, for 8 people:\n\n\\[\n(8-1)! = 7! = 5040\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Consider the rotational symmetries of the square table.**\n\nA square table has 4 sides, and any seating arrangement can be rotated into 4 equivalent configurations (one for each side). Thus, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of rotational symmetries to account for these redundancies.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5040}{4} = 1260\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1260}\n\\]"
