The solutions to this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon. The area can be expressed in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are relatively prime, and \\( p \\) is a prime number. Then, I have to compute \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what kind of polynomial this is and see if it can be simplified or factored. The equation is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, so it can have up to four solutions. Since the solutions form a convex polygon, it's likely that the solutions are the vertices of a quadrilateral, probably a square or rectangle, but I can't be sure yet.\n\nLooking at the equation, I notice that each term has a power of \\( z \\) and a coefficient that seems to be following a pattern. Let me write it out again:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6z^2 -4i z - i = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, the coefficients look like they might be related to the expansion of something like a binomial. Let me see: the coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. That pattern reminds me of the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\), which is \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6z^2 + 4i z + i^2 \\). Wait, but in our equation, the coefficients of \\( z^2 \\) and \\( z \\) are -6 and -4i, which are different from the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\). Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \\( (z + i)^4 \\) but with some modification. Let me compute \\( (z + i)^4 \\) to check:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6z^2 + 4i z + (i)^2 = z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6z^2 + 4i z"
