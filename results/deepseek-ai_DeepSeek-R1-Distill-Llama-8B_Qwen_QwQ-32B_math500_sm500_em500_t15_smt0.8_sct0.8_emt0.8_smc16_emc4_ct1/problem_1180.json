It seems pretty involved, but I'll take it one piece at a time.\n\nSo, the equation given is a quartic complex equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). The roots of this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and we need to find the area of that polygon. The answer will be expressed in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime, and then we need to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the equation. It's a quartic, so there are four roots. The coefficients are complex numbers, including \\( i \\) and \\( -i \\). This might hint that the roots have some symmetry or special properties.\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\)\n\nI notice that the coefficients have a pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. This seems reminiscent of the expansion of a binomial, maybe something like \\( (z + a)^4 \\), but not quite because the coefficients don't match. Alternatively, maybe it relates to some other polynomial identity or substitution.\n\nWait, let me think. The coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Let me see if I can factor this equation. Maybe it's a product of two quadratics. Let me try to factor it.\n\nSuppose it factors as \\( (z^2 + az + b)(z^2 + cz + d) \\). Then, expanding this:\n\n\\( z^4 + (a + c)z^3 + (ac + b + d)z^2 + (ad + bc)z + bd \\)\n\nSetting this equal to the given polynomial:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( z^4 \\): 1, which matches.\n2. Coefficient of \\( z^3 \\): \\( a + c = 4i \\)\n3. Coefficient of \\( z^2 \\): \\( ac + b + d = -6 \\)\n4. Coefficient of \\("

Let me confirm this.\n\nWait, the chord length between two adjacent roots is indeed the side length of the square. Since the original square is centered at the origin, shifting it down by \\( i \\) doesn't change the side length or the area. Therefore, the area should indeed be \\( (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nBut let me check again the chord length calculation.\n\nThe two points are separated by angle π/2, radius r = 2^{1/8}.\n\nChord length = 2r sin(θ/2) = 2*(2^{1/8})*sin(π/4).\n\nSin(π/4) is √2/2, so:\n\n2*(2^{1"

Here, \\( 2^{5/4} \\) can be written as \\( 2^{5/4} = 2^{5/4} \\), so \\( p = 2 \\), \\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 4 \\). Are 5 and 4 coprime? Yes, since their GCD is 1.\n\nTherefore, the area is \\( 2^{5/4} \\), so \\( p = 2 \\), \\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), so \\( a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \\).\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the equation is a quartic, and we have four roots. We found that these roots form a square, and the area is \\( 2^{5/4} \\), so 11 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the distance between two roots after the shift, because shifting could affect the distance. Wait, is the side length affected by shifting?\n\nWait, shifting doesn't change distances between points, only their absolute positions. So the distance between two roots is the same as it was before shifting. Therefore, the area remains the same.\n\nThus, yes, the area is indeed \\( 2^{5/4} \\), and the answer is 11.\n\nWait, hold on, just to make sure, let's visualize this.\n\nImagine the original square with four vertices at \\( 2^{1/8} e^{i\\pi/16} \\), \\( 2^{1/8} e^{"
