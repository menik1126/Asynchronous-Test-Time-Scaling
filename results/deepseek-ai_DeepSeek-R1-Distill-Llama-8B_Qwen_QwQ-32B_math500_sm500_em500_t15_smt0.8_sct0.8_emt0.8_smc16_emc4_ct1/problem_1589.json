            "output": "Alright, so I've got this equation to solve: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me break it down step by step. Maybe I can simplify it somehow or factor it.\n\nFirst, I notice that both sides have cubic terms. The right side is (2x - 10)^3. I wonder if I can factor the left side or maybe rewrite it in a way that makes it easier to compare to the right side. Let's see, 2x - 10 can be factored as 2(x - 5). So, the right side becomes [2(x - 5)]^3, which is 8(x - 5)^3. Maybe that can help later.\n\nNow, looking at the left side: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3. Hmm, these are two cubes being added together. I remember that in some cases, like the sum of cubes, there's a formula a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe I can apply that here. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set a = x - 3 and b = x - 7. Then the left side becomes a^3 + b^3, which factors into (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). So, let me compute a + b first: (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10. Oh, that's interesting because that's exactly the expression on the right side. So, a + b = 2x - 10, which is the same as the base of the right side's cube.\n\nSo, putting it together, the left side factors to (2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2). And the right side is (2x - 10)^3. So, we have:\n\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3\n\nHmm, maybe I can divide both sides by (2x - 10) as long as 2x - 10 ≠ 0. Wait, but if 2x - 10 = 0, that would mean"

I should check if that works in the original equation.\n\nPlugging x = 5 into the original equation: (5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = (2*5 - 10)^3\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(2)^3 + (-2)^3 = (10 - 10)^3\n\nSo, 8 + (-8) = 0^3 => 0 = 0.\n\nYes, that works. So, x = 5 is definitely a root.\n\nBut wait, can I just divide both sides by (2x - 10)? Let me think. If 2x - 10 ≠ 0, then dividing both sides by it would leave me with:\n\na^2 - ab + b^2 = (2x - 10)^2\n\nBut if 2x - 10 = 0, we already considered that case earlier. So, for the cases where 2x - 10 ≠ 0, I can proceed by expanding a^2 - ab + b^2.\n\nLet's compute a^2, ab, and b^2.\n\na = x - 3, so a^2 = (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nb = x -7, so b^2 = (x -7)^2 = x^2 -14x +49.\n\nab = (x -3)(x -7) = x^2 -10x +21.\n\nSo, a^2 - ab + b^2 = (x^2 -6x +9) - (x^2 -10x +21) + (x^2 -14x +49)\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\n= x^2 -6x +9 -x^2 +10x -21 +x^2 -14x +49\n\nNow, combine like terms.\n\nx^2 terms: x^2 - x^2 + x^2 = x^2\n\nx terms: -6x +10x -14x = (-6 +10 -14)x = (-10)x\n\nConstants: 9 -21 +49 = (9 +49) -21 = 58 -21 = 37\n\nSo, a^2 - ab + b"
