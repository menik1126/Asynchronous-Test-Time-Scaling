Let me see... First, I notice that both sides have a cube, so maybe I can find a substitution or use some algebraic identities.\n\nLooking at the left side, (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3. I remember that a^3 + b^3 can be factored as (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe that can help. Let me try that:\n\nLet a = x - 3 and b = x - 7. Then,\n\na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\n\nSo, a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as the right side of the equation, which is (2x - 10)^3. Interesting. So, substituting back in, we have:\n\n(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nBut since a + b = 2x - 10, that means:\n\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can factor (2x - 10) out from both sides. Let me write that:\n\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2 - (2x - 10)^2) = 0.\n\nSo, either 2x - 10 = 0 or the other factor is zero. Let's solve 2x - 10 = 0 first:\n\n2x - 10 = 0 => 2x = 10 => x = 5.\n\nOkay, so x = 5 is one solution. Now, let's look at the other factor:\n\na^2 - ab + b^2 - (2x - 10)^2 = 0.\n\nBut a and b are x - 3 and x - 7, respectively. Let's substitute those back in:\n\n(x -"

Alternatively, since a + b = 2x - 10, maybe I can express a^2 - ab + b^2 in terms of a + b and ab.\n\nI recall that a^2 - ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 3ab.\n\nSo, substituting that in, we have:\n\n(a + b)^2 - 3ab - (2x - 10)^2 = 0.\n\nBut since a + b = 2x - 10, this simplifies to:\n\n(2x - 10)^2 - 3ab - (2x - 10)^2 = 0.\n\nWait, that simplifies further. Let me write that:\n\n(2x - 10)^2 - 3ab - (2x - 10)^2 = 0.\n\nThe (2x - 10)^2 terms cancel out, leaving:\n\n-3ab = 0 => ab = 0.\n\nSo, ab = 0. But ab = (x - 3)(x - 7) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are when either x - 3 = 0 or x - 7 = 0.\n\nSo, x = 3 or x = 7.\n\nWait, so putting it all together, from the first factor, we had x = 5, and from the second factor, x = 3 or x = 7. So, are these all the roots?\n\nBut I should check if these are distinct or if any are repeated. So, the solutions are x = 3, x = 5, and x = 7.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should plug these back into the original equation to verify.\n\nLet's test x = 3:\n\nLeft side: (3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 - 64 = -64.\n\nRight side: (2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 - 10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64. So yes, it works.\n\nx = 5:\n\nLeft side:"

Therefore, the roots are 3, 5, and 7.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, I should consider if there's another way the equation might have more roots or if I missed something. For a cubic equation, there should be exactly three roots (including multiplicity), and since all three solutions satisfy the equation, that's all of them.\n\nI think that's it. So, the roots are x = 3, 5, and 7.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\). \n\nFirst, factor the left side using the sum of cubes identity:\n\\[\na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\n\\]\nLet \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\).
