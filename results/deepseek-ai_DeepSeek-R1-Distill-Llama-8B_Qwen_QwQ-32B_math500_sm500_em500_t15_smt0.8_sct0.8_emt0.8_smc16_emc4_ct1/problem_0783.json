Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. If I have a point \\( (x, y) \\), the distance \\( D \\) from the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\]\n\nSo, I want to minimize this distance. Since the square root can complicate things, maybe it's easier to minimize the square of the distance instead. That way, I can work without the square root and make the differentiation simpler. So, let's define a function \\( f(x) \\) as:\n\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 + y^2 \\]\n\nBut since \\( y \\) is given in terms of \\( x \\), I can substitute it into \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\]\n\nLet me simplify that. First, square the second term:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 (x^2 - 3)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\]\n\nSo, now \\( f(x) \\) becomes:\n\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\]\n\nI can expand that \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 \\) term:\n\n\\[ (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \\]\n\nSo, plugging that back into \\( f(x) \\):\n\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \\]\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 +"
