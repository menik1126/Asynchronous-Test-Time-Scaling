Then, express that distance as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, with \\( a \\) square-free, and find \\( a + b \\). Hmm, let me think how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the distance from a point to the origin can be calculated using the distance formula. If I have a point \\( (x, y) \\), the distance \\( D \\) from the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) is given by \\( D = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} \\), which simplifies to \\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nGiven the equation of the graph \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), I can substitute this into the distance formula. So, substituting \\( y \\) gives:\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\).\n\nLet me write that out step by step.\n\n1. Start with the distance formula: \\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\n2. Substitute \\( y \\): \\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\).\n\nNow, I need to simplify this expression. Let's compute the square term first.\n\n3. Compute \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\): that's \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n4. So, \\( y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\).\n\n5. Now, substitute back into the distance formula:\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \\).\n\nOkay, so my next step is to square both sides to make it easier to handle.
