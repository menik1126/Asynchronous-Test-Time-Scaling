            "output": "First, I'll evaluate the original expression without any parentheses: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. Calculating step by step, I add 1 and 2 to get 3, then add 3 to get 6. Subtracting 4 brings it to 2, adding 5 gives 7, and finally adding 6 results in 13.\n\nNext, to explore if parentheses can reduce the value, I'll consider different placements.\n\n1. **Option 1:** Wrapping the last three terms: (1+2+3) - (4+5) + 6. This simplifies to 6 - 9 + 6, which equals 3.\n\n2. **Option 2:** Wrapping terms differently to group more subtractions together. For example, (1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5) + 6. This becomes 1 + 2 - 1 + 5 + 6, totaling 17. This is higher than the original, so it's not beneficial.\n\n3. **Option 3:** Another arrangement: 1 + (2 + 3 - (4 + 5)) + 6. This simplifies to 1 + (5 - 9) + 6, resulting in 1 - 4 + 6, which is 3. This matches the first option.\n\n4. **Option 4:** Trying to group even more terms: (1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + (5 + 6). This gives 6 + 11, which equals 17. Again, this doesn't reduce the value.\n\nFrom these attempts, the minimum value achieved is 3 by strategically placing parentheses to prioritize subtractions. Therefore, the smallest possible value of the expression, using only parentheses, is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum possible value of the expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\) by adding parentheses without changing the order of operations, let's explore various placements of the parentheses.\n\n1. **Original Expression (No Parentheses):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13\n   \\]\n\n2. **Placing Parentheses to Group Subtractions:**\n   - **Option 1:** \\((1 +"

    "question": "The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)\n\nEnter your answer as a single value.",
