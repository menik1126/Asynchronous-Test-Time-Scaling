So perhaps I can structure it as:\n\n1 + 2 + (3 -4 -5 -6) ?\n\nWait, but that's not allowed because we can't change the order of operations or insert multiplication. The question says parentheses can only be added, and the existing operations are addition and subtraction, which must remain as they are. So, I can only place parentheses around existing operations, not change them.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: let's try grouping 3 -4, so (3 -4), which would be -1, then the expression becomes 1 +2 + (-1) +5 +6 = 1+2=3, 3-1=2, 2+5=7, 7+6=13.\n\nAlternatively, grouping more terms, maybe (1 +2 +3) -4 +5 +6 =6 -4 +5 +6= 6-4=2, 2+5=7, 7+6=13.\n\nAlternatively, 1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6: 2+3=5, 5-4=1, 1+5=6, 6+6=12.\n\nWait, that's 12.\n\nWait, let me compute that again:\n\n1 + (2+3-4) +5 +6.\n\nCompute inside the parentheses: 2+3=5, 5-4=1.\n\nSo the expression becomes 1 +1 +5 +6 = 13.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a way to subtract a larger group.

Wait, but the original expression after 3 is -4 +5 +6. To group 4+5+6, but the minus is only before 4. So to group 4+5+6, you need to have parentheses around them, but the operator before 4 is a minus, so it would be 3 - (4+5+6). Let me see:\n\nOriginal expression: 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.\n\nIf I group the terms after 3 as ( -4 +5 +6 ), but that's just 7. Alternatively, if I group 4 +5 +6 as a positive group, but with the minus before 4, so it would be 3 - (4 +5 +6). Let me see:\n\nSo the expression would be 1 +2 + [3 - (4 +5 +6)].\n\nBreaking down:\n\nFirst compute 4+5+6 =15. Then 3 -15 = -12. Then 1+2 + (-12) = 3 -12 = -9. Then, but wait, the original expression after 3 is -4 +5 +6. So inserting parentheses around 4+5+6 would require that the minus applies to the entire group. So yes, that's allowed. So the expression becomes:\n\n1 +2 + (3 - (4 +5 +6)) = 1 +2 + (3 -15) = 1+2-12 = -9.\n\nWait, that's a valid grouping?

So if I group 4+5+6, the expression would be 3 - (4 +5 +6). So the entire grouping after 3 is a single negative group.\n\nSo yes, that's valid. So the expression becomes 1+2 + (3 - (4 +5 +6)).\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\nCompute 4+5+6=15.\n\nThen 3 -15= -12.\n\nThen 1+2=3.\n\nSo 3 + (-12)= -9.\n\nThat gives us -9.\n\nWait, that's much lower. So is that allowed? Because we can't change the order, but we can group the terms after the 3 as (4+5+6) with the minus before 4, making it (3 - (4+5+6)).\n\nSo that's one way. So that would give us -9.\n\nIs that the minimum? Let me check if I can get lower.\n\nWait, can I group more terms? For example, group the 5 +6 as a positive group after the minus.
