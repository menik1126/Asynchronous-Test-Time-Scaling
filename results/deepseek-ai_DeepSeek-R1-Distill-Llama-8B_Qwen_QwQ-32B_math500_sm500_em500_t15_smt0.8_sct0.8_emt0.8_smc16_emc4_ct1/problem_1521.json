So, we have a sequence of positive real numbers, \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\), and we're given three sums: the sum of the numbers is 96, the sum of their squares is 144, and the sum of their cubes is 216. We need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given:\n\n1. \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)  (Let's call this S1)\n2. \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)  (Let's call this S2)\n3. \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)  (Let's call this S3)\n\nI remember that in problems involving sums of powers, sometimes we can relate them using identities or inequalities. Maybe there's a relationship that can connect S1, S2, and S3.\n\nWait, another thought: for a set of numbers, the variance can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\( \\sigma^2 = \\frac{S2}{n} - \\left( \\frac{S1}{n} \\right)^2 \\)\n\nSo, maybe I can find the variance and then use that to find more information about the sequence. Let me compute the variance first.\n\nGiven S1 = 96, so the mean \\( \\mu = \\frac{96}{n} \\).\n\nSimilarly, S2 = 144, so the variance would be:\n\n\\( \\sigma^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\mu^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 \\)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( \\sigma^2 = \\frac{144}{n} - \\frac{9216}{n^2} = \\frac{144n - 9216}{n^2} \\)\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I also have S3 = 216. Maybe I can relate this to the variance or use some other inequality.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps considering the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or using the relationship between the sums of"

Let me think.\n\nI recall that for any real number \\( x \\), \\( a_i^3 \\) can be related to \\( a_i \\) and \\( a_i^2 \\) if we consider derivatives, but I'm not sure if that's the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think about moments. The first moment is the mean, the second is variance, and third is skewness. But I don't know if that directly helps here.\n\nAnother idea: if all the \\( a_i \\)s are equal, then each \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\), and then we can check what S2 and S3 would be.\n\nLet me compute that. If all \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\), then:\n\n\\( S2 = n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9216}{n} \\)\n\nBut we are given S2 = 144. So:\n\n\\( \\frac{9216}{n} = 144 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\( n = \\frac{9216}{144} = 64 \\)\n\nSimilarly, checking S3:\n\n\\( S3 = n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^3 = n \\times \\frac{884736}{n^3} = \\frac{884736}{n^2} \\)\n\nGiven S3 = 216:\n\n\\( \\frac{884736}{n^2} = 216 \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\( n^2 = \\frac{884736}{216} = 4108 \\)\n\nWait, that's not a perfect square. So \\( n = \\sqrt{4108} \\approx 64.15 \\), which is not an integer. But that's a problem because \\( n \\) has to be an integer since it's the number of terms. Hmm, this suggests that the only time the sum of squares and sum of cubes match the given values is when all terms are equal, but that leads to a non-integer \\( n \\).\n\nWait, but if all terms are equal, \\( n \\) must be 64, but then \\( S3 \\) would be \\( 216 \\times 64 = 13824 \\), which is way larger than 216. So that can't be. So maybe the terms are not all equal.\n\nSo"

But the question says \"sum of all possible values of n\", so maybe there are other n?\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider the Cauchy-Schwarz result earlier. We had that n must be at least 64. So n ≥64. But in the case of all terms equal, n=64 is the minimal possible n. So, perhaps there are other n greater than 64?\n\nWait, but how?\n\nSuppose that n is larger than 64, say n=65. Then, to get the sum of 96, the average would be 96/65 ≈1.4769. The sum of squares would be 144, so the average of squares is 144/65≈2.215. The variance would be 2.215 - (1.4769)^2 ≈2.215 - 2.181≈0.034, so very small variance. So, the terms would have to be very close to the mean. But then the sum of cubes would be approximately (96/65)^3 *65 ≈ (1.4769)^3 *65 ≈3.20 *65≈208, which is less than 216.

So, maybe n=64 is the minimal possible n, but perhaps higher values of n can exist with different arrangements.\n\nWait, but when n>64, for example, n=65, can we have terms arranged in a way that their sum is 96, sum of squares is 144, and sum of cubes is 216? It's possible, but it's not obvious. Maybe, but perhaps 64 is the only possible n.\n\nWait, let me try to check if n=64 is the only possible value. Let's see.\n\nWe have the variance σ²= (144/n) − (96/n)².\n\nFor n=64, it is:\n\nσ²=144/64 − (96/64)² = 2.25 − (1.5)^2=2.25 −2.25=0.\n\nSo variance is zero, implying all terms equal, which we already saw.\n\nFor n>64, say n=65, variance would be positive, since 144/65 ≈2.215, and (96/65)^2≈2.181, so variance≈0.034.\n\nSo, that's possible"
