However, since we have two roles (Yann and Camille), this formula already accounts for all ordered pairs without repetition.  \n  Wait, this directly gives the same result as considering one of the scenarios (either Yann first or Camille first). Wait, confusion here.\n\nWait, hold on, actually, permutations already account for the order. The correct way is to think of the two choices as ordered pairs (Yann's dish, Camille's dish), where the first element must be different from the second. The total number is:\n\nFor Yann's dish: 10 choices.\n\nFor Camille's dish: 9 choices (excluding Yann's dish).\n\nSo total is \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\).\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought there are two scenarios. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe error was thinking that there are two separate scenarios (Yann first or Camille first), but in reality, the problem **doesn't** require considering the order of their choices. The **distinguishability between Yann and Camille** is inherent. That is, the key is that Yann picks one and Camille picks another, so the **order is already accounted for** by their identities.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is:\n\nYann has 10 choices, Camille has 9, so total 10 \u00d7 9 = 90. Therefore, my second approach is correct. Originally, I thought of splitting into scenarios where either could pick first, but that led to double-counting. Wait no, actually, if you consider Yann and Camille as distinguishable, then the order of their choices (who picks first) does not affect the result. Let me clarify.\n\nSuppose the process is: they independently choose dishes"

            "output": ", but they cannot choose the same dish.\n\nSo, Yann has 10 choices. Then Camille has 9 choices (excluding Yann's). So total combinations: 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nAlternatively, if Camille chooses first, Camille has 10 choices, then Yann has 9. Total combinations: 10 \u00d7 9 = 90. But since the roles are fixed (Yann and Camille are distinct), whether Yann chooses first or Camille chooses first are two different scenarios, hence the total is 90 + 90 = 180.\n\nWait, now I'm getting conflicting answers. Let me resolve this.\n\nLet's think of it another way. Since Yann and Camille are distinct, the pair (dish Y, dish C) is different from (dish C, dish Y) unless Y = C, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, it's equivalent to counting the number of ordered pairs where Y and C are different. So, for each of Y's 10 choices, C has 9, so total is 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nBut wait, in this case, we are considering Y and C as ordered, so (Y1, C2) is different from (C2, Y1). Therefore, the correct count is indeed 90, not 180, because Y and C's roles are fixed. That is, Y is Yann and C is Camille, so the order is determined by who is choosing. So, no, my initial thought that it would be 90 is correct.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether their choices are independent or dependent on the order. Since the problem says it matters who orders what, so each combination where the dishes are assigned to different people is unique. Therefore, it's 10 (choices for Yann) multiplied by 9 (choices for Camille), giving 90. This is because for each of Yann's choices, Camille has 9 different options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{90}.\n\nWait, but in the initial reasoning, I thought of two scenarios (Yann first, Camille first), but that would result in double the actual number because each ordered pair is counted once depending on who chooses first.\n\nWait, perhaps we can also model this as the permutation of 10 dishes taken 2 at a time, where order matters.

The earlier split into two scenarios was incorrect because the permutation already captures all ordered pairs (Y,C) where Y and C are different.\n\nSo why did I think there were two scenarios initially? It was a mistake. The correct approach is to think of the total number of assignments where each person picks a dish without repetition, and since their roles are distinct, it's the permutation count.\n\nSo the final answer is 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{90}\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- There are **10 distinct dishes** on the menu.\n- **Yann** and **Camille** each want to order **one dish**.\n- They **refuse to order the same dish**.\n- The **order matters** (i.e., Yann choosing dish A and Camille choosing dish B is different from Yann choosing dish B and Camille choosing dish A).\n\n**Approach:**\nWe need to count the number of ordered pairs \\((\\text{Yann's dish}, \\text{Camille's dish})\\) where the two dishes are different.
