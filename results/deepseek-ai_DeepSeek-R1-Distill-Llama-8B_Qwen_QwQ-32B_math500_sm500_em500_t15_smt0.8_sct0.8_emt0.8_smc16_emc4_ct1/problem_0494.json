            "output": "To determine the volume of the original cube, I'll start by calculating its side length. The steel sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is 6 inches. Since the sphere is perfectly inscribed within the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the side length of the cube is 6 inches.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the cube using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is side length cubed. Plugging in the value of the side length, the volume is:\n\n6 inches \u00d7 6 inches \u00d7 6 inches = 216 cubic inches.\n\nSo, the volume of the original cube is 216 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:** A steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube:**\n   \n   - The sphere is inscribed inside the cube, meaning it touches the cube exactly at the centers of each face of the cube.\n   \n   - The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. This is because the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces, and the distance from one face to the opposite face of the cube is equal to the sphere's diameter.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sphere's Diameter:**\n   \n   - Given the radius of the sphere (\\( r \\)) is 3 inches.\n   \n   - The diameter (\\( d \\)) of the sphere is:\n     \\[\n     d = 2 \\times r = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Side Length of the Cube:**\n   \n   - Since the diameter of the sphere equals the side length of the cube.\n   \n   - Therefore, the side length of the cube (\\( s \\)) is:\n     \\[\n     s = d = 6 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**\n   \n   - The formula for the volume (\\( V \\)) of a cube is:\n     \\[\n     V = s^3\n     \\]\n   \n   - Plugging in the side length:\n     \\[\n     V = 6^"
