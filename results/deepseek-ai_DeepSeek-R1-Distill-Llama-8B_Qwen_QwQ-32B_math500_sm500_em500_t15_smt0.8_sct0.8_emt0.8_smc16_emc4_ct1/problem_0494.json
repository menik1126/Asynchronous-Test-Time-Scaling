This means the diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so that's 6 inches.\n\nNext, I need to find the relationship between the sphere's diameter and the cube's side length. If a sphere is inscribed inside a cube, the sphere's diameter equals the cube's side length. Therefore, the cube must have a side length of 6 inches.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the volume of the cube using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is side length cubed. So, the volume is 6 inches multiplied by itself three times: 6 * 6 * 6.\n\nFinally, I'll compute the numerical value to get the final volume in cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is created, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube:**\n   - When a sphere is inscribed in a cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sphere's Diameter:**\n   - Radius of the sphere (\\( r \\)) = 3 inches\n   - Diameter of the sphere (\\( d \\)) = \\( 2r = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) inches\n\n3. **Determine the Cube's Side Length:**\n   - The side length of the cube (\\( s \\)) is equal to the sphere's diameter.\n   - \\( s = 6 \\) inches\n\n4. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**\n   - Volume of a cube (\\( V \\)) = \\( s^3 \\)\n   - \\( V = 6^3 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\) cubic inches\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{216}"
