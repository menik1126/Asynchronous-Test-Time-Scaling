Let \\( g \\) represent the number of girls and \\( b \\) represent the number of boys attending the meeting.\n\nNext, I'll use the information that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. This means \\( g \\) can be expressed as \\( 13k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nThe problem also states that there are more girls than boys. This gives me the inequality \\( g > b \\).\n\nSince the total number of students is 35, I'll add the number of girls and boys to get the equation \\( 13k + b = 35 \\).\n\nTo find possible values of \\( k \\), I'll consider the range of \\( b \\) such that \\( b \\) is a positive integer and \\( g > b \\). This means \\( 13k > b \\), and since \\( b \\) must be less than 35, \\( k \\) can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nTesting \\( k = 1 \\), \\( g = 13 \\) and \\( b = 22 \\). However, \\( 13 > 22 \\) is false, so this is not a valid solution.\n\nTesting \\( k = 2 \\), \\( g = 26 \\) and \\( b = 9 \\). Here, \\( 26 > 9 \\) is true, so this is a possible solution.\n\nTesting \\( k = 3 \\), \\( g = 39 \\) which exceeds the total number of students, so this is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is when \\( b = 9 \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is more than the number of boys (\\( g > b \\)).\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\nLet:\n- \\( g \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( b \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Step 2: Express the Total Number of Students**\n\\[\ng + b = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Use the Information About Girls**\nSince the number of girls is a multiple of 13, we can express \\( g \\) as:\n\\[\ng = 13k\n\\"
