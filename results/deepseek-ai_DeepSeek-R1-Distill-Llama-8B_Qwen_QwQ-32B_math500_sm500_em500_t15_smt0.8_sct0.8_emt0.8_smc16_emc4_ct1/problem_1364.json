Let G represent the number of girls, and B represent the number of boys.\n\nSince the total number of students is 35, I can write the equation:\nG + B = 35\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. The multiples of 13 are 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since the total number of students is 35, the number of girls can't exceed that. So, the possible number of girls is 13 or 26.\n\nNext, it's given that there are more girls than boys. This means G > B.\n\nI'll start by testing the first multiple, G = 13:\nIf G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. However, this doesn't satisfy G > B because 13 is not greater than 22.\n\nNow, I'll check the next multiple, G = 26:\nIf G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. Here, 26 > 9, which satisfies the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nSince the next multiple, G = 39, exceeds the total number of students, it's not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is G = 26 and B = 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem using step-by-step reasoning.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (𝐺) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is more than the number of boys (𝐵).\n\n**Let’s define:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Step 1: Express the relationship between G and B.**\n\\[\nG + B = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the possible values of G.**\nSince \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13 and \\( G < 35 \\), the possible values for \\( G \\) are 13, 26.\n\n**Step 3: Find the corresponding values of B.**\n\n- If \\( G = 13 \\):\n "

This satisfies the condition \\( G > B \\).\n\n**Step 4: Verify no other multiples of 13 are valid.**\nThe next multiple of 13 is 39, which exceeds the total number of students (35). Thus, it is invalid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only valid solution is \\( B = 9 \\).\n\n\\boxed{9}"
