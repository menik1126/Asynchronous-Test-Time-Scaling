Proper divisors are the positive integers that divide 284 without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.\n\nI'll start by factoring 284. I know that 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2.\n\n284 \u00f7 2 = 142\n\nNext, I'll factor 142. It's also even, so it's divisible by 2.\n\n142 \u00f7 2 = 71\n\nNow, I need to check if 71 is a prime number. Since 71 isn't divisible by any prime numbers other than 1 and itself, it's a prime.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71\u00b9.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p\u207f + 1)/(p - 1) for each prime power in the factorization and then multiply the results together:\n\nFor 2\u00b2: (2\u00b2 + 1)/(2 - 1) = 5/1 = 5\n\nFor 71\u00b9: (71\u00b9 + 1)/(71 - 1) = 72/70 = 36/35 \u2248 1.0286\n\nMultiplying these together: 5 \u00d7 1.0286 = 5.142\n\nSince we're only interested in the proper divisors, I'll subtract 284 from the total sum of divisors: 5.142 - 284 \u2248 -278.857\n\nHowever, this negative number doesn't make sense for proper divisors. I must have made a mistake in calculating the sum of divisors.\n\nRechecking the formula, I realize that I should use the formula (p\u207f - 1)/(p - 1) for each prime power when calculating the sum of proper divisors.\n\nFor 2\u00b2: (2\u00b2 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 3/1 = 3\n\nFor 71\u00b9: (71\u00b9 - 1)/(71 - 1) = 70/70 = 1\n\nAdding these together: 3 + 1 = 4\n\nNow, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 4.\n\nFinally, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of this sum, which is the sum of the proper divisors of 4.\n\nThe proper divisors of 4 are 1 and"

Their sum is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the steps again because I might have messed up the divisor sum formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should list all the proper divisors of 284 manually.\n\nStarting with 1, then check divisibility up to sqrt(284) which is about 16.85.\n\nCheck 2: 284 \u00f7 2 = 142, so 2 and 142. But 142 is greater than 284? No, 142 is less than 284, so it's a proper divisor.\n\nWait, 284 divided by 2 is 142, so 142 is a proper divisor.\n\nNext, 4: 284 \u00f7 4 = 71, so 4 and 71 are divisors.\n\nCheck 71: 71 is a prime number, so no further divisors there.\n\nCheck 3: 2+8+4=14, which isn't divisible by 3, so 3 isn't a divisor.\n\nCheck 5: ends with 4, so no.\n\nCheck 6: 284 \u00f7 6 \u2248 47.33, not integer.\n\nCheck 7: 284 \u00f7 7 \u2248 40.57, nope.\n\nContinuing up to sqrt(284):\n\nCheck 8: 284 \u00f7 8 = 35.5, no.\n\n9: 284 \u00f79 \u224831.55, no.\n\n10: 28.4, no.\n\n11: 284 \u00f711 \u224825.81, no.\n\n12: 23.66, no.\n\n13: 21.84, no.\n\n14: 20.28, no.\n\n15: 18.93, no.\n\n16: 17.75, no.\n\nSo the proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation.

It seems my initial formula approach was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, I think I confused the formulas. Let me clarify.\n\nThe formula for the sum of all divisors, \u03c3(n), is multiplicative. For n = p^a * q^b, \u03c3(n) = (1 + p + p\u00b2 + ... + p^a) * (1 + q + ... + q^b).\n\nBut for proper divisors, we need to subtract n itself. So sum of proper divisors = \u03c3(n) - n.\n\nLet me re-calculate \u03c3(284):\n\n284 factors as 2\u00b2 * 71\u00b9.\n\n\u03c3(284) = (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 71) = 7 * 72 = 504.\n\nTherefore, the sum of proper divisors is 504 - 284 = 220.\n\nSo the initial mistake was my incorrect application of the formula earlier.\n\nNow, having the sum of proper divisors as 220, the next step is to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220.\n\nSo, now need to find the sum of proper divisors of 220.\n\nFirst, factorize 220.\n\n220 \u00f7 2 = 110\n\n110 \u00f7 2 = 55\n\n55 \u00f7 5 = 11\n\n11 is prime.\n\nSo, 220 = 2\u00b2 * 5\u00b9 * 11\u00b9\n\nUsing the \u03c3(n) formula again:\n\n\u03c3(220) = (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 5) * (1 + 11) = 7 * 6 * 12 = 504\n\nSum of proper divisors = \u03c3(220) - 220 = 504 - 220 = 284\n\nWait, that's interesting. The sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284, which was the original number.\n\nIn number theory, such numbers where the sum of proper divisors equals the number itself are called perfect numbers. However, 284 is a known perfect number because it's equal to the sum of its proper divisors.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, and the sum"

Since the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, then we need the sum of the proper divisors of 220, which is 284. Therefore, the answer is 284.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this step-by-step again.\n\nFirst step: sum of proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n\nSecond step: sum of proper divisors of 220 is 284.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 284.\n\nBut let me verify the calculation for \u03c3(220):\n\n220 factors: 2\u00b2 \u00d75 \u00d711.\n\n\u03c3(220) = (1 + 2 + 4) \u00d7 (1 +5) \u00d7 (1 +11) = 7 \u00d76 \u00d712 = 7\u00d772 = 504. Then 504 -220 = 284. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 284.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284\".\n\nSo first, compute sum of proper divisors of 284: 220.\n\nThen compute sum of proper divisors of 220: 284.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 284. So boxed, it's \\boxed{284}.\n\nBut hold on, I thought the question was asking for the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284. So that is indeed 284. But let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first step. Let me recheck the proper divisors of 284.\n\n284's divisors:\n\n1, 2, 4, 71, 142, 284. Excluding 284, the proper divisors are 1,2,4,71,142. Their sum is 1+2+4+71+142 = 220. Correct"
