Since 71 is a prime number, the prime factors of 284 are 2, 2, and 71.\n\nNext, I'll list all the positive divisors of 284 by combining these prime factors. The divisors are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and 284.\n\nNow, I'll identify the proper divisors, which are all the divisors except the number itself. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the sum of these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142, which equals 220.\n\nNow, I'll find the proper divisors of 220. Again, I'll perform prime factorization. 220 factors into 4 \u00d7 55, and further into 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 11.\n\nListing all positive divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, and 220.\n\nThe proper divisors are all except 220, which are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110.\n\nSumming these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 equals 283.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 283.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.**\n3. **Find the proper divisors of this sum.**\n4. **Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Find the proper divisors of 284."
