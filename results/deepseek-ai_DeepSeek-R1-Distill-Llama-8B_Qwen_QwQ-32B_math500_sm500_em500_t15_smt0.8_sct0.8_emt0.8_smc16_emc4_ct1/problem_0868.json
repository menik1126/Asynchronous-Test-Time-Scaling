            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to combine these square roots and their reciprocals into a single fraction. The expression is √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3. The goal is to write this in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I need to find a + b + c.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I should probably deal with each pair separately. Let me look at the terms involving √2 and the terms involving √3. That might make it easier.\n\nStarting with √2 + 1/√2. I remember that 1/√2 can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by √2, which gives √2/2. So, 1/√2 = √2/2. That means √2 + 1/√2 is the same as √2 + √2/2. Combining those, since they have the same radical.\n\nLet me compute that: √2 is the same as 2√2/2. So, 2√2/2 + √2/2 equals (2√2 + √2)/2, which is 3√2/2. So that part simplifies to 3√2/2.\n\nNow, moving on to √3 + 1/√3. I think I can do the same thing here. Rationalize 1/√3 by multiplying numerator and denominator by √3, resulting in √3/3. So, 1/√3 is √3/3.\n\nTherefore, √3 + 1/√3 becomes √3 + √3/3. Converting √3 to thirds, it's 3√3/3, so adding that to √3/3 gives 4√3/3.\n\nSo now, the original expression is 3√2/2 + 4√3/3. Now, I need to combine these two fractions into a single fraction. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator would be 6.\n\nLet's rewrite each fraction with denominator 6. For 3√2/2, multiply numerator and denominator by 3, giving (9√2)/6. For 4√3/"

            "output": "3, multiply numerator and denominator by 2, resulting in (8√3)/6.\n\nSo now, the expression is (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Let me check if this can be simplified further. The numerator has terms with √2 and √3, which don't combine any further, and the denominator is 6. Are there any common factors between 9 and 8 and 6? Well, 9 and 6 have a common factor of 3, and 8 and 6 have a common factor of 2. However, since a, b, and c must all be integers, and we can't have a common factor across all three terms (9, 8, 6) unless that factor is 1. Because 9 and 8 are co-prime (their greatest common divisor is 1). So, 9 and 8 don't share any common factors beyond 1, meaning the denominator can't be simplified further without changing the value of the expression.\n\nSo the expression is (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Therefore, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Adding them together: 9 + 8 is 17, plus 6 is 23. So a + b + c is 23.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Especially when I added 3√2/2 and 4√3/3. The common denominator was 6, so multiplying 3√2/2 by 3/3 gives 9√2/6. Similarly, 4√3/3 multiplied by 2/2 gives 8√3/6. That seems correct. Then adding the numerators gives 9√2 + 8√3. Yeah, that looks right.\n\nAnother thing to check: when I simplified √2 + 1/√2, I got 3√2/2, which is correct because 1/√2 is √2/2, so adding √2 gives 3√2/2. Similarly for √3 + 1/√3, that's 4√3/3. So yes, those steps are accurate.\n\nTherefore, I think my final answer is correct, which is 23.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we first simplify each pair of terms involving √"
