The problem states that for every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric, and the subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is arithmetic. We're given that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\) and we need to find \\( a_1 \\).\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, let's recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\nA geometric sequence has each term after the first obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. So, for \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) being geometric, there exists some common ratio \\( r_k \\) such that:\n\\[\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \\times r_k\n\\]\n\\[\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} \\times r_k = a_{2k-1} \\times r_k^2\n\\]\n\nAn arithmetic sequence has each term after the first obtained by adding a constant difference. So, for \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) being arithmetic, there exists some common difference \\( d_k \\) such that:\n\\[\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k\n\\]\n\\[\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k = a_{2k} + 2d_k\n\\]\n\nGiven that the sequence is strictly increasing, all the terms \\( d_k \\) and \\( r_k \\) must be positive.\n\nNow, since the entire sequence is built using these interleaving geometric and arithmetic sequences, I can try to express the terms in terms of \\( a_{2k-1} \\) and \\( r_k \\), as well as in terms of \\( a_{2k} \\) and \\( d_k \\). Maybe I can relate these expressions to find a pattern or recurrence.\n\nStarting with \\( k = 1 \\):\n- \\( a"
