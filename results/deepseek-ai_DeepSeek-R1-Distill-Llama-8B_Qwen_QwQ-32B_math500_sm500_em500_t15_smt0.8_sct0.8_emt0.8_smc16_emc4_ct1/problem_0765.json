The problem says that for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Additionally, I know that a13 is 2016, and I need to find a1.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to parse this. First, the sequence is strictly increasing, which means each term is larger than the previous one. That makes sense\u2014so no repeats or decreases in the sequence.\n\nNow, for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence means each term is multiplied by a common ratio. So, for each k, a2k is a_{2k-1} multiplied by some ratio r, and a_{2k+1} is a_{2k} multiplied by the same ratio r. That is, a2k = r * a_{2k-1}, and a_{2k+1} = r * a_{2k}.\n\nSimilarly, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence means each term is obtained by adding a common difference. So, a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d, and a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d, where d is the common difference.\n\nSo, putting that together, we have two properties for each k:\n\n1. For the geometric part: a_{2k} = r * a_{2k - 1}, and a_{2k + 1} = r * a_{2k}\n2. For the arithmetic part: a_{2k + 1} = a_{2k} + d, and a_{2k + 2} = a_{2k + 1} + d\n\nSince the sequence is strictly increasing, all the terms are positive integers, and each term is larger than the one before.\n\nOur goal is to find a1"

Let me think about how to model this.\n\nMaybe I can try to express each term in terms of a1 and some ratios and differences.\n\nBut since it's a recursive definition, perhaps it's better to model this as a kind of recursive sequence where each pair of triplets defines the next terms.\n\nLet me see\u2014Each odd index triplet defines a geometric sequence, and each even index triplet (starting from the second term) defines an arithmetic sequence.\n\nWait, maybe not. Wait, for each k, we have a_{2k - 1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k + 1} being geometric, and then a_{2k}, a_{2k + 1}, a_{2k + 2} being arithmetic.\n\nSo, starting from any term, say a1, the next two terms a2 and a3 form a geometric sequence with a1. Similarly, a2, a3, a4 form an arithmetic sequence, then a3, a4, a5 form a geometric sequence, a4, a5, a6 form an arithmetic sequence, and so on.\n\nSo, the pattern alternates between geometric and arithmetic sequences, two terms at a time.\n\nSo, for each k, starting from k=1, we have:\n\n1. a1, a2, a3 is geometric: so a2 = a1 * r1, and a3 = a2 * r1 = a1 * r1^2\n2. Then a2, a3, a4 is arithmetic: a3 = a2 + d1, so a4 = a3 + d1 = a2 + 2*d1\n3. Next, a3, a4, a5 is geometric: a4 = a3 * r2, and a5 = a4 * r2\n4. Then a4, a5, a6 is arithmetic: a5 = a4 + d2, so a6 = a5 + d2\n5. And so on...\n\nWait, so each time, for the geometric sequence, the ratio can be different for each triplet, right? Similarly, the common difference can be different for each arithmetic triplet.\n\nBut the problem is also that the entire sequence is strictly increasing, so each ratio and difference must be such that the terms keep increasing.\n\nBut since the problem says \"for every positive integer k"

Let me try to write down the first few terms in terms of a1 and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me start with term a1.

So,\n\na3 = a2 + d1,\n\na4 = a3 + d1 = a2 + 2*d1.\n\nBut from the geometric sequence, a3 = a1 * r1^2, and a2 = a1 * r1. Therefore,\n\na1 * r1^2 = a1 * r1 + d1,\n\nso d1 = a1 * r1^2 - a1 * r1 = a1 * r1 (r1 - 1).\n\nTherefore, a4 = a2 + 2*d1 = a1 * r1 + 2*(a1 * r1 (r1 -1)) = a1 * r1 + 2 a1 r1 (r1 -1) = a1 r1 [1 + 2(r1 -1)] = a1 r1 [2r1 -1].\n\nHmm, okay. So a4 is expressed in terms of a1 and r1.\n\nNow, moving on to the next triplet (k=2):\n\nThe next geometric triplet is a3, a4, a5.
