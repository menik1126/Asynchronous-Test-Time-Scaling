            "output": "First, I'll define the initial number of blue marbles as 4x and yellow marbles as 3x based on the given ratio of 4:3.\n\nNext, I'll set up the equation for the new ratio after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles. The new ratio becomes (4x + 5) : (3x - 3).\n\nI'll simplify this equation to (4x + 5)/(3x - 3) = 7/3. Then, I'll cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions, resulting in 3*(4x + 5) = 7*(3x - 3).\n\nExpanding both sides gives 12x + 15 = 21x - 21. I'll bring all terms to one side to solve for x, leading to 9x = 36. Finally, I'll find x = 4.\n\nSubstituting x back into the initial number of blue marbles, I get 4*4 = 16.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let**:\n- Initial number of blue marbles = \\(4x\\)\n- Initial number of yellow marbles = \\(3x\\)  \n*(Since the ratio is 4:3)*\n\n**After Adding and Removing**:\n- Blue marbles added = 5 → Total blue marbles = \\(4x + 5\\)\n- Yellow marbles removed = 3 → Total yellow marbles = \\(3x - 3\\)\n\n**New Ratio**:\n\\[\n\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Solve for \\(x\\)**:\n\\[\n3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n\\]\n\\[\n12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\\]\n\\[\n15 + 21 = 21x - 12x\n\\]\n\\[\n36 = 9x\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{36}{9} = 4\n\\]\n\n**Initial Number of Blue Marbles**:\n\\[\n4x = 4 \\times 4 = 16\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
