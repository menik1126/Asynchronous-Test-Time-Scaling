            "output": "I need to figure out the original number of blue marbles in the bag. Let's denote the number of blue marbles as B and the number of yellow marbles as Y.\n\nCurrently, the ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means B/Y = 4/3. So, I can express B as (4/3)Y.\n\nIf I add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, the new number of blue marbles becomes B + 5, and the new number of yellow marbles becomes Y - 3. The new ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 7:3. Therefore, (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3.\n\nNow, I'll substitute B from the first equation into the second equation. So, ( (4/3)Y + 5 ) / (Y - 3) = 7/3.\n\nTo solve for Y, I'll cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions. This gives me 3( (4/3)Y + 5 ) = 7(Y - 3).\n\nSimplifying this, I get 4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21. Then, subtracting 4Y from both sides and adding 21 to both sides, I find Y = 12.\n\nFinally, substituting Y back into B = (4/3)Y, I calculate B = 16.\n</think>\n\nLet’s solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\nLet:\n- \\( B \\) = number of blue marbles before any changes\n- \\( Y \\) = number of yellow marbles before any changes\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Ratio**\nInitially, the ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 4:3 \\). This can be written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\nB = \\frac{4}{3}Y\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Changes**\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles:\n- New number of blue marbles: \\( B + 5 \\)\n- New number of yellow marbles: \\( Y - 3 \\)\n\nThe new ratio becomes \\( 7:3 \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{B + 5}{Y"
