            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about bus riders at Central H.S., and I need to figure out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to unpack it step by step.\n\nFirst, the table gives the percentages of males and females in each grade who ride the bus. The survey included 300 males and 300 females in each grade, right? So, each grade has equal numbers of males and females being surveyed\u2014300 each. That might simplify things a bit because I can probably calculate the actual number of bus riders for each gender and grade without having to worry about the overall population beyond the 300 surveyed.\n\nLet me write down the percentages again to make sure I have them correct:\n\n- 9th grade: 41.1% males, 39.4% females.\n- 10th grade: 34.4% males, 33.1% females.\n- 11th grade: 20.6% males, 13.8% females.\n- 12th grade: 11.6% males, 8.6% females.\n\nSince each grade has 300 males and 300 females surveyed, I can calculate how many males and females actually ride the bus by taking the percentage and multiplying it by the number surveyed.\n\nFor example, for the 9th grade, the number of male bus riders would be 41.1% of 300, and female bus riders would be 39.4% of 300. Let me compute these for each grade.\n\nStarting with the 9th grade:\n\nMale bus riders: 0.411 * 300 = 123.3\nFemale bus riders: 0.394 * 300 = 118.2\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of male bus riders being closest to 135% of the female bus riders. So, I need to see for each grade, whether the number of males is approximately 1.35 times the number of females. Let me think about how to compute that.\n\nFor each grade, I can compute the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders. If that ratio is equal to 135%, then the number of male riders is exactly 135% of female riders. But since we can't have fractions of people, I need to find which grade is closest to that ratio"

Let me confirm that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the difference between male bus riders and 135% of female bus riders to be minimal. Let me think.\n\nThe question says: \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders\". So, that's exactly saying (male riders) \u2248 1.35*(female riders). The difference between male riders and 1.35*(female riders) should be minimal. Alternatively, calculating the ratio (male)/(female) = 1.35 would be ideal, so the ratio closest to 1.35 would be the answer. Let's see.\n\nSo, either way, ratio or absolute difference, but since the percentages are given, and the numbers are calculated from 300, the ratio approach should work. Let me go with that because percentages might make it easier, but let me check.\n\nWait, actually, since the number of males and females are both 300, the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders can also be calculated as (percentage male / percentage female). Because if you take the number (percentages multiplied by 300), the 300 cancels out in the ratio.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\nMale riders = P_m * 300\n\nFemale riders = P_f * 300\n\nTherefore, male/female = (P_m)/ (P_f). So, the ratio of male to female bus riders is just the ratio of the percentages. That's a good point. So, the ratio is (percentage of males) divided by (percentage of females). Therefore, instead of calculating actual numbers, I can compute (P_m / P_f) and see which is closest to 1.35. Since the 300 is a common factor, this ratio is the same as the actual ratios of numbers.\n\nSo that's a shortcut to avoid dealing with decimal numbers. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the target is 1.35. Let's compute P_m / P_f for each grade:\n\n9th grade: 41.1 / 39."

So, 1.7 / 39.4 \u2248 0.0429. So total is approximately 1.0429.\n\nWait, that's 1.0429, which is like 104.29% of female riders. That's quite a bit less than 135%.\n\nMoving on to 10th grade:\n\n34.4 / 33.1.\n\nDo the same: 33.1 goes into 34.4 once, remainder 1.3. 1.3 / 33.1 \u2248 0.0392, so total \u2248 1.0392, so ~103.92%. Still pretty low compared to 135%.\n\n11th grade: 20.6 / 13.8.\n\nCompute this. 13.8 goes into 20.6 once, with 6.8 remaining. 6.8 /13.8 \u2248 0.491. So total is 1.491, so about 149.1%.\n\nThat is getting closer to 135%.\n\nFinally, 12th grade: 11.6 / 8.6.\n\n11.6 divided by 8.6.\n\n8.6 goes into 11.6 once, with 3.0 remaining. 3.0 /8.6 \u2248 0.348. So total \u2248 1.348, which is approximately 134.8%.\n\nWow, that's really close to 135%.\n\nSo, let me summarize the ratios:\n\n- 9th: ~1.0429 (about 104.29%)\n- 10th: ~1.0392 (about 103.92%)\n- 11th: ~1.491 (about 149.1%)\n- 12th: ~1.348 (about 134.8%)\n\nSo the 12th grade's ratio is closer to"

So clearly, 12th is much closer.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 12th grade.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the absolute difference between male and 135% of female.\n\nLet me try that for each grade.\n\nSo, for each grade, compute (male riders) - 1.35*(female riders), and see which has the smallest absolute value.\n\nBut maybe that's a bit more work, but let's try that.\n\nFirst, for each grade:\n\nMale riders: P_m * 300\n\nFemale riders: P_f * 300\n\nSo 135% of female riders = 1.35 * (P_f * 300)\n\nWe need (P_m *300) \u2248 1.35*(P_f *300)\n\nSo, for each grade, compute P_m / P_f, as earlier, but maybe I should check using the actual numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps my first method was sufficient because when we take the ratio, 1.35 is the same as 135%, so if P_m / P_f is closest to 1.35, then male riders are closest to 135% of female riders.\n\nSo with that, the 12th grade is 1.348, which is 0.012 away from 1.35, which is like 0.9% difference.\n\nWait, 1.348 is 134.8%, so the difference from 135% is 0.2%.\n\nWhereas the 11th is 149.1%, which is 14.1 above 135.\n\nTherefore, 12th grade is much closer.\n\nHence, the answer is 12th grade.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the female bus riders. By calculating the ratio of male to female percentages for each grade, it's found that the 12th grade has a ratio closest to 1.35 (or 135%).\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n"
