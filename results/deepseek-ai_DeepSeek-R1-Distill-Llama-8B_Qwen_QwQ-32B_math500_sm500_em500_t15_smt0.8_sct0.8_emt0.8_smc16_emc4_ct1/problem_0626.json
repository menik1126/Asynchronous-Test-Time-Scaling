Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the domain of a function includes all the possible x-values for which the function is defined. Since g(x) is a square root, the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to zero. Because if it's negative, we can't take the square root of a negative number in real numbers. So, the first thing I should do is set up that inequality.\n\nSo, the expression inside the square root is (x-3)^2 minus (x-8)^2. Let me write that down:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0\n\nNow, I need to simplify this expression. It looks like a difference of squares, which has a formula. The difference of squares formula is a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can apply that here. Let me let a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). So,\n\n[(x - 3) - (x - 8)] * [(x - 3) + (x - 8)] ≥ 0\n\nLet me compute each part inside the brackets. \n\nFirst bracket: (x - 3) - (x - 8). Let me distribute the negative sign:\n\nx - 3 - x + 8. The x terms cancel out: x - x = 0, and then -3 + 8 = 5. So the first bracket is 5.\n\nSecond bracket: (x - 3) + (x - 8). Let me add those together:\n\nx - 3 + x - 8. Combine like terms: x + x = 2x, and -3 -8 = -11. So the second bracket is (2x - 11).\n\nPutting it back together, the inequality becomes:\n\n5 * (2x - 11) ≥ 0\n\nSo, 5*(2x -11) ≥ 0. Since 5 is a positive constant, I can divide both sides by 5 without changing the inequality sign. That gives:\n\n2x - 11 ≥ 0\n\n"

But the question is asking for the smallest real number x in the domain.\n\nWell, the smallest x would be the lower bound of the domain. Since x must be greater than or equal to 5.5, the smallest possible x is 5.5.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra. Sometimes when dealing with inequalities, it's easy to mess up signs or step over something.\n\nSo, starting again: (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Let me expand both squares to see if I get the same thing.\n\nExpanding (x - 3)^2: x² - 6x + 9\n\nExpanding (x - 8)^2: x² - 16x + 64\n\nSubtracting the second from the first:\n\n(x² - 6x + 9) - (x² - 16x + 64) = x² -6x +9 -x² +16x -64\n\nSimplify:\n\nx² - x² = 0\n-6x +16x = 10x\n9 -64 = -55\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to 10x - 55. So,\n\n10x - 55 ≥ 0\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, 10x ≥ 55, x ≥ 55/10, which is 5.5.\n\nSo, same result. Hmm, okay, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5.\n\nWait, let me just think about what happens at x = 5.5. Plugging back into the original expression inside the square root:\n\n(5.5 - 3)^2 - (5.5 - 8)^2\n\nCalculates as:\n\n(2.5)^2 - (-2.5)^2\n\nWhich is 6.25 - 6.25, which is 0. So, sqrt(0) is 0, which is defined. So, x = 5.5 is indeed included in the domain.\n\nIf x were less than 5.5,"

Therefore, 5.5 is the smallest real number in the domain.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that 5.5 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \\) requires the expression inside the square root to be non-negative.
