Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that since the function involves a square root, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. That means (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 ≥ 0. So, my first step is to solve this inequality to find the domain of g(x).\n\nAlright, let me write that down:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0\n\nI remember that this looks like a difference of squares, which can be factored using the identity a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). So, I can factor the left-hand side.\n\nLet me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). Then:\n\na² - b² = (a - b)(a + b) = [(x - 3) - (x - 8)][(x - 3) + (x - 8)]\n\nSimplifying each part:\n\nFirst, (a - b) = (x - 3 - x + 8) = (5). Because the x terms cancel out: x - x = 0, and -3 + 8 = 5.\n\nNext, (a + b) = (x - 3 + x - 8) = (2x - 11). So, combining like terms: x + x = 2x and -3 -8 = -11.\n\nSo now, the inequality becomes:\n\n(5)(2x - 11) ≥ 0\n\nHmm, that's simpler. So, this is 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0.\n\nSince 5 is a positive constant, I can divide both sides by 5 without changing the inequality direction. So, dividing by 5:\n\n2x - 11 ≥ 0\n\nNow, solving for x:\n\n2x ≥ 11\n\nx ≥ 11/2\n\n11 divided by 2 is 5.5, so x ≥ 5.5.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I factored the difference of squares correctly.

            "output": "2 - (x-8)^2 = [(x-3) - (x-8)][(x-3) + (x-8)]. That gave me (5)(2x -11), which seems right.\n\nThen, setting that product ≥ 0. So, since 5 is positive, the sign of the expression depends on (2x - 11). So, when is (2x -11) ≥ 0? That's when x ≥ 11/2, which is 5.5.\n\nTherefore, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x where x is greater than or equal to 5.5. So, the smallest real number x in this domain would be 5.5, because that's the lower bound.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I made a mistake in factoring? Let me expand both squares and subtract them to see if I get the same thing.\n\nCompute (x - 3)^2 = x² - 6x + 9.\n\nCompute (x - 8)^2 = x² - 16x + 64.\n\nSubtracting the second from the first: (x² -6x +9) - (x² -16x +64) = x² -6x +9 -x² +16x -64 = ( -6x +16x ) + (9 -64 ) = 10x -55.\n\nSo, (x -3)^2 - (x -8)^2 = 10x -55.\n\nSo, if I set 10x -55 ≥ 0, that gives 10x ≥ 55 => x ≥ 55/10 => x ≥ 5.5. Okay, same result. That confirms my earlier solution.\n\nSo, the domain is x ≥ 5.5, so the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5, which is 11/2.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me just think about what happens at x =5.5. Plugging into the original expression:\n\nsqrt{(5.5 -3)^2 - (5.5 -8)^2}\n\nCompute each term:\n\n5.5 -3 = 2.5, so squared is 6.25.\n\n5.5 -8 = -2.5, squared is also 6.25.\n\nSo, 6.25 -6"

So, it's defined at x=5.5, so 5.5 is included in the domain, which is correct.\n\nIf I try x less than 5.5, say x=5:\n\nsqrt{(5-3)^2 - (5-8)^2} = sqrt{4 - 9} = sqrt{-5}, which is not real. So, x=5 is not in the domain, which confirms that 5.5 is indeed the smallest x.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the smallest real number in the domain is 11/2 or 5.5.\n\nI think that's it.
