Moving down, 6^4 (1296) is also too large. Next, 6^3 (216) is much smaller than 999.\n\nAfter determining the highest power, I'll divide 999 by 216 to find how many sixes fit into it. This gives me 4 with a remainder.\n\nNext, I'll take the remainder from the first division and divide it by 6^2 (36). This results in 27 with another remainder.\n\nTaking the new remainder and dividing by 6^1 (6) gives me 27, but since 6^1 is 6, this means there are 27 sixes in the next place.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the last remainder by 6^0 (1) to get the final digit.\n\nPutting all the digits together in the order they were determined, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 3445.\n</think>\n\nLet's convert the decimal number **999** to base **6** using a step-by-step process.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Place Values in Base 6\nIn base **6**, each digit represents a power of **6**. The places are as follows:\n- \\(6^0 = 1\\) (units place)\n- \\(6^1 = 6\\) (sixes place)\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\) (thirty-sixes place)\n- \\(6^3 = 216\\) (two-hundred-sixteens place)\n- \\(6^4 = 1296\\) (thirteen-hundred-ninety-sixes place)\n\nSince **999** is less than **1296** (\\(6^4\\)), we'll use the first four places: \\(6^3\\), \\(6^2\\), \\(6^1\\), and \\(6^0\\).\n\n### Step 2: Divide by the Highest Power of 6 Less Than the Number\nThe highest power of **6** less than **999** is \\(6^3 = 216\\).\n\n- **999 ÷ 216 = 4** with a remainder of **999 - (4 × 216"
