            "output": "To find the base six equivalent of the decimal number 999, I will start by expressing 999 in terms of powers of 6.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the largest power of 6 that fits into 999. Calculating the powers of 6:\n\n6^0 = 1\n\n6^1 = 6\n\n6^2 = 36\n\n6^3 = 216\n\n6^4 = 1296\n\nSince 6^4 equals 1296, which is larger than 999, I will use 6^3 = 216 as the highest power.\n\nNext, I will determine how many times 216 fits into 999. Dividing 999 by 216 gives approximately 4.63. Since I can only use whole numbers, I will take the integer part, which is 4.\n\nNow, I will subtract 4 times 216 from 999 to find the remaining value. 4 * 216 = 864. Subtracting this from 999 leaves 135.\n\nMoving to the next lower power of 6, which is 6^2 = 36. I'll divide 135 by 36 to get approximately 3.75. Taking the integer part, I have 3.\n\nSubtracting 3 times 36 from 135 gives 27. This means there are 3 units of 36 remaining.\n\nNext, I'll use 6^1 = 6. Dividing 27 by 6 results in 4.5. Taking the integer part, that's 4.\n\nSubtracting 4 times 6 from 27 leaves 3. So, there are 3 units of 6 remaining.\n\nFinally, I'll address the remaining value with 6^0 = 1. Subtracting 3 * 1 from 3 leaves 0.\n\nCombining all these coefficients, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 4*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6 + 3, which simplifies to 4433 base six.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\), we can convert it by expressing \\( 999 \\) in terms of powers of \\( 6 \\).\n\nHere are the step-by-step calculations:\n\n1. **Determine the highest power of six that fits into \\( 999 \\):**\n   - \\( 6^0"
