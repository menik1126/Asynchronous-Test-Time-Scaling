I remember that sometimes when you have equations with cubes, you can simplify them by expanding or maybe factor them somehow. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation clearly:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHmm, maybe I can start by letting some substitution make this easier. I notice that 2x - 10 is similar to twice (x - 5). Let me check that: 2*(x - 5) = 2x - 10. Oh, that's exactly the right-hand side of the equation. So maybe I can let u = x - 5. Let's try that substitution.\n\nLet u = x - 5. Then, x = u + 5.\n\nSo, substituting into the left-hand side:\n\n(x - 3)^3 becomes (u + 5 - 3)^3 = (u + 2)^3.\n\nSimilarly, (x - 7)^3 becomes (u + 5 - 7)^3 = (u - 2)^3.\n\nAnd the right-hand side becomes (2x - 10)^3 = (2(u + 5) - 10)^3 = (2u + 10 - 10)^3 = (2u)^3.\n\nSo, after substitution, the equation becomes:\n\n(u + 2)^3 + (u - 2)^3 = (2u)^3.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit simpler. Let me expand the left-hand side.\n\nExpanding (u + 2)^3: using the binomial expansion,\n\n= u^3 + 3u^2*2 + 3u*2^2 + 2^3\n= u^3 + 6u^2 + 12u + 8.\n\nSimilarly, expanding (u - 2)^3:\n\n= u^3 - 3u^2*2 + 3u*2^2 - 2^3\n= u^3 - 6u^2 + 12u - 8.\n\nNow, adding these two results together:\n\n(u^"

Let's see, both terms have a -6u and 24u. Wait, actually, let me factor out -6u:\n\n-6u(u^2 - 4) = 0.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me factor:\n\n-6u^3 + 24u = 0.\n\nFactor out -6u: -6u(u^2 - 4) = 0. Hmm, but let me check:\n\n-6u*(u^2) = -6u^3,\n\n-6u*(-4) = +24u. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the equation becomes -6u(u^2 - 4) = 0.\n\nAlternatively, I can factor this as:\n\n-6u(u - 2)(u + 2) = 0.\n\nWait, because (u^2 - 4) factors into (u - 2)(u + 2). So yeah:\n\n-6u(u - 2)(u + 2) = 0.\n\nSo, setting each factor equal to zero:\n\n-6u = 0 ⇒ u = 0,\n\n(u - 2) = 0 ⇒ u = 2,\n\n(u + 2) = 0 ⇒ u = -2.\n\nThus, the solutions for u are u = 0, u = 2, u = -2.\n\nNow, since u"

But wait, the original equation is a cubic, so there should be three roots, and we have three solutions. That seems right.\n\nWait a second, but I started with substituting u = x - 5. Let me just make sure I didn't introduce any extraneous solutions. Hmm, since substitution is a linear transformation, it shouldn't introduce any extraneous solutions; it's just a change of variable.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this without substitution. Let me try that to see if I get the same result.\n\nOriginal equation: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nI can try expanding both sides.\n\nFirst, expand (x - 3)^3:\n\n"
