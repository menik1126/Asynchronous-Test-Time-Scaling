            "output": "Okay, so I've come across this algebra problem, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The equation is (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it will make more sense.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with equations involving cubes, sometimes expanding them can help. But expanding both sides might get complicated because it's a cubic equation. Wait, is there a smarter way to approach this? Maybe I can simplify the equation by making a substitution or noticing some pattern.\n\nLet me see... Looking at the left side, there are two terms: (x - 3)^3 and (x - 7)^3. On the right side, there's (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, I notice that 2x - 10 is actually 2*(x - 5). So, the right side can be written as [2*(x - 5)]^3, which is 8*(x - 5)^3. That seems interesting because both the left and right sides involve cubes of linear expressions.\n\nSo, maybe I can rewrite the equation as (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8*(x - 5)^3. That might be helpful because now all terms are in terms of (x - a) where a is different constants. Let me write that down:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8*(x - 5)^3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can set y = x - 5 to simplify things. Let me try that substitution. If I let y = x - 5, then:\n\nx - 3 = y + 2,\nx - 7 = y - 2,\nand 2x - 10 = 2*(x - 5) = 2y.\n\nSo substituting back into the equation, I get:\n\n(y + 2)^3 + (y - 2)^3 = (2y)^3.\n\nThat seems much cleaner! Now, I can expand the left side and see if it simplifies into the right side.\n\nExpanding (y + 2)^3: using the binomial expansion, that's y^3 + 3*y^2"

Let's see, both terms have a factor of -6y? Wait, actually, 24y is positive. Let me check again:\n\nWait, 2y^3 -8y^3 is -6y^3, yes, and then +24y. So the equation is -6y^3 +24y =0.\n\nAlternatively, factor out a common term. Let's factor out -6y:\n\n-6y(y^2 -4) =0.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n-6y^3 +24y = -6y^3 +24y = -6y(y^2 -4) ?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n-6y*(y^2) = -6y^3,\n\n-6y*(-4) = +24y. Yes, that's correct.

So x=5,7,3. All check out when plugged in.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=3,5,7.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original equation is a cubic equation. Let me see the degree of the equation. Let me think: expanding all terms, the left side is two cubics, so when combined, the highest degree term would be 2x^3, and the right side is (2x)^3 =8x^3. So when moving everything to one side, the equation would be 2x^3 + ... -8x^3 = -6x^3 + ... So the equation is a cubic, so degree 3, so up to three roots, which we have. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x=3,5,7. So that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says \"Find the roots\", so maybe"

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my substitution.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me think if there's another way to see this. The original equation is (x -3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x -10)^3.\n\nI can write 2x -10 as 2(x -5), so that's 2*(x -5), so the right side is [2(x -5)]^3.\n\nOn the left, perhaps I can see if (x -3) and (x -7) can be represented as (a) and (b) such that a + b = something.\n\nWait, (x -3) + (x -7) = 2x -10, which is exactly what's on the right side. So let me let a = x -3 and b = x -7.\n\nThen, a + b = (2x -10), which is the base of the cube on the right side.\n\nThen, the original equation is a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3. But in this case, (a + b)^3 is 8*(x -5)^3, which is double of a^3 + b^3. Wait, but in general, a^3 + b^3 can be written as (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b). So perhaps I can write:\n\na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3.\n\nWait, in this problem, but wait the right side is (a + b)^3.\n\nBut according to the formula, a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b).\n\nThus, substituting into the equation:\n\n(a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b) = (a + b)^3.\n\nSubtracting (a + b)^3 from both sides:\n\n-3ab(a + b) =0.\n\nSo either ab=0 or a + b=0.\n\nBut since a + b =2x -10, so if a + b =0, then 2x -10=0 →x=5.\n\nAlternatively, if ab=0, then either a=0 or b=0.\n\nIf a=0 →x -3=0 →x=3.\n\nIf b=0 →"

So the answer is those three numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other solutions. Since the equation reduces to -3ab(a + b)=0, so the solutions are when either a=0, b=0, or a + b=0. So that's exactly the three solutions. So that's all the roots. Since the equation is cubic, and we have three roots, so that's all of them.\n\nTherefore, the roots are 3,5,7.
