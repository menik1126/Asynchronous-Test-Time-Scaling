            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about bus riders at Central H.S., and I need to figure out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. There's a table with four grades: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. For each grade, the percentage of males and females who are bus riders is given. The survey included 300 males and 300 females in each grade. So, that means for each grade, there are a total of 600 students surveyed\u2014300 males and 300 females.\n\nNow, the question is asking for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. So, I need to calculate, for each grade, the number of male bus riders (which is 300 multiplied by the percentage given for males in that grade) and the number of female bus riders (similarly, 300 multiplied by the percentage for females). Then, I need to see how many times the male number is 135% of the female number. Whichever grade is closest will be the answer.\n\nLet me write down the formula for each grade. For each grade, let\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( M = \\) percentage of males who are bus riders\n- \\( F = \\) percentage of females who are bus riders\n\nThe number of male bus riders is \\( 300 \\times M \\) and the number of female bus riders is \\( 300 \\times F \\). We need \\( 300 \\times M = 1.35 \\times (300 \\times F) \\). \n\nSimplifying that equation, it becomes \\( M = 1.35 \\times F \\). So, we need to find which grade has the male percentage closest to 1.35 times the female percentage.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the ratio \\( \\frac{M}{F} \\) for each grade and see which one is closest to 1.35.\n\nLet me go grade by grade.\n\nStarting with the 9th grade:\n\n- Male percentage = 41.1%\n- Female percentage = 39.4%\n\nCalculate the ratio: \\( \\frac{41.1}{39.4} \\). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 39.4 multiplied by "

Alternatively, I can do the division directly.\n\n41.1 \u00f7 39.4 \u2248 1.042. So, approximately 1.042.\n\nWe are looking for a ratio close to 1.35, which is quite a bit higher. 1.042 is much less than 1.35, so 9th grade isn't the one.\n\nNext, 10th grade:\n\n- Male percentage = 34.4%\n- Female percentage = 33.1%\n\nCompute the ratio: 34.4 / 33.1 \u2248 ?\n\n33.1 * 1 = 33.1, and 34.4 is 1.038 times 33.1, because 33.1 * 1.04 = 34.444, which is about 34.4. So, it's approximately 1.038. Again, way less than 1.35.\n\nMoving on to 11th grade:\n\n- Male percentage = 20.6%\n- Female percentage = 13.8%\n\nCompute the ratio: 20.6 / 13.8 \u2248 ?\n\n13.8 goes into 20.6 a bit over 1.48 times. Let me compute 13.8 * 1.48: 13 * 1.48 = 19.24, and 0.8 * 1.48 = 1.184, so total is 19.24 + 1.184 = 20.424. That's about 20.424, which is close to 20.6. So, approximately 1.48. Still, 1.48 is less than 1.35? Wait, no, 1.48 is higher than 1.35.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 11th grade has a ratio of approximately 1.48, while we are looking for 1.35. So, 1.48 is a bit higher than 1.35. So, how close is it?\n\nWait, let me think: 1.35 is what we need, and 1.48 is the ratio for 11th grade. The difference is 1."

Wait, that's interesting. Let me compute 8.6 * 1.35:\n\n8 * 1.35 = 10.8, and 0.6 * 1.35 = 0.81, so total is 10.8 + 0.81 = 11.61. So, 8.6 * 1.35 = 11.61, which is almost exactly the male percentage of 11.6. So, the ratio here is 11.6 / 8.6 \u2248 1.3488, which is approximately 1.3488, very close to 1.35.\n\nWait, so 12th grade's ratio is about 1.3488, which is just 0.0012 less than 1.35. That's extremely close. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me compute 11.6 divided by 8.6 precisely.\n\n11.6 \u00f7 8.6. Let's do this division:\n\n8.6 goes into 11.6 once, with a remainder of 3.0. \n\nSo, 1.0 times 8.6 is 8.6, subtract that from 11.6, you get 3.0. Bring down a decimal, add a zero: 30 divided by 8.6. \n\n8.6 goes into 30 three times (3*8.6=25.8). Subtract 25.8 from 30, get 4.2. Bring down another zero: 42 divided by 8.6. \n\n8.6 goes into 42 four times (4*8.6=34.4). Subtract 34.4 from 42, get 7.6. Bring down another zero: 76 divided by 8.6."

Hmm, this is starting to repeat. \n\nSo, from 11.6 /8.6, we have 1.3488 approximately. So, yes, very close to 1.35.\n\nSo, let's recap the ratios:\n\n- 9th grade: ~1.042\n- 10th grade: ~1.038\n- 11th grade: ~1.48\n- 12th grade: ~1.3488\n\nWe're looking for the ratio closest to 1.35.

So, let me double-check the calculation for each grade.\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n\nMales: 41.1%, so 41.1 / 39.4. Let me compute 39.4 * 1.35: 39.4 * 1 = 39.4, 39.4 * 0.35 = approx 13.79, so total 39.4 +13.79=53.19. But males are 41.1, which is much less than 53.19, so 41.1 /39.4= ~1.042, which is less than 1.35. So, 9th grade is not.\n\n10th grade:\n\n34.4 /33.1: 33.1*1=33.1, 33.1*1.04=34.444, so 34.4 is slightly less, so ratio is ~1.038, which is less than 1.35.\n\n11th grade:\n\n20.6 /13.8.

So, does that mean M=1.35F? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, the question says: \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders.\"\n\nSo, 135% of female: 1.35F. So, we have M \u22481.35F.\n\nThus, the ratio M/F should be approximately 1.35.\n\nSo, yes, if ratio is 1.35, that's exactly what we need. So, 12th grade has ratio ~1.3488, which is 1.35, so that's the closest.\n\nWait, but to confirm, what's the percentage difference? Let me see:\n\nFor 12th grade:\n\nM/F =1.3488, which is 1.35*(12th grade's ratio). So, 1.3488 is 0.13% less than 1.35. So, the percentage is 0.13% less than 1.35.\n\nFor 11th grade:\n\nM/F=1.48, which is 0.13 more than 1.35.\n\nSo, both 11th and 12th grades are approximately 0.13% away from 1.35, just on opposite sides.\n\nBut wait, 12th grade is 1.3488, which is 1.3488, so 1.35 is 1.35, so the difference is 1.35 -1.3488=0.0012, which is 0.12% difference.\n\nOn the other hand, 11th grade is 1.48, which is 1.48-1.35=0.13, which is 13% difference"
