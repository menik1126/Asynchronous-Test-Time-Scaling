Similarly, I'll multiply the percentage of female bus riders by 300 to find the number of female students who ride the bus.\n\nOnce I have the actual numbers for each grade, I'll compare the number of male bus riders to 135% of the number of female bus riders. I'll calculate 135% of the female bus riders and see which grade's male bus riders are closest to this value.\n\nFinally, I'll identify the grade where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders and present this finding.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to **135\\%** of the number of female bus riders, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Actual Number of Bus Riders in Each Grade:**\n   - Total students surveyed in each grade: **300 males + 300 females = 600 students**\n\n   - **9th Grade:**\n     - Male bus riders: \\( 41.1\\% \\) of 300 = \\( 0.411 \\times 300 = 123.3 \\)\n     - Female bus riders: \\( 39.4\\% \\) of 300 = \\( 0.394 \\times 300 = 118.2 \\)\n\n   - **10th Grade:**\n     - Male bus riders: \\( 34.4\\% \\) of 300 = \\( 0.344 \\times 300 = 103.2 \\)\n     - Female bus riders: \\( 33.1\\% \\) of 300 = \\( 0.331 \\times 300 = 99.3 \\)\n\n   - **11th Grade:**\n     - Male bus riders: \\( 20.6\\% \\) of 300 = \\( 0.206 \\times 300 = 61.8 \\)\n     - Female bus riders: \\( 13.8\\% \\) of 300 = \\( 0."
