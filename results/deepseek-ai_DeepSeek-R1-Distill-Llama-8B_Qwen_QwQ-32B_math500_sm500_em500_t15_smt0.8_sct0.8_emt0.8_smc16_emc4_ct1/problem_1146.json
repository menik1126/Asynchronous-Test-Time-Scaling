From the first equation, \\(AB = 10\\), so possible integer pairs for \\((A, B)\\) are \\((1, 10)\\), \\((2, 5)\\), \\((5, 2)\\), and \\((10, 1)\\).\n\nI'll test each pair in the second equation:\n- For \\(A = 2\\) and \\(B = 5\\):\n  \\[\n  3(2) - 8(5) = 6 - 40 = -34 \\neq -1\n  \\]\n  This doesn't work.\n  \n- For \\(A = 5\\) and \\(B = 2\\):\n  \\[\n  3(5) - 8(2) = 15 - 16 = -1\n  \\]\n  This satisfies the second equation.\n\nThus, \\(A = 5\\) and \\(B = 2\\).
