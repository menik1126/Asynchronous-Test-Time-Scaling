Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is related to how many times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I think the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factors of 42!.\n\nWait, but I also recall that in factorials, there are usually more 2s than 5s. Because every even number contributes a 2, and 5s are less frequent. So, the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros. That makes sense.\n\nAlright, so how do I count the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!? I think there's a formula for that. Let me try to remember. It's something like dividing 42 by 5, then dividing by 25, 125, and so on until the division results in zero, and then summing up all those quotients.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of 5s = floor(42/5) + floor(42/25) + floor(42/125) + ... until the division by the next power of 5 gives zero.\n\nSo, let's calculate each term step by step.\n\nFirst, 42 divided by 5. 5 goes into 42 eight times because 5*8 is 40, which is less than 42, and 5*9 is 45, which is too big. So, floor(42/5) is 8.\n\nNext, 42 divided by 25. 25 goes into 42 once, because 25*1 is 25, and 25*2 is 50, which is too much. So, floor(42/25) is 1.\n\nThen, 42 divided by 125. Well, 125 is larger than 42, so this will be zero. So, floor(42/125) is 0.\n\nSince 5 cubed is 125, and higher powers will only give zero, I can stop here.\n\nNow, adding up all those: 8 + 1 + 0 = 9.\n\nSo, there are 9 fives in the prime factors of 42! That means there are "

            "output": "9 trailing zeros because each 5 pairs with a 2 to make a 10, and there are definitely enough 2s to pair with all the 5s.\n\nWait, just to make sure I did that correctly. Let me recap:\n\n- 42/5 = 8.4, so floor is 8.\n- 42/25 = 1.68, so floor is 1.\n- 42/125 = 0.336, which floors to 0.\n- Higher powers like 625 (5^4) would be way beyond 42, so they won't contribute anything.\n\nAdding them: 8+1=9.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't think I missed any terms. So, 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we count the number of times 10 is a factor in \\(42!\\). Since 10 is \\(2 \\times 5\\), and there are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\).\n\nWe use the formula:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5^k} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\nCalculating each term:\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n- \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0 \\) (and higher powers will also be zero)\n\nSumming these gives \\(8 + 1 + 0 = 9\\).\n\nThus, \\(42!\\) has \\(\\boxed{9}\\) trailing zeros."
