            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many zeros are at the end of 42! (that's 42 factorial). I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is related to how many times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, the number of trailing zeros depends on the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factors of the factorial.\n\nBut wait, I think there's more to it. I remember something about using the formula where you divide the number by 5, then 25, 125, and so on until the division results in a number less than 1. Then you take the floor of each of those results and add them up. That should give the number of trailing zeros. Let me see if I got that right.\n\nYeah, so the number of trailing zeros in n! is given by the sum of n divided by 5, n divided by 25, n divided by 125, and so on, taking the floor each time. So for 42!, I need to do this calculation.\n\nOkay, let's start. First, I divide 42 by 5. 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, but since we take the floor, that becomes 8. So that's 8 trailing zeros from the multiples of 5.\n\nNext, I need to divide 42 by 25. 25 times 1 is 25, 25 times 2 is 50, which is more than 42. So 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, which floors to 1. So that's an extra zero, making it 9 so far.\n\nThen, I go to 125, since the next power of 5 is 125. But 125 is bigger than 42, so 42 divided by 125 is less than 1. Taking the floor of that gives 0. So we can stop here because higher powers of 5 will also result in 0.\n\nNow, adding up the number of times 5 appears in the factors: 8 (from 5s) + 1 (from 25s) = 9. Since there are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a"

            "output": " mistake. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFirst step: 42 divided by 5. 5 times 8 is 40, so there are 8 multiples of 5 between 1 and 42. Each contributes at least one 5. Then, numbers like 25, which is 5 squared, contribute an extra 5. So how many numbers between 1 and 42 are multiples of 25? 25 and 50, but 50 is over 42, so only 25. That's one more 5. So that's why we add 1. Then 125 is too big, so no more. So total is 8 +1 =9.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 9? Let me think if there's another way to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 5s and 2s explicitly. Let's see. The number of 2s in 42! would be floor(42/2) + floor(42/4) + floor(42/8) + floor(42/16) + floor(42/32) + ... \n\nCalculating that:\n\nfloor(42/2) =21\n\nfloor(42/4)=10\n\nfloor(42/8)=5\n\nfloor(42/16)=2\n\nfloor(42/32)=1\n\nfloor(42/64)=0, so we can stop here.\n\nAdding those up: 21+10=31, 31+5=36, 36+2=38, 38+1=39. So there are 39 factors of 2 in 42!.\n\nFor the 5s, as before, it's floor(42/5)=8, floor(42/25)=1, floor(42/125)=0. So total 9 factors of 5.\n\nSince each trailing zero requires a 2 and a 5, the number of pairs is the minimum of 39 and 9, which is 9. So that confirms it. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is 9.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check with a smaller factorial. Let's"

            "output": " say 25!. Using the same method:\n\nNumber of 5s: floor(25/5)=5, floor(25/25)=1, floor(25/125)=0. So 5+1=6.\n\nNumber of 2s: floor(25/2)=12, floor(25/4)=6, floor(25/8)=3, floor(25/16)=1, floor(25/32)=0. So 12+6=18+3=21+1=22.\n\nSince there are 6 5s and 22 2s, the number of trailing zeros would be 6. And 25! is 15511210043330985984000000, which indeed ends with 6 zeros. So my method works.\n\nTherefore, applying it to 42! gives 9 trailing zeros.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in \\(42!\\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we count the number of pairs of these factors. The number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42, as there are usually more factors of 2 than 5.\n\nWe use the formula where we divide 42 by 5, 25, 125, etc., and take the floor of each result, then sum them up.\n\n1. Divide 42 by 5: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\\)\n2. Divide 42 by 25: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1\\)\n3. Divide 42 by 125: \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0\\) (since 125 is larger than 42)\n\nAdding these results gives the total number of factors of 5: \\(8 + 1 = 9\\).\n\nThus, the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."
