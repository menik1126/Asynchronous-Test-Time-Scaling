Hmm, I've heard that to rationalize the denominator, you usually multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) would be \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\), right? Let me try that.\n\nSo, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}\n\\]\n\nAlright, now let me compute the denominator first. Using the difference of squares formula, \\((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\\).\n\nSo, the denominator becomes:\n\n\\[\n(2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\\]\n\nThat's nice, the denominator is 1. Now, the numerator is a bit more complicated. Let me expand that:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) = 1 \\times 2 + 1 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) + \\sqrt{2} \\times 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\nBreaking it down term by term:\n\n- \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\)\n- \\(1 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 2 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}}{1} = 2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2"

Let's reorganize my current expression.\n\nLooking at \\(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\\), I can group the constants and the radicals separately.\n\nFirst, the constant term is 2. Then, I have two radicals: \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\), and another radical \\(-\\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nWait, the form is \\(A(1 + \\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D})\\). So, that suggests that I need to have a term that's a multiple of \\(1 + \\sqrt{B}\\), and then subtract another expression which is a sum of square roots.\n\nIn my current expression, the constant is 2, which is just 2 times 1. So maybe A is 2, and then 2\\sqrt{2} would correspond to the \\(\\sqrt{B}\\) term. So if A is 2, then \\(A(1 + \\sqrt{B}) = 2(1 + \\sqrt{B}) = 2 + 2\\sqrt{B}\\). So, to get 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}, B must be 2.\n\nThen, the negative terms are \\(-\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\), so that would be \\(-(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\), meaning C is 3 and D is 6.\n\nPutting it all together, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\nSo, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, and D is 6. Therefore, A + B + C + D equals 2 + 2 + 3 + 6. Wait, that adds up to 13.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I multiplied numerator and denominator by the conjugate, got denominator 1, expanded the numerator correctly, grouped the terms, and then matched it with the"

            "output": " given form. The key was to see that the 2 and the 2√2 can be expressed as 2(1 + √2), and then the remaining terms are the negatives of √3 and √6. That seems right. So the final answer should be 2+2+3+6=13. Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, let me verify the original expression again. The problem says \"Your solution can be converted to the form A(1+√B) - (√C + √D)\". So in my case, 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). So yes, A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6. So adding them gives 2+2+3+6=13. Hmm, but let me check if there's another way to arrange terms that might give different numbers. For example, maybe I can factor something else?\n\nAlternatively, suppose I tried to write the expression differently. Let me see:\n\nOriginal simplified expression: 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\nSuppose I group 2 + 2√2 as 2(1 + √2), then the rest is -√3 - √6, so that's exactly what I did before. Alternatively, if I tried to group differently, like 2 - √6 and then the rest, but that might not fit the form. Since the form requires A(1 + √B) minus the sum of two square roots, so the first part must be a multiple of (1 + sqrt something). The only way to get the 2 and the 2√2 is to have A=2 and B=2. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 13.\n\nWait, but let me check the arithmetic again. 2+2 is 4, plus 3 is 7, plus 6 is 13. Yeah, that's right. Hmm, okay, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\"
