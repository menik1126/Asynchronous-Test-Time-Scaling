Let me write it down step by step to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe expression is: √[( (5/√80) + (√845/9) + √45 ) / √5]\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down. Let me start by simplifying the numerator inside the square root. There are three terms in the numerator: 5/√80, √845/9, and √45. I need to simplify each of these individually.\n\nStarting with 5/√80. I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually how we leave expressions, so maybe I can rationalize the denominator. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and denominator by √80. So, 5/√80 times √80/√80 would give me (5√80)/(80). Simplifying that, 80 divided by 5 is 16, so it's √16 times 5. Wait, no, actually, √80 can be simplified further. Let me do that first before rationalizing.\n\n√80. Well, 80 is 16 times 5, right? So √80 = √(16×5) = √16 × √5 = 4√5. So 5/√80 is the same as 5/(4√5). Now, rationalizing that denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by √5: (5√5)/(4×5) = √5/4. Okay, so 5/√80 simplifies to √5/4.\n\nNext term: √845/9. Let me see if I can simplify √845. 845, let me try to factor that. 845 divided by 5 is 169, which is 13 squared. So, 845 = 5 × 13². So √845 = √(5×13²) = √(13²) × √5 = 13√5. So √845 is 13√5, making the term (13√5)/9.\n\nThird term: √45. Again, let's simplify that. 45 is 9×5, so √45 = √(9×5) = √9 × √5 = 3√5.\n\nSo now, the"

            "output": " numerator inside the square root is: √5/4 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5. All the terms have √5, so maybe I can factor that out to simplify.\n\nLet me write each term as a multiple of √5:\n\nFirst term: √5/4 = (1/4)√5\n\nSecond term: (13√5)/9 = (13/9)√5\n\nThird term: 3√5 = (3)√5\n\nSo the numerator is [(1/4) + (13/9) + 3] √5.\n\nNow, let me compute the coefficients: 1/4 + 13/9 + 3.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 can be written as 3/1). The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. So, I'll convert each fraction:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = 52/36\n\n3/1 = 108/36\n\nAdding them up: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169. So, the coefficients add up to 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is (169/36)√5.\n\nNow, the entire expression inside the square root is that numerator divided by √5. So, it's (169/36 √5) / √5.\n\nLet me write that as (169/36 √5) × (1/√5). The √5 in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, leaving just 169/36.\n\nSo now, we have √(169/36). Let me compute that. The square root of 169 is 13, and the square root of 36 is 6. So, √(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nWait, let me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 5/√80: yes, √80 is 4√5, so 5/(4√5) becomes √5/4 after rationalizing. Correct.\n\n√845: 845 is 5×169, which is 5×13², so √845 is 13√5. Correct.\n\n√45 is 3√5"

So together, that's about 4.694, which is roughly 169/36 (since 36×4=144, 36×4.694≈169). So that seems right.\n\nThen, 169/36 √5 divided by √5 is indeed 169/36. Square root of that is 13/6.
