            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of (5 divided by the square root of 80 plus sqrt(845) over 9 plus sqrt(45), all divided by sqrt(5)). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at each part of the numerator inside the square root separately. The numerator is 5/sqrt(80) + sqrt(845)/9 + sqrt(45). Let me handle each term one by one.\n\nStarting with 5/sqrt(80). I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually simplified, so maybe I can rationalize the denominator here. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and denominator by sqrt(80). That would give me (5*sqrt(80)) / 80. Let me compute sqrt(80). Well, 80 is 16 times 5, so sqrt(16*5) is 4*sqrt(5). So substituting back, it's (5*4*sqrt(5))/80. Simplifying the numbers, 5*4 is 20, and 80 divided by 20 is 4. So that term simplifies to (20/80)*sqrt(5), which is (1/4)*sqrt(5). Wait, actually, let me double-check that. 5*sqrt(80) is 5*4*sqrt(5) which is 20*sqrt(5). Then divide by 80: 20/80 is 1/4, so yeah, it's sqrt(5)/4. Okay, so 5/sqrt(80) simplifies to sqrt(5)/4.\n\nNext term is sqrt(845)/9. I can try to simplify sqrt(845). Let's see, 845 divided by 5 is 169, right? Because 5*169 is 845. And 169 is 13 squared. So sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*13^2), which is sqrt(5)*13, so that's 13*sqrt(5). Therefore, the term becomes 13*sqrt(5)/9. Got it.\n\nThird term is sqrt(45). Let's factor 45: that's 9*5, and 9 is a perfect square. So sqrt(45) is"

            "output": " sqrt(9*5) which is 3*sqrt(5). So that term is 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo now, putting it all together, the numerator inside the square root is sqrt(5)/4 + 13*sqrt(5)/9 + 3*sqrt(5). Since all the terms have sqrt(5), I can factor that out. So, sqrt(5) times [1/4 + 13/9 + 3]. Let me compute the stuff inside the brackets.\n\nFirst, I need to find a common denominator for 1/4, 13/9, and 3. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 is 3/1). The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36, so I'll convert each fraction to have 36 as the denominator.\n\n1/4 is 9/36.\n\n13/9 is (13*4)/36 = 52/36.\n\n3 is 108/36.\n\nAdding those together: 9 + 52 + 108 is... 9+52 is 61, and 61+108 is 169. So 169/36. Therefore, the numerator inside the square root is sqrt(5)*(169/36) which is (169*sqrt(5))/36.\n\nSo now, the entire expression is the square root of this numerator divided by sqrt(5). So, sqrt[(169*sqrt(5)/36)/sqrt(5)]. Let me write that as sqrt[(169*sqrt(5))/(36*sqrt(5))].\n\nWait, let me think. The numerator is (169*sqrt(5))/36, and we divide that by sqrt(5). So that's the same as multiplying (169*sqrt(5))/36 by 1/sqrt(5). So sqrt[(169*sqrt(5))/(36*sqrt(5))].\n\nHmm, sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(a)/sqrt(b), so I can write sqrt(169*sqrt(5)/ (36*sqrt(5))).\n\nSimplify the expression inside the square root: sqrt(5) in numerator and denominator will cancel out, so we get sqrt(169/36).\n\nsqrt(169) is 13, sqrt(36) is 6. So sqrt(169/36) is 13/6.\n\nWait, that seems"

Let me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting from the beginning: sqrt[(5/sqrt(80) + sqrt(845)/9 + sqrt(45)) / sqrt(5)]\n\nConvert each term:\n\n5/sqrt(80): sqrt(80) is 4*sqrt(5), so 5/(4*sqrt(5)) = (5*sqrt(5))/(4*5) = sqrt(5)/4. Correct.\n\nsqrt(845) is 13*sqrt(5), so that's 13*sqrt(5)/9. Correct.\n\nsqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5). Correct.\n\nAdding them up: sqrt(5)/4 + 13*sqrt(5)/9 + 3*sqrt(5). Factoring sqrt(5): [1/4 + 13/9 + 3]. Convert to 36 denominator: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = 169/36. So numerator inside sqrt is 169*sqrt(5)/36.\n\nThen, divide by sqrt(5): (169*sqrt(5)/36)/sqrt(5) = 169/(36). So we have sqrt(169/36) = 13/6. So yes, correct.\n\nWait, that seems fine. So the final answer is 13/6.\n\nHmm, let me just recap:\n\n1. Simplify each term in the numerator:\n   - 5/sqrt(80) = sqrt(5)/4\n   - sqrt(845) =13 sqrt(5); divided by 9: 13 sqrt(5)/9\n   - sqrt(45)=3 sqrt(5)\n\n2.
