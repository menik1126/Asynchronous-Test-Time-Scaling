The complex numbers are given as z = 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i and c = 2 - 3i. I need to find the resulting complex number w after this rotation. \n\nHmm, let me recall how to rotate a point around another point in the complex plane. If I have a point z and I want to rotate it around a center c by an angle θ, the formula is something like w = c + (z - c) * e^(iθ). Yeah, that sounds right. So I need to translate z so that c is at the origin, rotate it, and then translate it back.\n\nFirst, I need to compute z - c. Let me write down the values:\n\nz = 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i\nc = 2 - 3i\n\nSo z - c would be (2 + sqrt(2) - 3 - 3 sqrt(2)) + (-3 - 3 sqrt(2) + 3)i. Let me compute the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\nReal part: 2 + sqrt(2) - 3 - 3 sqrt(2) = (2 - 3) + (sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2)) = (-1) + (-2 sqrt(2)) = -1 - 2 sqrt(2)\n\nImaginary part: -3 - 3 sqrt(2) + 3 = (-3 + 3) - 3 sqrt(2) = 0 - 3 sqrt(2) = -3 sqrt(2)\n\nSo z - c = (-1 - 2 sqrt(2)) + (-3 sqrt(2))i\n\nNow, I need to multiply this by e^(iπ/4). The complex exponential e^(iθ) can be written as cosθ + i sinθ. For θ = π/4, cos(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, e^(iπ/4) = sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2\n\nSo now, I need to compute (-"
