The area is π multiplied by the radius squared, so that's 49π.\n\nNext, I'll find the area of the middle circle with a radius of 6. This area is π times 36, resulting in 36π.\n\nThen, I'll compute the area of the smallest circle, which has a radius of 4. Its area is π multiplied by 16, giving 16π.\n\nAfter obtaining the areas of all three circles, I'll determine the areas of the regions between them. The area of region Y is the area of the middle circle minus the smallest circle, which is 36π - 16π = 20π.\n\nSimilarly, the area of region X is the area of the largest circle minus the middle circle, which equals 49π - 36π = 13π.\n\nFinally, the area of region Z, located between the largest and middle circles, is the same as region Y, so it's also 20π.\n\nNow, I'll compare the areas of all regions to identify which has the greatest and smallest areas. The largest area is 20π (regions Y and Z), and the smallest area is 13π (region X).\n\nThe difference between the greatest and smallest areas is 20π - 13π, which equals 7π.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's analyze the areas step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the area of each circle**\n- **Largest circle (Radius = 7):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times (7)^2 = 49\\pi\n  \\]\n- **Middle circle (Radius = 6):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times (6)^2 = 36\\pi\n  \\]\n- **Smallest circle (Radius = 4):**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times (4)^2 = 16\\pi\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the areas of regions X, Y, and Z**\n- **Region Z (Between radius 7 and 6):**\n  \\[\n"

I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, the regions are labeled as follows:\n- The innermost circle (radius 4) is labeled X.\n- The middle ring (between 4 and 6) is labeled Y.\n- The outermost ring (between 6 and 7) is labeled Z.\n\nWait, in my previous step, I assigned Region Z as between 7 and 6, which is correct, but the problem says the regions are labeled X, Y, or Z. The Asymptote code shows:\n- label(\"$X$\",(2,0)) which is inside the smallest circle (radius 4),\n- label(\"$Y$\",(5,0)) which is between 4 and 6,\n- label(\"$Z$\",(6.5,0)) which is between 6 and 7.\n\nTherefore, the areas are:\n- X: 16π (smallest circle)\n- Y: 36π - 16π = 20π (middle ring)\n- Z: 49π - 36π = 13π (outer ring)\n\nSo the largest area is Y (20π), and the smallest is Z (13π).

Therefore, the difference is 20π - 16π = 4π.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought of the areas as:\n- X: 16π\n- Y: 20π\n- Z: 13π\n\nSo the greatest area is Y (20π), the smallest is X (16π). Therefore, the difference is 20π - 16π = 4π.\n\nBut the problem says three regions, which are X, Y, Z. So maybe I got confused with the labels. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking back, the Asymptote code labels:\n- X is in the innermost circle (radius 4)\n- Y is the middle ring (4 to 6)\n- Z is the outer ring (6 to 7)\n\nTherefore, the areas are:\n- X: 16π\n- Y: 36π - 16π = 20π\n- Z: 49π - 36π = 13π\n\nSo the largest area is Y (20π), the smallest is X (16π). The difference is 20π - 16π = 4π.\n\nBut in the initial Asymptote code, the areas seem to be:\n- X is the innermost, which is 16π\n- Y is between 4 and 6: 36π - 16π = 20π\n- Z is between 6 and 7: 49π - 36π = 13π\n\nTherefore, the regions have areas: X=16π, Y=20π, Z=13π.\n\nSo the largest area is Y=20π, the smallest is X=16π, or is X the innermost?\n\nWait, no. If the labels are X, Y, Z, corresponding to innermost, middle, outer.\n\nX: 16π\nY: 20π\nZ: 13π\n\nSo the largest is Y (20π), smallest is Z (13π). Therefore, the difference is 20π - 13π = 7π.\n\nWait, but that would mean the difference between the largest (Y) and smallest (Z) is 7π.\n\nAlternatively"

Let me check the Asymptote code again.\n\nThe Asymptote code says:\n\nlabel(\"$X$\",(2,0)); // at (2,0), which is inside the smallest circle (radius 4)\nlabel(\"$Y$\",(5,0)); // at (5,0), between 4 and 6\nlabel(\"$Z$\",(6.5,0)); // at (6.5,0), between 6 and 7.\n\nTherefore, the regions are:\n\n- X: innermost circle (radius 4): area 16π\n- Y: middle ring (4-6): area 20π\n- Z: outer ring (6-7): area 13π\n\nThus, the largest area is Y (20π), the smallest is Z (13π). The difference between the largest and smallest is 20π - 13π = 7π.\n\nWait, so my initial calculation was correct, but in my first step-by-step I had a miscalculation in the labels. The problem says \"the three concentric circles have radii of 4,6,7\" and the regions are labeled X,Y,Z. The Asymptote code shows the labels at (2,0), (5,0), (6.5,0). So the regions are:\n\n- X is the innermost circle (radius 4)\n- Y is the annulus between 4 and 6\n- Z is the annulus between 6 and 7\n\nTherefore, the areas are:\n\nX: 16π\n\nY: 36π - 16π = 20π\n\nZ: 49π - 36π = 13π\n\nThus, the largest area is Y (20π), the smallest is Z (13π). The difference is 20π - 13π = 7π.\n\nWait, but in my first step-by-step, I had a miscalculation where I thought the difference was between Y and X, but actually, the smallest is Z (13π), not X (16π). So the correct difference is 20π -13π =7π.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 7π.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{7\\pi}\n</think>\n\n"
