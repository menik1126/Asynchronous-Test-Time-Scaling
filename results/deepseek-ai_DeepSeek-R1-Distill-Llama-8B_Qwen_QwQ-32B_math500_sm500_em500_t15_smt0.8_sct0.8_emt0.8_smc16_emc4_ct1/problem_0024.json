So, (√2)^8 = 2^(4) = 16.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\[ |(1 - i)^8| \\], we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Complex Number\nWe have the complex number \\( z = 1 - i \\), where:\n- The **real part** is \\( 1 \\).\n- The **imaginary part** is \\( -1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Modulus\nThe **modulus** (or magnitude) of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is given by:\n\\[\n|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\nApplying this to \\( z = 1 - i \\):\n\\[\n|1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Raise to the 8th Power\nWhen raising a complex number to a power, we can raise its modulus to that power. Thus:\n\\[\n|(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
