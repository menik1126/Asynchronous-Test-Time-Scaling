Each pair consists of a positive odd number and the subsequent negative even number.\n\nBy pairing them, the series becomes: (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + ... + (99 - 100).\n\nEach pair simplifies to -1, so there are 50 pairs in total.\n\nFinally, I multiply the number of pairs by -1 to find the final result: 50 * (-1) = -50.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the series \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Series Structure:**\n   \n   The series alternates between subtraction and addition. It consists of 100 terms, with the first term being positive and each subsequent even term being subtracted.\n\n2. **Group the Terms:**\n   \n   To simplify the calculation, group the terms in pairs:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify Each Pair:**\n   \n   Each pair of terms results in \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) = -1,\\quad (3 - 4) = -1,\\quad \\dots,\\quad (99 - 100) = -1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Count the Number of Pairs:**\n   \n   There are \\(100 / 2 = 50\\) pairs in total.\n\n5. **Compute the Final Result:**\n   \n   Multiply the number of pairs by \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   50 \\times (-1) = -50\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
