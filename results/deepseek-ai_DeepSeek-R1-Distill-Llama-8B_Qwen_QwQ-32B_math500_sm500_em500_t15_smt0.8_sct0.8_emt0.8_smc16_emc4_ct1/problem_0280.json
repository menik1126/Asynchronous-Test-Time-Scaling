For example, (1 - 2) = -1 and (3 - 4) = -1, and so on.\n\nThere are a total of 100 numbers in the series. Since the numbers are paired as (1-2), (3-4), ..., (99-100), there are 50 such pairs.\n\nEach pair contributes -1 to the total sum. Therefore, the sum of all pairs is 50 × (-1) = -50.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the series \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**:\n   \n   The series alternates between addition and subtraction of consecutive integers. Each pair of numbers can be grouped as follows:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify Each Pair**:\n   \n   Each pair simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -1 \\quad (\\text{since } 1 - 2 = -1, \\, 3 - 4 = -1, \\, \\text{and so on})\n   \\]\n   \n   Therefore, there are 50 such pairs because there are \\( \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\) pairs in 100 terms.\n\n3. **Compute the Total Sum**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Sum} = 50 \\times (-1) = -50\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{-50}\n   \\]"
