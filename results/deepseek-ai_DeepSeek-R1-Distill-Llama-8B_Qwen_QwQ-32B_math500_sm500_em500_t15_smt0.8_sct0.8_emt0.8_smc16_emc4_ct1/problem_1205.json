The direction vector is given as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\). Hmm, I think direction vectors are used to describe the slope of a line, right? So, if I can figure out the slope of the line from the diagram, I can find 'b'.\n\nThe Asymptote code is provided, but I'm more familiar with looking at graphs rather than code, so maybe I should try to visualize it. From the code, it mentions points A, B, L, and R. Points A and B are given as A = (-5,4) and B = (-1,3). Then, points L and R are the intersections of the line AB with the lines x = -8 and x = 8, respectively. The line is drawn from L to R, which is in red on the graph.\n\nWait, so the line AB is being extended to the left and right until it meets the vertical lines at x = -8 and x = 8. So, the points L and R are on the x-axis, but extended to meet these vertical lines. Hmm, so the line AB has a certain slope, and when I extend it to where x is -8 and 8, those are points on the line.\n\nSo, maybe the direction vector is based on the slope of this line AB. Let me recall that the direction vector of a line with slope 'm' is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ m \\end{pmatrix}\\) or any scalar multiple of that. But in this case, the direction vector is given as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\). So, the slope would be rise over run, which is b divided by -7, right? So, m = b/(-7) = -b/7.\n\nAlternatively, the direction vector could also be scaled, but the key is that the direction vector's components relate directly to the slope. So, if I can find the slope of the line AB, I can set it equal to -b/7 and solve for 'b'.\n\nTo find the slope of line AB, I can use the coordinates of points A and B. Point A is (-5, 4) and point B is (-1"

But according to the direction vector given, the slope should also be equal to b divided by -7. Let me write that equation:\n\nSlope = (b)/(-7) = -b/7.\n\nBut we found the slope is -1/4. Therefore:\n\n- b / 7 = -1/4\n\nHmm, solving for b. Let's see:\n\nMultiply both sides by 7:\n\n- b = (-1/4) * 7\n\n- b = -7/4\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nb = 7/4\n\nWait, so is that the answer? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction vector. The direction vector is given as (-7, b). The direction vector can be found from points A to B. Let's see, the vector from A to B is (B - A) = (-1 - (-5), 3 - 4) = (4, -1). So the direction vector is (4, -1). But the problem states that the direction vector is of the form (-7, b). So, these vectors must be scalar multiples of each other.\n\nSo, if (4, -1) is a direction vector, then any scalar multiple of that is also a direction vector. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n(4, -1) = k*(-7, b)\n\nWhich would mean:\n\n4 = -7k\n\nand\n\n-1 = b*k\n\nSolving for k from the first equation: k = 4 / (-7) = -4/7\n\nThen plug into the second equation:\n\n-1 = b*(-4/7)\n\nMultiply both sides by (-7/4):\n\nb = (-1) * (-7/4) / (4/7) ?\n\nWait, maybe better to solve step by step.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n-1 = b * (-4/7)\n\nMultiply both sides by (-7/4):\n\nb = (-1) * (-7/4) / ( ( -4/7 ) ?"

            "output": " Wait, no, better yet:\n\nStarting from -1 = b * (-4/7)\n\nSo, to solve for b:\n\nMultiply both sides by reciprocal of (-4/7), which is (-7/4).\n\nSo,\n\nb = (-1) * (-7/4) / 1\n\nBecause, if I take (-1) = b * (-4/7), then:\n\nb = (-1) / (-4/7) = (-1) * (-7/4) = 7/4.\n\nYes, same result as before: b = 7/4.\n\nSo that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The direction vector in the problem is given as (-7, b). The direction vector from A to B is (4, -1). So, since direction vectors can be scaled, and the direction vector from the problem is a multiple of that.\n\nSo, (4, -1) is the vector from A to B. If direction vector is to be (-7, b), then (-7, b) is just scalar multiple of (4, -1). So, let's think of it as:\n\n(4, -1) = k*(-7, b)\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n4 = -7k\n\n-1 = b*k\n\nFrom the first equation, k = 4 / (-7) = -4/7.\n\nPlugging k into the second equation:\n\n-1 = b*(-4/7)\n\nThen, solving for b:\n\nMultiply both sides by (-7/4):\n\nb = (-1) * (-7/4) = 7/4\n\nSo, same result.\n\nAlternatively, the direction vector can also be thought of as (run, rise). The direction vector given is (-7, b), so the run is -7, rise is b, which makes the slope b / (-7) = -b/7.\n\nFrom the coordinates, the slope is -1/4, so:\n\nSlope = -b/7 = -1/4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nb/7 = 1/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 7:\n\nb = 7/4\n\nSame answer.\n\nSo, in all approaches, I get b = 7/4.\n\nLet me double-check by plugging back into the direction vector. If b = 7/4, then the direction vector is (-7, 7/4). Let's find"

So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 7/4, which is 1.75. So, boxed, that would be \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4}}.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through the slope calculation again.\n\nPoints A(-5,4) and B(-1,3). The difference in y is 3 - 4 = -1. The difference in x is -1 - (-5) = -1 +5 = 4. So slope is -1/4. Correct.\n\nThen, direction vector given is (-7, b). The slope is (b)/(-7). So setting that equal to -1/4:\n\nb / (-7) = -1/4 → b = (-7)*(-1/4) = 7/4. Exactly. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of direction vectors, the direction vector from A to B is (4, -1). To get a direction vector with x-component -7, we can scale the original direction vector by a factor that turns 4 into -7. So scaling factor k is such that 4*k = -7 → k = -7/4. Then the y-component would be -1 * k = -1*(-7/4) = 7/4. So that gives the direction vector (-7, 7/4). Perfect, that's exactly the same as before.\n\nTherefore, I think I can be confident that the answer is 7/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( b \\) in the direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\), we start by determining the slope of the line passing through points \\( A(-5, 4) \\) and \\( B(-1, 3) \\).\n\nThe slope \\( m \\) of the line through points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)}"
