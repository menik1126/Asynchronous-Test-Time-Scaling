I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to figure out what the largest possible gcd is for the expressions \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\nLet me start by recalling a property of gcd. I think it has something to do with the linear combinations of the numbers. Specifically, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, b - ka) \\) for any integer \\( k \\). This is because subtracting a multiple of one number from the other doesn't change their gcd. So, maybe I can apply this here.\n\nLet me denote \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). Then, the gcd I'm looking for is \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\).\n\nUsing the property I just thought of, let's subtract a multiple of \\( a \\) from \\( b \\). I need to choose \\( k \\) such that it simplifies the expression. Let me see: If I take \\( k = 2 \\), then \\( 2a = 2n + 14 \\). But \\( b \\) is \\( 2n + 1 \\), so subtracting \\( 2a \\) from \\( b \\) would give me \\( (2n + 1) - (2n + 14) = -13 \\). Hmm, that's a negative number, but since gcd is always positive, the absolute value is what matters, right? So, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, 13) \\).\n\nWait, that simplified things a lot. So, now the problem reduces to finding \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\). Since 13 is a prime number, the gcd can only be either 1 or 13. Therefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd can only be 13. But is that possible? Let me check.\n\nIf 13 divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\), then \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\"

            "output": ") and \\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\). Let me solve these congruences to see if such an \\( n \\) exists.\n\nFrom the first congruence, \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\), which is the same as \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\) because \\( -7 + 13 = 6 \\).\n\nNow, substituting \\( n = 6 \\) into the second congruence: \\( 2(6) + 1 = 13 \\), which is indeed congruent to 0 modulo 13. So, yes, when \\( n \\) is 6, both expressions are divisible by 13.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is 13.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me consider another approach. Maybe using the Euclidean algorithm?\n\nStarting with \\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) \\). Let me perform the Euclidean steps:\n\n1. Divide \\( 2n + 1 \\) by \\( n + 7 \\). The quotient is 2, and the remainder is \\( (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\).\n\nThis is the same result as before. So, indeed, the gcd is either 1 or 13. Since 13 is achievable, that must be the maximum.\n\nIs there any chance that a higher gcd exists? Well, 13 is prime, so its only divisors are 1 and itself. There's no number greater than 13 that divides both expressions because any such number would have to be a multiple of 13, and the next multiple is 26. Let me see if 26 is possible.\n\nIf 26 divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\), then \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 26 \\), so \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 26 \\), which is \\( n \\equiv 19 \\mod 26 \\).
