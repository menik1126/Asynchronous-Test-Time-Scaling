Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because complex numbers can get tricky, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down what I know. So, z is 1 + i. That means when I plug z into the expression for w, I'll have to deal with both z and its conjugate, maybe? Wait, no, not necessarily its conjugate yet. Let me just substitute z into the expression.\n\nSo, w = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). Since z is 1 + i, let me compute 3z first. 3 times z is 3*(1 + i), which is 3*1 + 3*i, so that's 3 + 3i. Then I add 1 to that. So, 3 + 3i + 1 is 4 + 3i. Okay, that's the numerator. That part wasn't too bad.\n\nNow, the denominator is 5z + 7. So, 5 times z is 5*(1 + i), which is 5 + 5i. Then I add 7 to that. 5 + 7 is 12, so it's 12 + 5i. Therefore, the denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nSo now, w is equal to (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). Hmm, to find |w|, which is the modulus of w, I can remember that for any complex number a + bi, the modulus is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). But here, w is a fraction, so I might need to rationalize the denominator first to make it easier to compute the modulus.\n\nHow do I rationalize the denominator? Well, I remember that to divide complex numbers, you multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So, the conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i. So, I'll multiply both the top and the bottom by that.\n\nLet me write that"

Let's compute the numerator first. \n\nFirst, multiply (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i). Let's use the distributive property (FOIL):\n\n4*12 + 4*(-5i) + 3i*12 + 3i*(-5i)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n4*12 = 48\n\n4*(-5i) = -20i\n\n3i*12 = 36i\n\n3i*(-5i) = -15i\u00b2\n\nNow, combine these terms:\n\n48 - 20i + 36i -15i\u00b2\n\nCombine like terms. The real parts are 48 and the term from -15i\u00b2. Wait, since i\u00b2 is -1, so -15i\u00b2 is -15*(-1) = 15. So, the real parts are 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nThe imaginary parts are -20i + 36i = 16i. So, the numerator becomes 63 + 16i.\n\nNow, the denominator is (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i). This is a difference of squares, so (12)^2 - (5i)^2.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n12\u00b2 = 144\n\n(5i)^2 = 25i\u00b2 = 25*(-1) = -25\n\nSo, the denominator is 144 - (-25) = 144 +25 = 169.\n\nTherefore, the denominator simplifies to 169, which is a real number. So, putting it all together, w = (63 + 16i)/169.\n\nTherefore, w can be written as (63/169) + (16/169)i.\n\nNow, to find the modulus of w, which is |w|, we can use the formula for modulus of a complex number a + bi, which is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, a is 63"

Hmm, 60\u00b2 is 3600, 3\u00b2 is 9, and then the cross term is 2*60*3=360. So, (60 +3)\u00b2 = 60\u00b2 + 2*60*3 +3\u00b2 = 3600 + 360 +9 = 3969.\n\n16\u00b2 is straightforward, 16*16=256.\n\nSo, adding 3969 and 256: 3969 + 256. Let's see, 3969 + 200 = 4169, plus 56 is 4225. So total is 4225.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 4225/(169\u00b2). Now, the denominator is 169\u00b2. Let me compute that. 169*169. Let me compute 170\u00b2 first, which is 28900. But since it's 169, which is 170 -1, so (a - b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 -2ab + b\u00b2.\n\nSo, 169\u00b2 = (170 -1)^2 = 170\u00b2 - 2*170 +1 = 28900 -340 +1= 28900 -340 is 28560, plus 1 is 28561.\n\nSo, denominator is 28561.\n\nSo, |w| = sqrt(4225/28561). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, sqrt(4225) is 65 because 65^2 = 4225. And sqrt(28561) is 169, because 169^2 is 28561.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(4225/28561) = 65/169.\n\nSimplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator can be divided by 13. 65 \u00f713 = 5, and 169 \u00f713=13. So, 5/13.\n\nTherefore, |w| is 5/13.\n\nWait, that seems clean. Let me just check my calculations again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nz =1 +i\n\nSo, 3z +1"

Correct.\n\nOkay, so the modulus is 5/13.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just think if there's any other way to approach this. Alternatively, instead of rationalizing the denominator, I could compute the modulus directly from the original expression. Let me try that method as a cross-check.\n\nGiven that w = (3z +1)/(5z +7), then |w| = |3z +1| / |5z +7| because modulus of quotient is quotient of moduli.\n\nGiven that |w| = |3z +1| / |5z +7|\n\nCompute |3z +1|:\n\n3z +1 = 3*(1 +i) +1 = 3 +3i +1 =4 +3i\n\nSo, |4 +3i|=sqrt(4\u00b2 +3\u00b2)=sqrt(16 +9)=sqrt25=5.\n\nSimilarly, compute |5z +7|=|5*(1 +i) +7|=|5 +5i +7|=|12 +5i|="
