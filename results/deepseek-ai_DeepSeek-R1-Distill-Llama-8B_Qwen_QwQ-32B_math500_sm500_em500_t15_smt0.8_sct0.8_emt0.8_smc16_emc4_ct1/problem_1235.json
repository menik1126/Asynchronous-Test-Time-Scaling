I'll subtract 4 from both sides, resulting in \\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\).\n\nNext, I'll square both sides of the equation to remove the square root. This gives me \\( (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x \\).\n\nExpanding the left side, I'll get \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\).\n\nNow, I'll bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0 \\), which simplifies to \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\).\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation, I'll use the quadratic formula. The solutions are \\( x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 20}}{2} \\), which simplifies to \\( x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{2} \\).\n\nThe square root of 16 is 4, so the solutions are \\( x = \\frac{6 + 4}{2} = 5 \\) and \\( x = \\frac{6 - 4}{2} = 1 \\).\n\nHowever, I must check these solutions in the original equation to ensure they are valid. Plugging \\( x = 5 \\) into the equation, I get \\( 5 = \\sqrt{11 - 10} + 4 \\), which simplifies to \\( 5 = 1 + 4 \\), so it's valid.\n\nPlugging \\( x = 1 \\) into the equation, I get \\( 1 = \\sqrt{11 - 2} + 4 \\), which simplifies to \\( 1 = 3 + 4 \\), which is not true. Therefore, \\( x = 1 \\) is not a valid solution.\n\nThe only valid solution is \\( x = 5 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo find all values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the"
