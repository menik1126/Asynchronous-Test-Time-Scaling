            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, okay. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nHmm, so I need to find all the values of x that make this equation true. That means I need to manipulate the equation algebraically to solve for x. Since there's a square root, I know that squaring both sides might be a good idea, but I have to be careful because squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. So I'll have to check my answers at the end.\n\nFirst, let's move the square root to one side to make it easier to handle. Maybe I can subtract 4 from both sides. Let's try that.\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nOkay, so now the square root is isolated on the right side. Now, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. Let's do that.\n\n( x - 4 )^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2\n\nExpanding the left side, I get:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side to set it equal to zero.\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nAlright, so now I have a quadratic equation: x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. I can try factoring this. Let me look for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6.\n\nThe factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, if I have:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives me:\n\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5\n\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nSo, my potential solutions are x = 5 and x = 1. But since I squared both sides earlier, I need to check these solutions in the original equation to make sure they work and aren't extraneous.\n\nLet's start with x = 5.\n\n"

Good, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check x = 1.\n\nPlugging into the original equation:\n\n1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4\n\nCalculating inside the square root:\n\n11 - 2 = 9\n\n√9 = 3\n\nThen 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, 1 = 7? That's not true. Hmm, that means x = 1 is an extraneous solution and should be discarded.\n\nWait, that's unexpected. I thought both would work, but no, x = 1 doesn't satisfy the original equation. So, only x = 5 is the valid solution.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in squaring both sides or in the quadratic equation.\n\nLet me go through the steps again.\n\nStarting from:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtracting 4:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nBringing all terms to left:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nFactoring gives (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0. So, x = 5 or x = 1.\n\nTesting x = 1: 1 = √(11 - 2) + 4 => √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7 ≠ 1. So, not a solution.\n\nTesting x = 5: 5 = √(11 - 10) + 4 => √1 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, only x = 5 is the solution.\n\nWait, but why did x = 1 come up as a solution? Is there a mistake in my process?\n\nLet me think. Maybe I should consider the domain of the original equation before squaring.\n\nIn the original equation, x = √(11 - 2x"

Let me recap:\n\n1. Original equation: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\n2. Subtract 4: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\n3. Square both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\n4. Expand and simplify: x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\n5. Factor: (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0 → x = 5 or x = 1\n\n6. Check both in the original equation:\n\n   - x = 5 works.\n\n   - x = 1 does not work.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nSo, even though x = 1 satisfied the squared equation, it didn't satisfy the original because when we plug it back, the square root becomes 3, but adding 4 gives 7, which doesn't equal 1.\n\nTherefore, only x = 5 is the solution.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my process, and I double-checked both solutions. So, yeah, only x = 5 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), we start by isolating the square root term on one side:\n\n\\[ x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\]\n\nNext, we square both sides to"
