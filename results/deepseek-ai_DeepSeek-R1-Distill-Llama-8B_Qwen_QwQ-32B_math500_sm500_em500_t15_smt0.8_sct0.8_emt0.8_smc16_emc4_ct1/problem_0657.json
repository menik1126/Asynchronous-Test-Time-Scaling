            "output": "To determine how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, I'll start by assigning variables to the weights of each item. Let T represent the weight of a treek, S for a squig, and G for a goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, I know that ten treeks weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee. This gives me the equation:\n\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says that two treeks and one goolee equal the weight of one squig. So, I can write:\n\n2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I'll use the second equation to eliminate G from the first. Subtracting (2T + G = S) from both sides of the first equation, I get:\n\n10T - (2T + G) = 3S + G - S.\n\nSimplifying this, I find:\n\n8T - G = 2S.\n\nSince G = S - 2T, I can substitute this back into the equation:\n\n8T - (S - 2T) = 2S.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n10T - S = 2S.\n\nAdding S to both sides gives:\n\n10T = 3S.\n\nTherefore, I can determine that one squig weighs the same as three treeks. So, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1:** Express \\(G\\) from the second equation.\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute \\(G\\) into the first equation.\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Combine like terms.\n\\[\n10T + 2T = 4S\n\\]\n\\[\n12T = 4S\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Simplify the ratio.\n\\[\n3T = S\n\\"
