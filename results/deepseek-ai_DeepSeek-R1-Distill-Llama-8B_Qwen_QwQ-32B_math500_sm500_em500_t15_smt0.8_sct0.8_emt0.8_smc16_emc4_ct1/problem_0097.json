            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem to solve. It says that the sum of two fractions, C over (x - 3) and D over (x + 8), equals (4x - 23) over (x² + 5x - 24) for all real values of x except -8 and 3. I need to find the product CD. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have two fractions equal to each other for all x (except where the denominators are zero), you can combine them on one side and set the numerator equal to the other numerator. So, I’ll try that approach here.\n\nLet me write down the given equation:\n\nC/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/(x² + 5x - 24)\n\nI notice that the denominator on the right side, x² + 5x - 24, can probably be factored. Let me check. I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3? Yes, because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, that factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). Got it.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nC/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nNow, to combine the left side into a single fraction, I need a common denominator, which would be (x - 3)(x + 8). So, I'll rewrite each fraction with this common denominator.\n\nFor C/(x - 3), I'll multiply numerator and denominator by (x + 8):\n\nC(x + 8)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nSimilarly, for D/(x + 8), I'll multiply numerator and denominator by (x - 3):\n\nD(x - 3)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n[C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)] = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nSince the denominators are equal, the numerators"

So, we can set up two equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables, C and D. I can solve this system to find C and D, and then compute their product CD.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Maybe multiply Equation 1 by 3 so that the coefficients of D are opposites.\n\nMultiplying Equation 1 by 3:\n\n3C + 3D = 12\n\nNow, Equation 2 is:\n\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nIf I add these two equations together, the 3D and -3D will cancel out:\n\n(3C + 8C) + (3D - 3D) = 12 + (-23)\n\nThat gives:\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, plugging back into Equation 1:\n\n-1 + D = 4\n\nSo, D = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Their product is (-1)*5 = -5.\n\nHmm, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Plugging C = -1 and D = 5 back into the original expressions.\n\nLeft side: (-1)/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8). Let's combine them:\n\n[ -1*(x + 8) + 5*(x - "
