Let me see, the denominator is x\u00b2 + 5x - 24. To factor that, I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3 work because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, x\u00b2 + 5x - 24 factors into (x + 8)(x - 3). That's interesting because the denominators on the left side are (x - 3) and (x + 8), which are the same as the factors from the right side.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n(C)/(x - 3) + (D)/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nSince the denominators are the same on both sides, I can combine the left side over the common denominator:\n\n[ C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) ] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)] = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nSince the denominators are equal, the numerators must be equal as well. So,\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, I need to solve for C and D. Let me expand the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, since this equation must hold for all real values of x except x=3 and x=-8, the coefficients of x and the constants must be equal on both sides.\n\nSo, I can set up a system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow,"

Let's solve for C: C = 4 - D\n\nNow, substitute C into equation 2:\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nExpand:\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 -32\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nNow that I have D=5, substitute back into equation 1:\n\nC + 5 = 4\n\nWait, so C = 4 -5 = -1\n\nHmm, so C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nTherefore, the integers are C=-1 and D=5.\n\nBut the question asks for the product CD. Let's compute that:\n\nCD = (-1)*(5) = -5\n\nLet me double-check my steps to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAfter factoring, I set up the equation correctly, combined the left side, and equated the coefficients. Then I solved the system and found C=-1 and D=5.\n\nIf I plug these back into the left side:\n\n(-1)/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8) = [ -1*(x + 8) +5*(x - 3) ] / (x^2 +5x -24)\n= [ -x -8 +5x -15 ] / (x^2 +5x -24)\n= [4x -23]/(x^2 +5x -24), which matches the right side. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product CD is -5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), we start by noting that the given equation can be combined over a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nCombining the left-hand side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{("
