Hmm, let me break this down step by step because I remember rotations involve some transformation in the complex plane.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given information. The complex number \\( z \\) is \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\), and \\( c \\) is \\( 2 - 3i \\). I need to find \\( w \\), which is the result of rotating \\( z \\) around \\( c \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians, or 45 degrees, counter-clockwise.\n\nI remember that rotating a point around another point in the complex plane can be done using the formula:\n\\[ w = c + (z - c)e^{i\\theta} \\]\nwhere \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of rotation, which in this case is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\). But wait, I want to make sure I got this formula right. Let me think.\n\nIf I have a complex number \\( z \\) and I want to rotate it around another complex number \\( c \\), the general approach is to translate the system so that \\( c \\) moves to the origin, perform the rotation, and then translate back. That makes sense. So, subtract \\( c \\) from \\( z \\) to get the vector from \\( c \\) to \\( z \\), rotate that vector by \\( \\theta \\), and then add \\( c \\) back to get the new position.\n\nSo, the formula should indeed be:\n\\[ w = c + (z - c) \\cdot e^{i\\theta} \\]\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me convert \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) into exponential form. \\( e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}} \\) is \\( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\). I know that \\( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}"
