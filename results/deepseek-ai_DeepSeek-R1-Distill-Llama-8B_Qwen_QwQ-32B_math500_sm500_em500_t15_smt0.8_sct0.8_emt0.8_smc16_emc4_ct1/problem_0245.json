How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the number of repeating digits in the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to convert the fraction \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) into its decimal form.\n   - The decimal will be repeating because 11111 is not a power of 10 or a product of 2s and 5s.\n\n2. **Find the Length of the Repeating Period:**\n   - The length of the repeating period of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) in its decimal form is the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} \\), where \\( n \\) is coprime with 10.\n   - First, factorize 11111:\n     \\[\n     11111 = 3 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 11\n     \\]\n   - Calculate Euler's totient function \\( \\phi(11111) \\):\n"

We need the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11111} \\).\n\n3. **Check Divisors of 1200:**\n   - The possible values of \\( k \\) are the divisors of 1200. We test the smallest divisors first.\n   - However, since 11111 is a composite number, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of its prime factors:\n     - Period of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\): 1 (since \\( 10^1 \\equiv 1 \\mod 3 \\))\n     - Period of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\): 6 (since \\( 10^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7 \\))\n     - Period of \\( \\frac{1}{11} \\): 2 (since \\( 10^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 11 \\))\n     - Since there are two 11s, the period for \\( 11^2 \\) is still 2 (as the period for prime powers divides the period of the prime).\n   - The LCM of 1, 6, and 2 is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{LCM}(1, 6, 2) = 6\n     \\]\n   - However, this LCM is for the prime factors.
