            "output": "To determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), I first note that 11111 is a prime number.\n\nSince the denominator is a prime number and does not divide into 10, the decimal expansion of the fraction will be a repeating decimal. The length of the repeating sequence is determined by the order of 10 modulo the denominator.\n\nCalculating the order of 10 modulo 11111 involves finding the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod 11111 \\).\n\nAfter performing modular exponentiation, it is found that \\( k = 10 \\). This means the repeating sequence has 10 digits.\n\nTherefore, the repeating decimal of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) consists of 10 repeating digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - The fraction \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) will produce a repeating decimal because 11111 is a prime number.\n   - We need to find the length of the repeating sequence in its decimal form.\n\n2. **Find the Order of 10 Modulo 11111:**\n   - The repeating decimal length is determined by the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod 11111\n     \\]\n   - Since 11111 is prime, the order of 10 modulo 11111 will be the smallest \\( k \\) that satisfies the above congruence.\n\n3. **Calculate the Order:**\n   - By performing modular exponentiation, we find that the order \\( k \\) is **10**.\n   - This means the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) repeats every 10 digits.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the repeating decimal of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) consists of **10** repeating digits.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"
