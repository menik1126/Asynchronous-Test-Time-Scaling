            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So the general form of \\( P(x) \\) would be \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\). \n\nThe problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). And when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we're given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\). \n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, since \\( P(x) \\) is divided by two quadratic polynomials, the remainders must be linear polynomials, right? Because when you divide a cubic by a quadratic, the remainder is of degree less than 2, so it's linear. Let me call the remainder when dividing by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) as \\( R(x) = mx + n \\), and the remainder when dividing by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\) as \\( 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n \\).\n\nNow, another thing I remember is the Remainder Theorem, which says that the remainder of a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) divided by \\( (x - k) \\) is \\( P(k) \\). So, since the divisor for the first division is \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) must satisfy \\( R(1) = P(1) \\) and \\( R(4) = P(4) \\). Similarly, for the second division, the remainder \\( 2R(x) \\) must satisfy \\( 2R(2) = P(2) \\) and \\( 2R(3) = P(3) \\).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n1. \\( R(1) = P(1) = m(1) + n = m + n \\)\n2. \\( R(4) = P(4) = m(4) + n = 4m"

Maybe I can set up a system of equations to solve for \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). Let me note that \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic monic polynomial, so it's \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\).

Since we know P(0)=5, that's a fifth point.
