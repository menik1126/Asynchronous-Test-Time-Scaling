            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle ABCD is closer to the center O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the rectangle has center O. So, the coordinates of O are the midpoint of the rectangle. Let me assume, for simplicity, that the rectangle is centered at the origin (0,0). That should make things easier because I can then consider the rectangle's sides aligned with the x-axis and y-axis.\n\nThe problem states that AB/AD = k. AB is the length of the side from A to B, which is the length of the rectangle. AD is the length from A to D, which is the height of the rectangle. So, AB is the length, and AD is the width. Let me denote AB as 2a and AD as 2b. Wait, is that correct? Wait, if AB is from A to B, which is the length, then AB = 2a, so the half-length would be a. Similarly, AD = 2b, so half of that is b. Then, the sides of the rectangle are from -a to a along the x-axis and from -b to b along the y-axis. So, the rectangle spans from (-a, -b) to (a, b).\n\nGiven that AB/AD = k, so AB = 2a and AD = 2b, so (2a)/(2b) = k, so a/b = k/2, meaning a = (k/2) * b.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to assign AB = 2 and AD = 2/k, so that their ratio is 2 / (2/k) = k. That way, the rectangle is set with AB = 2 and AD = 2/k, so it's easier because then the sides would be 2 and 2/k. Hmm, but maybe it's simpler to just let AB = k and AD = 1, making the rectangle have length k and width 1. Wait, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can let the rectangle have length 2 and width 2/k, so that AB = 2 and AD = 2/k. So, then, the sides would be from (-1, -1/k) to (1, 1/k). Wait, but"

Then, AB is the length from (-a, b) to (a, b), so that's 2a. AD is the length from (-a, b) to (-a, -b), which is 2b. Therefore, AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, a/b = k, so a = k*b. So, the rectangle has length 2a = 2k*b and width 2b. Hmm, but maybe choosing specific values for a and b would make this easier. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to set the rectangle with sides of length 2 and 2k, so that the ratio AB/AD is (2k)/2 = k. Wait, but then AB would be the length, so if AB is the horizontal side, then the horizontal length is 2k, and the vertical length is 2. Hmm, but then the center is at (0,0). Let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me set up coordinates. Let me let the rectangle have vertices at (-a, -b), (a, -b), (a, b), (-a, b). So, the center O is at (0,0). Then, the length AB is the distance between (-a, b) and (a, b), which is 2a. The length AD is the distance between (-a, b) and (-a, -b), which is 2b. Therefore, AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, a = k*b. Therefore, the rectangle has sides of length 2a = 2k*b and 2b. So, the rectangle's dimensions are determined by a and b with a = k*b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe to make it even simpler, let me set b = 1, so that a = k. Then, the rectangle would have vertices at (-k, -1), (k, -1), (k, 1), (-k, 1). That way, the ratio AB/AD is (2k)/2 = k, which matches the problem's condition. So, this might be a good coordinate"

So, the area of the rectangle is (2k) * 2 = 4k.\n\nWait, no: width is from -k to k, which is 2k, and the height is from -1 to 1, which is 2. So, the area is 2k * 2 = 4k.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. So, the probability is the area where the point is closer to O than to any vertex, divided by the area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, first, let's model this.

So, (-0.5,0.875).\n\nLine3: y=0.5x -0.625.\n\nAt x=0.5, y=0.25-0.625=-0.375.\n\nAt x=-0.5, y=-0.25-0.625=-0.875, which is below the bottom edge y=-1? Wait, no, y=-0.875 is within the rectangle (since y ranges from -1 to1).\n\nWait, so line3 intersects the left edge at x=-0.5, y=0.5*(-0.5) -0.625= -0.25 -0.625= -0.875.\n\nSimilarly, line4: y=-0.5x -0.625.\n\nAt x=0.5, y= -0.25 -0.625= -0.875.\n\nAt x=-0.5, y=0.25 -0.625= -0.375.\n\nWait, so the four intersection points are:\n\nLine1 and right edge: (0.5,0.875)\n\nLine2 and left edge: (-0.5,0.875)\n\nLine3 and left edge: (-0.5,-0.875)\n\nLine4 and right edge: (0.5,-0.875)\n\nWait, but then the region bounded by these four points would form a diamond shape with vertices at (0.5,0.875), (-0.5,0.875), (-0.5,-0.875), (0.5,-0.875).\n\nWait, but then the area would be the area of this diamond.\n\nThe diamond's vertices are at (±0.5, ±0.875). The distance between (0.5,0.875) and (-0.5,0.875) is 1 unit in x, and between"
