Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, the expression is a fraction where the numerator is linear in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and the denominator is quartic, meaning it's degree four. That might make things a bit tricky since higher-degree terms can complicate optimization. But maybe I can manipulate the variables or use some substitution to simplify it.\n\nI remember that for optimization problems with multiple variables, methods like setting derivatives to zero for critical points can work. So perhaps I should use partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and set them both to zero to find potential maxima or minima.\n\nLet me denote the function as \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). To find its critical points, I need to compute the partial derivatives \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\), set them to zero, and solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nStarting with the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{(-1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4y^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the critical points, I need to set both of these partial derivatives equal to zero.

To use Lagrange multipliers, perhaps set up the problem as maximizing f(x,y), which is equivalent to maximizing the numerator while keeping the denominator fixed, but since it's a fraction, maybe set up the Lagrangian as L = (x - y) - λ(x^4 + y^4 +6 -k), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set up the problem as maximizing f(x,y) = (x - y)/(x^4 + y^4 +6). To use Lagrange multipliers, we can consider the function f(x,y) and set its gradient to zero.\n\nWait, that's what I did earlier with partial derivatives. So, the critical points are the solutions to the equations we had before, and we found that (1, -1) is a critical point. Since other trials give lower values, perhaps that is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the second derivative test at (1, -1) to see if it's a maximum.\n\nCompute the Hessian matrix at (1, -1). The Hessian is:\n\n[ f_xx  f_xy ]\n\n[ f_xy  f_yy ]\n\nIf the Hessian is negative definite, then it's a local maximum.\n\nBut computing the second derivatives might be tedious, but let me try.\n\nFirst, compute f_xx:\n\nFirst, the first partial derivative with respect to x was:\n\ndf/dx = [ (x^4 + y^4 +6) - (x - y)(4x^3) ] / (denominator)^2\n\nLet me denote numerator1 = (x^4 + y^4 +6) - (x - y)(4x^3)\n\nSimilarly, denominator = D = x^4 + y^4 +6\n\nThus, df/dx = numerator1 / D^2\n\nThen, the second derivative f_xx is derivative of df/dx with respect to x:\n\nUsing quotient rule:\n\nd/dx [numerator1 / D^2] = [ (d/dx numerator1)*D^2 - numerator1 * 2D*(d/dx D) ] / D^4\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Maybe it's better to plug in the point (1, -1) first.\n\nAt (1, -1):\n\n"

Evaluating the function at these points gives \\( f(1, -1) = \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( f(-1, 1) = -\\frac{1}{4} \\).
