Hmm, okay. I remember from my math classes that optimization problems like this often use methods like the AM-GM inequality or Lagrange multipliers. Let me think about which one would be more appropriate here.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the AM-GM inequality says. It states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean, and equality holds when all the numbers are equal. That might be useful because I have a product of variables, and the sum of the variables is fixed. So maybe I can set up an equation using AM-GM to find the maximum of the product.\n\nWait, but the expression isn't just a product of variables; it's \\( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\). Hmm, so each variable has a different exponent. Maybe I need to adjust how I apply AM-GM. Let me think, perhaps I can represent the expression as a product of terms, each corresponding to the exponents in the product.\n\nLet me see, \\( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\) can be written as \\( a \\times b \\times b \\times c \\times c \\times c \\times d \\times d \\times d \\times d \\). So that's a total of 10 variables: one a, two b's, three c's, and four d's. Since the sum \\( a + b + c + d = 10 \\), I can think of this as the sum of 10 variables, each contributing a part to the total.\n\nSo, if I consider all these individual terms: a, b, b, c, c, c, d, d, d, d. There are 10 of them. The sum of these is \\( a + b + b + c + c + c + d + d + d + d = a + 2b + 3c + 4d \\). Wait, but the original sum is \\( a + b + c + d = 10 \\). So this approach isn't directly matching because I'm breaking down the variables into multiple terms. Maybe I need to relate the two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can"

The weighted AM-GM states that for positive real numbers and positive weights summing to 1, the weighted arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the weighted geometric mean.

Let me check again. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the exponents in the product. Since the product is \\( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\), the exponents are 1, 2, 3, 4. The sum of the exponents is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. That's the same as the number of terms when I broke them down earlier. So maybe I can use the AM-GM inequality on these terms.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me consider the variables as follows:\n\nLet me split the variables into their respective exponents. So, for example, the term 'a' is just one term, 'b' is split into two terms each of b, 'c' into three terms each of c, and 'd' into four terms each of d. So in total, there are 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 terms.

Wait, actually, I'm not sure I'm phrasing that correctly. Let me try again. If I have a sum of parts, each part is a fraction of the total sum. Since a is split into 1 part, b into 2 parts, etc., the total number of parts is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. So each part would be equal if we apply AM-GM.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right because each variable has a different number of parts. Maybe a better approach is to use the weighted AM-GM inequality, assigning weights equal to the exponents. So for each variable, the weight is its exponent in the product.\n\nSo, the weights for a, b, c, d would be 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.

So, let me think of each part as contributing to the total sum of 10.\n\nSo, if I have 1 a, 2 b's, 3 c's, and 4 d's, making a total of 10 terms.

Wait, that can't be because we have different numbers of each variable.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each variable is broken into multiple terms. For example, variable a is a single term, so a = x. Variable b is broken into 2 terms, each of which is equal to x, so b = x + x.
