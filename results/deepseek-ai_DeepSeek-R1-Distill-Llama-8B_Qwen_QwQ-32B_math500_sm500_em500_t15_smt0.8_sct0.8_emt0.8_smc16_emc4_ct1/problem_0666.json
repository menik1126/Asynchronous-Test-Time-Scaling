            "output": "First, I'll assign variables to the weights of the treeks, squigs, and goolees. Let T represent the weight of one treek, S represent the weight of one squig, and G represent the weight of one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This can be written as:\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nFrom the second statement, two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This gives the equation:\n2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I'll solve these two equations to find the relationship between T and S.\n\nSubstituting the value of S from the second equation into the first:\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n10T = 6T + 3G + G,\n10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides:\n4T = 4G.\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\nT = G.\n\nSo, the weight of one treek is equal to the weight of one goolee.\n\nNow, using the second equation again:\n2T = S.\n\nSince T equals G, we can substitute:\n2G = S.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of two treeks is equal to the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1:** Express \\( S \\) in terms of \\( T \\) and \\( G \\) from the second equation.\n\\[\nS = 2T + G\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute \\( S \\) in the first equation.\n\\[\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 6T + 3G + G\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 6T + 4G\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract \\( 6T \\) from both sides.\n\\[\n4T"
