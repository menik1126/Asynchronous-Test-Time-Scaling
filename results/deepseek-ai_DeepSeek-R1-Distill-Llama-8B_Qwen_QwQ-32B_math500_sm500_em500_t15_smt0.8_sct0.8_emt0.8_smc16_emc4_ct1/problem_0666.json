            "output": "First, I'll define the weights of each item in terms of a common unit, let's say the squig. Let Treek = T, Squig = S, and Gool = G.\n\nFrom the first statement, 10 Treeks weigh as much as 3 Squigs and 1 Gool. This gives the equation: 10T = 3S + G.\n\nFrom the second statement, 2 Treeks and 1 Gool equal the weight of 1 Squig. This gives the equation: 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I can substitute the second equation into the first. Replacing S in the first equation with (2T + G) results in: 10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation: 10T = 6T + 3G + G, which simplifies to 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides gives: 4T = 4G. Dividing both sides by 4 results in T = G.\n\nSince T equals G, I can substitute back into the second equation: 2T + T = S, so 3T = S.\n\nTherefore, the weight of one Treek is equal to the weight of one Squig, meaning the combined weight of 3 Treeks equals the weight of 1 Squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step by defining the weights of each item in terms of a common unit.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let **Treek** = T\n   - Let **Squig** = S\n   - Let **Gool** = G\n\n2. **Translate the Statements into Equations:**\n\n   - **First Statement:**  \n     \"Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\"  \n     This translates to:  \n     \\[\n     10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Second Statement:**  \n     \"Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\"  \n     This translates to:  \n     \\[\n     2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:**\n   - From Equation"
