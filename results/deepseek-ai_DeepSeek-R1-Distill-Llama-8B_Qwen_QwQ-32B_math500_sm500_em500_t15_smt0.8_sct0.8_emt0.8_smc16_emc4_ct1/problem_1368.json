            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of boys attending the math club meeting based on the given information.\n\nLet's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that G is a multiple of 13, so G can be 13, 26, 39, and so on.\n\nAlso, there are more girls than boys at the meeting, which means G > B.\n\nThe total number of students attending the meeting is 35, so G + B = 35.\n\nGiven that G is a multiple of 13, I'll test the possible values of G.\n\nStarting with G = 13:\nIf G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22.\nBut since there are more girls than boys, 13 > 22 is not true. So this doesn't work.\n\nNext, try G = 26:\nIf G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9.\nNow, check if 26 > 9, which is true. This satisfies all the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys attending the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( G \\) be the number of girls.\n   - Let \\( B \\) be the number of boys.\n\n2. **Given Conditions:**\n   - The total number of students is 35: \\( G + B = 35 \\).\n   - The number of girls \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13.\n   - There are more girls than boys: \\( G > B \\).\n\n3. **List Possible Values for \\( G \\):**\n   - Since \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13 and \\( G > B \\), we test possible multiples:\n     - \\( G = 13 \\): Then \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\). But \\( 13 > 22 \\) is false.\n     - \\( G = 26 \\): Then \\( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\). Here, \\( 26 > 9 \\) is true.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only valid solution is \\( G = 26 \\) and \\( B = 9 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\(\\boxed{9}\\)"
