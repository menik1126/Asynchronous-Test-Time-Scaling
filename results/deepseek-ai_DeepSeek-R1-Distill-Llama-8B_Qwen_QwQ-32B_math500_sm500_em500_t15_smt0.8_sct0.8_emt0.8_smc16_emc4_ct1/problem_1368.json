            "output": "I need to determine the number of boys attending the math club meeting. There are 35 students in total, and the number of girls is a multiple of 13. Additionally, there are more girls than boys.\n\nFirst, I'll denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. According to the problem, G + B = 35.\n\nSince the number of girls is a multiple of 13, possible values for G are 13, 26, or 39. However, because the total number of students is 35, G can only be 13 or 26 because 39 is greater than 35.\n\nNext, I'll consider each possible value of G:\n\n1. If G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. But this would mean there are more boys than girls, which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\n2. If G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. This satisfies the condition because there are more girls than boys.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Step 1: Express the total number of students in terms of G and B.**\n\\[\nG + B = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Since G is a multiple of 13, possible values for G are 13, 26, or 39. However, since the total number of students is 35, G can only be 13 or 26.**\n\n**Step 3: Test each possible value of G to satisfy the condition that there are more girls than boys.**\n\n1. **If \\( G = 13 \\):**\n   \\[\n   B = 35 - 13 = 22\n   \\]\n   Here, there are more boys than girls, which contradicts the given condition.\n\n2. **If \\( G = 26 \\):**\n   \\[\n   B = 35 - 26 = 9\n   \\]\n   Here, there are more girls than boys, which satisfies the condition.\n\n**Conclusion:"
