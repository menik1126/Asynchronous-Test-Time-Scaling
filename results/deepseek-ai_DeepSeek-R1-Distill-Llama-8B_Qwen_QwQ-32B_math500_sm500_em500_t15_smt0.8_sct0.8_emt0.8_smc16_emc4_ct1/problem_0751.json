This simplifies the equation to \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate \\(3^x\\). This gives me \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\\).\n\nNow, I recognize that 9 can be expressed as \\(3^2\\). Therefore, the equation becomes \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. This means \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2^3\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n   \n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} \\Rightarrow 3^x = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation now is:\n   \n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
