            "output": "First, I need to determine how many possible combinations there are for the letters on the license plate. Since there are 26 different letters in the English alphabet and each license plate requires two distinct letters, I'll use the permutation formula for selecting 2 out of 26 without replacement.\n\nNext, for the numbers, each digit can be any number from 0 to 9, and unlike the letters, digits can repeat. This means for each of the two number positions, there are 10 possible choices. Since repetitions are allowed, I'll use the formula for permutations with repetition for the numbers.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of possible license plates, I'll multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of possible number combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many unique license plates can be formed, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of possible combinations for the letters.**\n\n- **Total letters available:** 26 (A through Z)\n- **Letters required per plate:** 2 different letters\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 different letters out of 26 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(26, 2) = \\frac{26!}{2!(26-2)!} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{2} = 325\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of possible combinations for the numbers.**\n\n- **Digits available:** 10 (0 through 9)\n- **Digits required per plate:** 2 digits, with repetition allowed\n\nSince repetition is allowed, the number of possible combinations for the digits is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 10 = 100\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique license plates.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total plates} = \\text{Number of letter combinations} \\times \\text{Number of number combinations} = 325 \\times 100 = 32,500\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe total number of possible license plates is \\boxed{32500}."
