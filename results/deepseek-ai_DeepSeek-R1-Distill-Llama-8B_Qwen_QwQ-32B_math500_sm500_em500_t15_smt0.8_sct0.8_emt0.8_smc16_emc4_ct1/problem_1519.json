Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and each letter can be repeated, the number of possible combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 26, which equals 676.\n\nNext, there are two digits. With digits ranging from 0 to 9, there are 10 possible choices for each digit. Since the digits must also be different, the number of combinations for the digits is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of unique license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations. That is, 676 multiplied by 90, which equals 60,840.\n\nTherefore, the total number of license plates that can be formed under the given conditions is 60,840.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates that can be formed under the given conditions, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the number of possible combinations for the letters.**\n- **Letters available:** 26 (A through Z)\n- **Number of letters on the license plate:** 2\n- **Condition:** The two letters must be different.\n\nThe number of possible combinations for the letters is calculated using the formula for permutations of \\( n \\) items taken \\( r \\) at a time:\n\\[\nP(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!\n\\]\nWhere \\( n = 26 \\) and \\( r = 2 \\):\n\\[\nP(26, 2) = 26! / (26 - 2)! = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the number of possible combinations for the numbers.**\n- **Digits available:** 10 (0 through 9)\n- **Number of digits on the license plate:** 2\n- **Condition:** The two digits must be different.\n\nThe number of possible combinations for the digits is also calculated using permutations:\n\\[\nP(10, 2) = 10! / (10 - 2)! = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the total number of license plates.**\n- **Total combinations for letters:** 650\n- **Total combinations for digits:**"
