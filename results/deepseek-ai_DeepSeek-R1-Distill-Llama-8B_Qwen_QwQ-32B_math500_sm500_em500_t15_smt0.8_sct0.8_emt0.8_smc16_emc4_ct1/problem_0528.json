Each of them wants to order one dish, but they **refuse to order the same dish**. Additionally, the order matters (Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Number of Choices for Yann**\n\nSince Yann can choose any of the 10 dishes, he has **10 possible choices**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Number of Choices for Camille**\n\nAfter Yann has chosen his dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish. Therefore, Camille has **9 remaining choices**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Combinations**\n\nThe total number of different meal combinations can be calculated by multiplying Yann's choices by Camille's choices:\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
