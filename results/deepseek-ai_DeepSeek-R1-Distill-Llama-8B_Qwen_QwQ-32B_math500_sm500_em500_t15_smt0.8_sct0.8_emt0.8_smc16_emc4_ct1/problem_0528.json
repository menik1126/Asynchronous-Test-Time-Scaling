Therefore, Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\n4. **Calculating Combinations:** Since Yann and Camille's orders are distinguishable, the number of different combinations is the product of their choices.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Combinations} = 10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{90}\\)"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
