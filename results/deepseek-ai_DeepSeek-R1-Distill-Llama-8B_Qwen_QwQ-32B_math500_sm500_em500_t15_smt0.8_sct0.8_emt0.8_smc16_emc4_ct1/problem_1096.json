Hmm, recursion can be tricky, but maybe if I can find a pattern or a cycle, that would help simplify things.\n\nFirst, let me understand the function definition. The function \\( f(i, j) \\) is defined for non-negative integers \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) where \\( j \\) is between 0 and 4, inclusive. The function is defined recursively with three cases:\n\n1. If \\( i = 0 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq j \\leq 4 \\), then \\( f(0, j) = \\text{mod}_5(j + 1) \\). That seems straightforward. Since mod 5 gives the remainder when divided by 5, \\( f(0, j) \\) will be \\( j + 1 \\) mod 5. So for \\( j = 0 \\), it's 1; \\( j = 1 \\), it's 2; up to \\( j = 4 \\), it's 0. So that base case is clear.\n\n2. If \\( i \\geq 1 \\) and \\( j = 0 \\), then \\( f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1) \\). So, for any \\( i \\), if the second argument is 0, we reduce \\( i \\) by 1 and set \\( j \\) to 1.\n\n3. If \\( i \\geq 1 \\) and \\( 1 \\leq j \\leq 4 \\), then \\( f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)) \\). That's a nested recursion, which can get complicated, but maybe there's a pattern.\n\nOur goal is \\( f(2015, 2) \\). That's pretty far out, so I think we need to figure out a pattern or maybe find that the function is periodic in some way.\n\nLet me start by computing some small values of \\( f(i, j) \\) to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nStarting with \\( i = 0 \\):\n- \\( f(0, 0) = \\text{mod}_5(0 + 1) = 1 \\)\n- \\( f(0,"
