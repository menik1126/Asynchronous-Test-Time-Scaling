I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the rectangle. Let me label the rectangle with points A, B, C, D. Since O is the center, it should be the intersection point of the diagonals AC and BD. So, O is equidistant from all sides in terms of the center.\n\nGiven that AB/AD = k, let me denote AB as the length and AD as the width of the rectangle. So, AB = k * AD. Maybe it's easier if I set the sides to specific lengths. Let's assume that AD = 1, then AB = k. So, the rectangle has sides of length k and 1. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD = k, and AD = BC = 1.\n\nThe area of the rectangle would then be AB * AD = k * 1 = k. So, the total area where the point can be is k.\n\nNow, I need to find the region within the rectangle where a point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D. The probability would be the area of that region divided by the total area of the rectangle, which is k.\n\nTo find this region, I think I need to determine all the points closer to O than to any vertex. That is, for each vertex, the set of points closer to that vertex than to O forms a boundary, and the intersection of the regions closer to O than each vertex would give the desired area.\n\nSo, let me consider each vertex:\n\n1. For vertex A: The set of points closer to A than to O.\n2. For vertex B: The set of points closer to B than to O.\n3. For vertices C and D: Similarly, the regions closer to C and D than to O.\n\nI need to find the locus of points where the distance to O is equal to the distance to each vertex. These loci will be curves that form boundaries of the regions, and the intersection of the regions where distance to O is less than the distance to each vertex will be the area we need.\n\nLet me set up a"

Since the rectangle has sides of length k and 1, the coordinates of the vertices can be determined.\n\nIf the center is at (0,0), then the coordinates of the vertices would be:\n\n- A: (-k/2, 1/2)\n- B: (k/2, 1/2)\n- C: (k/2, -1/2)\n- D: (-k/2, -1/2)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me confirm that. Since the center is the midpoint of the rectangle, so if the length AB is k, then the distance from the center to each side along the length is k/2, and the distance from the center to each side along the width is 1/2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, coordinates:\n\n- A is (-k/2, 1/2)\n- B is (k/2, 1/2)\n- C is (k/2, -1/2)\n- D is (-k/2, -1/2)\n- O is (0,0)\n\nNow, to find the region where a point (x,y) is closer to O than to any of the vertices. So, for each vertex, the condition is:\n\nDistance to O < Distance to vertex.\n\nSo, for vertex A: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 )\n\nSimilarly for B, C, D.\n\nBut since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe the regions will also be symmetric, so perhaps I can compute the area for one quadrant and multiply by 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region closer to O than all vertices is the intersection of the regions closer to O than each vertex. So, the intersection of four regions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the boundaries between the regions where the point is closer to O than to a vertex are the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex.\n\nYes, that's right. The set of points equidistant to O and a vertex is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining O and that vertex. So, the region closer to O than the vertex is the side of the bisector closer to O.\n\nTherefore, the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the four"

So, the region defined by the bisectors may or may not be entirely within the rectangle, depending on whether k is greater than or equal to 1 or less than 1.\n\nTherefore, the problem might have different cases depending on the value of k.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a point is randomly chosen from the interior of rectangle ABCD\". So, the region where the point is closer to O than any vertex must be entirely within the rectangle, but the bisectors might intersect the rectangle's edges, so the actual region is the intersection of the bisector regions and the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the shape of the region depends on whether k is greater than or less than 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to consider two cases: when k \u22641 and when k \u22651.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to write the area in terms of k without splitting into cases, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the region is always a polygon formed by the intersection of the bisectors and the rectangle edges.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose k is arbitrary positive real number"
