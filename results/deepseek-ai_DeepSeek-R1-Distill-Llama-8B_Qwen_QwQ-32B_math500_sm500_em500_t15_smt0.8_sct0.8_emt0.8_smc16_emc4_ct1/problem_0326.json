Since the order does not matter, I'll use the combination formula to calculate this.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 4 available.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls to find the total number of distinct groups that can be formed.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nMr. Brennan wants to select **3 boys** and **2 girls** from his class to form a group presentation. Since the order in which the boys and girls are chosen does not matter, we'll use combinations to find the number of ways to make these selections.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls to find the total number of distinct groups:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = C(7, 3) \\times C(4, 2) = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
