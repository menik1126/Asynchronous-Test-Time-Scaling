            "output": "First, I recognize that the problem involves selecting a group of students from a larger set, where the order of selection doesn't matter. This suggests using combinations to determine the number of ways to choose the required number of students.\n\nThere are 7 boys in the class, and Mr. Brennan needs to select 3 of them. To find out how many ways he can do this, I'll calculate the combination of 7 boys taken 3 at a time, denoted as C(7,3).\n\nSimilarly, there are 4 girls in the class, and he needs to select 2 of them. I'll calculate the combination of 4 girls taken 2 at a time, which is C(4,2).\n\nOnce the boys and girls are selected, they form a group of 5 students. Since the order of selection doesn't matter, I need to find the number of ways to combine these groups. This is done by multiplying the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls.\n\nFinally, the total number of ways to form the group is the product of C(7,3) and C(4,2).\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his statistics class, where the order of selection does not matter.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ways to choose 3 boys} = \\binom{7}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of ways to choose 2 girls} = \\binom{4}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two results to find the total number of ways to form the group:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of ways} = \\binom{7}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\binom{7}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 35 \\times 6 = 210}\n\\]"
