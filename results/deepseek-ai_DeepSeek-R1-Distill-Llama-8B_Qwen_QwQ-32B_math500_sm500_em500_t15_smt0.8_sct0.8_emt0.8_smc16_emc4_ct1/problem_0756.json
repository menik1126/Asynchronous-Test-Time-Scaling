            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a sequence of positive integers that's strictly increasing. The sequence is a1, a2, a3, and so on. The problem says that for every positive integer k, two things happen: first, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and second, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. They also tell me that a13 is 2016, and I need to find a1.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. Let's start by understanding what a geometric and an arithmetic sequence are. A geometric sequence has each term after the first multiplied by a common ratio, so if I have terms b, c, d in geometric sequence, then c = b * r and d = c * r = b * r^2. On the other hand, an arithmetic sequence has each term after the first obtained by adding a common difference, so c = b + d and d = c + e, where e is the common difference.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}} is geometric. So, for each k, a2k = a_{2k-1} * r and a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r = a_{2k-1} * r^2.\n\nSimilarly, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}} is arithmetic, so the difference between a_{2k+1} and a_{2k} should be the same as the difference between a_{2k+2} and a_{2k+1}. So, a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}, which implies that a_{2k+2} = 2*a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}.\n\nBut wait, since the first subsequence is geometric, we have a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r, so substituting that into the arithmetic condition, we have a_{2k+2} = 2*(a_{2k} * r) - a_{"

So a4/a3 =8/7, so a5 should be a4*(8/7)=784*(8/7)= 784/7=112*8=896.\n\nWait, but according to the arithmetic triplet a2,a3,a4, a4=2a3 -a2=2*686 -588=1372-588=784, which is correct. But the geometric triplet a3,a4,a5 requires that a4/a3 = a5/a4, so a5 =a4^2/a3 = (784)^2 /686.\n\nCompute that:\n\n784^2 = (784)*(784). Let me compute 784*784:\n\nBut 784 is 28^2, so 28^4= (28^2)^2=784^2=614656.\n\nDivide by 686:\n\n614656 /686. Let's see:\n\n686*900=617400, which is more than 614656. So 686*895=686*(900-5)=617400 -3430=61"
