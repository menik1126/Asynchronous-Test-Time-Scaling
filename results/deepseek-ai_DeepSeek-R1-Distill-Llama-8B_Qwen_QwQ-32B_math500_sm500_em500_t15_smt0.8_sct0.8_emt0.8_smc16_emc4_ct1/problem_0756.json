The sequence is defined in a specific way: for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Additionally, I know that a_{13} = 2016, and I need to find a_1.\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling what geometric and arithmetic sequences mean. In a geometric sequence, each term is a multiple of the previous term by a common ratio. So, for the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, each term is multiplied by some ratio r to get the next term. That means a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r and a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r = a_{2k-1} * r^2.\n\nOn the other hand, in an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a common difference d. So, for the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, each term is obtained by adding d. That gives us a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d and a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d = a_{2k} + 2d.\n\nNow, since the entire sequence is strictly increasing, all these terms must be positive integers, and each term is larger than the previous.\n\nLet me try to express a_{2k+1} in terms of a_{2k-1} from the geometric part: a_{2k+1} = (a_{2k})^2 / a_{2k-1}, since a_{2k} is a multiple of a_{2k-1} by ratio r. So, a_{2k+1} = (a_{2k})^2 / a_{2k-1}.\n\nBut from the arithmetic part, a_{2k+1} is also equal to a_{2k} + d, where d is the common difference. So, we have:\n\na_{2k+1} = a"

Let's rearrange:\n\nd = (a_{2k})^2 / a_{2k-1} - a_{2k}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nd = a_{2k} (a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} - 1)\n\nBut since a_{2k} is a multiple of a_{2k-1}, a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} is just the ratio r. So,\n\nd = a_{2k} (r - 1)\n\nInteresting. So, d is related to the ratio r and the term a_{2k}.\n\nWait, but d must be a constant, right? Or does d vary with k? No, wait, because for every k, the arithmetic sequence condition is applied. But the common difference d in any arithmetic sequence is always a constant. However, in this case, the arithmetic sequence is a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}. So, for each k, the common difference for that particular arithmetic subsequence is d_k, which might be different for different k.\n\nWait, is that correct? Or is d the same for all k? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify that the entire sequence is arithmetic, only that each of these subsequences is arithmetic. So, each of these subsequences can have their own common differences. So, d might depend on k.\n\nBut the problem states that for every positive integer k, the subsequences a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} are geometric, and the subsequences a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} are arithmetic.\n\nSo, in that case, the common difference d in the arithmetic sequence is dependent on k. So, maybe d is the same for each k? Or does it change?\n\nWait, actually, since the entire sequence is strictly increasing, the differences between consecutive terms must be positive.

For example, in the arithmetic subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, the difference between a_{2k+1} and a_{2k} is the same as between a_{2k+2} and a_{2k+1}. So, the difference here is fixed for those three terms, but the difference for the next arithmetic subsequence (starting at a_{2(k+1)} = a_{2k+2}) might be different.\n\nTherefore, the common difference can vary between different arithmetic subsequences. So, each arithmetic subsequence has its own common difference. Therefore, the d in the equation above is actually dependent on k. Let me denote d_k as the common difference for the arithmetic subsequence starting at a_{2k}.\n\nTherefore, for each k, we have:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k,\n\nand\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k = a_{2k} + 2d_k.\n\nSimilarly, from the geometric subsequence:\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r_k,\n\nand\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k = a_{2k-1} * r_k^2,\n\nwhere r_k is the common ratio for the geometric subsequence starting at a_{2k-1}.\n\nTherefore, combining these equations, we can write:\n\nFrom the geometric sequence:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k-1} * r_k^2,\n\nand from the arithmetic sequence:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k = a_{2k-1} * r_k + d_k.\n\nTherefore, setting these equal:\n\na_{2k-1} * r_k^2 = a_{2k-1} * r_k + d_k,\n\nso,\n\nd_k = a_{2k-1} * r_k^2 - a_{2k-1} * r_k = a_{2k-1} * r_k (r_k - 1).\n\nTherefore, d_k is expressed in terms of a_{2k-1} and r_k"
