Hmm, okay. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice the polynomial is a degree 8, which is even, and the exponents seem to be spaced out—so maybe it's a biquadratic or something. Let me write it down again: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Maybe I can substitute \\( y = x^4 \\) to make it easier to handle. Let's try that.\n\nSubstituting \\( y = x^4 \\), the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\). Wait, that's a quadratic equation in \\( y \\). I can solve for \\( y \\) using the quadratic formula. So, \\( y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2} \\). That gives me two solutions: \\( y = 1 \\) and \\( y = -4 \\). \n\nSo, from \\( y = x^4 \\), we have \\( x^4 = 1 \\) and \\( x^4 = -4 \\). Let me consider each case separately.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 = 1 \\). The solutions to this are the 4th roots of unity. That means \\( x = 1, -1, i, -i \\). So, the polynomial \\( x^4 - 1 \\) factors into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - i)(x + i) \\). But since we’re dealing with integer coefficients, I need to factor this into real polynomials. Recall that \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\), and \\( x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) \\). So, altogether, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + "

But over integers, \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible because it doesn't factor into real linear factors with integer coefficients. \n\nNow, the other factor from the substitution was \\( x^4 = -4 \\). Hmm, that's \\( x^4 + 4 = 0 \\). Wait, but in the original equation, when we factor \\( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\), substituting \\( y = x^4 \\) gives \\( (y - 1)(y + 4) \\), so the original polynomial factors as \\( (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4) \\). Wait, hold on, let me check that again. \n\nWait, actually, if \\( y^2 + 3y -4 = (y - 1)(y + 4) \\), so substituting back, the original polynomial factors as \\( (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4) \\). So that's the first step of factoring. \n\nSo now, the problem is to factor each of these factors further into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients. \n\nStarting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\). As I mentioned earlier, that factors into \\( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\), and then \\( x^2 - 1 \\) factors further into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) \\). So, \\( x^4 -1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Now, over integers, \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible because it can't be factored into linear terms with integer coefficients. So those are the factors here. \n\nNow, the other factor is \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm, I need to factor this. I recall that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is a sum of squares, but maybe it can be factored using some formula. Wait, there's a formula for \\( x^4 + 4 \\), which is a special case of the sum of squares. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it can be factored as a biquadratic. Let me try to factor it as a product of quadratics. Suppose \\( x^4 + 4 ="
