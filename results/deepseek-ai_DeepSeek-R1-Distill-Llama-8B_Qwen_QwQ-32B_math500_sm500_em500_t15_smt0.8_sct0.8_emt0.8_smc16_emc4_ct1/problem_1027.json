Then, after factoring, I have to plug in \\(x = 1\\) into each of these factors and sum up their values. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when factoring higher-degree polynomials, it's often helpful to look for patterns or substitutions that can simplify the expression. Looking at \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\), I notice that the exponents are 8, 4, and 0. That makes me think of a substitution where I let \\(y = x^4\\). Let me try that.\n\nSo, if \\(y = x^4\\), then the polynomial becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). That's a quadratic in terms of \\(y\\), which is easier to handle. Let me see if I can factor this quadratic. To factor \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\), I need two numbers that multiply to \\(-4\\) and add up to \\(3\\). Hmm, 4 and -1 work because \\(4 * (-1) = -4\\) and \\(4 + (-1) = 3\\). So, the quadratic factors as \\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\).\n\nSubstituting back \\(y = x^4\\), this gives \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but I feel like I might have missed something since the original polynomial was degree 8 and this gives two quartic polynomials. Let me check my substitution again. Was \\(y^2 + 3y - 4 = (y + 4)(y - 1)\\)? Yes, that's correct. So, substituting back, it's indeed \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\).\n\nBut I remember that \\(x^4 - 1\\) can be factored further. In fact, it's a difference of squares because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and 1 is \\(1^2\\). So, applying the difference of squares formula: \\(a^"

So, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors into:\n\n\\[\n(x^4 + 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x^4 + 4)(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\n\\]\n\nWait, but I should check if all these factors are irreducible over the integers. Let's see:\n\n- \\(x - 1\\) and \\(x + 1\\) are both linear factors, so they can't be factored further.\n- \\(x^2 + 1\\) is irreducible over the integers because it has no real roots and can't be factored into integer polynomials.\n- Now, the tricky part is \\(x^4 + 4\\). Is this irreducible?\n\nI recall that a polynomial is irreducible if it can't be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. Let me check if \\(x^4 + 4\\) is irreducible. Sometimes, higher-degree polynomials like this can be factored as a product of quadratics or linear terms. Let me assume it factors into quadratics: \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)\\). Multiplying these out, I get:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd\n\\]\n\nComparing coefficients with \\(x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4\\), I can set up the following system of equations:\n\n1. \\(a + c = 0\\) (since the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) is 0)\n2. \\(ac + b + d = 0\\) (since the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is 0)\n3. \\(ad + bc = 0\\) (since the coefficient of \\(x\\) is 0)\n4. \\(bd = 4\\)"

So \\(a\\) can't be zero. Therefore, \\(d = b\\).\n\nNow, with \\(d = b\\), let's plug into equation 4: \\(b*d = b^2 = 4\\). So \\(b = \\pm 2\\).
