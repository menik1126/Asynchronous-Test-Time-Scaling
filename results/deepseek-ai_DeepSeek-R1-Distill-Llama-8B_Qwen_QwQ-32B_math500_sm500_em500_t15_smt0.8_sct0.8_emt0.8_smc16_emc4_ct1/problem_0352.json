By adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new counts become (4x + 5) blue marbles and (3x - 3) yellow marbles.\n\nAccording to the problem, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 7:3. I'll set up the equation (4x + 5) / (3x - 3) = 7/3 and solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying gives 3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3). Simplifying this, I get 12x + 15 = 21x - 21.\n\nSubtracting 12x from both sides results in 15 = 9x - 21. Adding 21 to both sides, I find that 36 = 9x, so x = 4.\n\nFinally, the initial number of blue marbles is 4 times x, which is 16.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles initially is \\(4:3\\).\n- After adding \\(5\\) blue marbles and removing \\(3\\) yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes \\(7:3\\).\n\n**Let:**\n- Let the initial number of blue marbles be \\(4x\\).\n- Let the initial number of yellow marbles be \\(3x\\).\n\n**After Adding and Removing Marbles:**\n- Blue marbles: \\(4x + 5\\)\n- Yellow marbles: \\(3x - 3\\)\n\n**New Ratio:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Solving for \\(x\\):**\n1.
