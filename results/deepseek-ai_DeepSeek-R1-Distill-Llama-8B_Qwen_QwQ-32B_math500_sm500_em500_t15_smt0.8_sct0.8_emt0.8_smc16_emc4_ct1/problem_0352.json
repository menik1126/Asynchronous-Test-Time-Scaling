            "output": "I need to solve this marble ratio problem. Let's define the number of blue marbles as \\(4x\\) and the number of yellow marbles as \\(3x\\) since their ratio is 4:3.\n\nIf I add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3. So, the updated quantities are blue marbles: \\(4x + 5\\) and yellow marbles: \\(3x - 3\\).\n\nI'll set up the ratio equation \\(\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\\) and solve for \\(x\\). Cross-multiplying gives \\(3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\\), which simplifies to \\(12x + 15 = 21x - 21\\). Rearranging terms, \\(21x - 12x = 15 + 21\\), so \\(9x = 36\\) and \\(x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, the initial number of blue marbles is \\(4x = 16\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let’s define:**\n- Let the number of blue marbles be \\(4x\\).\n- Let the number of yellow marbles be \\(3x\\).\n\n**Given:**\n1. The initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\(4:3\\).\n2. After adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes \\(7:3\\).\n\n**Step 1:** Express the new quantities after adding and removing marbles.\n- Blue marbles after addition: \\(4x + 5\\)\n- Yellow marbles after removal: \\(3x - 3\\)\n\n**Step 2:** Set up the ratio equation based on the new quantities.\n\\[\n\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.\n\\[\n3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Expand both sides of the equation.\n\\[\n12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\\]\n\n**Step 5:** Rearrange the equation to isolate \\(x\\).\n\\[\n21"
