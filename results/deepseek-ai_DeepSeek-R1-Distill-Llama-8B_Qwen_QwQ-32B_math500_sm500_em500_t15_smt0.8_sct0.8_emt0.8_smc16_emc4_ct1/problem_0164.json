            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me write that down to make sure I have it right. It's √³(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. \n\nAlright, first, cube roots can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that to get rid of a cube root, you cube both sides of the equation. That should help simplify things. So, if I cube both sides, what happens?\n\nLet me try that. So, if I take the left side, (√³(x² - 4x + 4))³, that should just give me x² - 4x + 4, right? Because the cube and the cube root cancel each other out. And on the right side, 16 cubed is... let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16... Hmm, 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. So, adding those together, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, the equation now is x² - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nOkay, so now I have a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it so that it equals zero. Subtract 4096 from both sides. That gives me x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, so the equation is x² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving a quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula, which is (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a). In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Let me plug those values in. So, that would be (-(-4) ± √[(-4)² - 4*1*(-4092)]) / (2*1).\n\nSimplifying the numerator first: -(-4) is 4. Inside the square root, (-4) squared is 16. Then, 4*1*4092 is positive because the last term is negative. So, 16 - 4*1*(-4092) becomes 16"

            "output": " + 16368, which is 16384. So, the square root of 16384. Hmm, what's the square root of 16384? Let me think. 128 squared is 16384 because 128*128 is 16384. Yeah, that's right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the numerator is 4 ± 128, and the denominator is 2. So, we have two solutions: (4 + 128)/2 and (4 - 128)/2.\n\nCalculating the first one: 4 + 128 is 132, divided by 2 is 66. The second one: 4 - 128 is -124, divided by 2 is -62. So, the solutions are x = 66 and x = -62.\n\nBut the question asks for the positive value of x. So, x must be 66. I should probably double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation, I cubed both sides correctly, ended up with a quadratic, solved it using the quadratic formula, and got two solutions. 66 is positive, and -62 is negative, so the positive solution is 66. \n\nWait, let me verify by plugging x = 66 back into the original equation to ensure it works. So, √³(66² - 4*66 + 4). Let's compute the inside first: 66 squared is 4356. Then, 4 times 66 is 264. So, subtracting 264 from 4356 gives 4356 - 264 = 4092. Then, add 4, which gives 4096. The cube root of 4096... Hmm, because 16 cubed is 4096, so √³(4096) is 16. That's exactly the right side of the equation. Perfect, it checks out. So, x = 66 is definitely the correct positive solution.\n\nI think that's all. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the check worked out. So, the answer is 66.\n</think>\n\nThe solution involves cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root, resulting in a quadratic equation. Solving this quadratic using the quadratic formula yields two solutions, with the positive value being 66.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\"
