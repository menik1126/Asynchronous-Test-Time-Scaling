            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, I need to find the positive value of x that satisfies this. Let me see how to approach this. \n\nFirst off, the equation is a cube root on one side, so maybe I can get rid of that by cubing both sides. That usually helps when dealing with roots. So, if I cube both sides, the equation should become (cube root of (x² - 4x + 4))³ equals 16³. \n\nWait, let me write that down properly. So, if I have:\n\n∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nCubing both sides gives:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 16³\n\nOkay, now I need to compute 16 cubed. Let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Let me do 256 times 10 which is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536, so adding those together: 2560 + 1536. Hmm, 2560 + 1000 is 3560, plus 500 is 4060, plus 36 is 4096. So, 16³ is 4096.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\nHmm, okay, so I can subtract 4096 from both sides to set this up as a quadratic equation. Let me do that.\n\nx² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\nSimplify that:\n\nx² - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\nSo now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. I need to solve for x. Since it's a quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula. \n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a). Here, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Let me plug those values in.\n\nFirst, let's compute the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac. So, b is -4, so b squared is (-4)² which is 16"

            "output": ". Then, 4ac is 4 * 1 * (-4092), which is 4 * (-4092). Let me calculate that.\n\n4 times 4000 is 16000, and 4 times 92 is 368, so 16000 + 368 is 16368. So, 4ac is -16368. Therefore, the discriminant is 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, so 16 + 16368 is 16384.\n\nSo, sqrt(16384). Hmm, I need to figure out what number squared gives 16384. Let me think. 128 squared is 16384 because 128 * 128. Wait, let me check that. 100 squared is 10000, 120 squared is 14400, so 128 squared: 128 * 128. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n128 * 100 = 12800\n\n128 * 28 = ?\n\n128 * 20 = 2560\n\n128 * 8 = 1024\n\nSo 2560 + 1024 = 3584\n\nSo 128 * 128 = 12800 + 3584 = 16384. Yep, that's right. So sqrt(16384) is 128.\n\nSo, plugging back into the quadratic formula: x = [ -(-4) ± 128 ] / (2*1), which is x = [4 ± 128]/2.\n\nSo, that gives two solutions: one where we add 4 and 128, and another where we subtract. So:\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66\n\nSecond solution: (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62\n\nBut the problem asks for the positive value of x, so 66 is our answer. \n\nLet me just quickly check if that makes sense. Plug x = 66 back into the original equation.\n\nCompute x² - 4x + 4 when x=66.\n\n66 squared: 66 * 66. Let me compute that. 60*60=3600, 60*6=360, 6*60=360, 6*6=36. So, 3600 + 360 + 360 +36 = 4336.\n\nSo, 66² is 4356? Wait"

            "output": ", wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, 66 * 66 can be considered as (70 - 4)^2 which is 70² - 2*70*4 + 4² = 4900 - 560 + 16 = 4900 - 560 is 4340, plus 16 is 4356. So, 66 squared is 4356.\n\nThen, subtract 4x: 4 * 66 = 264, so 4356 - 264 = 4092.\n\nThen add 4: 4092 + 4 = 4096.\n\nSo the cube root of 4096 is indeed 16, since 16³ is 4096. So, that checks out.\n\nNow, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the process. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation: ∛(x² - 4x +4) = 16\n\nCubed both sides: x² -4x +4 = 16³ = 4096\n\nThen, subtract 4096: x² -4x +4 -4096 = 0 → x² -4x -4092 =0\n\nQuadratic formula: x = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 16368)] /2 = [4 ± sqrt(16384)]/2 = [4 ±128]/2\n\nGives x=66 and x=-62. Positive solution is 66.\n\nSeems correct. I think that's right. So, yeah, 66 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is a cube root equal to 16. By cubing both sides, we eliminate the cube root and obtain a quadratic equation. Solving the quadratic using the quadratic formula yields two solutions, and the positive one is 66.\n\n\\boxed{66}"
