            "output": "To simplify the given expression, I'll start by examining each term separately.\n\nFirst, consider the term \u221a2. To combine this with the other terms, I'll express it as (2\u221a2)/2. This allows all subsequent terms to have a common denominator.\n\nNext, I'll address the term 1/\u221a2. Rationalizing the denominator, this becomes \u221a2/2.\n\nMoving on to \u221a3, I'll express it as (3\u221a3)/3 to match the common denominator established earlier.\n\nFinally, I'll rationalize 1/\u221a3, resulting in \u221a3/3.\n\nAfter converting all terms to have the same denominator, I can combine them into a single fraction: (2\u221a2 + \u221a2 + 3\u221a3 + \u221a3)/2.\n\nCombining like terms, this simplifies to (3\u221a2 + 4\u221a3)/2.\n\nHere, the values of a, b, and c are 3, 4, and 2, respectively. Adding these together gives a total of 9.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) and express it in the form \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3}}{c}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express each term with a common denominator:**\n   \n   - \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) can be rationalized to \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n   - \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) can be rationalized to \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Combine all terms over the common denominator \\(2\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{3\\sqrt"
