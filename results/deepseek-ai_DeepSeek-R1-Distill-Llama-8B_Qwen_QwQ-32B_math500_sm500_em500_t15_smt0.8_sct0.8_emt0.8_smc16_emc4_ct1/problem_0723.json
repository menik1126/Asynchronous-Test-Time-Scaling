            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve, and I need to figure out the value of x. The problem gives me two logarithmic equations:\n\nFirst, log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2.\n\nSecond, log base y of 5x equals 2.\n\nHmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but let me try to break them down step by step.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2.\n\nI remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So, log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(ac). Applying that here:\n\nlog₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nNow, the argument inside the logarithm simplifies because (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, which equals x² - y². So, the equation becomes:\n\nlog₆(x² - y²) = 2.\n\nTo get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that here:\n\n6² = x² - y².\n\nCalculating 6 squared, that's 36. So,\n\n36 = x² - y².\n\nAlright, so that's the first equation simplified. Let me note that down as equation (1):\n\n1) x² - y² = 36.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2.\n\nAgain, I'll try to convert this logarithmic equation into its exponential form. Using the same principle as before, log_y(a) = c means y^c = a. So, applying this:\n\ny² = 5x.\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n2) y² = 5x.\n\nHmm, so now I have two equations:\n\n1) x² - y² = 36.\n\n2) y² = 5x.\n\nI can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to find x. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation (2), y² is equal to 5x. So, substituting into equation (1):\n\nx² - (5x) = 36.\n\nSimpl"

            "output": "ifying that:\n\nx² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in terms of x: x² -5x -36 = 0. I need to solve for x. Let me try to factor this quadratic.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see:\n\nFactors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nLooking for a pair that would subtract to give -5 when one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nWait, maybe 4 and 9. If I have 4 and -9, 4 * (-9) = -36, and 4 + (-9) = -5. Yes, that fits.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as:\n\n(x + 4)(x - 9) = 0.\n\nSo, setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx + 4 = 0 => x = -4.\n\nx - 9 = 0 => x = 9.\n\nSo, the solutions are x = -4 and x = 9.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if these solutions make sense in the original equations, because logarithms have domain restrictions. Specifically, the arguments of the logarithms must be positive.\n\nLooking back at the first equation: log₆(x - y) and log₆(x + y) must be defined, which requires that (x - y) > 0 and (x + y) > 0.\n\nAlso, in the second equation, log_y(5x) must have y > 0 and y ≠ 1, and 5x > 0.\n\nSo, let's check each solution.\n\nFirst, x = -4.\n\nFrom equation (2): y² = 5*(-4) = -20.\n\nWait, y² equals a negative number? That's impossible because a square of a real number can't be negative. So, y² = -20 has no real solution, which means x = -4 is not a valid solution.\n\nSo, we discard x = -4.\n\nNow, check x = 9.\n\nFrom equation (2): y² = 5*9 = 45.\n\nSo, y² = 45, which means y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45)."

Good.\n\nCompute x + y ≈ 9 + 6.7082 ≈ 15.7082 > 0. Good.\n\nNow, check if the original logarithmic equation holds. Let's compute log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) and see if it equals 2.\n\nCompute log₆(2.2918) + log₆(15.7082).\n\nAlternatively, using the product form:\n\nlog₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = log₆(x² - y²) = log₆(36) = 2, since 6² = 36. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let's also check for y = -√45, just to be thorough.\n\nIf y = -√45 ≈ -6.7082.\n\nCompute x - y ≈ 9 - (-6.7082) ≈ 15.7082 > 0.\n\nCompute x + y ≈ 9 + (-6.7082) ≈ 2.2918 > 0.\n\nSo, in both cases, (x - y) and (x + y) are positive, so the logarithms are defined.\n\nNow, let's check the second equation: log_y(5x). For y = √45 and y = -√45.\n\nFirst, for y = √45:\n\nlog_{√45}(5*9) = log_{√45}(45) = ?\n\nRecall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, (√45)^2 = 45. So, 2 = 45? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no:\n\nWait, no, the log is log_{√45}(45). So, let's compute it differently.\n\nLet me set it equal to 2:\n\nlog_{√45}(45) = 2.\n\nWhich implies that (√45)^2 = 45. Indeed, (√45"

            "output": ")^2 is 45, so that's correct. So that works.\n\nNow, for y = -√45:\n\nWait, but the base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1. Here, y = -√45 is negative, which is invalid because the base of a logarithm must be positive. So, y must be positive. Therefore, y = -√45 is invalid. So, only y = √45 is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the valid solution is x = 9 and y = √45.\n\nWait, but the question only asks for x, so x is 9. Let me just confirm once again.\n\nWait, let me check the second equation again with y = √45 and x =9.\n\nlog_y(5x) = log_{√45}(45). Let me compute that.\n\nLet me write log_{√45}(45) as log_{45^{1/2}}(45). Using the logarithm power identity: log_{a^b}(c) = (1/b) log_a(c).\n\nSo, log_{45^{1/2}}(45) = (1/(1/2)) * log_{45}(45) = 2 * 1 = 2. Which matches the equation. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, x = 9 is the valid solution.\n\nSo, after going through all the steps, checking the domains, and ensuring that the solutions satisfy both equations, the answer is x = 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nStarting with the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\).\n\nUsing the logarithm property \\(\\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (ac)\\), we combine the logs:\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\n\\]\nConverting to exponential form:\n\\[\n6^2 = x^2 - y^2 \\implies 36 = x^2 - y^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\nFor the second equation: \\(\\"
