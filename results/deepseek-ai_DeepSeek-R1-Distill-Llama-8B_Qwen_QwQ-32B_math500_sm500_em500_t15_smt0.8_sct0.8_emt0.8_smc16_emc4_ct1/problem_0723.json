            "output": "Alright, so I've got this logarithm problem to solve. It says:\n\nIf log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then find x.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. First, I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's the same as taking the log of the product of their arguments. So, log_b a + log_b c = log_b (a*c). That should help simplify the first equation.\n\nSo, starting with the first equation: log_6 (x - y) + log_6 (x + y) = 2.\n\nApplying the logarithm addition rule, this becomes log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nHmm, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, so that factors into x squared minus y squared. So, log_6 (x² - y²) = 2.\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that log_b a = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, 6^2 = x² - y².\n\n6 squared is 36, so 36 = x² - y². I'll write that down as equation (1): x² - y² = 36.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second equation: log_y (5x) = 2.\n\nAgain, converting this from logarithmic to exponential form, this means y^2 = 5x.\n\nSo, y squared equals 5 times x. I'll note that as equation (2): y² = 5x.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) x² - y² = 36\n\n2) y² = 5x\n\nMaybe I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1). Since y² is 5x, plugging that into x² - y² gives x² - 5x = 36.\n\nSo, now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nTo solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula. The standard form is ax² + bx + c = 0, so here a=1, b=-5, c=-"

            "output": "36.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values: x = [5 ± sqrt(25 + 144)] / 2.\n\nWait, because b squared is (-5)^2 = 25, and 4ac is 4*1*(-36) = -144. So, the discriminant is 25 + 144 = 169, whose square root is 13.\n\nSo, x = [5 ± 13]/2.\n\nThis gives two solutions: (5 + 13)/2 = 18/2 = 9, and (5 - 13)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4.\n\nHmm, x can be 9 or -4. But I need to check if these solutions make sense in the original logarithmic equations because logarithms have domain restrictions.\n\nIn the first equation, log_6 (x - y) and log_6 (x + y) must have positive arguments. So, x - y > 0 and x + y > 0.\n\nAlso, since we have log_y (5x), the base y must be positive and not equal to 1, and the argument 5x must be positive. Moreover, since y is the base of a logarithm, it must be positive and not 1.\n\nSo, let's consider x=9 first.\n\nFrom equation (2), y² = 5x. If x=9, then y² = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But y must be positive because it's the base of a logarithm. So, y = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, let's check the domain for the first equation: x - y > 0 and x + y > 0.\n\nPlugging in x=9 and y=3√5:\n\nx - y = 9 - 3√5 ≈ 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292 > 0. Good.\n\nx + y = 9 + 3√5 ≈ 9 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708 > 0. Good.\n\nSo, x=9 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check x=-4.\n\nFrom equation (2), y² = 5*(-4) = -20. But y² cannot be negative since squaring any"

            "output": " real number gives a non-negative result. So y² = -20 is impossible, which means x=-4 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=9.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I should ensure that y is defined. For x=9, y is 3√5, which is positive and not equal to 1, so that's fine.\n\nAlso, checking if the original logarithmic equations hold.\n\nFor the first equation, log_6 (9 - 3√5) + log_6 (9 + 3√5). Let me compute (9 - 3√5)(9 + 3√5) = 81 - (3√5)^2 = 81 - 9*5 = 81 - 45 = 36. So, log_6 (36) = 2, which matches the equation.\n\nFor the second equation, log_{3√5} (5*9) = log_{3√5} 45. Since (3√5)^2 = 9*5 = 45, so log_{3√5} 45 = 2, which also matches.\n\nSo yes, x=9 is correct.\n\nI think that's it.
