            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number w, which is the result of rotating z around c by \u03c0/4 radians (which is 45 degrees) counter-clockwise. Hmm, complex numbers can be a bit tricky, especially when it comes to rotations and transformations. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given information:\n\n- z = 2 + \u221a2 - (3 + 3\u221a2)i\n- c = 2 - 3i\n\nSo, z is a complex number in the form a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. Similarly, c is also given in the form a + bi.\n\nI recall that rotating a complex number around another complex number involves translating the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, rotating the point, and then translating back. Let me try to remember the exact steps.\n\nI think the formula for rotating a point z around a point c by an angle \u03b8 is:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^{i\u03b8}\n\nYes, that sounds right. Here, e^{i\u03b8} is the rotation factor in the complex plane. Since \u03b8 is \u03c0/4, e^{i\u03c0/4} can be written using Euler's formula as cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4). Cos(\u03c0/4) and sin(\u03c0/4) are both \u221a2/2, so e^{i\u03c0/4} = \u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, if I can express (z - c), multiply it by e^{i\u03c0/4}, and then add c back, I should get w. Let me write that out.\n\nFirst, let's compute (z - c). Given z = 2 + \u221a2 - (3 + 3\u221a2)i and c = 2 - 3i, subtracting c from z would be:\n\nz - c = (2 + \u221a2 - (3 + 3\u221a2)i) - (2 - 3i)\n\nLet me do the subtraction term by term:\n\nReal parts: 2 + \u221a2 - 2 = \u221a2\n\nImaginary parts: - (3 + 3\u221a2)i - (-3i) = -3i - 3\u221a2 i + 3i = (-3i + 3i"

            "output": ") - 3\u221a2 i = 0 - 3\u221a2 i = -3\u221a2 i\n\nSo, z - c = \u221a2 - 3\u221a2 i\n\nHmm, wait, let me double-check that. When subtracting complex numbers, it's (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i.\n\nSo, real parts: 2 + \u221a2 - 2 = \u221a2\n\nImaginary parts: (-3 - 3\u221a2) - (-3) = (-3 - 3\u221a2) + 3 = -3\u221a2\n\nAh, yes, that's correct. So z - c = \u221a2 - 3\u221a2 i.\n\nSo, now we have to multiply this by e^{i\u03c0/4} = (\u221a2/2) + i(\u221a2/2). Let's denote that as e^{i\u03c0/4} = e, so e = \u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2.\n\nSo, (z - c) * e = (\u221a2 - 3\u221a2 i) * (\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2)\n\nI need to multiply these two complex numbers. Let me distribute the multiplication:\n\n(\u221a2)*(\u221a2/2) + (\u221a2)*(i\u221a2/2) - (3\u221a2 i)*(\u221a2/2) - (3\u221a2 i)*(i\u221a2/2)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: \u221a2 * \u221a2 / 2 = (2)/2 = 1\n\nSecond term: \u221a2 * i\u221a2 / 2 = (2i)/2 = i\n\nThird term: -3\u221a2 i * \u221a2 / 2 = -3*(2)/2 i = -3i\n\nFourth term: -3\u221a2 i * i\u221a2 / 2 = -3*(2)*(i^2)/2 = -3*2*(-1)/2 = +3\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify each term:\n\nFirst term: (\u221a2)(\u221a2/2) = (2)/2 = 1\n\nSecond term: (\u221a2)(i\u221a2/2) = (i * 2)/2 = i\n\nThird term: (-3\u221a2 i)(\u221a2/2) = (-3 * (\u221a2 * \u221a2"
