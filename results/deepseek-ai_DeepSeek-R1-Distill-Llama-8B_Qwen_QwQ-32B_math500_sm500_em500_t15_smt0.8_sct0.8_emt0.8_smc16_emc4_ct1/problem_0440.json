Since this is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find the number of terms.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of the sequence using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is (n/2) multiplied by the sum of the first and last terms. This will give me the total sum of the sequence.\n\nAfter finding the total sum, I'll divide it by 7 to find the remainder when the sum is divided by 7. This involves performing the division and identifying the remainder from the division result.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 197 + 199\\) is divided by 7, follow these steps:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\textbf{Step 1: Identify the number of terms in the sequence.} \\\\\n&\\text{The sequence is an arithmetic progression with the first term \\(a_1 = 1\\) and common difference \\(d = 2\\).} \\\\\n&\\text{The last term } a_n = 199. \\\\\n&\\text{Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:} \\\\\n&\\quad a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\\\\n&\\quad 199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n&\\quad 199 - 1 = (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n&\\quad 198 = 2(n - 1) \\\\\n&\\quad n - 1 = 99 \\\\\n&\\quad n = 100 \\\\\n&\\textbf{There are 100 terms in the sequence.}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\textbf{Step 2: Calculate the sum of the sequence.} \\\\\n&\\text{The sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic progression is given by:} \\\\\n&\\quad S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\\\\n&\\quad S = \\frac{100}{2} \\times (1 + 199) \\\\\n&\\quad S"
