            "output": "First, I need to identify the sequence of numbers being added. It starts at 1 and increases by 2 each time, continuing up to 199. This means the sequence is all the odd numbers from 1 to 199.\n\nNext, I'll determine how many terms are in this sequence. Since the last term is 199 and the common difference is 2, the number of terms \\( n \\) can be found using the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence: \\( a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\).\n\nPlugging in the values: \\( 199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\). Solving for \\( n \\), I get \\( n = 100 \\).\n\nNow, to find the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers, I recall that the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is \\( n^2 \\). Therefore, the sum of the first 100 odd numbers is \\( 100^2 = 10,000 \\).\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 7, I'll compute \\( 10,000 \\div 7 \\). The remainder is the result of subtracting the largest multiple of 7 less than 10,000 from 10,000. After performing the division, the remainder is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum of the sequence \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\) is divided by 7, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   - This is the sequence of odd numbers starting from 1 up to 199.\n   - The common difference between consecutive terms is 2.\n\n2. **Find the Number of Terms (\\(n\\)):**\n   - The \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(a_1 = 1\\), \\(d = 2\\), and \\(a_n = 199\\).\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     198 = 2"
