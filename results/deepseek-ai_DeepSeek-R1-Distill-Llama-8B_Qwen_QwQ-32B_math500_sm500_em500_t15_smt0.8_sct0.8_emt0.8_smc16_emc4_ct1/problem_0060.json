            "output": "To find which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders, I'll calculate the ratio of males to females for each grade.\n\nStarting with the 9th grade: 41.1% males and 39.4% females. The ratio of males to females is 41.1 / 39.4, which is approximately 1.04. To find out how close this is to 135%, I'll calculate 1.04 / 1.35, resulting in about 0.77, meaning 77% of 135%.\n\nNext, for the 10th grade: 34.4% males and 33.1% females. The ratio is 34.4 / 33.1, which is roughly 1.04. Again, dividing this by 1.35 gives approximately 0.77, so it's also 77% of 135%.\n\nMoving to the 11th grade: 20.6% males and 13.8% females. The ratio is 20.6 / 13.8, which is about 1.49. Dividing by 1.35 yields around 1.10, indicating it's 110% of 135%.\n\nFinally, for the 12th grade: 11.6% males and 8.6% females. The ratio is 11.6 / 8.6, which is approximately 1.35. Dividing this by 1.35 equals exactly 1, meaning it's 100% of 135%.\n\nComparing all these percentages, the 12th grade is closest to having male bus riders equal to 135% of female riders.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to \\(135\\%\\) of the number of female bus riders, we'll analyze each grade:\n\n1. **For each grade**, calculate the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders.\n2. **Express** the ratio as a percentage of \\(135\\%\\) to see how close it is.\n\nLet's go through each grade step by step.\n\n### 1. **9th Grade**\n- **Males**: \\(41.1\\%\\)\n- **Females**: \\(39.4\\%\\)\n  \n\\[\n\\text{Ratio of males to females} = \\frac{41.1}{39.4}"
