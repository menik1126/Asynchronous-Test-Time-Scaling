This means Yann has 10 possible choices, and Camille has 9 remaining choices because she cannot select the same dish as Yann.\n\nBy multiplying the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has, I calculate the total number of valid combinations. Therefore, the total number of different meal combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order, given that they refuse to order the same dish. \n\n1. **Total Dishes Available:** There are **10** dishes on the menu.\n   \n2. **Yann's Choices:** Yann can choose any of the **10** dishes.\n\n3. **Camille's Choices:** After Yann has chosen, Camille has **9** remaining dishes to choose from (since she cannot order the same dish as Yann).\n\n4. **Total Combinations:** \n   - For each dish Yann chooses, Camille has **9** options.\n   - Therefore, the total number of combinations is **10 × 9 = 90**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{90}\\)"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
