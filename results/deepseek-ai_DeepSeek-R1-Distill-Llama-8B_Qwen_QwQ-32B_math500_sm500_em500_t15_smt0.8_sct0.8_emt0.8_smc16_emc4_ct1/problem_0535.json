            "output": "First, I recognize that there are 10 different dishes available on the menu.\n\nSince Yann and Camille each want to order one dish, I need to determine the number of possible combinations where they do not choose the same dish.\n\nI'll start by calculating the total number of possible combinations without any restrictions, which is 10 multiplied by 10, giving 100 possible combinations.\n\nHowever, this includes the scenarios where both Yann and Camille order the same dish. There are 10 such scenarios, one for each dish.\n\nTo find the number of valid combinations where they order different dishes, I'll subtract the 10 identical combinations from the total 100, resulting in 90 possible combinations.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nYann and Camille are going to a restaurant that has 10 items on the menu. Each of them will order one dish. \n- They refuse to order the same dish.\n- It matters who orders what, so Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Total Number of Possible Combinations (Without Restrictions):**\n   - Since there are 10 dishes on the menu, Yann has 10 choices.\n   - For each choice of Yann, Camille also has 10 choices.\n   - **Total Combinations Without Restrictions:** \\( 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\)\n\n2. **Number of Invalid Combinations (Where Both Order the Same Dish):**\n   - There are 10 dishes. \n   - If both Yann and Camille order the same dish, there are **10** such cases.\n   - **Invalid Combinations:** 10\n\n3. **Number of Valid Combinations (Where They Order Different Dishes):**\n   - **Valid Combinations:** **Total Combinations - Invalid Combinations**\n   - \\( 100 - 10 = 90 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
