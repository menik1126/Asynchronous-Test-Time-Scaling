Since \\(2^8 = 256\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the exponent rule of raising a power to a power: \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these step-by-step instructions:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a Power of 2**:\n   \n   Recognize that \\(256 = 2^8\\). Therefore,\n   \\[\n   256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Exponent Rule**:\n   \n   Use the property \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\):\n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\)**:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{2}\\)"
