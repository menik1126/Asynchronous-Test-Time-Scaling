I need to compute \\( \\tan A \\). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the area of a triangle. I remember there are a few formulas. One common one is \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin C \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are two sides, and \\( C \\) is the included angle between them. Alternatively, there's Heron's formula, but that involves all three sides and might be more complicated. Since the problem gives the area in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), maybe the first formula will be more useful here.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, side \\( a \\) is opposite angle \\( A \\), side \\( b \\) is opposite angle \\( B \\), and side \\( c \\) is opposite angle \\( C \\). So, if I use the formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\), because sides \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are adjacent to angle \\( A \\), right? So that could be helpful.\n\nThe problem says the area is \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). Let me write that down:\n\n\\( \\text{Area} = a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\)\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, \\( (b - c)^2 \\) is \\( b^2 - 2bc + c^2 \\). So,\n\n\\( a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \\)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc \\)\n\nHmm, okay. So the area is \\( a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc \\). Now, from the area formula in terms of angle \\( A \\), which is \\( \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\), so:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}bc"

Maybe I can rearrange this equation to solve for \\( \\sin A \\) and then find \\( \\tan A \\) from it.\n\nLet me move all terms to one side:\n\n\\( a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc - \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = 0 \\)\n\nBut that might not be the most helpful approach. Perhaps I should express \\( a^2 \\) in terms of the other sides and the angles. Wait, I remember the Law of Cosines, which states that \\( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\). Maybe I can substitute that into the equation.\n\nSo, substitute \\( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\) into the area:\n\n\\( \\text{Area} = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc \\)\n\nSimplify this:\n\nExpand the first term: \\( b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc \\)\n\nSo, \\( b^2 - b^2 \\) cancels out, \\( c^2 - c^2 \\) cancels out, leaving:\n\n\\( -2bc \\cos A + 2bc \\)\n\nFactor out \\( 2bc \\):\n\n\\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\)\n\nSo now, the area is \\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\). But from the problem, we also have that the area is \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\), which we expanded earlier to \\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\). Wait, so both expressions are equal to the area, so I can set them equal to each other. But actually, I used the Law of Cosines substitution and ended up with the same expression. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly."

Therefore, equating these two expressions:\n\n\\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\)\n\nHmm, okay, this equation should let me solve for \\( \\sin A \\) and \\( \\cos A \\).\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n\\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\)\n\nFirst, I can divide both sides by \\( bc \\), assuming \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are non-zero, which they are in a triangle.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by \\( bc \\):\n\n\\( 2(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin A \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\( 4(1 - \\cos A) = \\sin A \\)\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n\\( 4(1 - \\cos A) = \\sin A \\)\n\nThis is an equation involving \\( \\sin A \\) and \\( \\cos A \\).
