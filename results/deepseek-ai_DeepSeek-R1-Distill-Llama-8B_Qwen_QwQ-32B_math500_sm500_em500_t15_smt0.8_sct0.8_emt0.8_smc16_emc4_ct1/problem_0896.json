Multiplying these together, the denominator becomes 4 times 78125, which is 312500.\n\nNow, the fraction is 21 over 312500. To convert this to a decimal, I'll divide 21 by 312500.\n\nPerforming the division, 21 divided by 312500 equals 0.0000672.\n\nFinally, I'll round the result to four decimal places, which is 0.00007.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\( \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Denominator:**\n   - Calculate \\( 2^2 = 4 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 5^7 = 78125 \\).\n   - Multiply them together: \\( 4 \\times 78125 = 312500 \\).\n\n   So, the fraction becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{312500}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     21 \\div 312500 = 0.0000672\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Round to an Appropriate Number of Decimal Places:**\n   - Since the denominator has 6 zeros, you typically round to 6 decimal places.\n   - However, in many practical cases, fewer decimal places can be used.\n\n   Rounding \\( 0.0000672 \\) to **4 decimal places** gives:\n   \\[\n   0.00007\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.00007}\n\\]"
