            "output": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we're given that n is congruent to 2 modulo 7. That means when n is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. So, n ≡ 2 mod 7.\n\nThe problem is asking for the remainder when the product (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7. Hmm, okay. So, I need to calculate (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) mod 7.\n\nSince n ≡ 2 mod 7, I can substitute 2 in place of n for each term. Let me write that out:\n\nFirst, n + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 mod 7.\n\nNext, n + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 = 6 mod 7.\n\nThen, n + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 = 8 mod 7. Now, 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so that's 1 mod 7.\n\nSo, now we have the product of 4, 6, and 1 modulo 7. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 4 and 6: 4 * 6 = 24. Then, 24 mod 7. Well, 7*3=21, so 24 - 21 = 3. So, 24 ≡ 3 mod 7.\n\nNow, multiply that result by the next term, which is 1: 3 * 1 = 3. So, 3 mod 7 is still 3.\n\nWait a minute, does that mean the remainder is 3? Hmm, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify each step differently. Let me compute each term again.\n\nn + 2: 2 + 2 = 4, which is 4 mod 7.\n\nn + 4: 2 + 4 = 6, which is 6 mod 7.\n\nn + 6: 2 + 6 = 8, which is 1 mod 7.\n\nSo, the product is 4 * 6 * 1. Let's compute 4 * 6 first: 4 * 6 is 24, and 24 mod 7 is"

            "output": " 3 because 7*3=21, so 24 -21=3. Then, 3 * 1 is 3. So, the result is 3.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to use properties of modular arithmetic. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, we can express n as 7k + 2, where k is some integer. Then, substitute into (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6):\n\nn + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4.\n\nn + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6.\n\nn + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8 = 7k + 1 (since 8 mod 7 is 1).\n\nSo, the product becomes (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 1). Now, each term is a multiple of 7 plus some constant. When we multiply these, each term will be a multiple of 7, and we're looking for the remainder when divided by 7.\n\nBut when you multiply terms of the form (7k + a)(7m + b)(7n + c), all terms will have a factor of 7 except the last term, which is a*b*c. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, maybe I should expand the product step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply (7k + 4)(7k + 6):\n\n= (7k)(7k) + 7k*6 + 4*7k + 4*6\n\n= 49k² + 42k + 28k + 24\n\n= 49k² + 70k + 24.\n\nNow, 49k² is divisible by 7, 70k is also divisible by 7, so when mod 7 is applied, those terms become 0. So, (7k + 4)(7k + 6) ≡ 24 mod 7.\n\n24 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 3, so 24 ≡ 3 mod 7. So, (7k + 4)(7k + 6) ≡ 3 mod 7.\n\nNow,"

So, 3 * 1 = 3 mod 7.\n\nSo, that gives the same result as before, 3 mod 7. So, the remainder is 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without expanding. Since we know n ≡ 2 mod 7, then (n + 2) ≡ 4, (n +4) ≡6, (n +6)≡1 mod7. So, the product is 4×6×1 mod7. Let me compute 4×6 first: 24 mod7 is 3, then 3×1 is 3. Yep, same answer.\n\nHmm, so seems like the remainder is 3. Wait, but let me check with an example. Let me pick a number n that is 2 mod7. Let's choose n=2. Then compute (2+2)(2+4)(2+6)=4×6×8. Wait, 4×6 is 24, 24×8=192. Now divide 192 by7. Let's see, 7×27=189, so 192-189=3. So remainder 3. That matches.\n\nAnother example: n=9 (since 9 mod7 is 2). Then (9+2)=11, (9+4)=13, (9+6)=15. The product is 11×13×15. Let's compute mod7 each term first:\n\n11 mod7 is 4, 13 mod7 is 6, 15 mod7 is 1. So again 4×6×1=24 mod7=3. Alternatively, compute the product first: 11×13=143, 143×15=2145. Divide by7: 7×306=2142, so 2145-2142=3. Yep, remainder 3 again.\n\nAnother test: n=16 (16 mod7 is"

Now, 7920 divided by7: 7×1131=7917, remainder 3. Yep, same.\n\nSo, seems consistent, the remainder is 3 when (n+2)(n+4)(n+6) is divided by7 given that n≡2 mod7.\n</think>\n\nThe problem gives that \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\) and asks for the remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7.\n\n1.
