The goal is to find the volume of the original cube.\n\nSince the sphere is formed by cutting off the cube's corners, each corner cut is a small octant of a sphere. The radius of the sphere is 3 inches, so the diameter is 6 inches.\n\nTo find the side length of the cube, I can use the relationship between the sphere's radius and the cube's side length. Each corner cut removes a segment of the cube's edge, and since there are 8 corners, the total length removed from each edge is 2 times the radius, which is 6 inches.\n\nTherefore, the side length of the cube must be 6 inches plus twice the radius, totaling 12 inches.\n\nFinally, the volume of the cube is calculated by cubing its side length, which gives 12\u00b3 = 1728 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given a cube from which metal is removed to form a steel sphere with a radius of 3 inches. The task is to find the volume of the original cube.\n\n1. **Understanding the Shape:**\n   - **Steel Sphere:** When metal is removed from the corners of a cube, each corner is effectively cut off, forming an eighth (or octant) of a sphere from each corner of the cube.\n   - **Radius of the Sphere:** Given that the radius (\\( r \\)) of the sphere is 3 inches, the diameter of the sphere is \\( 2r = 6 \\) inches.\n\n2. **Relating the Sphere to the Cube:**\n   - **Octant of a Sphere:** Each corner of the cube is replaced by an eighth of a sphere with radius 3 inches.\n   - **Edge Length of the Cube:** To ensure that the sphere fits perfectly within the cube's corners, the edge length (\\( a \\)) of the cube must be related to the sphere's radius.\n   - **Calculation:** \n     - Since the sphere is formed by cutting off each corner, the edge length of the cube is equal to the sphere's diameter plus twice the sphere's radius (because the radius extends to both ends of the edge from the corner).\n     - \\( a = 2r + 2r = 4r \\)\n     - Substituting the given radius"
