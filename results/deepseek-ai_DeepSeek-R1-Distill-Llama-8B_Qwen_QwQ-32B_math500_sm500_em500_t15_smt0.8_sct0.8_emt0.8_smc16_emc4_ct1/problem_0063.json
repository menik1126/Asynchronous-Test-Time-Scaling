            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about bus riders at Central H.S. They surveyed 300 males and 300 females in each grade, and I need to figure out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find out how many males and females in each grade actually ride the bus. The table gives the percentages, so I can calculate the numbers by applying these percentages to the total surveyed, which is 300 students per grade.\n\nLet me start with the 9th grade. The males are 41.1%, so I can calculate that as 41.1% of 300. Similarly, females are 39.4%, so I do the same for them. Let me write that down.\n\nFor 9th grade:\n- Male bus riders = 41.1% * 300\n- Female bus riders = 39.4% * 300\n\nCalculating those:\n- 41.1 * 300 = 12,330\n- 39.4 * 300 = 11,820\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If males are 41.1%, they should be more than females. Let me double-check. 300 * 0.411 is indeed 123.0, so 123 students? Wait, no, 300 * 0.411 is 123.0, but since each percentage is per student, 300 students would mean 300 * 41.1% is 300 * 0.411 = 123 males. Similarly, 300 * 0.394 = 300 * 0.394 is 118.2, which would be 118 females.\n\nWait, but the problem says 300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed. So I think that means 300 students total? Or is it 300 males and 300 females in each grade, making 600 students per grade? Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, the problem says \"300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed.\" So that would be 600 students per grade. So each grade has 600 students: 300 males and 300 females. Then the percentages are calculated from those 600. So, for each grade, males and females are 300 each.\n\nSo"

So my initial calculation was correct except I messed up the decimal points. Let me recalculate:\n\n9th grade males: 41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300 = 123.3\n9th grade females: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300 = 118.2\n\nOkay, so those are the numbers. But since we can't have a fraction of a person, maybe they just want us to use the exact percentages and not worry about rounding? The question says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders.\" So maybe we can just use the exact values even if they are decimals.\n\nSo the question is asking for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders. So for each grade, we need to compute (Male riders) / (Female riders) and see which one is closest to 1.35 (since 135% is 1.35 times).\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute (Male riders) divided by (Female riders) and see which is closest to 1.35. Alternatively, compute the difference between (Male riders) and 1.35*(Female riders), and see which has the smallest difference.\n\nEither way, let's see. Let me try the ratio approach first.\n\nSo for each grade, compute (Male % / Female %) and see which is closest to 1.35? Wait, no, because the actual numbers are (Male % * 300) and (Female % * 300). So the ratio would be (Male % / Female %), since the 300 cancels out. Wait, actually, the ratio of the numbers is (0.411 * 300) / (0.394 * 300) = 0.411 / 0.394 ≈ 1.043. So the ratio is just the ratio of the percentages. So actually, the ratio of male riders to female riders is the same as the"

So the difference is 0.002.\n\nSo, the smallest difference is 0.002 in grade 12.\n\nSo grade12 is closer to 135%, but wait, the actual number of male riders is 11.6% *300= 3460, and female is 8.6%*300=2580.\n\nSo male is 3460, which is 3460 /2580≈1.348, which is about 1.35, just slightly less.\n\nWait, 3460 /2580 is exactly 1.34835...
