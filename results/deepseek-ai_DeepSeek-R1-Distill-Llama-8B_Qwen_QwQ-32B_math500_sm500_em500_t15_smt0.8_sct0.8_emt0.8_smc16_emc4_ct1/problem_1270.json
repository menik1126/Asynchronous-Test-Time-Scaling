Since \\(2^8 = 256\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the exponent rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\) to simplify the right side. This gives me \\(2^{2x} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, both sides of the equation have the same base, so I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[\n2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Express 256 as a Power of 2**\nWe know that \\(256 = 2^8\\).
