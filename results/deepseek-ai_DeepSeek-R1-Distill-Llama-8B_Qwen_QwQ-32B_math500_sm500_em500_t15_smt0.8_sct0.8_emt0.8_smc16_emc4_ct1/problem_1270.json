Therefore, \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) can be rewritten as \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I will apply the power of a power property, which states that \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). This simplifies the expression to \\(2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other, leading to \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I will solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, which gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\):**\n   \n   Recognize that \\(256\\) is a power of \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   256 = 2^8\n   \\]\n   \n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \n   Now, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal:\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
