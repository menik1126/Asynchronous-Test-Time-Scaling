Subsequent terms are generated by alternately:\n- **Adding** the next integer (starting from 1)\n- **Multiplying** by the next integer\n\n### Step 2: Generate the Sequence\nLet's list the terms step by step:\n\n1. **First term:** \\( 0 \\)\n2. **Second term:** \\( 0 + 1 = 1 \\)\n3. **Third term:** \\( 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)\n4. **Fourth term:** \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n5. **Fifth term:** \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)\n6. **Sixth term:** \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\)\n7. **Seventh term:** \\( 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\)\n8. **Eighth term:** \\( 27 + 4 = 31 \\)\n9. **Ninth term:** \\( 31 \\times 4 = 124 \\)\n10. **Tenth term:** \\( 124 + 5 = 129 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Identify the First Term Greater Than 125\nFrom the sequence:\n- The **Tenth term** is **129**, which is greater than 125.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe first term in the sequence greater than 125 is"

    "question": "In the sequence 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, ..., the first term is 0.   Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and  multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1.  For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.  What is the value of the first term that is greater than 125?",
