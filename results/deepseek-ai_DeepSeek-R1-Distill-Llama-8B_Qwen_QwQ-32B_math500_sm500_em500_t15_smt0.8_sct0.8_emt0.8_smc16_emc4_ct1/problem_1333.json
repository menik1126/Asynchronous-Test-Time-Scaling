So, it's a rational equation with four terms on the left side, each of which is a fraction with a quadratic denominator, and a linear term on the right side. I need to find the sum of all complex solutions to this equation.\n\nFirst off, I know that to solve equations like this, especially with multiple fractions, it's often useful to bring everything to one side and then find a common denominator. But given the complexity of the denominators, that might get messy. Alternatively, maybe I can think of a substitution or another method that could simplify the equation.\n\nLooking at the left-hand side (LHS), each term is of the form \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\), where \\(n\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait a second, that structure seems repetitive. Maybe there's a pattern or a function that can be expressed more concisely.\n\nLet me consider each term:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1}\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x + 1)}\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{2}{x^2 - 2}\\) is similar to \\(\\frac{2}{(x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})}\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{3}{x^2 - 3}\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{(x - \\sqrt{3})(x + \\sqrt{3})}\\)\n4. \\(\\frac{4}{x^2 - 4}\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{(x - 2)(x + 2)}\\)\n\nEach of these denominators factors into linear terms with roots at \\(\\pm\\sqrt{n}\\) for each term. But I'm not sure if factoring is the way to go here. Maybe partial fractions? Hmm, but that seems complicated with"

Maybe I can write the LHS in terms of some function or derivative, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, considering the degree of the equation. Let's see: the denominators are all quadratic, so if I multiply both sides by the product of the denominators, I'll end up with a polynomial equation of degree 4 or higher? Let's check.\n\nThe denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). So their product would be \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). Multiplying both sides by this product would clear all the denominators. That would result in a polynomial equation of degree 8, because each quadratic term contributes two degrees, and when multiplied, we have 2*4=8.\n\nThat seems quite high, but perhaps manageable since we can use Vieta's formula to find the sum of the roots without expanding the entire polynomial. Wait, Vieta's applies to polynomials, right? So if I can write the equation in standard form, \\(P(x) = 0\\), then the sum of the roots would be \\(-b/a\\), where \\(b\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^{7}\\) and \\(a\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^8\\). But with an 8th-degree polynomial, that might be tedious.\n\nBut before I get ahead of myself, let me think if there is another approach. Maybe substitution.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe LHS is a sum of terms \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\). Let me denote \\(y = x^2\\), so each term becomes \\(\\frac{n}{y - n}\\). So the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nWait, but \\(y = x^"

The presence of both \\(x^2\\) terms and an \\(x\\) term makes it a mix of even and odd degrees, so it's not a polynomial in \\(x^2\\). Therefore, perhaps the only way is to proceed with multiplying through by the denominators.\n\nLet me try that approach step by step.\n\nFirst, let me denote the denominators as follows:\n\nLet \\(D(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). Then, multiplying both sides by \\(D(x)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} \\right) \\times D(x) = (2010x - 4) \\times D(x)\n\\]\n\nSo, expanding the left-hand side:\n\nEach term in the sum will have \\(D(x)\\) divided by one of the denominators. For example, the first term becomes:\n\n\\(1 \\times \\frac{D(x)}{x^2 - 1} = (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\)\n\nSimilarly, the second term is:\n\n\\(2 \\times \\frac{D(x)}{x^2 - 2} = 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\)\n\nThird term:\n\n\\(3 \\times \\frac{D(x)}{x^2 -"

However, since we are interested in the sum of all complex solutions, maybe we don't need to find each root explicitly, but just find the sum using Vieta's formula.\n\nIn that case, perhaps we can write the entire equation as P(x) = 0, where P(x) = LHS - RHS = 0. Then, P(x) will be a polynomial of degree 8, and the sum of its roots would be equal to minus the coefficient of x^7 divided by the coefficient of x^8.\n\nBut the question is, can we"

Therefore, multiplying by -2010x gives a leading term of -2010x * x^8 = -2010x^9.

Since D(x) has leading term x^8, so coefficient of x^8 is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of x^9 in 2010x D(x) is 2010*1 =2010.\n\nAdditionally, the term -4 D(x) contributes to lower degrees, but not to x^9. The term (A+B+C+D) also contributes only up to x^6, so their coefficients for x^9 and x^8 are zero. Therefore, the coefficient of x^9 in P(x) is 2010.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) comes from two sources:\n\n1. The term 2010x D(x): the coefficient of x^8 here is 2010 times the coefficient of x^7 in D(x). But D(x) has no x^7 term, so that's zero.\n\n2. The term -4 D(x): the coefficient of x^8 here is -4 times the coefficient of x^8 in D(x), which is -4*1 = -4.\n\n3. The term (A+B+C+D): since each of A,B,C,D is degree 6, their sum has a maximum degree of 6, so the coefficient of x^8 is zero.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is 0 + (-4) = -4.\n\nTherefore, in P(x), the leading term is 2010 x^9, and the next term is -4 x^8.\n\nTherefore, according to Vieta's formula, the sum of all roots of P(x)=0 is equal to - (coefficient of x^8)/(coefficient of x^9) = - (-4)/2010 = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm again:\n\nVieta's formula says that for a polynomial \\( P(x) = a_9 x^9 +"

So, the coefficient of x^9 is 2010, coefficient of x^8 is -4.\n\nTherefore, the sum of roots is \\( -a_8 / a_9 = - (-4)/2010 = 4 / 2010 \\).\n\nSimplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 2 / 1005.\n\nBut 2 and 1005: 1005 ÷ 5 = 201, which is 3 × 67.

Are we sure that all roots are accounted for?\n\nBecause when we multiplied both sides by D(x), we introduced potential extraneous solutions, i.e., solutions to P(x)=0 that don't satisfy the original equation. However, in terms of complex roots, all roots of P(x)=0 are also roots of the original equation, except that we've multiplied by D(x), so we have to make sure that solutions of P(x)=0 don't make any denominator zero in the original equation.\n\nTherefore, we have to exclude the solutions where x^2 = 1, 2, 3, 4, because in those cases, the denominators of the original equation become zero, so the expression is undefined.\n\nTherefore, the solutions to P(x)=0 include these four excluded points: x = ±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2. So, to correct our previous answer, the sum of all complex solutions to the original equation is equal to the sum of all complex solutions to P(x)=0 minus the sum"

Let me confirm that the excluded roots are indeed roots of P(x)=0?\n\nBecause when we multiplied both sides by D(x), the equation becomes P(x)=0, so any solution of the original equation must satisfy P(x)=0, but also, any solution of P(x)=0 that doesn't make D(x)=0 is a solution of the original equation. However, the roots of D(x)=0 (i.e., x^2=1,2,3,4) are not solutions of the original equation, but they are roots of P(x)=0?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nSuppose x is a root of D(x)=0, so x^2 = n where n is 1,2,3,4. Then, plugging into the original equation, the LHS would have a term with division by zero, so it's undefined. However, in the equation P(x)=0, which is LHS*D(x) - RHS*D(x)=0, plugging in x such that D(x)=0 would give 0 - 0 =0, so yes, those roots are indeed roots of P(x)=0. Therefore, they are extraneous and must be excluded.\n\nTherefore, the roots of the original equation are exactly the roots of P(x)=0 except for the roots of D(x)=0. Therefore, the sum of the roots of the original equation is equal to the sum of the roots of P(x)=0 minus the sum of the roots of D(x)=0.\n\nBut the roots of D(x)=0 are x=±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2."

Is it possible that in P(x)=0, the roots x=±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2 are all the roots with multiplicity? Or, in other words, are they all simple roots?\n\nLooking at D(x)= (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). When D(x)=0, x^2 =1,2,3,4, so x=±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2. Each of these roots has multiplicity 1 in D(x), so when multiplied by (-2010x +4), does that affect the multiplicity?\n\nWait, no, because D(x) is multiplied by a linear term (-2010x +4) and also added to the other terms. Wait, actually, let me think about the factorization.\n\nWait, perhaps we can factor P(x):\n\nFrom P(x) = (A + B + C + D) +2010x D(x) -4 D(x). But that seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, think of P(x) as D(x)*( sum of [n/(y -n) ]) - (2010x -4) D(x) =0.\n\nBut in any case, regardless of the exact form, the roots of P(x)=0 include the roots of D(x)=0, which are the x's where denominators in the original equation are zero.
