Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that each term on the left side has a similar structure: the numerator is a constant, and the denominator is \\(x^2 - k\\), where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Maybe there's a way to simplify each term or combine them somehow.\n\nLet me rewrite each term to see if there's a pattern or a common factor. For the first term, \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1}\\), I can factor the denominator as \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\). Similarly, the second term becomes \\(\\frac{2}{(x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})}\\), and so on for the others. However, I'm not sure if partial fractions would help here because each term has a different denominator.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider a substitution. If I let \\(y = x - \\frac{b}{2a}\\) or something, but that seems too vague. Alternatively, maybe I should bring everything to one side and set the equation to zero.\n\nSo, let's subtract the right-hand side from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow, this equation is a rational function set equal to zero. To solve this, I might need to find a common denominator to combine all the terms into a single rational expression. However, that sounds complicated because the denominators are all different quadratic expressions.\n\nLet me think about another approach.

But since we are dealing with complex solutions, maybe the asymptotes aren't as critical here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the equation is of the form \\(f(x) = 2010x - 4\\), where \\(f(x)\\) is the sum of those fractions. Since we need the sum of all complex solutions, perhaps Vieta's formula can be applied here? But Vieta's formula applies to polynomials, so maybe I need to convert this equation into a polynomial equation first.\n\nYes, that's probably the way to go. Let me try to clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by the product of all denominators. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). Let me denote each denominator as follows:\n\nLet \\(D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). Then, multiplying both sides by \\(D\\) would eliminate all denominators.

Since the equation is a degree 9 polynomial, the sum of all roots is indeed - (coefficient of x^8)/(coefficient of x^9). So I need to find these two coefficients.\n\nLet me first compute the leading term of each part.\n\nFirst, the term \\( (2010x -4) D \\). Since D is a degree 8 polynomial, multiplying by 2010x gives a leading term of 2010x * x^8 = 2010x^9. The other term, -4*D, will have leading term -4x^8. So the leading term of R is 2010x^9, and the coefficient of x^8 in R is -4*(leading coefficient of D).

Wait, actually, the coefficient of x^8 in D is 1, since each factor contributes x^2, so multiplied together, the leading term is x^8. The coefficient of x^6 in D would be the sum of the constants, but maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, actually, the coefficient of x^8 in D is 1, so the coefficient of x^8 in R is -4*1 = -4, but actually, the term -4*D would have a coefficient of -4 for x^8.

Alternatively, in order to find the coefficient of x^9 in P(x), which is the entire left side minus R, the coefficient of x^9 in L (the left side, before subtracting R) is zero because each term in L is a product of three quadratics, each giving x^6, so x^6 * x^6 = x^12? Wait, no.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Each term in L is (x^2 - something)(x^2 - something)(x^2 - something), which is a product of three quadratics, so each is a degree 6 polynomial. Therefore, each term in L is degree 6, and when you add four such terms together, the leading term is the same for each, so they would add up.

However, plugging those x into the original equation would make denominators zero, so they are not solutions.

Therefore, when considering the sum, we need to subtract the sum of these 8 roots from the total sum of 9 roots.\n\nBut according to Vieta, the sum of all 9 roots is 2/1005, so if we can compute the sum of the 8 extraneous roots, we can subtract it to find the sum of the actual roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that Vieta's formula gives the sum of all 9 roots, both real and complex, but the original equation excludes 8 roots, so the sum would be Vieta's sum minus the sum of excluded roots.\n\nBut now, the question is: what is the sum of the roots of D=0? That is, the roots of (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4)=0, so x^2 =1,2,3,4, giving x=±1,±√2,±√3,±2. So total 8 roots, each is either ±k for k=1,2,√2,√3.\n\nSo the sum of these roots is zero? Because for each positive root, there is a corresponding negative root, so they cancel out.\n\nIndeed, for every x = k, there is a x = -k. So the sum is (1 -1) + (√2 - √2) + (2 - 2) + ... Wait, no, actually, for each pair, like x=1 and x=-1, they sum to zero, similarly for x=√2 and x=-√2, same for others. Therefore, the sum of all 8 roots is zero.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the 9 roots (from the polynomial equation) is 2/1005, and the sum of the 8 extraneous roots is zero, so the sum of the actual roots is 2/1005 - 0 = 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me just confirm this. Because in the polynomial equation, excluding those 8 roots, the remaining root is the solution"

Wait, but the original equation could have multiple solutions, but according to the degree, the polynomial equation has 9 roots, 8 of which are excluded, so only 1 solution? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps some of the excluded roots might actually satisfy the original equation?\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose x is one of the excluded roots, say x=1. Then plugging into the original equation, the left side has a term 1/(1 -1), which is undefined. So x=1 is not a solution. Similarly for all excluded roots. Therefore, the original equation has exactly 9 - 8 = 1 solution? But that seems odd because the right-hand side is a linear function, and the left side is a sum of rational functions. Maybe there is only one solution?\n\nWait, but the equation is of degree 9, so after removing the 8 excluded roots, there is 1 remaining root. Therefore, the original equation has only one complex solution, and its sum is just that solution, which is 2/1005. Wait, but that would mean the solution is 2/1005, but the sum is the same as the solution. Hmm, but maybe that's correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the degree. Let me check again.\n\nThe polynomial equation P(x) = L - R is of degree 9. The roots of P(x)=0 are the roots of the original equation plus the roots of D=0 (the excluded values). Since D=0 has 8 roots, then P(x)=0 has 9 roots, so the original equation has 9 - 8 = 1 root. Therefore, the sum of all complex solutions is just that single root, which is equal to 2/1005. Therefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple roots not in the excluded set. Wait, but if the polynomial is degree 9, and 8 roots are excluded, then the remaining root is the only solution. So the sum is that single root. Therefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the coefficients. Let me recheck the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in P(x).\n\nFirst, R = (2010x -4)*D"

So the expansion of D starts as x^8 - (1 + 2 + 3 +4)x^6 + ... So the coefficient of x^8 in D is 1, x^7 is 0 (since all terms are even powers), x^6 is - (1+2+3+4)= -10, etc.\n\nTherefore, R = (2010x -4)*D = 2010x * D -4D. So the leading term is 2010x^9, and the next term is 2010x * (-10x^6) = -20100x^7, and then the term from -4D is -4*(x^8) + ... So, the x^8 term in R is -4x^8.\n\nTherefore, when we form P(x) = L - R, where L is the sum of four terms each of degree 6:\n\nSo, in L, each term is (x^2 - a)(x^2 - b)(x^2 - c), each of degree 6 with leading term x^6. So, when we sum them, we get 10x^6 as leading term, as 1+2+3+4=10.\n\nThus, P(x) = L - R = [10x^6 + ...] - [2010x^9 -4x^8 + ...] = -2010x^9 +4x^8 +10x^6 + ....\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^9 is -2010, and the coefficient of x^8 is +4, which matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, Vieta's formula gives the sum of all roots as -4 / (-2010) = 2/1005. Since the 8 extraneous roots sum to zero, the sum of the actual roots is 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2/1005. So in boxed form, it's \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{1005}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n"
