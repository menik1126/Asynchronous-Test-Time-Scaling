The problem says that the expression \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\) can be written as \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are integers. Then, I need to find \\(AB + B\\). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you factor a quadratic expression like \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\), you're essentially looking for two binomials that multiply together to give you the original quadratic. The given form is \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\). That means when I multiply these two binomials, I should get back to \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\).\n\nSo, let me try expanding \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\) to see what that gives me. When multiplying two binomials, I can use the FOIL method: First, Outer, Inner, Last.\n\nFirst terms: \\(Ax \\times Bx = ABx^2\\)\n\nOuter terms: \\(Ax \\times 3 = 3Ax\\)\n\nInner terms: \\(-8 \\times Bx = -8Bx\\)\n\nLast terms: \\(-8 \\times 3 = -24\\)\n\nNow, let me combine the outer and inner terms. The outer terms are \\(3Ax\\) and the inner terms are \\(-8Bx\\). Adding those together, I get \\((3A - 8B)x\\).\n\nPutting it all together, the expansion is:\n\\(ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24\\).\n\nNow, this should be equal to the original expression \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\). So, I can set the coefficients of corresponding terms equal to each other.\n\nStarting with the \\(x^2\\) term:\n\\(ABx^2 = 10x^2\\). Therefore, \\(AB = 10\\).\n\nNext, the \\(x\\) term:\n\\((3A - 8B)x = -x\\). So, \\(3A - 8B = -1\\).\n\nLastly, the constant term is already matching: \\(-24 = -24\\), so that doesn't give me any new information.\n\nNow I have a"

Let me start with the first equation, \\(AB = 10\\). So, I can list the pairs of integers that multiply to 10.\n\nThe pairs are:\n- \\(1 \\times 10 = 10\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n- \\(-1 \\times -10 = 10\\)\n- \\(-2 \\times -5 = 10\\)\n\nSo, possible positive factor pairs are (1,10), (2,5), and their negatives. Let me consider each pair and see if they satisfy the second equation.\n\nFirst, let's try \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = 10\\).\n\nPlugging into the second equation: \\(3(1) - 8(10) = 3 - 80 = -77\\). That's way off from -1, so this pair doesn't work.\n\nNext, try \\(A = 2\\) and \\(B = 5\\).\n\nCompute \\(3(2) - 8(5) = 6 - 40 = -34\\). Not -1, so no luck.\n\nHow about negative factors? Let's try \\(A = -1\\) and \\(B = -10\\).\n\nCompute \\(3(-1) - 8(-10) = -3 + 80 = 77\\). That's definitely not -1. How about \\(A = -2\\) and \\(B = -5\\)?\n\nCompute \\(3(-2) - 8(-5) = -6 + 40 = 34\\). Still not -1.\n\nHmm, none of the factor pairs I tried so far work. Maybe I missed a factor pair? Wait, the equation \\(AB = 10\\) could also have other possibilities, such as \\(A = 5\\) and \\(B = 2\\), or \\(A = 10\\) and \\(B = 1\\). Let me check those.\n\nTry \\(A = 5\\), \\(B = 2\\):\n\nCompute \\(3(5) - 8(2) = 15 - 16 = -1\\). Ah! That works. So this pair satisfies both equations.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n\\(A"

Perfect!\n\nAlternatively, if I try \\(A = 10\\), \\(B = 1\\):\n\nCompute \\(3(10) - 8(1) = 30 - 8 = 22\\). That's not -1, so that doesn't work.\n\nWait, so when \\(A = 5\\), \\(B = 2\\), the second equation works. So that must be the solution.\n\nTherefore, \\(A = 5\\) and \\(B = 2\\).\n\nNow, the problem asks for \\(AB + B\\). So, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, \\(AB = 5 \\times 2 = 10\\).\n\nThen, \\(AB + B = 10 + 2 = 12\\).\n\nSo, the final answer should be 12.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me verify the expansion with \\(A = 5\\) and \\(B = 2\\).\n\nCompute \\((5x - 8)(2x + 3)\\):\n\nMultiply:\n\nFirst: \\(5x \\times 2x = 10x^2\\)\n\nOuter: \\(5x \\times 3 = 15x\\)\n\nInner: \\(-8 \\times 2x = -16x\\)\n\nLast: \\(-8 \\times 3 = -24\\)\n\nCombine the outer and inner terms: \\(15x - 16x = -x\\)\n\nSo, putting it together: \\(10x^2 - x -24\\), which matches the original expression.
