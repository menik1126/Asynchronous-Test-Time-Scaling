            "output": "To solve the problem, let's denote Denali's pay as \\( P_D \\) and Nate's pay as \\( P_N \\).\n\nInitially, Denali is walking 16 dogs, and Nate is walking 12 dogs. Therefore, the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is:\n\\[\n\\frac{P_D}{P_N} = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nThis means that \\( P_D = \\frac{4}{3} P_N \\).\n\nUnder the first scenario, Denali is assigned 4x more dogs, making her total dogs 16 + 4x. Meanwhile, Nate's number of dogs remains 12. The pay ratio should still be \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), so:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nSolving this equation:\n\\[\n16 + 4x = 16\n\\]\nSubtracting 16 from both sides:\n\\[\n4x = 0 \\implies x = 0\n\\]\nHowever, \\( x \\) must not be zero. Therefore, this scenario doesn't provide a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's consider the second scenario where x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali. Denali's total dogs become 16 + x, and Nate's total dogs become 12 - x. The pay ratio should still be \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), so:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nCross-multiplying:\n\\[\n3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x)\n\\]\n\\[\n48 + 3x = 48 - 4x\n\\]\nBringing like terms together:\n\\[\n7x = 0 \\implies x = 0\n\\]\nAgain, this results in \\( x = 0 \\), which is not valid. This indicates that the only solution is \\( x = 0 \\), but since \\( x \\neq 0 \\) is required, the problem may have no solution under the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow the given conditions step by step.\n\n**Let’s define:**\n- \\( D \\) = Denali's number of dogs\n- \\( N \\) = Nate's number of"

The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
