Let's let \\( x \\) be the number of dogs that are reassigned.\n\nFirst, under the current scenario, Denali has 16 dogs and Nate has 12 dogs. So, their pay ratio is 16:12, which simplifies to 4:3.\n\nNext, consider the first condition: Denali walks 4x more dogs, while Nate stays at 12. This means Denali will have 16 + 4x dogs, and Nate will have 12 dogs. The ratio of their pay remains 4:3.\n\nSetting up the ratio equation: (16 + 4x)/12 = 4/3. Solving for x gives 16 + 4x = 16, leading to x = 0. But x cannot be zero as per the problem statement.\n\nThen, look at the second condition: x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali. This means Denali will have 16 + x dogs and Nate will have 12 - x dogs. The pay ratio should still be 4:3.\n\nSetting up the second ratio equation: (16 + x)/(12 - x) = 4/3. Cross-multiplying gives 3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x), which simplifies to 48 + 3x = 48 - 4x. Solving this gives 7x = 0, so x = 0. Again, x cannot be zero.\n\nBoth conditions lead to x = 0, which contradicts the requirement that x \u2260 0. This suggests there might be an error in the initial setup or the problem itself.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of dogs that are reassigned.\n\n**Step 2: Current Pay Ratio**\n- Denali walks 16 dogs.\n- Nate walks 12 dogs.\n- The initial ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is \\( \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\n**Step 3: First Condition**\nIf Denali starts walking \\( 4x \\) more dogs and Nate stays at 12 dogs:\n- Denali walks \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs.\n- Nate walks 12 dogs.\n- The new ratio should be \\( \\frac{4}{"
