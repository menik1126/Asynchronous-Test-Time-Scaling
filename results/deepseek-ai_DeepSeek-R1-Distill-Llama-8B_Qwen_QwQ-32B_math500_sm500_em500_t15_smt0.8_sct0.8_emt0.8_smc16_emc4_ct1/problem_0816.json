            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let \u03c9 be a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Hmm, okay. I remember that \u03c9 is a cube root of unity, so there are three roots, right? Let me think.\n\nFirst, \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, which means \u03c9 is a root of the equation x\u00b3 - 1 = 0. To find all the cube roots of unity, I can factor that equation. So, x\u00b3 - 1 factors into (x - 1)(x\u00b2 + x + 1) = 0. That means, apart from x = 1, the other roots satisfy x\u00b2 + x + 1 = 0. So, those roots are the non-trivial cube roots of unity.\n\nSo, \u03c9 can be either 1 or the two roots of x\u00b2 + x + 1 = 0. Let me denote those roots as \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2, I think. Wait, yes, it's standard to call them \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2. So, \u03c9 is a primitive cube root of unity, meaning \u03c9 \u2260 1, and \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. Similarly, \u03c9\u00b2 also satisfies \u03c9\u00b2\u00b3 = 1, and (\u03c9\u00b2)\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 = 0, I believe.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the value of 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Since \u03c9 can be either 1, \u03c9, or \u03c9\u00b2, but wait, if \u03c9 is 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1\u00b2) would be 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, one possible value is 1. But, are there other possible values?\n\nWait, no, hold on. The cube roots of unity are 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1. So, when the problem says \"find all possible values\", does it mean considering both \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2? Because sometimes problems like this may have the same result for different roots.\n\nLet me check for \u03c9. Let me compute 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Hmm, maybe I can combine these fractions. Let me find a common denominator. The denominators"

Let me compute the numerator:\n\n1*(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1*(1 + \u03c9) = (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nSo, the expression becomes (2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)/[(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2)].\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see if I can simplify numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, the numerator: 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2. Since \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0 (from the equation x\u00b2 + x + 1 = 0), so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, substituting that into the numerator: 2 + (-1) = 1. So numerator is 1.\n\nNow the denominator: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me expand that:\n\n(1)(1) + 1*(\u03c9\u00b2) + \u03c9*(1) + \u03c9*(\u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3.\n\nBut \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. Therefore, substituting that in:\n\n1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = (1 + 1) + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2). Again, since \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1, this becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is 1. So the entire expression is 1/1 = 1.\n\nWait, so that's interesting. So regardless of whether \u03c9 is the primitive root or \u03c9\u00b2, the expression simplifies to 1? But when \u03c9 is 1, we also get 1. So does that mean that the expression is always equal to 1?\n\nWait, but let me check with \u03c9 = 1. Let me plug in \u03c9 = 1 into the original expression:\n\n1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1\u00b2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Yep, that's 1. So, in all cases, the"

            "output": " expression is equal to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. If \u03c9 is a primitive cube root of unity, so \u03c9 \u2260 1, and (\u03c9)\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1, so 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 is 2 - 1 = 1. And the denominator is (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me compute (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) again. Let me use the identity:\n\n(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3. But \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so this is 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 2 - 1 = 1. So yeah, the denominator is 1. Therefore, the expression is 1/1 = 1.\n\nSo, regardless of which cube root of unity \u03c9 is, the expression evaluates to 1. So, the only possible value is 1. Hmm, so maybe the answer is just 1.\n\nWait, but in that case, if I just take \u03c9 = 1, that gives 1 as well. So, whether \u03c9 is 1 or not, the expression is 1. So, that's the only possible value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, we note that the cube roots of unity are \\(1\\), \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\).
