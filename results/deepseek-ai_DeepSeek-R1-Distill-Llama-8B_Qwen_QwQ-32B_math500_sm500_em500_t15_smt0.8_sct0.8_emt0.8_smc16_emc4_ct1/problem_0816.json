I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. Cube roots of unity satisfy the equation ω³ - 1 = 0, which can be factored as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. So, the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1. That means we have two primitive cube roots of unity, ω and ω², each satisfying ω³ = 1 and ω ≠ 1.\n\nSo, the possible values for ω are 1, ω, and ω². However, if ω = 1, then the denominators 1 + ω and 1 + ω² become 2 and 2, respectively. Plugging ω = 1 into the expression gives \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\). But ω = 1 is a root, but the problem is asking for ω such that ω³ = 1. Wait, but ω could be 1, ω, or ω². So, let me check each case separately.\n\nCase 1: ω = 1\nExpression: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1^2}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\). Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nCase 2: ω = ω\nSo, plugging ω into the expression: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). I need to compute this. Maybe using some algebraic identities can help here.\n\nWait, let's consider that since ω³ = 1, we can express ω² as ω⁻¹ because ω * ω² = ω³ = 1, so ω² = ω⁻¹. Similarly, ω = ω²⁻¹.\n\nSo, perhaps it's easier to work"

Let me consider the sum S = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, I can combine these two fractions into a single fraction. Let me find a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So,\n\nS = \\(\\frac{1(1 + ω²) + 1(1 + ω)}{(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)}\\)\n= \\(\\frac{(1 + ω² + 1 + ω)}{(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)}\\)\n= \\(\\frac{2 + ω + ω²}{(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)}\\)\n\nNow, the numerator is 2 + ω + ω², and the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute both numerator and denominator.\n\nI remember that for cube roots of unity, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Because the sum of all cube roots of unity is zero. So, ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, numerator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo, numerator = 1.\n\nDenominator: Let's expand (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Multiplying these out, we get 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³. But ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. So, denominator becomes 1 + ω + ω² + 1.\n\nWait, wait, hold on: 1 + ω² + ω + ω³. ω³ is 1, so denominator is 1 + ω + ω² + 1. And 1 + ω + ω² is 0, so denominator is 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nWait, so denominator is 1. Therefore, S = 1/1 = 1.\n\nWait, that's the same as when ω =1? But ω is a primitive cube root, so in this case, both ω and ω² would give S =1. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, wait a second. When ω is a primitive root, so ω ≠1, then S =1.

Let me check my calculations again.\n\nStarting with S = [1/(1 + ω)] + [1/(1 + ω²)].\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω². Since ω + ω² = -1, so 2 + (-1) =1. That's correct.\n\nDenominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. Since ω³ =1, so substituting, 1 + ω + ω² +1 = (1 +1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (-1) =1. So denominator is 1. So S =1/1 =1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², the expression is always 1? But that contradicts my initial thought that maybe there are different values. Wait, but when ω is 1, the denominators are 2 each, so adding gives 1. When ω is a primitive root, the sum is also 1. So the only possible value is 1?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all possible values\". So maybe the answer is just 1?\n\nBut let me test with actual numbers to confirm.\n\nLet me take ω = e^(2πi/3), which is a primitive cube root of unity. So ω = -1/2 + i√3/2, and ω² = -1/2 -i√3/2.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω: 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 -i√3/2) = 1/2 -i√3/2.\n\nSo, compute 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2).

The argument is arctan( (√3/2)/(1/2) ) = arctan(√3) = π/3.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω) = (1)/(1/2 + i√3/2) = 2/(1 + i√3). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):\n\n= [2(1 - i√3)] / [ (1)^2 + (√3)^2 ] = [2(1 - i√3)] / 4 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1/2 - i√3/2, so 1/(1 + ω²) is the conjugate, which is (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nTherefore, sum S = (1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = [1 +1]/2 + [ -i√3 + i√3 ]/2 = 2/2 + 0 =1.\n\nSo, indeed, S =1 when ω is a primitive cube root of unity.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but the question says \"Find all possible values\", so maybe it's just 1. But wait, let me think again. Is there a case where the expression could be different?\n\nWait, in the denominator, when ω =1, it's 2, but the numerators are both 1, so 1/2 +1/2 =1, which is same as when ω is a primitive root. So no, it seems that in all cases, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach using minimal polynomials or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using substitution.

Wait, perhaps using the identity 1 + ω + ω² =0.\n\nWait, since 1 + ω + ω² =0, then 1 + ω = -ω², and 1 + ω² = -ω. Let me see:\n\nIf 1 + ω = -ω², then 1/(1 + ω) = -1/ω². Similarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = -1/ω.\n\nTherefore, the sum becomes -1/ω² -1/ω = - (1/ω + 1/ω²). Let me compute that.\n\nBut 1/ω is ω², since ω * ω² =1, so 1/ω = ω². Similarly, 1/ω² = ω. Therefore, substituting:\n\n- (ω² + ω) = - (ω + ω²). But from the identity, ω + ω² = -1, so this becomes -(-1) =1. So that's another way to see it.\n\nWow, that's a much simpler approach. So, using the fact that 1 + ω = -ω² and 1 + ω² = -ω, so substituting into the expression gives:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = (-1/ω²) + (-1/ω) = - (1/ω + 1/ω²) = - (ω² + ω) = -(-1) =1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is (except maybe 1?), but even when ω is 1, does this hold?\n\nWait, if ω =1, then 1 + ω =2, so 1/(1 + ω) =1/2. Similarly, 1 + ω² =1 +1=2, so same. So the sum is 1. But according to the above method, if we set ω=1, then 1 + ω =2, but according to the identity 1 + ω = -ω², but if ω=1, then ω²=1, so"

Thus, when ω=1, we can't use that identity, but in that case, we can compute the sum directly and it still equals 1.\n\nSo, whether ω is 1 or a primitive root, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the expression is symmetric for ω and ω². So even if ω takes two different primitive roots, the sum remains 1.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the expression always equals 1, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is. Hence, the only possible value is 1.\n</think>\n\nThe expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity ω. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize ω is a cube root of unity, so ω³ = 1 and 1 + ω + ω² = 0.\n2. Express the sum as a single fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} = \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n   \\]\n3.
