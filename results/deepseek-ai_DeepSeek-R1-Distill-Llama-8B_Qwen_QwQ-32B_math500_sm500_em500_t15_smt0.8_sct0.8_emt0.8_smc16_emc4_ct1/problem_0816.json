            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay. I remember that ω is a cube root of unity, so there are three roots, right? Let me think.\n\nFirst, ω³ = 1, which means ω is a root of the equation x³ - 1 = 0. To find all the cube roots of unity, I can factor that equation. So, x³ - 1 factors into (x - 1)(x² + x + 1) = 0. That means, apart from x = 1, the other roots satisfy x² + x + 1 = 0. So, those roots are the non-trivial cube roots of unity.\n\nSo, ω can be either 1 or the two roots of x² + x + 1 = 0. Let me denote those roots as ω and ω², I think. Wait, yes, it's standard to call them ω and ω². So, ω is a primitive cube root of unity, meaning ω ≠ 1, and ω³ = 1. Similarly, ω² also satisfies ω²³ = 1, and (ω²)² + ω² + 1 = 0, I believe.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the value of 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Since ω can be either 1, ω, or ω², but wait, if ω is 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1²) would be 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, one possible value is 1. But, are there other possible values?\n\nWait, no, hold on. The cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, when the problem says \"find all possible values\", does it mean considering both ω and ω²? Because sometimes problems like this may have the same result for different roots.\n\nLet me check for ω. Let me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, maybe I can combine these fractions. Let me find a common denominator. The denominators"

            "output": " are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²). The common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute the numerator:\n\n1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω) = (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo, the expression becomes (2 + ω + ω²)/[(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see if I can simplify numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, the numerator: 2 + ω + ω². Since ω² + ω + 1 = 0 (from the equation x² + x + 1 = 0), so ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, substituting that into the numerator: 2 + (-1) = 1. So numerator is 1.\n\nNow the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand that:\n\n(1)(1) + 1*(ω²) + ω*(1) + ω*(ω²) = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, substituting that in:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = (1 + 1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (ω + ω²). Again, since ω + ω² = -1, this becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is 1. So the entire expression is 1/1 = 1.\n\nWait, so that's interesting. So regardless of whether ω is the primitive root or ω², the expression simplifies to 1? But when ω is 1, we also get 1. So does that mean that the expression is always equal to 1?\n\nWait, but let me check with ω = 1. Let me plug in ω = 1 into the original expression:\n\n1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1²) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Yep, that's 1. So, in all cases, the"

            "output": " expression is equal to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. If ω is a primitive cube root of unity, so ω ≠ 1, and (ω)² + ω + 1 = 0, so ω + ω² = -1, so 2 + ω + ω² is 2 - 1 = 1. And the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) again. Let me use the identity:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. But ω³ = 1, so this is 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω² = 2 - 1 = 1. So yeah, the denominator is 1. Therefore, the expression is 1/1 = 1.\n\nSo, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression evaluates to 1. So, the only possible value is 1. Hmm, so maybe the answer is just 1.\n\nWait, but in that case, if I just take ω = 1, that gives 1 as well. So, whether ω is 1 or not, the expression is 1. So, that's the only possible value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, we note that the cube roots of unity are \\(1\\), \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\).
