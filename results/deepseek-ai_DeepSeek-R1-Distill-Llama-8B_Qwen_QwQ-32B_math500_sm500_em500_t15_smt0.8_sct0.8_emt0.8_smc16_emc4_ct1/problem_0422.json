I need to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nHmm, first, let me parse this equation. It looks like \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). That seems similar to \\(a^{10} + b^{10} = 0\\), where \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = (13x - 1)\\). Maybe I can factor this or find some relationship between the roots.\n\nWait, but both \\(x^{10}\\) and \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) are being added together. So, each term is a 10th power. Since their sum is zero, each term must be related in some way.\n\nI recall that for complex numbers, if \\(z + \\overline{z} = 2\\text{Re}(z)\\), which is a real number. But here, it's \\(z^{10} + w^{10} = 0\\), where \\(w = 13x - 1\\). Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of \\(w = 13x - 1\\), so \\(x = \\frac{w + 1}{13}\\). Then, substituting back, the equation becomes \\(\\left(\\frac{w + 1}{13}\\right)^{10} + w^{10} = 0\\). But that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using some substitution or factoring. Let me try dividing both sides by \\(x^{10}\\), assuming \\(x \\neq 0\\) (which should be fine since if \\(x = 0\\), the left-hand side is \\(0 + (-1)^{10} = 1 \\neq 0\\"

Then the equation becomes \\(1 + y^{10} = 0\\), so \\(y^{10} = -1\\). The solutions to this are the 10th roots of \\(-1\\), which are \\(y = e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\).

Wait, actually, the original equation has real coefficients? Let me check.\n\nThe equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Let me see if the coefficients are real. The coefficients of the polynomial will be real because both \\(x^{10}\\) and \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) have real coefficients, so their sum does too. Therefore, yes, the roots"

Wait, no, actually, each pair's two terms are equal, but different pairs have different values. Wait, but in the problem, the sum over the five terms is exactly the sum over each pair's value once. So, the total over all roots is twice the desired sum. Therefore, the desired sum is 1700 / 2 = 850.\n\nWait, that seems possible. Let me confirm:\n\nSuppose the desired sum is S = sum_{j=1}^5 |13 - y_j|^2, where each term is from one root in each pair. Then, the total over all roots is 2*S, so S = 1700 / 2 = 850. Therefore, the answer is 850?\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Let me take a simple case where the roots are symmetric.\n\nSuppose we have two roots, y and its conjugate. Then, the total over both roots would be |13 - y|^2 + |13 - \\overline{y}|^2 = 2|13 - y|^2. So, the total over both roots is twice the value for one term. Therefore, the sum over the pairs (each pair contributing one term) would be half the total. So, yes, in this case, the total over all roots is twice the desired sum. Therefore, in our problem, since there are 10 roots, the total over all roots is 1700, so the desired sum is 1700 / 2 = 850. Therefore, the answer is 850?\n\nWait, but let me check with the formula again.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the sum of 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) for each pair. Since each term is |13 - y_j|^2, and the total over all roots (each term counted twice) is 1700, so the desired sum is 1700 / 2 = 850. So, the answer is 850?\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Wait, the problem says \"the value of 1/(r1 \\overline{r1}) + ... + 1/(r5"

Each term is |13 - y_j|^2, so since each pair contributes one term, that term is |13 - y_j|^2 for each pair. Therefore, the desired sum is exactly the sum over five terms, each being |13 - y_j|^2. Since the total over all roots is 1700, which is the sum over all ten terms (five pairs, two terms each), the total is 2*S, where S is the desired sum. Therefore, S = 1700 / 2 = 850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850.\n\nBut wait, let me compute this in another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, note that:\n\n1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |13 - y_j|^2\n\nBut each r_j is x_j = 1/(13 - y_j), so |x_j|^2 = 1/(13 - y_j)(13 - \\overline{y_j}) = 1/(|13 - y_j|^2)\n\nTherefore, 1/|x_j|^2 = |13 - y_j|^2.\n\nTherefore, the desired sum is sum_{j=1}^5 |13 - y_j|^2.\n\nBut we can compute this sum as follows:\n\nSum_{j=1}^5 |13 - y_j|^2 = Sum_{j=1}^5 (13 - y_j)(13 - \\overline{y_j})\n\nBut since y_j are the roots of y^{10} = -1, so they satisfy y_j^{10} = -1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's complicated, but we already computed the total over all roots, which is 1700, so dividing by 2 gives 850.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach.\n\nSince each y_j is a root of y^{10} = -1, so we can write the equation as y^{10} + 1 = 0.\n\nTherefore, y^{10} = -1.\n\nLet me compute the sum over all roots y of |13 - y|^2.\n\nBut |13 - y|^2 = 13^2 - 26 Re(y) + |y|^2 = 169 - 26 Re(y) + 1, since |"

So, each root \\(x\\) is related to a root \\(y\\) of \\(y^{10} = -1\\). Therefore, the roots \\(x\\) are \\(x = -1/(y -13)\\). Therefore, the roots \\(r_j\\) are these x's, and their conjugates are \\( \\overline{x} = -1/(\\overline{y} -13)\\).\n\nTherefore, the product \\(r_j \\overline{r_j}\\) is \\( |x|^2 = 1/|y -13|^2 \\), so \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |y -13|^2\\).

Therefore, \\( |x|^2 = \\frac{1}{|y -13|^2} \\). Therefore, \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |x|^2 = 1/|y -1"
