The problem mentions that these roots come in complex conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). That makes sense because non-real roots of polynomials with real coefficients always come in conjugate pairs.\n\nThe question is asking for the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about what each term represents. I know that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real number and equals the square of the modulus of \\(r\\). So each term \\(\\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r}_i}\\) is essentially \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\), the reciprocal of the squared modulus of each root.\n\nSo, the sum we need to compute is the sum of the reciprocals of the squared moduli of each pair of conjugate roots. Since the roots come in pairs, maybe I can express this sum in terms of the polynomial's coefficients or some symmetric functions. I remember that for polynomials, Vieta's formulas relate the sums and products of roots to the coefficients. Maybe that can help here.\n\nBut how? Let me recall Vieta's formulas for a general polynomial. For a polynomial of the form \\(P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_0\\), the sum of the roots is \\(-a_{n-1}/a_n\\), the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is \\(a_{n-2}/a_n\\), and so on. But in this case, I need something related to the products \\(r_i \\overline{r}_i\\)."

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nWait, let me think about the sum we need. Each term is \\(1/(r_i \\overline{r}_i)\\). So, if I denote \\(z_i = r_i \\overline{r}_i\\), then each \\(z_i\\) is \\(|r_i|^2\\), which is real and non-negative. Then, the sum becomes \\(1/z_1 + 1/z_2 + \\dots + 1/z_5\\). So, the problem reduces to finding the sum of reciprocals of the squared moduli of the roots.\n\nBut how to relate this to the polynomial? Maybe I can find an equation satisfied by \\(1/z\\), where \\(z = |r|^2\\). Let me try to express \\(z = |r|^2 = r \\overline{r}\\). If \\(r\\) is a root of the given polynomial, then so is \\(\\overline{r}\\), so perhaps I can find a polynomial equation in terms of \\(z\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe using logarithms. Since \\(z = |r|^2\\), taking the logarithm would give \\(\\ln z = 2 \\ln |r|\\), but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Let me set \\(y = \\frac{x}{13x - 1}\\), so the equation becomes \\(y^{10} = -1\\).

Let me recall that the 10th roots of \\(-1\\) are the same as the 20th roots of unity that are not 10th roots of unity. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The 10th roots of \\(-1\\) can be expressed as \\(e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\). So, these are 10 distinct roots, each at an angle of \\(\\pi/10 + 2\\pi k/10\\). Alternatively, if I write \\(-1 = e^{i\\pi}\\), so the 10th roots of \\(-1\\) are the 10th roots of \\(e^{i\\pi}\\), which are \\(e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(9\\).\n\nSo, these roots are equally spaced on the unit circle, starting at angle \\(\\pi/10\\) and each subsequent root is at an additional angle of \\(2\\pi/10 = \\pi/5\\) radians.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all \\(y_k\\) over \\(k = 0\\) to \\(9\\) is zero, because they are symmetrically distributed around the unit circle. Similarly, the sum of \\(1/y_k\\) is also the sum of their reciprocals. But since \\(|y_k| = 1\\), \\(1/y_k = \\overline{y_k}\\). Therefore, \\(\\sum 1/y_k = \\sum \\overline{y_k} = \\overline{\\sum y_k}\\). But since \\(\\sum y_k = 0\\), then \\(\\sum 1/y_k = 0\\).\n\nSo, let me compute the total sum:\n\n\\(\\sum_{k=0}^{9} [ -13 y_k + 170 - 13/y_k ] = -13 \\sum y_k + 170 \\cdot 10 -13 \\sum 1/y_k \\).\n\nWe know that \\(\\sum y_k = 0\\), and \\(\\sum 1/y_k = 0\\).

So, each \\(y\\) is a root of \\(y^{10} = -1\\). Therefore, they satisfy \\(y^{10} + 1 = 0\\), so \\(y^{10} = -1\\). So, in terms of the expression, each \\(y\\) satisfies this equation, but does that help? Maybe not necessarily.\n\nWait, but since \\(y^{10} = -1\\), then \\(y^{10} + 1 = 0\\), so \\(y^{10} = -1\\).
