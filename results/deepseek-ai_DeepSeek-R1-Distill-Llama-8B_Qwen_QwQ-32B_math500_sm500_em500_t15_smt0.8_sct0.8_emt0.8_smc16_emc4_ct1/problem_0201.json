The theorem states that any possible rational root, in reduced form \\(p/q\\), is a divisor of the constant term divided by a divisor of the leading coefficient.\n\nHere, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible integer roots are the divisors of -14, which are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14.\n\nNext, I'll test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial to see if the equation equals zero.\n\nStarting with \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0\\).\nSince the result is 0, \\(x = 1\\) is an integer root.\n\nTesting \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14 = -8\\), which is not zero.\n\nChecking \\(x = 2\\):\n\\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14 = 76\\), not zero.\n\nTesting \\(x = -2\\):\n\\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) - 14 = 16 - 40 + 36 + 2 - 14 = 0\\).\nThus, \\(x = -2\\) is also an integer root.\n\nContinuing with \\(x = 7\\):\n\\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14 = 2401 + 1715 + 441 - 7 - 14 = 3526\\), which is not zero.\n\nTesting \\(x = -7\\):\n\\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7)"
