            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out. I remember from algebra that one way to find roots is by using the Rational Root Theorem. That theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(p/q\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at the equation, the leading coefficient is 1 for \\(x^4\\), and the constant term is -14. So, the possible rational roots would be the factors of -14. That means the possible roots are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). Cool, so I don't have to deal with fractions since the leading coefficient is 1. That simplifies things a bit.\n\nNow, I should test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation and seeing if they satisfy it, meaning the equation equals zero. Let me start with the easiest one, which is 1.\n\nPlugging in \\(x=1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\).\nCalculating each term:\n1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14.\nAdding them up: 1+5 is 6, 6+9 is 15, 15-1 is 14, 14-14 is 0. Oh, so 1 is a root! That means (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial.\n\nGreat, so now that I have one root, I can try to perform polynomial division to factor out (x - 1) and reduce the equation to a lower degree polynomial. Maybe I can factor it further and find other roots.\n\nLet's set up the long division or synthetic division. Since I have the root 1, synthetic division might be quicker. \n\nWriting out the coefficients: 1 (for \\(x^4\\)), 5 (for \\(x^3\\)), 9 (for \\(x^2\\)), -1 (for x), and -14 (constant term).\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 1:\n\n1 | 1   5   9   -1"

Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next term: 5 +1 =6. Multiply by 1:6. Add to next term:9+6=15. Multiply by 1:15. Add to next term: -1 +15=14. Multiply by 1:14. Add to last term: -14 +14=0. Perfect, so the remainder is zero, which confirms that 1 is a root. The resulting polynomial after division is \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\). \n\nSo now, the original equation can be written as (x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14)=0. Now, I need to factor the cubic polynomial \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\). Let me see if there are any integer roots here as well. Again, applying the Rational Root Theorem. The constant term here is 14, and leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). Let me test these.\n\nStarting with x = -1:\n\nPlugging into the cubic: (-1)^3 +6(-1)^2 +15(-1) +14 = -1 +6(1) + (-15) +14. Calculating: -1 +6 is 5, 5 -15 is -10, -10 +14 is 4. Not zero. Hmm, so -1 is not a root.\n\nTrying x = -2:\n\n(-2)^3 +6(-2)^2 +15(-2) +14 = -8 +6(4) + (-30) +14. Let's compute step by step: -8 +24 =16, 16 -30 = -14, -14 +14 =0. Oh! So -2"
