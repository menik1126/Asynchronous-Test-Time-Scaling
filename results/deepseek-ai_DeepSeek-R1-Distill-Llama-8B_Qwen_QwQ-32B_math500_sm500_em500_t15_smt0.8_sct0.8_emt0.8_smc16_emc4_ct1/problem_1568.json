            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression I need to simplify into a fraction. The expression is a square root divided by another square root, and inside the numerator, there are three terms: 5 divided by the square root of 80, the square root of 845 divided by 9, and the square root of 45. Then, all of that is divided by the square root of 5. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to simplify each of the square roots in the numerator and the denominator. Maybe if I can express each square root as a product of a perfect square and another number, I can take those out of the radical. That should help me simplify each term.\n\nStarting with the first term in the numerator: 5 divided by the square root of 80. Let's focus on the square root of 80. I know that 80 can be factored into 16 and 5, because 16 times 5 is 80. And since 16 is a perfect square, its square root is 4. So, the square root of 80 is the same as the square root of 16 times 5, which is 4 times the square root of 5. Therefore, 5 divided by the square root of 80 is 5 divided by 4 times the square root of 5. That simplifies to (5 / (4\u221a5)). Hmm, maybe I can simplify this further by rationalizing the denominator. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and denominator by the square root of 5. That would give me (5\u221a5) / (4 * 5), which simplifies to (\u221a5)/4. Wait, let me double-check that. 5 divided by 4\u221a5: multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a5 gives (5\u221a5)/(4*5) because \u221a5 times \u221a5 is 5. So yes, that becomes \u221a5/4.\n\nAlright, moving on to the next term in the numerator: the square root of 845 divided by 9. Let me see if I can factor 845 into a product that includes a perfect square. Hmm, 845 divided by 5 is 169, so 845 is 5 times 169. And 169 is a perfect square because 13 times 13 is 169. So, the square"

Therefore, this term becomes 13\u221a5 divided by 9. So, 13\u221a5 / 9. I don't think I can simplify that further, so I'll leave it as is for now.\n\nThe next term is the square root of 45. Again, I need to express this as a multiple of a perfect square. 45 factors into 9 and 5, and 9 is a perfect square. So, square root of 45 is square root of 9 times 5, which is 3 times square root of 5. So, \u221a45 = 3\u221a5.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the numerator is 5/sqrt(80) + sqrt(845)/9 + sqrt(45), which we just simplified to \u221a5/4 + 13\u221a5/9 + 3\u221a5. So, all terms have a \u221a5 factor. Maybe I can factor that out to make it easier to add them up. Let's try that.\n\nSo, factoring out \u221a5, the numerator becomes \u221a5 times (1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Now, I need to compute the sum inside the parentheses. Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 is 3/1). The least common denominator is 36.\n\nConverting each term: 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, and 3 is 108/36. Adding them up: 9 + 52 + 108 is 169. So, the sum is 169/36. Therefore, the numerator simplifies to \u221a5 times 169/36, which is (169\u221a5)/36.\n\nNow, the entire expression is the square root of this numerator divided by the square root of 5. So, let me write that as sqrt[(169\u221a5)/36] divided by sqrt(5). Hmm, let me handle the numerator first. The square root of (169\u221a5)/36. Let's split that into sqrt(169/36) times sqrt(\u221a5).

Wait, sqrt(sqrt(5)) is equal to 5^(1/4), which is the fourth root of 5.

So, sqrt(\u221a5) is equal to 5^(1/2)^(1/2) = 5^(1/4), but perhaps I should rationalize this or express it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express the entire expression as a single radical. Let me consider sqrt[(169\u221a5)/36] divided by sqrt(5). That can be written as sqrt[(169\u221a5)/36] / sqrt(5) = sqrt[(169\u221a5)/(36*5)] because sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(a/b).

So, sqrt(169) is 13, sqrt(180) is sqrt(36*5) which is 6\u221a5. So, sqrt(169 * 5^(1/2) / 180) is equal to sqrt(169)/sqrt(180) * sqrt(\u221a5). So, that's 13 / (6\u221a5) * 5^(1/4).
