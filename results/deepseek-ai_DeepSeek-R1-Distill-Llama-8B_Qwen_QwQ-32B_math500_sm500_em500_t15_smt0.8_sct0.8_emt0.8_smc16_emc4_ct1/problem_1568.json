            "output": "Okay, so I've got this expression to simplify into a fraction: sqrt[(5/sqrt(80) + sqrt(845)/9 + sqrt(45)) / sqrt(5)]. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step. Let me write it out again to make sure I have it right.\n\nIt's the square root of a fraction, where the numerator is 5 over the square root of 80 plus the square root of 845 over 9 plus the square root of 45, and the denominator is the square root of 5. So, written out, it's:\n\n√[(5/√80 + √845/9 + √45) / √5]\n\nAlright, I think the key here is to simplify each term inside the numerator first before dealing with the denominator and the overall square root. Let's take each term one by one.\n\nStarting with 5/√80. Hmm, square roots in the denominator can be tricky, but I remember that to rationalize the denominator, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by √80. So, let me do that:\n\n5/√80 = (5 * √80) / (√80 * √80) = (5√80)/80.\n\nBut √80 can be simplified further because 80 is 16 times 5, and √16 is 4. So, √80 = 4√5. Let me substitute that back in:\n\n(5 * 4√5)/80 = (20√5)/80.\n\nNow, I can reduce that fraction. Both 20 and 80 are divisible by 20: 20/20 is 1 and 80/20 is 4. So, (20√5)/80 simplifies to √5/4.\n\nWait, no, hold on. If I have (20√5)/80, that's 20 divided by 80, which is 1/4, so it's (√5)/4. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nOkay, so 5/√80 simplifies to √5/4. Got that one down.\n\nNext term is √845 divided by 9. Hmm, 845. Let me see if I can factor that. 845 divided by 5 is 169, so 5 times 169. And 169 is 13 squared. So, 845 is 5 * 13²."

            "output": " So, √845 is √(5 * 13²) which is 13√5. So, √845 = 13√5.\n\nTherefore, √845 divided by 9 is (13√5)/9.\n\nAlright, third term is √45. Let's simplify that. 45 is 9 times 5, so √45 = √(9*5) = √9 * √5 = 3√5.\n\nSo now, let's rewrite the entire numerator with these simplifications:\n\n5/√80 + √845/9 + √45 = √5/4 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5.\n\nNow, all the terms have √5, so we can factor that out:\n\n√5 [1/4 + 13/9 + 3].\n\nNow, let's compute the values inside the brackets. First, 1/4 plus 13/9.\n\nTo add these, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 9 is 36. So, 1/4 is 9/36 and 13/9 is 52/36. Adding these together: 9 + 52 = 61, so 61/36.\n\nThen, adding 3 to that. 3 is 108/36. So, 61/36 + 108/36 = 169/36.\n\nSo, the numerator inside the brackets simplifies to 169/36, so putting it all together:\n\n√5 [169/36] = (169√5)/36.\n\nAlright, so now the entire expression inside the big square root is (169√5)/36 divided by √5.\n\nSo, we have [(169√5)/36] / √5.\n\nDividing by √5 is the same as multiplying by 1/√5, so:\n\n(169√5)/36 * 1/√5.\n\nHere, the √5 in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out, leaving us with 169/36.\n\nSo, now we just have to take the square root of 169/36.\n\n√(169/36) is √169 / √36, which is 13/6.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire original expression simplifies to 13/6.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I simplified each radical term, combined them by factoring out √"
