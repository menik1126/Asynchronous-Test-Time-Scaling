            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of possible meal combinations Yann and Camille can have without any restrictions. Since there are 10 dishes and each person can choose any dish, Yann has 10 options and Camille also has 10 options. This gives us 10 multiplied by 10, which equals 100 possible combinations.\n\nNext, I need to account for the restriction that they refuse to order the same dish. To find the number of combinations where both Yann and Camille order different dishes, I can subtract the number of combinations where they order the same dish from the total number of combinations.\n\nThe number of combinations where Yann and Camille order the same dish is equal to the number of dishes, which is 10 (one for each dish Yann could choose).\n\nSubtracting this from the total combinations gives us 100 minus 10, which equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order without having the same dish.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order without having the same dish, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Possible Combinations:**\n   - There are 10 dishes available.\n   - Yann has 10 choices.\n   - Camille also has 10 choices.\n   \n   So, the total number of combinations is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 10 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract Combinations Where They Order the Same Dish:**\n   - If they both order the same dish, there are 10 such combinations (one for each dish).\n   \n   Therefore, the number of combinations where they order different dishes is:\n   \\[\n   100 \\text{ (total)} - 10 \\text{ (same dishes)} = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
