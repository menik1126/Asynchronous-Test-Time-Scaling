            "output": "First, I need to understand the problem. There are 10 dishes on the menu, and Yann and Camille each want to order one dish. They don't want to order the same dish. Additionally, it matters who orders what, meaning the order matters (Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken).\n\nTo solve this, I'll consider the different ways they can choose dishes without duplication. There are two scenarios: Yann chooses first and Camille chooses after, and vice versa.\n\nIn the first scenario, Yann has 10 options. Once Yann has chosen, Camille has 9 remaining options (since she can't choose the same dish). So, the number of combinations in this scenario is 10 * 9.\n\nIn the second scenario, Camille chooses first and then Yann. Again, Camille has 10 options, and Yann has 9 options, leading to another 10 * 9 combinations.\n\nTo find the total number of different meal combinations, I'll add the combinations from both scenarios: 10 * 9 + 10 * 9 = 180.\n\nTherefore, there are 180 different combinations of meals that Yann and Camille can order without choosing the same dish.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order, we need to consider that each of them orders one dish from a menu of 10 items, and they do not wish to order the same dish. Additionally, the order of who orders which dish matters.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n- Total dishes available: 10\n- Each person can choose one dish.\n- They refuse to order the same dish.\n- The order matters (Yann orders dish A and Camille orders dish B is different from Yann ordering dish B and Camille ordering dish A).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Combinations**\nWe can approach this problem by considering all possible pairs of dishes where Yann and Camille order different dishes. Since the order matters, we can treat this as a permutation problem.\n\nFor two people, the number of ways to choose two different dishes from 10 is given by the permutation formula:\n\\[ P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)! \\]\nWhere:\n- \\( n = 10 \\) (total dishes)\n- \\( k = 2 \\) (number of people)\n\nPl"

Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, actually, the permutation formula \\( P(10, 2) \\) already accounts for the order. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, consider the choices step-by-step:\n\n- **Yann's choice**: He can choose any of the 10 dishes.\n- **Camille's choice**: After Yann has chosen, Camille must choose a different dish, so she has 9 options left.\n\nThus, the total number of combinations is:\n\\[\n10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\nWait, but why did I initially think 180? Because I considered two scenarios (Yann first or Camille first), but actually, the order of choosing is already accounted for in the multiplication principle. \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nWhen we say Yann has 10 choices and Camille has 9, this already considers all ordered pairs where Yann's dish is first and Camille's is second. Since the problem states that the order matters (Yann ordering chicken and Camille fish is different from the reverse), this is exactly the permutation count. \n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"different combinations of meals\" where order matters. So perhaps the answer is indeed 90. But why did I think 180 earlier?\n\nWait, perhaps I confused combinations and permutations. Let me re-express:\n\nIf order matters, the number of permutations of 10 dishes taken 2 at a time is \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\). \n\nAlternatively, if order didn't matter, it would be combinations: \\( \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\). But since order does matter, it's double that, so 90. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 90. \n\nWait, but in my first reasoning, I thought of two scenarios (Yann first or Camille first), but actually, the multiplication principle already accounts for the order. \n\nWait, perhaps my first reasoning was wrong.

So:\n\n1. **Yann chooses first**: 10 options.\n2. **Camille chooses second**: 9 options (since she can't choose what Yann chose).\n\nSo, total ways: 10 × 9 = 90.\n\nAlternatively, if Yann were to choose second, Camille chooses first:\n\n1. **Camille chooses first**: 10 options.\n2. **Yann chooses second**: 9 options.\n\nTotal ways: 10 × 9 = 90.\n\nBut if we consider that Yann can choose first or second, the total becomes 90 + 90 = 180.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the problem, Yann and Camille are two distinct individuals, and their choices are ordered (Yann's choice is first, Camille's is second). So we don't need to consider both scenarios separately; each combination is uniquely determined by Yann's and Camille's choices in sequence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10 × 9 = 90.\n\nWait, confusion arises because I'm overcounting. Let me see:\n\nIf we denote Y's choice and C's choice, then the number of ordered pairs where Y and C have different dishes is 10 × 9 = 90.\n\nHence, the correct number of different meal combinations is 90.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it says \"how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish.\" Since the order matters (Y orders A, C orders B is different from Y orders B and C orders A), we need to consider all possible ordered pairs where the two dishes are different.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10 × 9 = 90.\n\nBut wait, another way: For each of the 10 dishes Yann can choose, Camille has 9 options, so 10 × 9 = 90.\n\nYes, that's the accurate calculation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"
