I need to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, since the roots are distinct integers, let me think about what that implies for the polynomial. If all the roots are integers, then the polynomial can be factored into linear terms with integer roots. So, I can write \\( f(x) \\) as:\n\n\\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\)\n\nwhere each \\( r_i \\) is an integer, and all \\( r_i \\) are distinct.\n\nNow, expanding this, the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is \\( 2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 66 \\). So, the product of the roots times \\( (-1)^n \\times 2 \\) gives me 66. That means the product of the roots is \\( \\frac{66}{(-1)^n \\times 2} \\). Since all the roots are integers, they must be factors of 66 (up to the sign depending on n).\n\nLet me think about the factors of 66. The prime factors of 66 are 2, 3, and 11. So, the possible integer roots are the combinations of these primes and their negatives. The possible roots could be ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66.\n\nNow, I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product, when multiplied by \\( 2 \\times (-1)^n \\), gives 66. But wait, actually, 2 is already factored out, so the product \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\) should be \\( \\pm \\frac{66}{2} = \\pm33 \\). So the product of the roots is either 33 or -33.\n\nSo, I need to factor 33 into distinct integer factors. Let's consider both positive and negative possibilities because the product"

But since the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the sign.\n\nWait, actually, the product of the roots is \\( \\frac{a_0}{2 \\times (-1)^n} \\). Since \\( a_0 = 66 \\), so:\n\n\\( \\prod_{i=1}^n r_i = \\frac{66}{2 \\times (-1)^n} = \\frac{33}{(-1)^n} \\).\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. Hmm, but actually, since n is the degree, which can be any integer greater than or equal to 1, but since the roots are distinct integers, the minimal degree would be the number of roots, so n is at least 1, but probably higher. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the degree, so maybe we can choose the degree as needed? Wait, but the question is asking for the minimal |a_{n-1}|, so perhaps we can choose the degree to minimize that coefficient?\n\nHmm, so maybe the key is to choose the roots such that their product is 33 or -33, and then arrange them so that the coefficient a_{n-1} is minimized in absolute value. Since a_{n-1} is the coefficient of x^{n-1}, which in the expanded form is 2 times the sum of the roots multiplied by (-1)^{n-1} divided by something? Wait, let me recall Vieta's formula.\n\nVieta's formula for a monic polynomial (leading coefficient 1) tells us that the coefficient of x^{n-1} is the negative of the sum of the roots. But here, the polynomial is not monic; it's 2 times a monic polynomial. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the polynomial is \\( 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\). Then expanding this, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is 2 times the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the monic polynomial. The monic polynomial would have coefficient of x^{n-1} as - (r_"

Wait, Vieta's formula for a polynomial \\( a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 \\), the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n. So, in this case, since a_n = 2, the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/2. Hence, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots).\n\nSo, since we need to minimize |a_{n-1}|, that means we need to minimize |sum of roots|. Therefore, the minimal |sum| multiplied by 2 would give the minimal |a_{n-1}|.\n\nSo, the key is to choose roots such that their sum is as small as possible in absolute value, given that their product is either 33 or -33, and all roots are distinct integers.\n\nSo, how can we factor 33 (and -33) into distinct integer factors. Let's consider all possible factorizations.\n\nSince 33 is 3*11, and its positive divisors are 1,3,11,33, same for negative.\n\nWe need to find the minimal |sum| for such a set of integers whose product is 33 or -33, with all factors distinct.\n\nSo, let's enumerate all possible sets of integers, both positive and negative, that multiply to 33 or -33, with distinct factors, and find the set with the minimal sum.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nFirst, let me consider both cases: product is 33 and product is -33.\n\nCase 1: Product is 33.\n\nPossible factorizations into distinct integers:\n\n1. 1, 3, 11: product is 1*3*11=33, sum is 1+3+11=15.\n\n2. 1, -3, -11: product is 1*(-3)*(-11)=33, sum is 1 -3 -11= -13.\n\n3. 1, 33: But this is only two roots, product 1*33=33, sum=34.\n\n4. 3, 11: sum=14.\n\n5. 1, -1, -33:"
