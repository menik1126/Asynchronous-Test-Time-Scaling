The polynomial has distinct integer roots, and I know that the leading coefficient \\( a_n = 2 \\) and the constant term \\( a_0 = 66 \\). The question is asking for the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by recalling that for a polynomial with integer coefficients and integer roots, the polynomial can be factored into linear terms with integer roots. So, since it has distinct integer roots, we can write it as \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), where each \\( r_i \\) is an integer, and all \\( r_i \\) are distinct.\n\nGiven that \\( a_0 = 66 \\), which is the constant term, and in the polynomial \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), the constant term is \\( 2 \\times (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\). Since \\( a_0 = 66 \\), we have:\n\n\\( 2 \\times (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 66 \\)\n\nSo, \\( (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 33 \\). Therefore, \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = \\pm 33 \\) depending on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd.\n\nBut since \\( n \\) is the degree of the polynomial, I need to figure out the possible number of roots and their factors.\n\nAlso, the coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) is the sum of the roots multiplied by \\( -2 \\). Wait, let me recall Vieta's formula. For a monic polynomial \\( x^n + b_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + b_0 \\), the sum of the roots is \\( -b_{n-1} \\). But our polynomial is \\( 2x^n +"

Let me check.\n\nYes, for a polynomial \\( f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0 \\), Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of the roots \\( r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n = -a_{n-1}/a_n \\). So in our case, since \\( a_n = 2 \\), it's \\( -a_{n-1}/2 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( a_{n-1} = -2(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n) \\). So the absolute value \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) is \\( 2|r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n| \\). Our goal is to minimize this value.\n\nGiven that the product \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = \\pm 33 \\), and each \\( r_i \\) is an integer. Also, the roots must be distinct, so all \\( r_i \\) are distinct integers.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: Find a set of distinct integers whose product is \\( \\pm 33 \\), and the absolute value of their sum is as small as possible. Then, multiply that minimal sum by 2 to get \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nFirst, let me factorize 33 to see what possible sets of roots we can have.\n\n33 factors as \\( 3 \\times 11 \\). Since 33 is positive, and considering the polynomial can have a positive or negative constant term depending on the number of roots. So, the product is either 33 or -33.\n\nSo, the possible roots are factors of 33. Let me list all possible integer divisors of 33, considering both positive and negative.\n\nFactors of 33 are \\( \\pm1, \\pm3, \\pm11, \\pm33 \\).\n\nBut we are to choose a set of distinct integers from these factors such that their product is 33 or -33. Also, the number of roots will be equal to the number of factors, so the number of roots"

Wait, no, actually, the roots must multiply to 33 or -33, so each root must divide 33 or -33. Since the roots are integers, each root must be a divisor of 33 or -33. So the possible roots are among the divisors of 33, which are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b111, \u00b133. So the roots can only be these numbers, but they have to be distinct.\n\nTherefore, the roots must be selected from these 8 numbers, but with distinct values. So the possible number of roots can be up to 8, but since 33 has only four positive divisors, but with signs, so 8 total. But since they have to multiply to 33 or -33, so the product must be exactly 33 or -33.\n\nWait, but actually, the product of the roots multiplied by 2 (the leading coefficient) gives the constant term? Wait, no, the constant term is 2 times the product of the roots times (-1)^n. Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, the polynomial is \\( 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n) \\). Expanding this, the constant term is \\( 2 \\times (-r_1)(-r_2)...(-r_n) = 2 \\times (-1)^n (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) \\). Since the constant term is 66, so:\n\n\\( 2 \\times (-1)^n (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 66 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( (-1)^n (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 33 \\).\n\nSo, the product of the roots \\( r_1 r_2 ... r_n \\) is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n.
