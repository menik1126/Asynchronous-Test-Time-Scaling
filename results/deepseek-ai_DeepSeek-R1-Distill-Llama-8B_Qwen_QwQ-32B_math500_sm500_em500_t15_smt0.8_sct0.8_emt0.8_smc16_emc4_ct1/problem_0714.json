            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: \"How many y-intercepts does the graph of the parabola x = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1 have?\" Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst off, I remember that a y-intercept is a point where the graph crosses the y-axis. And I know that on the y-axis, the value of x is always zero. So, to find the y-intercept(s), I need to find the value(s) of y when x is zero. That sounds straightforward.\n\nThe equation is x = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1. So, if I set x to 0, I can solve for y, right? Let me write that down:\n\n0 = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1\n\nHmm, okay, so this is a quadratic equation in terms of y. Quadratic equations usually have two solutions, but sometimes they can have one or none, depending on the discriminant. Wait, but since the problem is asking how many y-intercepts there are, it's essentially asking how many real solutions this equation has when x=0.\n\nSo, the equation is y\u00b2 - 4y - 1 = 0. To solve for y, I can use the quadratic formula. Let me recall the quadratic formula: for an equation of the form ay\u00b2 + by + c = 0, the solutions are y = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a). \n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -1. Plugging these into the formula:\n\ny = (-(-4) \u00b1 \u221a((-4)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-1))) / (2*1)\ny = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 4)) / 2\ny = (4 \u00b1 \u221a20) / 2\n\nWait, \u221a20 can be simplified. \u221a20 is equal to 2\u221a5, so substituting that in:\n\ny = (4 \u00b1 2\u221a5) / 2\n\nI can factor out a 2 in the numerator:\n\ny = 2*(2 \u00b1 \u221a5) / 2\n\nThe 2s cancel out, so:\n\ny = 2 \u00b1 \u221a5\n\nAlright, so there are two solutions for y: y = 2 + \u221a5 and y = 2 - \u221a5. \n\n\u221a5 is approximately"

            "output": " 2.236, so let me calculate the numerical values:\n\nFor y = 2 + \u221a5: 2 + 2.236 \u2248 4.236\nFor y = 2 - \u221a5: 2 - 2.236 \u2248 -0.236\n\nSo, the graph crosses the y-axis at approximately (0, 4.236) and (0, -0.236). That means there are two y-intercepts.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The equation is x = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1. That means this is a parabola that opens either to the right or to the left. Let me check the direction it opens. Since the coefficient of y\u00b2 is positive (1), the parabola opens to the right. So, it's a parabola that opens towards the positive x-direction.\n\nNow, for a parabola that opens to the right, the vertex is a minimum point. Let's find the vertex to get an idea of how the parabola behaves. The vertex of a parabola given by x = ay\u00b2 + by + c is at (h, k) where h = -b/(2a). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, hold on. In the standard form of a parabola that opens to the right, x = a(y - k)\u00b2 + h, the vertex is at (h, k). But in our equation, it's x = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1. Let me rewrite it in vertex form.\n\nTo complete the square for the y terms:\n\nx = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1\nx = (y\u00b2 - 4y) - 1\nx = (y\u00b2 - 4y + 4) - 4 - 1\nx = (y - 2)\u00b2 - 5\n\nSo, in vertex form, it's x = (y - 2)\u00b2 - 5. That tells me the vertex is at (h, k) = (-5, 2). So, the vertex is at x = -5, y = 2.\n\nSince the parabola opens to the right, the vertex is the lowest point on the graph. So, the graph comes from the left, reaches the vertex at (-5, 2), and then opens to the right, going upwards from there.\n\nNow, going"

Since the vertex is at (-5, 2), which is to the left of the y-axis (since x is -5), and the parabola opens to the right, it should cross the y-axis (where x=0) at two points. That matches with the two solutions we found earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the equation x = y\u00b2 -4y -1. When x is 0, the equation becomes y\u00b2 -4y -1 =0, which is quadratic in y, so discriminant D = (16) +4 = 20, which is positive, so two real roots. Therefore, two y-intercepts.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2. \n\nWait, but let me just confirm once again. Sometimes, maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me recalculate the discriminant:\n\nThe quadratic equation is y\u00b2 -4y -1 =0. So, a=1, b=-4, c=-1.\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac = (-4)^2 -4*(1)*(-1) = 16 - (-4) ?\n\nWait, no, wait: 4ac is 4*1*(-1) = -4. So, D = 16 - (4*1*(-1)) ?\n\nWait, the formula is b\u00b2 -4ac. So, substituting:\n\nD = (-4)^2 -4*(1)*(-1) = 16 - ( -4 )? Wait, no, 4ac is 4*1*(-1) = -4, so -4ac would be -4*(1)*(-1) = +4. Wait, no, let me do it step by step.\n\nWait, D = b\u00b2 - 4ac. So, substituting:\n\nb squared is (-4)^2 = 16.\n\nThen, 4ac is 4*(1)*(-1) = -4.\n\nSo, D = 16 - (4ac) = 16 - (-4) = 16 +4 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So discriminant is 20, which is positive, so two real roots. Therefore, two y-intercepts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the graph"

But in this case, the vertex is at x=-5, so the graph is to the left of x=-5, opening to the right. So, when x=0, which is to the right of the vertex, it's definitely going to cross the y-axis at two points.\n\nWait, another thought: since it's a function of y, is it possible for it to not be a function? Wait, x is a function of y, so each y gives one x. But it's a sideways parabola, so for each x beyond the vertex, there are two y-values. So, when x=0, which is greater than the vertex x=-5, there are two y-intercepts. \n\nYes, that makes sense.
