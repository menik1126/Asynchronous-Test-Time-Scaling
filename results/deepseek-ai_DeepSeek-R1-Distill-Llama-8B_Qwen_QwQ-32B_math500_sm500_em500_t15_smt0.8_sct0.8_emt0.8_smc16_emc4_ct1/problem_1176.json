The area is expressed in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime. Then I have to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I recall that solving quartic equations can be tricky, but maybe there's a way to factor this equation. The coefficients involve powers of \\( i \\) which suggests that maybe substituting \\( z = it \\) might simplify things. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). It seems like each term alternates in sign and involves \\( i \\) or higher powers. Maybe I can factor it by grouping terms or look for a pattern.\n\nWait, let me check for a possible substitution. The coefficients of \\( z^4 \\) and the constant term are both 1 and -i, which are similar to the expansion of a binomial. Let me see if this resembles any familiar expansion.\n\nThe equation looks similar to \\( (z + a)^4 \\) but with complex coefficients. Let me think about the expansion of \\( (z + iz)^4 \\). Let's compute that:\n\n\\( (z + iz)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3(i) + 6z^2(i)^2 + 4z(i)^3 + (i)^4 z^0 \\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n- \\( z^4 \\) is just \\( z^4 \\).\n- \\( 4z^3i \\) is as in the original equation.\n- \\( 6z^2(i)^2 = 6z^2(-1) = -6z^2 \\), which matches the equation.\n- \\( 4z(i)^3 = 4z(-i) = -4zi \\), which also matches.\n- \\( (i)^4 = 1 \\), so the constant term is 1, but in the original equation, it's -i.\n\nHmm, so the expansion"

Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the expansion step by step:\n\nLet me let \\( (z + i)^4 \\). Wait, maybe I should try a different substitution. Let me try \\( (z + i)^4 \\).\n\nWait, let me try \\( (z + i)^4 \\):\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2(i)^2 + 4z(i)^3 + (i)^4 \\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( z^4 \\)\n- \\( 4z^3i \\)\n- \\( 6z^2(-1) = -6z^2 \\)\n- \\( 4z(-i) = -4zi \\)\n- \\( (i)^4 = 1 \\)\n\nSo altogether, \\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 \\).\n\nComparing this to the given equation:\n\nOriginal equation: \\( z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i =0 \\).\n\nSo the difference between the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\) and the given equation is the constant term.

Because translation doesn't change the shape. So the polygon formed by the solutions \\( z \\) is a square, just shifted down by (0, -1).
