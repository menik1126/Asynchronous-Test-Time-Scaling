The solutions are supposed to form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon. The answer should be in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( p \\) is prime, and then compute \\( a + b + p \\). Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst off, dealing with quartic equations can be tricky, but maybe there's a way to factor this or use substitution. Let me see if I can factor it or recognize it as a known polynomial.\n\nLooking at the equation again: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). The coefficients involve powers of \\( i \\) with real numbers. The presence of \\( i \\) suggests that perhaps a substitution involving \\( w = z i \\) or something might help, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe this is a cyclotomic polynomial or related to one.\n\nWait, let me try to see if substituting \\( w = z i \\) would simplify things. If I let \\( w = z i \\), then \\( z = w / i = -i w \\) since \\( 1/i = -i \\). Let me substitute \\( z = -i w \\) into the equation.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\\( (-i w)^4 + 4(-i w)^3 i - 6(-i w)^2 - 4(-i w)i - i = 0 \\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1. \\( (-i w)^4 = (-i)^4 w^4 = (1) w^4 \\) since \\( (-i)^4 = ( (-i)^2 )^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 \\).\n2. \\( 4(-i w)^3 i = 4(-i)^3 w^3 i = 4(-i)^3 i w^3 \\).

The angles between each root are separated by π/2, so they are spaced 90 degrees apart. So, the four points are equally spaced on a circle of radius 2^{1/8} centered at -i. Therefore, the polygon is a square, rotated by π/16, centered at (0, -1). The area of a square is (side length)^2. Alternatively, since it's a square inscribed in a circle of radius r, the diagonal is 2r, so the side length is (2r)/√2 = √2 r, so area is (√2 r)^2 = 2 r^2.

The diagonal of the square is the distance between two opposite vertices, which is 2r, so area is (2r)^2 / 2 = 2r^2. So, yes, that formula holds.

Since the roots are spaced at 90-degree intervals, the shape they form is indeed a square.\n\nTo compute the area, since the square is centered at (0, -1), but in terms of scaling, each vertex is at a distance of 2^{1/8} from (0, -1). The distance between adjacent vertices, i.e., the side length, can be found using the chord length. The chord length for a central angle of 90 degrees (π/2 radians) in a circle of radius r is \\( 2 r \\sin(\\theta/2) \\), where θ is the central angle. So here, θ = π/2, so chord length = 2 r sin(π/4) = 2 r (√2/2) = r √2.\n\nSo, side length s = r √2, so area = s^2 = (r √2)^2 = 2 r^2.\n\nSince r is 2^{1/8}, then r^2 is 2^{1/4}, so area is 2 * 2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^{5/4}, which is in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where p=2, a=5, b=4. Since 2 is a prime and 5 and 4 are coprime, the answer would be a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check that the area calculation is correct because I might have made a mistake in the side length approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using coordinates. Let me calculate each vertex point and use the shoelace formula.\n\nSo, let me compute each of the four points:\n\nFor k=0:\nθ = π/16\nx = 2^{1/8} cos(π/16)\ny = 2^{1/8} sin(π/16) -1\n\nSimilarly for k=1,2,3, but each will have angles π/16, 9π/16, 17π/16, 25π/16.\n\nLet me denote \\( R = 2^{1/8} \\), so:\n\nPoint 1 (k="

Wait, but let me confirm with coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area is indeed 2 R^2, so 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2^{5/4}, so the answer is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. But let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the equation is \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\). So, the roots are equally spaced around the circle centered at -i with radius |1 + i|^{1/4} = (sqrt(2))^{1/4} = 2^{1/8}, which matches the earlier calculation. Since they are spaced at 90 degrees, the polygon is a square. The area of a square with vertices on a circle of radius r is 2 r^2, so that's 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}, so the area is 2^{5/4}, so p=2, a=5, b=4, so 5+4+2=11"
