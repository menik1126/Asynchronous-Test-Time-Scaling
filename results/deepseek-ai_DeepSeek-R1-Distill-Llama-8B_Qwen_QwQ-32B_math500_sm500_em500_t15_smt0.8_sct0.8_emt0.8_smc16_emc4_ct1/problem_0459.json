Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down what's given. The constraint is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), and I need to minimize \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). That expression \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) reminds me of expanding it to see if it can be simplified or expressed in terms that relate to the given constraint.\n\nLet me try expanding \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). That would give me \\(xy + y^2 + yz + xz\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe there's another approach. Since the constraint involves \\(xyz\\) and \\(x + y + z\\), perhaps I can use some inequality or substitution to relate these.\n\nI know that inequalities like AM-GM often come into play for optimization problems with products and sums. Maybe I can apply AM-GM here. Let me think. The given condition is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), which is a product of four variables: \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and the sum \\(x + y + z\\). The expression I need to minimize is the product of two sums, each involving two variables.\n\nWait, maybe I can use substitution. Let me denote \\(S = x + y + z\\). Then, the constraint becomes \\(xyzS = 1\\). That might be helpful. I need to express \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) in terms of \\(S\\) or other variables.\n\nLet me compute \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). As I did before, that's \\(xy + y^2 + yz + xz\\). I can write this as \\(y(x + y + z) + xz\\), since \\(y(x + y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz\\), and then adding \\(xz\\) gives the whole expression.
