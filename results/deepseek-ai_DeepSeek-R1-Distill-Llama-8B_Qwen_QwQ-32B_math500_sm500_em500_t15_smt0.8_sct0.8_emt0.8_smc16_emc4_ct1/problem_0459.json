Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the given condition tells me. The condition is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). That means the product of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and their sum is 1. I need to relate this to the expression I need to minimize, which is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\).\n\nLet me write out \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). If I expand this, it becomes \\(y(x + y + z) + xz\\). Wait, that's interesting because the given condition involves \\(x + y + z\\). Maybe I can substitute or relate these terms somehow.\n\nSo, from the condition, \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), which implies that \\(x + y + z = \\frac{1}{xyz}\\). Let me note that down: \\(x + y + z = \\frac{1}{xyz}\\). That might be useful later.\n\nNow, going back to \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), which I expanded to \\(y(x + y + z) + xz\\). Let me substitute \\(x + y + z\\) with \\(\\frac{1}{xyz}\\) as I found. So, that becomes \\(y \\cdot \\frac{1}{xyz} + xz\\). Simplifying \\(y \\cdot \\frac{1}{xyz}\\), the \\(y\\) in the numerator cancels with one \\(y\\) in the denominator, so it becomes \\(\\frac{1}{xz}\\). So, now the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{xz} + xz\\).\n\nHmm, so now I have \\((x + y)(y + z) = \\frac{1}{xz} + xz\\). That looks easier to work with. So, I need to minimize \\(\\frac{1}{xz} + xz\\) given that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are positive real numbers"

I remember that AM-GM is useful for finding minima or maxima of expressions involving products and sums.\n\nLooking at \\(\\frac{1}{xz} + xz\\), I notice that this is of the form \\(a + \\frac{1}{a}\\), where \\(a = xz\\). I know that for such expressions, the minimum occurs at \\(a = 1\\), giving a minimum value of 2. But wait, is that directly applicable here?\n\nHold on, but in this case, \\(a = xz\\) isn't independent because \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) are related through the condition \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). So, I can't just treat \\(a = xz\\) as a separate variable without considering the other variables and their relationships.\n\nMaybe I should consider more variables. Let me set \\(a = xz\\). Then, perhaps express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(a\\), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's go back to the condition \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). I can write \\(x + y + z = \\frac{1}{xyz}\\), as I did earlier. So, if I let \\(S = x + y + z\\), then \\(S = \\frac{1}{xyz}\\).\n\nIs there a way to express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(z\\)? Maybe, but perhaps another approach is better.\n\nAnother thought: maybe use substitution to reduce the number of variables. Let me assume that \\(x = z\\). Since the expression we are trying to minimize is symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) (i.e., swapping \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) leaves it unchanged), perhaps the minimum occurs when \\(x = z\\). This is a common technique in optimization problems with symmetric variables.\n\nSo, let me set \\(x = z\\). Then, the expression becomes \\((x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)^2\\).
