Since 3.6 is already an exact number, its ceiling is 4.\n\nNext, I'll square 3.6. This gives me 12.96.\n\nNow, I'll find the ceiling of 12.96. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest whole number, so the ceiling of 12.96 is 13.\n\nFinally, I'll compute the second part of the equation by squaring the ceiling of 3.6, which is 4 squared, resulting in 16.\n\nSubtracting the second part from the first gives me 13 minus 16, which equals -3.\n</think>\n\n**Problem:** Evaluate \\(\\lceil (3.6)^2 \\rceil - ( \\lceil 3.6 \\rceil ) ^2\\).\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the ceiling of 3.6:**\n   \\[\n   \\lceil 3.6 \\rceil = 4\n   \\]\n   Since 3.6 is already a whole number, its ceiling remains 4.\n\n2. **Square 3.6:**\n   \\[\n   (3.6)^2 = 12.96\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the ceiling of \\(12.96\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\lceil 12.96 \\rceil = 13\n   \\]\n   The ceiling function rounds up to the next whole number.\n\n4. **Square the ceiling of 3.6:**\n   \\[\n   (4)^2 = 16\n   \\]\n\n5. **Subtract the squared ceiling from the ceiling of the square:**\n   \\[\n   \\lceil (3.6)^2 \\rceil - ( \\lceil 3.6 \\rceil ) ^2 = 13 - 16 = -3\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{-3}\n\\]"
