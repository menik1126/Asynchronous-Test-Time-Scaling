Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Understand the Conversion Process**:\n   - We'll divide the decimal number by 6 repeatedly and record the remainders. These remainders will form the base six number, read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Conversion**:\n   - **First Division**:\n     \\[\n     999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n     \\]\n     - **Quotient**: 166\n     - **Remainder**: 3\n\n   - **Second Division**:\n     \\[\n     166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n     \\]\n     - **Quotient**: 27\n     - **Remainder**: 4\n\n   - **Third Division**:\n     \\[\n     27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n     \\]\n     - **Quotient**: 4\n     - **Remainder**: 3\n\n   - **Fourth Division**:\n     \\[\n     4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n     \\]\n     - **Quotient**: 0\n     - **Remainder**: 4\n\n3. **Reading the Remainders**:\n   - The remainders, read from the last division to the first, give us the base six number:\n   \\[\n   4,\\"
