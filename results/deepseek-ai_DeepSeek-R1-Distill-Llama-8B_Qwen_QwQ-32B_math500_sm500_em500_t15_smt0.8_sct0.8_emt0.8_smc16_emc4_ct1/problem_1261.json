Since we can only use whole sixes, I'll take the integer part, which is 166.\n\nNow, I'll multiply 166 by 6 to find the value of the next place in base six.\n\n166 \u00d7 6 = 996.\n\nSubtracting this from 999 gives a remainder:\n\n999 - 996 = 3.\n\nThis remainder will be the digit in the units place of the base six number.\n\nSince there are no digits left to process, the base six number is formed by arranging these values from highest to lowest place values, resulting in 3 in the sixes place and 3 in the units place.\n\nTherefore, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 333 base six.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide by 6 and find the quotient and remainder:**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Use the quotient to find the next higher place value:**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Continue dividing until all digits are processed:**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Arrange the remainders from highest to lowest place values:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 6^2 + 3 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0 = 333_6\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{333_6}\n\\]"
