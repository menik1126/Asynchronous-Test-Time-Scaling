This means that Trinkets are more valuable than Blinkets.\n\nNext, the problem states that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. So, there's a direct relationship between Blinkets and Drinkets.\n\nTo find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, I'll start by converting Drinkets to Blinkets using the second equation. Since 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, 1 Blinket equals 7/3 Drinkets.\n\nThen, I'll convert Blinkets to Trinkets using the first equation. Because 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, 1 Blinket equals 1/4 Trinkets.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the value of 56 Drinkets by converting them to Blinkets first: 56 Drinkets \u00d7 7/3 Blinkets/Drinket = 168 Blinkets.\n\nNext, I'll convert those 168 Blinkets to Trinkets: 168 Blinkets \u00d7 1/4 Trinket/Blinket = 42 Trinkets.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are equal to 42 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow the relationships provided step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - **Trinkets (T) to Blinkets (B):** \\(1\\,T = 4\\,B\\)\n   - **Blinkets (B) to Drinkets (D):** \\(3\\,B = 7\\,D\\)\n\n2. **Express Drinkets in Terms of Trinkets:**\n   - First, express Drinkets in terms of Blinkets:\n     \\[\n     3\\,B = 7\\,D \\implies 1\\,D = \\frac{3}{7}\\,B\n     \\]\n   - Next, express Blinkets in terms of Trinkets:\n     \\[\n     1\\,T = 4\\,B \\implies 1\\,B = \\frac{1}{4}\\,T\n     \\]\n   - Combine the two to express Drinkets in terms of Trinkets:\n     \\[\n     1\\,D = \\frac{3}{7}\\,B = \\frac"
