Hmm, okay. Let me try to process this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what is being asked. I need to minimize the product of two terms: \\((x + y)\\) and \\((y + z)\\). Since all variables are positive, I know that each of these terms is also positive. So, I need to find the configuration of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) that makes this product as small as possible, under the given constraint.\n\nThe constraint is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). That seems a bit complex. Maybe I can use some inequality to relate the terms. The problem reminds me of optimization problems where we apply the AM-GM inequality, which is often useful for finding minima or maxima under certain constraints.\n\nLet me recall the AM-GM inequality: For non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. In other words, for numbers \\(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\), we have\n\\[\n\\frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n},\n\\]\nwith equality when all \\(a_i\\) are equal.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can express \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) in a way that allows me to apply AM-GM. Let me try to expand \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) first:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, maybe I can think of substituting variables or expressing the constraint in terms that can be related to the expression we need to minimize.\n\nLet me think about the constraint \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). Maybe I can denote \\(s = x + y + z\\). Then the constraint becomes \\(xyzs = 1\\).\n\nWait, but then I have four variables: \\(x\\), \\(y"

Hmm, not sure if that substitution helps yet.\n\nPerhaps I can set some variables equal to each other to simplify the problem. Since the expression \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) involves \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), and the constraint is symmetric in \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), maybe assuming some symmetry could help find the minimum.\n\nFor example, maybe setting \\(x = z\\) would make things symmetric, which might lead to the minimal value. Let me try that.\n\nAssume \\(x = z\\). Then, the constraint becomes \\(x y x (x + y + x) = 1\\), which simplifies to \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\).\n\nThe expression to minimize becomes \\((x + y)(y + x)\\), which is \\((x + y)^2\\). Hmm, that might be easier to handle.\n\nSo, let me write the problem under this assumption: minimize \\((x + y)^2\\) subject to \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\).\n\nHmm, maybe I can make another substitution here. Let's denote \\(t = x + y\\). Then, \\(y = t - x\\). Hmm, but that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express \\(t\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Wait, perhaps using substitution in terms of ratios.\n\nWait, maybe I can let \\(k = \\frac{x}{y}\\) and \\(m = \\frac{z}{y}\\). Since I assumed \\(x = z\\), then \\(k = m\\), so let me just define \\(k = \\frac{x}{y}\\), so \\(x = ky\\), and since \\(x = z\\), then \\(z = ky\\).\n\nSubstituting this into the constraint: \\(x y z (x + y + z) = (ky) y (ky) (ky + y + ky) = k y \\cdot y \\cdot k y \\cdot (2k y + y)\\).\n\nSimplify that: \\(k^2 y^3 (2k + 1)y = k^2 (2k + 1) y^4 = 1\\).\n\nSo, \\("

To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of \\(f(k)\\) with respect to \\(k\\), set it to zero, and solve for \\(k\\).\n\nBut this might get a bit messy. Let me see if there's a better substitution or maybe a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption of \\(x = z\\) is leading me to a path that's too complicated. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of assuming \\(x = z\\), I can use Lagrange multipliers. Since this is an optimization problem with a constraint, Lagrange multipliers might be a good approach here.\n\nLet me recall how Lagrange multipliers work. If I have a function \\(f(x, y, z)\\) to minimize subject to a constraint \\(g(x, y, z) = 0\\), then the gradients of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) must be proportional at the minimum. So, \\(\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nIn this case, the function to minimize is \\(f(x, y, z) = (x + y)(y + z)\\), and the constraint is \\(g(x, y, z) = xyz(x + y + z) - 1 = 0\\).\n\nFirst, let me compute the partial derivatives of \\(f\\):\n\nCompute \\(f = ("

Let me see if I can get the same result using AM-GM.\n\nAlternatively, think of the expression (x + y)(y + z). Maybe I can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using substitution to reduce variables.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me set t = y. So, express x and z in terms of t.\n\nBut, without knowing more, that's difficult.\n\nWait, but earlier substitution with x = z and k = x/y led me to the minimal value, so I think that's the right way, which gives the minimal value of 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the minimal value is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum value is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nGiven \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are positive real numbers such that \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), we need to find the minimum value of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\).\n\nFirst, we expand \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) as follows:\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nWe then consider the constraint \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). By assuming symmetry, we set \\(x = z\\). This simplifies the constraint to:\n\\[\nx^2 y (2x + y) = 1\n\\]\n\nWe denote \\(y = kx\\), where \\(k > 0\\). Substituting \\(y = kx\\) into the constraint, we get:\n\\[\nx^2"
