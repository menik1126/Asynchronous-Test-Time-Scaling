Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should note that the problem involves three variables, which can sometimes make things a bit tricky. But since the equation involves their product and sum, maybe I can use some inequality techniques, like the AM-GM inequality. I know that AM-GM is often useful for optimization problems under certain constraints.\n\nThe expression I need to minimize is (x + y)(y + z). If I expand this, it becomes y(x + y + z) + xz. That might be helpful, but I'm not sure yet. Let me write that down:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz\n\nWait, and from the given condition, xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Let me denote S = x + y + z. So the condition is xyzS = 1. Maybe I can express (x + y)(y + z) in terms of y and S.\n\nFrom the expansion, (x + y)(y + z) = yS + xz. Hmm. But I still have two terms here: yS and xz. I wonder if I can relate these terms using AM-GM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can make a substitution to reduce the number of variables. Let's consider setting some variables equal to each other since the problem is symmetric in a way. Wait, but it's not completely symmetric because (x + y)(y + z) is not symmetric with respect to x and z, but y is in both. Hmm, so maybe it's better to let x = z? Let me assume that x = z to see if that gives me a minimum.\n\nIf x = z, then the condition becomes x * y * z * (x + y + z) = x * y * x * (2x + y) = x²y(2x + y) = 1.\n\nAnd the expression to minimize becomes (x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)², since x = z. So that would be (x + y)². Wait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Maybe I"

Alternatively, maybe use substitution variables.\n\nLet me think of variables in terms of two variables instead of three. Let me set a = x + y and b = y + z. Then the expression we need to minimize is ab. But then, since a = x + y and b = y + z, we can note that x + y + z = a + z, but z = b - y. Wait, that might complicate. Alternatively, let me see if I can express x + y + z in terms of a and b. Let's see:\n\nLet me denote a = x + y and b = y + z. Then, adding those two equations, a + b = x + 2y + z. Since the total sum S = x + y + z, then x + y + z = S = (a + b - y). Hmm, not sure. Maybe this isn't the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of each other. Let me think of variables x, y, z and perhaps set some substitution where s = x + y + z. Then the condition is xyzs = 1. We have to minimize (x + y)(y + z). Let me see if I can write (x + y)(y + z) in terms of s.\n\nEarlier, I saw that (x + y)(y + z) = y s + x z. Since the condition is xyz s =1. Hmm. Let me see if this can be approached with Lagrange multipliers? Since it's a constrained optimization problem. Maybe that's a way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution. Let me think. Let me denote variables in terms of two variables. Let me set variables as follows: let me suppose that u = x + y and v = y + z. Then the product is uv. The expression to minimize is uv. Then, let me see if I can express the condition in terms of u and v.\n\nFrom u = x + y and v = y + z, so that z = v - y, and x = u - y.

So the condition becomes (u - y) * y * (v - y) * (u + v - y) = 1.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't helping much, as the equation is still complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set t = y.
