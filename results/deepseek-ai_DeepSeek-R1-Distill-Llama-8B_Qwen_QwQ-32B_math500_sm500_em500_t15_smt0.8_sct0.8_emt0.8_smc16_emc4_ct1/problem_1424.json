This means that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Express \\( 2^{24} \\) in Prime Factorization:**\n   \\( 2^{24} \\) is already in its prime factorization form.\n\n3. **Condition for a Perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) Power:**\n   For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, \\( n \\) must divide the exponent in the prime factorization. Here, the exponent is **24**. Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of **24**.\n\n4. **Find All Divisors"
