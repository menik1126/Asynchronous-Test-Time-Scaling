Since 2 is already a prime number, the factorization is straightforward: \\( 2^{24} = 2^{24} \\).\n\nNext, for \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\). This means that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nNow, I'll list all the positive divisors of 24. These include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that \\( n > 1 \\), so I'll exclude 1 from the list. This leaves us with the divisors 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nCounting these, there are 7 possible positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) that satisfy the given condition.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the expression \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - A number \\( A \\) is said to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( A = k^n \\).\n   - Here, \\( A = 2^{24} \\). We need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\).\n\n2. **Express \\( 2^{24} \\) in Its Prime Factorization:**\n   - The prime factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\) is simply \\( 2^{24} \\) because 2 is a prime number.\n\n3. **Determine the Possible Values of \\( n \\):**\n   - For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the"
