Then, express this distance in the form \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) is square-free. Finally, find \\( a + b \\). Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) is given by the distance formula: \\( d = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} \\), which simplifies to \\( d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nSince \\( y \\) is given in terms of \\( x \\), I can substitute that into the distance formula. So, plugging \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\) into the distance formula:\n\n\\( d = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\)\n\nLet me compute that squared term first. Squaring \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\) gives \\( \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\). So, the distance squared (which is easier to work with) is:\n\n\\( d^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\)\n\nI think to minimize the distance, I can instead minimize \\( d^2 \\) because the square root is a monotonically increasing function. That should make the calculations easier.\n\nSo, let me set \\( f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\). I need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes \\( f(x) \\).\n\nTo find the minimum, I should take the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\), set it equal to zero, and solve for \\( x \\). That will give me the critical points, which I can then test to find the minimum.\n\nLet's"
