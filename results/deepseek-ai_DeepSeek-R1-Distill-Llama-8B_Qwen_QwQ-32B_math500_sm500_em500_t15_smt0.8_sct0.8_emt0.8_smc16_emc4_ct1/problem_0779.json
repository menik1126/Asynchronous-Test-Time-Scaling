Then, express this distance as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, with \\( a \\) not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Finally, I need to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. The distance from a point to the origin in a coordinate plane is given by the distance formula: \\( \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nSo, I can write the distance \\( D \\) from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) on the graph as:\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\)\n\nBut since \\( y \\) is given in terms of \\( x \\), I can substitute that into the equation. Let's do that:\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\)\n\nWait, let me square both sides to make it easier to work with, because the square of the distance will be easier to handle:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\)\n\nOkay, now let's compute that squared term:\n\nFirst, \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\). So the expression becomes:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\)\n\nLet me expand \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 \\):\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \\)\n\nSo plugging that back in:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \\)\n\nNow,"

Let's try that substitution:\n\nLet \\( z = x^2 \\). Then \\( D^2 = \\frac{1}{2}z^2 - 2z + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nSo now, \\( D^2 \\) is a quadratic in \\( z \\):\n\n\\( D^2 = \\frac{1}{2}z^2 - 2z + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nTo find the minimum distance, I need to find the minimum value of \\( D^2 \\), because the square root function is monotonically increasing. So, I can minimize \\( D^2 \\) instead.\n\nSo, let's consider the function:\n\n\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}z^2 - 2z + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nThis is a quadratic function in \\( z \\), opening upwards because the coefficient of \\( z^2 \\) is positive. Therefore, the minimum occurs at the vertex of the parabola.\n\nRecall that the vertex of a quadratic \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) is at \\( z = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\nHere, \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\), \\( b = -2 \\). So:\n\n\\( z = -\\frac{-2}{2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\)\n\nSo the minimum occurs at \\( z = 2 \\).

So, now, the critical points are at x=0, x= sqrt(2), x= -sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the minimum occurs at x= sqrt(2) and x= -sqrt(2), giving D^2=5/2, as we had earlier.
