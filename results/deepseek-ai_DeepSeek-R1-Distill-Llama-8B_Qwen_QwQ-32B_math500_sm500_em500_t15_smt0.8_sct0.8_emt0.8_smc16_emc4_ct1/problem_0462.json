And I need to find the minimum value of (x + y)(y + z). Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but I think I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I should write down the given condition: xyz(x + y + z) = 1. That might be useful later. Now, the expression I need to minimize is (x + y)(y + z). Let me expand that to see if it simplifies or if I can apply some inequality.\n\nExpanding (x + y)(y + z), I get:\n= xy + y² + yz + xz.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem immediately helpful. Maybe there's another approach. I remember that inequalities like AM-GM often come in handy for optimization problems with products and sums. Let me recall the AM-GM inequality: for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\n\nI wonder if I can express (x + y)(y + z) in terms that allow me to apply AM-GM. Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution to reduce the number of variables or make the expression symmetric in some way.\n\nLet me consider substituting variables or setting some variables equal for symmetry. Since the problem is symmetric in x and z, perhaps setting x = z could simplify things. Let me try that.\n\nLet’s assume x = z, so now variables are x, y, x. Then, our condition becomes:\nx * y * x * (x + y + x) = 1.\nSimplify that: x²y(2x + y) = 1.\n\nAnd the expression we need to minimize becomes:\n(x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)².\n\nWait, that’s interesting. If x = z, then (x + y)(y + z) becomes (x + y)². So maybe that reduces the problem to a single variable, which could be easier to handle.\n\nSo, let me denote t = y/x. Since x and y are positive, t is also positive. Then, y = t x.\n\nPlugging that into our condition:\n\nx² * (t x) * (2x + t x) = 1\n\nS"

So altogether:\n\nt x³ * x(2 + t) = t x^4 (2 + t) = 1.\n\nSo, t(2 + t) x^4 = 1. Therefore, x^4 = 1 / [t(2 + t)], so x = [1 / (t(2 + t))]^{1/4}.\n\nNow, the expression to minimize is (x + y)^2. Since y = t x, that becomes (x + t x)^2 = x²(1 + t)^2.\n\nSubstituting x from above:\n\nx² = [1 / (t(2 + t))]^{1/2}\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n[1 / (t(2 + t))]^{1/2} * (1 + t)^2\n\nSo, the expression to minimize is (1 + t)^2 / sqrt(t(2 + t)).\n\nHmm, so now the problem reduces to a single variable optimization problem in terms of t. Let me denote f(t) = (1 + t)^2 / sqrt(t(2 + t)). I need to find the minimum of f(t) for t > 0.\n\nTo find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(t) with respect to t and set it to zero. Let me compute f'(t).\n\nFirst, let me write f(t) as (1 + t)^2 [t(2 + t)]^{-1/2}\n\nLet me use logarithmic differentiation to make it easier. Let’s take the natural logarithm of f(t):\n\nln f(t) = 2 ln(1 + t) - (1/2) ln(t(2 + t))\n\nDifferentiate both sides with respect to t:\n\nf'(t)/f(t) = 2/(1 + t) - (1/2)[ (1/(t(2 + t))) * ( (2 + t) + t*2 ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute the derivative of ln(t(2 + t)) first.

Then, g’(t) = 2 + 2t.\n\nSo, the derivative of ln g(t) is (g’(t)/g(t)) = (2 + 2t)/(2t + t²).\n\nTherefore, back to f'(t)/f(t):\n\n= 2/(1 + t) - (1/2)*( (2 + 2t)/(2t + t²) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 2/(1 + t) - (1 + t)/(2t + t²)\n\nNow, set f'(t) = 0, so:\n\n2/(1 + t) - (1 + t)/(2t + t²) = 0\n\nSo, 2/(1 + t) = (1 + t)/(2t + t²)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n2(2t + t²) = (1 + t)^2\n\nExpand both sides:\n\n4t + 2t² = 1 + 2t + t²\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n4t + 2t² - 1 - 2t - t² = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2t² - t²) + (4t - 2t) - 1 = 0\nt² + 2t - 1 = 0\n\nQuadratic equation: t² + 2t - 1 = 0\n\nSolutions:\n\nt = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 4)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(8)] / 2 = [-2 ± 2*sqrt(2)] / 2 = -1 ± sqrt(2)\n\nSince t is positive, we take the positive solution: t = -1 + sqrt(2). Wait, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so -1 + 1.414 ≈ 0.414, which is positive. So t = sqrt(2) - 1.\n\nSo, we found that at t = sqrt(2) - 1, f(t) has a critical point. We need to check if this is a minimum.\n\nLet me compute the second derivative or test the behavior around this point, but maybe it's easier to compute f(t) at this point and see if it's indeed a minimum.\n\nCompute f(t) at t = sqrt(2"

Let’s consider the behavior of f(t):\n\nAs t approaches 0+, t(2 + t) approaches 0, so f(t) = (1 + t)^2 / sqrt(t(2 + t)) ≈ 1 / sqrt(t*2) → infinity.\n\nAs t approaches infinity, the numerator behaves like t², denominator behaves like sqrt(t^2) = t, so f(t) ≈ t² / t = t → infinity.\n\nTherefore, since f(t) approaches infinity as t approaches 0 and infinity, and we have only one critical point, this must be the global minimum.\n\nSo, the minimal value of (x + y)(y + z) when x = z is 2.\n\nBut wait, before concluding, I need to make sure that assuming x = z was valid. Because the problem is symmetric in x and z, so the minimum should occur when x = z, so my approach is correct.\n\nThus, the minimal value is 2.\n\nBut hold on, let me check without setting x = z to see if 2 is indeed the minimal value.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach using multiple variables.\n\nLet me denote S = x + y + z, then the given condition is xyz*S = 1.\n\nWe need to minimize (x + y)(y + z"
