Then, I need to compute the sum of each of these polynomials evaluated at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nFirst, I should look at the given polynomial: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). It looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Maybe I can treat \\( x^4 \\) as a single variable and rewrite the polynomial. Let me set \\( y = x^4 \\), so the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Hmm, that's a quadratic equation, which might be factorable.\n\nLet me try factoring \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Let's see... 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), that gives me \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nNow, looking at each of these factors, \\( x^4 + 4 \\) and \\( x^4 - 1 \\). I know that \\( x^4 - 1 \\) is a difference of squares, so it can be factored as \\( (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\). But \\( x^2 - 1 \\) can be further factored into \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\). So, putting it all together, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1) \\).\n\nSo now, the original polynomial factors into \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1) \\). I should check if each of these factors can be factored further over the integers.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm, that looks like a sum of squares"

Let me try to factor it into two quadratics: \\( (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) \\).\n\nMultiplying them out, we get \\( x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd \\). Comparing coefficients with \\( x^4 + 4 \\), we have:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\( x^3 \\) is \\( a + c \\). Since the original polynomial has no \\( x^3 \\) term, \\( a + c = 0 \\).\n2. The coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is \\( ac + b + d \\). Again, the original has no \\( x^2 \\) term, so \\( ac + b + d = 0 \\).\n3. The coefficient of \\( x \\) is \\( ad + bc \\). The original has no \\( x \\) term, so \\( ad + bc = 0 \\).\n4. The constant term is \\( bd = 4 \\).\n\nFrom equation (1): \\( c = -a \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( c = -a \\) into equation (3): \\( a*d + b*(-a) = 0 \\) => \\( a(d - b) = 0 \\).\n\nSo either \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( d = b \\).\n\nIf \\( a = 0 \\), then \\( c = 0 \\). Then equation (2) becomes \\( 0 + b + d = 0 \\) => \\( b + d = 0 \\). And equation (4): \\( b*d = 4 \\). So \\( b + d = 0 \\) and \\( b*d = 4 \\). Let me solve for b and d. Let me set \\( d = -b \\). Then \\( b*(-b) = 4 \\) => \\( -b^2 = 4 \\) => \\( b^2 = -4 \\). That's not possible with real numbers, so \\( a = 0 \\) case doesn't work.\n\nSo \\( d = b \\).

So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the original polynomial evaluated at x=1, and see if the sum of the products of the factors at 1 equals the original polynomial at 1?\n\nWait, the original polynomial at x=1 is 1 +3 -4 =0. The product of all the factors at x=1 should be 0, which is indeed the case because one of the factors is (x-1), which evaluates to 0. So that's consistent.\n\nBut the question is not asking for the product, but the sum of each factor evaluated at 1. So the sum is 10. Hmm, seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of another way to compute the sum without factoring?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a trick here. Let me think. The problem is asking for the sum of p_i(1). Since the original polynomial is the product of the p_i(x), then if we evaluate the product at x=1, we get the product of p_i(1). But the problem wants the sum, not the product. So that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe generating functions? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be related to coefficients? Hmm, not sure. But since the factorization is straightforward, and the steps check out, I think 10 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again step by step.\n\nFirst, the factors:\n\n1. \\( x^2 + 2x +2 \\) at 1: 1 +2 +2 =5.
