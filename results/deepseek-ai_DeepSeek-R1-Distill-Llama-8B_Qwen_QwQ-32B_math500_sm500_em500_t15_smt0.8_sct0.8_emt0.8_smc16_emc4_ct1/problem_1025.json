Then, once I have that factorization, I need to evaluate each polynomial at \\( x = 1 \\) and sum those values up. \n\nOkay, let me start by writing down the polynomial: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Hmm, it looks like a quartic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Maybe I can make a substitution to make it look simpler. Let me set \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\). Wait, that's a quadratic equation in \\( y \\). Maybe I can solve for \\( y \\) here?\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: \\( y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2} \\). So, \\( y = 1 \\) or \\( y = -4 \\). But \\( y = x^4 \\), which is always non-negative, so \\( y = -4 \\) isn't possible. So, the only valid solution is \\( y = 1 \\), which gives \\( x^4 = 1 \\).\n\nWait, but that means \\( x^4 - 1 = 0 \\), which factors further into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). But hold on, our original polynomial was \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Is there a connection here? Maybe I can think of \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) as \\( (x^4)^2 + 3x^4 - 4 \\), which is similar to \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Since I know that factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\), maybe I can use this to factor the original polynomial.\n\nSo, substituting back, we have \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). We already saw that \\( x^4 - 1 \\) factors as \\( (x - 1)("

Wait, \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be written as \\( x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2 \\), which is \\( (x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2 \\). That's a difference of squares, so it factors into \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\). Let me check that:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 4 \\). Wait, let me multiply it step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply \\( x^2 \\times x^2 = x^4 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times (-2x) = -2x^3 \\),\n\\( x^2 \\times 2 = 2x^2 \\),\nThen, 2x times x^2 = 2x^3,\n2x times -2x = -4x^2,\n2x times 2 = 4x,\nThen 2 times x^2 = 2x^2,\n2 times -2x = -4x,\n2 times 2 = 4.\n\nAdding all terms together:\n\nx^4 + (-2x^3 + 2x^3) + (2x^2 -4x^2 + 2x^2) + (4x -4x) + 4.\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n-2x^3 + 2x^3 cancels out to 0.\n\n2x^2 -4x^2 + 2x^2 = 0.\n\n4x -4x cancels out to 0.\n\nSo, the result is x^4 + 0 + 0 + 0 +4 = x^4 +4. Perfect! So that factorization works.\n\nTherefore, \\( x^4 +4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2"

So putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\( (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1) \\).\n\nWait, but hold on, let me confirm this. Let me multiply all these together step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 -2x +2) \\) = x^4 +4, as we saw.\n\nThen, \\( x^4 -1 = (x^2)^2 -1^2 = (x^2 -1)(x^2 +1) \\), and \\( x^2 -1 = (x -1)(x +1) \\). So that's correct.\n\nSo, altogether, the factorization is correct: \\( x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^2 + 2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1) \\).\n\nNow, the problem states that each non-constant polynomial is monic with integer coefficients and cannot be factored further over the integers. Let me check each of these factors:\n\n1. \\( x + 1 \\): linear, monic, irreducible.\n2. \\( x -1 \\): same, linear, irreducible.\n3. \\( x^2 +1 \\): quadratic, monic, irreducible over integers because it has no real roots.\n4. \\( x^2 +2x +2 \\): discriminant \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), so no real roots, irreducible over integers.\n5. \\( x^2 -2x +2 \\): discriminant \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), also irreducible.\n\nSo, all factors are monic, irreducible over integers, and with integer coefficients. Great.\n\nNow, we need to compute \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) \\). So, first, let's identify all the polynomials \\( p_i(x) \\):\n\n1. \\( p_1(x) = x -1 \\)\n2. \\( p_2(x) = x"

Let me recount:\n\nThe original polynomial is degree 8, and the factors have degrees: 2, 2, 1,1,2, which adds up to 8. Each factor is monic, irreducible. So, indeed, we have five factors.\n\nTherefore, adding up their evaluations at 1 gives 10. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's an alternative factorization. Sometimes, a quadratic might factor differently, but in this case, both quadr"

The linear factors are straightforward.\n\nAn alternative approach could be to factor \\( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\) by noticing it's similar to a quadratic in \\( x^4 \\), but I think we already took the correct substitution path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to factor it as a product of two quadratics times two linear terms? Wait, but that's what we did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe as four quadratics? Let me think: Suppose \\( x^8 + 3x^4 -4 = (x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)(x^4 + ex^3 + fx^2 + gx + h) \\). But since all coefficients are integers and both quartic polynomials would have to multiply to give x^8 +3x^4 -4, which has only x^8, x^4, and constant terms. So, the coefficients of x^7, x^6, x^5, x^3, x^2, x, would all have to be zero. Therefore:\n\nLet me assume that the two quartic polynomials are monic. Then:\n\n( x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d ) (x^4 + e x^3 + f x^2 + g x + h ) = x^8 + (a + e)x^7 + (ae + b + f)x^6 + (af + be + c + g)x^5 + (ag + bf + ce + d + h)x^4 + ... and so on.\n\nBut since the result is x^8 +0x^7 +0x^6 +0x^5 +3x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x -4. So, to have all coefficients except x^8, x^4, and constant term zero.\n\nTherefore, setting up equations:\n\n- Coefficient of x^7: a + e = 0 => e = -a\n\n- Coefficient of x^6: a e + b + f = 0.

Maybe this approach is not the best. Since we already have a factorization, perhaps this is redundant. But just to check, maybe the quartic factors into two quadratics?\n\nWait, but we already factored the quartic \\( x^4 +4 \\) into two quadratics, so that's covered. The other quartic \\( x^4 -1 \\) factors into two quadratics as well, but those further factor into linear terms. So, the factorization we have is the complete factorization into irreducibles over integers.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 10.
