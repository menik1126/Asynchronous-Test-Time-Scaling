            "output": "I need to determine the number of y-intercepts for the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\).\n\nFirst, I recall that the y-intercepts occur where the graph crosses the y-axis, which happens when \\( x = 0 \\). Therefore, I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation gives:\n\\[ 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). To find the number of real solutions, I'll calculate the discriminant using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac \\]\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\[ (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (\\( 20 > 0 \\)), there are two distinct real roots. This means the parabola crosses the y-axis at two different points.\n\nTherefore, the graph of the parabola \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand What a Y-Intercept Is\nA \\( y \\)-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the \\( y \\)-axis. At this point, the value of \\( x \\) is **0**. So, to find the \\( y \\)-intercepts, set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the Equation\nSubstitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Quadratic Equation\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), where:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -4 \\)\n- \\( c = -"
