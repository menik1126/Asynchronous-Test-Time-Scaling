Given that the radius of the sphere is 3 inches, I can substitute this value into the formula.\n\nNext, I'll identify the side length of the cube. Since the sphere is formed by removing metal from the corners of a cube, the sphere's diameter, which is twice the radius (6 inches), will be equal to the space diagonal of the cube. Using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions, the space diagonal (d) of a cube with side length (s) is given by d = s√3. By setting d equal to 6 inches, I can solve for s.\n\nAfter finding the side length of the cube, I'll calculate its volume using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is s³.\n\nFinally, I'll subtract the volume of the sphere from the volume of the cube to determine how much metal was removed, but since the question only asks for the volume of the cube, I'll present that as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube**\n\nWe have a steel sphere with a radius of 3 inches. This sphere is formed by removing material from the corners of a cube. To find the volume of the original cube, we need to determine its side length.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Sphere's Diameter to the Cube's Space Diagonal**\n\nThe diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so:\n\n\\[ \\text{Diameter} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nWhen material is removed from the corners of a cube to form a sphere, the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's space diagonal.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Space Diagonal Formula for a Cube**\n\nThe space diagonal (\\(d\\)) of a cube with side length (\\(s\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ d = s\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nSet the space diagonal equal to the sphere's diameter:\n\n\\[ s\\sqrt{3} = 6 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the Cube's Side Length**\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3"

Let me recheck that calculation. \n\nActually, expanding \\((2\\sqrt{3})^3\\):\n\n\\[ (2\\sqrt{3})^3 = 2^3 \\times (\\sqrt{3})^3 = 8 \\times (3\\sqrt{3}) = 24\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nHmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Let me verify if there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, since \\(s = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3}\\), then:\n\n\\[ s^3 = (2\\sqrt{3})^3 = 8 \\times (3)^{3/2} \\]\n\nBut \\(3^{3/2} = 3 \\times \\sqrt{3}\\), so:\n\n\\[ s^3 = 8 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{3} = 24\\sqrt{3} \\]\n\nYes, that's correct. However, maybe there's a mistake in the approach?\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made an error in interpreting the problem. The question states that the cube has the \"shortest possible side lengths\". Does this mean that the sphere must fit perfectly inside the cube, touching all faces? Or is there another constraint?\n\nWait, actually, if the sphere is formed by removing metal from the corners of the cube, the sphere must be inscribed within the cube. In that case, the sphere's diameter would equal the cube's edge length. But that contradicts the previous step.\n\nHold on, this is a critical point. Let me clarify:\n\n- If the sphere is inscribed in the cube (touching all faces),"
