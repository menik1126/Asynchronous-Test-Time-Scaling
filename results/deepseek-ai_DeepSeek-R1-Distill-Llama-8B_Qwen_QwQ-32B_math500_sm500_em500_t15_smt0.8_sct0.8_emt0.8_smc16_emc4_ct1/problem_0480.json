The sphere has a 3-inch radius, so its volume is a starting point.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere: (4/3) * π * r³.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how removing metal from the corners of the cube affects the total volume. Since each corner of the cube is a right-angled corner, the metal removed from each corner forms a small octant of a sphere.\n\nThe length of the side of the cube is related to the radius of the sphere. If the radius of the sphere is 3 inches, then the edge length of the cube (s) can be determined using the relationship s = r * √3.\n\nCalculating the edge length: s = 3 * √3 ≈ 5.196 inches.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the volume of the cube: s³ = (5.196)³ ≈ 137.5 cubic inches.\n\nSince each corner contributes a small octant, and there are 8 corners, the total volume removed from the cube is 8 * (1/8) * (4/3) * π * r³.\n\nPlugging in the values: Volume removed = 4/3 * π * r³ = (4/3) * π * 27 = 36π cubic inches.\n\nFinally, to find the remaining volume of the cube after removing the metal, I subtract the volume of the sphere from the cube's volume: 137.5 - 36π.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere was made by removing metal from its corners, let's follow a step-by-step approach.\n\n**Given:**\n- Radius of the steel sphere (\\( r \\)) = 3 inches\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere**\n\nThe volume of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the radius:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (27) = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Edge Length"
