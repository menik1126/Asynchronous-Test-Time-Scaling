            "output": "First, I recognize that the denominator can be factored into powers of 2 and 5, which are the prime factors of 10. This is crucial because the presence of 10 in the denominator ensures that the decimal will terminate.\n\nNext, I'll break down the denominator: 2 squared is 4, and 5 raised to the 7th power is 78125. Multiplying these together, I get 4 times 78125, which equals 312500.\n\nNow, I can rewrite the original fraction as 21 divided by 312500. To convert this into a decimal, I'll divide 21 by 312500.\n\nFinally, performing the division, 21 divided by 312500 equals 0.0000672.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) into a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   - Recognize that the denominator \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\) is composed of the prime factors 2 and 5. Since 10 is a factor of the denominator, the decimal will terminate.\n\n2. **Simplify the Denominator:**\n   - Calculate \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n   - Calculate \\(5^7 = 78125\\).\n   - Multiply them together: \\(4 \\times 78125 = 312500\\).\n\n3. **Rewrite the Fraction:**\n   - The fraction becomes \\(\\frac{21}{312500}\\).\n\n4. **Perform the Division:**\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator: \\(21 \\div 312500 = 0.0000672\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0000672}\n\\]"
