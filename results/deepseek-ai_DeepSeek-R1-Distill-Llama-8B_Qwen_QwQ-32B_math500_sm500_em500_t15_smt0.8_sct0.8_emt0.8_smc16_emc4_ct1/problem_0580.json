This simplifies the equation to \\(25 - 4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate the term with \\((5 - a)^2\\) by subtracting 25 from both sides, resulting in \\(-4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 38\\).\n\nThen, I'll multiply both sides by -3 to eliminate the negative sign and the division, leading to \\(4(5 - a)^2 = -114\\). However, since a square cannot be negative, this indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement or my calculations.\n\nAfter double-checking, I realize that the correct equation after subtracting 25 from both sides should be \\(-4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 38\\). To fix this, I'll multiply both sides by -3 to obtain \\(4(5 - a)^2 = -114\\). Recognizing that a square can't be negative, I'll conclude that there are no real solutions for \\(a\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the values of \\(a\\) that satisfy the equation is 0.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the values of \\( a \\) that satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[\n5^2 - 4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63\n\\]\n\nLet's follow the step-by-step solution.\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 5^2 \\):**\n\n\\[\n5^2 = 25\n\\]\n\n2. **Substitute back into the equation:**\n\n\\[\n25 - 4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63\n\\]\n\n3. **Isolate the term with \\( (5 - a)^2 \\):**\n\n\\[\n-4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63 - 25\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 38\n\\]\n\n4. **Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by \\(-3\\):**\n\n\\[\n4(5 - a)^2 = -114\n\\]\n\n5. **Recognize"
