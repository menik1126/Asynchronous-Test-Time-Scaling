Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials with integer coefficients, any rational root can be found using the Rational Root Theorem. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(p/q\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this equation, the leading coefficient is 1 (the coefficient of \\(x^4\\)) and the constant term is -14. So, possible values of \\(p\\) are the factors of -14, which are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, and \u00b114. Since \\(q\\) must be a factor of 1, the only possible rational roots are the integer factors of -14. That means the possible integer roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, and \u00b114.\n\nNow, I need to test each of these possible roots to see if they satisfy the equation. I can do this by plugging each value into the polynomial and checking if the result is zero.\n\nLet me start with \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0\\).\nWait, that adds up to 0. So, 1 is a root. That means \\((x - 1)\\) is a factor of the polynomial.\n\nNext, let me try \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14 = -8\\). That's not zero, so -1 is not a root.\n\nHow about \\(x = 2\\):\n\\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14 = 76\\). That's definitely not zero.\n\nTrying \\(x = -2\\):\n\\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3"

That means \\((x + 2)\\) is a factor as well.\n\nLet me check \\(x = 7\\) next:\n\\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14\\).\nCalculating each term:\n- \\(7^4 = 2401\\)\n- \\(5(7)^3 = 5(343) = 1715\\)\n- \\(9(7)^2 = 9(49) = 441\\)\n- Now, adding them up:\n2401 + 1715 = 4116; 4116 + 441 = 4557; 4557 - 7 = 4550; 4550 - 14 = 4536. That's way bigger than zero, so 7 is not a root.\n\nWhat about \\(x = -7\\):\n\\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) - 14\\).\nCalculating each term:\n- \\((-7)^4 = 2401\\)\n- \\(5(-7)^3 = 5(-343) = -1715\\)\n- \\(9(-7)^2 = 9(49) = 441\\)\n- Adding them up: 2401 - 1715 = 686; 686 + 441 = 1127; 1127 + 7 = 1134; 1134 - 14 = 1120. Not zero either.\n\nNow, let's try \\(x = 14\\):\nCalculating each term:\n- \\(14^4 = 14*14*14*14\\). Let me compute that step by step:\n  - \\(14^2 = 196\\)\n  - \\(14^3 = 196*14 = 2744\\)\n  - \\(14^4 = 2744*14 = 38416\\)\n- \\(5(14)^3 = 5*2744 = 13720\\)\n- \\(9(14)^2 = 9*196 = 1764\\)\n- \\(x = 14\\), so"

Wait, that's way too big, and when I subtract 14 and 14, it's still a huge number, nowhere near zero. So, 14 is definitely not a root.\n\nLastly, let me check \\(x = -14\\):\n\\((-14)^4 + 5(-14)^3 + 9(-14)^2 - (-14) - 14\\).\nCalculating each term:\n- \\((-14)^4 = 14^4 = 38416\\)\n- \\(5(-14)^3 = 5*(-2744) = -13720\\)\n- \\(9(-14)^2 = 9*196 = 1764\\)\n- The term for x is -(-14) = +14\n- The constant term is -14\nAdding these up:\n38416 - 13720 = 24696; 24696 + 1764 = 26460; 26460 +14 = 26474; 26474 -14 = 26460. Not zero, so -14 is not a root.\n\nWait, so from testing all the possible integer candidates, only \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\) satisfy the equation. So, these must be the integer roots.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nDouble-checking for \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14 = 0\\). Correct.\n\nDouble-checking for \\(x = -2\\):\n\\(16 - 40 + 36 + 2 -14 = (16 -40) + (36 + 2) -14 = (-24) + 38 -14 = 14 -14 = 0\\). Correct.\n\nSo yes, both 1 and -2 are integer roots.\n\nNow, since I've found two roots, maybe I can factor the polynomial using these and see if there are any other possible roots.\n\nIf 1 and -2 are roots, then \\((x - 1)(x + 2)\\) are factors. Let's perform polynomial division to factor out these terms.\n\nFirst, I'll divide the polynomial by \\((x - 1)\\).\n\n"

Let me see if this quadratic has any real roots, as that might affect whether there are more integer roots. The discriminant of \\(x^2 +4x +7\\) is \\(16 -28 = -12\\), which is negative. So, the quadratic doesn't have real roots, and therefore, no real roots. So, in terms of integer roots, we only have 1 and -2.\n\nHence, the integer roots are 1 and -2.\n</think>\n\nThe integer roots of the polynomial equation are found using the Rational Root Theorem and"
