I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help find possible rational roots, which includes integers since integers are a subset of rationals. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, p/q, of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients is such that p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, p can be factors of -14, and q can be factors of 1.\n\nWait, since q is 1, that means all possible rational roots are integers that divide -14. So the possible integer roots are the factors of -14. Let me list all the factors of -14. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, 14, and their negatives: -1, -2, -7, -14. So, the possible integer roots are: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.\n\nNow, I can test these possible roots by plugging them into the polynomial and seeing if the result is zero. Let me start with the smaller numbers first because they are easier to compute.\n\nLet's try x = 1: substituting, I get \\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14\\). Calculating that: 1 + 5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0. Oh, so x = 1 is a root! That's good. So (x - 1) is a factor.\n\nNow, since x = 1 is a root, we can factor the polynomial by dividing it by (x - 1). Maybe I can perform polynomial long division or synthetic division. Let me try synthetic division because it's usually faster.\n\nSetting up synthetic division with root 1:\n\nCoefficients of the polynomial: 1 ("

Add to next coefficient: 9 + 6 = 15.\n\nMultiply 15 by 1: 15. Add to next coefficient: -1 + 15 = 14.\n\nMultiply 14 by 1: 14. Add to constant term: -14 +14 = 0. Perfect, so the remainder is zero, as expected.\n\nSo after division, we have the polynomial: \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\). So the equation is now factored as (x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14) = 0.\n\nNow, I need to factor the cubic polynomial \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\). Let's apply the same approach again. Possible integer roots are factors of 14, so again 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.\n\nTesting x = -1: (-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 +15(-1) +14. That is -1 + 6 -15 +14. Let's compute: -1 +6 is 5, minus15 is -10, plus14 is 4. Not zero.\n\nTesting x = -2: (-2)^3 +6(-2)^2 +15(-2) +14. That's -8 + 24 -30 +14. Compute: -8 +24 is 16, 16-30 is -14, +14 is 0. So x = -2 is a root! Nice, so (x + 2) is a factor.\n\nNow, let's perform synthetic division again on the cubic polynomial with root -2.\n\nCoefficients: 1, 6, 15, 14.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2. Add to 6: 6 + (-2) = 4.\n\nMultiply 4 by -2: -8. Add to 15: 15"

Now, the original polynomial is factored as (x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7) =0.\n\nNow, let's look at the quadratic: \\(x^2 +4x +7\\). Are there any integer roots here? The discriminant is \\(b^2 -4ac = 16 -28 = -12\\), which is negative, so this quadratic doesn't have real roots, let alone integer roots. So the only integer roots are x =1 and x = -2.\n\nWait a minute, did I check all possible roots? Let me just make sure. The possible roots were 1, -1, 2, -2,7,-7,14,-14. I tested 1, -1, -2, and all others. The other roots, like 2, -7, 14, -14: let me check if maybe I missed any.\n\nWait, I should test x=2 in the original polynomial. Let me try x=2: \\(16 + 40 + 36 -2 -14\\). So 16+40=56, +36=92, -2=90, -14=76, which is not zero. So x=2 is not a root.\n\nWhat about x=7? Let me compute \\(7^4 +5*7^3 +9*7^2 -7 -14\\). 7^4 is 2401, 5*7^3=5*343=1715, 9*49=441, so 2401 + 1715 =4116, +441=4557, minus7=4550, minus14=4536. That's way too big, definitely not zero.\n\nSimilarly, for x=-7: compute each term: (-7)^4=2401, 5*(-7)^3=5*(-343)=-1715, 9*(-7)^2=9*49=441, -(-7)=7, -14. So total: 2401 -1715=686, +441=1127, +"

Similarly, x=-14 would be even bigger in magnitude.\n\nSo, looks like the only integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let's verify x=-2 in the original polynomial: \\((-2)^4 +5*(-2)^3 +9*(-2)^2 - (-2) -14\\). So 16 + 5*(-8) +9*4 +2 -14. Compute each term: 16, -40, 36, +2, -14. So 16-40=-24, +36=12, +2=14, -14=0.
