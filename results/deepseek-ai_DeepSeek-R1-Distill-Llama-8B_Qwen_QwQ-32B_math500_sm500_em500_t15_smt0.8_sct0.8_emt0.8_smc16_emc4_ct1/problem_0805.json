            "output": "Alright, so I have this polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients, and it's given that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. The roots are distinct integers. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, it must be a monic polynomial if we factor it, but here it's not monic because a_n is 2. So perhaps I can write it in factored form as 2*(x - r1)*(x - r2)*...*(x - rn), where each ri is an integer. Expanding this should give me the polynomial in standard form.\n\nGiven that a_0 is 66, which is the constant term, that should be equal to 2*(-1)^n*r1*r2*...*rn. Since a_0 is positive, and 2 is positive, the product of the roots times (-1)^n must be positive. So depending on whether n is even or odd, the product of roots will be positive or negative. But since 2 is positive and 66 is positive, then (-1)^n * (product of roots) must be positive. So, if n is even, the product of roots is positive, and if n is odd, the product of roots is negative. Okay, that's a point to remember.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficients, specifically a_{n-1}. From Vieta's formula, I know that the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to 2*(-1)^{n-1} times the sum of the products of the roots taken n-1 at a time. So, a_{n-1} = 2*(-1)^{n-1}*S, where S is the sum of products of roots taken n-1 at a time.\n\nBut we need to find the minimal |a_{n-1}|. So, we need to choose roots such that this sum S is minimized in absolute value. Since 2 is fixed, the magnitude of a_{n-1} will depend on |S|. So, the goal is to find such integer roots where the product of the roots is 66/(2*(-1)^n), but the sum S is as small as possible.\n\nWait, maybe I should think more directly about the product"

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the polynomial is 2*(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn), then expanding this, the coefficient a_{n-1} is 2*(- (r1 + r2 + ... + rn)). Wait, hold on, let me check that again.\n\nWait, Vieta's formula for a monic polynomial x^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + c0 would have the sum of roots as -c_{n-1}. But here, the leading coefficient is 2, so the polynomial is 2*(x - r1)...(x - rn). Let me expand this:\n\nLet me denote the monic polynomial as P(x) = (x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Then f(x) = 2*P(x). The coefficient of x^{n-1} in P(x) is - (r1 + r2 + ... + rn). Therefore, in f(x), the coefficient a_{n-1} would be 2*(- (sum of roots)). So, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. Wait, that seems important. So actually, the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, the absolute value is 2 times the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Therefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize |sum of roots|, since 2 is a constant factor.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding distinct integers r1, r2, ..., rn such that their product is 66/(2*(-1)^n), but since the product must be an integer, and 66 is divisible by 2, so 66/2 = 33. Therefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the constant term a0 is 66, which is equal to 2*(-1)^n*(r1*r2*...*rn). Therefore, rearranged, the product of the roots is (a0)/(2*(-1)^n) = 66/(2"

If n is odd, (-1)^n is negative, so product is -33. So, depending on the parity of n, the product is either 33 or -33.\n\nBut the product is 33 or -33, and we need to factor that into distinct integers. So, 33 factors into 1*3*11, but perhaps there's more factors if considering negatives.\n\nSo, let's factor 33: 33 = 1*3*11. So, the possible integer roots could be 1, 3, 11, and their negatives.\n\nBut the key is to have distinct integer roots. So, we can have both positive and negative roots, but they have to be distinct.\n\nAlso, note that the degree n can be any, as long as we have distinct roots. So, perhaps considering more roots with small absolute values could help in reducing the sum.\n\nWait, but the more roots we have, the more the sum of roots might get large, unless some roots are negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps having both positive and negative roots could cancel out the sum.\n\nSo, the idea is to choose roots such that their sum is as close to zero as possible, but the product is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd.\n\nSo, let's think about possible roots. 33 factors as 1*3*11. Alternatively, we can also have negative factors.\n\nLet me note that if n is even, the product of roots is 33; if n is odd, the product is -33.\n\nBut to minimize |sum of roots|, I need the roots to be as balanced as possible around zero, but their product must be 33 or -33.\n\nAlternatively, let's see possible factorizations of 33 into distinct integers.\n\nFactors of 33 are:\n\n1, 3, 11, 33.\n\nAnd their negatives: -1, -3, -11, -33.\n\nWe can also have more than three roots by including 1 and -1, but 1 and -1 would contribute a product of -1.\n\nWait, but wait, the product is 33 or -"
