            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}| for a polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients. The polynomial is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0\n\nI know that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. Also, the roots are distinct integers. Hmm, so I need to figure out such a polynomial with these conditions and minimize |a_{n-1}|.\n\nFirst, let's recall that if a polynomial has integer coefficients and its roots are integers, then by the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are factors of a_0 divided by a_n. Since a_n is 2, the possible roots are factors of 66/2, which is 33. The factors of 33 are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33.\n\nSo, the possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33. But the roots have to be distinct, so I can't have repeated roots. That means each root must be unique among these factors.\n\nNow, since a_n is 2 and the leading coefficient, the polynomial can be written as:\n\nf(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n)\n\nwhere each r_i is a distinct integer from the list ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33.\n\nGiven that a_0 is 66, which is the constant term. For a monic polynomial, a_0 would be (-1)^n times the product of the roots. But since ours isn't monic, it's 2 times that product.\n\nSo, the constant term a_0 = 2*(-1)^n*(r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 66.\n\nTherefore, (-1)^n*(r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 33.\n\nSo, the product of the roots times (-1)^n is 33. Therefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33 depending on whether n is even or odd.\n\nWait, actually, it's 33 if n is even because (-1)^n is 1, and -33 if n is odd because (-1)^n is"

Wait, perhaps I need to recall Vieta's formula correctly.\n\nVieta's formula says that the product of the roots, taking into account the leading coefficient, is equal to (-1)^n * a_0 / a_n. Wait yes: If the polynomial is f(x) = a_n (x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), then expanding it, the constant term is a_n*(-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n = a_0, so:\n\na_0 = a_n*(-1)^n*(r_1 r_2 ... r_n)\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\nproduct of roots (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = (-1)^n * (a_0 / a_n) = (-1)^n *66 / 2 = (-1)^n *33.\n\nSo, the product of the roots must be either 33 or -33. Since n is the degree of the polynomial, but since the roots have to be distinct integers, the number of roots n must be equal to the number of factors we choose, but each must be distinct.\n\nOur goal is to select distinct integers roots from the factors of 33 (so the possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33) such that their product is either 33 or -33, and then compute |a_{n-1}| which is the absolute value of the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the expanded polynomial.\n\nWe need to choose a set of roots such that their product (with the sign) is 33 or -33, and then find the minimal |sum of roots|, since the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to -a_n * (sum of roots). Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, Vieta's formula for the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the polynomial f(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0 is equal to -a_n*(sum of roots). Because expanding the factored form, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is -a_n*(r1 + r2 + ... + rn). So, indeed, a_{n-"

Therefore, |a_{n-1}| is 2*|sum of roots|.\n\nSo, in order to minimize |a_{n-1}|, I need to minimize |sum of roots|, because 2*|sum| is the value we need. So the minimal |sum of roots| is the key here.\n\nGiven that the product of roots is 33 or -33, and all roots are distinct integers from the set { -33, -11, -3, -1, 1, 3, 11, 33 }.\n\nSo, the strategy would be:\n\n1. Find all possible subsets of these roots that multiply to 33 or -33.\n\n2. For each such subset, compute the sum of the roots.\n\n3. Find the subset where the absolute value of the sum is minimized.\n\n4. The minimal |sum| multiplied by 2 will be the minimal |a_{n-1}|.\n\nSo, let's try to find all subsets of the roots that have a product of 33 or -33.\n\nFirst, let's note that 33 factors as 3*11, so it's a product of two primes. So, the possible ways to write 33 as a product of integers are:\n\n1. 1 * 33\n\n2. 3 * 11\n\nSimilarly, we can have negative numbers as roots, so the product can be -33 as well, so:\n\n1. (-1) * (-33)\n\n2. (-3) * (-11)\n\n3. (-1) * 3 * 11 (but that would be a product of three numbers)\n\nWait, actually, 33 has only a few factors, but considering that we can have products with both positive and negative numbers, it's possible to have different combinations.\n\nBut also, since 33 is 3*11, so with more roots, we can have more numbers, but since all roots need to multiply to 33 or -33, the number of roots in the subset must be such that their product is 33 or -33.\n\nSo, possible subsets:\n\nCase 1: Single root.\n\nEither 33 or -33.\n\nCase 2: Two roots.\n\nPossible pairs: (1,33), (-1,-33), (3"

Hmm, maybe more possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, it's better to think of all possible subsets (with at least two elements?) but the minimal sum might be achieved with smaller number of terms? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can list all possible subsets (of the possible roots) where their product is ±33, then calculate their sums. Since roots have to be distinct, each number can be used once.\n\nThe set of possible roots is {±1, ±3, ±11, ±33}, so eight possible roots. Let's consider all possible subsets (non-empty) of these with products ±33, and their sizes (number of roots) from 1 up to 8? Though size 8 would be the product of all roots, but that product would be (1*-1*3*-3*11*-11*33*-33) which is way larger than ±33, so probably irrelevant.\n\nBut let's see. So first, let's see all possible subsets:\n\nPossible single roots contributing to the product ±33:\n\n33 or -33. So the single roots that are exactly 33 or -33.
