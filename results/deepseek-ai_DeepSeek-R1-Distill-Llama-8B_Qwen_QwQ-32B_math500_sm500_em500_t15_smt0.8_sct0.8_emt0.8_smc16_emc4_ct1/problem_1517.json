Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, the number of possible combinations for the first letter is 26. For the second letter, there are 25 remaining choices, as it must be different from the first one.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of possible combinations for the two-digit number. The first digit of the number can be any of the 10 digits (0 through 9), and the second digit can be any of the remaining 9 digits, as it must differ from the first one.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I'll multiply the number of combinations for the letters by the number of combinations for the digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll analyze the construction of the plate step by step.\n\n1. **First Character (Letter):**\n   - There are **26** possible letters (A through Z).\n   - Since each license plate must have **2 different letters**, the first position has **26** choices.\n\n2. **Second Character (Letter):**\n   - After selecting the first letter, there are **25** remaining letters to choose from.\n   - Therefore, the second position has **25** choices.\n\n3. **Third Character (Digit):**\n   - There are **10** possible digits (0 through 9).\n   - Since the two digits must be **different**, the first digit has **10** choices.\n\n4. **Fourth Character (Digit):**\n   - After selecting the first digit, there are **9** remaining digits to choose from.\n   - Therefore, the second position has **9** choices.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of license plates} = (\\text{Number of first letters}) \\times (\\text{Number of second letters}) \\times (\\text{Number of first digits}) \\times (\\text{Number of second digits})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of license plates} = 26 \\times 25 \\times 10 \\times 9\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of license plates} = 26 \\times 25 \\times 90 = 26 \\times 2250 = 58,500\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{58,500}\n\\]"
