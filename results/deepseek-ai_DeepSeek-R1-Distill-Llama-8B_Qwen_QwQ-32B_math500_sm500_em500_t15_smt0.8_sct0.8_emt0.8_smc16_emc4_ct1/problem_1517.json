For the first letter, there are 26 possible choices. Once the first letter is chosen, there are 25 remaining letters to choose from for the second position.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of possible combinations for the numbers on the license plate. There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9), and each of the two number positions must also be different. For the first number, there are 10 possible choices, and for the second number, there are 9 remaining choices.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of possible license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations.\n\nSo, 26 letters multiplied by 25 letters gives 650 possible combinations for the letters. For the numbers, 10 digits multiplied by 9 digits gives 90 possible combinations for the numbers. Multiplying these together, 650 by 90 equals 58,500.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 58,500 possible license plates that can be formed under the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem into two parts: the letters and the numbers. Each part involves selecting different characters, so we'll use permutations for each.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the number of possible combinations for the letters\n- **First letter:** There are **26** letters in the English alphabet.\n- **Second letter:** After choosing the first letter, there are **25** remaining letters to choose from.\n\nSo, the number of combinations for the letters is:\n\\[\n26 \\times 25 = 650\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the number of possible combinations for the numbers\n- **First digit:** There are **10** possible digits (0-9).\n- **Second digit:** After choosing the first digit, there are **9** remaining digits to choose from.\n\nSo, the number of combinations for the numbers is:\n\\[\n10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total number of license plates\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations:\n\\[\n650 \\times 90 = 58,500\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of"
