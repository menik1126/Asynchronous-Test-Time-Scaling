The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots this polynomial could have. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. I think it's used to find all possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Yeah, that sounds right. So, maybe I should use that theorem here. Let me recall what the theorem states.\n\nFrom what I remember, the Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, where p and q are integers, must satisfy that p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. So, in this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. That should help narrow down the possible rational roots.\n\nAlright, so for our polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. So, applying the Rational Root Theorem, any possible rational root would be a fraction p/q, where p divides 1 and q divides 2. Okay, so let me list out all possible values of p and q.\n\nFirst, p divides 1. The divisors of 1 are just ±1. So, p can be either 1 or -1. Next, q divides 2, so the divisors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. Therefore, q can be 1, -1, 2, or -2. But in fractions, we usually consider the denominator q to be positive, right? So, maybe only 1 and 2 are considered for q. Wait, no, the theorem doesn't specify that q must be positive, but often when we list possible rational roots, we consider the positive denominators to avoid duplicate roots. But perhaps I should include all four possibilities to be thorough.\n\nSo, combining p and q, the possible values for p/q would be:\n\n- For p = 1 and q = 1: 1/1 = 1\n- For p = 1 and q = 2: 1/2\n- For p = -1 and q = 1: -1"

            "output": "/1 = -1\n- For p = -1 and q = 2: -1/2\n- Also, if q is negative, like q = -1, then p/q would be -1 (since 1/-1 = -1) and -1/-1 = 1, but those are already covered. Similarly, q = -2 would give 1/-2 = -1/2 and -1/-2 = 1/2, which are also duplicates. So, considering all possibilities, the distinct possible rational roots are ±1 and ±1/2.\n\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2. That gives four possible candidates. But the question says \"the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial.\" Wait, but does that mean all four are possible, or are there some restrictions because of the coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁?\n\nHmm, the problem states that the polynomial has integer coefficients, but the coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁ can be any integers. So, the question is asking for all possible rational roots that could exist for any such polynomial, given that the leading coefficient is 2 and the constant term is 1. So, the possible rational roots are exactly those given by the Rational Root Theorem, which are ±1 and ±1/2. Since the coefficients can be any integers, each of these roots could be achieved by some choice of coefficients. Therefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4?\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if all of these are actually possible. Let me think. For example, suppose the polynomial has a root of 1. Then plugging in x=1, we get 2(1)^4 + a₃(1)^3 + a₂(1)^2 + a₁(1) + 1 = 0. That simplifies to 2 + a₃ + a₂ + a₁ + 1 = 0, so a₃ + a₂ + a₁ = -3. Since a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, this equation is possible. For example, if a₃ = 0, a₂ = 0, then a₁ = -3. So, such coefficients exist. Therefore, 1 is a possible rational root.\n\nSimilarly, let's check"

            "output": " x = -1. Plugging in x=-1: 2(-1)^4 + a₃(-1)^3 + a₂(-1)^2 + a₁(-1) + 1 = 2(1) + a₃(-1) + a₂(1) + a₁(-1) + 1. That simplifies to 2 - a₃ + a₂ - a₁ + 1 = 0. So, -a₃ + a₂ - a₁ = -3. Again, can we find integers a₃, a₂, a₁ to satisfy this? Yes. For example, let a₃ = 0, a₂ = 0, then -0 + 0 - a₁ = -3, so a₁ = 3. So, with a₃=0, a₂=0, a₁=3, the polynomial has a root at x=-1. Therefore, x=-1 is a possible rational root.\n\nNow, let's check x = 1/2. Plugging in x=1/2 into the polynomial: 2*(1/2)^4 + a₃*(1/2)^3 + a₂*(1/2)^2 + a₁*(1/2) + 1 = 0. Let me compute each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 2/16 = 1/8,\na₃*(1/8),\na₂*(1/4),\na₁*(1/2),\nand the constant term is 1.\n\nSo, adding all these up: 1/8 + a₃/8 + a₂/4 + a₁/2 + 1 = 0. Let me multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ + 8 = 0\nSo, a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ = -9.\n\nCan we find integers a₃, a₂, a₁ such that a₃ + 2a₂ + 4a₁ = -9? Yes. For instance, let a₁ = 0, a₂ = 0, then a₃ = -9. So, the polynomial with a₃=-9, a₂=0, a₁=0 would be 2x⁴ -9x³ + 0x² + 0x +1."

Therefore, it's possible.\n\nSimilarly, let's check x=-1/2. Plugging in x=-1/2:\n\n2*(-1/2)^4 + a₃*(-1/2)^3 + a₂*(-1/2)^2 + a₁*(-1/2) + 1 = 0.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8,\na₃*(-1/8),\na₂*(1/4),\na₁*(-1/2),\nand the constant term 1.\n\nSo, adding them up: 1/8 - a₃/8 + a₂/4 - a₁/2 + 1 = 0.

Let me set a₂ = 1, then -a₃ + 2 = -9 => -a₃ = -11 => a₃ =11. So, a₃=11, a₂=1, a₁=0.

So, the number of different possible rational roots is four.\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of different possible rational roots, which could mean that even though there are four candidates, maybe some of them could coincide for certain coefficients. But in this case, each of the roots is distinct: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. So, each is unique.\n\nAlternatively, could the polynomial have multiple roots? But the question is about possible rational roots, so regardless of whether the polynomial is reducible or not, each candidate is possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the question is about the number of different possible rational roots, meaning that for this specific polynomial, regardless of a₃, a₂, a₁, what are the possible rational roots. So, in that case, it's indeed four.\n\nWait, but perhaps the answer is expecting something else. Let me make sure I'm applying the Rational Root Theorem correctly. The polynomial is monic? No, it's not monic because the leading coefficient is 2. So, the Rational Root Theorem applies as I did before.\n\nSo, for a general quartic polynomial with leading coefficient 2 and constant term 1, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±1/2.\n\nHence, four possible rational roots.\n\nSo, the answer is 4.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me consider if there could be any more possible rational roots. But since the constant term is 1, the possible numerators are only ±1, and denomin"
