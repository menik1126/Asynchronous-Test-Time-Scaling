The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the equation \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nThe problem states that the volume is \\( 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters. To find the height, I'll substitute the given volume into the formula and solve for \\( h \\).\n\nStarting with the equation:\n\\[ 45\\pi = \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nI can divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\pi \\) to simplify it:\n\\[ 45 = r^2 h \\]\n\nFrom the Asymptote code provided, the radius \\( r \\) of the cylinder is given as 3 centimeters. I'll substitute this value into the equation:\n\\[ 45 = 3^2 \\times h \\]\n\\[ 45 = 9h \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( h \\), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 9:\n\\[ h = \\frac{45}{9} \\]\n\\[ h = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo find the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, we'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume of the cylinder,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the cylinder,\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\n**Given:**\n- The volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n- The radius \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters.\n\n**Step 1:** Plug the known values into the formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 3^2 \\times h\n\\]\n\n\\[\n45 = 9 \\times h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe height of the cylinder is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) centimeters."
