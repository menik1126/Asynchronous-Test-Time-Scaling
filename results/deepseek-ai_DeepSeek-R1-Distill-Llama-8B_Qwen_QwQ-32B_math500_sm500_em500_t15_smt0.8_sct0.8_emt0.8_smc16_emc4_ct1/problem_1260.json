            "output": " digits correctly. Wait, this approach is incorrect because the initial assumption of the digits (1, 3, 3) is arbitrary. Let me correct this.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\nTo convert \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six, we divide the number by 6 repeatedly and record the remainders.\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6:**\n   \n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ remainder } 3\n   \\]\n   \n   The remainder is the least significant digit (rightmost digit).\n\n2. **Divide the quotient (166) by 6:**\n   \n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ remainder } 4\n   \\]\n   \n   The remainder is the next digit.\n\n3. **Divide the new quotient (27) by 6:**\n   \n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ remainder } 3\n   \\]\n   \n   The remainder is the next digit.\n\n4. **Divide the new quotient (4) by 6:**\n   \n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ remainder } 4\n   \\]\n   \n   The remainder is the most significant digit.\n\n5. **Arrange the remainders from last to first:**\n   \n   The remainders are 3, 4, 3, and 4. Thus, the base six number is \\( 4343_6 \\).\n\nWait, this contradicts the initial answer. Let me verify again.\n\n**Rechecking the division steps:**\n\n1. **First division:**\n   \n   \\( 999 \\div 6 = 166.5 \\), but integer division gives 166 with remainder \\( 999 - (166 \\times 6) = 999 - 996 = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Second division:**\n   \n   \\( 166 \\div 6 = 27.666... \\), so quotient 27, remainder \\( 166 - (27 \\times 6) = 166 - 162 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Third division:**\n   \n   \\( 27 \\"
