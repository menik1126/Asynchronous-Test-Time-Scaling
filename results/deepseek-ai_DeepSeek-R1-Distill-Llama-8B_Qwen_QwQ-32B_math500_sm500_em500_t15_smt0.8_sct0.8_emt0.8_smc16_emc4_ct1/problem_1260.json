I'll begin with the highest power of six that's less than or equal to $999_{10}$.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the coefficients for each power of six by dividing $999_{10}$ by the respective powers of six and keeping track of the remainders.\n\nFinally, I'll assemble the coefficients in the correct order to form the base six number, ensuring that each digit is less than six.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of \\( 999_{10} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Base Conversion:**\n   - Base six (\\( \\base 6 \\)) uses digits from 0 to 5.\n   - To convert a decimal number (\\( 999_{10} \\)) to base six, we'll divide the number by powers of six and determine the coefficients for each power.\n\n2. **Determine the Powers of Six:**\n   Calculate the highest power of six that's less than or equal to \\( 999_{10} \\):\n   \\[\n   6^0 = 1 \\\\\n   6^1 = 6 \\\\\n   6^2 = 36 \\\\\n   6^3 = 216 \\\\\n   6^4 = 1296\n   \\]\n   - The highest power is \\( 6^4 = 1296 \\), but since \\( 1296 > 999 \\), the highest usable power is \\( 6^3 = 216 \\).\n\n3. **Find the Coefficients:**\n   - **For \\( 6^3 \\) (216):**\n     \\[\n     999 \\div 216 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 999 - 4 \\times 216 = 999 - 864 = 135\n     \\]\n     So, the coefficient for \\( 6^3 \\) is **4**.\n   \n   - **For \\( 6^2 \\) (36):**\n     \\[\n     135 \\div 36 = 3 \\text{ with a remainder of } 135 - 3 \\times 36 = 135 - 108 = 27\n     \\"
