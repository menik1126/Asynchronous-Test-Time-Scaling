It has 10 complex roots, and they're paired as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The question is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the magnitudes squared of each pair, that is: \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is the square of its magnitude. So, each term in the sum is essentially \\(1/|r_i|^2\\).\n\nNow, since all the roots come in conjugate pairs, each \\(r_i\\) and its conjugate \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) will contribute the same amount to the sum. That is, \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{\\overline{r}_1 r_1}\\) is just twice \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1}\\). But wait, hold on—actually, in the problem, the roots are already given as \\(r\\) and \\(\\overline{r}\\) separately, so each pair contributes once. So in total, the sum is over five terms, each being the reciprocal of the magnitude squared of a distinct root.\n\nHmm, okay, maybe I need to think about this differently. Perhaps I can consider the polynomial equation and relate the sum of reciprocals of \\(|r_i|^2\\) to the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nLet me recall that for a polynomial \\(P(x) = a_{10}x^{10} + a_9x^9 + \\dots + a_0\\), the sum of the roots is \\(-a_9/a_{10}\\), the sum of the product of roots two at a time is \\(a_8/a_{10"

So, there are 10 such roots, but we have 5 conjugate pairs because roots come in pairs.\n\nBut wait, when considering \\(\\omega\\) as a 10th root of -1, each \\(\\omega\\) is unique, but they come in conjugate pairs. So, for each \\(\\omega\\), its conjugate is also a root of -1.

To compute that, perhaps I can consider all the roots \\(r_j = 1/(13 - \\omega_j)\\), where \\(\\omega_j^{10} = -1\\), so each \\(\\omega_j\\) is a distinct 10th root of -1. Since there are 10 roots, each contributes a term \\( |13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\), but since they come in conjugate pairs, each pair contributes twice the real part or something?\n\nWait, but actually, the sum \\( \\sum_{j=1}^{10} |1/(13 - \\omega_j)|^{-2} = \\sum_{j=1}^{10} |13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\). But since the roots come in conjugate pairs, the terms for \\( \\omega_j \\) and \\( \\overline{\\omega_j} \\) would be the same because \\( |13 - \\omega|^2 = |13 - \\overline{\\omega}|^2 \\).

Also, \\( \\pi/20 \\) is 9 degrees, so \\( \\sin(9^\\circ) \\) is positive. Therefore, the substitution is correct: \\( \\cos(9\\pi/20) = \\sin(\\pi/20) \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum is \\( -1 \\). Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because the sum of cosines for equally spaced angles around the circle. Wait, the 10 angles are spaced at \\( \\pi/10 \\) radians apart, starting from \\( \\pi/10 \\), so spread out over the upper half of the unit circle.\n\nWait, but each term \\( \\cos(\\theta) \\) is positive when \\( \\theta \\) is in the first and fourth quadrants. Here, all angles \\( (2k+1)\\pi/10 \\) are in the first and second quadrants because \\( 2k+1 \\) is odd, but only up to 9, so \\( (2*4 +1)\\pi/10 = 9\\pi/10 \\), just below \\( \\pi \\). So, the angles go from \\( \\pi/10 \\) to \\( 9\\pi/10 \\), which are in the first and second quadrants. Therefore, the cosines are positive in the first quadrant and negative in the second quadrant. So, there are 5 positive terms and 5 negative terms. Hence, the total sum is the sum of 5 positive and 5 negative terms, each pair adding to something less than zero.

Wait, no, actually, each term \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |r_j|^{-2} = |13 - \\omega_j|^2\\). But each root \\(r_j\\) corresponds to a unique \\(\\omega_j\\), so the total sum over all 10 roots would be the sum over all \\( |13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\). But since each pair \\( \\omega_j \\) and \\( \\overline{\\omega_j} \\) gives the same value, so the total sum over all 10 roots is equal to twice the sum over the five distinct terms. Therefore, the required sum \\( S \\) is exactly half of the total sum over all roots. Therefore, since the total sum over all roots is 1726, then \\( S = 1726 / 2 = 863 \\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again:\n\nEach pair \\( r_j, \\overline{r_j} \\) corresponds to two roots, but each contributes the same term \\( |13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\). Therefore, the total over all roots is the sum over all 10 roots, which is the same as 2 times the sum over the five distinct terms. Therefore, the required sum is indeed 1726 divided by 2, which is 863. So the answer is 8"

Start with equation \\( x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0 \\).\n2. Rearranged to \\( x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10} \\).\n3. Take the 10th root: \\( x = \\omega (-(13x -1)) \\), where \\( \\omega^{10} = -1 \\).\n4. Therefore, \\( x = \\frac{1}{13 - \\omega} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a 10th root of -1.\n5. Each root \\( r_j = 1/(13 - \\omega_j) \\), where \\( \\omega_j^{10} = -1 \\).\n6. The required sum is \\( \\sum_{j=1}^{5} |13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\) because \\( 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\).\n7. However, the total sum over all 10 roots would be \\( 2 \\times \\) the required sum, so 2S = 1726 → S = 863.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my confusion is in whether the required sum is over the five terms or ten terms, but according to the problem, we have 10 roots grouped into 5 conjugate pairs, each contributing one term to the sum.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as 10 roots: \\( r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5 \\). Then, the sum is over 10 terms, each being \\( 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) \\). So wait, now I'm getting confused because each term is \\( 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) \\), which is equal to \\( |r_j|^{-2} \\).\n\nBut since \\( r_j \\) and \\( \\overline{r_j} \\) are roots, so \\( r_j \\) satisfies the equation, and so does \\( \\overline{r_j} \\). So, each reciprocal term is the same for \\("

But the problem is asking for the sum over the five terms, so the answer is \\( S = \\sum_{j=1}^5 |r_j|^{-2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sum_{all roots} |r_j|^{-2} \\).\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I considered that \\( \\sum_{all roots} |r_j|^{-2} = \\sum_{all roots} |13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\). Wait, no, actually \\( |r_j|^2 = 1/|13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\), so \\( |r_j|^{-2} = |13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\). Therefore, the total sum over all roots is \\( \\sum_{j=1}^{10} |13 - \\omega_j|^2 = 1726 \\), so the required sum is half of that, which is 863. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the sum another way. Let me think of the polynomial whose roots are \\( \\omega_j \\), which are the 10th roots of -1. The polynomial is \\( \\omega^{10} + 1 = 0 \\). So, the roots are the solutions to \\( \\omega^{10} = -1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum \\( \\sum_{j=1}^{10} |13 - \\omega_j|^2 \\) can be written as \\( \\sum_{j=1}^{10} (13 - \\omega_j)(13 - \\overline{\\omega_j}) \\).\n\nExpanding this sum:\n\n\\( \\sum_{j=1}^{10} [169 -13(\\omega_j + \\overline{\\omega_j}) + |\\omega_j|^2] \\).\n\nSince \\( |\\omega_j|^2 = 1 \\), because they are on the unit circle, so this becomes:\n\n\\( \\sum_{j=1}^{10} [169 -13(\\omega_j + \\overline{\\omega_j}) + "

But let me think once more: the key was recognizing the reciprocal relationship, expressing roots in terms of the 10th roots of -1, realizing that \\( |13 - \\omega|^2 \\) can be summed over all roots, and then using trigonometric identities to compute the cosine sum.\n\nI think I'm confident with that reasoning.

Each root \\(r_i\\) satisfies \\(r_i = \\frac{1}{13 - \\omega_i}\\), where \\(\\omega_i\\) are the 10th roots of -1. The sum required is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} |13 - \\omega_i|^2 \\). \n\nBy expanding and summing over all roots, the total sum is 1726. Since each pair contributes twice, the required sum is half of this value, giving 863.\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{863}\\)"
