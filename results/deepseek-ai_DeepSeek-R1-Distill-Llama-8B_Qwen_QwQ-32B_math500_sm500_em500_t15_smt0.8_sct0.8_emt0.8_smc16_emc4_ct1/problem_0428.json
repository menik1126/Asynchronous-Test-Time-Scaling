It's a complex equation, and the question is about finding the sum of the reciprocals of \\(r_i \\overline{r_i}\\) for each pair of roots. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). This seems like it could be simplified or maybe factored somehow. Hmm, perhaps if I set \\(y = 13x - 1\\), then the equation becomes \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\). Wait, but \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are related because \\(y = 13x - 1\\). Let me think about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor out \\(x^{10}\\) from the equation. Let me try that: \\(x^{10}(1 + ((13x - 1)/x)^{10}) = 0\\). But this would require \\(x \\neq 0\\), which might not be helpful because \\(x = 0\\) isn't a root here. So maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nWait, another thought: Since the equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), I can write it as \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, I get \\(x = \\omega (13x - 1)\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of -1. But \\(\\omega\\) would satisfy \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), so \\(\\omega^{20} = 1\\), meaning \\(\\omega\\) is a 20th root of unity, specifically an odd one because \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\).\n\nBut maybe it's better to consider the original equation. Since it's a polynomial equation of degree 10, it has 10 roots, and they come in conjugate pairs because the coefficients are real. So for each root \\(r_i\\), there is \\(\\overline{r_i}\\), which is its complex conjugate. That explains why there are 5 pairs"

Since \\(r_i \\overline{r_i}\\) is the modulus squared of \\(r_i\\), which is \\(|r_i|^2\\). Therefore, \\(1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) = 1/|r_i|^2\\). So the problem is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the moduli of the roots. Since each pair contributes the same value (because the modulus of \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r_i}\\) are the same), we can compute this for each pair and sum over all five pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to relate this to the coefficients of the polynomial. Let me recall that for a polynomial, the product of the roots is related to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. But here, since the roots come in conjugate pairs, their product \\(r_i \\overline{r_i}\\) is the modulus squared, but how does that relate to the coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\).

But maybe that's more complicated than necessary.\n\nWait, let me think about the roots of \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). For each root \\(x\\), it must satisfy \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). So, if \\(x\\) is a root, then \\(\\overline{x}\\) is also a root because the polynomial has real coefficients. Therefore, the roots come in conjugate pairs, as stated.\n\nNow, for each root \\(r\\), \\(r^{10} = - (13r - 1)^{10}\\). Dividing both sides by \\(r^{10}\\), assuming \\(r \\neq 0\\) (which it isn't, because plugging x=0 gives 1^10=0 which is false), we get 1 = - (13 - 1/r)^10. So, \\( (13 - 1/r)^{10} = -1 \\).

Each such \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of -1, so there are 10 roots. Since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each pair corresponds to a pair of roots \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\overline{\\omega}\\).

Since modulus squared is the same for \\(r\\) and \\(\\overline{r}\\), each pair contributes \\(1/|13 - \\omega|^2\\) twice?

So, maybe we can select five distinct roots \\(\\omega\\) such that \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), and then sum \\( |13 - \\omega|^2 \\) over these five roots. Alternatively, perhaps we can pair the roots and see if the sum simplifies.\n\nWait, let me count: the equation \\(x^{10} = -1\\) has 10 roots: \\(e^{(2k + 1)\\pi i /10}\\) for \\(k=0\\) to \\(9\\). So, if I pick all the roots where \\(k\\) is even, say, would that give me a subset that's sufficient? Let me see.

However, the sum over all roots \\(\\omega\\) of \\(\\Re(\\omega)\\) is the real part of the sum of all roots \\(\\omega\\).\n\nWait, the sum of all roots \\(\\omega\\) of the equation \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\) is zero. Because the equation is \\(\\omega^{10} + 1 = 0\\), so the sum of roots is the coefficient of \\(\\omega^9\\) divided by the coefficient of \\(\\omega^{10}\\), which is 0.

Therefore, each \\( \\omega \\) is on the unit circle, so \\( |13 - \\omega|^2 = (13 - \\Re(\\omega))^2 + (\\Im(\\omega))^2 \\).\n\nBut the sum of \\(|13 - \\omega|^2\\) over all 10 roots \\( \\omega \\) of \\( \\omega^{10} = -1 \\) can be computed as follows.

But since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each pair contributes twice the same term. \n\nWait, but we are summing each pair once, so if we have five pairs, each contributing one term, which are |13 - ω_i|^2 for each ω_i in one from each conjugate pair. Therefore, the total sum is the same as the sum over all 10 roots divided by 2, because each term is counted twice in the total. Therefore, the sum is 1700 / 2 = 850.\n\nWait, but in the example, the sum over the single pair is 340, which is equal to the sum over all two roots (340 = 170 +170). But if we have five pairs, each contributing once, the sum would be 1700 /2 = 850. \n\nWait, no, in the example, since the equation is degree 2, there's one pair, and the sum is over two roots, so it's 340, which is the same as the total over all roots. So, in the original problem, the sum over five pairs would be the same as the total over all 10 roots, which is 1700.\n\nWait, but according to the degree 2 example, the sum over the pair (two terms) is equal to the sum over all roots (two terms), so in the original problem, the sum over five pairs (ten terms, but grouped into five pairs) would be the same as the total over all roots (ten terms), which is 1700. Therefore, the answer is 1700.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, the sum over all roots is 1700, and in the example, the problem's sum is equal to the sum over all roots.
