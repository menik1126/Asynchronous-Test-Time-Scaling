            "output": "First, I need to determine how many seats are available around the square table. Since each side has 2 people, and there are 4 sides, the total number of seats is 8.\n\nNext, I should consider the rotational symmetry of the table. If one configuration can be rotated to look like another, they are considered the same. This means that arrangements that can be rotated into each other should not be counted separately.\n\nTo account for the rotational symmetry, I can fix one person's position. By doing this, I eliminate the rotations as unique configurations. Once one person is fixed, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements, considering rotational symmetry, is 7!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we must account for **rotational symmetry**. Two configurations are considered the same if one can be rotated to obtain the other.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - The table is square, with 4 sides.\n   - **2 people** are seated on each side.\n   - Total seats available = 4 sides × 2 people = **8 people**.\n\n2. **Account for Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - If you rotate the table by 90 degrees, the arrangement should remain essentially the same.\n   - Therefore, we must consider **distinct arrangements** up to rotation.\n\n3. **Fix One Person's Position:**\n   - To eliminate rotational symmetry, fix one person in a specific seat.\n   - This means the rest of the people can be arranged in a linear fashion around the table.\n\n4. **Arrange the Remaining People:**\n   - After fixing one person, we have **7 people** left to arrange.\n   - These 7 people can be arranged in **7!** ways.\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Number of Arrangements:**\n   - **7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040**\n   - So, there are **5040** distinct ways to seat 8 people around the table, considering rotational symmetry.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5040}\n\\]"
