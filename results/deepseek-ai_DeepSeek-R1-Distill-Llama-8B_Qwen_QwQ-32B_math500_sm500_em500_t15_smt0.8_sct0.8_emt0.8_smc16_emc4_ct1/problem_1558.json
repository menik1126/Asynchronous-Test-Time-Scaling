Each side needs to have exactly 2 people seated. So, altogether, we'll have 8 people being seated around the table.\n\nSince the problem states that two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another, this means that we need to account for rotational symmetry to avoid overcounting. Rotations can complicate the counting process because they can make different arrangements appear identical.\n\nI'll consider fixing one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. Fixing one person's seat effectively reduces the number of variables in the problem, making it easier to count the distinct configurations.\n\nOnce one person's position is fixed, we can determine the positions of the remaining seven people relative to the fixed position. However, due to the symmetry of the square table, some arrangements might still be equivalent when considering reflections or rotations. To handle this, I'll need to account for these symmetries in the counting process.\n\nAfter fixing one person's seat, I'll proceed to seat the others in a way that respects the constraints of the table and avoids counting duplicates due to symmetry. This involves calculating the number of ways to arrange the remaining people while considering any symmetries that could make different arrangements equivalent.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the total number of distinct seating arrangements by considering all possible unique configurations that remain after accounting for rotational and reflective symmetries.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotational symmetry, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix one person's seat** to eliminate rotational symmetry. This leaves 7 people to be seated.\n\n2. **Arrange the remaining 7 people** relative to the fixed person. However, due to the square's symmetry, some configurations might be equivalent under reflection or rotation.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of unique seating arrangements** by considering the symmetries of the square:\n   - **Rotational symmetry**: The square can be rotated in 4 different ways (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).\n   - **Reflective symmetry**: The table can be reflected over 2 axes, doubling the number of symmetries.\n\n4. **Apply Burnside's Lemma"

For a square table, only the identity rotation (0°) fixes all arrangements, while others require periodicity. Since seating 2 per side, rotations by 90°, 180°, and 270° would require all sides to have identical arrangements, which is impossible unless all people are identical, so only identity contributes.\n   - **Fixing reflections**: Similar reasoning applies; reflections would require mirrored arrangements, which are distinct unless people are identical.\n\n5. **Simplify using rotational symmetry only** (since reflections are not mentioned as equivalent):\n   - Fixing one seat reduces rotational symmetry.

So contribution: 8! = 40320.\n\n- **90° rotation**: To be fixed under a 90° rotation, the arrangement must be the same after rotating 90°, which cycles four seats. Since 8 seats, rotating 90° cycles four seats (each 90° moves each seat to the next position). For an arrangement to be fixed under this rotation, all elements in the cycle must be equal.

Therefore, indeed, no fixed arrangements under 180°.\n\nThus, Burnside's Lemma gives 10080.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the table has 4 sides with 2 seats each, so the seats are grouped into sides. Therefore, the rotation by 180° would swap the sides, but the people on each side are in pairs. Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the two people on a side are seated in a specific order (e.g., clockwise), so rotating the table would move the entire side.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the seats are arranged in pairs on each side, so rotating the table by 90° moves each side to the next side's position. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to arranging the 8 people in a circular arrangement with rotational symmetry of order 4, but with the added structure of sides.\n\nHowever, the Burnside's Lemma calculation still holds because the seats are labeled in a circular manner, so the count remains 10080.\n\nBut let me think differently. Suppose we fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. Let's fix person A at seat 1. Then, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. Since we've fixed one seat, rotations are accounted for, so the total is 7! = 5040.\n\nWait, this contradicts Burnside's result.

But if the table is unlabeled, meaning the seats are not fixed in space, then we must use Burnside's Lemma.\n\nBut in this problem, the table is square, and the sides are distinguishable (each side has 2 seats).

Wait, but in that case, Burnside's Lemma gave 24/4=6, which is the same as 4! /4.\n\nWait, so for the original problem, Burnside's Lemma gives 8! /4=10080.\n\nWait, but in the 4-person case, Burnside's Lemma gives 4! /4=6, which is correct. So for 8 people, it should be 8! /4=10080.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10080.\n\nBut when I fixed one person, I got 7! =5040, which is half of that. Why?\n\nAh, because fixing one person's seat not only accounts for rotations but also fixes a side's orientation. Wait, perhaps in the problem, the sides are distinguishable (like a square table with a specific orientation), so fixing a seat is appropriate. But the problem states that rotations are considered equivalent, so the sides are not labeled.\n\nWait, the problem says \"two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.\" So rotating the table doesn't change the configuration. Therefore, the sides are not labeled, so we must use Burnside's Lemma.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 10080.\n\nBut let me think again with fixing one person.\n\nIf we fix one person's seat, say person A is seated at seat 1, then the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways. However, this counts all arrangements where person A is fixed, but rotations are already accounted for by fixing their position. Thus, this should give the correct count.\n\nBut according to Burnside's Lemma, it's 10080, which is double 5040. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps fixing one seat is not sufficient because the square has more symmetries. Wait, no—if you fix a seat, you're effectively choosing a reference point, so rotations are eliminated. Thus, the count should be 7!.\n\nBut Burnside's Lemma says 10080, which is 8! /4 = 40320 /4 =10080.\n\nWait, 8! /4 is 10080"

If you fix a seat, you are effectively considering the table as fixed in space (since you've fixed a seat's position), so rotations are no longer considered equivalent. Thus, fixing a seat is only valid if the table is fixed in space, which contradicts the problem's condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is Burnside's Lemma, giving 10080.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"seated around a square table with 2 people on a side\".

Therefore, the correct count is via Burnside's Lemma: 10080.\n\nHowever, I must have made a mistake in the Burnside calculation earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate Burnside's Lemma for the original problem:\n\nGroup elements: rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°.\n\n- **Identity (0°)**: All 8! arrangements are fixed. Contribution: 40320.\n\n- **90° rotation**: To be fixed, every 4th seat must be the same. Since 8 seats, rotating 90° (which is 2 seats per 90°, since 360/8=45° per seat). Wait, actually, rotating 90° moves each seat to the next seat 2 positions away? Wait, no.\n\nWait, a square table with 8 seats (2 per side). Let's number the seats clockwise from 1 to 8, with seats 1 and 2 on the first side, 3 and 4 on the next, etc.\n\nA 90° rotation moves each seat to the next side's first seat. So seat 1 goes to seat 3's position, seat 2 to seat 4, seat 3 to seat 5, etc. Thus, a 90° rotation cycles seats in a cycle of 4: (1 3 5 7)(2 4 6 8).\n\nFor an arrangement to be fixed under this rotation, all elements in each cycle must be equal.
