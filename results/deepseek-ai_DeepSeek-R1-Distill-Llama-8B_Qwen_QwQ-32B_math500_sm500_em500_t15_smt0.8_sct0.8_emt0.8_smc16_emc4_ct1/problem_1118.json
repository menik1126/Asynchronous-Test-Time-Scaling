            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where the value of y varies inversely as the square root of x. Hmm, let me try to understand what that means. I think inverse variation means that as one thing increases, the other decreases proportionally. So if y varies inversely as sqrt(x), that should mean y is proportional to 1 over sqrt(x), right?\n\nAlright, the problem says when x is 24, y is 15. And I need to find x when y is 3. Let me write this down.\n\nFirst, inverse variation can be written as y = k / sqrt(x), where k is a constant. So I need to find k first. When x is 24 and y is 15, I can plug those values into the equation to solve for k.\n\nSo, 15 = k / sqrt(24). Now, to find k, I should multiply both sides of the equation by sqrt(24). Let me calculate sqrt(24). Hmm, sqrt(24) is the same as 2*sqrt(6) because 24 is 4*6, and sqrt(4) is 2. So sqrt(24) is 2\u221a6.\n\nSo, 15 = k / (2\u221a6). To solve for k, I can multiply both sides by 2\u221a6. That gives me k = 15 * 2\u221a6. Let me compute that. 15 times 2 is 30, so k is 30\u221a6.\n\nNow that I have k, the equation relating y and x is y = 30\u221a6 / sqrt(x). Alright, now I need to find x when y is 3. So I'll substitute y with 3 in the equation.\n\nSo, 3 = 30\u221a6 / sqrt(x). To solve for sqrt(x), I can multiply both sides by sqrt(x) and divide both sides by 3. That gives me sqrt(x) = (30\u221a6) / 3.\n\nWait, (30\u221a6)/3 is equal to 10\u221a6. So sqrt(x) is 10\u221a6. To find x, I need to square both sides of the equation. So x = (10\u221a6)^2.\n\nCalculating that, (10)^2 is 100, and (\u221a6)^2 is 6. So 100 times 6 is 600. Therefore, x is 600 when y"

            "output": " is 3.\n\nLet me just go over it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the inverse variation, y = k / sqrt(x). Used the given x=24 and y=15 to find k, which turned out to be 30\u221a6. Then used that k to write the equation for any y and x. Plugged in y=3 and solved for sqrt(x) = 10\u221a6, then squared it to get x=600. Seems like everything checks out.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me double-check the multiplication. 15 times 2 is definitely 30, and 30 times sqrt(6) is 30\u221a6. Then when I substituted y=3, I had 3 = 30\u221a6 / sqrt(x). Multiplying both sides by sqrt(x) gives 3*sqrt(x) = 30\u221a6. Then dividing both sides by 3, sqrt(x) = 10\u221a6. Squaring that, x is (10\u221a6)^2 = 100*6 = 600. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo I think the answer is x=600 when y is 3.\n</think>\n\nThe value of \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), which means \\( y = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}} \\) for some constant \\( k \\).
