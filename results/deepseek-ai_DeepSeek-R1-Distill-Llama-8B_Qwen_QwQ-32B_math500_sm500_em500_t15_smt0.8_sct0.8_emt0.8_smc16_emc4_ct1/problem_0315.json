Set the denominator equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\n   \\]\n2. Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 56}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{81}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm 9}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the solutions are:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{5 - 9}{2} = -2\n   \\]\n   \n   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Horizontal Asymptote\nThe horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.\n\n1. Compare the degrees:\n   - Numerator degree: \\( 1 \\) (from \\( 2x \\))\n   - Denominator degree: \\( 2 \\) (from \\( x^2 \\))\n   \n   Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is"
