Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes. I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero there. So, to find a and b, I need to factor the denominator and find its roots.\n\nThe denominator is x\u00b2 -5x -14. Let me try to factor this quadratic. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14: 1 and -14, 2 and -7. Let me see: 2 and -7. 2 * (-7) = -14, and 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect! So, the denominator factors into (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a = -2 and b = 7. That takes care of a and b.\n\nNow, for the horizontal asymptote. I recall that the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The function is f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). The numerator is degree 1, denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote will be y = 0. Wait, is that always the case? Let me double-check.\n\nYes, when the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0.\n\nNow, adding them up: a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0. Let me compute that. -2 +7 is 5, and 5 + 0 is 5. So, the total is 5.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in factoring the denominator. The quadratic is x\u00b2 -5x -14. I factored it as (x + 2)(x -7). Let's multiply it back: x*x = x\u00b2, x*(-7) = -7x, "

So, vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x=7.\n\nAnd the horizontal asymptote is definitely 0 because degree of denominator is higher. So, c=0.\n\nSo, a+b+c is just -2 +7 +0 = 5. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the vertical asymptotes by finding the roots of the denominator, which factor as (x + 2)(x - 7), giving vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x = 7. Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by noting that since the denominator's degree (2) exceeds the numerator's degree (1), the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Adding these values together: -2 + 7 + 0 = 5.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{5}"
