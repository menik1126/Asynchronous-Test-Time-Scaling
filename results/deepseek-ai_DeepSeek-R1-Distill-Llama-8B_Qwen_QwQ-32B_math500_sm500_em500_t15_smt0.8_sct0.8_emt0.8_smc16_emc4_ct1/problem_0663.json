            "output": "I need to determine how many treeks equal the weight of one squig given the relationships between the weights of treeks, squigs, and goolees.\n\nFirst, let's assign variables to the unknown weights. Let T represent the weight of one treek, S represent the weight of one squig, and G represent the weight of one goolee.\n\nFrom the problem, the first relationship is that ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This can be translated into the equation:\n\n10T = 3S + G\n\nThe second relationship states that two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This gives us the second equation:\n\n2T + G = S\n\nNow, I have two equations with three variables. To find the number of treeks equal to one squig, I need to express S in terms of T.\n\nFrom the second equation, I can solve for G:\n\nG = S - 2T\n\nSubstituting this expression for G into the first equation:\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\nNow, I'll combine like terms:\n\n10T + 2T = 4S\n12T = 4S\n\nSolving for S in terms of T:\n\nS = 3T\n\nThis means that one squig weighs the same as three treeks. Therefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\nLet:\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Information into Equations**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee:\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( G \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n10T = 3S"
