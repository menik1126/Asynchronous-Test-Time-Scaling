Let’s denote the weight of one treek as T, one squig as S, and one goolee as G.\n\nFrom the first statement, ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives us the equation:\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says that two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This can be written as:\n2T + G = S.\n\nNow, substitute the expression for S from the second equation into the first equation:\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nSimplify and solve for G in terms of T:\n10T = 6T + 3G + G\n10T = 6T + 4G\nSubtract 6T from both sides:\n4T = 4G\nDivide both sides by 4:\nT = G.\n\nSince S = 2T + G and T = G, substitute G with T:\nS = 2T + T = 3T.\n\nFinally, to find how many treeks equal one squig, set S equal to 3T:\n3T = S.\n\nTherefore, three treeks weigh as much as one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step using algebraic equations.\n\n**Given:**\n1. **Ten treeks** weigh as much as **three squigs** and **one goolee**.\n2. **Two treeks** and **one goolee** are equal in weight to **one squig**.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Step 1: Translate the first statement into an equation.**\n\\[ 10T = 3S + G \\]\n\n**Step 2: Translate the second statement into another equation.**\n\\[ 2T + G = S \\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the value of \\( S \\) from the second equation into the first equation.**\n\\[ 10T = 3(2T + G) + G \\]\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the equation.**\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10T &= 6T + "
