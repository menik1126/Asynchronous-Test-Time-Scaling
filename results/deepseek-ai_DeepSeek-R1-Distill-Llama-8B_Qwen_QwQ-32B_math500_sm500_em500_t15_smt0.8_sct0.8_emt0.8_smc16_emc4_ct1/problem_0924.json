            "output": "First, I need to find a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84 and determine the set with the smallest possible sum.\n\nTo start, I'll factorize 84 into its prime components. 84 can be broken down into 2 × 42, then 42 into 2 × 21, and finally 21 into 3 × 7. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2² × 3 × 7.\n\nNext, I'll consider the different ways to combine these prime factors into distinct integers. The goal is to minimize the sum, so I should aim to create numbers that are as close to each other as possible.\n\nOne possible set is {2, 3, 7, 2}. However, this set has repeated numbers, which is not allowed. To make all numbers distinct, I can adjust the factors accordingly.\n\nBy distributing the prime factors differently, I can form the set {2, 3, 7, 2}. Since there's a repetition, I need to adjust it to ensure all numbers are distinct. Instead of repeating 2, I'll introduce a new number by combining some factors.\n\nFinally, after adjusting, the set {2, 3, 7, 2} is no longer valid due to repetition. Therefore, the minimal set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84 is {2, 3, 7, 6}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84 into its prime factors**:\n   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   Or, using exponents:\n   \\[\n   84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find distinct positive integers**:\n   We need to combine these prime factors into distinct integers. The goal is to minimize the sum of these integers.\n\n3. **Consider possible sets**:\n   - **Set 1**: \\(\\{2, 3, 7, 2\\}\\) — Not valid due to repetition.\n   - **Set 2**: \\(\\{2, 3, 7, 6\\}\\) — Valid and all distinct.\n     - **Calculation**:\n       \\[\n       2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 504\n"
