            "output": "First, I need to find a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84. My goal is to determine the set with the smallest possible sum.\n\nI'll start by factoring 84 into its prime factors to understand the numbers I can work with. The prime factors of 84 are 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.\n\nNow, I'll attempt to break down 84 into distinct integers. Starting with 1, since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product, I'll include 1 in the set.\n\nNext, I'll consider the largest prime factor, which is 7. Including 7 in the set gives me 1 × 7 = 7. To reach the product of 84, I need to include additional factors.\n\nThe remaining factors are 2 × 2 × 3. Taking 2 × 3 = 6 and multiplying it by 7 gives 42, which is too high. Instead, I'll try breaking it down further.\n\nI can include 2, 3, and 7 in the set. Calculating the product: 1 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 42, which is still less than 84. I need to include another factor.\n\nThe remaining factor is another 2. Including 2 again would mean repeating the number, which isn't allowed since the integers must be distinct. Therefore, I'll include 4 in the set instead. Now, the product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 7 = 168, which exceeds 84.\n\nTo reduce the product, I'll remove 4 and include 2 again. However, this also results in a duplicate. This suggests that including 1 might not be necessary to achieve a smaller sum.\n\nWithout 1, the smallest set would be 2 × 3 × 7 = 42, which is still less than 84. To reach the desired product, I'll need to include another number. The only feasible option is 2 again, but that's a duplicate.\n\nTherefore, the most optimal set is 1 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 42. However, since the product needs to be 84, I'll adjust by including 4 instead of 2. This gives me 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 7 = 168, which is double the required product.\n\nTo fix this,"

Let's try that.\n\nIf I use 1, 6, 7, and 2, the product is 1×2×6×7 = 84. The sum here is 1+2+6+7 = 16.\n\nAnother combination: 3, 4, 7. Their product is 3×4×7 = 84. The sum is 3+4+7 = 14. That's better.\n\nWait, 3×4×7 is exactly 84. So the set {3,4,7} has a product of 84 and a sum of 14. Is there a smaller sum?\n\nLet me check other combinations. What about 2, 3, 14? 2×3×14 = 84. The sum is 2+3+14 = 19, which is higher.\n\nOr 2, 6, 7: 2×6×7 = 84. Sum is 2+6+7 = 15. Still higher than 14.\n\nWhat about 1, 2, 3, 14? Product is 1×2×3×14 = 84. Sum is 1+2+3+14 = 20. Not better.\n\nAnother possibility: 1, 3, 4, 7. Product is 1×3×4×7 = 84. Sum is 1+3+4+7 = 15. Still higher than 14.\n\nAlternatively, 1, 2, 6, 7: sum 16. Not better.\n\nWait, the set {3,4,7} gives a sum of 14. Is there a way to get a lower sum?\n\nLet me see if there's a combination with four numbers. For example, 2, 3, 4, and 3.5? But they have to be integers. So 2, 3, 4, and 3.5 is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, 2, 3, 14"
