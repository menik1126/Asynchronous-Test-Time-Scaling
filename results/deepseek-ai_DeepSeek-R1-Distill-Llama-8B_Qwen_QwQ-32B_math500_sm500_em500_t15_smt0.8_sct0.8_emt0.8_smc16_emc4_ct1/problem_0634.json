            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2]. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that the domain of a function includes all the real numbers for which the function is defined. Since g(x) is a square root, the expression inside the square root, which is called the radicand, must be greater than or equal to zero. Otherwise, we'd be taking the square root of a negative number, which isn't a real number. So, my first task is to find the values of x for which the radicand is non-negative.\n\nThe radicand here is (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Hmm, okay, so I can set this greater than or equal to zero and solve for x. Let me write that out:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \u2265 0.\n\nNow, I need to simplify this expression. Maybe I can expand both squares and then subtract them. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, expanding (x - 3)^2:\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nNext, expanding (x - 8)^2:\n(x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64.\n\nNow, subtract the second expansion from the first:\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64).\n\nLet's do the subtraction term by term:\nx^2 - x^2 cancels out, leaving 0.\n-6x - (-16x) becomes -6x + 16x, which is 10x.\n9 - 64 is -55.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to 10x - 55 \u2265 0.\n\nWait, that seems manageable. So 10x - 55 \u2265 0. To solve for x, add 55 to both sides:\n\n10x \u2265 55.\n\nThen divide both sides by 10:\n\nx \u2265 5.5.\n\nHmm, okay, so the radicand is non-negative when x is greater than or equal to 5.5. That means the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x"

Therefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to mix up signs when expanding squares. So, I expanded (x - 3)^2 correctly to x^2 - 6x + 9, and (x - 8)^2 to x^2 - 16x + 64. Subtracting the latter from the former: (x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) = x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64. The x^2 terms cancel, leaving (-6x + 16x) which is 10x, and (9 - 64) which is -55. So, yes, 10x - 55 \u2265 0, leading to x \u2265 5.5. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could factor the original expression before expanding. Maybe that's a better approach to avoid mistakes. Let me try that.\n\nThe original expression is (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Wait, that looks like a difference of squares, which can be factored as (A)^2 - (B)^2 = (A - B)(A + B), where A = (x - 3) and B = (x - 8). So, let's apply that.\n\nSo, factoring:\n\n[(x - 3) - (x - 8)] * [(x - 3) + (x - 8)] \u2265 0.\n\nLet me compute each bracket separately.\n\nFirst bracket: (x - 3) - (x - 8).\n\nSimplify: x - 3 - x + 8 = (x - x) + (-3 + 8) = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nSecond bracket: (x - 3) + (x - 8).\n\nSimplify: x - 3 + x - 8 = 2x - 11.\n\nSo, the expression becomes 5 * (2x - "

Thus, x is in [5.5, \u221e). Therefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5.\n\nWait, but I can also think about this graphically. The expression under the square root is a quadratic function, and perhaps analyzing its graph would help. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Let's write this as f(x) = (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2.\n\nExpanding it again, as before, f(x) = 10x - 55. So, it's a linear function with a slope of 10 and y-intercept at -55. So, the graph is a straight line. The points where f(x) = 0 are where the line crosses the x-axis.\n\nSolving 10x - 55 = 0 gives x = 55/10 = 5.5, which is the x-intercept. Since the function is linear and increasing (because the slope is positive), it will be negative for x < 5.5 and positive for x > 5.5. Thus, the domain is x \u2265 5.5, which again confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \\) is found by determining where the radicand is non-negative. Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we get \\( 10x - 55 \\geq 0 \\), leading to \\( x \\geq 5.5 \\). Therefore, the smallest \\( x \\) is \\( 5."
