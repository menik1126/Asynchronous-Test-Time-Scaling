            "output": "First, I need to calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\nSo, for the cylindrical beaker with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, plugging in the values: V = π * (3)² * 8 = 72π cm³.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven that the spherical tank has a radius of 6 cm, substituting into the formula: V = (4/3)π * (6)³ = (4/3)π * 216 = 288π cm³.\n\nNow, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, I'll divide the volume of the sphere by the volume of one cylindrical beaker.\n\nSo, 288π cm³ divided by 72π cm³ equals 4. Therefore, it will take 4 such cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill a spherical tank.\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( r \\) = radius of the cylinder\n   - \\( h \\) = height of the cylinder\n\n   For the cylindrical beaker:\n   - \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   - \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( R \\"
