First, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\). The radius of the tank is 6 cm, so plugging that in gives a volume of \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = 144\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll find the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( \\pi r^2 h \\). The beaker has a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm, so its volume is \\( \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nFinally, to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the tank's volume by the beaker's volume: \\( \\frac{144\\pi}{72\\pi} = 2 \\). Therefore, it will take 2 such beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank\nThe formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) of a sphere is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n\\]\n\nGiven that the radius \\( r \\) of the spherical tank is 6 cm:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times 216 = 144\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n### 2. Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker\nThe formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{cylinder}} \\) of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nGiven that the height \\( h \\) of the beaker is 8 cm and the radius \\( r \\) is 3 cm:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = "
