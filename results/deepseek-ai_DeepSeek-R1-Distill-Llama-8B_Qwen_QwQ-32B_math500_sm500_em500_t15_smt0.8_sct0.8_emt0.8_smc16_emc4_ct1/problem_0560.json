            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of seating arrangements for the committee members around a circular table. There are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, making a total of 11 members.\n\nSince the seating is circular, the number of linear arrangements of n members is (n-1)! to account for rotational symmetry. However, in this problem, each party's members must sit together. This means that instead of arranging all 11 members individually, I can treat each party as a single unit or \"block.\"\n\nThere are three distinct blocks: one for Democrats, one for Republicans, and one for the Independent. The number of ways to arrange these three blocks around the table is (3-1)! = 2 ways. This accounts for the circular nature of the table.\n\nNext, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange them, and similarly, there are 5! ways to arrange the Republicans. The Independent has only 1 member, so there's only 1 way to arrange that block.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of seating arrangements, I'll multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the members within each block: 2 * (5!) * (5!) * 1.\n\nThis gives the total number of valid seating arrangements considering the circular table and the block constraints.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table with all members of each party sitting together, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Blocks**:  \n   - **Democratic Block**: 5 members.  \n   - **Republican Block**: 5 members.  \n   - **Independent Block**: 1 member.  \n   \n2. **Arrange the Blocks Around the Table (Circular Arrangement)**:  \n   Since the table is circular, the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) objects is \\( (n-1)! \\). Here, there are 3 blocks, so the number of ways to arrange them is \\( (3-1)! = 2! = 2 \\) ways.\n\n3. **Arrange Members Within Each Block**:  \n   - **Democrats**: The number of ways to arrange 5 members is \\( 5! \\).  \n   - **Republicans**: Similarly, \\( 5! \\) ways.  \n   - **Independent**:"
