Therefore, I can fix one person's position to eliminate equivalent rotations.\n\nLet's fix a Democrat in one seat to simplify the problem. This choice breaks the rotational symmetry, and we won't count rotations as distinct.\n\nNext, I need to arrange the remaining Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent. There are 4 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, making a total of 10 people.\n\nBecause the members of each party must sit together, I can think of each party as a single unit. Therefore, there are 3 units to arrange: the Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these 3 units around a circular table is (3-1)! = 2. This accounts for the circular permutations of the blocks.\n\nHowever, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. The 4 Democrats can be arranged in 4! ways, the 5 Republicans in 5! ways, and the 1 Independent has only 1 way to arrange.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks with the permutations within each block to get the total number of distinct seatings.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Fix a Position**: Since the table is circular, we can fix one person's seat to eliminate equivalent rotations. Let's fix a Democrat in one seat.\n\n2. **Arrange the Party Blocks**: Now, we need to arrange the remaining 4 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. Each party must sit together, so treat each party as a single \"block\".\n\n3. **Calculate Circular Arrangements**: There are 3 blocks (D, R, I). The number of ways to arrange n objects around a circular table is \\( (n-1)! \\). So, \\( (3-1)! = 2 \\) ways.\n\n4. **Arrange Within Each Block**:\n   - Democrats: 4! ways\n   - Republicans: 5! ways\n   - Independent: 1 way\n\n5. **Total Arrangements**: Multiply the circular arrangements by the internal permutations of each block.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\n\\boxed{(4! \\times 5"

Wait, the Independent is a single person, so their block can't be arranged further. The Democrats are fixed with one person, so actually, when we fix one Democrat, the remaining 4 can be arranged in 4! ways. The Republicans are 5, so 5!.\n\nBut the blocks themselves: after fixing one Democrat, the blocks are the remaining Democrats (as a block), Republicans, and Independent. Wait, actually, when we fix one Democrat, the entire Democrat block is considered as a single unit, but since we fixed one Democrat's position, the other Democrats can still be arranged in 4! ways. The blocks to arrange are the Republican block and the Independent block, but since the Democrat block is fixed in position, the remaining two blocks (R and I) can be arranged in 2! ways.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, when we fix one Democrat's seat, the entire Democrat block is fixed in position? Or can the Democrat block still rotate?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to clarify the approach again.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nFirst, treat each party as a single block. Since it's a circular table, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is (number of blocks -1)! So, 3 blocks: (3-1)! = 2!.\n\nThen, within each block, the members can be arranged in their own ways. So Democrats: 5!, Republicans:5!, Independent:1!.\n\nBut since the table is circular, we have to fix one block's position to account for rotational symmetry. So, fixing the Democrat block's position, then the remaining two blocks (Republican and Independent) can be arranged in 2! ways. Then, within the Democrat block, they can be arranged in 5! ways (since all 5 are part of the block), but since we fixed their position, maybe we need to adjust?\n\nWait, confusion arises here. Let me think carefully.\n\nWhen arranging blocks around a circular table, fixing one block's position removes rotational symmetry. So, if we fix the Democrat block in a specific position, then the remaining two blocks (Republican and Independent) can be arranged in 2! ways. \n\nWithin the Democrat block, the "

Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, when considering the circular arrangement, the formula is usually \\((k-1)!\\) for k blocks. Here, k=3, so 2!. Then, multiply by permutations within blocks.\n\nBut wait, I fixed the Democrat block's position. So, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is 2! (since one block is fixed). Then, the Democrats within their block can be arranged in 5! ways, Republicans in 5! ways, and Independent is fixed as 1.\n\nSo, total arrangements: 2! × 5! × 5! = 2 × 120 × 120 = 28,800.\n\nWait, but initially, when I fixed a single Democrat, I considered the remaining Democrats as 4!, but actually, if the Democrat block is fixed, then the 5 Democrats can be arranged in 5! ways within their own block. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct seatings is 28,800.\n\nBut wait, let me verify with another approach.\n\nAnother way is to consider that in a circular table, the number of ways to arrange n objects where each group of objects must stick together can be calculated by:\n\n1. Treat each group as a single entity. So, with 3 groups (D, R, I), the number of circular arrangements is (3-1)! = 2!.\n\n2. Then, multiply by the permutations within each group.\n\nSo, D:5!, R:5!, I:1.\n\nThus, total arrangements: 2! × 5! × 5! = 2 × 120 × 120 = 28,800.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 28,800.\n\nBut wait, let me see.

Therefore, fixing the position of the entire block is the right approach, leading to 2! × 5! ×5!.\n\nAlternatively, if we fix a single Democrat's seat, then the rest of the Democrats can be arranged in 4! ways, but the block's position is fixed. Then, the other two blocks can be arranged in 2!.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose we fix one Democrat in a specific seat. Then, the remaining 4 Democrats must be arranged in the next 4 seats adjacent to the fixed Democrat (since they must all sit together). So, the Democrat block is fixed in position (starting at the fixed seat), so the order of the Democrats can be arranged in 4! ways (since the first is fixed, the rest can be arranged in 4! ways? Wait, no. Wait, if we fix one Democrat's seat, the entire block can still be rotated? Hmm, perhaps this complicates.\n\nAlternatively, when treating the blocks as units, the standard formula is (number of blocks -1)! × permutations within each block. So, that would be (3-1)! ×5!×5!×1! = 2×120×120=28,800.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 28,800.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all the members of each party all sit next to each other\". So, the blocks must be arranged around the table. The standard formula for circular arrangements with blocks is indeed (number of blocks -1)! multiplied by the permutations within each block.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2! ×5!×5! = 2×120×120=28,800.\n\nBut the initial problem mentions 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. So, total 11 people. Wait, hold on! Wait, the problem says 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. So total 11 people. But in my previous calculation, I considered 5 Democrats, so 5!, but the problem says 5 Democrats. Wait, the problem says \"5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent\".

So, in arranging the blocks, it's 3 blocks: (5,5,1).\n\nNumber of circular arrangements: (3-1)! = 2.\n\nThen, within each block: 5!, 5!, and 1!.\n\nThus, total arrangements: 2×5!×5! = 2×120×120=28,800.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 28,800.\n\nBut I had a confusion earlier whether it's 4! or 5! for Democrats because I thought a Democrat was fixed, but actually, when treating the block as a single unit, if we fix the entire block, the order within the block can vary. So, if you fix the position of the entire Democrat block, then the order of the 5 Democrats inside can be arranged in 5! ways.
