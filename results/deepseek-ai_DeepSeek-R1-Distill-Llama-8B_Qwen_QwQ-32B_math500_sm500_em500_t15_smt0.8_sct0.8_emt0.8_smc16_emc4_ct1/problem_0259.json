This means that 1 Blinket is equal to 7/3 Drinkets.\n\nNext, I need to find how many Blinkets correspond to 1 Trinket. It's given that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets.\n\nNow, I'll establish the relationship between Trinkets and Drinkets by multiplying the number of Blinkets per Trinket by the number of Drinkets per Blinket.\n\nFinally, by converting 56 Drinkets into Blinkets and then into Trinkets, I'll find the equivalent value in Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nLet's convert **56 Drinkets** to **Trinkets** step by step using the given exchange rates.\n\n1. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**\n   - **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**\n   \n2. **Find the Equivalent of 1 Blinket in Drinkets:**\n   \n   \\[\n   3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 1 \\text{ Blinket} = \\frac{7}{3} \\text{ Drinkets}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert 1 Trinket to Drinkets:**\n   \n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ Trinket} = 4 \\text{ Blinkets} \\times \\frac{7}{3} \\text{ Drinkets} = \\frac{28}{3} \\text{ Drinkets}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Convert 56 Drinkets to Trinkets:**\n   \n   - **1 Drinket =** \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{28}{3}}\\) Trinkets = \\(\\frac{3}{28}\\) Trinkets\n   \n   - **56 Drinkets =** \\(56 \\times \\frac{3}{28}\\) Trinkets = \\(6\\) Trinkets\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"
