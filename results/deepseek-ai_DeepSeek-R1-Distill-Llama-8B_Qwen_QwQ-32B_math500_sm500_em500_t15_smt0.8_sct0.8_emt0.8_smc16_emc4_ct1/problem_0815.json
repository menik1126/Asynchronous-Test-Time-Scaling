The leading coefficient \\( a_n \\) is 2, and the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is 66. The roots are distinct integers, and I need to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling some properties of polynomials with integer coefficients. If a polynomial has integer coefficients and a root \\( r \\), then the conjugate roots must also be integers because the coefficients are integers. So, if there's a root \\( r \\), there should be other roots \\( s \\) such that the polynomial can be factored accordingly.\n\nGiven that all roots are distinct integers, the polynomial can be expressed as \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), where each \\( r_i \\) is an integer, and all \\( r_i \\) are different.\n\nI need to find the polynomial with the smallest possible \\( |a_{n-1}| \\). Since \\( a_{n-1} \\) is the coefficient of \\( x^{n-1} \\), which corresponds to the sum of the roots multiplied by \\( -2 \\) (because in the expansion of \\( (x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), the coefficient of \\( x^{n-1} \\) is \\( -(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n) \\)), then \\( a_{n-1} = -2(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n) \\). So, \\( |a_{n-1}| = 2|r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n| \\). To minimize this, I need to find a set of distinct integers whose sum is as small as possible in absolute value.\n\nNow, the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is equal to \\( 2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\).

Therefore, the product of the roots must be either 33 or -33 depending on the degree \\( n \\).\n\nWait, 33 is not that large, so perhaps the roots are factors of 33. The divisors of 33 are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33. So, the roots have to be among these integers.\n\nBut since there are distinct integers, each root is unique, so I need to pick a set of distinct integers from the divisors of 33 (in magnitude) such that their product is 33 or -33, depending on the degree. The product must be 33 for even degree and -33 for odd degree because \\( (-1)^n \\) is 1 if \\( n \\) is even and -1 if \\( n \\) is odd.\n\nSo, first, let's consider what combinations of distinct divisors of 33 can yield 33 or -33.\n\nSince 33 is 3 × 11, we can try to use these as roots. But we also have 1 and -1 as factors, so maybe including more roots by splitting the factors further.\n\nWait, for instance, if I take roots as 3, 11, and 1, their product is 33. But since the degree would then be 3, the product would be 33, and the constant term \\( a_0 \\) would be 2 × 33 = 66, which matches. But 3, 11, and 1 are all distinct integers, so that's a possibility.\n\nBut then, let's calculate \\( a_{n-1} \\) for this case. The sum of the roots would be 1 + 3 + 11 = 15, so \\( a_{n-1} = -2 \\times 15 = -30 \\), so \\( |a_{n-1}| = 30 \\).\n\nBut maybe we can find a set with a smaller sum. Let's see if we can have more roots, i.e., a higher degree, so that maybe the sum can cancel out some of the factors.\n\nWait, if I take four roots, for example, maybe with two positive and two negative, so that their product is positive 33, because 4 is even,"

If n is odd, then the product would be -33. So, perhaps using negative roots can help reduce the sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using more roots with smaller absolute values so that their sum is smaller.\n\nLet me think. Let's see possible factorizations of 33 into distinct integers.\n\nFirst, 33 can be written as 3 × 11 × 1. That's three roots. Alternatively, 33 can be written as (-1) × (-3) × 11, but that would be three roots again, but with two negatives. The product would be (-1)(-3)(11) = 33. The sum would be (-1) + (-3) + 11 = 7. Then, the coefficient would be -2 × 7 = -14, so |a_{n-1}| = 14. That's better.\n\nWait, that's a better sum. Let me check that again. If the roots are -1, -3, and 11, then their product is (-1)(-3)(11) = 33. Since n is 3 (odd), then the product would be (-1)^3 times the product of roots equals - (product of roots). Wait, hold on, let me re-examine the formula.\n\nWait, the constant term is \\( a_0 = 2 \\times (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) \\). So, if n is 3 (odd), then \\( (-1)^3 = -1 \\), so \\( a_0 = 2 \\times (-1) \\times (product of roots) \\). Therefore, 66 = -2*(product of roots). Therefore, product of roots must be -33. Wait, so in this case, if the roots are -1, -3, 11, their product is (-1)(-3)(11) = 33. Then, since n is 3, the product times (-1)^3 would be 33*(-1) = -33, so 2*(-33) = -66, but"

Let me clarify.\n\nGiven f(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn), when expanded, the constant term is 2*(-1)^n*(r1 r2 ... rn).\n\nSo, in our case, 2*(-1)^n*(r1 r2 ... rn) = 66.\n\nSo, 2*(-1)^n*(product) = 66 → (-1)^n*(product) = 33.\n\nSo, regardless of n, the product is 33 if n is even, and -33 if n is odd.\n\nWait, so for n even, product is 33, for n odd, product is -33.\n\nSo, for n = 3, which is odd, the product of roots would have to be -33, so the product r1 r2 r3 = -33. So, if I take roots like 3, 11, and -1, then 3*11*(-1) = -33, which is correct.\n\nIn that case, the sum of roots would be 3 + 11 + (-1) = 13. So, a_{n-1} = -2*13 = -26. Therefore, |a_{n-1}| = 26. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum was 7, but that must have been a mistake. Wait, wait, perhaps I was confusing the sign earlier.\n\nWait, so if the product is -33, and n is 3, then the roots can be 3, 11, and -1, whose product is -33, and sum is 3 + 11 - 1 = 13, so |a_{n-1}| = 2*13 = 26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can get a lower sum by using more roots. Let's try n=4, which is even, so the product of roots would need to be 33.\n\nHow can 33 be factored into four distinct integers? Hmm, let me think. 33 can be factored as 1 × (-1) × 3 × 11. Let me check: 1*(-1)*3*11 = (-1)*33 = -33, but since n is 4, which is even, the product should be 33, so"
