The polynomial is given as f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0. I know that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. Also, all the roots of this polynomial are distinct integers. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of polynomials with integer coefficients and integer roots. If a polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, then the roots must divide the constant term, right? Because of the Rational Root Theorem, any possible rational root p/q, where p divides a_0 and q divides a_n. Since all the roots here are integers and a_n is 2, which is prime, the possible roots must be factors of a_0, which is 66.\n\nSo, what are the factors of 66? Let's list them. 66 can be factored into 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, and 66. So, these are the possible integer roots. But wait, since all roots are distinct, and the polynomial is monic if a_n=1, but in this case, a_n is 2. So, actually, the polynomial is 2 times a monic polynomial with integer roots? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, if the polynomial is 2x^n + ... + 66, then the roots would be such that when we factor out 2, the roots satisfy certain conditions. Let me correct myself: the polynomial is 2x^n + ... + 66, so if r is a root, then f(r) = 0. So, 2r^n + a_{n-1}r^{n-1} + ... + 66 = 0. Hmm, but since all roots are integers, we can factor this polynomial as 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn), where each ri is an integer.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the polynomial can be written as 2 times the product of (x - ri) for each root ri. Therefore,"

So, in order to find a_{n-1}, which is the coefficient of x^{n-1}, that would relate to the sum of the roots multiplied by 2? Wait, let me recall Vieta's formula.\n\nVieta's formula says that for a monic polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is minus the sum of the roots. But since our polynomial is 2*(x - r1)...(x - rn), then the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the expanded form would be 2*(-1)*(sum of roots). Therefore, a_{n-1} is equal to -2*(r1 + r2 + ... + rn). Wait, let me confirm that.\n\nLet me think of a simple case. Suppose n=2. Then f(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2). Expanding this gives 2x^2 - 2(r1 + r2)x + 2r1r2. So indeed, the coefficient of x is -2(r1 + r2). So in general, for the polynomial of degree n, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, the absolute value |a_{n-1}| is 2 times the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Therefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to make the sum of the roots as close to zero as possible. \n\nTherefore, our problem reduces to selecting distinct integer roots (dividing 66) such that their sum has the smallest possible absolute value, and then multiplying that by 2. But also, the constant term a0 is 66, so the product of the roots (times the leading coefficient) divided by the leading coefficient term? Wait, actually, let me check the constant term.\n\nIn the polynomial f(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn), the constant term is 2*(-r1)*(-r2)*...*(-rn). So, the constant term is 2*(-1)^n (r1*r2*...*rn). Since the constant term a0 is given as 66, so:\n\n2*(-1)^n (r1*r2*...*rn) = 66.\n\nTherefore, (-1"

So, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n.\n\nSo, now, we have that the product of the roots is either 33 or -33. So, we need to choose a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, such that the sum of the roots is as close to zero as possible in absolute value. Because we want to minimize |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|.\n\nSo, the problem is now to find a set of distinct integers, factors of 33 or -33, whose product is either 33 or -33, and whose sum has the smallest possible absolute value.\n\nTherefore, let me factor 33. 33 = 1 * 3 * 11. So, the positive factors are 1, 3, 11, and 33. Also, considering negative factors, since the product could be -33, so factors can be negative as well. But we have to remember that the product is 33 or -33, so depending on the number of negative roots, the product will be positive or negative.\n\nWait, so if the number of negative roots is even, the product will be positive, and if it's odd, the product will be negative. So, whether n is even or odd will affect that, but since n is the degree of the polynomial, which can be variable.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think in terms of possible combinations. Let me list all possible factorizations of 33 and -33 into distinct integers.\n\nSince 33 is 1 * 3 * 11, and 1, 3, 11 are all primes except 1. So, the possible factorizations into distinct integers would be:\n\nCase 1: All positive roots.\n\nSo, the product is 33. Therefore, the roots could be 1, 3, 11.\n\nAlternatively, we can also have 1, -1, -3, 11, but wait, that would have four roots, and their product would be (1)*(-1)*(-3)*11 = 33, which is positive.

Wait, the Rational Root Theorem says the rational roots are ± factors of a0 divided by factors of a_n. So factors of 66 divided by factors of 2. So factors of 66 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66, and factors of 2 are 1 and 2. So possible rational roots reduced to lowest terms are ±1, ±1/2, ±2, ±3, ±3/2, etc. But since the problem states that all roots are integers, so only the integer ones: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66. So, actually, I was wrong earlier. The roots can include factors of 66, even if they are not factors of 33, because the leading coefficient is 2, so for example, a root can be 2, but because when reduced, the denominator is 2, but since the root must be integer, that implies that the denominator must divide the numerator. So actually, yes, roots can be those integers where 2 divides the numerator (i.e., the root must be a multiple of 1 over gcd(2, root's denominator). Hmm, maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nWait, to clarify, the roots are integers, so for a root r = p/q where reduced fraction, then since it's an integer, q=1. So the rational root theorem says that p divides a0 and q divides a_n. Since it's integer, q=1. So the possible integer roots must divide a0, which is 66. Therefore, the roots have to be among ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66. So that's more options. So my earlier mistake was not considering 2, 6, etc.\n\nTherefore, this changes things.

Actually, from the Rational Root Theorem, the possible roots are p/q where p divides a0 and q divides a_n. Since a_n is 2, which is prime, the possible denominators are 1 and 2. So p/q must be integer, so q can be only 1 or 2. But p must divide a0=66, so the possible roots are integers (q=1) and half-integers (q=2). But since the roots must be integers, then q must divide p, meaning p must be even, so q=2. Hence, possible roots are integers of the form p/2 where p divides 66, so p must be even divisors of 66. So the possible even divisors of 66 are 2, 22, 66. Therefore, the possible integer roots can be p/2 where p is an even divisor of 66.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me recall the Rational Root Theorem: all possible rational roots p/q are such that p divides the constant term and q divides the leading coefficient. Since the leading coefficient is 2, q can be 1 or 2. So, possible rational roots are:\n\nWhen q=1: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66.\n\nWhen q=2: ±1/2, ±3/2, etc. But since the polynomial has integer roots, all roots must be integers, so the only possible roots are those from q=1: the integer divisors of 66. So, the possible integer roots are as above. So, roots can be ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66.\n\nSo, that changes my previous consideration. Earlier, I thought only factors of 33, but that's incorrect because the leading coefficient is 2, which allows more roots such as 2, 6, 22, 66, etc.\n\nSo, given that, I need to find a set of distinct integers from the list above whose product is either 33 or -33 (since a0"

So, if n is even, then product is 33; if n is odd, product is -33. But since the problem states that the roots are distinct integers, we can choose the roots such that their product is either 33 or -33, and then the degree n is determined by the number of roots. So, the number of roots is n, so the number of factors in the product is n. Therefore, the number of roots must be at least 1, but since the roots are distinct, the minimal number of roots would be 1, but then the product would be 33 or -33, but let's see.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"roots are distinct integers\", so the polynomial must have n distinct integer roots, so n is the degree. So, the number of roots is exactly n, and they are all distinct integers. So, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, and the roots must be selected from the divisors of 66 (since they must divide 66).

Or, include negative numbers, but in this case, a, b, c are positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a=1, b= -1, c= -1, then d=?\n\nBut no, a, b, c are positive.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another combination.\n\nLet me see, if a=1, b=3, c=11, then d=15, which is not a divisor of 66. So, d=15 invalid.\n\nSimilarly, a=1, b=1, c=33, but duplicates.\n\nSo, seems impossible.\n\nCase 2: one negative, three positives.\n\nRoots are -a, b, c, d. Product is (-a) b c d = -33 ⇒ a b c d =33.\n\nSum is -a + b + c + d =0 ⇒ b + c + d = a.\n\nSince b, c, d are positive, and a is positive, so a must be at least 3 (since b, c, d ≥1). Let's try:\n\na=3, then b + c + d=3. So, possible b=1, c=1, d=1: duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, a=11, then b + c + d=11. So, possible b=1, c"

Suppose we have four roots with product 33 and sum 6.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose roots are -1, -2, 3, 11. But 2 is not a divisor of 33, so product would be even, which can't be 33.\n\nAlternatively, -1, -3, 2, 11: same problem.\n\nAlternatively, -1, -1, 3, 11: duplicates.\n\nHmm, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe with 6 as a root? But 6 is a divisor of 66, but 6 doesn't divide 33. So, if I include 6, then the product would be 6 times something equals 33, but 33/6 is not integer. So, can't.\n\nAlternatively, 11 is a root, so maybe 11 and -1 and -3 and something else?\n\nWait, let's try { -1, -3, 11, 1}: product is (-1)(-3)(11)(1)=33. Sum is -1 -3 +11 +1=8. So, that's four roots with sum 8. Not better than 7.\n\nAlternatively, { -1, -3, 11, -1}: duplicates.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, { -1, -3, 11, 0}: but 0 can't be a root because the constant term is 66,"

The roots are distinct integers, which must be divisors of 66. Using Vieta's formulas, the coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) is related to the sum of the roots.\n\n1. **Rational Root Theorem**: The possible integer roots are \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66 \\).\n\n2. **Vieta's Formula**: The coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) is \\( -2 \\) times the sum of the roots. Thus, minimizing \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) requires minimizing \\( | \\)sum of roots\\( | \\).\n\n3. **Product of Roots**: The product of the roots (considering the leading coefficient) must equal 33 or -33. This is derived from the constant term 66.\n\n4. **Finding Root Sets**: We look for sets of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33 and whose sum is minimized. Key sets found:\n   - For product 33: \\( \\{-1, -3, 11\\} \\) with sum 7.\n   - For product -33: \\( \\{1, 3, -11\\} \\) with sum -7.\n\n5. **Minimal Sum**: The smallest absolute sum is 7, achieved by both sets.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The minimal \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) is \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\).\n\n**Answer**: The least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) is \\boxed{14}."
