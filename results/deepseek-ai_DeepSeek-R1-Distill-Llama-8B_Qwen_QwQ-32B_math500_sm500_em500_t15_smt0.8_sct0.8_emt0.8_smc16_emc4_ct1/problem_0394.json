The volume is provided as 45π cubic centimeters, and the radius r is given as 3 centimeters.\n\nWith the values known, I substitute them into the volume formula: 45π = π(3)²h.\n\nSimplifying the equation, I calculate 3 squared, which is 9. This gives me 45π = 9πh.\n\nTo solve for h, I divide both sides of the equation by π, which cancels out, leaving 45 = 9h.\n\nFinally, I divide both sides by 9 to find the height: h = 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo find the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder when the volume is given, we'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Given:**\n\n- Volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters\n- Radius \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters\n\n**Step 1:** Plug the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation.\n\\[\n45\\pi = 9\\pi h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\pi \\) to solve for \\( h \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Divide both sides by 9 to find the height \\( h \\).\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
