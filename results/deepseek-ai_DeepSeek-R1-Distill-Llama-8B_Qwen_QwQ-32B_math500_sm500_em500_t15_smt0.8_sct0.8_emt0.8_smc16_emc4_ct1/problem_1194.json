The terms with k are -k and 3k, and the constant terms are 4 and -2.\n\nCombining the k terms: -k + 3k equals 2k.\n\nCombining the constants: 4 - 2 equals 2.\n\nFinally, combining these results, the simplified expression is 2k + 2.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\( (-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k) \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Remove the parentheses** (since there are no coefficients that would change the signs):\n   \\[\n   -k + 4 - 2 + 3k\n   \\]\n\n2. **Combine like terms**:\n   - **Terms with \\(k\\)**: \\( -k + 3k = 2k \\)\n   - **Constant terms**: \\( 4 - 2 = 2 \\)\n\n3. **Write the simplified expression**:\n   \\[\n   2k + 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2k + 2}\n\\]"
