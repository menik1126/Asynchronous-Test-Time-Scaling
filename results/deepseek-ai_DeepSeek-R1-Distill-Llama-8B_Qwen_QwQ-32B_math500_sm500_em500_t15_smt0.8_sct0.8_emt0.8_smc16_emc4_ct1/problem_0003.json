            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about polynomials, and I need to figure out how to solve it step by step. Let me try to understand what's given and what's being asked.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So, P(x) looks like x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants that we might need to find.\n\nNext, it mentions that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So, R(x) is some polynomial, and depending on the divisor, the remainder changes.\n\nWe also know that P(0) = 5. Since P(x) is x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, plugging in x=0 gives us c = 5. So, c is 5. That's one coefficient down.\n\nThe goal is to find P(5). So, once we know the coefficients a, b, c, we can compute P(5).\n\nLet me try to write down what I know:\n\n1. P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + 5 (since c=5)\n2. When P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x).\n3. When P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x).\n4. Need to find P(5).\n\nI think I can use the Remainder Theorem here. The theorem states that the remainder of a polynomial P(x) divided by a linear divisor (x - k) is P(k). But in this case, the divisors are quadratic, so the remainder should be of lower degree. Since both divisors are quadratic, the remainders R(x) must be linear polynomials or constants. But the problem specifies R(x) as the remainder, so R(x) should be a linear polynomial, right? So, R(x) = dx + e for some constants d and e.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\n- When P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is"

            "output": " R(x) = dx + e.\n- When divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x) = 2dx + 2e.\n\nNow, using the division algorithm for polynomials, we can write:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nand\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nwhere Q1(x) and Q2(x) are the quotients, which are polynomials of degree 1 since P(x) is degree 3 and the divisors are degree 2.\n\nSince both expressions equal P(x), they must be equal to each other:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nHmm, but maybe instead of dealing with the quotients, it's better to use the fact that the remainder when divided by a quadratic is determined by the values at the roots. Since (x - 1)(x - 4) has roots at x=1 and x=4, then the remainder R(x) must satisfy R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, the remainder when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3) is 2R(x), so 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3).\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. Let me think again.\n\nYes, the Remainder Factor Theorem for higher degree divisors says that if you divide a polynomial P(x) by a quadratic (x - a)(x - b), the remainder R(x) is a linear polynomial (since degree less than 2), and R(a) = P(a), R(b) = P(b). Similarly, if you divide by another quadratic, the remainder evaluated at its roots gives the value of P at those roots.\n\nSo, applying that here:\n\nFor the first division by (x - 1)(x - 4):\n\n- The remainder R(x) is linear, so R(x) = dx + e.\n\n- Then, R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4).\n\n"
