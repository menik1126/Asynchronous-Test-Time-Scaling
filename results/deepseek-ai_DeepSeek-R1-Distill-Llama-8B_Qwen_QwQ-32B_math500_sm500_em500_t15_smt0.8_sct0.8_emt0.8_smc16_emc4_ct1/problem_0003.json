            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial problem, and I need to find P(5). Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so P(x) should look something like x³ + ax² + bx + c. But I don't know the coefficients a, b, or c yet. The problem gives me some information about remainders when P(x) is divided by certain quadratic polynomials.\n\nIt says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is a quadratic, the remainder is R(x). Then, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So, R(x) is the remainder when dividing by one quadratic and twice that when dividing by another quadratic.\n\nAlso, I know that P(0) = 5. Since P(0) is the constant term c, that means c = 5. So, our polynomial is P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + 5.\n\nNow, let me think about how polynomial division works. When you divide a polynomial P(x) by a quadratic (x - p)(x - q), the remainder R(x) is a linear polynomial, right? Because the degree of the remainder is less than the divisor. So, R(x) should look like mx + n.\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), which would then be 2(mx + n) = 2m x + 2n. But wait, 2R(x) must also be a linear polynomial because the divisor is quadratic, so that makes sense.\n\nSo, from the division, I can write two equations based on the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial P(x) is divided by (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But in this case, the divisor is quadratic, so the remainder is when evaluated at the roots of the divisor.\n\nSpecifically, for the first division by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder R(x) must satisfy R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4)."

If we divide P(x) by (x - a)(x - b), then the remainder R(x) is a linear polynomial such that R(a) = P(a) and R(b) = P(b). So yes, that's correct. So, for the first case, R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). For the second case, since the remainder is 2R(x), then 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3).\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations based on these equalities. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote R(x) = m x + n. Then:\n\n1. R(1) = m(1) + n = P(1)\n2. R(4) = m(4) + n = P(4)\n3. 2R(2) = 2(m(2) + n) = P(2)\n4. 2R(3) = 2(m(3) + n) = P(3)\n\nSo, equations 1, 2, 3, 4 relate the values of P at 1, 2, 3, 4 to the coefficients m and n of R(x). But also, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, we can express P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) in terms of a, b, and c (which is 5). Let me write expressions for each of these.\n\nFirst, let's compute P(1):\n\nP(1) = (1)^3 + a(1)^2 + b(1) + 5 = 1 + a + b + 5 = a + b + 6\n\nSimilarly, P(4):\n\nP(4) = 4³ + a(4²) + b(4) + 5 = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 16a + 4b + 69\n\nP(2):\n\nP(2) = "
