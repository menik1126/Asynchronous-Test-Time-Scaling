The first term is 0, and each subsequent term alternates between adding the next integer and multiplying by the next integer, starting with 1.\n\nLet me list out the initial terms to see the pattern:\n- Term 1: 0\n- Term 2: 0 + 1 = 1\n- Term 3: 1 * 1 = 1\n- Term 4: 1 + 2 = 3\n- Term 5: 3 * 2 = 6\n- Term 6: 6 + 3 = 9\n- Term 7: 9 * 3 = 27\n- Term 8: 27 + 4 = 31\n- Term 9: 31 * 4 = 124\n- Term 10: 124 + 5 = 129\n\nNow, I need to find the first term that exceeds 125. From the list, Term 10 is 129, which is greater than 125. Therefore, the answer is 129.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to find the first term that exceeds 125.\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:**\n   - The sequence starts with **Term 1 = 0**.\n   - Starting from **Term 2**, each term is produced by alternately:\n     - **Adding** the next integer (starting from 1) to the previous term.\n     - **Multiplying** by the next integer (starting from 1).\n\n2. **Calculating the Terms:**\n   - **Term 1:** 0\n   - **Term 2:** 0 + 1 = **1**\n   - **Term 3:** 1 × 1 = **1**\n   - **Term 4:** 1 + 2 = **3**\n   - **Term 5:** 3 × 2 = **6**\n   - **Term 6:** 6 + 3 = **9**\n   - **Term 7:** 9 × 3 = **27**\n   - **Term 8:** 27 + 4 = **31**\n   - **Term 9:** 31 × 4 = **124**\n   - **Term 10:** 124 + 5 = **129**\n\n3. **Finding the First Term Greater Than 125:**\n   - From"
