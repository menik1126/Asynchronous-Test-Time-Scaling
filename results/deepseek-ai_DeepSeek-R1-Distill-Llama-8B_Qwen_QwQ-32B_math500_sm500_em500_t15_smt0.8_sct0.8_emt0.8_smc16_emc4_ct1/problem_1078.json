The rule states that subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer starting from 1.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Term 1: 0\n2.

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
