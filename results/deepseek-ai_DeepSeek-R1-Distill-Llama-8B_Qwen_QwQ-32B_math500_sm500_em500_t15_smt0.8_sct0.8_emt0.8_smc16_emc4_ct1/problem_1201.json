Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that the direction vector of a line can be found by taking the difference between the coordinates of two points on that line. In the problem, there is an Asymptote figure provided, but I can't visualize it directly. However, the code might give some clues. Let me parse the Asymptote code a bit.\n\nLooking at the code, I see that points A and B are defined as (-5,4) and (-1,3), respectively. Then, points L and R are calculated using the extension function, which likely finds the intersection points of the line AB with the vertical lines \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\), respectively. \n\nSo, the line passes through points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3). To find the direction vector, I can subtract the coordinates of point A from point B. That should give me the direction vector of the line.\n\nCalculating that, point B minus point A: \n- The x-coordinate: \\( -1 - (-5) = -1 + 5 = 4 \\)\n- The y-coordinate: \\( 3 - 4 = -1 \\)\n\nSo, the direction vector from A to B is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Wait, but the problem states that the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). That seems different from what I just calculated. Maybe I made a mistake or perhaps the direction vector in the problem is pointing in the opposite direction.\n\nIf I reverse the direction vector I found, it would be \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is still not \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, so something's not adding up here.\n\nLet me think. Maybe the line isn't just defined by points A and B but also extends beyond them, as seen in the Asymptote code where L and R are found by extending the line to meet"

But the direction vector should still be consistent along the entire line. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction vector given in the problem is a scalar multiple of the direction vector I found. Since direction vectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, maybe \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nLet me check that. Let's suppose there exists a scalar \\( k \\) such that:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = k \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThis gives two equations:\n1. \\( -7 = 4k \\)\n2. \\( b = -k \\)\n\nSolving the first equation for \\( k \\):\n\\( k = -7 / 4 \\)\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\\( b = -(-7/4) = 7/4 \\)\n\nWait, so \\( b = 7/4 \\)? Let me verify this. If the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ 7/4 \\end{pmatrix} \\), then scaling the original direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) by \\( -7/4 \\) would give:\n\n\\( 4 * (-7/4) = -7 \\), and \\( -1 * (-7/4) = 7/4 \\). That works. So the direction vector given in the problem is just a scaled version of the direction vector between points A and B. \n\nTherefore, the value of \\( b \\) should be \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\). \n\nBut let me double-check everything again to be sure. The line passes through points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3). The direction vector from A to B is indeed (4, -1). The problem's direction vector is (-7, b). Since direction vectors can be scaled, we can set up the proportion between the components. \n\nThe x-component of the given direction vector is -7, which is -7/4 times the original x-component of 4. So the scaling factor is -7/4. Applying"

So yes, \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the slope of the line AB and see if that corresponds with the slope implied by the direction vector given.\n\nSlope \\( m \\) is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (3 - 4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4.\n\nThe direction vector given has a slope of \\( b / (-7) \\). So, setting these equal:\n\n\\( b / (-7) = -1 / 4 \\)\nMultiply both sides by (-7):\n\\( b = (-7) * (-1/4) = 7/4 \\)\n\nYes, that's another way to see it and confirms that \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nHence, I'm confident that the value of \\( b \\) is \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine \\( b \\), we first find the direction vector of the line passing through points \\( A(-5, 4) \\) and \\( B(-1, 3) \\).
