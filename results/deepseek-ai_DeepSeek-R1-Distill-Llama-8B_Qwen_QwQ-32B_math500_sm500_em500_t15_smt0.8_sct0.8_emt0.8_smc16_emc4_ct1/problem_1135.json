            "output": "First, I need to determine the speed of the robot. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. Since 1 kilometer is 1000 meters, the distance in meters is 1000 meters, and the time taken is 2.5 hours. Speed is calculated by dividing distance by time, so the robot's speed is 1000 meters divided by 2.5 hours, which equals 400 meters per hour.\n\nNext, I'll use the speed of 400 meters per hour to find the length of the hallway. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway's length. Converting 90 seconds to hours gives 1.5 hours. Multiplying the speed by this time, 400 meters per hour multiplied by 1.5 hours, results in 600 meters.\n\nFinally, the hallway is 600 meters long.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n- The robot travels the length of a hallway in 90 seconds.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Robot's Speed**\n\nFirst, we'll calculate the robot's speed.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n\\]\n\nThe robot travels 1 kilometer, which is 1000 meters, in 2.5 hours.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}} = 400 \\text{ meters/hour}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Length of the Hallway**\n\nThe robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway's length. Convert 90 seconds to hours:\n\n\\[\n90 \\text{ seconds} = \\frac{90}{60} \\text{ hours} = 1.5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, use the speed to find the distance (length of the hallway):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 400 \\text{ meters/hour} \\times 1.5 \\text{ hours} = 600 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{600}\n\\]"
