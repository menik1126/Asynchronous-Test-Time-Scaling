I need to find the number of different possible rational roots this polynomial could have. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember something called the Rational Root Theorem. I think it has to do with possible roots of polynomials with integer coefficients. Let me try to recall the specifics. Oh yeah, the theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, must satisfy that p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. So, applying the Rational Root Theorem, p must be a factor of 1 and q must be a factor of 2. \n\nFactors of 1 are just ±1, right? Because 1 times 1 is 1 and (-1) times (-1) is also 1. So p can only be 1 or -1.\n\nFactors of 2 are 1 and 2, so q can be 1 or 2. That means the possible rational roots are ±1/1 and ±1/2.\n\nLet me list them out: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That's four possible rational roots. Are there any others? Well, since the constant term is 1, we don't have to consider other factors like 2 or -2 for p because 1 is the only factor. So, yeah, the possible rational roots are limited to these four.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I applied the theorem correctly. The constant term is 1, so p has to divide 1, which only allows ±1. The leading coefficient is 2, so q can be ±1 or ±2, but since we're considering q in the denominator, it's just 1 and 2. Therefore, each p over each q gives the possible roots. So 1/1 is 1, 1/2 is 0.5, -1/1 is -1, and -1/2 is -0.5. Yep, that's four roots.\n\nI don't think I missed any."

            "output": " Even if the coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁ are any integers, the possible rational roots are constrained by the constant term and the leading coefficient. Since the coefficients can vary, all the possible rational roots from the theorem are still valid possibilities. The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots, so even if not all of them can be achieved by some coefficients, the possible ones are still these four. Wait, maybe some of these can't actually be roots because of the way the coefficients are set?\n\nHmm. Let me think. Suppose the polynomial actually has one of these roots. For example, suppose x=1 is a root. Then plugging into the polynomial: 2(1)^4 + a₃(1)^3 + a₂(1)^2 + a₁(1) + 1 = 0. That simplifies to 2 + a₃ + a₂ + a₁ +1 = 0, so a₃ + a₂ + a₁ = -3. Since a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers, this is possible. For instance, if a₃ =0, a₂=0, a₁=-3, that works. So 1 is a possible root.\n\nSimilarly, if x=-1 is a root, plugging in gives 2(-1)^4 + a₃(-1)^3 + a₂(-1)^2 +a₁(-1) +1 =0. That's 2(1) + a₃(-1) +a₂(1) +a₁(-1)+1 =0 => 2 -a₃ +a₂ -a₁ +1 =0 => -a₃ -a₁ + a₂ = -3. Again, that's an integer equation, so there must exist integers that satisfy this. So possible.\n\nTesting x=1/2: Let me substitute x=1/2 into the equation. Then,\n\n2*(1/2)^4 + a₃*(1/2)^3 + a₂*(1/2)^2 +a₁*(1/2) +1 =0.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8,\n\na₃*(1/8),\n\na₂*(1/4),\n\na₁*(1/2),\n\nplus 1.\n\nSo adding all up: 1/8 + a"
