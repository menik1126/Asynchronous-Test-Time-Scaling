I need to find the number of different possible rational roots. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nI remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me recall what that says. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, has p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient. That makes sense. So for my polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2.\n\nAlright, so the possible values for p are the factors of 1. Since 1 is a prime, its factors are just 1 and -1. For q, the factors of 2 are 1 and 2. Therefore, the possible rational roots are p/q, which in this case would be \u00b11/1 and \u00b11/2. So let me list those out: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nWait, are there any duplicates? No, each one is unique. So that gives me four possible rational roots. Let me check if I did that correctly. p is \u00b11, q is \u00b11 and \u00b12, but when simplifying, the denominators can't be negative because we can just take the absolute value. So, yeah, only 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nIs there any other possible rational root that I might have missed? Let me think. Since the leading coefficient is 2 and the constant term is 1, those are all the possibilities. So, four possible different rational roots.\n\nWait another thing, actually, when p/q is in lowest terms, so q can't have any common factors with p. But in this case, p is 1 or -1, which don't have any common factors except 1. So, all the possible roots are indeed 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2. So, that's four different possible rational roots.\n\nHmm, let me see if I can list them: first, factors of the constant term (1) are 1 and -1. Divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (2), which are 1"

Well, plugging in x=0, the equation becomes 2*(0)^4 + ... +1 = 1 =0, which isn't true, so 0 is not a root. So that's not a possibility. \n\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are the four I listed. But the question is about the number of different possible rational roots. Wait a second, but do all of these necessarily exist? Or are there some that can't be roots depending on coefficients?\n\nWait, the question isn't asking for the number of rational roots the polynomial can have in total, but the number of different possible rational roots. So each of these four could potentially be a root for some choice of a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081, as long as they are integers. \n\nSo, for example, if there exists a polynomial of the given form where 1 is a root, then 1 counts. Similarly for the others. So we have to check if each of those four could indeed be a root for some integer coefficients.\n\nLet me test with each candidate:\n\nFirst, let's test x = 1. Let's suppose x=1 is a root. Then substituting into the polynomial:\n\n2(1)^4 +a\u2083(1)^3 + a\u2082(1)^2 +a\u2081(1) +1 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to 2 + a\u2083 + a\u2082 + a\u2081 +1 =0 \u2192 a\u2083 +a\u2082 +a\u2081 = -3. Since a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081 are integers, there are definitely solutions here. For instance, a\u2083=0, a\u2082=0, a\u2081=-3. So that's possible. Therefore, x=1 can be a root.\n\nSimilarly, x = -1:\n\n2(-1)^4 +a\u2083(-1)^3 +a\u2082(-1)^2 +a\u2081(-1) +1 =0\n\nCalculates to 2(1) + (-a\u2083)(1) + a\u2082(1) + (-a\u2081) +1 =0 \u2192 2 -a\u2083 +"

For example, set a\u2083=0, a\u2082=0, -a\u2081= -3 \u2192 a\u2081=3.\n\nThus, x=-1 can also be a root.\n\nNow, x=1/2. Let's see if this can be a root.\n\nSubstituting x=1/2 into the polynomial:\n\n2*(1/2)^4 +a\u2083*(1/2)^3 +a\u2082*(1/2)^2 +a\u2081*(1/2) +1 =0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\n\na\u2083*(1/8) = a\u2083/8\n\na\u2082*(1/4) = a\u2082/4\n\na\u2081*(1/2) = a\u2081/2\n\nPlus 1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1/8 + a\u2083/8 + a\u2082/4 + a\u2081/2 +1 = 0\n\nMultiply everything by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 +4a\u2081 +8 =0 \u2192 a\u2083 +2a\u2082 +4a\u2081 = -9\n\nSo, a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 + 4a\u2081 = -9. Since a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081 are integers, we can choose coefficients so that this holds. For example, let a\u2083= -1, a\u2082= 0, then we have -1 + 0 +4a\u2081 = -9 \u2192 4a\u2081 = -8 \u2192 a\u2081= -2. So set a\u2083=-1, a\u2082=0, a\u2081=-2. Then 1/2 would be a root. So x=1/2 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, testing x=-1/2:\n\n2*(-1/2)^4 +a\u2083*(-1/2)^3 +a\u2082*(-1/2)^2 +a\u2081*(-1/2) +1=0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*(1/16) =1/8\n\na\u2083*(-1/8) = -a\u2083/8\n\na\u2082*(1/4) = a\u2082/4\n\na\u2081*(-1/2) = -a\u2081/2\n\nPlus 1"

Using the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. The factors of 1 are \u00b11, and the factors of 2 are \u00b11 and \u00b12, leading to possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. Each of these can be a root for some choice of integer coefficients, giving four distinct possible rational roots.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{4}"
