            "output": "First, I need to determine the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay. Let's denote Denali's pay as P_D and Nate's pay as P_N. Since they are paid per dog, the ratio of their pay can be represented as P_D / P_N.\n\nDenali is responsible for 16 dogs, and Nate is responsible for 12 dogs. Therefore, the initial ratio of their pay would be 16/12, which simplifies to 4/3.\n\nNow, let's consider the first scenario where Denali starts walking 4x more dogs, making her total dogs 16 + 4x, while Nate's number of dogs remains 12. The ratio of their pay in this case would be (16 + 4x)/12.\n\nIn the second scenario, x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. This means Denali now has 16 + x dogs, and Nate has 12 - x dogs. The ratio of their pay in this case would be (16 + x)/(12 - x).\n\nSince the ratios remain the same in both scenarios, I can set them equal to each other:\n\n(16 + 4x)/12 = (16 + x)/(12 - x)\n\nNext, I'll solve this equation to find the value of x. Cross-multiplying gives me (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = (16 + x)(12). Expanding both sides:\n\n16*12 - 16x + 48x - 4x² = 192 + 12x\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n192 + 32x - 4x² = 192 + 12x\n\nSubtracting 192 from both sides:\n\n32x - 4x² = 12x\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n-4x² + 20x = 0\n\nFactoring out x:\n\nx(-4x + 20) = 0\n\nThis gives two possible solutions: x = 0 or x = 5. Since x ≠ 0, the value we're looking for is x = 5.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks **16 dogs**.\n- Nate walks **12 dogs**.\n- The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same in two scenarios:\n  1. Denali walks **4x** more dogs ("
