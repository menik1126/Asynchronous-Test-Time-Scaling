Let \\( x \\) represent the number of dogs that are reassigned at a time.\n\nDenali is initially responsible for 16 dogs, and Nate is responsible for 12 dogs. Their payments are proportional to the number of dogs they walk.\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali starts walking \\( 4x \\) more dogs while Nate stays at 12 dogs. This means Denali's new number of dogs is \\( 16 + 4x \\), and Nate's remains at 12.\n\nIn the second scenario, \\( x \\) dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali. So Denali's new number becomes \\( 16 + x \\), and Nate's decreases to \\( 12 - x \\).\n\nSince the pay ratio remains the same in both scenarios, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation will help solve for \\( x \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali initially walks **16 dogs**.\n- Nate initially walks **12 dogs**.\n- The company reassigns or unassigns dogs **in groups of \\( x \\) dogs**.\n- The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same under two different scenarios.\n\n**Let's denote:**\n- \\( x \\) = number of dogs in a group (the variable we need to find).\n\n---\n\n### **Scenario 1: Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, Nate stays at 12 dogs**\n- **Denali's new number of dogs:** \\( 16 + 4x \\)\n- **Nate's number of dogs:** **12** (no change)\n- **Pay ratio:** \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Scenario 2: \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali**\n- **Denali's new number of dogs:** \\( 16 + x \\)\n- **Nate's new number of dogs:** \\( 12 - x \\)\n- **Pay ratio:** \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\)\n\n---\n\nSince the **pay ratio remains the same** in both scenarios, we can set the two ratios equal to each other:\n\n\\"

    "question": "Denali and Nate work for a dog walking business and are paid for each dog they walk. Denali is responsible for $16$ dogs and Nate is responsible for $12$ dogs. Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali. Find $x$ if $x\\neq0$."
