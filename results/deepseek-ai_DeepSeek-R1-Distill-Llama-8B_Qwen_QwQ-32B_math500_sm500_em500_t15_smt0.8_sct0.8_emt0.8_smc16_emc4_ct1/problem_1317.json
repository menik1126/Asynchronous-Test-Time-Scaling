            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the rectangle. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The center of the rectangle is O. The Asymptote code shows that the rectangle is drawn with coordinates from (-250,100) to (250,100) to (250,-100) to (-250,-100) and back to (-250,100). So, the rectangle is 500 units long (from -250 to 250 on the x-axis) and 200 units tall (from -100 to 100 on the y-axis). But in the problem, it's given that AB/AD = k. Maybe I should denote AB as the length and AD as the width. So AB is the length, which is 2 times the x-coordinate, and AD is the width, which is 2 times the y-coordinate. Wait, or actually, since in the Asymptote code, AB is from (-250,100) to (250,100), which is 500 units, and AD is from (-250,100) to (-250,-100), which is 200 units. So AB is 500, AD is 200, so AB/AD is 500/200 = 2.5, so k would be 2.5.\n\nBut maybe I should abstract away from the specific numbers and just use variables. Let's denote AB = 2a and AD = 2b. Then the center O would be at (0,0), right? Because the rectangle is centered at O. So the rectangle spans from (-a, -b) to (a, b). So any point inside the rectangle has coordinates (x, y), where |x| ≤ a and |y| ≤ b.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the probability that a random point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. So the four vertices are A, B, C, D. Let me write down their coordinates:\n\n- A: (-a, b)\n- B: (a, b)\n- C: (a, -b)\n-"

But since we're comparing distances, I can square both sides to make the inequalities easier to handle without worrying about the square root.\n\nSo the distance to O squared is x² + y².\n\nThe distance to A squared is (x + a)² + (y - b)².\n\nSimilarly, distance to B squared is (x - a)² + (y - b)².\n\nDistance to C squared is (x - a)² + (y + b)².\n\nDistance to D squared is (x + a)² + (y + b)².\n\nSo, I need the region where:\n\nx² + y² < (x + a)² + (y - b)²,\n\nx² + y² < (x - a)² + (y - b)²,\n\nx² + y² < (x - a)² + (y + b)²,\n\nand\n\nx² + y² < (x + a)² + (y + b)².\n\nThese four inequalities define the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex. Solving each inequality will give me the boundaries, and the intersection of these regions will be the area where all four inequalities are satisfied. Then, the probability will be the area of this region divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nLet me start by solving one of the inequalities, say the first one: x² + y² < (x + a)² + (y - b)².\n\nExpanding the right-hand side: (x + a)² + (y - b)² = x² + 2a x + a² + y² - 2b y + b².\n\nSo the inequality becomes:\n\nx² + y² < x² + 2a x + a² + y² - 2b y + b².\n\nSimplify by subtracting x² + y² from both sides:\n\n"

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to set coordinates such that the rectangle is centered at the origin with sides of length 2a and 2b, so coordinates from (-a, -b) to (a, b). Then, the problem is to find the region where the distance to (0,0) is less than the distance to each vertex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use coordinate system where the rectangle has sides of length 2 and 2k, so that the ratio AB/AD = k. Wait, but maybe even better to set specific coordinates for simplicity.\n\nLet me consider setting the rectangle with sides of length 2a and 2b, so that the center is at (0,0), and the vertices are at (a, b), (-a, b), etc. Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is drawn with coordinates from (-250,100) to (250,100), so the length along the x-axis is 500, so 2a = 500, so a = 250, and the height is 200, so 2b = 200, so b = 100. So in that case, the ratio AB/AD is (500)/(200) = 2.5, so k = 2.5. But in the problem, the ratio is given as k, so perhaps we can let AB = 2a, AD = 2b, so that AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k, so a = k*b. So, we can set b as 1, then a = k, so the rectangle has dimensions 2k by 2. That might simplify calculations.\n\nAlternatively, let me set the rectangle with length 2 and width 2/k, so that the ratio AB/AD = (2)/(2/k) = k. Hmm, maybe that's better. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define the rectangle with center at (0,0), with length along the x-axis as 2a and along the y-axis as 2b. Then, AB is the length, so AB = 2a, and AD is the width, so AD = 2b. Therefore,"

Similarly, y = -k x + c and y = -k x - c are parallel.\n\nBut the other intersections are:\n\nBetween y = k x + c and y = -k x - c.\n\nSet k x + c = -k x - c,\n\nso 2k x = -2c,\n\nx = -c/k,\n\ny = (-k x - c) = (-k*(-c/k) - c) = c - c = 0.\n\nWait, let me compute y:\n\nIf x = -c/k,\n\nthen y = k*(-c/k) + c = -c + c = 0.\n\nSo, point (-c/k, 0).\n\nSimilarly, between y = -k x + c and y = k x - c.\n\nSet -k x + c = k x - c,\n\n-2k x"

So the area would be the area of the diamond, which is (2c)*(2c/k)/2 = (2*1)*(2*1/1)/2 = (2)*(2)/2=2. The rectangle area is 2*2=4,"

The vertices are \\(A(-a, b)\\), \\(B(a, b)\\), \\(C(a, -b)\\), and \\(D(-a, -b)\\). Given \\(AB/AD = k\\), we have \\(a/b = k\\), so \\(a = kb\\).\n\n2. **Distance Inequalities**: For a point \\((x, y)\\) to be closer to \\(O\\) than any vertex, it must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \\sqrt{(x \\pm a)^2 + (y \\mp b)^2}\n   \\]\n   Squaring and simplifying each inequality leads to four linear inequalities defining a diamond-shaped region centered at \\(O\\).\n\n3. **Diamond Vertices**: The diamond's vertices are at \\((0, c)\\), \\((c/k, 0)\\), \\((0, -c)\\), and \\((-c/k, 0)\\), where \\(c = \\frac{k^2 + 1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Intersection with Rectangle**: The diamond may extend beyond the rectangle. However, calculating the area within the rectangle for any \\(k\\) shows symmetry and equal partitioning of the rectangle's area.\n\n5. **Area Calculation**: The region closer to \\(O\\) forms a symmetrical shape occupying exactly half the rectangle's area, regardless of \\(k\\). This is confirmed by evaluating specific cases (e.g., \\(k = 1\\)) and generalizing.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}\n\\]"
