            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². So ω can be any of these three values. That means the expression might have different values depending on whether ω is 1, ω, or ω².\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So ω³ = 1, but ω ≠ 1? Because sometimes roots of unity can be considered different even if they're equal, but in this case, since ω is a cube root, we have exactly three distinct roots: 1, ω, and ω². So actually, ω can be 1, ω, or ω². So I need to consider each case separately.\n\nLet me start by considering each case:\n\nCase 1: ω = 1\nThen, plugging into the expression, we get 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1²) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nCase 2: ω = ω (the non-real cube root)\nSimilarly, ω² would be the other non-real root. So let's compute the expression for ω.\n\nSo, first, let's compute 1 + ω. If ω is a non-real cube root of unity, then 1 + ω is some complex number. Let me recall that for cube roots of unity, we have the property that 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That could be useful here.\n\nSince 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we can express 1 + ω as -ω², right? Because if 1 + ω = -ω², then 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(-ω²) = -1/ω². Similarly, 1/(1 + ω²) would be? Let me think: Since 1 + ω² = -ω, because again, 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so 1 + ω² = -ω. Therefore, 1/(1 + ω²)"

            "output": " is 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes -1/ω² - 1/ω. Let's combine these terms. To add them, we can get a common denominator. The denominators are ω² and ω, so the common denominator is ω². So:\n\n-1/ω² - 1/ω = -1/ω² - (ω)/ω² = (-1 - ω)/ω².\n\nHmm, but maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since we know that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω² = -1 - ω. Maybe substituting that in?\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the sum:\n\n-1/ω² -1/ω = - (1/ω² + 1/ω). Let me factor out the negative sign. Let's compute 1/ω + 1/ω². Let's see:\n\n1/ω + 1/ω² = (ω + 1)/ω². Wait, but since 1 + ω + ω² =0, so 1 + ω = -ω². Therefore, substituting that in, (1 + ω)/ω² = (-ω²)/ω² = -1. Therefore, 1/ω + 1/ω² = -1. Therefore, the original expression is - (1/ω + 1/ω²) = -(-1) = 1? Wait, hold on, let me check that again.\n\nWait, the original expression was -1/ω² -1/ω, which is equal to - (1/ω + 1/ω²). Then, if 1/ω + 1/ω² = -1, then the total expression would be -(-1) = 1. Wait, so that would mean that when ω is a primitive cube root of unity, the expression is also 1? But that contradicts my initial thought that maybe it would be different. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recast this. Let me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1/(1 + ω). Since 1 + ω = -ω², so 1/("

Let's compute this.\n\nWe can write this as - (1/ω + 1/ω²). Let's find 1/ω + 1/ω².\n\nI know that ω³ =1, so 1/ω = ω² and 1/ω² = ω.\n\nSo, 1/ω + 1/ω² = ω² + ω. But from the equation 1 + ω + ω² = 0, ω + ω² = -1.\n\nTherefore, 1/ω + 1/ω² = ω² + ω = -1. Therefore, the expression is - (-1) = 1.\n\nWait, so regardless of ω being 1, ω, or ω², the expression always equals 1? That seems strange because if I plug in ω =1, I get 1/(1+1) + 1/(1+1) = 1/2 +1/2 =1. If I plug in ω, which is a primitive cube root of unity, we just saw it also gives 1. What about ω²? Since the roots come in pairs, so ω² would behave similarly to ω in terms of being a primitive root.\n\nWait, but let me check with ω². Let me make sure.\n\nIf ω² is the other root, then 1 + ω² = -ω, as before. So 1/(1 + ω²) = -1/ω.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²) is the same as -1/ω, as before.\n\nSo, again, the sum is -1/ω² -1/ω, which is - (1/ω² + 1/ω). As we saw, this is equal to 1.\n\nSo, regardless of whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root of unity, the expression always equals 1. So the only possible value is 1.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Is there another way to compute this? Maybe by combining the fractions.\n\nLet"

The numerator would be (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes (2 + ω + ω²)/[(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].\n\nNow, let's compute numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, numerator: 2 + ω + ω². Since 1 + ω + ω² =0, so ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, numerator is 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nDenominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand this:\n\n(1)(1) + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω².\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1*1 =1,\n\n1*ω² = ω²,\n\nω*1 = ω,\n\nω*ω² = ω³. But ω³ =1, so that term is 1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is 1 + ω² + ω +1 = (1 +1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (ω + ω²). Again, since ω + ω² = -1, so denominator is 2 + (-1) =1.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is numerator/denominator = 1/1 =1.\n\nSo that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is (except maybe when ω is 1?), but even when ω is 1, the expression is 1. Wait, when ω is 1, let's check the denominator:\n\nWait, if ω =1, then the denominator (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) would be (1 +1)(1 +1²)=2*2=4. Wait, but in the previous calculation, when we substituted ω=1, the numerator would be 2 +1 +1² = 2 +1 +1=4, so 4/4=1. So that still works. Wait, but"

            "output": " in the earlier approach, when I considered the combined fraction, I got numerator as (2 + ω + ω²)=1, denominator=1, but when ω=1, that approach didn't hold because in that case, the numerator becomes 2 +1 +1=4, but the denominator becomes (1+1)(1 +1)=4, so 4/4=1. So maybe that approach is only valid when ω is not equal to 1, but when ω=1, we have to compute separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Wait, when I considered ω, the non-real root, and ω², then 1 + ω = -ω² and 1 + ω² = -ω, but when ω=1, that's not the case because 1 +1=2, and 1 +1²=2. So when ω=1, both denominators become 2, so the expression is 1/2 +1/2=1.\n\nWait, but in the approach where I combined the fractions, to get (2 + ω + ω²)/[(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)], let me see: when ω=1, this becomes (2 +1 +1)/[(1 +1)(1 +1)]=(4)/(4)=1, so it works.\n\nBut wait, when ω is not equal to 1, so 1 + ω² = -ω, as before, and 1 + ω = -ω², so (1 + ω)(1 + ω²)= (-ω²)(-ω)= ω³=1. So when ω is a primitive cube root, (1 + ω)(1 + ω²)=1, and the numerator is 2 + ω + ω²=1. So 1/1=1.\n\nSo, whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root, the expression is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but I just wanted to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me try plugging in specific values.\n\nLet me take ω = (-1 + i√3)/2, which is one of the primitive cube roots of unity.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω).

Since ω² is the conjugate of ω, so ω² = (-1 - i√3)/2.\n\nTherefore, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1 -i√3)/2 = (2 -1 -i√3)/2 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nThus, 1/(1 + ω²) = 2/(1 - i√3).

Therefore, even with the complex roots, the expression is 1. So the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all possible values\". Since ω can be any cube root of unity, but in all cases, the expression evaluates to 1, so the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nHmm, but let me check once more. Suppose someone might think that when ω is 1, the expression is 1, but when ω is a primitive root, maybe it's different? But as shown above, even with ω being the complex root, it still gives 1. So yeah, the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven a complex number \\(\\omega\\) such that \\(\\omega^3 = "
