I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, the possible values of ω are the primitive cube roots of unity. I think that means they satisfy ω³ = 1 and ω ≠ 1, which also implies that 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That might come in handy later.\n\nSo, the expression I need to evaluate is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). I wonder if I can simplify each term separately or if there's a smarter way to combine them first.\n\nLet me write down the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nI can try to find a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So, let me compute that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nWait a second, ω³ is 1, so that term becomes 1. So, substituting:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nBut from earlier, I remember that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (-1) = 1. So, the denominator simplifies to 1.\n\nThat means the entire expression is just the numerator:\n\n1 + ω² + ω, but wait, no, actually, when I add the two fractions, the numerator becomes:\n\n1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω) = (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nBut we already know"

            "output": " ω + ω² = -1, so 2 + (-1) = 1. So, the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 1, so the sum is 1.\n\nWait, does that mean the expression is always equal to 1 regardless of which ω we choose? Because ω could be either of the non-real cube roots of unity. Let me check with specific values to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me pick ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2. Then ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nCompute 1 + ω: 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω²: 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2) = (1)/( (1 + i√3)/2 ) = 2/(1 + i√3).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):\n\n2*(1 - i√3)/[(1 + i√3)(1 - i√3)] = 2*(1 - i√3)/(1 + 3) = 2*(1 - i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2) = 2/(1 - i√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i√3):\n\n2*(1 + i√3)/(1 + 3) = (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nNow, add (1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = [1 + 1]/2 + [-i√3 + i√3]/2 = 2/2 + 0 = 1.\n\nOkay, so that works for ω = e^(2πi/3). Let me try ω = e^(4πi/3), which is ω².\n\nCompute 1 + ω²: 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2"

            "output": " - i√3/2.\n\n1/(1 + ω²) is the same as above, which is (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω is 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2, so 1/(1 + ω) is (1 - i√3)/2. So, adding them gives the same result: 1.\n\nHmm, so in both cases, whether ω is e^(2πi/3) or e^(4πi/3), the expression evaluates to 1. So, is 1 the only possible value?\n\nWait a second, but what if ω is 1? Then, 1 + ω = 2, and 1 + ω² is 1 + 1 = 2 as well. So, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So even when ω is 1, the expression is 1. So, regardless of whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root of unity, the expression is 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1. So, the answer is 1. But let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. Is there any other cube root of unity I haven't considered?\n\nWell, the equation ω³ = 1 has exactly three solutions: 1, ω, ω² with ω ≠ 1, so we covered all cases. Hence, the expression always equals 1.\n\nJust to recap: I combined the fractions, found that the denominator simplifies using the identity 1 + ω + ω² = 0, ended up with 1 as the sum, and verified it with specific values. All cases lead to the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the only possible value is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), we need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, we recognize that \\(\\omega\\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are 1, \\(\\omega\\), and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\)."
