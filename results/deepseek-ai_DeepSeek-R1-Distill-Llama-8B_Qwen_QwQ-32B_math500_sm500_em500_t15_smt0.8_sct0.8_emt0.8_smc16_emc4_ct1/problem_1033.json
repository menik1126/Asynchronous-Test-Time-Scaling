Then, I have to compute the sum of each of these polynomials evaluated at \\(x=1\\).\n\nFirst, let me write down the polynomial: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). Hmm, I notice that it's a degree 8 polynomial, so factoring it into lower-degree polynomials makes sense. Since it's monic, all the factors will also be monic.\n\nLooking at the polynomial, it seems like it's a quartic in terms of \\(x^4\\). So maybe I can let \\(y = x^4\\), which would transform the equation into \\(y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\\). Let me try solving this quadratic equation for \\(y\\).\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: \\(y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2}\\). So that gives two solutions: \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = -4\\). Therefore, substituting back, \\(x^4 = 1\\) and \\(x^4 = -4\\).\n\nBut \\(x^4 = -4\\) doesn't have real solutions, so that's not helpful for factoring into real polynomials. However, in the realm of integer coefficients, maybe we can still use complex roots? Wait, no, since we're factoring over integers, we need to find real factors.\n\nSo perhaps the polynomial can be factored into quadratics or quartics. Let me try to factor \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). Hmm, sometimes higher-degree polynomials can be factored as a product of two quadratics or other lower-degree polynomials.\n\nWait, but \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) seems similar to \\(x^4 + ax^2 + 1\\), which sometimes factors into two quadratics. Maybe that approach can work here.\n\nLet me consider whether it's a biquadratic. So, if I set \\(y = x^4\\), the equation becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4"

But hold on, is that correct?\n\nLet me check: \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = x^8 - x^4 + 4x^4 - 4 = x^8 + 3x^4 -4\\). Yes, that works! So the polynomial factors into \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). But now, are these factors irreducible over the integers?\n\nFirst, let's check \\(x^4 - 1\\). That's a difference of squares: \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Then, \\(x^2 - 1\\) can be factored further into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\). So actually, \\(x^4 -1\\) factors into linear terms over integers, but since we need monic polynomials that can't be factored further (irreducible over integers), so \\(x^2 + 1\\) is irreducible over integers because it doesn't have real roots, and \\(x^2 -1\\) factors further. Wait, but \\(x^2 -1\\) can be broken down into linear factors, so we need to factor that as well.\n\nSo, breaking down \\(x^4 -1\\) completely, we get \\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Each of these is irreducible over integers except maybe \\(x^2 +1\\), but since it can't be factored into real polynomials with integer coefficients, that's irreducible. So that's three factors here.\n\nNow, the other factor is \\(x^4 +4\\). Hmm, can this be factored over integers? Let me think. The polynomial \\(x^4 +4\\) is a sum of squares, but actually, it's a biquadratic. Wait, there's a formula for \\(x^4 + 4\\), which is a special case called the sum of squares, but"

Let me verify that:\n\nMultiplying out \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\):\n- \\(x^2 \\cdot x^2 = x^4\\)\n- \\(x^2 \\cdot (-2x) = -2x^3\\)\n- \\(x^2 \\cdot 2 = 2x^2\\)\n- \\(2x \\cdot x^2 = 2x^3\\)\n- \\(2x \\cdot (-2x) = -4x^2\\)\n- \\(2x \\cdot 2 = 4x\\)\n- \\(2 \\cdot x^2 = 2x^2\\)\n- \\(2 \\cdot (-2x) = -4x\\)\n- \\(2 \\cdot 2 = 4\\)\n\nAdding all these terms:\n\\(x^4 -2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 -4x^2 +4x +2x^2 -4x +4\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n- \\(x^4\\)\n- \\((-2x^3 + 2x^3) = 0\\)\n- \\((2x^2 -4x^2 +2x^2) = 0\\)\n- \\((4x -4x) = 0\\)\n- \\(+4\\)\n\nSo it's \\(x^4 +4\\), which is correct. So, \\(x^4 +4\\) factors into two quadratics with integer coefficients: \\((x^2 + 2x +2)\\) and \\((x^2 - 2x +2)\\), both of which are irreducible over integers because their discriminants are negative: for \\(x^2 +2x +2\\), discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), and for \\(x^2 -2x +2\\), discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4\\). So, these quadratics can't be factored further over integers.\n\nPutting it all together, the original polynomial factors"

So, all these factors are monic, integer coefficients, and irreducible. Therefore, that's our factorization.\n\nBut to confirm, let me count the degrees:\n\n- \\(x -1\\) is degree 1,\n- \\(x +1\\) is degree 1,\n- \\(x^2 +1\\) is degree 2,\n- \\(x^2 +2x +2\\) is degree 2,\n- \\(x^2 -2x +2\\) is degree 2.\n\nAdding up degrees: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8, which matches the original polynomial.

The original polynomial was factored into five monic, irreducible polynomials: two linear and three quadratic. Did I account for all? Yes, I think so.\n\nWait, hold on. Another thought: when I factored \\(x^4 -1\\) as \\((x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1)\\), that's correct, but is \\(x^2 +1\\) actually irreducible over integers? Yes, because it doesn't factor into integer linear terms, so that's the irreducible factor.\n\nSimilarly, \\(x^4 +4\\) factors into two quadratics as done before, each of which is irreducible.\n\nSo, all five factors are valid and irreducible over integers, so the sum is indeed 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{10}\n</think>\n\nTo factor the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) into a product of monic polynomials with integer coefficients, we start by recognizing it as a quartic in terms of \\(x^4\\).
