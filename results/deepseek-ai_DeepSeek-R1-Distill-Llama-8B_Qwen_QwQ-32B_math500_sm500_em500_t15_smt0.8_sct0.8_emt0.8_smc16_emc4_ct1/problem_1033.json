Then, I have to compute the sum of each of these polynomials evaluated at 1. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, the polynomial is \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). It looks like a quartic in terms of \\( x^4 \\), so maybe I can make a substitution to make it easier. Let me try letting \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\). Solving this quadratic for \\( y \\) might give me some insight.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, \\( y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2} \\). So, \\( y = 1 \\) or \\( y = -4 \\). Therefore, \\( x^4 = 1 \\) or \\( x^4 = -4 \\). Hmm, \\( x^4 = 1 \\) can be factored as \\( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\), which further factors into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). But what about \\( x^4 = -4 \\)? That seems trickier because it's a negative number.\n\nI recall that over the integers, solving \\( x^4 = -4 \\) might involve complex numbers, but since we need real integer coefficients, perhaps this suggests that the polynomial factors into quadratics. Maybe it's a biquadratic that can be factored into two quadratics. Let me assume that:\n\n\\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)(x^4 + ex^3 + fx^2 + gx + h) \\)\n\nBut since the polynomial is symmetric (the exponents of x are 8, 4, 0, and also in the middle: 3x^4), but wait, it's actually not symmetric in a way that suggests that both factors"

Hmm, perhaps I should try factoring it as a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\).\n\nWait, since substituting \\( y = x^4 \\) gives \\( y^2 + 3y -4 \\), which factors as (y + 4)(y - 1). So, substituting back, that would mean \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). Wait, that's a factorization! Let me check:\n\n\\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = x^8 - x^4 + 4x^4 -4 = x^8 + 3x^4 -4 \\). Yes! That works. So the original polynomial factors into \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). But are these factors irreducible over the integers?\n\nFirst, let's check \\( x^4 - 1 \\). That's a difference of squares: \\( (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Then, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) factors further into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) \\). So, \\( x^4 -1 \\) factors into linear terms over integers. But the problem states that each polynomial must be irreducible over integers, so we need to factor it completely.\n\nSo, \\( x^4 -1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Each of these is irreducible over integers because linear terms can't be factored further, and \\( x^2 + 1 \\) doesn't factor into real polynomials with integer coefficients (since it has roots at ±i, which are not real). So that's three factors so far.\n\nNow, the other factor is \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm, can this be factored over integers? Let me think. I remember that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is a sum of squares, but actually, it can be factored as a product of quadratics. Let me try to factor it.\n\nThere's a formula for \\( x^4 + 4 \\), which is a special"

Let's compute it step by step:\n\nMultiply \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\) with \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\):\n\nFirst, \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\).\n\nThen, \\( x^2*(-2x) = -2x^3 \\).\n\n\\( x^2*2 = 2x^2 \\).\n\nNext, \\( 2x * x^2 = 2x^3 \\).\n\n\\( 2x*(-2x) = -4x^2 \\).\n\n\\( 2x*2 = 4x \\).\n\nThen, \\( 2 * x^2 = 2x^2 \\).\n\n\\( 2*(-2x) = -4x \\).\n\n\\( 2*2 = 4 \\).\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\nx^4\n\n-2x^3 + 2x^3 = 0\n\n2x^2 -4x^2 + 2x^2 = 0\n\n4x -4x = 0\n\n+4.\n\nWait, that sums up to \\( x^4 + 4 \\). So yes, factoring works.\n\nBut are these quadratics irreducible over integers? Let's check the discriminant of \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\). The discriminant is \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), which is negative, so it doesn't factor into real linear terms, hence over integers it's irreducible. Similarly for \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\), discriminant is \\( 4 -8 = -4 \\), also negative. So both are irreducible over integers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\( (x^4 -1)(x^4 +4 ) ="

We make a substitution \\( y = x^4 \\), transforming the polynomial into \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we find the roots \\( y = 1 \\) and \\( y = -4 \\). Substituting back, we get \\( x^4 = 1 \\) or \\( x^4 = -4 \\).\n\nNext, we factor each term:\n- \\( x^4 - 1 \\) factors into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n- \\( x^4 + 4 \\) factors into \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nEach of these factors is irreducible over the integers because their discriminants (for the quadratic factors) are negative. Thus, the complete factorization of the original polynomial is:\n\\[ (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + "
