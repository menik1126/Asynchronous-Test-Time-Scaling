Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that for such problems, one common method is the method of Lagrange multipliers, but I'm not entirely sure if I can apply that here. Alternatively, maybe the AM-GM inequality could work since all variables are positive.\n\nLet me think about AM-GM. The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality states that the arithmetic mean of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean, with equality when all the numbers are equal. But in this case, the exponents on \\( b, c, \\) and \\( d \\) complicate things. Each variable is raised to a different power in the product, so maybe I need to adjust the AM-GM approach.\n\nWhat if I consider each variable multiplied by their respective weights? Since the exponents are 1, 2, 3, and 4, I can think of each variable contributing differently to the product. Maybe I can introduce weights proportional to these exponents into the AM-GM inequality. Let me define weights \\( w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4 \\) corresponding to each variable.\n\nWait, another idea: sometimes, in optimization problems with constraints, you can use the method of weighted AM-GM. The weights correspond to the exponents. Let me try that. So, the exponents on \\( a, b, c, d \\) are 1, 2, 3, and 4. To apply the weighted AM-GM, I need to write the sum as a combination of terms that can be multiplied together to give the product \\( ab^2c^3d^4 \\).\n\nLet me break down the exponents into a sum that matches the total weight. The total weight is \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 \\). Hmm, interesting, because the total sum \\( a + b + c + d = 10 \\). Maybe that's a coincidence, or maybe it's not. Let me see.\n\nIf I set each term in the AM-GM to represent the variables multiplied by their respective weights, I can express the product as a geometric mean"

For example, since \\( a \\) has exponent 1, I can consider it as one term. \\( b \\) has exponent 2, so maybe split \\( b \\) into two terms each of \\( b/2 \\). Similarly, \\( c \\) with exponent 3 would be split into three terms of \\( c/3 \\), and \\( d \\) with exponent 4 would be split into four terms of \\( d/4 \\).\n\nSo, the total number of terms would be \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 \\), which matches the total sum of 10. That seems promising. Let me write this out:\n\nThe product \\( ab^2c^3d^4 \\) can be thought of as the product of:\n\n- 1 term of \\( a \\),\n- 2 terms of \\( b \\),\n- 3 terms of \\( c \\),\n- 4 terms of \\( d \\).\n\nBut actually, to apply AM-GM, each term in the product should be the same. Wait, so if I split each variable into their respective exponents, then each \"part\" would be \\( a \\), \\( b/2 \\), \\( b/2 \\), \\( c/3 \\), \\( c/3 \\), \\( c/3 \\), \\( d/4 \\), \\( d/4 \\), \\( d/4 \\), \\( d/4 \\). Then, the product of all these terms would be \\( a \\times (b/2)^2 \\times (c/3)^3 \\times (d/4)^4 \\). \n\nThe arithmetic mean of these 10 terms would be:\n\n\\( \\frac{a + (b/2) + (b/2) + (c/3) + (c/3) + (c/3) + (d/4) + (d/4) + (d/4) + (d/4)}{10} \\).\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n\\( a + b + c + d \\), since each variable is split into their respective exponents. Since \\( a + b + c + d = 10 \\), the arithmetic mean is \\( \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\).\n\nBy AM-GM inequality, the geometric mean of"
