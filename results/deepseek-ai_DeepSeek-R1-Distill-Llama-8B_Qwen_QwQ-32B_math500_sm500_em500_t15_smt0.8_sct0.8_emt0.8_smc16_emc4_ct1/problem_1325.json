            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O. The rectangle has sides AB and AD such that AB divided by AD is equal to k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the rectangle. It's a standard rectangle with center O. Since AB and AD are sides, AB is the length, and AD is the width. The ratio of AB to AD is given as k, so AB = k * AD. That means if I let the length of AD be 1, then AB would be k. Or maybe it's better to assign specific lengths to make calculations easier.\n\nLet me define the coordinates to model this rectangle. Let's assume that the rectangle is centered at the origin (0,0). So, point O is at (0,0). If the rectangle has length AB = k and width AD = 1, then the coordinates of the vertices can be determined. Since the center is at (0,0), the coordinates of the vertices would be:\n\n- A: (-k/2, 1/2)\n- B: (k/2, 1/2)\n- C: (k/2, -1/2)\n- D: (-k/2, -1/2)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. If the length AB is k, then the distance from the center to each side along AB should be k/2, right? Similarly, since AD is 1, the distance from the center to each side along AD is 1/2. So yes, the coordinates I mentioned should be correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the region within the rectangle where any point is closer to the center O than to any of the four vertices. The probability would be the area of this region divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, the total area of the rectangle is AB * AD = k * 1 = k. Therefore, if I can find the area of the region where the distance from the point to O is less than the distance to each vertex, then dividing that by k will give me the probability.\n\nTo find this region, I need to determine the set of points (x, y) inside the rectangle such that the distance from (x, y) to"
