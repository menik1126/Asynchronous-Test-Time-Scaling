            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Then, express that distance as √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Finally, find a + b.\n\nOkay, let me think about how to approach this. The distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula, right? So if I have a point (x, y) on the graph, the distance D from the origin (0,0) to this point would be D = √(x² + y²). Since y is given in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula.\n\nSo substituting y, the distance becomes D = √(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²). Let me write that out to make it clearer:\n\nD = √[x² + ( (x² - 3)/√2 )² ]\n\nHmm, simplifying that expression might help. Let me square both sides to make it easier to handle, because the square root can complicate things. So, let me consider D²:\n\nD² = x² + [ (x² - 3)/√2 ]²\n\nExpanding that, the second term is [(x² - 3)²]/2. So,\n\nD² = x² + (x² - 3)² / 2\n\nNow, to find the minimum distance, I need to find the minimum value of D², since the square root function is monotonically increasing. So if I minimize D², I will also be minimizing D.\n\nSo, let me set f(x) = x² + (x² - 3)² / 2. My goal is to find the x that minimizes f(x).\n\nLet me expand f(x) to make it easier to take the derivative. First, expand (x² - 3)²:\n\n(x² - 3)² = x⁴ - 6x² + 9\n\nSo, f(x) = x² + (x⁴ - 6x² + 9)/2\n\nLet me distribute the 1/2:\n\nf(x) = x² + (x⁴)/2"

So, expressed as √a / b, that would be √10 / 2, so a is 10 and b is 2.\n\nWait, but let me verify if 10 is square-free. 10 factors into 2 * 5, neither of which is a square, so yes, 10 is square-free. So a = 10, b = 2.\n\nTherefore, a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nSo, starting from D² = x² + (x² - 3)^2 / 2.\n\nAt x = √2, x² = 2, so (2 - 3) = -1, so (x² -3)^2 = 1, so (1)/2 = 1/2.\n\nThus, D² = x² + (x² -3)^2 /2 = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2. So yes, D² = 5/2, D = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nSo the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2, so a=10, b=2, a + b = 12.\n\nWait, but let me also check if there are any other minima. For example, sometimes endpoints can be a concern if the function is defined on a specific interval, but here x can be any real number, so the only critical points are at x=0, x=√2, and x=-√2.\n\nI evaluated all of them, and indeed x=√2 gives the lowest value, so that should be the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use some other method, like completing the square or using calculus differently, but I think the way I've approached it is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: Alternatively, maybe parametrize the problem as minimizing x² + y² with y"

The distance from the origin to the parabola. Hmm, but I think calculus is the right way here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the distance from a point to a parabola? But I don't remember the exact formula, so calculus is safer.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's an error in the derivative.\n\nOriginal f(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nThen f'(x) = 2x³ - 4x, which is correct. Setting to zero gives 2x³ -4x =0, so 2x(x² -2)=0, so x=0 or x=±√2. That's correct.\n\nSo, the critical points are correct. Then evaluating f at those points, yes, at x=√2, f(x)=5/2, which is less than 9/2 at x=0. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2). But sqrt(5/2) is equal to sqrt(10)/2, since sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(10)/2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nHmm, but let me check once more. Let me compute sqrt(5/2):\n\nsqrt(5/2) is indeed sqrt(10)/2, because sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(10)/2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the problem is solved correctly.
