            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). Hmm, that sounds like a distance optimization problem. I remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. \n\nFirst, let me write down the distance formula. For a point (x, y), the distance D from the origin (0, 0) is D = sqrt((x - 0)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2). So, D = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). But in this case, y is given in terms of x, so I can substitute that into the distance formula.\n\nGiven y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3), let's plug that into D. So, D = sqrt(x\u00b2 + [(1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)]\u00b2). I think that simplifies to sqrt(x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2). \n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. When squaring (1/\u221a2), it becomes 1/2, right? Because (1/\u221a2)\u00b2 = 1/2. So, yes, that part is correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the minimum distance, which means I need to minimize D. Since the square root function is monotonically increasing, the minimum of D will occur at the same point where the square of D is minimized. So, let me define a function f(x) = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2. Then, I can find the value of x that minimizes f(x), and that will give me the point closest to the origin.\n\nAlright, let's compute f(x):\n\nf(x) = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand that second term:\n\nFirst, expand (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2. That's x^4 - 6x\u00b2 + 9. Then, multiply by 1/2: (1/2)x^4 - 3x\u00b2 + 4.5.\n\nSo, f(x) = x\u00b2 + (1/2)x^4 - 3x\u00b2 + 4.5.\n\nCombine like terms: The x\u00b2 terms are x\u00b2 - 3"

So now, f(x) is a quartic function, but it's a function of x\u00b2, so maybe I can let u = x\u00b2, making f(u) = (1/2)u\u00b2 - 2u + 4.5. That might make it easier to find the minimum.\n\nYes, let me make that substitution. Let u = x\u00b2, then f(u) = (1/2)u\u00b2 - 2u + 4.5.\n\nNow, this is a quadratic in u. I can find the minimum of this quadratic by finding its vertex. For a quadratic function in the form f(u) = au\u00b2 + bu + c, the vertex occurs at u = -b/(2a).\n\nHere, a = 1/2 and b = -2. So, u = -(-2)/(2*(1/2)) = 2 / 1 = 2. So, the minimum occurs at u = 2.\n\nSince u = x\u00b2, then x\u00b2 = 2, so x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2). Both points will give the same minimal distance because the distance is symmetric with respect to x and -x.\n\nSo, now, I can plug u = 2 back into f(u) to find the minimal value. \n\nf(2) = (1/2)(2)^2 - 2*(2) + 4.5 = (1/2)*4 - 4 + 4.5 = 2 - 4 + 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nWait, 2 - 4 is -2, and -2 + 4.5 is 2.5, which is 5/2. So, f(u) at minimum is 5/2.\n\nBut f(u) is equal to x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)^2. So, the minimal value of f(u) is 5/2, which is equal to (sqrt(f(u)))^2, which is the square of the distance. Therefore, the minimal distance D is sqrt(5/2).\n\nWait, sqrt(5/2) can be simplified. Since 5/2 is equal to"

Therefore, the distance is sqrt(10)/2, which can be written as sqrt(10)/2, so a is 10 and b is 2. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b,\" where a and b are positive integers such that a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. So, 10 is square-free, right? 10 factors into 2*5, neither of which are squares. So, 10 is square-free, and b is 2. So, a is 10, b is 2. So, a + b is 12.\n\nWait, before I finish, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes substituting or expanding can lead to errors.\n\nStarting again, f(x) = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)^2.\n\nExpanding (x\u00b2 - 3)^2 gives x^4 -6x\u00b2 +9, so (1/2)(x^4 -6x\u00b2 +9) = (1/2)x^4 -3x\u00b2 +4.5.\n\nAdding the other x\u00b2, so f(x) = (1/2)x^4 -3x\u00b2 +4.5 + x\u00b2 = (1/2)x^4 -2x\u00b2 +4.5.\n\nSet u = x\u00b2, so f(u) = (1/2)u\u00b2 -2u +4.5.\n\nDerivative of f(u) is f\u2019(u) = u -2. Setting f\u2019(u)=0 gives u = 2, as before.\n\nSo f(u) at u=2 is (1/2)(4) -2*(2) +4.5 = 2 -4 +4.5 = 2.5. So 5/2 is f(u). So D^2 = 5/2, so D = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nHmm, sqrt(10)/2 is correct. So, a=10, b=2, sum is 12. Yeah, that seems"

Let me try that to verify.\n\nSo, starting with D = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Since y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 -3), plug that in:\n\nD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + [(1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 -3)]^2). So, D = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 -3)^2). Let me call that f(x) again.\n\nTo find the minimum, take derivative f'(x), set to zero.\n\nCompute f'(x):\n\nFirst, f(x) = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 -3)^2). Let me write f(x) = [x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x^4 -6x\u00b2 +9)]^1/2.\n\nSo f(x) = [ (1/2)x^4 -3x^2 +4.5 +x\u00b2 ]^(1/2) = [ (1/2)x^4 -2x\u00b2 +4.5 ]^(1/2).\n\nLet me denote g(x) = (1/2)x^4 -2x\u00b2 +4.5, so f(x) = sqrt(g(x)).\n\nCompute f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = (1/(2*sqrt(g(x)))) * g'(x).\n\nCompute g'(x): g'(x) = (1/2)*4x^3 - 2*2x +0 = 2x^3 -4x.\n\nSo, f'(x) = [2x^3 -4x] / [2*sqrt(g(x)))] = [2x(x^2 - 2)] / [2*sqrt(g(x)))] = [x(x^2 -2)] / sqrt(g(x)).\n\nSet f'(x)=0, so [x(x^2 -2)] / sqrt(g(x)) =0.\n\nDenominator sqrt(g(x)) is always positive except when g(x)=0, but g(x) is a sum of squares plus a constant, so it's always positive. So, the numerator must be zero: x(x^2 -2) =0.\n\nThus, x=0 or x^2 =2 => x= sqrt(2) or x=-sqrt(2).\n\nSo, critical points at x=0"

Then, distance squared is 0^2 + (-3/\u221a2)^2 = 9/2. So sqrt(9/2)= 3/sqrt(2)= 3\u221a2/2 \u22482.121.\n\nAt x= sqrt(2):\n\nCompute y = (1/\u221a2)( (sqrt(2))^2 -3 ) = (1/\u221a2)(2 -3) = (1/\u221a2)(-1) = -1/\u221a2.\n\nThen, distance squared is (sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/\u221a2)^2 = 2 + (1/2) = 2.5 =5/2. So sqrt(5/2)=sqrt(10)/2\u22481.581.\n\nSimilarly, at x=-sqrt(2), same y value, so same distance.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is indeed sqrt(10)/2, so a=10, b=2, so a+b=12.\n\nWait, but let me check x=0 again. The distance squared is 9/2, which is 4.5, but 5/2 is 2.5, so yes, 2.5 is smaller. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12. \n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is using geometry or parametric equations, but calculus seems straightforward here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the distance from a point to a parabola. But since the parabola is not in standard form, maybe that's more complicated. Let me see.\n\nThe given equation is y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 -3). Let me write this as y = (1/\u221a2)x\u00b2 - 3/\u221a2. So, it's a parabola opening upwards with vertex at (0, -3/\u221a2). The distance from the origin to the vertex is sqrt(0 + ( -3/\u221a2)^2 ) = 3/\u221a2 \u22482.121, which is the same as the distance at x=0. But the minimal"
