Let's try grouping 4 and 5: \\((4 + 5)\\). This gives me \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 9 + 6\\).\n\nNext, I'll simplify the expression: \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\), and \\(6 - 9 = -3\\). Then, \\(-3 + 6 = 3\\).\n\nHowever, I notice that rearranging the parentheses to include more negative numbers might yield an even lower value. By changing the grouping to \\((5 + 6)\\), the expression becomes \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 11\\), which simplifies to \\(6 - 4 + 11 = 13\\), which is not lower.\n\nAnother strategy is to group both 4 and 5 with 6: \\((4 + 5 + 6)\\). This gives me \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 15\\), resulting in \\(6 - 15 = -9\\).\n\nThis seems lower than the previous results. To ensure I'm not missing a better grouping, I'll try different placements, like \\((1 + 2 + 3 + 4)\\), which results in \\(10 - 5 + 6 = 11\\), not lower.\n\nFinally, by grouping 4, 5, and 6 together, I achieve the lowest value of \\(-9\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the minimum possible value of the expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\) by adding parentheses, we need to strategically group the numbers to create smaller or negative sub-expressions.\n\n**Step 1: Original Expression**\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Grouping to Minimize**\nWe aim to create sub-expressions that result in negative values to reduce the overall sum.

    "question": "The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)\n\nEnter your answer as a single value."
