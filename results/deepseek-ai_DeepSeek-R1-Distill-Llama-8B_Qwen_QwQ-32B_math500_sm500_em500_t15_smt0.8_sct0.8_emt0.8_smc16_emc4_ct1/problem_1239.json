            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this equation: x equals the square root of (11 - 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably get rid of the square root to make the equation easier to handle. The equation is x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. So, maybe I can subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the square root term. Let me write that out:\n\nx - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nNow, to eliminate the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. But wait, before I do that, I should remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll need to check my answers at the end.\n\nOkay, so squaring both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nNow, let me bring all the terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. I'll subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nAlright, now I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me try factoring it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, those numbers would be -1 and -5 because (-1) * (-5) = 5 and (-1) + (-5) = -6. So, the equation factors as:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. But wait, I need to make sure these solutions are valid in the original equation because we squared both sides earlier, which can sometimes give false solutions.\n\nLet me check x = 1 first. Plugging it into the original equation:\n\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nLeft side: 1\n\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 2*1) + 4 = sqrt(9) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nHmm,"

            "output": " 1 \u2260 7. So, x = 1 is not a valid solution. That means it's an extraneous solution introduced by squaring both sides. I need to discard it.\n\nNow, let me check x = 5:\n\nLeft side: 5\n\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 2*5) + 4 = sqrt(11 - 10) + 4 = sqrt(1) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, 5 equals 5. That works! Therefore, x = 5 is the valid solution.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, I'll recap the steps. I started by isolating the square root, squared both sides, solved the quadratic, and then checked each solution in the original equation. Only x = 5 worked, so that's my only solution.\n\nI wonder if there are any other possible solutions or if I missed something. Let me think. The square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers, so the expression inside the square root, 11 - 2x, must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\nSo, 11 - 2x \u2265 0\n\nSolving that:\n\n2x \u2264 11\n\nx \u2264 11/2\n\nx \u2264 5.5\n\nSo, any solution must be less than or equal to 5.5. Both x = 1 and x = 5 satisfy that, but x = 1 didn't work in the original equation because it led to a contradiction. So, the only valid solution is x = 5.\n\nAnother thing to consider: when I squared both sides, did I do it correctly? Let me check:\n\nOriginal after isolating sqrt: x - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSquared: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nExpanding left side: x\u00b2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nBring everything to left: x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = 0, which factors to (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0. That seems correct.\n\nSo, yep, everything checks out. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the square root"
