            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. Let me write it down again to make sure I've got it right.\n\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, so my variable is x, and on the right side, there's a square root involved. Square roots can complicate things because you can't just distribute them like regular terms. I remember that when dealing with equations that have square roots, a common strategy is to isolate the square root first and then square both sides to eliminate it. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I should get rid of the square root by itself. So, if I subtract 4 from both sides, that should help. Let's do that:\n\nx - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nOkay, now the square root is isolated on one side. That should make squaring both sides easier. Let's square both sides of the equation. Before I do that, I should remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll need to check my answers at the end.\n\nSo, squaring both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have a quadratic equation. Let's bring all the terms to one side so I can set the equation to zero. I'll subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides.\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nAlright, so now I have x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. I can try to factor this quadratic equation. Let me see if there are two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, -1 and -5?\n\nYes, because (-1) * (-5) = 5 and (-1) + (-5) = -6. So, the equation factors as:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives:\n\nx - 1 ="

            "output": " 0 ==> x = 1\n\nx - 5 = 0 ==> x = 5\n\nSo, the potential solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. Now, I need to check these solutions in the original equation because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce solutions that don't actually work.\n\nLet's check x = 1 first.\n\nOriginal equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nPlugging in x = 1:\n\n1 = sqrt(11 - 2*(1)) + 4\n\nCalculates to:\n\n1 = sqrt(11 - 2) + 4\n\nsqrt(9) is 3, so:\n\n1 = 3 + 4\n\nWhich is:\n\n1 = 7\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. 1 is not equal to 7. So, x = 1 is an extraneous solution. It must have been introduced when we squared both sides, so we have to discard it.\n\nNow, let's check x = 5.\n\nPlugging in x = 5:\n\n5 = sqrt(11 - 2*(5)) + 4\n\nCalculates to:\n\n5 = sqrt(11 - 10) + 4\n\nsqrt(1) is 1, so:\n\n5 = 1 + 4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n5 = 5\n\nThat's true, so x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nHmm, so x = 1 doesn't work, but x = 5 does. That means even though we found two solutions algebraically, only one is valid in the original equation.\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when squaring both sides, small errors can lead to wrong solutions, but in this case, I think I was careful.\n\nStarting with x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4, moving 4 over by subtracting 4, that's correct. Then squaring both sides, yeah, that gives the quadratic. Then simplifying, that seems fine. Factoring correctly as (x - 1)(x - 5) because 1*5=5 and sum is 6, but with negative signs.\n\nWait, so  x^2 - 6x + 5: when factored, (x -1)(x -5)=0, so x=1 and x=5. That's"

            "output": " right.\n\nThen checking x=1: 1 = sqrt(11-2*1) +4. sqrt(9)=3, so 3+4=7, which is not 1. So that's wrong. x=5: sqrt(11-10)=1, plus 4 is 5. Correct. So yeah, only x=5 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the algebra steps?\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) +4\n\nSubtract 4: x -4 = sqrt(11 -2x)\n\nSquare both sides: (x-4)^2 = 11 -2x\n\nExpand left side: x² -8x +16 = 11 -2x\n\nBring all terms to left: x² -8x +16 -11 +2x =0\n\nCombine like terms: x² -6x +5 =0. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFactored into (x-1)(x-5)=0. Correct.\n\nSo, the steps are okay. So, the only valid solution is 5.\n\nHmm, so the answer is 5. But let me think again, maybe I should check if there are any other possible solutions or if I missed something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the domain of the original equation. The expression under the square root must be non-negative, so 11 -2x ≥0. So, 11 -2x ≥0 ⇒ x ≤ 11/2, which is 5.5. So x must be less than or equal to 5.5. Also, the right-hand side of the original equation is sqrt(11-2x) +4. Since sqrt(11-2x) is non-negative, the right-hand side is at least 4. Therefore, the left-hand side x must be at least 4. So, x ≥4. So the domain is x ∈ [4, 5.5].\n\nSo, possible solutions must be between 4 and 5.5. So, x=5 is within that interval, but x=1 is not. So that's another way to see that x=1 is invalid because it's"
