First, I remember that when there's a cube root in an equation, one common strategy is to get rid of it by cubing both sides. That should simplify things a bit. So, let me write that down.\n\nStarting with the equation:\n√³(x² - 4x + 4) = 16\n\nIf I cube both sides, I should eliminate the cube root. So, doing that gives me:\n(x² - 4x + 4)³ = 16³\n\nNow, I need to calculate 16³. Let me compute that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16 is... hmm, 256 * 10 is 2560, 256 * 6 is 1536, so adding those together gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, 16³ is 4096. That means the equation becomes:\n(x² - 4x + 4)³ = 4096\n\nBut wait, the left side is a cube, so maybe I can take the cube root of both sides again? Or perhaps I can first take the cube root to simplify it. Let me try that. If I take the cube root of both sides, I get:\nx² - 4x + 4 = ∛4096\n\nNow, I need to figure out what ∛4096 is. I know that 16³ is 4096, so the cube root of 4096 is 16. So, substituting that back in:\nx² - 4x + 4 = 16\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it to standard form. Subtracting 16 from both sides:\nx² - 4x + 4 - 16 = 0\nSimplify that:\nx² - 4x - 12 = 0\n\nAlright, now I have x² - 4x - 12 = 0. To solve this quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a), where a = "

            "output": "1, b = -4, and c = -12.\n\nLet me plug those values in:\nx = (-(-4) ± √((-4)² - 4*1*(-12))) / (2*1)\nSimplify inside the square root first:\n(-(-4)) is 4.\n(-4)² is 16.\nThen, 4*1*(-12) is -48, but since it's -4ac, it becomes +48. So, the discriminant is 16 + 48, which is 64.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\nx = (4 ± √64) / 2\n\nThe square root of 64 is 8, so:\nx = (4 ± 8) / 2\n\nNow, let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, the plus case:\nx = (4 + 8)/2 = 12/2 = 6\n\nSecond, the minus case:\nx = (4 - 8)/2 = (-4)/2 = -2\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 6 and x = -2. But the question specifically asks for the positive value of x, so x = 6 is the solution we need.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation, cubing both sides correctly eliminated the cube root, and I correctly calculated 16³ as 4096. Then taking the cube root again gave me 16, which I substituted back into the equation to form a quadratic. I subtracted 16 correctly to get x² - 4x - 12 = 0.\n\nApplying the quadratic formula, I correctly identified a=1, b=-4, c=-12. Plugging into the formula, I calculated the discriminant as 16 + 48 = 64, which is correct. Taking the square root of 64 gave me 8, leading to solutions (4 ± 8)/2, which gives 6 and -2. Since we're only interested in the positive solution, x=6 is the answer.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cube both sides** to eliminate the cube root:\n   \\[\n   ("
