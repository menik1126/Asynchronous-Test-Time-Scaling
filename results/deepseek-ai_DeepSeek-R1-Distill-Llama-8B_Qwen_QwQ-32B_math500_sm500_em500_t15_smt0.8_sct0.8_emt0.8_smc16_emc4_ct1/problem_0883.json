            "output": "I need to determine whether the denominator 160 has only factors of 2 and 5, which are necessary for a fraction to convert to a terminating decimal.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 160. Breaking it down, 160 can be expressed as 16 multiplied by 10. Further, 16 is 2 raised to the power of 4, and 10 is 2 multiplied by 5.\n\nCombining these, the prime factors of 160 are 2\u2075 and 5\u00b9.\n\nSince the denominator has only 2s and 5s in its prime factorization, the fraction 57/160 can indeed be converted into a terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Condition for Terminating Decimals**:\n   \n   A fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will have a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\(b\\) (after simplifying the fraction) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n2. **Factorize the Denominator**:\n   \n   \\[\n   160 = 16 \\times 10 = (2^4) \\times (2 \\times 5) = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n   \\]\n   \n   The prime factors of 160 are only 2 and 5.\n\n3. **Apply the Decimal Conversion**:\n   \n   Since the denominator only contains the prime factors 2 and 5, the fraction can be converted to a terminating decimal by performing division.\n\n4. **Divide Numerator by Denominator**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n   \\]\n   \n   - **Step 1**: \\(57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\\)\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.35625}\n   \\]"
