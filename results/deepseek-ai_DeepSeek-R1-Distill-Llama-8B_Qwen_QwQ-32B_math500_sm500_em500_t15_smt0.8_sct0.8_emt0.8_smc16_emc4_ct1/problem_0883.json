            "output": "First, I need to find the prime factors of both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction 57/160. \n\nStarting with the numerator, 57, I'll divide it by 3 to get 19. So, 57 = 3 × 19.\n\nNext, for the denominator, 160, I'll divide by 2 repeatedly until I can't anymore. This gives me 160 = 2⁵ × 5. \n\nNow, I'll identify the common factors between the two numbers. Both 57 and 160 do not share any common prime factors since 57 is composed of 3 and 19, and 160 is composed of 2 and 5.\n\nSince there are no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form. This means I can directly convert it into a terminating decimal by placing the denominator under the square root symbol.\n\nFinally, taking the square root of the denominator, √160, will yield an irrational number. Therefore, 57/160 cannot be converted into a terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - **Numerator (57)**:\n     \\[\n     57 = 3 \\times 19\n     \\]\n   - **Denominator (160)**:\n     \\[\n     160 = 2^5 \\times 5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Check for Common Factors**:\n   - The numerator and the denominator have no common prime factors since 57 is \\(3 \\times 19\\) and 160 is \\(2^5 \\times 5\\).\n   \n3. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   - Since there are no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n4. **Convert to Decimal**:\n   - A fraction will result in a terminating decimal if the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5 after simplification.\n   - In this case, \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) satisfies this condition because the denominator is composed solely of the primes 2 and 5.\n   \n5. **Calculate the Decimal**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
