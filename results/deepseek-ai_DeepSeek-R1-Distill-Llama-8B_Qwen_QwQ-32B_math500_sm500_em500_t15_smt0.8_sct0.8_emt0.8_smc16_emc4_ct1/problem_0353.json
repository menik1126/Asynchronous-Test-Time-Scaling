            "output": "First, I'll define variables for the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let B represent blue marbles and Y represent yellow marbles.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles. Therefore, I can express the initial counts as B = 4k and Y = 3k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nNext, I'll apply the changes to the marble counts. I'm adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles. So, the new counts become B + 5 and Y - 3.\n\nAfter these changes, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles becomes 7:3. This gives me the equation (B + 5) / (Y - 3) = 7 / 3.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for B and Y in terms of k into the equation, I get (4k + 5) / (3k - 3) = 7 / 3. To eliminate the fractions, I'll cross-multiply to obtain 3(4k + 5) = 7(3k - 3).\n\nExpanding both sides, I have 12k + 15 = 21k - 21. Combining like terms leads to -9k = -36, which simplifies to k = 4.\n\nFinally, to find the initial number of blue marbles, I'll substitute k = 4 back into the expression for B, resulting in B = 4 * 4 = 16. Therefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before the changes.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nLet:\n- \\( B \\) = initial number of blue marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = initial number of yellow marbles\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Ratio**\n\nThe initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\).
