            "output": "First, I recognize that we have a square table with 8 people to seat, and each side of the table will have 2 people sitting on it.\n\nSince the table is square, it has rotational symmetry. This means that rotating the entire arrangement won't create a new, distinct configuration. Therefore, I need to account for these rotations to avoid overcounting.\n\nI'll start by calculating the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around the table without considering rotations. This can be done using the formula for circular permutations:\n\nTotal arrangements = (8 - 1)! = 7! = 5040\n\nHowever, since the table is square and has 4 sides, each rotation by 90 degrees will result in an equivalent configuration. To eliminate these rotations, I'll divide the total number of arrangements by the number of sides (which is 4):\n\nCorrected arrangements = 5040 / 4 = 1260\n\nFinally, I'll consider whether the two people on each side are distinguishable. If the positions are fixed relative to each other or the table, I might need to adjust the calculation. However, since the problem doesn't specify any additional constraints, dividing by 4 is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements is 1260.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotational symmetry, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have 8 people to seat around a square table.\n   - Each side of the square will have exactly 2 people sitting on it.\n   - Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Arrangements Without Considering Rotations:**\n   - Treat the table as a circle. The number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circle is given by the formula for circular permutations:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Arrangements} = (8 - 1)! = 7! = 5040\n     \\]\n\n3. **Account for Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - The square table has 4 sides, and each full rotation (360 degrees) results in an equivalent arrangement.\n   - To eliminate these rotations, divide the total arrangements by the number of sides:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Corrected Arrangements} = \\frac{5040}{4}"
