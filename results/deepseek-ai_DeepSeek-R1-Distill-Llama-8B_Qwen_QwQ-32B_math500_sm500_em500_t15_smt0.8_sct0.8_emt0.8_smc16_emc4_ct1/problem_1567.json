Since it's a square table, there are 4 sides, so initially, it might seem like there are 4 choices for seating.\n\nHowever, the problem states that two configurations are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other. This means that some of these arrangements are actually duplicates when considering the rotational symmetry of the table.\n\nTo account for the rotational symmetry, I should divide the number of total arrangements by the number of possible rotations. Since the table has 4 sides, there are 4 possible rotations.\n\nSo, the formula to find the distinct seating arrangements is the total number of arrangements divided by the number of symmetries, which in this case is 4. \n\nBy applying this formula, I can determine the number of unique ways to seat the 8 people around the square table.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:** In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side? (Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Total seats around the table:**\n   - The table is square, and each side has 2 people.\n   - There are 4 sides, and each side accommodates 2 people.\n   - **Total seats = 4 sides × 2 people per side = 8 seats.**\n\n2. **Understanding Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - Two configurations are considered the same if one can be rotated to form the other.\n   - A square table has rotational symmetry of **order 4**, meaning it can be rotated by 90°, 180°, 270°, or 360° (which is the same as 0°), and each rotation would result in an equivalent configuration.\n\n3. **Calculating Distinct Configurations:**\n   - First, calculate the total number of ways to arrange 8 people in 8 seats without considering rotations.\n   - Since the people are distinct, the number of ways is **8!**.\n   - However, due to rotational symmetry, each unique configuration is counted multiple times in the total arrangements.\n   - To find the number of distinct configurations, divide the total arrangements by the number of rotational symmetries.\n   - **Number of Rotations = 4** (0°, 90"
