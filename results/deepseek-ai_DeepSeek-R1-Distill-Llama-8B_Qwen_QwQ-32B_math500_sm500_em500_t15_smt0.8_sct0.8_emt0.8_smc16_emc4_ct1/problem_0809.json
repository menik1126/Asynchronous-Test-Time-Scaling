            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about polynomials with integer coefficients. The polynomial is given as f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0. They told me that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. Also, all the roots are distinct integers. The question is asking for the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and all roots are integers, I remember that such polynomials can be expressed in their factored form. Specifically, because the leading coefficient is 2, the polynomial can be written as f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), where each r_i is an integer.\n\nGiven that, the constant term a_0 is 66. But in the factored form, the constant term is 2 times the product of all the roots with a negative sign because of each (x - r_i). So, a_0 = 2*(-1)^n*(r_1*r_2*...*r_n). But since a_0 is 66, that gives us 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66. Therefore, the product of the roots (r_1*r_2*...*r_n) must be 66 divided by 2 times (-1)^n. Wait, actually, let me think more clearly.\n\nStarting over: a_0 is the constant term, which is 2*(-1)^n*r_1*r_2*...*r_n. So, 2*(-1)^n*(r1*r2*...*rn) = 66. Therefore, (r1*r2*...*rn) = 66 / [2*(-1)^n]. Depending on whether n is even or odd, (-1)^n is either 1 or -1, so 66 divided by 2 is 33. So, (r1*r2*...*rn) = 33 if n is even, or -33 if n is odd.\n\nWait, that might be a miscalculation. Let's do it carefully. a_0 = 2*(-1)^n*(r1*r2*...*rn) ="

So, the product of roots is 33*(-1)^n.\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the next step is to figure out the roots such that their product is either 33 or -33, and all roots are distinct integers. Also, we want the least possible |a_{n-1}|. So, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, which is the coefficient of the x^{n-1} term. In the polynomial, a_{n-1} is equal to -2*(sum of the roots). So, |a_{n-1}| = |sum of the roots|.\n\nTherefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize |sum of roots|.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. Let me confirm: in the factored form, f(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). If we expand this, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is 2*(-1)*(r1 + r2 + ... + rn). So, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). So, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. Wait, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, let me expand (x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). The x^{n} term is x^n, the x^{n-1} term is -(r1 + r2 + ... + rn)*x^{n-1}, and the constant term is (-1)^n*r1*r2*...*rn.\n\nTherefore, when we factor in the 2, the polynomial becomes 2x^n - 2*(sum of roots)*x^{n-1} + 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots). So, a_{n-1} is -2*(sum of roots), and a_0 is 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots).\n\nSo, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. So, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to"

So, the problem reduces to finding distinct integers r1, r2, ..., rn such that their product is either 33 or -33 (depending on n's parity), and the sum of the roots has the smallest possible absolute value.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and whose sum is as close to zero as possible. Since the product is fixed, we need to choose factors of 33 (or -33) such that their sum is minimized in absolute value.\n\nFirst, let's note that 33 factors into integers. Let's list all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33. Since the roots have to be distinct integers, we can consider both positive and negative factors.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where the product is 33. Then, the roots multiply to 33. The factors of 33 are 1, 3, 11, 33, and their negatives. Since they have to be distinct, we can have different combinations. Similarly, if the product is -33, then the roots multiply to -33, so the factors can be positive and negative such that their product is negative.\n\nOur goal is to find such a set of integers (with product 33 or -33) with the minimal possible absolute sum. Let's consider both cases (product 33 and -33) and see which gives a smaller sum.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where the product is 33. Let's list all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 33. Since 33 is positive, the number of negative factors must be even. Let's see:\n\nPossible factorizations (positive integers first):\n\n1) 1, 3, 11 (product 1*3*11 = 33). The sum is 1 + 3 + 11 = 15.\n\n2) 1, 33 (product 1*33 = 33).

So, the roots in this case are 1, -1, -3, 11. Sum is 1 -1 -3 +11 = 8.\n\nAnother set: 1, -1, 3, -11. The product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11) = 33. The sum is 1 -1 +3 -11 = -8. So, absolute sum is 8.\n\nAlternatively, could we have four roots? Because 33 has prime factors 3 and 11, so if we include 1, then we have to include more factors.\n\nAlternatively, can I get a smaller sum?\n\nWait, 1, -1, -3, 11 gives a sum of 8. Is it possible to get a smaller sum?\n\nWhat if we include more roots, like with three roots. Wait, three roots: 1, -1, 3, 11: but 1*-1*3*11=33, but that's four roots.

Not better.\n\nHmm, maybe another combination.  Could we have a combination with 1, -1, -2, and something else? Wait, but -2 isn't a factor of 33. 33 divided by -2 is -16.5, which is not integer, so that won't work.\n\nWait, perhaps including a 33 and some -1s?

The sum is 33 +1 -1 =33, which is larger than 8.\n\nAlternatively, 11, 3, -1: 11*3*(-1) = -33, which is another product. The sum is 11 +3 + (-1)=13. So, |sum| is 13, which is higher than 8.\n\nWait, but if we have four roots, and product is -33, let's see. So, suppose the product is -33. Then, the roots would have an odd number of negative factors. So, instead of two negative factors, we can have one.\n\nSo, let's explore the case where the product is -33, because that might allow for a different combination of roots with a smaller sum.\n\nSo, if the product is -33, then the product of the roots is -33.
