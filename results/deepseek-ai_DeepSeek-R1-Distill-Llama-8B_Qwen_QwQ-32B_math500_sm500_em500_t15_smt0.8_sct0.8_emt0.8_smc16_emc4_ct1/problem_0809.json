I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, it should be a monic polynomial or a multiple of a monic polynomial, but in this case, since a_n is 2, it's not monic. However, all roots being integers means that the polynomial can be factored into linear terms with integer roots. So, I can write f(x) as 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_k), where each r_i is an integer, and all roots r_i are distinct.\n\nGiven that a_0 is the constant term, which is 66, and since the leading coefficient is 2, the product of the roots times (-1)^k*2 should equal 66. So, 2*(-1)^k*(r_1*r_2*...*r_k) = 66. Therefore, r_1*r_2*...*r_k = 66/(-1)^k * (1/2). But since the product of the roots must be an integer (as all roots are integers), 66 must be divisible by 2, which it is, so 66/2 = 33. Therefore, the product of the roots is 33 when k is even, and -33 when k is odd, because of the (-1)^k factor. Wait, no, actually, more accurately, the constant term is a_0 = 2*(-1)^k*(r_1 r_2 ... r_k). So, solving for the product of roots, it's a_0 / (2*(-1)^k). Since a_0 is 66, the product of the roots is 66 / (2*(-1)^k) = 33 / (-1)^k. So, the product is either 33 or -33 depending on the parity of k.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct myself. The constant term is a_0 = 2*(-1)^k*(product of roots). So, the product of roots is a_0 /"

            "output": " [2*(-1)^k]. Since a_0 is 66, that's 66 divided by [2*(-1)^k], so 33 divided by (-1)^k. Therefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether k is even or odd. Since the roots are integers, their product must be an integer, which it is in both cases. So, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33. \n\nTherefore, the roots must be integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and all roots are distinct. Since the problem states that the roots are distinct integers, we need to find all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and then determine which of these sets would give the minimal |a_{n-1}|.\n\nNow, the coefficient a_{n-1} is the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the polynomial. Since the polynomial is 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_k), expanding this, the coefficient of x^{k-1} would be -2*(sum of roots). Wait, actually, let me think again. Let me recall Vieta's formula here. For a monic polynomial (x - r_1)...(x - r_k), the coefficient of x^{k-1} is - (sum of roots). But since our polynomial is 2*(x - r_1)...(x - r_k), the leading term is 2x^k, and the next term is 2*(-sum of roots)x^{k-1}. Therefore, the coefficient a_{k-1} is -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, the absolute value |a_{k-1}| is 2*|sum of roots|. \n\nTherefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, which is 2*|sum of roots|, we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots. So, the problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and such that the absolute value of their sum is as small as possible. Then, the minimal |sum| multiplied by 2 will be the minimal |a_{n-1}|.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find all possible factorizations"
