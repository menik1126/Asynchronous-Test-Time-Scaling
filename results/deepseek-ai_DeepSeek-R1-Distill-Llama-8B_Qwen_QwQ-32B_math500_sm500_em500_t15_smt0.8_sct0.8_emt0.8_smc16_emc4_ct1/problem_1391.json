            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under a matrix M. The matrix M transforms the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3) and the vector (1, -3) to (7, -1). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out what the matrix M looks like. Since it's a linear transformation from R^2 to R^2, it should be a 2x2 matrix. If I can find M, then I can apply it to the line y = 2x + 1 and find its image.\n\nSo, let's denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nWhen M acts on a vector v = [x; y], it gives M*v = [a x + b y; c x + d y]. \n\nGiven that M takes (2, -1) to (9, 3), that gives me two equations:\n\n1) a*2 + b*(-1) = 9\n2) c*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, M takes (1, -3) to (7, -1), which gives another two equations:\n\n3) a*1 + b*(-3) = 7\n4) c*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo, now I have four equations with four unknowns: a, b, c, d. I need to solve this system of equations to find M.\n\nLet me write them out again:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9  \nEquation 2: 2c - d = 3  \nEquation 3: a - 3b = 7  \nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nHmm, okay, maybe I can solve for a and b first using equations 1 and 3.\n\nFrom Equation 1: 2a - b = 9  \nFrom Equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nLet me solve Equation 3 for a: a = 7 + 3b\n\nNow substitute this into Equation 1:\n\n2*(7 + 3b) - b = 9  \n14 + 6b - b = 9  \n14"

Alternatively, I can parameterize the line and apply M to the parameterization.\n\nLet me try parameterizing the line. Let x = t, then y = 2t + 1. So any point on the line can be written as (t, 2t + 1).\n\nApplying M to this vector:\n\nM*(t, 2t + 1) = [4*t -1*(2t + 1); 2*t + 1*(2t + 1)]\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\nFirst component: 4t - (2t + 1) = 4t - 2t -1 = 2t -1  \nSecond component: 2t + (2t +1) = 2t + 2t +1"

Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept that the image of a line under a linear transformation is either a point (if the line is a singleton, which it's not) or a line or a line segment (if the transformation is not invertible), but since M is invertible (det(M) = (4)(1) - (-1)(2)=4 +2=6≠0), so M is invertible, so the image should be a line.\n\nSo, another approach is to find the image line by solving the equation M*v = w, where v is on y=2x +1, so v=(x, 2x +1). Then M*v = (4x - (2x +1), 2x + (2x +1)) = (2x -1, 4x +1). So, as before.\n\nSo, points (2x -1, 4x +1). Let me denote the image point as (X, Y). So,\n\nX = 2x -1  \nY = 4x +1\n\nWe can write x in terms of X: from X = 2x -1"

So that's the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of linear transformations and the line equation.\n\nThe original line is y = 2x +1. Let me write this in vector form. A line can be expressed as a point plus a direction vector. Let me see.\n\nThe line y = 2x +1 can be parametrized as:\n\nLet’s take a point on the line, say when x =0, y=1, so the point is (0,1). The direction vector of the line is (1, 2), since the slope is 2. So the parametrization is (0,1) + t*(1,2). So any point on the line is (t, 1 + 2t). Wait, that's similar to my previous parameterization except I used x = t here, so that's the same as before.\n\nSo, applying M to the point (t, 1 + 2t):\n\nM*(t, 1 + 2t) = [4t -1*(1 + 2t); 2t +1*(1 + 2t)]\n\nCompute first component: 4t - (1 + 2t) = 4t -1 -2t = 2t -1  \nSecond component: 2t +1 +2t = 4t +1\n\nSame as before. So, the image is (2t -1, 4t +1). So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the line as a set of vectors and use the transformation on the direction vector and the point.\n\nThe original line can be written as a point plus a direction vector. The direction vector is (1,2). The point is (0,1). So, the image of the line under M is the image of the point plus the image of the direction vector scaled by t.\n\nSo, image of the point (0,1) is M*(0,1) = (4*0 -1*1, 2*0 +1*1) = (-1"

So, the direction vector is (2,4), which can be simplified as (1,2) which is consistent with the original line's direction.\n\nSo, once I have the point (-1,1) and direction vector (2,4), I can write the parametric equations as:\n\nX = -1 + 2t  \nY = 1 +4t\n\nNow, eliminate t to get the equation in Y vs X.\n\nFrom X = -1 + 2t, solve for t: t = (X +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into Y: Y = 1 +4*( (X +1)/2 )  \n= 1 + 2*(X +1)  \n= 1 + 2X +2  \n= 2X +3\n\nSame result. So, the image is Y=2X+3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is y = 2x +3.
