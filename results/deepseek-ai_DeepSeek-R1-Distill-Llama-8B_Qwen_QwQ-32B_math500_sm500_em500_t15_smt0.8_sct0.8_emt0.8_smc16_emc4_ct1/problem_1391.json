I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this matrix M. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you apply a linear transformation to a line, the image is another line. So, I need to figure out how M transforms points on this line and then find the equation of that transformed line.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a linear transformation can be represented by a matrix. If I can find the matrix M, I can then apply it to any point on the original line to get the corresponding point on the image line. Once I have two points on the image line, I can determine its equation.\n\nThe problem gives me two vector transformations:\n- M takes [2, -1] to [9, 3]\n- M takes [1, -3] to [7, -1]\n\nSo, if I denote the matrix M as [[a, b], [c, d]], then applying M to [2, -1] should give [9, 3], and applying M to [1, -3] should give [7, -1]. \n\nLet me set up the equations:\n\n1. For the first transformation:\n   - a*2 + b*(-1) = 9\n   - c*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\n2. For the second transformation:\n   - a*1 + b*(-3) = 7\n   - c*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo, I have four equations here:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. 2c - d = 3\n3. a - 3b = 7\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nHmm, so I can solve for a and b from the first and third equations, and solve for c and d from the second and fourth equations.\n\nLet me start with a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nI can use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nLet me multiply equation 3 by 2 to make the coefficient of a equal to equation 1's coefficient.\n\nEquation 3 multiplied by 2: 2a - 6b = "

Let me double-check the transformations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nApplying M to [2, -1]:\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1) = 8 +1=9\n2*2 +1*(-1)=4 -1=3\nYes, that gives [9,3].\n\nApplying M to [1, -3]:\n4*1 + (-1)*(-3)=4 +3=7\n2*1 +1*(-3)=2 -3=-1\nYes, that gives [7,-1]. So, the matrix is correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the image of the line y=2x+1 under M. Since M is a linear transformation, it will transform the line into another line.

Maybe I can use another approach to confirm. Alternatively, since y=2x+1 is a line, perhaps the image under M can be found by solving the system Mv = w where v is on y=2x+1.\n\nWait, that might lead to the same result. Let me try.\n\nLet me denote a vector v = [x, y] on the line y=2x +1, so y=2x +1.\n\nApply M to v: Mv = [4x - y, 2x + y]. According to Mv, the transformed vector is [something, something].\n\nWait, no, wait: M is [[4, -1], [2, 1]], so Mv would be [4x -y, 2x + y].\n\nBut the image line is the set of all Mv where v is on y=2x +1.\n\nSo, the image is the set of points (4x - y, 2x + y) where y=2x +1.\n\nSo, let me substitute y=2x +1 into Mv:\n\nFirst component: 4x - (2x +1)=4x -2x -1=2x -1\n\nSecond component: 2x + (2x +1)=4x +1\n\nSo, the transformed coordinates (X, Y) are:\n\nX=2x -1\n\nY=4x +1\n\nNow, we can eliminate x to find Y in terms of X.\n\nFrom X=2x -1, solve for x: x=(X +1)/2\n\nPlug into Y: Y=4*(X +1)/2 +1= 2*(X +1)+1=2X +2 +1=2X +3\n\nSo, Y=2X +3\n\nThus, the image line is y=2x +3, which confirms our previous result.\n\nOkay, so both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that the image is y=2x +3.\n</think>\n\nTo find the image of the line \\( y = 2x + 1 \\) under the"
