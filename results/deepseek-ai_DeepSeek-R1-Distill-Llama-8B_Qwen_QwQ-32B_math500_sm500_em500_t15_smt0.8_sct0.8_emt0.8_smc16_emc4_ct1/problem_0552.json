            "output": "To determine the average price of Juan's 70s stamps, I'll follow these steps.\n\nFirst, I'll identify how many stamps he owns from each country during the 70s. From the chart, it looks like there are 12 stamps from Brazil, 12 from France, 12 from Peru, and 6 from Spain during that decade.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total cost of each country's stamps by multiplying the number of stamps by their respective prices. Brazil's total is 12 stamps at 6 cents each, which amounts to 72 cents. France's total is 12 stamps at 5 cents each, totaling 60 cents. Peru's total is also 12 stamps at 4 cents each, adding up to 48 cents. Spain has 6 stamps at 5 cents each, resulting in 30 cents.\n\nAdding all these totals together gives the combined cost of all 70s stamps: 72 + 60 + 48 + 30 = 210 cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the total number of stamps. There are 12 stamps from Brazil, 12 from France, 12 from Peru, and 6 from Spain, making a total of 42 stamps. Dividing 210 cents by 42 stamps yields an average of 5.0 cents per stamp.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70's** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the prices per country for the 70's stamps:**\n   - **Brazil:** 6 cents each\n   - **France:** 5 cents each\n   - **Peru:** 4 cents each\n   - **Spain:** 5 cents each\n\n2. **Determine the number of stamps for each country during the 70's:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 stamps\n   - **France:** 12 stamps\n   - **Peru:** 12 stamps\n   - **Spain:** 6 stamps\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost for each country:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\( 12 \\times 6 = 72 \\) cents\n   - **France:** \\( 12 \\times 5 = 60 \\) cents\n   - **Peru:** \\( 12 \\times 4 = 48 \\) cents\n   - **Spain:** \\( 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\"
