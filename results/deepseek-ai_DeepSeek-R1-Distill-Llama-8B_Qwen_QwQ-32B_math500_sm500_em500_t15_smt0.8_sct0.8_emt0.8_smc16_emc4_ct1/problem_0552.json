Looking at the chart, the 70s row shows the prices for each country:\n- Brazil: 12 cents\n- France: 12 cents\n- Peru: 12 cents\n- Spain: 13 cents\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total number of 70s stamps by adding these together. There are four countries, each with different quantities:\n- Brazil: 12 stamps\n- France: 12 stamps\n- Peru: 12 stamps\n- Spain: 13 stamps\n\nAdding these quantities gives a total of 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 = 49 stamps.\n\nThen, I'll compute the total cost for all the 70s stamps by multiplying the price of each country by the number of stamps and summing the results:\n- Brazil: 12 stamps × 12 cents = 144 cents\n- France: 12 stamps × 12 cents = 144 cents\n- Peru: 12 stamps × 12 cents = 144 cents\n- Spain: 13 stamps × 13 cents = 169 cents\n\nAdding these together, the total cost is 144 + 144 + 144 + 169 = 601 cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per 70s stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the number of stamps:\n601 cents ÷ 49 stamps ≈ 12.3 cents.\n\nSo, the average price of Juan's 70s stamps is approximately 12.3 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices and Quantities:**\n   - **Brazil (70s):** 12 stamps @ 12 cents each\n   - **France (70s):** 12 stamps @ 12 cents each\n   - **Peru (70s):** 12 stamps @ 12 cents each\n   - **Spain (70s):** 13 stamps @ 13 cents each\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\, (\\text{Brazil}) + 12 \\, (\\text{France}) + 12 \\, (\\text{Peru}) + 13 \\, (\\text{Spain"
