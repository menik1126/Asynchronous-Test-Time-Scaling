A fraction will result in a terminating decimal if, after simplifying, the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\nNext, I'll simplify the denominator. The given denominator is \\( 2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\). Since there are no other prime factors, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nNow, to convert the fraction to a decimal, I'll divide the numerator (21) by the denominator (\\( 2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\)). Calculating this division will give me the decimal equivalent of the fraction.\n\nAfter obtaining the decimal, I'll express it up to the required number of decimal places, ensuring that it accurately represents the value of the original fraction.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) into a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand Terminating Decimals\nA fraction will result in a **terminating decimal** if, after simplifying, the denominator has **no prime factors other than 2 and 5**. The fraction is already in its simplest form because there are no common factors between the numerator (21) and the denominator (\\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\)).\n\n### Step 2: Convert the Fraction to a Decimal\nNow, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21}{4 \\cdot 78125} = \\frac{21}{312500}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Decimal Value\n\\[\n\\frac{21}{312500} = 0.0000672\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0000672}\n\\]"
