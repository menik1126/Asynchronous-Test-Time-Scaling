The sequence is defined in a particular way: for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Also, I know that a_{13} is 2016, and I need to find a_1. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem. We have a sequence where every trio of terms at the odd and even positions form a geometric sequence, and every trio at the even and odd positions form an arithmetic sequence. That's a bit to unpack.\n\nLet me start by recalling what geometric and arithmetic sequences are. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. In an arithmetic sequence, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference.\n\nSo, for every k, the terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} are in geometric progression. That means:\n\na_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(a_{2k})^2 = a_{2k-1} * a_{2k+1}\n\nThat's the geometric condition.\n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic part, the terms a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} are in arithmetic progression. So:\n\na_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}\n\nSo, now I have two key relations for each k:\n\n1. (a_{2k})^2 = a_{2k-1} * a_{2k+1}  (Geometric)\n2. 2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}   (Arithmetic)\n\nI need to find a_1 given that a_{13} = 2016.\n\nSince the"

It alternates between geometric triples and arithmetic triples. Let's see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nMaybe I can express a_{2k+1} in terms of a_{2k} and a_{2k-1} from the geometric condition. From the geometric condition:\n\na_{2k+1} = (a_{2k})^2 / a_{2k-1}\n\nSimilarly, from the arithmetic condition:\n\na_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}\n\nSo, this seems recursive. Each new term depends on the previous ones.\n\nGiven that a_{13} is 2016, which is an even index, so 13 = 2k +1 when k=6. So, a_{13} is the last term of the geometric triple for k=6: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}.\n\nSo, for k=6, (a_{12})^2 = a_{11} * a_{13}\n\nWhich gives (a_{12})^2 = a_{11} * 2016\n\nBut 2016 is a_{13}, so that's part of it.\n\nAlso, from the arithmetic triple at k=6: a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14} must satisfy 2a_{13} = a_{12} + a_{14}, so a_{14} = 2*2016 - a_{12} = 4032 - a_{12}.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I know a_{14} is determined by a_{12}.\n\nNow, working backwards might be a good approach here because I know a_{13}=2016, so maybe I can find the terms before that.\n\nLet me try to express the terms in terms of the previous ones.\n\nFrom the geometric triple for k=5: a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11} is geometric.\n\nSimilarly, the arithmetic triple for k=5: a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12} is arithmetic.\n\nWait, but maybe starting from the beginning would be better.

So, if the geometric sequence has a ratio r, then a_{2k} = r * a_{2k-1}, and a_{2k+1} = r * a_{2k} = r^2 * a_{2k-1}.\n\nSubstituting, a_{2k}^2 = a_{2k-1} * a_{2k+1} implies (r a_{2k-1})^2 = a_{2k-1} * (r^2 a_{2k-1})\n\nWhich simplifies to r² a_{2k-1}² = r² a_{2k-1}², which is always true. So, the geometric ratio can be any r. So, that may not help directly.\n\nWait, but if each geometric triple has the same ratio, then maybe the entire sequence can be expressed in terms of geometric and arithmetic progressions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence follows a certain recurrence relation that can be expressed in terms of a1 and a2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is a combination of a geometric and an arithmetic sequence in a way that each pair alternates between geometric and arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the even terms form a geometric progression and the odd terms form an arithmetic progression, but that may not fit with the given conditions.\n\nWait, let me try another approach.\n\nFrom the geometric condition for each k, we have:\n\n(a_{2k})^2 = a_{2k"
