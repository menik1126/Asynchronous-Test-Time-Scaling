The problem says that for every positive integer k, two things happen:\n\n1. The subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is a geometric sequence.\n2. The subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAnd we're told that a₁₃ = 2016, and we need to find a₁.\n\nHmm, okay, let me try to break this down. First, let's recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\nA geometric sequence has each term after the first found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. So, if I have three terms in a geometric sequence, say b, c, d, then c = b*r and d = c*r = b*r². So the ratio is consistent.\n\nAn arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, has each term after the first obtained by adding a constant difference. So, for three terms in an arithmetic sequence, say e, f, g, then f = e + d and g = f + d = e + 2d, where d is the common difference.\n\nSo, for each k, we have two conditions:\n\n- a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric.\n- a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic.\n\nLet me see if I can model this for some small k, maybe k=1, k=2, etc., and find a pattern or recurrence.\n\nLet's start with k=1.\n\nFor k=1:\n- The geometric subsequence is a₁, a₂, a₃.\n- The arithmetic subsequence is a₂, a₃, a₄.\n\nSo, from the geometric part:\na₂ = a₁ * r₁\na₃ = a₂ * r₁ = a₁ * r₁²\n\nFrom the arithmetic part:\na₃ = a₂ + d₁\na₄ = a₃ + d₁ = a₂ + 2d₁\n\nBut wait, from the geometric sequence, a₃ = a₁ * r₁².

Therefore, r₁² - r₁ > 0 ⇒ r₁(r₁ - 1) > 0. Since r₁ is a positive integer (because we're dealing with positive integers and the sequence is strictly increasing; rational ratio would complicate, but since it's strictly increasing, r₁ must be at least 2? Wait, not necessarily, because maybe r₁ is a fraction, but since the terms are integers and strictly increasing, r₁ must be an integer greater than 1. Wait, but if a₁ is 1, then a₂ could be 2, a₃=4, which is possible. So r₁ must be an integer ≥2.\n\nWait, but let's see: If r₁ is 2, then d₁ = a₁*(4 - 2) = 2a₁, so d₁ is 2a₁.\n\nLet me consider that for the first step, r₁=2. So for k=1, a₂=2a₁, a₃=4a₁.
