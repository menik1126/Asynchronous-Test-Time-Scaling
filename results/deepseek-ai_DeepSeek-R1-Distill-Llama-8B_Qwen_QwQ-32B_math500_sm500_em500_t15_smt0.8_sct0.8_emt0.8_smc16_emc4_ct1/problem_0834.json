Hmm, this looks like an optimization problem with two variables. I remember that for functions of multiple variables, we can use techniques like taking partial derivatives and finding critical points. But before diving into calculus, maybe I should see if there's a way to simplify the problem or use some inequality.\n\nFirst, let me write down the function clearly:\n\\[\nf(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\n\\]\nI need to maximize this function. Since both the numerator and the denominator are functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), perhaps I can analyze their behaviors separately.\n\nThe numerator is \\(x - y\\). Without loss of generality, maybe I can consider cases where \\(x\\) is positive and \\(y\\) is negative because that would make the numerator positive. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can assume \\(x = y + k\\) where \\(k\\) is some constant, which would make the numerator \\(k\\). But I don't know if that substitution helps immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use substitution or introduce new variables. Let me think. Let me set \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = y\\), so the function is still the same. Not sure if that helps. Maybe consider polar coordinates? Since we have \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), maybe converting to polar coordinates would make it easier. Let me try that.\n\nIn polar coordinates, \\(x = r \\cos \\theta\\) and \\(y = r \\sin \\theta\\), where \\(r \\geq 0\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is between 0 and \\(2\\pi\\). Then, substituting into the function:\n\\[\nf(r, \\theta) = \\frac{r \\cos \\theta - r \\sin \\theta}{(r \\cos \\theta)^4 + (r \\sin \\theta)^4 + 6}\n\\]\nSimplify the denominator:\n\\[\n(r \\cos \\theta)^4 + (r \\sin \\theta)^4 + 6 = r^4 (\\cos^4 \\theta + \\sin^4 \\theta) + 6\n\\]\nSo the function becomes:\n"

The maximum for each \\(\\theta\\) would occur at some \\(r\\), and then we can maximize over \\(\\theta\\) as well.\n\nBut first, focusing on this one-variable function \\(f(r)\\) for fixed \\(C\\) and \\(D\\).

Let me set \\(g(k) = \\frac{1 - k}{2^{11/4} (1 + k^4)^{3/4}}\\). We need to maximize this over all real \\(k\\). However, note that in our substitution \\(y = k x\\), \\(k\\) can be any real number, but in the original problem, we have real \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), so \\(k\\) can be any real number. However, for the function \\(f(x, y)\\), when \\(k\\) is too large, the denominator becomes large, and the function value may decrease.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider \\(k\\) negative? No, because if \\(k\\) is very negative, \\(y = k x\\) would be a large negative number if \\(x\\) is positive, but then numerator \\(x - y = x - (k x)\\) would become \\(x (1 - k)\\). If \\(k\\) is negative, \\(1 - k\\) becomes greater than 1, so numerator is positive and increases as \\(|k|\\) increases, but the denominator would be \\(x^4 (1 + k^4) + 6\\), which also increases as \\(|k|\\) increases. It's a balance between the numerator and denominator.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider only positive \\(k\\) since \\(1 - k\\) is positive only if \\(k < 1\\). So, for \\(1 - k > 0\\), \\(k < 1\\). If \\(k >= 1\\), the numerator becomes non-positive, so the function would be non-positive, and since we are looking for maximum value, which is positive, likely occurs when \\(k < 1\\).\n\nBut actually, \\(k\\) can be negative too.
