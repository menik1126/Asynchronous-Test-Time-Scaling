            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here, and it says I need to find the maximum value of the expression (x - y) divided by (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) over all real numbers x and y. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably try to understand the structure of the problem. The expression is a fraction where the numerator is linear in x and y, and the denominator is a sum of fourth powers of x and y plus 6. Since it's asking for a maximum value, I might need to use some calculus or maybe some inequalities to approach it.\n\nLet me write down the function to make it clearer:\n\nF(x, y) = (x - y) / (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6)\n\nI need to find the maximum value of this function over all real numbers x and y. So, I guess I can consider this as an optimization problem in two variables. That might require taking partial derivatives with respect to x and y, setting them equal to zero, and solving the resulting equations. Alternatively, maybe there's a more elegant way using symmetry or other techniques. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try to see if the function is symmetric or if there's any symmetry between x and y that I can exploit. However, the numerator is x - y, which is not symmetric. The denominator is symmetric in x and y, though. So, perhaps I can consider substituting variables or finding a substitution that simplifies the problem.\n\nAnother idea: since the denominator is x⁴ + y⁴ + 6, which is always positive because x⁴ and y⁴ are non-negative for real numbers, and we're adding 6. So, the denominator is always at least 6. That means the sign of the function F(x, y) depends solely on the numerator, x - y. So, for F(x, y) to be positive, x must be greater than y, and if x < y, F(x, y) will be negative. Since we're looking for a maximum value, we can consider only the cases where x > y, because if x < y, the function will be negative, but the maximum might still be achieved when x is just slightly larger than y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use some inequality like Cauchy-Schwarz or"

Let's compute the partial derivatives of F with respect to x and y.\n\nFirst, let me denote the denominator as D = x⁴ + y⁴ + 6. Then, F = (x - y)/D.\n\nThe partial derivative of F with respect to x is:\n\n∂F/∂x = [ (1)(D) - (x - y)(4x³) ] / D²\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to y is:\n\n∂F/∂y = [ (-1)(D) - (x - y)(4y³) ] / D²\n\nTo find critical points, we set both partial derivatives equal to zero. So, setting the numerators equal to zero:\n\nFor ∂F/∂x = 0:\n\n1 * D - (x - y)(4x³) = 0\n\n=> D = 4x³(x - y)\n\nSimilarly, for ∂F/∂y = 0:\n\n-1 * D - (x - y)(4y³) = 0\n\n=> -D = 4y³(x - y)\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) D = 4x³(x - y)\n\n2) -D = 4y³(x - y)\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: x⁴ + y⁴ + 6 = 4x³(x - y)\n\nEquation 2: - (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) = 4y³(x - y)\n\nHmm, so if I add equations 1 and 2 together, maybe something cancels?\n\nAdding equation 1 and equation 2:\n\nLeft side: (x⁴ + y⁴ +6) + (-x⁴ - y⁴ -6) = 0\n\nRight side: 4x³(x - y) + 4y³(x - y) = 4(x - y)(x³ + y³)\n\nTherefore, 0 = 4(x - y)(x³ + y³)\n\nSo, either x - y = 0 or x³ + y³ = 0.\n\nCase 1: x - y = 0\n\nIf x ="
