Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a tangent line to both a circle and a parabola will touch each of them at exactly one point. So, the four points of tangency must lie on both curves. That means each point (x, y) must satisfy both equations, but since they're points of tangency, they also lie on a common tangent line.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily be the case. Maybe each tangent line touches the circle at one point and the parabola at another point. So, actually, for each tangent line, it touches the circle at one point and the parabola at another point. So, we have two tangent lines from the circle to the parabola, each touching both curves. That gives us four points: two on the circle and two on the parabola, connected by two tangent lines.\n\nSo, I need to find these tangent lines. How do I find the equations of the tangent lines to both the circle and the parabola?\n\nI remember that the equation of a tangent line to a parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\) is \\( y = mx + a/m \\). In this case, the parabola is \\( y^2 = 8x \\), so \\( 4a = 8 \\) which means \\( a = 2 \\). So, the tangent lines to the parabola would have equations \\( y = mx + 2/m \\).\n\nNow, for the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\), the condition for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be tangent to the circle is that the distance from the center (which is at (0,0)) to the line is equal to the radius, which is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). The formula for the distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line \\( Ax + By + C = 0 \\) is \\( |Ax₀ + By₀ + C| / \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\). So, applying this to our line \\( y = mx + c"

This must equal the radius \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), so:\n\n\\( |c| / \\sqrt{m^2 + 1} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( |c| = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{m^2 + 1} \\), so \\( c = \\pm \\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)} \\).\n\nBut we also know that the tangent line must be tangent to the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\), so its equation is \\( y = mx + 2/m \\). Comparing this with the line equation \\( y = mx + c \\), we see that \\( c = 2/m \\).\n\nTherefore, substituting \\( c = 2/m \\) into the equation from the circle's tangent condition:\n\n\\( |2/m| = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{m^2 + 1} \\)\n\nLet me drop the absolute value for a moment and square both sides to eliminate the square roots and absolute value:\n\n\\( (2/m)^2 = 2(m^2 + 1) \\)\n\nSimplify left side: \\( 4/m² = 2m² + 2 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by m² to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\( 4 = 2m⁴ + 2m² \\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( 2m⁴ + 2m² - 4 = 0 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( m⁴ + m² - 2 = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, this is a quartic equation, but maybe I can substitute \\( u = m² \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\( u² + u - 2 = 0 \\)\n\nSolving for u:\n\nUsing quadratic formula: \\( u = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [-1 ± 3]/2 \\)\n\nSo, possible solutions:\n\n\\( u = (-1 + 3)/2 = 1 \\)\n\n\\( u = (-1 - "

So, \\( u = 1 \\), which gives \\( m² = 1 \\) so \\( m = 1 \\) or \\( m = -1 \\).\n\nSo, the slopes of the tangent lines are 1 and -1.\n\nThen, using \\( c = 2/m \\), for \\( m=1 \\), \\( c=2 \\), so the equation is \\( y = x + 2 \\).\n\nFor \\( m=-1 \\), \\( c = -2 \\), so the equation is \\( y = -x - 2 \\).\n\nWait, but this seems a bit confusing because the Asymptote code given in the problem shows points at (-1,1), (2,4), (-1,-1), (2,-4). Let me check if these points lie on both the circle and parabola.\n\nFirst, check if (2,4) is on the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\): 4² = 16, and 8*2 =16, so yes. Also, (-1,1): 1²=1, 8*(-1)=-8.

So, points A and C are (-1,1) and (-1,-1), which when plugged into the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\) check as follows: (-1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1=2, which is correct. Similarly for (-1,-1).\n\nBut for the parabola, \\( y^2 = 8x \\) at (2,4): 4²=16, and 8*2=16, so that's correct. Similarly, (2,-4) is on the parabola.\n\nWait, but for (-1,1): 1²=1, 8*(-1)=-8, so 1≠-8. So, that point is not on the parabola. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe"

So, the four points of tangency are two on the circle and two on the parabola? Wait, but the problem says \"forming four points of tangency\", so maybe each tangent line has two points of tangency, one on each curve. So, two tangent lines, each with two points (one on circle, one on parabola), so total four points. So, the quadrilateral is formed by connecting these four points.\n\nTherefore, the points of tangency on the circle and parabola are the four vertices of the quadrilateral. So, to find the area, I need to find the coordinates of these four points.\n\nSo, first, let's find the tangent lines. We found that the slopes are m=1 and m=-1, so the tangent lines are y = x + 2 and y = -x -2.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that these lines are indeed tangent to both curves.\n\nFirst, check for the line y = x + 2.\n\nCheck if it's tangent to the circle x² + y² = 2.\n\nSubstitute y = x + 2 into the circle equation:\n\nx² + (x + 2)^2 = 2\n\nExpand: x² + x² +4x +4 = 2\n\n2x² +4x +4 -2 =0 → 2x² +4x +2 =0 → divide by 2: x² +2x +1 =0 → (x+1)^2 =0 → x = -1.

So, the point on the circle is (-1,-2). Wait, no. Wait, y = -x -2, so if x=-1, y = -(-1) -2 =1 -2 =-1. So, point (-1,-1), which is point C.\n\nSimilarly, on the parabola y²=8x, plug in y=-x -2:\n\n(-x -2)^2 =8x →x² +4x +4=8x →x²-4x +4=0 →(x-2)^2=0 →x=2. So, y=-2 -2=-4.

So, area is 30/2=15.\n\nAh, I see, I added correctly the second time. So, area is indeed 15.\n\nWait, so regardless of the order, if I arrange the points correctly, I get 15. So, 15 is the answer.\n\nLet me confirm once more:\n\nAnother approach: find the coordinates of the four points of tangency, then apply the shoelace formula. The points are A (-1,1), B (2,4), C (-1,-1), D (2,-4). When connected in order A-B-D-C-A, the shoelace formula gives an area of 15.\n\nTherefore, the area of the quadrilateral is 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe area of the quadrilateral formed by the four points of tangency is \\boxed{15}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the four points of tangency between the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\) and the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\), we first determine the equations of the common tangent lines.\n\n1. **Equation of Tangent Lines to the Parabola**:\n   The parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\) has tangent lines of the form \\( y = mx + \\frac{2}{m} \\).\n\n2. **Condition for Tangency to the Circle**:\n   The distance from the center of the circle (0,0) to the tangent line \\( y = mx + \\frac{2}{m} \\) must equal the radius \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). This condition gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\left| \\frac{2}{m}"
