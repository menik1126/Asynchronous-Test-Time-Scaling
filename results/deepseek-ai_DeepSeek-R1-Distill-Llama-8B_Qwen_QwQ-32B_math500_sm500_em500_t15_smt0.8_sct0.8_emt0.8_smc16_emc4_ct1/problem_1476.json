I remember that when dealing with roots and simplifying, it's helpful to express everything in terms of exponents so I can manipulate them using exponent rules. So, first, let me rewrite each root as a fractional exponent.\n\nThe innermost part is the square root of 1/729. A square root is the same as raising to the power of 1/2. So, \u221a(1/729) is equal to (1/729)^(1/2). Then, that entire expression is inside a cube root, which is the same as raising to the power of 1/3. So, the cube root of [(1/729)^(1/2)] would be [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3). \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing that right. If I have a square root outside, it's exponent 1/2, and then a cube root outside that, which is exponent 1/3. So, the exponents multiply. So, 1/2 times 1/3 is 1/6. So, that part becomes (1/729)^(1/6).\n\nHold on, let me confirm. If I have ((a^b)^c), that's a^(b*c). So, yes, that applies here. So, \u221a(\u221a(1/729)) is ((1/729)^(1/2))^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6). Got that.\n\nNow, the next step is to simplify (1/729)^(1/6). Well, 729 is a number I recognize. It's 9^3 because 9*9=81, 81*9=729. But wait, 9 is 3^2, so 729 is (3^2)^3 = 3^(2*3) = 3^6. So, 729 is 3^6.\n\nTherefore, 1/729 is 1/(3^6). So, (1/(3^6))^(1/6). When you raise a fraction to an exponent, both numerator and denominator get raised to that exponent. So"

Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\nStarting over:\n\nOriginal expression: sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nFirst, innermost: sqrt(1/729). Since sqrt(a) = a^(1/2), so (1/729)^(1/2). \n\nThen, cube root of that result: [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n\nThen, the outermost sqrt: sqrt( [ (1/729)^(1/6) ] ) = [ (1/729)^(1/6) ]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12). Wait, hold on! Wait, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, the original problem is sqrt{ cube_root{ sqrt{1/729} } }, so the order is sqrt applied to the cube root of the sqrt. So, the cube root is inside the sqrt. Wait, so the cube root is the inner one? Wait, let me parse the original expression again.\n\nThe question is written as sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). So, the cube root is inside the square root. So, the order is: first take the square root of 1/729, then take the cube root of that result, then take the square root of that result. \n\nWait, so the exponents would be:\n\nFirst step: sqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2)\n\nSecond step: cube_root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6)\n\nThird step: sqrt of that is [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729"

            "output": ")^(1/12)\n\nWait, that's in conflict with my initial thought. So, perhaps I misread the expression.\n\nWait, 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is 1/(3^6). So, (1/(3^6))^(1/12) is equal to 1/(3^(6/12)) = 1/(3^(1/2)) = 1/sqrt(3).\n\nWait, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, let me redo the exponents:\n\nsqrt(cube_root(sqrt(1/729))) = [cube_root(sqrt(1/729))]^(1/2).\n\nBut sqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2) = 1/(729^(1/2)) = 1/(27) because 729 is 27 squared. Wait, 27 squared is 729, yes.\n\nSo, sqrt(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nSo, then cube_root(1/27). Hmm, 1/27 is 3^(-3), so cube_root(3^(-3)) is 3^(-1) because cube_root is exponent 1/3. So, 3^(-1) is 1/3.\n\nSo, then, sqrt of that is sqrt(1/3) which is (1/3)^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(3). Alternatively, rationalize the denominator, that's sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused. So, two different approaches give me two different results. Hmm, why?\n\nWait, probably I made a mistake in the first approach in handling the exponents. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the original expression is sqrt{ cube_root{ sqrt{1/729} } }, which is:\n\n= sqrt{ cube_root{ sqrt(1/729) } }\n\nLet me compute the innermost sqrt first:\n\nsqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2) = 1/(sqrt(729)). But sqrt(729) is 27 because 27^2 is 729. So, sqrt(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nThen, cube_root of 1/27 is (1/27)^(1/3) = 1/(3) because 27 is 3^3, so cube root of"

So, 1/sqrt(3) is irrational, so we need to rationalize it. Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\n(1 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/3. \n\nTherefore, the simplified form with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought of exponents as multiplying all the way, but I must have messed up the order. Let me see:\n\nOriginal expression: sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nExpressed as exponents:\n\nFirst, sqrt(1/729) is (1/729)^{1/2}\n\nThen, cube_root of that is [(1/729)^{1/2}]^{1/3} = (1/729)^{1/6}\n\nThen, sqrt of that is [(1/729)^{1/6}]^{1/2} = (1/729)^{1/12}\n\nHmm, so that's (1/729)^{1/12}\n\nBut 729 is 3^6, so substituting:\n\n(1/(3^6))^{1/12} = 1^{1/12}/(3^{6*(1/12)}) = 1/(3^{0.5}) = 1/sqrt(3). \n\nAh, so that's the same as before. So, both methods agree. So, the result is 1/sqrt(3), which needs to be rationalized to sqrt(3)/3. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but let me check again step by step numerically to be sure.\n\nLet me compute each step numerically:\n\nFirst, compute sqrt(1/729):\n\n1/729 \u2248 0.001371742...\n\nsqrt(0.001371742) \u2248 0.03703"

Let's approximate. 0.03703 \u2248 (0.3)^3 * 1.37 approximately. So cube root would be about 0.3 * (1.37)^(1/3). Since 1.37^(1/3) is approximately 1.1, so 0.3*1.1 \u2248 0.33. So, cube_root \u2248 0.33.\n\nThen, sqrt(0.33) \u2248 0.5745.\n\nBut sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/3 is about 0.577, which is close to 0.5745. So, that supports the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute 1/sqrt(3) \u2248 0.57735, which is consistent.\n\nSo, both the symbolic and numerical approaches give me 1/sqrt(3), which rationalized is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSo, the steps I should write are:\n\n1. Start with the innermost square root: sqrt(1/729) = 1/27.\n\n2. Then, take the cube root of 1/27: cube_root(1/27) = 1/3.\n\n3. Finally, take the square root of 1/3: sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3).\n\n4. Rationalize the denominator: 1/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nAlternatively, using exponents:\n\nEach root corresponds to an exponent:\n\nsqrt(x) = x^(1/2), cube_root(x) = x^(1/3), and the outer sqrt is again x^(1/2).\n\nSo, the entire expression can be written as:\n\n[(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3))^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nSince 729 = 3^6, we have:\n\n("

Let me just check once more.\n\nWait, 729 is 9^3, which is 3^6. So, 1/729 is 3^(-6). Then, raising that to the 1/12 power gives 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-0.5) = 1/sqrt(3). Yep.
