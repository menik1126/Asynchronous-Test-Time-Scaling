Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the original expression to make it clearer:\n\n√[ ∛(√(1/729)) ]\n\nWait, actually, the original problem is √[ ∛(√(1/729)) ]. So, it's a square root of a cube root of another square root. I need to simplify this and write it with a rational denominator. \n\nAlright, starting from the inside, I have √(1/729). Let me figure that out first. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729. Hmm, 729 is 9^3 because 9*9=81, 81*9=729. So, √729 is 27 since 27*27=729. But wait, no, 27 squared is 729, so √729 is 27. So, √(1/729) would be 1/27. Because √(a/b) is √a / √b, so √1 is 1, and √729 is 27, so 1/27.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes ∛(1/27). Let me compute that. The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 27 is 3 because 3*3*3=27. So, ∛(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nNow, the original expression is √(1/3). Wait, no, hold on. Let me clarify the order because I think I misread it. The original expression is sqrt of (cube root of (sqrt(1/729))). So, I did the innermost first, which was sqrt(1/729) = 1/27, then cube root of 1/27 is 1/3, and then the square root of 1/3.\n\nHmm, so now I have sqrt(1/3). How do I write that with a rational denominator? Well, sqrt(1/3) is the same as 1/sqrt(3). But we don't like having a square root in the denominator. To rationalize the denominator, I multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\n(1"

But let me check again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Compute the innermost radical: sqrt(1/729). Since sqrt(1) = 1 and sqrt(729) = 27, so that's 1/27. Correct.\n\n2. Then take the cube root of that result: ∛(1/27). Since 3^3 = 27, so cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. That's right.\n\n3. Then take the square root of 1/3: sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3). Rationalizing the denominator gives sqrt(3)/3. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way to approach this by expressing everything with exponents instead of radicals? Let me try that method to confirm.\n\nExpressing each radical as exponents:\n\nThe original expression is sqrt(∛(√(1/729))).\n\nFirst, √(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2).\n\nThen, the cube root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n\nThen, taking the square root of that result: [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nHmm, so the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12). Let me see if that's the same as sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, let's compute (1/729)^(1/12). Since 729 is 9^3, which is 3^6. So 729 = 3^6. Therefore, 1/729 = 3^(-6). So (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6*(1/12))"

            "output": " = 3^(-1/2) = 1/√3 = √3/3. So, same result. So that's correct.\n\nSo, either way, whether I do it step by step or convert to exponents, I get sqrt(3)/3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express 729 as 3^6, since 3^6 = 729. So, 1/729 is 3^(-6). Let me see:\n\nStarting again:\n\n√(∛(√(1/729))) = √(∛(3^{-6})) = √(3^{-6 * 1/3}) = √(3^{-2}) = (3^{-2})^{1/2} = 3^{-1} = 1/3.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I must have messed up the exponents somewhere. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nStart with sqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^{1/2} = (3^{-6})^{1/2} = 3^{-3} = 1/27.\n\nThen, cube root of that: (1/27)^{1/3} = (3^{-3})^{1/3} = 3^{-1} = 1/3.\n\nThen, sqrt(1/3) = (1/3)^{1/2} = 3^{-1/2} = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, both methods give me the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that sqrt(3)/3 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me compute numerically.\n\nCompute 1/729: that's approximately 0.001371742.\n\nTake the square root of that: sqrt(0.001371742) ≈ 0.037037.\n\nThen, take the cube root of 0.037037. Let me compute that. Cube root of 0.037037 is approximately 0.33.\n\nThen, take the square root of 0.33: sqrt(0.33) ≈ 0.5745.\n\nNow, sqrt(3)/3 is approximately 1.73205 / 3 ≈ 0.57735. Hmm, so my approximate value is 0.5745, which is close"

Maybe due to rounding errors in each step.\n\nLet me compute more precisely:\n\nFirst step: sqrt(1/729) = 1/27 ≈ 0.037037037.\n\nSecond step: cube root of 1/27 is 1/3 ≈ 0.333333333.\n\nThird step: sqrt(1/3) ≈ sqrt(0.333333333) ≈ 0.577350269.\n\nSo, the exact value is sqrt(3)/3 ≈ 0.57735, which matches. The earlier approximation was just due to rounding each step. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me check once more.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nsqrt(∛(√(1/729))) \n\nStep 1: √(1/729) = 1/27.\n\nStep 2: ∛(1/27) = 1/3.\n\nStep 3: √(1/3) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is sqrt(3)/3, which is written as \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to combine the exponents from the start?\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe entire expression can be written as:\n\n( ( ( (1/729)^{1/2} )^{1/3} )^{1/2} )\n\nWait, order of operations: the innermost is (1/729)^{1/2}, then that result is raised to 1/3, then that result is raised to 1/2. So overall exponent is (1/2)*(1/3)*(1/2) ?\n\nWait, no, actually, the exponents multiply step by step. Let me see:\n\nFirst exponent: 1/2 (from the first square root).\n\nThen, the cube root is exponent 1/3, so total exponent so far is (1/2)*(1/3) = 1/6.\n\nThen, the outer square root is exponent 1/2, so total exponent"
