The line is parameterized, but I don't have the actual parametric equations here. Hmm, maybe I can figure it out from the Asymptote code provided.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, I see that points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are given as \\( A = (-5,4) \\) and \\( B = (-1,3) \\). The line passes through these two points. Also, the direction vector is derived from the difference between these points.\n\nSo, the direction vector can be found by subtracting the coordinates of point \\( A \\) from point \\( B \\). Let me compute that:\n\nThe change in \\( x \\) is \\( (-1) - (-5) = (-1 + 5) = 4 \\).\n\nThe change in \\( y \\) is \\( 3 - 4 = -1 \\).\n\nSo the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the direction vector should be \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). That means the direction vector I computed must be a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nSo, if \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), there must be some scalar \\( k \\) such that:\n\n\\( 4 = k \\times (-7) \\)\n\nand\n\n\\( -1 = k \\times b \\).\n\nLet me solve for \\( k \\) first using the \\( x \\)-component:\n\n\\( 4 = -7k \\)\n\nSo, \\( k = \\frac{4}{-7} = -\\frac{4}{7} \\).\n\nNow, plug this value of \\( k \\) into the \\( y \\)-component equation:\n\n\\( -1 = k \\times b \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( k = -\\frac{4}{7} \\):\n\n\\( -1 = -\\frac{4}{7"

The direction vector from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is indeed \\( (4, -1) \\), which I got by subtracting \\( B \\)'s coordinates from \\( A \\)'s. Then, setting up the scalar multiple because the direction vectors must be parallel. Solved for \\( k \\) correctly: \\( k = -4/7 \\). Then, substituted into the \\( y \\)-component equation, resulting in \\( b = 7/4 \\). Hmm, that seems right.\n\nJust to confirm, maybe I can think about the slope of the line. The direction vector \\( (4, -1) \\) has a slope of \\( -1/4 \\). The given direction vector \\( (-7, b) \\) would have a slope of \\( b/(-7) = -b/7 \\). Since the slopes must be equal, \\( -1/4 = -b/7 \\), which leads to \\( 1/4 = b/7 \\), so \\( b = 7/4 \\). Yep, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, \\( b \\) must be \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of \\( b \\) in the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), we first calculate the direction vector of the line passing through points \\( A = (-5, 4) \\) and \\( B = (-1, 3) \\). The direction vector is found by subtracting the coordinates of \\( A \\) from \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Direction vector} = \\begin{pmatrix} (-1) - (-5) \\\\ 3 - 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSince this direction vector must be a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -"
