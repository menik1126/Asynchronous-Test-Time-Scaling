            "output": "First, I'll define variables for the number of blue and yellow marbles initially in the bag. Let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles. So, I can express this relationship with the equation:\n\nB / Y = 4 / 3\n\nNext, I'll add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles. This changes the number of blue marbles to B + 5 and the number of yellow marbles to Y - 3. The new ratio of blue to yellow marbles becomes 7:3. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n(B + 5) / (Y - 3) = 7 / 3\n\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1. B / Y = 4 / 3\n2. (B + 5) / (Y - 3) = 7 / 3\n\nI'll solve the first equation for B in terms of Y. Multiplying both sides by Y gives:\n\nB = (4/3) Y\n\nNow, I'll substitute B = (4/3) Y into the second equation:\n\n( (4/3) Y + 5 ) / (Y - 3 ) = 7 / 3\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 3(Y - 3):\n\n3((4/3) Y + 5) = 7(Y - 3)\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21\n\nSubtracting 4Y from both sides:\n\n15 = 3Y - 21\n\nAdding 21 to both sides:\n\n36 = 3Y\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\nY = 12\n\nNow that I know Y is 12, I'll find B:\n\nB = (4/3) * 12 = 16\n\nSo, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before adding more.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = number of blue marbles initially\n- \\( Y \\) = number of yellow marbles initially\n\n**Step 1:** According to the problem, the initial ratio of blue"
