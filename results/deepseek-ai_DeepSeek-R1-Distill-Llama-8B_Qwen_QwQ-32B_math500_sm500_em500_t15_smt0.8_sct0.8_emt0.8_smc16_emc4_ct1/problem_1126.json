            "output": "First, I need to determine the speed of the robot based on the initial information. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. To find its speed in meters per hour, I'll convert kilometers to meters and hours to hours.\n\nNext, I should calculate the speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. This will give me the robot's speed in meters per hour.\n\nOnce I have the speed, I can use it to find out how long it takes the robot to travel a certain distance. In this case, the hallway's length is the distance we need to find.\n\nFinally, I'll use the time taken to travel the hallway length and the speed to calculate the length of the hallway in meters.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n- It takes 90 seconds to travel the length of a hallway.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Robot's Speed**\nFirst, determine the speed of the robot in meters per hour.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1\\ \\text{km}}{2.5\\ \\text{hours}}\n\\]\n\nConvert kilometers to meters:\n\n\\[\n1\\ \\text{km} = 1000\\ \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{1000\\ \\text{meters}}{2.5\\ \\text{hours}} = 400\\ \\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{hour}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Convert Time to Hours**\nThe time taken to travel the hallway is given in seconds. Convert 90 seconds to hours.\n\n\\[\n90\\ \\text{seconds} = \\frac{90}{3600}\\ \\text{hours} = 0.025\\ \\text{hours}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Length of the Hallway**\nUsing the speed and time, find the distance (length of the hallway).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 400\\ \\frac{\\text{meters}}{\\text{hour}} \\times 0.025\\ \\text{hours} = 10\\ \\text{meters}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed"
