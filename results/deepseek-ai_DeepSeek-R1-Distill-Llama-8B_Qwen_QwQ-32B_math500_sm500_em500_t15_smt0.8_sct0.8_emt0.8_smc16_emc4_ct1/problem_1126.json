            "output": "First, I'll identify the key information provided in the problem. The robot travels at a constant speed and covers 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. This allows me to calculate the robot's speed.\n\nNext, I'll determine the speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. Converting the time into hours and the distance into meters will make the calculation consistent and easier to work with.\n\nOnce I have the speed, I can use it to find the length of the hallway. Knowing that the robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway length, I'll convert this time into hours to match the speed's time unit.\n\nFinally, by multiplying the speed by the converted time, I'll obtain the length of the hallway in meters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of the hallway, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n- The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the length of the hallway.\n\n**Step 1:** Calculate the speed of the robot.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}} = 0.4 \\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Convert the speed to meters per second (m/s) for consistency with the hallway travel time given in seconds.\n\nFirst, convert kilometers to meters:\n\n\\[\n0.4 \\text{ km/h} = 400 \\text{ meters/hour}\n\\]\n\nNext, convert hours to seconds:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ hour} = 3600 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{400 \\text{ meters}}{3600 \\text{ seconds}} \\approx 0.1111 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Use the speed to find the length of the hallway.\n\nGiven that the robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length of hallway} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 0.1111 \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ s} \\approx 10 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe hallway is \\(\\boxed{10}\\) meters long."
