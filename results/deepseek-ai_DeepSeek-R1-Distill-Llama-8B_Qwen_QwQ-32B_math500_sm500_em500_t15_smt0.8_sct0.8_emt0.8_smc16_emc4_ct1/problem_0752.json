            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. The sequence is a1, a2, a3, and so on. The problem says that for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Also, it's given that a_{13} is 2016, and I need to find a1.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what geometric and arithmetic subsequences mean. A geometric sequence has each term multiplied by a common ratio, right? So, if I have three terms in a geometric sequence, the middle term squared equals the product of the first and the third. That is, a^2 = b*c.\n\nOn the other hand, an arithmetic sequence has each term added by a common difference. So, for three terms in an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the average of the first and the third. That is, 2b = a + c.\n\nSo, for every k, the terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} form a geometric sequence, and the terms a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSince the entire sequence is strictly increasing, all terms must be positive integers, and each term is larger than the previous one.\n\nGiven that a_{13} = 2016, I need to find a1. So I should probably try to express a_{13} in terms of a1 by relating the terms through these geometric and arithmetic conditions.\n\nLet me try to write down the relationships for some initial k values to see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nLet's start with k=1.\n\nFor k=1:\n- The geometric subsequence is a1, a2, a3. So, a2^2 = a1 * a3.\n- The arithmetic subsequence starting at a2 is a2, a3, a4. So, 2a3 = a2 + a4. Hence, a4 = 2a3 - a2.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2:\n- Geometric: a3"

So, a6^2 = a5 * a7.\n- Arithmetic: a6, a7, a8. So, a8 = 2a7 - a6.\n\nAnd so on, until k=6:\n- Since a13 is given, maybe k=6? Let's see.\n\nWait, for k=6, the geometric subsequence would be a11, a12, a13, and the arithmetic subsequence would be a12, a13, a14. But since we don't know a14, maybe we don't need to go that far. Or maybe the pattern can be extended further.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a recursive relation or express each term in terms of the previous ones.\n\nLet me denote d_k as the common difference for the arithmetic part when k=1,2,... but maybe that's more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express each pair of terms (a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}) in terms of the previous a_{2k-1}.\n\nWait, from the geometric sequence:\n\nFor k=1: a2^2 = a1 * a3. (Equation 1)\n\nFrom the arithmetic sequence: a4 = 2a3 - a2. (Equation 2)\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: a4^2 = a3 * a5. (Equation 3)\n\nAnd a6 = 2a5 - a4. (Equation 4)\n\nFor k=3: a6^2 = a5 * a7. (Equation 5)\n\na8 = 2a7 - a6.

Then, let's try to express the next terms in terms of x.\n\nStarting with k=1:\n\nFirst, the geometric sequence a1, a2, a3. So, a2^2 = a1 * a3. Let me denote a2 as some multiple of a1.

Therefore, a4 = a3 + (a3 - a2) = 2a3 - a2 = 2*(r1^2 a1) - r1 a1 = (2r1^2 - r1) a1.\n\nSo, a4 is (2r1^2 - r1) a1.\n\nNow moving to k=2:\n\nThe geometric sequence is a3, a4, a5. So, a4^2 = a3 * a5.

So, (9856)^2= (16^2)*(616)^2=256*616^2.\n\n(6776)^2=(11^2)*(616)^2=121*616^2.\n\nThus, (9856)^2 /6776= (256*616^2)/(121*616^2)=256/121= (16^2)/(11^2)= (16/11)^2.\n\nBut 256/121 is 2.147 approx, which is not integer. So, a5 is not an integer, which violates the condition that the sequence consists of positive integers. So, this case is invalid.\n\nTherefore, d=1 does not work.\n\nSimilarly, let's try d=4:\n\nThen, (6r1 -5)^2=4→6r1 -5=2→r1=(2+5)/6=7/6.\n\nThen, x=2016/4=504.\n\nNow, check the sequence:\n\na1=504.\n\na2= r1*a1= (7/6)*504= 7*84=588.\n\na3=(a2)^2 /a1= (588)^2 /504.\n\nCompute 588/504=7/6. So, (7/6)^2=49/36. Thus, a3=49/36 *504=49*(14)=686.\n\na3=686.\n\na4=2a3 -a2=2*686 -588=1372 -588=784.\n\na4=784.\n\na5= (a4)^2 /a3=784^2 /686.\n\nCheck if 784/686= 16/11.\n\nSo, 16^2=256, 11^2=121. Thus, 256/121, so a5=256/121 *686= (256*686)/121= (256*5.666...) Wait, but 686 ÷121=5.666..., which is 17/3. So, 256*(17/3)= 4352/3, which is not integer. So, a5 is not integer. Thus, invalid.\n\nHence, d=4 also doesn't work.\n\nProceeding to d=9:\n\n(6r1 -5)^2=9→6r1 -5"
