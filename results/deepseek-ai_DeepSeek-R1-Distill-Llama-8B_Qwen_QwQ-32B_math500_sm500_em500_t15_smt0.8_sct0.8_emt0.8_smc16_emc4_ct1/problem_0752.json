The sequence is denoted as \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots\\), and it has some specific properties. \n\nFirst, for every positive integer \\(k\\), the subsequence \\(a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}\\) is a geometric sequence. That means each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. Also, the subsequence \\(a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}\\) is an arithmetic sequence, which means each term is obtained by adding a common difference.\n\nGiven that \\(a_{13} = 2016\\), I need to find \\(a_1\\). Hmm, okay, let's see. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, each term must be larger than the one before it.\n\nLet me try to write down what I know from the given properties.\n\nFor any \\(k\\), the geometric sequence gives:\n\\[\n\\frac{a_{2k}}{a_{2k-1}} = \\frac{a_{2k+1}}{a_{2k}} = r_k \\quad \\text{(some ratio)}\n\\]\nSo, we can express \\(a_{2k}\\) as \\(a_{2k-1} \\times r_k\\) and \\(a_{2k+1}\\) as \\(a_{2k} \\times r_k = a_{2k-1} \\times r_k^2\\).\n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1} = a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = d_k \\quad \\text{(some common difference)}\n\\]\nSo, \\(a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k\\) and \\(a_{2k} = a_{2k+1} - d_k\\).\n\nWait, hold on. I think I made a mistake there. If the arithmetic sequence is \\(a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}\\), the common difference should be \\(a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+"

Let me try substituting.\n\nFrom the geometric sequence:\n- \\(a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \\times r_k\\)\n- \\(a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} \\times r_k = a_{2k-1} \\times r_k^2\\)\n\nFrom the arithmetic sequence:\n- \\(a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + (a_{2k+1} - a_{2k})\\)\n- Simplify that: \\(a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}\\)\n\nBut \\(a_{2k+1} = a_{2k-1} r_k^2\\), and \\(a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} r_k\\). So:\n- \\(a_{2k+2} = 2a_{2k-1} r_k^2 - a_{2k-1} r_k = a_{2k-1} (2 r_k^2 - r_k)\\)\n\nHmm, so \\(a_{2k+2} = a_{2k-1} (2 r_k^2 - r_k)\\).\n\nWait a second, this might help me relate terms in the sequence with their earlier terms. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, each ratio \\(r_k\\) must be greater than 1 because each term is larger than the previous.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern or perhaps a constant ratio or difference that might be consistent across all \\(k\\). If the ratios \\(r_k\\) are the same for all \\(k\\), maybe the sequence could have a repeating structure, making it easier to find \\(a_1\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if the ratio is constant.
