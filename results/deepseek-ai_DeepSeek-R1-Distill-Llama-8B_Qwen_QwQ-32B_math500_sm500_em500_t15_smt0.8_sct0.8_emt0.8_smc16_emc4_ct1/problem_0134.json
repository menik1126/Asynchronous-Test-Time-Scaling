            "output": "First, I need to understand what the superfactorial is. The superfactorial of a number n, denoted as n\\$, is a tower of factorials that continues down to n!. So, for 4\\$, it would be 4!^(4!^(...)) with a total of 4! levels.\n\nStarting from the top, I'll calculate each level step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The innermost factorial is 4! = 24. So, 4\\$ starts with 24.\n\n2. Next level up, we have 24! which is an enormous number, but I don't need its full value—I just need its units digit. The units digit of 24! can be found using properties of factorials modulo 10.\n\n3. The units digit of factorials greater than or equal to 5! cycles every 20, with a pattern of 2, 6. Since 24! is much larger than 5!, its units digit is 6.\n\n4. Now, the next level is 24!^6. To find the units digit of this, I'll look for patterns in the units digit when raising numbers ending with 6.\n\n5. Observing that 6 raised to any power always ends with 6. Therefore, the units digit of 24!^6 is 6.\n\n6. Moving up, the next level is 6^6. Calculating this, 6^6 = 46656, which has a units digit of 6.\n\n7. Finally, the next level is 6^6, which again results in a units digit of 6.\n\n8. Since all levels beyond this also result in a units digit of 6, the overall units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the units digit of \\(4\\$\\), we'll analyze the superfactorial step by step, focusing only on the units digit at each level.\n\n1. **Calculate the first factorial:**\n   \\[\n   4! = 24 \\quad \\text{(Units digit: 4)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the units digit of the next factorial:**\n   - The units digit of \\(24!\\) is 6 because factorials of numbers greater than or equal to 5! end with 6.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Units digit of } 24! = "
