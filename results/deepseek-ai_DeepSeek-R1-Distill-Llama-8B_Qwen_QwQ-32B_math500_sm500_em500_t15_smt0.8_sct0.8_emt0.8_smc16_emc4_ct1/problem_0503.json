Let's break down the information provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that there are a total of 360 students. Out of these, 15 take none of the three subjects: calculus, physics, or chemistry. Therefore, the remaining 345 students are taking at least one of these subjects.\n\nNext, it's given that 180 students take calculus. Since some of these students might also be taking physics or chemistry, I'll need to account for the overlaps later.\n\nThe problem states that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics. Let me define the number of students taking physics as P. This means that the number of students taking chemistry is 2P.\n\nIt's also mentioned that 75 students take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry. Additionally, only 30 students are enrolled in both physics and calculus.\n\nNow, I'll use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of students taking at least one subject. The formula is:\n\nTotal = Calculus + Physics + Chemistry - (students taking both Calculus and Physics) - (students taking both Calculus and Chemistry) - (students taking both Physics and Chemistry) + (students taking all three subjects).\n\nFrom the information, I know that 30 students take both physics and calculus, 75 take both physics and chemistry, 75 take both calculus and chemistry, and P is the number of students taking physics, with 2P taking chemistry.\n\nSince there are no students taking all three subjects, the formula simplifies to:\n\n345 = Calculus + Physics + Chemistry - 30 - 75 - 75.\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n345 = 180 + 3P - 180.\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n345 = 3P.\n\nFinally, solving for P gives:\n\nP = 115.\n\nSo, 115 students take physics.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find the number of students who take physics.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students in the school: 360\n- Students taking none of the subjects (calculus, physics, chemistry): 15\n- Students taking calculus: 180\n- Students taking chemistry: 2 × (students taking physics) = 2P\n-"

So the correct equation is:\n\n\\[\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n345 = 180 + 3P - 180 + 15\n\\]\n\\[\n345 = 3P + 15\n\\]\n\\[\n330 = 3P \\implies P = 110\n\\]\n\nSo the correct number of students taking physics is 110, not 115 as initially miscalculated.\n\nHowever, let me verify this with another approach to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nLet’s denote:\n- \\( P \\) = Number of"
