            "output": "Alright, so I've got this polynomial equation to solve: \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\). The coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) are integers, but they aren't specified here. The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots that this polynomial could have. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember there's something called the Rational Root Theorem, which probably will help here. I think it says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are coprime integers, must satisfy that \\(p\\) divides the constant term and \\(q\\) divides the leading coefficient.\n\nSo in this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. That means for any rational root \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), \\(p\\) has to be a divisor of 1, and \\(q\\) has to be a divisor of 2.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n- \\(p\\) divides 1, so the possible values of \\(p\\) are ±1.\n- \\(q\\) divides 2, so the possible values of \\(q\\) are ±1, ±2.\n\nNow, since \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have to be coprime, I need to consider the possible combinations of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nStarting with \\(p = 1\\):\n- \\(q = 1\\) gives the root \\(1/1 = 1\\).\n- \\(q = -1\\) gives the root \\(1/-1 = -1\\).\n- \\(q = 2\\) gives \\(1/2\\).\n- \\(q = -2\\) gives \\(1/-2 = -1/2\\).\n\nNext, \\(p = -1\\):\n- \\(q = 1\\) gives \\(-1/1 = -1\\).\n- \\(q = -1\\) gives \\(-1/-1 = 1\\).\n- \\(q = 2\\) gives \\(-1/2\\).\n- \\(q = -2\\) gives \\(-1/-2 = 1/2\\).\n\nBut wait, I notice that some of these roots are duplicates. For example, \\(1\\) and \\(-1"

So I should make a list of all unique possibilities.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n- From \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = 1\\): 1\n- From \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = -1\\): -1\n- From \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = 2\\): 1/2\n- From \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = -2\\): -1/2\n- From \\(p = -1\\), \\(q = 1\\): -1 (duplicate)\n- From \\(p = -1\\), \\(q = -1\\): 1 (duplicate)\n- From \\(p = -1\\), \\(q = 2\\): -1/2 (duplicate)\n- From \\(p = -1\\), \\(q = -2\\): 1/2 (duplicate)\n\nSo, after removing duplicates, the unique possible rational roots are: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nWait, is that all? Let me double-check. The constant term is 1, so the divisors \\(p\\) are indeed ±1. The leading coefficient is 2, so \\(q\\) can be ±1 or ±2. And since \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must be coprime, we have to make sure that \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) don't share any common factors other than 1. For example, if \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 2\\), they are coprime because 1 and any number have no common divisors other than 1. Similarly, if \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = -2\\), still coprime. The same goes for \\(p = -1\\). So yes, all these are valid possible rational roots.\n\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are four in number: 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2.\n\nI don't think I'm missing any other possibilities here. Since the constant term is 1, which only has two divisors, ±1, and the leading coefficient is 2, which has four divisors, ±1, ±2, but since we're considering \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) coprime,"

So yeah, that gives the four unique possible rational roots.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial is of the form \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\) with integer coefficients. To find the number of different possible rational roots, we apply the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have \\(p\\) dividing the constant term (1) and \\(q\\) dividing the leading coefficient (2). The divisors of 1 are ±1, and the divisors of 2 are ±1, ±2. Considering all combinations of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) that are coprime, we find the possible rational roots: 1, -1, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). These are the unique possible rational roots.\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{4}\\)"
