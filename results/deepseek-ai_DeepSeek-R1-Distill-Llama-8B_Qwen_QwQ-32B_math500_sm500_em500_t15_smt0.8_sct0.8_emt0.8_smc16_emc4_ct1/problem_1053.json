The coefficients a\u2083, a\u2082, and a\u2081 are integers. Hmm, okay.\n\nI remember something about the Rational Root Theorem from algebra. Let me try to recall how that works. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms as a fraction p/q, must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient. That makes sense because if you plug in a root, the numerator has to cancel out the denominator when you substitute it into the polynomial.\n\nSo, in this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. Let me write that down. The possible values for p, the numerator, are the factors of 1, which would just be \u00b11. For q, the denominator, it's the factors of 2, which are \u00b11 and \u00b12. But since we're talking about possible rational roots, we can ignore the negative factors because q can be positive or negative, but p can also be positive or negative. So actually, we just need to consider all combinations where p is a factor of 1 and q is a factor of 2.\n\nWait, hold on. If p is \u00b11 and q is \u00b11 or \u00b12, then the possible rational roots would be \u00b11/1 and \u00b11/2. So that gives me possible roots of 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2. Are there any more? Let's see, the constant term is 1, so no other factors besides \u00b11. And the leading coefficient is 2, so the denominators can't be anything else except 1 and 2. That seems right.\n\nSo, are these all unique? Let me list them out: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. Yep, that's four different possible rational roots. I don't think there are any duplicates here. Each of these is distinct from the others.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should think about why the Rational Root Theorem applies here. It's because if you plug in a rational number, say p/q, into the polynomial, and if it"

            "output": "'s a root, then substituting x = p/q into the equation would make the equation equal zero. By multiplying through by q\u2074 (since the polynomial is degree 4), you can rearrange terms and see that p must divide the constant term and q must divide the leading coefficient. \n\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are all fractions where the numerator is a factor of 1 (so \u00b11) divided by a factor of 2 (so 1 or 2). So that gives exactly four possibilities: \u00b11 and \u00b11/2. \n\nBut wait, could any of these actually be roots for some integer coefficients? Let's see. Let's take an example. Suppose we have a root of 1. Then plugging in x=1, the equation becomes 2(1)^4 + a\u2083(1)^3 + a\u2082(1)^2 + a\u2081(1) +1 = 0, which simplifies to 2 + a\u2083 + a\u2082 + a\u2081 +1 =0. So that would require a\u2083 + a\u2082 + a\u2081 = -3. Since the coefficients are integers, this is possible. For example, if we set a\u2083 = -1, a\u2082 = -2, a\u2081 = -0, then that would work. \n\nSimilarly, if the root was -1, then plugging in x=-1 gives 2(-1)^4 + a\u2083(-1)^3 + a\u2082(-1)^2 + a\u2081(-1) +1 = 0. Which becomes 2 - a\u2083 + a\u2082 - a\u2081 +1 =0, so that's (2 +1) + (-a\u2083 -a\u2081) + a\u2082 = 3 + (-a\u2083 -a\u2081) + a\u2082 =0. Which can be rearranged to a\u2082 -a\u2083 -a\u2081 = -3. So again, with integers, this is possible.\n\nFor the root 1/2, substituting x=1/2 gives 2*(1/2)^4 + a\u2083*(1/2)^3 + a\u2082*(1/2)^2 + a\u2081*(1/2) +1 =0. Let's compute each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\n\na\u2083*(1/8) = a\u2083/8\n\na\u2082*("

So adding all together: 1/8 + a\u2083/8 + a\u2082/4 + a\u2081/2 +1 =0.\n\nMultiply through by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 +4a\u2081 +8 =0\n\nSimplify: (1+8) + a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 +4a\u2081 =0 => 9 + a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 +4a\u2081 =0 => a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 +4a\u2081 = -9.\n\nSo with integer coefficients, this is achievable. For example, a\u2083= -9, a\u2082=0, a\u2081=0, then -9 +0 +0 = -9. So that works. So 1/2 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, -1/2 as a root: plugging in x=-1/2. Let's see:\n\n2*(-1/2)^4 + a\u2083*(-1/2)^3 + a\u2082*(-1/2)^2 + a\u2081*(-1/2) +1=0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*(1/16)=1/8\n\na\u2083*(-1/8) = -a\u2083/8\n\na\u2082*(1/4) =a\u2082/4\n\na\u2081*(-1/2) = -a\u2081/2\n\nPlus 1.\n\nSo the equation becomes: 1/8 - a\u2083/8 + a\u2082/4 -a\u2081/2 +1=0\n\nMultiply through by 8:\n\n1 -a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 -4a\u2081 +8=0\n\nSimplify: 9 -a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 -4a\u2081=0 => -a\u2083 +2a\u2082 -4a\u2081 = -9 => a\u2083 -2a\u2082 +4a\u2081=9.\n\nSo that means if we set a\u2083=9, a\u2082=0, a\u2081=0, then 9 -0 +0=9, which works. So yes, -1/2 is possible.\n\nSo, all four roots are possible for some set of integer coefficients. Therefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nI don't think I missed any.

Therefore, the possible rational roots are:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{-1}{1}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{-1}{2}\n\\]\n\nThese simplify to \\(1, -1, \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}\\), all of which are unique and distinct. Thus, there are 4 different possible rational roots.\n\n**Answer:** The number of different possible rational roots is \\boxed{4}."
