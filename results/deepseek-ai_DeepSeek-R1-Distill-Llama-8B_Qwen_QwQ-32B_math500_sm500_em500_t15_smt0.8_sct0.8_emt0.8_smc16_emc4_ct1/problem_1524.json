The sum of their cubes: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with sums of powers like this, sometimes there's a relationship that can be exploited. Maybe like using Cauchy-Schwarz or something? Or perhaps considering moments?\n\nWait, let's consider if all the \\( a_i \\) are equal. If that's the case, we can check if that fits the given sums.\n\nIf all \\( a_i = k \\), then:\n\n- Sum: \\( nk = 96 \\) --> \\( k = 96/n \\)\n- Sum of squares: \\( nk^2 = 144 \\)\n- Sum of cubes: \\( nk^3 = 216 \\)\n\nLet me plug in \\( k = 96/n \\) into the sum of squares equation:\n\n\\( n*(96/n)^2 = 144 \\)\nSimplify:\n\n\\( n*(9216/n^2) = 144 \\)\nWhich is:\n\n\\( 9216/n = 144 \\)\nTherefore, \\( n = 9216 / 144 \\)\n\nCalculate that: 144 * 64 = 9216, right? 144 * 60 = 8640, 144*4=576, so 8640+576=9216. So, 64.\n\nWait, so \\( n = 64 \\). Let me check if this also satisfies the sum of cubes.\n\nSum of cubes: \\( n*(96/n)^3 = 216 \\)\nPlug in n=64:\n\n\\( 64*(96/64)^3 = 64*(4/64)^3 = 64*(1/4096) \\) Wait, that can't be right because 96/64 is 1.5, not 4.\n\nWait"

            "output": ", no, 96 divided by 64 is 1.5, right? So \\( (1.5)^3 = 3.375 \\).\n\nSo sum of cubes: \\( 64 * 3.375 = 64 * (27/8) = 8 * 27 = 216 \\). Oh, that works! So when all \\( a_i \\) are equal, n=64 satisfies all three equations. So 64 is a possible value for n.\n\nBut the question is asking for the sum of all possible values of n. So maybe there are other possible n's where the \\( a_i \\)'s aren't all equal. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe n=64 is the only possible value. Let me think.\n\nI recall that for a set of numbers, if we know their sums, sum of squares, etc., we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities to find constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the power mean inequality. Let me check.\n\nThe Power Mean Inequality states that for positive real numbers, the mean of the k-th powers is greater than or equal to the mean of the (k-1)-th powers, with equality when all the numbers are equal.\n\nIn this case, let's compute the first power mean (which is the mean) and the second power mean.\n\nMean (k=1): \\( 96/n \\)\nMean of squares (k=2): \\( 144/n \\)\n\nAccording to Power Mean, \\( (144/n) \\geq (96/n) \\), which simplifies to \\( 144 \\geq 96 \\), which is always true, so nothing new there.\n\nSimilarly, the mean of cubes: \\( 216/n \\). The Power Mean tells us that the mean of cubes should be greater than or equal to the mean of squares. So:\n\n\\( 216/n \\geq 144/n \\)\nWhich simplifies to 216 >= 144, which is true. So that's consistent, but again, not giving us new info.\n\nBut in the equal case, all the means are equal because all the a_i are equal, so the inequalities become equalities, which is only possible when all a_i are equal.\n\nWait, but is this the only case? Because Power Mean gives us that when the numbers are equal, all the power means are equal. If the numbers aren't all equal, then the power means would be"

So, if the numbers are not all equal, then the mean of cubes would be greater than the mean of squares, which is greater than the mean of the first power.\n\nBut in our case, the mean of cubes is 216/n, the mean of squares is 144/n, and the mean is 96/n. So, if the numbers are not all equal, then 216/n > 144/n > 96/n. But in our case, the given values are exactly such that 216/n = (96/n)^3 / (144/n)^2 * something? Wait, maybe there's a relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variance. Let me compute the variance of the sequence.\n\nThe variance is given by:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i^2 - \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i \\right)^2 \\)\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\( \\frac{144}{n} - \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 \\)\n\nBut variance must be non-negative, so:\n\n\\( \\frac{144}{n} - \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 \\geq 0 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n^2 \\):\n\n\\( 144n - 96^2 \\geq 0 \\)\n\n\\( 144n \\geq 9216 \\)\n\n\\( n \\geq 9216 / 144 = 64 \\)\n\nSo the variance is non-negative only if \\( n \\geq 64 \\). Wait, so that tells us that n must be at least 64. But in the case where all a_i are equal, the variance is zero, so n=64 is possible. So if n is greater than 64, then the variance would be positive, meaning the numbers are not all equal. But can n be greater than 64?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n\". So maybe n can be 64 and some other numbers?\n\nWait, but let's see. Let me think of"

Because the sum would be 96, so each a_i would be 96/65 ≈1.4769.\n\nBut then, the sum of squares would be higher than when they are equal? Wait, because if the numbers are more spread out, the sum of squares would increase. Wait, but in our problem, the sum of squares is 144, and when all a_i are 96/64=1.5, sum of squares is 144, which is equal to the given value.\n\nWait, no: if n=64, the sum of squares is 144, but when n is greater, each a_i is smaller, so their squares would be smaller, making the sum of squares less than 144? But our given sum of squares is exactly 144. So if n > 64, each a_i is less than 1.5, so each a_i^2 is less than 2.25, so sum of squares would be less than 1.5n. But when n=64, 1.5n = 96, and sum of squares is 144, which is 1.5 squared times 64. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf I have more variables, i.e., n > 64, each a_i is 96/n, so each a_i is less than 1.5. So the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)^2 = 96^2 / n.\n\nGiven that sum of squares is 144, so 96^2 / n = 144.\n\nWait, but when n=64, as before, 96^2=9216, divided by "

If they are not all equal, then the sum of squares can be different?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the sum of squares is exactly 144. So if the variables are not all equal, then the sum of squares would have to still be 144. Hmm, so maybe there are other configurations where the variables are not all equal but still give the same sum, sum of squares, and sum of cubes?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way to have the sum of squares be exactly 144 when the sum is 96 is when all variables are equal, so n must be 64. But then why does the problem ask for the sum of all possible values of n?\n\nHmm, maybe there's another case where some of the variables are different but still satisfy the equations.
