The problem gives me three sums: the sum of the numbers, the sum of their squares, and the sum of their cubes. And I need to find the sum of all possible values of n. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down what we know. The sequence is (a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ), and all the aᵢ are positive real numbers. We have:\n\n- Sum of aᵢ: ∑aᵢ = 96\n- Sum of aᵢ²: ∑aᵢ² = 144\n- Sum of aᵢ³: ∑aᵢ³ = 216\n\nWe are to find all possible values of n and then sum them up. So, the problem is about finding n such that these equations hold for some positive real numbers a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ.\n\nI remember that when dealing with sums of powers, sometimes it's useful to think in terms of moments or using inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder's inequality. But I'm not sure yet. Maybe I can think about using these inequalities to find constraints on n.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the case where all the aᵢ are equal. If they are equal, then each aᵢ would be the same, say a. Then, we can solve for a and check if it's a possible solution.\n\nSo, let's suppose all aᵢ = a. Then, the sum would be n*a = 96, so a = 96/n. Then, the sum of squares would be n*a² = 144. Substituting a = 96/n, we get:\n\nn*(96/n)² = 144 ⇒ n*(9216/n²) = 144 ⇒ 9216/n = 144 ⇒ n = 9216/144.\n\nLet me compute that: 9216 divided by 144. 144 times 64 is 9216, right? Because 144*60=8640, 144*4=576, 8640+576=9216. So, n = 64.\n\nThen, let's check the sum of cubes. If each aᵢ = a = 96/64 = "

Hey, that matches the given sum of cubes!\n\nSo, when all aᵢ are equal, we get n=64, and all the sums match. So, n=64 is definitely a possible value. But the question says \"the sum of all possible values of n,\" so maybe there are other values of n where the sums could hold?\n\nWait, but are there other sequences where the aᵢ aren't all equal, but still satisfy the given sums? If yes, those n's would also be possible.\n\nBut I need to check whether, for n ≠64, the given sums can hold. Maybe I can use some inequality to find possible n's.\n\nLet me think: I know that for positive real numbers, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:\n\n(∑aᵢ²)(∑1²) ≥ (∑aᵢ)².\n\nIn other words, (144)(n) ≥ (96)².\n\nSo, 144n ≥ 9216 ⇒ n ≥ 9216/144 ⇒ n ≥ 64. So, n must be at least 64.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because when I assumed all aᵢ are equal, I got n=64. So, if n must be ≥64, and n can be 64, 65, etc. But wait, is 64 the minimal n? Or can n be higher?\n\nWait, but I need to also consider another inequality. What about the sum of cubes? Maybe using Hölder's inequality or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the Power Mean inequality.\n\nPower Mean inequality states that for positive real numbers, the mean of the k-th powers is at least the (k/m)-th power of the mean of the m-th powers, where m > k.\n\nIn our case, we have three means: the first moment (sum of aᵢ), the second (sum of aᵢ²), and the third (sum of aᵢ³). So, the power mean with exponents 1, 2, 3 would be:\n\n("

Is it possible to have 65 positive real numbers where sum a_i=96, sum a_i²=144, and sum a_i³=216.\n\nHmm, but let me think: if I have n=65, then the average of a_i is 96/65 ≈1.4769. The average of a_i² is 144/65 ≈2.2154, which is much higher than the average of a_i. Similarly, average of a_i³ is 216/65≈3.3208.\n\nWait, but let's check if it's possible. Let me think, perhaps if I have most of the a_i's as small as possible, and a few very large ones, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but wait, if a_i's are positive, then their squares are at least as large as themselves. So, sum a_i² ≥ sum a_i². Well, that's just an equality.

But x has to be positive, which is not allowed. Hmm, so that approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe instead, I can adjust more than one term.
