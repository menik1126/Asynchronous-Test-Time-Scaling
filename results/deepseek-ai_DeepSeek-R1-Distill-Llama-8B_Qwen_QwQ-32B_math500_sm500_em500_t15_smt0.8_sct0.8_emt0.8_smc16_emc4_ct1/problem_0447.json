Here, a_1 is 1 and d is 2.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the sum of the arithmetic series using the formula S = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n), then find the remainder when this sum is divided by 7.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), follow these steps:\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Sequence**\nThe given series is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by \\(2\\):\n\\[\n\\text{First term} = 1,\\quad \\text{Common difference} = 2,\\quad \\text{Last term} = 199\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Number of Terms**\nThe number of terms \\(n\\) in the sequence can be found using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nPlugging in the known values:\n\\[\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\n198 = (n - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\nn - 1 = 99 \\Rightarrow n = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are **100 terms** in the sequence.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Series**\nThe sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n)\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{100}{2} \\times (1 + 199) = 50 \\times 200 = 10,\\!000\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Find the Modulo \\(7\\) Remainder**\nTo find \\(10,\\!000 \\mod 7\\), divide \\(10,\\!000"
