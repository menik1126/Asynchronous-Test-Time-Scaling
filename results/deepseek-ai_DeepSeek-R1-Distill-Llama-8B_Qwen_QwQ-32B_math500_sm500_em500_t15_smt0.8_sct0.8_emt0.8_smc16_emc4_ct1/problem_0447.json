The nth odd number can be expressed as \\(2n - 1\\). Setting \\(2n - 1 = 199\\) gives \\(n = 100\\), meaning there are 100 terms in total.\n\nNext, I calculate the sum of the first 100 odd numbers. The sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is given by the formula \\(n^2\\). Therefore, the sum is \\(100^2 = 10,000\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7. Performing the division, 7 goes into 10,000 a total of 1,428 times with a remainder. Calculating \\(10,000 \\mod 7\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n10,000 \\div 7 = 1,428 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Number of Terms\n\nThe given series is a sequence of consecutive odd numbers. The nth odd number can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = 2n - 1\n\\]\nSet \\(a_n = 199\\):\n\\[\n2n - 1 = 199 \\implies 2n = 200 \\implies n = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are **100 terms** in the series.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of the Series\n\nThe sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is given by the formula:\n\\[\nS = n^2\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(n = 100\\):\n\\[\nS = 100^2 = 10,000\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Modulo \\(7\\) Remainder\n\nNow, compute \\(10,000 \\mod 7\\):\n"
