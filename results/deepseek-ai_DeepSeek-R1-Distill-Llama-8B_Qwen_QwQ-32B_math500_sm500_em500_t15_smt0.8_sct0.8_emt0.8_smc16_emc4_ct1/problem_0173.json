Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the cube root of something equals 16. So if I cube both sides of the equation, I can get rid of the cube root. That should simplify things. So, if I do that, I'll have:\n\n\\( (\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3 \\)\n\nSimplifying both sides, that becomes:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \\)\n\nWait, because \\( 16^3 \\) is \\( 16 \\times 16 \\times 16 \\). Let me calculate that to make sure. \\( 16 \\times 16 = 256 \\), and then \\( 256 \\times 16 \\). Hmm, \\( 256 \\times 10 = 2560 \\) and \\( 256 \\times 6 = 1536 \\), so adding those together gives \\( 2560 + 1536 = 4096 \\). Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo now the equation is \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \\). I think I should move everything to one side to form a quadratic equation. So, subtract 4096 from both sides:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0 \\)\n\nSimplifying that, the constants 4 and -4096 combine: \\( 4 - 4096 = -4092 \\). So the equation becomes:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Since it's quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -4092 \\).\n\nLet me plug in those values:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-4092)}}{2 \\times"

Let me think. I know that 128 squared is 16384 because 128 * 128 is 16384. Let me verify:\n\n\\( 100^2 = 10,000 \\)\n\n\\( 120^2 = 14,400 \\)\n\n\\( 128^2 = (130 - 2)^2 = 130^2 - 2 \\times 130 \\times 2 + 2^2 = 16,900 - 520 + 4 = 16,900 - 520 is 16,380, plus 4 is 16,384. Yes, that's correct. So sqrt(16384) is 128.\n\nSo substituting back into the equation:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2} \\)\n\nSo that gives two solutions:\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66 \\)\n2. \\( x = \\frac{4 - 128}{2} = \\frac{-124}{2} = -62 \\)\n\nBut the question asks for the positive value, so \\( x = 66 \\).\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier. Let me verify by plugging \\( x = 66 \\) back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\)\n\nCompute \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 \\):\n\n\\( 66^2 = 4356 \\)\n\n\\( 4x = 4 * 66 = 264 \\)\n\nSo \\( 4356 - 264 + 4"

So yes, it checks out.\n\nJust to double-check the quadratic equation steps:\n\nStarting with \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \\)\n\nSubtract 4096 to get \\( x^2 -4x -4092 = 0 \\), which seems correct.\n\nQuadratic formula applied with a=1, b=-4, c=-4092: yes.\n\nDiscriminant: \\( b^2 - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384 \\). That's correct.\n\nSquare root of discriminant: 128. Then, \\( x = (4 \u00b1 128)/2 \\). That's right.\n\nSo positive solution is 66.
