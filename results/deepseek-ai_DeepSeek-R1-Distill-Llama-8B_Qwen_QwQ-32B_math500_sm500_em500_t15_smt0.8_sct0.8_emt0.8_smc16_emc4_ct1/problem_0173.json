            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better. It's \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\\). Okay, cool. My goal is to find the positive value of x that satisfies this equation.\n\nFirst off, cube roots can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that to get rid of a cube root, you can cube both sides of the equation. That should simplify things a bit. So, let me try that. If I cube both sides, the left side becomes \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\), and the right side becomes \\(16^3\\). I should calculate what \\(16^3\\) is. Let me do that step by step.\n\n16 times 16 is 256, right? Then, 256 times 16... Hmm, 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 is 4096. So, \\(16^3 = 4096\\). Got that down. That means my equation now simplifies to \\(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\\).\n\nNext, I need to solve this quadratic equation for x. To do that, I should bring all terms to one side so that the equation equals zero. Subtracting 4096 from both sides, I get \\(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\\). Simplifying that, \\(4 - 4096\\) is \\(-4092\\). So now, the equation is \\(x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\\).\n\nHmm, solving a quadratic equation. I either need to factor it, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Looking at the numbers here, 4092 is a pretty large number, and I don't recognize any obvious factors around it. So, factoring might not be the best route. Completing the square could be an option, but I need to see if it's manageable. Alternatively, the quadratic formula is a reliable method and might be quicker here.\n\nLet me recall the quadratic formula: for an equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\"

            "output": "), the solutions are \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). In this case, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Plugging those into the formula, we get:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092)}}{2(1)}\\)\n\nSimplifying the numerator first: the first term becomes +4. Then inside the square root, let's compute each part:\n\n\\((-4)^2 = 16\\), and then the next part is -4 times 1 times -4092. Wait, actually, the discriminant is \\(b^2 - 4ac\\). Since c is negative, the term becomes -4 * 1 * (-4092) which is positive. Let me compute that:\n\n\\(16 - 4*1*(-4092) = 16 + 4*4092\\). Let me calculate 4 times 4092. 4 times 4000 is 16,000, and 4 times 92 is 368, so total is 16,000 + 368 = 16,368. Then adding the 16 gives 16,384. So the discriminant is 16,384.\n\nTherefore, the square root of 16,384. Hmm, let me see. What is the square root of 16,384? Let me think. 128 squared is 16,384 because 100 squared is 10,000, 120 squared is 14,400, 128 squared is (130 - 2)^2 = 130\u00b2 - 4*130 +4 = 16,900 - 520 +4 = 16,900 - 520 is 16,380, plus 4 is 16,384. Yes! So sqrt(16,384) is 128."

            "output": " That's a perfect square, which is convenient.\n\nSo now, going back to the quadratic formula:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2}\\)\n\nThat gives two possible solutions:\n\nFirst solution: \\(\\frac{4 + 128}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\\)\n\nSecond solution: \\(\\frac{4 - 128}{2} = \\frac{-124}{2} = -62\\)\n\nOkay, so the solutions are x = 66 and x = -62. But the question specifically asks for the positive value of x. So the answer is 66.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me verify the steps again. Starting from the original equation, cube both sides: correct. 16 cubed is 4096: correct. Then moving 4096 to the left side: subtract 4096, giving x\u00b2 -4x -4092=0: correct. Using the quadratic formula, a=1, b=-4, c=-4092: correct. Plugging into the formula: (4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 16368))/2: that's sqrt(16,384)=128: correct. So x = (4 \u00b1128)/2: 4+128=132, 132/2=66; 4-128=-124, -124/2=-62. So, positive x=66.\n\nJust to double-check, let me plug x=66 back into the original equation to make sure.\n\nCompute x\u00b2 -4x +4: 66 squared is 4356. Then -4x is -264. So 4356 -264 +4.\n\n4356 -264 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096. Then the cube root of 4096 is 16, which matches the right side. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, plugging in x=-62: (-62)^2 is 3844, -4*(-62) is +248, +4. So 3844 +248 +4. 3844 +248 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096. So cube root of 4096 is 16, which also works. But since the question asks for the positive value, 66 is the answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the"
