We have three equations:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nAnd we need to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\).\n\nHmm, so I remember that when dealing with symmetric equations like these, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric sums or Vieta's formulas. Let me recall what those are.\n\nThe elementary symmetric sums for three variables \\( x, y, z \\) are:\n\n- \\( s_1 = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( s_2 = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( s_3 = xyz \\)\n\nWe already know that \\( s_3 = xyz = 4 \\).\n\nThe second equation is \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). I think there's a formula for the sum of cubes in terms of \\( s_1, s_2, s_3 \\). Let me try to remember that formula.\n\nYes, I think it's \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\). So in terms of \\( s_1, s_2, s_3 \\), that's:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3s_3 \\)\n\nWe have \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\) and \\( s_3 = 4 \\). Plugging in, we get:\n\n\\( 4 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3*4 \\)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( 4 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 12 \\)\n\nWait, that brings:\n\n\\( s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 12 = 4 \\)\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\n\\( s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_"

I'll keep that aside for now.\n\nNow, let's look at the third equation: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\). Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of the symmetric sums.\n\nLet me see if I can factor this expression. Let's write it as:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z \\)\n\nI notice that each term has two variables multiplied, with one squared. Maybe I can factor it by grouping terms.\n\nLet me try grouping terms:\n\nGroup xy^2 and x^2 y: That gives xy(y + x).\n\nSimilarly, group xz^2 and x^2 z: That gives xz(z + x).\n\nSimilarly, group yz^2 and y^2 z: That gives yz(z + y).\n\nSo the whole expression becomes:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, that's better. So now we have:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nI can write this as:\n\n\\( xy(x + y + z - z) + xz(x + z + z - z) + yz(y + z + z - z) \\)\n\nWait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, notice that \\( x + y + z = s_1 \\), so each term is \\( xy(s_1 - z) + xz(s_1 - y) + yz(s_1 - x) \\)\n\nWait, let me try that:\n\nExpress \\( x + y = s_1 - z \\), similarly for others.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\( xy(s_1 - z) + xz(s_1 - y) + yz(s_1 - x) \\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\n= \\( xy s_1 - xy z + xz s_1 - xz y + yz s_1"

Wait, no, wait, let me recheck that.\n\nOriginal equation: \\( s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 12 = 4 \\), so subtracting 4 gives \\( s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 8 = 0 \\). That's correct.\n\nThen, for the third equation, after substitution, I got \\( s_1 s_2 = 24 \\). So substituting into equation (1), we get \\( s_1^3 - 3*24 + 8 = 0 \\) which is \\( s_1^3 -72 +8 = s_1^3 -64=0 \\), so \\( s_1^3=64 \\) so \\( s_1=4 \\). Correct.\n\nThen \\( s_2=24/4=6 \\). So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider if there are multiple real solutions, but since all equations are symmetric, I think it's safe to take positive real numbers here.
