The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is given by the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So, for 1 - i, that would be sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2).\n\nNext, since I'm raising (1 - i) to the 8th power, I'll use the property of absolute values that states |(a)^n| = |a|^n. Applying this, I have |(1 - i)^8| = (sqrt(2))^8.\n\nFinally, I'll compute (sqrt(2))^8. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), raising it to the 8th power gives 2^( (1/2) * 8 ) = 2^4 = 16.\n</think>\n\nRingo needs to calculate \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\). Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Absolute Value of a Complex Number**:\n   \n   For a complex number \\(a + bi\\), the absolute value (or magnitude) is given by:\n   \\[\n   |a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the Absolute Value of \\(1 - i\\)**:\n   \n   Here, \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = -1\\). Plugging these into the formula:\n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Raise the Absolute Value to the 8th Power**:\n   \n   Since \\(|(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8\\):\n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Simplify the Expression**:\n   \n   Note that \\(\\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\\). Raising this to the 8th power:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{"
