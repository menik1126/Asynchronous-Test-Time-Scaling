He walked \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south twice, so that's \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\) mile south.\n\nNext, I'll determine the east-west displacement. Bill walked \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east, which means his position relative to his starting point is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east.\n\nNow, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point. The south displacement is 1 mile, and the east displacement is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile. \n\nSo, the distance \\(d\\) can be calculated as:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n</think>\n\nLet's determine how far Bill is from his starting point step by step.\n\n1. **South Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south.\n   - Then he walks another \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south.\n   - **Total South Displacement:** \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\) mile.\n\n2. **East Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east.\n   - **Total East Displacement:** \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile.\n\n3. **Straight-Line Distance (Using Pythagorean Theorem):**\n   - The straight-line distance \\(d\\) from the starting point is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 1 mile (south) and \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile (east).\n   - \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{(\\text{South Distance})^2 + (\\text{East Distance})^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2}\n     \\]\n   - \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9}{16}} = \\sqrt"
