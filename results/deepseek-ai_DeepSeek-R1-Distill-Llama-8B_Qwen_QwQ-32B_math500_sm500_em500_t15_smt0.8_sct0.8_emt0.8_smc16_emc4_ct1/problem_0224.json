            "output": "To determine how far Bill is from his starting point, I'll start by breaking down his movements.\n\nFirst, Bill walks half a mile south. This means his current position is 0.5 miles south of the starting point.\n\nNext, he walks three-fourths of a mile east. This eastward movement adds to his southern displacement, so his new position is 0.5 miles south and 0.75 miles east.\n\nThen, Bill walks another half a mile south. Adding this to his existing southern displacement, his total southern displacement becomes 1 mile.\n\nNow, to find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. The horizontal displacement is 0.75 miles, and the vertical displacement is 1 mile.\n\nApplying the formula, the straight-line distance is the square root of (0.75 squared plus 1 squared), which equals the square root of 1.5625.\n\nFinally, rounding this to the nearest hundredth, the distance is 1.25 miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down Bill's movements and calculate his displacement step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Bill starts at \\((0, 0)\\).\n\n2. **First Movement**: Bill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south.\n   - **New Position**: \\((0, -\\frac{1}{2})\\).\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Bill walks \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east.\n   - **New Position**: \\((\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{1}{2})\\).\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Bill walks another \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south.\n   - **New Position**: \\((\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{3}{2})\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Straight-Line Distance**:\n   - Bill's final position is \\((\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{3}{2})\\).\n   - **Horizontal Displacement (East-West)**: \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) miles.\n   - **Vertical Displacement (South-North)**: \\(|\\,-\\frac{3}{2}\\,| = \\frac{3}{2}\\) miles.\n   \n   Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{3"
