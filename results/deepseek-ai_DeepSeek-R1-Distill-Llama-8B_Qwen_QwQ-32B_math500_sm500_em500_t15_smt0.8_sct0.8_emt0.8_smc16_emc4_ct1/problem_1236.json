            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. Let me write it down first to make sure I have it clear.\n\nSo, the equation is:\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, my goal is to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. Since there's a square root involved, I remember that usually, the first step is to isolate the square root term and then square both sides to eliminate it. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll subtract 4 from both sides to get the square root by itself. That gives me:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nNow, to get rid of the square root, I'll square both sides of the equation. But before I do that, I should remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll have to check my answers at the end.\n\nSo, squaring both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nOkay, that simplifies the equation a bit. Now, I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side so I can set it equal to zero and solve for x.\n\nSo, subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nHmm, okay, now I have a quadratic equation: x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. I can solve this by factoring, I think. Let me try to factor it.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. Let's see: 1 and 5 add up to 6. Since the middle term is -6x, I think they both need to be negative. So,\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nLet me check that:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = x^2 - x - 5x + 5 = x"

            "output": "^2 -6x +5. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 5 and x = 1. But wait, I should check these solutions in the original equation because sometimes squaring both sides can create solutions that don't actually work.\n\nLet me check x = 5 first:\n\nLeft side: x = 5\n\nRight side: √(11 - 2*5) + 4 = √(11 - 10) + 4 = √1 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOkay, so 5 works.\n\nNow, let's check x = 1:\n\nLeft side: x = 1\n\nRight side: √(11 - 2*1) + 4 = √(11 - 2) + 4 = √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nHmm, 7 is not equal to 1. So, x = 1 is an extraneous solution. That means the only valid solution is x = 5.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. Did I do everything correctly? Let me recap.\n\nOriginal equation:\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtract 4: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nSquare both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nExpand left side: x^2 -8x +16 = 11 -2x\n\nBring all terms to left: x^2 -6x +5 = 0\n\nFactor: (x -5)(x -1) =0 → x=5, x=1\n\nCheck x=5: 5 = √(11 -10) +4 = √1 +4 =1+4=5 → correct.\n\nCheck x=1: 1 vs √(11-2) +4=√9 +4=3+4=7 → 1≠7 → invalid.\n\nSo, only x=5 is a valid solution.\n\nWait a second, but let me also think about the domain of the original equation. Since we have a square root, √(11 -2x), the expression inside must be non-negative.\n\nSo, 11 - 2x ≥ 0 → 2x ≤11 → x ≤11/2 → x ≤5.5\n\nSo,"
