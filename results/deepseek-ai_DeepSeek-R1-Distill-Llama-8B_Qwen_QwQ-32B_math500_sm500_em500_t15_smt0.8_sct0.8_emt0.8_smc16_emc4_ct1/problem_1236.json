I can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides, which gives \\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\).\n\nNext, I'll square both sides of the equation to remove the square root. This results in \\( (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x \\).\n\nExpanding the left side, I get \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\).\n\nNow, I'll move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\).\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation, I'll factor it into \\( (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0 \\).\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the potential solutions \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nHowever, since the original equation involves a square root, I need to check which of these solutions are valid by substituting them back into the original equation.\n\nWhen \\( x = 5 \\) is substituted, \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2(5)} = \\sqrt{11 - 10} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\), and the equation becomes \\( 5 = 1 + 4 \\), which is true.\n\nWhen \\( x = 1 \\) is substituted, \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2(1)} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\), and the equation becomes \\( 1 = 3 + 4 \\), which is false.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\( x = 5 \\).\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given the equation:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\]\n\n**Step 1: Isolate the square root term.**\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides to isolate the square root:\n\\[ x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Square both sides to eliminate the square root.**\n\n\\[ (x - 4)^2 = (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 \\]\n\\[ x^2 - 8x + "
