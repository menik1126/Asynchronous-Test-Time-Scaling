Since there are no other prime factors, the decimal representation will terminate.\n\nNext, I will convert the fraction into its decimal form by performing the division of 57 by 160. This involves dividing 57 by 160 and considering the decimal places as necessary.\n\nAfter obtaining the decimal, I will express the result with the appropriate number of decimal places to provide a clear and precise answer.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conditions for a Terminating Decimal:**\n   \n   A fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will have a terminating decimal if and only if the denominator \\(b\\) (after simplifying the fraction) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. \n\n2. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   \n   \\[\n   160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the denominator only consists of the primes 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n\n3. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   \n   Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n   \\]\n   \n   Here's the breakdown of the division:\n   \n   \\[\n   57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.35625}\n   \\]"
