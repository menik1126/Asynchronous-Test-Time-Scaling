            "output": "I need to convert the fraction 57/160 to a terminating decimal. To do this, I'll first determine the prime factors of both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nStarting with 57, I notice that it's divisible by 3. Dividing 57 by 3 gives me 19, which is a prime number. So, the prime factors of 57 are 3 and 19.\n\nNext, I'll factorize 160. I know that 160 is divisible by 2. Dividing 160 by 2 repeatedly gives me 80, then 40, then 20, and finally 10. Continuing with 2, dividing 10 by 2 gives me 5. So, the prime factors of 160 are 2^5 and 5.\n\nNow, I'll identify the common factors between the numerator and the denominator. I notice that both 57 and 160 have a common factor of 1, so no simplification is needed.\n\nSince the denominator 160 has prime factors of 2 and 5, and the numerator has prime factors of 3 and 19, there are no common factors other than 1. This means the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTo convert the fraction to a terminating decimal, I'll set up a division of the numerator by the denominator. Dividing 57 by 160 should give me a decimal that terminates because the denominator has only 2s and 5s as prime factors.\n\nPerforming the division, 57 divided by 160 equals 0.355. This decimal has three decimal places, and since the denominator is 160 (which is 2^5 * 5), the decimal terminates after three places.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize the Denominator and Numerator:**\n   - **Numerator (57):** \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\)\n   - **Denominator (160):** \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5\\)\n\n2. **Check for Common Factors:**\n   - The numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = 0.355\n"
