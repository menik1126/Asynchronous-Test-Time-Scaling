Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\nThe prime numbers less than 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll list all the odd numbers greater than zero. These are numbers that are not divisible by 2 and start from 1: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29.\n\nNow, I'll find the intersection of the two sets. This means identifying the numbers that are common to both lists.\n\nComparing both lists, the common prime numbers that are also odd and greater than zero are: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nFinally, I'll count these common numbers to determine the total number of elements in the intersection.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the set of all prime numbers less than 30:**\n   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n   - The prime numbers less than 30 are:  \n     \\(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\)\n\n2. **Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than zero:**\n   - Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2 and start from 1.\n   - The odd numbers greater than zero are:  \n     \\(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29\\)\n\n3. **Find the intersection of the two sets:**\n   - The intersection consists of numbers that are present in both sets.\n   - Comparing the two lists:\n     - **Common numbers:** \\(3, "
