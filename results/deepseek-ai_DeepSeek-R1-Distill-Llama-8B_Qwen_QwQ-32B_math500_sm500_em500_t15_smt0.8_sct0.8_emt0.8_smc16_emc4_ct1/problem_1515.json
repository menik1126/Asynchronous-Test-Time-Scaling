            "output": "To determine the number of possible license plates, I'll start by calculating the number of combinations for the letters and then for the numbers.\n\nFirst, for the letters part, there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and since each letter must be different, the number of ways to choose the first letter is 26. For the second letter, there are now 25 remaining letters to choose from. Therefore, the total number of possible letter combinations is 26 multiplied by 25, which equals 650.\n\nNext, for the numbers part, there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9). Each digit must also be different, so the first digit can be any of the 10 digits. The second digit then has 9 remaining choices. Thus, the total number of possible number combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of possible license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations. That is, 650 multiplied by 90, which equals 58,500.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many unique license plates can be formed under the given conditions.\n\n### **Problem Statement:**\n*Each license plate consists of:*\n- **2 different letters (A through Z)** followed by\n- **2 different one-digit numbers (0-9)**.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Number of Possible Letter Combinations**\n\n1. **First Letter:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.\n   - Since the license plate must have **2 different letters**, the first letter can be any of the 26 letters.\n   - **Number of choices for the first letter:** \\(26\\)\n\n2. **Second Letter:**\n   - After choosing the first letter, there are now \\(26 - 1 = 25\\) remaining letters to choose from.\n   - **Number of choices for the second letter:** \\(25\\)\n\n3. **Total Letter Combinations:**\n   - Multiply the number of choices for each letter.\n   - \\(26 \\times 25 = 650\\)\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Number of Possible Number Combinations**\n\n1. **First Digit:**\n   - There are 10 possible digits (0-9).\n   - Since the license plate must have **2 different digits**, the first digit can be any of the 10 digits"
