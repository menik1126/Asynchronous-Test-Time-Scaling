This gives 26 multiplied by 25 possible combinations for the letters.\n\nFor the numbers, there are 10 options for the first digit and 9 remaining options for the second digit, resulting in 10 multiplied by 9 possible combinations for the numbers.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll analyze each part of the license plate structure:\n\n1. **Letters**: \n   - **First Letter**: 26 possible choices (A-Z).\n   - **Second Letter**: 25 possible choices (since it must be different from the first letter).\n   \n   **Total Letter Combinations**: \\( 26 \\times 25 = 650 \\)\n\n2. **Numbers**:\n   - **First Digit**: 10 possible choices (0-9).\n   - **Second Digit**: 9 possible choices (since it must be different from the first digit).\n   \n   **Total Number Combinations**: \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\)\n\n3. **Total License Plate Combinations**:\n   - Since the letters and numbers are independent of each other, we multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total} = \\text{Total Letter Combinations} \\times \\text{Total Number Combinations} = 650 \\times 90 = 58,500\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
