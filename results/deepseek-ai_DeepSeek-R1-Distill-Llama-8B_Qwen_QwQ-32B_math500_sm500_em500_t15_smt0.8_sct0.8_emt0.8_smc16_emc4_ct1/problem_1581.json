Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at each part of the expression separately. Let's start from the numerator inside the square root. The numerator has three terms: 5 over the square root of 80, the square root of 845 divided by 9, and the square root of 45. That seems a bit messy, but maybe I can simplify each term before adding them together.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 divided by the square root of 80. I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually simplified, so maybe I can rationalize the denominator here. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the square root of 80. That would give me (5 * sqrt(80)) / (sqrt(80) * sqrt(80)). The denominator simplifies to 80 because sqrt(80) squared is 80. So, that term becomes (5 * sqrt(80)) / 80.\n\nWait, but maybe I can simplify sqrt(80) further. Let me think, 80 can be broken down into prime factors: 16 * 5. Since 16 is a perfect square, sqrt(16*5) is sqrt(16) * sqrt(5), which is 4*sqrt(5). So, sqrt(80) is 4*sqrt(5). Plugging that back into the first term, I get (5 * 4 * sqrt(5)) / 80. Multiplying 5 and 4 gives 20, so it's (20 * sqrt(5)) / 80. That simplifies to (20/80) * sqrt(5), which is (1/4) * sqrt(5). So, the first term simplifies to sqrt(5)/4.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second term: sqrt(845) divided by 9. Let's see if I can simplify sqrt(845). Breaking down 845, I know that 845 divided by 5 is 169, because 5*169 is 845. And 169 is 13"

            "output": " squared, so sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*13^2). That can be written as sqrt(5) * sqrt(13^2), which is 13*sqrt(5). So, sqrt(845) is 13*sqrt(5). Plugging that back into the second term, we have (13*sqrt(5))/9.\n\nOkay, now the third term: sqrt(45). Let me simplify that. 45 is 9*5, and 9 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5), which is 3*sqrt(5). So that term is just 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo, now I can rewrite the entire numerator inside the square root with the simplified terms:\n\nNumerator = (sqrt(5)/4) + (13*sqrt(5)/9) + 3*sqrt(5)\n\nHmm, now I need to add these three terms together. Since they all have a sqrt(5) in them, I can factor that out and just add the coefficients.\n\nLet me write them together:\n\nsqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3)\n\nWait, let me compute the coefficients:\n\nFirst term: 1/4\n\nSecond term: 13/9\n\nThird term: 3, which is equal to 3/1. Hmm, maybe I should get common denominators to add them. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator for 4 and 9 is 36, I think. So, 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, and 3 is 108/36. Let me check that: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169. Wait, that can't be right, because 1/4 is 9/36? Wait, 1 divided by 4 is 0.25, and 9/36 is 0.25. Yes, that's correct. 13/9 is approximately 1.444, which is 52/36. And 3 is 3/1, which is 108/36 when converted. So adding them all together: 9 + 52 + 108 is 169. So, 169/36.\n\nSo, the numerator becomes sqrt(5) * (169/36"

            "output": ").\n\nSo, now the expression inside the square root is sqrt(5) * (169/36). Then, the entire expression is the square root of that, divided by sqrt(5).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe overall expression is sqrt(Numerator / sqrt(5)).\n\nWait, no, actually, the original expression is sqrt( (Numerator) / (sqrt5) ). So, the numerator inside the square root is the sum, which is sqrt5*(169/36), and the denominator is sqrt5. So, it's sqrt( [sqrt5*(169/36)] / sqrt5 ).\n\nHmm, when I divide sqrt5 by sqrt5, they cancel out. So, inside the square root, we have (169/36). Thus, the expression simplifies to sqrt(169/36).\n\nWait, sqrt(169/36) is equal to sqrt(169)/sqrt(36) which is 13/6. So, the entire expression simplifies to 13/6.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the numerator:\n\n1. 5/sqrt80: Simplified to sqrt5/4. Correct.\n\n2. sqrt845/9: Simplified to 13sqrt5/9. Correct.\n\n3. sqrt45: Simplified to 3sqrt5. Correct.\n\nThen, adding them: sqrt5*(1/4 +13/9 +3). Let's compute the coefficients:\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\n3 = 108/36.\n\nSo, 9 + 52 + 108 = 169. So, 169/36. So, the numerator is sqrt5*(169/36). Then, we have sqrt( (sqrt5*169/36) / sqrt5 ). The sqrt5 in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving sqrt(169/36) =13/6. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, just thinking again: was that step correct where I took out the sqrt5? Let me see.\n\nThe numerator inside the main square root is (sqrt5*(169/36)), and then that's divided by sqrt5, so:\n\n[ sqrt5*(169/36) ] / sqrt5 = (169/36). So, then taking the square root of 169/36 is indeed 13"

Let me just check if that's a simplified fraction. 13 and 6 have no common factors besides 1, so yes, that's simplified. So, the answer is 13/6.\n\nWait, but let me check again the addition of the coefficients. Let me do it step by step without converting to 36 denominator.\n\nFirst term: 1/4, second term:13/9, third term:3.\n\nAdding them:\n\nFirst, 1/4 +13/9. To add these, common denominator is 36. 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36. So, 9+52=61, so 61/36. Then adding 3, which is 3/1. So, 61/36 + 3 = 61/36 + 108/36 = 169/36. Yes, that's correct. So that part is right.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is sqrt5*(169/36). Then divided by sqrt5, so cancels, so sqrt(169/36)=13/6. So, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 13/6.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying sqrt(845). Let me confirm sqrt(845). 845 divided by 5 is 169, which is 13 squared. So sqrt(845)=sqrt(5*13^2)=13*sqrt5. That's correct. So that term is 13sqrt5 over 9. Okay.\n\nsqrt(45)=sqrt(9*5)=3sqrt5. Correct.\n\nFirst term: 5/sqrt80. sqrt80 is 4sqrt5, so 5/(4sqrt5). Wait, hold on, wait a second. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, in the first term, I had 5 divided by sqrt(80). I said that sqrt(80) is 4sqrt5, so 5 divided by 4sqrt5. But then I"

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt5: (5*sqrt5)/(4*5)=sqrt5/4. Correct.\n\nSo, that seems okay.\n\nSo, all in all, all my steps were correct, no mistakes.
