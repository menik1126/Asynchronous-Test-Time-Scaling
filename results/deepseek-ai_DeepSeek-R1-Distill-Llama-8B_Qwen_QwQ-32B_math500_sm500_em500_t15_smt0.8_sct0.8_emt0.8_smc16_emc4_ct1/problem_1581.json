Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}}+\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9}+\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt5}}.$$\n\nAlright, first, I should probably deal with the numerator inside the square root. That is, the expression:\n\n$$\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}} + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9} + \\sqrt{45}.$$\n\nI need to simplify each of these terms individually before I can add them together. Let's start with each term one by one.\n\nFirst term: $$\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}}.$$\n\nI remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually considered simplified, so I should probably rationalize it. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $\\sqrt{80}$ to get rid of the square root in the denominator.\n\nSo, multiplying numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{80}$:\n\n$$\\dfrac{5 \\times \\sqrt{80}}{\\sqrt{80} \\times \\sqrt{80}} = \\dfrac{5\\sqrt{80}}{80}.$$\n\nSimplify the fraction 5/80. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5:\n\n$$\\dfrac{5\\sqrt{80}}{80} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{80}}{16}.$$\n\nNow, $\\sqrt{80}$ can be simplified. Since 80 is 16 times 5, and 16 is a perfect square:\n\n$$\\sqrt{80} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{16}\\sqrt{5} = 4\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nSo, plugging that back in:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{80}}{16} = \\dfrac{4\\sqrt{5}}{16} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}.$$\n\nOkay, so the first term simplifies to $$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}.$$\n\nMoving on to the second term: $$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9}.$$\n\nHmm, 845 doesn't immediately ring a bell as a multiple of a perfect square. Let me check if it can be"

So, 845 = 5 * 13^2.\n\nTherefore, $$\\sqrt{845} = \\sqrt{5 \\times 13^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{13^2} = 13\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nSo, substituting back into the second term:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9} = \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9}.$$\n\nAlright, so the second term is $$\\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9}.$$\n\nNow, the third term: $$\\sqrt{45}.$$\n\nAgain, let's simplify this. 45 is 9 times 5, and 9 is a perfect square.\n\nSo, $$\\sqrt{45} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{9}\\sqrt{5} = 3\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nSo, the third term is $$3\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nNow, putting it all together, the numerator is:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4} + \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nSince all terms have $\\sqrt{5}$ in them, I can factor that out:\n\n$$\\sqrt{5} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\dfrac{13}{9} + 3 \\right).$$\n\nNow, I need to compute the expression inside the parentheses. Let me compute each part:\n\nFirst, let me write all the fractions with a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 is the same as 3/1). The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36.\n\nConvert each fraction to have a denominator of 36.\n\n- $$\\dfrac{1}{4} = \\dfrac{9}{36}.$$\n- $$\\dfrac{13}{9} = \\dfrac{52}{36}.$$\n- $$3 = \\dfrac{108}{36}.$$\n\nWait, how?

Rationalizing, I get 5*sqrt(80)/80, which is sqrt(80)/16. Then sqrt(80) is 4*sqrt(5), so 4*sqrt(5)/16 simplifies to sqrt(5)/4. That seems correct.\n\nSecond term: sqrt(845)/9. Factoring 845, I got 5*169, which is 5*13^2, so sqrt(845) is 13*sqrt(5), making the term 13*sqrt(5)/9. Correct.\n\nThird term: sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5). Correct.\n\nAdding them together: sqrt(5)/4 + 13*sqrt(5)/9 + 3*sqrt(5). Fact"

Taking the square root gives 13/6. That seems right.\n\nWait, just a second. I think in the numerator we have sqrt(5)*(169/36) divided by sqrt(5). So that's equal to (sqrt(5)/sqrt(5))*(169/36) = 1*(169/36) = 169/36. So, yeah, taking the square root of that gives 13/6. Correct.\n\nYes, seems like I did everything right.
