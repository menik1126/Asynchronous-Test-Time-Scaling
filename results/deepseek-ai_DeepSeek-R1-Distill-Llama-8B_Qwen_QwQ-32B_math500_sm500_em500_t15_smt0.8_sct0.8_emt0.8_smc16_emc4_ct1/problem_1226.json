            "output": "First, I need to understand the given condition and what is being asked. The problem says that \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), which means when \\( n \\) is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. I need to find the remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7.\n\nNext, I'll substitute \\( n \\) with 2 in the expression \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) because \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\). This simplifies the expression to \\( (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n- \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 4 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 6 = 8 \\)\n\nNow, multiply these results together: \\( 4 \\times 6 \\times 8 \\).\n\nMultiplying 4 and 6 gives 24, then multiplying 24 by 8 results in 192.\n\nFinally, find the remainder when 192 is divided by 7. Dividing 192 by 7 gives 27 with a remainder of 3, since \\( 7 \\times 27 = 189 \\) and \\( 192 - 189 = 3 \\).\n\nSo, the remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7 is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n**Given:**\n\\[ n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\n**We need to find:**\nThe remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7.\n\n**Step 1: Substitute \\( n \\) with its equivalent value modulo 7.**\nSince \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), we can replace \\( n \\) with 2 in the expression:\n\n\\[\n(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate each term individually modulo 7"
