            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of the vertical asymptotes a and b, and the horizontal asymptote c for the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14), and then add them all together to get a + b + c. Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I should start by factoring the denominator to find those x-values. The denominator is x\u00b2 -5x -14. Let me see if I can factor that.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 could be -7 and 2 because (-7)*2 = -14 and (-7)+2 = -5. Yeah, that works. So, the denominator factors into (x - 7)(x + 2). So, the vertical asymptotes are at x = 7 and x = -2. Therefore, a = -2 and b = 7 or vice versa. Since the problem just says x = a and x = b, the order doesn't matter for addition. So, a + b = -2 + 7 = 5.\n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I recall that the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. In this case, the numerator is a linear term (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic (degree 2). The rule I remember is that if the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote but maybe an oblique or slant asymptote.\n\nSo here, since the numerator's degree is 1 and the denominator's is 2, the horizontal asymptote should be y = 0. Thus, c = 0.\n\nNow, adding them all up: a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. Factoring the denominator: x\u00b2 -5x -14. If I plug in x=7: 49 -35 -14 = 0."

            "output": " x=-2: 4 +10 -14 = 0. Yep, correct.\n\nFor the horizontal asymptote, it's definitely y=0 because the degree of denominator is higher. So, c=0. So, adding them up: -2 +7 is 5, plus 0 is 5.\n\nI think I got it right. So, the final answer should be 5.\n</think>\n\nThe vertical asymptotes are found by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for \\(x\\). The denominator \\(x^2 -5x -14\\) factors into \\((x - 7)(x + 2)\\), giving vertical asymptotes at \\(x = 7\\) and \\(x = -2\\). Thus, \\(a = -2\\) and \\(b = 7\\), so \\(a + b = 5\\). The horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the numerator and denominator. Since the degree of the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 2, the horizontal asymptote is \\(y = 0\\), so \\(c = 0\\). Summing these values gives \\(a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
