            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote for the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). Then, I have to add those values together to get a + b + c. Hmm, let's see. I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but the numerator isn't zero at those points. And horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. \n\nFirst, maybe I should factor the denominator to find the vertical asymptotes. The denominator is x² - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring that. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, the factors of 14 are 1 and 14, 2 and 7. If I take 2 and -7, they multiply to -14 and add to -5. Yeah, that works. So, the denominator factors into (x + 2)(x - 7). \n\nSo, the function becomes f(x) = (2x)/[(x + 2)(x - 7)]. Now, vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7 because those are the values that make the denominator zero, and the numerator isn't zero there. Let me just check the numerator at x = -2: 2*(-2) = -4, which is not zero. At x = 7: 2*7 = 14, also not zero. So, vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x = 7, so a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nNow, for the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. \n\nThe leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1 (from x²). So, the horizontal asymptote is y = 2/1 = 2. So, c = 2.\n\nNow, a, b, and c are -2, 7, and 2 respectively. So, adding them together: -2 + 7 + 2. Let me compute that: -"
