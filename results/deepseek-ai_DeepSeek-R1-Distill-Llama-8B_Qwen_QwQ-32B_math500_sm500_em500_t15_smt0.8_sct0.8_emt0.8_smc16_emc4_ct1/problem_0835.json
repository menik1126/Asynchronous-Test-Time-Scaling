Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but I can try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I want to understand what the expression looks like. The numerator is (x - y), and the denominator is (x\u2074 + y\u2074 + 6). Both x and y are variables, so I might need to use some calculus or maybe some algebraic manipulation to find the maximum value.\n\nI remember that when optimizing expressions, methods like using partial derivatives (since there are two variables) or maybe substituting variables can be useful. Let me see if substitution is possible here.\n\nWait, maybe I can express y in terms of x? Or maybe set one variable as a function of the other? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can consider symmetry or make a substitution that simplifies the expression.\n\nI notice that both x\u2074 and y\u2074 are present. Maybe I can let u = x\u00b2 and v = y\u00b2, but then the numerator becomes (x - y), which introduces a cross term. That might complicate things because the substitution would only help with the denominator.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set t = y/x, assuming x is not zero. That way, I can express y as t*x, and then the expression becomes (x - t*x)/(x\u2074 + (t*x)\u2074 + 6). Let me try that.\n\nSo, let me write y = t*x. Then the numerator becomes x - t*x = x(1 - t). The denominator becomes x\u2074 + (t*x)^4 + 6 = x\u2074 + t^4*x^4 + 6 = x^4(1 + t^4) + 6.\n\nSo, the entire expression becomes [x(1 - t)] / [x^4(1 + t^4) + 6]. Hmm, that seems like it might be helpful because now I can consider it as a function of x for a fixed t. Let me denote that as f(x, t) = [x(1 - t)] / [x^4(1 + t^4) + 6].\n\nIf I fix t, then for what x is f(x, t) maximized? Let"

To maximize this, maybe take derivative with respect to x?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set z = x^2, but not sure. Let me try taking the derivative.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = (A x)/(B x^4 + 6). Then f'(x) = [A*(B x^4 +6) - A x*(4 B x^3)] / (B x^4 +6)^2.\n\nSet numerator to zero: A*(B x^4 +6) - 4 A B x^4 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by A (assuming A \u2260 0, so t \u22601):\n\nB x^4 +6 -4 B x^4 =0 \u2192 -3 B x^4 +6 =0 \u2192 3 B x^4 =6 \u2192 x^4 = 6/(3 B) = 2/B.\n\nTherefore, x^4 = 2/(B) = 2/(1 + t^4). So x = \u00b1 (2/(1 + t^4))^{1/4}.\n\nHmm, so for each t \u22601, the maximum over x would be at x = (2/(1 + t^4))^{1/4} or negative? Wait, but the numerator is A x, so if A is positive, then x should be positive to maximize, and if A is negative, x should be negative. Since A = (1 - t), so when t <1, A is positive, so x positive. When t>1, A is negative, so x negative. Hmm, okay.\n\nSo, substituting back into f(x,t):\n\nLet me compute f(x,t) at x = (2/(1 + t^4))^{1/4} when t <1 (so A positive). Let me compute x^4 = 2/(1 + t^4). So denominator becomes B x^4 +6 = (1 + t^4)*(2/(1 + t^4)) +6 = 2 +6 =8. So denominator is 8.\n\nNumerator is A x = (1 - t) * [ (2/(1"

So x = (2)^{1/4} / (1 + t^4)^{1/4}.\n\nTherefore, numerator is (1 - t) * (2)^{1/4} / (1 + t^4)^{1/4}.\n\nSo overall, f(x,t) = (1 - t) * 2^{1/4} / (1 + t^4)^{1/4} / 8.\n\nWait, denominator was 8, so it's 8, but 8 = 2^3, so overall:\n\nf(x,t) = [ (1 - t) * 2^{1/4} ] / [ (1 + t^4)^{1/4} * 8 ].\n\nSimplify 8 as 2^3, so 8 = 2^3.
