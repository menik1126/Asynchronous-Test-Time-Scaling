Hmm, that seems a bit complex because it's a function of two variables. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with functions of multiple variables, one common method to find maxima or minima is by using calculus, specifically partial derivatives. Since the function is a fraction, I might need to use some optimization techniques, maybe Lagrange multipliers, or perhaps substitute one variable in terms of the other to simplify.\n\nLet me first try substitution since that might be simpler. Maybe I can express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) or vice versa. Looking at the function, the numerator is \\(x - y\\), which suggests that if I fix \\(x\\), I can express \\(y\\) as \\(x - t\\), but I'm not sure if that will help. Alternatively, maybe set \\(y = kx\\) where \\(k\\) is a constant, so that I can express everything in terms of one variable. Let me try that.\n\nLet’s assume \\(y = kx\\). Then, substituting into the function:\n\nNumerator becomes \\(x - y = x - kx = x(1 - k)\\).\n\nDenominator becomes \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6 = x^4 + (k x)^4 + 6 = x^4(1 + k^4) + 6\\).\n\nSo, the function simplifies to \\(\\frac{x(1 - k)}{x^4(1 + k^4) + 6}\\).\n\nHmm, okay. Now, this is a function of \\(x\\) for a given \\(k\\). Maybe I can find the maximum with respect to \\(x\\) for each \\(k\\), and then find the maximum over all \\(k\\).\n\nTo find the maximum with respect to \\(x\\), let me take the derivative of the function with respect to \\(x\\) and set it to zero.\n\nLet’s denote \\(f(x) = \\frac{x(1 - k)}{x^4(1 + k^4) + 6}\\). Let’s compute \\(f'(x)\\).\n\nUsing the quotient rule: \\(f'(x) = \\frac{("

Wait, at k=1, equation is -20, at k=2, it's -3, still negative.\n\nAt k=3, positive 116. So, crossing zero between k=2 and k=3.\n\nAlternatively, but perhaps the real solutions are more than two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try k= (some fraction). Alternatively, perhaps this approach is too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that the maximum found earlier at point (1, -1) is 1/4, and maybe the substitution approach doesn't yield a higher maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute f(k) at k = something else, like k = -0.5.\n\nThen, f(-0.5) ≈ [3*(1 - (-0.5))*(0.7598)]/[19 + (-0.5)^4] = [3*1.5*0.7598]/[19 + 0.0625] ≈ [4.5347]/19.0625 ≈ 0.239, which is less than 1/4.\n\nAlternatively,"

The first gives 1/4, the second gives -1/4. So, the maximum is 1/4.\n\nBut let me check if there are other critical points. The equations led us to y = -x, but maybe there are other solutions?\n\nWait, when we set the partial derivatives to zero, we derived that either y = x or y = -x, but y = x led to no solution, so only y = -x gives solutions. So, the only critical points are (1, -1) and (-1, 1). So, that's it.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value is 1/4.\n\nWait, but let me check another point just to be safe. For example, take x = 2, y = 0.\n\nThen numerator is 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nDenominator is 16 + 0 +6 =22.
