Hmm, let me recall how complex number rotations work. \n\nFirst, I know that rotating a complex number \\( z \\) around another complex number \\( c \\) can be done by translating the system so that \\( c \\) becomes the origin, then applying the rotation, and then translating back. The steps involve translating \\( z \\) by subtracting \\( c \\), rotating the result, and then adding \\( c \\) back.\n\nSo, let me note down the given values:\n- \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\)\n- \\( c = 2 - 3i \\)\n\nI think the first step is to translate \\( z \\) by subtracting \\( c \\). That would give me \\( z - c \\). Let me compute that.\n\nCalculating \\( z - c \\):\n\\( z - c = [2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i] - [2 - 3i] \\)\nLet me distribute the subtraction:\n= \\( (2 - 2) + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i + 3i \\)\nSimplifying real and imaginary parts:\nReal part: \\( 0 + \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\nImaginary part: \\( -3i - 3\\sqrt{2}i + 3i = (-3 + 3) - 3\\sqrt{2}i = 0 - 3\\sqrt{2}i = -3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\nSo, \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\n\nGot that. So after translation, the complex number becomes \\( \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\). \n\nNext, I need to rotate this by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians counter-clockwise. The rotation of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) by an angle \\( \\theta \\) can be done by multiplying by \\( \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\). So"
