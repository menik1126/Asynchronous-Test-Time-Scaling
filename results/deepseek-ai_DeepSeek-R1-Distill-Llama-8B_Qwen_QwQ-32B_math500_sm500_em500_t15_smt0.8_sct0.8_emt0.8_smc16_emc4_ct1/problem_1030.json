Then, once I have all these factors, I have to compute the sum of their values at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nHmm, okay, let's start by looking at the given polynomial: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). It's an eighth-degree polynomial, so factoring it into smaller polynomials should give me some factors whose degrees add up to 8.\n\nFirst, I notice that the polynomial resembles a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). If I let \\( y = x^4 \\), then the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Let me try to factor that quadratic.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), this gives \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nWait, but \\( x^4 - 1 \\) can be factored further because it's a difference of squares. \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\). And then \\( x^2 - 1 \\) can be factored again into \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\).\n\nSo, putting that all together, the original polynomial becomes:\n\\( (x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1) \\).\n\nBut wait, is \\( x^4 + 4 \\) factorable over the integers? I remember that sometimes quartic polynomials can be factored into quadratics. Let me check if \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be written as a product of two quadratics.\n\nAssume \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2"

Expanding the right side:\n\\( x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd \\).\n\nNow, equate this to \\( x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4 \\). So, setting up the equations:\n1. \\( a + c = 0 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^3 \\) is 0)\n2. \\( ac + b + d = 0 \\) (coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is 0)\n3. \\( ad + bc = 0 \\) (coefficient of \\( x \\) is 0)\n4. \\( bd = 4 \\) (constant term is 4)\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( c = -a \\).\n\nFrom equation 4: Since \\( b \\) and \\( d \\) are integers, possible pairs are (1,4), (2,2), (-1,-4), (-2,-2). Let's try these.\n\nFirst, try \\( b = 2 \\) and \\( d = 2 \\). Then from equation 2: \\( a*(-a) + 2 + 2 = -a² + 4 = 0 \\), so \\( a² = 4 \\), hence \\( a = 2 \\) or \\( a = -2 \\).\n\nIf \\( a = 2 \\), then \\( c = -2 \\). Check equation 3: \\( (2)(2) + (-2)(2) = 4 - 4 = 0 \\). Perfect! So, this works.\n\nSo, the factors are \\( (x² + 2x + 2)(x² - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nTherefore, the original polynomial factors as:\n\\( (x² + 2x + 2)(x² - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x² + 1) \\).\n\nNow, let me verify if each of these factors is irreducible over the integers.\n\n- \\( x² + 2x + 2 \\): discriminant is \\( 4 - 8 = -4 < 0 \\), so it doesn't factor into real linear factors, so it's"
