Then, I have to compute the sum of each polynomial evaluated at 1.\n\nFirst, I notice that the polynomial is of degree 8, and it looks kind of like a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Let me rewrite it:\n\n\\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4)^2 + 3x^4 - 4 \\).\n\nYeah, that seems right. So, maybe I can factor this quadratic in \\( x^4 \\). Let me set \\( y = x^4 \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\).\n\nI can try to factor this quadratic. Let me look for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as:\n\n\\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\).\n\nReplacing \\( y \\) back with \\( x^4 \\), we get:\n\n\\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nAlright, so now I have factored the original polynomial into two polynomials: \\( x^4 + 4 \\) and \\( x^4 - 1 \\). Let me check if these can be factored further.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\), I remember that it's a difference of squares. So,\n\n\\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\).\n\nAnd \\( x^2 - 1 \\) factors further into \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\). So putting it all together,\n\n\\( x^4 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nNow, looking at \\( x^4 + 4 \\). This might be tricky because it's a sum of squares. But wait, I remember that sometimes it can be factored as a product of quadratics. Specifically"

Let me verify that:\n\nMultiply \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\):\n\nFirst, \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\).\nThen, \\( x^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3 \\).\nAnd \\( x^2 * 2 = 2x^2 \\).\nNext, \\( 2x * x^2 = 2x^3 \\).\n\\( 2x * (-2x) = -4x^2 \\).\n\\( 2x * 2 = 4x \\).\nThen, 2 * x^2 = 2x^2.\n2 * (-2x) = -4x.\n2 * 2 = 4.\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n- \\( x^4 \\).\n- \\( (-2x^3 + 2x^3) = 0 \\).\n- \\( (2x^2 - 4x^2 + 2x^2) = 0 \\).\n- \\( (4x - 4x) = 0 \\).\n- \\( +4 \\).\n\nSo, altogether, \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Great, that works. So,\n\n\\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nNow, I need to check if these quadratics can be factored further over the integers.\n\nLooking at \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\), the discriminant is \\( (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\), which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals, let alone integers. Similarly, \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) has discriminant \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), also doesn't factor over integers.\n\nSo, altogether, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\( (x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x +"

So, the original was degree 8, and each factor's degrees add up to 8.\n\n1. \\( x + 1 \\): degree 1\n2. \\( x - 1 \\): degree 1\n3. \\( x^2 + 1 \\): degree 2\n4. \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\): degree 2\n5. \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\): degree 2\n\nAdding up degrees: 1+1+2+2+2=8.
