The series can be grouped into pairs:\n\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify Each Pair:**\n   Each pair of numbers results in \\(-1\\):\n\n   \\[\n   1 - 2 = -1 \\\\\n   3 - 4 = -1 \\\\\n   5 - 6 = -1 \\\\\n   \\vdots \\\\\n   99 - 100 = -1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the Number of Pairs:**\n   There are 100 numbers in total, so there are \\(100 \\div 2 = 50\\) pairs.\n\n4. **Compute the Total Sum:**\n   Each pair contributes \\(-1\\), and there are 50 pairs:\n\n   \\[\n   50 \\times (-1) = -50\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(\\boxed{-50}\\)"
