Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( 3^{2x} \\) is the same as \\( (3^2)^x \\), which simplifies to \\( 9^x \\). So, substituting that back into the equation, it becomes \\( 9^x + 19 = 10^x \\). That seems a bit simpler.\n\nNow, I'm dealing with exponential terms on both sides, \\( 9^x \\) and \\( 10^x \\). I remember that exponential functions can sometimes be manipulated by taking logarithms, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here. Maybe I can try to see if there's a value of x that makes both sides equal.\n\nLet me test some integer values for x to see if the equation holds true.\n\nStarting with x = 0:\n\\( 9^0 + 19 = 1 + 19 = 20 \\)\n\\( 10^0 = 1 \\)\nSo, 20 ≠ 1. Not a solution.\n\nNext, x = 1:\n\\( 9^1 + 19 = 9 + 19 = 28 \\)\n\\( 10^1 = 10 \\)\n28 ≠ 10. Not a solution.\n\nHow about x = 2:\n\\( 9^2 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100 \\)\n\\( 10^2 = 100 \\)\nOh, 100 = 100! So, x = 2 is a solution.\n\nWait, but maybe there are more solutions. Let me check x = 3:\n\\( 9^3 + 19 = 729 + 19 = 748 \\)\n\\( 10^3 = 1000 \\)\n748 ≠ 1000. So, not equal here.\n\nWhat about x = 0.5? Let me try a fractional value.\nCalculating \\( 9^{0.5} \\) is \\( \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\), so:\n\\( 3 + 19 = 22 \\)\n\\( 10^{0.5} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162 \\)\n22 ≠ 3.162. Not a solution.\n\nMaybe between"

Let's check x=1.5:\n\\( 9^{1.5} = 9^{1} \\times 9^{0.5} = 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\)\nSo, \\( 27 + 19 = 46 \\)\n\\( 10^{1.5} = 10^{1} \\times 10^{0.5} \\approx 10 \\times 3.162 = 31.62 \\)\n46 ≠ 31.62. So, not equal here either.\n\nWhat about x between 0 and 0.5? Let's try x=0.3:\n\\( 9^{0.3} \\) is approximately... Hmm, I might need to use logarithms here. Let's compute ln(9^0.3) = 0.3 ln(9) ≈ 0.3 * 2.197 ≈ 0.659. So, \\( 9^{0.3} ≈ e^{0.659} ≈ 1.933 \\).\nThen, 1.933 + 19 ≈ 20.933\n\\( 10^{0.3} ≈ e^{0.3 ln(10)} ≈ e^{0.3*2.302} ≈ e^{0.6906} ≈ 2. Let me compute it more accurately: 0.3 * 2.302 ≈ 0.6906; e^0.6906 ≈ 2. So, 2.\n\n20.933 ≈ 2? No, so not a solution.\n\nSo, so far, the only solution I found is x=2.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another solution for x < 0? Let me test x = -1:\n\\( 9^{-1} + 19 = \\frac{1}{9} + 19 ≈ 0.111 + 19 ≈ 19.111 \\)\n\\( 10^{-1} = 0.1 \\)\n19.111 ≠ 0.1. Not equal.\n\nHmm, perhaps only x=2 is the solution.\n\nBut let me try to see graphically or algebraically if there could be more solutions.\n\nLooking at the original equation \\( 9^x + 19 = 10^x \\), I can rewrite it as \\( 10^x - 9^x = 19 \\).\n\nLet me"

Then, the equation becomes f(x) = 19.\n\nI know that as x approaches infinity, \\( 10^x \\) grows much faster than \\( 9^x \\), so f(x) will go to infinity.\n\nAs x approaches negative infinity, both \\( 10^x \\) and \\( 9^x \\) approach zero, but \\( 10^x \\) approaches zero slower than \\( 9^x \\) because 10 > 9. So, f(x) would approach zero from the positive side.\n\nAt x=0, f(0) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nAt x=1, f(1) = 10 - 9 = 1.\n\nAt x=2, f(2) = 100 - 81 = 19. That's our solution.\n\nNow, since f(x) increases from 0 at x=0 to 19 at x=2, and then continues to increase beyond that, but let's check the behavior around x=2.\n\nWait, but since 10^x grows faster than 9^x, f(x) is an increasing function. Therefore, f(x) =19 will have only one solution at x=2.\n\nBut, to confirm, let me check the derivative of f(x). The derivative f’(x) = ln(10) * 10^x - ln(9) * 9^x. Since ln(10) > ln(9), and 10^x > 9^x for x>0, f’(x) is positive for all x. Therefore, f(x) is strictly increasing, which means that the equation f(x)=19 can have only one solution.\n\nTherefore, x=2 is the only solution.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\( 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x \\) can be simplified by recognizing that \\( 3^{2x} = 9^x \\). This transforms the equation into \\( 9^x + 19 = 10^x \\). Testing various values, we find that \\( x = 2 \\) satisfies the equation. Analyzing the function \\( f(x) = 10^x - 9^x \\), we determine it is strictly increasing, confirming \\( x = 2 \\) as the"
