Region X is labeled near the point (2, 0), which is inside the smallest circle. Therefore, Region X is the area between the smallest circle (radius 4) and the middle circle (radius 6).\n\nRegion Y is labeled near the point (5, 0), which falls between the middle circle (radius 6) and the largest circle (radius 7). Thus, Region Y is the area between the middle and largest circles.\n\nRegion Z is labeled near the point (6.5, 0), which is outside the largest circle. Therefore, Region Z is the area of the largest circle itself, encompassing all previous regions.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the areas for each region:\n\n1. **Area of Region X**: This is the area between the smallest and middle circles, which can be found by subtracting the area of the smallest circle from the area of the middle circle.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of X} = \\pi (6^2) - \\pi (4^2) = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Area of Region Y**: This is the area between the middle and largest circles. It's calculated by subtracting the area of the middle circle from the area of the largest circle.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of Y} = \\pi (7^2) - \\pi (6^2) = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. **Area of Region Z**: This is simply the area of the largest circle.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of Z} = \\pi (7^2) = 49\\pi\n   \\]\n\nNow, to find the difference between the largest and smallest areas:\n\n- **Largest Area**: Region Z with an area of \\(49\\pi\\).\n- **Smallest Area**: Region X with an area of \\(20\\pi\\).\n\nSubtracting these areas gives:\n\n\\[\n49\\pi - 20\\pi = 29\\pi\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the difference between the areas of"
