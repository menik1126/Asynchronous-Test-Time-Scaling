The formula for the area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. Using the given radii of 4, 6, and 7, the areas are:\n\n- Circle with radius 4: \u03c0(4)\u00b2 = 16\u03c0\n- Circle with radius 6: \u03c0(6)\u00b2 = 36\u03c0\n- Circle with radius 7: \u03c0(7)\u00b2 = 49\u03c0\n\nNext, I'll identify the regions based on these areas. The largest area is the outermost region Z, which is the area between the radius 7 circle and the radius 6 circle. The area of region Z is 49\u03c0 - 36\u03c0 = 13\u03c0.\n\nThe smallest area is region X, which is the area of the circle with radius 4. Thus, the area of region X is 16\u03c0. \n\nFinally, region Y is the area between the radius 6 circle and the radius 4 circle. Its area is 36\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = 20\u03c0.\n\nThe difference between the greatest area (Z) and the smallest area (X) is 13\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = -3\u03c0. Since the problem asks for the positive difference, it is 3\u03c0.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the difference between the greatest and smallest areas among regions \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\), let's analyze each region step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the area of each circle:**\n   - **Circle with radius 4:**  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 6:**  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 7:**  \n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the areas of the regions:**\n   - **Region \\(X\\):** Area between the inner circle (4) and the middle circle (6).  \n     \\[\n     \\text{"

Let me recheck the regions. The Asymptote code shows:\n- The outermost circle (radius 7) is filled lightgray, labeled \\(Z\\).\n- The middle circle (radius 6) is filled gray, labeled \\(Y\\).\n- The innermost circle (radius 4) is filled white, labeled \\(X\\).\n\nWait, actually, the regions are:\n- **Region \\(X\\):** The innermost circle (radius 4).  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of } X = 16\\pi\n  \\]\n- **Region \\(Y\\):** The annulus between radii 4 and 6.  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of } Y = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\n  \\]\n- **Region \\(Z\\):** The annulus between radii 6 and 7.  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of } Z = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n  \\]\n\nThus, the largest area is \\(Y = 20\\pi\\), and the smallest is \\(Z = 13\\pi\\).
