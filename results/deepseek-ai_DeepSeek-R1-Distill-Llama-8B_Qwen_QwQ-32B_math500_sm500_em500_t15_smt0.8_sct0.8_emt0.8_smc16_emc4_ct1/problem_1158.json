            "output": "I see that both sides of the equation have the same base, which is 3. This is helpful because if the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold true.\n\nNext, I'll rewrite the left side of the equation using the power of a power property. This simplifies to 3 raised to the power of 6 times k.\n\nNow, I can set the exponents of the same base equal to each other. This means 6 times k must equal 6.\n\nFinally, to solve for k, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 6, which gives me k equals 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\) in the equation \\( (3^k)^6 = 3^6 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
