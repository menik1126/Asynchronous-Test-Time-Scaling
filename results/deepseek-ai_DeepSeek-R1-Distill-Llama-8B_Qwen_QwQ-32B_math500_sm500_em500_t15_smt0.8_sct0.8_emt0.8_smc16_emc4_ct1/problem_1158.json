Applying this to the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   \n   Now, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   3^{6k} = 3^6\n   \\]\n   Since the bases are the same and the expressions are equal, their exponents must be equal. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \n   Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to find \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   The value of \\( k \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1}\n   \\]"
