There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rotations per second for Gear 1} = \\frac{33\\frac{1}{3}}{60} \\approx 0.556 \\text{ rotations per second}\n\\]\n\nNext, for Gear 2, which turns 45 times per minute, I'll perform a similar conversion:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rotations per second for Gear 2} = \\frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \\text{ rotations per second}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two rotation periods to determine when both gears will align their marks due north. The rotation period of each gear in seconds is:\n\n\\[\nT_1 = \\frac{1}{0.556} \\approx 1.8 \\text{ seconds per rotation}\n\\]\n\\[\nT_2 = \\frac{1}{0.75} = 1.\\overline{3} \\text{ seconds per rotation}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the LCM of these periods will give the time when both gears realign. However, since \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) are not whole numbers, it's more practical to work with their fractional forms to find an exact solution.\n\nExpressing the periods as fractions:\n\n\\[\nT_1 = \\frac{60}{33\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{60 \\times \\frac{4}{1}}{109} = \\frac{240}{109} \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\\[\nT_2 = \\frac{60}{45} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTo find the LCM, I'll convert the periods to their simplest fractional forms and then determine their LCM.\n\nAfter computing, the LCM of \\(\\frac{240}{109}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) is \\(\\frac{240}{109} \\times 3 = \\"

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the LCM of the rotation times in terms of their periods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of rotations each gear makes in a certain time and find when both have completed an integer number of rotations.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let’s denote the time in seconds when both marks align again as \\(t\\). At this time, the number of rotations each gear has made must be an integer. \n\nFor Gear 1, the number of rotations in \\(t\\) seconds is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rotations of Gear 1} = \\left(33\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = \\frac{100}{3} \\times \\frac{t}{60} = \\frac{100t}{180} = \\frac{5t}{9}\n\\]\n\nFor Gear 2, the number of rotations in \\(t\\) seconds is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rotations of Gear 2} = \\left(45 \\times \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = \\frac{45t}{60} = \\frac{3t}{4}\n\\]\n\nWe need both \\(\\frac{5t}{9}\\) and \\(\\frac{3t}{4}\\) to be integers. Therefore, \\(t\\) must be a multiple of both \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\). \n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of these two fractions can be found by taking the LCM of the numerators divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominators. \n\nAlternatively, to find the smallest \\(t\\) such that \\(t\\) is a multiple of both \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\), we can express this as finding the LCM of the two periods. \n\nAlternatively, since \\(t\\) must satisfy:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5t}{9} = \\text{integer} \\implies t = \\frac{9}{5}k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{3t}{4} = \\text{integer} \\implies t"
