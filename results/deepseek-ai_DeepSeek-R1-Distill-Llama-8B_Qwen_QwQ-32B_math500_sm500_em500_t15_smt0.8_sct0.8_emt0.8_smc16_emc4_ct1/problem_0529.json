Once Yann has chosen a dish, Camille has 9 remaining options because she cannot select the same dish as Yann.\n\nTo find the total number of combinations, I multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has after Yann's selection.\n\nSo, the total number of meal combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find out how many different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n- **Total Dishes Available:** 10\n- **Restriction:** Yann and Camille cannot order the same dish.\n- **Differentiation:** It matters who orders what, meaning Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Choices for Yann**\n- Since there are 10 dishes and no restrictions on Yann's choice, Yann has **10** possible dishes to order.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Choices for Camille**\n- After Yann has chosen a dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish. Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining dishes to choose from.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Combinations**\n- Multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has:\n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThere are \\(\\boxed{90}\\) different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order."

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
