This means I need to subtract the cases where both Yann and Camille choose the same dish.\n\nThere are 10 possible situations where they choose the same dish (both choose dish 1, both choose dish 2, and so on up to dish 10).\n\nBy subtracting these 10 identical combinations from the total of 100, we get the number of valid combinations where they order different dishes.\n\nTherefore, the final number of different meal combinations is 90.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Possible Combinations (Without Restrictions):**\n\n   - Yann has 10 choices of dishes.\n   - For each of Yann's choices, Camille also has 10 choices.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total combinations} = 10 \\times 10 = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract the Cases Where They Order the Same Dish:**\n\n   - There are 10 scenarios where both Yann and Camille choose the same dish (e.g., both choose dish 1, both choose dish 2, etc.).\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Identical combinations} = 10\n   \\]\n   \n   - Subtract these identical cases from the total combinations:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Different combinations} = 100 - 10 = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
