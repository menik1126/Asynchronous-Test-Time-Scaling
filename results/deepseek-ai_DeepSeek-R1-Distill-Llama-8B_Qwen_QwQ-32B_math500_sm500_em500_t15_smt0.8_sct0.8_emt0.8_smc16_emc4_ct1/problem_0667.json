            "output": "First, I'll define the weights of each item using variables. Let T represent the weight of one treek, S represent the weight of one squig, and G represent the weight of one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives me the equation:\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nFrom the second statement, Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This gives me the equation:\n2T + G = S.\n\nNext, I'll substitute the second equation into the first to express everything in terms of S. From 2T + G = S, I can solve for G:\nG = S - 2T.\n\nNow, substitute G back into the first equation:\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T).\nSimplify:\n10T = 4S - 2T.\nCombine like terms:\n12T = 4S.\nFinally, solve for T:\nT = (4S)/12 = S/3.\n\nSo, one treek weighs one-third of a squig. Therefore, three treeks weigh one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Given:**\n1.
