            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about Central H.S. students and their bus ridership. The table gives the percentage of males and females from each grade who are bus riders. There are 300 males and 300 females in each grade surveyed. The question is asking for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out how many males and females are bus riders in each grade because the problem mentions 300 males and 300 females surveyed per grade. Since the percentages are given, I can calculate the actual numbers by multiplying the percentages by 300.\n\nSo for each grade, I can compute the number of male bus riders as (percentage of males) * 300, and similarly for females. Let's do that for each grade.\n\nStarting with the 9th grade: males are 41.1%, so that's 41.1% of 300. Let me calculate that: 0.411 * 300 = 123.3 males. Females are 39.4%, so 0.394 * 300 = 118.2 females. \n\nOkay, so for 9th grade, males are 123.3 and females are 118.2. The question is about when male riders are closest to 135% of female riders. So I need to see if for any grade, the number of males is around 1.35 times the number of females.\n\nLet me write down what 135% of female riders would be for each grade and then see how close the males are to that.\n\nStarting again with the 9th grade: 118.2 females. 135% of that is 1.35 * 118.2. Let me compute that: 118.2 * 1.35. Hmm, 100*1.35=135, 18.2*1.35, which is 135 + (0.2*1.35)=135 + 0.27=135.27. So total is 135 + 135.27=270.27. So 270.27 is 135% of 118.2. The number of male riders is 123.3, which is 123.3 / 270.27 \u2248 0.456, or about 45.6% of 135%."

            "output": " Wait, that's not right. Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation here.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recalculate 1.35 * 118.2. Let's do it step by step. 100 * 1.35 is 135, 18 * 1.35 is 24.3, and 0.2 *1.35 is 0.27. So adding those together: 135 +24.3 = 159.3 +0.27 = 159.57. Oh, I see, I added wrong before. So 1.35 * 118.2 is actually 159.57. So the male riders are 123.3. So how does 123.3 compare to 159.57? The question is asking for the male riders to be closest to 135% of female riders. So 135% of female riders is 159.57, but the actual male riders are 123.3, which is less than that. So the ratio of male to female is 123.3 / 118.2 \u2248 1.043, so about 104.3%, which is not 135%. Hmm, so maybe I need to compute the ratio of male riders to female riders, and see which one is closest to 135%.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. The question says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders\". So that would mean (Male riders) \u2248 1.35*(Female riders). So the ratio (Male / Female) \u2248 1.35. So I need to compute for each grade the ratio of male riders to female riders, and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nAh, that's probably the right approach. Let me confirm. If the male riders are 135% of female riders, then Male = 1.35*Female, so Male/Female = 1.35. So the ratio of male to female riders should be as close as possible to 1.35. So"

So 9th grade is not the one.\n\nNext, 10th grade:\n\nMales: 34.4% of 300 = 34.4 * 3 = 103.2\n\nFemales: 33.1% of 300 = 99.3\n\nRatio: 103.2 / 99.3 \u2248 1.036\n\nStill lower than 1.35.\n\n11th grade:\n\nMales: 20.6% of 300 = 61.8\n\nFemales: 13.8% of 300 = 41.4\n\nRatio: 61.8 / 41.4 \u2248 1.491\n\nOkay, this is getting closer to 1.35 but still higher. 1.491 is approximately 1.49, which is a bit higher than 1.35.\n\n12th grade:\n\nMales: 11.6% of 300 = 34.8\n\nFemales: 8.6% of 300 = 25.8\n\nRatio: 34.8 / 25.8 \u2248 1.346\n\nHmm, that's 1.346, which is very close to 1.35. So 1.346 is only slightly less than 1.35, so that's a very good candidate.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 34.8 /25.8. Let me do that division more accurately.\n\n25.8 goes into 34.8 once, with 9 left over. 25.8 *1=25.8, subtract: 34.8-25.8=9. So 9 /25.8= 0.347 approx. So total is 1.347, which is approximately 1.35. So 1.347 is very close to 1.35, with only about 0.003"

So 1.494 compared to 1.35. How much is the difference?\n\n1.494 -1.35=0.144.\n\nAnd for the 12th grade, 1.347 -1.35= -0.003, so the difference is 0.003. That's much closer. So 12th grade is closer to 1.35 than 11th grade.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the 11th grade. Let me see: 61.8 divided by 41.4. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as (61.8 \u00f7 41.4):\n\nLet me compute 61.8 \u00f741.4:\n\nLet me write it as 61.8 /41.4 = ?\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate decimals: 618 /414.\n\nDivide 618 by 414: 414 *1 =414, subtract from 618, we get 204.\n\n204 \u00f7414 = 0.4925.\n\nSo total is 1 +0.4925=1.4925, which is about 1.4925.

So the difference from 1.35 is about 0.1425, which is more than the difference in the 12th grade.\n\nSo 12th grade is closer.\n\nWait, but I should also check for 9th,10th, and 12th. Wait I'm seeing that 12th grade is 1.347, 11th is 1.4925, so 12th is the closest.\n\nBut perhaps I should check 9th and 10th grades to ensure. Let me see:\n\nFor 9th grade: 1.043.

The ratio is 1.4925, which is 1.4925. The difference between that and 1.35 is 0.1425. So 0.1425 is the difference. The 12th grade's difference is 0.003, so that's way closer. \n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the 12th grade calculation. Let me recalculate the numbers again to be sure.\n\n12th grade males: 11.6% of 300. 10% is 30, so 11.6% is 30*1.16=34.8. That's correct.\n\nFemales:8.6% of 300. 8% is 24, 0.6% is 1.8, so total 25.8. Correct.\n\n34.8 divided by 25.8. Let me do this division again. 25.8 *1.3 = 25.8 + 25.8*0.3 =25.8 +7.74=33.54. Hmm, 1.3 times 25.8 is 33.54. But the male riders are 34.8, which is 34.8 -33.54=1.26 more. So 1.26 /25.8 \u22480.0488. So total ratio is 1.3 +0.0488\u22481.3488, so approximately 1.3488, which is about 1.349. So that's 1.349, which is 0.001 less than 1.35. So the difference is 0.001. Wait, actually, 1.35 -1.3488=0.0012"

            "output": ", so the difference is about 0.0012.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because 25.8 *1.35 is 25.8 + (25.8 *0.35). Let me compute 25.8 *0.35: 25 *0.35=8.75, 0.8*0.35=0.28, so total 8.75+0.28=9.03. So 25.8 *1.35=25.8 +9.03=34.83. So the male riders are 34.8, which is 34.8, and 1.35 times females would be 34.83. So the male riders are just 34.8, which is 0.03 less than 34.83. So the ratio is 34.8 /25.8 = (25.8*1.3488) /25.8=1.3488, which is 1.3488, so 1.3488 compared to 1.35, the difference is 0.0012. That's 0.12% difference, which is extremely close.\n\nSo that's the closest. Let me check the 11th grade again. 61.8 divided by41.4. Let me use exact calculation.\n\n41.4 goes into 61.8 once, making 41.4. Subtract that from 61.8, you get 20.4. Now, 41.4 goes into 20.4 how many times? 0.492 times because 41.4 * 0.5=20.7, which is a bit more than 20.4, so it's approximately 0.492. So 1.492 times, as before. So 1.492, which is 1.492, compared to 1.35. The difference is 0.142, which is bigger than the 0.0012 difference in the 12th grade.\n\nTherefore, the 12th grade has the closest ratio, with male riders at 1.3488 times the female riders, which is very close to 1.35.\n\nSo, the answer should be the 12th grade.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining the grade where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders"
