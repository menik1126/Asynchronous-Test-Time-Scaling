            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where \u03c9 is a complex number satisfying \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst off, \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity: 1, and the two complex roots which are usually written as \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\). These complex roots satisfy certain properties, so maybe I can use those to simplify the expression.\n\nI think it would be useful to note that the sum of all cube roots of unity is zero. That is, 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. Because if you add them up, the real parts cancel out and you get zero. This might come in handy later on.\n\nNow, looking at the expression: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). I need to find its value for each non-real \u03c9 (since when \u03c9 = 1, the denominators become 2, so the expression would be 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, but I think the problem is asking about the other two roots, \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2, since they are different). \n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values,\" so maybe I need to consider all three cases, including \u03c9 = 1. Let me check:\n\nIf \u03c9 = 1, then the expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\).\n\nIf \u03c9 \u2260 1, then we can use the property 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, which means \u03c9\u00b2 = -1 - \u03c9. Maybe I can use this to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me first handle the case when \u03c9 \u2260 1. So, let's denote \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) and \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3), but maybe working with algebra is better here.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, find"

So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} = \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nWait, the numerator simplifies to 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2). But from the equation 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, we know that \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, substituting that in:\n\nNumerator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo numerator is 1. Now the denominator is (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, expand (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2):\n\n= 1*(1) + 1*\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9*1 + \u03c9*\u03c9\u00b2\n\n= 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3\n\nBut \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. Therefore, substituting:\n\n= 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1\n\n= (1 + 1) + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)\n\n= 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)\n\nAgain, since \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1, this becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is 1. So the entire expression simplifies to 1/1 = 1.\n\nWait, hold on. So when \u03c9 \u2260 1, the expression is also 1? But that contradicts my initial thought that maybe there are different values. Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, so if I compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nDenominator: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1? Let me verify step by step.\n\nExpanding (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2):\n\nFirst term: 1*1 = 1\n\nSecond term: 1*\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b2\n\nThird term"

So denominator is 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 1/1 = 1.\n\nSo, whether \u03c9 is 1 or \u03c9 is a primitive cube root, the expression evaluates to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but this seems counterintuitive because when I plug in \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3), I may expect a different result. Let me compute the expression numerically to verify.\n\nLet's compute 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2), where \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3). \n\nFirst, \u03c9 = cos(2\u03c0/3) + i sin(2\u03c0/3) = -1/2 + i*(\u221a3)/2.\n\nSo 1 + \u03c9 = 1 + (-1/2) + i*(\u221a3)/2 = 1/2 + i*(\u221a3)/2.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 + \u03c9) = \\(\\frac{1}{1/2 + i\u221a3/2}\\).\n\nTo compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n= [1 * (1/2 - i\u221a3/2)] / [(1/2)^2 + (\u221a3/2)^2]\n\nDenominator: (1/4) + (3/4) = 1. So denominator is 1.\n\nThus, 1/(1 + \u03c9) = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = cos(4\u03c0/3) + i sin(4\u03c0/3) = -1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + (-1/2) - i\u221a3/2 = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = [1 * (1/2 + i\u221a3/2)] / [(1/2)^2 + (\u221a3"

So it's 1. So even when I plug in the complex number, it's 1. So maybe the expression is always 1 regardless of \u03c9. So the only possible value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1. So all possible values are just 1. Thus, the final answer should be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity, including \u03c9 = 1.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
