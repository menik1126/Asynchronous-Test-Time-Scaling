I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst off, ω³ = 1, so ω is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity: 1, and the two complex roots which are usually written as \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\). These complex roots satisfy certain properties, so maybe I can use those to simplify the expression.\n\nI think it would be useful to note that the sum of all cube roots of unity is zero. That is, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Because if you add them up, the real parts cancel out and you get zero. This might come in handy later on.\n\nNow, looking at the expression: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). I need to find its value for each non-real ω (since when ω = 1, the denominators become 2, so the expression would be 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, but I think the problem is asking about the other two roots, ω and ω², since they are different). \n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values,\" so maybe I need to consider all three cases, including ω = 1. Let me check:\n\nIf ω = 1, then the expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\).\n\nIf ω ≠ 1, then we can use the property 1 + ω + ω² = 0, which means ω² = -1 - ω. Maybe I can use this to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me first handle the case when ω ≠ 1. So, let's denote ω = e^(2πi/3) and ω² = e^(4πi/3), but maybe working with algebra is better here.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, find"

So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} = \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nWait, the numerator simplifies to 2 + (ω + ω²). But from the equation 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we know that ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, substituting that in:\n\nNumerator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo numerator is 1. Now the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, expand (1 + ω)(1 + ω²):\n\n= 1*(1) + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω²\n\n= 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, substituting:\n\n= 1 + ω² + ω + 1\n\n= (1 + 1) + (ω + ω²)\n\n= 2 + (ω + ω²)\n\nAgain, since ω + ω² = -1, this becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is 1. So the entire expression simplifies to 1/1 = 1.\n\nWait, hold on. So when ω ≠ 1, the expression is also 1? But that contradicts my initial thought that maybe there are different values. Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, so if I compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nDenominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³ = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1?

            "output": ": ω*1 = ω\n\nFourth term: ω*ω² = ω³.\n\nSo, altogether: 1 + ω + ω² + ω³.\n\nNow, since ω³ = 1, that becomes 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nBut ω + ω² = -1, so 2 + (-1) = 1. So denominator is 1.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 1/1 = 1.\n\nSo, whether ω is 1 or ω is a primitive cube root, the expression evaluates to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but this seems counterintuitive because when I plug in ω = e^(2πi/3), I may expect a different result. Let me compute the expression numerically to verify.\n\nLet's compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²), where ω = e^(2πi/3). \n\nFirst, ω = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i*(√3)/2.\n\nSo 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2) + i*(√3)/2 = 1/2 + i*(√3)/2.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 + ω) = \\(\\frac{1}{1/2 + i√3/2}\\).\n\nTo compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n= [1 * (1/2 - i√3/2)] / [(1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2]\n\nDenominator: (1/4) + (3/4) = 1. So denominator is 1.\n\nThus, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, ω² = e^(4πi/3) = cos(4π/3) + i sin(4π/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2) - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 + ω²) = [1 * (1/2 + i√3/2)] / [(1/2)^2 + (√3"

So even when I plug in the complex number, it's 1. So maybe the expression is always 1 regardless of ω. So the only possible value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1. So all possible values are just 1. Thus, the final answer should be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity, including ω = 1.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
