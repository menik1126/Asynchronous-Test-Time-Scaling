            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, since ω³ = 1, ω is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1. These are the solutions to the equation x³ = 1.\n\nBut the problem is asking specifically about the expression involving ω and ω². So maybe I should consider each of the three cases: ω = 1, ω = some primitive cube root, and ω² = the other primitive cube root.\n\nWait, but if ω = 1, then let's plug into the expression: \\(\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\). So if ω is 1, the value is 1.\n\nBut ω can also be a primitive cube root, meaning ω ≠ 1. Let me denote ω as e^(2πi/3) and ω² as e^(4πi/3). These are complex numbers on the unit circle at 120° and 240°, respectively.\n\nHmm, maybe instead of working with the complex numbers directly, I can use some algebraic identities to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me denote the expression as E:\n\nE = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\)\n\nI can try to combine these two fractions into a single fraction. To do that, I need a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So:\n\nE = \\(\\frac{1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega^2) + 1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\\)\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nNumerator = (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nDenominator = (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)"

So the denominator becomes:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nWait, so Numerator = 2 + ω + ω² and Denominator = 2 + ω + ω². Therefore, E simplifies to (2 + ω + ω²) / (2 + ω + ω²) = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So regardless of ω, as long as ω³ = 1, which is true, the expression E equals 1. But when ω = 1, I also got 1, and when ω is a primitive cube root, I still get 1.\n\nHold on, does this mean that E is always equal to 1, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is? That seems surprising, but algebraically it checks out. The numerator and denominator are the same, so they cancel out, leaving 1.\n\nBut wait, is this always the case? Let me verify by plugging in a specific primitive cube root.\n\nLet’s take ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2. Then ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nCompute 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2. Its inverse is (1/2 - i√3/2)/( (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/ (1/4 + 3/4) ) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2. Its inverse is (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSo adding the two inverses:"

Therefore, it seems that regardless of whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root, the expression E is equal to 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value of the expression is 1.\n\nWait, but the question says \"find all possible values\". Does that mean 1 is the only value? Because even when ω is 1, the expression is 1, and when ω is a primitive cube root, it's still 1. So regardless of which cube root ω is, the expression is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nHmm, but let me think again: was there any step where I assumed something that might not hold? For instance, when I expanded (1 + ω)(1 + ω²), I substituted ω³ = 1. That's correct because ω is a cube root of unity, so ω³ = 1.\n\nAnd then the denominator became 2 + ω + ω². The numerator was also 2 + ω + ω², so they canceled out, giving 1.\n\nAnother thought: 1 + ω + ω² = 0, since ω is a primitive cube root. So 1 + ω + ω² = 0, which can be proven from the equation x³ - 1 = 0, factoring as (x - 1)(x² + x + 1) = 0, so the roots satisfy x² + x + 1 = 0, meaning 1 + ω + ω² = 0.\n\nSo that's another way to see why 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + ( -1 ) = 1. Because 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1. Thus, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 -1 = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So if I substitute back, the numerator and denominator become 1, so E = 1/(1) = 1.\n\nSo whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root, because 1 + ω +"

Wait, but in the case when ω = 1, the numerator and denominator would be different?\n\nWait, let me check again when ω = 1:\n\nNumerator: 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4?\n\nWait, hold on, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, no, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, when ω = 1, then the numerator is 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4?\n\nBut earlier, when I computed the expression directly when ω = 1, I had 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But according to the numerator and denominator approach, numerator would be 4 and denominator would also be 4, so 4/4 = 1. So that's okay. So that still works.\n\nWait, but when ω = 1, the denominator (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) would be (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 * 2 = 4, so numerator is 4, so 4/4 = 1. So that's correct.\n\nBut when ω is a primitive root, then ω + ω² = -1, so numerator is 2 + (-1) = 1, denominator is also 1, so 1/1 = 1. So in both cases, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1. So the possible value is just 1. So the problem says \"enter all the possible values\", but since it's always 1, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that when ω is 1, the expression is valid? Let me check again.\n\nIf ω = 1, then the denominators are 1 + 1 = 2, so no division by zero. So that's okay. So the expression is valid for all cube roots"
