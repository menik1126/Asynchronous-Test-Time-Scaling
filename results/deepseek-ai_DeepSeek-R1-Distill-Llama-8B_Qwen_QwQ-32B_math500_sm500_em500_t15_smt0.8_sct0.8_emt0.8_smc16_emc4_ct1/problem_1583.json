            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of (5 divided by the square root of 80 plus the square root of 845 over 9 plus the square root of 45), all divided by the square root of 5. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression to make it clearer:\n\n\u221a[(5/\u221a80 + \u221a845/9 + \u221a45) / \u221a5]\n\nAlright, so I have a big numerator inside the square root, and then it's divided by \u221a5. I think the first step is to simplify each of the terms in the numerator before dealing with the overall fraction.\n\nStarting with 5/\u221a80. I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually simplified, so I should rationalize the denominator. To do that, I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by \u221a80. That gives me:\n\n5\u221a80 / 80\n\nBut wait, \u221a80 can be simplified. Let me factor 80 to see if it has any square factors. 80 is 16 times 5, right? And 16 is a perfect square. So:\n\n\u221a80 = \u221a(16\u00d75) = \u221a16\u00d7\u221a5 = 4\u221a5\n\nSo substituting back, 5\u221a80 / 80 becomes 5\u00d74\u221a5 / 80. Let me compute that:\n\n(5\u00d74\u221a5)/80 = (20\u221a5)/80 = (1/4)\u221a5\n\nOkay, so 5/\u221a80 simplifies to (1/4)\u221a5. That was the first term.\n\nNext, the second term is \u221a845 / 9. I should try to simplify \u221a845. Let's factor 845. Hmm, 845 divided by 5 is 169. And 169 is 13 squared. So:\n\n845 = 5 \u00d7 169 = 5 \u00d7 13\u00b2\n\nTherefore, \u221a845 = \u221a(5\u00d713\u00b2) = \u221a13 \u00d7 \u221a13 \u00d7 \u221a5 = 13\u221a5\n\nWait, no, actually, \u221a(13\u00b2 \u00d7 5) is 13\u221a5. So, \u221a845 is 13\u221a5. So the second term becomes:\n\n13\u221a5 / 9\n\nGot that. So the second term is (13\u221a5)/9.\n\nNow the third term"

            "output": " is \u221a45. Let's simplify that. 45 is 9\u00d75, and 9 is a perfect square:\n\n\u221a45 = \u221a(9\u00d75) = \u221a9 \u00d7 \u221a5 = 3\u221a5\n\nSo the third term is 3\u221a5.\n\nAlright, so now I can rewrite the original numerator with the simplified terms:\n\n(1/4)\u221a5 + (13\u221a5)/9 + 3\u221a5\n\nHmm, all these terms have \u221a5 in them, so I can factor that out. Let me write that as:\n\n\u221a5 [1/4 + 13/9 + 3]\n\nNow I need to compute the sum inside the brackets. Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) is 36.\n\nSo, converting each term:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = 52/36\n\n3 = 108/36\n\nAdding them together:\n\n9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = 169/36\n\nSo, the entire numerator is \u221a5 multiplied by 169/36, which is:\n\n(169/36)\u221a5\n\nOkay, so now the expression under the square root is:\n\n[(169/36)\u221a5] / \u221a5\n\nBecause the original expression was the square root of (numerator divided by \u221a5). So now I have:\n\n\u221a[ (169/36)\u221a5 / \u221a5 ]\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. The numerator after simplifying was (169/36)\u221a5, and it was all divided by \u221a5. So the expression under the square root becomes:\n\n[(169/36)\u221a5] / \u221a5\n\nWhich is equal to (169/36)\u221a5 / \u221a5.\n\nHmm, \u221a5 divided by \u221a5 is 1, right? Because square roots cancel out when you divide. So that simplifies to 169/36.\n\nSo now, we just have \u221a(169/36). Let's compute that.\n\n\u221a(169/36) = \u221a169 / \u221a36 = 13 / 6\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst term: 5/"

Correct.\n\nAdding them up: (1/4)\u221a5 + (13/9)\u221a5 + 3\u221a5. Factored out \u221a5 correctly. Then converted to a common denominator: 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, and 3 is 108/36. Sum is 9+52+108=169. So 169/36\u221a5. Correct.\n\nThen the expression becomes \u221a[(169/36\u221a5)/\u221a5] = \u221a(169/36) = 13/6. Yes, that makes sense. Because \u221a5 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving 169/36, whose square root is 13/6.\n\nOkay, so I think that's correct.
