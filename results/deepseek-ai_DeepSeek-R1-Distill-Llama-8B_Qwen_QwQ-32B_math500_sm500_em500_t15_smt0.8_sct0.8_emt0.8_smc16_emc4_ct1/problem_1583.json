            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of (5 divided by the square root of 80 plus the square root of 845 over 9 plus the square root of 45), all divided by the square root of 5. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression to make it clearer:\n\n√[(5/√80 + √845/9 + √45) / √5]\n\nAlright, so I have a big numerator inside the square root, and then it's divided by √5. I think the first step is to simplify each of the terms in the numerator before dealing with the overall fraction.\n\nStarting with 5/√80. I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually simplified, so I should rationalize the denominator. To do that, I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by √80. That gives me:\n\n5√80 / 80\n\nBut wait, √80 can be simplified. Let me factor 80 to see if it has any square factors. 80 is 16 times 5, right? And 16 is a perfect square. So:\n\n√80 = √(16×5) = √16×√5 = 4√5\n\nSo substituting back, 5√80 / 80 becomes 5×4√5 / 80. Let me compute that:\n\n(5×4√5)/80 = (20√5)/80 = (1/4)√5\n\nOkay, so 5/√80 simplifies to (1/4)√5. That was the first term.\n\nNext, the second term is √845 / 9. I should try to simplify √845. Let's factor 845. Hmm, 845 divided by 5 is 169. And 169 is 13 squared. So:\n\n845 = 5 × 169 = 5 × 13²\n\nTherefore, √845 = √(5×13²) = √13 × √13 × √5 = 13√5\n\nWait, no, actually, √(13² × 5) is 13√5. So, √845 is 13√5. So the second term becomes:\n\n13√5 / 9\n\nGot that. So the second term is (13√5)/9.\n\nNow the third term"

            "output": " is √45. Let's simplify that. 45 is 9×5, and 9 is a perfect square:\n\n√45 = √(9×5) = √9 × √5 = 3√5\n\nSo the third term is 3√5.\n\nAlright, so now I can rewrite the original numerator with the simplified terms:\n\n(1/4)√5 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5\n\nHmm, all these terms have √5 in them, so I can factor that out. Let me write that as:\n\n√5 [1/4 + 13/9 + 3]\n\nNow I need to compute the sum inside the brackets. Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) is 36.\n\nSo, converting each term:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = 52/36\n\n3 = 108/36\n\nAdding them together:\n\n9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = 169/36\n\nSo, the entire numerator is √5 multiplied by 169/36, which is:\n\n(169/36)√5\n\nOkay, so now the expression under the square root is:\n\n[(169/36)√5] / √5\n\nBecause the original expression was the square root of (numerator divided by √5). So now I have:\n\n√[ (169/36)√5 / √5 ]\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. The numerator after simplifying was (169/36)√5, and it was all divided by √5. So the expression under the square root becomes:\n\n[(169/36)√5] / √5\n\nWhich is equal to (169/36)√5 / √5.\n\nHmm, √5 divided by √5 is 1, right? Because square roots cancel out when you divide. So that simplifies to 169/36.\n\nSo now, we just have √(169/36). Let's compute that.\n\n√(169/36) = √169 / √36 = 13 / 6\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst term: 5/"

Factored out √5 correctly. Then converted to a common denominator: 1/4 is 9/36, 13/9 is 52/36, and 3 is 108/36. Sum is 9+52+108=169. So 169/36√5. Correct.\n\nThen the expression becomes √[(169/36√5)/√5] = √(169/36) = 13/6. Yes, that makes sense. Because √5 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving 169/36, whose square root is 13/6.\n\nOkay, so I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the steps.\n</think>\n\nThe simplified expression is \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{6}}.
