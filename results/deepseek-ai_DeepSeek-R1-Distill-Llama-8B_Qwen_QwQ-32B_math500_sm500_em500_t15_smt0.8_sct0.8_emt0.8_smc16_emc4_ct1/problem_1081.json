Term 1: 0 (given)\n2. Term 2: 0 + 1 = 1\n3. Term 3: 1 × 1 = 1\n4. Term 4: 1 + 2 = 3\n5. Term 5: 3 × 2 = 6\n6. Term 6: 6 + 3 = 9\n7. Term 7: 9 × 4 = 36\n8. Term 8: 36 + 5 = 41\n9. Term 9: 41 × 7 = 287\n10. Term 10: 287 + 8 = 295\n11. Term 11: 295 × 9 = 2655\n\nContinuing this way, I find that Term 11 is the first term that exceeds 125.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to find the first term greater than 125.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Sequence Rules**\n\n- **Starting Point:** The first term is 0.\n- **Operations:** \n  - Add the next integer.\n  - Multiply by the next integer.\n  - Repeat, alternating between addition and multiplication.\n\n**Step 2: Generate the Sequence**\n\nLet's compute each term using the rules:\n\n1. **Term 1:** 0\n2. **Term 2:** \\( 0 + 1 = 1 \\)\n3. **Term 3:** \\( 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)\n4. **Term 4:** \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n5. **Term 5:** \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)\n6. **Term 6:** \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\)\n7. **Term 7:** \\( 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\)\n8. **Term 8:** \\( 36 + 5 = 41 \\)\n9. **Term 9:** \\( 41 \\times 7 = 287 \\) \n10. **Term 10:** \\("

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
