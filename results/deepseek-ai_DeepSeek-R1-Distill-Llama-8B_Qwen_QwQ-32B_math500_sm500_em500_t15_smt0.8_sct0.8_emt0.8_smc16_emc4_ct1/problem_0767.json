The problem has two main properties:\n\n1. For every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is a geometric sequence.\n2. For every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAdditionally, we're given that a₁₃ = 2016, and we need to find a₁.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\nA geometric sequence has the property that each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. So, if we have three terms in a geometric sequence: b, c, d, then c/b = d/c, which implies c² = b*d.\n\nAn arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, has the property that each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if we have three terms in an arithmetic sequence: c, d, e, then d - c = e - d, which implies 2d = c + e.\n\nGiven that, let's try to unpack the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of the sequence. It's a strictly increasing sequence, so each term is larger than the previous one. That means all the terms are positive integers, and a_{n+1} > a_n for all n.\n\nNow, the sequence is defined such that for every k, the terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} form a geometric sequence. Let's denote the common ratio of these geometric sequences as r_k. So, for each k, we have:\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r_k\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k = a_{2k-1} * r_k²\n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic sequences, the terms a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic sequence with common difference d_k. So, the middle term is the average of the first and third terms, which gives:\n\na"

Since r must be a rational number? Because r₂ has to be a ratio of integers (since all terms are integers). Wait, but the terms are integers, so the ratios must be rational?\n\nWait, actually, the terms are integers, so the ratios must be rational numbers. Because if a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = r_k, then since a_{2k} and a_{2k-1} are integers, r_k must be a rational number. Similarly, the arithmetic sequences require that the difference is an integer, so the terms must be integers.\n\nTherefore, r must be a rational number. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe r is an integer? Let's see.\n\nSuppose that r is an integer. Then, r₂ = 2 - 1/r. Since r is an integer, 1/r is a fraction, so unless r divides 1, which would require r=1, but then r₂ would be 2 -1 =1. But if r=1, then the geometric sequence would be constant, but the sequence is strictly increasing, so that can't be. So r must be an integer greater than 1, but then 1/r is a fraction, so r₂ would not be an integer. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe r is a fraction. Let me suppose that r is a fraction p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors. Then, r₂ = 2 - (q/p). To have r₂ also a ratio of integers, that would require that 2 is expressed as a fraction with denominator p, so 2 = 2p/p, so 2p/p - q/p = (2p - q)/p. So r₂ = (2p - q)/p. Since r₂"

Since r₂ is the ratio of a₄ to a₃, and a₃ is an integer, then a₄ must be a multiple of a₃ if r₂ is a rational number. But since a₄ is an integer, yes, that would hold.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted. Maybe I can think about the entire structure.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let me define the terms in terms of a₁, r, and perhaps another parameter, say d, for the arithmetic progression. But since each triplet is defined both geometrically and arithmetic, maybe we can find a relationship between r and d.\n\nWait, for the first triplet, a₁, a₂, a₃ is geometric: a₂ = a₁ r, a₃ = a₁ r².\n\nThen, for the arithmetic triplet, a₂, a₃, a₄: 2a₃ = a₂ + a₄ => a₄ = 2a₃ - a₂ = 2a₁ r² - a₁ r.\n\nSimilarly, for the next triplet, a₃, a₄, a₅ is geometric: a₄ = a₃ s, where s is the common ratio for this triplet. So, a₄ = a₃ s = a₁ r² s, but from earlier, a₄ = 2a₁ r² - a₁ r.

That suggests perhaps my initial assumption that r₁ must be integer is incorrect, or perhaps I've missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps we can have 6r₁ -5 as a non-integer rational number, but since a₁*(6r₁ -5)^2=2016 must be integer, and a₁ is integer, 6r₁ -5 must be rational.\n\nWait, but earlier we deduced that r₁ must be integer because n=1, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nEarlier, when we tried to impose that (k m - (k-1) n ) must be divisible by n for all k, we found that it forced n=1.\n\nBut perhaps that reasoning was flawed. Let me revisit that.\n\nWe had that for all k,\n\n(k m - (k -1) n ) must be divisible by n.\n\nSo,\n\nk m -k n +n ≡0 mod n\n\n=> k(m -n ) +n ≡0 mod n\n\n=> k(m -n ) ≡-n mod n\n\nBut -n mod n is 0, so:\n\nk(m -n ) ≡0 mod n.\n\nBut this must hold for all k, which can be any positive integer.\n\nTherefore, (m -n ) must be such that for any k, k(m -n ) ≡0 mod n.\n\nBut for k=1: m -n ≡0 mod n => m ≡n mod n => m ≡0 mod n.\n\nBut since m and n are coprime, as r₁=m/n is in lowest terms, m cannot be congruent to 0 mod n unless n=1.\n\nTherefore, indeed, n=1, so r₁ must be integer.\n\nTherefore, our initial conclusion holds: r₁ must be integer.\n\nTherefore,"
