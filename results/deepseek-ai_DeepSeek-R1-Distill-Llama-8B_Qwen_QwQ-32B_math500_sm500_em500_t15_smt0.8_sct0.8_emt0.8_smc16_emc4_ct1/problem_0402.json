This will give the next time both marks point north simultaneously.\n\nFirst, Gear 1 makes \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) rotations per minute. Converting this to a fraction, it equals \\(\\frac{100}{3}\\) rotations per minute. Multiply by 60 seconds to find the time per rotation in seconds: \\(\\frac{100}{3} \\times 60 = 2000\\) seconds per rotation.\n\nNext, Gear 2 makes 45 rotations per minute. Multiply by 60 seconds to get the time per rotation: \\(45 \\times 60 = 2700\\) seconds per rotation.\n\nNow, I'll list the rotation times for each gear:\n- Gear 1: 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 10000, 12000, 14000, 16000, 18000, 20000, 22000, 24000, 26000, 28000, 30000, 32000, 34000 seconds.\n- Gear 2: 2700, 5400, 8100, 10800, 13500, 16200, 18900, 21600, 24300, 27000, 29700, 32400, 35100, 37800, 40500, 43200, 45900, 48600 seconds.\n\nIdentifying the common multiples from both lists, the smallest is 27000 seconds.\n\nFinally, after 27000 seconds, both gears will align their marks pointing due north.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n- **Gear 1:** Turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute.\n- **Gear 2:** Turns \\(45\\) times per minute.\n- **Initial Position:** Both gears have a mark pointing due north.\n\n**Objective:** Find the next time (in seconds) when both gears have their marks pointing due north **simultaneously**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand Gear Rotation\nEach gear must complete a full rotation (360°) to have its mark point due north again.
