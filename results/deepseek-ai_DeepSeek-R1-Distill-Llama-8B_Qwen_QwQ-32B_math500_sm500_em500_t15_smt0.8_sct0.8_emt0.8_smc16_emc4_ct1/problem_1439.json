This requires \\( k = 2^{24/n} \\), so \\( 24/n \\) must be an integer. Thus, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\n4. **Exclude \\( n = 2 \\), \\( n = 4 \\), and \\( n = 8 \\):**\n   \n   While these divisors technically divide 24, the problem specifies \\( n > 1 \\), but we need to ensure \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power. However, all divisors of 24 greater than 1 are valid because \\( 2^{24/n} \\) is an integer for each. Wait, this contradicts the previous step. Let me re-examine.\n\n   Wait, actually, all divisors of 24 greater than 1 are valid because \\( 24/n \\) must be an integer. Therefore, all divisors \\( n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \\) are valid. But the problem asks for how many such \\( n \\), so the count is 7. But the initial reasoning in the problem's thought process only listed 3,6,12,24. That was a mistake.\n\n   Wait, let me correct this. The problem says \"perfect nth power\". A perfect nth power means that the number can be written as \\( k^n \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer. For \\( 2^{24} \\), this requires that \\( 24 = n"

So, the number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) is equal to the number of divisors of 24 greater than 1.\n\n   The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Excluding 1, there are 7 divisors. However, in the initial problem's thought process, it concluded 4, which seems incorrect. But wait, perhaps the thought process was only considering the \"proper\" divisors or some other condition. Let me re-examine.\n\n   Actually, no. The correct number is 7. Because for each divisor \\( n \\) of 24 where \\( n > 1 \\), \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect nth power. For example:\n   - \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \\)\n   - \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 \\)\n   - \\( n = 4 \\): \\( 2^{24} = (2^6)^4 \\)\n   - \\( n = 6 \\): \\( 2^{24} = (2^4)^6 \\)\n   - \\( n = 8 \\): \\( 2^{24} = (2^3)^8 \\)\n   - \\( n = 12 \\): \\( 2^{24} = (2^2)^{12} \\)\n   - \\( n = 24 \\): \\( 2^{24} = (2^1)^{24} \\)\n\n   Therefore, there are 7 such integers \\( n > 1 \\). However, the initial thought process mistakenly concluded only 4, possibly due to a misunderstanding. \n\n   But upon reviewing, the correct number is 7. Therefore, the final answer is 7.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{7}"
