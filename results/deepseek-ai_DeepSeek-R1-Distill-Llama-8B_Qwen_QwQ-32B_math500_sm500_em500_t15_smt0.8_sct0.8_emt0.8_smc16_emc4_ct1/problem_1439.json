Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a number to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power. If a number \\( x \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, then there exists some integer \\( k \\) such that \\( x = k^n \\). So, in this case, \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nThat means I'm looking for all integers \\( n > 1 \\) where \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as some integer raised to the \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power. I know that \\( 2^{24} \\) is already a power of 2, so maybe this can help simplify things.\n\nLet me write \\( 2^{24} \\) as \\( (2^m)^n \\), where \\( m \\) is some exponent. Then, \\( (2^m)^n = 2^{24} \\). Using exponent rules, this becomes \\( 2^{m \\cdot n} = 2^{24} \\). Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, \\( m \\cdot n = 24 \\).\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to finding all positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that there exists an integer \\( m \\) with \\( m \\cdot n = 24 \\). That is, \\( m = 24/n \\). Since \\( m \\) must also be an integer (because \\( 2^m \\) must be an integer), \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\). Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nBut wait, \\( n \\) needs to be greater than 1. So, let's list all the divisors of 24 and then exclude 1. The divisors of 24 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n\nSince \\( n > 1 \\), we exclude 1, leaving"

Each \\( n \\) in the list 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 divides 24, so \\( 24/n \\) will be an integer \\( m \\). Then \\( 2^{24} = (2^{m})^n \\), which is indeed a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n\nFor example, if \\( n = 2 \\), then \\( m = 24/2 = 12 \\), so \\( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \\). Similarly, for \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m = 8 \\), so \\( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 \\), and so on.\n\nIs there any \\( n \\) that I might have missed? Let me think. Divisors come in pairs, so if \\( n \\) is a divisor, so is \\( 24/n \\). I included all the divisors greater than 1, so 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. That should cover all possible \\( n \\).\n\nAnother way to think about it is prime factorization. The exponent 24 can be broken down into its prime factors. Since 24 factors into \\( 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\), the exponents in the prime factorization can be divided by \\( n \\). Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24, which aligns with my earlier reasoning.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power is 7.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we start by recognizing that \\( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \\) for some integer \\( m \\). This implies \\( m \\cdot"
