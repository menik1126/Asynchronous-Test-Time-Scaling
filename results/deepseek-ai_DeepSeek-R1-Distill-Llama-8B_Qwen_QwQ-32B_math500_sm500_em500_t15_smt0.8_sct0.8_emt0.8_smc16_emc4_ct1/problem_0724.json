            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms, and I need to find the value of x. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I'll write down the equations so I can see them clearly.\n\nThe first equation is:\nlog base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2. In mathematical terms, that's:\nlog₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2\n\nThe second equation is:\nlog base y of 5x equals 2. So that's:\nlog_y(5x) = 2\n\nHmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help here. Let me recall that when you add two logs with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying the arguments. So for the first equation, I can use that property.\n\nApplying the logarithm addition rule:\nlog₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\nAlright, so that simplifies the left side to a single log expression. Now, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form to get rid of the logarithm. Remember that if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So, applying that here:\n\n6^2 = (x - y)(x + y)\n\n6 squared is 36, so:\n36 = (x - y)(x + y)\n\nWait, that's a difference of squares. So, (x - y)(x + y) = x² - y². Therefore, the equation becomes:\nx² - y² = 36\n\nSo that's one equation involving x and y. Let me note that down as equation (1).\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation:\nlog_y(5x) = 2\n\nAgain, I can convert this logarithmic equation to its exponential form. That would be:\ny^2 = 5x\n\nSo, y squared equals 5 times x. Let me write that as equation (2):\ny² = 5x\n\nOkay, so now I have two equations:\n1) x² - y² = 36\n2) y² = 5x\n\nMaybe I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to solve for x. Let's try that.\n\n"

            "output": "From equation (2), y² = 5x. So, I can replace y² in equation (1) with 5x.\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\nx² - (5x) = 36\n\nThat simplifies to:\nx² - 5x - 36 = 0\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let me try to factor this, or if that doesn't work, use the quadratic formula.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add to -5. Hmm, let me think. The factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nWait, let me try 6 and -6. 6 * (-6) = -36. But 6 + (-6) = 0, which isn't -5. Maybe 9 and -4? 9 * (-4) = -36, and 9 + (-4) = 5. Hmm, but I need -5. So perhaps -9 and 4: (-9) * 4 = -36, and (-9) + 4 = -5. There we go.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as:\n(x - 9)(x + 4) = 0\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = 9 or x = -4.\n\nWait, but I need to check if these solutions are valid in the original logarithmic equations because logarithms have domain restrictions. The arguments of the logs must be positive.\n\nLooking back at the first equation: log₆(x - y) and log₆(x + y). So, (x - y) > 0 and (x + y) > 0.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log_y(5x) is defined only if 5x > 0 and y > 0, and y ≠ 1.\n\nSo, let's check each solution for x.\n\nFirst, x = 9. Let me find y using equation (2): y² = 5x = 5*9 = 45. So y² = 45, which implies y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Since sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5), approximately 6.708. So, y can be about 6.708"

Good.\n\nCase 2: y negative sqrt(45) ≈ -6.708\nx = 9, y ≈ -6.708\nx - y ≈ 9 - (-6.708) = 15.708 > 0\nx + y ≈ 9 + (-6.708) ≈ 2.292 > 0\nBoth are positive again. So x = 9 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check x = -4.\n\nFrom equation (2): y² = 5*(-4) = -20. Hmm, that gives y² = -20, which is impossible because square of a real number can't be negative. Therefore, y² = -20 has no real solution, so x = -4 is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the substitution again.\n\nFrom equation (1): x² - y² = 36\nFrom equation (2): y² = 5x\n\nSubstituting equation (2) into equation (1): x² - 5x = 36, which leads to x² - 5x -36 = 0, factoring correctly to (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0, solutions x = 9 and x = -4.\n\nThen, checking x = 9: y² = 45, which is valid, and both (9 - y) and (9 + y) are positive regardless of y being positive or negative because y^2 is positive and y can be either sign.\n\nFor x = -4: y² = -20, which is impossible. So, x = -4 is rejected.\n\nTherefore, x must be 9.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer is x = 9.\n</think>\n\nNow, let's provide the"
