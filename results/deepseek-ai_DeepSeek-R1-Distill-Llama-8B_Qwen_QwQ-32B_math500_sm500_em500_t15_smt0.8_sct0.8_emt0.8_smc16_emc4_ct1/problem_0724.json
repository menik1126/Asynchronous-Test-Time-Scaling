            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve: If log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then I need to find x. Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, looking at the two equations given. The first one is about logarithms with base 6, and the second one is about logarithms with base y. It seems like I need to use some logarithm properties to simplify these equations and find a relationship between x and y, then maybe solve for x.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So that means log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. \n\nSo, the left side simplifies to log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. Now, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, right? So that would be x² - y². Therefore, the equation becomes log₆(x² - y²) = 2. \n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c. So, applying that here, x² - y² = 6². That's x² - y² = 36. I'll note that down as equation (1).\n\nMoving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Again, this is a logarithm equation, so I can convert it to exponential form. That means 5x = y^2. Let me write that as equation (2): 5x = y².\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n1. x² - y² = 36\n2. 5x = y²\n\nHmm, okay, so maybe I can substitute y² from equation (2) into equation (1). Let's try that. \n\nFrom equation (2), y² = 5x. Plugging that into equation (1), we get x² - 5x = 36. \n\n"

            "output": "So, now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 5x - 36 = 0. Now, I need to solve for x. Let me try to factor this quadratic. \n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see. The factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6. \n\nTrying  -9 and 4: Because -9 * 4 = -36 and -9 + 4 = -5. Yes, that works. So, the quadratic factors as (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0. Therefore, x = 9 or x = -4.\n\nBut wait, let me check if both solutions make sense in the original equations. Because we have logarithms, the arguments must be positive. So, for log₆(x - y) and log₆(x + y), (x - y) and (x + y) must be positive. Also, in equation (2), since y is the base of a logarithm, y must be positive and not equal to 1. So, I need to ensure that all these conditions are satisfied.\n\nFirst, let's consider x = 9. Then from equation (2), y² = 5*9 = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But since y is the base of a logarithm, y must be positive and not equal to 1. So, y = sqrt(45). Simplify sqrt(45): sqrt(9*5) = 3*sqrt(5). So, y ≈ 3*2.236 ≈ 6.708. \n\nNow, check the arguments in the first logarithm: x - y = 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292 > 0, and x + y ≈ 9 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708 > 0. So, that's okay. So x = 9 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, check x = -4. Then y² = 5*(-4) = -20. But y² can't be negative because y is a real number. So, this is impossible. Therefore, x = -4 is not a valid solution. So, we discard"

Let me just double-check the equations to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with equation (1): x² - y² = 36. If x=9, then y²=45, so 81 - 45 = 36, which is correct.\n\nEquation (2): 5x = y², so 5*9=45, which is correct.\n\nAnd for the logarithms, as I calculated earlier, (x - y) and (x + y) are both positive. So, everything checks out.\n\nSo, yeah, x=9 is the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem:\n\nIf \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\) and \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\), then find \\(x\\).\n\nFirst, we simplify the logarithmic equation using the property that the sum of logarithms is the logarithm of the product:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\n\\]\n\nConverting this to exponential form, we get:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = 6^2 = 36\n\\]\n\nThis is our first equation:\n\n1. \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\)\n\nNext, we simplify the second logarithmic equation:\n\n\\[\n\\log_y (5x) = 2\n\\]\n\nConverting this to exponential form, we get:\n\n\\[\n5x = y^2\n\\]\n\nThis is our second equation:\n\n2. \\(5x = y^2\\)\n\nSubstituting \\(y^2\\) from equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x = 36\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we find:\n\n\\[\n(x - 9)(x + 4) = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\n\\[\nx = 9 \\quad \\text"
