I have to find the sum of the reciprocals of the magnitudes squared of each root, that is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{|r_1|^2} + \\frac{1}{|r_2|^2} + \\frac{1}{|r_3|^2} + \\frac{1}{|r_4|^2} + \\frac{1}{|r_5|^2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. So each term is \\(1/(r_k \\overline{r}_k)\\), which is the same as \\(1/|r_k|^2\\). I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), \\(r \\overline{r} = |r|^2\\), so taking the reciprocal is just \\(1/|r|^2\\).\n\nFirst, let me think about the original equation. It's a 10th-degree polynomial, so there are 10 roots (counting multiplicities), and they come in conjugate pairs because the coefficients are real. That makes sense because the equation is given as a real polynomial (all coefficients are real), so complex roots must come in conjugate pairs. So, the roots are grouped into five pairs, each pair being \\(r_k\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_k\\).\n\nNow, the equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). It might help to set \\(y = 13x - 1\\), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) and adding it to \\(x^{10}\\) to get the polynomial. But that might be complicated. Maybe I can divide both sides by \\(x^{10}\\), but \\(x\\) can't be zero because plugging \\(x=0\\) into the equation gives \\((13*0 -1)^{"

Let me define \\( \\frac{13x - 1}{x} = z \\), so then \\( z^{10} = -1 \\). The solutions for \\( z \\) would be the 10th roots of -1, which can be written as \\( z = e^{i (\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, ..., 9 \\). So those are the complex numbers on the unit circle at angles \\( \\pi/10, 3\\pi/10, ... 19\\pi/10 \\).\n\nSo, solving for x in terms of z: \n\n\\( \\frac{13x - 1}{x} = z \\Rightarrow 13x -1 = z x \\Rightarrow 13x - z x = 1 \\Rightarrow x (13 - z) = 1 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{1}{13 - z} \\)\n\nTherefore, each root \\( r_k \\) of the original equation corresponds to one of these z's. Since there are 10 roots, each of these 10 z's gives a unique x. So the roots are \\( x_k = \\frac{1}{13 - z_k} \\), where \\( z_k^{10} = -1 \\).\n\nBut since we have conjugate pairs, the roots \\( r_j \\) and \\( \\overline{r_j} \\) correspond to some z and its conjugate? Wait, not exactly sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, note that if z is a root of \\( z^{10} = -1 \\), then its conjugate \\( \\overline{z} \\) would satisfy \\( (\\overline{z})^{10} = \\overline{z^{10}} = \\overline{-1} = -"

So, the roots in pairs:\n\nk=0: angle π/10, real part cos(π/10)\n\nk=10: angle π/10 + 2π, same real part, but not in our list since k goes only to 9.\n\nBut in our case, the roots are:\n\nz_0: angle π/10, real part cos(π/10)\n\nz_1: 3π/10, real part cos(3π/10)\n\nz_2: 5π/10=π/2, real part 0\n\nz_3:7π/10, real part cos(7π/10)= -cos(3π/10)\n\nz_4:9π/10, real part cos(9π/10)= -cos(π/10)\n\nz_5:11π/10, real part cos(11π/10)= -cos(π/10)\n\nz_6:13π/10, real part cos(13π/10)= -cos(3π/10)\n\nz_7:15π/10=3π/2, real part 0\n\nz_8:17π/10, real part cos(17π/10)= cos(π +7π/10)= -cos(7π/10)= cos(3π/10)\n\nz_9:19π/10, real part cos(19π/10)= cos(π +9π/10)= -cos(9π/10)= cos(π/10"

Let me make sure: The sum over all roots (10 roots) is 10*170 = 1700, because each |13 - z|^2 = 170 -26 Re(z), and Re(z) sums to 0. So, total sum is 1700.\n\nBut the problem's sum is over five roots (each from a pair), so each contributing |13 - z|^2.

But since Re(z) = Re(\\overline{z}), this is 2*(170 -26 Re(z)). So, for each pair, the contribution is 2*(170 -26 Re(z)). Therefore, the total sum over all 10 roots is sum_{pairs} 2*(170 -26 Re(z_j)).\n\nBut in the problem, it's considering only one root per pair, so the sum would be sum_{pairs} (170 -26 Re(z_j)).\n\nThus, the total sum over all roots would be sum_{all roots} |13 - z|^2 = sum_{pairs} 2*(170 -26 Re(z_j)).\n\nTherefore, if I compute the sum over each pair (so five terms), then the sum over all roots is 2*(sum over pairs of |13 - z_j|^2"

Let me think of an example with a simpler equation to see if this approach works.\n\nSuppose we have an equation like x^2 + (ax - b)^2 =0, and try to compute similar sums. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the steps again.\n\nWe have:\n\nEach root x corresponds to a z with z^10 = -1, so |z|=1.\n\nThen, |13 - z|^2 = 13² + |z|² - 2*13*Re(z) = 169 +1 -26 Re(z) = 170 -26 Re(z). So that's correct.\n\nSum over all z of |13 - z|^2 = sum_{z} (170 -26 Re(z)) = 10*170 -26 sum Re(z). Since sum Re(z)=0, so total is 1700. Therefore, the problem's sum is 1700/2 = 850. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850.\n\nWait, but let me think again why the sum of Re(z) over all roots is zero.\n\nThe roots are the 10th roots of -1, which are symmetrically placed around the unit circle. Since they are roots of z^10 = -1, which is equivalent to z^10 = e^{i\\pi}, so the roots are spaced every π/5 radians starting from π/10. The roots are symmetric with respect to the real axis, so for every root z, there is a root \\overline{z}. Therefore, their real parts are the same, but when summed over all roots, the imaginary parts cancel, but the real parts add. However, the roots are symmetrically placed around the circle, so for every angle θ, there is an angle -θ (mod 2π), so their real parts add up. Wait, but in this"
