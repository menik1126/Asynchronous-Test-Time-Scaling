Specifically, the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r_5}}\\). \n\nFirst, let's recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is the square of the modulus of \\(r\\). So, each term in the sum is essentially \\(|r_i|^{-2}\\). Therefore, the entire expression is the sum of \\(|r_i|^{-2}\\) for \\(i\\) from 1 to 5.\n\nSince the equation is a polynomial of degree 10, there are 10 roots, which come in conjugate pairs as given: \\(r_1, \\overline{r_1}, r_2, \\overline{r_2}, \\dots, r_5, \\overline{r_5}\\). That means each pair contributes two roots, but for the purpose of our sum, each pair will only contribute one term because \\(|r_i| = |\\overline{r_i}|\\). So, effectively, we're summing the reciprocals of the squares of the magnitudes of the five distinct roots.\n\nNow, I think Vieta's formulas might be useful here. Vieta relates the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. But in this case, the polynomial is of degree 10, and considering each root's reciprocal squared modulus, it's not straightforward. So maybe I need to manipulate the polynomial equation or use some substitution to find a relation that connects to the sum we need.\n\nLet me consider the equation: \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). I can rewrite this as \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides would give \\(x = \\omega (13x - 1)\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a "

Hmm, but not sure if that substitution helps immediately. Let's see. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach might be to consider the equation \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Since both sides are raised to the 10th power, perhaps dividing both sides by \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) would help?

Remember that the sum of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression can be found using a formula.\n\nThe formula for the sum of cosines of angles theta_1, theta_1 + d, ..., theta_1 + (n-1)d is sin(n*d/2)/sin(d/2) * cos(theta_1 + (n-1)d/2).\n\nIn our case, the angles start at pi/10, and each subsequent angle increases by 2pi/10 = pi/5.

So the sum is 0.\n\nTherefore, Sum_{k=0}^{9} cos((2k+1)pi/10) = 0.\n\nTherefore, Sum(Re(\\omega)) = 0.\n\nTherefore, going back to the expression for S_total:\n\nS_total = 1700 -26*0 =1700.\n\nThus, the total sum over all 10 roots of |1 - 13\\omega|^2 is 1700. Therefore, the sum S over the five distinct roots is S = S_total / 2 = 1700 / 2 = 850.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that each pair contributes the same term, so the total sum over all roots would be twice the sum over the five distinct roots, so dividing by 2 gives the desired sum. Therefore, the value of the expression is 850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{850}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given equation:\n\\[\nx^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\n\\]\n"
