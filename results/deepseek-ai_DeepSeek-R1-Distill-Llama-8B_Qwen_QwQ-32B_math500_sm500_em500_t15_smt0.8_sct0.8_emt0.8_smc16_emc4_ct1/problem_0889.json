            "output": "I need to convert the fraction 57/160 into a terminating decimal. To do this, I should start by finding the prime factors of both the numerator and the denominator.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 57. Since 57 is divisible by 3, I get 3 \u00d7 19. Both 3 and 19 are prime numbers.\n\nNext, I'll factorize 160. I know that 160 can be divided by 2 multiple times: 2 \u00d7 80, 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 40, 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 20, and finally 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2. So, 160 breaks down into 2\u2075 \u00d7 5.\n\nNow, I'll determine the primary prime factors. The numerator has prime factors of 3 and 19, while the denominator has prime factors of 2 and 5. The only common factor between the numerator and the denominator is 1, which means the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nSince the denominator only has 2s and 5s, and there are no other prime factors, I can apply the rule that a fraction will convert to a terminating decimal. Specifically, the number of decimal places will be determined by the maximum power of 2 or 5 in the denominator's prime factorization. Here, 2\u2075 is present, so there will be 5 decimal places.\n\nTo convert 57/160 to a decimal, I'll perform the division 57 \u00f7 160. I'll start by expressing 57 as 57.000000 and proceed with long division, moving the decimal point five places to the left.\n\nAfter performing the division, I find that 57 divided by 160 equals 0.35625. Therefore, the fraction 57/160 terminates as a decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize both the numerator and the denominator:**\n   \n   - **Numerator (57):** \\(57 = 3 \\times 19\\)\n   - **Denominator (160):** \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5\\)\n\n2. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   \n   Since there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Determine if the"
