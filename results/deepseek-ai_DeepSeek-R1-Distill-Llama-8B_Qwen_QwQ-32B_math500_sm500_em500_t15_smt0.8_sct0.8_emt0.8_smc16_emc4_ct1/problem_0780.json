            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem: I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Then, express that distance as √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a isn't divisible by any square of an integer greater than one. Finally, I have to find a + b. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, the distance from the origin to a point on the graph can be represented by a distance formula. I remember that the distance D between two points (x, y) and (0, 0) is given by D = √(x² + y²). So, in this case, since we're looking at the point (x, y) on the graph y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), I can substitute that into the distance formula.\n\nLet me write that out: D = √(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²). I need to simplify this expression to make it easier to find the minimum distance. Let's square both sides to get rid of the square root. So, D² = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]².\n\nNow, let's compute the second term. Squaring (1/√2)(x² - 3) would give me (1/2)(x² - 3)², right? So, D² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)². I can expand this further to see if it simplifies nicely.\n\nExpanding (x² - 3)², I get x⁴ - 6x² + 9. Then, multiplying that by 1/2 gives me (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + 4.5. So, plugging that back into the equation for D²: D² = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + 4.5.\n\nCombining like terms, that's (1/2)x⁴ + (x² - 3x²) + 4.5, which simplifies to (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 4.5. Hmm, that still looks a bit"

            "output": " messy. Maybe I can multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fraction, which might make taking derivatives easier.\n\nMultiplying each term by 2: 2*D² = x⁴ - 4x² + 9. So, D² = (x⁴ - 4x² + 9)/2. I need to minimize D, which is the same as minimizing D². Let's denote f(x) = (x⁴ - 4x² + 9)/2. To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.\n\nTaking the derivative: f'(x) = (4x³ - 8x)/2. Simplifying that, it's (4x³ - 8x)/2 = 2x³ - 4x. Setting this equal to zero: 2x³ - 4x = 0. Factoring out 2x, we get 2x(x² - 2) = 0. So, the solutions are x = 0 or x² = 2, which means x = √2 or x = -√2.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate f(x) at these critical points to see which gives the minimum value. Let's start with x = 0. Plugging into f(x): f(0) = (0 - 0 + 9)/2 = 9/2, so D² = 9/2, meaning D = 3/√2. But wait, I have to check the other points too.\n\nNow, x = √2: Let's compute f(√2). First, compute x² = (√2)² = 2. Then x⁴ = (x²)² = 4. Plugging into f(x): (4 - 4*2 + 9)/2 = (4 - 8 + 9)/2 = (5)/2. So, D² = 5/2, which means D = √(5/2). Similarly, for x = -√2, since the function f(x) is even (depends on x²), we'll get the same result.\n\nSo, comparing f(0) = 9/2 and f(√2) = 5/2, clearly f(√2) gives a smaller value,"

            "output": " so the minimum distance occurs at x = √2 or x = -√2, and the minimum D is √(5/2). Let me make sure that's correct. Wait, √(5/2) can be expressed as √10 / 2, right? Because √(5/2) is the same as √5 / √2, and rationalizing the denominator gives (√5 * √2) / (√2 * √2) = √10 / 2.\n\nSo, now, the problem says the minimal distance is expressed as √a / b, so √a is √10 and b is 2, meaning a =10 and b=2. Now, a is 10, which is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one because 10 factors into 2*5, neither of which is a square greater than one. So, the expression √10 / 2 is in the required form. Therefore, a = 10 and b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, just to go through all steps again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. The function is y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). The distance squared from origin is x² + y², which becomes x² + (1/√2)^2*(x² -3)^2. Wait, no, actually, when I square y, it's [(1/√2)(x² -3)]^2, which is (1/2)(x² -3)^2, which is correct as I did before. So D² = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ -6x² +9). So that's x² + (x⁴ -6x² +9)/2. Let's compute this correctly.\n\nCompute (x⁴ -6x² +9)/2 + x². So, let me write it as (x⁴ -6x² +9)/2 + (2x²)/2 = (x⁴ -6x² +9 + 2x²)/2 = (x⁴ -4x² +9)/2. So yes, that's correct. So f(x) = (x⁴ -4x² +9)/2. Then f'(x) = (4x³ -8x)/2 = 2x³ -4"

At x=√2, f(x)= ( ( (√2)^4 ) -4*(√2)^2 +9 ) /2. Let's compute (√2)^4 is (2)^2 =4, (√2)^2 is 2. So 4 -4*2 +9 =4 -8 +9=5. So 5/2, so D=√(5/2)=√10/2≈1.581. So that is indeed smaller. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is √10 /2, so a=10, b=2, so a+b=12. Hmm, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using geometry or another calculus method, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the distance from a point to a parabola. Wait, the given equation is a parabola. Let me see. The standard form of a parabola is y = ax² + bx + c. In this case, it's y = (1/√2)x² - 3/√2. The distance from the origin to a point (x,y) on the parabola is sqrt(x² + y²). To minimize this, calculus is the straightforward way, which I did. Alternatively, maybe using parametric equations or Lagrange multipliers?\n\nLet me try Lagrange multipliers for fun. Let's see. We want to minimize f(x,y) = x² + y² (since minimizing D is equivalent to minimizing D²) subject to the constraint g(x,y) = y - (1/√2)(x² -3) =0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = x² + y² - λ(y - (1/√2)(x² -3)). Taking partial derivatives:\n\n∂L/∂x = 2x - λ*( -2x/√2 ) =0,\n\n∂L/∂y = 2y - λ =0,\n\n"

Let's compute the distance squared: 0 + ( -3/√2 )² = 9/2, so D=3/√2.\n\nAlternatively, if λ = -√2, then from ∂L/∂y: 2y = λ => 2y = -√2 => y = -√2 /2.\n\nNow, plugging y = -√2 /2 into the constraint equation:\n\n-√2 /2 = (1/√2)(x² -3).\n\nMultiply both sides by √2:\n\n- (√2 * √2)/2 = x² -3 ==> - (2)/2 = x² -3 ==> -1 = x² -3 ==> x² =2, so x=√2 or -√2.\n\nSo, points (√2, -√2/2) and (-√2, -√2/2). Now, compute the distance squared: x² + y² = (√2)^2 + ( -√2 / 2 )^2 = 2 + (2/4)=2 + 0.5=2.5=5/2, so D=√(5/2)=√10 /2.\n\nThus, same as before. So, the minimal distance is indeed √10 /2, so a=10, b=2, a+b=12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n"
