            "output": "Alright, so I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Hmm, okay. Let me think about the best way to approach this. I remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0) can be found using the distance formula, which is sqrt(x² + y²). Since I'm looking for the minimum distance, I probably need to minimize this distance function subject to the constraint given by the equation of the graph.\n\nLet me write down what I know. The distance D from the origin to a point (x, y) on the graph is:\n\nD = sqrt(x² + y²)\n\nBut since y is given in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula. So replacing y with (1/√2)(x² - 3), the distance becomes:\n\nD = sqrt(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me square both sides to make it easier because the square root can complicate things when taking derivatives. So, if I square D, I get:\n\nD² = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²\n\nLet me compute that squared term. Squaring (1/√2) gives 1/2, and then (x² - 3) squared is (x² - 3)². So, D² becomes:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nOkay, now I need to find the minimum value of D² because the square root function is monotonically increasing, so the x that minimizes D² will also minimize D.\n\nLet me expand (x² - 3)². That's x⁴ - 6x² + 9. So substituting back into D²:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9)\n\nLet me distribute the 1/2:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + (9/2)\n\nCombine like terms. The x² terms: x² - 3x² is -2x², so:\n\nD² ="

To find its minimum, I should take the derivative with respect to x and set it equal to zero.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nThe derivative f'(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 2*(1/2)x³ - 4x\n\nSimplify that:\n\nf'(x) = x³ - 4x\n\nSet derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\nx³ - 4x = 0\n\nFactor out an x:\n\nx(x² - 4) = 0\n\nSo the solutions are x = 0, x = 2, and x = -2.\n\nOkay, so I have three critical points. I need to evaluate f(x) at each of these points and determine which gives the minimum D².\n\nFirst, let's plug in x = 0:\n\nf(0) = (1/2)(0)^4 - 2*(0)^2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2\n\nThat's 4.5.\n\nNow, x = 2:\n\nf(2) = (1/2)(16) - 2*(4) + 9/2 = 8 - 8 + 4.5 = 0 + 4.5 = 4.5\n\nSimilarly, x = -2:\n\nf(-2) = same as x = 2 since all terms are even powers. So f(-2) = 4.5 as well.\n\nSo all three critical points give the same value of f(x). Interesting.\n\nBut are these minima or maxima? Let me check the second derivative to ensure these are minima.\n\nThe second derivative f''(x) can be found by differentiating f'(x) = x³ - 4x. So,\n\nf''(x) = 3x² - 4\n\nAt x = 0:\n\nf''(0) = 0 - 4 = -4, which is negative, so x = 0 is a local maximum.\n\nAt x = 2:\n\nf''(2) = 3*(4) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8"

But wait, that's not right because D² is 9/2, so D would be sqrt(9/2) = (3)/sqrt(2) = 3√2 / 2. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, hold on. Because if f(x) = D², so f(2) = 9/2, so D = sqrt(9/2) = 3/√2. To rationalize the denominator, it's 3√2 / 2. So that would be the minimal distance.\n\nHmm, but the problem states that the minimal distance can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, so 3√2 / 2 can be written as sqrt(18)/2, since sqrt(18) = 3√2. So sqrt(18)/2.\n\nBut 18 is divisible by 9, which is a square. So sqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2) = 3√2. So the expression is sqrt(18)/2.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"where a and b are positive integers such that a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one.\" So a needs to be square-free, right?\n\nBut 18 can be factored into 9*2, and 9 is a square. So sqrt(18) is not square-free. Therefore, my initial approach might have a mistake.\n\nWait, did I miscalculate f(x) at x = 2?\n\nWait let's go back. Let me recalculate f(2):\n\nf(2) = (1/2)(2)^4 - 2*(2)^2 + 9/2.\n\n2^4 is 16. So (1/2)*16 is 8.\n\n2^2 is 4. So -2*4 is -8.\n\nAdding 9/2: so 8 - 8 + 4.5 = 4.5.\n\nYes, that's correct. So f(2) is 9/2.\n\nSo D² is "

Hmm, maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, 3/sqrt(2) can be written as sqrt( (3)^2 / 2 ) = sqrt(9/2). But that's the same as before. Alternatively, rationalizing the denominator:\n\n3/sqrt(2) = (3√2)/2. So that's (sqrt(18))/2. Since 18 = 9*2, but 9 is a square. So the problem requires that a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. So 18 is divisible by 9, which is a square, so that's not acceptable. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check my steps again. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back to the original distance formula.\n\nThe distance squared is x² + y², where y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). So substituting:\n\nD² = x² + [ (1/√2)(x² - 3) ]²\n\nLet me compute that term again:\n\n[ (1/√2)(x² - 3) ]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)^2. So that's correct.\n\nThen expanding (x² - 3)^2 gives x^4 - 6x² + 9.

So it's D, not D squared.\n\nSo D is 3/√2, which can be written as sqrt(18)/2, because 3√2 is sqrt(9*2)=sqrt(18). So sqrt(18)/2 is the expression, but 18 is divisible by 9, which is a square. So that's not square-free.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because the question states that a should not be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one, so a must be square-free.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parametrize the point on the graph. Let's see, the graph is y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). So for any x, y is determined.\n\nSo the point is (x, (1/√2)(x² - 3)).\n\nSo the distance squared is x² + [ (1/√2)(x² - 3) ]².\n\nWhich is x² + (1/2)(x² -3)^2.

Wait, if I square 3/sqrt(2), I get 9/2. So if I express D as sqrt(a)/b, then:\n\nsqrt(a)/b = 3/sqrt(2). Let me square both sides:\n\na/b = 9/2.\n\nSo a and b must satisfy a/b = 9/2, and a should be square-free"
