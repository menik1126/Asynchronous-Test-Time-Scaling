Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating with all those factorials stacked on top of each other. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what a superfactorial is. From the definition given, n\\$ is a tower of factorials with n! on top, and each level down is another factorial. So, for 4\\$, it would be 4!^{{4!}^{{4!}^{{4!}}}}. That's four factorials stacked? Or is it five? Wait, no, the notation says n! on top, and each below is another factorial. So, 4\\$ would be 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. That makes a tower of four factorials, I think. Let me confirm: starting from the top, the first factorial is 4!, then the next level is 4! again, but raised to the power of the next level, and so on until the bottom. So, actually, it's a count of how many times the factorial is applied. Wait, no, the notation is a bit tricky. The superfactorial is defined with n! in exponents, so for 4\\$, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. So the tower has four levels: 4!, then 4!^{4!}, then 4!^{4!^{4!}}, and finally 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. Hmm, actually, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the notation is n\\ = n!^{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}}. So for 4\\$, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. So that's four factorials in the tower. Wait, actually, the top one is 4! and then each subsequent exponent is another 4! in the exponent, so the number of factorials is equal to n. So 4\\$ is 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}}. So, four factorials in the tower. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing, but I think"

The problem says: \"n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}_{n!}\". Oh! So the underbrace is indicating that the number of exponents is n! So for n\\$, the tower has n! number of terms. Therefore, for 4\\$, the tower is 4!^(4!^(4!^...^4!)) with a total number of 4! terms. So 4! is 24, right? So the tower has 24 exponents? Wait, that can't be. 24 exponents? That would make 4\\$ an astronomically huge number. The question's about the units digit, so maybe there's a pattern we can exploit here?\n\nOkay, so breaking this down, the problem is to find the units digit (i.e., the last digit) of 4\\$. Given that 4\\$ is a tower of factorials, so first, let me confirm the structure again. Since the underbrace says \"n\\$\" with n! number of n!'s in the exponent tower, so for 4\\$, it's a tower of 24 (since 4! =24) copies of 4!.\n\nSo 4\\$ = 4!^(4!^(4!^...^4!)) with 24 4!'s in total. That's a massive number, so calculating it directly is impossible. We must find a way to determine the units digit without computing the entire number.\n\nI remember that when dealing with units digits of exponents, Euler's theorem can be useful because it allows us to reduce the exponent modulo \u03c6(10), and then \u03c6(\u03c6(10)), etc., depending on the exponent tower. Because 10 factors into 2 and 5, the totient function \u03c6(10) is 4. So Euler's theorem says that for numbers coprime to 10, a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n. So, if we can express the exponent tower in terms modulo \u03c6(10)=4, then modulo \u03c6(\u03c6(10))=2"

So, 4\\$ \u2261 ? mod 10.\n\nSince 4\\$ is a tower of factorials, let me denote 4\\$ as F = 4!^{F'}, where F' is the next level in the exponent tower, which is 4!^{F''}, and so on, until we reach the top which is 4!.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can work from the top down, since each level depends on the levels below.\n\nSo, the topmost exponent is 4!. Then the next level is 4!^{previous level}, and so on. But since I'm trying to compute mod 10, perhaps I can compute each sub-expression mod \u03c6(10)=4, because of Euler's theorem.\n\nWait, but wait: if I have a tower like 4!^{4!^{...}} and I want to compute it mod 10. So, let me consider 4! mod 10 first.\n\n4! = 24, so 24 mod 10 is 4. So, 4! \u2261 4 mod 10. So, the topmost exponent is 4. Now, the next level is 4!^{previous level}, but we can reduce the exponent mod 4, because \u03c6(10)=4.\n\nWait, but 10 is 2\u00d75, so \u03c6(10)=10\u00d7(1-1/2)\u00d7(1-1/5)=4. So, for exponents, using Euler's theorem, a^k \u2261 a^{k mod \u03c6(10)} mod 10, when a and 10 are coprime. But 4 and 10 are not coprime, as both are divisible by 2. So, Euler's theorem doesn't apply here. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for patterns in the units digit of factorials. Let me think.\n\nLet's compute 4! mod 10: 24 mod 10 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, 4!^k mod 10. Let me compute 4!^k mod 10 for k=1,2,...\n\nWait, so 4! = 24 \u2261"

So, the tower is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24. But since we need the units digit, which is mod 10, let's see:\n\nLet me denote the tower as T = 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 terms. We need T mod 10.\n\nSince 24 mod 10 is 4, so T mod 10 is equivalent to 4^(24^(24^...^24)) mod 10. Wait, but the exponent here is the rest of the tower. Let me denote the exponent as E = 24^(24^...^24) with 23 terms. So, T = 24^E mod 10 = 4^E mod 10.\n\nTherefore, to compute 4^E mod 10, we can use Euler's theorem, but since 4 and 10 are not coprime, Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. Hmm, so maybe we can split into mod 2 and mod 5 and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that 4 mod 10 cycles every certain number.

So, E mod 2.\n\nBut 24 mod 2 is 0, so 24^anything mod 2 is 0, because 24 is even. So, any tower of 24's starting from the top, each level is 24, which is even. So, when you raise an even number to any positive integer, it's still even. Therefore, E is even because it's 24 raised to anything, which is even. Therefore, E is even.\n\nTherefore, 4^E mod10=6.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So, E is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 24s. So, the topmost exponent is 24, then each level is 24 raised to the level below.\n\nSince all the exponents are 24, which is even, so each exponent in the tower is even, so the exponent E would be 24^(something), which is even, but E's parity is even because any positive power of 24 is even. Wait, actually, no: 24 mod 2 is 0, so 24^k mod 2 is 0, which is even. Therefore, E is even.\n\nThus, E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod10=6, as per the cycle.\n\nWait, but hold on: Let me double-check.

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the tower more carefully. Let me try to see if there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nFirst, the problem is 4\\$, which is a tower of 24 copies of 24 (since 4! =24). So, the tower is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies. So, the total height is 24. So, the first exponent is 24, then the next is 24^24, then 24^(24^24), etc., up to 24 terms. But when we want to compute the units digit, we can reduce the base mod 10 first, so 24 mod10=4, so the entire tower becomes 4^(E) mod10, where E is the rest of the tower (24^(24^...^24) with 23 terms). So, to compute 4^E mod10, as before, since 4 has a cycle of 2 mod10, we need to know E mod2.\n\nE is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 terms. Since 24 is even, any exponentiation of 24 will be even, so E is even. Therefore, E mod2=0. Therefore, 4^E mod10=4^(0 mod2)=4^0 mod10? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the cycle is 2, so exponent mod2. Since E is even, exponent mod2 is 0, so 4^(even) mod10 is 6, because 4^2 mod10=6, and 4^(2k)= (4^2)^k mod10=6^k mod10. Wait, but 6^k"

So, since E is even, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in determining whether E is even or not. So, E is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 copies. Since each exponent in E is 24, which is even, then E is 24 raised to an even power, so E is even. Therefore, E mod2=0, so 4^E mod10=6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n\nWait, but wait a second.

But in this case, I think the approach is correct because once we figure out that the exponent E is even, the units digit is determined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using modulo 10 and see if I can compute it step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute 4\\$ mod10 by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, 4\\$ is 4!^(4!^(4!^...)) with 24 terms, so let me represent it as F = 24^F1, where F1 is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 terms.\n\nTo compute F mod10, I can compute 24 mod10, which is 4, so F mod10 = 4^{F1} mod10.
