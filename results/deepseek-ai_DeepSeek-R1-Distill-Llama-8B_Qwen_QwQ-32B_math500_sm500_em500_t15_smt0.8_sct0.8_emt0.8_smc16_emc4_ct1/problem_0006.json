            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. Let's see, the problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when it's divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know P(0) = 5, and we need to find P(5).\n\nHmm, right. So, let me recall some polynomial division concepts. If I divide a polynomial P(x) by a quadratic polynomial, say (x - a)(x - b), then the remainder R(x) will be a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) should look like ax + b. Since P(x) is a cubic, when divided by a quadratic, the quotient will be linear or quadratic? Wait, no, dividing a cubic by a quadratic gives a linear quotient and a linear remainder. So yes, R(x) is linear.\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), which would also be linear, so 2(ax + b) = 2a x + 2b.\n\nSo, let's denote R(x) as r1 x + r2. Then, the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4) is R(x) = r1 x + r2, and when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x) = 2r1 x + 2r2.\n\nNow, the Remainder Theorem tells us that the remainder of a polynomial P(x) when divided by (x - c) is P(c). But here, it's divided by a product of two linear factors, so I think the remainder can be found using the Chinese Remainder Theorem for polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to write P(x) in terms of these divisors. Let me try that.\n\nSo, P(x) can be written as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nSimilarly, since when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), we can also write:\n\nP(x"

Hmm, that might be more straightforward.\n\nSo, let me write down the equations based on the Remainder Theorem.\n\nFrom the first division: P(1) = R(1) and P(4) = R(4).\n\nFrom the second division: P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nSo, we have four equations:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n3. P(2) = 2R(2)\n4. P(3) = 2R(3)\n\nAlso, since R(x) is linear, R(x) = a x + b. So, we can express R(1), R(2), etc., in terms of a and b.\n\nThus, let's define R(x) = a x + b. Then, we can write the equations as:\n\n1. P(1) = a(1) + b\n2. P(4) = a(4) + b\n3. P(2) = 2(a(2) + b)\n4. P(3) = 2(a(3) + b)\n\nSo, equations 1 and 2 concern P at x=1 and x=4, equations 3 and 4 concern P at x=2 and x=3, each scaled by 2.\n\nGiven that P(x) is a monic cubic, so it has the form P(x) = x\u00b3 + c x\u00b2 +"
