            "output": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, I have a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means the leading coefficient is 1, right? So it looks like \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\). \n\nThe problem says when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), it leaves a remainder \\( R(x) \\). And when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we know \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall some polynomial division concepts. When a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by another polynomial, say \\( D(x) \\), it can be expressed as \\( P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x) \\), where the degree of \\( R(x) \\) is less than the degree of \\( D(x) \\).\n\nSo, for the first division, dividing by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which is a quadratic, the remainder \\( R(x) \\) must be linear, so let's say \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). Similarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), which is also quadratic, the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\), which would be \\( 2mx + 2n \\).\n\nSo, let's write those equations:\n\n1. \\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + mx + n \\)\n2. \\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2mx + 2n \\)\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( P(x) \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\( (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + mx + n = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2mx + 2n \\)\n\nThat's a bit complicated, but maybe we can evaluate \\( P(x) \\)"

            "output": " at specific points to get equations in terms of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nAlternatively, another approach I remember is using the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder when a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - a) \\) is \\( P(a) \\). But here, we're dealing with quadratic divisors, so maybe we can use a similar concept.\n\nWait, for dividing by a quadratic polynomial, the remainder will be linear, and the coefficients can be found using two points. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nWhen you divide \\( P(x) \\) by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). Therefore, by the Remainder Theorem, \\( R(1) = P(1) \\) and \\( R(4) = P(4) \\). Similarly, when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n \\), so \\( 2R(2) = P(2) \\) and \\( 2R(3) = P(3) \\).\n\nLet me write down these equations:\n\nFrom the first division:\n1. \\( P(1) = m(1) + n = m + n \\)\n2. \\( P(4) = m(4) + n = 4m + n \\)\n\nFrom the second division:\n3. \\( P(2) = 2m(2) + 2n = 4m + 2n \\)\n4. \\( P(3) = 2m(3) + 2n = 6m + 2n \\)\n\nSo now, we have four equations:\n\n1. \\( P(1) = m + n \\)\n2. \\( P(4) = 4m + n \\)\n3. \\( P(2) = 4m + 2n \\)\n4. \\( P(3) = 6m + 2n \\)\n\nAdditionally, we know \\( P(0) = 5 \\). Since \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, let's write it as \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\"
