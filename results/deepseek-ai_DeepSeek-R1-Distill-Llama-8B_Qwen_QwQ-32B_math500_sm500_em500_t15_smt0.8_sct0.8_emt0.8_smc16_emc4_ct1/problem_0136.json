From the definition given, the superfactorial n\\$ is a tower of factorials with n! at the top, n!-1 below that, and so on until 1!. For example, 4\\$ would be 4!^(4!^(3!^2!^1!)) or something like that. But since I'm only interested in the units digit, maybe I can break this down step by step without computing the entire massive number.\n\nFirst, I should remember that the units digit of a number is just its last digit. For factorials, I know that starting from 5! and higher, the units digit is always 0 because factorials include both 2 and 5 as factors, which multiply to give 10. So, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, and so on. Therefore, any factorial higher than 4! will have a units digit of 0. That's useful because it means I can potentially ignore any factorials beyond 4! when looking for the units digit of the superfactorial tower.\n\nSo, let's structure the problem. Since 4\\$ is a tower of factorials starting from 4 down to 1, I need to compute each level step by step, starting from the top and working my way down, but only considering the units digit at each step because higher digits don't affect the final units digit.\n\nLet me write out the structure of 4\\$:\n\n4\\$ = 4!^(4!^(3!^(2!^1!))).\n\nWait, no, actually, the correct structure should be 4!^(4!^(3!^(2!^1!))). Hmm, maybe it's better to write it as:\n\n1! is 1.\n2! is 2.\n3! is 6.\n4! is 24.\n5! is 120, and so on.\n\nBut since for the superfactorial, it's a tower where each level is the factorial of the number above. So, from 4\\$, it's 4!^(4!^(3!^(2!^1!))). So starting from the top, 2! is 2, 3! is 6, 4! is 24, and 4!^... So perhaps I can"

However, exponentiation modulo 10 can be tricky because the exponent can be very large. To handle this, Euler's theorem might be useful here. Euler's theorem states that if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n, where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. Since we're working mod 10, \u03c6(10) = 4. But since 10 factors into 2 and 5, \u03c6(10) = 10*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5) = 4. So Euler's theorem tells us that for numbers coprime to 10, their exponents can be reduced mod 4. However, if the base is not coprime to 10, like 24 (which is even), then Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. Hmm, so maybe I need to break it down further.\n\nAlternatively, since the units digit cycles in a pattern when raised to exponents. For example, 2 cycles every 4: 2,4,8,6,2,4,... Similarly, 6 raised to any power always ends with 6. 4 cycles every 2: 4,6,4,6,... 8 cycles every 4: 8,4,2,6,8,... 0 raised to any positive power is 0, but 0^0 is undefined. 5 raised to any power ends with 5. 1 is always 1. 3 cycles every 4, etc.\n\nSo perhaps I can compute the exponent tower modulo 4 or modulo 20 (since 10's totient is 4, but maybe 20 is better for modulus 10 with exponents). Wait, actually, when dealing with exponents mod 10, the exponent's modulus depends on the base. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the superfactorial 4\\$ is 24^(24^(6^(2^1))).

Upon a quick check in my mind, the superfactorial is sometimes defined as the product of factorials up to n, which is 1! * 2! * 3! * ... *n!. But in this case, the problem gives a different definition with a tower of factorials.\n\nWait, the problem defines it as a tower where each term is a factorial, with the number of levels equal to n!

Wait, 4^6 mod 10. Since 4^2=16 mod10=6, so 4^even exponent is 6. So 4^6 mod10=6. So T(4)=6 mod10.\n\nContinuing, T(5)=24^(T(4)) mod10=4^6 mod10=6. So once you get to T(2), all subsequent terms are 6 mod10. Therefore, regardless of how many levels beyond 2, the result is 6. Therefore, for a tower of 24 levels, the units digit is 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check with the problem's original definition again. The problem says \"the superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}\". So the underbrace is labeled n!, which is 24 for n=4, so the tower has 24 terms, each term is n! (i.e., 24). Therefore, the tower is 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 terms. So the calculation above applies, and the units digit is 6.\n\nHowever, in my initial interpretation, I thought the tower was 4!^(3!^(2!^1!)) which is 24^(6^(2^1)) =24^(6^2)=24^36. But that would be a tower of 4 terms (since n=4, the tower has 4 terms: 4!, 3!, 2!, 1!). But according to the problem's definition, it's n! terms, so 24 terms. So which is it?\n\nWait, the problem's wording"

The LaTeX code is:\n\nn\\$ = \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}_{n!}\n\nThis suggests that the tower has n! levels, each level being n!, so for n=4, 24 levels, each 24. So the tower is 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 exponents.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is the tower has n! levels, each being n!.\n\nTherefore, the calculation above applies, and the units digit is 6.\n\nBut wait, in my first approach, I thought it was 24^(24^(6^2)), which is 24^(24^36), but that was based on the alternative structure where the tower is built from n down to 1. However, according to the problem's LaTeX code, it's a tower of n! levels, each being n!. So I think the correct structure is the latter, so the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst, if it's 24^(24^(6^(2^1))), which is 24^(24^36), then:\n\nCompute 24^36 mod 10: since 24 mod10=4, so 4^36 mod10. Since 4^2=6 mod10, and 36 is even, so 4^36 mod10=6.\n\nThen, compute 24^(something ending with 6) mod10. The base is 24 mod10=4, exponent ending with 6, which is even. Therefore, 4^even mod10=6. So overall, 6.\n\nSo in this interpretation, the units digit is 6.\n\nAlternatively, if the tower is a 24-level tower of 24s, then as above, the units digit is 6.\n\nTherefore, in either case, the units digit is 6. So the answer is 6.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me do the calculation for a smaller n to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's take n=1. Then 1\\$ =1! =1.

But that's a huge number, but the units digit?\n\nAlternatively, if the tower is built from n down to 1, then 3\\$ would be 3!^(2!^1!)=6^(2^1)=6^2=36, units digit 6.\n\nHmm, so depending on the interpretation, the answer can vary. For n=3, if it's a tower of 6 terms of 6, then the units digit would be 6 as well, since similar reasoning applies. Let me see:\n\nTower of 6 terms: 6^6^6^6^6^6. Let's compute mod10.\n\nFirst, 6 mod10=6. The exponent is 6^6^6^6^6. Let's see:\n\nThe exponent of the first 6 is 6^6^6^6^6. Let me compute the exponent modulo \u03c6(10)=4, but since 6 and 10 are not coprime, maybe better to see the pattern.\n\n6^k mod10 is always 6, since 6*6=36 mod10=6, so any power of 6 ends with 6. Therefore, the exponent is 6 mod something, but actually, since the base is 6, the entire tower's units digit is 6. So yes, units digit is 6.\n\nAlternatively, if the tower is 3!^(2!^1!)=6^(2^1)=6^2=36, units digit 6. So in both interpretations, the units digit is 6. So for n=3, it's 6.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, if it's a tower of 2 terms (since 2! =2), so 2^2=4, which matches the first interpretation. If it's built from n down, it's 2!^1! =2^1=2, but that contradicts. Wait, no, for n=2, the problem's definition would be a tower of 2!"

Whereas if n=2, interpreting it as n down to 1, it's 2!^1! =2^1=2, which is different.

The superfactorial \\(n\\$$ is a tower of \\(n!\\) factorials, each level being \\(n!\\). For \\(n=4\\), this results in a tower of \\(24\\) levels, each consisting of \\(24\\). \n\nSince the base of each level is \\(24\\), which modulo \\(10\\) is \\(4\\), we need to compute the units digit of \\(4\\) raised to a tower of exponents. The key observation is that the units digit of \\(4\\)'s powers cycles every \\(2\\): \\(4, 6, 4, 6, \\ldots\\). This cycle depends solely on the parity (even or odd) of the exponent.\n\nThe exponent tower consists of \\(24\\) levels, all of which are even numbers (since \\(24\\) is even and any power of an even number remains even). Therefore, the exponent is even, leading to the units digit of \\(4^{\\text{even}}\\) being \\(6\\).\n\nThus, the units digit of \\(4\\$ is:\n\n\\boxed{6}"
