It looks complicated, but maybe there's a pattern or a trick to figure it out without computing the whole thing.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the definition. The superfactorial n$$ is like n! raised to the power of n!^(n!^...n!). There are n! number of n!s stacked on top of each other. For example, for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). That's a tower of exponents with 4! at each level, and there are 4! levels in total.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the units digit, maybe I can work modulo 10. The units digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10. So, if I can compute 4$$ mod 10, that should give me the units digit.\n\nTo compute 4$$ mod 10, which is (4!^(4!^(4!^4!))) mod 10, I can break this down using modular arithmetic properties. Remember that when calculating exponents modulo 10, Euler's theorem can be useful. Euler's theorem says that if two numbers are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n, where \u03c6(n) is Euler's totient function.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u03c6(10). Since 10 factors into 2 and 5, \u03c6(10) = 10*(1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/5) = 10*(1/2)*(4/5) = 4. So \u03c6(10) = 4. This means that for any number a coprime with 10, a^4 \u2261 1 mod 10.\n\nBut 4! is 24, and 24 is not coprime with 10 because they share a common factor of 2. So Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nMaybe I can compute the exponent modulo \u03c6(10), but only if the base is coprime with 10. Since 4! = 24 and 24 isn't coprime with 10, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nInstead, maybe I can look for patterns in powers of 24 modulo"

Let me think:\n\nActually, 24 \u2261 4 mod 10, so 24^k \u2261 4^k mod 10. Because (24)^k mod 10 = (4)^k mod 10. So maybe I can restate the problem as finding 4$$ mod 10 = (24^(24^(24^24))) mod 10 = 4^(24^(24^24)) mod 10. That seems better.\n\nSo now I need to compute 4^(24^(24^24)) mod 10.\n\nHmm, the base is now 4, which is not coprime with 10 (since it shares a factor of 2). But perhaps even so, there might be a pattern in the exponents. Let me think about powers of 4 mod 10:\n\n4^1 = 4 mod 10\n\n4^2 = 16 mod 10 \u2192 6\n\n4^3 = 4*6 = 24 \u2192 4 mod 10?\n\nWait, 4^3 is 64 mod 10 is 4. Then 4^4 would be 4^3 *4 \u2192 4*4 = 16 \u2192 6 mod 10 again.\n\nSo the pattern cycles every 2: 4, 6, 4, 6... so the cycle length is 2.\n\nSo, the units digit of 4^k is 4 if k is odd, and 6 if k is even.\n\nTherefore, if we can figure out whether the exponent 24^(24^24) is even or odd, we can know which one it is.\n\nSince 24^(anything) is even, because 24 is even, and any exponent greater than 0 would be even. The exponent here is 24^24, which is definitely even. Therefore, 24^(24^24) is an even exponent. Therefore, 4^(even) mod 10"

Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use Euler's theorem for modulus 5 and 2, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find mod 10.\n\nBut let's stick with mod 10 for now. Since 4 and 10 are not coprime, but maybe we can use the Carmichael function or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: let's compute 4^k mod 10. As mentioned, the cycle is length 2, so the exponent's parity determines the result. So, if the exponent is even, it's 6; if odd, 4.\n\nSo, since the exponent is 24^(24^24), which is clearly even, because 24 is even, so 24^anything is even.\n\nTherefore, 4^(even) mod 10 is 6.\n\nSo then, 4$$ mod 10 = 6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I haven't missed any layers.

So the innermost exponent is 4!^4! = 24^24.\n\nThen, the next level up is 4!^(24^24) = 24^(24^24).\n\nAnd the top level is 4!^(24^(24^24)) = 24^(24^(24^24)).\n\nBut wait, to compute 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)) is the same as 24^(24^(24^24)).\n\nWait, that's four layers?

Wait, the question says \"underbrace{ n!^{n!^{...}}}_{n!}\".\n\nWait, that notation might mean that the number of exponents is n!.\n\nWait, that's a key point. The problem says \"underbrace{ n!^{n!^{...}}}_{n!}\".\n\nSo the number of n! terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nWait, so for n=4, the number of terms in the tower is 4! =24. So the tower is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24. That's a tower of 24 24s. That's way more than I thought before. Oh no, that's a massive tower. So my previous analysis was wrong because I thought it was 3 layers, but actually it's 24 layers. That complicates things a lot.\n\nWait, so the problem says \"n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{...}}}_{n!}\".\n\nSo the underbrace is indicating that the number of n! terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nTherefore, for n=4, the superfactorial is a tower of 24 copies of 24. So 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 24s. That's a tower of height 24. So the exponent is a tower of 23 24s on top of the base 24.\n\nTherefore, my previous approach was incorrect because I thought it was only 3 layers.

Therefore, 24^k \u2261 4^k mod 10.\n\nSo, regardless of how high the exponents are, 24^k mod 10 is the same as 4^k mod 10.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding 4^(tower of 23 4s) mod 10.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Because the tower is 24^(24^(...^24)) with 24 levels, but 24 is congruent to 4 mod 10, so each exponent in the tower is 4 mod 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the tower above the base can be reduced mod \u03c6(10)=4, but again, since the base (24) is not coprime with 10, this might not apply.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that 4^k mod 10 has a cycle of 2: 4,6,4,6,... So if the exponent k is even, it's 6; if odd, 4.\n\nThus, if the exponent in 4^k is even, the result is 6; if odd, 4.\n\nSo, the problem now is to find whether the exponent in 4^(exponent) is even or odd.\n\nBut the exponent is a tower of 23 4s.\n\nWait, more precisely, the exponent is 24^(24^(...^24)) with 24 layers? Wait, no, the total number of layers is 24. So the expression is 24^(24^(...^24)) with 24 24s.\n\nBut since each 24 is congruent to 4 mod 10, perhaps we can look at the exponents mod something.\n\nWait, maybe instead of mod 10, we can consider the exponent tower's parity, as the cycle for 4^k depends only on whether k is even or odd.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the exponent in 4^k even or odd?\n\nBecause if the exponent is even, 4^k mod 10 is 6; if odd, 4.\n\nSo, the exponent E = 24^(24^(...^24)) with 24 layers.\n\nBut E ="
