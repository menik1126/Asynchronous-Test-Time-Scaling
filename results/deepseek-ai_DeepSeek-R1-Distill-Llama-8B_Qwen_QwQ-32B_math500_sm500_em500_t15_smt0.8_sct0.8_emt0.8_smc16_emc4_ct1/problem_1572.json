            "output": "First, I need to simplify the numerator of the expression inside the square root. The terms in the numerator are 5 divided by the square root of 80, the square root of 845 divided by 9, and the square root of 45.\n\nFor the first term, 5 over the square root of 80, I can simplify the denominator by factoring out perfect squares. The square root of 80 is the square root of 16 times 5, which simplifies to 4 times the square root of 5. This makes the first term 5 divided by 4 times the square root of 5.\n\nNext, for the second term, the square root of 845 divided by 9, I'll factor 845 to find perfect squares. The square root of 845 is the square root of 5 times 169, which is the square root of 5 times 13 squared. Simplifying, this becomes 13 times the square root of 5. Divided by 9, the term is 13 times the square root of 5 divided by 9.\n\nFor the third term, the square root of 45, I can factor out perfect squares. The square root of 45 is the square root of 9 times 5, which simplifies to 3 times the square root of 5.\n\nNow, I'll combine all the simplified terms in the numerator. That gives me 5 divided by 4 times the square root of 5 plus 13 times the square root of 5 divided by 9 plus 3 times the square root of 5.\n\nTo combine these terms, I'll factor out the common factor of the square root of 5. This leaves me with 5/4 + 13/9 + 3, all multiplied by the square root of 5.\n\nNext, I'll find a common denominator for the fractions 5/4, 13/9, and 3. The least common denominator is 36. Converting each fraction to have this denominator, I get 45/36, 52/36, and 108/36.\n\nAdding these fractions together, 45/36 plus 52/36 is 97/36, and adding 108/36 gives a total of 205/36. This means the numerator simplifies to 205/36 times the square root of 5.\n\nNow, the original expression inside the square root is"

The square roots of 5 in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, leaving just 205/36.\n\nTo simplify 205/36, I'll check if it can be reduced. The factors of 205 are 5 and 41, and the factors of 36 are 2, 3, and 6. Since there are no common factors, 205/36 is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is 205/36.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression, we start by examining the numerator inside the square root:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}}+\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9}+\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt{5}}}$$\n\n**Step 1: Simplify each term in the numerator**\n\n1. **First Term:**\n   $$\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}} = \\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{16 \\times 5}} = \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} = \\dfrac{5\\sqrt{5}}{20} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$$\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n   $$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5 \\times 169}}{9} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5} \\times 13}{9} = \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9}$$\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n   $$\\sqrt{45} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 5} = 3\\sqrt{5}$$\n\n**Step 2: Combine the simplified terms**\n\nAdding the simplified terms:\n$$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4} + \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\\sqrt{5}$$\n\nFactor out \\(\\sqrt{5}\\):\n$$\\sqrt{5} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\dfrac{13}{9} + 3 \\right)$$\n\n**Step 3: Find a common denominator for the fractions**\n\nThe least common denominator (LCD) of 4 and 9 is 36.
