            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: √[(5/√80 + √845/9 + √45)/√5]. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it step by step. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that inside the big square root, there's a numerator with three terms: 5/√80, √845/9, and √45. Then the denominator is √5. So maybe I can simplify each term in the numerator separately before dealing with the whole fraction.\n\nStarting with 5/√80. I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually preferred, so I should rationalize that. To do that, I can multiply numerator and denominator by √80. So that becomes (5√80)/(√80 * √80). Since √80 times √80 is 80, the denominator is 80, so it's 5√80/80. Then I can simplify √80. Let's see, 80 is 16*5, and √16 is 4, so √80 = 4√5. So substituting back, 5*4√5 is 20√5, divided by 80. So 20/80 reduces to 1/4. Therefore, 5/√80 simplifies to √5/4. Okay, that's the first term simplified.\n\nNext term is √845/9. Let me try to simplify √845. Hmm, 845. Wait, 845 divided by 5 is 169, right? Because 5*169=845. And 169 is 13², so √845 is √(5*169) which is √5 * √169, which is 13√5. So substituting back, √845 is 13√5, so the term becomes 13√5/9. So √845/9 is 13√5/9.\n\nThird term is √45. Let me simplify that. 45 is 9*5, so √45=√9*√5=3√5. So √45 simplifies to 3√5.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the numerator becomes: √5/4 + 13√5/9 + 3√5.\n\nSo now, I have to add these three terms together. They all have √5, so I can factor that out.

            "output": "'s see:\n\n√5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). I need to compute 1/4 + 13/9 + 3. Let me find a common denominator for these fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator is 36. So I'll convert each term to 36 denominator.\n\n1/4 is 9/36.\n\n13/9 is... 13*4=52, so 52/36.\n\n3 is 108/36.\n\nNow, adding them together: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169. So 169/36.\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to √5 * (169/36) which is (169√5)/36.\n\nNow the original expression has this numerator divided by √5. So:\n\n[(169√5)/36] / √5. Dividing by √5 is the same as multiplying by 1/√5. So:\n\n(169√5)/(36) * 1/√5. The √5 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving 169/36.\n\nWait, that's just 169 over 36. So is that the final answer? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, hold on. No, because the entire numerator was [169√5]/36, and then we divide by √5. So yes, that's correct. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nFirst term: 5/√80=5√80/80=5*4√5/80=20√5/80=√5/4. Correct.\n\nSecond term: √845=13√5, so 13√5/9. Correct.\n\nThird term: √45=3√5. Correct.\n\nAdding them: √5/4 +13√5/9 +3√5. Factor out √5: √5*(1/4 +13/9 +3). Find common denominator: 36. 1/4=9/36, 13/9=52/36, 3=108/36. Adding 9+52=61, 61+108=169. So √5*(169/36)=169√5/36.\n\nDivide by √5: 169√5/36 divided by √5 is 169/36. So 169/36 is the simplified fraction.\n\nIs 169"
