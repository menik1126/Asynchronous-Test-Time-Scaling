The goal is to write it in the form \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C}+\\sqrt{D})\\), where \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are positive integers, and then find the sum \\(A + B + C + D\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to rationalize a denominator with a square root, I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\). So, I'll multiply both the top and bottom by that.\n\nSo, let's write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2 - \\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the numerators and denominators:\n\nNumerator: \\((1 + \\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})\\)\nDenominator: \\((2 + \\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3})\\)\n\nLet me compute the denominator first because it's a difference of squares.\n\nDenominator: \\(2^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1\\). Oh, that's nice, the denominator becomes 1, which simplifies things.\n\nSo now, the expression simplifies to just the numerator:\n\n\\( (1 + \\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) \\)\n\nNow, I need to multiply out the numerator. Let me do that step by step.\n\nUsing the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\nFirst: \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\)\nOuter: \\(1 \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}\\)\nInner: \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times 2 = 2\\sqrt{2}\\)\nLast: \\(\\sqrt{2} \\times (-\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\\(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nNow, let's rearr"

Let me see if I can factor anything out or rearrange terms to match that.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n\\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\)\n\nI notice that the first two terms have a common factor of 2, and the next two terms have a common factor, but let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as \\(2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - ( \\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\). Hmm, does that work?\n\nYes! Because \\(2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) = 2 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\), and \\((\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\) is just the sum of those radicals.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\(2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\)\n\nComparing this to the desired form \\(A(1 + \\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D})\\), we can see that:\n\n- \\(A = 2\\)\n- \\(B = 2\\)\n- \\(C = 3\\)\n- \\(D = 6\\)\n\nNow, adding them up: \\(A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. I started by rationalizing the denominator, which is standard. Multiplying by the conjugate is the correct approach.\n2. Calculated the denominator: \\( (2 + \\sqrt{3})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) = 4 - 3 = 1 \\). That's correct.\n3. Then I multiplied the numerator: \\( (1 + \\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3}) \\).\n   - 1*2 = 2\n   - 1*(-√3) = -√3\n   - √2*2 = 2"
