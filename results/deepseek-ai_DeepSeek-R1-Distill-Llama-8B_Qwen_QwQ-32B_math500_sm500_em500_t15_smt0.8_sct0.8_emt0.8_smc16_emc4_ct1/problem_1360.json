Let \\( B \\) represent the number of boys and \\( G \\) represent the number of girls attending the math club meeting.\n\nNext, I know that the total number of students is 35. This gives me the equation:\n\\[ B + G = 35 \\]\n\nThe problem also states that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. So, \\( G \\) can be 13, 26, 39, and so on. However, since the total number of students is 35, \\( G \\) can't be 39 because that would exceed the total number.\n\nConsidering these possibilities:\n- If \\( G = 13 \\), then \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\).\n- If \\( G = 26 \\), then \\( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\).\n\nSince there are more girls than boys, \\( G \\) must be 26, which makes \\( B = 9 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( G \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n\n**Step 1: Set Up the Equation**\n\\[ B + G = 35 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Express \\( B \\) in Terms of \\( G \\)**\n\\[ B = 35 - G \\]\n\n**Step 3: Identify Possible Values for \\( G \\)**\nSince \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13 and must be less than 35:\n- Possible values for \\( G \\): 13, 26\n\n**Step 4: Determine Corresponding \\( B \\) Values**\n- If \\( G = 13 \\):\n  \\[ B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\]\n- If \\( G = 26 \\):\n  \\[ B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\]\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Condition \\( G > B \\)**\n- For \\( G = 13 \\), \\( B = 22 \\): \\( G \\) is not greater than \\( B \\).\n- For \\( G = 26 \\), \\( B = "
