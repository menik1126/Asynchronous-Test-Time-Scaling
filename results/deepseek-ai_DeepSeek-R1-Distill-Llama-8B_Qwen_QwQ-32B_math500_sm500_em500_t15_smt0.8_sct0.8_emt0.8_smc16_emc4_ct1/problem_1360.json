Let \\( G \\) represent the number of girls and \\( B \\) represent the number of boys.\n\nGiven that there are 35 students in total, I can write the equation \\( G + B = 35 \\).\n\nThe problem states that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. So, \\( G \\) can take values like 13, 26, etc. However, since there are more girls than boys, \\( G \\) must be greater than \\( B \\).\n\nNext, I'll substitute possible values of \\( G \\) into the equation to find a corresponding \\( B \\). \n\nIf \\( G = 13 \\), then \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\). But 13 is not greater than 22, which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nIf \\( G = 26 \\), then \\( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\). Here, 26 is greater than 9, which satisfies the condition.\n\nThere are no higher multiples of 13 below 35 that would result in a positive number of boys, so the only valid solution is \\( B = 9 \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls at the meeting\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys at the meeting\n\n**Given:**\n1. Total number of students = 35\n2. \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13.\n3. \\( G > B \\) (There are more girls than boys.)\n\n**Step 1:** Write the equation for the total number of students.\n\n\\[\nG + B = 35 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Since \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13, let's list the possible values of \\( G \\):\n\n\\[\nG = 13, 26, 39, \\dots\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the total number of students is 35, \\( G \\) cannot exceed 35. So, the possible values for \\( G \\) are 13 and 26.\n\n**Step 3:** Test each possible value of \\( G \\) to find \\( B \\) and check if \\( G > B \\).\n\n- **Case 1:** \\( G ="
