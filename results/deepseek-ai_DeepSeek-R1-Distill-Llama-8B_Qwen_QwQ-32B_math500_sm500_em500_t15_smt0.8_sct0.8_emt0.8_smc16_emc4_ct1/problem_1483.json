            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to simplify the expression √(³√(√(1/729))) and write the result with a rational denominator. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the expression to understand its structure. It's a square root of a cube root of another square root. That's three layers deep! So, starting from the innermost part, it's the square root of 1/729. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, the innermost part is √(1/729). Now, 729 is a number I recognize. Isn't that 9^3? Let me check: 9*9=81, 81*9=729. Yep, so 729 is 9³. Therefore, 1/729 is 1/(9³). So, √(1/729) is the square root of 1/729.\n\nI remember that the square root of 1/a is 1 over the square root of a. So, √(1/729) = 1 / √729. Now, what's √729? Well, 27^2 is 729 because 27*27 is 729. So, √729 is 27. So, substituting that back, √(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nOkay, so now the expression simplifies to the cube root of 1/27. So, moving one layer out, we have ³√(1/27). Since 27 is 3^3, 1/27 is 3^(-3). So, the cube root of 3^(-3) is 3^(-1), which is 1/3. So, ³√(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is the square root of that result. So, √(1/3). Again, square root of 1/a is 1 over the square root of a. So, that would be 1/√3. But the problem asks for a rational denominator. Right now, we have a square root in the denominator, which isn't rational. So, I need to rationalize the denominator.\n\nRationalizing the denominator means getting rid of the square root in the denominator. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by √"

            "output": "3. Let me write that out: (1 * √3) / (√3 * √3). In the denominator, √3 times √3 is 3. So, that simplifies to √3 / 3.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Starting from the inside: √(1/729) is 1/27. Then, ³√(1/27) is 1/3. Then, √(1/3) is √3 / 3 after rationalizing. That seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check each step. Maybe I made a mistake with exponents. Let me use exponent rules instead, which might make it clearer.\n\nStarting with √(1/729). That's (1/729)^½. 729 is 9³, so 1/729 is 9^(-3). So, (9^(-3))^½ is 9^(-3/2). Then, taking the cube root of that: (9^(-3/2))^(1/3) = 9^(-1/2). So, 9^(-1/2) is 1/(9^(1/2)) = 1/3, since √9 is 3. So that matches my earlier step.\n\nThen, taking the square root of 1/3: (1/3)^(1/2) = 1/(√3). Rationalizing, multiply numerator and denominator by √3: √3 / 3.\n\nHmm, yep, same result. So, that part checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of exponents with base 3, since 729 is 3^6, right? Let me see.\n\nWait, 3^6 is 729. Because 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729. So, 1/729 is 3^(-6).\n\nSo, √(1/729) is (3^(-6))^(1/2) = 3^(-3) = 1/27.\n\nThen, cube root of that is (1/27)^(1/3) = (3^(-3))^(1/3) = 3^(-1) = 1/3.\n\nThen, √("

So, regardless of the approach, I'm getting √3 / 3.\n\nWait, but let me try another way, perhaps using exponents all the way without simplifying at each step.\n\nOriginal expression: √(³√(√(1/729))). Let's write each root as exponent (1/p) where p is the root degree.\n\nSo, the innermost is √(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2). Then, the cube root of that is [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6). Then, the square root of that is [ (1/729)^(1/6) ]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nWait, that might be another way to write it, but 729 is 3^6, so let me express everything in terms of exponents with base 3.\n\nSo, 1/729 = 3^(-6). So, (1/729)^(1/12) = (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/(√3). Which again gives √3 /3 after rationalizing.\n\nHmm, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write all the exponents in a single expression.\n\nStarting with 1/729, which is 3^(-6). Then, taking the square root: 3^(-6*1/2) = 3^(-3). Then, cube root: 3^(-3*1/3) = 3^(-1). Then, square root again: 3^(-1*1/2) = 3^(-1/2). Which is 1/(√3), so √3/3.\n\nSame process, same result. Okay, so I think I'm confident that the simplified form with a rational denominator is √3 / 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't misread the original expression. It's √(³√(√(1/729))). So, the order is: square root first"

            "output": ", then cube root, then square root again? Wait, no, the order is from the inside out. The innermost is the square root of 1/729, then the cube root of that result, then the square root of the cube root's result. So, the order is correct as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write all the exponents as fractions:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nsqrt( cbrt( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nExpressed with exponents:\n\n( ( ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) )^(1/2) )\n\nWait, let me check the order. The innermost is sqrt(1/729) which is exponent 1/2. Then, the cube root is exponent 1/3, so that's ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3). Then, the outermost square root is exponent 1/2, so the entire expression is [ ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) ]^(1/2).\n\nMultiplying the exponents: 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/12. So, the total exponent is 1/12. Therefore, the expression is (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nSince 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is 3^(-6). Therefore, (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/√3 = √3/3. Yep, same result again.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap all steps once more to ensure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Start with the innermost radical: √(1/729). Since 729 is 27²? Wait, no, 27² is 729? Wait, 27 squared is 729? Wait, 27*27 is 729? Let me check that again. 27*20 is 540, 27*7 is 189, so "

            "output": "540 + 189 is 729. Yes, correct. So, √729 is 27, so √(1/729) is 1/27.\n\n2. Then, take the cube root of 1/27. Since 27 is 3³, 1/27 is 3^(-3), cube root is 3^(-1) which is 1/3.\n\n3. Then, take the square root of 1/3. Square root is 1 over √3, which is irrational. To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √3: (1*√3)/(√3*√3) = √3 / 3.\n\nSo, that's √3 over 3.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about all these exponents as fractions:\n\n- sqrt(x) is x^(1/2)\n\n- cube root(x) is x^(1/3)\n\nSo, the expression is sqrt(cube_root(sqrt(1/729))) = [ cube_root(sqrt(1/729)) ]^(1/2) = [ (sqrt(1/729))^(1/3) ]^(1/2) = ( (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) )^(1/2) = ( (1/729)^(1/6) )^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12). \n\nSince 729 = 3^6, 1/729 = 3^(-6). So, (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/√3 = √3 /3.\n\nI think at this point, I've confirmed this from multiple angles. I've used different methods: simplifying each radical step by step, expressing everything as exponents of 3, verifying the exponents add up correctly, and each time I arrive at √3 /3. \n\nI don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step seems logically consistent and mathematically sound. Therefore, I'm confident that the simplified expression with a rational denominator is √3 divided by 3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression, we start by addressing the innermost radical and work our way out. Each layer involves taking roots, which can be expressed as fractional exponents. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1."
