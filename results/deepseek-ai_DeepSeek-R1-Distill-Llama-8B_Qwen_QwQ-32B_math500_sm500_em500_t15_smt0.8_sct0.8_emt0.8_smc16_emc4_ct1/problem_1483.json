Knowing that 729 is 9^3, this becomes (1/9^3)^(1/2) = 1/(9^(3/2)).\n\nNext, I'll deal with the cube root of 1/9^(3/2). The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 1/9^(3/2) is 1/(9^(1/2)).\n\nNow, taking the square root of 1/(9^(1/2)) gives 1/(9^(1/4)). \n\nThus, the simplified form of the original expression with a rational denominator is 1 over the fourth root of 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's simplify the expression step by step:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{729}}}} \n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{729} = 27 \\quad \\text{(since } 27^2 = 729\\text{)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{729}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{27}} = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{3^3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{27}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt[4]{27}}}\n\\]"
