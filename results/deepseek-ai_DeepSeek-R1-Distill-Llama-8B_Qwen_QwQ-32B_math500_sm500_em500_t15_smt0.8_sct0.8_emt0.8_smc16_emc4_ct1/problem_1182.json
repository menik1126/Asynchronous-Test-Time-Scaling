The problem says that the solutions form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon expressed in a certain form and then compute \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I remember that solving quartic equations can be tricky, but maybe there's a trick here. The equation looks somewhat similar to a binomial expansion. Let me check: \\( (z + i)^4 \\) would expand to \\( z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2(i)^2 + 4z(i)^3 + (i)^4 \\). Calculating that, \\( (i)^2 = -1 \\), so it becomes \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi +1 \\). Wait, that's almost similar to the given equation, except the constant term here is +1, but in the problem, it's -i. So maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nHmm, let me write down the expansion again:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2(-1) + 4z(-i) + 1 \\)  \nSimplifying, that's \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi + 1 \\).\n\nBut our equation is \\( z^4 +4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). So, if I subtract i from both sides, I get:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\). Is that correct? Wait, let me check:\n\nIf I have \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\), then the right-hand side should match. Because in the given equation, it's \\( ... -i = 0 \\), so the equation can be rewritten as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\), then expanding \\( (z + i)^4 \\) gives me \\( z^4 +4z^3i -6z^2"

Exactly the equation given! So that works. Nice, so the equation is equivalent to \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).\n\nTherefore, the solutions are the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), shifted by \\( -i \\). So, if I let \\( w = z + i \\), then \\( w^4 = 1 + i \\). So, solving for \\( w \\), we can find the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), then subtract \\( i \\) from each to get the solutions \\( z \\).\n\nSo, first step: find the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\).\n\nTo find the fourth roots, it's easier to express \\( 1 + i \\) in polar form.

Let me compute that:\n\n\\( (\\sqrt{2})^{1/4} = (2^{1/2})^{1/4} = 2^{1/8} \\). Wait, hold on, actually, the magnitude of the roots is the magnitude of the original number raised to 1/4.

Hmm, wait, actually, with radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\). So, the square is inscribed in a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\). The area of such a square can be calculated.\n\nWait, first, let's recall that the area of a square inscribed in a circle of radius r is \\( 2r^2 \\).
