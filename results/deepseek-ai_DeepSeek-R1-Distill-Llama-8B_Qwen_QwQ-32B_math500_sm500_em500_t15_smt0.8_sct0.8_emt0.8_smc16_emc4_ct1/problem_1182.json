Then, express the area in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime, \\( p \\) is prime, and finally find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. First, I remember that complex solutions to polynomial equations correspond to points in the complex plane, so each root \\( z \\) is a point there. Since it's a fourth-degree equation, there should be four roots, which will form the four vertices of a convex quadrilateral.\n\nWait, the problem says a convex polygon, but with four points, it can be a quadrilateral. But maybe the roots are arranged in a specific way? Maybe it's symmetric or something?\n\nLooking at the equation, I notice the coefficients involve powers of \\( i \\). Let me write the equation again:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, the coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. That seems like a pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Maybe this is a modified binomial expansion? Let me think.\n\nWait, if I consider \\( (z + i)^4 \\), what do I get?

Because sometimes even if points are equally spaced on a circle, if the center is shifted, the polygon might not be regular? Wait, no, if the points are equally spaced on a circle, then the polygon is regular, regardless of the center's position. Because regularity is about the angles and side lengths, which depend only on the spacing on the circle. So shifting the center doesn't affect the regularity.\n\nTherefore, the polygon is a regular quadrilateral, i.e., a square, so the area is indeed \\( 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nWait, but let me think again.

Since \\( 2^{1/8} \\) is approximately 2^(0.125) ≈ 1.090507732677173.\n\nLet me note that:\n\n\\( 2^{1/8} \\approx 1.0905 \\)\n\nNow, compute the angles:\n\nFor k=0: θ₀ = π/16 ≈ 0.19635 radians (about 11.25 degrees)\n\nθ₁ = 9π/16 ≈"
