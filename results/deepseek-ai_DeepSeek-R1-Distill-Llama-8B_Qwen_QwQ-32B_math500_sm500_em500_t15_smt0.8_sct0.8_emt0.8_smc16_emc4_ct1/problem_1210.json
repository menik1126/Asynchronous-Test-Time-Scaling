The direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions that the line is parameterized, and there's an Asymptote figure provided. Since I can't see the figure, I'll have to rely on the code. The Asymptote code sets up a coordinate system, draws some gray lines for the grid, and then defines points A, B, L, and R. \n\nLet me parse the Asymptote code:\n\n- It sets up a grid from -8 to 8 on both the x and y axes.\n- Points A and B are defined as A = (-5, 4) and B = (-1, 3).\n- Points L and R are the intersections of lines AB with the vertical lines x = -8 and x = 8, respectively.\n- The red line is drawn from L to R.\n\nSo, the line AB is parameterized such that when extended, it intersects the vertical lines x = -8 and x = 8 at points L and R, respectively. The direction vector of this line is given, and I need to find \\( b \\) in it.\n\nWait, the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, direction vectors are usually based on the slope of the line. The components of the direction vector correspond to the change in x and y, so if the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), that would mean for every 1 unit increase in x, y decreases by 7, or something like that. Wait, no, direction vectors can be scaled, but the actual slope is rise over run, so from the vector, the slope would be \\( b / (-7) \\) or \\( -b/7 \\).\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find the slope of the line AB, and that should match the slope derived from the direction vector.\n\nSo, let's compute the slope of line AB. Points A and B are given as A = (-5, 4) and B = (-1, 3). \n\nSlope \\( m"

Since the red line is the same line AB extended, its slope must be -1/4. So the direction vector should have a slope of \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\), which must equal -1/4. \n\nWait, direction vector components: the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta x \\\\ \\Delta y \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, the slope is \\( \\Delta y / \\Delta x \\), which is \\( b / (-7) \\). \n\nSetting that equal to the slope calculated from points A and B: \n\n\\( \\frac{b}{-7} = -1/4 \\).\n\nSolving for \\( b \\):\n\nMultiply both sides by -7:\n\n\\( b = (-1/4)*(-7) = 7/4 \\).\n\nSo, is that right? Let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, slope between points A and B is (3 - 4)/( -1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4. That part seems correct.\n\nThe direction vector given is ( -7, b ). The slope is (b)/(-7). So setting slope equal to -1/4:\n\n\\( (b)/(-7) = -1/4 \\)\n\nCross-multiplying: \\( b * 4 = (-7)*(-1) \\)\n\nSo 4b = 7 → b = 7/4. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the direction vector directly from points A and B.\n\nThe direction vector from A to B is B - A: \n\nΔx = (-1) - (-5) = 4\n\nΔy = 3 - 4 = -1\n\nSo, direction vector is (4, -1). \n\nAlternatively, but they want the direction vector to be (-7, b). \n\nDirection vectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar. So (4, -1) can be scaled by a factor to get the direction vector ( -7, b ). \n\nLet me see: Let’s suppose"

If we simplify this by dividing by 4, we get (4, -1), which matches the direction vector from A to B (since A to B was (4, -1)). \n\nAlternatively, if we want a direction vector with x-component -7, then we can scale this direction vector (4, -1) by a factor that makes the x-component -7. \n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose we have direction vector (4, -1). Let’s find a scalar k such that 4k = -7. Then k = -7/4. \n\nThen the scaled direction vector would be (4*(-7/4), -1*(-7/4)) = (-7, 7/4). \n\nSo that gives the direction vector as (-7, 7/4), so b is 7/4. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 7/4. \n\nAlternatively, if I use the coordinates of points L and R, the direction vector from L to R is (16, -4). The direction vector given in the problem is (-7, b). Since direction vectors can be scaled, they must be scalar multiples of each other. \n\nSo, there exists a scalar k such that:\n\n16 * k = -7\n\nand \n\n-4 * k = b\n\nSolving for k from the first equation: k = -7/16\n\nThen substituting into the second equation: b = -4*(-7/16) = 28/16 = 7/4. \n\nSame result. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the value of b is 7/4. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nThe problem gives a direction vector of the form (-7, b). The line in question is the line through points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3). The direction vector between A and B is (4, -1). To get a direction vector with an x-component of -7, we scale the original direction vector by -7/4,"

Thus, b is 7/4. \n\nAlternatively, by finding points L and R where the line intersects x = -8 and x = 8, we calculate the direction vector from L to R as (16, -4), scale it down to (4, -1), then scale again by -7/4 to get (-7, 7/4), giving b as 7/4.\n\nSo, another way to think about it is that the line has a certain slope, and direction vectors must reflect that slope correctly in their components. Since the direction vector given leads to a slope of -b/7, and the slope of the line is -1/4, solving -b/7 = -1/4 gives b = 7/4.\n\nYes, that all checks out. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( b \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( b \\) in the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) of the line parameterized by points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we start by calculating the slope of the line through points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nPoints \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are given as \\( A = (-5, 4) \\) and \\( B = (-1, 3) \\).\n\nThe slope \\( m \\) of line \\( AB \\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} = \\frac{-1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThe direction vector given is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), which corresponds to a slope of \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\).
