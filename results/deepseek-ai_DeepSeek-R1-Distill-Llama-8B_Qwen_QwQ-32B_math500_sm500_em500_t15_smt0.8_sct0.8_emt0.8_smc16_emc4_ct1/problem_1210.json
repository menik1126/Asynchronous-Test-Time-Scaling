The line is parameterized, but there's also an Asymptote figure provided. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, the Asymptote code draws a coordinate system with x and y axes. Points A and B are given as (-5,4) and (-1,3), respectively. Then, points L and R are found using the extension function with lines from A to B and horizontal lines at y=0 and y=1. The red line connecting L and R is the line we're interested in.\n\nWait, the direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). That means for every increase of 1 in the x-component, the y-component increases by \\( b \\). So, the slope of the line should be \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\).\n\nBut how do I find the slope of the line from the given points A and B? Let me calculate the slope using points A and B.\n\nPoint A: (-5, 4)\nPoint B: (-1, 3)\n\nSlope \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} = \\frac{-1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\).\n\nWait, but the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), so the slope should be \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\). Therefore, \\( \\frac{b}{-7} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\). Let me solve for \\( b \\).\n\n\\( \\frac{b}{-7} = -\\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -7:\n\n\\( b = (-7) \\times -\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{7}{4} \\)\n\nSo, \\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should consider the direction vector's relationship with the line's slope.\n\nThe direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta x \\\\ \\Delta y \\end{pmatrix}"

And the slope between points A and B is indeed calculated as (3 - 4)/( -1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4.\n\nTherefore, setting them equal:\n\n\\( \\frac{b}{-7} = -1/4 \\)\n\nSolving for b:\n\nMultiply both sides by -7:\n\n\\( b = (-7)(-1/4) = 7/4\n\nHmm, but 7/4 is 1.75. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the line drawn is actually from points L and R, not A and B? Wait, the red line is between L and R, which are intersections of line AB with the vertical lines at x=-8 and x=8? Wait, looking back at the Asymptote code.\n\nThe extension(A, B, (-8,0), (-8,1)) would find the intersection point of line AB with the vertical line at x=-8. Because (-8,0) and (-8,1) are points on that vertical line. Similarly, extension(A,B, (8,0), (8,1)) finds the intersection with the vertical line at x=8.\n\nTherefore, the red line is the line AB extended to the edges of the coordinate system (which goes from x=-8 to 8). Wait a second, but the line AB itself is already part of the red line? Because the problem refers to \"the following line\" being parameterized with direction vector (-7, b). So maybe the direction vector of line AB is the one we need?\n\nWait, since points L and R are just the intersections with the left and right sides, the red line is the same as line AB. Therefore, the direction vector is the direction vector between points A and B.\n\nLet me confirm the direction vector between A and B. From point A to point B:\n\n\u0394x = -1 - (-5) = 4\n\u0394y = 3 - 4 = -1\n\nTherefore, direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix}4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nSo the direction"

So maybe the direction vector is scaled?\n\nWait, if the direction vector is scaled by a factor, 4 and -1 can be scaled to get -7 and b.\n\nLet me set up the proportion:\n\n4 * k = -7\n\n-1 * k = b\n\nSo, solving for k:\n\nk = -7 / 4\n\nThen, \\( b = (-1) * (-7/4) = 7/4 \\).\n\nSo, yes, that confirms \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nAlternatively, the direction vector is (\u0394x, \u0394y) = (4, -1). But the given direction vector is (-7, b). So, perhaps they are scalar multiples.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf (4, -1) = k*(-7, b)\n\nThen:\n\n4 = -7k\n\n-1 = b*k\n\nFrom 4 = -7k, so k = -4/7\n\nThen, substituting into the second equation:\n\n-1 = b*(-4/7)\n\nSo, \\( b = (-1)/(-4/7) = (7/4) \\)\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction vector is just the vector from L to R, but since L and R are the intersections, the line LR is the same as line AB. So, the direction vector is same as AB, which is (4, -1), but scaled.\n\nWait, the problem says the direction vector is of the form (-7, b). So, whether direction vector is AB or BA, but AB is (4, -1). So if we take the direction vector as AB, which is (4, -1), and it's given as (-7, b). So, it's scaled by a factor of -7/4.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector is scaled by -7/4, so b would be 7/4.\n\nAlternatively, if the original vector was (\u0394x, \u0394y) = (-7, b), and line AB has \u0394x = 4, \u0394y = -1, then the line AB direction vector is (4, -1), so the given direction vector is a scalar multiple.\n\nSo, 4 = -7k and -1 = b k.\n\n"

So, boxed, that would be \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4}}.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in direction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction vector is from L to R. Let me compute coordinates of L and R.\n\nGiven points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3). The line AB can be parametrized as A + t*(B - A). The direction vector is (4, -1). So parametric equations:\n\nx = -5 + 4t\n\ny = 4 - t\n\nWe need to find where this line intersects the left vertical line at x = -8 (point L) and the right vertical line at x =8 (point R).\n\nFirst, find L: x = -8.\n\nSet x = -5 +4t = -8 \u2192 4t = -3 \u2192 t = -3/4\n\nThen, y-coordinate at L is y = 4 - (-3/4)*1 = 4 + 3/4 = 19/4. Wait, 4 - t? Wait, the parametric equation for y is 4 - t, so when t = -3/4, y = 4 - (-3/4) = 4 + 3/4 = 19/4. So point L is (-8, 19/4).\n\nSimilarly, point R is at x =8.\n\nSet x = -5 +4t =8 \u2192 4t =13 \u2192 t =13/4\n\nThen, y-coordinate is y =4 - (13/4) = (16/4 -13/4)= 3/4. So point R is (8, 3/4).\n\nTherefore, the direction vector from L to R is (8 - (-8), 3/4 -19/4) = (16, -16/4) = (16, -4). Wait, let me compute that again.\n\nCoordinates of L: (-8, 19/4)\n\nCoordinates of R:"
