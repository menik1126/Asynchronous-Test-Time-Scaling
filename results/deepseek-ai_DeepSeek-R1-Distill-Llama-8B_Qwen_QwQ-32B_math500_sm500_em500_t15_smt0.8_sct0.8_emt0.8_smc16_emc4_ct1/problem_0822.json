            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. First, since ω³ = 1, that means ω is a cube root of unity. I remember that cube roots of unity are solutions to the equation x³ = 1. So, there are three cube roots of unity: 1, and two complex numbers.\n\nLet me write that down. The cube roots of unity satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\omega^3 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the roots are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. Now, these roots have a special property: 1 + ω + ω² = 0. I think that's right. Let me check that.\n\nIf ω³ = 1, then ω³ - 1 = 0, which factors into (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. Since ω ≠ 1, we have ω² + ω + 1 = 0. Yep, that's correct. So, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That's a key equation I can use.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nLet me denote this expression as S:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nI need to find the possible values of S. Since ω can be either of the two non-real cube roots of unity, ω and ω² are distinct, but they are complex conjugates of each other. So, maybe S will have the same value regardless of whether ω is one root or the other. Let me check.\n\nFirst, let me try to compute S. Maybe I can find a common denominator or manipulate the expression.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 / (1 + ω)\n\nSecond term: 1 / (1 + ω²)\n\nLet me compute the sum:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega"

So, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega) = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nDenominator is:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\n\\]\n\nSo, S is equal to:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nI already know from the key equation that 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so I can substitute that here. Let me see:\n\nNumerator: 2 + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (-1) = 1, since ω + ω² = -1.\n\nDenominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, expand (1 + ω)(1 + ω²):\n\n= 1 * 1 + 1 * ω² + ω * 1 + ω * ω²\n\n= 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so this becomes:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nAgain, using ω + ω² = -1:\n\n= 2 + (-1) = 1\n\nSo, the denominator is 1.\n\nWait, numerator is 1 and denominator is 1, so S = 1 / 1 = 1?\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.\n\nWait, let me recast this:\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³ = 1 + (ω + ω²) + 1 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.\n\nSo"

That seems to be the case.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Wait, hold on. When I expand (1 + ω)(1 + ω²), I get 1 + ω + ω² + ω³, but ω³ = 1, so that's 1 + ω + ω² + 1. But 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so 0 + 1 = 1. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the denominator is 1, the numerator is 1, so S = 1.\n\nWait, but I thought S might have two different values because ω and ω² are complex conjugates, but maybe their reciprocals sum up to 1 in both cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute S for each ω and see.\n\nLet me try to compute S for ω and for ω².\n\nFirst, consider ω ≠ 1, so ω is a primitive cube root of unity. The minimal polynomial for ω is ω² + ω + 1 = 0, as we have.\n\nSo, 1 + ω = -ω² and 1 + ω² = -ω.\n\nSo, let's compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(-ω²) + 1/(-ω) = -1/ω² -1/ω = - (1/ω + 1/ω²)\n\nBut what is 1/ω? Since ω³ = 1, so 1/ω = ω², because ω * ω² = ω³ = 1. Similarly, 1/ω² = ω.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n- (ω² + ω) = - (ω + ω²) = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute using complex numbers.\n\nLet me write ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = (-1/2) + i (√3/2)\n\nSimilarly, ω² = e^(4πi/3) = cos(4π/3) + i sin(4π/3) ="

Let's write this as:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n(1/2 - i√3/2) / [(1/2 + i√3/2)(1/2 - i√3/2)] = (1/2 - i√3/2) / [ (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) ]\n\nDenominator: 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, reciprocal is (1/2 - i√3/2).\n\nSimilarly, reciprocal of (1/2 - i√3/2) is (1/2 + i√3/2).\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/(1 + ω) = (1/2 - i√3/2)\n\n1/(1 + ω²) = (1/2 + i√3/2)\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, that's the same result. So, indeed, the sum is 1.\n\nAlternatively, if I had chosen ω² as the root, since the problem says \"all possible values\", but since both roots give the same value, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values\". Since ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1, so ω can be 1, ω, or ω². But if ω is 1, then the denominators become 1 + 1 = 2, so"

Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is (whether 1, ω, or ω²), the expression equals 1.\n\nWait a second, but I thought ω is such that ω³ = 1, so ω can be any of the three cube roots. But when we take ω = 1, the problem is to compute 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1), which is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nBut in the problem statement, are we to consider ω as any cube root of unity, including 1, or only the non-real ones? Wait, let me check the problem again.\n\nIt says, \"Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1.\" So, ω can be any cube root of unity, which includes 1, ω, and ω². So, all three possibilities.\n\nWait, but in that case, when ω is 1, 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) is 1, but when ω is ω or ω², it's also 1. So, regardless, the value is always 1.\n\nWait, but in my previous step-by-step, I considered both ω and ω², and ω = 1, but in the initial step, I thought maybe the expression could be 1 regardless of the root chosen.
