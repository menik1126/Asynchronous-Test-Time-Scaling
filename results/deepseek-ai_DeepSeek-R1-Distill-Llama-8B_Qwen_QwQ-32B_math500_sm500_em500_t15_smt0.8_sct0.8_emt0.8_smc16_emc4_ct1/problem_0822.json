I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, okay, let me start by recalling what I know about roots of unity. \n\nSo, ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, and two complex numbers. I think they are usually denoted as ω, ω², and 1. Wait, actually, isn't ω typically the primitive cube root of unity, so the three roots are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1. \n\nSince ω³ = 1, we can express ω in exponential form. The cube roots of unity can be represented as e^(2πi/3) and e^(4πi/3). Alternatively, they can be written using cosine and sine: cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) and cos(4π/3) + i sin(4π/3). Maybe that form will help later, but let's see.\n\nI remember that for roots of unity, some properties hold. For instance, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That's a key identity. So, that tells me that ω² = -1 - ω. Similarly, ω³ = 1, so raising ω to higher powers cycles through 1, ω, ω², and then back to 1.\n\nOkay, so I need to compute \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Maybe if I can express both denominators in terms of each other or find a common denominator, that would help. Let me try to manipulate the expression.\n\nFirst, let me denote the expression as S:\n\nS = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nTo add these two fractions, I'll need a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So, let me compute that:\n\nS = \\(\\frac{1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega^2) + 1 \\cdot (1 +"

Wait, but from the identity 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, substituting that into the numerator:\n\n2 + (-1) = 1. So the numerator simplifies to 1.\n\nNow, the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω².\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1*1 = 1,\n\n1*ω² = ω²,\n\nω*1 = ω,\n\nω*ω² = ω³. But ω³ = 1, so that term is 1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = (1 + 1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (ω + ω²). Again, using ω + ω² = -1, so substituting:\n\n2 + (-1) = 1. \n\nSo the denominator is also 1. \n\nTherefore, S = numerator / denominator = 1 / 1 = 1. \n\nWait, so does that mean the expression is always equal to 1? But the question says \"find all possible values\". Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here because the problem states \"all possible values\", implying there might be more than one. Let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, let's verify the numerator:\n\nStarting with S = [1/(1+ω)] + [1/(1+ω²)].\n\nCommon denominator is (1+ω)(1+ω²). \n\nNumerator: (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω². Since 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, 2"

            "output": " - 1 = 1. Numerator is 1.\n\nDenominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. As ω³ = 1, so 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω². Which again is 2 -1 =1.\n\nThus, S = 1/1 =1.\n\nWait, so regardless of which non-real cube root we take (ω or ω²), the expression S is always 1. So the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut hold on, let me test this with actual complex numbers to make sure.\n\nLet me choose ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i (√3)/2.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω): 1 divided by (1 -1/2 + i √3/2) = 1/(1/2 + i √3/2).\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by 2: 2/(1 + i √3).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i √3):\n\n2*(1 - i √3) / [(1 + i √3)(1 - i √3)] = 2*(1 - i √3)/(1 + 3) = 2*(1 - i √3)/4 = (1 - i √3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute 1/(1 + ω²).

Let me do the same for ω² = e^(4πi/3):\n\n1/(1 + ω²) was previously (1 + i √3)/2, and 1/(1 + ω) was (1 - i √3)/2. So adding them gives the same result:1.\n\nWait, but maybe let me compute 1/(1 + ω²) when ω² is -1/2 - i√3/2:\n\n1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1 -1/2 -i√3/2) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2), which is the same as above, giving (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω) for ω = e^(4πi/3):\n\nWait, hold on, is that correct? If ω is e^(4πi/3), which is -1/2 -i√3/2, then 1 + ω = 1 -1/2 -i√3/2 = 1/2 -i√3/2, so 1/(1 + ω) is (1 + i√3)/2. Wait, that's the same as 1/(1 + ω²) when ω was e^(2πi/3). So, regardless of whether ω is e^(2πi/3) or e^(4πi/3), the sum S is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the expression S always equals 1, regardless of which primitive cube root of unity we choose.\n\nHence, the only possible value is 1.
