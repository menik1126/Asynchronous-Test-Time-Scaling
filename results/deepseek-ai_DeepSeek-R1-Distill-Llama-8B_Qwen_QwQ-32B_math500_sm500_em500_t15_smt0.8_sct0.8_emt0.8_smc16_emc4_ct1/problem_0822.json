            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where \u03c9 is a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step. First, since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, that means \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. I remember that cube roots of unity are solutions to the equation x\u00b3 = 1. So, there are three cube roots of unity: 1, and two complex numbers.\n\nLet me write that down. The cube roots of unity satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\omega^3 = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the roots are 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1. Now, these roots have a special property: 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. I think that's right. Let me check that.\n\nIf \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, then \u03c9\u00b3 - 1 = 0, which factors into (\u03c9 - 1)(\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1) = 0. Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, we have \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0. Yep, that's correct. So, 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. That's a key equation I can use.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nLet me denote this expression as S:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nI need to find the possible values of S. Since \u03c9 can be either of the two non-real cube roots of unity, \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2 are distinct, but they are complex conjugates of each other. So, maybe S will have the same value regardless of whether \u03c9 is one root or the other. Let me check.\n\nFirst, let me try to compute S. Maybe I can find a common denominator or manipulate the expression.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 1 / (1 + \u03c9)\n\nSecond term: 1 / (1 + \u03c9\u00b2)\n\nLet me compute the sum:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega"

So, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega) = 2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\n\\]\n\nDenominator is:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)\n\\]\n\nSo, S is equal to:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{2 + \\omega + \\omega^2}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\n\\]\n\nI already know from the key equation that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so I can substitute that here. Let me see:\n\nNumerator: 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 2 + (-1) = 1, since \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1.\n\nDenominator: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, expand (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2):\n\n= 1 * 1 + 1 * \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 * 1 + \u03c9 * \u03c9\u00b2\n\n= 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3\n\nBut \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so this becomes:\n\n1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2\n\nAgain, using \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1:\n\n= 2 + (-1) = 1\n\nSo, the denominator is 1.\n\nWait, numerator is 1 and denominator is 1, so S = 1 / 1 = 1?\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.\n\nWait, let me recast this:\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3 = 1 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.\n\nSo"

            "output": ", yes, denominator is 1, numerator is 1, so S = 1.\n\nHmm, so regardless of whether \u03c9 is one root or the other, the sum S is always 1. That seems to be the case.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Wait, hold on. When I expand (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2), I get 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3, but \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so that's 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1. But 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so 0 + 1 = 1. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the denominator is 1, the numerator is 1, so S = 1.\n\nWait, but I thought S might have two different values because \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2 are complex conjugates, but maybe their reciprocals sum up to 1 in both cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute S for each \u03c9 and see.\n\nLet me try to compute S for \u03c9 and for \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nFirst, consider \u03c9 \u2260 1, so \u03c9 is a primitive cube root of unity. The minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0, as we have.\n\nSo, 1 + \u03c9 = -\u03c9\u00b2 and 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -\u03c9.\n\nSo, let's compute 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1/(-\u03c9\u00b2) + 1/(-\u03c9) = -1/\u03c9\u00b2 -1/\u03c9 = - (1/\u03c9 + 1/\u03c9\u00b2)\n\nBut what is 1/\u03c9? Since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so 1/\u03c9 = \u03c9\u00b2, because \u03c9 * \u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. Similarly, 1/\u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9.\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n- (\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9) = - (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) = -(-1) = 1.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute using complex numbers.\n\nLet me write \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) = cos(2\u03c0/3) + i sin(2\u03c0/3) = (-1/2) + i (\u221a3/2)\n\nSimilarly, \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = cos(4\u03c0/3) + i sin(4\u03c0/3) ="

Let's write this as:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:\n\n(1/2 - i\u221a3/2) / [(1/2 + i\u221a3/2)(1/2 - i\u221a3/2)] = (1/2 - i\u221a3/2) / [ (1/2)^2 + (\u221a3/2)^2 ) ]\n\nDenominator: 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, reciprocal is (1/2 - i\u221a3/2).\n\nSimilarly, reciprocal of (1/2 - i\u221a3/2) is (1/2 + i\u221a3/2).\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/(1 + \u03c9) = (1/2 - i\u221a3/2)\n\n1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = (1/2 + i\u221a3/2)\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(1/2 - i\u221a3/2) + (1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i\u221a3/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, that's the same result. So, indeed, the sum is 1.\n\nAlternatively, if I had chosen \u03c9\u00b2 as the root, since the problem says \"all possible values\", but since both roots give the same value, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values\". Since \u03c9 is a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so \u03c9 can be 1, \u03c9, or \u03c9\u00b2. But if \u03c9 is 1, then the denominators become 1 + 1 = 2, so"

Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity \u03c9 is (whether 1, \u03c9, or \u03c9\u00b2), the expression equals 1.\n\nWait a second, but I thought \u03c9 is such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so \u03c9 can be any of the three cube roots. But when we take \u03c9 = 1, the problem is to compute 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1), which is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.\n\nBut in the problem statement, are we to consider \u03c9 as any cube root of unity, including 1, or only the non-real ones?
