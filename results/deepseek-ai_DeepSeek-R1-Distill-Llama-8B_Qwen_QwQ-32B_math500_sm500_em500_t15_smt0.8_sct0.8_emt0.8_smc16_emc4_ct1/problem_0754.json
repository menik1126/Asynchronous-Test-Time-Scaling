            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. The sequence is a1, a2, a3, and so on. The problem states that for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Also, we know that a13 is 2016, and we need to find a1.\n\nHmm, let me try to parse this step by step. First, let me restate the problem in my own words. We have a sequence where every odd-indexed trio forms a geometric sequence and every even-indexed trio forms an arithmetic sequence. And the 13th term is 2016; we need to find the first term.\n\nSo, to break it down, for any k, the three terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} form a geometric progression. That means each term after the first is multiplied by a common ratio. Let me denote the common ratio for the geometric sequence as r_k.\n\nSimilarly, the next trio, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, forms an arithmetic progression. In that case, each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference, let's call it d_k.\n\nGiven that the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms must be positive integers, and each subsequent term is larger than the previous one.\n\nLet me think about how the sequence is built. Starting from a1, which is the first term. Then, since a1, a2, a3 form a geometric progression, we have:\n\na2 = a1 * r1\n\na3 = a2 * r1 = a1 * r1^2\n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic progression starting at a2, we have:\n\na3 = a2 + d1\n\na4 = a3 + d1 = a2 + 2d1\n\nSo, from the geometric progression, we have a3 = a1 * r1^2 and from the arithmetic progression, a3 = a2 + d1. But a2 is a1 * r1, so substituting:\n\na1 * r1^2 = a1 * r1 + d1\n\n"

Let me note that down.\n\nMoving on, the next set of three terms is a3, a4, a5. Since k increases, for k=2, we have a3, a4, a5 as geometric. So:\n\na4 = a3 * r2\n\na5 = a4 * r2 = a3 * r2^2\n\nBut from the previous arithmetic progression (for k=1), we also have a4 = a3 + d2.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify: for k=1, we have the arithmetic progression a2, a3, a4, so d1 is the common difference.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2, the arithmetic progression is a4, a5, a6, so the common difference would be d2, and so on.\n\nWait, hold on, let me correct that. For each k, the arithmetic progression is a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}. So for k=1, it's a2, a3, a4. For k=2, it's a4, a5, a6, etc. So yes, each time, the arithmetic progression starts at an even index.\n\nSo, for k=1, a2, a3, a4 is arithmetic, so common difference d1 = a3 - a2.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2, a4, a5, a6 is arithmetic, so common difference d2 = a5 - a4.\n\nAnd so on. So, in general, for each k, the common difference dk = a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}.\n\nBut wait, for the arithmetic progression, the difference is the same between consecutive terms. So, a3 - a2 = d1, and a4 - a3 = d1 as well, right? Because in an arithmetic sequence, the difference is constant.\n\nWait, no, wait. The arithmetic progression for k=1 is a2, a3, a4, so a3 - a2 = d1, and a4 - a3 = d1. Similarly, for k=2, a4, a5,"

So, even if a1 is integer, the ratios must be such that each term is integer.\n\nTherefore, in the case of q=6, p=11, r1=11/6, but a2=14*(11/6)= (14*11)/6=154/6=77/3, which is not integer. So this is invalid.\n\nTherefore, even though a1 is integer, the terms may not be integers. So, this case is invalid.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my assumption that 6r1 +1 must be integer is leading to a contradiction here. Maybe I need to consider that 6r1 +1 is a fraction, so that when squared and multiplied by a1, it gives an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that all the terms must be integers, so the ratios must be fractions such that each term is an integer.\n\nLet me think differently. Let me consider that all the terms are integers, so the ratios r_k must be rational numbers such that each term is an integer.\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern in the terms expressed in terms of a1 and r1.\n\nLooking back at the expressions we had earlier:\n\na1 = a1\n\na2 = a1 r1\n\na3 = a1 r1^2\n\na4 = a1 r1 (2r1 -1 )\n\na5 = a1 (2r1 -1 )^2\n\na6 = a1 (2r1 -1 )(3r1 -2 )\n\na7 = a1 (3r1 -2 )^2\n\na8 = a1 (3r1 -2 )(4r1 -1 )\n\na9 = a1 (4r1 -1 )^2\n\na10 = a1 (4r1 -1 )(5r1 )\n\na11 = a1 (5r1 )^2\n\na12 = a1 (5r1 )(6r1 +1 )\n\na13 = a1 (6r1 +1 )^2\n\nWait, hold on, in my previous calculation for a12, I think I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nEarlier, when computing a12:\n\nAfter a11 = a1*(5r1)^2,\n\nthe arithmetic progression starting at a10"
