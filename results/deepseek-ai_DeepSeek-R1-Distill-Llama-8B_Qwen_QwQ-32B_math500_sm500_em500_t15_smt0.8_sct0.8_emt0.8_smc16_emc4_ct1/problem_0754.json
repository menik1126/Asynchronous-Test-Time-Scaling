It's about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers with some specific properties involving geometric and arithmetic subsequences. The goal is to find \\( a_1 \\) given that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\).\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it correctly. We have a sequence \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots \\) where each term is a positive integer, and the sequence is strictly increasing. For every positive integer \\( k \\), two conditions hold:\n\n1. The subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) forms a geometric sequence.\n2. The subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) forms an arithmetic sequence.\n\nWe are told that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\) and need to find \\( a_1 \\).\n\nOkay, so let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\n- A geometric sequence has each term after the first found by multiplying the previous term by a common ratio, say \\( r \\).\n- An arithmetic sequence has each term after the first obtained by adding a common difference, say \\( d \\).\n\nGiven that, let's look at the conditions for each \\( k \\).\n\nFor each \\( k \\), the terms \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) are geometric. So, using the property of geometric sequences, we can write:\n\n\\( \\frac{a_{2k}}{a_{2k-1}} = \\frac{a_{2k+1}}{a_{2k}} \\).\n\nThis implies that \\( a_{2k}^2 = a_{2k-1} \\times a_{2k+1} \\).\n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic sequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\), the common difference \\( d_k \\) is:\n\n\\( a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1} \\).\n\nWhich simplifies to \\( 2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k"

Since the sequence is strictly increasing, each subsequent term is larger than the previous, which is important when considering the ratios and differences.\n\nGiven that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\), we might need to work our way backwards from \\( a_{13} \\) to find \\( a_1 \\). That is, express earlier terms in terms of later ones using the relationships above.\n\nLet me try to see how this might work.\n\nStarting from \\( k \\), we have for the 13th term, \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\). Let's see what \\( k \\) relates to \\( a_{13} \\).\n\nWait, the indices are in terms of \\( 2k-1 \\), \\( 2k \\), \\( 2k+1 \\), etc. So, for \\( a_{13} \\), I need to see which \\( k \\) would make \\( 2k+1 = 13 \\), since \\( a_{2k+1} \\) is part of the geometric sequence.\n\nSolving \\( 2k+1 = 13 \\): \\( 2k = 12 \\) → \\( k = 6 \\).\n\nSo, when \\( k = 6 \\), the geometric sequence is \\( a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13} \\). And the arithmetic sequence is \\( a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14} \\).\n\nBut since we're given \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\), perhaps we can work our way back through \\( k = 6 \\) to find \\( a_{11}, a_{12} \\), and so on, until we reach \\( a_1 \\).\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nFirst, for \\( k = 6 \\):\n\nThe geometric sequence is \\( a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13} \\). So,\n\n\\( a_{12}^2 = a_{11} \\times a_{13} \\)\n\nWe know"
