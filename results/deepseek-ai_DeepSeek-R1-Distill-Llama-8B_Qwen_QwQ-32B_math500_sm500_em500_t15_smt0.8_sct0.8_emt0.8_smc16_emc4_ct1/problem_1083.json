Here's how it's calculated:\n\n1. Term 1: 0\n2. Term 2: 0 + 1 = 1\n3. Term 3: 1 × 1 = 1\n4. Term 4: 1 + 2 = 3\n5. Term 5: 3 × 2 = 6\n6. Term 6: 6 + 3 = 9\n7. Term 7: 9 × 3 = 27\n8. Term 8: 27 + 4 = 31\n9. Term 9: 31 × 4 = 124\n10. Term 10: 124 + 5 = 129\n\nSince Term 10 is 129, which is greater than 125, it is the first term that meets the condition.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the given sequence step by step to find the first term greater than 125.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Sequence Rule\n- **Starting Point:** The first term is **0**.\n- **Subsequent Terms:** \n  - Add the next integer (starting from 1).\n  - Multiply by the next integer.\n  - Repeat this alternating pattern.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Each Term\nLet's compute each term using the rule:\n\n1. **Term 1:** 0\n2. **Term 2:** 0 + 1 = **1**\n3. **Term 3:** 1 × 1 = **1**\n4. **Term 4:** 1 + 2 = **3**\n5. **Term 5:** 3 × 2 = **6**\n6. **Term 6:** 6 + 3 = **9**\n7. **Term 7:** 9 × 3 = **27**\n8. **Term 8:** 27 + 4 = **31**\n9. **Term 9:** 31 × 4 = **124**\n10. **Term 10:** 124 + 5 = **129**\n\n### Step 3: Identify the First Term Greater Than 125\nFrom the calculations:\n- **Term 10"

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
