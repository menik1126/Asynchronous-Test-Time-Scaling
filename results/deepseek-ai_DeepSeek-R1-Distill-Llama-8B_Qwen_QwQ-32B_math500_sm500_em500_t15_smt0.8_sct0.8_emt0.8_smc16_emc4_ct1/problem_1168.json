            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: z⁴ + 4z³i -6z² -4zi -i = 0. The solutions to this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane. I need to find the area of this polygon and express it in the form p^(a/b), where a, b, p are positive integers, p is prime, and a and b are relatively prime. Then, find a + b + p.\n\nHmm, let me start by trying to solve the equation or at least simplify it somehow. The equation is a quartic (degree 4) in z. Since it's a complex equation, the solutions will be complex numbers, which correspond to points in the complex plane. These points form a convex polygon, so the roots should form the vertices of a quadrilateral or something similar.\n\nLooking at the equation, I notice that the coefficients involve powers of i, which suggests that maybe a substitution could simplify things. Let me try substituting w = z i. That is, let me let w = z i. Then z = w / i. Since i is the imaginary unit, 1/i is -i, so z = -i w. Maybe substituting this into the equation will simplify the expression.\n\nLet me substitute z = -i w into the equation:\n\nz⁴ + 4z³i -6z² -4zi -i = 0.\n\nSubstituting z = -i w:\n\n(-i w)^4 + 4*(-i w)^3*i -6*(-i w)^2 -4*(-i w)*i -i = 0.\n\nNow, let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (-i w)^4.\n\nSince (-i)^4 = (i)^4 = 1, because i² = -1, so i^4 = 1. So (-i w)^4 = ( (-i)^4 ) * w^4 = 1 * w^4 = w^4.\n\nSecond term: 4*(-i w)^3*i.\n\nCompute (-i w)^3 first: (-i)^3 = (-i)*(-i)*(-i) = (-(i²))*(-i) = (-(-1))*(-i) = 1*(-i) = -i. So (-i w)^3 = (-i w³). Multiply by 4*i: 4*(-i w"

Multiply by -6: -6*(-w²) = 6 w².\n\nFourth term: -4*(-i w)*i.\n\nCompute (-i w)*i: (-i)*(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So it's (-i w)*i = w.

That would mean p q = i, but p and q are real numbers (if b and d are purely imaginary), but p q = i would require p or q to be complex, which contradicts them being real. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one is a multiple of i and the other is not.

The area of a convex quadrilateral can be found if we know the coordinates of the vertices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the roots are vertices of a square or rectangle, which would make the area easier to compute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the roots are symmetric with respect to some axis or point.\n\n"
