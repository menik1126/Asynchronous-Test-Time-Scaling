The solutions to this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of this polygon. The answer should be expressed in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, and then find \\( a + b + p \\). \n\nFirst, I should probably try to solve the equation. It's a quartic equation, which can be tricky, but sometimes they factor nicely. Let me write it down again:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 -4i z - i = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, looking at this, I notice that the coefficients have a pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. It seems like it might be related to a binomial expansion because of the coefficients 1, 4, 6, 4, etc. Wait, 4 is 4i, then 6 is 6 (times z squared term), then 4i again, then -i.\n\nLet me recall that \\( (z + a)^4 \\) expands to \\( z^4 + 4a z^3 + 6a^2 z^2 + 4a^3 z + a^4 \\). Comparing this to my given equation, maybe I can find a suitable \\( a \\) such that the expansion matches.\n\nLet me denote \\( (z + a)^4 \\) as equal to the given equation.

So, that would give a + b + p = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because earlier when I tried to compute the distances, I thought they were 1.68, which is 2^{3/4}. Wait, 2^{3/4} is about 1.6818. So yes, 2^{3/4} is approximately 1.68.\n\nBut let's confirm the area:\n\nIf it's a square, the area is (side length)^2, which would be (2^{3/4})^2 = 2^{3/2}. So 2^{3/2} is sqrt(8), which is 2*sqrt(2). So, expressed as a single exponent, that is 2^{3/2}.\n\nTherefore, a = 3, b = 2, and p = 2.\n\nHence, a + b + p = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Did I make a mistake in considering the polygon?\n\nWait, actually, perhaps it's not a square. Since all four points form a rectangle but with equal sides, so it's a square.\n\nWait, another way: considering the roots of the equation. When I wrote \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\), then the roots are the fourth roots of (1 + i) shifted by -i. So, the four roots w form a square centered at the origin, but rotated by some angle. Then shifting each w by -i should also form a square, perhaps rotated and translated.\n\nBut according to the coordinates, the four points form a rectangle which is actually a square because all sides are equal.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of the polygon as a square with side length 2 * 2^{-1/4} = 2^{1 - 1/4} = 2^{3/4}.\n\nWait, okay, I think I'm consistent here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the area using the shoelace formula.\n\nGiven the four points:\n\nz0: (a, b) = (2^{-1/4}, 2^{-1/4} - 1)\n\nz1: (-a, b)\n\nz2: (-a, -(a + 1))\n\nz"
