Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with a constraint. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's another way too. Let me try to recall.\n\nI remember that for optimization under constraints, Lagrange multipliers are a powerful tool. The idea is to find the critical points of the function subject to the constraint, so we can determine the maximum or minimum values. So, let me set up the function and the constraint.\n\nLet me denote the function to maximize as \\( f(a, b, c, d) = ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\) and the constraint is \\( g(a, b, c, d) = a + b + c + d - 10 = 0 \\).\n\nAccording to the method of Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of f and g must be proportional at the maximum point. That means:\n\n\\( \\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g \\)\n\nSo, I need to compute the partial derivatives of f and g.\n\nFirst, let's compute the partial derivatives of f:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a} = b^2 c^3 d^4 \\) (since the derivative of a with respect to a is 1, and the rest is treated as constants)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, it's the derivative of a times the rest. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b} = 2ab c^3 d^4 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} = 3ab^2 c^2 d^4 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} = 4ab^2 c^3 d^3 \\)\n\nNow, the partial derivatives of g:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial a} = 1 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial b} = 1 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c} = 1 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} = 1 \\)\n\nSo"

So, xi proportional to ki.\n\nSo, in our problem, the product is a * b^2 * c^3 * d^4. So, treating each variable as a separate term, but in our problem a + b + c + d =10.\n\nBut the exponents here are different.\n\nWait, but actually, the product is a * b^2 * c^3 * d^4, which can be thought of as a single term for each variable, but raised to exponents. Alternatively, we can multiple variables.\n\nWait, for instance, variables a, b, c, d have exponents 1,2,3,4 respectively, so the total is 10 variables as a, b, b, c, c, c, d, d, d, d.\n\nSo, if we consider all variables, the 10 variables are a, b, b, c, c, c, d, d, d, d.\n\nThen, the product is a * b * b * c * c * c * d * d * d * d.\n\nSo, 10 variables, each 1,2,3,4 times respectively.\n\nSo, according to AM-GM, the product will be maximized when all the variables are equal.
