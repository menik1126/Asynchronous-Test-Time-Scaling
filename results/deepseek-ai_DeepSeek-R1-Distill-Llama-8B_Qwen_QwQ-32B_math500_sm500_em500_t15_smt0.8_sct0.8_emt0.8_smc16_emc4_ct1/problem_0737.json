This gives me \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nFinally, I recognize that \\(3^x = 9\\) implies \\(x = 2\\) because \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n</think>\n\n**Question:** For what value of \\(x\\) is \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\)?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute \\(2^3\\) into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate \\(3^x\\):**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
