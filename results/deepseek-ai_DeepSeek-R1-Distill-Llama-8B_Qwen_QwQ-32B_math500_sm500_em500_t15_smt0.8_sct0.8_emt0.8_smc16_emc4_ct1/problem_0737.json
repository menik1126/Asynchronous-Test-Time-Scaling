So the equation becomes \\( 8 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\).\n\nNext, to isolate \\( 3^x \\), I will divide both sides of the equation by 8. This simplifies the equation to \\( 3^x = \\frac{72}{8} \\), which is \\( 3^x = 9 \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the value of \\( x \\) such that \\( 3^x = 9 \\). I recognize that 9 is equal to \\( 3^2 \\). Therefore, \\( x \\) must be 2 to satisfy the equation.\n\nFinally, I will verify that \\( x = 2 \\) is indeed the correct solution by substituting it back into the original equation:\n\\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 = 8 \\cdot 9 = 72 \\), which matches the given value.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Evaluate \\( 2^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute \\( 2^3 \\) into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Isolate \\( 3^x \\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Verify the solution:**\n   \\[\n   2^3 \\cdot 3^2 = 8 \\cdot 9 = 72\n   \\]\n   The equation holds true, confirming that \\( x = 2 \\) is the correct solution.\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\"
