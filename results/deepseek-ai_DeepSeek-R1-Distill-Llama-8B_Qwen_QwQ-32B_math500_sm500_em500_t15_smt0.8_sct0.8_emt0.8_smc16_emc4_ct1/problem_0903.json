This means that the fraction can be expressed with a denominator that is a power of 10, which is necessary for a terminating decimal.\n\nNext, I'll adjust the fraction to have a denominator of \\(10^n\\) by choosing \\(n\\) to be the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of the denominator. In this case, the exponents are 2 for 2 and 7 for 5, so I'll set \\(n = 7\\).\n\nThis involves multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^{7-2} = 2^5\\) to make the denominator \\(10^7\\).\n\nAfter adjusting, the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{21 \\cdot 32}{10^7}\\).\n\nCalculating the multiplication in the numerator, \\(21 \\cdot 32 = 672\\), which simplifies the fraction to \\(\\frac{672}{10^7}\\).\n\nFinally, dividing 672 by \\(10^7\\) gives the terminating decimal \\(0.0000672\\).\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement for Terminating Decimals:**\n   A fraction will have a terminating decimal if and only if, in its reduced form, the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. \n\n2. **Analyze the Denominator:**\n   The given denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\). \n   \n   - The prime factors are already restricted to 2 and 5.\n   - Therefore, the fraction is already in a form that can be expressed with a terminating decimal.\n\n3. **Adjust the Fraction to Have a Denominator of \\(10^n\\):**\n   To convert the denominator to a power of 10 (\\(10^n\\)), we need to make sure that the denominator has an equal number of 2s and 5s. This is because \\(10^n = 2^n \\cdot 5^n\\).\n"
