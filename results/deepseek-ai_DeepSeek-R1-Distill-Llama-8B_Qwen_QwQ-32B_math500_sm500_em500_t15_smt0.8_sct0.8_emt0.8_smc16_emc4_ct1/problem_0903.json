The numerator is 21, which factors into 3 and 7.\n\nI'll adjust the denominator to only include 2s by multiplying it by \\(5^7\\) to make it a common denominator with the numerator.\n\nAfter that, I'll convert the fraction by moving the decimal point appropriately to make the denominator a power of 10.\n\nFinally, I'll perform the division to obtain the terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) into a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Denominator:**\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 4 \\cdot 78125 = 312500\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Express the Fraction with a Power of 10 as the Denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{312500} = \\frac{21}{312500} \\times \\frac{5^5}{5^5} = \\frac{21 \\times 5^5}{10^6}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate \\(21 \\times 5^5\\):**\n   \\[\n   5^5 = 3125 \\\\\n   21 \\times 3125 = 65625\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Rewrite the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{65625}{10^6} = 0.065625\n   \\]\n   \nTherefore, the terminating decimal representation of \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.065625}\n\\]"
