I need to find the sum of all complex solutions for this equation. Since it's a complex equation, I might expect multiple solutions, maybe even some with imaginary parts. But the question just says \"complex solutions,\" so I should include everything except real ones if necessary, but I think in this case all solutions might be real.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the equation. On the left side, there are four rational functions, each of the form \\( \\frac{k}{x^2 - k} \\) where k is 1,2,3,4. The right side is a linear function in x, 2010x - 4. So, the equation is a combination of these rational functions equaling a linear term.\n\nOne strategy I can think of is to simplify the left side. Maybe I can combine these fractions into a single rational function. But with different denominators, that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can make this equation easier.\n\nLooking at the denominators, each is of the form \\( x^2 - k \\). Let me note that \\( x^2 - k = (x - \\sqrt{k})(x + \\sqrt{k}) \\). So, each denominator has two roots: \\( x = \\sqrt{k} \\) and \\( x = -\\sqrt{k} \\). Therefore, the left-hand side (LHS) has singularities (i.e., points where it's undefined) at \\( x = \\pm 1, \\pm \\sqrt{2}, \\pm \\sqrt{3}, \\pm 2 \\). But the problem says to consider complex solutions, so even if the original equation has restrictions, the complex plane allows all x except these singularities. But maybe the solutions are somewhere else?\n\nWait, but the right side is a linear function, which is defined everywhere. The left side is a sum of four rational functions, each of which has two poles (singularities) in the complex plane."

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the equation is of the form f(x) = 2010x -4, where f(x) is the sum of those fractions. Since f(x) is a function with poles at x=±1, ±√2, etc., but the right side is a straight line. The solutions are the intersections between f(x) and the line 2010x -4. Since f(x) has vertical asymptotes at those poles, the line might cross f(x) near those asymptotes, but in complex plane, all intersections are considered.\n\nBut the problem is to find the sum of all complex solutions. In complex analysis, the sum of roots of a polynomial equation can be found via Vieta's formula, which relates the sum to the coefficients. So, perhaps if I can rewrite the equation as a polynomial equation, then the sum of roots would be the negative coefficient of the second highest degree term divided by the leading coefficient.\n\nTherefore, maybe the key is to form the polynomial equation and then apply Vieta's formula. But the problem is that the equation is quite complicated, so expanding all terms would be tedious, but perhaps manageable if we can find a pattern or a way to compute the coefficients without expanding everything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here.

Each term k/(x² -k) has poles at x=±sqrt(k), so the function is defined on the complex plane except at those points. So, in the complex plane, it has multiple poles, and the equation equals a linear function. So, how many solutions can we expect? In complex plane, the equation can have multiple solutions, but we need to find all of them.\n\nBut perhaps instead of trying to compute each solution, as it might be too hard, I can consider the equation as a polynomial equation via the method I did before, where multiply through by (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4).

So, the equation is as above.\n\nNow, the problem is that expanding all of this would lead to a very high-degree polynomial. Let me see the degree of each term.\n\nFirst, the terms from the left side (the first four terms):\n\nEach term like (x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4) is a product of three quadratic terms, so each is a degree 6 polynomial. So, each of the four terms is degree 6, so when summed, the left part (before subtracting the RHS term) is a degree 6 polynomial.\n\nThe RHS term is (2010x -4)*D, where D is a product of four quadratics, so D is degree 8. Multiplying by x gives degree 9, and by a constant gives degree 8. So, the RHS term is degree 9.\n\nTherefore, when we subtract the RHS term from the LHS terms, the entire equation becomes a polynomial of degree 9. Therefore, the equation is a 9th-degree polynomial equation. Therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, there are 9 roots (counting multiplicity) in the complex plane. However, we have to exclude the poles where the original equation is undefined, but since we multiplied through by D, those poles become roots of the equation (since D is zero there), but they are actually not solutions of the original equation. Therefore, the original equation's solutions are the roots of this 9th-degree polynomial except for the roots of D (i.e., x^2 =1,2,3,4). Therefore, the actual solutions are the roots of the polynomial equation excluding those poles. Therefore, the number of solutions would be 9 minus the number of poles that are roots. But since the poles are at x=±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2, so 8 points. But the polynomial is degree 9, so there is one more root. Therefore, the original equation has 9 - 8 = 1 solution?

So, it will have 9 roots, which include the original poles (since D is a factor). But the original equation is undefined at the poles, so the roots of D are not solutions to the original equation. Therefore, the number of solutions is 9 - 8 (because we have 8 poles, but each might have multiplicity 1?) Wait, no, actually, the D is (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4), so each quadratic is squared, so multiplicity 2 for each x=±1, etc. So, in D, each pole is of multiplicity 2, right?\n\nWait, that would mean that the equation now is a degree 9 polynomial, which has 9 roots (counting multiplicities). But the original equation is undefined at x=±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2, so those are 8 points, but each with multiplicity 1 each? Or 2?\n\nWait, each pole is at x=±sqrt(k), so each is a simple pole because the derivative at that point is not zero. So, each x=±sqrt(k) is a simple zero of D, as D = (x² -k). So, D has zeros at x=±sqrt(k), each of multiplicity 1. So, in the equation after multiplication, the polynomial equation is of degree 9, with the terms subtracted. So, if the RHS term is (2010x -4)*D, which is a degree 9 polynomial.

Therefore, the original equation has only one solution.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is equal to that single solution. But how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick to avoid dealing with the entire 9th-degree polynomial. Maybe if I consider that the sum of all roots of a polynomial is equal to - coefficient of x^{n-1} divided by coefficient of x^n.\n\nSo, for a polynomial P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_0, the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n.\n\nIn our case, after forming the 9th-degree polynomial, if we can write it as P(x) = 0, then the sum of all roots is - coefficient of x^8 / coefficient of x^9.\n\nBut the problem is that I can't compute the coefficients directly because expanding the entire polynomial is too tedious. But maybe there is a clever way to compute the coefficients.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe instead of expanding all the terms, I can compute the coefficient of x^8 and x^9 in the equation, because the"
