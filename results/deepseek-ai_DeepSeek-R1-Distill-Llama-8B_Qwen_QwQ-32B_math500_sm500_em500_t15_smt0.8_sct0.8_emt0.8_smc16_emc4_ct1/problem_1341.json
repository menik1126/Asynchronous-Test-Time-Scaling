Hmm, complex solutions... so both real and complex roots? But in this case, since it's a rational equation, I might have to find all x that satisfy it. Wait, but the equation is a bit complicated with all these fractions. Maybe I can find a clever substitution or manipulate it somehow to get a polynomial equation.\n\nFirst, let me write it down again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nLooking at the denominators, I notice they are of the form \\(x^2 - k\\) where k is 1, 2, 3, 4. So maybe substituting \\(y = x^2\\) could simplify things? Let me try that.\n\nLet \\(y = x^2\\). Then each term becomes:\n\n- \\(1/(y - 1)\\)\n- \\(2/(y - 2)\\)\n- \\(3/(y - 3)\\)\n- \\(4/(y - 4)\\)\n\nSo the left side is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}\n\\]\n\nAnd the right side is:\n\n\\[\n2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but wait, the right side still has an x in it, so substituting y as x squared complicates things because both y and x are variables. Maybe that substitution isn't helpful after all. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to let’s denote \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - "

Maybe I can find a common denominator for the left side and combine the terms.\n\nLet me try that. The denominators are \\(x^2 -1\\), \\(x^2-2\\), \\(x^2-3\\), \\(x^2-4\\). So the common denominator would be the product of all these denominators: \\((x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4)\\). That seems complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nSo, combining the terms:\n\nLeft side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\cdot (x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -4) + 4 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)}{(x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4)}.\n\\]\n\nThat numerator looks messy, but perhaps it can be simplified. Let me write it as:\n\nNumerator = \\(1 \\cdot (x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -4) + 4 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)\\).\n\nLet me try expanding each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 1·(x²−2)(x²−3)(x²−4).

Solving a ninth-degree equation is generally impossible, but perhaps it factors in some way or has some obvious roots.\n\nLet me check if x=0 is a root. If I plug in x=0:\n\nLeft side: 1/(-1) + 2/(-2) + 3/(-3) + 4/(-4) = -1 -1 -1 -1 = -4.\n\nRight side: 2010*0 -4 = -4.\n\nSo yes, x=0 is a solution.\n\nSo, x=0 is a root, so x is a factor. So, let's factor out an x:\n\nx*(-2010x^8 +4x^7 +20100x^6 -30x^6 -70535x^5 +70x^4 +100500x^3 -50x² -48360)=0.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n-2010x^9 +4x^8 +20100x^7 -30x^6 -70535x^5 +100500x^3 +70x^4 -50x² -48360x=0.\n\nFactor out an x:\n\nx*(-2010x^8 +4x^7 +20100x^6 -30x^5 -70535x^4 +70x^3 +100500x^2 -50x -48360)=0.\n\nSo, indeed, x=0 is a root, and the remaining equation is:\n\n-2010x^8 +4x^7 +20100x^6 -30x^5 -70535x^4 +70x^3 +100500x^2 -50x -48360=0.\n\nHmm, this eighth-degree polynomial is still tricky"
