To combine it with other terms, I'll need to express it with a common denominator.\n\nNext, I'll look at the term 1/√2. To simplify this, I'll rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by √2, which gives me √2/2.\n\nThen, I'll consider the term √3. Similar to √2, I'll express it with a common denominator.\n\nFinally, I'll examine the term 1/√3. I'll rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by √3, resulting in √3/3.\n\nAfter simplifying all the terms, I'll combine them into a single fraction by finding the least common denominator, which is 6. This will allow me to add all the numerators together.\n\nOnce combined, I'll determine the values of a, b, and c from the resulting fraction. I'll ensure that c is as small as possible and that all coefficients are positive integers.\n\nFinally, I'll add the values of a, b, and c to find the final answer.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Simplify Each Term**\n\n1. **Simplify \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\):**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\n2. **Simplify \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\):**\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the Expression with Simplified Terms**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Factor Out \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\)**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\sqrt{3}\\left(1 + \\frac"
