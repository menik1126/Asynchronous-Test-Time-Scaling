            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to combine these square roots and their reciprocals into a single fraction in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c. The goal is to find the smallest possible c and then add a, b, and c together. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right:\n\n√2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3\n\nHmm, so I have two terms with √2 and two terms with √3. Maybe I can combine the like terms separately. That seems logical.\n\nStarting with the √2 terms: √2 and 1/√2. Similarly, for √3: √3 and 1/√3. If I can combine each pair, I'll have a simplified expression.\n\nLet me focus on the √2 terms first. So, √2 + 1/√2. To combine these, I think I need a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and √2, so the common denominator would be √2.\n\nSo, √2 can be written as (√2 * √2)/√2, which is 2/√2. Then, adding 1/√2 gives me 2/√2 + 1/√2 = 3/√2.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. √2 is equal to (√2)(√2)/√2, which is 2/√2, yes. So adding 1/√2 gives 3/√2. Got it.\n\nSimilarly, for the √3 terms: √3 + 1/√3. Using the same approach.\n\n√3 can be written as (√3 * √3)/√3, which is 3/√3. Then adding 1/√3 gives 3/√3 + 1/√3 = 4/√3.\n\nOkay, so now my expression simplifies to:\n\n3/√2 + 4/√3.\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have two fractions, but they still have radicals in the denominator. I need to rationalize the denominators to combine them into a single fraction.\n\nStarting with 3/√2. To rationalize, I multiply numerator and denominator by √2:\n\n(3 * √2) / (√2 * √2)"

            "output": " = 3√2 / 2.\n\nSimilarly, for 4/√3. Multiply numerator and denominator by √3:\n\n(4 * √3) / (√3 * √3) = 4√3 / 3.\n\nSo now, my expression is 3√2/2 + 4√3/3.\n\nAlright, so now both terms have a single radical in the numerator and a rational denominator. To add these together, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator (LCD) is 6.\n\nSo, I can rewrite each fraction with denominator 6.\n\nFor 3√2/2: Multiply numerator and denominator by 3. So, (3√2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = 9√2/6.\n\nFor 4√3/3: Multiply numerator and denominator by 2. So, (4√3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = 8√3/6.\n\nNow, adding them together: 9√2/6 + 8√3/6 = (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nSo, the expression is (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nNow, let me check if this can be simplified further. Looking at the coefficients 9 and 8, and the denominator 6. I don't see any common factors between 9, 8, and 6 except for 1. So, I think this is already in the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Adding them together: 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal expression: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3.\n\nCombined √2 terms: √2 + 1/√2 = (√2 * √2 + 1)/√2 = (2 + 1)/√2 = 3/√2.\n\nSimilarly, √3 + 1/√3 = (3 + 1)/√3 = 4/√3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nRationalizing denominators: 3/√2 becomes 3√2/2, and 4/√3 becomes 4√"

Sum is 23.\n\nWait, is there a way to write this with a smaller denominator? For example, can c be reduced further? 9 and 8 have no common factors, so unless 6 and something else can be reduced, which 6 is 2*3, but 9 is 3^2, 8 is 2^3. The numerator has √2 and √3 terms, which can't be combined further. So the denominator c is 6, which is the least common multiple of 2 and 3.\n\nSo, I think 6 is the smallest possible denominator.
