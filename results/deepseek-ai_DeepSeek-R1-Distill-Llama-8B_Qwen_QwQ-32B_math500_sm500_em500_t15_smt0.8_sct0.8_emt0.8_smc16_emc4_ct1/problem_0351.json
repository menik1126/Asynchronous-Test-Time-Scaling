Without any parentheses, the value is 13. \n\nNow, I should consider how parentheses can change the order of operations to minimize the result. The goal is to group numbers with lower values together to reduce the overall sum.\n\nI'll start by trying to maximize the subtraction of larger numbers. One effective way is to group the larger numbers together under a subtraction sign.\n\nFor example, by placing parentheses around the larger numbers: \\( (1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6 \\). Calculating this gives \\(6 - 9 + 6 = 3\\).\n\nAlternatively, I can try different groupings to see if a lower result is possible. \n\nAnother strategy is to group the smallest numbers together: \\(1 + (2 - 4 + 5) + 6\\). This simplifies to \\(1 + 3 + 6 = 10\\), which is higher than 3.\n\nI also explored grouping the middle numbers: \\(1 + 2 + (3 - 4 + 5) + 6\\), resulting in \\(1 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 13\\), which doesn't improve the minimum.\n\nTesting all possible valid parentheses placements, I find that the initial grouping \\( (1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6 \\) yields the lowest value of 3. No other grouping results in a smaller number than this.\n</think>\n\nTo find the minimum possible value of the expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\) by adding parentheses, we need to strategically place them to minimize the overall result. \n\nLet's evaluate different placements of parentheses to see which yields the smallest value.\n\n**Example 1:** Group the first three numbers and the last two numbers separately.\n\\[\n(1 + 2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6 = 6 - 9 + 6 = 3\n\\]\n\n**Example 2:** Group the first two numbers and the next three numbers.\n\\[\n1 + (2 + 3 - 4 + 5) + 6 = 1 + 6 + 6 = 13\n\\]\n\n**Example 3:** Group the middle"

    "question": "The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)\n\nEnter your answer as a single value.",
