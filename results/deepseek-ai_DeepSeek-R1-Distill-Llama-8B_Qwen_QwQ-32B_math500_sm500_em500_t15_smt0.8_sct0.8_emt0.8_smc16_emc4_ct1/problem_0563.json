The group consists of 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.\n\nFirst, since the seating is circular, the arrangement is considered the same if it can be rotated into another. To eliminate rotational symmetry, I can fix the position of one person. Let's fix the Independent in a specific seat.\n\nNext, the Democrats and Republicans must each occupy contiguous blocks. I can treat each party as a single unit or \"block.\" This means there are three units to arrange: the Democrats, the Republicans, and the Independent.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these three units around the table is (3 - 1)! which equals 2. This accounts for the different orders of the blocks relative to each other.\n\nWithin each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange them, and similarly, the Republicans also have 5! ways to arrange their members.\n\nFinally, I can calculate the total number of seating arrangements by multiplying the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the permutations within each block: 2 * 5! * 5!.\n\nSo, the total number of ways the Senate committee can be seated under the given conditions is 2 * 5! * 5!.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the number of ways the Senate committee can be seated around a circular table with the condition that all members of each party sit next to each other, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Constraints\n- There are 11 members in total: 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.\n- All members of each party must sit next to each other.\n- The seating is circular, which means rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.\n\n### Step 2: Fix the Position of One Person to Account for Rotational Symmetry\nSince the table is circular, fixing the position of one person helps eliminate rotational symmetry. Let's fix the Independent in a specific seat. This fixed position serves as a reference point for counting unique arrangements.\n\n### Step 3: Treat Each Party as a Single Unit or \"Block\"\nEach party (Democrats and Republicans) must sit together, forming two blocks. Now, we have:\n- 1 block of Democrats\n- 1 block of Republicans"
