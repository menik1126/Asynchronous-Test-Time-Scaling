Hmm, the polynomial has integer coefficients, right? So, maybe I can use the Rational Root Theorem. \n\nLet me recall, the Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed as a reduced fraction p/q, is such that p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nIn this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, possible values for p are the factors of 1, which are ±1. And possible values for q are the factors of 2, which are ±1 and ±2. \n\nWait, but since p and q can be positive or negative, I need to consider both possibilities. Let me list all possible values of p/q. \n\nStarting with p = 1:\n- 1/1 = 1\n- 1/(-1) = -1\n- 1/2 = 0.5\n- 1/(-2) = -0.5\n\nThen for p = -1:\n- (-1)/1 = -1\n- (-1)/(-1) = 1\n- (-1)/2 = -0.5\n- (-1)/(-2) = 0.5\n\nSo, combining these, the possible distinct rational roots are 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. Are there any duplicates here? Let me see: 1 appears twice, -1 appears twice, 1/2 and -1/2 also appear twice. So, if we consider unique values, there are four distinct possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nLet me count them: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That's four different possible rational roots. \n\nWait, is that all? Let me make sure I didn't miss any factors. The constant term is 1, which only has factors ±1. The leading coefficient is 2, so its factors are ±1 and ±2. So, p can be ±1, and q can be ±1, ±2. That gives me all the combinations"

Let me just double-check that I haven't missed any cases. For example, could there be a p or q that isn't considered? No, because 1 and 2 are the only factors here. So, it's 1 over 1, -1 over 1, 1 over 2, -1 over 2, but we have to consider both positive and negative for p and q, but when reduced, it doesn't introduce new unique roots beyond those four. \n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\) with integer coefficients, we apply the Rational Root Theorem.
