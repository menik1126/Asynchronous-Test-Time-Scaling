Hmm, arithmetic sequences, right? They have a common difference between consecutive terms.\n\nLet me recall, an arithmetic sequence is like a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, and so on, where a is the first term and d is the common difference. So the nth term can be written as a + (n-1)d.\n\nGiven that the fourth term is 200, that would be when n = 4. So plugging into the formula, 200 = a + (4-1)d, which simplifies to 200 = a + 3d. I can write that as equation 1: a + 3d = 200.\n\nThen, the eighth term is 500. So for n = 8, the term is a + 7d. So, 500 = a + 7d. That's equation 2: a + 7d = 500.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. a + 3d = 200\n2. a + 7d = 500\n\nI need to solve for a and d. Since both equations have 'a', I can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a. Let me do that.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200\n\nSo that's a + 7d - a - 3d = 300\n\nSimplify: 4d = 300\n\nSo, d = 300 / 4 = 75\n\nGot it, the common difference d is 75.\n\nNow, plug this back into equation 1 to find a.\n\na + 3d = 200\n\nWe know d is 75, so:\n\na + 3*75 = 200\n\nCalculate 3*75: that's 225\n\nSo, a + 225 = 200\n\nSubtract 225 from both sides:\n\na = 200 - 225 = -25\n\nAlright, so the first term a is -25, and the common difference d is 75.\n\nNow, I need to find the sixth term. Let's remember that the nth term is a +"
