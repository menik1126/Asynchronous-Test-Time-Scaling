            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about polynomials, and I need to find P(5) given some conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so P(x) should look like x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nIt also says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Hmm, okay. So, R(x) is the remainder when dividing by a quadratic, which means R(x) should be a linear polynomial, right? Because when you divide by a degree 2 polynomial, the remainder is of lower degree, so either linear or constant. Since it's given as R(x), I think it's linear.\n\nSo, let me write R(x) as mx + n. That means when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is mx + n. And when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), which is 2mx + 2n.\n\nNow, I remember the Remainder Theorem, which states that the remainder of a polynomial P(x) divided by (x - c) is P(c). But here, we're dividing by quadratic polynomials, so it must be an extension of that. I think the polynomial satisfies P(a) = R(a) when divided by (x - a)(x - b), right?\n\nSo, for the first division by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder R(x) must satisfy R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, for the second division by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder 2R(x) must satisfy 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3).\n\nLet me note that down:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1) = m*1 + n = m + n\n2. P"

Since P(x) is x³ + ax² + bx + c, plugging in x=0 gives P(0) = c = 5. So, c = 5.\n\nSo, we can write P(x) as x³ + ax² + bx + 5.\n\nNow, let's write down the equations based on points 1 to 4.\n\nFrom P(1) = m + n:\n1. 1 + a + b + 5 = m + n => a + b + 6 = m + n\n\nFrom P(4) = 4m + n:\n4. 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 4m + n => 69 + 16a + 4b = 4m + n\n\nFrom P(2) = 4m + 2n:\n2. 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = 4m + 2n => 13 + 4a + 2b = 4m + 2n\n\nFrom P(3) = 6m + 2n:\n3. 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 = 6m + 2n => 32 + 9a + 3b = 6m + 2n\n\nSo, now I have four equations:\n\n1. a + b + 6 = m + n\n2. 4m + 2n = 13 + 4a + 2b\n3. 6m + 2n = 32 + 9a + 3b\n4. 4m + n = 69 + 16a + 4b\n\nHmm, okay, that's a system of equations with variables a, b, m, n. Let me see how to solve this.\n\nLet me denote equations 2 and 3 first, since both have 4"
