            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about polynomials. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to find P(5) given some conditions about the polynomial P(x). \n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so the polynomial will look something like x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nThen, it mentions that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5.\n\nHmm, okay. So, when a polynomial is divided by a quadratic, the remainder should be of lower degree, right? So R(x) must be a linear polynomial, meaning it has degree 1 or less. So R(x) can be written as mx + n, where m and n are constants.\n\nSince P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), which is a quadratic, the remainder R(x) would satisfy the condition:\n\nP(1) = R(1)\nP(4) = R(4)\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So,\n\nP(2) = 2R(2)\nP(3) = 2R(3)\n\nWait, that seems useful. So I have four equations here:\n\n1. R(1) = P(1)\n2. R(4) = P(4)\n3. 2R(2) = P(2)\n4. 2R(3) = P(3)\n\nAnd since R(x) is linear, R(x) = mx + n. Therefore, I can write these equations as:\n\n1. m*1 + n = P(1)\n2. m*4 + n = P(4)\n3. 2*(m*2 + n) = P(2)\n4. 2*(m*3 + n) = P(3)\n\nSo, I have four equations with variables m and n, as well as P(1), P("

But I also know that P is a cubic polynomial, so we can write it as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q(x) + R(x)\n\nBut since R(x) is linear, Q(x) must be a linear polynomial as well because (x - 1)(x - 4) is quadratic. So Q(x) can be written as ax + b, where a and b are constants.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)(ax + b) + mx + n\n\nExpanding this, since it's a degree 3 polynomial. Let me see:\n\nFirst, expand (x - 1)(x - 4):\n\n(x - 1)(x - 4) = x\u00b2 - 5x + 4\n\nThen, multiply by (ax + b):\n\n(x\u00b2 - 5x + 4)(ax + b) = ax\u00b3 + (b - 5a)x\u00b2 + (-5b + 4a)x + 4b\n\nSo P(x) is equal to that plus mx + n:\n\nP(x) = ax\u00b3 + (b - 5a)x\u00b2 + (-5b + 4a + m)x + (4b + n)\n\nNow, since P(x) is monic, the coefficient of x\u00b3 is 1, so a must be 1. Therefore, a = 1.\n\nSo, P(x) simplifies to:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + (b - 5)x\u00b2 + (-5b + 4 + m)x + (4b + n)\n\nNow, since we have P(0) = 5, let's plug x = 0 into this expression. All terms except the constant term will disappear.\n\nP(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + (4b + n) = 4b + n = 5.\n\nSo equation 5: 4b + n = 5.\n\nNow, let's go back to the earlier equations:\n\n1. m + n = P(1)\n2. 4m + n = P(4)\n3. 2*(2m + n) = P(2)\n4. 2*(3m + n) = P(3)\n\nBut we can now express P(1), P(2"
