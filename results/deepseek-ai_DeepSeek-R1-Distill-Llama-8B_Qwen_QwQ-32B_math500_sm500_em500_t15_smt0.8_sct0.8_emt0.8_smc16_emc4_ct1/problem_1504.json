For the second letter, there are 25 remaining choices, as it must be different from the first.\n\nSo, the total number of letter combinations is 26 multiplied by 25, which equals 650.\n\nNext, for the numbers, each digit can be from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible choices for each position. Since both numbers must be different, the first number has 10 possible choices, and the second has 9 remaining choices.\n\nTherefore, the total number of number combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n\nTo find the total number of license plates, I multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations.\n\nSo, 650 multiplied by 90 equals 58,500.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nHow many license plates can be formed if every license plate has:  \n- 2 different letters (A through Z)  \n- 2 different one-digit (0-9) numbers?\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Number of Possible Combinations for Letters\n\n1. **First Letter:**  \n   - There are 26 possible letters (A-Z).  \n   - Since no repetition is allowed, there are **26 choices**.\n\n2. **Second Letter:**  \n   - After choosing the first letter, there are **25 remaining choices**.  \n   - Therefore, there are **25 choices** for the second letter.\n\n3. **Total Letter Combinations:**  \n   - Multiply the number of choices for each position:  \n   - \\( 26 \\times 25 = 650 \\)  \n   - So, there are **650 different letter combinations**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Possible Combinations for Numbers\n\n1. **First Number:**  \n   - There are 10 possible digits (0-9).  \n   - Since no repetition is allowed, there are **10 choices**.\n\n2. **Second Number:**  \n   - After choosing the first number, there are **9 remaining choices**.  \n   - Therefore, there"
