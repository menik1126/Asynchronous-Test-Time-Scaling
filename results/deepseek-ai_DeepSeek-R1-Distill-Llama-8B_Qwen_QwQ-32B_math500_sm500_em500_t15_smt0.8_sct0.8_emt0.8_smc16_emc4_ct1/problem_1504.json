Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z) and each letter must be unique, the first letter has 26 possible choices. For the second letter, there are 25 remaining choices because it must be different from the first one.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of possible combinations for the digits. There are 10 possible digits (0-9), and each digit must also be unique. Therefore, the first digit has 10 possible choices, and the second digit has 9 remaining choices.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n\nSo, the total number of possible license plates is 26 multiplied by 25 multiplied by 10 multiplied by 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of possible license plates, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Given:\n- **Letters:** 2 different letters (A-Z)\n- **Digits:** 2 different digits (0-9)\n\n### Calculation:\n\n1. **Determine the number of possible combinations for letters:**\n   - First letter: 26 possible choices (A-Z)\n   - Second letter: 25 possible choices (since it must be different from the first)\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of letter combinations} = 26 \\times 25\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of possible combinations for digits:**\n   - First digit: 10 possible choices (0-9)\n   - Second digit: 9 possible choices (since it must be different from the first)\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of digit combinations} = 10 \\times 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of possible license plates:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total license plates} = (\\text{Number of letter combinations}) \\times (\\text{Number of digit combinations})\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total license plates} = (26 \\times 25) \\times (10 \\times 9)\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{26 \\times 25 \\times 10 \\times"
