            "output": "First, I'll define the variables for the number of students enrolled in each subject: let C represent the number of calculus students, P for physics, and Ch for chemistry.\n\nWe know that the total number of students in the school is 360. Out of these, 15 are not enrolled in any of calculus, physics, or chemistry. So, the number of students enrolled in at least one of these subjects is 360 - 15 = 345.\n\nIt's given that 180 students take calculus. Therefore, C = 180.\n\nThe problem states that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics, so Ch = 2P.\n\nAdditionally, 75 students take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 take both physics and chemistry. These values represent the intersections of the respective subjects.\n\nIt's also mentioned that 75 students take both calculus and physics, which is the intersection of calculus and physics.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, the total number of students enrolled in at least one subject can be calculated as:\nC + P + Ch - (C ∩ P) - (C ∩ Ch) - (P ∩ Ch) + (C ∩ P ∩ Ch) = 345\n\nSubstituting the known values and expressions:\n180 + P + 2P - 75 - 75 - 75 + (C ∩ P ∩ Ch) = 345\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n180 + 3P - 225 + (C ∩ P ∩ Ch) = 345\n\nCombining like terms:\n3P + (C ∩ P ∩ Ch) = 345 - 180 + 225\n3P + (C ∩ P ∩ Ch) = 390\n\nSince the number of students taking all three subjects must be less than or equal to those taking any two, a reasonable assumption is that (C ∩ P ∩ Ch) equals the minimum of the pairwise intersections, which is 75. Therefore, I set (C ∩ P ∩ Ch) = 75.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n3P + 75 = 390\n3P = 315\nP = 105\n\nTherefore, the number of students taking physics is 105.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given Data:**\n- Total students in the school = 360\n- Students not taking any of calculus,"
