            "output": "First, I'll start by noting the total number of students, which is 360. Out of these, 15 don't take any of the three subjects, so 360 minus 15 gives me 345 students who are enrolled in at least one of calculus, physics, or chemistry.\n\nNext, I know that 15 students take all three subjects, which means they are counted in each of the subject totals. To find the number of students taking only calculus, I'll subtract the 15 students who take all three from the total number of calculus students, which is 180: 180 minus 15 equals 165 students taking only calculus.\n\nThen, the problem states that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics. Let's denote the number of physics students as P. This means the number of chemistry students is 2P.\n\nI also know that 75 students take both physics and chemistry. Since these students are counted in both subjects, I'll need to account for them when calculating the total number of students taking physics and chemistry.\n\nAdditionally, 75 students take both calculus and chemistry, and 30 students take both physics and calculus. These overlapping groups will help me apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of students in all three subjects.\n\nFinally, by setting up the equations based on the information provided and solving for P, I can determine the number of students taking physics.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given Data:**\n- Total students in school: 360\n- Students not taking any of the subjects: 15\n- Students taking all three subjects (Calculus, Physics, Chemistry): 15\n- Students taking only Calculus: 180 (Total Calculus students) - 15 (all three) = 165\n- Students taking Physics = Students taking Chemistry * 2\n- Students taking both Physics and Chemistry = 75\n- Students taking both Calculus and Chemistry = 75\n- Students taking both Calculus and Physics = 30\n\n**Let’s denote:**\n- Let \\( P \\) = Number of students taking Physics\n- Then, Students taking Chemistry = \\( 2P \\) (as per the problem)\n- Students taking both Physics and Chemistry = 75\n\n**Students taking only Physics:** \\( P - 30 \\) (since 30 take both Physics and Calculus)\n\n**Students taking only Chemistry:** \\( 2P - 75 \\) ("
