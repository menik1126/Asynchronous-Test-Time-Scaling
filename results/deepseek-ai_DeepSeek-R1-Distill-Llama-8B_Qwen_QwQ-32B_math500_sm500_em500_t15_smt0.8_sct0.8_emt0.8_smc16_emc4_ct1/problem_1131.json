I will convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second to make the units consistent with the hallway's time measurement.\n\nI know that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters and 1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds. By dividing the distance by the time, I can find the speed in meters per second.\n\nCalculating this, the robot's speed is 1000 meters divided by 3600 seconds, which simplifies to 0.27778 meters per second.\n\nNext, I will use this speed to find out how long the hallway is. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the length of the hallway. By dividing the time by the speed, I can determine the distance.\n\nSo, 90 seconds divided by 0.27778 meters per second gives approximately 324 meters.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo find the length of the hallway, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the robot's speed.**\n\n   The robot travels:\n   - **Distance:** 1 kilometer = 1000 meters\n   - **Time:** 2.5 hours = 2.5 × 3600 seconds = 9000 seconds\n\n   **Speed** = Distance ÷ Time = 1000 meters ÷ 9000 seconds ≈ 0.1111 meters/second\n\n2. **Calculate the length of the hallway.**\n\n   The robot travels:\n   - **Distance:** \\( x \\) meters\n   - **Time:** 90 seconds\n\n   Using the speed found:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\Rightarrow 0.1111\\, \\text{m/second} = \\frac{x}{90}\\, \\text{seconds}\n   \\]\n\n   Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 0.1111 \\times 90 \\approx 10\\, \\text{meters}\n   \\]\n\nHowever, based on the correct calculation:\n\n3. **Calculate the correct length of the hallway using precise speed.**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{1000}{3600} = \\frac{5}{18}\\, \\text{m/second} \\approx 0"

Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, the correct speed is 1000 meters / 2.5 hours. Converting 2.5 hours to seconds: 2.5 × 3600 = 9000 seconds. So speed is 1000/9000 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111 m/s. Then, 0.1111 × 90 ≈ 10 meters. But this contradicts the previous step. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem states the robot takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 km. So speed is 1 km / 2.5 hours = 0.4 km/h. Converting to m/s: 0.4 km/h = 0.4 × 1000 m / 3600 s = 400/3600 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111 m/s. \n\nThen, time for hallway is 90 seconds. So distance is speed × time = 0.1111 × 90 ≈ 10 meters. But this seems conflicting with the initial thought. Wait, but the user's initial thought had a miscalculation. Let me re-express:\n\nWait, the user's first step had a mistake in the speed calculation. Let me correct it step by step.\n\n**Correct Step-by-Step:**\n\n1. **Convert the robot's speed to meters per second:**\n   - The robot travels 1 km (1000 meters) in 2.5 hours.\n   - Convert 2.5 hours to seconds: \\( 2.5 \\times 3600 = 9000 \\) seconds.\n   - Speed = \\( \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{1}{9} \\text{ m/s} \\approx"
