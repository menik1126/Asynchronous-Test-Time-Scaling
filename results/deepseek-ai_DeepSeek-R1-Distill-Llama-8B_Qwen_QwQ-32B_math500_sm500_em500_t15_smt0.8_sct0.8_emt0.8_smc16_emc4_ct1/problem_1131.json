            "output": "First, I need to determine the robot's speed. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. Converting 2.5 hours to hours might be helpful for calculating the speed in meters per second.\n\nNext, I'll convert 2.5 hours into seconds to make the speed consistent with the hallway measurement time. 2.5 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour equals 150 minutes. Then, multiplying by 60 seconds per minute gives 90,000 seconds.\n\nNow, I can calculate the speed by dividing the distance traveled, 1 kilometer (which is 1000 meters), by the time taken, 90,000 seconds. This gives the speed as approximately 0.01111 meters per second.\n\nSince the robot travels 0.01111 meters each second, to find the length of the hallway, I'll multiply this speed by the time it takes to travel the hallway, which is 90 seconds. This calculation results in 1 meter.\n\nTherefore, the hallway is 1 meter long.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the length of the hallway that the robot travels in 90 seconds.\n\n1. **Calculate the Robot's Speed:**\n   - The robot travels **1 kilometer** (1000 meters) in **2.5 hours**.\n   - First, convert 2.5 hours to seconds:\n     \\[\n     2.5\\ \\text{hours} \\times 60\\ \\text{minutes/hour} = 150\\ \\text{minutes}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     150\\ \\text{minutes} \\times 60\\ \\text{seconds/minute} = 90,000\\ \\text{seconds}\n     \\]\n   - Now, find the speed in meters per second (m/s):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1000\\ \\text{meters}}{90,000\\ \\text{seconds}} \\approx 0.01111\\ \\text{m/s}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Length of the Hallway:**\n   - The robot takes **90 seconds** to travel the hallway at the same speed.\n   - Use the speed to find the distance:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} ="
