We need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this transformation.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when a matrix transforms a vector, it does so linearly. So, if we have a line, which is a set of points, each point will be transformed by the matrix M. That means the image of the line will be another line, but we need to figure out its equation.\n\nBut wait, to find the image of the entire line, maybe I can figure out what happens to two points on the line. If I can find two transformed points, then I can determine the equation of the transformed line. Alternatively, I might need to find the image of the line under M by understanding how M affects the coefficients of the line.\n\nLet me think. The line given is y = 2x + 1. So, any point on this line can be written as (x, 2x + 1). Let's denote a general point on the line as (x, 2x + 1). When we apply the transformation M, this point becomes (x', y') where:\n\n\\[ \n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx' \\\\\ny'\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \n\\mathbf{M}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\n2x + 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nHmm, but I don't know what M is. Wait, the problem gives us two specific transformations:\n\n1. M takes [2; -1] to [9; 3].\n2. M takes [1; -3] to [7; -1].\n\nSo, maybe I can construct the matrix M using these two pieces of information. That makes sense because if I have two known vectors and their images, I can set up equations to solve for M.\n\nLet me denote M as:\n\n\\[ \n\\mathbf{M} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, according to the first transformation:\n\n\\[ \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n9 \\\\\n3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n"

Let's use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3: 6a - 3b = 27\n\nThen subtract equation 3: (6a - 3b) - (a - 3b) = 27 - 7\n\nThat gives 5a = 20 => a = 4\n\nThen plug back a = 4 into equation 1: 2*4 - b = 9 => 8 - b =9 => -b =1 => b = -1\n\nOkay, so a =4, b = -1.\n\nNow, moving on to equations 2 and 4 for c and d.\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d =3\n\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nAgain, let's use elimination.\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for d: d = 2c -3\n\nThen substitute into equation 4:\n\nc - 3*(2c -3) = -1\n\nc -6c +9 = -1\n\n-5c +9 = -1\n\n-5c = -10 => c = 2\n\nThen d = 2c -3 = 2*2 -3 =4 -3 =1\n\nSo, c=2, d=1.\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n\n\\[ \n\\math"

Let me plug them back into the original equations.\n\nFirst transformation: M * [2; -1] should be [9;3].\n\nCompute 4*2 + (-1)*(-1) =8 +1=9, correct. 2*2 +1*(-1) =4 -1=3, correct.\n\nSecond transformation: M*[1; -3] should be [7; -1].\n\nCompute 4*1 + (-1)*(-3) =4 +3=7, correct. 2*1 +1*(-3)=2 -3=-1, correct.\n\nPerfect, so M is correctly determined.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the image of the line y=2x+1 under M.

So, if I can find two points on the original line, transform them, and then find the equation of the line through the transformed points.\n\nWhich is essentially what I did. So, for x=0, the point is (0,1). Let me compute M*(0,1):\n\nx' =4*0 -1*1 = -1\n\ny' =2*0 +1*1 =1\n\nSo, point (-1,1).\n\nThen, for another point, say x=1: (1,3).\n\nCompute M*(1,3):\n\nx'=4*1 -1*3=4-3=1\n\ny'=2*1 +1*3=2+3=5\n\nSo, transformed point is (1,5).\n\nSo, now, we have two points on the image: (-1,1) and (1,5).
