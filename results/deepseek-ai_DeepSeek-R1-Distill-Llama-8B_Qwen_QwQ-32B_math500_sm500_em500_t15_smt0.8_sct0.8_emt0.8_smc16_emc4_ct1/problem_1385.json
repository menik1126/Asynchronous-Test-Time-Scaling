            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where a matrix M transforms one vector [2; -1] to [9; 3] and another vector [1; -3] to [7; -1]. I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this transformation. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a matrix transforms a vector, it's essentially applying linear transformations. So, if I can figure out the matrix M, I can then apply it to the entire line y = 2x + 1. But wait, do I really need to know the exact matrix M? Maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, another thought: if the line y = 2x + 1 is transformed by M, the image of this line will also be a line, right? Because linear transformations map lines to lines. So, perhaps I can find two points on the original line, apply the transformation to them, and then find the equation of the line connecting these transformed points.\n\nThat sounds like a plan. So, let me first find the two points on the line y = 2x + 1. Let's pick two x-values, plug them into the equation to get the corresponding y-values.\n\nLet me choose x = 0: then y = 2*0 + 1 = 1. So, one point is (0, 1).\n\nNext, let's choose another x-value. Maybe x = 1: then y = 2*1 + 1 = 3. So, the second point is (1, 3).\n\nGreat, now I have two points on the line: (0,1) and (1,3). Now, I need to apply the matrix M to these two vectors to get their images.\n\nBut wait, I don't have the matrix M. I have two transformations: M takes [2; -1] to [9; 3] and [1; -3] to [7; -1]. Hmm, that's two equations, but I have four variables if I consider M as a 2x2 matrix. Wait, no, actually, each transformation gives me two equations, so with two transformations, I should get enough equations to solve for all four entries of M.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\n[ a  b ]\n[ c  d ]\n\n"

Let's use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2: 2a - 6b = 14\n\nNow subtract equation 1 from this:\n\n(2a - 6b) - (2a - b) = 14 - 9\n\n2a -6b -2a + b = 5\n\n-5b = 5 => b = -1\n\nThen plug back into equation 2: a - 3*(-1) = 7 => a + 3 =7 => a =4\n\nSo, a =4, b = -1.\n\nNow, moving on to the second system for c and d.\n\nSecond system:\n\n2c - d = 3\n\nc - 3d = -1\n\nAgain, let's write them:\n\nEquation 3: 2c - d = 3\n\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nLet me solve this similarly.

Let me see.\n\nWait, but let's see the two points: from (-1,1) to (1,5). The difference in x is 2, difference in y is 4, so slope is 2. So the slope remains the same? Hmm, but maybe that's just a coincidence?\n\nWait, but let me see if there's another point to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another point on the original line to see.\n\nLet me pick another point on the original line, say x = -1. Then y = 2*(-1) +1 = -2 +1 = -1. So the point (-1, -1). Let's apply M to that.\n\nWait, the vector is [-1; -1]. Wait, but hold on, the original line is y = 2x +1, so when x = -1, y = -2 +1 = -1. So the point is (-1, -1). Let's apply M to that vector.\n\nM * [-1; -1] = [4*(-1) + (-1)*(-1), 2*(-1) +1*(-1)] = (-4 +1, -2 -1) = (-3, -3).

Wait, no, the point (-3, -3) would need to be on the line y = 2x + b. Let's see:\n\nIf x = -3, then y would be 2*(-3) + b = -6 + b. If that equals -3, then b = 3.

So the equation is y = 2x +3.\n\nWait, but if I plug in (-3, -3) into this equation, I get y = 2*(-3) +3 = -6 +3 = -3. So yes, (-3, -3) is on the line.\n\nSo, the line y = 2x +3 is the image of the original line under M.\n\nBut wait, that's interesting because the slope remained 2, but the intercept changed from 1 to 3. That seems correct, but let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by using the concept of linear transformations on lines.\n\nAnother way: the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M can be found by considering how M transforms the direction vector of the line and one point on the line.\n\nThe direction vector of the line y = 2x +1 is (1,2), because the slope is 2.\n\nSo, if I apply M to the direction vector [1;2], I should get another vector which is the direction vector of the image line.\n\nLet me compute M*[1;2]:\n\nM = [4   -1;\n      2    1]\n\nSo, [4*1 + (-1)*2, 2*1 +1*2] = (4 -2, 2 +2) = (2,4).\n\nSo the direction vector after transformation is (2,4), which simplifies to (1,2) if we divide by 2. So, same direction, which makes sense because the slope remained 2.\n\nNow, we can take a point on the original line and apply M to get a point on the image line.\n\nEarlier, we took (0,1), which transformed to (-1,1). Alternatively, we can use any other point, say (0,1), and then compute the line through the direction vector (1,2) and the point (-1,1).\n\nWait, but if the direction vector is (1,2), and passing through (-1"

To convert to slope-intercept form:\n\nSolve for t in terms of x: t = x +1.\n\nThen y =1 +2(x +1) = 1 +2x +2 = 2x +3. So same result.\n\nTherefore, the image line is y =2x +3.\n\nHmm, so that's consistent with the previous calculation. So that's good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do this using the general equation of the line.\n\nSuppose the original line is y =2x +1.
