Then, I have to sum the values of each of these polynomials evaluated at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nLet me start by looking at the given polynomial: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). It's a degree 8 polynomial, so I'm probably going to have to factor it into several lower-degree polynomials. Since it's asking for monic polynomials with integer coefficients, I should try to factor it step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the polynomial is a biquadratic, meaning it has even powers only. So, it's similar to \\( y^4 + 3y^2 - 4 \\) if I substitute \\( y = x^4 \\). Maybe I can factor the quartic in terms of \\( y \\) first.\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Hmm, can I factor this quadratic in \\( y \\)?\n\nLooking at \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\), I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Let's see: 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, I can factor it as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Therefore, substituting back, it becomes \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nSo, now the polynomial is factored as \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). That's progress. I can see that \\( x^4 - 1 \\) is a difference of squares, so it can be factored further.\n\nLet me factor \\( x^4 - 1 \\) as \\( (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Therefore, the polynomial becomes \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nSo far, the factors are"

Now, I need to check if these can be factored further over the integers.\n\nStarting with \\( x^2 + 1 \\): over integers, this is irreducible because it doesn't have real roots (discriminant is -4), so it can't be factored into linear terms with real coefficients, let alone integer ones. So that's irreducible.\n\nNext, \\( x^2 - 1 \\): that's a difference of squares, so it factors into \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) \\). So, actually, I can factor that further. So, replacing \\( x^2 - 1 \\), we get \\( (x - 1)(x + 1) \\).\n\nSo now, the factors are \\( x^4 + 4 \\), \\( x - 1 \\), \\( x + 1 \\), and \\( x^2 + 1 \\). Now, check if \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored further.\n\nHmm, \\( x^4 + 4 \\). I recall that \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is a sum of squares, but it can actually be factored using the Sophie Germain identity. Let me recall: the identity is \\( a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2) \\). In this case, if I set \\( b = 1 \\), then \\( x^4 + 4(1)^4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\). Let me check that.\n\nMultiplying out \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\):\n\nFirst, \\( x^2 * x^2 = x^4 \\).\n\nThen, \\( x^2*(-2x) + 2x*x^2 = -2x^3 + 2x^3 = 0 \\).\n\nThen, \\( x^2*2 + 2x*x^2 terms?

So, \\( x^4 +4 = (x^2 + 2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2) \\).\n\nTherefore, now, we can factor \\( x^4 +4 \\) into those two quadratics. So now, the full factorization is:\n\n\\( (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1) \\). So, breaking it down into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients, each non-constant polynomial.\n\nSo, the factors are \\( x -1 \\), \\( x +1 \\), \\( x^2 +1 \\), \\( x^2 +2x +2 \\), and \\( x^2 -2x +2 \\). All of these are irreducible over integers because, for quadratics, the discriminants would be negative or not perfect squares.\n\nFor \\( x^2 +1 \\): discriminant is -4 <0.\n\nFor \\( x^2 +2x +2 \\): discriminant is 4 - 8 ="

Let's compute:\n\n\\( x=1 \\): \\(1^8 +3(1)^4 -4=1 + 3 -4=0\\).\n\nBut when we evaluate each factor at x=1, the sum is 10, but original polynomial is 0. Hmm, but wait, the original polynomial is the product of all the factors. But 10 is the sum of each evaluated factor at 1, not the product.\n\nSo, the product would be 0 because one of the factors is x-1, which is zero at x=1. So, yeah, that aligns.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about plugging x=1 into the original polynomial, we get 0, which is why one of the factors is zero at x=1, which is p1(x)=x-1.\n\nSo, that makes sense.\n\nOkay, so I think my steps are correct, and the answer should be 10.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) factors into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\).
