Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the given polynomial is \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). It's an eighth-degree polynomial, so factoring it into lower-degree polynomials makes sense. Since each factor must be monic and have integer coefficients, I should look for ways to factor it into quadratics, cubics, etc., but all monic and irreducible over integers.\n\nLooking at the polynomial, I notice it resembles something that might be a biquadratic or a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Let me rewrite it: \\( (x^4)^2 + 3(x^4) - 4 \\). Hmm, that looks like a quadratic equation in \\( x^4 \\). Maybe I can factor it like a quadratic.\n\nLet me denote \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\). Let's try to factor this quadratic. The discriminant is \\( 9 + 16 = 25 \\), so the roots are \\( y = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2} \\). That gives \\( y = 1 \\) and \\( y = -4 \\). So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y - 1)(y + 4) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), we get \\( (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4) \\).\n\nOkay, so now the original polynomial factors into \\( (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4) \\). But wait, these might still be reducible. Let me check \\( x^4 - 1 \\) first. I know that \\( x^4 - 1 \\) can be factored further because it's a difference of squares. \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). And \\( x^2 - 1 \\) can be factored further into \\( (x - 1"

That looks like a sum of squares, which usually doesn't factor over the reals, but wait, in integers? No, sum of squares doesn't factor into real polynomials, but maybe it can factor over integers? Let me think. There's a formula for factoring \\( x^4 + 4 \\). It's called the Sophie Germain identity: \\( x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2) \\). In this case, \\( y = 1 \\), so substituting, we get \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nGreat, so now the entire polynomial factors into:\n\n\\( (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nNow, I need to check if each of these factors is irreducible over integers. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. \\( x - 1 \\): Linear, can't be factored further.\n2. \\( x + 1 \\): Similarly linear.\n3. \\( x^2 + 1 \\): Quadratic, discriminant is \\( 0^2 - 4*1*1 = -4 \\), so no real roots, irreducible over integers.\n4. \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\): Discriminant is \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), no real roots, irreducible.\n5. \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\): Same discriminant, \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\), irreducible.\n\nSo, all factors are irreducible. Therefore, the complete factorization is as above.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) \\), where each \\( p_i"

The polynomial \\( x^4 - 1 \\) can be factored as a difference of squares:\n\n\\[ x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\]\n\nFurther factoring \\( x^2 - 1 \\):\n\n\\[ x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) \\]\n\nFor \\( x^4 + 4 \\), we use the Sophie Germain identity:\n\n\\[ x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\]\n\nThus, the complete factorization of the original polynomial is:\n\n\\[ (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\]\n\nEach factor is irreducible over the integers.
