The polynomial has integer coefficients, and the coefficients a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081 are integers. I remember there's something called the Rational Root Theorem that might help here. Let me think about how that works.\n\nFrom what I recall, the Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient. So in this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. That means any rational root must have a numerator that's a factor of 1 and a denominator that's a factor of 2.\n\nAlright, factors of 1 are just \u00b11, right? And factors of 2 are \u00b11 and \u00b12. So possible values for p are 1 and -1, since those are the factors of 1. For q, the factors are 1, 2, -1, and -2. But when we consider the fraction p/q in lowest terms, we usually take the positive q unless p is negative, in which case the denominator might be negative to keep it reduced. Hmm, wait, actually, p and q are co-prime integers. So maybe considering positive denominators and allowing negative numerators is sufficient.\n\nSo if p is \u00b11 and q is \u00b11, \u00b12, but we want p and q to be co-prime. So for p = 1, q can be 1 or 2 because 1 and 2 are co-prime. Similarly, for p = -1, q can be 1 or 2. So let's list all possible p/q:\n\nFor p = 1:\n- 1/1 = 1\n- 1/2\n\nFor p = -1:\n- (-1)/1 = -1\n- (-1)/2 = -1/2\n\nSo are these all the possible rational roots? Let me check if that covers everything. Since the constant term is 1, the factors are limited, so p can only be \u00b11. The leading coefficient is 2, so q can be \u00b11 or \u00b12. But when we write p/q in"

            "output": " simplest terms, denominators can only be 1 or 2, because if the denominator was, say, -1, that's equivalent to -p/1, and since p can be negative, we can represent that with p = -1 and q = 1. Similarly, denominator -2 would be the same as negative numerator over 2. So yeah, in reduced terms, the possible denominators are just 1 and 2. \n\nSo the possible rational roots are indeed \u00b11 and \u00b11/2. That's four possibilities. But the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots. Wait, but maybe there's a catch here? The coefficients a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081 can be any integers. Does that affect the number of possible rational roots?\n\nHmm, well, the Rational Root Theorem says that any rational root has to be among those four, but depending on the coefficients, some of these might not actually be roots. However, the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots that this polynomial could have, given any possible coefficients. So even if not all of them can be roots for every polynomial, the set of possible candidates is still just those four. Since the coefficients can be adjusted to make any of these roots possible, right?\n\nLet me think of an example: Suppose we want 1 to be a root. Then substituting x = 1 into the polynomial gives 2 + a\u2083 + a\u2082 + a\u2081 + 1 = 0. So that equation must be satisfied by some integers a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081. Since they can be any integers, this equation can be satisfied. For instance, set a\u2083 = 0, a\u2082 = 0, a\u2081 = -3, so 2 + 0 + 0 + (-3) +1 = 0. So that works. Similarly for -1: plugging x = -1 into the polynomial gives 2(-1)^4 + a\u2083(-1)^3 +a\u2082(-1)^2 +a\u2081(-1) +1. Which is 2 -a\u2083 +a\u2082 -a\u2081 +1 = 0. So 3 -a\u2083 +a\u2082 -a\u2081 = 0. Again, choosing coefficients that satisfy this is possible, so that's doable.\n\nSimilarly, 1/2: plugging x = 1"

Simplifying, that's 1/8 + (a\u2083)/8 + (a\u2082)/4 + (a\u2081)/2 + 1. Combine terms: 1 + 1/8 + (a\u2083)/8 + (a\u2082)/4 + (a\u2081)/2. Let me set this equal to zero: 1 + 1/8 + (a\u2083)/8 + (a\u2082)/4 + (a\u2081)/2 = 0. Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators: 8 + 1 + a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 + 4a\u2081 = 0. So 9 + a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 +4a\u2081 = 0. Which can be satisfied, for example, by a\u2081 = -2, a\u2082 = 0, a\u2083 = -9: 9 -9 + 0 + (-8) = -8 \u2260 0. Hmm, maybe that's not the right choice. Wait, let me recast the equation: 9 + a\u2083 + 2a\u2082 +4a\u2081 = 0.\n\nWait, maybe choose a\u2081 = -2, a\u2082 = 0, then 9 + a\u2083 + 0 + (-8) = 1 + a\u2083 = 0, so a\u2083 = -1. So the polynomial becomes 2x\u2074 - x\u00b3 + 0x\u00b2 -2x +1. Let's check if x=1/2 is a root: 2*(1/16) - (1/8) + 0 -2*(1/2)+1 = 2/16 - 1/8 -1 +1 = 1/8 -1/8 -1 +1 = 0. Yep, it works.\n\nSimilarly, for -1/2: substitute x = -1/2 into the polynomial: 2*(1/16) + a\u2083*(-1/8) +a\u2082*(1/4) +a\u2081"

So 9 -a\u2083 +2a\u2082 -4a\u2081 = 0. Again, can choose coefficients such that this is satisfied, for example, set a\u2081=1, a\u2082=0, then 9 -a\u2083 +0 -4(1) = 9 -a\u2083 -4 =5 -a\u2083=0. So a\u2083=5. So the polynomial is 2x\u2074 +5x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 +1x +1. Let's check x=-1/2: 2*(1/16) +5*(-1/8) +0 +1*(-1/2)+1= 1/8 -5/8 -1/2 +1. Convert to eighths: 1 -5 -4 +8 =0. So that works too.\n\nSo, it seems like regardless of the coefficients, all four possible rational roots are possible, depending on the values of a\u2083, a\u2082, and a\u2081.\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nSo the answer should be 4.\n</think>\n\nOkay, so using the Rational Root Theorem, we figured out that the possible rational roots are \u00b11 and \u00b11/2. Since we can choose coefficients that make each of these values a root, all four are possible. Therefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Polynomial Structure:**\n   The given polynomial is of the form \\(2x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + 1\\), where \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) are integers.\n\n2. **Apply the Rational Root Theorem:**\n   The Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\), must have:\n   - \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term (1 in this case).\n  "
