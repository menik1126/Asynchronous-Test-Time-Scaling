The polynomial is given by:\n\n\\[2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0.\\]\n\nHmm, okay. I remember something called the Rational Root Theorem, which might help here. Let me recall what that says. The theorem states that any possible rational root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients is of the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nSo in this case, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. That means \\(p\\) can be either 1 or -1 because those are the factors of 1. For \\(q\\), since the leading coefficient is 2, the possible values for \\(q\\) are 1 and 2.\n\nPutting that together, the possible rational roots are:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1}, \\quad \\frac{-1}{1}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{-1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying those, they are 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2. So that gives us four possible rational roots.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The polynomial is a quartic, so it can have up to four roots, but the question is about possible rational roots, not necessarily how many there are. The theorem doesn't restrict the number, only the form. So yeah, regardless of the coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\), as long as they are integers, the possible rational roots are limited to those four options.\n\nI don't think I'm missing any other factors. The constant term is 1, so \\(p\\) can only be ±1, and the leading coefficient is 2, so \\(q\\) can be ±1 or ±2. But when considering positive and negative, we already accounted for that by including both 1 and -1 for \\(p\\), and 1 and 2 for \\(q\\). So the possible roots are indeed 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other"

            "output": " factors. For instance, could \\(p\\) be a fraction with denominators other than 1? But no, because factors of 1 are only ±1. And factors of the leading coefficient (2) are 1 and 2, so the denominators can only be 1 or 2. \n\nTherefore, the four possibilities are all. But let me see if the problem is asking for distinct possible rational roots, so even if some might not actually be roots depending on the coefficients, but the question is asking for different possible ones, so the count is still 4. \n\nWait, the question says \"number of different possible rational roots\", so possible meaning that each of these could be a root for some choice of coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_1\\). So I need to make sure that each of these four can actually be roots for some polynomial of the given form. Let me check if that's necessarily the case.\n\nFor example, take 1: Let's see if there exists coefficients such that 1 is a root. Plug x=1 into the polynomial:\n\n2(1)^4 + a_3(1)^3 + a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) +1 = 0\n=> 2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 +1 = 0\n=> a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = -3. \n\nYes, since the coefficients are integers, we can choose any integers a_3, a_2, a_1 that add up to -3. For example, set a_3 = 0, a_2 = 0, a_1 = -3. So that's possible. Therefore, 1 can be a rational root.\n\nSimilarly, check -1. Plug x=-1:\n\n2(-1)^4 + a_3(-1)^3 + a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) +1 =0\n= 2(1) + a_3(-1) + a_2(1) + a_1(-1) +1\n= 2 -a_3 + a_2 - a_1 +1 =0\n=> -a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = -3\nSo, coefficients such as a_3=0, a_2=0,"

            "output": " a_1=3 would satisfy. So yes, x=-1 can be a root.\n\nNow, 1/2 as a root. Plug x=1/2:\n\n2*(1/2)^4 + a_3*(1/2)^3 + a_2*(1/2)^2 + a_1*(1/2) +1 = 0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\n\na_3*(1/8) = a_3/8\n\na_2*(1/4) = a_2/4\n\na_1*(1/2) = a_1/2\n\nSo combine:\n\n1/8 + a_3/8 + a_2/4 + a_1/2 +1 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a_3 + 2a_2 + 4a_1 +8 =0\n\nSimplify:\n\na_3 + 2a_2 +4a_1 = -9\n\nWe need integers a_3, a_2, a_1 such that a_3 +2a_2 +4a_1 = -9\n\nPossible? Let's see. For example, set a_1= -2, then 4a_1 = -8, so remaining is a_3 +2a_2 = -1. Set a_2 =0, so a_3 = -1. So coefficients a_3=-1, a_2=0, a_1=-2. Then plug into the equation:\n\n-1 +0 +4*(-2) = -1 -8 = -9. Yes, that works. So x=1/2 can be a root.\n\nSimilarly, check x=-1/2:\n\n2*(-1/2)^4 + a_3*(-1/2)^3 + a_2*(-1/2)^2 + a_1*(-1/2) +1 =0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*(1/16) =1/8\n\na_3*(-1/8) =-a_3/8\n\na_2*(1/4) = a_2/4\n\na_1*(-1/2) = -a_1/2\n\nSo total:\n\n1/8 -a_3/8 + a_2"

Let's see.\n\nLet me set a_1=1, so 4a_1=4. Then the equation becomes a_3 -2a_2 =5. Let me choose a_2=0, so a_3=5. So coefficients a_3=5, a_2=0, a_1=1. Then 5 -0 +4=9. So yes, this works. So x=-1/2 can also be a root.\n\nHence, all four possibilities (1, -1, 1/2, -1/2) can indeed be rational roots for some choices of the coefficients. Therefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered each possibility, checked if they can be roots by choosing appropriate coefficients, and confirmed that yes, each can be a root. So the answer should be 4.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial has integer coefficients, and by the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nEach possible root can be achieved with suitable integer coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\). Thus, there are 4 different possible rational roots.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
