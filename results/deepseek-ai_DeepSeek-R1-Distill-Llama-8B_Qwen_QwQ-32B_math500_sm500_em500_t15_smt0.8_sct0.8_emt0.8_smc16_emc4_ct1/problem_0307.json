            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote for the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). Then, add the values of a, b, and c together for the sum a + b + c.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator and find its roots.\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic: x² - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring it. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see: the factors of 14 are 1 and 14, 2 and 7. If I take -7 and +2, because (-7) * 2 = -14 and (-7) + 2 = -5. So, yes, it factors to (x - 7)(x + 2). That means the denominator is zero when x - 7 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, so x = 7 and x = -2. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = 7 and x = -2. So, a = -2 and b = 7, or vice versa, but the order doesn't matter since we just need their values.\n\nNow, for the horizontal asymptote. There's a rule for rational functions where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If the degrees are equal, it's y = the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nLooking at f(x), the numerator is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x² -5x -14, which is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote will be y = 0. So, c = 0.\n\nTherefore, adding them together: a + b + c. Since a and b are the vertical asymptotes, -2 and 7, and c is 0, the sum is (-2) + 7 + 0. That adds up to 5.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should double-check the denominator factoring. Let me expand (x - 7)(x + 2). x * x is x²"

            "output": ", x * 2 is 2x, -7 * x is -7x, and -7 * 2 is -14. So combining the middle terms: 2x -7x = -5x. So yes, that gives x² -5x -14. So that's correct.\n\nAlso, confirming the horizontal asymptote. Since the numerator's degree is 1 and denominator's is 2, the horizontal asymptote is indeed y = 0. So, c is 0. So adding them: -2 +7 is 5, plus 0 is 5. So the answer should be 5. \n\nHmm, but let me check if the question specifies the order of a and b. The problem says vertical asymptotes are x=a and x=b. Since they are just two numbers, the order doesn't matter. So a and b are -2 and 7, so their sum is 5, plus c=0 gives 5. \n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes here. So the final answer is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), we need to determine where the denominator is zero. The denominator is the quadratic expression \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\). Factoring this quadratic, we look for two numbers that multiply to \\(-14\\) and add to \\(-5\\). These numbers are \\(-7\\) and \\(2\\), so the quadratic factors as \\( (x - 7)(x + 2) \\). Setting each factor equal to zero gives the roots \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\), so \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nNext, we determine the horizontal asymptote. The degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2). When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Thus, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nAdding the values \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c"
