Since \\(2^8 = 256\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the power of a power rule: \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\). This simplifies the equation to \\(2^{2x} = 2^{4}\\).\n\nNow, since the bases are the same and the equation holds true, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a Power of 2**:\n   \n   Recognize that 256 is a power of 2:\n   \\[\n   256 = 2^8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Rewrite the Equation**:\n   \n   Substitute \\(256\\) with \\(2^8\\) in the original equation:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Apply the Power of a Power Rule**:\n   \n   Use the property \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\):\n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Set the Exponents Equal to Each Other**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Solve for \\(x\\)**:\n   \n   Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{"
