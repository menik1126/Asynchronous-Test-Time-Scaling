This can be written as the equation:\n\n10T = 3S + G\n\nFrom the second statement, two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This gives the second equation:\n\n2T + G = S\n\nNow, I'll use these equations to solve for the variables.\n\nFirst, I can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate S.\n\nSubstituting S = 2T + G into the first equation:\n\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G\n10T = 6T + 3G + G\n10T = 6T + 4G\n10T - 6T = 4G\n4T = 4G\nT = G\n\nThis shows that one treek equals one goolee in weight.\n\nNext, I'll substitute T with G in the second equation to find S.\n\nSince T = G, the equation becomes:\n\n2G + G = S\n3G = S\n\nThis means that one squig equals three treeks in weight.\n\nFinally, to determine how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, I'll set up the equation:\n\n3T = S\n\nSubstituting T with G gives:\n\n3G = S\n\nTherefore, three treeks equal the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Step 1:** Translate the first statement into an equation.\n\\[ 10T = 3S + G \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Translate the second statement into another equation.\n\\[ 2T + G = S \\]\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute \\( S \\)"
