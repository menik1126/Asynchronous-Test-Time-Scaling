            "output": "First, I assign variables to the weights of each item to make it easier to work with the equations.\n\nLet T represent the weight of one treek, S for one squig, and G for one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, I know that 10 treeks weigh as much as 3 squigs and 1 goolee. So, I can write the equation 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement tells me that 2 treeks and 1 goolee equal the weight of 1 squig. This gives me the equation 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I can use substitution to solve for S. From the second equation, I'll solve for G: G = S - 2T. Then, I'll substitute G back into the first equation: 10T = 3S + (S - 2T).\n\nSimplifying that, I get 10T = 4S - 2T. Adding 2T to both sides gives 12T = 4S. Dividing both sides by 4, I find that T = S/3.\n\nThis means that one treek weighs one-third of a squig. Therefore, three treeks would weigh 3 * (S/3) = S. So, three treeks equal the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find out how many treeks equal the weight of one squig.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Variables**\n\nLet:\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Given Information into Equations**\n\n1. **First Statement:**\n   - \"Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\"\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Statement:**\n   - \"Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\"\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**\n\nFrom **Equation 2**, we can express \\( G \\) in terms of"
