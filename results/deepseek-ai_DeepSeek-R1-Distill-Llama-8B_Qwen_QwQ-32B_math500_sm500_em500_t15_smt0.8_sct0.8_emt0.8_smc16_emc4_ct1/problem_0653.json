            "output": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a quadratic polynomial P(x) with real coefficients. The problem states that for all real numbers x, the value of P(x) is bounded between two other quadratics: x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3. Additionally, we know that P(11) = 181, and we need to find P(16).\n\nFirst, I remember that two quadratic polynomials will be related in a specific way if one is always between the other two. Since both given inequalities are for all real x, this suggests that P(x) is squeezed between these two quadratics. So, P(x) can't exceed the upper quadratic or dip below the lower one.\n\nLet me write down the inequalities:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nQuadratic polynomials can be compared by their coefficients. Let's denote P(x) as ax² + bx + c. Then, the inequalities become:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ ax² + bx + c ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nSince this is true for all real x, the coefficients of the corresponding powers of x must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nLet me subtract the lower quadratic from the upper quadratic. The difference is:\n\n2x² - 4x + 3 - (x² - 2x + 2) = x² - 2x + 1.\n\nSo, 2x² - 4x + 3 - x² + 2x - 2 = x² - 2x + 1.\n\nWait, that's equal to (x - 1)^2, which is a perfect square and always non-negative. That makes sense because P(x) is between these two quadratics, so their difference is non-negative for all x.\n\nBut how does that help me find P(x)? Hmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider that P(x) lies between these two quadratics, so P(x) must satisfy both inequalities. Since P(x) is a quadratic, let me express it as ax² + bx + c. Then:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ ax² + bx + c ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nThis gives two separate inequalities:\n\n"
