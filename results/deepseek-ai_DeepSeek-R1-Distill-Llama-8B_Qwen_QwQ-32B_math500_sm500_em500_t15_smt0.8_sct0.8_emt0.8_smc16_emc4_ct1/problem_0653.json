Let me read it again carefully.\n\n\"Let \\( P(x) \\) be a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients satisfying \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\le P(x) \\le 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\), and suppose \\( P(11) = 181 \\). Find \\( P(16) \\).\"\n\nOkay, so \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic, which means it has degree 2. Quadratic polynomials have the general form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are real coefficients that we can determine.\n\nThe problem gives me two inequalities that bound \\( P(x) \\) from below and above for all real \\( x \\). Also, it gives me the value of \\( P(11) = 181 \\). My goal is to find \\( P(16) \\).\n\nLet me start by analyzing the inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\le P(x) \\). So \\( P(x) \\) is always greater than or equal to \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\).\n\nSecond inequality: \\( P(x) \\le 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\). So \\( P(x) \\) is always less than or equal to \\( 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\).\n\nSince both these inequalities hold for all real \\( x \\), it suggests that \\( P(x) \\) is squeezed between these two quadratics. Therefore, perhaps \\( P(x) \\) coincides with one of these quadratics or is in between them. But given that \\( P(x) \\) must satisfy both inequalities for all \\( x \\), maybe \\( P(x) \\) is exactly equal to both for some specific \\( x \\), which could help me determine the coefficients.\n\nWait, actually, I might be able to consider that \\( P(x) \\) must lie between these two quadratics everywhere, so perhaps the difference between them is non-negative or non-positive?\n\nLet me consider the difference between the upper bound and the lower bound.\n\nUpper bound: \\( 2x^2 -4x +3 \\)\nLower bound: \\( x^"

Therefore, \\( 2x^2 -4x +3 \\ge x^2 -2x +2 \\) for all real \\( x \\).\n\nThis tells me that the upper bound is always above the lower bound, which is required for \\( P(x) \\) to exist in between. So, \\( P(x) \\) must lie between these two, but not crossing either.\n\nBut how does that help me find \\( P(x) \\)? Maybe \\( P(x) \\) is equal to the lower bound or upper bound at certain points, but not sure yet.\n\nWait, another thought: since \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic, if I subtract the lower bound from \\( P(x) \\) and the upper bound from \\( P(x) \\), these differences must be non-positive and non-negative, respectively, for all \\( x \\).\n\nSo, let's write \\( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\nThen, the inequality \\( x^2 -2x +2 \\le P(x) \\) can be written as:\n\n\\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\le ax^2 + bx + c \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nSimilarly, the inequality \\( P(x) \\le 2x^2 -4x +3 \\) can be written as:\n\n\\( ax^2 + bx + c \\le 2x^2 -4x +3 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nLet me rearrange the first inequality:\n\n\\( (a - 1)x^2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) \\ge 0 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nSimilarly, for the second inequality:\n\n\\( (2 - a)x^2 + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) \\ge 0 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nSince both quadratic expressions must be non-negative for all real \\( x \\), that means each quadratic must be a perfect square or have a discrimin"

The leading coefficient \\( d \\ge 0 \\).\n2. The discriminant \\( e^2 - 4df \\le 0 \\).\n\nBecause if the discriminant is non-positive, the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis, and if the leading coefficient is positive, the parabola opens upwards, hence it's always non-negative.\n\nSo, applying this to both inequalities.\n\nFirst, from \\( x^2 -2x +2 \\le P(x) \\), which is:\n\n\\( (a -1)x^2 + (b + 2)x + (c -2) \\ge 0 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n1. \\( a -1 \\ge 0 \\) ⇒ \\( a \\ge 1 \\).\n2.

Since \\( a \\) is bounded between 1 and 2, maybe \\( a \\) can be uniquely determined, then I can solve for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\nBut this might not be straightforward. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe \\( P(x) \\) is the same as either the lower or the upper bound at certain points, but because it's squeezed, perhaps it has to coincide with both? That might happen only if the lower and upper bounds coincide, which would require their difference to be zero, but in this case, the difference is \\( (x -1)^2 \\), which is only zero at \\( x =1 \\). So at \\( x=1 \\), both bounds are equal, and so \\( P(1) = 1^2 -2(1)+2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1, or 2(1)^2 -4(1)+3 = 2 -4 +3 =1. So P(1) =1.\n\nTherefore, at x=1, both the lower and upper bound are equal to 1, so P(1)=1.\n\nWait, that's a point where both bounds meet. So, maybe P(x) is equal to that at x=1.\n\nSo, perhaps P(1) =1.\n\nIs that necessarily true? Hmm.\n\nBecause for all real x, \\( x^2 -2x +2 \\le P(x) \\le 2x^2 -4x +3 \\). At x=1, both the lower and upper bounds equal 1, so P(1) must be equal to 1.\n\nThat seems right.\n\nSo that's another equation: \\( a(1)^2 + b(1) + c =1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( a + b + c =1 \\).\n\nSo far, I have:\n\n1. \\( 121a +11b + c =181 \\) (from P(11)=181)\n2. \\( a + b + c =1 \\) (from P(1)=1)\n3.
