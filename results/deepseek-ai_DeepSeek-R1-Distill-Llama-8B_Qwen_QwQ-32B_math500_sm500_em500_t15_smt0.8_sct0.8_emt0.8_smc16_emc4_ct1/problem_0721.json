Let me write down what's given and then figure out how to approach it.\n\nSo, the problem is:\n\nIf log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then find x.\n\nHmm, that's a bit to unpack. Let's break it down. There are two logarithmic equations here, and I need to find the value of x. I remember that logarithms have certain properties that can help simplify equations, so maybe I can use those.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations as they are given:\n\n1. log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2\n2. log\u1d67(5x) = 2\n\nI need to find x, but I also have y in the equations, so I probably need to figure out y as well. Let me start with the second equation because it seems simpler or maybe I can express y in terms of x or vice versa.\n\nStarting with equation 2: log\u1d67(5x) = 2.\n\nI know that log\u1d67(a) = b is equivalent to y\u1d47 = a. So, applying that here, y\u00b2 = 5x. Let me write that:\n\ny\u00b2 = 5x.  [Equation 3]\n\nThat's helpful because now I have y squared in terms of x. Maybe I can use this later. Now, let's go back to equation 1. Let me write it again:\n\nlog\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2.\n\nI remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So, log\u2086(A) + log\u2086(B) = log\u2086(A \u00d7 B).\n\nApplying that property here, I can rewrite equation 1 as:\n\nlog\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nNow, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, so that equals x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. So, the equation becomes:\n\nlog\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2.\n\nThat's a"

So:\n\n6\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\nCalculating 6 squared, that's 36. So:\n\nx\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36.  [Equation 4]\n\nNow, from equation 3, we have y\u00b2 = 5x. Let me substitute that into equation 4. Since y\u00b2 is 5x, then equation 4 becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - (5x) = 36.\n\nSimplifying that:\n\nx\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nOkay, so now I have a quadratic equation in terms of x. Let me write that again:\n\nx\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it. To factor x\u00b2 -5x -36, I need two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6. Let me see:\n\nLooking for two numbers whose product is -36 and sum is -5. Let's see:\n\nIf one is positive and the other is negative. Let's try 4 and -9: 4 * (-9) = -36, and 4 + (-9) = -5. Yes! That works.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx + 4 = 0 => x = -4,\n\nx - 9 = 0 => x = 9.\n\nSo, the solutions are x = -4 or x = 9.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if these solutions are valid in the original logarithmic equations. Because logarithms have domain restrictions. The arguments of the logarithms must be positive. Let me check both solutions.\n\nFirst, let's check x = -4.\n\nIf x = -4, then from equation 3, y\u00b2 = 5*(-4) = -20. But y squared can't be negative, so that's impossible. So x = -4"

            "output": " is not a valid solution. We can discard it.\n\nNow, let's check x = 9.\n\nIf x = 9, then y\u00b2 = 5*9 = 45. So y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But since y is inside the logarithm in equation 1, it's the base of a logarithm in equation 2, so y must be positive and not equal to 1.\n\nWait, y is the base of the logarithm in equation 2, so y must be positive and y \u2260 1.\n\nSo, let's compute y:\n\ny\u00b2 = 45 => y = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5) \u2248 6.708 or y = -sqrt(45). But since y must be positive, we take y = 3\u221a5.\n\nNow, let's check equation 1 with x = 9 and y = 3\u221a5.\n\nWe need to make sure that (x - y) and (x + y) are positive.\n\nCompute x - y: 9 - 3\u221a5 \u2248 9 - 6.708 \u2248 2.292 > 0.\n\nCompute x + y: 9 + 3\u221a5 \u2248 9 + 6.708 \u2248 15.708 > 0.\n\nOkay, both are positive, so the logarithms are defined. Therefore, x = 9 is a valid solution.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that equation 1 is satisfied. So let's compute log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) and see if it equals 2.\n\nWe can compute (x - y)(x + y) = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. We already know from equation 4 that this equals 36, so log\u2086(36) = log base 6 of 6\u00b2 = 2, which matches the given equation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by using the properties of logarithms to simplify the equations.\n\n1. From the second equation, log\u1d67(5x) = 2, we convert it to exponential form to find y\u00b2 = 5x.\n2. Substitute y\u00b2 = 5x into the first equation, simplifying it to a quadratic in x.\n3.
