Hmm, let's break this problem down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the points of tangency on two curves where they share a common tangent are points where both curves share the same tangent line. So, to find these points, I should find the equations of the common tangents to both the circle and the parabola.\n\nI know that for a circle, the equation of a tangent can be written in the form \\( y = mx + c \\), where \\( c \\) is related to the radius and the point of contact. For a parabola, the tangent can also be written in a similar form, but maybe with a different relation. So, maybe I can find the condition that these lines are tangent to both the circle and the parabola.\n\nLet me start with the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\). The condition for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be tangent to this circle is that the distance from the center (which is at (0,0)) to the line is equal to the radius. The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line \\( ax + by + c = 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{|ax0 + by0 + c|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \\).\n\nSo, rewriting \\( y = mx + c \\) in standard form, it's \\( mx - y + c = 0 \\). Therefore, the distance from (0,0) to this line is \\( \\frac{|0 - 0 + c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}}} = \\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} \\). Since the radius is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), this distance must equal \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). So,\n\n\\( \\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n\\( \\frac{c^2}{m^2 + 1} = 2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( c^2 = "

So, let's find the condition for this line to be tangent to the parabola.\n\nI recall that the condition for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be tangent to the parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\) is \\( c = a/m \\). Wait, but in our case, the parabola is \\( y^2 = 8x \\), which can be written as \\( y^2 = 4a x \\) with \\( a = 2 \\). So, the condition becomes \\( c = 2/m \\).\n\nSo, we have from the circle's condition \\( c = \\pm \\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)} \\) and from the parabola's condition \\( c = 2/m \\).\n\nTherefore, we can set these equal to each other:\n\n\\( \\pm \\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)} = \\frac{2}{m} \\).\n\nSince the problem states there are two common tangents, but in this case, considering both upper and lower tangents, maybe there are four points, but for the area, the quadrilateral might be a rectangle or something symmetric.\n\nLet me consider the positive case first:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)} = \\frac{2}{m} \\).\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\( 2(m^2 + 1) = \\frac{4}{m^2} \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( m^2 \\):\n\n\\( 2m^4 + 2m^2 = 4 \\).\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( 2m^4 + 2m^2 - 4 = 0 \\).\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( m^4 + m^2 - 2 = 0 \\).\n\nThis is a quartic equation, but maybe I can substitute \\( n = m^2 \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\( n^2 + n - 2 = 0 \\).\n\nSolving this quadratic in n:\n\n\\( n = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{"

Therefore, \\( m \\) must be positive.\n\nSo, \\( m = 1 \\) is valid, and \\( m = -1 \\) would give \\( c = 2/(-1) = -2 \\), but from the circle's condition, when m = -1, c would be \\( \\pm \\sqrt{2(1 + 1)} = \\pm \\sqrt{4} = \\pm 2 \\). So, if m = -1 and c = -2, let's check if the line is tangent to both.\n\nWait, so maybe we should consider both positive and negative c, but let's see.\n\nWait, the equation came from when I took the positive square root, so for m positive, c = 2/m. But if m were negative, then 2/m would be negative, but \\( \\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)} \\) is always positive. So, actually, in the case where m is negative, c would have to be negative. So, perhaps I should also take the negative square root when considering m negative.\n\nWait, perhaps I should treat both cases.\n\nLet me redo the equation:\n\nFrom the circle: \\( c = \\pm \\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)} \\).\n\nFrom the parabola: \\( c = 2/m \\).\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\nCase 1: \\( \\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)} = 2/m \\).\n\nCase 2: \\( -\\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)} = 2/m \\).\n\nSo, in both cases, we can square.\n\nLet's do Case 1 first.\n\nCase 1:\n\n\\( \\sqrt"

Therefore, m=1.\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2:\n\n\\( -\\sqrt{2(m^2 +1)} = 2/m \\).\n\nHere, the LHS is negative, so RHS must also be negative. Therefore, 2/m <0, so m <0.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\( 2(m^2 +1) = 4/m^2 \\).\n\nSame equation as before, so m^4 + m^2 -2 =0, so m^2=1, so m=-1 (since m must be negative here).\n\nTherefore, the two possible slopes are m=1 and m=-1.\n\nWait, but that gives only two slopes. But the problem says there are two common tangents, forming four points of tangency. Hmm, so each tangent line touches both the circle and the parabola at one point each, so two lines, each with two points of tangency (one on the circle and one on the parabola). But the problem says four points of tangency, so maybe each tangent line has two points? Wait, no, each tangent line is tangent to both curves, so each line is tangent to the circle at one point and tangent to the parabola at another point. So two lines, each with two points (one on each curve), so total four points. So the quadrilateral is formed by these four points.\n\nTherefore, the four points are two points on the circle and two points on the parabola, connected by the tangent lines. Wait, but the problem says \"forming four points of tangency\", so maybe each tangent line has two points?

Wait, but in the Asy code, they draw lines from A to C and from B to D, which are vertical lines, but I think those might be the common tangents.\n\nWait, in the Asy code, the points A, B, C, D are plotting the tangent points. So A is (-1,1), which is on the circle, because (-1)^2 +1^2=2, so it's on x^2+y^2=2. B is (2,4), but 2^2 +4^2=4+16=20, which isn't 2, so that can't be on the circle.

For the parabola y^2=8x, substituting x=-1 gives y^2 = -8, which is impossible, so the line x=-1 is not tangent to the parabola. Wait, that contradicts the Asy code's drawing.
