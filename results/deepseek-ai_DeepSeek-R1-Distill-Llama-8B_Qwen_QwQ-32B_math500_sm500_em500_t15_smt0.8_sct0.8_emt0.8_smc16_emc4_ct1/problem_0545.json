Looking at the chart, Spain is represented by the price 6 cents.\n\nNext, I'll find the total cost by multiplying the number of Spain stamps by their price: 6 cents multiplied by the number of Spain stamps in the 70s.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify the exact number of stamps for Spain in the 70s, I can't calculate the exact average price without this information. Therefore, the average price of the 70s stamps can't be determined with the given data.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Decade and Countries:**\n   - **Decade:** 70s\n   - **Countries:** Brazil, France, Peru, Spain\n\n2. **Locate the Prices for the 70s:**\n   - From the chart:\n     - **Brazil (70s):** 12 cents\n     - **France (70s):** 12 cents\n     - **Peru (70s):** 12 cents\n     - **Spain (70s):** 6 cents\n\n3. **Identify the Number of Stamps for Each Country in the 70s:**\n   - The chart shows:\n     - **Brazil (70s):** 12 stamps\n     - **France (70s):** 12 stamps\n     - **Peru (70s):** 12 stamps\n     - **Spain (70s):** 6 stamps\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total 70s Stamps} = \\text{Brazil (70s)} + \\text{France (70s)} + \\text{Peru (70s)} + \\text{Spain (70s)} = 12 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 42 \\text{ stamps}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Cost of 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost of 70s Stamps} = \\text{Cost (Brazil)} \\times \\text{Number (Brazil)} + \\text{Cost (France)} \\times \\text{Number (France)} + \\text{Cost (Peru)} \\times \\text{"
