Under this row, there are five entries: 12, 12, 6, and 13. These represent the prices of the stamps issued in the 1970s, each corresponding to a different country.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total number of stamps by adding up all the stamps in the 70s. There are four stamps with prices: two at 12 cents, one at 6 cents, and one at 13 cents. Adding these together gives a total of 4 stamps.\n\nThen, I'll compute the total cost by multiplying each stamp's price by the number of stamps at that price and summing those amounts. The calculations are as follows:\n- Two stamps at 12 cents: 2 * 12 = 24 cents\n- One stamp at 6 cents: 1 * 6 = 6 cents\n- One stamp at 13 cents: 1 * 13 = 13 cents\n\nAdding these, the total cost is 24 + 6 + 13 = 43 cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the total number of stamps: 43 cents / 4 stamps = 10.75 cents. Rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent, the average price is 10.8 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices of the 70s Stamps:**\n   - **12 cents**\n   - **12 cents**\n   - **6 cents**\n   - **13 cents**\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   2 \\ (\\text{from 12c}) + 1 \\ (\\text{from 12c}) + 1 \\ (\\text{from 6c}) + 1 \\ (\\text{from 13c}) = 5 \\ \\text{stamps}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost of the 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   (2 \\times 12) + (1 \\times 12) + (1 \\times 6) + (1 \\times 13) = 24 + 12 +"

Let me recheck the numbers. The problem states the prices for Brazil and France are 6 cents each, Peru is 4 cents, and Spain is 5 cents. The numbers in the 70s row (12, 12, 6, 13) correspond to Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain. \n\nWait, the columns are labeled as follows:\n- Row 3.5 (Brazil): 12\n- Row 2.5 (France): 12\n- Row 1.5 (Peru): 6\n- Row 0.5 (Spain): 13\n\nEach of these numbers is the count of stamps from that country in the 70s. The price per stamp depends on the country:\n- Brazil: 6 cents each\n- France: 6 cents each\n- Peru: 4 cents each\n- Spain: 5 cents each\n\nSo, recalculate:\n\n1. **Total Number of 70s Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   12 \\ (\\text{Brazil}) + 12 \\ (\\text{France}) + 6 \\ (\\text{Peru}) + 13 \\ (\\text{Spain}) = 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \\ \\text{stamps}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Total Cost:**\n   \\[\n   (12 \\times 6) + (12 \\times 6) + (6 \\times 4) + (13 \\times 5)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 72 + 72 = 144; \\ 144 + 24 = 168; \\ 168 + 65 = 233 \\ \\text{cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Average Price:**\n   \\"
