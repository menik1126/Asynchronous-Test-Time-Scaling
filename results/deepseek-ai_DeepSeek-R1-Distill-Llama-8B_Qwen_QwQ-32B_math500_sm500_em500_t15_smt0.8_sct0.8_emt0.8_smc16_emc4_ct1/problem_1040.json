I need to find the number of different possible rational roots this polynomial can have.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me recall what it says. Oh right, the Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, p and q are integers, p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nSo, in this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. Therefore, according to the theorem, the possible values of p are the factors of 1, which are \u00b11, and the possible values of q are the factors of 2, which are \u00b11 and \u00b12.\n\nSo, the possible rational roots are p/q, which in this case are:\n\nFor p = 1:\n- 1/1 = 1\n- 1/(-1) = -1\n- 1/2\n- 1/(-2) = -1/2\n\nFor p = -1:\n- (-1)/1 = -1\n- (-1)/(-1) = 1\n- (-1)/2 = -1/2\n- (-1)/(-2) = 1/2\n\nWait, but these are the same as before, just duplicates. So, when we consider p = \u00b11 and q = \u00b11, \u00b12, the possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b11/2.\n\nSo, listing them out: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 distinct possible rational roots.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything. The polynomial is of degree 4, so it can have up to 4 roots, but those roots don't have to be rational, right? So, we're only asked about the possible rational roots, not necessarily the actual ones.\n\nAnd according to the Rational Root Theorem, these are all the possible candidates. So, yes, 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That's four different possible rational roots.\n\nI don't think I'm forgetting any factor. The constant"

            "output": " term is 1, so its factors are only \u00b11, and the leading coefficient is 2, so factors are \u00b11, \u00b12. So, the possible p/q combinations are indeed those four.\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4. So the answer should be 4, which in boxed form is \\boxed{4}.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. The question says \"the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial\". But does the polynomial's coefficients being integers affect anything else?\n\nWait, the coefficients a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081 can be any integers, so the polynomial can have any of these roots depending on the coefficients. So, for example, if the polynomial is 2x\u2074 + ... +1, then if 1 is a root, plugging in x=1 would give 2 + a\u2083 + a\u2082 + a\u2081 +1 =0, so a\u2083 +a\u2082 +a\u2081 = -3. Since a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081 are integers, that's possible. Similarly for the other roots. So each of these four roots is possible for some choice of coefficients. Therefore, all four are possible, so the number is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where one of them can't be a root? Let me test with an example.\n\nSuppose we want to see if 1 can be a root. Let's set up the polynomial with x=1 as a root. Then 2(1)^4 + a\u2083(1)^3 + a\u2082(1)^2 + a\u2081(1) +1 =0 \u21d2 2 + a\u2083 + a\u2082 + a\u2081 +1 =0 \u21d2 a\u2083 +a\u2082 +a\u2081 = -3. Since the coefficients can be any integers, we can choose a\u2083, a\u2082, a\u2081 such that their sum is -3. For example, set a\u2083=0, a\u2082=0, a\u2081=-3. So the polynomial would be 2x\u2074 -3x +1. Then plugging in x=1 gives 2 -3 +1 =0, so yes, 1 is a root. So that works.\n\nSimilarly, let's check -1. Plugging in x=-1: 2(-1)^4 + a\u2083(-1)^"
