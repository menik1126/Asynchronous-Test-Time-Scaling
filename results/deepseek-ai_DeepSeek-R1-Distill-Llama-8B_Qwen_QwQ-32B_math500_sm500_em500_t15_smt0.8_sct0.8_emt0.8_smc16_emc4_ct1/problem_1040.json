So, the polynomial is given by:\n\n\\[2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0.\\]\n\nHmm, okay. I remember that for polynomials with integer coefficients, there's something called the Rational Root Theorem. I think that theorem helps in finding all possible rational roots. Let me recall what it says.\n\nI believe the Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction p/q, has p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient. Yeah, that sounds right. So, in this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2.\n\nAlright, so for the constant term, 1, the possible values for p are the factors of 1. Well, 1 has only one factor, which is 1 itself. So, p can be either 1 or -1 because when considering integer factors, negative numbers are also included.\n\nNow, looking at the leading coefficient, which is 2, the possible values for q are the factors of 2. The factors of 2 are 1, 2. So, q can be 1 or 2.\n\nWait, but in the Rational Root Theorem, we consider p over q as possible roots. So, let me list out all possible combinations of p and q.\n\nFirst, p = 1:\n- When q = 1, the possible root is 1/1 = 1.\n- When q = 2, the possible root is 1/2.\n\nNext, p = -1:\n- When q = 1, the possible root is -1/1 = -1.\n- When q = 2, the possible root is -1/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the possible rational roots are 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2. Let me count them: that's four different possible rational roots.\n\nWait a second, I should make sure I haven't missed any. The constant term is 1, so its factors are indeed 1 and -1. The leading coefficient is 2, so its factors are 1 and 2. Therefore, all possible fractions are ±1"

            "output": " over 1 or 2. That gives exactly four possibilities. \n\nBut hold on, the question says \"different possible rational roots\". Since all four of these are distinct, that should be the total. Let me just confirm once again.\n\nYes, 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2 are all different from each other. So, the number of different possible rational roots is 4. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake here? Let me think. The polynomial is of degree 4, but the question is just asking for the number of possible rational roots, not the actual roots. Since the coefficients a3, a2, a1 can be any integers, the possible rational roots are just the ones given by the theorem. Even if some of them might not be roots depending on the coefficients, the question is asking for the number of different possible ones, so all four are possible depending on the coefficients. \n\nFor example, if the polynomial had 1 as a root, then plugging in x=1 would give 2(1)^4 + a3(1)^3 + a2(1)^2 + a1(1) +1 = 0. That simplifies to 2 + a3 + a2 + a1 +1 =0, so a3 + a2 + a1 = -3. Since a3, a2, a1 are integers, this is possible. Similarly, for x=-1, plugging in would give 2(-1)^4 + a3(-1)^3 + a2(-1)^2 + a1(-1) +1 = 0. That's 2 -a3 + a2 -a1 +1 =0, so -a3 -a1 = -3 - (2+1)? Wait, let me recalculate that:\n\nWait, 2(-1)^4 is 2*1 =2, a3*(-1)^3 is -a3, a2*(-1)^2 is a2*1 =a2, a1*(-1) is -a1, and the constant term is 1. So altogether, 2 -a3 +a2 -a1 +1 =0. So combining constants: 2+1=3, so 3 -a3 +a2 -a1 =0. So rearranged, -a3 -a1 = -3"

            "output": " -a2. But since a2 is an integer, this equation is also possible by choosing appropriate integer values for a3 and a1.\n\nSimilarly, for x=1/2: Let's plug into the polynomial. 2*(1/2)^4 + a3*(1/2)^3 + a2*(1/2)^2 + a1*(1/2) +1. Calculating each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8,\na3*(1/8),\na2*(1/4),\na1*(1/2),\nplus 1.\n\nSo the total would be 1/8 + (a3)/8 + (a2)/4 + (a1)/2 +1. To get zero, we have 1 + [1/8 + a3/8 + a2/4 + a1/2] =0.\n\nSo 1 + sum of terms in the brackets =0. So the sum of the terms in the brackets must be -1. Let me write it as:\n\n1/8 + a3/8 + a2/4 + a1/2 = -1.\n\nMultiply all terms by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a3 + 2a2 + 4a1 = -8.\n\nSo, a3 + 2a2 +4a1 = -9. Since a3, a2, a1 are integers, we can choose them to satisfy this equation. For example, let’s pick a3=1, then 1 +2a2 +4a1 =-9. So 2a2 +4a1 = -10. Simplify by dividing by 2: a2 + 2a1 = -5. So we can set a2=-5, a1=0, then it works. So yes, x=1/2 is a possible root.\n\nSimilarly, for x=-1/2:\n\nPlugging in, 2*(-1/2)^4 + a3*(-1/2)^3 + a2*(-1/2)^2 + a1*(-1/2) +1.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n2*(1/16)=1/8,\na3*(-1/8)=-a3/8,\na2*(1/4)=a2/4,\na1*(-1/2)=-a1/2,\n"

To set this equal to zero:\n\n9/8 - a3/8 +a2/4 -a1/2=0.\n\nMultiply through by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n9 -a3 + 2a2 -4a1=0.\n\nSo, -a3 +2a2 -4a1 = -9.\n\nLet me rearrange it: a3 -2a2 +4a1=9.\n\nAgain, since a3, a2, a1 are integers, this equation is solvable. For example, choosing a2=0, a3=1, 1 -0 +4a1=9 => 4a1=8 => a1=2. So with a3=1, a2=0, a1=2, x=-1/2 is a root.\n\nSo, yes, all four of these possible roots can indeed be achieved by choosing appropriate integer coefficients a3, a2, a1. Thus, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nI don't think I've made any mistakes in this reasoning. I considered all the possibilities from the Rational Root Theorem, confirmed that each possible root can indeed be realized, so the answer is 4.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial is of the form \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1\\).
