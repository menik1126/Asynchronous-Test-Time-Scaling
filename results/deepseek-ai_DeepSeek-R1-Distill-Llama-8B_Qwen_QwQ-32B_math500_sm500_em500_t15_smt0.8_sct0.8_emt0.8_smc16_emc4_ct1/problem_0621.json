            "output": "First, I need to recognize that 196 is a composite number, so it has divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nNext, I'll perform prime factorization on 196. I notice that 196 divided by 2 equals 98, and 98 divided by 2 equals 49. Then, 49 is a perfect square of 7, so the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared and 7 squared.\n\nNow, I'll use the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply those results together. The exponents here are 2 and 2, so adding 1 to each gives me 3 and 3.\n\nFinally, multiplying 3 by 3 gives me 9. Therefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - Start by breaking down 196 into prime factors.\n   - 196 can be divided by 2:  \n     \\( 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\)\n   - Continue dividing by 2:  \n     \\( 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\)\n   - Now, 49 is a perfect square:  \n     \\( 49 = 7 \\times 7 = 7^2 \\)\n   - So, the prime factorization of 196 is:  \n     \\( 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\)\n\n2. **Using the Divisor Formula**:\n   - If a number \\( N \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p^a \\times q^b \\), the total number of divisors is:  \n     \\( (a + 1) \\times (b + 1) \\)\n   - For 196, \\( a = 2 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).\n   - Plugging into the formula:  \n     \\( (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\)\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
