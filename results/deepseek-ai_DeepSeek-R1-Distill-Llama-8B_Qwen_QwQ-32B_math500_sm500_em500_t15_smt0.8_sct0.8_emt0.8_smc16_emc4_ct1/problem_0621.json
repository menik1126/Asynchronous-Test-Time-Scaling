            "output": "First, I need to determine the prime factorization of 196. I know that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2.\n\n196 divided by 2 equals 98. Since 98 is also even, it can be divided by 2 again.\n\n98 divided by 2 equals 49. Now, 49 is a well-known square number. It's divisible by 7.\n\n49 divided by 7 equals 7. Finally, 7 divided by 7 equals 1.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared, 7 squared, and 7 cubed. Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me double-check the division steps.\n\nActually, 49 divided by 7 is 7, and then dividing by 7 again gives 1. That means 49 is 7 squared. So, the prime factorization of 196 is actually 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared.\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is (exponent of each prime + 1) multiplied together, I get (2+1) times (2+1), which equals 3 times 3, totaling 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of 196**:\n   - 196 is even, so divide by 2:\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   - 98 is also even, divide by 2 again:\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   - Now, 49 is a square number. Divide by 7:\n     \\[\n     49 \\div 7 = 7\n     \\]\n   - Finally, divide by 7 again:\n     \\[\n     7 \\div 7 = 1\n     \\]\n   - So, the prime factors are \\(2^2\\) and \\(7^2\\).\n\n2. **Use the formula for the number of divisors**:\n   The formula for finding the number of divisors of a number \\(n = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{a_k}\\) is:\n  "
