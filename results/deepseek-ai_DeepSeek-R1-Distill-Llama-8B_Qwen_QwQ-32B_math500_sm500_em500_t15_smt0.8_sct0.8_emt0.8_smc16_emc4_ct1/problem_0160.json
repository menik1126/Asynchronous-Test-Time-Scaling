            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, okay, let me write that down to visualize it better. \n\nSo, it's the cube root of (x² - 4x + 4) = 16. I remember that cube roots can be tricky, but I think the key here is to get rid of the cube root first. To do that, I should probably cube both sides of the equation. That makes sense because cubing is the inverse operation of taking a cube root. \n\nLet me set that up. If I cube both sides, the left side becomes (cube root of (x² - 4x + 4))³, which simplifies to just (x² - 4x + 4). And on the right side, 16 cubed is... hmm, let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16 is... wait, 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536, so adding those together is 4096. So, 16³ is 4096.\n\nOkay, so now my equation is simplified to x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. Next step, I think I should bring the 4096 to the left side to set the equation to zero. So, subtracting 4096 from both sides gives me x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Let me compute that constant term: 4 minus 4096 is -4092. So, the equation becomes x² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nNow I have a quadratic equation. To solve this, I can use the quadratic formula, right? The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Let me plug those values in.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac. So, b squared is (-4)², which is 16. Then, 4ac is 4 * 1 * (-4092). That's 4 * (-4092). Let me compute that: 4092 *"

            "output": " 4 is... 4000*4=16000, and 92*4=368, so 16000 + 368 is 16368. But since c is negative, 4ac is -16368. So, the discriminant is 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, so 16 + 16368 is 16384.\n\nAlright, so the discriminant is 16384. Now, I need to find the square root of that. Hmm, 16384 is a power of 2? Let me check. 2^14 is 16384 because 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048, 2^12 is 4096, 2^13 is 8192, and 2^14 is 16384. So, sqrt(16384) is 128 because 128 squared is 16384. That seems right.\n\nSo, now plugging back into the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± 128]/(2*1). Since b is -4, -b becomes 4. So, x = [4 ± 128]/2. That gives two possible solutions: one where we add 128 and another where we subtract 128.\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128)/2. 4 + 128 is 132. Divided by 2 is 66.\n\nSecond solution: (4 - 128)/2. 4 - 128 is -124. Divided by 2 is -62.\n\nWait, but the question specifically asks for the positive value of x. So, 66 is positive, and -62 is negative. So, the answer should be 66.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation, cube both sides: correct. 16 cubed is 4096: right. Then, subtracting 4096: yes, leads to x² -4x -4092=0. Applied quadratic formula: correct. Calculated discriminant as 16384, whose square root is 128: yes. Then, [4 ±128]/2 gives 66 and -62: correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me plug x=66 back into the original equation to verify.\n\nCompute inside the cube root first: x² -4x +"

So, that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, for x=-62: (-62)² is 3844. 4*(-62) is -248. So, 3844 - (-248) would be 3844 +248=4092. Then, 4092 +4 is 4096. So, cube root of 4096 is 16 as well. So, x=-62 also satisfies the equation.\n\nBut since the question asks for the positive value, 66 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe solution to the equation is found by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root, simplifying the equation to a quadratic. Solving the quadratic using the quadratic formula yields two solutions, but only the positive one is required.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\boxed{66}"
