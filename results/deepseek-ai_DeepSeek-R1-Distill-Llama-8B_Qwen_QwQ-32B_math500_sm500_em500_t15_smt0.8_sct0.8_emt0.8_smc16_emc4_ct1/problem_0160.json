            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, cube roots can be tricky, but I think I can handle it. Let me remember the steps from my algebra class. \n\nFirst, I should probably get rid of the cube root to make the equation easier to work with. The cube root is like a special exponent, right? So, if I have the cube root of something equals 16, I can cube both sides to eliminate the cube root. Yeah, that makes sense because if I do something to one side, I should do it to the other to keep the equation balanced.\n\nAlright, so if I take both sides and cube them, that should work. Let me write that down:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\n\\]\n\nCubing both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides, that would leave me with:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\\]\n\nWait, how did I get 4096? Let me check that. 16 cubed is 16 times 16 times 16. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... let me do that multiplication step by step. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536, so 2560 plus 1536 is 4096. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo now I have a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\\]\n\nI need to bring all terms to one side so that the equation equals zero. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that, I combine the constant terms:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation in standard form. I need to solve for x. Quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me see if this one factors nicely. The product"

            "output": " of the constants in the factors should be -4092, and their sum should be -4.\n\nBut 4092 is a pretty big number. Let me try to factor it. 4092 divided by 4 is 1023, which is... let me see if 1023 is divisible by 3. 1+0+2+3=6, which is divisible by 3, so 1023 divided by 3 is 341. So, 4092 is 4 times 3 times 341. Wait, 341 is 11 times 31. So, 4092 factors into 4*3*11*31. Hmm, that's not helpful for factoring the quadratic because I don't see two numbers that multiply to -4092 and add up to -4.\n\nMaybe I should use the quadratic formula instead. The quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nIn this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Plugging those values in:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying step by step:\n\nFirst, -(-4) is 4.\n\nThen, (-4)^2 is 16.\n\nNext, calculate the discriminant: 16 - 4*1*(-4092). Wait, that would be 16 plus 4*4092 because multiplying two negatives gives a positive.\n\nSo, 4 times 4092 is 16368. Adding that to 16 gives 16384.\n\nSo the square root part becomes sqrt(16384). Hmm, what's the square root of 16384? Let me think. 128 squared is 16384 because 128 * 128 is... 128*100=12800, 128*28=3584, so 12800+3584=16384. So sqrt(16384) is 128.\n\nSo now, plugging back into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo that gives two solutions:\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66"
