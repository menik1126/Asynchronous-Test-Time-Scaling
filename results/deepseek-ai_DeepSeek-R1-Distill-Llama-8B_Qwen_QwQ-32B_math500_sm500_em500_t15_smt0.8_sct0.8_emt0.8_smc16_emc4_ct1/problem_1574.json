Let me write it down clearly:\n\n\u221a[(5/\u221a80 + \u221a845/9 + \u221a45) / \u221a5]\n\nFirst, I'll simplify each square root in the numerator.\n\nStarting with \u221a80, I can factor it into 16 * 5, so \u221a80 becomes 4\u221a5.\n\nNext, \u221a845 can be broken down into 65 * 13, making it \u221a(5*13) = \u221a5 * \u221a13.\n\nThen, \u221a45 simplifies to 3\u221a5.\n\nNow, I'll rewrite the expression with these simplified forms:\n\u221a[(5/(4\u221a5) + (\u221a5 * \u221a13)/9 + 3\u221a5) / \u221a5]\n\nI notice that each term in the numerator has a \u221a5, so I can factor that out:\n\u221a[(\u221a5(5/(4*5) + (\u221a13)/9 + 3)) / \u221a5]\n\nThis simplifies to \u221a[(\u221a5(1/4 + \u221a13/9 + 3)) / \u221a5]\n\nThe \u221a5 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving \u221a(1/4 + \u221a13/9 + 3).\n\nTo add the fractions, I need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Converting each term:\n1/4 becomes 9/36, \u221a13/9 becomes 4\u221a13/36, and 3 becomes 108/36.\n\nSo, the expression becomes \u221a[(9/36 + 4\u221a13/36 + 108/36)] = \u221a[(121 + 4\u221a13)/36].\n\nThis can be separated into \u221a(121)/\u221a36 + \u221a(4\u221a13)/\u221a36, which simplifies to 11/6 + (\u221a(4\u221a13))/6.\n\nHowever, this seems incorrect because \u221a(4\u221a13) is not a straightforward simplification. I need to reconsider the earlier steps.\n\nLet me re-express the numerator before factoring out \u221a5:\n5/(4\u221a5) + (\u221a5 * \u221a13)/9 + 3\u221a5.\n\nSimplifying each term:\n5/(4\u221a5) = (\u221a5)/4,\n(\u221a5 * \u221a13)/9 remains as is,\nand 3\u221a5 cannot be simplified further.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n[(\u221a5"

The denominators are 4 and 9, so the common denominator is 36.\n\nConvert each term:\n13/4 = (13*9)/36 = 117/36,\n\u221a13/9 = (4\u221a13)/36.\n\nAdding them together: (117 + 4\u221a13)/36.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes \u221a[(117 + 4\u221a13)/36].\n\nThis simplifies to \u221a(117 + 4\u221a13)/6.\n\nHmm, but this doesn't look like a simplified fraction. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if 117 + 4\u221a13 can be expressed as a square of some binomial. Let me see.\n\nSuppose \u221a(a + b\u221a13) squared equals a\u00b2 + 2ab\u221a13 + b\u00b2*13. We want this to equal 117 + 4\u221a13.\n\nSo, setting up equations:\na\u00b2 + 13b\u00b2 = 117,\n2ab = 4.\n\nFrom the second equation, ab = 2. Let me try integer values for a and b.\n\nPossible pairs (a,b) where ab=2: (1,2), (2,1), ( -1,-2), etc. Let's try a=2, b=1.\n\nThen, a\u00b2 +13b\u00b2 = 4 +13 =17 \u2260117. Not good.\n\nNext, a=6, b= (2/6"

So perhaps the expression cannot be simplified further, and \u221a(117 +4\u221a13) is as simple as it gets.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form is \u221a(117 +4\u221a13)/6.\n\nBut the problem asks for a simplified fraction, so perhaps this is acceptable, or maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should rationalize each term first before adding.\n\nLet me revisit the original expression:\n\u221a[(5/\u221a80 + \u221a845/9 + \u221a45)/\u221a5]\n\nSimplify each radical:\n\n\u221a80 = 4\u221a5,\n\u221a845 = \u221a(5*169) = \u221a5*13,\n\u221a45 = 3\u221a5.\n\nSo the numerator inside the square root becomes:\n5/(4\u221a5) + (\u221a5*13)/9 + 3\u221a5.\n\nSimplify each term:\n5/(4\u221a5) = (5\u221a5)/(4*5) = \u221a5/4,\n(\u221a5*13)/9 = 13\u221a5/9,\n3\u221a5 remains as is.\n\nSo, numerator is \u221a5/4 +13\u221a5/9 +3\u221a5.\n\nFactor out \u221a5:\n\u221a5*(1/4 +13/9 +3).\n\nConvert to common denominator for the constants: 36.\n\n1/4 = 9/36, 13/9 =52/36, 3=108/36.\n\nAdd them: 9+52+108=169, so 169/36.\n\nThus, numerator is \u221a5*(169/36).\n\nDivide by \u221a5: (\u221a5*(169/36))/\u221a5 =169/36.\n\nNow, take square root: \u221a(169/36)=13/6.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 13/6.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.

So the correct answer is 13/6. I must have made a mistake in my earlier steps when I thought the numerator was 117 +4\u221a13. Probably miscalculating the coefficients.\n\nSo the key was to factor out \u221a5 properly and then the terms inside add up to 169/36, whose square root is 13/6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 13/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{6}}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression step by step:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}}+\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9}+\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt{5}}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, simplify each square root in the numerator:\n- \\(\\sqrt{80} = 4\\sqrt{5}\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{845} = \\sqrt{5 \\cdot 169} = 13\\sqrt{5}\\)\n- \\(\\"
