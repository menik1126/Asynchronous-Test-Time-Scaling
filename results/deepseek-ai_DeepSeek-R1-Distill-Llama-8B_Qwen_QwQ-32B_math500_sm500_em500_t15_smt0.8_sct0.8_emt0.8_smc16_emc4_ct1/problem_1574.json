            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: sqrt[(5/sqrt80 + sqrt845/9 + sqrt45)/sqrt5]. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I can try breaking it down step by step. Let me write it out so I can see it better.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression for clarity. It's the square root of a fraction, where the numerator is (5 divided by sqrt80 plus sqrt845 divided by 9 plus sqrt45), and the denominator is sqrt5. So, it's like sqrt[(A + B + C)/D], where A is 5/sqrt80, B is sqrt845/9, C is sqrt45, and D is sqrt5.\n\nMaybe I can simplify each of these terms first before dealing with the entire expression. Let me take each term one by one.\n\nStarting with A: 5 divided by sqrt80. I know that sqrt80 can be simplified because 80 is 16 times 5, so sqrt80 is sqrt(16*5) which is sqrt16 times sqrt5, which is 4*sqrt5. So, 5 divided by sqrt80 is 5/(4*sqrt5). Maybe I can rationalize the denominator here. Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt5, so we get (5*sqrt5)/(4*5). The 5s cancel out, leaving (sqrt5)/4. So, A simplifies to sqrt5/4.\n\nNext, B: sqrt845 divided by 9. Hmm, 845, I wonder if that can be simplified. Let me factor 845: 845 divided by 5 is 169. Oh, 169 is 13 squared. So, 845 is 5*13^2. Therefore, sqrt845 is sqrt(5*13^2) which is 13*sqrt5. So, B is (13*sqrt5)/9. Got that.\n\nNow, C: sqrt45. 45 is 9*5, so sqrt45 is sqrt(9*5) which is 3*sqrt5.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the numerator A + B + C becomes sqrt5/4 + (13sqrt5)/9 + 3sqrt5.\n\nWait, all these terms have sqrt5 in them. Maybe I can factor that out to make it easier. Let me factor sqrt5 out of each term. That would give me sqrt5"

            "output": "*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Let's compute the coefficients inside the parentheses.\n\nFirst, 1/4 + 13/9. To add these, I need a common denominator. 4 and 9 have a least common denominator of 36. So, 1/4 is 9/36, and 13/9 is 52/36. Adding those: 9 + 52 = 61, so 61/36.\n\nThen, add 3 to that. Wait, 3 is the same as 108/36. So, 61/36 + 108/36 is (61 + 108)/36 = 169/36.\n\nSo, the numerator is sqrt5*(169/36) which is (169sqrt5)/36.\n\nNow, the entire expression is the square root of the numerator divided by sqrt5. So, sqrt[(169sqrt5)/36 divided by sqrt5]. Let me write that fraction division as multiplication by the reciprocal. So, (169sqrt5)/36 * 1/sqrt5.\n\nMultiplying those together: (169sqrt5)/(36*sqrt5). I notice that sqrt5 is in both numerator and denominator, so they can cancel out. So, 169/36. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me step back. The entire expression is the square root of (numerator/sqrt5). So, after simplifying the numerator to (169sqrt5)/36, we have sqrt[(169sqrt5)/36 divided by sqrt5]. Hmm, maybe I should write that as sqrt[(169sqrt5)/(36*sqrt5)].\n\nYes, because dividing by sqrt5 is the same as multiplying by 1/sqrt5. So, numerator becomes (169sqrt5) and denominator becomes 36*sqrt5. Then, the sqrt5 terms cancel out, leaving 169/36 inside the square root.\n\nSo, sqrt(169/36). I know that sqrt of a fraction is the same as the fraction of the square roots. So, sqrt169 is 13, sqrt36 is 6. So, this becomes 13/6.\n\nWait, so the entire expression simplifies to 13/6? Let me just verify each step to be sure.\n\nFirst, 5/sqrt80: sqrt80 is 4sqrt5, so 5/(4sqrt5) becomes sqrt5/4 after rational"

Correct.\n\nSo, adding sqrt5/4 + (13sqrt5)/9 + 3sqrt5.\n\nFactoring out sqrt5: sqrt5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). 1/4 +13/9 is 9/36 + 52/36 = 61/36. Then 3 is 108/36. 61+108=169, so 169/36. So, sqrt5*(169/36) is (169sqrt5)/36.\n\nThen, the entire expression is sqrt of [ (169sqrt5)/36 divided by sqrt5 ].\n\nWhich is sqrt[ (169sqrt5)/(36*sqrt5) ) ] = sqrt(169/36) = 13/6.
