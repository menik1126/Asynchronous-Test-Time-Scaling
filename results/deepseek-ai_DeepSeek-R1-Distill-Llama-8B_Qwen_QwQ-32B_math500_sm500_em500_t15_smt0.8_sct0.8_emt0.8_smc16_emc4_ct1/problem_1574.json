Let me write it down clearly:\n\n√[(5/√80 + √845/9 + √45) / √5]\n\nFirst, I'll simplify each square root in the numerator.\n\nStarting with √80, I can factor it into 16 * 5, so √80 becomes 4√5.\n\nNext, √845 can be broken down into 65 * 13, making it √(5*13) = √5 * √13.\n\nThen, √45 simplifies to 3√5.\n\nNow, I'll rewrite the expression with these simplified forms:\n√[(5/(4√5) + (√5 * √13)/9 + 3√5) / √5]\n\nI notice that each term in the numerator has a √5, so I can factor that out:\n√[(√5(5/(4*5) + (√13)/9 + 3)) / √5]\n\nThis simplifies to √[(√5(1/4 + √13/9 + 3)) / √5]\n\nThe √5 in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving √(1/4 + √13/9 + 3).\n\nTo add the fractions, I need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Converting each term:\n1/4 becomes 9/36, √13/9 becomes 4√13/36, and 3 becomes 108/36.\n\nSo, the expression becomes √[(9/36 + 4√13/36 + 108/36)] = √[(121 + 4√13)/36].\n\nThis can be separated into √(121)/√36 + √(4√13)/√36, which simplifies to 11/6 + (√(4√13))/6.\n\nHowever, this seems incorrect because √(4√13) is not a straightforward simplification. I need to reconsider the earlier steps.\n\nLet me re-express the numerator before factoring out √5:\n5/(4√5) + (√5 * √13)/9 + 3√5.\n\nSimplifying each term:\n5/(4√5) = (√5)/4,\n(√5 * √13)/9 remains as is,\nand 3√5 cannot be simplified further.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n[(√5"

The denominators are 4 and 9, so the common denominator is 36.\n\nConvert each term:\n13/4 = (13*9)/36 = 117/36,\n√13/9 = (4√13)/36.\n\nAdding them together: (117 + 4√13)/36.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes √[(117 + 4√13)/36].\n\nThis simplifies to √(117 + 4√13)/6.\n\nHmm, but this doesn't look like a simplified fraction. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if 117 + 4√13 can be expressed as a square of some binomial. Let me see.\n\nSuppose √(a + b√13) squared equals a² + 2ab√13 + b²*13. We want this to equal 117 + 4√13.\n\nSo, setting up equations:\na² + 13b² = 117,\n2ab = 4.\n\nFrom the second equation, ab = 2. Let me try integer values for a and b.\n\nPossible pairs (a,b) where ab=2: (1,2), (2,1), ( -1,-2), etc. Let's try a=2, b=1.\n\nThen, a² +13b² = 4 +13 =17 ≠117. Not good.\n\nNext, a=6, b= (2/6"

So perhaps the expression cannot be simplified further, and √(117 +4√13) is as simple as it gets.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form is √(117 +4√13)/6.\n\nBut the problem asks for a simplified fraction, so perhaps this is acceptable, or maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should rationalize each term first before adding.\n\nLet me revisit the original expression:\n√[(5/√80 + √845/9 + √45)/√5]\n\nSimplify each radical:\n\n√80 = 4√5,\n√845 = √(5*169) = √5*13,\n√45 = 3√5.\n\nSo the numerator inside the square root becomes:\n5/(4√5) + (√5*13)/9 + 3√5.\n\nSimplify each term:\n5/(4√5) = (5√5)/(4*5) = √5/4,\n(√5*13)/9 = 13√5/9,\n3√5 remains as is.\n\nSo, numerator is √5/4 +13√5/9 +3√5.\n\nFactor out √5:\n√5*(1/4 +13/9 +3).\n\nConvert to common denominator for the constants: 36.\n\n1/4 = 9/36, 13/9 =52/36, 3=108/36.\n\nAdd them: 9+52+108=169, so 169/36.\n\nThus, numerator is √5*(169/36).\n\nDivide by √5: (√5*(169/36))/√5 =169/36.\n\nNow, take square root: √(169/36)=13/6.\n\nSo, the simplified expression is 13/6.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. I must have made a mistake in simplifying earlier.\n\nSo, the correct simplification is:\n\n√[(√5/4 +13√5/9 +3√5)/√5] = √[(√5*(1/4 +13/9 +3))/√5] = √[(1/4 +13/9 +3)].\n\nWait, that is √[(1"

So the correct answer is 13/6. I must have made a mistake in my earlier steps when I thought the numerator was 117 +4√13. Probably miscalculating the coefficients.\n\nSo the key was to factor out √5 properly and then the terms inside add up to 169/36, whose square root is 13/6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 13/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{6}}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression step by step:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}}+\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9}+\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt{5}}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, simplify each square root in the numerator:\n- \\(\\sqrt{80} = 4\\sqrt{5}\\)\n- \\(\\sqrt{845} = \\sqrt{5 \\cdot 169} = 13\\sqrt{5}\\)\n- \\(\\"
