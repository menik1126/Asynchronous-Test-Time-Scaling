So chord length=2r sin(π/4)=2r*(√2/2)= r√2.\n\nHere, r=2^{1/8}, so chord length=2^{1/8} * √2=2^{1/8}*2^{1/2}=2^{5/8}.\n\nSo the side length of the square is 2^{5/8}, so the area is (side length)^2= (2^{5/8})^2=2^{5/4}.\n\nThus, the area is 2^{5/4}, so a=5, b=4, p=2. Therefore, a+b+p=5+4+2=11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). We recognize that this can be rewritten as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).\n\nFirst, we express \\( 1 + i \\) in polar form: \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} e^{i \\pi/4} \\). The fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\) are given by \\( w_k = 2^{1/8} e^{i (\\pi/16 + 2k\\pi/4)} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\).\n\nThe solutions to the equation are \\( z = -i + w_k \\), where \\( w_k \\) are the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\). Each \\( w_k \\) has modulus \\( 2^{"
