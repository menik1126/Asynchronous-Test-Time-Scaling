            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). The problem says that the solutions of this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon. Then, express the area in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime, \\( p \\) is prime, and then find \\( a + b + p \\). \n\nHmm, okay. First, let me try to understand the equation. It's a quartic equation, which means it's a degree 4 polynomial. So, there should be four solutions (roots) in the complex plane. These roots form the vertices of a convex polygon. Since it's quartic, the polygon has four sides, so it's a quadrilateral, but depending on how the roots are placed, it could be a square, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, etc., but likely a square because of the coefficients. \n\nLooking at the coefficients, I notice they have terms with \\( z^4, z^3i, z^2, zi, \\) and a constant term. The pattern seems to resemble a binomial expansion, but with some extra terms. Wait a second, maybe it's a quadratic in disguise? Let me try to see.\n\nLet me set \\( w = z + i \\). Maybe a substitution can make this equation simpler. Let me compute \\( z = w - i \\) and substitute into the equation.\n\nSo, \\( z = w - i \\). Let me substitute into each term:\n\n1. \\( z^4 = (w - i)^4 \\)\n2. \\( 4z^3i = 4(w - i)^3i \\)\n3. \\( -6z^2 = -6(w - i)^2 \\)\n4. \\( -4zi = -4(w - i)i \\)\n5. \\( -i = -i \\)\n\nSo, plugging all these into the original equation:\n\n\\( (w - i)^4 + 4(w - i)^3i - 6(w - i)^2 -4(w - i)i - i = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, simplifying each term:\n\nFirst, let's handle each term separately.\n\nCompute \\( (w - i)^"

Since 5 and 4 are coprime, that's the form. Therefore, a + b + p =5 +4 +2=11.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, the problem says the solutions are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane. But the roots \\( z_k = \\omega_k -i \\). So, the polygon is the square shifted down by i. However, shifting a square doesn't change its area, so the area remains the same as the original square. Therefore, the area is indeed 2^{5/4}, so the answer would be 5 +4 +2=11.\n\nBut let me confirm again. Let me check my steps again.\n\nFirst, I noticed that the original equation can be written as \\( (z +i)^4 =1 +i \\). Therefore, the roots are \\( z = -i + \\omega \\), where \\( \\omega^4 =1 +i \\). The roots \\( \\omega \\) are the fourth roots of \\(1 +i \\), which are equally spaced on a circle of radius \\( |1 +i|^{1/4} = ( \\sqrt{2} )^{1/4}=2^{1/8} \\). Since they are fourth roots, spaced at angles of π/2 apart, so they form a square. Therefore, the area of the square formed by the \\( \\omega \\) is 2*(2^{1/8})²=2^{5/4}. Since shifting the square by -i doesn't change the area, the area of the polygon formed by the z's is the same. Therefore, the area is 2^{5/4}, so p=2, a=5, b=4, so 5+4+2=11.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the solutions of the equation are the vertices of a convex polygon\". Since the roots \\( z \\) are the \\( \\omega -i \\), so the polygon is the square shifted down by i. But shifting doesn't affect the area, so the area is indeed the same as the square formed by the roots \\("

So, in the complex plane, this is equivalent to a translation by -i. Since translation doesn't change distances or areas, the polygon's area remains equal to the square formed by \\( \\omega_k \\), which is 2^{5/4}.\n\nTherefore, the area is indeed \\( 2^{5/4} \\), so in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), with p=2, a=5, b=4. Then, a + b + p =5 +4 +2=11.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let me think if there is any possible error in my reasoning.\n\nI considered the original equation and recognized it as \\( (z +i)^4 =1 +i \\). Therefore, that gives \\( z +i \\) as the fourth roots of \\(1 +i \\), so \\( z \\) is a shifted version of those roots. Since the fourth roots form a square, the shift doesn't alter the area. Hence, the area is 2^{5/4}.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). We recognize that this equation can be rewritten as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\). Therefore, the solutions are \\( z = -i + \\omega \\) where \\( \\omega \\) are the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\).\n\nThe fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\) are complex numbers with modulus \\( (2^{1/2})^{1/4} = 2^{1/8} \\) and angles \\( \\frac{\\pi/4 + 2\\pi k}{4} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\). These roots form a square inscribed in a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\).\n\nThe area of a square inscribed in a circle of radius \\( r \\) is \\( 2r^2 \\). Here, the radius \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\), so"
