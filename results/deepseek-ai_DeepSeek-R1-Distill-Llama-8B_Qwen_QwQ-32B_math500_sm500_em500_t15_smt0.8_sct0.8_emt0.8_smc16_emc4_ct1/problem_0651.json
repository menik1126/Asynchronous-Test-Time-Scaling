            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find \\( P(16) \\) for a quadratic polynomial \\( P(x) \\). The problem states that \\( P(x) \\) satisfies the inequalities \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq P(x) \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\). Additionally, it's given that \\( P(11) = 181 \\). Hmm, I need to figure out how all this information can help me find \\( P(16) \\).\n\nFirst, let me recall that a quadratic polynomial has the general form \\( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are real coefficients. Since \\( P(x) \\) is sandwiched between two other quadratics, maybe I can use that to find the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nThe inequalities given are:\n\\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq P(x) \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\]\nfor all real \\( x \\). That means that for every \\( x \\), the value of \\( P(x) \\) is at least \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) and at most \\( 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\).\n\nSince both inequalities must hold for all real \\( x \\), it suggests that the difference between \\( P(x) \\) and each of these quadratics must be non-negative or non-positive, respectively. However, since \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic itself, the difference between \\( P(x) \\) and each of these quadratics is also a quadratic. For a quadratic to be non-negative for all real \\( x \\), its leading coefficient must be non-negative, and its discriminant must be non-positive (so that it doesn't cross the x-axis). Similarly, if a quadratic is always less than or equal to another quadratic, that difference must also be non-positive for all \\( x \\).\n\nSo, let's define two new quadratics:\n1. \\( Q(x) = P(x) - (x^2 - 2x + 2) \\). Since \\( Q(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\),"

Since \\( R(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), similarly, \\( R(x) \\) must be a non-negative quadratic with a non-negative leading coefficient and a discriminant less than or equal to zero.\n\nLet me write out these two quadratics in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).

Let's see if it's non-negative for all x.\n\nThe discriminant is (-1)^2 -4*(1/2)*(1/2) =1 -1 =0. So it's a perfect square, so it's non-negative. So the average quadratic is exactly the lower bound plus a perfect square, so it touches the lower bound at its minimum.\n\nSimilarly, the upper bound minus the average quadratic is (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - (3/2 x\u00b2 -3x +5/2) = (2 - 3/2)x\u00b2 + (-4 +3)x + (3 -5/2) = (1/2)x\u00b2 -x +1/2, which is the same as before. So the upper bound minus the average quadratic is also the same quadratic, which is non-negative. So the average quadratic is exactly halfway between the two given quadratics, and touches both at their common point.\n\nWait, so in this case, the average quadratic is exactly the one that touches both the lower and upper bounds at the same point where their difference is zero. Since the difference between upper and lower is (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - (x\u00b2 -2x +2) = x\u00b2 -2x +1 = (x-1)^2. So the difference between upper and lower is (x-1)^2, which is always non-negative, and equals zero only at x=1. So the two quadratics touch at x=1. Therefore, the average quadratic would also touch both at x=1?\n\nWait, let me check the average quadratic at x="
