            "output": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find P(16) given some constraints on a quadratic polynomial P(x). Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. That means P(x) can be written in the general form:\n\\[ P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\]\nwhere a, b, and c are real numbers.\n\nWe also have inequalities saying that for all real numbers x, the polynomial x² - 2x + 2 is less than or equal to P(x), which is less than or equal to 2x² - 4x + 3. So, in mathematical terms:\n\\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq P(x) \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\]\nfor all real x. That means P(x) is sandwiched between these two quadratics everywhere on the graph.\n\nAnother piece of information is that P(11) = 181. Our goal is to find P(16).\n\nAlright, so how do I approach this? Let's think.\n\nSince both inequalities must hold for all real x, maybe I can write both inequalities and see if I can find equations involving a, b, c.\n\nSo, let's write out the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq ax^2 + bx + c \\)\n2. \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\)\n\nThese must be true for all x. So, to satisfy these inequalities for all x, the difference between P(x) and both lower and upper bounds must be non-positive (negative or zero).\n\nLet's rearrange both inequalities to make it clearer.\n\nFor the first inequality:\n\\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq ax^2 + bx + c \\]\nSubtracting P(x) from both sides gives:\n\\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 - ax^2 - bx - c \\leq 0 \\]\nSimplify like terms:\n\\[ (1 - a)x^2 + (-2 - b)x + (2 - c) \\leq 0 \\]\nfor all x.\n\nSimilarly, for the second inequality:\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c"

That is, they must be either always non-positive or non-negative, which requires their leading coefficients to be non-positive or non-negative respectively, and their discriminants must be non-positive (so they don't have real roots).\n\nLet me handle the first inequality's quadratic:\n\\[ (1 - a)x^2 + (-2 - b)x + (2 - c) \\leq 0 \\quad \\forall x \\]\n\nFor this quadratic to be ≤ 0 for all x, the leading coefficient (1 - a) must be ≤ 0, so that the parabola opens downward. Also, the discriminant must be ≤ 0 to ensure it doesn't cross the x-axis (so it's always below or equal to zero).\n\nSimilarly, for the second inequality's quadratic:\n\\[ (2 - a)x^2 + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall x \\]\n\nHere, the leading coefficient (2 - a) must be ≥ 0, so the parabola opens upward.

Since P(x) is squeezed between two quadratics everywhere, maybe we can consider that P(x) must be equal to the lower bound or upper bound at certain points. But wait, if both inequalities are strict (i.e., hold for all x, not just some x), then P(x) must coincide with either the lower or upper quadratic at the points where they touch, but since P(x) is a quadratic, the only way both inequalities hold for all x is that the difference between P(x) and both bounds is a quadratic that is always negative or positive.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is that the difference between P(x) and each of the two quadratics must be non-positive and non-negative respectively, and each difference is a quadratic function. Since both differences must be non-positive or non-negative for all x, their discriminants must be ≤ 0 and their leading coefficients must have the right sign.\n\nLet me think: Let me denote:\n\nDefine Q1(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x\n\nand Q2(x) = (2x² -4x +3) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x\n\nSo, Q1(x) = (a -1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x\n\nSimilarly, Q2(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) ≥ 0 for all x\n\nSo, both Q1 and Q"

Let me rephrase:\n\nQ1(x) = (a -1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nTherefore, for Q1 to be non-negative for all x, the leading coefficient (a -1) must be ≥ 0, and the discriminant must be ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, Q2(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) ≥ 0 for all x, so leading coefficient (2 - a) must be ≥ 0, and discriminant ≤ 0.\n\nSo, this gives us the same conditions as before:\n\nFor Q1:\n\n1. a -1 ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≥1\n\n2.

D2=0.\n\nSo, now, since both discriminants are zero, the quadratics Q1(x) and Q2(x) touch the x-axis exactly once, i.e., they have a double root, so they are perfect squares (since the discriminant is zero, so they are perfect squares).\n\nMoreover, since Q1(x) is ≥0 for all x, the leading coefficient of Q1 is a -1=9/5 -1=4/5>0, so the quadratic opens upward, which is necessary for it to be non-negative everywhere.\n\nSimilarly, Q2(x) is (2 -a)x² + (-4 -b)x + (3 -c). 2 -a=2 -9/5=1/5>0, so it also opens upward, and since it's non-negative everywhere, the quadratic has a double root, so it touches the x-axis at exactly one point.\n\nAlright, so the values of a=9/5, b=-18/5, c=14/5 satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nNow, we need to compute P(16).
