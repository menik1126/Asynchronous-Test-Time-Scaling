Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm and a hexagon has six sides, I can calculate the total perimeter by multiplying the side length by the number of sides.\n\nNext, the problem states that the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon. Therefore, I'll set the perimeter of the octagon equal to the perimeter of the hexagon, which is 16 cm multiplied by 6.\n\nThen, I'll solve for the number of sides of the octagon. However, I realize that a regular octagon has eight sides, so I'll divide the total perimeter by the number of sides to find the length of each side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\,\\text{cm} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the perimeter of the regular octagon equal to that of the hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the length of each side of the octagon.**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of each side} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{\\text{Number of sides of octagon}} = \\frac{96\\,\\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\,\\text{cm}}\n\\]"
