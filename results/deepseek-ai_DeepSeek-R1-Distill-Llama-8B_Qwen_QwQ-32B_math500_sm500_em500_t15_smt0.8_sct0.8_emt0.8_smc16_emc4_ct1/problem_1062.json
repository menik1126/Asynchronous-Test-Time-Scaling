            "output": "First, I need to calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon since the problem states that the octagon has the same perimeter.\n\nA regular hexagon has six equal sides, each measuring 16 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16 cm.\n\nNext, since the octagon's perimeter is equal to the hexagon's, I can set up the equation for the octagon's perimeter as 6 times its side length.\n\nLet’s denote the side length of the octagon as \\( x \\) cm. Then, the perimeter of the octagon is \\( 8x \\) cm.\n\nSetting the two perimeters equal to each other, I get:\n\\( 8x = 6 \\times 16 \\)\n\nFinally, I’ll solve for \\( x \\) to find the length of each side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   \n   - A regular **hexagon** has a perimeter.\n   - A regular **octagon** has the same perimeter.\n   - We need to find the length of each side of the octagon.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\,\\text{cm} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation for the Octagon's Perimeter:**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the length of each side of the octagon.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 8x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set the Perimeters Equal to Each Other:**\n   \n   \\[\n   8x = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{96\\,\\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe length of each side of the octagon is \\(\\boxed{12\\,\\text{cm}}\\)."
