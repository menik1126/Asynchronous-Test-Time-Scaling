            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. The sequence is a1, a2, a3, and so on. The problem says that for every positive integer k, two things are true:\n\n1. The subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric.\n2. The subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic.\n\nAnd I know that a_{13} is 2016. I need to find a1.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. First, let's recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\nA geometric sequence has a constant ratio between consecutive terms. So, if I have three terms x, y, z in a geometric sequence, then y/x = z/y, which means y^2 = xz.\n\nAn arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms. So, if I have three terms x, y, z in an arithmetic sequence, then y - x = z - y, which means 2y = x + z.\n\nGiven that, the problem says that for every k, the terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} form a geometric sequence, and the terms a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo, for each k, we have two conditions:\n\n1. (a_{2k})^2 = a_{2k-1} * a_{2k+1}\n2. 2*a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}\n\nThat's the key. Since this is true for every k, it must hold for k=1,2,3,..., up to some point, especially since we know a_{13}.\n\nI need to see if I can find a pattern or relationship between the terms, especially relating a_{13} back to earlier terms.\n\nLet me start by writing the equations for small values of k.\n\nFor k=1:\n\n1. (a2)^2 = a1 * a3\n2. 2*a3 = a2 + a4\n\nFor k=2:\n\n1. (a4)^2 = a3 * a5\n2. 2*a5 ="

So maybe I can express all the terms up to a13 in terms of a1 and a2, perhaps.\n\nLet me assume that the entire sequence can be generated using these relations, so maybe I can express each term in terms of a1 and a2.\n\nStarting with k=1.\n\nFrom the first equation: a2^2 = a1 * a3. So, a3 = a2^2 / a1.\n\nFrom the second equation: 2*a3 = a2 + a4. So, a4 = 2*a3 - a2.\n\nBut since a3 = a2^2 / a1, plugging that in: a4 = 2*(a2^2 / a1) - a2.\n\nSo, a4 = (2*a2^2 - a1*a2) / a1.\n\nWait, but a4 must be an integer, right? Since the sequence is of positive integers.\n\nSo, (2*a2^2 - a1*a2) must be divisible by a1.\n\nHmm, so a1 must divide 2*a2^2 - a1*a2.\n\nWhich can be written as a1 divides 2*a2^2, because a1 divides a1*a2, so subtracting a1*a2 from 2*a2^2, the result is divisible by a1.\n\nSo, a1 divides 2*a2^2.\n\nSimilarly, moving on.\n\nFrom k=2:\n\na4^2 = a3 * a5.
