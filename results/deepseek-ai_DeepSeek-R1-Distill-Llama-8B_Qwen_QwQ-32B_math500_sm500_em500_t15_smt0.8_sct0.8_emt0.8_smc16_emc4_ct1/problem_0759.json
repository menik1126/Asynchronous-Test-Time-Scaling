The problem says that for every positive integer k, two specific subsequences have special properties. The first is that the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is a geometric sequence. The second subsequence, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, is an arithmetic sequence. We\u2019re also given that a_{13} is 2016, and we need to find a1.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to understand what this means. So, the sequence is strictly increasing, which means each term is bigger than the one before it. That helps because it tells me that the terms can't repeat or stay the same; they have to keep getting larger. \n\nFirst, let me think about geometric sequences. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. So, for the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, which is geometric, I can denote the common ratio as r. That would mean a_{2k} = r * a_{2k-1} and a_{2k+1} = r * a_{2k} = r^2 * a_{2k-1}. \n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic sequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, the property is that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So, the difference between a_{2k+1} and a_{2k} is the same as the difference between a_{2k+2} and a_{2k+1}. \n\nLet me denote this common difference as d. So, a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = d and a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1} = d, which implies a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d.\n\nWait, but in the geometric sequence, a_{2k+1} is equal to r * a_{2k}, which is r^2 * a_{2k-1}. So, putting that together with the arithmetic sequence, I can see"

So, a5 - a4 = a6 - a5 = d2. But wait, in the problem statement, it's mentioned for every k, so does d change? Or is d constant?\n\nWait, hold on. The problem says the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. So for each k, it's an arithmetic subsequence, but does this mean that the common difference d is the same for all k? Or can it vary depending on k?\n\nHmm, the problem says it's an arithmetic sequence, so each of these subsequences is arithmetic, but it doesn't specify that the common difference is the same across different k. So, for k=1, the common difference is d1 = a3 - a2, and for k=2, the common difference is d2 ="

That complicates things a bit, but maybe there's a pattern that emerges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratios and differences follow a certain pattern, so that the sequence can be built recursively. Let me try to see.\n\nStarting with k=1:\n\nWe have a1, a2, a3 geometric, so a2 = r1 * a1, a3 = r1^2 * a1.\n\nThen, the arithmetic sequence a2, a3, a4 requires that a4 = 2a3 - a2. Because in an arithmetic sequence, the next term is twice the middle term minus the first term. So, a4 = 2a3 - a2.\n\nSubstituting the geometric terms:\n\na4 = 2*(r1^2 a1) - r1 a1 = (2 r1^2 - r1) a1.\n\nNow, moving to k=2, the geometric subsequence is a3, a4, a5. Since this is geometric, the ratio between a4 and a3 must be the same as between a5 and a4. Let me denote the ratio here as r2. So,\n\na4 = r2 * a3\n\na5 = r2 * a4 = r2^2 * a3\n\nBut from the previous step, a4 is (2 r1^2 - r1) a1, and a3 is r1^2 a1. Therefore,\n\nr2 = a4 / a3 = (2 r1^2 - r1) a1 / (r1^2 a1) ) = (2 r1^2 - r1)/ r1^2 = 2 - 1/r1.\n\nHmm, so r2 is expressed in terms of r1. Since r2 must be a rational number? Because the terms are integers. Wait, actually, the terms are positive integers, so the ratios must be rational? Or maybe integers?\n\nWait, the terms are positive integers, so the ratios must be rational numbers such that when multiplied by the previous term, they give integers. So, for example, if a1 is divisible by some denominator, but since the sequence is strictly increasing, the ratios must be greater than 1? Or maybe"

So, since a2 = r1 * a1 has to be an integer, r1 can be a rational number. But since the problem states it's a sequence of positive integers, r1 must be such that a1 multiplied by r1 is an integer, meaning r1 is a rational number, possibly a fraction or an integer.\n\nBut if r1 is a rational number, say p/q, then a2 would be a1*(p/q), so a1 must be divisible by q to make a2 an integer. Similarly, a3 would be a1*(p/q)^2, which would require a1 divisible by q^2.\n\nHmm, this complicates things a bit. Maybe an alternative approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that for the geometric sequences, the ratios are integers. That might make the problem easier because then the terms would also be integers since they are built by multiplication. So, maybe r1, r2, etc., are integers greater than 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says strictly increasing, so the ratios have to be at least 2, otherwise, the terms might not be increasing. Because if the ratio is 1, the terms are equal, which would not satisfy strictly increasing. If the ratio is less than 1, the terms would decrease, which again would not be strictly increasing. So, the ratios must be integers greater than or equal to 2.\n\nBut wait, the arithmetic sequences... Hmm.\n\nWait, for the arithmetic sequence, the common difference is d, which is a positive integer because the terms are strictly increasing. So, the term after a_{2k+1} is a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d. So, for each k, when we have a geometric sequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, the next term in the arithmetic sequence is a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d.\n\nBut since we have a geometric subsequence for a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, which is followed by an arithmetic progression, the next term is not a geometric progression, but rather an arithmetic"

So:\n\na2 = r1 * a1\n\na3 = r1^2 * a1\n\nThen, the arithmetic triplet starting at a2 (k=1) requires that a4 = 2*a3 - a2 = 2*r1^2*a1 - r1*a1 = (2r1^2 - r1)*a1\n\nNow, moving to k=2, the geometric triplet is a3, a4, a5.
