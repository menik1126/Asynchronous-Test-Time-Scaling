Specifically, it wants me to find:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r_5}}\n\\]\nwhere \\( r_1, \\overline{r_1}, r_2, \\overline{r_2}, \\) etc., are the roots of the equation, and the overline denotes complex conjugation.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\( r \\), the product \\( r \\overline{r} \\) is equal to \\( |r|^2 \\). So each term \\( \\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}} \\) is just the reciprocal of the square of the modulus of \\( r_i \\). Therefore, the sum we’re trying to compute is \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} \\).\n\nNow, the equation is a 10th-degree polynomial, so it has 10 roots, which are paired as \\( r_j \\) and \\( \\overline{r_j} \\) for \\( j = 1 \\) to 5. That makes sense because non-real roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs. So, for each of these 5 pairs, we have two roots: one and its conjugate.\n\nI also recall that for a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree \\( n \\), the product of all its roots is \\( (-1)^n \\times \\) the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. But in this case, we’re dealing with reciprocals of magnitudes squared, so maybe Vieta's formula will come into play, but I need to think about how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the modulus of each root could help. Since each \\( |r_i| \\) is the distance from the origin in the complex plane, and \\( |r_i|^2 = r_i \\overline{r_i} \\), maybe there's a way to relate this to"

Taking the 10th roots on both sides, we can write \\( x = \\omega \\cdot -(13x - 1) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a 10th root of unity. Wait, actually, more precisely, the solutions to \\( x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10} \\) are given by \\( x = \\omega \\cdot (13x -1) \\), multiplied by any 10th root of -1. Hmm, maybe I need to formalize this.\n\nLet me note that \\( x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10} \\implies \\left(\\frac{x}{13x -1}\\right)^{10} = -1 \\). So, \\( \\left(\\frac{x}{13x -1}\\right)^{10} = -1 \\).\n\nLet me let \\( z = \\frac{x}{13x - 1} \\). Then the equation becomes \\( z^{10} = -1 \\). So, all solutions are \\( z = e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, ..., 9 \\). Then, substituting back, we can write \\( \\frac{x}{13x -1} = e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10} \\), which can be rearranged to solve for x.\n\nLet me try solving for x here. Let me denote \\( \\omega_k = e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10} \\). So, \\( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} = \\omega_k \\). Cross-multiplying gives \\( x = \\omega_k (13x -1) \\).

But we have roots \\( r_1, \\overline{r_1}, ... \\), so complex roots come in pairs. The ones that are conjugate will correspond to \\( k \\) and \\( k' \\) such that \\( \\omega_{k'} = \\overline{\\omega_k} \\). So, for each \\( k \\), \\( \\omega_{10 - k} = \\overline{\\omega_k} \\) because \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) conjugate is \\( e^{-i\\theta} \\), which is \\( e^{i(2\\pi - \\theta)} \\). So, if \\( \\omega_k = e^{i\\theta_k} \\), then \\( \\omega_{10 -k} = e^{-i\\theta_k} \\).\n\nSo for each root \\( r_j \\), its conjugate is \\( r_{10 - j} \\). Therefore, the 10 roots correspond to \\( k=0 \\) to \\( k=9 \\), with \\( r_j \\) and \\( r_{10 - j} \\) being a pair. Since we have 5 such pairs, our \\( r_1, r_2, ..., r_5 \\) correspond to \\( k=0 \\) to \\( k=4 \\), and each has a conjugate in \\( k=10 -j \\). But in the problem, they refer to 5 roots and their conjugates, so probably the equation has 10 roots, 5 distinct pairs.\n\nSo, each r_j can be written as \\( x_j = \\frac{ - \\omega_j }{1 -13 \\omega_j } \\), and the conjugate \\( \\overline{r_j} = x_{10 - j} \\), but since our polynomial has real coefficients, their product is related.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.

Therefore, this must hold for each root.\n\nBut if |x|=|13x -1|, then geometrically, on the complex plane, the point x must lie on the set of points equidistant from the origin and from the point (1/13, 0). Because 13x -1 =0 would give x=1/13, so if you consider 13x -1, it's like scaling x by13 and shifting by -1.\n\nWait, so imagine in the complex plane, 13x -1 is scaling by13 and then shifting by -1.
