The problem is asking me to find the sum of the reciprocals of the product of each root and its conjugate. Specifically, I need to compute:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3 \\overline{r}_3} + \\frac{1}{r_4 \\overline{r}_4} + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}} \\) is the reciprocal of the squared modulus of \\(r\\). That is, it's \\( \\left| \\frac{1}{r} \\right|^2 \\).\n\nBut I don't know if that helps directly. Maybe I can think about the equation itself. The equation is of the form \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). That seems similar to a polynomial equation where the coefficients might be related in some way.\n\nSince all roots come in conjugate pairs, the roots satisfy the equation and their conjugates also satisfy the equation. So, if \\(r\\) is a root, then \\(\\overline{r}\\) is also a root. Therefore, the polynomial has real coefficients? Wait, let's check.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Let me expand this or think about its coefficients. Let's denote \\(P(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\).\n\nI need to check if \\(P(\\overline"

Since if \\(r\\) is a root, then if we take the conjugate of the entire equation:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{P(r)} = \\overline{r}^{10} + (13 \\overline{r} - 1)^{10} = \\overline{r}^{10} + \\overline{(13 \\overline{r} - 1)}^{10} = \\overline{r}^{10} + (13 \\overline{r} - 1)^{10}\n\\]\n\nWhich is exactly \\(P(\\overline{r})\\). Since \\(r\\) is a root, \\(P(r) = 0\\), so \\(\\overline{r}\\) is also a root. Therefore, this polynomial has real coefficients. Therefore, the coefficients are real numbers, which is important because it tells me that the complex roots come in conjugate pairs, just as given.\n\nNow, the expression I need to compute is the sum of reciprocals of the squared modulus of each root. Or, in other words, the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\), for each pair \\(i\\).\n\nI remember that in complex analysis, for a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) with roots \\(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n\\), the sum over the reciprocals of the squared modulus can be related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Specifically, if I can express this sum in terms of the coefficients, I can compute it without knowing the exact roots.\n\nAlternatively, I might consider using Vieta's formulas or some other polynomial properties.\n\nWait, first, let me consider the given equation:\n\n\\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\)\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\\)\n\nTaking the 10th root on both sides (but remembering that complex roots are multi-valued, so I need to be careful here). Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio of x to (13x - 1).

The 10th roots of -1 can be expressed as the 20th roots of unity at specific positions. Let me check.\n\nThe 10th roots of -1: as previously mentioned, each is e^{i π(1 + 2k)/10} for k=0,1,...,9.\n\nBut e^{i θ} = e^{i(θ + 2π n)} for integer n.

However, the roots ω_k are the roots of the equation (x/(13x -1))^{10} = -1, so the equation for ω is ω^{10} = -1, so the equation is ω^{10} +1 =0. Wait, no, actually, the equation for ω is ω^{10} = -1, so the equation is ω^{10} +1 =0. Therefore, the sum of all roots ω_k is equal to the negative of the coefficient of ω^9 divided by the coefficient of ω^{10}, which is 0, since the equation is ω^{10} +1 =0. Therefore, the sum of all roots ω_k is 0.\n\nTherefore, Sum_{k=0}^9 ω_k =0.\n\nTherefore, the real part of this sum is also zero. Therefore,\n\nSum_{k=0}^9 Re(ω_k) = Re( Sum_{k=0}^9 ω_k ) = Re(0) =0.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the real parts is zero.\n\nTherefore, going back to the previous expression:\n\nSum_{k=0}^9 |13 ω_k -1|^2 = 1700 -26 * 0 = 1700.\n\nTherefore, the total sum over all roots of 1/|r_k|^2 is Sum_{k=0}^9 |13 ω_k -1|^2 =1700.\n\nWait, no, actually, wait:\n\nWait, earlier, we had:\n\n1/|r_k|^2 = |13 ω_k -1|^2, so the total sum over all roots (each root's reciprocal squared modulus) is Sum_{k=0}^9 |13 ω_k -1|^2 =1700.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sum over each pair once, so the required sum is half of that, since each pair contributes twice.

But the problem is asking for the sum over each pair once, which is 5 pairs, each contributing the same value? Or is it 5 terms, each being |13 ω_k -1|^2 for a unique ω_k?\n\nWait, actually, the 10 roots are r1, \\overline{r}_1, r2, \\overline{r}_2, etc. So, in total, 10 roots, each corresponding to a unique ω_k.\n\nBut wait, each term in the required sum is 1/( r_j \\overline{r}_j ) = |13 ω_j -1|^2 for each r_j.\n\nBut since each pair contributes once, so from the 10 roots, each pair is counted once. So, actually, the required sum is equal to Sum_{k=0}^9 |13 ω_k -1|^2, but since each pair gives the same term, but there are 5 such pairs.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the equation reduces to ω^{10} = -1, so each ω_k is a 10th root of -1. Therefore, for each pair, we have two roots: ω and its conjugate, which are different unless ω is real. But in this case, ω's are on the unit circle, none are real except possibly when the angle is 0 or π, but ω^10 = -1, so none are real except the case ω=-1, but that is just one root.\n\nWait, let me see: When k=5, ω_5 = e^{i π(1 + 2*5)/10} = e^{i π(11)/10} = e^{i π + i π/10} = -e^{i π/10}, which is a real number?

The only real roots would be when the angle is π, which would be when (1 + 2k)/10 =1 mod 2, so (1 +2k)/10 = odd integer. Wait, but 1 +2k must be 10, but 10 is even, so no. So, actually, none of the roots are real. Therefore, all roots come in conjugate pairs. Therefore, the 10 roots are 5 pairs of complex conjugates.\n\nTherefore, the sum over all roots of 1/(r \\overline{r}) is equal to the sum over all roots of |13 ω -1|^2, which is 1700. But since each pair contributes two terms which are equal (because |13 ω -1|^2 and |13 \\overline{ω} -1|^2 are equal), so the total sum over all roots is 2*(sum over each pair once). Therefore, the required sum is 1700 divided by 2, which is 850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850, so boxed, \\boxed{850}.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again.\n\nWait, let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have a quadratic equation with roots r and \\overline{r}. Then, the sum 1/(r \\overline{r}) would be 1/|r|^2. The total over all roots would be 1/|r|^2 + 1/|\\overline{r}|^2 = 2/|r|^2. Therefore, the required sum (which is just 1/|r|^2) would be half of the total. So yes, in this case, the same logic applies.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, since there are 10 roots, each pair contributes twice the same term, so the total over all roots is 2*(sum over the 5 terms). Therefore, the required sum is 1700 /2 = 850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again for Sum_{k"
