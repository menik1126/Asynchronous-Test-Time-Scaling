It says that this equation has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The problem is asking me to find the sum of the reciprocals of the product of each root and its conjugate. Specifically, I need to compute:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3 \\overline{r}_3} + \\frac{1}{r_4 \\overline{r}_4} + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}} \\) is the reciprocal of the squared modulus of \\(r\\). That is, it's \\( \\left| \\frac{1}{r} \\right|^2 \\).\n\nBut I don't know if that helps directly. Maybe I can think about the equation itself. The equation is of the form \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). That seems similar to a polynomial equation where the coefficients might be related in some way.\n\nSince all roots come in conjugate pairs, the roots satisfy the equation and their conjugates also satisfy the equation. So, if \\(r\\) is a root, then \\(\\overline{r}\\) is also a root. Therefore, the polynomial has real coefficients? Wait, let's check.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Let me expand this or think about its coefficients. Let's denote \\(P(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\).\n\nI need to check if \\(P(\\overline"

Since if \\(r\\) is a root, then if we take the conjugate of the entire equation:\n\n\\[\n\\overline{P(r)} = \\overline{r}^{10} + (13 \\overline{r} - 1)^{10} = \\overline{r}^{10} + \\overline{(13 \\overline{r} - 1)}^{10} = \\overline{r}^{10} + (13 \\overline{r} - 1)^{10}\n\\]\n\nWhich is exactly \\(P(\\overline{r})\\). Since \\(r\\) is a root, \\(P(r) = 0\\), so \\(\\overline{r}\\) is also a root. Therefore, this polynomial has real coefficients. Therefore, the coefficients are real numbers, which is important because it tells me that the complex roots come in conjugate pairs, just as given.\n\nNow, the expression I need to compute is the sum of reciprocals of the squared modulus of each root. Or, in other words, the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\), for each pair \\(i\\).\n\nI remember that in complex analysis, for a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) with roots \\(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n\\), the sum over the reciprocals of the squared modulus can be related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Specifically, if I can express this sum in terms of the coefficients, I can compute it without knowing the exact roots.\n\nAlternatively, I might consider using Vieta's formulas or some other polynomial properties.\n\nWait, first, let me consider the given equation:\n\n\\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\)\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\\)\n\nTaking the 10th root on both sides (but remembering that complex roots are multi-valued, so I need to be careful here). Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio of x to (13x - 1). Let me think about this.\n\nSuppose I write the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{x}{13x - 1}\\right)^{10} = -1\n\\]\n\nIs that correct? Let"

Wait, no, actually, the equation for \u03c9 is \u03c9^{10} = -1, so the equation is \u03c9^{10} +1 =0. Therefore, the sum of all roots \u03c9_k is equal to the negative of the coefficient of \u03c9^9 divided by the coefficient of \u03c9^{10}, which is 0, since the equation is \u03c9^{10} +1 =0.

But in this case, \u03c9's are on the unit circle, none are real except possibly when the angle is 0 or \u03c0, but \u03c9^10 = -1, so none are real except the case \u03c9=-1, but that is just one root.\n\nWait, let me see: When k=5, \u03c9_5 = e^{i \u03c0(1 + 2*5)/10} = e^{i \u03c0(11)/10} = e^{i \u03c0 + i \u03c0/10} = -e^{i \u03c0/10}, which is a real number?

The only real roots would be when the angle is \u03c0, which would be when (1 + 2k)/10 =1 mod 2, so (1 +2k)/10 = odd integer. Wait, but 1 +2k must be 10, but 10 is even, so no. So, actually, none of the roots are real. Therefore, all roots come in conjugate pairs. Therefore, the 10 roots are 5 pairs of complex conjugates.\n\nTherefore, the sum over all roots of 1/(r \\overline{r}) is equal to the sum over all roots of |13 \u03c9 -1|^2, which is 1700. But since each pair contributes two terms which are equal (because |13 \u03c9 -1|^2 and |13 \\overline{\u03c9} -1|^2 are equal), so the total sum over all roots is 2*(sum over each pair once). Therefore, the required sum is 1700 divided by 2, which is 850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850, so boxed, \\boxed{850}.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again.\n\nWait, let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have a quadratic equation with roots r and \\overline{r}. Then, the sum 1/(r \\overline{r}) would be 1/|r|^2. The total over all roots would be 1/|r|^2 + 1/|\\overline{r}|^2 = 2/|r|^2. Therefore, the required sum (which is just 1/|r|^2) would be half of the total. So yes, in this case, the same logic applies.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, since there are 10 roots, each pair contributes twice the same term, so the total over all roots is 2*(sum over the 5 terms). Therefore, the required sum is 1700 /2 = 850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again for Sum_{k"
