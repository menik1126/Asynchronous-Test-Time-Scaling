The 12th grade's ratio is closest to this target, with a difference of 0.05. The 11th grade, with a difference of 0.11, is the next closest. The other grades have larger differences, making them less suitable.\n\nTherefore, the 12th grade has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the female bus riders.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to being \\( 135\\% \\) of the number of female bus riders, let's analyze each grade step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Given Data\nThe table provides the percentage of bus riders for both males and females in each grade. Since \\( 300 \\) males and \\( 300 \\) females were surveyed in each grade, we can calculate the actual number of bus riders by multiplying the percentages by \\( 300 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Bus Riders\nFor each grade, the number of male (\\( M \\)) and female (\\( F \\)) bus riders can be calculated as:\n\\[\nM = \\text{Percentage of males} \\times 300\n\\]\n\\[\nF = \\text{Percentage of females} \\times 300\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Required Ratios\nWe need to find the grade where:\n\\[\n\\frac{M}{F} = 1.35\n\\]\nThis means:\n\\[\n"
