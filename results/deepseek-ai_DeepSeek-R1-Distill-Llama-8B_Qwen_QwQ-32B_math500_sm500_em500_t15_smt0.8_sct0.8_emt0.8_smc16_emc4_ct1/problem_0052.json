Since there are 300 males and 300 females surveyed in each grade, I'll multiply the given percentages by their respective totals.\n\nFor the 9th grade:\nMales = 41.1% * 300 = 123.3\nFemales = 39.4% * 300 = 118.2\nMale percentage of females = (123.3 / 118.2) * 100 ≈ 103.8%\n\nFor the 10th grade:\nMales = 34.4% * 300 = 103.2\nFemales = 33.1% * 300 = 99.3\nMale percentage of females = (103.2 / 99.3) * 100 ≈ 103.7%\n\nFor the 11th grade:\nMales = 20.6% * 300 = 61.8\nFemales = 13.8% * 300 = 41.4\nMale percentage of females = (61.8 / 41.4) * 100 ≈ 149.0%\n\nFor the 12th grade:\nMales = 11.6% * 300 = 34.8\nFemales = 8.6% * 300 = 25.8\nMale percentage of females = (34.8 / 25.8) * 100 ≈ 134.5%\n\nComparing the percentages:\n- 9th grade: 103.8% (too low)\n- 10th grade: 103.7% (too low)\n- 11th grade: 149.0% (too high)\n- 12th grade: 134.5% (closer to 135%)\n\nThe 12th grade is the closest to having male bus riders equal to 135% of the female riders.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to **135%** of the number of female bus riders. Let's analyze each grade step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Data:**\n   - The table provides the percentage of male and female bus riders for each grade.\n   - In each grade, **300 males and 300"
