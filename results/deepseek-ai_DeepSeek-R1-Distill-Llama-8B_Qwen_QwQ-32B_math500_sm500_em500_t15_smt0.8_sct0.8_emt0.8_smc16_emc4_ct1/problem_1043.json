The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots. Hmm, I remember there's something called the Rational Root Theorem that might help here. Let me try to recall.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. Right, so in this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. \n\nSo, let's break that down. The constant term is 1. Its factors are just ±1. The leading coefficient is 2, so its factors are ±1 and ±2. Therefore, any possible rational root must have a numerator that's a factor of 1 and a denominator that's a factor of 2. \n\nPutting that together, the possible values for \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) are:\n- For \\(p = 1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{1}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{-1}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{-2}\\)\n- For \\(p = -1\\): \\(\\frac{-1}{1}\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{-1}\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{-2}\\)\n\nBut wait, some of these fractions might be equivalent. Let me list them all out and eliminate duplicates:\n1. \\(1/1 = 1\\)\n2. \\(1/(-1) = -1\\)\n3. \\(1/2 = 0.5\\)\n4. \\(1/(-2) = -0.5\\)\n5. \\(-1/1 = -1\\) (duplicate of number 2)\n6. \\(-1/(-1) = 1\\) (duplicate of number 1)\n7. \\(-1/2 = -0.5\\) (duplicate of number 4)\n8. \\(-1/(-2) = 0.5\\) (duplicate of number"

That's four different possible rational roots.\n\nLet me make sure I haven't missed any other possibilities. The numerator must divide the constant term 1, so only ±1 are possible for numerator. The denominator must divide the leading coefficient 2, so ±1 and ±2. Therefore, when combining all possible numerators and denominators, the possible fractions are as I listed. No others.\n\nIs there any chance that I might have missed a combination? For example, could the denominator be something else? Well, no. The leading coefficient is 2, so denominators can only be 1 or 2, or their negatives. But when we write fractions in lowest terms, denominators shouldn't have common factors with the numerator, so any negative signs would be accounted for in the numerator.\n\nTherefore, after considering all factors, the unique possible rational roots are indeed 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2. That gives four different possibilities.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different possible rational roots is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + 1 = 0\\), we use the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this polynomial:\n- The constant term is 1, so the factors of the constant term are \\( \\pm 1 \\).\n- The leading coefficient is 2, so the factors of the leading coefficient are \\( \\pm 1 \\) and \\( \\pm 2 \\).\n\nConsidering all possible fractions \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) where \\(p\\) is a factor of 1 and \\(q\\) is a factor of 2, we get the following possible rational roots:\n- For \\(p = 1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{1}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{-1}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{-2}\\)\n-"
