The coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) are integers, but I don't know their specific values. The question is asking me to find the number of different possible rational roots for this polynomial. Hmm, I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem, so maybe that's what I need to use here.\n\nLet me recall what the Rational Root Theorem says. It states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. So, in this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. \n\nFirst, I need to find all the possible values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). For the constant term, which is 1, the factors are just \\(\\pm1\\). For the leading coefficient, which is 2, the factors are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\). So, the possible values for \\(p\\) are 1 and -1, and the possible values for \\(q\\) are 1, 2, -1, and -2.\n\nWait, but since we are looking for rational roots in their lowest terms, \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) must be expressed with \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) having no common factors besides 1. So, even though 2 has factors like -2, when I combine it with \\(p\\), I need to make sure that the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nLet me list out all the possible candidates for the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator (p): ±1\n\nDenominator (q): ±1, ±2\n\nBut since we can have positive and negative roots, each of these fractions will have both positive and negative versions. However, maybe I should first figure out all possible unique fractions and then consider their signs.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nFor each p (1, -1) and q (1, 2), the possible fractions are:\n\n- \\(1/1 = 1\\)\n- \\(1/2 = 0.5\\)\n- \\(-1/"

For example, \\(1/(-1) = -1\\), which is already covered, and \\(1/(-2) = -1/2\\), which is also covered. Similarly for the negative numerator. So actually, considering all combinations, the distinct possible rational roots are ±1 and ±1/2. \n\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2. That gives four different possible rational roots. But wait, the question says \"different possible rational roots of this polynomial\". But hold on, the coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) can be any integers. So, does that mean that each of these roots could actually be a root for some choice of coefficients?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to check if all these possibilities are indeed achievable. Let me think. The Rational Root Theorem gives the possible candidates, but not all of them might be actual roots depending on the coefficients. However, the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots, meaning how many different rational numbers could be roots for some set of coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\). So, I need to see if each of these four candidates can actually be a root for some integer coefficients.\n\nLet me test each one. Let's start with 1. Suppose 1 is a root. Then plugging into the polynomial:\n\n\\(2(1)^4 + a_3(1)^3 + a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) + 1 = 0\\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + 1 = 0 ⇒ a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = -3\n\nSince \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) are integers, this equation is possible. For example, set \\(a_3 = 0\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = -3\\). So yes, 1 can be a root.\n\nSimilarly, let's check -1. Plugging in -1:\n\n\\(2(-1)^4 + a_3(-"

            "output": "1)^3 + a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) + 1 = 0\\)\n\nCalculates to:\n\n2(1) + a_3(-1) + a_2(1) + a_1(-1) + 1 = 0 ⇒ 2 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 + 1 = 0 ⇒ (-a_3 + a_2 - a_1) = -3\n\nAgain, integers can satisfy this. For instance, set \\(a_3 = 1\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = 2\\), which gives -1 + 0 - 2 = -3. So yeah, -1 can be a root.\n\nNow, 1/2. Let's see if 1/2 can be a root.\n\nPlugging in 1/2:\n\n\\(2(1/2)^4 + a_3(1/2)^3 + a_2(1/2)^2 + a_1(1/2) + 1 = 0\\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\n\na_3*(1/8)\n\na_2*(1/4)\n\na_1*(1/2)\n\n1 is just 1.\n\nSo, putting together:\n\n1/8 + a_3/8 + a_2/4 + a_1/2 + 1 = 0\n\nMultiply through by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a_3 + 2a_2 + 4a_1 + 8 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\na_3 + 2a_2 + 4a_1 = -9\n\nSo, can we find integers \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) such that this equation holds? Yes, for example:\n\nLet me pick a_3 = 0, then 2a_2 + 4a_1 = -9.\n\nThis is possible, because 2a_2 = -9 - 4a_1. Since -9 is odd and 4a_1 is even, 2a_2 would be odd, which isn't possible because 2a_2 is even. Wait, that's a problem. Hmm, maybe I need to pick different values.\n\n"

So, if a_3 is odd, then 2a_2 would be even minus odd, which is odd, but 2a_2 must be even. So, maybe pick a_3 even.\n\nLet me pick a_3 = -9, then 2a_2 = -9 - (-9) = 0 ⇒ a_2 = 0.\n\nSo, set a_3 = -9, a_2 = 0, a_1 = 0.

Therefore, -1/2 can also be a root.\n\nHence, all four candidates: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2 can be rational roots for this polynomial with suitable integer coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nWait, but let me think once more. The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots. But depending on the coefficients, some of these might not be roots, but the question is about possibilities, not actual roots. So, if it's possible for each of these four to be roots, then the number is four.\n\nAlternatively, if the polynomial was specific, like if leading coefficient was 1, we would have more specific roots, but here leading coefficient is 2, so 1 and -1 are possible, and 1/2 and -1/2 as well.\n\nThus, I think the answer is four.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different possible rational roots is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\) with integer coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\), we use the Rational Root Theorem.
