            "output": "First, I need to define variables for the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let’s let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles. I can express this relationship with the equation B/Y = 4/3.\n\nTo find the ratio in its simplest form, I'll cross-multiply to get 3B = 4Y. This implies that Y = (3/4)B.\n\nNext, I'll apply the second condition provided. After adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3. So, the new number of blue marbles is B + 5, and the new number of yellow marbles is Y - 3.\n\nSetting up the new ratio equation: (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3. Cross-multiplying gives 3(B + 5) = 7(Y - 3).\n\nExpanding both sides: 3B + 15 = 7Y - 21. I'll rearrange the equation to group like terms together: 3B - 7Y = -36.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n1. Y = (3/4)B\n2. 3B - 7Y = -36\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second gives: 3B - 7*(3/4)B = -36. Simplifying, 3B - (21/4)B = -36, which becomes (12/4 - 21/4)B = -36, so (-9/4)B = -36.\n\nSolving for B: (-9/4)B = -36 => B = (-36)*(-4/9) = 16.\n\nFinally, I'll find Y using the initial ratio: Y = (3/4)*16 = 12. So, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag initially.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of blue marbles initially.\n- Let \\( Y \\) be the number of yellow marbles initially.\n\n**Step "
