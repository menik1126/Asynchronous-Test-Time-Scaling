Multiplying both the numerator and denominator by this conjugate:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expand the Numerator:**\n   \n   Apply the distributive property (FOIL method):\n   \\[\n   (-3)(1) + (-3)(-2i) + (4i)(1) + (4i)(-2i)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = -3 + 6i + 4i - 8i^2\n   \\]\n   Since \\(i^2 = -1\\):\n   \\[\n   = -3 + 10i + 8 = 5 + 10i\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expand the Denominator:**\n   \n   \\[\n   (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - 4i^2 = 1 - (-4) = 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{5 + 10i}{5} = 1 + 2i\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1 + 2i}\n   \\]"
