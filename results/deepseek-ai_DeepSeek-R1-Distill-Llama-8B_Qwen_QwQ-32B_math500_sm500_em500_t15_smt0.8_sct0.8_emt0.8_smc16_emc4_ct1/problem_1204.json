The direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, okay, so I think this means that the line has a slope of \\( -7 \\) over \\( b \\), right? Because the direction vector tells us how the line changes in the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) directions.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote figure provided, it's a coordinate plane with points A, B, L, and R. Point A is at (-5,4), and point B is at (-1,3). The line AB is drawn, and I can see that it extends from point L on the left side of the y-axis to point R on the right side. Points L and R are where the line AB intersects the vertical lines \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\), respectively, but specifically at \\( y = 0 \\). Wait, no, actually, in the code, it says `draw(L--R, red);` and the extensions are from `(-8,0)` to `(-8,1)` and `(8,0)` to `(8,1)`. So maybe L and R are the points where the line AB intersects the horizontal lines \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\)? Or is it \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( y = 8 \\)?\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, the code uses `extension(A, B, (-8,0), (-8,1))` and similarly for R. So the extension function in Asymptote finds the point where line AB intersects a vertical line. So for L, it's the intersection with \\( x = -8 \\), \\( y \\) between 0 and 1. Similarly, R is the intersection with \\( x = 8 \\), \\( y \\) between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, the line passes through points L and R, which are on \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\), but their \\( y \\)-coordinates are somewhere between 0 and 1. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I need to figure out the slope first.\n\nGiven points A(-5,4) and B"

The direction vector from A to B is the difference in coordinates: \\( B - A = (-1 - (-5), 3 - 4) = (4, -1) \\). So the direction vector is \\( (4, -1) \\). Wait, but the problem states that the direction vector is \\( (-7, b) \\). So are these supposed to be scalar multiples of each other?\n\nAh yes! Because direction vectors that represent the same line can be scalar multiples. Therefore, if the line is parameterized, the direction vector can be any scalar multiple. Therefore, \\( (4, -1) \\) and \\( (-7, b) \\) must be scalar multiples. So, there exists some scalar \\( k \\) such that:\n\n\\( 4 = k * (-7) \\),\n\\( -1 = k * b \\).\n\nTherefore, solving for \\( k \\) from the first equation: \\( k = 4 / (-7) = -4/7 \\). \n\nThen substitute into the second equation: \\( -1 = (-4/7) * b \\).\nMultiply both sides by -7/4: \\( b = (-1) * (-7/4) = 7/4 \\).\n\nWait a second... So would \\( b = 7/4 \\)? But let me check my steps again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the slope. The direction vector (4, -1) corresponds to a slope of \u0394y/\u0394x = -1/4. However, the direction vector given is (-7, b), which would give a slope of b / (-7). Since the slope must be the same, set them equal:\n\nSlope from A to B: \\( (3 - 4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) \\). \n\nTherefore slope is -1/4. \n\nSo the slope using direction vector (-7, b) is b / (-7) = -b/7.\n\nSet equal to -1/4:\n\n- b / 7 = -1/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 7:\n\n- b = -7/4 => b = 7/4.\n\nOkay, so that's the same answer. So maybe that's correct. \n\nWait but in the Asymptote code, the line is drawn between L and R,"

So perhaps I can compute the equation of line AB and then compute L and R as ( -8, y_L ) and (8, y_R ), but given the direction vector, maybe I can find the slope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the parametric equations.\n\nWait, the direction vector is (-7, b), so the line can be parameterized as starting at some point and moving in increments of -7 in x and b in y. But since it's a line, the parametrization is based on a direction vector. So maybe the entire line has that direction vector?\n\nWait, actually, the direction vector is for the parametrization, so for any point on the line, moving by t in the direction vector gets you another point on the line. So, if the direction vector is (-7, b), the line passes through points like (x, y), (x -7, y + b), etc.\n\nBut in our case, the line passes through points A and B, so it's the same line as A-B. Therefore, the direction vector of A-B must be a scalar multiple of the direction vector given. Which is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, with points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3), the vector AB is (4, -1). So direction vector (4,-1) is a scalar multiple of (-7, b). So 4 = k*(-7), -1 = k*b. So k= -4/7, so b= (-1)/(k)= (-1)/(-4/7)=7/4.\n\nTherefore, b=7/4.\n\nBut wait, let's check if the slope is indeed the same.\n\nSlope using AB is (3-4)/(-1 - (-5))= (-1)/(4)= -1/4.\n\nSlope using direction vector (-7, 7/4): slope is (7/4)/(-7) = -1/4, same as above.\n\nSo yes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the parametric equations.\n\nParametrize the line AB. Let me let t be a parameter. Let me set point A as a base point, then:\n\nx(t) = x_A + t*(direction vector x-component)\nSimilarly, y(t)= y_A + t*("

So if the direction vector is (-7, b), then the direction vector must be a scalar multiple of (4, -1). So, as before, the direction vector (-7, b) must be a scalar multiple of (4, -1). So, the ratio between the components must be the same.\n\nSo, -7 / 4 = b / (-1). Cross multiplying: (-7)(-1) = 4b => 7 =4b => b=7/4. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the answer.

Let me compute the equation.\n\nFirst, slope m = (3-4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4, as before.\n\nSo the equation is y - y1 = m(x - x1). Let's use point A(-5,4):\n\ny -4 = (-1/4)(x +5)\n\nSo, y = (-1/4)x -5/4 +4\n\nConvert 4 to 16/4, so 16/4 -5/4 = 11/4.

Alternatively, maybe the line AB is actually the same as line LR, but line LR is only a segment between x=-8, y=0 to x=8, y=0, but in the code, it's drawn between (-8,0) and (8,0), but in the code, it's actually drawn as red between L and R, which are on x=-8 and x=8, but y=0 and y=1.\n\nWait, perhaps the line is crossing x=-8 and x=8 at y=0 and y=1, but my calculation is not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the parametric equations.\n\nLine AB: points A(-5,4), B(-1,3).

But according to the Asymptote code, the extension is between (-8,0) and (-8,1). So that would mean that the line AB does not intersect the vertical line x=-8 between y=0 and y=1. So perhaps the red line is not the line AB, but another line?\n\nWait, hold on. The Asymptote code says:\n\ndraw(L--R, red);\n\nwhere L is extension(A,B, (-8,0), (-8,1)), which is the intersection of line AB with the segment from (-8,0) to (-8,1). But since the line AB intersects x=-8 at y=19/4\u22484.75, which is outside the segment between y=0 and y=1, then the extension function might not find an intersection there? Wait, but the extension function in Asymptote is supposed to find the intersection of two lines, even if it's not on the segments. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the parameters.\n\nWait, the extension function in Asymptote takes two lines and finds their intersection. The first line is AB, and the second line is the line through (-8,0) and (-8,1), which is the vertical line x=-8. So the intersection point is indeed at ( -8, 19/4 ), but since the second line is just the vertical line x=-8, the intersection is that point. However, the Asymptote code might be drawing the red line between L and R, which are those two points, but in the drawing, they might be clipped or something. But regardless, the line AB is the same as the red line.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the line is parameterized with direction vector (-7, b). So the line in question is the red line, which is line AB. Therefore, the direction vector is indeed the same as AB's direction vector, so the calculation should hold.\n\nBut then why does the Asymptote code have points L and R at x=-8 and x=8 with y between 0 and 1?"
