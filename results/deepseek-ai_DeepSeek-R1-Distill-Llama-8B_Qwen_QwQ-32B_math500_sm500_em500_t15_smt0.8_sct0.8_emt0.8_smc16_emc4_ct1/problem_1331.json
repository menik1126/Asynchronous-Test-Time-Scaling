The problem is asking for the sum of all complex solutions. That means I need to find all the roots of this equation and then add them up. But before I jump into solving it, maybe I can simplify it somehow.\n\nLooking at the left-hand side, it's a sum of fractions with denominators that are quadratic. Each denominator is of the form \\(x^2 - n\\), where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. Each term has a coefficient that's increasing by 1: 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe there's a way to combine these fractions or find a common structure.\n\nWait, another thought. The equation is equal to a linear expression on the right-hand side, \\(2010x - 4\\). That suggests that the left-hand side, which is a sum of rational expressions, equals a linear term. So perhaps I can consider bringing all terms to one side and setting it equal to zero.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but this seems quite complicated because of the multiple denominators. Maybe I can find a substitution to simplify it. If I let \\(y = x^2\\), then each denominator becomes \\(y - 1\\), \\(y - 2\\), \\(y - 3\\), \\(y - 4\\). But the numerator coefficients are 1, 2, 3, 4. That makes me think of the derivative or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about combining the fractions on the left-hand side. To do that, I would need a common denominator, which would be the product of all the denominators, but that would lead to a very high-degree polynomial. That"

But that would also lead to a high-degree equation. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe notice that each term on the left has a denominator of \\(x^2 - k\\), so if I let \\(x^2 = t\\), then each term becomes \\(\\frac{k}{t - k}\\) for k from 1 to 4. Wait, actually, the first term is 1/(x\u00b2 -1), so that would be 1/(t -1), the second term is 2/(t -2), etc. So the left-hand side can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^4 \\frac{k}{t - k} = 2010x -4\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(t = x^2\\). Hmm, so substituting \\(t = x^2\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{t - 1} + \\frac{2}{t - 2} + \\frac{3}{t - 3} + \\frac{4}{t - 4} = 2010x -4.\n\\]\n\nBut now, the left side is in terms of t, and the right side is in terms of x. Since \\(t = x^2\\), maybe I can write the equation as:\n\n\\[\nf(t) = 2010x -4\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(f(t)\\) is the sum of those fractions. But since t is \\(x^2\\), this is a relation between x and t. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the left-hand side is a function of \\(x^2\\), so perhaps the equation is symmetric in some way? But the right-hand side is linear in x, so it's not symmetric. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the equation is of the form:\n\nLeft side (even function in x, since it's in terms of x\u00b2) equals right side (odd function in x, since it's linear in x).

Wait, 4/(x\u00b2 -4) when x=2 is 4/(4-4)= division by zero. So x=2 is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, x= sqrt(3), x= -sqrt(3): the term 3/(x\u00b2 -3) would be undefined. Similarly, x= sqrt(4)=2, which is already excluded. So x=0 is a valid solution, but x= \u00b11, \u00b1sqrt(2), \u00b1sqrt(3), \u00b12 are excluded because denominators become zero.\n\nSo perhaps x=0 is the only real solution?

Wait, but since we are considering complex solutions, perhaps u can be complex as well. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the original equation as a function f(x) = left side - right side =0, and the sum of roots is the sum of all x such that f(x)=0. Since f(x) is a polynomial of degree 9, the sum is - (coefficient of x^8)/(coefficient of x^9).\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in the polynomial equation A(x) - B(x) =0, then I can find the sum.\n\nLet me try to compute the leading terms of A(x) and B(x).\n\nFirst, B(x) = (2010x -4)*D(x), where D(x) is (x\u00b2 -1)(x\u00b2 -2)(x\u00b2 -3)(x\u00b2 -4). Let me compute the leading term of D(x):\n\nEach (x\u00b2 -k) has leading term x\u00b2, so multiplying four of them gives x^8. Therefore, D(x) has leading term x^8. Therefore, B(x) has leading term (2010x)*(x^8) =2010x^9. The next term in D(x) would be the sum of the coefficients from each (x\u00b2 -k). Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, to compute the coefficient of x^8 in D(x):\n\nThe expansion of D(x) = (x\u00b2 -1)(x\u00b2 -"

The coefficient of x^8 is 1*1*1*1 =1, and the coefficient of x^7 is -(1 +2 +3 +4)= -10.\n\nWait, that might be helpful.\n\nTherefore, D(x) = x^8 -10x^7 +35x^6 -50x^5 +24x^4 + ... (lower terms).\n\nSimilarly, the leading term of B(x) is 2010x * x^8 =2010x^9, and the next term is 2010x*(-10x^7) = -20100x^8.\n\nNow, looking at A(x). A(x) is the sum of four terms:\n\n1*(y -2)(y -3)(y -4) + 2*(y -1)(y -3)(y -4) + 3*(y -1)(y -2)(y -4) +4*(y -1)(y -2)(y -3),\n\nwhere y = x\u00b2.\n\nEach term is a product of three quadratics, so each term is a degree 6 polynomial. Therefore, each term in A(x) is degree 6, so when expanded, the leading term is x^6.\n\nBut since we are interested in the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in A(x) - B(x), which is 0, we need to see if A(x) contributes any x^9 or x^8 terms.\n\nLooking at A(x): each term is a product of three quadratics, so when expanded, the highest degree is x^6. Therefore, A(x) has terms only up to x^6. Therefore, A(x) does not contribute to x^9 or x^8.\n\nOn the other hand, B(x) is a polynomial of degree 9, with leading term 2010x^9. So when subtracting B(x) from A(x), the resulting polynomial will have a leading term of -2010x^9, and the next term would be the coefficient of x^8 in B(x), which is -20100x^8.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nB(x) = (2010x -4) * D(x).\n\nD(x) has leading term x^8, and next term -10x^7.\n\nTherefore,"
