Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the equation has four rational terms on the left side, each of which has a similar structure: something over \\(x^2 - k\\), where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Maybe there's a way to simplify this or find a pattern.\n\nAlso, the right side is a linear function in \\(x\\), which is pretty straightforward. Maybe if I can manipulate the left side into a form that I can compare to the right side, I can find a solution. \n\nI remember that sometimes, when dealing with equations involving reciprocals of quadratic expressions, partial fractions can be useful. Maybe I can decompose each fraction into simpler parts. But before I dive into that, let me see if there's another approach.\n\nLooking at the denominators, \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), etc., these can be factored:\n\n- \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\)\n- \\(x^2 - 2\\) doesn't factor nicely over real numbers.\n- Similarly, \\(x^2 - 3\\) and \\(x^2 - 4\\) also don't factor over the reals.\n\nSo, partial fractions might involve complex numbers since the denominators are irreducible over the reals. Wait, the problem mentions complex solutions, so maybe I should consider that.\n\nBut before partial fractions, perhaps it's better to bring everything to one side and set the equation to zero. Let me write that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHmm, combining these terms doesn't seem straightforward because of the different denomin"

The common denominator would be the product of all these denominators, which is going to be a huge polynomial. That might be too complicated. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can let \\(y = x^2\\), so that each term becomes \\(\\frac{k}{y - k}\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, 3, 4\\). Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet \\(y = x^2\\). Then the left side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nBut the problem is that the right side still has an \\(x\\), not a \\(y\\). Since \\(y = x^2\\), maybe I can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\), but that would involve square roots, which complicates things. Hmm, maybe this substitution isn't helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the left side is a function of \\(x^2\\), while the right side is a linear function of \\(x\\). Since \\(x^2\\) is even in \\(x\\), but the right side is odd (if we consider \\(2010x\\) as an odd function), maybe there's some symmetry here?\n\nWait, but the equation is not symmetric because the right side is linear. So perhaps the solutions won't come in pairs of \\(x\\) and \\(-x\\), unless the equation somehow enforces that. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cross-multiplying all terms to a common denominator? Let me see.\n\nThe left side has denominators \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - "

Cool!\n\nBut we need all complex solutions. So, 0 is a real solution, but perhaps others exist too.\n\nNow, going back, maybe there's a symmetry or something else. Let's consider whether \\(x = a\\) is a solution, then \\(x = -a\\) would also be a solution because, if we replace \\(x\\) with \\(-x\\) in the equation, we get:\n\nLeft side: Each term becomes with \\(x^2\\) same as before, so same value.\n\nRight side: \\(2010(-x) -4 = -2010x -4\\).\n\nSo, if \\(x = a\\) is a solution, then left side equals \\(2010a -4\\), but at \\(-a\\), left side is same, right side is \\(-2010a -4\\). So unless \\(a =0\\), it won't satisfy. So, only solution with \\(x=0\\) is real.\n\nThus, perhaps \\(x=0\\) is the only real solution.\n\nBut the question asks for all complex solutions, so maybe there are more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I denote \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 -1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 -2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 -3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 -4}\\), then the equation is \\(f(x) = 2010x -4"

Let me see.\n\nLet me try to compute the degree of the polynomial equation after multiplying through by the denominators. The denominators are each quadratic, so the common denominator is a degree 8 polynomial (since each denominator is degree 2, and there are four of them multiplied together).

The +4D term: since D has a leading term of x^8, so 4D has 4x^8.\n\n2. The -2010x*D term: when you multiply x by D, the x^8 term in D (which is the coefficient of x^8 in D is 1, so x^8 * x gives x^9, but the coefficient of x^7 in D is zero (since D has only even exponents), so the x^8 term in the -2010x*D term would be the coefficient of x^7 in D multiplied by -2010, but since D has no x^7 term, that's zero. So the only contribution to x^8 is from the +4D term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^8 is indeed 4.\n\nTherefore, Vieta's formula gives the sum of roots as - (4)/(-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nBut wait, but the problem says \"the sum of all complex solutions\". Since it's a degree 9 polynomial, there are 9 roots (counting multiplicity). However, we have to consider that when we multiplied both sides by D, which is (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4), we might have introduced extraneous roots where D=0, i.e., x^2 =1,2,3,4. So, the solutions x=±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2 are excluded from the original equation because they make denominators zero. Therefore, the polynomial equation includes these roots, but they are not solutions to the original equation. Therefore, the actual solutions are the roots of the polynomial equation excluding those 8 roots (since each x^2=k has two roots except maybe if k is a square, but 1,4 are squares, so x=±1, ±2, and the others are irrational). So, the original equation has 9 - 8 =1 solution? But we"

            "output": " know x=0 is a solution.\n\nWait, that can't be, because the polynomial equation must have 9 roots, but only one is valid? But that seems contradictory because we have x=0 and potentially others.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: if we denote that the polynomial equation is P(x)=0, which is of degree 9, but P(x) is the original equation times D. So, the roots of P(x)=0 are the roots of the original equation, excluding x=±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2. So, the original equation has some roots, but we have to subtract these 8 roots from the total. But how does that relate to Vieta's formula?\n\nWait, Vieta's formula counts all roots of the polynomial, including the extraneous ones. So, the sum of all roots of the polynomial is 2/1005, but from these, we have to subtract the sum of the roots that are extraneous.\n\nThe extraneous roots are:\n\nFrom D=0, so x=±1, x=±√2, x=±√3, x=±2.\n\nEach of these x values makes the original equation undefined, so they are not roots of the original equation.\n\nSo, the sum of all roots of the polynomial is 2/1005. The sum of the extraneous roots is:\n\nSum of x=1, x=-1, x=√2, x=-√2, x=√3, x=-√3, x=2, x=-2.\n\nCalculating this:\n\n1 + (-1) + √2 + (-√2) + √3 + (-√3) + 2 + (-2) = 0.\n\nSo, the sum of the extraneous roots is zero.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the roots of the original equation is the sum of all roots of the polynomial minus the sum of extraneous roots, which is 2/1005 -0 = 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005. So, the answer should be \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{1005}}.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about this. We found that x=0 is a solution, and when we consider Vieta's formula, the other solutions sum up to 2/1005 as well. Since 2/1005 is approximately"

Let me check again.\n\nThe polynomial equation is:\n\nsum_{terms} (each term after multiplying by D) - (2010x -4)*D =0.\n\nThe leading term comes from -2010x * D, which is -2010x*(x^8 + ... ) so leading term is -2010x^9.\n\nThe next term is the x^8 term.

The -2010x*D term: when expanding, the x^8 term would come from multiplying x by the x^7 term in D, but D has no x^7 term (since D is a product of even terms), so that term is zero.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^8 is indeed 4.\n\nTherefore, Vieta's formula gives the sum of roots as - (4)/(-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005.

Since x=0 is a solution, and the sum is 2/1005, which is approximately 0.002, so that would mean that the other roots sum to 0.002, but since x=0 is part of the total sum, the total is indeed 0.002.
