It has 10 complex roots, and they come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). I need to find the sum of the reciprocals of the product of each root and its conjugate. That is, compute \\(\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is the modulus squared, which is a real number. So, each term in the sum is the reciprocal of the squared modulus of each root. Therefore, the sum we need is the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) for each root \\(r_i\\).\n\nBut how do I relate this to the given equation? Well, I recall that for polynomials, especially with multiple roots, Vieta's formulas relate the sums and products of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. Maybe I can use that here.\n\nGiven a polynomial equation, if I can express it in terms of its roots, then Vieta's formula can help. However, the given equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), which is a bit complex because it's a sum of two tenth powers. I wonder if I can expand this or make a substitution to make it more manageable.\n\nLet me let \\(y = 13x - 1\\). Then, the equation becomes \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\). Hmm, but since \\(y = 13x - 1\\), we can write \\(y^{10} = (13x - 1)^{10}\\), which is part of the original equation. So, the equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\).\n\nAnother approach might be to consider the substitution \\(z = x + \\frac"

Let me see if I can rewrite this equation in terms of a single variable raised to the 10th power.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor the equation. Since it's a sum of two terms each raised to the 10th power, maybe we can write it as \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, we get \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt[10]{-1} (13x - 1)\\). But since we are dealing with complex roots, the 10th roots of -1 can be expressed using Euler's formula. The 10th roots of -1 are \\(e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\). So, each root would satisfy \\(x = e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10} (13x - 1)\\). Hmm, but this might lead to a system of equations for each root. Not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the equation \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Then, dividing both sides by \\(x^{10}\\), we get \\(1 = - \\left( \\frac{13x - 1}{x} \\right)^{10}\\). Let me set \\(w = \\frac{13x - 1}{x}\\). Then, the equation becomes \\(1 = -w^{10}\\), so \\(w^{10} = -1\\). Therefore, \\(w\\) is a 20th root of unity, but specifically the 10th roots of -1, which are the same as the 20th roots of unity with odd multiples of \u03c0. So, \\(w = e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 9. Wait, but 20th roots of unity would be \\(e^{i2\\pi"

But \\(w = \\frac{13x - 1}{x}\\).

So, perhaps the roots x are given by \\(x = \\frac{1}{13 - w}\\) where \\(w^{10} = -1\\).\n\nTherefore, the roots x are \\(x = \\frac{1}{13 - w}\\) where \\(w\\) is each of the 10 roots of \\(w^{10} = -1\\).\n\nWait, but the original equation had degree 10, so the roots x can be written in terms of these 10 w's, each of which satisfy \\(w^{10} = -1\\).\n\nSo, let me note that each root \\(r_j\\) is \\(1/(13 - w_j)\\), where \\(w_j^{10} = -1\\). Therefore, each \\(r_j\\) is related to a 10th root of -1.\n\nTherefore, for each j, \\(r_j = \\frac{1}{13 - w_j}\\).\n\nSo, then, I need to compute \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j})\\).

Let me check again:\n\nWait, \\( |r_j|^2 = \\frac{1}{|13 - w_j|^2} \\), so \\(1/|r_j|^2 = |13 - w_j|^2\\). Therefore, the term we need is \\( |13 - w_j|^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum we need is the sum over all roots \\(r_j\\) of \\( |13 - w_j|^2 \\), but since the roots come in conjugate pairs, but each \\(w_j\\) is a root of \\(w^{10} = -1\\), so they are also arranged in conjugate pairs? Wait, not necessarily. Let me think.\n\nWait, the roots \\(w_j\\) are the 10th roots of -1. Since -1 is a real number, its roots come in conjugate pairs. For example, if \\(w\\) is a root, then so is \\(\\overline{w}\\), because the polynomial \\(w^{10} +1 =0\\) has real coefficients. Therefore, the roots \\(w_j\\) are indeed in conjugate pairs. Therefore, each pair \\(w_j\\) and \\(\\overline{w_j}\\) corresponds to roots \\(r_j\\) and \\(r_{\\overline{j}}\\), but since the problem lists the roots as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, etc., so each pair is accounted for.\n\nHowever, in the problem, the roots of the original equation are given as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, ..., r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). So, each pair is a conjugate pair. Therefore, the terms \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j})\\) for each pair would be the same, since \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = 1/|r_j|^2\\), and since \\(r_{\\overline{j}} = \\overline{r_j}\\), so \\(1/|r_{\\overline{j}}|^2 = 1/"

So, in effect, the sum we have is 2 times the sum over each distinct pair.\n\nWait, but actually, each \\(r_j\\) is paired with \\(\\overline{r_j}\\), so in the sum, each term \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j})\\) is the same as the term for its conjugate. Therefore, each pair contributes twice the same term. So, if I can compute one term, multiply by 2, and then see how many such pairs there are.\n\nBut actually, perhaps it's easier to note that for each \\(w_j\\), we can compute \\(|13 - w_j|^2\\), and then sum over all \\(w_j\\). But since the original equation is \\(w^{10} = -1\\), which has 10 roots, so the sum would be over all 10 roots.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the sum is over 5 terms, each of which is a pair. So, perhaps each pair corresponds to two roots \\(w_j\\) and \\(w_{10 -j}\\), but that might not necessarily be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is needed.\n\nGiven that \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), which can be rewritten as \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, we get \\(x = e^{i\\pi(1 + 2k)/10}(13x - 1)\\), for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\). That is, each root x is a 10th root of -1 times (13x -1).

Therefore, each term in the problem's sum is exactly |13 - w_j|^2 for each root r_j. Since the roots come in conjugate pairs, but each pair contributes two terms, each equal to |13 - w_j|^2 and |13 - \\overline{w_j}|^2, which are equal because modulus squared is the same. Therefore, each pair contributes 2 * |13 - w_j|^2. Wait, but the problem's sum is over the 5 distinct terms, each being 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}), so each term is |13 - w_j|^2 for each pair. Wait, no, actually, the problem lists the roots as r1, \\overline{r1}, r2, \\overline{r2}, etc., so the terms in the sum are 1/(r1 \\overline{r1}) + 1/(r2 \\overline{r2}) + ... +1/(r5 \\overline{r5}), so each term is just |13 - w_j|^2 for each of the 5 distinct roots (since each pair is counted once). Wait, but actually, each pair (r_j, \\overline{r_j}) corresponds to two roots, but the term 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) is the same for both. Therefore, the problem's sum is exactly the sum over all 10 roots of 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) divided by 2, since each pair is counted twice. Wait, no, the problem's sum is over the 5 distinct terms, each term being the reciprocal of the product of a root and its conjugate. Since each pair contributes one term (since the product r_j \\overline{r_j} is the same for both roots in the pair), so the total sum is exactly the sum over the 5 terms, each being |13 - w_j|^2 for each of the 5"

So, if I split them into 5 pairs of complex conjugates, then for each pair, |13 - w_j|^2 is same for each member of the pair. Therefore, each pair contributes twice |13 - w_j|^2. Therefore, the sum over all 10 roots is 2*(sum over 5 terms). So, in the problem, the sum is just the sum over 5 terms, which is equal to (1/2)*sum over all 10 roots.\n\nBut earlier, I found that the sum over all 10 roots is 1700, so sum over 5 terms is 1700/2=850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850.\n\nBut let me double-check the logic.\n\nGiven that each term 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) is |13 - w_j|^2, and since for each root r_j, which corresponds to w_j, there's a conjugate root \\overline{r_j} corresponding to \\overline{w_j}. But 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |13 - w_j|^2 and 1/(\\overline{r_j} r_j)= |13 - \\overline{w_j}|^2. But since |13 - w_j|^2=|13 - \\overline{w_j}|^2, because modulus is invariant under conjugation, each pair (r_j, \\overline{r_j}) contributes 2*|13 - w_j|^2 to the total sum over all roots.\n\nSince the original equation has 10 roots, the sum of 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) over all roots is equal to 2*(sum of 5 distinct terms |13 - w_j|^2). Therefore, if the sum over all 10 terms is 1700, then the sum over 5 terms is 850.\n\nThus, the answer is 850.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{850}\n</think>\n\nGiven the equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), we have 10 complex roots \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline"
