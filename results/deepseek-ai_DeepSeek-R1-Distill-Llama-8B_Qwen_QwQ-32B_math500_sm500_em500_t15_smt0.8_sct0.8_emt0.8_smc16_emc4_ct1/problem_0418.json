            "output": "Okay, so I've got this equation: \\( x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0 \\). It says it has 10 complex roots, which makes sense because it's a 10th-degree polynomial. The roots are given as \\( r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\) and so on up to \\( r_5, \\overline{r}_5 \\). So, each root \\( r_i \\) has its complex conjugate \\( \\overline{r}_i \\) also as a root. That's because the coefficients of the polynomial are real numbers, right? So, complex roots must come in conjugate pairs.\n\nThe question is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the product of each \\( r_i \\) and its conjugate \\( \\overline{r}_i \\). In mathematical terms, that's \\( \\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5} \\).\n\nI remember that for any complex number \\( r \\), the product \\( r \\overline{r} \\) is equal to \\( |r|^2 \\). The modulus squared, or the magnitude squared, of \\( r \\) is \\( |r|^2 \\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}} = \\frac{1}{|r|^2} \\). So, really, we're being asked to find the sum of \\( 1/|r_i|^2 \\) for each pair \\( (r_i, \\overline{r}_i) \\).\n\nSo, first, maybe I can find each \\( |r_i|^2 \\), which is \\( r_i \\overline{r}_i \\), and then take the reciprocal. Then I can sum those reciprocals. But how?\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in polynomials, there are relationships between the roots and the coefficients called Vieta's formulas. Maybe I can use that here.\n\nLet me think about the given equation: \\( x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0 \\). Let me denote \\( y = x \\). Then the equation"

Which is the same as \\( (y)^{10} = - (13y - 1)^{10} \\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, we get \\( y = \\omega (13y - 1) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a 10th root of -1. But \\( \\omega^{10} = -1 \\), so \\( \\omega = e^{\\pi i / 10 + 2\\pi i k /10} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, ..., 9 \\).\n\nWait, let me check that. If \\( \\omega^{10} = -1 \\), then \\( \\omega \\) is a 20th root of unity, because \\( (-1)^{1/10} = e^{\\pi i /10 + 2\\pi i k /10} \\). So, the 10th roots of -1 are the same as the 20th roots of unity at odd multiples of \\( \\pi/10 \\). So, \\( \\omega = e^{(2k+1)\\pi i /10} \\) for \\( k = 0,1,...,9 \\).\n\nSo, maybe I can write \\( y = \\omega (13 y - 1) \\) and solve for y.

Each ω gives a distinct root.\n\nSo, the roots of the original equation are these y's, which are \\( x = \\frac{ \\omega }{13 \\omega - 1 } \\) for each ω. So, for each ω, we get a root x.\n\nNow, since we have 10 roots, each pair comes from a ω and its conjugate, right? Because if ω is a 20th root of unity, then ω^20 = 1, and so for each ω, the complex conjugate is ω^*, which is ω^{-1}, since the roots come in pairs on the unit circle. So, the conjugate of ω is ω^{-1}.\n\nBut in our case, the ω's are the 20th roots of unity with exponents of the form (2k+1)π/10, so each ω is e^{(2k+1)π i /10} for k=0,...,9. So, the conjugate of ω is e^{-(2k+1)π i /10} = e^{(2(-k)-1)π i /10}, which is another root in the same set. So, each ω and its conjugate pair are in the roots.\n\nSo, perhaps each pair of roots (r_i, \\( \\overline{r}_i \\)) corresponds to a pair of ω and ω^*.\n\nSo, for each ω, we get a root \\( x = \\frac{ \\omega }{13 \\omega - 1 } \\), and for ω^*, the conjugate root, it would be \\( x^* = \\frac{ \\omega^* }{13 \\omega^* - 1 } \\).\n\nNow, let's compute \\( r_i \\overline{r_i} \\) for each root.

Let's double-check.\n\nWait, denominator was 170 -26 Re(ω). So, |x|^2 = 1 / denominator, so 1/|x|^2 = denominator. So, 1/(x \\overline{x}) = denominator, which is 170 -26 Re(ω).\n\nWait, but in the problem, we have for each root, 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) added up.

But for each root, we can pair ω_i with its conjugate, and since the equation has 10 roots, each corresponding to a unique ω.\n\nBut let me think about this. For each root x_i, which is \\( \\frac{ \\omega }{13 \\omega -1 } \\), the reciprocal of x_i \\overline{x_i} is 170 -26 Re(ω_i). So, the sum we are being asked is the sum over all roots x_i of (170 -26 Re(ω_i)).\n\nBut wait, but each root x_i corresponds to a particular ω_i, so the sum is the sum over i of (170 -26 Re(ω_i)).\n\nSo, sum = 10*170 -26 sum_{i=1 to 10} Re(ω_i).\n\nWait, 10 terms, each contributing 170 and subtracting 26 Re(ω_i). So,\n\nSum = 10*170 -26 * sum_{i=1}^{10} Re(ω_i).\n\nBut hold on, the roots ω_i are the 10th roots of -1, which we mentioned earlier are the 20th roots of unity at angles (2k+1)π/10, so spaced every π/10 radians. Each pair of complex conjugate roots would have their real parts adding to 2 cos(theta) for the angle theta. But since we have 10 roots, each in conjugate pairs, maybe we can find the sum of Re(ω_i"

The roots ω are the 10th roots of -1, so they are the solutions to ω^10 = -1. So, they are equally spaced on the unit circle at angles π/10, 3π/10, 5π/10, ..., 19π/10.

So, for example, cos(11π/10) = cos(π + π/10) = -cos(π/10). Similarly, cos(13π/10) = cos(π + 3π/10) = -cos(3π/10), and so on.\n\nTherefore, the terms will pair up as:\n\ncos(π/10) + cos(19π/10) = cos(π/10) + cos(2π - π/10) = cos(π/10) + cos(π/10) = 2 cos(π/10).

Since these roots are symmetrically distributed around the unit circle, their vectors cancel out.\n\nAlternatively, since they are roots of the equation ω^10 + 1 = 0, so the sum of all roots ω is the negative of the coefficient of ω^9, which is 0. Hence, sum of roots is zero. Then, the sum of Re(ω_i) is Re( sum(ω_i) ) = Re(0) = 0.\n\nExactly! The sum of all roots of ω^10 = -1 is zero (since the coefficient of ω^9 is zero).

But actually, if the question had asked for the sum over each pair, in this case, it would have been 170, because each pair contributes 170. Wait, no, in the original question, the sum is over the five terms for the 10 roots, but in this case, the sum would be over two terms, each being 170, so 340.\n\nWait, this is confusing.

But since in the specific case above, we have only one pair, and the sum is 2*170=340, which equals 2*(170).
