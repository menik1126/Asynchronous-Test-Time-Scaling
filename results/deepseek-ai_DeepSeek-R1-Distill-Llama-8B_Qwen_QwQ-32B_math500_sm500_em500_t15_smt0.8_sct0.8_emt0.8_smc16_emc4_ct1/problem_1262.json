            "output": "To determine the base six equivalent of \\(999_{10}\\), I first need to understand how base conversion works. In base six, each digit represents a power of six, starting from the rightmost digit as \\(6^0\\), then \\(6^1\\), and so on.\n\nI'll start by dividing 999 by 6 to find the highest power of six that fits into this number. Dividing 999 by 6 gives me 166 with a remainder of 3. This means that the rightmost digit in base six will be 3.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6 again. This gives me 27 with a remainder of 4. So, the next digit to the left in base six will be 4.\n\nContinuing this process, I'll divide 27 by 6 to get 4 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, the following digit in base six is 3.\n\nI'll then divide 4 by 6, which results in 0 with a remainder of 4. This indicates that the leftmost digit in base six is 4.\n\nBy assembling these remainders from last to first, the base six equivalent of \\(999_{10}\\) is \\(1443_6\\).\n</think>\n\nTo convert the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\) to its equivalent in base six, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Base Conversion**:\n   - In base six, each digit represents a power of six.\n   - The rightmost digit is \\(6^0\\), then \\(6^1\\), \\(6^2\\), and so on.\n\n2. **Divide by 6 and Find Quotients and Remainders**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   999 \\div 6 &= 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3 \\quad (6^0) \\\\\n   166 \\div 6 &= 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4 \\quad (6^1) \\\\\n   27 \\div 6 &= 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3 \\quad (6^2) \\\\\n   4 \\div 6 &= 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4 \\quad (6^3) \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Write the Base Six Number**:\n  "
