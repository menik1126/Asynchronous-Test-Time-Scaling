            "output": "To find the modulo 7 remainder of the sum 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + ... + 199, I start by identifying the pattern in the sequence.\n\nFirst, I recognize that the sequence consists of consecutive odd numbers. There are 100 terms in total since each term increases by 2, and 199 is the last term.\n\nNext, I recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\( S = n \\times \\frac{(a_1 + a_n)}{2} \\). Plugging in the values, the sum S equals 100 times (1 + 199) divided by 2, which simplifies to 100 × 100 = 10,000.\n\nNow, to find the modulo 7 remainder of 10,000, I divide 10,000 by 7. Performing the division, 7 × 1428 = 9996, and 10,000 minus 9996 equals 4. Therefore, the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7 is 4.\n\nThus, the modulo 7 remainder of the sum is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Type:**\n   \n   The given sequence is a series of consecutive odd numbers. There are \\(100\\) terms in total because the sequence starts at \\(1\\) and ends at \\(199\\), with a common difference of \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**\n   \n   The sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   S = n \\times \\frac{a_1 + a_n}{2}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\(n = 100\\) (number of terms)\n   - \\(a_1 = 1\\) (first term)\n   - \\(a_n = 199\\) (last term)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   S = 100 \\times \\frac{1 + 199}{2} = 100 \\times 100 = 10,\\!000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute \\(10,\\!000 \\mod 7\\):**\n"
