I'm supposed to find the maximum value of the greatest common divisor of \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). \n\nFirst, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest possible gcd that can exist for the pair \\( (n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) where \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. One method I remember for finding the gcd of two numbers is the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here. The Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then taking the remainder, repeating the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.\n\nSo, let's apply the Euclidean algorithm to \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). I need to express this in a way that allows me to compute their gcd. Let me denote \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). Then, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\).\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, b - ka) \\) where \\( k \\) is chosen such that the result is simpler. Let's compute \\( b - 2a \\) because if I subtract 2 times \\( a \\) from \\( b \\), I might get a simpler expression. So, \\( b - 2a = (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) \\).\n\nCalculating that: \\( (2n + 1) - 2n - 14 = (2n - 2n) + (1 - 14) = 0 -13 = -13 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, -13) \\). But since the gcd is always non-negative, this"

            "output": " simplifies to \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\).\n\nAlright, that's interesting. So the gcd simplifies to \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\). Now, the next step is to find the possible values of this gcd. Since 13 is a prime number, the gcd can only be either 1 or 13. Therefore, the greatest possible value is 13.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure that it's possible for the gcd to actually be 13. So, we need \\( n + 7 \\) to be divisible by 13. That means \\( n + 7 = 13k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Then, substituting back into \\( 2n + 1 \\), let's see if it is also divisible by 13.\n\nIf \\( n + 7 = 13k \\), then \\( n = 13k - 7 \\). Plugging this into \\( 2n + 1 \\): \\( 2(13k - 7) + 1 = 26k - 14 + 1 = 26k -13 \\). Now, 26k is obviously divisible by 13, and -13 is also divisible by 13, so \\( 26k -13 = 13(2k - 1) \\), which is divisible by 13.\n\nSo, both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13 when \\( n = 13k - 7 \\). Therefore, the gcd is indeed 13 for such values of \\( n \\). \n\nBut wait, let me check for a specific \\( n \\) to verify. Let's take \\( k = 1 \\), so \\( n = 13*1 -7 = 6 \\). Then \\( n +7 = 13 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 13 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(13,13) =13 \\), which is correct. \n\nAnother example: \\( k=2 \\), \\( n=13*2 -7=26-7=19 \\). Then \\( n+7=26 \\), \\( 2n+1=39 \\). \\( \\gcd(26,39) =13 \\), since 26=2*13 and 39=3*13. So, yes, that"

So, \\( k \\) must be at least 1. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible gcd is 13. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I used the Euclidean algorithm, subtracted 2 times the first number from the second, got -13, which led me to consider gcd with 13, and since 13 is prime, it can only be 1 or 13. Then, I verified that 13 is achievable by choosing \\( n \\) appropriately. So, everything seems consistent.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible value is \\boxed{13}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) where \\( n \\) is a positive integer, we use the Euclidean algorithm. Let \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). We need to compute \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\).\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm, we have:\n\\[\n\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\n\\]\nSubtracting 2 times \\( a \\) from \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb - 2a = (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13)\n\\]\nSince 13 is a prime number, the gcd can only be 1 or 13. To check if 13 is achievable, we set \\( n + 7 = 13k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Then \\( n = 13k - 7 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( n = 13k - 7 \\) into \\( 2n + 1 \\):\n\\[\n2(13k - 7) + 1 = 26k - 14 + 1 = 26k - 13 = 13(2k - 1)\n\\]\nBoth \\( n + 7 \\) and \\("
