Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the greatest number that divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). Let me denote \\( d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\). \n\nSince \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\), it must also divide any linear combination of these two. Maybe I can find such a combination that simplifies things.\n\nLet me try to express \\( 2n + 1 \\) in terms of \\( n + 7 \\). If I subtract \\( 2 \\times (n + 7) \\) from \\( 2n + 1 \\), perhaps I can eliminate \\( n \\) or find a relationship. So, let's do that:\n\n\\( 2n + 1 - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\).\n\nOh, interesting! So, \\( d \\) divides \\( -13 \\). But since \\( d \\) is a positive integer, it must divide 13. That means \\( d \\) can only be 1 or 13 because 13 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the possible values for \\( d \\) are 1 and 13. The problem asks for the greatest possible value, so I need to check if 13 can actually be achieved. That is, is there an \\( n \\) such that both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13?\n\nYes, let's test that. If \\( 13 \\) divides \\( n + 7 \\), then \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\), which means \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\). Since we're dealing with modulo 13, \\( -7 \\) is equivalent to \\( 6 \\mod 13 \\), so \\("

Let's solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\( 2n \\equiv -1 \\mod 13 \\)\n\\( 2n \\equiv 12 \\mod 13 \\)\nMultiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 13. Since \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\equiv 1 \\mod 13 \\), the inverse is 7.\n\nSo, \\( n \\equiv 12 \\times 7 \\mod 13 \\)\n\\( n \\equiv 84 \\mod 13 \\)\nBut 13 times 6 is 78, so 84 - 78 = 6. Thus, \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\).\n\nWait, that's the same as the previous condition! So \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\) satisfies both congruences. Therefore, when \\( n = 6 \\mod 13 \\), both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13. \n\nSo, for such \\( n \\), \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13 \\). Since 13 is a prime number, it's the largest possible gcd. Therefore, the greatest possible value is 13.\n\nJust to double-check, let me take \\( n = 6 \\) and compute.\n\n\\( n + 7 = 13 \\), and \\( 2n + 1 = 13 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\). That works.\n\nAnother example: \\( n = 19 \\) (which is 6 + 13). \n\n\\( n + 7 = 26 \\), and \\( 2n + 1 = 39 \\). Now, \\( \\gcd(26, 39) \\). Both are divisible by 13: 26 ÷13=2, 39 ÷13=3. So, gcd is 13. Still works.\n\nLet me try another \\( n \\) that's not 6 mod 13. Say, \\( n=1 \\):\n\n\\( n + 7 = 8 \\), \\( 2n +"

Otherwise, it's 1.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value is 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible value is \\boxed{13}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) where \\(n\\) is a positive integer, we start by noting that \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) must divide any linear combination of \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\). \n\nWe consider the linear combination:\n\\[\n(2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13\n\\]\nThus, the greatest common divisor \\(d\\) must divide \\(-13\\), and since \\(d\\) is a positive integer, it must divide 13. Therefore, \\(d\\) can only be 1 or 13.\n\nTo check if 13 can be achieved, we solve the congruences:\n1. \\(n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}\\) implies \\(n \\equiv -7 \\pmod{13}\\), which simplifies to \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\\).\n2. \\(2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}\\) implies \\(2n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{13}\\), which simplifies to \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\\).\n\nBoth congruences are satisfied when \\(n \\equiv 6 \\pmod{13}\\). Therefore, for \\(n = 6 \\mod 13\\), both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\) are divisible by 13, making \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13\\).\n\nThus, the greatest possible value is \\(\\boxed{13}\\)."
