The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, alright. I think this is about partial fractions. Yeah, because on the left side, we have two fractions with linear denominators, and on the right, a single fraction with a quadratic denominator. So, maybe I can express the right-hand side as the sum of two fractions and then compare the numerators.\n\nFirst, I need to factor the denominator on the right side. Let me see, the quadratic is \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). To factor that, I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let's see: 8 and -3? Yes, because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, the denominator factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). That matches the denominators on the left side, so that's a good start.\n\nSo, rewriting the equation, it becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, I remember that if two fractions are equal, their numerators must be equal when the denominators are the same. So, if I combine the left side over the common denominator (x - 3)(x + 8), the numerator should equal 4x - 23.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation in terms of x. I need to solve for C and D. How do I do that? I think I can expand the left side and then collect like terms to form a system of equations.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nC * x + C * 8 + D * x - D * 3 = 4x - 23\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = "

So, I can set up two equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nAlright, so now I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. C + D = 4\n2. 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve for C and D. Let me use the substitution method. From the first equation, I can express D in terms of C:\n\nD = 4 - C\n\nNow, substitute D into the second equation:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n(8C + 3C) - 12 = -23\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nNow, solve for C:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n11C = -11\nC = -1\n\nOkay, so C is -1. Now, substitute C back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Therefore, the product CD is:\n\nCD = (-1) * 5 = -5\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the equation after expansion:\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nAdding 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nYes, that seems right. Then D = 4 - (-1) = 5. That looks correct.\n\nTo verify, let's plug C = -1 and D = 5 back into the original left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1}{x - 3} + \\frac{5}{x + 8}\n\\]\n\nCombine these over the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(-1)(x + 8) + 5(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n-1*x -1*8 + "
