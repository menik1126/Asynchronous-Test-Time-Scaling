            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product of two integers CD. The equation given is a sum of two fractions: C over (x - 3) and D over (x + 8), and it's equal to (4x - 23) divided by (x² + 5x - 24). Hmm, okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an equation like this with fractions, you can combine them over a common denominator and then compare the numerators. The denominators here are (x - 3) and (x + 8). So the common denominator would be the product of these two, right? That would be (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, if I rewrite the left side with the common denominator:\n\nC(x + 8) / [(x - 3)(x + 8)] + D(x - 3) / [(x - 3)(x + 8)] = (4x - 23) / (x² + 5x - 24).\n\nWait, the denominator on the right side is a quadratic. Maybe I can factor that to check if it's the same as (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me try factoring x² + 5x - 24. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 5. That would be 8 and -3, right? Because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, yes, it factors to (x - 3)(x + 8). Great, that matches.\n\nSo now, both sides have the same denominator, which means I can set the numerators equal to each other. So, the numerator on the left side is C(x + 8) + D(x - 3), and that equals 4x - 23.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23.\n\nNow, I need to find the values of C and D such that this equation holds for all real x except x = 3 and x = -8, which are the excluded values.\n\nHmm, so this equation must be true for all x except those two points. That means the coefficients of"

            "output": " like terms on both sides must be equal. So I can expand the left side and then compare the coefficients of x and the constant terms.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = (C + D)x + (8C - 3D).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23.\n\nNow, since this is true for all x, the coefficients of x and the constant terms must be equal on both sides.\n\nSo, setting up the system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables, C and D. I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try substitution.\n\nFrom the first equation, I can express D in terms of C:\n\nD = 4 - C\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nWait, because it's -3 times (4 - C), so that's -12 + 3C.\n\nSo combining like terms:\n\n8C + 3C - 12 = -23\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nNow, solving for C:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n\n11C = -11\n\nSo, C = -1\n\nNow, substitute back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Therefore, the product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nSubstituting D = 4 - C:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = 8C - 12 + 3C = 11C -12\n\nSet equal to -23:\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\n11C = -11\n\nC = -1\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then D = 5.\n\nSo, CD = (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nJust to ensure"
