            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that 84 can be factored into prime numbers. Let me do that. 84 divided by 2 is 42. Then, 42 divided by 2 is 21. 21 divided by 3 is 7, and 7 is a prime number. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7. That means 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.\n\nNow, since I need a set of distinct positive integers, I can't have duplicate prime factors. So, I have to combine these prime factors in a way that each integer in the set is unique. My goal is to minimize the sum of these integers. \n\nI remember that when you want to minimize the sum of numbers with a fixed product, it's better to have the numbers as close to each other as possible. But since they have to be distinct, I might need to distribute the factors in a way that avoids having too many large numbers.\n\nSo, starting with the prime factors 2, 2, 3, and 7. Since 2 is repeated, I should combine them to make a single 4. Wait, but 4 is still a factor. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach is to find all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 84 and then compute their sums to find the minimum. Let's try that.\n\nPossible sets:\n1. Single integer: 84. Sum = 84. That's probably not the minimum because if I can split it into multiple distinct integers, their sum might be less.\n\n2. Two integers: Factors of 84 are 1×84, 2×42, 3×28, 4×21, 6×14, 7×12. Let me compute the sums:\n   - 1 + 84 = 85\n   - 2 + 42 = 44\n   - 3 + 28 = 31\n   - 4 + 21 = 25\n   - 6 + 14 = 20\n   - 7 + 12 = 19\nSo the minimum sum for two integers is 19.\n\n3. Three integers"

That's better than 15. Hmm, so that's a better sum.\n\nWait, how did I not think of that? Let me confirm: 3×4×7 is indeed 84. Yes. So that's a valid triplet with sum 14.
