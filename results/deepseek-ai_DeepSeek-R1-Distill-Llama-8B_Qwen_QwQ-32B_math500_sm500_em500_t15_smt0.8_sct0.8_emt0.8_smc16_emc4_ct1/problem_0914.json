Dividing 42 by 2 again results in 21. Then, 21 is divisible by 3, yielding 7, and 7 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7.\n\nNext, I should aim to combine these factors into distinct integers such that their product is 84. The goal is to minimize the sum of these integers.\n\nOne effective strategy is to use as many small integers as possible since smaller numbers will contribute less to the overall sum.\n\nStarting with the smallest primes, I can use 2 and 3 as part of the set. The remaining factors I have are 7, 2, and 3. Combining 2 and 3 gives me 6. Now, I have the numbers 2, 3, and 7.\n\nIncluding all of these numbers in the set gives me 2 × 3 × 7 = 42, which is less than 84. To reach the desired product, I need to increase one of the numbers by multiplying it by 2, resulting in 6 instead of 2 or 3.\n\nSo, the final set of distinct positive integers is 2, 3, and 6. Calculating their sum, I get 2 + 3 + 6 = 11.\n\nI should verify that there isn't a smaller possible sum. Checking other possible combinations, like 3, 4, and 7, would give a sum of 14, which is larger. Therefore, 11 is indeed the smallest possible sum.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 84:**\n   - 84 can be factored into prime numbers: \\(84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n\n2. **Goal: Minimize the Sum:**\n   - Use the smallest possible integers to keep the sum as low as possible while maintaining the product of 84.\n\n3. **Combining Factors:**\n   - Start with the smallest prime numbers: 2, "

The optimal choice is to combine the remaining factor (2) with another number to form a larger distinct integer. \n   - Combining 2 (from the remaining factors) with 3 gives \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\). This results in the set \\{2, 6, 7\\}.\n\n4. **Verify the Product and Sum:**\n   - Product: \\(2 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 84\\).\n   - Sum: \\(2 + 6 + 7 = 15\\). Wait, this contradicts the earlier reasoning. Let me recheck.\n\n   **Revised Step 3:**\n   - The prime factors are \\(2, 2, 3, 7\\). To form distinct integers, we can combine the two 2s into 4, resulting in the set \\{3, 4, 7\\}.\n   - Product: \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 7 = 84\\).\n   - Sum: \\(3 + 4 + 7 = 14\\).\n\n   Alternatively, combining one 2 with 3 to get 6, and keeping the other 2 and 7: \\{2, 6, 7\\}.\n   - Product: \\(2 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 84\\).\n   - Sum: \\(2 + 6 + 7 = 15\\).\n\n   Another approach: Use three numbers by splitting factors differently. For example, \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\), so the set \\{6, 2, 7\\} (sum 15) or \\{3, 4, 7\\} (sum 14). \n\n   However, we can also consider using four numbers. For instance, breaking down the factors into smaller distinct integers:\n   - \\(2, 3, 2, 7\\) are not distinct. \n   - Instead, use \\(2, 3, 4, 7\\): product \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 7 = 168\\"
