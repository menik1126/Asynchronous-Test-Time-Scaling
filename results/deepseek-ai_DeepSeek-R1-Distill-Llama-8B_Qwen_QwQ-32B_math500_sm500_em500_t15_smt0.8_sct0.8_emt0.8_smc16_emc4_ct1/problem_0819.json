            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. I remember that cube roots of unity satisfy the equation ω³ - 1 = 0, which can be factored as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. So, the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. Therefore, ω and ω² are the non-real cube roots of unity.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the possible values of \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Let me denote this expression as S. So,\n\nS = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nI need to find all possible values of S. Since ω can be either of the two non-real cube roots of unity, either ω or ω², I might have two different values for S. Let me check both cases.\n\nBut before jumping into that, maybe there's a smarter way to handle this. I recall that when dealing with roots of unity, sometimes it's helpful to use their properties, such as ω³ = 1, ω ≠ 1, and 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That might be useful here.\n\nWait, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That’s a key identity for cube roots of unity. So, perhaps I can express S in terms of this identity.\n\nLet me write down S again:\n\nS = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nLet me try to combine these two fractions into one. To add them, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²).\n\nSo,\n\nS = \\(\\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 +"

Let's expand that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*(1 + ω²) + ω*(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, the denominator becomes:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nWait, so the denominator is 2 + ω + ω², and the numerator is also 2 + ω + ω². So, S = (2 + ω + ω²)/(2 + ω + ω²) = 1.\n\nHmm, does that mean S is always 1 regardless of whether ω is one root or the other? Let me verify that because I might have made an error.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that perhaps ω and ω² would give different values, but now, with this calculation, it seems S is always 1. Let me check again.\n\nSo, starting from S = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 1 + ω + 1 + ω² = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nCompute denominator:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so denominator becomes 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo numerator and denominator are same, hence S = 1.\n\nWait, but what if I choose ω = -1? No, wait, ω can't be -1 because (-1)^3 = -1 ≠ 1, so ω ≠ -1. Also, 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω² = -1 - ω.\n\nWait, perhaps that's another way to approach it. Let me see.\n\nSince 1 + ω + ω² = 0, that implies ω² = -1 - ω. Maybe I can substitute this into S.\n\n"

Let's write it down:\n\nS = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} - \\frac{1}{\\omega}\\).\n\nLet me combine these two terms.

Maybe express ω in terms of its minimal polynomial or something.\n\nWe know that ω² + ω + 1 = 0, so ω² = -ω -1.\n\nAlternatively, I can express 1 + ω in terms of ω².\n\nFrom 1 + ω = -ω² because ω² = -1 - ω, so 1 + ω = -ω²? Let me check:\n\n1 + ω + ω² = 0 ⇒ 1 + ω = -ω². Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 1 + ω = -ω² ⇒ 1 + ω = -ω².\n\nSo, plug this into S:\n\nS = \\(\\frac{-1}{\\omega(-\\omega²)}\\) = \\(\\frac{-1}{-\\omega^3}\\).\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1.\n\nThus,\n\nS = \\(\\frac{-1}{-1}\\) = 1.\n\nSo, again, S = 1.\n\nWait, so regardless of which non-real cube root I pick, ω or ω², S comes out to be 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nHmm, that seems too straightforward. But let me just verify with concrete numbers.\n\nSuppose ω is e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π"

Let me compute 1/(1 + ω²) where ω² = (-1/2 - i√3/2)^2? Wait, no, I think I might be overcomplicating.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier algebraic computation, it didn't matter which root I took because ultimately, S came out as 1. So whether ω is e^(2πi/3) or e^(4πi/3), it doesn't matter; the sum S is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but just to be 100% sure, let me compute S when ω = 1, though it's supposed to be a root, but maybe that's a special case.\n\nIf ω =1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 =1.
