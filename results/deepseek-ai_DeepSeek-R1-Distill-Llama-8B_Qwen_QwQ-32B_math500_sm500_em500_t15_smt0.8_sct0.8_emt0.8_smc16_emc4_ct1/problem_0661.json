Let T represent the weight of a treek, S for a squig, and G for a goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, I know that 10 treeks weigh the same as 3 squigs and 1 goolee. This gives me the equation:\n\n10T = 3S + G\n\nThe second statement tells me that 2 treeks and 1 goolee equal one squig:\n\n2T + G = S\n\nNow, I'll use the second equation to eliminate G from the first. From 2T + G = S, I can solve for G:\n\nG = S - 2T\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\nAdding 2T to both sides:\n\n12T = 4S\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\n3T = S\n\nThis means the weight of one squig is equal to 3 treeks. Therefore, to find the combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig, I simply need 3 treeks.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. 10 treeks (T) weigh as much as 3 squigs (S) and 1 goolee (G).\n2. 2 treeks and 1 goolee are equal in weight to 1 squig.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( T \\) = weight of 1 treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of 1 squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of 1 goolee\n\n**Step 1: Translate the Given Information into Equations**\n\nFrom the first statement:\n\\[ 10T = 3S + G \\]\n\nFrom the second statement:\n\\[ 2T + G = S \\]\n\n**Step 2: Solve the Second Equation for \\( G \\)**\n\nStarting with:\n\\[ 2T + G = S \\]\n\nSubtract \\( 2T \\) from both sides:\n\\[ G = S - 2T \\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute \\( G \\) into the First Equation**\n\nReplace \\( G \\) in the first equation:\n\\[ 10T = 3S + (S - "
