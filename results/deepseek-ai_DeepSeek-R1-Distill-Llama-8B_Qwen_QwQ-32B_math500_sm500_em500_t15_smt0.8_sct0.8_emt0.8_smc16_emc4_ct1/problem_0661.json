This gives me the equation:\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement tells me that two treeks and one goolee equal the weight of one squig:\n2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I'll use substitution to solve for the variables. From the second equation, I can express G in terms of T and S:\nG = S - 2T.\n\nSubstituting this expression for G into the first equation:\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T),\nwhich simplifies to:\n10T = 4S - 2T.\n\nNext, I'll combine like terms:\n10T + 2T = 4S,\nwhich gives:\n12T = 4S.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for S in terms of T:\nS = 3T.\n\nThis shows that the weight of one squig is equal to three treeks.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( T \\) represent the weight of one treek.\n   - Let \\( S \\) represent the weight of one squig.\n   - Let \\( G \\) represent the weight of one goolee.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Given Information:**\n   \n   - **First Statement:**  \n     Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n     \\[\n     10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Second Statement:**  \n     Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n     \\[\n     2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Express \\( G \\) in Terms of \\( S \\) and \\( T \\):**  \n   From Equation 2:\n   \\[\n   G = S - 2T\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( G \\) into Equation 1:**  \n   \\[\n  "
