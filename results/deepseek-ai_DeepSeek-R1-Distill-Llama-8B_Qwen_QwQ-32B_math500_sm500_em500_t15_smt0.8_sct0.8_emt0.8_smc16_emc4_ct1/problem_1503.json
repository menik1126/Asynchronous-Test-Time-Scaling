Since all prime numbers are greater than one and most are odd, the intersection will include all prime numbers less than 30 that are odd.\n\nAfter identifying the common elements between both sets, I will count them to find the total number of elements in the intersection.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the prime numbers less than 30:**\n   \n   The prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes less than 30 are:\n   \\[\n   2,\\, 3,\\, 5,\\, 7,\\, 11,\\, 13,\\, 17,\\, 19,\\, 23,\\, 29\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the odd numbers greater than zero:**\n   \n   All odd numbers greater than zero are:\n   \\[\n   1,\\, 3,\\, 5,\\, 7,\\, 9,\\, 11,\\, 13,\\, 15,\\, 17,\\, 19,\\, 21,\\, 23,\\, 25,\\, 27,\\, 29,\\, 31,\\, \\dots\n   \\]\n   \n   However, since we are considering numbers less than 30 for the prime set, we'll focus on odd numbers up to 29.\n\n3. **Find the intersection of both sets:**\n   \n   The intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd. From the list of prime numbers less than 30, exclude the even prime number, which is **2**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Prime numbers less than 30 (excluding 2)} = 3,\\, 5,\\, 7,\\, 11,\\, 13,\\, 17,\\, 19,\\, 23,\\, 29\n   \\]\n   \n   These are all odd numbers since all primes greater than 2 are odd.\n\n4. **Count the number of elements in the intersection:**\n   \n  "
