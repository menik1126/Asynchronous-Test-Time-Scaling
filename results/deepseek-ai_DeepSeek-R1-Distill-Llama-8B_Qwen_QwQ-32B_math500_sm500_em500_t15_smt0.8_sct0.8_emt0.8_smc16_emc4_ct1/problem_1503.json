These are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Starting from 2, I'll check each subsequent number to see if it's prime.\n\nNext, I'll consider the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are those that aren't divisible by 2. Since all prime numbers except for 2 are odd, most of the primes less than 30 will fall into this set.\n\nFinally, I'll find the intersection of these two sets by identifying the common elements. Since 2 is the only even prime number and not an odd number, it won't be included in the intersection. All other prime numbers less than 30 are odd and will be part of the intersection.\n\nBy counting these common elements, I'll be able to determine the exact number of elements in the intersection.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the set of prime numbers less than 30.**\n   \n   The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n   \n   \\[\n   2,\\ 3,\\ 5,\\ 7,\\ 11,\\ 13,\\ 17,\\ 19,\\ 23,\\ 29\n   \\]\n   \n   So, there are **10** prime numbers less than 30.\n\n2. **Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than zero.**\n   \n   The odd numbers greater than zero are:\n   \n   \\[\n   1,\\ 3,\\ 5,\\ 7,\\ 9,\\ 11,\\ \\dots\n   \\]\n   \n   However, since we're looking for **prime numbers**, we can focus on the odd prime numbers in this set.\n\n3. **Find the intersection of the two sets.**\n   \n   The intersection consists of the common elements between the two sets. Since all prime numbers except for 2 are odd, the intersection will include all prime numbers less than 30 except 2.\n\n4. **Count the elements in the intersection.**\n   \n   From the list of prime numbers less than 30:\n   \n   \\[\n  "
