            "output": "I need to identify the pattern in the sequence. The first term is 0. The second term is 0 + 1 = 1. The third term is 1 * 1 = 1. The fourth term is 1 + 2 = 3. The fifth term is 3 * 2 = 6. The sixth term is 6 + 3 = 9, and the seventh term is 9 * 3 = 27.\n\nNext, I'll list the terms with their corresponding operations to see the pattern clearly. Starting from term 1, each term alternates between adding the next integer and multiplying by it.\n\nTo find the term greater than 125, I'll continue applying the pattern:\n\n- Term 8: 27 + 4 = 31\n- Term 9: 31 * 4 = 124\n- Term 10: 124 + 5 = 129\n\nTerm 10 is 129, which is greater than 125. Therefore, the first term exceeding 125 is 129.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to identify the pattern and find the first term greater than 125.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence starts with **0**.\n   - **Subsequent terms** are produced by **alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1**.\n   - Breakdown of the first few terms:\n     - **Term 1:** 0\n     - **Term 2:** 0 + 1 = 1\n     - **Term 3:** 1 * 1 = 1\n     - **Term 4:** 1 + 2 = 3\n     - **Term 5:** 3 * 2 = 6\n     - **Term 6:** 6 + 3 = 9\n     - **Term 7:** 9 * 3 = 27\n     - **Term 8:** 27 + 4 = 31\n     - **Term 9:** 31 * 4 = 124\n     - **Term 10:** 124 + 5 = 129\n\n2. **Determine the First Term Greater Than 125:**\n   - From the sequence above:\n     - **Term 10:** 129 > 125\n   - Thus, the first term that exceeds"

    "question": "In the sequence 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27, ..., the first term is 0.   Subsequent terms are produced by alternately adding and  multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1.  For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.  What is the value of the first term that is greater than 125?"
