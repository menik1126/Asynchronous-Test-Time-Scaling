The second term is obtained by adding 1 to the first term, resulting in 1. The third term is created by multiplying the second term by 1, so it remains 1. The fourth term is achieved by adding 2 to the third term, giving 3. Then, multiplying by 2 for the fifth term, we get 6. Adding 3 next, the sixth term becomes 9. Multiplying by 3, the seventh term is 27.\n\nContinuing this pattern, each subsequent term alternates between adding the next integer and multiplying by it. So, the eighth term would be obtained by adding 4 to 27, resulting in 31. Multiplying by 4 gives 124 for the ninth term. Adding 5 to 124 yields 129 for the tenth term, and multiplying by 5 brings us to 645 for the eleventh term. Adding 6 to 645 gives 651 for the twelfth term.\n\nComparing these terms to the target value of 125, the first term that exceeds it is 645.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the given sequence step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Terms**:\n   - **Term 1**: 0\n   - **Term 2**: \\(0 + 1 = 1\\)\n   - **Term 3**: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n   - **Term 4**: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n   - **Term 5**: \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n   - **Term 6**: \\(6 + 3 = 9\\)\n   - **Term 7**: \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n\n2. **Continuing the Sequence**:\n   - **Term 8**: \\(27 + 4 = 31\\)\n   - **Term 9**: \\(31 \\times 4 = 124\\)\n   - **Term 10**: \\(124 + 5 = 129\\)\n   - **Term 11**: \\(129 \\times 5 = 645\\)\n   - **Term 12**: \\(645 + 6 = 651\\)\n\n3. **Identifying the First Term Greater Than 125**:\n   - From the sequence:\n     - **Term 11**:"
