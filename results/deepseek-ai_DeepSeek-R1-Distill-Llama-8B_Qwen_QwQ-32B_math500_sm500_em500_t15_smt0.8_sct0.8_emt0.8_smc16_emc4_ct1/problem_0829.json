I need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, let's see. First, since ω³ = 1, ω is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, ω must satisfy the equation ω³ = 1, which can be factored as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. Therefore, ω ≠ 1, so the other two roots are ω and ω².\n\nNow, I need to compute the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Maybe I can find the sum for both ω and ω² and see if they are the same or different. So, let's first consider ω and then ω².\n\nLet me denote S(ω) = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). I need to compute S(ω) and S(ω²) and see if they are the same or different.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can find a relationship between ω and ω² that can simplify the expression.\n\nI recall that for cube roots of unity, we have the property that 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That's a useful identity. So, ω² = -1 - ω. Let me note that down:\n\nω² = -1 - ω.\n\nSo, I can substitute ω² in terms of ω in the expression.\n\nBut before substituting, maybe it's better to find a common denominator for the two fractions in S(ω).\n\nSo, S(ω) = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nS(ω) = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nTo add these two fractions, I need a common denominator, which is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So:\n\nS(ω) = \\(\\frac"

The numerator would be (1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω)) divided by the denominator.\n\nYes, so numerator is (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nDenominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerator:\n\n2 + ω + ω². But from the identity 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, substituting that into the numerator:\n\n2 + (-1) = 1. So numerator simplifies to 1.\n\nNow the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's expand this:\n\n1*(1) + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω².\n\nSo that's 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, substituting that in:\n\nDenominator becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = (1 + 1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (ω + ω²).\n\nAgain, since ω + ω² = -1, this becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, denominator is 1.\n\nSo putting it all together, S(ω) = numerator / denominator = 1 / 1 = 1.\n\nWait, so that's interesting. So regardless of which cube root of unity (other than 1) we take, the expression simplifies to 1?\n\nBut let me check if that's correct. Let me test with specific values.\n\nLet me take ω = e^(2πi/3), which is a primitive cube root of unity. So ω = -1/2 + i√3/2, and ω² = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nLet me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω: 1 + (-1/"

The denominator is a complex number, so let's write it in polar form.\n\nThe modulus of 1/2 + i√3/2 is √[(1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = √[1/4 + 3/4] = √1 = 1.\n\nThe argument is arctangent of (√3/2)/(1/2) = arctangent of √3, which is π/3.\n\nSo 1/(1/2 + i√3/2) = (1/2 - i√3/2).
