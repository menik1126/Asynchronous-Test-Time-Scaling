I need to find all possible values of the expression \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. I remember that cube roots of unity satisfy the equation \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, which can be rewritten as \u03c9\u00b3 - 1 = 0. Factoring this, we get (\u03c9 - 1)(\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1) = 0. So, the roots are \u03c9 = 1, \u03c9 = (-1 + i\u221a3)/2, and \u03c9 = (-1 - i\u221a3)/2. These are the three cube roots of unity.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Since \u03c9 can be 1, (-1 + i\u221a3)/2, or (-1 - i\u221a3)/2, I should consider each case separately.\n\nLet me first consider \u03c9 = 1. Plugging this into the expression, we get \\[\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1^2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1.\\] So, when \u03c9 = 1, the expression equals 1.\n\nNext, let's take \u03c9 = (-1 + i\u221a3)/2. I need to compute \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Let me denote \u03c9 as (-1 + i\u221a3)/2 and \u03c9\u00b2 as (-1 - i\u221a3)/2 because I remember that \u03c9\u00b2 is the complex conjugate of \u03c9 when \u03c9 is a primitive cube root of unity.\n\nSo, let me compute 1 + \u03c9 first. 1 + \u03c9 would be 1 + (-1 + i\u221a3)/2 = (2 -1 + i\u221a3)/2 = (1 + i\u221a3)/2. Similarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + (-1 - i\u221a3)/2 = (2 -1 - i\u221a3)/2"

To rationalize the denominator, I can multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i\u221a3):\n\n2*(1 - i\u221a3) / [(1 + i\u221a3)(1 - i\u221a3)] = 2*(1 - i\u221a3) / (1 + 3) = 2*(1 - i\u221a3)/4 = (1 - i\u221a3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, \\[\\frac{1}{(1 - i\u221a3)/2} = 2 / (1 - i\u221a3).

Let me double-check that.\n\nWait, the denominator is (1 - i\u221a3)(1 + i\u221a3) = 1 + (i\u221a3) - (i\u221a3) - (i\u00b2*3) = 1 - (-1*3) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, yes, denominator is 4. So, numerator is 2*(1 + i\u221a3), so divided by 4, it becomes (1 + i\u221a3)/2.\n\nWait, let me correct myself:\n\nWait, 2 / (1 - i\u221a3) is being rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + i\u221a3):\n\nSo, numerator: 2*(1 + i\u221a3) = 2 + 2i\u221a3\n\nDenominator: (1)^2 + (\u221a3)^2 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the reciprocal is (2 + 2i\u221a3)/4 = (1 + i\u221a3)/2.\n\nWait, so that's the reciprocal of (1 - i\u221a3)/2.\n\nWait, but in the expression, we have:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] We already found \\[\\"

Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when \u03c9 = (-1 + i\u221a3)/2, then 1 + \u03c9 = 1 + (-1 + i\u221a3)/2 = (2 -1 + i\u221a3)/2 = (1 + i\u221a3)/2. So, the reciprocal is 2/(1 + i\u221a3). Rationalizing, as I did earlier, gives (1 - i\u221a3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c9\u00b2 is [(-1) - i\u221a3]/2, so 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + (-1 - i\u221a3)/2 = (2 -1 - i\u221a3)/2 = (1 - i\u221a3)/2. The reciprocal is 2/(1 - i\u221a3) = (1 + i\u221a3)/2, as above.\n\nSo, adding these two reciprocals:\n\n(1 - i\u221a3)/2 + (1 + i\u221a3)/2 = [1 - i\u221a3 + 1 + i\u221a3]/2 = (2)/2 = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, when \u03c9 is a primitive cube root of unity (i.e., \u03c9 \u2260 1), the expression also equals 1.\n\nWait, but when I took \u03c9 = 1, the expression also equals 1. So, does that mean all possible values of the expression are just 1? That seems surprising, but the calculation seems to confirm that.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If \u03c9 is a root of \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, then:\n\nThe cube roots of unity are 1, \u03c9, \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1 but \u03c9\u00b2 = \u03c9*, the complex conjugate.\n\nSo, let me verify again for \u03c9 = (-1 + i\u221a3)/2, which is \u03c9.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2):\n\n1 + \u03c9 = 1 + (-1 + i\u221a3)/2 = (2 -1 + i\u221a3)/2 = (1 + i\u221a3)/2.\n\n1/(1 + \u03c9) = 2/(1 + i\u221a"

Let me convert to exponential form.\n\ne^(2\u03c0i/3) = cos(2\u03c0/3) + i sin(2\u03c0/3) = (-1/2) + i (\u221a3/2).\n\nSo, 1 + \u03c9 = 1 + (-1/2) + i (\u221a3/2) = (1/2) + i (\u221a3/2).\n\nSimilarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + [cos(4\u03c0/3) + i sin(4\u03c0/3)] = 1 + (-1/2) + i (-\u221a3/2) = (1/2) - i (\u221a3/2).\n\nSo, 1/(1 + \u03c9) = 1/[(1/2) + i (\u221a3/2)] = multiply numerator and denominator by 2: 2 / (1 + i\u221a3).
