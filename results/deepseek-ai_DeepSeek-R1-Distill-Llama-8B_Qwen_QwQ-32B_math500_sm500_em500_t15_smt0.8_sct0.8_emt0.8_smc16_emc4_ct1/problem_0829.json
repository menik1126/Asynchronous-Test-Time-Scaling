            "output": "Alright, I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since ω³ = 1, ω is a cube root of unity. I remember that cube roots of unity satisfy the equation ω³ = 1, which can be rewritten as ω³ - 1 = 0. Factoring this, we get (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. So, the roots are ω = 1, ω = (-1 + i√3)/2, and ω = (-1 - i√3)/2. These are the three cube roots of unity.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Since ω can be 1, (-1 + i√3)/2, or (-1 - i√3)/2, I should consider each case separately.\n\nLet me first consider ω = 1. Plugging this into the expression, we get \\[\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1^2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1.\\] So, when ω = 1, the expression equals 1.\n\nNext, let's take ω = (-1 + i√3)/2. I need to compute \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Let me denote ω as (-1 + i√3)/2 and ω² as (-1 - i√3)/2 because I remember that ω² is the complex conjugate of ω when ω is a primitive cube root of unity.\n\nSo, let me compute 1 + ω first. 1 + ω would be 1 + (-1 + i√3)/2 = (2 -1 + i√3)/2 = (1 + i√3)/2. Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1 - i√3)/2 = (2 -1 - i√3)/2"

To rationalize the denominator, I can multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):\n\n2*(1 - i√3) / [(1 + i√3)(1 - i√3)] = 2*(1 - i√3) / (1 + 3) = 2*(1 - i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, \\[\\frac{1}{(1 - i√3)/2} = 2 / (1 - i√3).

Let me double-check that.\n\nWait, the denominator is (1 - i√3)(1 + i√3) = 1 + (i√3) - (i√3) - (i²*3) = 1 - (-1*3) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, yes, denominator is 4. So, numerator is 2*(1 + i√3), so divided by 4, it becomes (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nWait, let me correct myself:\n\nWait, 2 / (1 - i√3) is being rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 + i√3):\n\nSo, numerator: 2*(1 + i√3) = 2 + 2i√3\n\nDenominator: (1)^2 + (√3)^2 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the reciprocal is (2 + 2i√3)/4 = (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nWait, so that's the reciprocal of (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nWait, but in the expression, we have:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] We already found \\[\\"

Let me clarify.\n\nWait, when ω = (-1 + i√3)/2, then 1 + ω = 1 + (-1 + i√3)/2 = (2 -1 + i√3)/2 = (1 + i√3)/2. So, the reciprocal is 2/(1 + i√3). Rationalizing, as I did earlier, gives (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, ω² is [(-1) - i√3]/2, so 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1 - i√3)/2 = (2 -1 - i√3)/2 = (1 - i√3)/2. The reciprocal is 2/(1 - i√3) = (1 + i√3)/2, as above.\n\nSo, adding these two reciprocals:\n\n(1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = [1 - i√3 + 1 + i√3]/2 = (2)/2 = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, when ω is a primitive cube root of unity (i.e., ω ≠ 1), the expression also equals 1.\n\nWait, but when I took ω = 1, the expression also equals 1. So, does that mean all possible values of the expression are just 1? That seems surprising, but the calculation seems to confirm that.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If ω is a root of ω³ = 1, then:\n\nThe cube roots of unity are 1, ω, ω², where ω ≠ 1 but ω² = ω*, the complex conjugate.\n\nSo, let me verify again for ω = (-1 + i√3)/2, which is ω.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²):\n\n1 + ω = 1 + (-1 + i√3)/2 = (2 -1 + i√3)/2 = (1 + i√3)/2.\n\n1/(1 + ω) = 2/(1 + i√"
