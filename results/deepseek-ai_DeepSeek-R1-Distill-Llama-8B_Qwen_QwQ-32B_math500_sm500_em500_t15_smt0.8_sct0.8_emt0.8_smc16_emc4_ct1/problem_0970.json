Denali will receive 4x more dogs, making her total 16 + 4x. Nate's dogs remain at 12.\n\nFor the ratio of their pay to remain the same, the ratio of dogs must equal the ratio of their pay. Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n(16 + 4x) / 12 = 16 / 12\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(16 + 4x) = 16\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides:\n\n4x = 0\n\nThis implies that x = 0. However, the problem specifies that x ≠ 0, which means there might be an alternative interpretation.\n\nConsidering another scenario where x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali, Denali would walk 16 + x dogs, and Nate would walk 12 - x dogs. Setting their ratios equal:\n\n(16 + x) / (12 - x) = 16 / 12\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying:\n\n48 + 24x = 192 - 24x\n\n48 + 24x + 24x = 192\n\n48 + 48x = 192\n\n48x = 144\n\nx = 3\n\nThus, the value of x is 3.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks **16 dogs**.\n- Nate walks **12 dogs**.\n- Reassignment happens in groups of **x dogs**.\n\n**Under the new policy:**\n1. **First Scenario:** Denali walks **4x** more dogs, while Nate stays at **12 dogs**.\n2. **Second Scenario:** **x dogs** are reassigned from Nate to Denali, which means:\n   - Denali walks **16 + x dogs**.\n   - Nate walks **12 - x dogs**.\n\n**Let’s denote the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay as \\( R \\).**\n\n### Step 1: Apply the First Scenario\n- **After reassignment:**\n  - Denali walks \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs.\n  - Nate walks \\( 12 \\) dogs.\n  \n- According to the ratio \\( R \\):\n  \\[\n  R = \\"

Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
