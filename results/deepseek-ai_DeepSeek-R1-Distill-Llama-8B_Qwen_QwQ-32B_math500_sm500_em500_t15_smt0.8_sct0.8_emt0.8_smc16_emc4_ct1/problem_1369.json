            "output": "First, I need to define the variables. Let\u2019s let B represent the number of boys and G represent the number of girls attending the math club meeting.\n\nNext, I know that the total number of students is 35. So, I can write the equation:\nB + G = 35\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the number of girls is a multiple of 13, which means G can be 13, 26, or 39. However, since the total number of students is 35, G can't be 39 because that would exceed the total number of students. So, G can only be 13 or 26.\n\nIt\u2019s also mentioned that there are more girls than boys. This means that the number of girls is greater than the number of boys. Therefore, G must be greater than B.\n\nConsidering G = 13:\nIf G = 13, then the number of boys would be B = 35 - 13 = 22. But this contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys because 13 is not greater than 22.\n\nNow, let's try G = 26:\nIf G = 26, then the number of boys would be B = 35 - 26 = 9. In this case, 26 is greater than 9, which satisfies the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nTherefore, the only possible number of boys attending the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the number of boys.\n   - Let \\( G \\) represent the number of girls.\n\n2. **Total Number of Students:**\n   \\[\n   B + G = 35\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Number of Girls:**\n   - The number of girls (\\( G \\)) is a multiple of 13. Possible values for \\( G \\) are 13, 26, and 39.\n   - However, since the total number of students is 35, \\( G \\) cannot be 39 because \\( 35 - 39 = -4 \\), which isn't possible.\n   \n   So, possible values for \\( G \\) are 13 and 26.\n\n4. **Condition: There are more girls than boys:**\n   \\[\n   G > B\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Check Possible Values for \\( G \\):**\n"
