            "output": "To solve the problem, I start by letting \\( b \\) represent the number of boys and \\( g \\) represent the number of girls attending the math club meeting. The total number of students is 35, so the equation is:\n\n\\( b + g = 35 \\)\n\nNext, I know that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. This means \\( g \\) can be 13, 26, 39, and so on. However, since the total number of students is 35, the maximum number of girls possible is 26, because 35 minus 9 is 26.\n\nSince there are more girls than boys, I can set up the inequality:\n\n\\( g > b \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( g = 26 \\) into the total equation gives:\n\n\\( b + 26 = 35 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( b \\):\n\n\\( b = 35 - 26 \\)\n\\( b = 9 \\)\n\nTherefore, there are 9 boys attending the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( b \\) = number of boys\n- \\( g \\) = number of girls\n\n**Given:**\n1. Total number of students = 35\n2. Number of girls is a multiple of 13.\n3. There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Step 1:** Write the equation based on the total number of students.\n\n\\[\nb + g = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the possible values for \\( g \\). Since \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13 and must be less than 35, the possible values are:\n- \\( g = 13 \\)\n- \\( g = 26 \\)\n\n**Step 3:** Apply the condition that there are more girls than boys (\\( g > b \\)).\n\n**For \\( g = 13 \\):**\n\\[\nb + 13 = 35 \\implies b = 35 - 13 = 22\n\\]\nBut \\( g = 13 \\) is not greater than \\( b = 22 \\). This violates the condition.\n\n**For \\( g = 26 \\):**\n\\[\nb + 26 = 35 \\implies b = 35 - 26 = 9\n\\]\nHere, \\( g = 26 \\) is greater than \\( b = 9 \\), which satisfies the condition.\n\n"
