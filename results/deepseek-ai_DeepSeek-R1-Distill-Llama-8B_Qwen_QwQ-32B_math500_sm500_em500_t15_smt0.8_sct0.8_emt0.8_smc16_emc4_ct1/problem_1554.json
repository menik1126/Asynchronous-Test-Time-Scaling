For circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange \\(n\\) people is \\((n-1)!\\) because rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new configuration.\n\nApplying this to the square table, it's similar to a circular arrangement since rotation doesn't change the relative positions of the people. Each side of the square will have 2 people, so there are 4 sides.\n\nBefore considering the equivalence under rotation, the number of arrangements would be \\((8-1)! = 7! = 5040\\).\n\nHowever, since the table is square, which has rotational symmetry, I need to adjust for these symmetries. If the table were circular with 8 seats, the number of distinct arrangements would be \\(\\frac{7!}{8}\\) because each rotation of the entire table is equivalent.\n\nBut in this case, each side must have exactly 2 people, which complicates things. Instead of treating it as a circular table, I can treat each side as a fixed position relative to the starting point, ensuring that each rotation adjusts accordingly.\n\nSo, I'll fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. Fixing one person removes the circularity, leaving 7 people to arrange around the table. This gives \\(7! = 5040\\) arrangements.\n\nTherefore, there are 5040 distinct ways to seat the 8 people around the square table, considering rotations as equivalent.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotations as equivalent, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem as a Circular Arrangement**:\n   - A square table can be thought of as a circular arrangement because rotating the entire table doesn't change the seating order relative to the table's sides.\n   - In circular permutations, the formula is \\((n-1)!\\) for \\(n\\) distinct people because rotations are considered equivalent.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Permutations Without Considering Symmetry**:\n   - For 8 people, the total permutations are \\(8! = 40320\\).\n   - However, since we're treating the table as circular, we use \\(("

For example, fix one person at a specific side, leaving 7 remaining people to arrange.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After fixing one person, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways.\n   - Thus, the number of distinct seating arrangements is \\(7! = 5040\\).\n\n\\boxed{5040}"
