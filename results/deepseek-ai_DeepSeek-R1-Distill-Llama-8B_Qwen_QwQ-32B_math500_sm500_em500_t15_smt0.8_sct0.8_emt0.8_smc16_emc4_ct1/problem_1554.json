            "output": "First, I recognize that the problem involves seating 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side. Since the table is square, it has 4 sides, and each side will have 2 people seated.\n\nTo simplify the problem, I'll consider fixing one person's position. This is because rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new unique configuration. By fixing one person's seat, I eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\nAfter fixing one person's position, I need to determine how many ways the remaining 7 people can be seated around the table. Since the table has 4 sides and each side will have 2 people, I can think of this as arranging the 7 people in pairs on the sides.\n\nFirst, I'll choose 1 person out of the remaining 7 to sit next to the fixed person. This can be done in C(7,1) = 7 ways.\n\nOnce I've selected the partner for the fixed person, the next step is to arrange the remaining 6 people into the remaining 6 seats. Since the table has 4 sides and each side has 2 seats, I can think of this as arranging 3 pairs around the table.\n\nTo arrange these 3 pairs, I can consider the number of ways to distribute the remaining 6 people into the 6 seats. However, since the table is square and rotations are considered equivalent, I need to account for the symmetries.\n\nI realize that after fixing one person's position, the rotational symmetry is partially eliminated, but reflections (rotational symmetry of 180 degrees) still exist. This means that some arrangements might still be considered equivalent due to the table's symmetry.\n\nTo further simplify, I can consider that once two people are seated on the first side, the remaining sides can be arranged in 2! ways because the pairs can be swapped without creating a new configuration.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if this accounts for all symmetries. I think I need to use a more systematic approach.\n\nI recall that for circular arrangements with symmetries, the number of distinct arrangements can be calculated using Burnside's Lemma. This lemma considers the number of arrangements fixed by each symmetry operation and then averages them over the group of symmetries.\n\nIn this case, the symmetry group of the square table includes rotations by 90, 180, 270 degrees, and reflections. However, since we've fixed one person's position, some symmetries are"

Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps fixing one person's position already accounts for rotational symmetry, so we don't have to worry about rotations anymore. Let me think again.\n\nIf we fix one person's seat, then the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. However, since the table is square, there are still symmetries that can flip the table over, but the problem states that rotations are considered equivalent. Wait, the problem says \"Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.\" So reflections are considered different because they are not rotations.\n\nTherefore, fixing one person's position removes rotational symmetry, so the remaining arrangements can be considered without worrying about rotations. Therefore, the total number of arrangements would be (8-1)! divided by the rotational symmetry, but since we fixed one person, maybe it's just 7!.\n\nWait, but the problem is a square table with two people per side. So the total number of seats is 8, which is the same as a circular table with 8 seats. Normally, for a circular table, the number of seating arrangements is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But here, since it's a square table, perhaps the rotational symmetry is different?\n\nWait, a square table has rotational symmetry of order 4 (rotations by 90°, 180°, 270°, and 0°). So, if we consider rotational equivalence, the number of distinct arrangements would be total arrangements divided by 4. But the problem states that rotations are considered equivalent, so perhaps the formula is similar to circular tables but divided by 4 instead of n.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. So, the number of distinct arrangements would be (number of linear arrangements)/4. But how do we compute the linear arrangements?\n\nAlternatively, fixing one person's seat to account for rotational symmetry. Let me try that approach again.\n\nFix one person at a specific seat. Then, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. However, since the table is square, but we've fixed one seat, the rotational symmetry is already accounted for. Therefore, the total number would be 7!.\n\nWait, but in a circular"

Similarly, for a square table with rotational symmetry, fixing one seat would lead to (n-1)! arrangements. In this case, n=8, so it's 7! = 5040. But the problem is that the table is square, which might have more symmetries or less? Wait, the square table has the same rotational symmetry as a circular table because it's a circular arrangement with a specific pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps for a square table, the rotational symmetry group is smaller because of its shape, but for seating arrangements where only rotations are considered equivalent, it's similar to a circular table. So, fixing one seat gives 7! arrangements.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about seating with two people on each side. So, perhaps the number is higher because of the specific grouping on each side. So after fixing one person, we have to arrange the remaining people into pairs on each side.\n\nHmm, so maybe the approach is:\n\n1. Fix one person at a specific seat.\n2. Assign their partner to one of the remaining seats on their side. Since each side has two seats, the partner can be seated either to the left or right of the fixed person. But since the table is square, left and right can be considered equivalent through rotation.\n\nWait, no. If we've already fixed one seat, then the directions are fixed. So, left and right are distinct because we've fixed one position. Therefore, the partner can be seated in one of the remaining 1 seat on the same side.\n\nWait, but after fixing one person, there are 7 people left. The fixed person is on a side, so their seat is fixed, and one seat on their side is already occupied. So, their partner must be seated on the same side. Then, the remaining 6 people can be seated on the remaining 6 seats.\n\nWait, maybe the process is:\n\n- Fix one person at a seat. This removes rotational symmetry.\n- Determine which seat their partner takes on the same side (either clockwise or counterclockwise, but since the table is fixed, clockwise and counterclockwise are different).\n- Then, arrange the remaining 6 people on the remaining 6 seats.\n\nBut if we fix one seat, then the partner's seat is determined on the same side.

Let's label the seats as follows:\n\nImagine the square table with four sides: North, East, South, West. Each side has two seats: left and right. Let's fix the first person at the North-West seat. Then their partner must be seated at the North-East seat (the other seat on the North side). Alternatively, maybe the partner can be on either side? Wait, no, if we fix the first person at a specific seat, then the other seat on that side is fixed as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you fix one person's seat, the other seat on their side can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. So, first, fix person A at seat 1 (North-West). Then, the seat 2 (North-East) can be filled by any of the remaining 7 people. Then, the remaining 6 people can be arranged in the remaining 6 seats. However, since the table is square, but we've fixed one seat, the remaining arrangements can be done in 7 * 6! ways. But that would be 7 * 720 = 5040, which is the same as 7!.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's an overcounting here. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for circular arrangements where rotations are considered the same is (n-1)! So for 8 people around a circular table, it's 7!.\n\nBut in this case, the table is square, but the seating is still circular. So maybe the answer is 7!.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that the table is square with two people per side. Maybe the question is different because the sides are distinguishable? For example, if the sides are labeled (like North, East, etc.), then rotations would matter. But the problem says that rotations are considered equivalent. So, the sides are not labeled, so rotating the table doesn't change the configuration.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to a circular table with 8 seats, so the number of seating arrangements is (8-1)! = 5040. But the question mentions \"square table with 2 people on a side,\" so maybe there's an additional constraint?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the two people on each side are considered as a pair, so"

Then, for each of the remaining 6 people, we have to arrange them on the remaining 6 seats, which are on the other three sides. Each of these sides has two seats. So, perhaps the number is 1 (fixed person) * 7 (choices for partner) * 5! (arrangements of the remaining people) = 7 * 120 = 840. But wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, let me try again. After fixing one person (Person A) at seat 1, their partner must be at seat 2 on the same side. Then, the remaining 6 people can be arranged on the remaining 6 seats. But those seats are distributed as two seats on each of three sides. How many ways to arrange these 6 people?\n\nThis is equivalent to arranging 3 pairs on the remaining 6 seats. The number of ways to arrange 3 pairs is (6)! / (2!^3 * 3!). Wait, no. For circular arrangements with indistinct sides, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! but for square tables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's similar to arranging people in a circle. Since we've fixed one person, the remaining 7 can be arranged in a line, which is 7!.\n\nBut I'm getting confused because the square table has specific sides, which might affect the count.\n\nWait, the problem is that the table is square, so after fixing one seat, the other seats can be arranged in a circular manner, so perhaps 7! is correct.\n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me check standard references.\n\nIn standard combinatorics, the number of ways to seat n people around a circular table where rotations are considered equivalent is (n-1)!.\n\nHere, n=8, so (8-1)! = 5040.\n\nHowever, since the table is square, it's a special case of circular table, but the formula remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways should be 7! = 5040.\n\nBut wait, the problem specifically mentions that each side has 2 people.

For example, if the table has a North side, etc., then rotations would not be considered equivalent. But the problem states that rotations are considered equivalent, so sides are not labeled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7!.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose we fix one person's seat. Then, the rest can be arranged in 7! ways. Since rotations are accounted for by fixing that seat, so yes, 7!.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering that the two people on each side are seated in a way that their order matters. For example, on each side, the two people can be arranged in 2 ways. But since the table is square, maybe some of these arrangements are equivalent under rotation.\n\nWait, but if we fix one person's seat, then the partner on their side can be arranged in 1 way (since the seat is fixed). Wait, no. Let me think step by step.\n\nSuppose we fix person A at seat 1 (North-West corner). The seat adjacent to them on the North side is seat 2. The partner for seat 1 can be any of the remaining 7 people. So, 7 choices. Then, the remaining 6 people can be arranged in the remaining 6 seats.

Wait, perhaps the sides are considered as unordered pairs?\n\nWait, the problem says \"seated around a square table with 2 people on a side\". It doesn't specify whether the order on each side matters. In most seating arrangement problems, the order around the table matters, so each seat is distinct.

That seems correct because the rotational symmetry is accounted for by fixing one seat.\n\nSo, the number of ways is 7! = 5040.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways 8 people can be seated around a square table with 2 people on each side, we consider rotational symmetry.
