            "output": "First, I need to identify the pattern of the given series: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., 197, 199. I notice that these are consecutive odd numbers.\n\nNext, I'll determine the number of terms in this series. Since the sequence starts at 1 and each term increases by 2, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. Here, a_1 is 1, d is 2, and a_n is 199. Solving for n gives me 100 terms.\n\nNow, to find the sum of these terms, I'll use the formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers: S = n^2. Substituting n = 100, the sum is 100^2 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the modulo 7 remainder of 10,000. Dividing 10,000 by 7 gives a quotient of 1427 and a remainder of 1. Therefore, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 197 + 199\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The given series is a sequence of consecutive odd numbers.\n   \n2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**\n   - The first term (\\(a_1\\)) is \\(1\\).\n   - The common difference (\\(d\\)) is \\(2\\) since the numbers increase by \\(2\\) each time.\n   - The last term (\\(a_n\\)) is \\(199\\).\n   \n   Using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n   \\]\n   Substitute the known values:\n   \\[\n   199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   198 = 2(n - 1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n - 1 = 99 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n = 100\n   \\]\n   \n   So, there are \\(100\\) terms in the series.\n\n3. **Calculate"
