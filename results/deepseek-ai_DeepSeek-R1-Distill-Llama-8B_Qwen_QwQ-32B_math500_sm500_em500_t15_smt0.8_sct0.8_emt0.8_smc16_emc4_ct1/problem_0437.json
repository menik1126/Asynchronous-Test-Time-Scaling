The number of terms \\( n \\) can be found using the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nHere, \\( a_1 = 1 \\), \\( a_n = 199 \\), and \\( d = 2 \\). Plugging these values in:\n\\[\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\n198 = 2(n - 1) \\\\\nn - 1 = 99 \\\\\nn = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are 100 terms in this sequence.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers. The sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is given by the formula:\n\\[\nS_n = n^2\n\\]\nApplying this to our case:\n\\[\nS_{100} = 100^2 = 10,000\n\\]\nNow, I need to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7. To do this, I'll perform the division:\n\\[\n10,000 ÷ 7 = 1,428 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n\\]\nBecause \\( 7 \\times 1,428 = 9,996 \\) and \\( 10,000 - 9,996 = 4 \\), the remainder is 4.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 199 is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nLet's find the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\) is divided by \\(7\\).\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Number of Terms\nThe sequence \\(1, 3, 5, \\dots, 199\\) is an arithmetic sequence where:\n- **First term (\\(a_1\\))**: \\(1\\)\n- **Common difference (\\(d\\"
