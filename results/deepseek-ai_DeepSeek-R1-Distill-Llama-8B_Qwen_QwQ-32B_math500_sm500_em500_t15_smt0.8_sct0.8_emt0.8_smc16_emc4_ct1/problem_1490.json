Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\nListing out the prime numbers less than 30: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n\nNext, I'll consider the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2.\n\nLooking at the prime numbers less than 30, I notice that 2 is the only even prime number. All the other primes are odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of these two sets consists of all the odd prime numbers less than 30, excluding the number 2.\n\nSo, the elements in the intersection are: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n\nCounting these elements, there are 9 numbers in total.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Set of Prime Numbers Less Than 30:**\n   - Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n   - The prime numbers less than 30 are: \\(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Set of All Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero:**\n   - Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2.\n   - Examples of odd numbers include \\(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, \\ldots\\).\n\n3. **Find the Intersection of the Two Sets:**\n   - The intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd and less than 30.\n   - From the list of prime numbers less than 30, exclude the even prime number \\(2\\).\n   - The remaining numbers are: \\(3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\).\n\n4. **Count the Number of Elements in the Intersection:**\n   - There are **9** numbers in the intersection"
