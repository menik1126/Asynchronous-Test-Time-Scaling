It looks like we have two cubic terms on the left side and one cubic term on the right. Maybe I can expand both sides and simplify?\n\nFirst, I should probably write down the equation again so I don't lose track:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHmm, maybe before expanding everything, I can see if there's a substitution that can make this easier. Let me look at the terms on the right side: 2x - 10. I notice that 2x - 10 is just 2*(x - 5). That makes me think maybe substituting y = x - 5 could simplify things because both (x - 3) and (x - 7) can be expressed in terms of y.\n\nLet me try that substitution. So if y = x - 5, then:\n\nx = y + 5.\n\nSo, (x - 3) becomes (y + 5 - 3) = y + 2.\n\nAnd (x - 7) becomes (y + 5 - 7) = y - 2.\n\nSimilarly, the right side 2x - 10 becomes 2*(y + 5) - 10 = 2y + 10 - 10 = 2y.\n\nSo substituting these into the original equation, it becomes:\n\n(y + 2)^3 + (y - 2)^3 = (2y)^3.\n\nAlright, that looks a bit simpler. Now, let's expand the left side. I remember that (a + b)^3 + (a - b)^3 can be expanded using the binomial theorem.\n\nLet me compute (y + 2)^3 and (y - 2)^3 separately.\n\n(y + 2)^3 = y^3 + 3*y^2*2 + 3*y*(2)^2 + (2)^3 = y^3 + 6y^2 + 12y + 8.\n\nSimilarly, (y - 2)^3 = y^3 - 3*y^2*2 + 3*y*(2)^2 -"

Let me factor out the common term, which is -6y.\n\nFactoring:\n\n-6y(y^2 - 4) = 0.\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero:\n\nFirst factor: -6y = 0 \u2192 y = 0.\n\nSecond factor: y^2 - 4 = 0 \u2192 y^2 = 4 \u2192 y = 2 or y = -2.\n\nSo, the solutions for y are y = 0, y = 2, y = -2.\n\nBut remember, y was a substitution for x - 5, so let's write y in terms of x.\n\nSo, y = x - 5.\n\nTherefore, for each y, solve for x:\n\n1. y = 0 \u2192 x - 5 = 0 \u2192 x = 5.\n\n2. y = 2 \u2192 x - 5 = 2 \u2192 x = 7.\n\n3. y = -2 \u2192 x - 5 = -2 \u2192 x = 3.\n\nSo, the roots of the original equation are x = 3, x = 5, and x = "
