Hmm, it's a bit intimidating with all those cubes, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it. Let me start by writing down the equation again to have it clear in my mind.\n\nFirst, I notice that on the left side, I have two cubic terms: \\((x - 3)^3\\) and \\((x - 7)^3\\). The right side is another cubic term: \\((2x - 10)^3\\). I wonder if there's a way to expand these terms or perhaps factor them somehow. Let me think about the properties of cubes and how they might interact here.\n\nI remember that sometimes when you have an equation where the sum of two cubes equals another cube, it might be helpful to factor them or look for patterns. But before diving into expansions, maybe there's a smarter approach. Let me see if I can rewrite the equation in a way that makes it easier to handle.\n\nLooking at the right side, \\((2x - 10)^3\\), I notice that this can be rewritten as \\([2(x - 5)]^3\\), which simplifies to \\(8(x - 5)^3\\). That seems useful because it factors out a common term. Let me write that down:\n\n\\[\n(2x - 10)^3 = [2(x - 5)]^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\\]\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, maybe I can bring everything to one side to set the equation to zero. Let's subtract \\(8(x - 5)^3\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 - 8(x - 5)^3 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to expand each of these terms. Let me recall the binomial expansion formula for \\((a - b)^3\\), which is \\(a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3\\). I'll apply this to each term.\n\nStarting with \\((x - 3)^3\\):\n\n"

The GCD of 6, 90, 426, and 630. Let's see:\n\n- 6 divides all, but 630 ÷ 6 = 105, 426 ÷ 6 = 71, which is prime. So, 6 is a common divisor, but 6 is probably the GCD here.\n\nWait, but 6 is the GCD of all coefficients. Let me verify:\n\n- 6 | 6, yes\n- 6 | 90, yes\n- 6 | 426, yes (426 ÷ 6 = 71)\n- 6 | 630, yes (630 ÷ 6 = 105)\n\nSo, let me factor out a -6 to make the equation simpler.

Solving cubic equations can be tricky, but maybe I can factor this somehow. Let me try rational root theorem to see if there are any rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term over the factors of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -105, and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5,"
