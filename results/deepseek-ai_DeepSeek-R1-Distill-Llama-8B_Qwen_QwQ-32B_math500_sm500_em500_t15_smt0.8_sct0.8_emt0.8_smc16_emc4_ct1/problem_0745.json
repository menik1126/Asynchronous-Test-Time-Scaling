            "output": "Alright, so I've got this equation here: 2 raised to the power of 3 multiplied by 3 raised to the power of x equals 72. Hmm, okay, let me write that down to make sure I've got it right. So it's 2³ times 3ˣ equals 72. Okay, cool. I need to find the value of x that makes this equation true.\n\nFirst, I remember that when solving equations with exponents, it's often helpful to express both sides with the same base. In this case, the bases are 2 and 3. I know that 72 isn't a prime number, so maybe I can factor it into numbers that are powers of 2 and 3. Let's see, 72. I know that 8 times 9 is 72 because 8 times 9 is like 2³ times 3². Oh, nice, so maybe I can express 72 as 2³ multiplied by 3². That seems to fit because 2³ is 8 and 3² is 9, and 8 times 9 is indeed 72.\n\nSo if I rewrite the original equation using this, it would be 2³ times 3ˣ equals 2³ times 3². Now, if both sides have the same base factors, I can set the exponents equal to each other because of the property that aᵃ times aᵇ equals a^(a+b) when multiplied, but wait, no, actually, when the bases are the same, the exponents have to be equal. Let me think. If I have a common factor on both sides, like in this case, 2³ on both sides, then I can divide both sides by 2³ to simplify. So dividing both sides by 2³, I get 3ˣ equals 3².\n\nOkay, so now I have 3ˣ equals 3². Since the bases are the same, that means the exponents must be equal. So x must be equal to 2. That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me plug x back into the original equation to verify. So if x is 2, then the equation becomes 2³ times 3². Calculating that, 2³ is 8 and "

            "output": "3² is 9. Multiplying them together gives 8 * 9 = 72, which matches the right side of the equation. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nHmm, but let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe taking logarithms? Let's see. Starting over, the equation is 2³ * 3ˣ = 72. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides might be another method. Let's try that.\n\nTaking ln of both sides: ln(2³ * 3ˣ) = ln(72). Using logarithm properties, ln(a*b) = ln(a) + ln(b), so that becomes ln(2³) + ln(3ˣ) = ln(72). Then, using the power rule for logarithms, ln(a^b) = b*ln(a), so this becomes 3*ln(2) + x*ln(3) = ln(72).\n\nNow, solving for x. Let's subtract 3*ln(2) from both sides: x*ln(3) = ln(72) - 3*ln(2). Then, divide both sides by ln(3): x = [ln(72) - 3*ln(2)] / ln(3). Let me compute this numerically to see if it gives me 2.\n\nFirst, compute ln(72). Let me recall that ln(72) is the natural logarithm of 72. Since 72 is 8*9, ln(72) = ln(8*9) = ln(8) + ln(9). Then ln(8) is ln(2³) = 3*ln(2), and ln(9) is ln(3²) = 2*ln(3). So substituting back, ln(72) = 3*ln(2) + 2*ln(3). \n\nTherefore, substituting back into the equation for x: x = [3*ln(2) + 2*ln(3) - 3*ln(2)] / ln(3). The 3*ln(2) terms cancel out, leaving x = [2*ln(3)] / ln(3) = 2. Yep, that still gives me x = 2. So that method also confirms the answer"

            "output": ".\n\nAlternatively, I could have expressed 72 in prime factors. Let's see, 72 divided by 2 is 36, then divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 is 9, which is 3 squared. So 72 factorizes into 2³ * 3². That's the same as before. So 2³ * 3ˣ = 2³ *3². Therefore, x must be 2, as before.\n\nI think all methods lead to the same conclusion, so x is definitely 2. I don't think I made any calculation errors because both the algebraic method and the logarithmic method agree, and plugging the number back into the original equation also works. So yeah, x equals 2 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\):\n\n1. Factor 72 into prime factors: \\(72 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2\\).\n2. Substitute this into the equation: \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2\\).\n3. Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal: \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n4. Therefore, \\(x = 2\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{2}\\)"
