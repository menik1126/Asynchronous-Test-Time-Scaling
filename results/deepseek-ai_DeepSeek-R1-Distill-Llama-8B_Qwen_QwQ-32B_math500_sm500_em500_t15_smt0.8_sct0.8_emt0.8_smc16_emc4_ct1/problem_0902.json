I'm given the fraction \\( \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\) and I need to convert it into a terminating decimal.\n\nI recall that a fraction will result in a terminating decimal if, after simplifying, the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. This is because the decimal system is base 10, which is the same as \\( 2 \\times 5 \\).\n\nLooking at the denominator \\( 2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\), it already only has 2's and 5's as prime factors. Therefore, the fraction is already in the correct form to convert into a terminating decimal.\n\nNext, I'll simplify the fraction if possible. The numerator is 21, which factors into \\( 3 \\times 7 \\). The denominator is \\( 2^2 \\times 5^7 \\). Since there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator, the fraction cannot be simplified further.\n\nNow, to convert the improper fraction to a decimal, I'll divide the numerator by the denominator. However, since the denominator is a product of powers of 2 and 5, I can express the fraction as \\( 21 \\times 5^{-7} \\times 2^{-2} \\).\n\nCalculating this will give me a decimal. I'll move the decimal point seven places to the left for the \\( 5^{-7} \\) term and two places to the left for the \\( 2^{-2} \\) term, resulting in a total of nine places.\n\nMultiplying 21 by \\( 5^{-9} \\) and \\( 2^{-2} \\) will give me the final decimal value. This should be a terminating decimal because all the prime factors in the denominator are accounted for by 2 and 5.\n\nFinally, I'll carry out the multiplication and ensure the decimal is correctly placed to provide the final result.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Condition for Terminating Decimals**:\n   - A fraction will result in a terminating decimal if its denominator (after simplifying) has only the prime factors 2 and/or 5.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Fraction**:\n   - The denominator is \\(2^"

Thus, it will terminate.\n\n3. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   - The numerator (21) and denominator (\\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\)) share no common factors, so the fraction is already in simplest form.\n\n4. **Express the Denominator as a Power of 10**:\n   - Rewrite the denominator to have equal exponents of 2 and 5. Since \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 5^5 = 10^2 \\cdot 5^5\\), we can adjust the fraction:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21}{10^2 \\cdot 5^5}\n     \\]\n   - To make the denominator a power of 10, multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^5\\) (to balance \\(5^5\\)):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21 \\times 2^5}{10^2 \\cdot 10^5} = \\frac{21 \\times 32}{10^7}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Numerator**:\n   - Compute \\(21 \\times 32 = 672\\).\n\n6. **Divide by \\(10^7\\)**:\n   - The fraction becomes \\(\\frac{672}{10^7}\\), which is \\(0.0000672\\) when written as a decimal.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{0.0000672}\\)"
