To convert it into a terminating decimal, I need to ensure that the denominator only contains the prime factors 2 and/or 5.\n\nI notice that the denominator already has \\(2^2\\) and \\(5^7\\), which are the necessary prime factors for the decimal to terminate. Therefore, the fraction is already in a form that can be expressed as a terminating decimal without the need for further adjustment.\n\nFinally, I can convert the fraction to its decimal form by performing the division \\(21 \\div (2^2 \\cdot 5^7)\\).\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).\n   - This product ensures that the decimal will terminate because, according to the **Convergence Test for Decimal Expansion**, a fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and/or 5 after simplifying.\n\n2. **Confirm the Prime Factors:**\n   - The denominator already consists solely of the prime factors 2 and 5.\n   - Therefore, the fraction is already in a form that will result in a terminating decimal.\n\n3. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   - Calculate the denominator:\n     \\[\n     2^2 = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 5^7 = 78125\n     \\]\n   - Multiply these together:\n     \\[\n     4 \\cdot 78125 = 312500\n     \\]\n   - Now, divide the numerator (21) by the denominator (312500):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21}{312500} \\approx 0.0000672\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.0000672}\n   \\]"
