When I carry out this division, I notice that after the initial digits, a repeating pattern emerges.\n\nNext, I will identify the length of the repeating sequence. Observing the decimal expansion, I see that the same sequence of digits consistently repeats.\n\nFinally, I will count the number of digits in this repeating sequence. The repeating decimal pattern in this case is three digits long.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of digits that repeat in the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Perform the Division**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111} = 0.0028028028\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify the Repeating Sequence**:\n   After the decimal point, the digits \\(0028\\) repeatedly appear.\n   \n3. **Determine the Length of the Repeating Block**:\n   The repeating block is \\(0028\\), which consists of **4** digits.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"

How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\nFor example, if you get the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{123},$ then your answer should be $3,$ and if you get $0.436\\overline{7},$ your answer should be $1.$",
