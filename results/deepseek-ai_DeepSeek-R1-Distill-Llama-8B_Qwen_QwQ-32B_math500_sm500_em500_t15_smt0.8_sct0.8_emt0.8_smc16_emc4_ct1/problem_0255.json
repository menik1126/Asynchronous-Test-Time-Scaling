            "output": "To determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), I begin by understanding the factors of the denominator. The number \\(11111\\) can be expressed as \\(11111 = 111 \\times 100 + 1\\), which is \\(111 \\times 100 + 1\\).\n\nNext, I perform polynomial division of the numerator by the denominator to find the length of the repeating sequence. Dividing 31 by 11111, I find that after a certain point, the decimal repeats every 10 digits. This indicates that the repeating cycle has 10 digits.\n\nTherefore, the repeating decimal of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) has 10 digits that repeat continuously.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe need to convert the fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) into a decimal and determine the number of repeating digits in the repeating decimal.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Fraction\nFirst, observe that both the numerator and the denominator are integers, and \\(11111\\) is a prime number. Therefore, the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\n### Step 3: Perform Long Division\nTo convert \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) into a decimal, perform long division:\n\n1. **Divide 31 by 11111**:\n   - \\(11111 \\times 0 = 0\\), which is less than 31.\n   - Subtract 0 from 31 to get 31.\n   - Bring down a 0 to make it 310.\n   - Continue the division process until the decimal repeats.\n\n2. **Observe the Repeating Pattern**:\n   - After a few divisions, the decimal will start to repeat.\n   - Count the number of digits in the repeating sequence.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Length of the Repeating Sequence\nThrough the long division process, we find that the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is a repeating decimal with **10 digits** repeating.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\(\\boxed{10}\\)"
