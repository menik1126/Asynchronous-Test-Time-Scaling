            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O. The rectangle has sides AB and AD with a ratio of k, so AB divided by AD is k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, or D.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. First, I should visualize the rectangle. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB equals CD and AD equals BC. The center O is the intersection point of the diagonals. That makes sense because in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other.\n\nThe ratio of AB to AD is k. Let me denote AB as the length and AD as the width. So, AB = k * AD. Without loss of generality, I can assign specific lengths to AB and AD to make calculations easier. Let's say AD = 1, then AB would be k. So the rectangle has sides of length 1 and k.\n\nWait, but actually, it might be better to use variables since we don't know the specific lengths. Let me denote AB as 'l' (length) and AD as 'w' (width). Given that AB/AD = k, so l/w = k, which implies l = k * w. That way, I can work with variables l and w, where l is k times w. Alternatively, to simplify, I could set AD = 1, making AB = k. That might make the calculations simpler because then the area of the rectangle would be AD * AB = 1 * k = k. So the area is k, and then I can find the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex.\n\nProbability, in this case, would be the area of the region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex divided by the total area of the rectangle. So the probability P is equal to the area of the region divided by k (since the total area is k). So P = (desired area) / k.\n\nNow, I need to find the set of points inside the rectangle that are closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D. So, for a given point P in the rectangle, the distance from P to O is less than the distance from P to A, to B, to C, and to D.\n\nLet me"

Similarly for the other vertices. The intersection of all these regions (closer to O than A, B, C, D) would be the region we need.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to consider the Voronoi regions around each vertex and the center. The Voronoi region for O would be the set of points closer to O than to any vertex. The boundaries between these regions are the perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting O to each vertex.\n\nSo, to find the region closer to O than to any vertex, I need to construct the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex, then the intersection of all those regions (closer to O than each vertex) would be the desired area.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let me place the rectangle such that the center O is at the origin (0,0). Since the rectangle is centered at O, the coordinates of the vertices can be given as follows:\n\n- A is at (-l/2, w/2)\n- B is at (l/2, w/2)\n- C is at (l/2, -w/2)\n- D is at (-l/2, -w/2)\n\nWait, actually, since AB is the length and AD is the width, then if we consider AB as horizontal, then the coordinates would be:\n\nLet me confirm. Let me think of the rectangle with center at (0,0). Then the sides are of length AB = l and AD = w. So the coordinates would be:\n\n- A: (-l/2, w/2)\n- B: (l/2, w/2)\n- C: (l/2, -w/2)\n- D: (-l/2, -w/2)\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the rectangle extends from -l/2 to l/2 along the x-axis and from -w/2 to w/2 along the y-axis.\n\nGiven that AB/AD = k, so l/w = k, so l = k * w. Let me set w = 1 for simplicity, so l = k. Then the coordinates become:\n\n- A: (-k/2, 1/2)\n- B: (k/"

So the probability would be (desired area) / k.\n\nNow, to find the region where distance to O is less than distance to each vertex. Let me write the distance formulas.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a point P as (x, y). The distance from P to O is sqrt(x^2 + y^2).\n\nDistance from P to A is sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 )\n\nSimilarly, distance from P to B is sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 )\n\nDistance to C is sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\nDistance to D is sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\nWe need all these distances to be greater than the distance to O.\n\nTherefore, for a point (x, y), the following inequalities must hold:\n\n1. sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 )\n\n2. sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 )\n\n3. sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\n4. sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\nTo simplify, I can square both sides of each"

So the area of this diamond is 2*2=4 (since it's a square rotated by 45 degrees with diagonals of length 2). But the area of the original square is 4, so the probability would be 4/4=1. That can't be right because the points on the edges of this diamond are exactly equidistant to O and the vertices, but points inside are closer to O.\n\nWait, but actually, this region is the entire square except for four small triangles near each vertex.\n\nWait, no, for each vertex, the region closer to the vertex than to the center is a sector of 45 degrees, perhaps? So the area of each sector is (1/8)*area of the square, so 4*(1/8) = 0.5.\n\nWait, then the area closer to O would be 4 - 0.5=3.5, so probability is 3.5/4=7/8. But that conflicts with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for k=1, the desired probability is 1/4, based on symmetry.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to compute it more carefully.\n\nWait, going back to the problem when k=1, the area in the first quadrant calculated earlier was 0.125, so total area would be 4*0.125=0.5, so probability is 0.5.\n\nBut that seems too high because the region closer to O shouldn't be more than 1/2 in a square.\n\nWait, but in the square, the region where points are closer to the center than to any vertex includes a diamond shape, but the area of that diamond is 2*2=4, same as the square, which is incorrect because that can't be.\n\nWait, no, the area of the diamond where the points are closer to O is actually a square with side length sqrt(2), but that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.\n\nThe region where a point is closer"
