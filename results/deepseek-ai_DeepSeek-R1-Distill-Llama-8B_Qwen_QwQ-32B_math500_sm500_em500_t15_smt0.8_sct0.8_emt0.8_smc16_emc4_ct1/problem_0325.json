The number of combinations of 7 boys taken 3 at a time is calculated as C(7,3).\n\nOnce the boys are chosen, I'll calculate the number of ways to pick 2 girls out of 4 using the combination formula again. This is C(4,2).\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to form the group, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls. That is, C(7,3) multiplied by C(4,2).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can select 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll use combinations since the order of selection doesn't matter.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two combinations to find the total number of ways to form the group.**\n\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
