            "output": "To determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, I'll consider the combinations of boys and girls separately and then multiply the results.\n\nFirst, there are 7 boys in the class, and Mr. Brennan needs to choose 3. The number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7 is calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!) = 35.\n\nNext, there are 4 girls in the class, and he needs to choose 2. The number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4 is:\n\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to pick both boys and girls together, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls:\n\nTotal ways = C(7, 3) * C(4, 2) = 35 * 6 = 210.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nMr. Brennan needs to select 3 boys out of 7 and 2 girls out of 4. Since the order of selection does not matter, we'll use combinations.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two results to find the total number of ways:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = \\binom{7}{3} \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
