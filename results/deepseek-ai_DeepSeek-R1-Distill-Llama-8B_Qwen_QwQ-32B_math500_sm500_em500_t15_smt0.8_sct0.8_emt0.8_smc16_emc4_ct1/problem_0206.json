I'm supposed to find all the integer roots. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can help find possible rational roots. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\), has a numerator \\( p \\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\( q \\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at this equation, the leading coefficient is 1 (since the \\(x^4\\) term has a coefficient of 1), and the constant term is -14. So, the possible rational roots should be factors of -14 divided by factors of 1, which simplifies to just the integer factors of -14.\n\nLet's list the factors of -14: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nSo, the possible integer roots are: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.\n\nNow, I need to test each of these possible candidates to see if they satisfy the equation \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). If I plug in one of these values for x and the equation equals zero, then that x is an integer root.\n\nLet me start with the smaller numbers because they are easier to compute.\n\nFirst, let's try x = 1:\n\n\\(1^4 + 5*1^3 + 9*1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 -14\\)\n\nCalculating step by step:\n1 + 5 = 6\n6 + 9 = 15\n15 - 1 = 14\n14 -14 = 0\n\nOh, that worked! So x = 1 is a root.\n\nNext, x = -1:\n\n\\((-1)^4 + 5*(-1)^3 + 9*(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14\\)\n\nCalculating each term:\n(-1)^4 = "
