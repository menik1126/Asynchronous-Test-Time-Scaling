I remember that for polynomial equations, especially quartic ones, it can be a bit tricky, but maybe there are some integer roots that I can find using the Rational Root Theorem. Let me recall how that works.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are just the factors of -14 divided by factors of 1, which are just the integer factors of -14.\n\nFactors of -14 are: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nSo, my possible integer roots are limited to these: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.\n\nGreat, so I can test these values one by one by substituting into the equation to see if any of them satisfy it. That is, for each integer candidate, plug it into the equation and see if the result equals zero.\n\nLet me start with x = 1.\n\nPlugging x=1 into the equation:\n\n1^4 + 5*(1)^3 + 9*(1)^2 - 1 - 14\n\nCalculates as:\n\n1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0.\n\nOh, so x=1 is a root! Nice.\n\nNow, let me check x=-1.\n\nPlugging x=-1:\n\n(-1)^4 + 5*(-1)^3 + 9*(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14\n\nCalculates as:\n\n1 + 5*(-1) + 9*(1) +1 -14\n\nWhich is: 1 -5 +9 +1 -14\n\nAdding up: 1 -5 is -4, plus 9 is 5, plus 1 is 6, minus 14 is -8. So, not zero. So -1"

Or maybe these are the only integer roots.\n\nWait, but in case of multiple roots, perhaps one of these is a double root or something.
