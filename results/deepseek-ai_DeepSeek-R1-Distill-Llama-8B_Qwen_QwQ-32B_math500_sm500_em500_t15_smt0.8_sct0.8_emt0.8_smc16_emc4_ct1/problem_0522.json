            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the fraction (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)). Hmm, I remember from algebra that when you have a fraction with a radical in the denominator, you can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate is just the same expression but with the sign between the terms reversed, right? So in this case, the denominator is 2 + sqrt(3), so its conjugate should be 2 - sqrt(3). \n\nAlright, so I'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2 - sqrt(3). That means:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2)) * (2 - sqrt(3)) / [ (2 + sqrt(3))(2 - sqrt(3)) ]\n\nNow, let me calculate the denominator first because it might be easier without the radical. Using the difference of squares formula, (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. So here, a is 2 and b is sqrt(3). So, 2\u00b2 is 4, and (sqrt(3))\u00b2 is 3. Therefore, the denominator becomes 4 - 3, which is 1. Oh, that's nice because it simplifies things. So the denominator is 1, which makes the whole fraction just the numerator.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Even though the denominator simplifies to 1, I still have to multiply the numerator out because I can't just leave it as is. So, let me multiply (1 + sqrt(2)) by (2 - sqrt(3)). This will be a bit of distributive property. Let's see:\n\nFirst, 1*(2) = 2. Then, 1*(-sqrt(3)) = -sqrt(3). Next, sqrt(2)*2 = 2sqrt(2). And finally, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(3)) = -sqrt(6). So putting it all together, the numerator becomes:\n\n2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6)\n\nSo now, the fraction is just this entire numerator because the denominator is 1. So the simplified form is 2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6).\n\nBut wait, the problem asks to express the solution in the form A(1 +"

Let me see how to rearrange the terms to match that form.\n\nFirst, let me look at the terms I have:\n\n2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6)\n\nHmm, maybe I can group some terms together. Let's see. The problem's desired form has A multiplied by (1 + sqrt(B)), so perhaps I can find a common factor in some terms. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the terms, 2 can be written as 2*1, and 2sqrt(2) is 2*sqrt(2). So maybe if I factor out a 2 from those two terms, I get 2*(1 + sqrt(2)). Then the remaining terms are -sqrt(3) - sqrt(6). \n\nSo putting that together, it would be 2*(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)). \n\nWait, that seems to fit the form they want! Let me check:\n\nA(1 + sqrt(B)) - (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D))\n\nComparing term by term:\n\nA is 2, since the first part is 2*(1 + sqrt(2)), so B would be 2. Then the subtracted part is (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)), so C is 3 and D is 6. \n\nTherefore, A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. Adding them up: 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13. \n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting over, original expression: (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)). Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(3)):\n\nNumerator: (1 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(3)) = 1*2 + 1*(-sqrt(3)) + sqrt(2)*2 + sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(3)) = 2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6). \n\nDenominator: (2)^2 - (sqrt(3))^2 = 4 - 3 = 1. \n\nSo the simplified expression is indeed 2 - sqrt(3) + 2sqrt(2) - sqrt(6). \n\nThen,"

Wait, but in the problem statement, the desired form is A(1 + sqrt(B)) - (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)). So sqrt(C) and sqrt(D) are separate, right? In my case, I have sqrt(3) and sqrt(6), so that's correct because they are separate terms. So yes, that's the right grouping. \n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the value numerically. Maybe that will help cross-verify.\n\nCompute original expression: (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)).\n\nCompute sqrt(2) \u2248 1.4142, so numerator \u2248 1 + 1.4142 \u2248 2.4142.\n\nDenominator: 2 + sqrt(3) \u2248 2 + 1.732 \u2248 3.732.\n\nSo 2.4142 / 3.732 \u2248 0.6449.\n\nNow, compute 2*(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)).\n\nCompute 2 + 2*sqrt(2) \u2248 2 + 2.8284 \u2248 4.8284.\n\nCompute sqrt(3) + sqrt(6) \u2248 1.732 + 2.4495 \u2248 4.1815.\n\nSo 4.8284 - 4.1815 \u2248 0.6469.\n\nHmm, that's very close to the original 0.6449, so seems accurate. The small difference is due to rounding in the decimal approximations. So that gives me more confidence that my algebraic manipulation was correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6, and their sum is 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2"
