            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the modulus of a complex number w. Let me break it down step by step. Okay, the problem states that z is equal to 1 + i, and w is given by the expression (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). I need to compute |w|, which is the modulus of w.\n\nFirst, let me recall what modulus means for a complex number. If I have a complex number a + bi, the modulus is sqrt(a² + b²). So, after I find w, I can compute its modulus by squaring the real and imaginary parts, adding them, and taking the square root.\n\nBut before I can find |w|, I need to determine what w is. Since w is defined in terms of z, I think I should first substitute z = 1 + i into the expression for w. Let me write that out.\n\nSo, w = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). Let's compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 3z + 1. Substituting z = 1 + i gives me 3*(1 + i) + 1. Let's compute that. 3*1 is 3, and 3*i is 3i. So, adding those together, I get 3 + 3i. Then, adding the 1, that becomes 4 + 3i.\n\nNow, moving on to the denominator: 5z + 7. Substituting z = 1 + i, this becomes 5*(1 + i) + 7. Calculating that, 5*1 is 5, and 5*i is 5i. Adding those together gives 5 + 5i. Then, adding 7, that becomes 12 + 5i.\n\nSo now, w is equal to (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). To find the modulus of w, I need to compute |w|. Remember that the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli. That is, |w| = |(3z + 1)/(5z + 7)| = |3z + 1| / |5z + 7|.\n\nSo, I can compute |3z + 1| and |5z + 7| separately.\n\n"

            "output": "Starting with |3z + 1|. Since z = 1 + i, let's compute 3z + 1 again: 3*(1 + i) + 1 = 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i, as I found earlier. The modulus of this complex number is sqrt(4² + 3²) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nNow, computing |5z + 7|. We found earlier that 5z + 7 is 12 + 5i. The modulus is sqrt(12² + 5²) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13.\n\nTherefore, |w| is equal to |3z + 1| / |5z + 7| = 5 / 13. That seems straightforward, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my substitution or calculations.\n\nWait a minute, just to double-check, let me go through each step again. When I computed 3z, I substituted z = 1 + i, which is 3*1 + 3*i, so 3 + 3i. Then adding 1 gives 4 + 3i. That looks correct. For the denominator, 5z is 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i, then adding 7 gives 12 + 5i. That also seems right.\n\nCalculating the modulus: for 4 + 3i, sqrt(4² + 3²) is 5, and for 12 + 5i, sqrt(12² + 5²) is 13. So, dividing those gives 5/13. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is by rationalizing the denominator. Maybe I should try that method to cross-verify my result.\n\nSo, if I have w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i), I can multiply both numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it. The complex conjugate of the denominator 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i.\n\nSo, let's do that: (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i) * (12 - 5i)/(12 - 5i) = ["

            "output": " (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) ] / [ (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i) ]\n\nFirst, compute the denominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i). This is a difference of squares, so 12² - (5i)² = 144 - 25i². Since i² = -1, this becomes 144 - 25*(-1) = 144 +25 = 169. So, the denominator is 169, which checks out with the earlier modulus.\n\nNow, the numerator: (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i). Let me compute that.\n\nMultiplying 4 by 12 is 48, 4 by -5i is -20i. Then, 3i * 12 is 36i, and 3i * (-5i) is -15i². So, adding all those together: 48 - 20i + 36i -15i².\n\nSimplify the terms: combine like terms. The real parts are 48 and -15i². Wait, since i² = -1, -15i² is -15*(-1) = 15. So, real parts are 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nImaginary parts: -20i + 36i = 16i.\n\nSo, the numerator becomes 63 + 16i.\n\nThus, w = (63 + 16i)/169. So, in the form a + bi, that's 63/169 + (16/169)i.\n\nNow, to find |w|, compute sqrt( (63/169)² + (16/169)² ). Which is (1/169) * sqrt(63² + 16²). Let's compute sqrt(63² + 16²).\n\n63 squared is 3969, 16 squared is 256, so sum is 3969 + 256 = 4225. sqrt(4225) is 65.\n\nSo, |w| = 65 / 169. Wait, 65 and 169, both are divisible by 13. 65 divided by 13 is 5, and 169 divided by 13 is 13. So, that simplifies to 5/13.\n\nOh, that's the same result as before. So, both methods give me"

            "output": " 5/13. That seems to confirm my previous answer. So, |w| is 5/13.\n\nWait, let me just think if there is another way to approach this. Maybe using properties of complex numbers. Since modulus is multiplicative, as I used earlier, but perhaps if I didn't use that property, and instead directly compute w and its modulus, perhaps using another method?\n\nAlternatively, suppose I didn't rationalize the denominator, but instead expressed w in terms of its real and imaginary parts, then took modulus directly. Let me try that.\n\nGiven w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). Let me express this as a complex number in the form a + bi. So, I can write it as:\n\nw = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i) = (4 + 3i)*(1)/(12 + 5i). As done earlier, to separate into real and imaginary parts, I would need to rationalize the denominator. Which is exactly what I did before, leading to the same result. So, that seems to be the standard approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using polar forms for z and then computing w, but that might be more complicated. Let me see.\n\nFirst, z = 1 + i, so in polar form, its modulus is sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2), and its argument is 45 degrees or π/4 radians.\n\nSo, z = sqrt(2) * (cos π/4 + i sin π/4).\n\nThen, 3z + 1 would be 3*sqrt(2)*(cos π/4 + i sin π/4) + 1. Hmm, that seems messy, but let's compute it.\n\nCompute 3*sqrt(2)*(cos π/4 + i sin π/4) = 3*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 3*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 3*(2)/2*(1 + i) = 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i. Which matches our earlier result, 4 + 3i? Wait, no, wait. 3z +1 is 4 + 3i. Hmm, that doesn't match the 3*(1 + i) which is 3 +"

So, the polar form approach here just leads back to the same rectangular coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to compute the modulus directly using the formula for modulus of a quotient. Since modulus of (a/b) is |a| / |b|, so that's straightforward. Since I already found |3z +1| =5 and |5z +7|=13, so 5/13 is the modulus. So, that's the easiest way.\n\nHmm, so all methods lead to the same answer, so I think that's solid. Therefore, the modulus of w is 5/13.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if I substituted z correctly into the expressions. The problem says w = (3z +1)/(5z +7). So, substituting z =1 +i, so numerator is 3*(1+i) +1, which is 3+3i +1 =4+3i. Denominator is 5*(1+i)+7 =5+5i +7 =12+5i. Yes, that's correct. So, the substitution is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in modulus calculation? Let me check again.\n\nFor numerator 4 +3i: modulus squared is 4² +3² =16+9=25, so sqrt(25)=5. Correct.\n\nDenominator 12+5i: modulus squared is 12² +5²=144+25=169, sqrt(169)=13. Correct.\n\nSo, 5 divided by 13 is indeed 5/13. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a linear fractional transformation, but that's probably overcomplicating. The problem is straightforward.\n\nHmm, I think that's thorough. I can't see any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 5/13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulus of \\( w \\) where \\( z = 1 + i \\) and \\( w = \\dfrac{3z + 1}{5z + 7} \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Sub"
