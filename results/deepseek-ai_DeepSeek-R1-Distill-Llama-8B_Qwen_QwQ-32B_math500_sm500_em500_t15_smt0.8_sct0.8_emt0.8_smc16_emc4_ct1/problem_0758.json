It seems a bit tricky at first, but if I break it down, maybe I can figure it out.\n\nSo, the problem is about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots \\) with two specific properties:\n\n1. For every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric.\n2. For every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is arithmetic.\n\nWe are told that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\) and need to find \\( a_1 \\).\n\nAlright, let me start by recalling what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\nA geometric sequence has each term after the first obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio, say \\( r \\). So, if \\( a, b, c \\) are in geometric sequence, then \\( b = a \\times r \\) and \\( c = b \\times r = a \\times r^2 \\).\n\nAn arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, has each term after the first obtained by adding a constant difference, say \\( d \\), to the previous term. So, if \\( a, b, c \\) are in arithmetic sequence, then \\( b = a + d \\) and \\( c = b + d = a + 2d \\).\n\nGiven these definitions, let's try to set up equations based on the problem's conditions.\n\nStarting with the first condition: For every \\( k \\), \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric.\n\nSo, for a specific \\( k \\), let's say \\( k = 1 \\), the terms would be \\( a_1, a_2, a_3 \\). Then \\( a_2 = a_1 \\times r_1 \\) and \\( a_3 = a_2 \\times r_1 \\), where \\( r_1 \\) is the common ratio for this geometric sequence.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( k = 2 \\), the terms \\( a_3, a_4, a_5 \\) would form a geometric sequence. So, \\("

Or is it a single ratio that applies across all? The problem doesn't specify, so I think each \\( k \\) could have a different ratio. So each set of three terms \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric on its own, possibly with a different ratio each time.\n\nSimilarly, the second condition applies: For every \\( k \\), \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is arithmetic. So, for \\( k = 1 \\), the terms \\( a_2, a_3, a_4 \\) form an arithmetic sequence, so \\( a_3 = a_2 + d_1 \\) and \\( a_4 = a_3 + d_1 = a_2 + 2d_1 \\). For \\( k = 2 \\), the terms \\( a_4, a_5, a_6 \\) form another arithmetic sequence, so \\( a_5 = a_4 + d_2 \\) and \\( a_6 = a_5 + d_2 = a_4 + 2d_2 \\), and so on.\n\nHmm, this seems like a lot of variables—each \\( k \\) introduces new \\( r_k \\) and \\( d_k \\). But maybe there's a pattern or a way to relate these variables.\n\nGiven that the sequence is strictly increasing, all the ratios \\( r_k \\) must be greater than 1 (since otherwise, the terms could decrease or stay the same, which would contradict strictly increasing). Similarly, the differences \\( d_k \\) must be positive.\n\nSince the problem provides \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\), we can think that by working our way up from \\( a_1 \\) using the given conditions, we can express \\( a_{13} \\) in terms of \\( a_1 \\) and then solve for it.\n\nLet me attempt to express \\( a_3 \\) in terms of \\( a_1 \\)."

Because the sequence consists of positive integers and is strictly increasing, so all terms must be integers, so the ratios must be rational numbers?

Therefore, the ratios in the geometric sequences must be rational numbers such that multiplying by them gives integers. However, since the sequence is strictly increasing, the ratios must be greater than 1 (since terms are increasing). But ratios could be fractions, but then the terms would have to be multiples of denominators. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios are integers.
