The sequence is denoted as a₁, a₂, a₃, and so on. The problem states that for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is a geometric sequence, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence. Also, it's given that a₁₃ = 2016, and I need to find a₁.\n\nHmm, okay. So let me break this down. For every k, the three-term subsequence starting at 2k-1 is geometric, meaning each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Then, the next subsequence starting at 2k is arithmetic, meaning each term is added by a common difference. And the sequence is strictly increasing, so each term is larger than the previous one.\n\nSince it's a geometric sequence for a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, that means:\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r_k\n\nand\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k = a_{2k-1} * r_k²\n\nSimilarly, the arithmetic sequence for a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} means:\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k = a_{2k} + d_k\n\nBut since the arithmetic sequence is a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, the common difference d_k would be a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}, right? So:\n\nd_k = a_{2k+1} - a_{2k}\n\nWait, and since the geometric sequence is a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, we can write a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r_k, and a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k, so that a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k} (r"

But since a_{2k+2} is part of the next geometric sequence starting at 2k+1, which would be a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, a_{2k+3}. So, similar to the geometric sequence for k, that term is:\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} * r_{k+1}\n\nHmm, wait. Wait, perhaps I should write down the relationships between the terms more formally.\n\nLet me index these sequences. For each k, the geometric sequence starts at a_{2k-1}, so:\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r_k\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k = a_{2k-1} * r_k²\n\nSimilarly, the arithmetic sequence starting at a_{2k}:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k\n\nBut we also know from the geometric sequence starting at 2k+1 that a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} * r_{k+1}\n\nSo, from the arithmetic sequence:\n\nd_k = a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k} * r_k - a_{2k} = a_{2k} (r_k - 1)\n\nAnd from the geometric sequence starting at 2k+1:\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} * r_{k+1}\n\nBut from the arithmetic sequence, a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k = a_{2k+1} + a_{2k} (r_k - 1)\n\nSubstituting a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k, that gives:\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k} * r_k + a_{2k} (r_k - 1) = a_{2k"

Since r1 is an integer ≥2, 1/r1 is a fraction less than 1. So 2 - 1/r1 must be an integer. The only way this can happen is if 1/r1 is an integer, but since r1 ≥2, 1/r1 is less than 1, so the only possibility is that 1/r1 is 0, which is impossible, or that the fractional part cancels out. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps r1 divides (2r1 -1). Let me write that:\n\nLet me suppose that r1 divides (2r1 -1). Then, 2r1 -1 = m * r1, where m is an integer.

Alternatively, perhaps all the ratios r_k are integers. Wait, in the given problem, a13=2016, so it's possible that r_k is 2, but maybe that doesn't work because as I saw earlier, for r1=2, r2= (2*2 -1)/2= 3/2, which is 1.5, not integer.

Maybe an alternative approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratios r_k form a periodic sequence. Let me try to compute some terms with a starting r1 and see if a period occurs.\n\nBut considering the earlier attempt with r1=3 leads to non-integer a13, perhaps the correct r1 is such that a13=2016, so maybe 2016 is divisible by the term 69a1, which I had earlier, but 2016/69 is not integer, so perhaps r1 isn't 3. Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting ratio is different, say r1=4.\n\nLet me try to compute a1= ?\n\nBut this might take a long time. Alternatively, since a13=2016, and a13 is a geometric sequence term, maybe there's a better way to express a13.\n\nWait, from the formula I had earlier, a_{n}=3a1(2n -3) for n≥2, which for n=13 gives a13=3a1*(26-3)=3a1*23=69a1. Thus, 69a1=2016, which would imply a1"

So that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, my formula must be incorrect. Which suggests that my initial assumption of r1=3 is wrong.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to choose a different starting ratio r1 such that the terms remain integers and a13=2016.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratios are all integers.
