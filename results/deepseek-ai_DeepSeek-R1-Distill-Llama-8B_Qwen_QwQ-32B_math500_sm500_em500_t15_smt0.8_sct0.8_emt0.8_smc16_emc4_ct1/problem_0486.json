The radius of the sphere is 3 inches, so the volume becomes (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic inches.\n\nNext, I'll figure out the edge length of the cube that was used to create the sphere. When metal is removed from each corner of the cube to form the sphere, each corner is essentially a small octant of the sphere. Therefore, the edge length of the cube is equal to twice the radius of the sphere, which is 2 * 3 = 6 inches.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the volume of the original cube using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is side length cubed. So the volume of the cube is 6³ = 216 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the volume of the original cube.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe have a steel sphere with a **3-inch radius** that's created by removing metal from the **corners** of a cube. The goal is to determine the **volume** of the original cube that had the **shortest possible side lengths**.\n\n### **Step 2: Volume of the Sphere**\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the steel sphere.\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n\\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nGiven \\( r = 3 \\) inches:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times 27 = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Relating the Sphere to the Cube**\n\nWhen metal is removed from each corner of a cube to create a sphere, each corner is essentially a small **octant** of the sphere. Therefore:\n\n- The **edge length** of the cube is equal to the **diameter** of the sphere.\n- The diameter of the sphere is \\( 2 \\times 3 ="
