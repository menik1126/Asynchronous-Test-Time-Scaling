            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of the original cube before any metal is removed. The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying its side length by itself three times. Since the cube has the shortest possible side length to contain the steel sphere, the sphere must fit perfectly inside it.\n\nNext, I'll consider the sphere inscribed within the cube. For a sphere to be perfectly inscribed, the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the side length of the cube. The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so if the radius is 3 inches, the diameter is 6 inches. Therefore, the side length of the cube is 6 inches.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the volume of the cube using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume of cube} = \\text{side length}^3\n\\]\nSubstituting the side length of 6 inches:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Radius of the steel sphere (r)** = 3 inches\n- The sphere is inscribed in a cube, meaning the sphere touches all the faces of the cube.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Side Length of the Cube**\n\nFor a sphere to be perfectly inscribed in a cube, the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the side length of the cube.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Diameter of sphere} = 2 \\times \\text{Radius of sphere} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the **side length (s)** of the cube is:\n\n\\[\ns = 6 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Cube**\n\nThe volume (V) of a cube is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nV = s^3\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( s = 6 \\) inches:\n\n\\[\nV = 6^3 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{216}\n\\]"
