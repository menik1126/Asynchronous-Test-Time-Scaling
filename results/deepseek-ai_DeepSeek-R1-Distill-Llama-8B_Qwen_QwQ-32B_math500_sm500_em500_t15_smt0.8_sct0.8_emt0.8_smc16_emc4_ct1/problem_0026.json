The complex number \\(1 - i\\) can be represented as \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) at a 45-degree angle from the positive real axis.\n\nNext, I'll raise the complex number to the eighth power using De Moivre's theorem. This means raising \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to the eighth power and multiplying the angle by 8.\n\nCalculating \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\) gives me 16. Multiplying the angle by 8 changes the 45-degree angle to 360 degrees, which is a full circle.\n\nFinally, taking the absolute value of the result, since any complex number on the unit circle has an absolute value of 1, the absolute value of \\( (1 - i)^8 \\) is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Number**:\n   The complex number \\( 1 - i \\) can be represented in polar form. Its magnitude is \\( \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\), and its angle (argument) is \\( 45^\\circ \\) or \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians.\n\n2. **Raise to the 8th Power**:\n   Using De Moivre's theorem:\n   \\[\n   (1 - i)^8 = \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\right)^8 \\left[ \\cos\\left( 8 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) + i \\sin\\left( 8 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) \\right]\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16\n   \\]\n   The angle becomes:\n   \\[\n   8 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{4} = 2\\pi\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the Absolute Value**:\n   Since the angle \\( 2\\pi \\) corresponds to a full rotation on the complex plane, the result is:\n   \\[\n   (1 - i)^8 = 16 \\left[ \\"
