            "output": "First, I recognize that the expression involves a complex number in the form of \\(1 - i\\). To find the modulus, I need to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.\n\nSo, I'll start by computing the modulus squared: \\((1)^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2\\). Therefore, the modulus of \\(1 - i\\) is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nNext, I need to raise this modulus to the 8th power. Since \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is approximately \\(1.4142\\), raising it to the 8th power will give the final result.\n\nFinally, calculating \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\) results in \\(4\\). So, the value of \\(|1 - i|^8\\) is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(|1 - i|^8\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Modulus of a Complex Number:**\n   \n   For a complex number \\(a + bi\\), the modulus \\(|a + bi|\\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   |a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the Modulus of \\(1 - i\\):**\n   \n   Here, \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = -1\\). Plugging these into the formula:\n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Raise the Modulus to the 8th Power:**\n   \n   \\[\n   |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   \n   Since \\((\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\\), then \\((\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2)^4 = 16\\).\n   \n5. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   \\[\n   |1 - i|^8 = \\boxed{16}\n   \\]"
