Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with optimization problems under certain constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers or inequalities such as AM-GM might be useful. Since all variables are positive, AM-GM could be a good starting point here.\n\nLet me write down what I need to minimize: \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Expanding this, it becomes \\(y(x + y + z) + xz\\). But looking back at the constraint, it involves \\(xyz(x + y + z)\\). Maybe there's a way to relate these expressions.\n\nWait, the expanded form is \\(y(x + y + z) + xz\\). Let me denote \\(S = x + y + z\\). Then, the expression becomes \\(yS + xz\\). But from the constraint, \\(xyzS = 1\\), so \\(S = \\frac{1}{xyz}\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(S\\) into the expression, we get \\(y \\cdot \\frac{1}{xyz} + xz = \\frac{1}{xz} + xz\\). Oh, interesting! So now, the problem reduces to minimizing \\(\\frac{1}{xz} + xz\\).\n\nThat seems simpler. Let me denote \\(t = xz\\). Since \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) are positive, \\(t\\) is also positive. So, we need to minimize \\(\\frac{1}{t} + t\\). Hmm, this is a classic optimization problem.\n\nI recall that the function \\(f(t) = t + \\frac{1}{t}\\) has its minimum at \\(t = 1\\), and the minimum value is \\(2\\). This is because when \\(t = 1\\), the function \\(f(t)\\) reaches its minimum due to the AM-GM inequality: \\(t + \\frac{1}{t} \\geq 2\\sqrt{t \\cdot \\frac{1}{t}} = 2\\).\n\nSo, does this mean the minimum value of \\(\\frac{1}{xz} + xz\\) is \\(2\\"

Let me make sure if this is applicable.\n\nWe substituted \\(S = \\frac{1}{xyz}\\) into \\((x + y)(y + z) = yS + xz\\), which gave us \\(\\frac{1}{xz} + xz\\). Since \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are all positive, \\(xz\\) is positive, so \\(t = xz > 0\\). Therefore, the function \\(t + 1/t\\) certainly attains its minimum at \\(t = 1\\) with the value \\(2\\).\n\nHowever, we need to check if \\(t = 1\\) is achievable under the given constraints. That is, can we have \\(xz = 1\\) while still satisfying \\(xyzS = 1\\) and \\(S = x + y + z\\)?\n\nLet me consider if \\(xz = 1\\). Then, \\(t = 1\\). Now, \\(S = \\frac{1}{xyz}\\). So, \\(S = \\frac{1}{yz}\\), since \\(x = \\frac{1}{z}\\) (because \\(xz = 1\\) implies \\(x = \\frac{1}{z}\\)).

Here, it's \\(k^2 + 1/k^2\\), which also has its minimum at \\(k^2 = 1\\), i.e., \\(k =1\\).\n\nThus, the minimal \\(m\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, \\(t^2 = 2\\), so \\(t = \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of \\((k + y)^2\\) is \\((\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\\).\n\nSo, this tells us that in Case 1, when \\(x = z =1\\), the function indeed reaches the minimal value of 2, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, both methods\u2014using substitution and applying AM-GM, and using Lagrangian multipliers\u2014lead us to the same conclusion that the minimal value is 2. Hence, the minimal value of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) is 2.\n</think>\n\nThe minimum value of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) under the constraint \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\) is achieved when \\(x = z = 1\\) and \\(y = \\sqrt{2} - 1\\), resulting in the value 2.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
