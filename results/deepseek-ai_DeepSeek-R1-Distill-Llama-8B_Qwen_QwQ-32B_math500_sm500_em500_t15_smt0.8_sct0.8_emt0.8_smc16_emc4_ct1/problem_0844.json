Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably try to understand what the function looks like. The numerator is \\(x - y\\), which is a linear expression, and the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\), which is a combination of quartic terms plus a constant. Since both numerator and denominator are functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I need to find their values that maximize the ratio.\n\nI think a good strategy might be to use calculus, specifically partial derivatives, to find the critical points where the function could reach its maximum. Alternatively, maybe there's a substitution or transformation that can simplify the problem. Let me explore both approaches.\n\nStarting with calculus, let's denote the function as \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). To find its critical points, I need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and set them equal to zero.\n\nLet's compute the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\). Using the quotient rule, which states that \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{u}{v} \\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}\\), where \\(u = x - y\\) and \\(v = x^4 + y^4 + 6\\).\n\nSo, \\(u' = 1\\) because the derivative of \\(x\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is 1, and the derivative of \\(-y\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is 0. Now, \\(v' = 4x^3 + 0 + 0 = 4x^3\\). Therefore, the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1 \\cdot (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y) \\cdot 4x^3}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly"

The maximum value would be the maximum of \\(f(x, y)\\) when \\(x - y\\) is positive.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the function is maximized when \\(y\\) is as small as possible or something like that. But since \\(y\\) can be negative, maybe choosing \\(y\\) to be negative can result in a higher value? Wait, let me think.\n\nSuppose we have \\(x - y\\), so if \\(y\\) is negative, then \\( - y \\) becomes positive, which can increase the numerator. But the denominator also has \\(y^4\\), which is always positive regardless of \\(y\\). So, \\(y^4\\) is minimized when \\(y = 0\\), so perhaps setting \\(y = 0\\) is optimal for maximizing the function, because increasing \\(|y|\\) would only make the denominator bigger without necessarily increasing the numerator enough.\n\nWait, let me test that. Let's suppose \\(y = -k\\), where \\(k > 0\\). Then, the numerator becomes \\(x - (-k) = x + k\\), and the denominator becomes \\(x^4 + (-k)^4 + 6 = x^4 + k^4 + 6\\). So, if I set \\(y\\) to be negative, the numerator becomes \\(x + k\\). If I can choose \\(x\\) to be larger, that might help.\n\nBut how does that balance with the denominator?

To use Lagrange multipliers, maybe I can consider the function \\(f(x, y)\\) and set up the gradient equal to a multiple of the gradient of some constraint? Hmm, but since there's no constraint, maybe Lagrange multipliers aren't directly applicable here. Wait, actually, Lagrange multipliers are for constrained optimization.

Then, \\(x - y\\) could become very large, but the denominator \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\) would also become very large. So, perhaps the function approaches zero as \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are scaled up or down proportionally.\n\nWait, let me see. Suppose we set \\(y = -k x\\), for some positive \\(k\\). Then, the numerator becomes \\(x - (-k x) = x + kx = x(1 + k)\\).\n\nThe denominator becomes \\(x^4 + (-k x)^4 + 6 = x^4 + k^4 x^4 + 6 = x^4(1 + k^4) + 6\\).\n\nSo, the function becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(x, y) = \\frac{x(1 + k)}{x^4(1 + k^4) + 6}\n\\]\n\nNow, as \\(x\\) tends to infinity, the denominator behaves like \\(x^4(1 + k^4)\\), which grows much faster than the numerator, which is only linear in \\(x\\). Therefore, the function tends to zero as \\(x\\) approaches infinity.\n\nSimilarly, if both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are scaled by some factor, let's say \\(x = t a\\), \\(y = t b\\), with \\(t\\) approaching infinity.

Again, the numerator grows linearly while the denominator grows quartic, so the function tends to zero.\n\nSo, it seems that the function doesn't blow up at infinity, but tends to zero. Hence, the maximum must occur somewhere in finite \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Since our critical points only gave us \\(\\frac{\\sqrt[4]{2}}{8}\\), but maybe that's the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can analyze the function in terms of variables substitution.

Let's compute \\(f(2)\\):\n\n\\[\nf(2)= \\frac{8*2}{2^4 +48} = \\frac{16}{16 +48}= \\frac{16}{64}=0.25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the function \\(f(x, y)\\) is 0.25, achieved when \\(b=2\\). Since \\(b = x - y\\), and at this point \\(a\\) is minimized (at \\(a=0\\)), we have \\(x = (a +b)/2 = (0 +2)/2=1\\), \\(y = (a -b)/2=(0 -2)/2=-1\\). Thus, at the point (1, -1), the function attains its maximum value of 0.25.\n\nSo, despite (1, -1) not being a critical point in the multivariable sense (since both partial derivatives aren't zero), the function attains its maximum along this path where \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=2\\). This suggests that the maximum occurs at this edge point where \\(a=0\\), even though it's not a critical point in the interior. Therefore, the maximum value is indeed 0.25.\n\nWait, but the critical point analysis didn't find this point because it's a boundary point in some sense. Therefore, this"
