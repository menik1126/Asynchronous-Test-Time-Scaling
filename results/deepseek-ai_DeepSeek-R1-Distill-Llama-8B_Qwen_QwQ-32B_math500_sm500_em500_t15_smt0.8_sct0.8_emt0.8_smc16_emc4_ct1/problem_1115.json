This means that \\( y \\) is equal to a constant divided by \\( \\sqrt{x} \\).\n\nNext, I need to find the constant of variation. I know that when \\( x = 24 \\), \\( y = 15 \\). I can substitute these values into the equation to solve for the constant.\n\nAfter determining the constant, I can set up the equation for the inverse variation with the known constant. Then, I'll substitute \\( y = 3 \\) into the equation to find the corresponding value of \\( x \\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\( x \\) and confirm that the calculations are correct to ensure the answer is accurate.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow the steps below:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Relationship\nWe are given that \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\). This can be written mathematically as:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}}\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is the constant of variation.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Constant \\( k \\)\nWe are provided with the values \\( x = 24 \\) and \\( y = 15 \\). Substitute these into the equation to solve for \\( k \\):\n\\[\n15 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{24}}\n\\]\n\\[\nk = 15 \\times \\sqrt{24}\n\\]\n\\[\nk = 15 \\times 2\\sqrt{6} = 30\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Express the Inverse Variation with \\( k \\)\nUsing the value of \\( k \\), the equation becomes:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find \\( x \\) When \\( y = 3 \\)\nSubstitute \\( y = 3 \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{x}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x} = \\frac{30\\sqrt{6}}{3} = 10\\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = (10\\sqrt{6})^2 = 100 \\times 6 = 600\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\nx = \\boxed{600}\n\\]"
