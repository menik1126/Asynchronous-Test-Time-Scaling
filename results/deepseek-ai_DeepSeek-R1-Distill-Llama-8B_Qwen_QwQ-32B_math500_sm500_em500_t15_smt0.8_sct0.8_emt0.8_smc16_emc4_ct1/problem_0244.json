            "output": "To convert $\\frac{31}{11111}$ to a decimal, I first need to perform the division of 31 by 11111. \n\nUpon dividing, I find that the decimal begins with 0.002800280028... This indicates that the repeating part of the decimal is \"0028\".\n\nNext, I observe that the repeating block \"0028\" has 4 digits. Therefore, the repeating decimal has 4 digits that repeat indefinitely.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   The denominator is \\(11111\\). Notice that \\(11111\\) is a repunit number, meaning it consists entirely of 1's. Specifically, \\(11111 = 10^4 + 10^3 + 10^2 + 10^1 + 10^0 = 11111\\).\n\n2. **Perform the Division:**\n   Divide the numerator (31) by the denominator (11111):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111} \\approx 0.002800280028\\ldots\n   \\]\n   This decimal expansion repeats every 4 digits after the decimal point.\n\n3. **Identify the Repeating Block:**\n   The repeating part of the decimal is \"0028\". This consists of 4 digits.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The repeating decimal \\(0.\\overline{0028}\\) has 4 digits that repeat indefinitely.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"

How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\nFor example, if you get the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{123},$ then your answer should be $3,$ and if you get $0.436\\overline{7},$ your answer should be $1.$"
