            "output": "To determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of 31/11111, I first need to understand the nature of the denominator. The number 11111 is composed entirely of 1s, which suggests it might have a repeating pattern when performing long division.\n\nNext, I'll analyze the fraction 31 divided by 11111. Since 31 is less than 11111, the decimal will be less than 1. To convert the fraction to a decimal, I can use the method of long division.\n\nDuring the long division process, I'll continue dividing until the remainder repeats, indicating the start of a repeating cycle. Each time I encounter the same remainder, the subsequent digits will also repeat, establishing the length of the repeating sequence.\n\nAfter performing the long division step-by-step, I find that the decimal expansion of 31/11111 is 0.002800028... This shows that the digit 0 repeats indefinitely after the initial decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the repeating digit in the decimal expansion is 0, and it repeats every 5 digits: 002800002800...\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Denominator\nThe denominator is \\(11,111\\). This number consists entirely of the digit 1. Such numbers can often lead to repeating decimals because they are related to powers of 10.\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Long Division\nLet's divide \\(31\\) by \\(11,111\\):\n\n\\[\n31 \\div 11,111 = 0.002800028\\ldots\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Repeating Pattern\nObserving the division:\n- The decimal starts as \\(0.002800028\\ldots\\)\n- The digits \\(028\\) repeat indefinitely.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Length of the Repeating Sequence\nThe repeating sequence is \"028\". Counting the digits:\n\\[\n\\text{Sequence length} = 3\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe repeating digit in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is the digit 0, and it repeats every 5 digits: \\(002800002800\\ldots\\).\n\nHowever, based on the repeating sequence observed (\\(028\\)), the number of repeating digits is **3**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"

How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\nFor example, if you get the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{123},$ then your answer should be $3,$ and if you get $0.436\\overline{7},$ your answer should be $1.$"
