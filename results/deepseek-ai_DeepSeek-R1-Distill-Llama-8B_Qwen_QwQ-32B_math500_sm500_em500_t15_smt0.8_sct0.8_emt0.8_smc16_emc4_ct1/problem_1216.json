Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with congruences modulo 7, I can substitute \\( n \\) with its equivalent value in the modulus system. Since \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), that means \\( n = 7k + 2 \\) for some integer \\( k \\). But maybe I don't need to use that right away. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLooking at the expression \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\), I notice that each term is 2, 4, and 6 more than \\( n \\). Since \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), maybe I can substitute \\( n \\) with 2 in each term and then compute the product modulo 7.\n\nLet me test that idea. If \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), then:\n\n- \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 = 8 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nWait, 8 modulo 7 is 1, right? Because 7 goes into 8 once with a remainder of 1. So:\n\n- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nSo now, the product \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) modulo 7 is the same as \\( 4 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\nCalculating that: 4 times 6 is 24, and 24 times 1 is 24. Now, what's 24 modulo 7? Let's divide 24 by 7.\n\n7 times 3 is 21, which leaves a remainder of 3. So 24 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 3"

That means when you divide that product by 7, the remainder is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check my substitutions to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\):\n\n- \\( n + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \\). Correct.\n- \\( n + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 \\). Correct.\n- \\( n + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 \\). 8 mod 7 is 1. Correct.\n\nSo 4, 6, and 1 multiplied together. 4*6 is 24, 24*1 is 24. 24 mod 7: 7*3=21, 24-21=3. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. I remember that in modular arithmetic, I can reduce each factor modulo 7 first before multiplying. So, let me try that method.\n\nStarting with \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\). Since \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), substitute each term:\n\n- \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes \\( 4 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\pmod{7} \\), which is 24 mod 7. As before, that's 3. So, same result.\n\nAnother way to think about it: maybe using properties of exponents or something else? Hmm, not really necessary here since we already have a straightforward substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expand the product \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) and then substitute \\( n \\equiv 2 \\). Let me try that expansion.\n\nFirst, multiply"

Since n=2, n^2=4, so 5*4=20. 20 mod 7 is 20-2*7=6. So, 12n^2 mod7=6.\n\nThen 44n mod7: 44 mod7 is 2 (since 7*6=42, 44-42=2). So, 2n. n=2, so 2*2=4. 4 mod7=4.\n\n48 mod7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6.

Maybe another angle: considering the general expression \\( (n + a)(n + b)(n + c) \\) mod m.
