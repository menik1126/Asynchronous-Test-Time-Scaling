            "output": "I start by evaluating the innermost radical, which is the cube root of 1/729. I know that 729 is equal to 9 cubed, so the cube root of 1/729 is 1/9.\n\nNext, I take the square root of 1/9. The square root of 1 is 1 and the square root of 9 is 3, so the square root of 1/9 is 1/3.\n\nFinally, I take the cube root of 1/3. Since the cube root and the square root are combined, I can express this as a single radical. Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is the cube root of 1/3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\\) and write the result with a rational denominator, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Evaluate the innermost radical:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{729}}\n   \\]\n   - Recognize that \\(729 = 9^3\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{9}\\).\n\n2. **Take the square root of the result:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9}}\n   \\]\n   - The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 9 is 3.\n   - So, \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n3. **Take the cube root of the final result:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{3}}\n   \\]\n   - Expressing it as a single radical:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{3}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final simplified form with a rational denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{3}}}\n   \\]"
