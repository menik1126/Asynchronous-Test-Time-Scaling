            "output": "First, I need to determine the original cube's side length. The sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is 6 inches. Since the sphere is inscribed within the cube, the cube's side length is equal to the sphere's diameter. Therefore, the cube has a side length of 6 inches.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the cube. The volume of a cube is given by the formula side length cubed. So, I'll multiply 6 inches by itself three times: 6 × 6 × 6, which equals 216 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube with the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube:**\n   \n   - The sphere is inscribed inside the cube. This means the sphere touches the cube exactly at the centers of each face of the cube.\n   - The diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\n2. **Calculate the Diameter of the Sphere:**\n   \n   - **Given:** Radius of the sphere (\\( r \\)) = 3 inches\n   - **Diameter of the sphere** = \\( 2 \\times r = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) inches\n\n3. **Determine the Side Length of the Cube:**\n   \n   - Since the sphere is inscribed, the diameter of the sphere equals the side length of the cube.\n   - **Side length of the cube (\\( s \\))** = 6 inches\n\n4. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**\n   \n   - The formula for the volume of a cube is:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the side length:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cube}} = 6^3 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{216}\n\\]"
