I need to find the volume of the original cube in cubic inches.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I know that the sphere is made by cutting off the corners of a cube. That makes me think of a process called truncation, where you cut off the vertices of a polyhedron. In this case, the cube is a polyhedron with eight vertices, all of which are being cut off to form the sphere.\n\nWait, if the sphere is formed by these truncations, the sphere must fit perfectly within the cube. So, the radius of the sphere is related to the size of the cube. I need to figure out how the radius of the sphere affects the side length of the cube.\n\nLet me visualize this. When you cut off a corner of a cube, you're essentially removing a small octahedral part from each corner. Each corner that's removed is a pyramid with a square base, right? So, each of these pyramids has a base that's a smaller square and four triangular faces.\n\nNow, the sphere has a radius of 3 inches. Since the sphere is formed by the combined surface of all these truncated corners, the radius of the sphere must relate to how far each cut is made from the original corners.\n\nLet me think about the geometry here. If I imagine a cube and then cutting off each corner such that the new faces of the cube (where the corners were removed) form part of the sphere's surface, those new faces must be parts of the sphere's surface.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you cut off the corners, you create a new face on the cube where each corner was removed. Each of these new faces is a triangle because the corner is a right angle, and cutting it off at a certain depth creates a triangular face.\n\nBut how does that relate to the sphere? Hmm, maybe I should think about the sphere being tangent to those new faces. Since the sphere is formed by these cuts, the radius of the sphere would be the distance from the center of the cube to the center of each of these new faces.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me formalize that. The cube has its center at the same point as the sphere's center because the sphere is symmetric within the cube. If"

But the sphere's radius is the distance from the center to the farthest point on the sphere's surface. Since the sphere is entirely within the cube, the sphere's radius must be equal to the distance from the center to the original cube's face minus the amount we've cut off from the corner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere touches the cube's edges or vertices? Wait, no, because we're removing the corners. The sphere must be inscribed in some way within the cube after truncation. Hmm, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that it touches the centers of the cube's faces. But in that case, the sphere's diameter would equal the cube's edge length, so the radius would be half the edge length. But in this problem, the sphere is made by removing the corners, so maybe the sphere touches the edges of the cube?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that the sphere touches the midpoints of the cube's edges. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is the inscribed sphere of the cube after truncation. Wait, but truncation changes the shape. Maybe the sphere is the inscribed sphere of the cube before truncation? But that can't be because the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's denote the side length of the cube as 's'. The sphere is entirely inside the cube, and the radius of the sphere is 3 inches. The sphere must be tangent to the original cube's faces? Or maybe to the edges?\n\nWait, if we remove the corners, the sphere's surface would be where the cuts are made. So the sphere's surface is exactly at the points where the metal was removed. Therefore, the sphere must be tangent to the edges of the cube. Let me see.\n\nImagine a cube with side length 's'. The corners are at coordinates (0,0,0), (s,0,0), etc. If we cut off each corner, the truncation plane would be at some distance from each corner. The sphere's surface would be exactly at those truncation planes. The sphere's center is at the center of the cube, which is (s/"

When we cut off a corner, the truncation plane intersects the edges of the cube. The distance from the center of the cube to this plane is equal to the sphere's radius, 3 inches.\n\nLet me think about one edge, say from (0,0,0) to (s,0,0). The truncation plane near this corner would intersect this edge at some point (a, 0, 0). Similarly, the same plane would intersect the other edges from (0,0,0), so the truncation plane would form a triangle in the corner.\n\nThe distance from the center of the cube to this truncation plane would be the sphere's radius, which is 3 inches.\n\nTo find the distance from the center (s/2, s/2, s/2) to the plane, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane.\n\nFirst, we need to find the equation of the truncation plane.\n\nLet me consider the corner at (0,0,0). The truncation plane would cut the three edges emanating from this corner at points (a,0,0), (0,a,0), and (0,0,a), where 'a' is the distance from the corner along each edge where the truncation occurs.\n\nSo, the plane equation can be determined using these three points. Let me find the equation of the plane passing through these three points: (a,0,0), (0,a,0), and (0,0,a).\n\nUsing the general equation of a plane: Ax + By + Cz = D.

After truncation, each original edge of the cube is now a new edge of the cube, shorter in length. The sphere is tangent to these new edges.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is also tangent to the original cube's edges. Alternatively, maybe the sphere's radius relates to the length of the edges after truncation.\n\nWait, maybe when you cut off a corner, the sphere touches the new edge created by the truncation. So, let me think about the midpoint of the original cube's edge. After truncation, the point where the truncation plane meets the original edge is at (a, 0, 0). This point is on the sphere's surface as well.\n\nTherefore, the distance from the center of the cube to this point (a, 0, 0) must be equal to the sphere's radius, which is 3 inches.\n\nWait, is that the case? Because if the sphere is made by the truncation, the points where the metal is removed (the corners) would lie on the sphere.

The furthest point on the truncated cube would be somewhere else.\n\nIf the original corner is removed, the furthest points from the center would be along the edges or faces.\n\nWait, if the corner is cut off such that the distance from the center to the cut point is exactly 3, then the original corner was farther away, and the cut point is on the sphere.\n\nThus, the maximum distance any point on the truncated cube can be from the center is exactly 3, the sphere's radius.\n\nTherefore, the original corner was at distance s/2*sqrt(3), which is larger than 3, then we cut it down so that the new face's vertices are at distance 3 from the center.\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center in the truncated cube is 3. The minimal cube would be the cube which required cutting just enough so that the furthest points are exactly 3.\n\n Thus, the original point (before cutting) would have been further away, so we need to make sure that the cut is such that the new edge points (where the truncation happened) are exactly 3 units from center.\n\n Therefore, the cut occurs at a distance of 3 from the center.\n\nSo for each original corner, we have a new face whose vertices are exactly at a distance of 3 from the center.\n\nLet's consider one of the new vertices introduced by truncating the corner at (s/2, s/2, s/2). The truncation replaces the corner with a new triangular face. Each vertex of this face is located along an edge of the original cube. For"

The equation of this plane can be found as before, x + y + z = s, but wait, no. Earlier, we had x + y + z = a, but that was when a was related to s. Now, the plane equation would be x + y + z = t, where t is the sum of the truncation lengths along each coordinate. Wait, perhaps for the corner at (s/2, s/2, s/2), the plane equation is x + y + z = t, where t is the sum of the distances from the corner along each axis. But the truncation removes a pyramid whose base is a right triangle, so the plane equation is x + y + z = t.\n\nBut the distance from the center to this plane must be equal to the sphere's radius, which is 3.\n\nSo, the distance from (0,0,0) to the plane x + y + z = t is |t| / sqrt(3) = 3.\n\nThus,\n\nt"

Therefore, the plane must pass through the points where it cuts the edges emanating from that corner.

Wait, actually if the cube is centered at the origin with edge length s, then each edge runs from -s/2 to s/2. Therefore, the edge length is s.\n\nWait, sorry, perhaps I should redefine everything with the cube edge length s, with vertices at (0,s,s), but maybe this is complicating.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume the cube is from 0 to s along all axes, so the corner is at (s,s,s).
