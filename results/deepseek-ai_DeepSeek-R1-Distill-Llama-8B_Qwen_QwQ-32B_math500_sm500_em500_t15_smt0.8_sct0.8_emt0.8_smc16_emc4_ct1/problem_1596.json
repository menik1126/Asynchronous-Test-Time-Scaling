Maybe I can simplify it somehow or factor it.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n\nHmm, I notice that 2x - 10 can be factored. Let me see: 2x - 10 is equal to 2(x - 5). So, the right side is [2(x - 5)]^3.\n\nSo, maybe I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = [2(x - 5)]^3\n\nHmm, that might be helpful later. Now, I wonder if there's a way to expand both sides and then bring everything to one side to see if I can factor it. Let's try expanding each term.\n\nFirst, expand (x - 3)^3. I remember the formula (a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3. So:\n\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\n\nSimilarly, expand (x - 7)^3:\n\n(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\n\nNow, add these two together:\n\n(x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343) =\n\nLet me combine like terms:\n\nx^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\n\n-9x^2 -21x^2 = -30x^2\n\n27x + 147x = 174x\n\n-27 - 343 = -370\n\nSo, the left side simplifies to 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370.\n\nNow, the right side is [2(x - 5)]^3. Let's expand that:\n\n[2(x - 5)]"

Maybe I can factor out a common term first. Let's see if all coefficients are divisible by 6.\n\n-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630\n\nDividing each term by -6:\n\nx^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\n\nNow, I can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (105) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1). So, possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.\n\nLet me test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation.\n\nFirst, try x = 1:\n\n1 - 15 + 71 - 105 = 1 -15= -14; -14 +71=57; 57 -105= -48 ≠ 0.\n\nx="

Now, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root x=3:\n\nCoefficients: 1, -15, 71, -105\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 3: 3. Add to next coefficient: -15 +3= -12.\n\nMultiply -12 by 3: -36. Add to 71: 71 -36=35.\n\nMultiply 35 by 3: 105. Add to -105: 0. Perfect.\n\nSo, after division, the quadratic is x^2 -12x +35.\n\nNow, factor x^2 -12x +35.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add up to -12.\n\n35 factors as 5 and 7. 5 +7=12, so to get -12, both numbers are negative.\n\nThus, x^2 -12x +35 = (x -5)(x -7)\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x -3)(x -5)(x -7) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=3, x=5, x=7.\n\nLet me double-check by plugging them back into the original equation.\n\nFirst, x=3:\n\nLeft side: (3-3)^3 + (3 -7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = -64.\n\nRight side: 2*3 -10=6-10=-4; (-4)^3= -64.\n\nSo, both sides are equal. Good.\n\nNext, x=5:\n\nLeft side: (5-3)^3 + (5 -7)^3= 2^3 + (-2)^3=8 -8=0.\n\nRight side: 2*5 -10=10 -10=0; 0^3=0. So, both sides are 0. Correct.\n\nNow, x=7:\n\nLeft side: (7-3)^3 + (7 -7)^3=4^3 +0=64 +0=64.\n\n"
