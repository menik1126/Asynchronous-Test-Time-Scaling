Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the terms are cubic expressions, which probably means there might be a way to simplify this equation. Maybe I can expand all of them and then combine like terms. Let me recall the formula for expanding a cube: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). I can apply this to each term.\n\nStarting with \\((x - 3)^3\\):\n- Let \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = -3\\).\n- So, \\((x - 3)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2(-3) + 3x(-3)^2 + (-3)^3\\).\n- Calculating each term:\n  - \\(x^3\\) is just \\(x^3\\).\n  - \\(3x^2(-3) = -9x^2\\).\n  - \\(3x(-3)^2 = 3x(9) = 27x\\).\n  - \\((-3)^3 = -27\\).\n- So, putting it together: \\(x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\\).\n\nNext, expanding \\((x - 7)^3\\):\n- Let \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = -7\\).\n- So, \\((x - 7)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2(-7) + 3x(-7)^2 + (-7)^3\\).\n- Calculating each term:\n  - \\(x^3\\) remains \\(x^3\\).\n  - \\(3x^2(-7) = -21x^2\\).\n  - \\(3x(-7)^2 = 3x(49) = 147x\\).\n  - \\((-7)^3 = -343\\).\n- So, combining them: \\(x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\\).\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the sum of these two expanded terms:\n\\[\n(x^3 - 9x"

            "output": "^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)\n\\]\nLet me combine like terms:\n- \\(x^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\\).\n- \\(-9x^2 - 21x^2 = -30x^2\\).\n- \\(27x + 147x = 174x\\).\n- \\(-27 - 343 = -370\\).\nSo, the left side simplifies to \\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370\\).\n\nNow, let's look at the right side: \\((2x - 10)^3\\). I'll expand this using the same formula:\n- Let \\(a = 2x\\) and \\(b = -10\\).\n- So, \\((2x - 10)^3 = (2x)^3 + 3(2x)^2(-10) + 3(2x)(-10)^2 + (-10)^3\\).\n- Calculating each term:\n  - \\((2x)^3 = 8x^3\\).\n  - \\(3(2x)^2(-10) = 3(4x^2)(-10) = -120x^2\\).\n  - \\(3(2x)(-10)^2 = 3(2x)(100) = 600x\\).\n  - \\((-10)^3 = -1000\\).\n- Combining these gives: \\(8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\\).\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\\[\n2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\n\\]\nI should bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Let me subtract the left side from both sides:\n\\[\n0 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000 - (2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370)\n\\]\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n- \\(8x^3 - 2x^3 = 6x^3\\)\n- \\(-120x^2 + 30x"

Solving cubic equations can be a bit tricky. Maybe I can factor out a common factor first. Let's see if all the coefficients are divisible by 6:\n- 6 ÷ 6 = 1\n- 90 ÷ 6 = 15\n- 426 ÷ 6 = 71\n- 630 ÷ 6 = 105\nSo, factoring out 6:\n\\[\n6(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105) = 0\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nx^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\n\\]\nNow, I need to solve the cubic equation \\(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\\). I can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -105, and the leading coefficient is 1. So possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.\n\nLet me test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation.\n\nStarting with x=1:\n\\(1 - 15 + 71 - 105 = 1 -15= -14 +71=57 -105= -48 ≠0\\)\n\nx=3:\n\\(27 - 135 + 213 - 105\\)\n27-135= -108 +213=105 -105=0. Oh, x=3 is a root!\n\nSo, (x - 3) is a factor. I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor this out.\n\nUsing synthetic division with x=3:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x³), -15 (x²), 71 (x), -105 (constant)\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 3: 3, add to next coefficient"

Perfect.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x - 3)(x² - 12x + 35)=0.\n\nNow, factor the quadratic: x² -12x +35.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add up to -12. Those are -5 and -7.\n\nSo, it factors to (x - 5)(x - 7)=0.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=3, x=5, x=7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these solutions in the original equation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes during expansion or simplification.\n\nChecking x=3:\nLeft side: (3-3)^3 + (3-7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = -64\nRight side: (2*3 -10)^3 = (6-10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64\nSo,  -64 = -64, which works.\n\nChecking x=5:\nLeft side: (5-3)^3 + (5-7)^3 = (2)^3 + (-2)^3 =8 + (-8)=0\nRight side: (2*5 -10)^3=(10-10)^3=0^3=0\nSo, 0=0, which works.\n\nChecking x=7:\nLeft side: (7-3)^3 + (7-7)^3=(4)^3 +0=64 +0=64\nRight side: (2*7 -10)^3=(14-10)^3=4^3=64\nSo, 64=64, which works.\n\nHmm, all three roots check out. So, the solutions are x=3, x=5, and x=7.\n\nI think that's all. So, the roots are 3,5,7.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\) can be simplified and solved by expanding both sides and combining like terms. After simplifying, the equation reduces to \\(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - "
