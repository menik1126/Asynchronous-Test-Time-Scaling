Since \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\\), the equation becomes \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This gives me \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\), which simplifies to \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nNow, I'll express 9 as a power of 3. Since \\(3^2 = 9\\), the equation is now \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nFinally, I'll set the exponents equal to each other because the bases are the same. So, \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Set the exponents equal to each other since the bases are the same:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
