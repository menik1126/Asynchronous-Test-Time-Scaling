            "output": "To solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\), I'll start by simplifying \\(2^3\\).\n\n2 raised to the power of 3 is 8. So, the equation becomes \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This gives \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\), which simplifies to \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nNow, I recognize that 9 is the same as \\(3^2\\). Therefore, the equation becomes \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. This results in \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify \\( 2^3 \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute back into the equation:**\n   \n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate \\( 3^x \\):**\n   \n   Divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n   \n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n   So,\n   \n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \n   Since the bases are the same (\\( 3 \\)), the exponents must be equal:\n   \n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
