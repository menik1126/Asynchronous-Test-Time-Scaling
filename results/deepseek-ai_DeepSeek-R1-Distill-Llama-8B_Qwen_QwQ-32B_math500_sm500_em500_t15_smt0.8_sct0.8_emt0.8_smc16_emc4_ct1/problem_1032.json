Then, I have to compute the sum of the evaluations of these polynomials at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nLet me start by understanding the problem step by step. The given polynomial is an eighth-degree polynomial, and we're supposed to factor it into irreducible monic polynomials. Once factored, we need to plug in \\( x = 1 \\) into each polynomial and sum the results.\n\nFirst, I should try to factor the given polynomial. The polynomial is \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Hmm, this looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Let me make a substitution to simplify it. Let \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\).\n\nLet me try to factor this quadratic equation. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Let's see: 4 and -1? Yes, because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) = 0 \\). Substituting back, \\( x^4 + 4 = 0 \\) and \\( x^4 - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nWait a second, so \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) can be written as \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). But now, each of these factors is a quartic polynomial. I need to check if they can be factored further into polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\). I remember that this is a difference of squares because \\( x^4 = (x^2)^2 \\) and 1 is \\( 1^2 \\). So, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Now, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) can be factored further into \\( (x -"

Both \\( x - 1 \\) and \\( x + 1 \\) are linear polynomials and can't be factored further, so that takes care of \\( x^4 - 1 \\).\n\nNow, moving to \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Hmm, this seems trickier. Let me think if \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored further. I recall that there is a formula for factoring \\( x^4 + a^4 \\), which is \\( (x^2 + ax + a^2)(x^2 - ax + a^2) \\). Let me try that with \\( a = 2 \\) because \\( 4 = 2^4 \\).

Let me multiply it properly:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\)\n\nMultiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:\n\n\\( x^2*x^2 = x^4 \\)\n\n\\( x^2*(-2x) = -2x^3 \\)\n\n\\( x^2*2 = 2x^2 \\)\n\n\\( 2x*x^2 = 2x^3 \\)\n\n\\( 2x*(-2x) = -4x^2 \\)\n\n\\( 2x*2 = 4x \\)\n\n\\( 2*x^2 = 2x^2 \\)\n\n\\( "

Perfect! So, the factorization is correct. So, \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nNow, let me check if these quadratic polynomials can be factored further. Let's look at \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\). The discriminant is \\( (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\), which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals, let alone integers. Similarly, \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) has discriminant \\( (-2)^2 - 8 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\), also negative. So both quadratics are irreducible over the integers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x - 1)(x + 1) \\).\n\nWait, but wait\u2014hold on a second. The problem states that the polynomial is factored into monic polynomials with integer coefficients and each can't be factored further over the integers. So, the factors I have here are:\n\n1. \\( x - 1 \\) (linear, monic, irreducible)\n2. \\( x + 1 \\) (same)\n3. \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\) (quadratic, monic, irreducible)\n4. \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) (same)\n\nSo that's four polynomials in total."
