Then, once I have these factors, I need to compute the sum of their values at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nFirst, let me write down the polynomial clearly: \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Hmm, it looks like an eighth-degree polynomial. Since it's of even degree, maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me try substituting \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). That seems easier to handle because it's a quadratic in y.\n\nNow, I need to factor \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). To factor a quadratic, I look for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Let me think: 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back, that gives \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nWait, \\( x^4 - 1 \\) is a difference of squares, so it factors further. \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\). Then, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) is again a difference of squares: \\( (x + 1)(x - 1) \\). So putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as \\( (x^4 + 4)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nBut hold on, is \\( x^4 + 4 \\) factorable over the integers? Let me check. \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is a sum of squares, which usually doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over integers? There's something called the Sophie Germain identity which factors \\( a^4 + 4b^4 \\) as \\( (a^"

In this case, \\( a = x \\) and \\( b = 1 \\), so \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nSo, now, substituting back into the factorization, the entire polynomial becomes:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\).\n\nSo, these are all the factors. Let me list them out:\n\n1. \\( x + 1 \\)\n2. \\( x - 1 \\)\n3. \\( x^2 + 1 \\)\n4. \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\)\n5. \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\)\n\nEach of these is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. Are they irreducible? Let's check each one.\n\n- For \\( x + 1 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\), these are linear and hence irreducible.\n- For \\( x^2 + 1 \\), discriminant is \\( 0^2 - 4*1*1 = -4 \\), which is negative, so it's irreducible over reals, hence over integers.\n- For \\( x^2 + 2x + 2 \\), discriminant \\( (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\), again negative, so irreducible.\n- Similarly, \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) has discriminant \\( (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4 \\), so also irreducible.\n\nGreat, so that's the complete factorization into irreducibles over the integers.\n\nNow, I need to compute the sum \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) \\). Let's compute each \\( p_i(1) \\):\n\n1. \\( p_1(x) = x + 1 \\implies p_1(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\)\n2."
