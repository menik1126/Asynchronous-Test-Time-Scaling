The sums of these numbers, their squares, and their cubes are given as 96, 144, and 216 respectively. I need to find the sum of all possible values of n.\n\nHmm, let me write down what I know:\n\n1. Sum of a_i from i=1 to n is 96. So,\n   \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96\\]\n\n2. Sum of a_i squared is 144:\n   \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144\\]\n\n3. Sum of a_i cubed is 216:\n   \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216\\]\n\nI need to find all possible values of n and sum them up.\n\nFirst, I remember that for sequences like this, there are some inequalities that relate the sums of powers. Maybe I can use Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder's inequality? Let me think.\n\nWait, Cauchy-Schwarz relates the sum of products to the product of sums, but I need something that links the sums of a_i, a_i², and a_i³. Maybe I can consider the case where all a_i are equal? Because in that case, I can compute n easily.\n\nIf all a_i are equal, then each a_i = S/n, where S is the total sum. So, S = 96, so each a_i = 96/n.\n\nLet me check if this holds for the sum of squares and cubes.\n\nSum of squares would be n*(96/n)² = 96²/n.\n\nGiven that the sum of squares is 144, so:\n\n96² / n = 144\n\nCalculate 96²: 96*96 is 9216.\n\nSo, 9216/n = 144 => n = 9216 / 144.\n\nCalculate that: 9216 / 144. Let's see, 144*64=9216, so n=64.\n\nNow check the sum of cubes: If each a_i is 96/64=1.5, then sum of cubes is n*(1.5)^3 = 64*(3.375)= 64*3.375.\n\nCalculate 64*3 ="

But the problem says \"all possible values of n,\" so maybe there are other n where the sums can still be 96, 144, 216. Wait, is n fixed? Or can n vary?\n\nWait, n is the number of terms in the sequence, so n must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. But given that all a_i are positive real numbers, n can be any positive integer. But in our case, when the numbers are equal, n=64. So perhaps n=64 is the only possible value?\n\nBut let me check. Maybe there are other values of n where the given sums hold. Or is n uniquely determined?\n\nI need to check if n must be 64, or if other n are possible.\n\nLet me recall that for the sums given, n might be uniquely determined.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let me consider the relationship between the sums of a_i, a_i², and a_i³.\n\nI know that for positive real numbers, the sum of cubes can be related to the sum of numbers and sum of their squares. Maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality.\n\nWait, another idea: Let's use the Power Mean Inequality.\n\nThe Power Mean Inequality says that for positive real numbers,\n\n\\[(\\frac{a_1^k + a_2^k + ... + a_n^k}{n})^{1/k} \\geq (\\frac{a_1^m + a_2^m + ... + a_n^m}{n})^{1/m}\\]\n\nfor k>m.\n\nSo, in our case, let's take k=3 and m=2.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[(\\frac{S_3}{n})^{1/3} \\geq (\\frac{S_2}{n})^{1/2}\\]\n\nGiven S_1=96, S_2=144, S_3=216.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\[(\\frac{216}{n})^{1/3} \\geq (\\frac{144}{n})^{1/2}\\]\n\nLet me compute both sides:\n\nLeft side: (216/n"

So maybe multiple n are possible.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the power mean, I see that n must be at least 64.\n\nBut let me think about the equality condition in Power Mean.\n\nThe equality holds iff all a_i are equal. So if n >64, then the inequality must be strict, meaning that (S_3/n)^{1/3} > (S_2/n)^{1/2}, right?\n\nBut in our case, for n=64, we have equality because all a_i equal. For n>64, can we still have equality? No, because only when all a_i equal, equality holds. So for n>64, it can't be equality. So for n>64, the inequality is strict, but in our problem, the equality is achieved when all a_i are equal, so n must be 64.\n\nWait, but can we have n larger than "

Let me try to see if there exists a sequence of 65 positive real numbers with sum 96, sum of squares 144, and sum of cubes 216.\n\nHmm, maybe if I take 64 terms as 1.5 each (since 1.5*64=96, but then sum of squares would be 64*(1.5)^2=64*2.25=144, which is exactly the given sum. But then the sum of cubes would be 64*(3.375)=216, which is also given. So if I have 64 terms of 1.5 and one more term of 0, but the problem states that all a_i are positive real numbers. So 0 is not allowed. So that won't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can have 64 terms of 1.5 and one term of ε, where ε is a very small positive number. Then the total sum would be 96 + ε. To keep the total sum at 96, I need to subtract ε from one of the 1.5 terms. So, for example, 63 terms of 1.5, one term of 1.5 - ε, and one term of ε. Then the total sum remains 96. But then the sum of squares would be 63*(1.5)^2 + (1.5 - ε)^2 + ε^2. Let's compute that:\n\nOriginal sum of squares with 64 terms: 144. If we replace one term of 1.5 with (1.5 - ε) and add ε, the new sum is 144 - (1.5)^2 + (1.5 - ε)^2 + ε^2.\n\nCompute the difference:\n\n(1.5 - ε)^2 + ε^2 - (1.5)^2 = (2.25 - 3ε + ε²) + ε² - 2.25 = -3ε + 2ε².\n\nSo the new sum of squares is 144 -3ε + 2ε².

So no solution here.\n\nSimilarly, for the sum of cubes, let's see: original sum is 216. Replacing one term of 1.5 with (1.5 - ε) and adding ε, the new sum is 216 - (1.5)^3 + (1.5 - ε)^3 + ε^3.\n\nCompute the difference:\n\n(1.5 - ε)^3 + ε^3 - (1.5)^3 = [3.375 - 3*(1.5)^2 ε + 3*(1.5) ε² - ε³] + ε³ - 3.375\n\nSimplify:\n\n3.375 - 6.75ε + 4.5ε² - ε³ + ε³ -3.375 = -6.75ε + 4.5ε²\n\nSet this equal to zero for the sum of cubes to stay at 216: -6.75ε + 4.5ε²=0.\n\nFactor: ε(-6.75 + 4.5ε)=0.\n\nSolutions: ε=0 or ε=6.75/4.5=1.5.\n\nBut again, ε=1.5 replaces 1.5 with 0, which isn't allowed since numbers must be positive. So no solution.\n\nThus, when n=65, there is no such sequence because adding or subtracting a small ε from one term affects both sum of squares and sum of cubes, and we can't keep both sums the same. So for n=65, it's impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for any n>64, if we try to construct such a sequence, we might run into the same problem. Because in the case of n=64, we have equality, but for n>64, we have to have at least one term different, but that would require another term to compensate, but it seems it would mess up both the sum of squares and cubes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n=64 is the only possible value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple n where such a sequence exists.
