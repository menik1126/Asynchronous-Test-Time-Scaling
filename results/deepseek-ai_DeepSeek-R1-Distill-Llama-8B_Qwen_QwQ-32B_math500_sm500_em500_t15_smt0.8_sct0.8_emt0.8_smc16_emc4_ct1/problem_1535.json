They give me three sums: the sum of the numbers, the sum of their squares, and the sum of their cubes. I need to find the sum of all possible values of n. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down what's given:\n\n1. Sum of a_i from i=1 to n: \u03a3a_i = 96\n2. Sum of a_i squared: \u03a3a_i\u00b2 = 144\n3. Sum of a_i cubed: \u03a3a_i\u00b3 = 216\n\nAnd I need to find the possible values of n and sum them up. Hmm.\n\nI remember that for such problems, especially when dealing with sums of powers, sometimes it's useful to think about moments or maybe use inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or H\u00f6lder's inequality. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me think about what these sums could imply. If all a_i were equal, then each a_i would be 96/n. Let me calculate what that would mean for the other sums.\n\nSo, if each a_i is the same, then:\n\nSum of squares would be n*(96/n)\u00b2 = 96\u00b2/n. Similarly, sum of cubes would be n*(96/n)\u00b3 = 96\u00b3/n\u00b2.\n\nGiven that in our case, \u03a3a_i\u00b2 = 144 and \u03a3a_i\u00b3 = 216, let's see if these can hold when the a_i are equal.\n\nSo, if they are equal:\n\n\u03a3a_i\u00b2 = 144 \u21d2 96\u00b2/n = 144 \u21d2 n = 96\u00b2 / 144. Let me calculate that: 96\u00b2 is 9216, and 9216 / 144 = 64. So n would be 64.\n\nSimilarly, \u03a3a_i\u00b3 = 216 \u21d2 96\u00b3 / n\u00b2 = 216. Plugging in n=64:\n\n96\u00b3 / (64\u00b2) = (96/64)\u00b3 * 96 = (3/2)\u00b3 * 96 = (27/8)*96 = 27*12 = 324. But 324 \u2260 216. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nSo if all a_i are equal, we get a contradiction because the sum of"

Let me think about variance or something. The sum of squares is 144, sum of a_i is 96, so maybe the variance can tell us something.\n\nVariance \u03c3\u00b2 = (\u03a3a_i\u00b2 - (\u03a3a_i)\u00b2 / n). Wait, no, actually the variance is calculated as (\u03a3a_i\u00b2 / n) - (\u03a3a_i / n)\u00b2. Let me compute that.\n\n\u03a3a_i\u00b2 / n = 144 / n\n\n(\u03a3a_i / n)\u00b2 = (96 / n)\u00b2\n\nSo variance \u03c3\u00b2 = 144/n - (96/n)\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, for the third moment, maybe skewness or something can be used, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that (\u03a3a_i\u00b2)(\u03a31\u00b2) \u2265 (\u03a3a_i)\u00b2. Since all a_i are positive.\n\nWait, in our case:\n\n(144)(n) \u2265 (96)\u00b2 \u21d2 144n \u2265 9216 \u21d2 n \u2265 9216 / 144 = 64. So n is at least 64.\n\nHmm, interesting. So n must be at least 64. So possible values are n \u226564? But let's check with H\u00f6lder's inequality.\n\nH\u00f6lder's inequality relates the sums of different powers. For three sequences, the sum of a_i * b_i * c_i \u2264 (\u03a3a_i^p)^{1/p} (\u03a3b_i^q)^{1/q} (\u03a3c_i^r)^{1/r} }, where 1/p + 1/q + 1/r = 1. But I'm not sure how to apply it here.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for positive numbers, the sum of cubes can be related to the sum and the sum of squares. Maybe if I can express the third power in terms of the first and second moments.\n\nWait, let's think about the Newton's identities, which relate power sums to elementary symmetric sums. But that might get complicated with so many variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the sum of cubes and"

Often in optimization problems with constraints, extremal cases occur when variables are either equal or some are equal and others are different. Maybe here, the variables can be of two types, like some number of variables being x and others being y. Maybe the problem can be reduced by assuming there are two different values.\n\nLet me suppose that all the a_i are either x or y. Let me see if that's possible. Let me denote that there are k variables equal to x and (n - k) variables equal to y. Then:\n\nk*x + (n - k)*y = 96,\n\nk*x\u00b2 + (n - k)*y\u00b2 = 144,\n\nk*x\u00b3 + (n - k)*y\u00b3 = 216.\n\nSo we have three equations with variables k, n, x, y. But this might be too many variables, but maybe with some manipulations we can solve it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is only one variable, but that would require n=1, but then the sum would be a\u2081=96, sum of squares 96\u00b2 \u2260144 so that can't be. So maybe two variables is a good start.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me suppose there are two variables, so n =k + l, where k is the number of x's and l the number of y's. Let me write equations:\n\nkx + ly = 96,\n\nkx\u00b2 + ly\u00b2 = 144,\n\nkx\u00b3 + ly\u00b3 = 216.\n\nHmm, so three equations with four variables: k, l, x, y. But n =k + l is the variable we need to find. Maybe express l = n - k.\n\nThen equations become:\n\nk x + (n -k)y = 96,\n\nk x\u00b2 + (n -k)y\u00b2 = 144,\n\nk x\u00b3 + (n -k)y\u00b3 = 216.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can consider the variables x and y such that x and y can be found in terms of k and n. Alternatively, set variables such that x and y satisfy some ratio?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a system of linear equations for variables k and l. Let me consider:\n\nLet me set variables as k and l, so:\n\n"

Hmm, actually, wait, if we treat the first and second column as variables, then the determinant condition might help.\n\nAlternatively, for three equations to have a solution, the determinant condition must hold:\n\n|x   y   x\u00b3|\n\n|x\u00b2 y\u00b2 x\u00b2 y\u00b2 |  -> Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the three equations can be seen as:\n\na1 * k + b1 * l = 96,\n\na2 * k + b2 * l = 144,\n\na3 * k + b3 * l = 216,\n\nwhere a1 = x, a2 = x\u00b2, a3 =x\u00b3,\n\nand b1 = y, b2 = y\u00b2, b3 = y\u00b3.\n\nSo for this system to have a solution for k and l, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.\n\nSo determinant D = |a1  b1; a2 b2; a3 b3| must be zero.\n\nWait, no, the determinant for three equations in two variables is:\n\n| x      y      x\u00b3    |\n\n|x\u00b2    y\u00b2     x\u00b2 y\u00b2 | Wait, maybe that's not the correct way. Alternatively, maybe the determinant is the determinant of the matrix formed by the first two columns:\n\n|x   y|\n\n|x\u00b2 y\u00b2| \n\nBut since we have three equations, maybe we can set up a determinant condition for the rank to be two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vectors (x, x\u00b2, x\u00b3) and (y, y\u00b2, y\u00b3) must be proportional? Because if one is a scalar multiple of the other, then the system will have a non-trivial solution.\n\nSo, if (x, x\u00b2"

Then x = y, which would mean all variables are equal, but we saw that case doesn't work. So that approach might not help.\n\nHmm, maybe another way.

Assuming \\(y = \\frac{3}{2}\\), we derive the relationships:\n\n\\[\nk = 4(64 - l) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = 256 - 3l\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(l\\) must be an integer between 1 and 63 (since \\(l < 64\\)). This results in \\(n\\) taking values in the arithmetic sequence starting at 253 (when \\(l = 1\\)) and ending at 67 (when \\(l = 63\\)), with a common difference of -3.\n\nThe number of terms in this sequence is 63. The sum of this arithmetic sequence is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{63}{2} \\times (253 + 67) = \\frac{63}{2} \\times 320 = 63 \\times 160 = 10080\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of all possible values of \\(n\\) is \\(\\boxed{10080}\\)."
