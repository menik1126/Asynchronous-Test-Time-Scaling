A is directly north, B is directly west, C is directly south, and D is directly east. The distances between C and D are given as 140 meters.\n\nThere's also a hot-air balloon at point H, which is directly above O in the air. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. Rope HC is 150 meters long, and rope HD is 130 meters long. The problem is asking me to figure out the greatest length of rope that can be saved by replacing ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D.\n\nAlright, so to solve this, I need to visualize the setup. Since A is north of O, B is west, C is south, and D is east, the points form a rectangle around O. The distances between C and D are 140 meters, which suggests that the east-west distance from C to D is 140 meters. Since C is directly south of O and D is directly east, the coordinates of these points must be as follows if O is at (0,0): C would be at (-140/2, -k), but wait, that might not be right. Let me think about the directions.\n\nActually, since A is north, B is west, C is south, and D is east, the distances from O to each point should be the lengths of AO, BO, CO, DO. But the problem only mentions the distance between C and D, which is 140 m. Since C is south and D is east, the distance between them would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the distance from C to O (south direction) and the other leg is the distance from O to D (east direction). But wait, in reality, the points form a rectangle because A, B, C, D are positioned with A north, B west, C south, and D east.\n\nWait, but O is the center, so if A is directly north, B is directly west, C is directly south, and D is directly east, then the positions are: A is at (0, y), B is at (-x, "

Using the distance formula, that would be sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). The problem states that this distance is 140 m. So sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 140.\n\nAdditionally, the balloon is at H, which is directly above O, so H has coordinates (0,0,h), where h is the height of the balloon. The ropes HA, HB, HC, HD are the distances from H to each of those points. The problem gives HC = 150 m and HD = 130 m. Since HC is the distance from H to C, which is at (0, -y, 0), so the distance HC would be sqrt( (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - (-y))^2 + (h - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(y\u00b2 + h\u00b2) = 150. Similarly, HD is the distance from H to D, which is at (x, 0, 0), so HD is sqrt( (x)^2 + 0^2 + h^2 ) = sqrt(x\u00b2 + h\u00b2) = 130.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 140 (distance between C and D)\n2. sqrt(y\u00b2 + h\u00b2) = 150 (HC)\n3. sqrt(x\u00b2 + h\u00b2) = 130 (HD)\n\nWait, actually, the problem says HC is 150 and HD is 130, so equations 2 and 3 are correct. So we can use these equations to solve for x, y, and h.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 140\u00b2 = 19600\n\nEquation 2: y\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 150\u00b2 = 22500\n\nEquation 3: x\u00b2 + h\u00b2 = 130\u00b2 = 16900\n\nSo we have three equations with three variables: x\u00b2, y\u00b2, h\u00b2.

Let me compute that: sqrt(12600) = sqrt(100*126) = 10*sqrt(126). sqrt(126) = sqrt(9*14) = 3*sqrt(14), so y = 10*3*"

Then A is north, so in the positive y-direction, B is west, which is the negative x-direction, C is south, which is negative y-direction, and D is east, positive x-direction.

Therefore, the correct Q(t) is 19600 t\u00b2 -25200 t +22500.\n\nThus, the correct a=19600, b=-25200, c=22500.\n\nSo the minimal value is Q_min = c - b\u00b2/(4a).\n\nCompute b"
