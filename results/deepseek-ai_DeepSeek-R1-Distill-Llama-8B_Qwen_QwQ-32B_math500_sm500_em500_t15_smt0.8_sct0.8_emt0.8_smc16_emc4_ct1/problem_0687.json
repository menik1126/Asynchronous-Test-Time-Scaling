To find the possible values of \\(x\\), I need to identify all the divisors of 54 and then determine which of these divisors satisfy the condition that \\(y\\) is at least 5.\n\nThe divisors of 54 are:\n\\[\n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n\\]\nNext, I'll evaluate each divisor to see if it meets the \\(y \\geq 5\\) requirement.\n\n- **1**: \\(y = 1\\) is less than 5, so it's not valid.\n- **2**: \\(y = 2\\) is less than 5, so it's not valid.\n- **3**: \\(y = 3\\) is less than 5, so it's not valid.\n- **6**: \\(y = 6\\) is greater than or equal to 5, so it's valid.\n- **9**: \\(y = 9\\) is greater than or equal to 5, so it's valid.\n- **18**: \\(y = 18\\) is greater than or equal to 5, so it's valid.\n- **27**: \\(y = 27\\) is greater than or equal to 5, so it's valid.\n- **54**: \\(y = 54\\) is greater than or equal to 5, so it's valid.\n\nFrom this, the valid values of \\(x\\) are 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. Counting these, there are 5 possible values for \\(x\\) that satisfy both conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values for \\( x \\) (the number of players), let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of cards: \\( 54 \\"
