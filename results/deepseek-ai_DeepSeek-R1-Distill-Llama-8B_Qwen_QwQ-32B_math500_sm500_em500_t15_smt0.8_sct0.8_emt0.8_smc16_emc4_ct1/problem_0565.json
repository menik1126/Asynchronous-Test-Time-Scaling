There are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, which sums up to 11 members.\n\nSince the members are to be seated around a circular table, I should consider the circular nature of the arrangement. In circular permutations, the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) distinct items is \\( (n-1)! \\), as one position can be fixed to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that all members of each party must sit next to each other. This means that the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent each form their own blocks. Therefore, there are 3 blocks to arrange around the table.\n\nFor circular arrangements of \\( k \\) distinct blocks, the number of ways is \\( (k-1)! \\). Here, \\( k = 3 \\), so there are \\( 2! \\) ways to arrange the blocks.\n\nNext, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways, and similarly, the Republicans also have 5! ways. The Independent has only 1 way since there's only one person.\n\nFinally, I need to consider the total number of seating arrangements by multiplying the number of ways to arrange the blocks with the permutations within each block. This gives \\( 2! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1! \\).\n\nSo, the total number of ways the committee can be seated under the given conditions is \\( 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 = 28,800 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the number of ways the Senate committee can be seated around a circular table with the given conditions, let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe have:\n- **5 Democrats**\n- **5 Republicans**\n- **1 Independent**\n\nAll members of each party must sit next to each other, and two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.\n\n### Step 2: Treat Each Party as a Single Block\nSince all members of each party must sit together, we can think of each party as a single \"block.\" Thus, we have:\n- **1 Democratic Block**\n- **1 Republican Block**\n- **1 Independent Block**\n\n### Step 3: Arrange the Blocks Around the Table\nSince the table is circular, the number"
