Since the table is circular, the arrangement is considered the same if it can be rotated into another.\n\nThe key constraint is that all Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent must each sit together as a single group. This means that the seating can be broken down into three distinct blocks: one block for Democrats, one for Republicans, and one for the Independent.\n\nNext, I need to determine how many ways these three blocks can be arranged around the table. Since there are three blocks, the number of possible arrangements is 3 factorial, which is 3! = 6.\n\nHowever, because the arrangement is circular, one of these rotations is considered the same as the others. Therefore, I need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of seats, which is 11, to account for the rotational symmetry.\n\nFinally, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange them, for Republicans, also 5!, and for the Independent, there's only 1! way since there's only one person.\n\nMultiplying these together, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is (3! / 11) * (5! * 5! * 1!) = (6 / 11) * (120 * 120) = (720 / 11) * 14400 = (720 * 14400) / 11 = 10,368,000 / 11 = 941,909.09. However, since the number of arrangements must be an integer, I need to adjust the approach to ensure the result is whole.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for the Senate committee around a circular table, where members of each party must sit together, we can break down the problem into the following steps:\n\n1. **Treat each party as a single unit or \"block\"**. This means we have three blocks: Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent.\n\n2. **Arrange the blocks around the circular table**. Since the table is circular, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered identical. The number of distinct ways to arrange \\( n \\) blocks around a circular table is \\( (n-1)! \\). Here, \\( n = 3 \\), so the number of arrangements is:\n   \\[\n   (3-1)!"

The total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the blocks and the number of ways to arrange the members within each block:\n   \\[\n   2! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1! = 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 \\times 1 = 2 \\times 14400 = 28800\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{28800}\n\\]"
