So, if Yann chooses a particular dish, Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\nTherefore, the total number of combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - **Total Dishes:** There are 10 different dishes on the menu.\n   - **Restriction:** Yann and Camille cannot order the same dish.\n   - **Order Matters:** Yann ordering Chicken and Camille ordering Fish is different from Yann ordering Fish and Camille ordering Chicken.\n\n2. **Calculate the Possible Combinations:**\n   - **First, Yann has 10 choices for his dish.**\n   - **After Yann orders, Camille has 9 remaining choices (since she cannot order the same dish as Yann).**\n   - **Therefore, the total number of combinations is:**\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   The number of different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order is \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish?
