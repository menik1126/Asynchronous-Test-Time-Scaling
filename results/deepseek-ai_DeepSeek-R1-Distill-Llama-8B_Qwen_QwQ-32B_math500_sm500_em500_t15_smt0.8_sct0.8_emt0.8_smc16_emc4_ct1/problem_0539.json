Since they refuse to order the same dish, their choices must be distinct.\n\nTo determine the number of possible combinations, I can calculate the number of ways Yann can choose a dish and then multiply it by the number of remaining choices Camille has.\n\nYann has 10 options to choose from. After Yann has made his selection, there are 9 remaining dishes Camille can choose from.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order, given that they refuse to order the same dish.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\n- **Total Dishes Available:** 10\n- **Each Person Chooses One Dish:**\n  - Yann orders one dish.\n  - Camille orders one dish.\n- **Condition:** They do not order the same dish.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Number of Choices for Yann**\n\n- Yann has **10** possible dishes to choose from.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Choices for Camille**\n\n- After Yann has chosen a dish, Camille cannot choose the same one.\n- So, Camille has **9** remaining dishes to choose from.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Total Number of Combinations**\n\n- For each choice Yann makes, Camille has 9 options.\n- Therefore, the total number of combinations is:\n  \n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
