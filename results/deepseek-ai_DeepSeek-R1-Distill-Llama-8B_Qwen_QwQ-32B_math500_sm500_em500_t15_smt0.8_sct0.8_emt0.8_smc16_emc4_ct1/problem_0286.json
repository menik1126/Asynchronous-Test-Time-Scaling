            "output": "To compute the sum \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), I'll start by examining the pattern of the series.\n\nFirst, I notice that the series alternates between adding and subtracting consecutive integers. This creates pairs of numbers that can be grouped together. For example, the first two terms are \\(1 - 2\\), which equals \\(-1\\). The next two terms are \\(3 - 4\\), also equal to \\(-1\\), and this pattern continues all the way to \\(99 - 100\\), which is again \\(-1\\).\n\nThere are a total of 100 terms in the series, so there are 50 such pairs. Each pair sums to \\(-1\\). By adding these together, the total sum of the series is \\(50 \\times (-1) = -50\\).\n</think>\n\n**Question:** Compute: \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\).\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's evaluate the given series step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   \n   The series alternates between addition and subtraction of consecutive integers:\n   \\[\n   1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Group the Terms into Pairs:**\n   \n   Pair each positive term with the following negative term:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate Each Pair:**\n   \n   Each pair simplifies to \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   -1 + (-1) + (-1) + \\dots + (-1)\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Determine the Number of Pairs:**\n   \n   There are \\(100\\) terms in total, so there are \\(50\\) pairs:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times (-1) = -50\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{-50}\n   \\]"
