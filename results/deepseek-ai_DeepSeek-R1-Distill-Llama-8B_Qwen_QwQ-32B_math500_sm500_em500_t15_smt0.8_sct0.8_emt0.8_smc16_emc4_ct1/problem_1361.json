            "output": "I need to determine the number of boys attending the math club meeting. There are 35 students in total, and the number of girls is a multiple of 13. Additionally, there are more girls than boys.\n\nFirst, I'll represent the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. The equations I know are:\n\nG + B = 35\nG = 13k, where k is an integer\nG > B\n\nSince G is a multiple of 13, possible values for G are 13, 26, 39, and so on. However, G cannot exceed 35 because the total number of students is 35.\n\nTesting the possible multiples:\n- If G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. This satisfies G > B.\n- If G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. This does not satisfy G > B because 13 < 22.\n- Higher multiples like 39 are not possible because they exceed the total number of students.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible solution is G = 26 and B = 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls, \\( G \\), is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is more than the number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\n**We know:**\n1. \\( G + B = 35 \\)  \n2. \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13, so \\( G = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.  \n3. \\( G > B \\)\n\n**Step 1:** Express \\( B \\) in terms of \\( G \\):\n\\[\nB = 35 - G\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute \\( G = 13k \\) into the equation:\n\\[\nB = 35 - 13k\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Use the condition \\( G > B \\):\n\\[\nG > B \\\\\n13k > 35 - 13k \\\\\n13k + 13k > 35 \\\\\n26k > 35 \\\\\nk > \\frac{35}{26} \\\\\nk > 1.346\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer,"
