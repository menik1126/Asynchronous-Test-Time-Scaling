However, since the total number of students is 35, G cannot exceed 35. This limits G to either 13 or 26.\n\nNext, I consider the condition that there are more girls than boys. If G is 13, then B would be 22 (since 35 - 13 = 22), but this contradicts the condition of more girls than boys. Therefore, G cannot be 13.\n\nThen, I test G = 26. Subtracting this from the total gives B = 9 (since 35 - 26 = 9). In this case, there are indeed more girls than boys, as 26 > 9.\n\nThus, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n\n**Given:**\n1. Total number of students = 35\n2. Number of girls (\\( G \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n3. There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Step 1: Set Up the Equations**\n\nFrom the total number of students:\n\\[\nB + G = 35 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine Possible Values for \\( G \\)**\n\nSince \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13 and \\( G \\) must be less than 35 (because there are more girls than boys), the possible values for \\( G \\) are:\n\\[\nG = 13 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad G = 26\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Test Each Possible Value of \\( G \\)**\n\n1. **If \\( G = 13 \\):**\n\\[\nB = 35 - 13 = 22\n\\]\nBut this contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys (since 13 girls < 22 boys).\n\n2. **If \\( G = 26"
