            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that 84 is the product, and I need to break it down into its prime factors to get an idea of what numbers I can use. So, let's start by prime factorizing 84.\n\n84 divided by 2 is 42.  \n42 divided by 2 is 21.  \n21 divided by 3 is 7.  \n7 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7. That means 84 can be written as 2 * 2 * 3 * 7, right? But I think I can combine these factors into different numbers to get the smallest possible sum.\n\nSince I need distinct positive integers, I can't have the same number twice. So, maybe I can group these prime factors into larger numbers. Let's see.\n\nStarting with the smallest possible integers. Let's try to use 1, because 1 is the smallest positive integer and doesn't affect the product. Then, I can try to use 2, but wait, 2 is already a prime factor. Let's check if that's useful.\n\nIf I use 1, then the remaining product is 84. So, let's see, the next number after 1 can be 2, but I already have 2 in the factors. So, 2 is a prime factor, so I can have 2 as one number.\n\nWait, but if I use 1, 2, 3, and 7, then the sum would be 1+2+3+7=13. But maybe I can group the factors into larger numbers, which might result in a smaller sum.\n\nFor example, if I group 2 and 3 together, that makes 6. So, then the set could be {1, 6, 7}. Let's calculate the sum: 1+6+7=14. That's actually higher than 13, so that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, if I group 2 and 2, but wait, I can't have 2 twice because they need to be distinct. So, that's not allowed.\n\nWhat about grouping 2, 3, and"

Let me see. If I don't use 1, then the numbers have to multiply to 84 without 1. Let's see.\n\nThe prime factors are 2, 2, 3, 7. To make distinct numbers, I can combine the two 2s into 4. So, then the numbers would be 4, 3, 7. Their product is 4*3*7=84. The sum is 4+3+7=14. But that's higher than 13. So, worse than the previous option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine 2 and 3 into 6, and leave the other 2 and 7. But then the numbers would be 2, 6, 7. Their product is 2*6*7=84. The sum is 2+6+7=15. That's even worse.\n\nHmm, so maybe using 1 is better here. Let me think again. The set {1, 2, 3, 7} gives a sum of 13. Is there a way to get a smaller sum?\n\nWait, maybe there's another combination. Let's see. Let's try to split the factors differently. For instance, instead of having 2, 2, 3, 7, maybe combine the two 2s into 4 and then combine with 3 to make 12? Then the numbers would be 12 and 7. But 12*7=84. The sum is 12+7=19, which is way higher. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 2, 3, and 14? 2*3*14=84. The sum is 2+3+14=19 again. Not better.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think of all possible sets of distinct integers greater than 0 that multiply to 84, and find the one with the smallest sum.\n\nLet me list possible factorizations:\n\nFirst, starting with 1:\n\n1, 84 → sum 85 ("
