These factors are the prime bases needed to form the integers.\n\nNext, I'll work towards distributing these prime factors into the largest possible numbers to minimize the sum. \n\nFirst, I'll multiply the smallest factors together to form 2 and 3, which are already prime. This gives me two integers: 2 and 3. The sum so far is 5.\n\nThen, I'll multiply the remaining factor of 2 and 7 to form the largest possible integer, which is 14. \n\nAdding this to the previous sum, the total becomes 19. \n\nI'll verify that this set of integers (2, 3, 7, 14) are all distinct and their product is indeed 84. \n\nSince using larger integers doesn't reduce the sum further, the least possible sum is 19.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84 into its prime components:**\n   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Distribute the prime factors into the largest possible integers to minimize the sum:**\n   - Start with the smallest primes: \\(2\\) and \\(3\\).\n   - Multiply the remaining factors \\(2\\) and \\(7\\) to form the largest integer possible: \\(14\\).\n\n3. **List the integers and calculate their sum:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Integers} = \\{2, 3, 7, 14\\}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = 2 + 3 + 7 + 14 = 19\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify that all integers are distinct and their product equals 84:**\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 14 = 84\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{All integers are distinct.}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum of these integers is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{19}\\]"
