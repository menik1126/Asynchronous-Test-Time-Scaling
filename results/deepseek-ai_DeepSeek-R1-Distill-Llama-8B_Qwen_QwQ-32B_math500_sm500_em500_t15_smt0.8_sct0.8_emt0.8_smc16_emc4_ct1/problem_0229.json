Bill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south twice, so that's a total of \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\) mile south.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the displacement in the east direction. Bill walks \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east once.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from the starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. The straight-line distance \\(d\\) is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle where one leg is the south displacement (1 mile) and the other leg is the east displacement (\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile).\n\nUsing the formula \\(d = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), where \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = \\frac{3}{4}\\), I'll calculate the distance.\n\nSo, \\(d = \\sqrt{1^2 + (\\frac{3}{4})^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25\\) miles.\n\nTherefore, Bill is 1.25 miles away from his starting point in a direct line.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down Bill's journey step by step to determine his straight-line distance from the starting point.\n\n1. **Southward Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks **\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)** mile south.\n   - Then, he walks another **\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)** mile south.\n   - **Total Southward Displacement:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile.\n\n2. **Eastward Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks **\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)** mile east.\n   - **Total Eastward Displacement:** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile.\n\n3. **Calculating the Straight-Line Distance:**\n   - To find the straight-line distance from the starting point, we can use the Pythagorean theorem.\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the straight-line distance.\n   \n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{(\\text{Southward Displacement})^2 + (\\text{Eastward Dis"
