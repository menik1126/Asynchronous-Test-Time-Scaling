I know that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. This means that 1 Blinket is equal to 7/3 Drinkets.\n\nNext, I'll find out how many Blinkets are in one Trinket. Since 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, I can express this as 1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets.\n\nNow, I'll establish a direct relationship between Trinkets and Drinkets by converting Blinkets to Drinkets first, and then converting to Trinkets.\n\nI'll multiply the number of Trinkets by the number of Blinkets per Trinket to get the total number of Blinkets.\n\nThen, I'll convert the total number of Blinkets into Drinkets by dividing by the number of Drinkets per Blinket.\n\nThis will give me the total value of the 56 Drinkets in Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conversion Rates:**\n   - **Trinkets to Blinkets:** \\( 1 \\text{ Trinket} = 4 \\text{ Blinkets} \\)\n   - **Blinkets to Drinkets:** \\( 3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets} \\)\n\n2. **Find the Relationship Between Trinkets and Drinkets:**\n   \n   - First, express Blinkets in terms of Drinkets:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ Blinket} = \\frac{7}{3} \\text{ Drinkets}\n     \\]\n   \n   - Then, express Trinkets in terms of Blinkets:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ Trinket} = 4 \\text{ Blinkets} = 4 \\times \\frac{7}{3} \\text{ Drinkets} = \\frac{28}{3} \\text{ Drinkets}\n     \\]\n   \n   - Therefore, the value of \\( 1 \\text{ Trinket} \\) in Drinkets is \\( \\frac{28}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Convert 56 Drinkets to Trinkets:**\n   \n   \\[\n   56 \\text"
