            "output": "To solve the problem, I first need to determine the perimeter of the hexagon. A regular hexagon has six sides, each measuring 16 cm.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, the octagon's perimeter is also 96 cm.\n\nA regular octagon has eight sides. To find the length of each side, I divide the total perimeter by the number of sides: 96 cm divided by 8, which equals 12 cm.\n\nTherefore, each side of the octagon is 12 cm long.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine the perimeter of the hexagon.**\n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   - **Perimeter of hexagon** = Number of sides × Length of each side\n   - **Perimeter of hexagon** = 6 × 16 cm = **96 cm**\n\n2. **Set the perimeter of the octagon equal to the hexagon's perimeter.**\n   - The problem states that the regular octagon has the **same perimeter** as the hexagon.\n   - **Perimeter of octagon** = **96 cm**\n\n3. **Find the length of each side of the octagon.**\n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   - Let \\( s \\) be the length of each side of the octagon.\n   - **Perimeter of octagon** = 8 × \\( s \\)\n   - \\( 8s = 96 \\) cm\n   - Solve for \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
