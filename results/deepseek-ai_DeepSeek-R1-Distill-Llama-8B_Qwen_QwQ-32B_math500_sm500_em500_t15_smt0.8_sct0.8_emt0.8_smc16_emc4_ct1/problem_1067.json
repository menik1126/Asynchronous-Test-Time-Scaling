            "output": "To determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, I first need to understand the relationship between the perimeters of the regular octagon and the regular hexagon.\n\nA regular hexagon has six equal sides, so the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length by 6. Given that the side length of the hexagon is 16 cm, the perimeter of the hexagon is 16 cm multiplied by 6, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, the perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm. A regular octagon has eight equal sides, so to find the length of each side of the octagon, I divide the total perimeter by the number of sides. Therefore, 96 cm divided by 8 equals 12 cm.\n\nThus, each side of the regular octagon is 12 cm long.\n</think>\n\nSure! Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nA regular octagon has the same perimeter as the regular hexagon shown here with a side length of 16 cm. How long is each side of the octagon?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Perimeter of a Regular Hexagon:**\n   - A regular hexagon has **6 equal sides**.\n   - Given the side length of the hexagon (\\( s_{\\text{hexagon}} \\)) is **16 cm**.\n   - **Perimeter of the hexagon** (\\( P_{\\text{hexagon}} \\)) is calculated by:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times s_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16 \\, \\text{cm} = 96 \\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Set Up the Perimeter of the Regular Octagon:**\n   - A regular octagon has **8 equal sides**.\n   - Let the side length of the octagon be \\( s_{\\text{octagon}} \\) cm.\n   - **Perimeter of the octagon** (\\( P_{\\text{octagon}} \\)) is calculated by:\n     \\[\n     P_{\\text{octagon}} = 8 \\times s_{\\text{octagon}}\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Equate the Perimeters (Hexagon and Octagon):**\n   - Since the perimeters are equal"
