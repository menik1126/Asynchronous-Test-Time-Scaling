            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial: 2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0. It's a quartic polynomial, which means the highest power of x is 4. The coefficients a_3, a_2, and a_1 are integers, but their specific values aren't given. The problem is asking for the number of different possible rational roots this polynomial can have.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. I think it helps in finding possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Let me recall what it says. The Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction p/q, where p and q are integers, must satisfy that p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. So, according to the theorem, p, the numerator of the possible root, can be any factor of 1. The factors of 1 are just ±1, right? Because 1 only has two divisors: 1 and -1.\n\nNow, for q, the denominator, it can be any factor of the leading coefficient, which is 2. The factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. So q can be 1, -1, 2, or -2.\n\nTherefore, the possible rational roots are formed by taking each factor p of the constant term and dividing it by each factor q of the leading coefficient. So let me list all possible combinations:\n\nWhen p = 1:\n- 1 / 1 = 1\n- 1 / (-1) = -1\n- 1 / 2 = 1/2\n- 1 / (-2) = -1/2\n\nWhen p = -1:\n- (-1) / 1 = -1\n- (-1) / (-1) = 1\n- (-1) / 2 = -1/2\n- (-1) / (-2) = 1/2\n\nWait, but I notice that some of these are duplicates. For example, 1 and -1 appear both when p=1 and p=-1 with q=1 and q=-1. Similarly, 1/2 and -1/2"

            "output": " also show up in both p=1 and p=-1. So I need to make sure I only count each unique possible root once.\n\nSo compiling the unique possibilities, they are: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nThat gives me four possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2.\n\nAre there any other possibilities? Let me double-check. The constant term is 1, so no other factors besides ±1. The leading coefficient is 2, factors are ±1, ±2. So yeah, all possible p/q are accounted for, and duplicates removed, resulting in four distinct possible rational roots.\n\nI don't think I missed any. The list includes all the combinations, and after removing duplicates, it's four unique possibilities. So the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different possible rational roots is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\), we use the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) in lowest terms, must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nFor the given polynomial:\n- The constant term is 1, so the factors of the constant term are \\( \\pm 1 \\).\n- The leading coefficient is 2, so the factors of the leading coefficient are \\( \\pm 1 \\) and \\( \\pm 2 \\).\n\nWe consider all possible combinations of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\):\n\n- When \\(p = 1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{-1} = -1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- When \\(p = -1\\): \\(\\frac{-1}{1} = -1\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{-1} = 1\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\"
