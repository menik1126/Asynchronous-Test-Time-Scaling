I need to find the number of different possible rational roots it can have. Hmm, okay, where do I start?\n\nI remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me recall what it says. I think it states that any possible rational solution \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. So, for my polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. \n\nWait, so does that mean the possible \\(p\\) values are the factors of 1 and \\(q\\) values are the factors of 2? Let me think. The factors of 1 are just ±1, right? Because 1 is a prime number, so its only divisors are 1 and -1. And the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. \n\nSo, the possible values for \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) would be all combinations of \\(p\\) divided by \\(q\\). That is, \\( \\pm1/1 \\) and \\( \\pm1/2 \\). So that gives me possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. \n\nAre there any other possible roots? Let me double-check. The polynomial is fourth degree, so it can have up to four roots, but some of them might be repeated or irreducible. But since we're talking about possible rational roots, the Rational Root Theorem gives us all the candidates. \n\nWait a second, could there be any other factors? Let me see. The constant term is 1, so the only factors are ±1, and the leading coefficient is 2, so the factors are ±1, ±2. Therefore, the possible rational roots are all possible combinations of numerator and denominator from these factors. So yes, that would be 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. \n\nIs there a possibility that combining these fractions could give me more distinct roots? Let me list them out: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2"

            "output": ". That's four different rational numbers. \n\nBut hold on, the question says \"different possible rational roots\". Since the coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) can be any integers, maybe some of these roots can't actually occur? Or maybe all of them are possible?\n\nHmm, I need to check if each of these candidates can actually be a root for some choice of the coefficients. Let me test each one.\n\nStarting with 1: If 1 is a root, then plugging into the polynomial gives \\(2(1)^4 + a_3(1)^3 + a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) + 1 = 0\\). That simplifies to \\(2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + 1 = 0\\), so \\(a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = -3\\). Since \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) are integers, this equation is possible. For example, set \\(a_3 = 0\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = -3\\). So 1 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, testing -1: Plugging in -1 gives \\(2(-1)^4 + a_3(-1)^3 + a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) + 1 = 0\\). That's \\(2 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 + 1 = 0\\), so \\(-a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = -3\\). Again, integers can satisfy this. Let's say \\(a_3 = 0\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = 3\\). Then the equation becomes \\( -0 + 0 - 3 = -3 \\), which works. So -1 is possible.\n\nNow 1/2: Let's plug in \\(x = 1/2\\). The polynomial becomes \\(2*(1/2)^4 + a_3*(1/2)^3 + a_2*(1/2)^2 + a_1*(1/2) + 1 = 0\\). Calculating each term:\n\n\\(2*(1/16) = 1/8"

Since all coefficients are integers, this equation is solvable. For instance, set \\(a_3 = -9\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = 0\\). Then left-hand side is -9 + 0 + 0 = -9, which satisfies the equation. So \\(1/2\\) is a possible root.\n\nLastly, testing -1/2: Plug in \\(x = -1/2\\). \n\nPolynomial becomes: \\(2*(-1/2)^4 + a_3*(-1/2)^3 + a_2*(-1/2)^2 + a_1*(-1/2) + 1 = 0\\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\(2*(1/16) = 1/8\\)\n\n\\(a_3*(-1/8)\\)\n\n\\(a_2*(1/4)\\)\n\n\\(a_1*(-1/2)\\)\n\nPlus 1.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n\\(1/8 - (a_3)/8 + (a_2)/4 - (a_1)/2 + 1 = 0\\)\n\nMultiply by 8:\n\n1 - a_3 + 2a_2 - 4a_1 + 8 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(-a_3 + 2a_2 -4a_1 = -9\\)\n\nOr,\n\n\\(-a_3 + 2a_2 -4a_1 = -9\\)\n\nWe need integers \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_1\\) such that this holds.

Hmm, so this choice doesn't work.\n\nWait, but maybe choosing different values. Let me try \\(a_3 = 4\\), \\(a_2 = 5\\), \\(a_1 = 10\\). Plugging into \\(-4 + 10 -40 = -34\\), which is not -9. Hmm, maybe try \\(a_3 = 2\\), \\(a_2 = 3\\), \\(a_1 = 5\\). Then \\(-2 + 6 -20 = -16\\). Still not -9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, set \\( -a_3 + 2a_2 -4a_1 = -9\\). Let's express this as: \\( -a_3 = -9 -2a_2 +4a_1\\), so \\(a_3 = 9 + 2a_2 -4a_1\\). Since \\(a_3\\) must be an integer, as long as \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\) are integers, this expression is integer. For example, set \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = 0\\), then \\(a_3 = 9\\). Plugging back in, \\( -9 + 0 -0 = -9 \\), which works. So yes, -1/2 is possible.\n\nSo all four possible rational roots 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2 can be achieved by choosing suitable integer coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_1\\). Therefore, each of these is a possible rational root, and there's no overlap because each is distinct.\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is four.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\) with integer coefficients, we apply the Rational Root Theorem.\n\n"
