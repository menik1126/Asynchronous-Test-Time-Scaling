So, I can write the equation:\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nNext, it's mentioned that two treeks and one goolee equal the weight of one squig. This gives me another equation:\n2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I'll substitute the second equation into the first one to eliminate G. From the second equation, G = S - 2T. Plugging this into the first equation:\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n10T = 4S - 2T\nAdding 2T to both sides:\n12T = 4S\nDividing both sides by 4:\n3T = S\n\nThis shows that the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of three treeks.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Problem:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n3. The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nLet:\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Information into Equations**\n\nFrom statement **1**:\n\\[\n10T = 3S + G\n\\]\n\nFrom statement **2**:\n\\[\n2T + G = S\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute \\( G \\) from the Second Equation into the First**\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( G = S - 2T \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( T \\) in Terms of \\( S \\)**\n\nAdd \\("
