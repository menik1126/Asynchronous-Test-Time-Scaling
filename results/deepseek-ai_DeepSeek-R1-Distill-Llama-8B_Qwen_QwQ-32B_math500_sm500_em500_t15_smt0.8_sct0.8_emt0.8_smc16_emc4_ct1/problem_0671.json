            "output": "First, I need to assign variables to each type of creature to make the relationships clearer.\n\nLet T be the weight of one treek, S be the weight of one squig, and G be the weight of one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, ten treeks weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee, so I can write the equation: 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says that two treeks and one goolee equal one squig, leading to the equation: 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate S and G.\n\nSubstituting S with 2T + G in the first equation gives: 10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nSimplifying this, I get: 10T = 6T + 3G + G.\n\nContinuing the simplification: 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides: 4T = 4G.\n\nTherefore, T equals G, so one treek weighs the same as one goolee.\n\nNow, substituting T for G in the second equation: 2T + T = S.\n\nThis simplifies to 3T = S.\n\nSo, one squig weighs three times as much as one treek.\n\nFinally, to find out how many treeks equal one squig, I divide both sides by 3: T = S/3.\n\nTherefore, three treeks equal one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute the second equation into the first equation.\nSince \\( S = 2T + G \\), replace \\( S \\) in the first equation:\n\\[\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G"
