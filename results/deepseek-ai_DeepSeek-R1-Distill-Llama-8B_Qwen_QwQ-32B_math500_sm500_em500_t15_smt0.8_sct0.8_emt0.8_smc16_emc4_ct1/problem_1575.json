            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of (5 divided by sqrt(80) plus sqrt(845) over 9 plus sqrt(45), all divided by sqrt(5)). That sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to simplify each of the square roots in the numerator before dealing with the division by sqrt(5). Let me list them out: sqrt(80), sqrt(845), and sqrt(45). Hmm, maybe each of these can be simplified by factoring out perfect squares.\n\nStarting with sqrt(80). I know that 80 can be factored into 16 times 5, right? Because 16 times 5 is 80. And since 16 is a perfect square, sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5), which is sqrt(16)*sqrt(5) = 4*sqrt(5). Cool, so sqrt(80) simplifies to 4√5.\n\nNext, sqrt(845). Hmm, let's see. I need to factor 845 into a product of a perfect square and another number. Let me try dividing by some squares. Does 25 go into 845? 25 times 33 is 825, which is too low. 25 times 34 is 850, which is higher. So maybe 5 squared, which is 25, isn't a factor. Let's try 13 squared, since 13 times 13 is 169. If I divide 845 by 169, let's see: 169 times 5 is 845. Perfect! So sqrt(845) is sqrt(169*5), which is sqrt(169)*sqrt(5) = 13√5. Great, so that becomes 13√5.\n\nNow, sqrt(45). Let's factor that. I know 9 times 5 is 45, and 9 is a perfect square. So sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) = 3√5. Got that down.\n\nSo replacing the square roots in the original expression, the numerator becomes 5/(4√5) + (13√5)/9 + 3√5. Okay, now I need to simplify each term in that numerator.\n\nStarting with 5/(4√5). I remember that when you have a square root in the denominator, you can rationalize it by"

            "output": " multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(5). So 5/(4√5) times (sqrt(5)/sqrt(5)) is (5*sqrt(5))/(4*5) = (5√5)/20. Simplifying that, 5 divided by 5 is 1, so it's √5/4.\n\nNext term: (13√5)/9. That's already simplified, I think, because 13 and 9 have no common factors, and the square root of 5 can't be simplified further.\n\nThird term: 3√5. That's straightforward.\n\nSo now, the numerator is √5/4 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5. I need to combine these terms. They all have √5, so I can factor that out and just add the coefficients.\n\nLet me convert them to have a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) for 4, 9, and 1 is 36. So I'll convert each term to have 36 as the denominator.\n\nFirst term: √5/4 = (9√5)/36. Because 4 times 9 is 36, so 1 times 9 is 9.\n\nSecond term: (13√5)/9 = (52√5)/36. Because 9 times 4 is 36, so 13 times 4 is 52.\n\nThird term: 3√5 = (108√5)/36. Because 1 times 36 is 36, so 3 times 36 is 108.\n\nSo adding them together: 9√5/36 + 52√5/36 + 108√5/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)√5/36. Let's compute 9 + 52: that's 61, then 61 + 108 is 169. So the numerator is 169√5/36.\n\nNow, putting it all back into the original expression, we have sqrt[(169√5/36) divided by sqrt(5)]. So let me write that as sqrt[(169√5)/(36*sqrt(5))], because dividing by sqrt(5) is the same as multiplying by 1/sqrt(5).\n\nSimplifying inside the square root: (169√5)/(36*sqrt(5)). The √5"

            "output": " in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out, right? So that becomes 169/36.\n\nSo now we have sqrt(169/36). The square root of 169 is 13, and the square root of 36 is 6. So the entire expression simplifies to 13/6.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from sqrt(80) = 4√5, sqrt(845) =13√5, sqrt(45)=3√5. So the numerator was 5/(4√5) +13√5/9 +3√5. Rationalizing 5/(4√5) gives √5/4, right? Then combining all terms with denominator 36: √5/4 is 9√5/36, 13√5/9 is 52√5/36, and 3√5 is 108√5/36. Adding those gives 169√5/36. Then dividing by sqrt(5), which is the same as multiplying by 1/sqrt(5), so 169√5/(36*sqrt(5)) =169/36. Then sqrt(169/36)=13/6. Yea, that seems right.
