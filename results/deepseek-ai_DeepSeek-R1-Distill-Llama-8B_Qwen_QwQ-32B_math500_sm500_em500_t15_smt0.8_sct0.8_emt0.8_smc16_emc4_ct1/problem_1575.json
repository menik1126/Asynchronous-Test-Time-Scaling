The expression given is:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}}+\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9}+\\sqrt{45}}{\\sqrt{5}}}.$$\n\nHmm, okay. So, the main task is to simplify the entire fraction inside the square root and then take the square root of it. Let me break this down into smaller parts.\n\nFirst, I notice that the numerator inside the square root is a sum of three terms: $$\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}}$$, $$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9}$$, and $$\\sqrt{45}$$. Each of these terms has square roots in them, so maybe I can simplify each term individually before adding them up.\n\nLet's start with the first term: $$\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}}$$. I know that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually preferred, so maybe I can rationalize the denominator. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $$\\sqrt{80}$$, which gives:\n\n$$\\dfrac{5 \\times \\sqrt{80}}{\\sqrt{80} \\times \\sqrt{80}} = \\dfrac{5\\sqrt{80}}{80}.$$\n\nOkay, now let's simplify $$\\sqrt{80}$$. The number 80 can be factored into 16 and 5, because 16 * 5 = 80. Since 16 is a perfect square, its square root is 4. So:\n\n$$\\sqrt{80} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{16} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 4\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nSubstituting that back into the first term:\n\n$$\\dfrac{5 \\times 4\\sqrt{5}}{80} = \\dfrac{20\\sqrt{5}}{80}.$$\n\nNow, simplifying the fraction 20/80, which reduces to 1/4. So, the first term simplifies to:\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{4}\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nAlright, moving on to the second term: $$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9}$$. Let's see if 845 can be simplified. I know that"

Also, 169 is 13 squared, so:\n\n$$\\sqrt{845} = \\sqrt{5 \\times 169} = \\sqrt{5} \\times \\sqrt{169} = 13\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nTherefore, the second term becomes:\n\n$$\\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9}.$$\n\nGot that. Now, the third term is $$\\sqrt{45}$$. Let's simplify this. 45 can be factored into 9 and 5, and 9 is a perfect square:\n\n$$\\sqrt{45} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 5} = \\sqrt{9} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 3\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nSo, the third term is $$\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{5}}{1}$$ or just $$3\\sqrt{5}$$.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the entire numerator with the simplified terms:\n\nFirst term: $$\\dfrac{1}{4}\\sqrt{5}$$\n\nSecond term: $$\\dfrac{13}{9}\\sqrt{5}$$\n\nThird term: $$3\\sqrt{5}$$\n\nSo, the numerator is:\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{4}\\sqrt{5} + \\dfrac{13}{9}\\sqrt{5} + 3\\sqrt{5}.$$\n\nSince all terms have $$\\sqrt{5}$$, I can factor that out:\n\n$$\\sqrt{5} \\left( \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\dfrac{13}{9} + 3 \\right).$$\n\nNow, I need to compute the sum inside the parentheses. Let's find a common denominator for 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator (LCD) for 4, 9, and 1 is 36.\n\nSo, converting each term:\n\n- $$\\dfrac{1}{4} = \\dfrac{9}{36}$$\n- $$\\dfrac{13}{9} = \\dfrac{52}{36}$$\n- $$3 = \\dfrac{36}{36}$$\n\nAdding them up:\n\n$$\\dfrac{9}{36} + \\dfrac{52}{36} + \\dfrac{36"

So:\n\n$$\\dfrac{97\\sqrt{5}}{36} \\times \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\dfrac{97}{36} \\times \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}}.$$\n\nSince √5 / √5 = 1, it simplifies to:\n\n$$\\dfrac{97}{36}.$$\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of this fraction:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\dfrac{97}{36}}.$$\n\nThe square root of 97 is irrational, so we can't simplify that further. However, we can simplify the denominator:\n\n√36 = 6.\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\sqrt{97}}{6}.$$\n\nHmm, wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.\n\nStarting from the numerator:\n\n5/√80 was simplified to (1/4)√5. Then, √845 became 13√5 over 9, and √45 became 3√5. Adding those together, I think that was okay.\n\nThen, factoring out √5, the coefficients were 1/4, 13/9, and 3. Adding those up, I converted them to 9/36, 52/36, and 36/36, which sums to 97/36. That seems correct.\n\nThen, dividing by √5, which leaves 97/36, and then taking the square root gives √97 / 6. Hmm, I think that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I handle the denominator correctly?\n\nThe entire numerator inside the square root was the sum of the three terms, each with √5, and after adding, it became 97"

Then the square root of that is sqrt(97)/6. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach the problem where the terms can be simplified more before adding?\n\nLet me check each term again:\n\nFirst term: 5 / sqrt(80). Rationalizing gives 5 sqrt(80)/80. sqrt(80) is 4 sqrt(5), so 5*4 sqrt(5)/80 = 20 sqrt(5)/80 = sqrt(5)/4. That's correct.\n\nSecond term: sqrt(845)/9. sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*169) = sqrt(5)*13, so 13 sqrt(5)/9. Correct.\n\nThird term: sqrt(45) is 3 sqrt(5). Correct.\n\nAdding them: sqrt(5)*(1/4 +13/9 +3).

Wait, 97 divided by 36 is approximately 2.694, but 0.25 + 1.444 + 3 is 4.694. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, so I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, 1/4 + 13/9 + 3. Let me recalculate the fractions step by step.\n\nFirst, 1/4 + 13/9. To add these, common denominator is 36. So:\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\nSo 9/36 + 52/3"

So, 169/36.\n\nWait, so that's different from before. Wait, earlier I said 1/4 + 13/9 +3 = 97/36, but now I'm seeing it's 169/36. I must have made a mistake in the first calculation.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong? Let me check again.\n\nWait, 1/4 is 9/36,\n\n13/9 is 52/36,\n\n3 is 108/36.\n\nSo, adding them: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169.

So, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nWait, the mistake was that when I added up the coefficients, I think I miscalculated the numerator.\n\nWait, initially, I had:\n\nsqrt(5) times (1/4 +13/9 + 3). So let me compute 1/4 +13/9 + 3.\n\nConverting all to 36 denominator:\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\n3 = 108/36.\n\nAdding those together: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169.

So the final answer is 13/6.\n\nHmm, so my first calculation had an error in adding the numerators. I must have added 9 +52 +36 instead of 9 +52 +108. That's where the mistake was.
