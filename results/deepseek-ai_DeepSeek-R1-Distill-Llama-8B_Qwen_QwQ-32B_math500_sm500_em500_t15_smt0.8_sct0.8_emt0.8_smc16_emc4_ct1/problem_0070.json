            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: Given a positive integer \\( n \\), I need to find the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\). Hmm, okay. I remember that the greatest common divisor, or gcd, of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest possible number that can divide both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\nLet me write down what I know. Let me denote \\( d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\). So, \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). That means, there exist integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that \\( n + 7 = d \\cdot a \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = d \\cdot b \\).\n\nNow, I should find the relationship between these two equations. Since both expressions equal multiples of \\( d \\), maybe I can set up some equations or use the property of gcds to find \\( d \\).\n\nOne method I remember is the Euclidean algorithm, which helps in finding the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying division. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I have \\( 2n + 1 \\) and \\( n + 7 \\), I can perform the Euclidean algorithm steps. First, subtract \\( 2 \\times (n + 7) \\) from \\( 2n + 1 \\) to eliminate \\( n \\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\( 2n + 1 - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\).\n\nSo, after subtracting, I get a remainder of -13. But in the Euclidean algorithm, we usually take the absolute value, so the remainder is 13. Therefore, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\).\n\nThis reduces the problem to finding the gcd of \\( n + 7 \\) and 13. Since 13 is a prime number, the gcd can only be either 1 or 13. So, the maximum possible value of \\( d \\)"

            "output": " is 13, provided that 13 divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\nWait, let me verify that. If \\( d = 13 \\), then \\( n + 7 \\) must be a multiple of 13, so \\( n + 7 = 13k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). Therefore, \\( n = 13k - 7 \\). Let me plug this into \\( 2n + 1 \\) to see if it's also a multiple of 13.\n\nSo, \\( 2n + 1 = 2(13k - 7) + 1 = 26k - 14 + 1 = 26k - 13 = 13(2k - 1) \\). \n\nAh, yes! That's definitely a multiple of 13. So, if \\( n = 13k - 7 \\), both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are multiples of 13. Therefore, 13 divides both, so \\( d = 13 \\).\n\nIs there a possibility that the gcd could be larger than 13? Since 13 is a prime number, the only divisors are 1 and 13. So, 13 is indeed the maximum possible value.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me take a specific example. Let me choose \\( k = 1 \\), so \\( n = 13 \\times 1 - 7 = 6 \\). \n\nThen, \\( n + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \\), and \\( 2n + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \\). So, \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\). That works.\n\nLet me try another value, \\( k = 2 \\), so \\( n = 26 - 7 = 19 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 19 + 7 = 26 \\), and \\( 2n + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39 \\). Then, \\( \\gcd(26, 39) \\). Let me compute that.\n\n26 and 39. 26 divides into 39 once with a remainder of 13. Then, \\( \\gcd(26, 13) = 13 \\"

Then, \\( n + 7 = 39 \\), and \\( 2n + 1 = 64 + 1 = 65 \\). \\( \\gcd(39, 65) \\). 39 divides into 65 once with remainder 26. Then, \\( \\gcd(39, 26) \\). 26 divides into 39 once with remainder 13. Then, \\( \\gcd(26, 13) = 13 \\). So again, 13.\n\nAnother example for good measure: \\( k = 4 \\), \\( n = 52 - 7 = 45 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 52 \\), \\( 2n + 1 = 90 + 1 = 91 \\). \\( \\gcd(52, 91) \\). 52 divides into 91 once with remainder 39. \\( \\gcd(52, 39) \\). 39 divides into 52 once with remainder 13. \\( \\gcd(39, 13) = 13 \\). Yep, still 13.\n\nAlright, so it seems consistent that when \\( n + 7 \\) is a multiple of 13, the gcd is 13. Since 13 is prime, there can't be a higher common divisor, so 13 is indeed the maximum possible value.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is 13.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is achieved when both expressions share the largest prime divisor, which is 13.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Define the gcd:**\n   Let \\( d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\).\n\n2. **Express the gcd in terms of \\( d \\):**\n   Since \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\), there exist integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   n + 7 = d \\cdot a \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2n + 1 = d \\cdot b"
