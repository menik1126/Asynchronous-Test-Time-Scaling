The direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, direction vectors are about the slope of the line, right? So, if I can figure out the slope of the line in the graph, that should help me find \\( b \\).\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, it seems like there's a line drawn in red from point \\( L \\) to point \\( R \\). Points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) are defined as the intersections of the line \\( AB \\) with the vertical lines \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\), respectively. The points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are given as \\( A = (-5, 4) \\) and \\( B = (-1, 3) \\).\n\nSo, first, I think I need to find the equation of the line \\( AB \\). Since I have two points, \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), I can calculate the slope \\( m \\) of this line. The formula for slope is \\( m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\).\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n\n\\( m = \\frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} \\)\n\\( m = \\frac{-1}{4} \\)\n\\( m = -\\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nSo, the slope of line \\( AB \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\). That means the direction vector of this line can be written as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{4} \\end{pmatrix} \\) because for every 1 unit in the x-direction, it goes down \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) in the y-direction.\n\nBut the problem states that the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, so this vector is just a scalar multiple of the slope vector I found. Direction vectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, so if my direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -"

So, comparing this with my result, \\( b \\) must be \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\). That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) to find the slope. Since \\( L \\) is where line \\( AB \\) intersects \\( x = -8 \\), let me find the coordinates of \\( L \\). Similarly, \\( R \\) is where \\( AB \\) intersects \\( x = 8 \\).\n\nThe line \\( AB \\) can be parameterized, but another way is to write it in point-slope form. Since I have two points, let's write the equation.\n\nUsing point \\( A = (-5, 4) \\), the equation is:\n\n\\( y - 4 = -\\frac{1}{4}(x + 5) \\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{5}{4} + 4 \\)\n\\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{11}{4} \\)\n\nSo, the equation of line \\( AB \\) is \\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{11}{4} \\).\n\nNow, let's find point \\( L \\) which is the intersection with \\( x = -8 \\):\n\nSubstitute \\( x = -8 \\):\n\n\\( y = -\\frac{1}{4}(-8) + \\frac{11}{4} \\)\n\\( y = 2 + \\frac{11}{4} \\)\n\\( y = \\frac{8}{4} + \\frac{11}{4} \\)\n\\( y = \\frac{19}{4}"

If I want this to be a scalar multiple of the given direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), I can see if one is a scalar multiple of the other.\n\nLooking at the x-components: 13 and -7. Let's find the scalar \\( k \\) such that \\( 13 = k \\times (-7) \\). Wait, that would mean \\( k = -\\frac{13}{7} \\).\n\nBut let's check the y-component:\n\n\\( -\\frac{13}{4} = k \\times b \\)\nSo, if \\( k = -\\frac{13}{7} \\), then:\n\n\\( -\\frac{13}{4} = (-\\frac{13}{7}) \\times b \\)\nDivide both sides by \\( -\\frac{13}{7} \\):\n\\( b = (-\\frac{13}{4}) \\div (-\\frac{13}{7}) = \\frac{7}{4} \\)\n\nSo, \\( b \\) is \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\).
