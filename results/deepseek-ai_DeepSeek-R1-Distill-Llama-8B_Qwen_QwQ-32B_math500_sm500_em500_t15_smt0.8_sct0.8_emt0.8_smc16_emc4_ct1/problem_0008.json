Let me break down the given information and figure out how to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that \\( P(x) \\) is a monic polynomial of degree 3, which means its leading coefficient is 1. So, \\( P(x) \\) looks like \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants I need to find.\n\nThe problem states two things about the remainders when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by certain quadratic polynomials:\n\n1. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\).\n2. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\).\n\nAdditionally, we're given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nLet me recall the Remainder Theorem and polynomial division concepts. When a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by a quadratic polynomial like \\( (x - a)(x - b) \\), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) will be of degree less than 2, so it's a linear polynomial, meaning \\( R(x) = mx + n \\) for some constants \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nSince \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, when divided by a quadratic, the quotient will be linear, and the remainder will be linear as mentioned.\n\nGiven that \\( P(x) \\) has remainder \\( R(x) \\) when divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which I'll denote as \\( D_1(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), this implies that:\n\n\\( P(x) = D_1(x) \\cdot Q_1(x) + R(x) \\)\n\nwhere \\( Q_1(x) \\) is the linear quotient.\n\nSimilarly, when divided by \\( D_2(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\):\n\n\\( P"

So, for \\( D_1(x) \\), its roots are 1 and 4. Therefore, \\( P(1) = R(1) \\) and \\( P(4) = R(4) \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( D_2(x) \\), the roots are 2 and 3. Therefore, \\( P(2) = 2R(2) \\) and \\( P(3) = 2R(3) \\).\n\nSince \\( R(x) \\) is a linear polynomial, it can be written as \\( R(x) = kx + m \\) for some constants \\( k \\) and \\( m \\). So, \\( R(1) = k + m \\), \\( R(4) = 4k + m \\), \\( R(2) = 2k + m \\), and \\( R(3) = 3k + m \\).\n\nSo, now I can set up equations:\n\n1. \\( P(1) = R(1) = k + m \\)\n2. \\( P(4) = R(4) = 4k + m \\)\n3. \\( P(2) = 2R(2) = 2(2k + m) = 4k + 2m \\)\n4. \\( P(3) = 2R(3) = 2(3k + m) = 6k + 2m \\"
