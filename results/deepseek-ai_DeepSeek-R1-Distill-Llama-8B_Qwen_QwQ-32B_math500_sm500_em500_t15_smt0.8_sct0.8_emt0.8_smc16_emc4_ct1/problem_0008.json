            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem about polynomials, and I need to find P(5) given some conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so the polynomial should look something like P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants we need to find.\n\nNext, it says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). I remember that when you divide a polynomial by a quadratic, the remainder should be a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) must be of the form mx + n.\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). That also makes sense because the divisor here is also quadratic, so the remainder is linear. So 2R(x) would be 2mx + 2n, but since R(x) is mx + n, I guess it's just double the coefficients.\n\nWe're also given that P(0) = 5. Since P(x) is x³ + ax² + bx + c, plugging in x=0 gives P(0) = c = 5. So c is 5. That's one constant down.\n\nNow, let's think about the division by (x - 1)(x - 4). If we divide P(x) by this quadratic, the remainder R(x) can be expressed as R(x) = P(1) / (1 - 4)x + P(4) / (4 - 1)? Wait, actually, the Remainder Theorem says that the remainder when dividing by (x - k) is P(k). But here, the divisor is a product of two linear terms, so it's a quadratic. So maybe I need to use the Polynomial Remainder Theorem for higher degrees.\n\nYes, the Polynomial Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of dividing by a polynomial D(x) is the sum of P(k) * (x - k)/D'(k) for each root k of D(x). But in this case, D(x) factors into (x - 1)(x - 4), so the roots are 1"

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write R(x) as a linear polynomial, so R(x) = m(x) + n, and since when divided by (x -1)(x -4), the remainder must satisfy R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). Similarly, when divided by (x -2)(x -3), the remainder 2R(x) must satisfy 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3). \n\nAh, that seems better. Let me confirm that. If we have a polynomial P(x) divided by (x - a)(x - b), then the remainder R(x) is a linear polynomial such that R(a) = P(a) and R(b) = P(b). So yes, that's correct. So for the first division, R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4). For the second division, the remainder is 2R(x), so 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3). \n\nSo, let me write down these equations:\n\n1. R(1) = P(1)\n2. R(4) = P(4)\n3. 2R(2) = P(2)\n4. 2R(3) = P(3)\n\nSince R(x) is linear, let me denote R(x) = mx + n. Then:\n\nFrom equation 1: m(1) + n = P(1)\nFrom equation 2: m(4) + n = P(4)\nFrom equation 3: 2(m(2) + n) = P(2)\nFrom equation 4: 2(m(3) + n) = P(3)\n\nNow, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, let's write it as P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + 5 (since c = 5). So we can compute P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) in terms of a and b.\n\nLet me compute each P(k):\n\nP(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = (1 + a + b + 5) = a + b + 6\n\nWait, 1³ is "
