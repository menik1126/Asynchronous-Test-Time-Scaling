            "output": "First, I need to calculate the absolute value of (1 - i) raised to the 8th power. To simplify this, I'll first find the absolute value of (1 - i), which is the square root of (1 squared plus (-1) squared) = sqrt(2).\n\nNext, I'll raise sqrt(2) to the 8th power. This can be done by squaring sqrt(2) four times, since (sqrt(2))^8 = (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of \\((1 - i)^8\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Absolute Value in Complex Numbers**:\n   \n   The absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   |a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the Absolute Value of \\(1 - i\\)**:\n   \n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Raise the Absolute Value to the 8th Power**:\n   \n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{(1/2 \\times 8)} = 2^4 = 16\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = \\boxed{16}\n   \\]"
