The complex number 1 - i has a magnitude of √(1² + (-1)²) = √2 and an angle of -45° or 315°, which is π/4 radians in the fourth quadrant.\n\nNext, I'll raise (1 - i) to the 8th power using De Moivre's Theorem. The magnitude becomes (√2)^8 = (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16. The angle is multiplied by 8, resulting in 8 * (-π/4) = -2π.\n\nSince the angle is coterminal with 0° after adding 2π (which doesn't change the magnitude), the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(| (1 - i)^8 |\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Number \\(1 - i\\):**\n   - The complex number \\(1 - i\\) can be represented in polar form.\n   - **Magnitude:** \\( |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n   - **Angle:** Since \\(1 - i\\) lies in the fourth quadrant, the angle \\(\\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) or \\(315^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Raise to the 8th Power Using De Moivre's Theorem:**\n   - **Magnitude becomes:** \\( (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16 \\)\n   - **Angle becomes:** \\( 8 \\times (-\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = -2\\pi \\)\n\n3. **Find the Absolute Value:**\n   - Since the angle is coterminal with \\(0\\) after adding \\(2\\pi\\), the absolute value is simply the magnitude.\n   - \\( |(1 - i)^8| = 16 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
