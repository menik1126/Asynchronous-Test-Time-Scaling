A is directly north of O, so that would be straight up along the y-axis. B is directly west of O, so that's along the negative x-axis. C is directly south of O, so along the negative y-axis, and D is directly east of O, along the positive x-axis. So, forming a kind of cross with O in the center.\n\nNow, there's a hot-air balloon at point H, which is directly above O. So, H is somewhere along the vertical line passing through O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. Rope HC has a length of 150 meters, and HD has 130 meters. The problem says that to reduce the total rope length, we can replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. We need to find the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this.\n\nSo, the goal is to figure out the maximum possible reduction in the total rope length by substituting these two ropes with a single one. To do this, I think I need to model the problem mathematically.\n\nLet me start by setting up a coordinate system. Let's place O at the origin (0,0). Then, since A is directly north, it's at (0, a) for some a. Similarly, B is directly west, so at (-b, 0), C is directly south at (0, -c), and D is directly east at (d, 0). But wait, the problem says the distance between C and D is 140 meters. So, the distance between (0, -c) and (d, 0) is 140 m.\n\nLet me write that as an equation. The distance between C and D is sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2) = sqrt(d^2 + c^2) = 140. So, d^2 + c^2 = 140^2 = 19600.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, A is directly north of O, so A is at (0, a), and similarly, D is"

But since the Asy code shows H connected to O, which is the center, so H is vertically above O, so coordinates (0,0,h).\n\nThe ropes HA, HB, HC, HD are all connecting H to those points. The lengths given are HC = 150 m and HD = 130 m. So, let's model these ropes.\n\nFirst, HC is the rope from H to point C, which is at (0, -c, 0) if we consider 3D coordinates, but since everything is in a flat field except H, which is above O, so H is (0,0,h). So, the coordinates: H is (0,0,h), C is (0, -c, 0), D is (d, 0, 0). Wait, actually, maybe I should model this in 3D? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since all the points except H are on the ground (the xy-plane), and H is above O, so coordinates:\n\n- O is (0, 0, 0)\n- A is (0, some coordinate north, but actually, in 2D it's along the y-axis. Hmm, perhaps in 2D first. Maybe easier.\n\nWait, actually, since the problem mentions distance between C and D, which are on different axes, so maybe in a 2D plane. But the balloon is in 3D, so HA is a rope from H to A, but H is above O. So, maybe it's better to model the ground (points A,B,C,D,O) on the 2D plane (xy-plane), with O at (0,0), and H is at (0,0,h). So:\n\nCoordinates:\n\n- O: (0,0,0)\n- A: (0, a, 0) [directly north, so along y-axis]\n- B: (-b, 0, 0) [directly west, along negative x-axis]\n- C: (0, -c, 0) [directly south]\n- D: (d, 0, 0) [directly east]\n\nH is at (0,0,h) above O.\n\nSo"

So, point P lies on the line segment connecting C and D, which we can parametrize.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible reduction in the total rope length by substituting HP for HC and HD. The current total length for HC and HD is 150 + 130 = 280 m. The new rope HP will have some length, say L. So, the saved length is 280 - L.
