Let me start by understanding what the equation is asking. It's an exponential equation with different bases on each side, which can be a bit challenging, but maybe I can find a substitution that makes it easier.\n\nFirst, I notice that 3^{2x} can be written as (3^2)^x, right? Because when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, which is 9^x. So that simplifies the left side of the equation a bit. Let me rewrite the equation:\n\n9^x + 19 = 10^x.\n\nOkay, so now I have 9^x plus 19 equals 10^x. That doesn't immediately look like something I can solve algebraically because the bases are different. I remember that sometimes these kinds of equations can be solved by taking logarithms, but I'm not sure how to apply that here because of the addition of 19.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when you have an equation like a^x + b = c^x, you can try substituting t = a^x or t = c^x and see if that helps. Since 9^x and 10^x are both exponential functions, maybe that substitution can simplify things.\n\nLet me try letting t = 9^x. Then, 10^x can be expressed using t somehow. Hmm, 10^x is actually (10^{log_10(9)})^x, because 10^x can be rewritten with base 9. Wait, log_10(9) is a constant, so that might not be helpful directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express 10^x in terms of 9^x. Let me see, since 10 is 9 + 1, maybe 10^x is related to that, but I don't see an immediate way to express it as a power of 9.\n\nAnother approach: sometimes equations like this can have integer solutions, so maybe I can test some small integer values of x to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet me try x = 1 first. Plugging in:\n\n9^"

Since exponential functions can sometimes cross each other more than once.\n\nLet me consider the function f(x) = 9^x +19 -10^x. We want to find x where f(x)=0.\n\nWe know f(2)=0. Let's see the behavior as x approaches infinity and negative infinity.\n\nAs x approaches infinity: 9^x grows exponentially, but 10^x grows faster since 10>9. So 10^x will dominate, so 9^x +19 -10^x tends to negative infinity.\n\nAs x approaches negative infinity: 9^x approaches 0, 10^x also approaches 0, so f(x) approaches 0 +19 -0 =19. So f(x) approaches 19.\n\nSo the function goes from 19 at negative infinity, comes down, crosses zero at x=2, and then goes to negative infinity as x increases. Wait, but maybe there's another crossing?\n\nWait, let's check between x=0 and x=2. Let's see f(1)=28-10=18, which is positive. At x"

So it's decreasing the whole time, from x=0 to x=2.\n\nWhat about x=3? We had 748-1000=-252. So between x=2 and x=3, the function goes from 0 to -252. So it's decreasing all the way. What about to the left of x=2, say x=1.5?\n\nLet me compute f(1.5):\n\n9^{1.5} is sqrt(9^3)=sqrt(729)=27. So 27 +19=46. 10^{1.5}=sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)\u224831.62. So f(1.5)=46 -31.62\u224814.38, which is positive.\n\nSo between x=1.5 and x=2, the function goes from ~14.38 to 0.

Let me compute 1.95 * ln10=1.95*2.3026\u22484.484. e^4.484\u2248 83. So 10^{1.95}\u224883. So f(1.95)=93.5 -83\u224810.5. Wait, that's still positive. Hmm, but at x=2, it's zero.

So the function is decreasing from 19 to negative infinity, but does it cross zero only once?\n\nWait, but when x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches 19, so it's positive. At x=2, it's zero. So between negative infinity and x=2, the function goes from 19 down to zero. So it's decreasing all the way? If that's the case, then there's only one solution at x=2.\n\nWait, but let me check at x=0, f(0)=1+19-1=19, which is the same as the limit as x approaches -infty. Wait, but at x=0, it's 19, and at x=1, it's 9+19-10=18, so it's decreasing from x=0 to x=2. So the function is always decreasing from x=-infty to x=2, then continues decreasing beyond x=2. Wait, but if it's always decreasing, then there can only be one point where it crosses zero, which is at x=2. So that would mean x=2 is the only solution.\n\nBut let me check another point, like x= -1. Let's see f(-1)=9^{-1} +19 -10^{-1}= (1/9)+19 - (1/10)\u22480.111 +19 -0.1\u224819.011. So still positive. So yes, the function is decreasing from 19 down to zero at x=2, then continues decreasing. So only one solution at x=2.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2. Wait, but let me confirm once more. Let me try x=3, which gives 9^3 +19=729+19=748, and 10^3=1000, so 748-1000 is negative. So yes, after x=2, it's negative. Before x=2"
