Specifically, there are 21 multiples of 2 and 8 multiples of 5.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of times 10 is a factor by taking the minimum of the counts of 2 and 5.\n\nSince there are only 8 fives, that determines the number of trailing zeros in 42!.\n\nTherefore, 42! has 8 trailing zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the multiples of 5 between 1 and 42:**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   So, there are 8 multiples of 5 in this range.\n\n2. **Sum the multiples of 25, 125, etc., to account for additional factors of 5:**\n   - \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\)\n   - Higher powers of 5 (like 125) exceed 42, so they don't contribute additional factors.\n\n3. **Total number of factors of 5:**\n   \\[\n   8 + 1 = 9\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of factors of 5.**\n   \nTherefore, \\(42!\\) has \\(\\boxed{8}\\) trailing zeros."

Let me check that again. \n\nWait, in step 3, I added 8 and 1 to get 9, but actually, the total number of factors of 5 is calculated by adding the counts from each step. The first step gives 8 multiples of 5, and the second step gives 1 multiple of 25 (which contributes an extra 5). So total factors of 5 are 8 + 1 = 9. But the initial reasoning said 8. Hmm, so there's a mistake here. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, the user's original thought process had an error here. Let me redo the correct steps properly.\n\nCorrect steps:\n\n1. **Count the number of multiples of 5 in 1 to 42:**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Count the number of multiples of 25 (since each contributes an extra 5):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Count the number of multiples of 125 (but 125 > 42, so this is 0):**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Sum these counts to get the total number of factors of 5:**\n   \\[\n   8 + 1 + 0 = 9\n   \\]\n   \nHowever, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s. Since there are more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of 5s, which is 9. Wait, but the user's original answer was 8. So there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the actual calculation again.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step again:\n\nMultiples of 5 between 1-42: 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40. That's 8 numbers.
