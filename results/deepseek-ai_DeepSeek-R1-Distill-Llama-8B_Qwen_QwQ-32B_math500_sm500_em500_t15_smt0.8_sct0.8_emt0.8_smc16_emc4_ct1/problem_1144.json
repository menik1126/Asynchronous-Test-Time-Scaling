Multiplying the terms gives me \\(ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24\\).\n\nNext, I'll compare this with the original quadratic expression \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\). By equating the coefficients, I find that \\(AB = 10\\) and \\(3A - 8B = -1\\).\n\nI'll solve the first equation \\(AB = 10\\) for integer factors of 10. The possible pairs for (A, B) are (1, 10), (2, 5), (5, 2), and (10, 1).\n\nFor each pair, I'll check the second equation \\(3A - 8B = -1\\):\n- For (2, 5): \\(3*2 - 8*5 = 6 - 40 = -34\\) which is not equal to -1.\n- For (5, 2): \\(3*5 - 8*2 = 15 - 16 = -1\\) which satisfies the equation.\n\nThus, the valid pair is (A, B) = (5, 2). Therefore, \\(AB + B = 5*2 + 2 = 12\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand the Expression**:\n   \\[\n   (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = ABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set Up Equations by Comparing Coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(x^2\\) in both expressions must be equal:\n     \\[\n     AB = 10\n     \\]\n   - The coefficient of \\(x\\) must also be equal:\n     \\[\n     3A - 8B = -1\n     \\]]\n\n3. **Find Integer Solutions for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)**:\n   - From \\(AB = 10\\), possible integer pairs \\((A, B)\\) are:\n     \\[\n     (1, 10), (2, 5), (5, 2), (10, 1)\n     \\]\n   - Test each pair in \\(3A - 8B = -1\\):\n     -"
