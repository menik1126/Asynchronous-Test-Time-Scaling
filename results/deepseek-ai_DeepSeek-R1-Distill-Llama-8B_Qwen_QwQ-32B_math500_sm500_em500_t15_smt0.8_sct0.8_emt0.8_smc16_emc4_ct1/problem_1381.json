The matrix M transforms the point (2, -1) to (9, 3) and (1, -3) to (7, -1). Then, I need to figure out where the line y = 2x + 1 gets mapped by this matrix M. Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that transforming a point with a matrix involves matrix multiplication. So, if I can represent the line in terms of parametric equations or figure out specific points on the line, I can apply the matrix M to them and then determine the image of the entire line.\n\nBut wait, the line is given as y = 2x + 1, which is a straight line in slope-intercept form. I think a good approach might be to find two points on this line and then apply the matrix transformation to both of those points. After that, I can find the equation of the line passing through the transformed points, which will be the image of the original line under M.\n\nAlright, so let me pick two points on y = 2x + 1. Choosing x = 0 and x = 1 seems straightforward because they'll give me easy points.\n\nWhen x = 0:\ny = 2(0) + 1 = 1\nSo, the point is (0, 1).\n\nWhen x = 1:\ny = 2(1) + 1 = 3\nSo, the point is (1, 3).\n\nGreat, now I have two points on the original line: (0, 1) and (1, 3). Next, I need to apply the matrix M to each of these points.\n\nBut wait, I don't have the matrix M directly. The problem says M transforms (2, -1) to (9, 3) and (1, -3) to (7, -1). So, I need to figure out what matrix M does to these vectors. Since M is a linear transformation, it can be represented as a 2x2 matrix, and matrix multiplication can be used to find its effect on any vector.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [ [a, b],\n       [c, d] ]\n\nSo, when M is multiplied by"

Let me clarify:\n\nWait, actually, the first row equations are from the first transformation (the vector [2, -1] being transformed to [9, 3]). The second row equations are from the second transformation (vector [1, -3] to [7, -1]). Wait, no, actually, the first row equations are for the first component of the transformed vectors. Let me rephrase.\n\nThe first equation for the first row (a and b):\n\n2a - b = 9 (from the first transformation's x-component)\nSimilarly, the second equation for the first row comes from the second transformation's x-component:\n\n1a - 3b = 7 (since the second vector [1, -3] is transformed to [7, -1], so the x-component is 7)\n\nSo, the first row variables a and b are determined by:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\n\nEquation 2: a - 3b = 7\n\nSimilarly, for the second row (c and d):\n\nFrom the first transformation's y-component: 2c - d = 3\n\nFrom the second transformation's y-component: 1c - 3d = -1\n\nSo, equations for c and d:\n\nEquation 3: 2c - d = 3\n\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nAlright, so now I need to solve these two systems of equations.\n\nStarting with the first system (a and b"

Alternatively, maybe I can represent the line in parametric form and then transform each parameter.\n\nWait, another method I can think of is to express the line y = 2x + 1 in parametric terms. Let me try that.\n\nLet me let x = t, then y = 2t +1.\n\nSo, any point on the line can be written as (t, 2t +1). Then, to find the image, I can write the transformation of this parametric equation under M.\n\nGiven that M is the matrix [4, -1; 2, 1], then the transformation of a point (t, 2t +1) would be:\n\nx' = 4*t + (-1)*(2t +1) = 4t - 2t -1 = 2t -1\n\ny' = 2*t + 1*(2t +1) = 2t + 2t +1 = 4t +1\n\nSo, the parametric equations for the image are:\n\nx' = 2t -1\n\ny' = 4t +1\n\nNow, we can express this as a linear relationship between y' and x'.\n\nFrom the parametric equations, we can solve for t in terms of x':\n\nx' = 2t -1 => x' +1 = 2t => t = (x' +1)/2\n\nPlug into y':\n\ny' = 4*( (x' +1)/2 ) +1 ="

So, the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M is y = 2x +3. Wait, but let me check again with another point to be sure.\n\nTake another point on the original line, say x = 2. Then y = 2*2 +1 =5, so the point (2,5). Let's apply M to this point.\n\nM*(2,5) = [4*2 + (-1)*5, 2*2 +1*5] = [8 -5, 4 +5] = [3,9]\n\nNow, plug into the equation y = 2x +3. If x =3, then y should be 2*3 +3 =9. Which matches. So that's good.\n\nAnother point: x = -1 on the original line. Then y =2*(-1)+1 = -2 +1 = -1. So the point (-1, -1). Applying M:\n\nM*(-1, -1) = [4*(-1) + (-1)*(-1), 2*(-1) +1*(-1)] = [-4 +1, -2 -1] = [-3, -3]\n\nNow, plug into y =2x +3. If x = -3, then y =2*(-3)+3 =-6 +3 =-3. Which matches. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the image of the line is indeed y =2x +3.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M\". Since linear transformations can sometimes shift the line, but since M is a linear transformation (not affine), but wait, actually, hold on. Wait, is M a linear transformation or an affine transformation?\n\nWait, matrices represent linear transformations, which do not include translations. However, the original line is y =2x +1, which is not a subspace (since it doesn't pass through the origin). Therefore, when applying a linear transformation, the image of the line will also be a line, but the intercept might change. However,"

            "output": " in this case, we have computed it step by step, and with the parametric approach, and both times the result came out as y=2x+3. Also, testing with another point on the original line, it maps correctly. So, probably correct.\n\nWait another thought: since M is a linear transformation, it can't map a line to a line unless it's affine, but linear transformations map lines to lines, but since the original line doesn't pass through the origin, the image won't pass through the origin either, but the slope will be preserved if the matrix doesn't scale it.\n\nWait, let me think about the determinant to see if the matrix scales areas. The determinant of M is (4)(1) - (-1)(2) =4 +2=6. So, M scales areas by a factor of 6, which means the image of the line will have a slope that's stretched accordingly. Wait, but in our calculation, the slope remained the same (2). Hmm, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps because the line is not a vector, but a set of points, which can be mapped to another line regardless of the scaling. Yeah, I think so. So, even though the matrix scales areas, the slope of the line remains the same because both the direction vectors are scaled by the same factor.\n\nWait, in our parametric approach, when we expressed the line as (t, 2t +1), then after applying M, we got (2t -1, 4t +1). So, the direction vector before was (1,2), and after is (2,4), which is just 2*(1,2). So, the direction is scaled by 2, but the slope remains 2 because both x' and y' are scaled by 2 and 4 respectively, which keeps the ratio the same.\n\nSo, that makes sense. Therefore, the image line will have the same slope, but different intercept.\n\nSo, all the checks I did seem to confirm that y=2x +3 is the correct image.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1.
