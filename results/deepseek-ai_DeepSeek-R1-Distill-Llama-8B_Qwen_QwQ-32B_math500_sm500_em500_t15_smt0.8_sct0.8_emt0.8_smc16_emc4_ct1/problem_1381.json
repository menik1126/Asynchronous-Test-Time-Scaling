I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this matrix M. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a matrix transforms a vector, it kind of \"moves\" it around according to the matrix rules. So, if I can express the line y = 2x + 1 in terms of vectors, maybe I can apply the matrix M to those vectors and see what happens.\n\nBut wait, the line itself isn't a single point, so I can't directly apply the matrix to it. Maybe I should think about how the matrix affects points on the line. Let me see, for any point (x, y) on the line, y = 2x + 1. So, if I take a general point (t, 2t + 1) where t is any real number, that point lies on the line.\n\nNow, I need to apply the matrix M to this vector (t, 2t + 1). But to do that, I should probably know what M is. The problem gives me two specific transformations: M takes (2, -1) to (9, 3), and (1, -3) to (7, -1). Hmm, so maybe M is a 2x2 matrix, and these are two column vectors that it transforms.\n\nYes, so if I denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nThen, applying M to the vector (2, -1) should give (9, 3). So, the equation would be:\n\n[a*2 + b*(-1)] = 9\n[c*2 + d*(-1)] = 3\n\nSimilarly, applying M to (1, -3) gives (7, -1), so:\n\n[a*1 + b*(-3)] = 7\n[c*1 + d*(-3)] = -1\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nNow I need to solve these four equations to find a, b, c, d. Let's see"

Let's use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3 to get:\n\n6a - 3b = 27\n\nThen subtract equation 3 from that:\n\n(6a - 3b) - (a - 3b) = 27 - 7\n\n6a - 3b - a + 3b = 20\n\n5a = 20 => a = 4\n\nThen plug back into equation 1: 2*4 - b = 9 => 8 - b =9 => -b =1 => b = -1\n\nOkay, so a =4, b = -1.\n\nNow for equations 2 and 4:\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d = 3\n\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nAgain, let's use elimination. Let's solve for c and d.\n\nLet me multiply equation 4 by 2 to get:\n\n2c - 6d = -2\n\nNow subtract equation 2 from this:\n\n(2c -6d) - (2c - d) = -2 -3\n\n2c -6d -2c +d = -5\n\n-5d = -5 => d =1\n\nThen plug back into equation 2: 2c -1 =3 => 2c =4 => c=2\n\nSo c=2, d=1.\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n\n[4   -1]\n[2    1]\n\nLet me verify this with the given vectors.\n\nFirst, check (2, -1):\n\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1) = 8 +1 =9 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2*2 +1*(-1)=4 -1=3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond, check (1, -3):\n\n4*1 + (-1)*(-3)=4 +3=7 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2*1 +1*(-3)=2-3=-1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect"

So, first, let me express the line in terms of vectors.\n\nThe line y=2x+1 can be parametrized as:\n\nx = t\n\ny = 2t +1\n\nSo, a general point on the line is (t, 2t +1). Let me denote this vector as v(t) = [t; 2t +1].\n\nNow, to find the image of the line under M, I need to apply M to each vector v(t). So, M*v(t) = [4t -1; 2t +1]. Hmm, is that right?\n\nWait, let's calculate M * [t; 2t +1]:\n\nFirst component: 4*t + (-1)*(2t +1) =4t -2t -1=2t -1\n\nSecond component: 2*t +1*(2t +1)=2t +2t +1=4t +1\n\nSo, M*v(t)= [2t -1; 4t +1]\n\nTherefore, the image is the set of points (2t -1, 4t +1) for all t in R.\n\nNow, I need to express this image as a line in the form y= mx +b.\n\nLooking at the parametric equations:\n\nx =2t -1\n\ny=4t +1\n\nLet me solve for t from the x equation.\n\nFrom x =2t -1,\n\nx +1 = 2t => t=(x +1)/2\n\nNow plug this into y:\n\ny=4*( (x+1)/2 ) +1 = 2(x +1) +1=2x +2 +1=2x +3\n\nSo, the image of the line is y=2x +3.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I did the transformation M*v(t), I used M as [4 -1; 2 1] and v(t) as [t; 2t +1]. So, first component: 4*t -1*(2t +1)=4t -2t -1=2t -1. Second component: 2*t +1*(2t +1)=2t"

Substitute into y: 4*( (x+1)/2 ) +1 = 2(x+1) +1 = 2x +2 +1 =2x+3. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the image is y=2x+3. Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the transformation of the line equation directly. Since lines are transformed by linear transformations, but since the original line is affine (has a constant term), the image will also be an affine line. The matrix M is linear, but since the line is affine, the image will also be affine. So, perhaps another way is to consider the direction vector of the original line and the point on the line, then transform them.\n\nThe original line y=2x+1 has direction vector. Since the slope is 2, direction vector can be (1,2). Also, a point on the line is when x=0, so (0,1).\n\nSo, the direction vector (1,2) is transformed by M, and the point (0,1) is transformed by M. Then the image line will have direction vector M*(1,2) and pass through M*(0,1).\n\nLet me try this method to confirm.\n\nFirst, compute M*(1,2):\n\nM is [4 -1; 2 1], so:\n\nFirst component:4*1 + (-1)*2 =4-2=2\n\nSecond component:2*1 +1*2=2+2=4\n\nSo direction vector becomes (2,4). The direction vector of the image line is (2,4), which has slope 4/2=2. So the slope of the image line is 2, which matches the previous result.\n\nNow, the point (0,1) on the original line is transformed by M:\n\nM*(0,1) = [4*0 + (-1)*1; 2*0 +1*1] = [-1;1]. So the point (-1,1) is on the image line.\n\nTherefore, the image line has slope 2 and passes through"

So, definitely, the image is y=2x +3.\n\nI think that's thorough. So, overall, M transforms the line y=2x +1 to y=2x +3.\n</think>\n\nThe matrix M is found to be:\n\\[ M = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -1 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nWhen transforming the line \\( y = 2x + 1 \\), we represent a general point on the line as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} t \\\\ 2t + 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).
