It states that half of the value of \\(3x - 9\\) is equal to \\(x + 37\\).\n\nI'll start by using the division property of equality to isolate \\(3x - 9\\). This means I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2.\n\nAfter simplifying, I'll have the equation \\(3x - 9 = 2x + 74\\).\n\nNext, I'll subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get all the \\(x\\) terms on one side. This results in \\(x - 9 = 74\\).\n\nThen, I'll add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\), which gives me \\(x = 83\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37 \\]\n\n**Step 1: Eliminate the fraction**\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction.\n\\[ 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\cdot (x + 37) \\]\n\\[ (3x - 9) = 2x + 74 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Combine like terms**\nSubtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to gather like terms.\n\\[ (3x - 2x) - 9 = 74 \\]\n\\[ x - 9 = 74 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\(x\\)**\nAdd 9 to both sides to isolate \\(x\\).\n\\[ x - 9 + 9 = 74 + 9 \\]\n\\[ x = 83 \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[ \\boxed{83} \\]"
