            "output": "I need to determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys from his 7 and 2 girls from his 4. Since the order doesn't matter, this is a combination problem.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the boys. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!). So, for the boys, that's C(7,3).\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the girls using the same formula. That's C(4,2).\n\nAfter I have both values, I'll multiply them together to get the total number of ways to pick the group. This is because for each way of choosing the boys, there are multiple ways to choose the girls.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll use the concept of combinations. The order in which the boys and girls are selected does not matter, so we'll calculate the combinations separately for boys and girls and then multiply the results.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7.**\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}\n\\]\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4.**\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!}\n\\]\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two combinations to get the total number of ways.**\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
