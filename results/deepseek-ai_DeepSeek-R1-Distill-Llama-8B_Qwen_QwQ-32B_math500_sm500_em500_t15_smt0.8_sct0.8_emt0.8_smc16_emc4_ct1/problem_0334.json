Since the order doesn't matter, I'll use the combination formula.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where \"n!\" denotes the factorial of n. Plugging in the numbers, C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!).\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from the 4 available. Using the same combination formula, C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!).\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to pick both the boys and the girls, I'll multiply the results from the two calculations. This is because for each way of choosing the boys, there are multiple ways to choose the girls.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his statistics class, we'll use combinations since the order of selection does not matter.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7.**\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4.**\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two results to find the total number of ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls.**\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
