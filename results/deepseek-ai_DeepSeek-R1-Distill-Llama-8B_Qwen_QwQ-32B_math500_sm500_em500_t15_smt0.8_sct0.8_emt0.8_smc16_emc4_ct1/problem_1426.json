For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n \\)-th power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\). This means that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nNext, I'll list all the positive divisors of 24. The number 24 can be factored into primes as \\( 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\). Using the formula for the number of divisors, the total number of divisors is \\( (3 + 1) \\times (1 + 1) = 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\). These divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that \\( n > 1 \\), so I'll exclude 1 from the list. This leaves us with 7 possible values for \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)-th power for 7 different positive integers \\( n > 1 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nA number \\( A \\) is said to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( A = k^n \\). In this case, \\( A = 2^{24} \\). We need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which such a \\( k \\) exists.\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization\nFirst, note that \\( 2^{24} \\) is already in its prime factorized form:\n\\[ 2^{24} = 2^{24} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Possible"
