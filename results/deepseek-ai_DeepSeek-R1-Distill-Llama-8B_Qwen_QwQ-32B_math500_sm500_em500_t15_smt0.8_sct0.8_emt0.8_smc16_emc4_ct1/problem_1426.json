A perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power is a number that can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nGiven \\( 2^{24} \\), I notice that the exponent 24 can be broken down into its prime factors. The prime factorization of 24 is \\( 24 = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\).\n\nFor \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent in its prime factorization must be divisible by \\( n \\). Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nNext, I list all the divisors of 24. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. However, since \\( n > 1 \\), I exclude 1 from the list.\n\nThis leaves the possible values of \\( n \\) as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Counting these, there are 7 possible values of \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) make \\( 2^{24} \\) a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we can analyze the prime factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\).\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   \\[\n   2^{24} = 2^{24}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of 2 in the prime factorization is 24.\n\n2. **Understanding Perfect Powers**:\n   A number is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if its prime factors have exponents that are multiples of \\( n \\). For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, **24** must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Finding Divisors of 24**:\n   The divisors of 24 are all positive integers \\( n \\)"
