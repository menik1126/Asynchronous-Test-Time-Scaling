            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the quotient when the polynomial \\(x^6 - 3\\) is divided by \\(x + 1\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you divide one polynomial by another, you can use polynomial long division or synthetic division if the divisor is of the form \\(x - a\\). Wait, in this case, the divisor is \\(x + 1\\), which can be rewritten as \\(x - (-1)\\), so maybe synthetic division is applicable here.\n\nSynthetic division is a shortcut method for polynomial division when dividing by a linear factor. It's usually faster and less error-prone than setting up the entire long division. Let me recall how synthetic division works. You use the coefficients of the dividend polynomial and the value of the root corresponding to the divisor. For each step, you bring down the leading coefficient, multiply it by the root, add it to the next coefficient, and repeat this process. The result is the coefficients of the quotient polynomial, and the last number is the remainder.\n\nBut before I can proceed, I need to know the coefficients of the dividend polynomial \\(x^6 - 3\\). Let me write out the polynomial in standard form. \\(x^6\\) has a coefficient of 1 for \\(x^6\\), and the constant term is -3. However, when we perform synthetic division, we need all the coefficients, including the ones with zero exponents. Since the given polynomial is \\(x^6\\), it means that the exponents of \\(x^5\\) down to \\(x^1\\) are all zero. So, the polynomial can be written as:\n\n\\(x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nNow, the divisor is \\(x + 1\\), which corresponds to the root \\(a = -1\\). That's the value we'll use in synthetic division.\n\nLet me set up the synthetic division:\n\n- The root \\(a = -1\\)\n- The coefficients: 1 (for \\(x^6\\)), 0 (for \\(x^5\\)), 0 (for \\(x^4\\)), 0 (for \\(x"

Add this to the next coefficient (0) to get 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nTake that -1 and multiply by the root (-1) again: (-1)*(-1)=1. Add this to the next coefficient (0) to get 0 +1 =1.\n\nNext, take that 1 and multiply by -1: 1*(-1)= -1. Add to the next coefficient (0): 0 + (-1)= -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1 gives 1. Add to next coefficient (0): 0 +1=1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1 gives -1. Add to next coefficient (0): 0 + (-1)= -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1 gives 1. Add to the last coefficient (-3): -3 +1 = -2.\n\nSo the bottom row of coefficients is 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, and the remainder is -2.\n\nWait, but the remainder is the last number, which is -2. The question asks for the quotient, so the coefficients of the quotient polynomial are the first six numbers: 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1. The degree of the quotient should be one less than the dividend, so since the dividend is degree 6, the quotient is degree 5. Therefore, the quotient polynomial is:\n\n\\(x"

Add to the next 0: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\n-1 times -1 is 1. Add to the next 0: 0 +1=1.\n\n1 times -1=-1. Add to the next 0: 0 + (-1)= -1.\n\n-1 times -1=1. Add to the next 0: 0 +1=1.\n\n1 times -1=-1. Add to the next 0: 0 + (-1)= -1.\n\n-1 times -1=1. Add to -3: -3 +1= -2.\n\nSo the coefficients are:\n\n1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, and a remainder of -2.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the quotient polynomial is \\(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1\\) and the remainder is -2.\n\nWait, but the problem just asks for the quotient. So the answer is \\(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1\\). But sometimes, the quotient is expressed with the remainder as a separate term, but here the problem says \"the quotient when divided,\" so I think just the polynomial part is needed.\n\nAlternatively, I could express it as:\n\n\\(x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1\\) with a remainder of -2, but since the question is phrased as \"the quotient,\" perhaps only the polynomial part is required.\n\nAlternatively, if writing in fraction form, it's \\(\\frac{x^6 -3}{x +1} = x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 - \\frac{2}{x +1}\\), but I don't think that's what is being asked here.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the quotient when \\(x^6 - 3\\) is divided by"

So the answer should be the polynomial \\(x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check my answer by multiplying the quotient by \\(x +1\\) and adding the remainder to see if I get back the original polynomial.\n\nLet me do that to verify.\n\nMultiply the quotient \\(x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1\\) by \\(x +1\\):\n\nFirst, multiply each term by x:\n\n\\(x^6 -x^5 +x^4 -x^3 +x^2 -x\\)\n\nThen multiply each term by 1:\n\n\\(x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1\\)\n\nNow add those two results together:\n\n\\(x^6 -x^5 +x^4 -x^3 +x^2 -x\\)\n\n+ \\(x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(x^6\\)\n\n- (-x^5 +x^5) = 0\n\n- (x^4 -x^4) = 0\n\n- (-x^3 +x^3) =0\n\n- (x^2 -x^2)=0\n\n- (-x +x)=0\n\n- The remaining terms are -1.\n\nSo the total is \\(x^6 -1\\). Wait, but the original polynomial is \\(x^6 -3\\). Hmm, that's a problem. There's a discrepancy here. The remainder was supposed to be -2, so adding the remainder of -2 would give \\(x^6 -1 -2 =x^6 -3\\), which matches the original polynomial. So that works out.\n\nWait, so when I multiplied the quotient by the divisor and added the remainder, I get back the original polynomial. Let me confirm:\n\nQuotient * (x +1) + remainder = (quotient * (x+1)) + (-2) = (x^6 -1) + (-2) = x^6 -3, which is correct. So that checks out. Therefore, my synthetic division was done correctly.\n\nTherefore, the quotient is indeed \\(x^5 -"

So, set up the division:\n\nDividend: \\(x^6 + 0x^5 +0x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x -3\\)\n\nDivisor: \\(x +1\\)\n\nWe need to find Q(x) and R such that \\(x^6 -3 = (x +1)Q(x) + R\\), where degree R < degree(x +1) which is 1, so R is a constant.\n\nStart by dividing the leading term of the dividend, \\(x^6\\), by the leading term of the divisor, \\(x\\), which gives \\(x^5\\). That's the first term of the quotient.\n\nMultiply \\(x +1\\) by \\(x^5\\): \\(x^6 +x^5\\).\n\nSubtract this from the dividend:\n\n\\(x^6 +0x^5 +0x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x -3\\)\n\n- \\(x^6 +x^5 +0x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x +0\\)\n\n= \\(0x^6 -x^5 +0x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x -3\\).\n\nBring down the next terms, but they are all zero, so the next term to consider is -x^5.\n\nDivide -x^5 by x, giving -x^4. That's the next term of the quotient.\n\nMultiply \\(x +1\\) by -x^4: -x^5 -x^4.\n\nSubtract this from the current dividend:\n\n(-x^5 +0x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x -3)\n\n- (-x^5 -x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x +0)\n\n= 0x^5 +x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x -3.\n\nNext, divide x^4 by x, giving x^3.
