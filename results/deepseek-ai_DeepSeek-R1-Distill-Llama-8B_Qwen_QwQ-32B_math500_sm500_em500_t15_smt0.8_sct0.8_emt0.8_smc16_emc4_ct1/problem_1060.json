            "output": "I need to determine the length of each side of a regular octagon when its perimeter is equal to that of a given regular hexagon. \n\nFirst, I'll calculate the perimeter of the hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, and a hexagon has six sides, the perimeter is 16 cm multiplied by 6.\n\nNext, I'll find the perimeter of the octagon. A regular octagon has eight sides, so if I denote each side of the octagon as 's', the perimeter will be 8 times 's'.\n\nSince the perimeters are equal, I can set up the equation 8s = 16 * 6. Solving for 's' will give me the length of each side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   - The hexagon has **6 sides**, each measuring **16 cm**.\n   - **Perimeter of Hexagon** = Number of sides \u00d7 Side length\n   - Perimeter = 6 \u00d7 16 cm = **96 cm**\n\n2. **Find the Perimeter of the Octagon:**\n   - The octagon has **8 sides**, and let each side be of length **\\( s \\) cm**.\n   - **Perimeter of Octagon** = Number of sides \u00d7 Side length\n   - Perimeter = 8 \u00d7 \\( s \\) cm\n\n3. **Set the Perimeters Equal and Solve for \\( s \\):**\n   - Since the perimeters are equal,\n     \\[\n     8s = 96\n     \\]\n   - **Solve for \\( s \\):**\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe length of each side of the octagon is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) cm."
