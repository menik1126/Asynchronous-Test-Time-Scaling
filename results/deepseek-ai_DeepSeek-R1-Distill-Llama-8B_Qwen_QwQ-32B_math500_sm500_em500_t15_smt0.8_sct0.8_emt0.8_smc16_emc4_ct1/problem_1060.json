So, I'll multiply the side length by 6.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the perimeter of the regular octagon. Since all sides of a regular octagon are equal, I'll divide the total perimeter of the hexagon by 8 to find the length of one side of the octagon.\n\nFinally, I'll present the computed side length of the octagon in centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6** equal sides.\n   - Given that each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   - \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the perimeter of the regular octagon.**\n   \n   - The problem states that the perimeter of the octagon is equal to that of the hexagon.\n   - \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the length of one side of the regular octagon.**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8** equal sides.\n   - \\[\n     \\text{Length of one side of octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{8} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
