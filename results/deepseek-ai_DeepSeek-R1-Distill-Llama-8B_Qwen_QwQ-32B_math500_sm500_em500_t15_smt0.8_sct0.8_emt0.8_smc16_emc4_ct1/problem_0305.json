Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I should probably factor the denominator to find those x-values.\n\nThe denominator is x² - 5x -14. Let me try factoring that. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see: 2 and -7. Yes, because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. So, the denominator factors into (x + 2)(x - 7). \n\nSo, the denominator is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x - 7 = 0, which means x = -2 and x = 7. Since the numerator at those points is 2*(-2) = -4 and 2*7 = 14, neither is zero. Therefore, these are vertical asymptotes. So, vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. Therefore, a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nWait, hold on, the problem says vertical asymptotes at x = a and x = b, so maybe I should write them as a = -2 and b = 7. Just making sure I got that right.\n\nNow, moving on to the horizontal asymptote. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. The rule is that if the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients. If the numerator is one degree higher, it's y = a/b, where a is the leading coefficient of the numerator and b is that of the denominator.\n\nIn this case, the degree of numerator (1) is less than the denominator (2). So, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Therefore, c = 0.\n\nPutting it all together, a ="

            "output": " -2, b = 7, c = 0. So, a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5. Wait, that's 5? Let me check again.\n\nWait, vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x =7, so a and b are -2 and 7. Adding them gives -2 +7 =5, then adding c which is 0 gives 5. Hmm, that seems right. But let me double-check the horizontal asymptote.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the limit as x approaches infinity of f(x). Let's see:\n\nlim x→±∞ (2x)/(x² -5x -14). Divide numerator and denominator by x², the highest degree in the denominator:\n\nNumerator becomes (2x)/x² = 2/x, and denominator becomes (x² -5x -14)/x² = 1 -5/x -14/x². So the limit becomes (2/x)/(1 -5/x -14/x²). As x approaches infinity, the terms with 1/x go to zero, so the limit is 0/1 = 0. So yes, horizontal asymptote at y=0. So c is indeed 0.\n\nTherefore, adding them up: -2 +7 +0 =5. So the answer should be 5. \n\nWait, but let me check the factoring again. The denominator was x² -5x -14. Let me multiply (x +2)(x -7) to confirm. x*x =x², x*(-7) +2*x = -7x +2x = -5x, and 2*(-7)= -14. Yes, that's correct. So the roots are indeed -2 and 7. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The sum is 5. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), we factor the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7)\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the vertical asymptotes at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\"
