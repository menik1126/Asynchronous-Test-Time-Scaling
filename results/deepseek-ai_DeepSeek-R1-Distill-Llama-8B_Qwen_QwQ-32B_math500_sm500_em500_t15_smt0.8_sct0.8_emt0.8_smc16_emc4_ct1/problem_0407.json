Rechecking:\n\nWait, no. The LCM is in terms of teeth. But the time must be the same for both gears. So, LCM\u7259\u9f7f\u6570 must be divided by"

The correct method is to find the LCM of their rotation periods.\n\n### Step 6: Find LCM of Rotation Periods (Seconds)\n\nFirst, express the rotation periods in seconds:\n\n- **Gear 1:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Rotation Period} = \\frac{2000}{60} = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n\n- **Gear 2:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Rotation Period} = \\frac{2700}{60} = 45 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n\nNow, find LCM of \\( \\frac{10}{3} \\) and \\( 45 \\) seconds.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate LCM of \\( \\frac{10}{3} \\) and \\( 45 \\)\n\n1. Convert to integers by multiplying by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10}{3} \\times 3 = 10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 45 \\times 3 = 135\n   \\]\n\n2. LCM of 10 and 135:\n   - \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\)\n   - \\(135 = 3^3 \\times 5\\)\n   - LCM = \\(2 \\times 3^3 \\times 5 = 270\\)\n\n3. Convert back to original units by dividing by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM} = \\frac{270}{3} = 90 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter \\(\\boxed{90}\\) seconds, both gears will have their marks pointing due north again."
