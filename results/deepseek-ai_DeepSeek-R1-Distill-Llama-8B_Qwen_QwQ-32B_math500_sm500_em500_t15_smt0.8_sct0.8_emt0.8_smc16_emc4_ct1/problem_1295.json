The cube root of 64 is 4 because 4 times 4 times 4 equals 64.\n\nNow, I'll multiply 16 by 4 to get 64.\n\nFinally, I'll raise 64 to the power of 1/3. The cube root of 64 is 4 because 4 times 4 times 4 equals 64.\n</think>\n\nLet's evaluate the expression step by step:\n\nGiven \\( a = 8 \\), we need to find the value of \\( \\left(16\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\).\n\n1. **Calculate \\( a^2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   a^2 = 8^2 = 64\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the cube root of \\( a^2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\quad \\text{because} \\quad 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply by 16:**\n   \\[\n   16 \\times 4 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Raise the result to the power of \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\):**\n   \\[\n   64^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 4 \\quad \\text{because} \\quad 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the value is \\( \\boxed{4} \\)."
