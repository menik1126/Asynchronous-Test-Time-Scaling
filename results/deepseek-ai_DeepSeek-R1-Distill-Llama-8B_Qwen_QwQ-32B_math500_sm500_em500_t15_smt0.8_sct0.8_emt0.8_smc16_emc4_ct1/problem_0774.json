            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). The answer should be expressed as √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a shouldn't be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find a + b. \n\nAlright, first, I remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. If I have a point (x, y), the distance D from the origin (0,0) would be D = √(x² + y²). So, my goal is to minimize this distance D. \n\nSince y is given in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula. Let me write that out:\n\nD = √(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to make it easier to work with. If I square D, I get D² = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]². Since minimizing D is the same as minimizing D², I can work with D² and take the derivative with respect to x to find the minimum.\n\nLet me simplify D² first. Let's compute the square term:\n\n[(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nSo now, D² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nI can expand that (x² - 3)² term. Let's do that:\n\n(x² - 3)² = x⁴ - 6x² + 9\n\nSo plugging that back in:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9)\n     = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + 9/2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nD² = (1/2)x⁴ + (x² - 3x²) + 9/2\n     = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nSo now, I have D² in terms of x: D² = ("

Let's compute D² for each.\n\nFirst, at x = 0:\n\nD² = (1/2)(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2, so D = √(9/2) = (3)/√2\n\nAt x = √2:\n\nD² = (1/2)(√2)^4 - 2(√2)^2 + 9/2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(√2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4, so 1/2 * 4 = 2\n\n(√2)^2 = 2, so -2 * 2 = -4\n\nThus, D² = 2 - 4 + 9/2 = (-2) + 9/2 = ( -4/2 + 9/2 ) = 5/2\n\nSimilarly, at x = -√2, D² will be the same because x is squared, so we get the same result.\n\nSo, D² = 5/2, so D = √(5/2) = √5 / √2. Rationalizing the denominator, that would be √10 / 2, but since they want it as √a / b"

Hmm, but the way it's written, √5 / √2 is also acceptable because a would be 5 and b would be 2. Then a + b is 7.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I rationalize, √5 / √2 = (√5 * √2) / 2 = √10 / 2, which would make a = 10 and b = 2. So a + b = 12. But I think whether it needs to be rationalized or not. The problem just says expressed as √a / b, where a is square-free. If √5 / √2 is acceptable with a = 5 and b = 2, that would give 7, but if they require it to be rationalized, then it would be √10 / 2, making a = 10 and b = 2, which is square-free as well because 10 is not divisible by any square greater than 1. Wait, 10 is 2 * 5, both primes, so that's square-free. So, either way, but perhaps the problem expects it in the simplest form with the denominator rationalized.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's given as (1/√2)(x² -3), so maybe the fraction is kept as is, so perhaps √5 / √2 is acceptable. Let me see the standard form. Usually, in such problems, they prefer having the denominator rationalized, so √10 / 2, which would make a = 10, b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, let me verify. So D = √(5/2) is equal to √5 / √2, which is equal to √10 / 2. Either way, it's correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"can be expressed as √a / b\". So, both √5 / √2 and √10 /2 would fit, but a has to be not divisible by square of any integer greater than 1. In √5 / √2, a would be 5, which is square-free,"

So, in that case, √10 / 2 is the correct form, so a = 10 and b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Because the denominator b has to be an integer, so the expression must be rationalized. Therefore, the answer is √10 / 2, so a = 10, b = 2, so 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but let me check again the calculation for D² at x = √2. Let me recalculate to be sure.\n\nAt x = √2:\n\nFirst, compute (x)^4: (√2)^4 = ( (√2)^2 )^2 = (2)^2 = 4\n\nThen, (1/2)x^4 = (1/2)*4 = 2\n\nThen, -2x²: x² is (√2)^2 = 2, so -2*2 = -4\n\nThen, +9/2.\n\nSo total D² = 2 -4 + 9/2 = (2 -4) is -2, so -2 + 4.5 = 2.5, which is 5/2. So D is sqrt(5/2). \n\nYes, so sqrt(5/2) is equal to sqrt(10)/2, because sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(10)/2. \n\nTherefore, the problem wants it expressed as sqrt(a)/b, so sqrt(10)/2, so a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b is 12. \n\nWait, but let me check the other critical point at x = 0. The distance there was sqrt(9/2) which is 3/sqrt(2) = 3*sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 2.121, whereas sqrt(10)/2 is sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16, divided by 2 is about 1.58, which"

Did I make any mistake in computing D²? Let me go through it again step by step.\n\nGiven y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). So, at x = √2, y is (1/√2)( ( (√2)^2 ) - 3 ) = (1/√2)(2 - 3) = (1/√2)(-1) = -1/√2\n\nSo the point is (√2, -1/√2). Then, the distance from the origin is sqrt( (√2)^2 + (-1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt(2 + 1/2) = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2\n\nYes, that's correct. So the minimum distance is sqrt(10)/2, which means a = 10, b = 2, a + b = 12.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), we start by using the distance formula.
