            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). The answer should be expressed as \u221aa / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a shouldn't be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find a + b. \n\nAlright, first, I remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. If I have a point (x, y), the distance D from the origin (0,0) would be D = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). So, my goal is to minimize this distance D. \n\nSince y is given in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula. Let me write that out:\n\nD = \u221a(x\u00b2 + [(1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)]\u00b2)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to make it easier to work with. If I square D, I get D\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + [(1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)]\u00b2. Since minimizing D is the same as minimizing D\u00b2, I can work with D\u00b2 and take the derivative with respect to x to find the minimum.\n\nLet me simplify D\u00b2 first. Let's compute the square term:\n\n[(1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)]\u00b2 = (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2\n\nSo now, D\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2\n\nI can expand that (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 term. Let's do that:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 = x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9\n\nSo plugging that back in:\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9)\n     = x\u00b2 + (1/2)x\u2074 - 3x\u00b2 + 9/2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nD\u00b2 = (1/2)x\u2074 + (x\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2) + 9/2\n     = (1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2\n\nSo now, I have D\u00b2 in terms of x: D\u00b2 = ("

Let's compute D\u00b2 for each.\n\nFirst, at x = 0:\n\nD\u00b2 = (1/2)(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2, so D = \u221a(9/2) = (3)/\u221a2\n\nAt x = \u221a2:\n\nD\u00b2 = (1/2)(\u221a2)^4 - 2(\u221a2)^2 + 9/2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(\u221a2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4, so 1/2 * 4 = 2\n\n(\u221a2)^2 = 2, so -2 * 2 = -4\n\nThus, D\u00b2 = 2 - 4 + 9/2 = (-2) + 9/2 = ( -4/2 + 9/2 ) = 5/2\n\nSimilarly, at x = -\u221a2, D\u00b2 will be the same because x is squared, so we get the same result.\n\nSo, D\u00b2 = 5/2, so D = \u221a(5/2) = \u221a5 / \u221a2. Rationalizing the denominator, that would be \u221a10 / 2, but since they want it as \u221aa / b"

Hmm, but the way it's written, \u221a5 / \u221a2 is also acceptable because a would be 5 and b would be 2. Then a + b is 7.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I rationalize, \u221a5 / \u221a2 = (\u221a5 * \u221a2) / 2 = \u221a10 / 2, which would make a = 10 and b = 2. So a + b = 12. But I think whether it needs to be rationalized or not. The problem just says expressed as \u221aa / b, where a is square-free. If \u221a5 / \u221a2 is acceptable with a = 5 and b = 2, that would give 7, but if they require it to be rationalized, then it would be \u221a10 / 2, making a = 10 and b = 2, which is square-free as well because 10 is not divisible by any square greater than 1. Wait, 10 is 2 * 5, both primes, so that's square-free. So, either way, but perhaps the problem expects it in the simplest form with the denominator rationalized.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's given as (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 -3), so maybe the fraction is kept as is, so perhaps \u221a5 / \u221a2 is acceptable. Let me see the standard form. Usually, in such problems, they prefer having the denominator rationalized, so \u221a10 / 2, which would make a = 10, b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, let me verify. So D = \u221a(5/2) is equal to \u221a5 / \u221a2, which is equal to \u221a10 / 2. Either way, it's correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"can be expressed as \u221aa / b\". So, both \u221a5 / \u221a2 and \u221a10 /2 would fit, but a has to be not divisible by square of any integer greater than 1. In \u221a5 / \u221a2, a would be 5, which is square-free,"

So, in that case, \u221a10 / 2 is the correct form, so a = 10 and b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Because the denominator b has to be an integer, so the expression must be rationalized. Therefore, the answer is \u221a10 / 2, so a = 10, b = 2, so 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but let me check again the calculation for D\u00b2 at x = \u221a2. Let me recalculate to be sure.\n\nAt x = \u221a2:\n\nFirst, compute (x)^4: (\u221a2)^4 = ( (\u221a2)^2 )^2 = (2)^2 = 4\n\nThen, (1/2)x^4 = (1/2)*4 = 2\n\nThen, -2x\u00b2: x\u00b2 is (\u221a2)^2 = 2, so -2*2 = -4\n\nThen, +9/2.\n\nSo total D\u00b2 = 2 -4 + 9/2 = (2 -4) is -2, so -2 + 4.5 = 2.5, which is 5/2. So D is sqrt(5/2). \n\nYes, so sqrt(5/2) is equal to sqrt(10)/2, because sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(10)/2. \n\nTherefore, the problem wants it expressed as sqrt(a)/b, so sqrt(10)/2, so a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b is 12. \n\nWait, but let me check the other critical point at x = 0. The distance there was sqrt(9/2) which is 3/sqrt(2) = 3*sqrt(2)/2 \u2248 2.121, whereas sqrt(10)/2 is sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16, divided by 2 is about 1.58, which"

Did I make any mistake in computing D\u00b2? Let me go through it again step by step.\n\nGiven y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). So, at x = \u221a2, y is (1/\u221a2)( ( (\u221a2)^2 ) - 3 ) = (1/\u221a2)(2 - 3) = (1/\u221a2)(-1) = -1/\u221a2\n\nSo the point is (\u221a2, -1/\u221a2). Then, the distance from the origin is sqrt( (\u221a2)^2 + (-1/\u221a2)^2 ) = sqrt(2 + 1/2) = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2\n\nYes, that's correct.
