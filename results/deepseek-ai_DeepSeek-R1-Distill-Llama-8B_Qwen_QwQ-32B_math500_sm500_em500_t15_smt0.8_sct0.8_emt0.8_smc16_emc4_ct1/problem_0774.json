            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Then, express that distance as √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, with a not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Finally, I need to find a + b.\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling what the distance from a point to the origin is. If I have a point (x, y), the distance to the origin (0, 0) is given by the formula √(x² + y²). So, I need to minimize this distance for a point (x, y) that lies on the given graph.\n\nSince y is defined in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula. So, the distance D from the origin to a point on the graph is:\n\nD = √(x² + y²) = √(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²)\n\nWait, let me write that out more clearly. Substitute y with (1/√2)(x² - 3):\n\nD = √(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²)\n\nLet me compute the square of the y-component:\n\n[(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nSo, now D squared (since minimizing D is equivalent to minimizing D squared) is:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nLet me expand that (x² - 3)² term:\n\n(x² - 3)² = x⁴ - 6x² + 9\n\nSo, D² becomes:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9)\n= x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + 9/2\nCombine like terms:\n\nx² - 3x² = -2x², and the constants are 9/2.\n\nSo, D² = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nNow, to find the minimum distance, I need to find the value of x that minimizes D²."

So, the minimal distance D is sqrt(5/2).\n\nWait, let me write that as a single root to make it clearer:\n\nsqrt(5/2) can be expressed as √(5)/√(2). To rationalize the denominator, we can write it as (√10)/2.\n\nBut, let me check:\n\nsqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) )= sqrt(10)/2.\n\nSo, yes, sqrt(5/2) is equal to sqrt(10)/2. So, both forms are possible.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the minimal distance can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one.\n\nSo, in sqrt(a)/b, a needs to be square-free. Let me see:\n\nIf I write the minimal distance as sqrt(10)/2, then a = 10 and b = 2. Is 10 square-free? Yes, because its prime factors are 2 and 5, neither of which is squared.\n\nAlternatively, if I take sqrt(5/2) and express that as sqrt(10)/2, that's the same as √10 / 2, so that's better because it can be written as a single square root with a square-free a.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check whether sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) also meets the conditions. a is 5 and b is sqrt(2)? No, because b has to be an integer. So, a would be 5, and b would be 2, but sqrt(a)/b would be sqrt(5)/2, which is not the same as sqrt(10)/2. Wait, no. Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, if we rationalize sqrt(5/2), we get sqrt(10)/2, right? So, the two representations:\n\nsqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2\n\nSo, now, expressed as"

So, the correct expression is sqrt(10)/2, so a = 10, b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, but let me confirm my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step.\n\nFirst, the minimal D squared is 2.5, which is 5/2. Therefore, D is sqrt(5/2). To write this as sqrt(a)/b, we can write sqrt(5)/sqrt(2), but since the denominator must be an integer, we need to rationalize it. So sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) multiplied by sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) gives sqrt(10)/2. Therefore, sqrt(10)/2 is the form where a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b is 12. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to get a different expression. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of f(√2). Let me recalculate f(√2):\n\nf(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nAt x = √2,\n\nx⁴ = (√2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4,\n\nx² = (√2)^2 = 2,\n\nSo,\n\n(1/2)(4) = 2,\n\n-2*(2) = -4,\n\n+9/2 = 4.5,\n\nSo total is 2 -4 + 4.5 = 2.5, which is indeed 5/2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance squared is 5/2, so the distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. So, a is 10, b is 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another critical point that I might have missed? The critical points were at x = 0, x = sqrt("

Did I compute f(x) correctly there?\n\nYes, f(0) = 9/2 = 4.5,\n\nf(sqrt(2)) = 2.5,\n\nf(-sqrt(2)) = 2.5.\n\nWait, but 2.5 is 5/2, which is less than 4.5, so the minimal occurs at x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2) or sqrt(10)/2.\n\nYes, so a is 10, b is 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me just make sure that there are no calculation errors in the derivative. Let me recheck that.\n\nD squared is (1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + 9/2.\n\nf(x) = (1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + 9/2.\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [(1/2)x^4] is (1/2)*4x^3 = 2x^3,\n\nd/dx [-2x^2] is -4x,\n\nd/dx [9/2] is 0.\n\nSo, f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x.
