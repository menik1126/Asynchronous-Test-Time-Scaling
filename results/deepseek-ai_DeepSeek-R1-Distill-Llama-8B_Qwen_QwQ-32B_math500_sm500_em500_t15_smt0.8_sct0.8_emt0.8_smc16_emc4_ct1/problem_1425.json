Since 2 is a prime number, \\( 2^{24} \\) can be written as \\( 2^{24} \\).\n\nNext, I recognize that for \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\). This means that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nTo find all possible values of \\( n \\), I list all the positive divisors of 24. These divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. However, since the problem specifies \\( n > 1 \\), I exclude 1 from the list, leaving the valid \\( n \\) values as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nFinally, I count these valid values of \\( n \\), which gives me a total of 7 positive integers greater than 1 that satisfy the condition.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) make \\( 2^{24} \\) a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   \\[\n   2^{24}\n   \\]\n   Here, the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is expressed as a prime raised to an exponent.\n\n2. **Condition for Perfect Power**:\n   For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\).
