This means that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nNow, I'll list all the positive divisors of 24. Starting from 1, they are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that \\( n \\) must be greater than 1. So, I'll exclude 1 from the list of divisors. The remaining possible values for \\( n \\) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nFinally, I count the number of valid \\( n \\) values, which are 7 in total.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) make \\( 2^{24} \\) a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   \n   We need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\). This means that the exponent 24 must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization Insight:**\n   \n   The number \\( 2^{24} \\) is already in its prime factorized form. For it to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, all exponents in its prime factorization must be divisible by \\( n \\). Here, the exponent is 24, so \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\n3. **Find Divisors of 24:**\n   \n   List all positive divisors of 24:\n   \\[\n   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n   \\"
