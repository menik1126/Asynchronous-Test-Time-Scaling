The next group is 011, then 010, and finally 101. If there are remaining digits, I'll add a leading zero to make the groups complete.\n\nNow, I'll convert each binary group to its corresponding octal value:\n\n- 110 in binary is 6 in octal.\n- 011 in binary is 3 in octal.\n- 010 in binary is 2 in octal.\n- 101 in binary is 5 in octal.\n\nFinally, combining these octal digits from left to right gives me the final octal number: 5326.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conversion Process**:\n   - Binary to Octal: Each group of three binary digits (bits) corresponds to a single octal digit.\n   - If the number of bits isn't divisible by three, add leading zeros to make it a complete group.\n\n2. **Arrange the Binary Number in Groups of Three**:\n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n   - From right to left, the groups are: **110**, **011**, **010**, **101**.\n   - Add a leading zero to the leftmost group to make it a complete group of three:\n     ```\n     010 101 010 011 10\n     ```\n\n3. **Convert Each Binary Group to Octal**:\n   - **010** in binary = \\(2_{8}\\)\n   - **101** in binary = \\(5_{8}\\)\n   - **010** in binary = \\(2_{8}\\)\n   - **011** in binary = \\(3_{8}\\)\n   - **110** in binary = \\(6_{8}\\)\n\n4. **Combine the Octal Digits**:\n   - Reading the octal digits from left to right: **5 3 2 6**.\n\n5. **Final Octal Number**:\n   ```\n   10101001110_{2} = 5326_{8}\n   ```\n\n**Final"
