I'm asked to find the number of elements in the intersection of two sets: one set is all prime numbers less than 30, and the other set is all odd numbers greater than zero.\n\nNext, I'll list out all the prime numbers less than 30. These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nThen, I'll identify which of these prime numbers are odd. The number 2 is the only even prime, so all the other primes in the list are odd: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nFinally, I'll count the number of these odd prime numbers, which gives me a total of 9 elements in the intersection.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the set of all prime numbers less than 30:**\n   \\[\n   \\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than zero:**\n   \\[\n   \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, \\dots\\}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the intersection of the two sets:**\n   - The prime numbers less than 30 are: \\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}\n   - The odd numbers greater than zero that are also prime (and less than 30) are: \\{3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}\n   \n4. **Count the number of elements in the intersection:**\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ elements}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
