They are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll consider the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. This set includes numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and so on.\n\nNow, I'll find the common elements between these two sets. Looking at the prime numbers less than 30, I notice that all primes except for 2 are odd. Therefore, the primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29 are also in the set of odd numbers greater than zero.\n\nCounting these common elements, there are 9 primes.\n\nSo, the intersection of the two sets contains 9 elements.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Set of Prime Numbers Less Than 30**\n\nPrime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n\n\\[ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Set of All Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero**\n\nOdd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. The set of all odd numbers greater than zero includes:\n\n\\[ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, \\ldots \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the Intersection of the Two Sets**\n\nThe intersection of the two sets consists of numbers that are both prime and odd. Since 2 is the only even prime number, all other prime numbers less than 30 are odd. Therefore, the intersection is:\n\n\\[ 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19"
