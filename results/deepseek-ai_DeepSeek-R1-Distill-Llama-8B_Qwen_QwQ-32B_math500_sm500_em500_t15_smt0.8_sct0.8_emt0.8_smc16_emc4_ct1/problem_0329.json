This is a combination problem because the order in which the boys are selected doesn't matter.\n\nUsing the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of boys and k is the number of boys to choose, I'll calculate C(7,3).\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the girls. There are 4 girls in total, and I need to choose 2. So, I'll calculate C(4,2).\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to choose both the boys and the girls, I'll multiply the results of the two combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   This is a combination problem since the order of selection doesn't matter.\n\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \n   Similarly, this is a combination problem.\n\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the total number of ways to choose both groups:**\n   \n   Multiply the results of the two combinations.\n\n   \\[\n   35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
