This can be calculated using the combination formula for selecting 3 boys from 7, which is C(7,3).\n\nThen, I will calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 4 available. This is done using the combination formula for selecting 2 girls from 4, which is C(4,2).\n\nSince the selections are independent, I will multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls to find the total number of ways to form the group.\n\nFinally, I will compute the product of C(7,3) and C(4,2) to get the total number of possible groups.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of boys and girls available:**\n   - **Boys:** 7\n   - **Girls:** 4\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   The number of ways to select 3 boys from 7 is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}\n   \\]\n   \n   Calculating:\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \n   The number of ways to select 2 girls from 4 is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!}\n   \\]\n   \n   Calculating:\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the total number of ways to form the"
