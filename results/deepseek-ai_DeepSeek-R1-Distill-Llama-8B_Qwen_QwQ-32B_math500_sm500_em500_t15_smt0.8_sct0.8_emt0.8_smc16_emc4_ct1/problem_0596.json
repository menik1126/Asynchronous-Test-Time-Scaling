Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that both the circle and the parabola are given by their equations. The circle has a center at the origin (0,0) and a radius of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) because the equation is \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\). The parabola, on the other hand, opens to the right since it's in the form \\( y^2 = 4ax \\). Comparing, I see that \\( 4a = 8 \\) so \\( a = 2 \\). That means the vertex of the parabola is at (0,0) and it opens towards the positive x-axis.\n\nNow, the question mentions that there are two common tangents, forming four points of tangency. Wait, four points? Hmm, maybe it's referring to the two tangent lines each touching both the circle and the parabola, so in total four points (two on each curve). That makes sense because each tangent line touches both the circle and the parabola once each.\n\nTo find the area of the quadrilateral formed by these four points, I first need to determine the coordinates of these points of tangency. So, maybe I should find the equations of these common tangents and then find their points of contact with both the circle and the parabola.\n\nI remember that for two conic sections, the equations of their common tangents can be found by solving the system of equations where the line is tangent to both curves. Alternatively, maybe I can use the condition for a line to be tangent to a circle and to a parabola.\n\nLet me denote a general line as \\( y = mx + c \\). Since it's a tangent to both the circle and the parabola, the distance from the center of the circle (0,0) to the line should equal the radius, which is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Also, this line should be tangent to the parabola.\n\nFor the circle, the distance from (0,0) to the line \\( y = mx + c \\) is \\( \\"

Setting that equal to the radius:\n\n\\( \\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{1 + m^2}} = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n=> \\( c^2 = 2(1 + m^2) \\quad (1) \\)\n\nNow, for the line to be tangent to the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\), substituting \\( y = mx + c \\) into the parabola equation gives:\n\n\\( (mx + c)^2 = 8x \\)\nExpanding that: \\( m^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 = 8x \\)\nWhich simplifies to: \\( m^2x^2 + (2mc - 8)x + c^2 = 0 \\)\n\nSince this is a tangent, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be zero.\n\nDiscriminant D = [2mc - 8]^2 - 4 * m^2 * c^2 = 0\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nD = (2mc - 8)^2 - 4m^2c^2\n= 4m^2c^2 - 32mc + 64 - 4m^2c^2\n= -32mc + 64\n\nSet D = 0:\n\n-32mc + 64 = 0\n=> -32mc = -64\n=> mc = 2 \\quad (2)\n\nSo now we have two equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom (1): c^2 = 2(1 + m^2)\n\nFrom (2): c = 2/m (since mc = 2, so c = 2/m, but we can also have c negative? Wait, let me check. If mc = 2, then c = 2/m. But depending on signs, maybe we have two possibilities. Hmm.)\n\nPlugging c = 2/m into equation (1):\n\n( (2/m)^2 ) = 2(1 + m^2)\n\nCompute left side: 4/m²\n\nSet equal to right side: 2(1 + m^2)\n\nThus,\n\n4/m² = 2 + 2m²\n\nMultiply both sides by m²:\n\n4 = 2m² + 2"

Substitute into the parabola equation:\n\n(x + 2)^2 = 8x\nx² + 4x + 4 = 8x\nx² -4x +4 = 0\nWhich is (x -2)^2 = 0, so x=2 is a double root.

Again, tangent.\n\nWait, but in that case, both tangent lines touch the parabola at x=2, but that's only one point each. But how come the quadrilateral has four points? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here because the parabola is symmetric, so maybe each tangent touches both the upper and lower parts of the parabola.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the parabola y² = 8x is symmetric about the x-axis, so each tangent line will touch it at two points symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n\nWait, but substituting y = x + 2 into the parabola gives x=2 as the only solution, which is one point. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a line should intersect a parabola at two points unless it's tangent.\n\nWait, but if x=2 is a double root, that implies the line touches the parabola at x=2, so just one point. Similarly for y=-x -2. But that seems contradictory because a line can't be tangent to a parabola at one point and not intersect elsewhere, or can it?\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should graph it mentally. The parabola y²=8x opens to the right, vertex at origin. The line y = x + 2 would intersect the parabola at x=2, y=4. Similarly, the line y = -x -2 would intersect at x=2, y=-4.

So the quadrilateral is a rectangle? Wait, no, because from A(-1,1) to B(2,4) is not perpendicular to the side from B(2,4) to D(2,-4). So it's not a rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Because the opposite sides are equal and parallel.\n\nCompute vectors AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nAB: from A(-1,1) to B(2,4) is (3,3)\n\nBC: from B(2,4) to C(-1,-1) is (-3,-5)\n\nCD: from C(-1,-1) to D(2,-4) is (3,-3)\n\nDA: from D(2,-4) to A(-1,1) is (-3,5)\n\nWait, so AB is (3,3), CD is (3,-3), BC is (-3,-5), DA is (-3,5). So AB is not equal to CD. So they are not equal vectors, so it's not a parallelogram.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to stick with shoelace formula then.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the area using the distance between the lines and the lengths between the points.\n\nWait, the points A(-1,1) and C"

The horizontal distance between the two vertical lines (x=-1 and x=2) is 3 units.\n\nIf I imagine the quadrilateral as a trapezoid with the two vertical sides AC and BD, and the other two sides connecting them. Wait, but in a trapezoid, the two bases are the two parallel sides. Here, AC and BD are both vertical, so they are parallel. So the figure is a trapezoid with the two parallel sides AC (length 2) and BD (length 8), separated by a horizontal distance of 3 units.\n\nThe area of a trapezoid is (average of the two bases) multiplied by the distance between them. Wait, but in this case, the bases are the two vertical sides, so the distance between them is the horizontal distance between x=-1 and x=2, which is 3 units. So area would be ( (2 +8)/2 ) * 3 = (10/2)*3 = 15. Which matches the shoelace result.\n\nAh! That's a better way. Since the two vertical sides are the bases of the trapezoid, and the distance between them is 3, so area is indeed 15. So that confirms the shoelace result.\n\nTherefore, the area is 15.
