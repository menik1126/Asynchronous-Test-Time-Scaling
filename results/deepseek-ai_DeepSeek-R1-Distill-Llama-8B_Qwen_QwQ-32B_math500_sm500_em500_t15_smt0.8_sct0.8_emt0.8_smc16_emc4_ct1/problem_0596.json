Hmm, interesting. I remember that common tangents to two conic sections form a quadrilateral, and in this case, the problem says there are two common tangents, each touching both curves at one point. So, we have four points in total, and these four points form a quadrilateral. I need to figure out the coordinates of these four points and then compute the area of that quadrilateral.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. The circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\) is centered at the origin with a radius of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). The parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\) opens to the right. I can sketch a rough graph in my mind: the circle is relatively small, and the parabola is symmetric about the x-axis. The common tangents will be lines that touch both the circle and the parabola without crossing them.\n\nI recall that to find the common tangents of two curves, we can find the equations of the lines that are tangent to both. So, perhaps I should start by finding the equations of these common tangent lines.\n\nLet me denote a general line as \\( y = mx + c \\). Since this line is tangent to both the circle and the parabola, it must satisfy the tangent conditions for both curves.\n\nFirst, for the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\). The condition for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be tangent to the circle is that the distance from the center of the circle (which is at (0,0)) to the line is equal to the radius of the circle.\n\nThe formula for the distance from a point \\( (x_0, y_0) \\) to the line \\( ax + by + c = 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \\).\n\nIn our case, the line is \\( y = mx + c \\), which can be rewritten as \\( mx - y + c = 0 \\). So, the distance from the center ("

I need to find the condition that the line \\( y = mx + c \\) is tangent to this parabola as well.\n\nFor the parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\), the condition for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be tangent is \\( c = a/m \\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me recall. For the parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\), the tangent in slope form is \\( y = mx + a/m \\). So yes, for \\( y^2 = 8x \\), which is \\( y^2 = 4a x \\) with \\( a = 2 \\), the tangent condition is \\( c = a/m = 2/m \\). So, \\( c = 2/m \\).\n\nWait, let me verify that. Alternatively, I can derive it.\n\nGiven the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\), the condition for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be tangent to it can be found by substituting into the parabola equation:\n\n\\( (mx + c)^2 = 8x \\)\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\( m^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 - 8x = 0 \\)\n\nThis is a quadratic in x: \\( m^2x^2 + (2mc - 8)x + c^2 = 0 \\)\n\nFor this quadratic to have"

So, for example, the line AB connects (-1,1) on the circle to (2,4) on the parabola, and similarly, CD connects (-1,-1) on the circle to (2,-4) on the parabola.\n\nYes, that makes sense since each tangent line should touch both curves, but at one point each.\n\nSo, the four points of tangency are (-1,1), (2,4), (-1,-1), and (2,-4).\n\nWait, but in reality, each tangent line is tangent to the circle at one point and to the parabola at another point.

Wait, no, that's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, since the quadrilateral is formed by two congruent triangles above and below the x-axis, maybe I can compute the area of the upper part and double it.\n\nBut perhaps the shoelace formula was straightforward and gave 15, so that's likely the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify by another method.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider vectors.\n\nThe quadrilateral can be divided into two congruent trapezoids, each above and below the x-axis.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the points, it's a trapezoid but not a parallelogram. Wait, no, from the coordinates, the sides AB and CD are not parallel, nor are BC and AD.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's a kite or a rhombus? Wait, from the coordinates, it doesn't seem so.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a rectangle but rotated. Alternatively, compute the vectors of the sides to see the angles.\n\nAlternatively, compute the distances between the points and see.\n\nWait, the distances between consecutive points:\n\nAB: sqrt[(2 - (-1))^2 + (4 - 1)^2] = sqrt[9 + 9] = 3√2\n\nBC: sqrt[(-1 - 2)^2 + (-1 - 4)^2] = sqrt[9 + 25] = sqrt(34)\n\nCD: sqrt[(2 - (-1))^2 + (-4 - (-1))^2] = sqrt[9 + 9] = 3√2\n\nDA: sqrt[(-1 - 2)^2 + (1 - (-4))^2] = sqrt[9 + 25] = sqrt(34)\n\nSo, sides alternate between 3√2 and sqrt(34), so it's a kite if adjacent sides are equal, but in this case, it's not a kite because the sides alternate.\n\nWait, perhaps the figure is a rectangle?\n\nWait, the sides AB and CD are both 3√2, and BC and DA are both sqrt(34). Wait, but for a rectangle, opposite sides must be equal. If AB and CD are both 3√2, and BC and DA are both sqrt(34), then it's a parallelogram. But let me check if the sides are perpendicular.\n\nCompute the slopes:\n\nSlope of AB: (4"

So, the sides AB and CD have slopes 1 and -1, which are negative reciprocals, so they are perpendicular? Wait, 1 and -1 are negative reciprocals (since 1 * -1 = -1), so they are perpendicular. Similarly, BC and DA have slopes 5/3 and -5/3, which are also negative reciprocals? Wait, 5/3 * (-5/3) = -25/9 ≠ -1. So, not perpendicular. Hmm.\n\nWait, so AB is perpendicular to CD, but BC is not perpendicular to DA. So, the figure has two sides perpendicular, but not all adjacent sides. So, it's a parallelogram with two sides perpendicular? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area can be found by the shoelace formula, which gave 15. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, since the figure is symmetric over the x-axis, the area can be calculated as twice the area of the upper half.\n\nThe upper half consists of the points A(-1,1), B(2,4), and the origin? Wait, no. Wait, the upper half of the quadrilateral is the polygon from A(-1,1) to B(2,4) to (2,0) to (-1,0) to A?
