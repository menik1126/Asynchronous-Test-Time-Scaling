            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\nTo do this, I'll start by determining the prime factorization of 284. I know that 284 divided by 2 is 142, and 142 divided by 2 is 71. Since 71 is a prime number, the prime factors of 284 are 2 squared multiplied by 71.\n\nNext, I'll use the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \\((p^{n+1} - 1)/(p - 1)\\) for a prime factor \\(p\\) raised to the power of \\(n\\). Applying this to 2\u00b2 and 71\u00b9 gives me the total sum of divisors as (2\u00b3 - 1)/(2 - 1) + (71\u00b2 - 1)/(71 - 1) = 7 + 2550 = 2557.\n\nFinally, I'll subtract 284 from this total to find the sum of the proper divisors: 2557 - 284 = 2273.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 2273. Checking if 2273 is a prime number by testing divisibility with primes up to its square root. Since it doesn't divide by any primes, 2273 is prime.\n\nThe proper divisors of a prime number are just 1. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 2273 is 1.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of the result from step 1.**\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284\n\nFirst, we need to determine the proper divisors of 284.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n   - 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2.\n   - \\( 284 \\div 2 = 142 \\)\n   - 142 is also even, so it's divisible by 2.\n   - \\( 142 \\div 2 = 71 \\)\n   - 71 is a prime number.\n\n   Therefore, the prime factors of 284 are:\n   \\[\n   284 = 2^2 \\"
