            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number that are less than the number itself.\n\nI'll start by finding the prime factors of 284. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. Dividing 142 by 2 again yields 71. Since 71 is a prime number, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71 to the first power.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p^0 + p^1 + ... + p^k) multiplied by the same for each prime factor, I can calculate the sum of all divisors of 284.\n\nSo, the sum of divisors is (1 + 2 + 4) multiplied by (1 + 71), which equals 7 times 72, resulting in 504. Since the proper divisors exclude the number itself, I'll subtract 284 from 504 to get the sum of proper divisors of 284.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of this sum, which is 504. Again, I'll find the prime factors of 504. Breaking it down, 504 divided by 2 repeatedly gives 3, 7, and 7. So, the prime factorization is 2 cubed multiplied by 3 squared multiplied by 7 squared.\n\nApplying the sum of divisors formula again: (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) times (1 + 3 + 9) times (1 + 7 + 49), which equals 15 times 13 times 57. Multiplying these together gives 15 multiplied by 741, resulting in 11,115. Since we're looking for proper divisors, I'll subtract 504 from this total, leaving 10,611.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 10,611.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n   \\[\n   284 = 2^2 \\times 71^1\n   \\]\n2. **Sum of All Divisors (Using the formula for the sum of divisors):**\n   \\[\n"
