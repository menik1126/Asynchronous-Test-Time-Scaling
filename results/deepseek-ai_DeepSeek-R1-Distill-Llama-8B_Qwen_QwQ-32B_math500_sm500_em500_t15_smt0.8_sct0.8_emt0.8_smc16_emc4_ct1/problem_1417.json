Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, plugging in these values gives V_beaker = π * (3)^2 * 8.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V_sphere = (4/3)πR³. With a radius of 6 cm, substituting into the formula yields V_sphere = (4/3)π*(6)^3.\n\nAfter finding both volumes, I'll divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one beaker to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank. This will give me the number of beakers as a mathematical expression.\n\nFinally, I'll round the result to a reasonable number of significant figures to provide a practical answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker:**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{beaker}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( r \\) is the radius of the base of the cylinder (3 cm)\n   - \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder (8 cm)\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{beaker}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank:**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere (6 cm)\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi"
