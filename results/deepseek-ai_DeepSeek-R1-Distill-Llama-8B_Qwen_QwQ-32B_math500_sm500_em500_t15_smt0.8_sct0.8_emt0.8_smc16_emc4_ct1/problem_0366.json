            "output": "First, I'll define variables for the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles.\n\nFrom the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means I can write the equation 4B / 3Y = 4 / 3.\n\nNext, I'll solve this equation to find a relationship between B and Y. Cross-multiplying gives 4B * 3 = 4 * 3Y, which simplifies to 12B = 12Y. Dividing both sides by 12, I find that B = Y.\n\nNow, I'll apply the second condition. After adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 7:3. This gives the equation (B + 5) / (Y - 3) = 7 / 3.\n\nSince I already know that B = Y, I can substitute Y with B in the equation, resulting in (B + 5) / (B - 3) = 7 / 3.\n\nTo solve for B, I'll cross-multiply: 3(B + 5) = 7(B - 3). Expanding both sides, I get 3B + 15 = 7B - 21.\n\nSubtracting 3B from both sides gives 15 = 4B - 21. Adding 21 to both sides, I find that 36 = 4B. Dividing both sides by 4, I determine that B = 9.\n\nTherefore, there were 9 blue marbles in the bag before additional marbles were added.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Let**:\n- \\( B \\) = Number of blue marbles initially.\n- \\( Y \\) = Number of yellow marbles initially.\n\n**Given Ratios**:\n1. Initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n2.
