Calculating \\(2^3\\) gives 8.\n\nNext, I'll express 72 as a product of its prime factors to find the value of \\(3^x\\). Breaking down 72, I get \\(8 \\cdot 9\\), which is \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^2\\).\n\nNow, I can rewrite the original equation as \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2\\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other, leading to \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( 2^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express 72 in terms of its prime factors:**\n   \\[\n   72 = 8 \\times 9 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the expression for 72 back into the original equation:**\n   \\[\n   2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 2^3 \\times 3^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Since the bases on both sides of the equation are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
