The equation given is \\( 2^3 \\times 3^x = 72 \\).\n\nNext, I'll calculate \\( 2^3 \\) to simplify the equation. \\( 2^3 \\) equals 8, so the equation becomes \\( 8 \\times 3^x = 72 \\).\n\nThen, I'll isolate \\( 3^x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This gives me \\( 3^x = \\frac{72}{8} \\), which simplifies to \\( 3^x = 9 \\).\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 3^x = 9 \\). I know that \\( 9 \\) is the same as \\( 3^2 \\). Therefore, \\( x \\) must be 2 because \\( 3^2 = 9 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll verify the solution by substituting \\( x = 2 \\) back into the original equation. Calculating \\( 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\), I get \\( 8 \\times 9 = 72 \\), which matches the original equation. This confirms that \\( x = 2 \\) is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[ 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\]\n\n**Step 1: Simplify \\( 2^3 \\)**\n\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 8 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Isolate \\( 3^x \\)**\nDivide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for \\( 3^x \\):\n\\[ 3^x = \\frac{72}{8} \\]\n\\[ 3^x = 9 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Express 9 as a Power of 3**\nWe know that:\n\\[ 9 = 3^2 \\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 3^x = 3^2 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)**\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[ \\"
