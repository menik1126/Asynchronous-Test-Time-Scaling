            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: \"How many y-intercepts does the graph of the parabola x = y² -4y -1 have?\" Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that intercepts are points where the graph crosses the axes. The x-intercepts happen where y=0, and the y-intercepts are where x=0. So, for this equation, since it's solved for x in terms of y, the y-intercepts would be the points where x=0. \n\nAlright, so to find the y-intercepts, I set x equal to 0 and solve for y. That means plugging in 0 for x: \n\n0 = y² - 4y -1.\n\nSo now I have a quadratic equation in terms of y: y² -4y -1 = 0. I need to solve this quadratic to find the y-values where the graph crosses the y-axis. \n\nI recall that quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, factoring, completing the square, or graphing. Let me first check if this quadratic factors nicely. The equation is y² -4y -1 =0. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -1 (the constant term) and add up to -4 (the coefficient of the y-term). \n\nHmm, let me think: factors of -1 are 1 and -1. 1 * (-1) = -1, and 1 + (-1) = 0. But in my equation, the middle term is -4y, not 0y. So factoring isn't straightforward here. That means I need to use another method. \n\nSince factoring isn't working, I'll use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is y = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a). For the equation y² -4y -1 =0, a=1, b=-4, c=-1. Plugging these into the formula:\n\ny = [ -(-4) ± sqrt( (-4)² -4*1*(-1) ) ] / (2*1)\ny = [4 ± sqrt(16 +4)] / 2\ny = [4 ± sqrt(20)] / 2\n\nSimplify sqrt(20): sqrt(20) = sqrt(4*5) = 2*sqrt(5"

            "output": "). So substituting back:\n\ny = [4 ± 2sqrt(5)] / 2\n\nDivide numerator terms by 2:\n\ny = 2 ± sqrt(5)\n\nSo that gives two solutions: y = 2 + sqrt(5) and y = 2 - sqrt(5). \n\nWait, sqrt(5) is an irrational number, approximately 2.236. So 2 + sqrt(5) is about 4.236, and 2 - sqrt(5) is about -0.236. Both of these are real numbers, so that means there are two real solutions. \n\nTherefore, the equation x = y² -4y -1 crosses the y-axis at two points. \n\nLet me just double-check if I did everything right. The question is about y-intercepts, so setting x=0 is correct. The quadratic equation was set up properly. The quadratic formula steps look okay. The discriminant (the part under the square root) was 16 +4 = 20, which is positive, so two real roots. That makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the graph of this parabola. Since the equation is x in terms of y, it's a parabola that opens either to the right or left. The standard form for such a parabola is x = a(y - k)² + h. Let me see if I can rewrite the given equation in that form to check its direction and maybe the intercepts again.\n\nStarting with x = y² -4y -1. Let's complete the square for the y terms. \n\nTake y² -4y. To complete the square, take half of -4, which is -2, square it to get 4. So add and subtract 4:\n\nx = (y² -4y +4 -4) -1\nx = (y - 2)^2 -4 -1\nx = (y - 2)^2 -5\n\nSo the equation in vertex form is x = (y - 2)^2 -5. \n\nThe vertex is at (h, k) but since it's x = a(y -k)^2 + h, the vertex is (-5, 2). Wait, actually, the standard form is x = a(y - k)^2 + h, so the vertex is (h,"

            "model": "small",
            "output": " k). So h is -5, and k is 2. So the vertex is (-5, 2). \n\nSince a is 1, which is positive, the parabola opens to the right. So it's a right-opening parabola. That means it will cross the y-axis where x=0, which we already found as two points. \n\nSo the vertex is at (-5, 2), so the y-intercepts are two points on the left side of the vertex? Wait, no. Because it's opening to the right, the vertex is the minimum point for x. So as y increases or decreases from 2, x increases. So when x=0, we have two points on either side of the vertex along the y-axis. So the two y-intercepts are above and below the vertex. \n\nBut in any case, since the equation x=0 leads to two real solutions, that means two y-intercepts. So I think I was correct earlier. \n\nAnother way to think about it is to recall that a quadratic equation can have at most two real roots, and since the discriminant here was positive, there are two distinct real roots, hence two y-intercepts. \n\nTherefore, the graph of x = y² -4y -1 has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is a parabola opening to the right. To find y-intercepts, set x=0 and solve the quadratic equation y² - 4y - 1 = 0. Using the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 4)] / 2 = [4 ± sqrt(20)] / 2 = 2 ± sqrt(5).\n\nThere are two real solutions, meaning two y-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2}"
