            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a y-intercept is. If I remember correctly, a y-intercept is a point where the graph crosses the y-axis. At any point on the y-axis, the value of x is zero. So, to find the y-intercepts, I should set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for y. That makes sense because when a graph crosses the y-axis, its x-coordinate is zero.\n\nAlright, so plugging \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation, I get:\n\n\\( 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\)\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of y. Quadratic equations are of the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), where a, b, and c are coefficients. In this case, the equation is \\( y^2 - 4y - 1 = 0 \\), so the coefficients are:\n- \\( a = 1 \\) (coefficient of \\( y^2 \\))\n- \\( b = -4 \\) (coefficient of y)\n- \\( c = -1 \\) (constant term)\n\nTo find the number of real solutions (which correspond to the y-intercepts), I can use the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant is given by \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\). If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots; if it's zero, there's exactly one real root; and if it's negative, there are no real roots, but rather two complex roots.\n\nLet me calculate the discriminant for this equation:\n\n\\( D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) \\)\n\nCalculating that step by step:\n- First, square \\( b \\): \\( (-4)^2 = 16 \\)\n- Then, compute \\( 4ac \\): \\( 4 * 1 * (-1) = -4 \\)\n- Now, subtract these: \\( 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\)\n\nSo, the discriminant is 20. Since 20 is positive, that means there are two distinct real solutions for y. Therefore,"

            "output": " the parabola crosses the y-axis at two points. Hence, there are two y-intercepts.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recheck my steps.\n\n1. Start with the original equation: \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\)\n2. To find y-intercepts, set \\( x = 0 \\): \\( 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\)\n3. Recognize it's a quadratic in y: \\( y^2 - 4y - 1 = 0 \\)\n4. Identify coefficients: \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), \\( c = -1 \\)\n5. Compute discriminant: \\( D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\)\n6. Since D > 0, two real roots, meaning two y-intercepts.\n\nEverything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors there. So, the conclusion is that there are two y-intercepts for this parabola.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of y-intercepts of the parabola \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for y:\n\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. The discriminant is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\nD = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. Thus, the graph has two y-intercepts.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{2}"
