Let's break down the information provided:\n\n- Total students: 360\n- Students taking calculus, physics, and chemistry: 15\n- Students not taking any of calculus, physics, or chemistry: 15\n- Total students taking calculus: 180\n- Students taking chemistry are twice as many as those taking physics: Let the number of physics students be P, so chemistry students would be 2P.\n- Students taking both calculus and chemistry: 75\n- Students taking both physics and chemistry: 75\n- Students taking both physics and calculus: 30\n\nFirst, I can determine the number of students taking chemistry since it's twice the number of physics students. So, if P is the number of physics students, then chemistry students are 2P.\n\nNext, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the three subjects. The total number of students taking at least one of the subjects is the total students minus those taking none: 360 - 15 = 345.\n\nThe formula for three sets is:\nTotal = C + P + H - (C ∩ P) - (C ∩ H) - (P ∩ H) + (C ∩ P ∩ H)\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n345 = 180 + P + 2P - 30 - 75 - 75 + 15\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n345 = 180 + 3P - 180 + 15\n\nThis simplifies further to:\n345 = 15 + 3P\n\nSolving for P gives:\n3P = 330\nP = 110\n\nTherefore, the number of students taking physics is 110.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students: 360\n- Students taking **Calculus (C)**, **Physics (P)**, and **Chemistry (H)**: 15\n- Students not taking any of the three subjects: 15\n- Total students taking **C**: 180\n- Students taking **H** are twice those taking **P**: Let \\( P \\) be the number of students taking **P**, then \\( H = 2P \\)\n- Students taking both **C** and **H**: 75\n- Students taking both **P** and **H**: 75\n- Students taking both **C** and"
