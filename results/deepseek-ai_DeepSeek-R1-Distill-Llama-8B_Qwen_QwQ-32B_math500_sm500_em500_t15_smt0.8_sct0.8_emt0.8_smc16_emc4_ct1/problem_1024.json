Then, after finding these factors, I have to compute the sum of their values at \\(x = 1\\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by looking at the given polynomial: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). It seems like an eighth-degree polynomial, so it might factor into several lower-degree polynomials. Since it's asking for monic polynomials, I should try factoring it into monic polynomials.\n\nFirst, I notice that the polynomial looks somewhat symmetrical. If I let \\(y = x^4\\), then the polynomial becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). Let me check if this quadratic in \\(y\\) can be factored.\n\nSo, \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). Let's see, what two numbers multiply to -4 and add up to 3? That would be 4 and -1. So, yes, it factors as \\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\). Substituting back \\(y = x^4\\), this gives me \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\).\n\nOkay, so now I've broken down the original polynomial into two quartic (fourth-degree) polynomials: \\(x^4 + 4\\) and \\(x^4 - 1\\). But wait, both of these quartic polynomials can probably be factored further. Let me check each one.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\). I remember that \\(x^4 - 1\\) is a difference of squares, since \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and 1 is \\(1^2\\). So, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Then, further factor \\(x^2 - 1\\) as \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\). So, altogether, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2"

Hmm, that's a sum of squares. I recall that over the integers, the sum of squares can sometimes be factored using complex numbers, but since we need integer coefficients, maybe it can be factored in another way. Wait, actually, there's a formula for factoring \\(x^4 + 4\\), which is a biquadratic polynomial.\n\nLet me recall... I think it factors into two quadratics. The identity is \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Let me verify that:\n\nMultiply the two quadratics:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\n\\]\n\nFirst, \\(x^2 \\cdot x^2 = x^4\\).\n\nThen, \\(x^2 \\cdot (-2x) = -2x^3\\), and \\(x^2 \\cdot 2 = 2x^2\\).\n\nNext, \\(2x \\cdot x^2 = 2x^3\\), \\(2x \\cdot (-2x) = -4x^2\\), and \\(2x \\cdot 2 = 4x\\).\n\nLastly, \\(2 \\cdot x^2 = 2x^2\\), \\(2 \\cdot (-2x) = -4x\\), and \\(2 \\cdot 2 = 4\\).\n\nNow, adding all these terms together:\n\n- \\(x^4\\)\n- \\(-2x^3 + 2x^3 = 0\\)\n- \\(2x^2 -4x^2 + 2x^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(4x -4x = 0\\)\n- \\(+4\\)\n\nSo, yeah, it all simplifies to \\(x^4 + 4\\). Nice, so that factorization is correct.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the original polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) factors as:\n\n\\[\n(x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = (x^2"

Is that the complete factorization? Or did I miss any other possible factorizations?\n\nWait, is \\(x^4 + 4\\) only factorable into those two quadratics? Let me recall another approach: sometimes, higher-degree polynomials can be factored in multiple ways, but in this case, I think \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\) is the only way to factor \\(x^4 + 4\\) over integers.\n\nAlternatively, could it factor into, say, a linear and a cubic?
