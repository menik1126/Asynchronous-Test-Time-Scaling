So, the question is about factoring the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) into monic polynomials with integer coefficients, each of which can't be factored further. Then, we need to compute the sum of \\(p_i(1)\\) for all these factors.\n\nFirst, I remember that factoring polynomials often starts with looking for obvious roots or trying to factor by grouping. But since this is an eighth-degree polynomial, it's going to be a bit more complex. Let me write down the polynomial again: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\).\n\nHmm, I notice that the polynomial has terms with exponents 8, 4, and 0. That seems like it might be a quadratic in terms of \\(x^4\\). So, maybe I can substitute \\(y = x^4\\) to simplify it. Let's try that:\n\nSubstituting \\(y = x^4\\), the polynomial becomes:\n\\[y^2 + 3y - 4\\]\n\nNow, let's try to factor this quadratic. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because \\(4 * (-1) = -4\\) and \\(4 + (-1) = 3\\). So, the quadratic factors as:\n\\[(y + 4)(y - 1)\\]\n\nSubstituting back \\(y = x^4\\), we get:\n\\[(x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\]\n\nGreat, so now we have two quartic polynomials. Next, let's see if each quartic can be factored further.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\). I recall that \\(x^4 - 1\\) is a difference of squares because it's \\( (x^2)^2 - (1)^2 \\). So, it factors as:\n\\[(x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1)\\]\n\nNow, \\(x^2 - 1\\) can be factored further as a difference of squares again:\n\\[(x + 1)(x - 1)\\]\n\nSo, putting that together, \\(x^4 - 1\\) factors into:\n\\[(x + 1)(x - 1)("

            "output": "x^2 + 1)\\]\n\nSo far, our factorization looks like:\n\\[(x^4 + 4)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\]\n\nNow, let's look at the other quartic polynomial: \\(x^4 + 4\\). Hmm, I think this can be factored into quadratics. There's a formula for factoring sums of squares, but \\(x^4 + 4\\) isn't a straightforward sum of squares. Wait, actually, it is. \\(x^4 + 4\\) can be seen as \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 - 4x^2\\), which is like \\((x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2\\). That's a difference of squares, so it factors as:\n\\[(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\]\n\nSo, plugging that back in, our polynomial becomes:\n\\[(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\]\n\nNow, let's check if each of these factors can be factored further over the integers.\n\nLooking at \\(x^2 + 2x + 2\\): The discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals, let alone integers.\n\nSimilarly, \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) has a discriminant of \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), so it also doesn't factor further.\n\nThe linear factors \\(x + 1\\) and \\(x - 1\\) are irreducible.\n\nThe quadratic \\(x^2 + 1\\) has a discriminant of \\(0 - 4 = -4\\), which is also negative, so it can't be factored further.\n\nSo, all the factors are irreducible over the integers. Each is monic because we didn't multiply or divide by any constants during our factoring.\n\nNow, to find the sum \\(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1)\\), we'll compute the value of each polynomial at x=1 and add them up.\n\nLet me"
