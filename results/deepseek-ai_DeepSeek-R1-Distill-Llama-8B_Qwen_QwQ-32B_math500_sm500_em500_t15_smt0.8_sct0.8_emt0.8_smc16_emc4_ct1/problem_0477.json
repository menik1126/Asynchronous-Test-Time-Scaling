The equations are:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\),\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\),\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\).\n\nAnd I need to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\). Hmm, it's a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that all three equations involve symmetric expressions of x, y, and z. That makes me think about using symmetric sums or maybe even Vieta's formula. Vieta's relates the sums and products of roots of a polynomial, so maybe if I can express these equations in terms of symmetric sums, it might help.\n\nLet me denote the variables a, b, c as x, y, z for simplicity. So, the symmetric sums would be:\n\n- Sum of variables: \\( a + b + c = S \\),\n- Sum of products: \\( ab + bc + ca = P \\),\n- Product: \\( abc = Q \\).\n\nGiven that, from the first equation, we have \\( abc = 4 \\). So that tells me Q = 4.\n\nLooking at the second equation, \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). There's a known identity for the sum of cubes:\n\n\\( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc \\).\n\nSo substituting the known values and variables:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3S P + 3 Q \\).\n\nSince Q is 4, this becomes:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3S P + 12 \\).\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3S P = 4 - 12 \\),\n\\( S^3 - 3S P = -8 \\).\n\nHmm, that's one equation involving S and P. I need another one.\n\nLooking at the third equation: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12"

Let me see if I can factor this expression or relate it to symmetric sums.\n\nLooking at the terms, I can group them as:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \\).\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me factor terms:\n\nEach term has two variables, and one is squared. Alternatively, perhaps express it in terms of (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) minus something?\n\nWait, let me think: the expression \\( xy^2 + x^2 y \\) can be written as \\( xy(y + x) \\). Similarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \\), and \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \\).\n\nSo the entire expression is equal to:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\).\n\nAlternatively, let me note that this expression can be written as \\( x(y^2 + xz) + z(y^2 + xz) \\). Wait, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that it's equal to \\( x(y^2 + x y + z^2 + z x + y z^2 + y^2 z) \\), no, that's not the case.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps factor something out.\n\nWait, let's try to manipulate the third equation.\n\nThe third equation is \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\).\n\nI can factor terms by grouping:\n\n\\( (xy^2 + x^2 y) + (xz^2 + x^2 z) + (yz^2 + y^2 z) \\).\n\nEach group can be factored as \\( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \\). So, factoring:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can factor x, y, z out:\n\n= \\( x(y^2 + x y + z^2 + z x"

Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express this in terms of (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) minus something?\n\nLet me recall that:\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y + 3xyz \\).\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me compute that:\n\nLeft side: (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nWait, actually, expanding (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n= a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= a²b + abc + a²c + ab² + b²c + abc + a c² + b c² + c²a\n\nWait, grouping similar terms:\n\n= a²b + ab² + a²c + a c² + b²c + b c² + 3abc\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a^2 b + a b^2 + a^2 c + a c^2 + b^2 c + b c^2) + 3abc \\).\n\nSo, the expression in the third equation is exactly the first part of this expansion, which is \\( (a^2 b + a b^2 + a^2 c + a c^2 + b^2 c + b c^2) \\).\n\nTherefore, the third equation is:\n\n\\( (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 12 \\).\n\nBecause the left-hand side of the third equation is equal to \\( (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc \\).\n\nTherefore, substituting variables back:\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12 \\).\n\nWe know that \\( xyz = 4 \\), so"
