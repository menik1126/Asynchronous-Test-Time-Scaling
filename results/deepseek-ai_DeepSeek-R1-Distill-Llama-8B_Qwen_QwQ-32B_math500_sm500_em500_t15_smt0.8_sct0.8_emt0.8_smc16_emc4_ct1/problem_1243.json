            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer.\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, I need to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. Since there's a square root involved, I remember that at some point I might need to square both sides to eliminate it. But before jumping into that, maybe I should isolate the square root term. Let me try that first.\n\nSo, I'll subtract 4 from both sides to get:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nNow, this looks better. I have the square root by itself on one side. Now, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. But I need to remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I have to check my answers at the end to make sure they actually work in the original equation.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2\n\nSimplifying the right side, the square and the square root cancel each other out, so it's just 11 - 2x.\n\nNow, expand the left side:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nHmm, let me bring all the terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplify that:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation. I can try factoring this, or use the quadratic formula if it doesn't factor nicely. Let me see if it factors.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Well, 5 is prime, so the factors are 1 and 5. Since both the middle term and the constant term are positive, and the quadratic term is positive, the factors should both be negative. So:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nWait, let me"

            "output": " check that:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = x^2 - x - 5x + 5 = x^2 -6x +5. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 5 and x = 1.\n\nBut wait, I squared both sides earlier, so I need to make sure these solutions actually satisfy the original equation. It's possible that one of them might not work because squaring can sometimes create solutions that don't fit the original equation, especially when dealing with square roots which have domain restrictions.\n\nLet me check x = 5 first.\n\nOriginal equation: x = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nPlug in x = 5:\n\n5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4\n5 = √(11 - 10) + 4\n5 = √(1) + 4\n5 = 1 + 4\n5 = 5\n\nOkay, that works.\n\nNow, check x = 1.\n\nPlug in x = 1:\n\n1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4\n1 = √(9) + 4\n1 = 3 + 4\n1 = 7\n\nHmm, that doesn't work. So x = 1 is an extraneous solution that came up when we squared both sides. Therefore, it's not a valid solution to the original equation.\n\nSo, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything else. Maybe I should check the domain of the original equation to ensure that no other solutions are possible.\n\nLooking back at the original equation:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nThe expression inside the square root, 11 - 2x, must be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the real numbers. So:\n\n11 - 2x ≥ 0\n11 ≥ 2x\nx ≤ 11/2\nx ≤ 5.5\n\nSo, any solution must be ≤5.5. Our solution x=5 is within this range, and x=1 is also within the range, but as we saw earlier, it doesn't satisfy the original equation.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x = 5.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is solved by isolating the square root,"
