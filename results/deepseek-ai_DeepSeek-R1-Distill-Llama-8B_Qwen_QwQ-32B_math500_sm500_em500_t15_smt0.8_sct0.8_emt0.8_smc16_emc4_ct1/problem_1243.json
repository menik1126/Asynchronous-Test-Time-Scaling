            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. I need to find all the values of x that satisfy this. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when there's a square root in an equation, one common method is to isolate the square root term and then square both sides to eliminate it. But before I jump into that, maybe I should write down the equation again to make sure I have it right.\n\nSo, the equation is x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, cool. Now, let me try to isolate the square root. To do that, I can subtract 4 from both sides. Let me do that:\n\nx - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nThat looks better. Now, the square root is by itself on one side, which is good. The next step is to square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. Squaring both sides should help me get rid of that radical. So, let me square both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2\n\nAlright, expanding the left side, I get (x^2 - 8x + 16) = 11 - 2x. Let me write that out:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nNow, I need to bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let me subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplify that:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nHmm, okay, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me try to factor this. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Well, the numbers -1 and -5 work because (-1) * (-5) = 5 and (-1) + (-5) = -6. So, the equation factors as:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 1 = 0  =>  x = 1\nx - 5 = 0  =>  x = 5\n\nSo,"

            "output": " I have two possible solutions: x = 1 and x = 5. But, wait a minute, I squared both sides of the equation earlier, which can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. That means I need to check both solutions in the original equation to make sure they work.\n\nLet me check x = 1 first. Plugging into the original equation:\n\n1 = sqrt(11 - 2*1) + 4\n1 = sqrt(11 - 2) + 4\n1 = sqrt(9) + 4\n1 = 3 + 4\n1 = 7\n\nHmm, that's not true. 1 does not equal 7, so x = 1 is an extraneous solution and should be discarded. Okay, so x = 1 is not a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check x = 5:\n\n5 = sqrt(11 - 2*5) + 4\n5 = sqrt(11 - 10) + 4\n5 = sqrt(1) + 4\n5 = 1 + 4\n5 = 5\n\nThat's true. So, x = 5 is a valid solution. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere, let me recap. I started with x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4, subtracted 4 to get x - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x), squared both sides to get (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x, expanded to x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x, simplified to x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0, factored to (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0, giving x = 1 and x = 5. Then, I checked both in the original equation, found that x = 1 didn't work, so only x = 5 is the solution.\n\nIs there any other possible solution that I missed? Let me think. Sometimes, when you square both sides, you might introduce a root that was already there, but since the original equation had a square root, which by definition is non-negative, I also need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative for the solution to be valid.\n\nSo, for the original equation, the expression inside sqrt(11 - 2"

            "output": "x) must be greater than or equal to zero. So, 11 - 2x >= 0, which means 2x <= 11, so x <= 5.5.\n\nSince we found x = 5, which is less than 5.5, that's fine. What about x =1? Let's see, 11 - 2*1 = 9, which is positive, so sqrt(9) is 3, and 3 +4 is 7, which isn't equal to 1, so that was already checked.\n\nWait a second, is there a possibility of another solution? Let me consider the function f(x) = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4 and the line y = x. Maybe graphing them would help. The function f(x) is a decreasing function because as x increases, sqrt(11 - 2x) decreases. It starts at x= -5.5, but that's probably not in our domain. At x=5.5, f(x) becomes sqrt(0) +4 =4. So, at x=5.5, f(x)=4. But when x=5, f(x)=1+4=5.\n\nSo, the line y=x is a straight line with slope 1. At x=5, both lines meet at 5. What about x=1? f(1)=sqrt(9)+4=7, which is higher than 1, so the line y=x is below f(x) there. So, the two functions cross only once at x=5, which is consistent with the solution.\n\nTherefore, x=5 is the only solution.\n\nI think that's thorough. No mistakes detected in my reasoning. So, the only solution is x=5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), we start by isolating the square root term:\n\n\\[\nx - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x}\n\\]\n\nNext, we square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[\n(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\\]\n\n"
