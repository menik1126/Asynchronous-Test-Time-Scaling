Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the left side has four fractions, each with a quadratic denominator. The right side is a linear function of x, specifically 2010x - 4. I wonder if there's a substitution or transformation I can use to simplify this equation.\n\nSince all the denominators are quadratic and of the form \\(x^2 - n\\), maybe substituting \\(y = x^2\\) could help. Let me try that. Let me set:\n\n\\[\ny = x^2.\n\\]\n\nThen each denominator becomes \\(y - 1\\), \\(y - 2\\), \\(y - 3\\), and \\(y - 4\\) respectively. So the left side of the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay, so that simplifies the left side, but the right side is still in terms of x. I need to express everything in terms of y. Let me see if I can do that.\n\nGiven that \\(y = x^2\\), so x = sqrt(y) or x = -sqrt(y). However, since we are considering complex solutions, x can be any complex number, so sqrt(y) can be any complex number as well. I need to remember that when I find solutions for y, each solution for y will correspond to two solutions for x, except possibly when y is zero or some specific points, but in this case, denominators are up to 4, so y can be 1, 2, 3, 4, but x cannot be those values because they would make denominators undefined.\n\nWait, but actually, even though x cannot be 1, 2, 3, 4 in real numbers, in complex numbers, those points"

So those are excluded.\n\nBut back to the substitution. Since the right side is 2010x -4, which is in terms of x, not y. So maybe substitution is not straightforward here. Alternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying everything to a common denominator? But that might be complicated with four terms. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving all terms to one side and trying to find a common denominator? Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the left side as L and the right side as R. So:\n\nL - R = 0.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but combining all these terms into a single fraction would require a common denominator, which would be the product of all denominators: (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). That seems really messy. Maybe there's a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that the equation is a rational function equals a linear function. The left side is a sum of terms each of which is a constant over a quadratic, so the left side is a rational function with poles at x = ±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2. The right side is a linear function. So the equation is equivalent to a rational function minus a linear function equals zero, so the equation is a rational function equal to zero. The solutions are the roots of that rational function.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the sum of all complex solutions. In complex analysis, the sum of the roots of a rational function can be tricky because poles are not roots, but in this case, the equation is set to zero, so the roots are the solutions where the numerator is zero (excluding poles). So perhaps if I can write the equation as a polynomial equation, then the sum of the roots can be found via Vieta's formula"

Wait, (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) is degree 8, so when multiplied by (2010x -4), the right side becomes degree 9, which is one degree higher.\n\nTherefore, P(x) is degree 8, R(x) is degree 9, so P(x) - R(x) is a polynomial of degree 9.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, the left side is a sum of four terms, each of which, when multiplied by the denominator, becomes a term of degree 2*4=8, since each denominator is degree 2.

So R(x) is degree 9. Therefore, P(x) is degree 6, so P(x) - R(x) is degree 9. Therefore, the leading term is the leading term of -R(x). Let me see.\n\nLet me compute the leading term of R(x):\n\nThe leading term of (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) is x^8. Then multiplied by (2010x -4), so the leading term is 2010x * x^8 = 2010x^9. Therefore, R(x) has leading term 2010x^9. Therefore, P(x) - R(x) has leading term -2010x^9. The next term would be the next term of R(x) minus the leading term of P(x). But since P(x) is degree 6, its leading term is of degree 6, so when subtracted from R(x)'s leading terms, the degree 9 term remains. Therefore, the polynomial equation is of degree 9, with leading coefficient -2010.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all roots is equal to - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9).

Let me actually think about the polynomial P(x) - R(x):\n\nP(x) is of degree 6, so its highest degree term is, say, c6 x^6.

However, this substitution complicates the right-hand side, so we instead multiply both sides by the common denominator \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). This transforms the equation into a polynomial equation.\n\nThe left-hand side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4),\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3).\n\\]\n\nThe right-hand side becomes:\n\n\\[\n(2010x - 4)(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).\n\\]\n\nLet \\( A(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \\).
