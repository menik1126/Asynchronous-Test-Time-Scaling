Let me think. The left side has four fractions with denominators that are quadratic in \\(x\\). The right side is linear in \\(x\\). Since it's a complex equation, I guess I need to consider complex solutions as well, but maybe the process is similar to solving polynomial equations.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes when equations have multiple terms like this, substitution might help. Let me see if I can make a substitution to simplify the equation.\n\nLet me denote \\( y = x^2 \\). Wait, but each denominator has \\(x^2 - k\\), so if \\( y = x^2 \\), then each denominator becomes \\( y - k \\). That might not directly help, but let's try.\n\nIf I let \\( y = x^2 \\), then the left side can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\]\n\nThat does look a bit cleaner. So the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nBut wait, \\( y = x^2 \\), so the right side is still in terms of \\(x\\). Hmm, so maybe substitution isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators. Let's see, but since we have multiple terms, cross-multiplying might complicate things because I would have a product of all denominators on one side and the other terms on the other side.\n\nWait, another thought: since each term on the left is of the form \\( \\frac{k}{x^2 -"

But I don't think that's helpful here.\n\nWait a second, maybe if I let \\( t = x \\), then rearrange the equation to get a polynomial equation? Let's try moving everything to one side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow, to combine all these terms into a single equation, I need to express the fractions with a common denominator. But the denominators are \\( x^2 -1 \\), \\(x^2 -2\\), \\(x^2 -3 \\), \\(x^2 -4 \\). So the common denominator would be the product of all four denominators. That seems really big and messy. Maybe that's not the best approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps analyzing the behavior of both sides. The left side is a sum of terms each tending to zero as \\( x \\) becomes very large in magnitude, since each denominator is quadratic. The right side, when \\( x \\) is very large, the term \\(2010x\\) dominates. So the left side tends to zero as \\(x \\to \\infty\\) or \\(x \\to -\\infty\\), so the only solutions must be near where 2010x -4 is close to zero, but that might not be directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is symmetry in the equation, or maybe substituting \\(x = 0\\) to see if that's a solution? Wait, plugging x=0:\n\nLeft side: 1/(-1) + 2/(-2) + 3/(-3) +4/(-4) = -1 -1 -1 -1 = -4\n\nRight side: 2010*0 -4 = -4.\n\nOh! So x=0 is a solution"

Let me check.\n\nAt x=0, the denominators are -1, -2, -3, -4, which are all non-zero, so yes, x=0 is allowed.\n\nSo x=0 is a solution. What about other possible solutions?\n\nHmm.\n\nSo maybe if I look for solutions, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the equation again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} + 4 - 2010x = 0.\n\\]\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a substitution that can make this a quadratic or something solvable. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote \\( z = x^2 \\). Then, each denominator is \\( z -k \\), but again, the right side is in terms of x, so that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiplying both sides by the product of all denominators to eliminate them.\n\nLet me see: The denominators are \\(x^2 -1\\), \\(x^2 -2\\), \\(x^2 -3\\), \\(x^2 -4\\). So the product would be \\( (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) \\). Let's denote that as \\( D \\).

Let me think again.\n\nWait, the left side is a function of \\(x^2\\), so it's even in x, but the right side is an odd function (since it's 2010x -4). Hmm, so the equation is not symmetric, but maybe if I consider that the left side is even, so if x is a solution, then -x might not be a solution unless the right side is also even, but it's not. So that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation can be transformed into a polynomial equation in x, and then we can use Vieta's formula to find the sum of roots without solving for each root.\n\nBut to do that, I need to know the degree of the polynomial. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I multiply both sides by the denominators. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote the left-hand side (LHS) as:\n\nLHS = 1/(x² -1) + 2/(x² -2) + 3/(x² -3) +4/(x² -4)\n\nLet me set LHS = RHS = 2010x -4.\n\nMultiply both sides by the common denominator, which is (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4). Let me denote this as D.\n\nSo:\n\nD * LHS = D*(2010x -4)\n\nThen, expanding the left side:\n\nEach term in LHS when multiplied by D will cancel one denominator. For example, the first term 1/(x² -1) multiplied by D gives (x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4). Similarly, the second term gives 2*(x² -1)(x² -3)(x² -4), etc.\n\nTherefore, the left side becomes:\n\n(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4) + 2(x² -1)(x² -3)(x² -4) + 3(x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -4) +4(x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)\n\nAnd the right side is (2010x -4)*D.\n\nTherefore, moving everything to the left side:\n\nLeft Side - Right Side = 0:\n\n[ (x² -2)("

So each of the four terms is degree 6, so the left side is a sum of degree 6 terms. The right side, which is (2010x -4)*D, is degree 9, since D is degree 8 and multiplied by x gives degree 9.\n\nTherefore, when moving everything to the left side, we have:\n\nLeft Side - Right Side = [degree 6] - [degree 9] = degree 9 polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the equation is a degree 9 polynomial equation.\n\nBut that's quite high. Solving a degree 9 equation is not trivial. But the question only asks for the sum of all complex solutions.\n\nAh, that's a good point. By Vieta's formula, the sum of roots of a polynomial is equal to - coefficient of x^8 divided by coefficient of x^9.\n\nSo if I can write the polynomial equation in the form:\n\nP(x) = a_9 x^9 + a_8 x^8 + ... + a_0 = 0\n\nThen the sum of all roots is -a_8 / a_9.\n\nSo I need to find the coefficients a_8 and a_9 in the expanded polynomial.\n\nTherefore, let me try to compute the coefficients a_9 and a_8.\n\nFirst, a_9 comes from the highest degree term in the equation. Since the highest degree term comes from the right side (2010x -4)*D, and the left side can't contribute any higher degree.\n\nSo let me expand (2010x -4)*D.\n\nFirst, D is ("

But since the problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions, maybe Vieta's approach is the only feasible way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a trick here. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose I let f(x) = LHS - RHS = 0.\n\nWe can note that f(-x) = LHS(-x) - RHS(-x). Since LHS is even (because x is squared in denominators), so LHS(-x) = LHS(x). RHS(-x) = -2010x -4. Therefore, f(-x) = LHS(x) - (-2010x -4) = LHS(x) +2010x +4. Which is not related to f(x). So no symmetry here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be rewritten as:\n\nSum_{k=1}^4 [k/(x² -k)] = 2010x -4.\n\nHmm, but I don't see an immediate pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that each term k/(x² -k) can be written as -k/(k -x²) = - [k/( (sqrt(k) -x)(sqrt(k)+x) ) ]\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the left side is a function of x², so let me set y =x², then the left side becomes:\n\n1/(y-1) + 2/(y-2) + 3/(y-3) +4/(y-4).\n\nLet me denote this as S(y) = sum_{k=1}^4 [k/(y -k)].\n\nThen the equation becomes S(y) = 2010x -4.\n\nBut since y =x², this is a relation between y and x. So, perhaps we can consider this as a system:\n\ny =x²,\n\nS(y) =2010x -4.\n\nBut solving this system might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for each solution x (except the excluded ones), there is a corresponding y =x², so maybe"
