            "output": "First, I need to determine the original volume of the cube. The volume \\( V \\) of a cube is calculated by multiplying its side length \\( s \\) by itself three times, so \\( V = s^3 \\).\n\nNext, I should find the relationship between the radius of the steel sphere and the cube's side length. The radius \\( r \\) of the sphere is given as 3 inches. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere will be equal to the side length of the cube. The diameter \\( d \\) of the sphere is twice the radius, which is \\( d = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) inches.\n\nNow, I can set the side length of the cube \\( s \\) equal to the diameter of the sphere. Therefore, \\( s \\) is 6 inches.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the volume of the cube using the side length of 6 inches. Plugging this into the volume formula: \\( V = 6^3 = 216 \\) cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the volume of the cube step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube**\n\n- **Given:**\n  - The steel sphere has a **radius** of **3 inches**.\n  - The sphere is formed by removing metal from the corners of a cube.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Diameter of the Sphere**\n\n- **Diameter** (\\( d \\)) of the sphere is twice the radius.\n  \n  \\[\n  d = 2r = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Sphere's Diameter to the Cube's Side Length**\n\n- When a sphere is inscribed inside a cube, its diameter is equal to the side length of the cube.\n\n  \\[\n  \\text{Side length of the cube} = d = 6 \\text{ inches}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Cube**\n\n- The volume (\\( V \\)) of a cube is given by the formula:\n\n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3\n  \\]\n\n- Substitute the side length of the cube into the formula:\n\n  \\[\n  V_{\\text{cube}} = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer"
