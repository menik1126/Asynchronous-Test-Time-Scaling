The sphere's radius is related to its diameter, which is twice the radius, so the diameter is 6 inches.\n\nThe corners of a cube are formed by three edges meeting at a right angle, so each corner can be thought of as a right-angled triangle. When a corner is removed to create a sphere, it effectively removes a portion of the cube, and the sphere's diameter corresponds to the distance from one corner to the opposite corner in the cube.\n\nSince all edges of the cube are equal, the distance from one corner to the opposite corner (space diagonal) is equal to the diameter of the sphere. Therefore, the space diagonal of the cube equals the sphere's diameter, which is 6 inches.\n\nThe formula for the space diagonal (d) of a cube with side length (s) is d = s√3. By setting d equal to 6 inches, I can solve for s:\n\n6 = s√3\n\nThen, solving for s gives:\n\ns = 6 / √3\n\nTo simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by √3 to rationalize the denominator:\n\ns = (6√3) / 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ns = 2√3 inches\n\nNow that I have the side length of the cube, I can calculate its volume using the formula for the volume of a cube, V = s³.\n\nV = (2√3)³\n\nCalculating this:\n\n(2√3)³ = 8 * (√3)³\n\nSince (√3)³ = 3√3, this becomes:\n\nV = 8 * 3√3 = 24√3 cubic inches\n\nTherefore, the volume of the original cube is 24√3 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from its corners, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube:**\n   - The sphere is formed by removing material from the corners (vertices) of the cube.\n   - The diameter of the sphere corresponds to the space diagonal of the cube.\n\n2. **Calculate the Space Diagonal of the Cube:**\n   - The sphere's radius is 3"
