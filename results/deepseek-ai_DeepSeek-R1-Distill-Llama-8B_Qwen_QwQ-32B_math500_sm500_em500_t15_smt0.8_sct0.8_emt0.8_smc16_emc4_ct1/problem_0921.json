The goal is to find the combination that results in the smallest possible sum.\n\nOne effective way is to pair the smallest prime factor, 2, with the largest one, 7, to form 14 (2 × 7). This leaves the remaining prime factors as 2 and 3, which can be combined to form 6 (2 × 3).\n\nSo, the set of integers is 6, 14, and 3. Calculating their sum:\n6 + 14 + 3 = 23\n\nI'll verify if there's a more optimal grouping. If I try other groupings, such as 2, 3, 14, it results in the same sum of 23. Other combinations either do not produce a smaller sum or do not maintain the product equal to 84.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84 is 23.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84 into its prime components:**\n   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   or in exponent form:\n   \\[\n   84 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Group the prime factors into distinct integers:**\n   - To minimize the sum, pair smaller factors with larger ones strategically.\n   - Consider the factor pairings:\n     - \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n   - This grouping results in the set of integers: \\(6, 14, 3\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the sum:**\n   \\[\n   6 + 14 + "
