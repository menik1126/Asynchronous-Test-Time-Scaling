            "output": "To determine the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime components.\n\nFirst, 84 can be divided by 2, giving 42. Dividing 42 by 2 again results in 21. Next, 21 is divided by 3 to yield 7, and finally, 7 is a prime number itself.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 84 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nNow, I need to combine these prime factors into distinct positive integers such that their product remains 84. My goal is to minimize the sum of these integers.\n\nOne possible combination is {2, 3, 7}. Their product is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 = 84, and their sum is 2 + 3 + 7 = 12.\n\nAnother combination could be {4, 3, 7}. Here, 4 is 2\u00b2, and the product remains 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 = 84. The sum in this case is 4 + 3 + 7 = 14, which is higher than 12.\n\nAdditionally, {6, 7, 2} gives a product of 6 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 2 = 84, but the sum is 6 + 7 + 2 = 15, which is even higher.\n\nConsidering all possible groupings, the set {2, 3, 7} provides the smallest sum of 12.\n\nTherefore, the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84 is 12.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 84:**\n   \n   First, we factorize 84 into its prime components.\n   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   \n   We need to combine these prime factors into distinct positive integers such that their product equals 84. Our goal is to minimize the sum of these integers.\n\n3. **Possible Combinations:**\n   \n   Let's consider different ways to group the prime factors while keeping the integers distinct.\n   \n   - **Option 1:** \\(2, 3, 7\\)\n     \\"
