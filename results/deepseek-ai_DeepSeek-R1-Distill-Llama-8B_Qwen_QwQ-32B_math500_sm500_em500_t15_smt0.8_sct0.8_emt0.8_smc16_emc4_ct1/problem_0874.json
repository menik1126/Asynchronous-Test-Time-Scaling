            "output": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to combine these square roots into a single fraction. The expression given is sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) + 1/sqrt(3). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated with all the square roots in the denominators. I remember from algebra that when you have terms like a/sqrt(b), it might help to rationalize the denominator. Rationalizing usually means getting rid of the square root in the denominator. So maybe I should do that for each term.\n\nStarting with sqrt(2), that's straightforward—it's just sqrt(2). The next term is 1/sqrt(2). To rationalize that, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(2). So, 1/sqrt(2) becomes (sqrt(2)/2). That makes sense because sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, so 1/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSimilarly, for sqrt(3), it's just sqrt(3). The last term is 1/sqrt(3). Rationalizing that as well, I multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3), so 1/sqrt(3) becomes sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, so if I rewrite all the terms after rationalizing, the expression becomes sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/3. Cool, now all the denominators are rational. Now, I can try to combine the like terms. Let's group the sqrt(2) terms together and the sqrt(3) terms together.\n\nFor sqrt(2), I have sqrt(2) (which is like 1*sqrt(2)) and sqrt(2)/2. To combine those, I need a common denominator. The first term can be thought of as 2*sqrt(2)/2, so that's 2/2 * sqrt(2). Then adding sqrt(2)/2 gives (2 + 1)/2 * sqrt(2) = 3/2 * sqrt(2).\n\nNow for sqrt(3), I have sqrt(3) and sqrt(3)/3. Again, the first term is like 3*sqrt(3)/3, so adding sqrt(3)/3 gives 4/3 * sqrt(3).\n\nSo now, the entire expression simplifies to ("

The problem wants this written as (a*sqrt(2) + b*sqrt(3))/c, where a, b, c are positive integers and c is as small as possible. \n\nHmm, so right now, the expression is two terms with different denominators. To combine them into a single fraction, I need to find a common denominator for the coefficients. The denominators here are 2 and 3. The least common denominator (LCD) of 2 and 3 is 6. So I can rewrite each term with denominator 6.\n\nStarting with (3/2)*sqrt(2): multiplying numerator and denominator by 3 gives (9/6)*sqrt(2). \n\nFor (4/3)*sqrt(3): multiplying numerator and denominator by 2 gives (8/6)*sqrt(3).\n\nSo now, the expression is (9*sqrt(2) + 8*sqrt(3))/6. \n\nWait, let me check that again. \n\nWait, actually, if I have (3/2)*sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(2))/2, and (4/3)*sqrt(3) = (4*sqrt(3))/3. To combine them over a common denominator of 6, I need to adjust each fraction:\n\nFirst term: (3*sqrt(2))/2 = (3*sqrt(2) * 3)/6 = 9*sqrt(2)/6\n\nSecond term: (4*sqrt(3))/3 = (4*sqrt(3)*2)/6 = 8*sqrt(3)/6\n\nAdding them together gives (9*sqrt(2) + 8*sqrt(3))/6. \n\nSo that's in the form (a*sqrt(2) + b*sqrt(3))/c where a = 9, b = 8, and c = 6. \n\nBut the problem says that c should be as small as possible. Let me check if 6 is indeed the smallest possible denominator. Since 9 and 8 are in the numerators, do they have any common factors with 6?\n\nLooking at the numerator terms: 9 and 8. The coefficients 9 and 8 are coprime (their GCD is 1). The denominator is 6. Since 9"

            "output": " and 6 share a common factor of 3, and 8 and 6 share a common factor of 2, but since 9 is multiplied by sqrt(2) and 8 by sqrt(3), and sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are different radicals, we can't combine them further. So I think 6 is indeed the smallest possible denominator.\n\nTherefore, a = 9, b = 8, c = 6. So adding them together gives 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake when rationalizing or combining the fractions.\n\nOriginal terms: sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) + 1/sqrt(3)\n\nRationalize each term:\n\nsqrt(2) stays as sqrt(2).\n\n1/sqrt(2) becomes sqrt(2)/2.\n\nsqrt(3) stays as sqrt(3).\n\n1/sqrt(3) becomes sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSo, combining sqrt(2) terms: sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(2)*(1 + 1/2) = sqrt(2)*(3/2) = (3/2)sqrt(2).\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(3) terms: sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/3 = sqrt(3)*(1 + 1/3) = sqrt(3)*(4/3).\n\nThus, the expression is (3/2)sqrt(2) + (4/3)sqrt(3). \n\nNow, to combine over a common denominator. LCD of 2 and 3 is 6. So:\n\n(3/2)sqrt(2) = (9/6)sqrt(2)\n\n(4/3)sqrt(3) = (8/6)sqrt(3)\n\nAdding together: (9sqrt(2) + 8sqrt(3))/6. \n\nYup, that's correct. So c is 6, which is minimal because 9 and 8 don't have any common factors with 6 that would allow a smaller denominator. \n\nTherefore, a=9, b=8, c=6. So a+b+c=9+8+6=23.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) + 1/sqrt"
