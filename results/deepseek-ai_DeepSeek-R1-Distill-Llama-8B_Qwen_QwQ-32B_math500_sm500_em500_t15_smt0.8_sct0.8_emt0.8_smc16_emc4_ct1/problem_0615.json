Then, dividing 98 by 2 again gives me 49. Since 49 is a perfect square, it can be expressed as 7 squared.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared, which is written as \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nNext, I will use the divisor multiplication rule. For each prime factor, I add 1 to its exponent and then multiply these together. \n\nFor the prime number 2 with an exponent of 2, adding 1 gives me 3. For 7, also with an exponent of 2, adding 1 gives me 3 as well.\n\nMultiplying these together, I get \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\). Therefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of 196.**\n   \n   - 196 is an even number, so divide by 2:\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n     \n   - 98 is also even, so divide by 2 again:\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n     \n   - 49 is a perfect square, and its prime factor is 7:\n     \\[\n     49 = 7^2\n     \\]\n     \n   - Combining these, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n     \\[\n     196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Use the formula for finding the number of divisors.**\n   \n   - If a number \\( N \\) has the prime factorization \\( N = p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\dots \\times p_n^{k} \\), the number of positive divisors of \\( N \\) is:\n     \\[\n     (a + 1)(b + 1)\\dots(k + 1)\n     \\]\n   \n   - Applying this to 196:\n     \\[\n     196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n    "
