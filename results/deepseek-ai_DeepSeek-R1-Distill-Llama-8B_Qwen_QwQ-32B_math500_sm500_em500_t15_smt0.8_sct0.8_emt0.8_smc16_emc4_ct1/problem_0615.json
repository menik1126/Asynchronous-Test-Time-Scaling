            "output": "First, I need to find the prime factorization of 196. I'll start by dividing 196 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 196 is even, it divides evenly by 2.\n\nSo, 196 ÷ 2 = 98. I'll continue dividing by 2 until it's no longer possible. 98 ÷ 2 = 49, and 49 is not divisible by 2.\n\nNext, I'll move to the next prime number, which is 3. 49 ÷ 3 is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor.\n\nThen, I'll check the next prime number, 5, but 49 ÷ 5 is also not a whole number.\n\nFinally, I'll try dividing by 7. 49 ÷ 7 = 7. Now, 7 is a prime number, so I'll stop here.\n\nFrom the prime factorization, 196 = 2² × 7².\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, if a number has a prime factorization of (a^n)(b^m)(c^k)..., the total number of divisors is (n+1)(m+1)(k+1)... .\n\nApplying this formula: (2+1)(2+1) = 3 × 3 = 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - Start by dividing 196 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n   - 196 ÷ 2 = 98\n   - 98 ÷ 2 = 49\n   - 49 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number.\n   - 49 ÷ 7 = 7\n   - 7 is a prime number, so we stop here.\n   \n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Divisors**:\n   - For a number in the form \\( N = p^a \\times q^b \\times r^c \\ldots \\), the total number of positive divisors is given by:\n     \\"
