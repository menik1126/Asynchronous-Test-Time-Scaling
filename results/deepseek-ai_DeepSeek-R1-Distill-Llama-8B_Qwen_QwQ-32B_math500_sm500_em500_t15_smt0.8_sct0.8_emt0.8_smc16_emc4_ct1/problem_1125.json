            "output": "Okay, let's try to figure out how long the hallway is. Hmm, the problem says the robot is moving at a constant speed. That probably means I can use some basic kinematics here, like speed equals distance over time or something like that.\n\nFirst, the robot takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer. Wait, 2.5 hours for 1 km? That's pretty slow. Let me convert that into a more manageable unit, like meters per second, because the hallway time is given in seconds.\n\nSo, speed is distance divided by time. The distance is 1 kilometer, which is 1000 meters. Time is 2.5 hours. But I need the speed in meters per second, so I have to convert hours to seconds. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so 60*60=3600 seconds in an hour.\n\nTherefore, speed = distance / time = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds. Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 3600 is the same as 10/36, which simplifies to 5/18 m/s. So, the robot's speed is 5/18 meters per second.\n\nNow, the robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway. To find the length of the hallway, I can use the same speed formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. So, distance = (5/18 m/s) * 90 s.\n\nLet me compute that. 5 times 90 is 450, and 450 divided by 18. Hmm, 18 times 25 is 450, right? So, 450/18 is 25. Therefore, the hallway is 25 meters long.\n\nWait, let me double-check. 5/18 m/s for 90 seconds is indeed 5/18 *90. 90 divided by 18 is 5, and 5*5 is 25. Yep, that makes sense. So the hallway is 25 meters long.\n</think>\n\nThe robot travels at a constant speed. First, calculate its speed in meters per second. Then, use that speed to determine the hallway's length.\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 1 km / 2.5 hours = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds = 5/18 m/s.\n\nLength of hallway = Speed × Time = (5/18 m"
