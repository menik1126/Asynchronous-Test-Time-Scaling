To find the speed in meters per second, I'll convert kilometers to meters and hours to seconds.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. This will give me the speed in meters per second, which I can then use to find the length of the hallway.\n\nFinally, with the speed known, I'll use the time it takes to travel the hallway length and the speed to calculate the distance of the hallway by multiplying speed by time.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the length of the hallway based on the given information. Let's follow the steps below.\n\n1. **Determine the Robot's Speed:**\n   \n   The robot travels **1 kilometer** in **2.5 hours**. \n   \n   - **Convert the speed to meters per second:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1\\, \\text{km}}{2.5\\, \\text{hours}} = \\frac{1000\\, \\text{meters}}{2.5\\, \\text{hours}} = 400\\, \\text{meters/second}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Length of the Hallway:**\n   \n   The robot travels the length of the hallway at the same speed, and it takes **90 seconds** to do so.\n   \n   - **Convert seconds to hours:**\n     \\[\n     90\\, \\text{seconds} = \\frac{90}{60} = 1.5\\, \\text{hours}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Use the speed to find the distance (length of the hallway):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 400\\, \\text{meters/second} \\times 1.5\\, \\text{hours} = 600\\, \\text{meters}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe hallway is \\(\\boxed{600}\\) meters long."
