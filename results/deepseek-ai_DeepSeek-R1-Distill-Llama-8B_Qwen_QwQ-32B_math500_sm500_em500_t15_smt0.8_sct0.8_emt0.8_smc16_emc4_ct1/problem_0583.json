            "output": "First, I need to simplify the equation by distributing the multiplication inside the parentheses: 5 squared becomes 25, and 4 times (5 minus a) squared remains as is.\n\nNext, I'll handle the division by 3. Dividing each term by 3 will give me an equivalent equation that's easier to work with.\n\nAfter simplifying, the equation becomes 25 minus (4 times (5 minus a) squared) divided by 3 equals 63.\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply every term in the equation by 3. This will clear the denominator and make the numbers more manageable.\n\nNow the equation is 75 minus 4 times (5 minus a) squared equals 189. I'll move the 75 to the other side to isolate the term with the squared variable.\n\nSubtracting 75 from both sides gives me -4 times (5 minus a) squared equals 114. I'll divide both sides by -4 to simplify further.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for (5 minus a) squared by taking the square root of both sides. This will give me the values that 5 minus a can take. Solving for a afterward will provide the solutions to the equation.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{5^2 - 4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n\\]\n\n1. **Simplify \\(5^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   5^2 = 25\n   \\]\n   The equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{25 - 4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by 3:**\n   \\[\n   25 - 4(5 - a)^2 = 189\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate \\(4(5 - a)^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   -4(5 - a)^2 = 189 - 25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -4(5 - a)^2 = 164\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (5 - a)^2 = -\\frac{164}{4} = -41\n   \\]\n\n4. **Take the square root of both sides:**\n   \\[\n   5 - a = \\pm \\sqrt{-41}\n   \\]\n"
