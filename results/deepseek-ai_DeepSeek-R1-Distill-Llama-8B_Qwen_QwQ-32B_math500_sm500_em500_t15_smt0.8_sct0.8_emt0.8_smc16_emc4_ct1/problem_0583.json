It looks like it's written in a way that might be a bit confusing with that (3) at the beginning. Maybe it's a typo or something. Let me rewrite it without the (3) just to see if it makes more sense. So, it would be 3 times 5 squared minus 4 times (5 - a) squared divided by 3 equals 63. \n\nWait, actually, maybe the (3) is part of the exponent or something. Maybe it's 3^5? Because 5 squared without the parentheses could be 5², but with the (3), maybe it's 3 to the power of 5? Hmm, the original problem is written as (3)5², which is a bit unclear. Let me think. If it's 3^5, that's 243. If it's 5 squared, that's 25. Let me check the context. The equation is 3*5² - 4*(5 - a)²/3 = 63. That seems more likely because if it's 3^5, the equation would be way bigger. So I'll proceed with 3*(5)^2, which is 3*25=75.\n\nOkay, so the equation is 75 - [4*(5 - a)²]/3 = 63. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, I have 75 minus something equals 63. So I can subtract 75 from both sides to isolate that something. Let me do that:\n\n75 - [4*(5 - a)²]/3 = 63  \nSubtract 75 from both sides:  \n- [4*(5 - a)²]/3 = 63 - 75  \nCalculating the right side: 63 - 75 is -12. So,  \n- [4*(5 - a)²]/3 = -12\n\nNow, to make it positive, I can multiply both sides by -1:  \n[4*(5 - a)²]/3 = 12\n\nNext, I want to get rid of the denominator 3. I'll multiply both sides by 3:  \n4*(5 - a)² = 36"

To solve for (5 - a), we take the square root of both sides. Remember, square roots can be positive or negative, so:\n\n5 - a = ±√9  \n√9 is 3, so:  \n5 - a = ±3\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n\n1) 5 - a = 3  \n2) 5 - a = -3\n\nLet's solve each one separately.\n\nStarting with the first equation:  \n5 - a = 3  \nSubtract 5 from both sides:  \n- a = 3 - 5  \n- a = -2  \nMultiply both sides by -1:  \na = 2\n\nSecond equation:  \n5 - a = -3  \nSubtract 5 from both sides:  \n- a = -3 -5  \n- a = -8  \nMultiply by -1:  \na = 8\n\nSo the solutions are a = 2 and a = 8. The question asks for the sum of the values of a. So 2 + 8 = 10. Therefore, the sum is 10.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the original equation:\n\n3*(5)^2 - 4*(5 - a)^2 /3 = 63  \nYes, 3*25 is 75. Then subtract [4*(5 -a)^2 divided by 3]. So 75 - (4*(5 -a)^2)/3 =63. Then subtract 75, get - (4*(5 -a)^2)/3 = -12. Multiply both sides by -1 gives (4*(5 -a)^2)/3 =12. Multiply by 3: 4*(5 -a)^2 =36. Divide by 4: (5 -a)^2=9. Square roots: 5 -a=±3. Then solving gives a=2 and a=8. Sum is 10. That seems right.\n\nHmm, but let me check if I interpreted the original equation correctly. The problem was written as (3)5² -4(5 -a)^2"

Let me verify that.\n\nIf (5 - a)^2=135, then the two solutions are 5 -a=√135 and 5 -a=-√135, so a=5 -√135 and a=5 +√135.\n\nTherefore, adding them together: (5 -√135)+(5 +√135)=10.

So the answer is 10 either way.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the original equation was written as (3)5², which looks like (3 multiplied by 5 squared). But perhaps it's 3^5.

Let me clarify.\n\nIn the original problem, it's written as (3)5². Maybe the parentheses are just indicating the order of operations, so 3 multiplied by 5 squared. So 3*(5^2)=3*25=75. So the equation is 75 - [4*(5 -a)^2]/3=63.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 3^5, that's 243, which is also a possibility because sometimes people write exponents without caret symbols. Since the equation could make sense either way but the sum is 10 in both cases, perhaps the problem is intended to have the sum as 10 regardless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by computing both cases.\n\nFirst case: 3*(5)^2:\n\nEquation: 75 - [4*(5 -a)^2]/3=63  \nSo solving as before, we get a=2 and a=8, sum is 10.\n\nSecond case: 3^5=243:\n\nEquation: 243 - [4*(5 -a)^2]/3=63  \nSo solving that: 243 - something=63, subtract 243, something=180.\n\nSo [4*(5 -a)^2]/3=180, leading to (5 -a)^2=135, a=5±√135, sum is 10.\n\nSo in both cases, the sum is 10.\n\nHmm, that's interesting.
