I'm a bit rusty on logarithms, but I think I can work through this.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations again to make sure I have them right.\n\nEquation 1: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2\n\nEquation 2: log_y(5x) = 2\n\nAlright, so there are two equations with two variables: x and y. I need to solve for x, so maybe I can express y in terms of x or find a relationship between them.\n\nStarting with Equation 1. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product. So log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(ac). Applying that here:\n\nlog₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\nNow, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, so it simplifies to x² - y². So the equation becomes:\n\nlog₆(x² - y²) = 2\n\nTo get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that:\n\n6² = x² - y²\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n36 = x² - y²\n\nOkay, so that's Equation 1 simplified: x² - y² = 36.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 2: log_y(5x) = 2\n\nAgain, I'll convert this logarithmic equation to exponential form. So, y² = 5x, because log_y(5x) = 2 implies y^2 = 5x.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. x² - y² = 36\n\n2. y² = 5x\n\nHmm, so from Equation 2, I can substitute y² in Equation 1. Let's do that.\n\nSubstitute y² with 5x in Equation 1:\n\nx² - (5x"

            "output": ") = 36\n\nSo that becomes:\n\nx² - 5x - 36 = 0\n\nWait, that's a quadratic equation in terms of x. I can try to factor this, or if that doesn't work, use the quadratic formula.\n\nLet me attempt to factor x² - 5x - 36.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nLet me try  -9 and 4. Because -9 * 4 = -36, and -9 + 4 = -5. Yeah, that works.\n\nSo the quadratic factors as:\n\n(x - 9)(x + 4) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 9 = 0 ⇒ x = 9\n\nx + 4 = 0 ⇒ x = -4\n\nBut wait, I need to check if these solutions make sense in the original equations, especially because we have log functions which require their arguments to be positive.\n\nFirst, x can't be negative because in Equation 2, log_y(5x) is defined only if 5x > 0, so x must be positive. So x = -4 is invalid.\n\nSo the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nLet me confirm this by plugging back into Equation 2: y² = 5x.\n\nIf x = 9, then y² = 5 * 9 = 45. So y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But y is also in the arguments of logarithms in Equation 1, so y must be positive because x - y and x + y must be positive.\n\nTherefore, y = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, check Equation 1: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2.\n\nCompute (x - y) and (x + y):\n\nx = 9, y = 3√5.\n\nx - y = 9 - 3√5\n\nx + y = 9 + 3√5\n\nSo, log₆(9 - 3√5) + log₆(9 + 3√5) should equal 2"
