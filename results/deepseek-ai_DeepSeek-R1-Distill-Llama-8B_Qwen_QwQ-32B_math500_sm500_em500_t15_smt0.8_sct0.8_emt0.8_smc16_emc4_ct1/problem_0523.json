            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: simplify (1 + √2) / (2 + √3). Hmm, I remember that when you have radicals in the denominator, you often rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate flips the sign between the terms, so in this case, the conjugate of 2 + √3 would be 2 - √3. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, write down the expression:\n(1 + √2) / (2 + √3)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):\n[(1 + √2)(2 - √3)] / [(2 + √3)(2 - √3)]\n\nNow, I need to multiply out the numerators and denominators. Let's start with the numerator.\n\nNumerator expansion:\n(1)(2) + (1)(-√3) + (√2)(2) + (√2)(-√3)\nThat's 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6\n\nSo, numerator becomes:\n2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6\n\nDenominator expansion:\n(2)(2) + (2)(-√3) + (√3)(2) + (√3)(-√3)\nWhich is 4 - 2√3 + 2√3 - 3\n\nWait, the -2√3 and +2√3 cancel each other out, so we have 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nSo denominator is 1, which is nice because it simplifies the fraction.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6\n\nHmm, now the problem mentions expressing the solution in the form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D), where A, B, C, D are positive integers. Let me see how I can rearrange the terms to match this form.\n\nLet me write what I have:\n2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6\n\nI can group the constants and the radicals:\n(2) + (2√2) - (√3) - (√6)\n\nSo, 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6\n\nHmm, the expression is 2 + 2√2 minus √3 minus √6. Looking at the desired form, A(1 + √B"

Alternatively, maybe express it as 2(1 + √(something)) minus other radicals.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nWe have 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6.\n\nLet me factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6). That looks closer to the desired form.\n\nYes, that's exactly the form! So,\n\n2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6)\n\nComparing this to the desired form A(1 + √B) - (√C + √D):\n\n- A is 2\n- B is 2\n- C is 3\n- D is 6\n\nSo, A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6.\n\nTherefore, A + B + C + D = 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with (1 + √2)/(2 + √3), I multiplied numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):\n\n(1 + √2)(2 - √3) = 1*2 + 1*(-√3) + √2*2 + √2*(-√3) = 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6\n\nDenominator: (2 + √3)(2 - √3) = 4 - (√3)^2 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSo, numerator is 2 - √3 + 2√2 - √6.\n\nThen I grouped it as 2 + 2√2 - √3 - √6, which becomes 2(1 + √2) - (√3 + √6).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So A=2, B=2, C=3, D=6. Sum is 13.\n</think>\n\n$\\boxed{13}$\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator** to rationalize:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2-\\sqrt{3}}"
