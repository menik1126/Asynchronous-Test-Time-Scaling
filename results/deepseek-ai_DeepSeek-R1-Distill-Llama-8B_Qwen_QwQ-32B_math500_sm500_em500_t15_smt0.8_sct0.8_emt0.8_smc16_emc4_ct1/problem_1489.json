These primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I should determine which of these prime numbers are odd. Notably, all prime numbers except for 2 are odd.\n\nNow, I'll list the odd primes: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nFinally, to find the intersection, I count these odd primes, which totals 9 elements.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Set of Prime Numbers Less Than 30:**\n   \n   The prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Listing the prime numbers less than 30:\n   \n   \\[\n   2, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 23, \\ 29\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify the Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero:**\n   \n   All odd numbers greater than zero are:\n   \n   \\[\n   1, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 9, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 15, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 21, \\ 23, \\ 25, \\ 27, \\ 29, \\ \\dots\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Determine the Intersection:**\n   \n   The intersection of the two sets consists of the numbers that are both prime and odd. From the list of primes less than 30, exclude the only even prime, which is 2:\n   \n   \\[\n   3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 23, \\ 29\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Count the Intersection:**\n   \n   There are **9** numbers in the intersection.\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
