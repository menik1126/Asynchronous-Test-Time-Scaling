It asks for the number of elements in the intersection of two sets: the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero.\n\nNext, I'll identify the prime numbers less than 30. These are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nThen, I'll list all the odd numbers greater than zero. These are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29.\n\nNow, I'll find the intersection of these two sets by checking which numbers are common to both lists. The common numbers are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nFinally, I'll count the number of common elements, which are all the odd prime numbers less than 30.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Prime Numbers Less Than 30\nPrime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n\\[ 2, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 23, \\ 29 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero\nOdd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. All odd numbers greater than zero are:\n\\[ 1, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 9, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 15, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 21, \\ 23, \\ 25, \\ 27, \\ 29 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Intersection of the Two Sets\nThe intersection consists of the numbers that are in both lists. Comparing the two sets:\n- **Common prime numbers less than 30 and odd:** \\( 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ "
