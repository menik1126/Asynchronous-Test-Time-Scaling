            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h. Given that the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, the volume will be π times (3 cm) squared times 8 cm.\n\nNext, I'll find the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πR³. With a radius of 6 cm, the volume calculation will involve cubing the radius and then multiplying by (4/3)π.\n\nAfter calculating both volumes, I'll divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker to determine how many beakers are needed to fill the tank completely.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer, rounded to a reasonable number of decimal places, to provide the number of cylindrical beakers required.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker.**\n2. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.**\n3. **Divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker to find out how many beakers are required.**\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Volume of a Cylindrical Beaker\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{cylinder}} \\) of a cylinder is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( r \\) = radius of the cylinder (3 cm)\n- \\( h \\) = height of the cylinder (8 cm)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3\\,\\text{cm})^2 (8\\,\\text{cm}) = \\pi \\times 9\\,\\text{cm}^2 \\times 8\\,\\text{cm} = 72\\pi\\,\\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{72\\pi\\,\\text{cm}^3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Volume of the Spherical Tank\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) of a sphere is:\n\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R"
