I'll perform prime factorization on both the numerator and the denominator to identify their greatest common divisor (GCD). After simplifying, the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), which is already in its simplest form.\n\nNext, I'll divide the numerator by the denominator to convert the fraction into a decimal. Performing the division \\(31 \\div 11111\\) gives me a decimal of approximately \\(0.0028002280028...\\). This shows that the decimal is repeating, with the sequence \"0028\" repeating indefinitely.\n\nFinally, I'll identify the number of digits that repeat in the decimal. Observing the repeating part \"0028,\" I can see that four digits are cycling repeatedly. Therefore, the repeating decimal has four digits that repeat.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the repeating decimal of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   \n   First, check if the fraction can be simplified. The prime factors of 31 are \\(31\\) (since 31 is a prime number). For 11111:\n   \\[\n   11111 \\div 31 = 357.1295\\ldots \\quad (\\text{Not an integer})\n   \\]\n   Since 31 does not divide evenly into 11111, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n2. **Convert to Decimal**:\n   \n   Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111} \\approx 0.0028002280028\\ldots\n   \\]\n   The decimal repeats the sequence \"0028.\"\n\n3. **Identify the Repeating Digits**:\n   \n   Observe the repeating part of the decimal. In this case, the sequence \"0028\" repeats indefinitely.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Repeating Digits**:\n   \n   Count the number of digits in the repeating sequence:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Repeating digits: } 0028 \\quad (\\text{4 digits})\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{4}\\)"
