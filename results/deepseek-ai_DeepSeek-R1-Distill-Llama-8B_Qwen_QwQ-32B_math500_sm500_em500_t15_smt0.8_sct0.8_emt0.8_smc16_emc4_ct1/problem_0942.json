Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I'll count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of 2s. I'll divide 42 by 2, then by 4, then by 8, and so on until the division results in zero. Adding these up, I get 21 fives.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 5s. I'll divide 42 by 5, then by 25, and so on. This gives me 8 fives.\n\nSince there are 21 pairs of 2s and only 8 pairs of 5s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the smaller count, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** How many zeroes are at the end of \\( 42! \\) (42 factorial)?\n\n---\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\( 42! \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - \\( n! \\) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to \\( n \\). For example, \\( 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\).\n   - A trailing zero is produced by multiplying 2 and 5 (since \\( 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\)).\n\n2. **Count the Number of 5s in the Prime Factorization:**\n   - Divide \\( 42 \\) by 5: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\)\n   - There are **8** fives in the prime factors of \\( 42! \\).\n\n3. **Count the Number of 2s in the Prime Factorization:**\n   - Divide \\( 42 \\) by 2: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 21 \\)\n   - Divide 21 by 2: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{21}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 10 \\)\n   -"

Since there are fewer 5s (8) than 2s (40), the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{8}\\)"
