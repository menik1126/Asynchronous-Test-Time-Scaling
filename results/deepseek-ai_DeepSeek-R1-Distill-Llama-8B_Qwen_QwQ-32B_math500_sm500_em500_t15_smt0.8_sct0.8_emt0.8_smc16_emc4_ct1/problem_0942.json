            "output": "To determine how many trailing zeros are in 42!, I need to understand how factors of 10 are produced in the factorial.\n\nFirst, I recall that each trailing zero in a number results from multiplying 2 and 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 10 (which is 2 multiplied by 5) appears as a factor in the number.\n\nIn any factorial like 42!, there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5. This means the number of 5s will limit the number of 10s, and thus the number of trailing zeros.\n\nTo find the number of times 5 is a factor in 42!, I'll use the formula for finding the exponent of a prime number in a factorial:\n\n\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5^k} \\right\\rfloor\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0\n\nAdding these up: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nTherefore, there are 9 factors of 5 in 42!.\n\nSince there are more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of factors of 5, which is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many trailing zeros are in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in \\(42!\\). Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). Typically, there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, so the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \\(42!\\).\n\n**Step 1:** Use the formula for finding the exponent of a prime number in a factorial:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of 5s in } 42! = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor"
