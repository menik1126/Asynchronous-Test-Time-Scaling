Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are positive real numbers. That’s important because it tells me I don’t have to worry about negative values or zero, which can complicate things.\n\nThe condition given is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). I need to use this somehow to relate \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\). Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others or find a substitution that simplifies the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression I need to minimize, \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), it seems symmetrical in a way, but not entirely. It has more \\(y\\) terms than others. Maybe I can expand this expression to see if it simplifies.\n\nLet me try expanding \\((x + y)(y + z)\\):\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nSo, it becomes \\(xy + y^2 + yz + xz\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps immediately. Maybe I can factor or group terms differently. Wait, another approach is to use substitutions or maybe apply inequalities like AM-GM.\n\nSince AM-GM is often useful for optimization problems with products, let me try that. The AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\n\nBut before that, maybe I can manipulate the given condition to express one variable in terms of the others. Let's see:\n\nGiven \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), perhaps I can write \\(x + y + z = \\frac{1}{xyz}\\). That might be useful later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set \\(S = x + y + z\\), so \\(xyzS = 1\\). Then \\(S = \\frac{1}{xyz}\\). Hmm, but I'm not sure yet how to use this.\n\nLet me think about symmetry again. The expression to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). If I consider symmetry between \\(x\\) and \\(z\\),"
