            "output": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. It looks pretty challenging, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nSo, we have the equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). It's given that this equation has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The task is to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), the modulus squared is \\(r\\overline{r}\\). So, \\(|r|^2 = r\\overline{r}\\). That means \\(\\frac{1}{r\\overline{r}} = \\frac{1}{|r|^2}\\). So, the sum we're supposed to find is the sum of the reciprocals of the squared moduli of each pair of roots.\n\nSo, now I need to find \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_k|^2}\\).\n\nHmm, how can I relate the roots of the given equation to their moduli? Maybe I can use properties of polynomials and their roots. I recall that for a polynomial, the sum over roots can be related to the coefficients using Vieta's formulas. But here, we're dealing with sums of reciprocals of squared moduli, which might not be directly accessible through Vieta's.\n\nWait, maybe I can express \\(\\frac{1}{|r_k|^2}\\) in terms of the roots. Since \\(|r_k|^2 = r_k\\overline{r}_k\\), and since the polynomial has real coefficients, the complex roots come in conjugate pairs. That is, if \\(r_k\\) is a root, so is \\(\\overline{r}_k\\). So, each pair \\(r_k, \\overline{r}_k\\) contributes the same term to the sum, which is \\(\\frac"

Wait, each pair \\(r_k\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_k\\) gives the same modulus, so each term \\(\\frac{1}{|r_k|^2}\\) is counted once for each root in the pair. But since each \\(r_k\\) and its conjugate are both roots, each term is added twice. But in the original equation, there are 10 roots, grouped into 5 conjugate pairs. So, the sum is over all 10 roots, but each conjugate pair contributes two terms of \\(\\frac{1}{|r_k|^2}\\). Therefore, actually, the sum is \\(2\\left(\\frac{1}{|r_1|^2} + \\frac{1}{|r_2|^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{|r_5|^2}\\right)\\).\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me clarify. Each conjugate pair \\(r_k\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_k\\) contributes two roots to the polynomial. So, each pair \\(r_k\\) is a root, and its conjugate is another root. Therefore, when we sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_j \\overline{r}_j}\\) over all roots, it's equivalent to summing \\(\\frac{1}{|r_j|^2}\\) for each root. Since \\(r_j\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_j\\) both exist as roots, each pair contributes two terms each equal to \\(\\frac{1}{|r_j|^2}\\). So, the total sum would be \\(2 \\times \\frac{1}{|r_1|^2} + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{|r_2|^2} + \\cdots + 2 \\times \\frac{1}{|r_5|^2}\\). Therefore, the sum we need is \\(2\\left( \\frac{1}{|r_1|^"

So, each pair \\(r_k\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_k\\) is a root, so when we add \\(\\frac{1}{r_j \\overline{r}_j}\\) for each root, each pair contributes two terms, each equal to \\(\\frac{1}{|r_k|^2}\\). Therefore, the total sum is \\(2\\left( \\frac{1}{|r_1|^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{|r_5|^2} \\right)\\).\n\nWait, but maybe it's not quite that. Let me think again.\n\nEach root \\(r\\) contributes a term \\(\\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}} = \\frac{1}{|r|^2}\\). Since \\(r\\) and \\(\\overline{r}\\) are both roots, the sum over all roots would be \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{10} \\frac{1}{r_j \\overline{r}_j} = \\sum_{k=1}^{5} [\\frac{1}{|r_k|^2} + \\frac{1}{|\\overline{r}_k|^2}]\\). But \\(| \\overline{r}_k | = | r_k | \\), so this is equal to \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\frac{2}{|r_k|^2}\\). So, that matches with the earlier thought: the total sum is twice the sum over each conjugate pair.\n\nSo, our target is \\(2\\left( \\frac{1}{|r_1|^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{|r_5|^2} \\right)\\).\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find this sum, which is twice the sum of the reciprocals of the squared moduli of each pair of roots.\n\nTo find this, I might consider using Vieta's formula or properties of polynomials to relate the roots to the coefficients. Alternatively, maybe using the properties of the equation given to relate the roots.\n\nSo, the equation is \\(x^{10} +"

Let me denote P(x) = x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}. We can think of this as a degree 10 polynomial, so it has 10 roots (counting multiplicity). The roots are the ones we discussed.\n\nTo compute the sum over 1/(r_j \\overline{r}_j), which is the sum over 1/|r_j|^2, perhaps we can relate this to the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nRecall that for a polynomial with roots r_j, the sum over 1/r_j^2 can be related to the coefficients, but here it's the sum over 1/|r_j|^2, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, note that 1/|r_j|^2 = |1/r_j|^2. So, if we can find the roots of the reciprocal polynomial, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, consider that if r is a root of P(x)=0, then 1/\\overline{r} is a root of the reciprocal polynomial.

Let me think.\n\nSuppose ω is a root of ω^{10} = -1, then its conjugate is \\overline{ω} = ω^{-1} because |ω|=1, so \\overline{ω}=1/ω. Since ω^{10} = -1, then (1/ω)^10 = (-1)^{-1} = -1, so \\overline{ω} is also a root. Therefore, the roots come in conjugate pairs ω and \\overline{ω}.\n\nTherefore, for each pair of roots r and \\overline{r}, they correspond to ω and \\overline{ω}.

Therefore, the terms for ω and \\overline{ω} are equal. Therefore, each pair contributes twice the same value. Therefore, the total sum over all 10 roots is 2 times the sum over the five terms (each term being for a unique ω from each conjugate pair). Therefore, the problem's sum is exactly the sum over the five terms, each being |1 -13 ω|^2 for one ω from each conjugate pair, so the total over all roots is twice that.
