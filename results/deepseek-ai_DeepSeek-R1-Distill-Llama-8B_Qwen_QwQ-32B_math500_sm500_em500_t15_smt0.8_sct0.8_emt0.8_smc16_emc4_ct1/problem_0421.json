So, the equation given is:\n\n\\[x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\]\n\nAnd we're told that this equation has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The question is asking for the sum:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3\\overline{r}_3} + \\frac{1}{r_4\\overline{r}_4} + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\]\n\nHmm, okay. So, each term is the reciprocal of the product of a root and its complex conjugate. I remember that for any complex number \\(z\\), the product \\(z\\overline{z}\\) is equal to \\(|z|^2\\), which is a real number and also equal to \\(z \\cdot \\overline{z}\\). So, each term \\(\\frac{1}{r_i\\overline{r}_i}\\) is essentially \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\).\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the magnitudes of each pair of roots. That is:\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\]\n\nNow, I need to figure out how to compute this sum. Since we have a polynomial equation, perhaps we can use Vieta's formulas or properties related to the roots of a polynomial. Let me recall Vieta's formula: for a polynomial \\(P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_0\\), the sum of the roots, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, etc., can be expressed in terms of the coefficients. But here, we are dealing with reciprocals of magnitudes squared, which is a bit different.\n\nWait, but"

I remember that if \\(r\\) is a root of some polynomial, then \\(1/r\\) can be related to the reciprocal polynomial. But here, we have \\(1/|r|^2\\), which is a bit different. Maybe there's a way to express this using the given polynomial equation.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let's think about the initial equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Maybe expanding this equation could give us some useful information. But expanding \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) seems complicated. Wait, but since we're dealing with roots, maybe each root \\(r\\) satisfies \\(r^{10} + (13r - 1)^{10} = 0\\). So, for each root \\(r_i\\), we have:\n\n\\[(13r_i - 1)^{10} = -r_i^{10}\\]\n\nTaking the 10th root on both sides? Hmm, but that might not be straightforward because complex roots can have multiple branches and things get messy. Maybe instead, think about the modulus. Let's take the modulus of both sides. But wait, \\(| (13r_i - 1)^{10} | = | -r_i^{10} | = |r_i|^{10}\\).

Maybe we can work with this.

Similarly, cos(17\u03c0/10)=cos(-3\u03c0/10)=cos(3\u03c0/10). Similarly, cos(13\u03c0/10)=cos(-7\u03c0/10)=cos(7\u03c0/10), and cos(11\u03c0/10)=cos(-9\u03c0/10)=cos(9\u03c0/10).

Wait, but earlier I said 11\u03c0/10 is equal to -9\u03c0/10, which is not correct because 11\u03c0/10 is \u03c0 + \u03c0/10, which is in the third quadrant, so it's -cos(\u03c0/10). Similarly, 13\u03c0/10=\u03c0 + 3\u03c0/10, so cos(13\u03c0/10)= -cos(3\u03c0/10). 15\u03c0/10=3\u03c0/2, which is cos(3\u03c0/2)=0. 17\u03c0/10=\u03c0 + 7\u03c0/10, but wait, 17\u03c0/10=\u03c0 +7\u03c0/10= but wait, 17\u03c0/10 is actually \u03c0 - 3\u03c0/10 because 17\u03c0/10 is 1.7\u03c0, which is \u03c0 +0.7\u03c0, but wait, 17\u03c0/10=1\u03c0 +7\u03c0/10=\u03c0 +0.7\u03c0, so actually, it's \u03c0 +7\u03c0/10, which is in the third quadrant, so cos(17\u03c0/10)= -cos(7\u03c0/10).

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the sum of cosines over all roots of -1 is equal to -1/2. Because, from trigonometric identities, the sum over the real parts of the 10th roots of -1 is equal to -1/2.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall that the sum of all n-th roots of unity is zero. For the 10th roots of -1, which are not all the 20th roots of unity but only the ones that are multiples of 20k +10, but no, actually, 10th roots of -1 are the 20th roots of unity that are not 10th roots of 1.
