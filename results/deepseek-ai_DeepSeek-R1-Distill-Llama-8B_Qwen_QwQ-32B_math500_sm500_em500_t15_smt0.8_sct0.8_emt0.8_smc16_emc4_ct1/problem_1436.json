To do this, I'll start by expressing \\( 2^{24} \\) in its prime factorization form.\n\nSince \\( 2 \\) is a prime number, \\( 2^{24} \\) is already in its prime factorized form. For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent in its prime factorization must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\nIn this case, the exponent is \\( 24 \\).

Wait, actually, let me correct this step.\n\n   - Wait, actually, the divisors \\( k \\) must be such that \\( n = 2^{24/k} \\) is an integer greater than 1. Therefore, \\( 24/k \\) must be an integer, so \\( k \\) must divide 24. The divisors of 24 are indeed \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \\). However, \\( n \\) must be greater than 1, so \\( n = 2^{24/k} > 1 \\). This requires that \\( 24/k \\geq 1 \\), so \\( k \\leq 24 \\). Since \\( k \\) is a divisor of 24, all divisors except \\( k = 24 \\) will give \\( n > 1 \\). Wait, no, actually:\n\n   - Let me clarify. For each divisor \\( k \\) of 24, \\( n = 2^{24/k} \\).
