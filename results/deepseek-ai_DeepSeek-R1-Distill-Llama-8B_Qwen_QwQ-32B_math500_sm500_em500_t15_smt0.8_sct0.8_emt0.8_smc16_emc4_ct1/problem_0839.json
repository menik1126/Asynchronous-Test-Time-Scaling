Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the function looks like. The function is a fraction where the numerator is \\(x - y\\) and the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\). Since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are variables, this function can take on various values depending on their choices. I need to find the maximum value of this function, which means I need to find the point where the function is the largest possible.\n\nMaybe I can start by simplifying or finding some constraints on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Let's see, the denominator is always positive because \\(x^4\\) and \\(y^4\\) are always non-negative, and then we add 6. So the denominator is at least 6, which is a good start because it means the denominator is always positive, and the function is defined for all real numbers.\n\nSince we're dealing with a function of two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I might need to use calculus to find the maximum. That usually involves taking partial derivatives with respect to each variable, setting them equal to zero, and solving the resulting system of equations. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I can see if there's a substitution or some symmetry that can help simplify the problem.\n\nLet me consider substituting variables or expressing \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) or vice versa. The numerator is \\(x - y\\), so maybe I can set \\(t = x - y\\) and express \\(x\\) as \\(y + t\\). That might help reduce the number of variables. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if \\(x = y + t\\), then the numerator becomes \\(t\\). The denominator becomes \\((y + t)^4 + y^4 + 6\\). So the function becomes \\(\\frac{t}{(y + t)^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can analyze it further.\n\nAlternatively, I might consider polar coordinates since the expression involves squares and higher powers, which can sometimes be simplified with"

Let me try that approach anyway.\n\nLet me set \\(x = r \\cos \\theta\\) and \\(y = r \\sin \\theta\\). Then, the numerator becomes \\(r (\\cos \\theta - \\sin \\theta)\\), and the denominator becomes \\(r^4 (\\cos^4 \\theta + \\sin^4 \\theta) + 6\\). So the function is \\(\\frac{r (\\cos \\theta - \\sin \\theta)}{r^4 (\\cos^4 \\theta + \\sin^4 \\theta) + 6}\\). Hmm, maybe this can be maximized by choosing appropriate \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\). But this might not be straightforward. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can fix one variable in terms of the other. Let me suppose that \\(x = y + k\\), so that the numerator is \\(k\\), and then express the denominator in terms of \\(y\\) and \\(k\\). But I'm not sure if that's better.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Since we need to maximize \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\), we can consider the function \\(f(x, y)\\) and set its gradient equal to zero.

Maybe there are other points where the function is larger? Or is this the highest?\n\nI should check the behavior of the function at other points.\n\nLet me consider when \\(y\\) approaches some of the values. For instance, suppose \\(x\\) is very large, positive or negative, how does the function behave?\n\nIf \\(x\\) is very large, say positive, and \\(y\\) is fixed, then numerator grows like \\(x\\), denominator grows like \\(x^4\\), so the whole function behaves like \\(x / x^4 = 1/x^3\\), which approaches zero as \\(x\\) approaches infinity. Similarly, if \\(x\\) is negative and large in magnitude, the function will approach zero from negative side. So, the function tends to zero at infinity.\n\nSimilarly, if \\(y\\) is large, and \\(x\\) is fixed, the denominator will dominate, leading the function to zero.\n\nSo, the maximum is likely attained at one of the critical points we found.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check other critical points or see if the function can be higher somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the critical points are the only candidates for maxima because the function tends to zero at infinity. So the function may have only these two critical points, and among them, (1, -1) gives the highest value of 1/4.\n\nBut to make sure, I should perhaps consider the function along certain lines or use inequalities.\n\nAnother approach: Let me use the substitution \\(y = k x\\), where \\(k\\) is a real constant. Then, express the function in terms of \\(k\\) and \\(x\\).\n\nSo, let \\(y = k x\\). Then, the numerator becomes \\(x - y = x(1 - k)\\).
