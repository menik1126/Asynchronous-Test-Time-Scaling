To confirm, I'll check that neither of these values makes the numerator zero. \n\nFor \\( x = 7 \\), the numerator \\( 2(7) = 14 \\) is not zero. Similarly, for \\( x = -2 \\), the numerator \\( 2(-2) = -4 \\) is also not zero. Therefore, both \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\) are vertical asymptotes, so \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nNext, to find the horizontal asymptote \\( y = c \\), I'll consider the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is of degree 1, and the denominator is of degree 2. When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients. \n\nThe leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\), so \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nFinally, to find the sum \\( a + b + c \\), I'll add the values together: \\( 7 + (-2) + 2 = 7 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\( 7 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the vertical asymptotes and horizontal asymptote of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find Vertical Asymptotes:**\n   - **Set the Denominator Equal to Zero:**\n     \\[\n     x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\n     \\]\n   - **Factor the Quadratic Equation:**\n     \\[\n     (x - 7)(x + 2)"
