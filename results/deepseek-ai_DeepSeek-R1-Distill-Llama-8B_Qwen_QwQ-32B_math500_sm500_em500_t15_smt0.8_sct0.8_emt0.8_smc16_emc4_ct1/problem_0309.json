Hmm, let me try to remember how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So I need to find the roots of the denominator, which is x\u00b2 - 5x -14. To do that, I can try factoring it or use the quadratic formula.\n\nLet me see if it factors. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of 14 are 1 and 14, 2 and 7. Let's try 2 and -7. 2 * (-7) = -14, and 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect! So the denominator factors as (x + 2)(x -7). So the denominator is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x - 7 = 0, which gives x = -2 and x = 7. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So a is -2 and b is 7.\n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. Both are degree 1 here (numerator is 2x, which is degree 1; denominator is x\u00b2 - 5x -14, which is degree 2). Wait, the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator, so the horizontal asymptote is determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nThe leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1 (since x\u00b2 has coefficient 1). So, the horizontal asymptote should be y = 2/1 = 2. Therefore, c is 2.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the factoring. x\u00b2 -5x -14: yes, 2 and -7 work because 2* (-7) = -14 and"

            "output": " 2 + (-7) = -5. So the roots are indeed -2 and 7. So vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x =7. \n\nFor the horizontal asymptote, since the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Wait, hold on! I think I made a mistake here. Let me recall the rules again. \n\nThe horizontal asymptote for a rational function:\n\n- If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0.\n\n- If the degrees are equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\n- If the numerator's degree is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote (though there might be an oblique or curved asymptote).\n\nIn this case, numerator is degree 1, denominator is degree 2. So the degree of numerator is less than denominator, so horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Wait, so I messed that up earlier. So c is actually 0, not 2. That was a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nSo the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Therefore, c = 0. \n\nSo then, a is -2, b is 7, and c is 0. Adding them together: -2 +7 +0 = 5. \n\nWait, but let me confirm again. Let me think through the horizontal asymptote again. The function is (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). As x approaches infinity, the highest degree terms dominate, so the numerator behaves like 2x and the denominator like x\u00b2. So the function behaves like (2x)/(x\u00b2) = 2/x. As x approaches infinity, 2/x approaches 0. So yes, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So c is indeed 0. \n\nTherefore, the sum a + b + c is (-2) +7 +0 =5. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be 5. Let me just check if I got the vertical asymptotes right again. The denominator factors to (x +2)(x -7), so roots at x = -2 and x =7. Correct. The numerator at x = -2 is 2*(-2) = -4, which isn't zero, so vertical asymptotes there. Similarly, at x=7, numerator is 1"
