Next, I'll divide both sides by 8 to isolate \\(3^x\\), resulting in \\(3^x = 9\\). Since 9 is equal to \\(3^2\\), the equation simplifies to \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[ 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\]\n\n**Step 1: Simplify \\(2^3\\)**\n\\[ 2^3 = 8 \\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 8 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Divide both sides by 8**\n\\[ 3^x = \\frac{72}{8} \\]\n\\[ 3^x = 9 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Express 9 as a power of 3**\n\\[ 9 = 3^2 \\]\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[ 3^x = 3^2 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Since the bases are equal, set the exponents equal**\n\\[ x = 2 \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
