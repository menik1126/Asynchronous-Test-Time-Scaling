The distance between C and D is 140 meters. There's a hot-air balloon at point H directly above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. Specifically, rope HC is 150 meters long, and rope HD is 130 meters long. \n\nThe goal is to replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. The idea is to reduce the total length of rope used. I need to figure out the greatest length of rope that can be saved.\n\nOkay, let me break this down. \n\nFirst, I should visualize the setup. Points A, B, C, D, and O form a sort of cross with O in the center. A is north, so above O; B is west, so left of O; C is south, below O; and D is east, right of O. The balloon H is straight above O, so directly above at some height. The ropes HA, HB, HC, and HD are attached to H and anchored at A, B, C, and D respectively.\n\nCurrently, HC is 150 m and HD is 130 m. So, the total length used for these two ropes is 150 + 130 = 280 meters. If I replace these two ropes with a single rope HP, the question is, where should P be on the line CD to minimize the total length used, thereby maximizing the rope saved.\n\nSo, essentially, I need to find the position of point P on segment CD such that the length of HP is less than or equal to the sum of HC and HD, which is 280 m. The maximum savings would be 280 minus the length of HP.\n\nBut wait, no, actually, it's the difference between 280 and the new rope length. So, the longer HP is, the less rope is saved. So, to maximize the saved length, I need to minimize the length of HP. Therefore, the minimal length of HP would result in the maximum savings.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the greatest length of rope that can be saved.\" So, savings would be"

So yes, we need to minimize HP.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the point P along CD such that the distance from H to P is as short as possible. Since P is constrained to lie on CD. So, the minimal HP is the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD. Because the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. \n\nTherefore, if I can compute the coordinates of everything, I can compute the perpendicular distance from H to CD and then get the minimal HP. Then the savings would be 280 minus that minimal HP. \n\nOkay, so let's formalize this with coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system where O is at (0, 0). Since A is north of O, let's assume that the directions correspond to the standard coordinate axes. Let me set the coordinates as follows:\n\n- Let’s define O as the origin (0, 0).\n- A is directly north of O, so let's say along the positive y-axis. Let’s denote A as (0, a) for some a.\n- B is directly west of O, so along the negative x-axis: (-b, 0) for some b.\n- C is directly south of O, so along the negative y-axis: (0, -c) for some c.\n- D is directly east of O, along the positive x-axis: (d, 0) for some d.\n\nGiven that the distance between C and D is 140 m. The coordinates of C are (0, -c), and D are (d, 0). The distance between C and D is sqrt[(d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2] = sqrt(d² + c²) = 140 m. So, we have d² + c² = 140².\n\nNow, the balloon is at H, directly above O, so its coordinates would be (0, 0, h) if we consider 3D, but since we can work in 2D for the horizontal positions and vertical height, maybe we can represent H as (0,0) vertically above O, but with a height. Since the problem may be treated using coordinates in 2D with height as a third coordinate. \n\nHowever, since all the"

But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps model it in 2D with O at (0,0), A at (0, a), B at (-b, 0), C at (0, -c), D at (d, 0), and H at (0, k), where k is the height above O.\n\nBut then, the distance from H to CD needs to be computed.\n\nWait, yes, because in 2D, CD is the line segment from C(0, -c) to D(d, 0). So, the line CD can be represented by the equation.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to compute the distance from point H(0, k) to the line CD.\n\nWait, but actually, HP is a straight rope from H to P, where P is on CD. So, the minimal HP is the minimal distance from H to CD, which is the perpendicular distance.\n\nThus, mathematically, if I can find the equation of line CD and then compute the distance from H(0, k) to CD, that would give the minimal HP.\n\nSo, let me compute the equation of line CD. Points C(0, -c) and D(d, 0). So, the slope of CD is (0 - (-c))/(d - 0) = c/d.\n\nSo, the equation of line CD is y = (c/d)x + (-c). Wait, because when x=0, y = -c, which is point C.\n\nSo, equation: y = (c/d)x - c.\n\nAlternatively, in standard form: (c/d)x - y - c = 0.\n\nThe distance from a point (x0, y0) to this line is |(c/d)x0 - y0 - c| / sqrt((c/d)^2 +"

It doesn't mention the lengths of HA and HB, so perhaps they are not needed for the problem.\n\nBut the main point is that we need to replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is on CD.\n\nSo, in 3D, point P lies on the line segment CD, which is from C(0, -c, 0) to D(d, 0, 0). So, parametric equations for CD:\n\nx = 0 + t*d, for t from 0 to 1\n\ny = -c + t*c (since from -c to 0)\n\nz = 0\n\nSo, point P(t) = (dt, (-c + tc), 0) = (dt, c(t - 1), 0)\n\nWait, let me verify that. When t=0, we are at C(0, -c, 0). When t=1, we are at D(d, 0, 0). So, yes, x(t) = d*t, y(t) = -c + t*(c) = -c + c*t = c*(t - 1), z(t)=0.\n\nWait, is that correct? When t=1, y=0, which is correct. So, the coordinates of P are (d*t, c*(t - 1), 0).\n\nThus, the rope HP connects H(0,0,h) to P(dt, c(t - 1), 0). The length of HP is the distance between these two points.\n\nSo, length of HP squared is:\n\n(dx)^2 + (dy)^2 + (dz)^2 ="

Wait, what?\n\nWait, earlier, I thought c² -d²=600, but in reality, c² -d²=5600.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem.\n\nIf c² + d²=19600,\n\nc² -d²=5600,\n\nThen adding:\n\n2c²=25600,\n\nSo c²=12800,\n\nThen d²=19600 -12800=6800.\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I got c²=10050 and d²=9500. That was wrong.\n\nWait, let me correct this.\n\nWait, from equations:\n\nEquation1: d² +c²=19600,\n\nEquation2: c² + h²=22500,\n\nEquation3: d² + h²=16900.\n\nSubtract equation3 from equation2:\n\n(c² +h²) - (d² +h²)=22500 -16900,\n\nc² -d²=5600. So, c² -d²=5600.\n\nThus, equations:\n\n1) d² + c²=19600,\n\n2) c² -d²=5600.\n\nAdding 1 and 2:\n\n2c²=25600,\n\nThus, c²=12800,\n\nThen, from 1), d²=19600 -12800=6800.\n\nTherefore, c= sqrt(12800)= 113.137 m,\n\nd= sqrt(6800)=82.462 m.\n\nTherefore, c≈113.137 m,\n\nd≈82.462 m,\n\nThen, using equation2: c² +h²=22500,\n\nHence, h²=22500 -12800=9700,\n\nSo, h= sqrt(9700)=98.485 m.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous mistake where I got c²=10050, d²=9500, which was wrong.\n\nThus, correction: c²=12800, d²=6800, h²=9700.\n\nSo, the minimal HP is the perpendicular distance from H to CD.\n\nGiven point H(0,0,h), and line CD from C(0, -c,0) to D(d,0,0).\n\nWe can compute the distance.\n\nVector HC=(0, -c, -h),\n\nVector HD=(d,0, -h),\n\nVector CD=("
