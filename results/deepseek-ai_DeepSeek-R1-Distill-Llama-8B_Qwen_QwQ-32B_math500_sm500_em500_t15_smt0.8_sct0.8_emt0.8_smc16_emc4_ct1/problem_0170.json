            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me write that down to make sure I understand it correctly. It's the cube root of (x² - 4x + 4) = 16. I remember that cube roots can be tricky, but maybe I can get rid of the cube root first. \n\nSo, if I have a cube root of something equals 16, I can probably get rid of the cube root by cubing both sides. That makes sense because the cube of the cube root should just be the original thing inside. Let me try that. \n\nSo, if I cube both sides, the left side becomes (cube root of (x² - 4x + 4))³, which should just be x² - 4x + 4. And the right side is 16³. I need to calculate 16³. Let me see, 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16... Hmm, that's 4096. So, the equation simplifies to x² - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me rewrite that: x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. To solve for x, I should get all the terms on one side so that the equation equals zero. So, I'll subtract 4096 from both sides. That gives me x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. \n\nLet's compute 4 - 4096. That would be -4092. So the equation is now x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in standard form, which is ax² + bx + c = 0. So here, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092.\n\nI can try to solve this using the quadratic formula, which is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of (b squared minus 4ac) all over 2a. Plugging in the values, that's x = [4 ± sqrt( (-4)² - 4*1*(-4092) )]/(2*1). Let me compute the discriminant first, which is under the square root.\n\nSo"

            "output": ", the discriminant is (-4) squared, which is 16, minus 4 times a times c, which is 4*1*(-4092). That would be 16 - (4*1*(-4092)). Wait, hold on, 4 times a times c is 4*1*(-4092), which is -16368. So the discriminant becomes 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding the positive, so 16 + 16368. \n\nLet me add those together. 16 + 16368 is 16384. So the square root of 16384 is... Hmm, I think 128 squared is 16384 because 128 times 128, let me check. 100 squared is 10000, 120 squared is 14400, then 128 squared is 16384. Yep, that's right. So sqrt(16384) is 128.\n\nSo now, plugging back into the quadratic formula, x equals [4 ± 128]/2. That gives me two solutions. Let me compute both.\n\nFirst solution: 4 + 128 = 132. So x = 132 / 2 = 66.\n\nSecond solution: 4 - 128 = -124. So x = -124 / 2 = -62.\n\nWait, so I have two solutions: x = 66 and x = -62. But the question asks for the positive value of x. So, even though both are solutions, the positive one is 66.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the original equation, sqrt[3](x² - 4x + 4) = 16. Let's plug in x = 66 into the left side.\n\nCompute x² - 4x + 4 when x=66: 66 squared is 4356, minus 4*66 is 264, so 4356 - 264 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096. So sqrt[3](4096). Wait, what's 16 cubed? 16*16=256, 256*16=4096. So yes, sqrt[3](4096)=16. That checks out.\n\nNow, let's try x = -62. Compute (-62)^2 - 4*(-62) + 4. That's 3844"
