            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write that down to make sure I have it right.\n\nSo, it's \u221a\u00b3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16. Alright, cube roots can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this. Let me recall how to solve equations with cube roots. I remember that if there's a radical in the equation, like a cube root or a square root, one common method is to eliminate that radical by raising both sides of the equation to the power that will get rid of it.\n\nIn this case, it's a cube root, so if I cube both sides, that should eliminate it. That makes sense. So, I'll start by cubing both sides to get rid of the cube root. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, the original equation is \u221a\u00b3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16. If I cube both sides, it becomes:\n\n(\u221a\u00b3(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4))\u00b3 = 16\u00b3.\n\nOn the left side, the cube and the cube root should cancel each other out, leaving just (x\u00b2 - 4x + 4). On the right side, 16 cubed is 16 multiplied by itself three times. Let me compute that.\n\n16 * 16 is 256, and 256 * 16... Hmm, 256 * 10 is 2560, 256 * 6 is 1536, so adding those together is 2560 + 1536. Let me add that up: 2560 + 1536. 2560 + 1500 is 4060, and then +36 is 4096. So, 16 cubed is 4096.\n\nSo now, my equation is simplified to:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nAlright, that looks more manageable. So, I have a quadratic equation now. I should bring all terms to one side to set it equal to zero, so I can then solve for x using the quadratic formula or factoring, if possible.\n\nLet me subtract 4096 from both sides to get everything on the left:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0.\n\nSimplify"

            "output": " that:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me see if it can be factored. The quadratic is x\u00b2 -4x -4092 =0. To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -4092 and add up to -4. Hmm, that might be a bit challenging. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the quadratic formula would be better here. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092.\n\nLet me plug those into the formula. So:\n\nx = [-(-4) \u00b1 \u221a((-4)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-4092))]/(2*1)\n\nSimplify step by step. First, the numerator:\n\n-(-4) is 4. Then, inside the square root:\n\n(-4)^2 is 16. Then, -4*1*(-4092) is +16368. So, the discriminant (the part under the square root) is 16 + 16368. Let me add those together.\n\n16 + 16368: 16 + 16000 is 16016, then +368 is 16384. Wait, 16368 +16? Let me check again. 16 + 16368. 16368 + 10 is 16378, plus 6 is 16384. Yes, that's right. So the discriminant is 16384.\n\nHmm, okay. So the square root of 16384. Let me see if that's a perfect square. Let me think. 128 squared is 16384 because 100 squared is 10,000, 120 squared is 14,400, 128 squared is (130 - 2)^2 = 130\u00b2 - 4*130 +4 = 16900"

            "output": " - 520 +4= 16384. Yes, that's correct. So \u221a16384 is 128.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 128]/2.\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\nx = (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66,\n\nand\n\nx = (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62.\n\nSo, the solutions are x=66 and x=-62.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the positive value of x. So, x=66 is the positive solution. Hmm, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from \u221a\u00b3(x\u00b2 -4x +4)=16, I cubed both sides to get x\u00b2 -4x +4=4096. Subtracted 4096 to get x\u00b2 -4x -4092=0. Applied quadratic formula, found the discriminant as 16384, which is 128 squared, so sqrt(16384)=128. Then, x=(4 \u00b1128)/2, giving 66 and -62. So yes, 66 is the positive solution.\n\nWait, maybe I should plug x=66 back into the original equation to make sure it works, just to be thorough.\n\nLet's compute the original expression: cube root of (66\u00b2 -4*66 +4).\n\nCompute 66 squared: 66*66 is 4356. Then, 4*66 is 264. So, 4356 -264 is 4092. Then, 4092 +4 is 4096. So, cube root of 4096 is indeed 16, because 16*16=256, 256*16=4096.\n\nSo, that checks out. Similarly, plugging x=-62 in, let me see: (-62)^2 is 3844, minus 4*(-62) is +248, so 3844 +248 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096. So, same result, cube root is 16. So both solutions are valid.\n\nBut the problem asks specifically for the positive value. So, 66 is the answer they're looking for.\n\nI think that's solid then. So, the positive value of x that satisfies the equation is 66.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 -"
