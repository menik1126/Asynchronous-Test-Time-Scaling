To do this, I should express \\( 2^{24} \\) in its prime factorization form, which in this case is already given as \\( 2^{24} \\).\n\nNext, for \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent in the prime factorization must be divisible by \\( n \\). Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of \\( 24 \\).\n\nThen, I will list all the positive divisors of \\( 24 \\). These divisors are \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, \\) and \\( 24 \\). However, since the problem specifies \\( n > 1 \\), I will exclude \\( 1 \\) from the list.\n\nFinally, the valid values of \\( n \\) are \\( 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, \\) and \\( 24 \\). Counting these, there are \\( 7 \\) positive integers greater than \\( 1 \\) that satisfy the condition.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - A number is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if it can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n   - Given \\( 2^{24} \\), we need to find all \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n\n2. **Express \\( 2^{24} \\) in Prime Factorization:**\n   \\[\n   2^{24} = (2)^{24}\n   \\]\n   Here, the prime factorization is already in its simplest form with the exponent \\( 24 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Exponents \\( n \\) for Which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a Perfect Power:"
