This implies that \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\nNext, I consider the divisors of 24. These divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since the problem specifies \\( n > 1 \\), I exclude 1 from the possible values.\n\nFinally, I count the valid divisors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. There are 7 such values.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) it holds that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n   - This means \\( 2^{24} \\) must be a perfect power of \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Express \\( 2^{24} \\) as a Perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) Power:**\n   - Let \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\).\n   - Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\log(k^n) = \\log(2^{24}) \\implies n \\cdot \\log(k) = 24 \\cdot \\log(2)\n     \\]\n   - However, instead of solving this directly, we can analyze the exponent in \\( 2^{24} \\).\n\n3. **Analyze the Exponent 24:**\n   - For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\("
