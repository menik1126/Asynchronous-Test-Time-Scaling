This means that 54 divided by the number of players \\( x \\) must result in an integer.\n\nNext, I'll express this mathematically by setting up the equation \\( 54 \\div x = y \\), where \\( y \\) is an integer. This implies that \\( x \\) must be a divisor of 54.\n\nTo find all possible values of \\( x \\), I'll list all the positive divisors of 54. Starting with 1, I'll test each number to see if it divides 54 without leaving a remainder.\n\nAfter listing all the divisors, I'll identify which of them meet the given conditions: \\( x \\) must be at least 2 and \\( y \\) must be at least 5. This means I'll exclude 1 from the list of possible \\( x \\) values.\n\nFinally, I'll count the remaining divisors to determine the number of valid possible values for \\( x \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( y \\geq 5 \\) when dealing 54 cards among \\( x \\) players (each receiving \\( y \\) cards), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Divisibility Requirement:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{54}{x} = y \\quad \\text{where} \\quad y \\geq 5\n   \\]\n   This means that \\( x \\) must be a divisor of 54, and \\( y \\) must be an integer.\n\n2. **List All Divisors of 54:**\n   - Start by finding all positive integers \\( x \\) that divide 54 without leaving a remainder.\n   \\[\n   54 \\, \\div\\, x = \\text{integer} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x \\, \\text{ is a divisor of 54}\n   \\]\n   - The divisors of 54 are:\n     \\[\n     1, \\, 2, \\, 3, \\, 6, \\, 9, \\, 18, \\, 27, \\, 54\n     \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Given Conditions:**\n   - \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n   - \\( y \\"
