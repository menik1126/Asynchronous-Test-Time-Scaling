            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a y-intercept is. From what I remember, a y-intercept is a point where the graph crosses the y-axis. At any point on the y-axis, the value of x is zero because the y-axis is where x=0. So, to find the y-intercepts, I should set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nAlright, let's do that. Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation, we have:\n\n\\( 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\)\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). Quadratic equations are of the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), and I can solve them using the quadratic formula: \\( y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\). In this case, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nLet me plug these values into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} \\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 4}}{2} \\)\n\nWait, because \\( -4ac \\) becomes \\( -4*1*(-1) = +4 \\), so inside the square root, we have \\( 16 + 4 = 20 \\). So,\n\n\\( y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} \\)\n\nHmm, \\( \\sqrt{20} \\) can be simplified. Since \\( 20 = 4*5 \\), \\( \\sqrt{20} = \\sqrt{4*5} = 2\\sqrt{5} \\).\n\nSubstituting back in:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\)\n\nI can factor out a 2 in the numerator:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{2(2 \\pm \\sqrt{5})}{2"

So,\n\nFor \\( y = 2 + \\sqrt{5} \\), that's approximately \\( 2 + 2.236 = 4.236 \\).\n\nFor \\( y = 2 - \\sqrt{5} \\), that's approximately \\( 2 - 2.236 = -0.236 \\).\n\nSo, the two y-intercepts are at \\( (0, 2 + \\sqrt{5}) \\) and \\( (0, 2 - \\sqrt{5}) \\).\n\nWait a second, does this equation represent a parabola? Because in the standard form of a parabola, we have either \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) or \\( x = ay^2 + by + c \\). The given equation is \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), which is indeed a horizontal parabola. That means it opens either to the right or to the left. Since the coefficient of \\( y^2 \\) is positive (1), it should open to the right.\n\nBut how does that affect the number of y-intercepts? Well, a horizontal parabola can cross the y-axis at two points, one point, or none, depending on its shape. In our case, we found two solutions, so it's crossing the y-axis at two points. That makes sense because the parabola is opening horizontally, so it's symmetric about the axis \\( y = 2 \\), which is the vertex's y-coordinate.\n\nLet me confirm the vertex to make sure. The vertex form of a horizontal parabola is \\( x = a(y - k)^2 + h \\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the vertex. Starting from our equation \\( x = y^2 -4y -1 \\), let me complete the square.\n\nFirst, take the y terms: \\( y^2 -4y \\). To complete the square, take half of -4, which is -2, square it to get "

Therefore, the vertex is at \\( (-5, 2) \\). So, the vertex is 5 units to the left of the y-axis. Since the parabola opens to the right, it will cross the y-axis in two points.\n\nTo double-check, let me consider the graph. Since the vertex is at (-5, 2), which is left of the y-axis, and it's opening right, it has to cross the y-axis somewhere. Since it's symmetric around the line \\( y = 2 \\), it makes sense that it has two intersection points on the y-axis, one above and one below the vertex.\n\nWait, but the y-axis is the line \\( x=0 \\). The vertex is at (-5, 2), so it's 5 units away from the y-axis. The parabola opening to the right will indeed intersect the y-axis at two points, as the distance from the vertex to the y-axis is 5, which is more than zero, so definitely crossing the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, the number of y-intercepts is two. \n\nJust to recap, I set x=0 because the y-intercepts lie on the y-axis, solved the resulting quadratic equation in y, found two real solutions, and confirmed that the parabola's shape and position support those two points. So, the graph has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of y-intercepts of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), we set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n1.
