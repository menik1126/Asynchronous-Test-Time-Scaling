Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length by 6.\n\nSo, 16 cm × 6 = 96 cm.\n\nNext, I will set this perimeter equal to the perimeter of the regular octagon.\n\nLet’s denote each side of the octagon as 'x' cm.\n\nA regular octagon has 8 sides, so its perimeter is 8 times the side length.\n\nSetting up the equation: 8x = 96 cm.\n\nTo find the value of 'x', I will divide both sides of the equation by 8.\n\nSo, x = 96 cm ÷ 8 = 12 cm.\n\nTherefore, each side of the regular octagon is 12 cm long.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   - **Number of sides on the hexagon:** 6\n   - **Length of each side of the hexagon:** 16 cm\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Perimeters Equal:**\n   \n   The perimeter of the octagon is equal to the perimeter of the hexagon.\n   \n   - **Number of sides on the octagon:** 8\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 8 \\times \\text{side length of octagon}\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the perimeters are equal:\n   \n   \\[\n   8 \\times \\text{side length of octagon} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the Side Length of the Octagon:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{side length of octagon} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
