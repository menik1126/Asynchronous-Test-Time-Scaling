            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, there are 6 sides. So, the perimeter is 6 multiplied by 16, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon. To find the length of each side of the octagon, I divide the total perimeter by the number of sides, which is 8. \n\nFinally, dividing 96 cm by 8 gives me the length of each side of the octagon, which is 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- A regular hexagon has a side length of 16 cm.\n- The perimeter of the regular octagon is equal to the perimeter of the hexagon.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the hexagon.**\n- A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.\n- Perimeter of the hexagon \\( P_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times \\text{side length} \\)\n- \\( P_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16 \\, \\text{cm} = 96 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the side length of the octagon.**\n- A regular octagon has 8 equal sides.\n- Let \\( s \\) be the side length of the octagon.\n- Perimeter of the octagon \\( P_{\\text{octagon}} = 8 \\times s \\)\n- Since the perimeters are equal:\n  \\( 8 \\times s = 96 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n- Solving for \\( s \\):\n  \\( s = \\frac{96 \\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12 \\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
