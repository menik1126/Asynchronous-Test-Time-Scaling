A terminating decimal is a decimal that ends after a finite number of digits, unlike a repeating decimal which goes on indefinitely.\n\nNext, I need to convert the fraction 57/160 into a decimal. To do this, I'll divide 57 by 160.\n\nAfter performing the division, I'll have a decimal result. However, since 160 has factors other than 2 and 5, the decimal will not terminate. To make it terminate, I'll convert the fraction to its decimal form by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 5 to get rid of any non-5 factors in the denominator.\n\nThen, I'll simplify the fraction and perform the division again to ensure that the denominator only has factors of 2 and 5. Finally, I'll write down the resulting decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Terminating Decimals\nA terminating decimal is a decimal that ends after a finite number of digits. For a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) to convert to a terminating decimal, the denominator \\(b\\) (after simplifying the fraction) must be of the form \\(2^n \\times 5^m\\), where \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are non-negative integers.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Fraction\nCheck if \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) can be simplified:\n- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 57 and 160 is 1.\n- Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n### Step 3: Convert to Decimal\nSince the denominator is 160, which factors into \\(16 \\times 10 = 2^4 \\times 5^1\\), the decimal will terminate.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57}{2^4 \\times 5^1}\n\\]\n\nConvert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 57 by 160:\n\n\\[\n57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
