Breaking it down, 160 can be factored into 2 raised to the power of 5, since 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 equals 32, and 32 × 5 equals 160. This means that 160 is a product of only the prime factors 2 and 5, which are the same prime factors as 10. Therefore, 160 can be expressed as 10 raised to the power of 5.\n\nNext, I'll convert 57/160 into a decimal by dividing 57 by 160. To do this, I'll set up the division: 57 ÷ 160. Since 57 is less than 160, the result will be less than 1. To make the division easier, I'll consider 57 as 57.000000 and bring down the decimal places as needed.\n\nAfter setting up the division, I'll perform the polynomial long division. I'll start by determining how many times 160 fits into 57. Since it doesn't fit, I'll add a decimal point and bring down a zero, making it 570. I'll continue this process, bringing down zeros as necessary, and record the quotient digit by digit. Each step will give me a decimal digit of the result until I've performed enough divisions to reach the required precision.\n\nOnce I have the decimal representation, I'll have the terminating decimal equivalent of 57/160. Finally, I'll round the result to the appropriate number of decimal places if needed, but since 57/160 is already in its simplest form with a denominator that factors into only 2s and 5s, the decimal representation will be a terminating decimal without any repeating patterns.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) is already in its simplest form since 57 and 160 share no common factors other than 1.\n\n2. **Express the Denominator as Powers of 10:**\n   - Factorize the denominator: \\(160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\\).\n   - Since the denominator only contains the prime factors 2 and 5, the"
