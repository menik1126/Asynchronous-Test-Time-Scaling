Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula \\( \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\). Yeah, that's the formula for the area when two sides and the included angle are known. So, in this case, the area is given by \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). Let me write that down:\n\nArea \\( = a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\).\n\nAnd also, from the usual formula:\n\nArea \\( = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\).\n\nSo, if I set these equal to each other, I can get an equation involving \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( \\sin A \\). That is:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me compute \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\) first. Maybe that can be simplified. So, expanding \\( (b - c)^2 \\), that's \\( b^2 - 2bc + c^2 \\). So,\n\n\\( a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \\).\n\nWait, but that seems like \\( a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc \\). Hmm, I recall from the Law of Cosines that \\( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\). Let me plug that in here.\n\nSo, substituting \\( a^2 \\) with \\( b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\), we get:\n\n\\( (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc \\).\n\nLet's simplify that term by term:\n\n- \\( b^2 \\) cancels with \\( -b^2 \\).\n- \\( c^2 \\) cancels with \\( -c^2 \\).\n- So we have \\( -2bc \\cos A"

So, setting them equal:\n\n\\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\).\n\nHmm, let's see. Both sides have \\( bc \\), so I can divide both sides by \\( bc \\) assuming \\( bc \\neq 0 \\) (which they can't be in a triangle). So:\n\n\\( 2(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin A \\).\n\nLet me rewrite that:\n\n\\( 2 - 2\\cos A = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin A \\).\n\nHmm, to make it easier, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\( 4 - 4\\cos A = \\sin A \\).\n\nNow, I have an equation involving \\( \\sin A \\) and \\( \\cos A \\). I need to find \\( \\tan A \\), which is \\( \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} \\). So maybe I can express this equation in terms of \\( \\tan A \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( x = \\tan A \\). Then, \\( \\sin A = x \\cos A \\). Also, since \\( \\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1 \\), \\( (x \\cos A)^2 + \\cos^2 A = 1 \\Rightarrow x^2 \\cos^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1 \\Rightarrow \\cos^2 A (x^2 + 1) = 1 \\Rightarrow \\cos A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \\).\n\nBut maybe it's better to substitute \\( \\sin A \\) in terms of \\( \\cos A \\) in the equation.\n\nSo, from \\( 4 - 4\\cos A = \\sin A \\), and \\( \\sin A = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 A} \\), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, let me express \\( \\sin A = 4(1 - \\cos A"

So, we must have cos A = 15/17.\n\nTherefore, cos A = 15/17.\n\nNow, since we need tan A, which is sin A / cos A.\n\nWe know that sin A = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 A) = sqrt(1 - ("

Let me double-check.\n\nFrom the quadratic, we got cos A = 15/17, so sin A is 8/17, so tan A is indeed 8/15.\n\nHmm, so how did I get from 4 - 4 cos A = sin A to substituting and getting cos A? Let me recap that step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWe had 4 - 4 cos A = sin A.\n\nThen, squared both sides:\n\n(4 - 4 cos A)^2 = sin\u00b2 A.\n\nWhich is 16 - 32 cos A + 16 cos\u00b2 A = 1 - cos\u00b2 A.\n\nThen, moving everything to left side:\n\n16 -32 cos A +16 cos\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A -1 =0,\n\nWhich is 15 -32 cos A +17 cos\u00b2 A=0.\n\nYes, that looks correct.\n\nSo, quadratic equation: 17y\u00b2 -32 y +15=0.\n\nSolutions y=1 and y=15/17.\n\nBut cos A cannot be 1, so cos A=15/17.\n\nThus, sin A=8/17, tan A=8/15.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in the steps. Let me just check that substituting back into the area works.\n\nCompute area as a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2.\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines,\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 - (b -c)^2 = (b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -2bc*(15/17)) - (b\u00b2 -2bc +c\u00b2).\n\n= b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (30/17 bc) - b\u00b2 +2bc -c\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe b\u00b2 and c\u00b2 cancel out.\n\nSo,\n\n- (30/17 bc) + 2 bc.\n\n= 2 bc - (30/17 bc).\n\nFactor bc:\n\n= bc (2 - 30/17).\n\n= bc (34/17 -30/17)\n\n= bc (4/17).\n\nSo, the area is (4/17) bc.\n\n"
