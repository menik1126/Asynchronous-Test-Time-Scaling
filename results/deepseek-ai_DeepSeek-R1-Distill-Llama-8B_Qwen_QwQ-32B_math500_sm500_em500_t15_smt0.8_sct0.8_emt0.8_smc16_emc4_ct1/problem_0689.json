            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a triangle ABC where the area is given by a² - (b - c)². I need to compute tan A, where A is one of the angles of the triangle, probably the angle opposite side a, which is standard. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using various formulas. One common formula is Heron's formula, but that involves the semi-perimeter and all sides, which seems complicated here. Another formula is (1/2)*base*height, but I don't have the height. Wait, another one: maybe (1/2)*b*c*sin A? That could be useful because it directly involves sides b and c and the sine of angle A, which might relate to tan A.\n\nGiven that area = a² - (b - c)², I can write that down:\n\nArea = a² - (b - c)².\n\nBut also, Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So I can set these equal:\n\na² - (b - c)² = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nHmm, let me expand the left side. (b - c)² is b² - 2bc + c², so a² - (b² - 2bc + c²) simplifies to a² - b² + 2bc - c². So:\n\na² - b² + 2bc - c² = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me rearrange this:\n\na² - b² - c² + 2bc = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nWait, maybe I can express a² in terms of the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that a² = b² + c² - 2bc*cos A. Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\n(b² + c² - 2bc*cos A) - b² - c² + 2bc = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nb² + c² - 2bc*cos A - b² - c² + 2bc = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo b² and -b² cancel out, c² and -c² cancel out, leaving:\n\n-2bc*cos A +"

I need to solve for tan A. Let me write tan A as sin A / cos A. Maybe I can express sin A in terms of cos A.\n\nLet me denote cos A = x for simplicity. Then sin A = sqrt(1 - x²), but wait, that introduces a square root. Alternatively, maybe I can express 4 - 4x = sqrt(1 - x²), then square both sides.\n\nWait, 4 - 4cos A = sin A.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(4 - 4cos A)² = sin² A.\n\nLeft side: 16 - 32cos A + 16cos² A.\n\nRight side: 1 - cos² A (since sin² A = 1 - cos² A).\n\nSo:\n\n16 - 32cos A + 16cos² A = 1 - cos² A.\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\n16 - 32cos A + 16cos² A - 1 + cos² A = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n15 - 32cos A + 17cos² A = 0.\n\nSo, it's a quadratic in cos A: 17cos² A -32cos A +15 = 0.\n\nLet me denote x = cos A. Then:\n\n17x² -32x +15 = 0.\n\nSolving quadratic equation:\n\nx = [32 ± sqrt(32² -4*17*15)] / (2*17).\n\nCompute discriminant: 1024 - 1020 = 4.\n\nSo sqrt(4) = 2.\n\nThus, x = [32 ± 2]/34.\n\nSo two solutions:\n\nx = (32 + 2)/34 = 34/"

So we discard x=1, so cos A = 15/17.\n\nTherefore, cos A = 15/17.\n\nNow, to find sin A, since sin² A + cos² A =1,\n\nsin A = sqrt(1 - (225/289)) = sqrt(64/289) = 8/17.\n\nSo sin A = 8/17.\n\nThus, tan A = sin A / cos A = (8/17)/(15/17) = 8/15.\n\nLet me check my steps because sometimes when I square both sides, I might introduce extraneous solutions, but in this case, since we have a triangle, angles are between 0 and 180 degrees, so cos A can be positive or negative, but since cos A =15/17 is positive, angle A is acute, which is fine.\n\nSo, I think tan A is 8/15.\n</think>\n\nTo find $\\tan A$ in triangle $ABC$ where the area is given by $a^2 - (b - c)^2$, we start by equating the given area formula to the standard area formula involving sides $b$, $c$, and angle $A$. \n\n1. **Setting up the equation:**\n   \\[\n   a^2 - (b - c)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A\n   \\]\n   Expanding and simplifying both sides:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Using the Law of Cosines:**\n   Replace $a^2$ with $b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A$:\n   \\[\n   (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   -2bc \\cos A + 2bc = \\frac{1}{2}"
