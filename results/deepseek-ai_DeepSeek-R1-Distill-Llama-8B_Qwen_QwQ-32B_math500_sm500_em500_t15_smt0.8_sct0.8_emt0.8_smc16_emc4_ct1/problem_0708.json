            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola given by the equation x = y² - 4y - 1 has. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the y-intercepts of a graph are the points where the graph crosses the y-axis. On the y-axis, the value of x is always 0. So, to find the y-intercepts, I should set x to 0 and solve for y. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let me write down the equation again: x = y² - 4y - 1. If I set x = 0, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = y² - 4y - 1.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for y. Quadratic equations can have 0, 1, or 2 real solutions, right? Depending on the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac. If the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions; if it's zero, there's exactly one real solution; and if it's negative, there are no real solutions, just complex ones.\n\nIn my equation, a is 1 (the coefficient of y²), b is -4, and c is -1 (because the equation is y² - 4y - 1). Let me calculate the discriminant:\n\nDiscriminant = b² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4*(1)*(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20.\n\nHmm, the discriminant is 20, which is a positive number. That means there are two distinct real solutions. So, the quadratic equation will have two real y-values where the graph crosses the y-axis.\n\nLet me write down the quadratic formula to find the roots. The quadratic formula is:\n\ny = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ny = [-(-4) ± √(20)] / (2*1) = [4 ± √20] / 2.\n\nSimplify √20. Since √20 is √(4*5) = 2√5. So, the equation becomes:\n\ny = [4 ± 2√5] / 2.\n\nI can factor out a 2 in the numerator:\n\ny = 2*(2 ±"

            "output": " √5) / 2.\n\nThe 2's cancel out:\n\ny = 2 ± √5.\n\nSo, the two y-intercepts are at y = 2 + √5 and y = 2 - √5.\n\nLet me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Starting from the beginning: set x=0, substituted into the equation correctly, identified a=1, b=-4, c=-1. Calculated discriminant as 16 + 4 = 20, which is positive, so two real roots. Then applied quadratic formula correctly, got [4 ± √20]/2, simplified √20 to 2√5, which gives y = 2 ± √5. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the approximate values to see if they make sense. √5 is approximately 2.236. So, y ≈ 2 + 2.236 ≈ 4.236 and y ≈ 2 - 2.236 ≈ -0.236. So, the y-intercepts are at (0, 4.236) and (0, -0.236). That makes sense; the parabola opens to the right because it's a function where x is expressed in terms of y², and since the coefficient of y² is positive, it opens towards the positive x-direction. So, it should intersect the y-axis twice on either side, which matches the two real solutions I found.\n\nTherefore, the graph must have two y-intercepts. I don't think I missed anything here. The steps all check out, and the quadratic equation gave me two real roots, so the answer should be two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nThe graph of the parabola \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) intersects the y-axis at two points. Setting \\( x = 0 \\) and solving for \\( y \\) yields two real solutions, \\( y = 2 + \\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( y = 2 - \\sqrt{5} \\). Therefore, there are two y-intercepts.\n\n\\boxed{2}"
