Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should look at each part of the numerator inside the square root. The numerator is 5 divided by sqrt(80), plus sqrt(845)/9, plus sqrt(45). Maybe I can simplify each of these terms separately.\n\nStarting with 5 divided by sqrt(80). I remember that to simplify square roots, I can factor them into parts that are perfect squares. So, sqrt(80)... 80 is 16 times 5, right? And 16 is a perfect square. So sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5) which is sqrt(16)*sqrt(5) which is 4*sqrt(5). So then 5 divided by sqrt(80) would be 5 divided by (4*sqrt(5)). Maybe I can rationalize the denominator here. Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5): (5*sqrt(5))/(4*(sqrt(5))^2). Since (sqrt(5))^2 is 5, that becomes (5*sqrt(5))/(4*5) which simplifies to sqrt(5)/4.\n\nAlright, so the first term is sqrt(5)/4.\n\nNext term: sqrt(845)/9. Let me see if I can simplify sqrt(845). 845... does that have any square factors? Let me think. 845 divided by 5 is 169. Oh! 169 is 13 squared. So 845 is 5*169, which is 5*13^2. So sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*13^2). That's sqrt(13^2)*sqrt(5) which is 13*sqrt(5). So sqrt(845)/9 is (13*sqrt(5))/9.\n\nSo the second term is (13*sqrt(5))/9.\n\nThird term: sqrt(45). Again, let's factor that. 45 is 9*5, and 9 is a perfect square. So sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo now, the numerator of"

Let me write that down:\n\nsqrt(5)/4 + (13*sqrt(5))/9 + 3*sqrt(5)\n\nHmm, they all have sqrt(5) as a factor, so I can factor that out. Let me rewrite it as sqrt(5) times [1/4 + 13/9 + 3]. That should make it easier to combine the fractions.\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients inside the brackets: 1/4 + 13/9 + 3. Let me find a common denominator for these fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 is 3/1). The least common denominator (LCD) for 4, 9, and 1 is 36, I think.\n\nSo, converting each term:\n\n1/4 is equal to 9/36.\n\n13/9 is equal to 52/36 because 13*4=52 and 9*4=36.\n\n3 is 3/1, which is 108/36 because 3*36=108.\n\nNow add them up: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9+52+108)/36 = 169/36.\n\nWait, 9+52 is 61, plus 108 is 169? Let me check: 9 + 52 is indeed 61, and 61 + 108 is 169. Yep, that's right. So the sum inside the brackets is 169/36.\n\nSo now, the numerator becomes sqrt(5) * (169/36).\n\nSo, putting it back into the expression, we have sqrt(5 * (169/36)) divided by sqrt(5).\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, inside the square root, the numerator is sqrt(5) * 169/36, so the entire expression inside the square root is [sqrt(5) * 169/36]. Then, we're taking the square root of that over sqrt(5).\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.

The numerator inside the square root is that sum, which is sqrt(5)*(169/36), so the expression inside the square root is [sqrt(5) * (169/36)]. So the entire expression is sqrt of [sqrt(5)*(169/36)] divided by sqrt(5).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should represent it correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I misrepresented the expression. Let me write it step by step:\n\nThe original expression is sqrt( [ (5/sqrt(80)) + (sqrt(845)/9) + sqrt(45) ] / sqrt5 )\n\nSo first, simplify the numerator terms as I did before, getting sqrt(5)/4 + (13*sqrt(5))/9 + 3*sqrt(5).\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).

So the fraction inside the square root becomes (169/36). Therefore, the entire expression is sqrt(169/36).\n\nWait, that seems too easy. Let me check again.\n\nLet me go through it again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, numerator terms:\n\n5/sqrt(80) = 5/(4*sqrt(5)) = (5*sqrt(5))/(4*5) = sqrt(5)/4. Correct.\n\nsqrt(845)/9 = sqrt(13²*5)/9 = 13*sqrt(5)/9. Correct.\n\nsqrt(45) = sqrt(9*5) = 3*sqrt(5). Correct.\n\nAdding them together:\n\nsqrt(5)/4 + 13*sqrt(5)/9 + 3*sqrt(5). Let's factor sqrt(5):\n\nsqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Now, compute the coefficients:\n\n1/4 + 13/9 + 3.

So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the numerator (the sum) is sqrt(5)*(169/36).\n\nThen, the entire expression inside the big square root is [sqrt(5)*(169/36)] divided by sqrt(5). So sqrt(5) cancels with the denominator sqrt(5), leaving 169/36. Therefore, the entire expression is sqrt(169/36).\n\nThen sqrt(169/36) is sqrt(169)/sqrt(36) = 13"

So when I compute the numerator A+B+C, that's sqrt(5)*(169/36), as I did. Then, we have [sqrt(5)*(169/36)] divided by sqrt5. So sqrt5 divides sqrt5, leaving 169/36. So sqrt(169/36)=13/6.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nWait, but just to be extra careful, let me compute step by step again.\n\nSo:\n\nA = 5/sqrt(80) = 5/(4*sqrt5) = sqrt5/4.\n\nB = sqrt845 /9 = sqrt(169*5)/9 = 13*sqrt5 /9.\n\nC = sqrt45 = 3*sqrt5.\n\nSo A+B+C = sqrt5/4 + 13*sqrt5/9 + 3*sqrt5.\n\nFactor sqrt5: sqrt5*(1/4 +13/9 +3).\n\nCompute inside the brackets: 1/4 +13/9 +3.\n\nConvert to common denominator 36:\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\n3 = 108/36.\n\nAdd: 9+52=61; 61+108=169.\n\nSo 169/36.\n\nSo A+B+C = sqrt5*(169/36).\n\nNow, the next step is (A+B+C)/sqrt5 = [sqrt5*(169/36)] / sqrt5.\n\nThe sqrt5 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, giving 169/36.\n\nSo now, sqrt(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to 13/6.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I did all steps correctly, perhaps I missed something.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. Let me just verify each calculation to be thorough.\n\nFirst, 5/sqrt(80):\n\nsqrt(80)=sqrt(16*5)=4*sqrt5. So 5/(4*sqrt5). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt5: (5*sqrt5)/(4*5)=sqrt5/4.

Let me compute in fractions:\n\n1/4 is 0.25, 13/9 is approx 1.444..., 3 is 3. So total approx 0.25 +1.444 +3 ≈4.694. 169 divided by 36 is approximately 4.694, so that matches. So that's correct.\n\nThen, when divided by sqrt5, the sqrt5 cancels, so 169/36. Square root of that is 13/6. Since sqrt(169)=13 and sqrt(36)=6.
