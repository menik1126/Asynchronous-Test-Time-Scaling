Let me write it down as it is to make it clearer.\n\nSo, it's sqrt[(5/sqrt(80) + sqrt(845)/9 + sqrt(45)) / sqrt(5)]. I need to simplify this step by step. I guess I should start by simplifying each term inside the numerator and the denominator inside the big square root. Let me take it one term at a time.\n\nFirst, let's look at 5/sqrt(80). I remember that having a square root in the denominator isn't usually how we leave expressions, so maybe I can rationalize that. To do that, I can multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(80). That would give me 5*sqrt(80) over 80. Wait, but 80 can be simplified because 80 is 16 times 5, and sqrt(16) is 4. So sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5) = 4*sqrt(5). So substituting that back, 5*4*sqrt(5) over 80. Let me calculate that: 5*4 is 20, so 20*sqrt(5) over 80, which simplifies to sqrt(5)/4. Okay, so 5/sqrt(80) is equal to sqrt(5)/4.\n\nAlright, moving on to the next term: sqrt(845)/9. Hmm, 845 seems like a big number. Let me see if 845 has any square factors. Well, 845 divided by 5 is 169. Oh, wait, 169 is 13 squared. So sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*13^2). Since sqrt(13^2) is 13, that becomes 13*sqrt(5). So sqrt(845) is 13*sqrt(5). Therefore, sqrt(845)/9 is 13*sqrt(5)/9.\n\nNext term is sqrt(45). Let me simplify that. 45 is 9*5, so sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) which is 3*sqrt(5). Got it. So sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5).\n\n"

            "output": "So now, summarizing all the terms in the numerator:\n\n5/sqrt(80) is sqrt(5)/4,\nsqrt(845)/9 is 13*sqrt(5)/9,\nsqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo the numerator becomes sqrt(5)/4 + 13*sqrt(5)/9 + 3*sqrt(5). Okay, so all these terms have sqrt(5) in them, which is good. I can factor that out. So let's factor out sqrt(5):\n\nsqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nNow, I need to compute 1/4 + 13/9 + 3. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 is 3/1). The least common denominator (LCD) of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Let me convert each term:\n\n1/4 is equal to 9/36,\n13/9 is equal to 52/36,\n3 is equal to 108/36.\n\nSo adding them together: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator simplifies to sqrt(5)*(169/36) which is (169*sqrt(5))/36.\n\nSo now, the original expression inside the square root is:\n\n[(169*sqrt(5))/36] divided by sqrt(5).\n\nSo that's [ (169*sqrt(5))/36 ] / sqrt(5). Dividing by sqrt(5) is the same as multiplying by 1/sqrt(5). So:\n\n(169*sqrt(5)/36) * (1/sqrt(5)).\n\nThe sqrt(5) in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out, leaving 169/36.\n\nSo now, the entire expression is sqrt(169/36). Since sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(a)/sqrt(b). sqrt(169) is 13, and sqrt(36) is 6. So sqrt(169/36) is 13/6.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, simplifying each term:\n\n5/sqrt(80): rationalized to sqrt(5)/4. Correct.\n\nsqrt"
