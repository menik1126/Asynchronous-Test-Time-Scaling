To do this, I'll start by finding its prime factorization. \n\nFirst, I notice that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98.\n\nNext, I divide 98 by 2 again to get 49. Now, 49 is a perfect square of 7, so I can express it as 7 squared.\n\nPutting it all together, the prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which involves adding one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying these results, I calculate:\n- For 2: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n- For 7: \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying these together gives \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - 196 is even, so it's divisible by 2.\n   - \\(196 \\div 2 = 98\\)\n   - 98 is also even, so divide by 2 again.\n   - \\(98 \\div 2 = 49\\)\n   - 49 is a perfect square: \\(7^2\\).\n   \n   So, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divisor Formula**:\n   If a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of \\(p^a \\times q^b \\times r^c \\times \\dots\\), the total number of divisors is:\n   \\[\n   (a + 1) \\times (b + 1) \\times (c + 1) \\times \\dots\n   \\]\n   \n   Applying this to 196:\n   - For \\(2^2\\): \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n   - For \\(7^2\\): \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n   \n   Multiply these together:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3 = "
