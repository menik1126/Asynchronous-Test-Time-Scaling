            "output": "First, I will factorize 196 into its prime factors. I know that 14 times 14 equals 196, and since 14 is 2 times 7, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared and 7 squared.\n\nNext, I will use the formula for calculating the number of divisors. If a number is expressed as a product of primes raised to their respective powers, the total number of divisors is the product of each exponent increased by one.\n\nApplying this to 196, which is 2² multiplied by 7², I will add one to each exponent: 2 + 1 equals 3 and 2 + 1 equals 3. Then, multiplying these together, 3 times 3 gives 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**\n   \n   First, we factorize 196 into its prime factors.\n   \n   \\[\n   196 = 14 \\times 14\n   \\]\n   \n   Since \\(14 = 2 \\times 7\\), substituting back:\n   \n   \\[\n   196 = (2 \\times 7) \\times (2 \\times 7) = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculating the Number of Divisors**\n   \n   The formula to find the number of divisors of a number \\(n\\) when expressed in its prime factorization \\(n = p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{c}\\) is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Divisors} = (a + 1)(b + 1)\\ldots(c + 1)\n   \\]\n   \n   Applying this to our prime factors:\n   \n   \\[\n   2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n   \n   The exponents are 2 and 2.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Divisors} = (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Final Answer**\n   \n   Therefore, 196 has \\(\\boxed{9}\\) positive whole-number divisors."
