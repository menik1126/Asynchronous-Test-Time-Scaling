That is, \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\) for some integer \\( k > 1 \\).\n\nTo find the possible values of \\( n \\), I'll consider the prime factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\). Since \\( 2 \\) is the only prime factor, the expression simplifies to \\( k^n = 2^{24} \\).\n\nNext, I'll express \\( k \\) as a power of \\( 2 \\). Let \\( k = 2^m \\), where \\( m \\) is a positive integer.
