Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given complex numbers to make it clear. We have z = 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i, and c = 2 - 3i. So, z and c are both complex numbers, where z is the point being rotated around c.\n\nI remember that rotating a complex number around another can be done by translating the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, performing the rotation, and then translating back. So, the steps should be something like:\n\n1. Subtract the center c from the point z to get the vector from c to z.\n2. Rotate this vector by \u03c0/4 radians.\n3. Add the center c back to the rotated vector to get the new point w.\n\nLet me represent these steps using complex numbers, since complex numbers can be treated like vectors in the plane.\n\nSo, step 1: z - c. Let me compute that.\n\nz is 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i.\n\nc is 2 - 3i.\n\nSo, subtracting c from z:\n\nz - c = [2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i] - [2 - 3i].\n\nLet me distribute the subtraction:\n\n= (2 - 2) + sqrt(2) + (-3 - 3 sqrt(2))i + 3i.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute each part separately.\n\nReal parts: 2 (from z) minus 2 (from c) is 0.\nImaginary parts: (-3 - 3 sqrt(2)) (from z) minus (-3) (from c) is (-3 - 3 sqrt(2)) + 3 = (-3 + 3) - 3 sqrt(2) = 0 - 3 sqrt(2).\n\nSo z - c = sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i.\n\nWait, is that right?

So subtracting the real parts: (2 + sqrt(2)) - 2 = sqrt(2).\n\nThe imaginary part of z is -(3 + 3 sqrt(2)), and the imaginary part of c is -3. Since in complex numbers, the imaginary component is multiplied by i, so the imaginary part of z is - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i, and the imaginary part of c is -3i. Therefore, subtracting the imaginary parts:\n\n[ - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i ] - [ -3i ] = - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i + 3i = [ -3 - 3 sqrt(2) + 3 ]i = (-3 sqrt(2))i.\n\nSo yes, z - c = sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i. That seems correct.\n\nSo the vector from c to z is sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i. Let me denote this as vector v = sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i.\n\nNow, step 2: rotate this vector v by \u03c0/4 radians counter-clockwise. To rotate a complex number by an angle \u03b8, we multiply it by e^{i\u03b8}. Since it's counter-clockwise, the angle is positive. So, the rotation factor is e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nI know that e^{i\u03c0/4} = cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4) = (sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2). So, multiplying the vector v by this complex number will perform the rotation.\n\nLet me compute v * e^{i\u03c0/4}.\n\nFirst, let me write v as sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i. Let me factor out sqrt(2):\n\nv = sqrt(2)*(1 - 3i). That might make the multiplication easier.\n\nSo, v * e^{i\u03c0/4} = sqrt(2)*(1 - 3i) * [ (sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ]\n\nLet me compute this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply sqrt(2) with the terms in"
