            "output": "Alright, so I have this complex number problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let me make sure I understand what's being asked. We have two complex numbers, z and c. The complex number z is given as 2 + sqrt(2) minus (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i. So, in the form a + bi, that would be a = 2 + sqrt(2) and b = -(3 + 3 sqrt(2)). Then, we have c, which is 2 - 3i. \n\nThe problem says that w is the result when z is rotated around c by \u03c0/4 counter-clockwise. Hmm, rotating a complex number around another complex number. I remember that in complex plane terms, rotating a point around another point involves translating the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, then applying the rotation, and then translating back. \n\nSo, to do that, I think the steps are:\n\n1. Translate z so that c becomes the origin. That is, subtract c from z. So, the vector from c to z is z - c.\n2. Rotate this translated point by \u03c0/4 radians counter-clockwise. In complex numbers, rotation by an angle \u03b8 is done by multiplying by e^(i\u03b8), which is cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8.\n3. Translate the rotated point back by adding c to it.\n\nLet me write that down more precisely.\n\nFirst, compute z - c. So, subtracting c from z:\n\nz = 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i\n\nc = 2 - 3i\n\nSo, z - c = [2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i] - [2 - 3i]\n\nLet me compute that term by term.\n\nThe real parts: 2 + sqrt(2) - 2 = sqrt(2)\n\nThe imaginary parts: -(3 + 3 sqrt(2))i + 3i = [ -3 - 3 sqrt(2) + 3 ] i = (-3 sqrt(2))i\n\nSo, z - c = sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i\n\nOkay, that simplifies to sqrt(2) (1 - 3i)\n\nNow, we need to rotate this complex number by \u03c0/4 radians counter-clock"

For \u03b8 = \u03c0/4, e^(i\u03c0/4) is cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4) which is sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, we have to multiply (sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2)i) by (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2)\n\nLet me denote the translated complex number as t = sqrt(2)(1 - 3i)\n\nMultiplying t by e^(i\u03c0/4):\n\nt * e^(i\u03c0/4) = [sqrt(2)(1 - 3i)] * [sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2]\n\nI can factor out sqrt(2)/2 from both terms in e^(i\u03c0/4):\n\nsqrt(2)/2 * (1 + i) for the rotation factor.\n\nSo, t * e^(i\u03c0/4) = [sqrt(2)(1 - 3i)] * [sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i)]\n\nMultiply sqrt(2) with sqrt(2)/2: that's (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 2/2 = 1.\n\nSo, it becomes (1) * (1 - 3i)(1 + i)\n\nNow, compute (1 - 3i)(1 + i). Let me expand that:\n\n1*1 + 1*i - 3i*1 - 3i*i = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2\n\nSince i^2 = -1, this becomes:\n\n1 + i - 3i - (-3) = 1 + (1 - 3)i + 3\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n-3i + i = -2i\n\nSo, 4 - 2i\n\nTherefore, t * e^(i\u03c0/4) = 4 - 2i\n\nNow, we need to translate back by adding c to this result. Remember, we had translated z by subtracting c, so now we add c back.\n\nSo, w = (4 - 2i) + c\n\nBut c is 2 - 3i. So, adding them together:\n\nReal parts: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nImaginary parts"

Let me go back.\n\n(1 - 3i)(1 + i) = 1*1 + 1*i - 3i*1 - 3i*i\n\n= 1 + i - 3i - 3i\u00b2\n\n= 1 - 2i + 3 (since i\u00b2 = -1, so -3*(-1)=3)\n\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4, and the i terms: 1i - 3i = -2i.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 4 - 2i. Then adding back c, which is 2 - 3i. So 4+2 = 6, and -2i -3i =-5i. So, w=6-5i.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the rotation part, because sometimes when dealing with angles, especially, one can get confused with clockwise vs counter-clockwise. \n\nWait, e^(i\u03c0/4) is the rotation factor for counter-clockwise by \u03c0/4, correct. So, multiplying by e^(i\u03c0/4) gives a counter-clockwise rotation. So, in that case, our steps are correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to, I could look at it in vector terms as well. Let me just verify the steps once more.\n\nAnother approach: The formula for rotating a point z around a point c by angle \u03b8 is w = c + (z - c) * e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nz - c = sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i\n\ne^{i\u03c0/4} = (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2)\n\nMultiply them:\n\n(sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2)i) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2)\n\nFactor out sqrt(2)/2:\n\nsqrt(2)/2 * (1 - 3i) * (1 + i)\n\nWhich is sqrt(2)/2 * (1 - 3i)(1 + i). \n\nWe already computed (1 - 3i)(1"

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, in my previous calculation, I thought that sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) is 1, but actually, in the first step, I had t = sqrt(2)(1 - 3i). Then multiplied by e^{i\u03b8} which is sqrt(2)/2*(1 +i). So, the total is sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)*(1 -3i)(1 +i). \n\nWait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 is (2)/2 =1, so that part is okay. But then (1 -3i)(1 +i) is 4 -2i, so the total is 1*(4 -2i) = 4 -2i. So that part is correct. \n\nWait, but in my second approach here, I thought of factoring sqrt(2)/2, but actually, the sqrt(2) from t and the sqrt(2)/2 from e^{i\u03b8} multiply to 1. So, the rest is (1 -3i)(1 +i). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the result of the rotation is 4 -2i, then adding back c ("

So, w =6 -5i.\n\nBut let me think again: Another way to compute the rotation is to use the formula: when you rotate a complex number z around c by angle \u03b8, the new point w is given by:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^{i\u03b8}\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.

The Asymptote code is given, so maybe I can check coordinates.\n\nThe Asymptote code says:\n\nZ = (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3*sqrt(2));\n\nWait, in complex numbers, the real part is the x-coordinate, and the imaginary part is the y-coordinate. But in the Asymptote code, the pair is (x,y), so the complex number would be x + y i. Wait, but in the problem statement, z is given as 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i.

But to rotate around a different point, I think it's better to translate so that point is the origin, then rotate, then translate back.\n\nBut in our problem, it's the same thing: translate z by subtracting c, then rotate, then translate back. So, our approach aligns with the Asymptote code.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can plug in the coordinates and see if the rotation by 45 degrees (\u03c0/4 radians) counter-clockwise around (2, -3) moves Z to W, as per the Asymptote drawing.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the coordinates of w, which is 6 -5i, so (6, -5). Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me see: Z is at (2 + sqrt(2), -3 -3 sqrt(2)), which is approximately (2 +1.414, -3 -4.242) = (3.414, -7.242). Point C is at (2, -3).
