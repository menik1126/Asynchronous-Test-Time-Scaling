            "output": "To determine the number of trailing zeros in 42!, I need to understand the factors that contribute to trailing zeros.\n\nTrailing zeros in a number are created by multiplying 10s, which are the product of 2 and 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nSince there are more multiples of 2 than 5 between 1 and 42, the number of 5s will limit the number of trailing zeros.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. I do this by dividing 42 by 5 and taking the floor of the result, then dividing by 25 and 125 if necessary.\n\nCalculating the multiples of 5: 42 ÷ 5 = 8.4, so there are 8 multiples of 5.\n\nNext, calculate the multiples of 25 (since 25 contributes an additional 5): 42 ÷ 25 = 1.68, so there is 1 multiple of 25.\n\nThere are no multiples of 125 (125 > 42), so we can ignore this step.\n\nAdding the contributions together: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Contribution of Factors to Trailing Zeros**:\n   - Trailing zeros in a number are created by factors of 10.\n   - Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), each trailing zero is produced by a pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of the number.\n   - In any factorial \\(n!\\), there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\(n\\).\n\n2. **Count the Number of 5s in the Factors of \\(42!\\)**:\n   - **Step 1: Count multiples of 5**:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\quad (\\text{since } 5 \\times 8 = 40 < 42)\n     \\]\n    "
