            "output": "First, I understand that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, I need to find how many pairs of 2s and 5s are in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of times each prime number appears in the factors of 42!. Starting with the prime number 2, I'll divide 42 by 2, then by 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on, until the division results in a non-integer. I'll add up all these quotients to get the total number of 2s in the prime factorization.\n\nAfter that, I'll repeat the same process for the prime number 5. I'll divide 42 by 5, then by 25, and so on, adding the quotients from each division to find the total number of 5s.\n\nFinally, I'll determine the number of trailing zeros by taking the smaller number of pairs of 2s and 5s, which will be the limiting factor in forming the 10s. This will give me the final count of trailing zeros in 42!.\n\nBy following these steps, I can accurately calculate the number of trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), we'll count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). The number of trailing zeros will be the minimum of the count of 2s and 5s.\n\n**Step 1: Count the number of 2s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\).**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{42}{2} &= 21 \\quad (\\text{from 2}) \\\\\n\\frac{42}{4} &= 10.5 \\quad (\\text{from 4}) \\\\\n\\frac{42}{8} &= 5.25 \\quad (\\text{from 8}) \\\\\n\\frac{42}{16} &= 2.625 \\quad (\\text{from 16}) \\\\\n\\frac{42}{32} &= 1.3125 \\quad"
