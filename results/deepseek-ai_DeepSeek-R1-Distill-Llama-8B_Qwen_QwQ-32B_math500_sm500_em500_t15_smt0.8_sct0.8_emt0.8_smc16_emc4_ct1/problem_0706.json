            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: \"How many y-intercepts does the graph of the parabola x = y² - 4y - 1 have?\" Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my parabola graphs, but I think I can figure this out by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that intercepts are points where the graph crosses the axes. The y-intercepts specifically are where the graph crosses the y-axis. Now, the y-axis is where x = 0, right? So, if I want to find the y-intercepts, I need to find all the points (x, y) where x is 0 and y is a real number.\n\nGiven the equation x = y² - 4y - 1, I can substitute x with 0 to find the y-values where this happens. So, substituting, I get:\n\n0 = y² - 4y - 1\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of y. Quadratic equations usually have two solutions, but depending on the discriminant, they could have two real solutions, one real solution, or no real solutions. The discriminant of a quadratic equation ay² + by + c = 0 is given by D = b² - 4ac. If D is positive, there are two real solutions; if D is zero, one real solution; and if D is negative, no real solutions.\n\nIn this case, our quadratic equation is y² - 4y - 1 = 0, so a = 1, b = -4, and c = -1. Let me calculate the discriminant:\n\nD = (-4)² - 4(1)(-1) = 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. Let's do it again carefully. The discriminant formula is b² - 4ac, so plugging in the values:\n\nb² = (-4)² = 16\n\n4ac = 4 * 1 * (-1) = -4\n\nSo, D = 16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20\n\nYes, that's correct. The discriminant is 20, which is positive. That means there are two distinct real roots. So, this quadratic equation has two real y"

            "output": "-values that satisfy x = 0. Therefore, the parabola x = y² - 4y - 1 will cross the y-axis at two points.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes, especially when dealing with equations that aren't in the standard form, it's easy to get confused. Let me just sketch this out mentally. The original equation is x = y² - 4y - 1, which is a parabola that opens to the right because the coefficient of y² is positive (1). So, it's a horizontally opening parabola, which means it spreads out to the right, not up or down.\n\nNow, for a horizontally opening parabola, the vertex is at (h, k), where in the standard form, which is (y - k)² = 4p(x - h). But in this case, our equation is x = y² - 4y - 1. Let me try to write it in vertex form to find the vertex.\n\nTo do that, I can complete the square for the y terms. Starting with:\n\nx = y² - 4y - 1\n\nLet's group the y terms:\n\nx = (y² - 4y) - 1\n\nNow, to complete the square for y² - 4y, I take the coefficient of y, which is -4, divide it by 2 to get -2, and square it to get 4. So, I add and subtract 4 inside the equation:\n\nx = (y² - 4y + 4 - 4) - 1\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = (y² - 4y + 4) - 4 - 1\n\nWhich is:\n\nx = (y - 2)² - 5\n\nSo, in vertex form, the equation becomes:\n\nx = (y - 2)² - 5\n\nTherefore, the vertex is at (h, k) = (-5, 2). Wait, no, actually, in the standard form, it's (y - k)² = 4p(x - h). So, our equation is (y - 2)^2 = 4*(x + 5). Therefore, the vertex is at (h, k) where h = -5 and k = 2. That makes sense because"

            "output": " when you move the -5 to the other side, you get (y - 2)^2 = x + 5. So, the vertex is at (-5, 2). \n\nSince the parabola opens to the right (since the coefficient is positive), it will extend towards the right from the vertex. The y-intercepts are where x = 0, so we can see that the vertex is at x = -5, so moving to the right to x = 0 is possible, and since the parabola opens to the right, it should cross the y-axis (where x=0) at two points. \n\nAlternatively, since the discriminant was positive, that also tells us there are two real solutions, so two y-intercepts. \n\nWait, but let me just confirm by solving the equation 0 = y² -4y -1. Let's compute the roots using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is y = [ -b ± sqrt(D) ] / (2a). \n\nHere, a = 1, b = -4, c = -1. So,\n\ny = [4 ± sqrt(20)] / 2\n\nSimplify sqrt(20) as 2*sqrt(5), so:\n\ny = [4 ± 2*sqrt(5)] / 2\n\nDivide numerator terms by 2:\n\ny = 2 ± sqrt(5)\n\nSo, two real solutions: y = 2 + sqrt(5) and y = 2 - sqrt(5). Since sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, so 2 + 2.236 ≈ 4.236 and 2 - 2.236 ≈ -0.236. Both are real numbers, so that gives two distinct y-intercepts at (0, 2 + sqrt(5)) and (0, 2 - sqrt(5)). \n\nTherefore, the graph of the parabola has two y-intercepts. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the equation. Since the equation is x = y² -4y -1, when x is 0, solving for y gives two solutions, so two points where the graph crosses the y-axis. Since the y-axis is vertical, but the parabola is opening horizontally, so the intercepts are indeed points where"
