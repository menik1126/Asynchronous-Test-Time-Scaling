These numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll list the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. These numbers start from 1 and include 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29.\n\nNow, I'll find the intersection of these two sets. The common elements are the prime numbers that are also odd. Since all prime numbers except for 2 are odd, the intersection includes all prime numbers less than 30 except for 2.\n\nCounting these, there are 9 prime numbers in total that are odd and less than 30.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Sets\n1. **Set of Prime Numbers Less Than 30 (P):**\n   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - The prime numbers less than 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n\n2. **Set of All Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero (O):**\n   - Odd numbers are numbers that can be expressed as \\(2k + 1\\) where \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer.\n   - The set of all odd numbers greater than zero is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, ...\n\n### Step 2: Find the Intersection (P ∩ O)\nThe intersection of two sets consists of all elements that are common to both sets.\n\n- **Prime Numbers in P ∩ O:**\n  - All prime numbers except for the number 2 are odd.\n  - Therefore, the prime numbers in the intersection are: 3, 5, 7, 11"
