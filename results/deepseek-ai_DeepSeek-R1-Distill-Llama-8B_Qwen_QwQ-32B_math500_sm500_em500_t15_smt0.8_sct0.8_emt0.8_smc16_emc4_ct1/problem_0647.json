            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about a quadratic polynomial P(x). Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients. Quadratic means degree 2, so P(x) should look like ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers. Got that.\n\nThen, it gives inequalities: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for all real numbers x. Hmm, so P(x) is sandwiched between two other quadratics everywhere. Also, we know that P(11) = 181. The question asks for P(16).\n\nOkay, so let me parse this. The inequalities tell me that the quadratic P(x) is always above x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and always below 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for any real x. That means P(x) - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) is always non-negative, and (2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3) - P(x) is always non-negative.\n\nWait, so P(x) is between two other quadratics, right? So maybe I can express P(x) as something in between these two.\n\nLet me define P(x) as the average of these two quadratics plus some multiple of a quadratic that's always positive or negative. But since it's between them for all x, maybe P(x) is exactly the average of those two, but shifted by a common quadratic factor? Or perhaps P(x) is equal to (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) plus some non-negative multiple times something, but since it's also less than the other one, it must be squeezed between them.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of P(x) as a linear combination of these two quadratics. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote Q1(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and Q2(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3. So we have Q1(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 Q2(x) for all real x.\n\nSo, that is, for all x, 0 \u2264 Q2(x) - P(x) and 0 \u2264 P(x) - Q1(x).\n\nSo, the difference between Q2"

            "output": "(x) and P(x) is non-negative, and the difference between P(x) and Q1(x) is also non-negative. Therefore, the difference between Q2(x) and Q1(x) is equal to (Q2(x) - P(x)) + (P(x) - Q1(x)), which is non-negative. Let me compute Q2(x) - Q1(x):\n\nQ2(x) - Q1(x) = (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - (x\u00b2 -2x +2) = x\u00b2 -2x +1. \n\nWait, that's x\u00b2 -2x +1, which factors as (x -1)^2. So that's a perfect square, which is always non-negative. So the difference between Q2 and Q1 is (x -1)^2. \n\nTherefore, the upper bound minus the lower bound is (x -1)^2. So the difference between Q2 and Q1 is exactly (x -1)^2, which is non-negative. \n\nTherefore, since P(x) is between Q1 and Q2, then the difference between P(x) and Q1(x) must be some non-negative multiple of (x -1)^2, but scaled down so that it doesn't exceed the total difference. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since Q2(x) - Q1(x) = (x -1)^2, then the difference between the upper and lower bounds is exactly (x -1)^2. Therefore, P(x) must be equal to Q1(x) + k(x)*(x -1)^2, where k(x) is a function between 0 and 1 for all x. But since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, then k(x) must be a constant. Because if k(x) is a function, then unless it's a constant, the expression might not be a quadratic. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that P(x) = Q1(x) + c*(x -1)^2, where c is a constant between 0 and 1. Then, since Q1(x) is quadratic and (x -1)^2 is quadratic, their sum is quadratic. So that would make P(x) a quadratic. Let me check if this works.\n\nLet me compute P(x) = (x\u00b2 -2x +2) + c*(x\u00b2 -2x"

Let me set the two expressions equal:\n\n2x\u00b2 -4x +3 = (1 + c)x\u00b2 + (-2 -2c)x + (2 + c)\n\nSo set coefficients equal:\n\nFor x\u00b2 term: 1 + c = 2 => c = 1\n\nFor x term: -2 -2c = -4. If c=1, then -2 -2*1 = -4, which matches.\n\nFor constant term: 2 + c = 3, which also matches when c=1.\n\nSo when c=1, P(x) = Q2(x). Similarly, when c=0, P(x) = Q1(x). Since the problem says P(x) is between Q1 and Q2 for all x, then c must be between 0 and 1. So c \u2208 [0,1].\n\nBut P(11) is given as 181. So let me compute P(x) at x=11 and set it equal to 181. With P(x) = (1 + c)x\u00b2 + (-2 -2c)x + (2 + c).\n\nWait, but when c=1, P(x) = Q2(x) = 2x\u00b2 -4x +3. Let me compute P(11) in that case:\n\n2*(11)^2 -4*11 +3 = 2*121 -44 +3 = 242 -44 +3 = 201.\n\nBut P(11) is 181, which is less than 201. So that means c must be less than 1.\n\nWait, so perhaps P(x) is equal to Q1(x) + c*(x -1)^2, and"

So P(11) = 101 + c*100 = 101 + 100c.\n\nSet this equal to 181:\n\n101 + 100c = 181\n\nSubtract 101: 100c = 80 => c = 0.8, which is 4/5. \n\nSo c is 4/5, which is between 0 and 1, so that works. \n\nTherefore, P(x) = Q1(x) + (4/5)*(x -1)^2.\n\nLet me verify that this P(x) is indeed between Q1 and Q2 for all x. Since (x -1)^2 is non-negative, adding 4/5 of it to Q1(x) will give a value between Q1(x) and Q1(x) + (x -1)^2, which is exactly Q2(x). Since 4/5 is less than 1, so yes, P(x) is between Q1 and Q2. \n\nTherefore, this seems to satisfy the conditions. \n\nNow, let's write out P(x) explicitly. \n\nFirst, Q1(x) = x\u00b2 -2x +2, so adding (4/5)(x -1)^2:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b2 -2x +2 + (4/5)(x\u00b2 -2x +1)\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nFirst, expand (4/5)(x\u00b2 -2x +1):\n\n= (4/5)x\u00b2 - (8/5)x + 4/5\n\nNow add to Q1(x):\n\nx\u00b2 -2x +2 + (4"
