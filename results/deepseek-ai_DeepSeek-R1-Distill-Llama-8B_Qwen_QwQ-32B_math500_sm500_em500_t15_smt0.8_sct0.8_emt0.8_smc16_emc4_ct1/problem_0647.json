The problem gives me some inequalities that P(x) satisfies for all real numbers x: x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3. Additionally, I know that P(11) = 181. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, so it has the form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real coefficients that I need to determine. My goal is to find these coefficients so that I can then compute P(16).\n\nThe problem gives me two inequalities that P(x) must satisfy for all real x. Let me write those down again:\n\n1. x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x)\n2. P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nSo, P(x) is squeezed between these two quadratics for every real number x. That means P(x) can't go above 2x² - 4x + 3 or below x² - 2x + 2.\n\nSince both inequalities must hold for all x, maybe I can set up some equations by equating P(x) to both the lower and upper bounds at specific points. But wait, the problem gives me a specific value at x=11. Maybe I can use that to find one of the coefficients first.\n\nLet me start by considering the inequality P(x) ≥ x² - 2x + 2. If I subtract x² - 2x + 2 from both sides, I get:\n\nP(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0\nWhich simplifies to:\n(ax² + bx + c) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0\nSo that's:\n(a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all real x.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper inequality P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3, subtracting gives:\n\n2x² - 4x + 3 - P(x) ≥ 0\nWhich is:\n(2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x"

This ensures that they don't cross the x-axis, meaning they don't have real roots, so they're either always non-negative or always non-positive. But since the coefficients of x² are (a - 1) and (2 - a), respectively, we can consider their signs.\n\nWait, actually, for a quadratic to be non-negative for all x, two conditions must be met:\n1. The leading coefficient must be positive.\n2. The discriminant must be less than or equal to zero.\n\nSimilarly, if the quadratic is non-positive, the leading coefficient must be negative, and the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero. But since in the first inequality, (a - 1)x² + ... must be ≥ 0 for all x, and the coefficient (a - 1) must be non-negative. So that gives:\n\na - 1 ≥ 0 => a ≥ 1\n\nSimilarly, for the second inequality, (2 - a)x² + ... must be ≥ 0 for all x, so 2 - a ≥ 0, which implies a ≤ 2.\n\nSo, putting those together, we get that a is between 1 and 2, inclusive: 1 ≤ a ≤ 2.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the discriminant for both quadratics and set them to be ≤ 0.\n\nStarting with the lower bound quadratic: (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nThe discriminant D₁ must satisfy D₁ ≤ 0.\n\nCompute D₁:\n\nD₁ = (b + 2)² - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2)\nThis must be ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound quadratic: (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nCompute its discriminant D₂, which must also be ≤ 0.\n\nD₂ = (-4 - b)² - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c)\nWhich must be ≤ 0.\n\nSo, now I have three inequalities:\n\n1. 1 ≤ a ≤ 2"

So, plugging x=11 into P(x) gives:\n\na*(11)^2 + b*11 + c = 181\nWhich simplifies to:\n121a + 11b + c = 181\n\nSo, that's another equation. Now, let me see what variables I have: a, b, c. So, three variables and three equations (the D₁ ≤ 0, D₂ ≤ 0, and P(11) = 181). Hmm, but maybe I can find more information by considering equality cases. Since the inequalities must hold for all x, perhaps they touch the lower and upper bounds at some points, but since the quadratics don't cross, maybe the inequalities are tight at certain x values. Alternatively, perhaps I can set up systems where both quadratics equal zero at some points, but I might not know those points yet.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about when the lower quadratic equals zero and when the upper quadratic equals zero, maybe at the same x. Let me think: Suppose that for some x = k, both (x² - 2x + 2) = P(k) and 2x² - 4x + 3 = P(k). But that would imply that x² - 2x + 2 = 2x² - 4x + 3. Solving that:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 = 2x² - 4x + 3\n0 = x² - 2x + 1\nWhich factors to (x - 1)^2 = 0, so x = 1 is the only solution. So, at x=1, both the lower and upper quadratics equal P(1). Let's compute P(1) in both cases.\n\nFrom the lower bound, P(1) ≥ 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1\nFrom the upper bound, P(1) ≤ 2*1² -4*1 +3 = 2 -4 + 3 = 1\nSo, P(1) must equal 1.\n\nThus, P(1) = 1.
