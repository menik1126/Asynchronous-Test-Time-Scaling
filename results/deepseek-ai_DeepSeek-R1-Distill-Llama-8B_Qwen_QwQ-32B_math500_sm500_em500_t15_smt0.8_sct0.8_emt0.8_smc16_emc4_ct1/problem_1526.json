Let me try to understand what it's asking.\n\nWe have a sequence of positive real numbers, \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\). The problem gives me three sums:\n\n1. The sum of all the numbers: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n2. The sum of their squares: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n3. The sum of their cubes: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to find the possible values of \\( n \\) given these constraints and then sum those values up.\n\nI remember that when dealing with sums of powers, sometimes we can use inequalities or identities that relate these sums. Maybe the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something like that?\n\nLet me think. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality relates the sum of products to the product of sums. It says that:\n\n\\( (\\sum a_i^2)(\\sum b_i^2) \\geq (\\sum a_i b_i)^2 \\)\n\nBut in this case, I have three different sums. Maybe I should look into the relationships between the sums of squares, cubes, and the linear sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the first and second sums. If I set \\( b_i = 1 \\), then \\( \\sum a_i^2 \\geq \\frac{(\\sum a_i)^2}{n} \\).\n\nLet me try that. So, substituting the given values:\n\n\\( 144 \\geq \\frac{96^2}{n} \\)\n\nCalculating \\( 96^2 \\): 96*96 is 9216.\n\nSo, \\( 144 \\geq \\frac{9216}{n} \\).\n\nRearranging, \\( n \\geq \\frac{9216}{144} \\).\n\nCalculating \\( 9216 ÷ 144 \\): 144*64 = 9216, so \\( n \\geq 64 \\).\n\nSo, n must be at least 64.\n\nHmm, that's"

Or is there a maximum value?\n\nI need to find all possible n's such that there exists a sequence of positive real numbers satisfying the given sums.\n\nPerhaps I need to use another inequality that relates the sum of cubes to the sum of the numbers and the sum of their squares.\n\nI recall that for positive real numbers, the following inequality holds:\n\n\\( \\sum a_i^3 \\leq (\\sum a_i^2)^{3/2} (\\sum 1)^{1/2} \\)\n\nWait, is that correct?

For n>64, to keep S3 at 216, variables must be adjusted such that their cubes sum to 216, but their squares also sum to 144, and linear sum to 96.\n\nBut from the earlier trial, when n=65, it's not possible because one variable has to be zero, which is not allowed. So, perhaps with n=65, you can't have positive variables summing to 96, with squares summing to 144, and cubes to 216.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set more than two variables apart from 1.5.\n\nSuppose with n=65, I have 63 variables at 1.5, one at a, one at b, and one at c.
