            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon, which has side lengths of 16 cm.\n\nA regular hexagon has six equal sides, so the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length by 6.\n\nBy multiplying 16 cm by 6, the total perimeter of the hexagon is 96 cm.\n\nSince the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, it must also have a perimeter of 96 cm.\n\nFinally, I can find the length of each side of the octagon by dividing the total perimeter by the number of sides, which is eight.\n\nSo, each side of the octagon is 96 cm divided by 8, which equals 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:** A regular octagon has the same perimeter as the regular hexagon shown here with side length 16 cm. How long is each side of the octagon?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.\n   - Given that each side of the hexagon is 16 cm.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand the Perimeter of the Octagon:**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has 8 equal sides.\n   - The octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, which is 96 cm.\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of Each Side of the Octagon:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 8 \\times \\text{Side length of octagon}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   96\\, \\text{cm} = 8 \\times \\text{Side length of octagon}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Side length of octagon} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe length of each side of the octagon is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) cm."
