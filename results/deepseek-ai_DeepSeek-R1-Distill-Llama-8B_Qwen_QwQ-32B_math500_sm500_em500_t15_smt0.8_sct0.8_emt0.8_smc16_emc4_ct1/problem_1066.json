            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm and a hexagon has six sides, the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the number of sides by the side length.\n\nNext, I know that the regular octagon has the same perimeter as this hexagon. To find the length of each side of the octagon, I'll divide the total perimeter of the hexagon by the number of sides the octagon has, which is eight.\n\nBy performing these calculations, I can find the length of each side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   - Number of sides in a hexagon: 6\n   - Side length of the hexagon: 16 cm\n   - Perimeter of the hexagon \\( P_{hexagon} = 6 \\times 16 \\) cm = 96 cm\n\n2. **Determine the perimeter of the regular octagon.**\n   - Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon:\n   - \\( P_{octagon} = P_{hexagon} = 96 \\) cm\n\n3. **Find the length of each side of the octagon.**\n   - Number of sides in an octagon: 8\n   - Let \\( s \\) be the side length of the octagon.\n   - Perimeter of the octagon \\( P_{octagon} = 8 \\times s \\)\n   - Solve for \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     8s = 96 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\text{ cm}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{12 \\text{ cm}}\\)"
