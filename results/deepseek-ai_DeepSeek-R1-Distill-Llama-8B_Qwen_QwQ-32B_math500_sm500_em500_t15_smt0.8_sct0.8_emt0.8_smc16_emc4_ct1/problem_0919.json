            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by factoring 84 into its prime factors. That might help me break it down into smaller integers. Let me do that:\n\n84 divided by 2 is 42.  \n42 divided by 2 is 21.  \n21 divided by 3 is 7.  \n7 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7. That means 84 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nNow, since I need distinct positive integers, I can't repeat any numbers. So, I need to combine these prime factors in a way that gives me the smallest possible sum. I remember that to minimize the sum, it's better to have numbers that are as close to each other as possible. So, maybe I shouldn't have too many large numbers because that would make the sum bigger.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should try to make the numbers as small as possible. Since the prime factors are small, that might help.\n\nLet me think about how to split the factors into different numbers. Since 84 has four prime factors, but some are duplicates (two 2s), I need to consider how to group them.\n\nOption 1: Keep all factors as primes. So, 2, 3, 7, and... wait, but 84 is 2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d77, so if I take them as 2, 3, 7, and... what's missing? 2 \u00d7 2 is 4. So, maybe the factors are 2, 3, 7, and 4.\n\nWait, but that's only four numbers: 2, 3, 4, 7. Let me check their product: 2\u00d73\u00d74\u00d77 = 168. Oh, that's way bigger than 84. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.\n\nOh, right, because 2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d77 = 84. So, I can't include 4 as a separate number unless I do 2\u00d72, but since they are duplicates, I can only have each number once. So maybe I can combine them differently.\n\nWait"

The key is that they must multiply to 84 and each number is unique.\n\nLet me start with the smallest possible numbers. Let's see:\n\nStart with 1. Since 1 doesn't affect the product, but adding it would allow me to have more numbers, but since we want the minimal sum, maybe including 1 isn't helpful because it adds 1 to the sum but doesn't contribute to the product. Wait, actually, if I can split the factors into more numbers by including 1, but since 1 doesn't contribute, maybe that's not useful. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I include 1. Then the remaining numbers must multiply to 84. But since 1 is there, the other numbers have to multiply to 84. But since 1 is the smallest, maybe that's not helpful. Let me see an example.\n\nSuppose the set is {1, 2, 3, 14}. Their product is 1\u00d72\u00d73\u00d714 = 84. The sum is 1+2+3+14 = 20. Alternatively, without 1, maybe {2, 3, 14} gives a product of 84, but the sum is 19. Wait, but 2\u00d73\u00d714 is 84, so that's a valid set. The sum is 2+3+14 = 19. Hmm, that's better. So maybe including 1 isn't helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe {2, 3, 7, 2} but duplicates aren't allowed. So that's invalid. So, perhaps the best is to avoid 1.\n\nLet me try different groupings.\n\nFirst, the prime factors are 2, 2, 3, 7. Since they have to be distinct, I need to combine some of them.\n\nOption 1: Combine the two 2s into 4. So the numbers would be 4, 3, 7. Their product is 4\u00d73\u00d77 = 84. The sum is 4+3+7 = 14. That's a good candidate.\n\nOption 2: Combine a 2 and a 3 to make "

As before, their sum is 19. So 14 is better.\n\nOption 4: Combine 3 and 7 to make 21. Then I have 2, 2, 21. But that's duplicates of 2, which isn't allowed, so that's invalid.\n\nOption 5: Combine a 2 with a 3 and a 7, but that would make 42. Then, I have 2, 42. Their product is 2\u00d742 = 84. Sum is 2+42 = 44. That's worse.\n\nWait, maybe I can have more than three numbers, to spread the factors more. Let me see.\n\nWith the prime factors 2,2,3,7, I can split them into more numbers.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 2, 3, 2, 7. But duplicates not allowed, so that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, make two numbers by combining:\n\n- 2\u00d72=4, 3,7. As in option1, sum 14.\n\n- 2\u00d73=6, 2,7. Sum 15.\n\n- 2\u00d77=14, 2,3. Sum19.\n\nAlternatively, can I split into three numbers, without combining any? For example, 2,3,14 (but 14 is 2\u00d77), which we've done.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining a 2 with a 3 to make 6, and leaving 2 and 7 as separate, but that's three numbers: 2,6,7. Sum is 15.\n\nAlternatively, can I have four numbers? Let's see: since 84=2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d77, can I split into four distinct integers greater than 1?\n\nIf I do that, the numbers would be 2,3,7, and perhaps another number. Wait, but 2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d77 is 84, so if I have four numbers, each must be at least 2, but since I can't have duplicates,"

So maybe that's the minimal?\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. What if I split the factors into more numbers but without using 1?\n\nWait, the prime factors are 2,2,3,7. To get more numbers, I need to split the factors into smaller numbers but keeping them distinct. Let's see:\n\nSuppose I take 2, 3, and then split the remaining 2 and 7 into two numbers. But 2 and 7 are primes, so they can't be split further. So that would give 2,3,2,7 again, which duplicates 2. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, can I split one of the factors into 1 and something else? But 1 is allowed, but adding 1 would require the rest to multiply to 84, but that might not help.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe instead of combining the two 2s into 4, I can combine one 2 with the 3 to make 6, and leave the other 2 and 7. So that gives 2,6,7. Sum is 15. But that's worse than 14.\n\nAlternatively, combining 2 and 2 and 3 into 1"

Let me list all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 84 and compute their sums to find the minimal.\n\nPossible sets:\n\n1. {2,3,7,4} \u2192 product=84, sum=16.\n\n2. {2,3,14} \u2192 product=84, sum=19.\n\n3. {2,6,7} \u2192 product=84, sum=15.\n\n4. {3,4,7} \u2192 product=84, sum=14.\n\n5. {1,2,3,14} \u2192 sum=20.\n\n6. {1,3,4,7} \u2192 sum=15.\n\nSo from these, the minimal sum is 14 from the set {3,4,7}.\n\nWait, is there a set with a smaller sum?\n\nLet me think if I can have a 5 in the set. 5 doesn't divide 84, so no.\n\nOr 8: 84 divided by 8 is 10.5, which is not integer.\n\nOr 9: 84 \u00f79=9.333, not integer.\n\nWait, maybe using 6: but I already considered that.\n\nAlternatively, can I have smaller numbers?\n\nFor example:\n\n- {2,3,4,7} \u2192 but that's four numbers, product 2\u00d73\u00d74\u00d77=168>84, so not possible.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to get numbers smaller than 4, like 2,3, and then split 7 into 1 and 7, but that's not allowed because 1\u00d77 is allowed, but {2,3,1,7} is four numbers with sum 20, which we've considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe {2,2,3,7} but duplicates not allowed. So no.\n\nWait, another approach: since the product is fixed at 84, to minimize the sum, it's better to have numbers as close as possible to each other in value. Because of the AM-GM inequality, the sum is minimized when the numbers are equal or as close as possible.\n\nBut 84 is 2\u00d72\u00d73\u00d77, so the numbers we can have are 2,3,4,7 as above"

So numbers like 2,3, something, but as we saw, the four-number sets have higher sums.\n\nSo the three-number set {3,4,7} with sum 14 is better.\n\nIs there a way to get a sum lower than 14?\n\nLet me see.
