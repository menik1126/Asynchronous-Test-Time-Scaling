            "output": "First, I need to understand the problem: find a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84 and determine the smallest possible sum of these numbers.\n\nI should start by factoring 84 into its prime factors. Breaking it down, 84 is equal to 2 multiplied by 42, and 42 is 2 multiplied by 21, and 21 is 3 multiplied by 7. So, the prime factorization of 84 is 2² × 3 × 7.\n\nNext, I want to create a set of distinct positive integers from these prime factors. Since all the factors are multiplied together to get 84, I need to consider different combinations of these prime factors to form the set.\n\nI can form the number 12 by multiplying 2, 2, and 3. So, the set could be {2, 7, 12}. The sum of these numbers is 2 + 7 + 12, which equals 21.\n\nAlternatively, another combination is {3, 4, 7}. Multiplying these together gives 3 × 4 × 7, which also equals 84. The sum here is 3 + 4 + 7, totaling 14.\n\nAnother possible set is {4, 3, 7}, but this is the same as the previous one, just reordered. \n\nLooking for smaller sets, a single number would be 84 itself, but the sum would just be 84, which is larger than the set of three numbers.\n\nThere's also the possibility of using the number 2 twice, but since the integers must be distinct, this isn't allowed.\n\nComparing the sums of the different sets, the set {3, 4, 7} has the smallest sum of 14.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we start by factoring 84 into its prime components:\n\n\\[\n84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\n\nNext, we explore combinations of these prime factors to create distinct integers while keeping their product equal to 84. The goal is to minimize the sum of these integers.\n\n1. **Combination {2, 6, 7}**:\n   - Product: \\(2 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 84\\)\n   - Sum: \\(2 + 6 + 7 = 15\\)\n\n2"
