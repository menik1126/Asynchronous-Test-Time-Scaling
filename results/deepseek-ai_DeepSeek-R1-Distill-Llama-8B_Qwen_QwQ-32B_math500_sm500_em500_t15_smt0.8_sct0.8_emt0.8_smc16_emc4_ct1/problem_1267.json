            "output": "I need to solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\). \n\nFirst, I'll simplify the right side of the equation. Since \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) is the square root of 256, and the square root of 256 is 16, the equation becomes \\(2^{2x} = 16\\).\n\nNext, I'll express 16 as a power of 2. Knowing that \\(16 = 2^4\\), the equation now is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n\nSince the bases on both sides of the equation are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. This gives me \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, which results in \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Right Side:**\n   \n   First, calculate \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), which is the square root of 256.\n   \\[\n   256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{256} = 16\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 16\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express 16 as a Power of 2:**\n   \n   Recognize that \\(16\\) can be written as \\(2^4\\):\n   \\[\n   16 = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   Now, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the Exponents Equal:**\n   \n   Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
