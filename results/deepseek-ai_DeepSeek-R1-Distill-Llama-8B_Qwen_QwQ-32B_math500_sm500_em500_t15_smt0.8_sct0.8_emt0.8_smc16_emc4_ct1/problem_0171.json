Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the equation given is \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\). I remember that cube roots can be dealt with by cubing both sides of the equation to eliminate the radical. That should help simplify things.\n\nSo, if I cube both sides, I get \\( (\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3 \\). That simplifies to \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3 \\). Let me calculate what \\( 16^3 \\) is. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16... let's see, 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536, so adding those together gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, now the equation is \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \\).\n\nNext, I think I should bring 4096 to the left side to form a quadratic equation. So, subtracting 4096 from both sides gives \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0 \\). Simplifying that, 4 minus 4096 is -4092, so the equation becomes \\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\).\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\). To solve for \\( x \\), I can use the quadratic formula, which is \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -4092 \\).\n\nPlugging in those values, we get \\( x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092)}}{2(1)} \\). Simplifying the numerator, the negative of negative 4 is 4. Inside the square root, \\("

            "output": " (-4)^2 \\) is 16, and \\( 4(1)(-4092) \\) is -16368. So, the discriminant becomes \\( 16 - (-16368) \\), which is 16 + 16368. Let me add those together: 16 + 16368 is 16384.\n\nSo now, the equation is \\( x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16384}}{2} \\). I need to find the square root of 16384. Hmm, let me think. I know that 128 squared is 16384 because \\( 128 \\times 128 \\) is 16384. Let me double-check: 128 times 100 is 12800, 128 times 28 is 3584, and 12800 + 3584 is indeed 16384. So, \\( \\sqrt{16384} = 128 \\).\n\nNow, plugging that back into the equation, we have \\( x = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2} \\). So, that gives two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66 \\)\n2. \\( x = \\frac{4 - 128}{2} = \\frac{-124}{2} = -62 \\)\n\nBut the question asks for the positive value of \\( x \\), so we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the positive solution is 66.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation, cubing both sides correctly gave me \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \\). Subtracting 4096 correctly led to \\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\). Applying the quadratic formula with a=1, b=-4, c=-4092. That seems right. Calculated the discriminant as 16384, whose square root is 128. Then, the solutions were 66 and -62, with 66 being positive. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I'm confident with this answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for the positive value of \\( x \\) such that \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\), we proceed as follows"
