            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: Let n be a positive integer. What is the greatest possible value of gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)? Hmm, I need to find the maximum value of the greatest common divisor of these two expressions. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that divides both n + 7 and 2n + 1. Maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm for this since it helps in finding the gcd of two numbers.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying division and taking remainders. So, let me apply that to n + 7 and 2n + 1. Let me denote a = 2n + 1 and b = n + 7. Then, according to the Euclidean algorithm, gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b).\n\nFirst, let's compute a mod b. To do that, I can express a in terms of b. Let me write 2n + 1 as 2*(n + 7) - 13. Wait, let me check that:\n\n2*(n + 7) = 2n + 14. So, 2n + 1 = 2*(n + 7) - 13. Yes, that's correct because 2n + 14 - 13 = 2n + 1. So, now, a can be written as 2b - 13, where b is n + 7. Therefore, when I divide a by b, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is -13. But since we're dealing with positive remainders, -13 mod b is the same as b - 13.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to express it in a more standard way. Let's compute a mod b. So, a = 2n + 1, and b = n + 7. So, we can write 2n + 1 = 2*(n + 7) - 13. Thus, when we divide a by b, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is -13. But since -13 is negative, the actual remainder is b - 13, which is (n + 7) - 13 = n"

            "output": " - 6. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the remainder as follows: Let me divide 2n + 1 by n + 7. The division algorithm states that 2n + 1 = q*(n + 7) + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder, which must be less than n + 7 in absolute value. Let's see:\n\nDividing 2n +1 by n +7. The leading term is 2n divided by n, so the quotient is 2. Multiply 2*(n +7) = 2n +14. Subtract that from 2n +1: (2n +1) - (2n +14) = -13. So the remainder is -13. Since the remainder must be positive, we can add (n +7) to it? Wait, no, actually, the remainder is typically taken as a non-negative integer less than the divisor. Since the remainder here is -13, which is negative, we can adjust it by adding the divisor (n +7) to make it positive. So, the remainder would be ( -13 + (n +7) ) = n -6. But that's only if we want the remainder to be positive. However, in the Euclidean algorithm, the remainder can technically be negative, but the gcd is the same regardless. So, gcd(2n +1, n +7) = gcd(n +7, -13). Since gcd is always non-negative, gcd(n +7, 13). Because gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b), and here a mod b is -13, so gcd(b, | -13 |) = gcd(n +7, 13).\n\nWait, so that simplifies the problem to finding the gcd of n +7 and 13. Therefore, the gcd(n +7, 2n +1) is equal to gcd(n +7, 13). Therefore, the gcd can only be a divisor of 13. Since 13 is prime, its divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the gcd is either 1 or 13. Therefore, the greatest possible value is 13, provided that 13 divides both n +7"

Let's set up the congruence:\n\nn +7 \u2261 0 mod 13 \u21d2 n \u2261 -7 mod13 \u21d2 n \u2261 6 mod13.\n\nNow, check if 2n +1 is divisible by 13 when n \u22616 mod13.\n\n2*6 +1 =13 \u22610 mod13. Yes, that's correct. So when n \u22616 mod13, both n +7 and 2n +1 are divisible by 13, hence gcd(n +7, 2n +1) =13.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value is 13.\n\nWait, but just to make sure there isn't a higher possible value. Since 13 is prime, and we've shown that the gcd can be 13, and cannot be higher than 13 because 13 is prime, so 13 is the maximum possible gcd.\n\nSo, to recap, by using the Euclidean algorithm, I found that gcd(n +7, 2n +1) = gcd(n +7, 13), which can only be 1 or 13. Therefore, the maximum is 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible value is \\boxed{13}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\), we use the Euclidean algorithm.
