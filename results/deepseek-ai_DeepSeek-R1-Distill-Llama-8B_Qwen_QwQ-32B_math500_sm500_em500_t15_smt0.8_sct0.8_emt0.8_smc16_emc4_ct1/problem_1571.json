            "output": "Okay, so I've got this expression to simplify: the square root of a fraction, where the numerator is (5 divided by the square root of 80) plus (the square root of 845 divided by 9) plus the square root of 45, and all of that is divided by the square root of 5. That sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the expression. It's a square root of a fraction. The numerator of that fraction is a sum of three terms: 5 over sqrt(80), sqrt(845)/9, and sqrt(45). The denominator of the fraction is sqrt(5). So, writing it out, it's like sqrt[(5/sqrt(80) + sqrt(845)/9 + sqrt(45)) / sqrt(5)].\n\nHmm, maybe I should handle the numerator first. Let me write down each term separately to see if I can simplify them.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 over sqrt(80). I know that sqrt(80) can be simplified because 80 is 16 times 5, and 16 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5) which is sqrt(16)*sqrt(5) = 4*sqrt(5). So, 5 over sqrt(80) is 5/(4*sqrt(5)). Maybe I can simplify that by rationalizing the denominator.\n\nTo rationalize 5/(4*sqrt(5)), I can multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5). That gives (5*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(5)*sqrt(5)) = (5*sqrt(5))/(4*5) = (5*sqrt(5))/20 = sqrt(5)/4.\n\nOkay, so the first term simplifies to sqrt(5)/4.\n\nNext, the second term in the numerator is sqrt(845)/9. Let's try to simplify sqrt(845). 845 is 5 times 169 because 5*169 is 845. And 169 is 13 squared. So, sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*169) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(169) = 13*sqrt(5). So, sqrt(845)/9 is (13*sqrt(5))/9.\n\nSo, the second term becomes (13*sqrt("

            "model": "small",
            "output": "5))/9.\n\nThe third term is sqrt(45). Again, let's simplify that. 45 is 9*5, so sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) = sqrt(9)*sqrt(5) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo, now the numerator of our main fraction is the sum of these three terms: sqrt(5)/4 + (13*sqrt(5))/9 + 3*sqrt(5).\n\nI can factor out sqrt(5) from all terms, so that would be sqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Now, I need to compute the sum inside the parentheses.\n\nLet me find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. So, converting each fraction:\n\n1/4 is (9/36), 13/9 is (52/36), and 3 is 108/36. Wait, let me check: 1/4 = 9/36, 13/9 = (13*4)/(9*4) = 52/36, and 3 is 3/1, which to get denominator 36 is 108/36. So, adding them together: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = (169)/36.\n\nSo, the sum inside the parentheses is 169/36. Therefore, the numerator of the main fraction is sqrt(5) * (169/36) = (169*sqrt(5))/36.\n\nNow, the entire expression is the square root of that fraction: sqrt[(169*sqrt(5))/36 divided by sqrt(5)].\n\nWait, let me make sure I have that right. The main expression is sqrt[(numerator)/sqrt(5)] where numerator is (169*sqrt(5))/36. So, inside the square root, it's [(169*sqrt(5))/36] divided by sqrt(5).\n\nSo, let's write that out: (169*sqrt(5)/36) / sqrt(5). Dividing by sqrt(5) is the same as multiplying by 1/sqrt(5). So, we have (169*sqrt(5)/36) * (1/sqrt"

            "output": "(5)).\n\nThe sqrt(5) in the numerator and denominator will cancel out, so that simplifies to 169/(36).\n\nNow, I have to take the square root of 169/36. The square root of 169 is 13, and the square root of 36 is 6. So, sqrt(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 13/6.\n\nWait, let me go through that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the numerator:\n\n5/sqrt(80) = 5/(4*sqrt(5)) = sqrt(5)/4 after rationalizing.\n\nsqrt(845) = 13*sqrt(5), so sqrt(845)/9 = 13*sqrt(5)/9.\n\nsqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nAdding them up: sqrt(5)/4 + 13*sqrt(5)/9 + 3*sqrt(5).\n\nFactoring sqrt(5): sqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nConverting to common denominator 36:\n\n1/4 = 9/36, 13/9 = 52/36, 3 = 108/36. Sum is 169/36.\n\nSo numerator becomes sqrt(5)*169/36.\n\nThen, the entire expression is sqrt[(sqrt(5)*169/36)/sqrt(5)].\n\nWhich simplifies to sqrt[(169/36)] = 13/6. That seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression, we start by simplifying each term in the numerator:\n\n1.
