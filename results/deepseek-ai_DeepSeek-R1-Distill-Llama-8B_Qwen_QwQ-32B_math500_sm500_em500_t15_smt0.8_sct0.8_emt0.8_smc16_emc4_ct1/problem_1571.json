            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of a fraction, where the numerator is (5 divided by the square root of 80) plus (the square root of 845 divided by 9) plus the square root of 45, and all of that is divided by the square root of 5. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should deal with each term in the numerator separately. Maybe if I can simplify each part, it'll make the whole thing easier to handle.\n\nStarting with the first term in the numerator: 5 divided by the square root of 80. I know that dividing by a square root is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so that's 5 over sqrt(80). But sqrt(80) seems like it can be simplified. Let me factor 80. 80 is 16 times 5, right? And 16 is a perfect square. So sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5) which is sqrt(16) times sqrt(5). That's 4 times sqrt(5). So now, the first term becomes 5 divided by (4 sqrt(5)). Hmm, can I simplify that further? Maybe. Let me see.\n\nIf I have 5 over (4 sqrt(5)), maybe I can rationalize the denominator. To do that, I multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5), which gives me (5 sqrt(5)) over (4*5), since sqrt(5) times sqrt(5) is 5. So that simplifies to (5 sqrt(5))/20. Then, I can reduce 5/20 to 1/4, so it becomes (1/4) sqrt(5). Got it, so the first term simplifies to sqrt(5)/4.\n\nOkay, moving on to the second term: sqrt(845) divided by 9. Let me see if 845 can be broken down. Hmm, 845 divided by 5 is 169, because 5 times 169 is 845. And 169 is 13 squared, so that's a perfect square. So sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*169) which is sqrt(5)*sqrt(169) or 13 sqrt(5). So now, the second term becomes (13 sqrt(5))/9. I don't think this"

            "model": "small",
            "output": " can be simplified any further, so that's the second term done.\n\nThe third term is sqrt(45). Let's factor 45: that's 9 times 5, and 9 is a perfect square. So sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) which is 3 sqrt(5). So the third term is 3 sqrt(5).\n\nNow, putting all three terms back into the numerator: (sqrt(5)/4) + (13 sqrt(5)/9) + 3 sqrt(5). I need to add these together. Since they all have sqrt(5) in them, I can factor that out and add the coefficients. Let me write them with a common denominator to add them.\n\nThe denominators I have are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 sqrt(5) is like 3 sqrt(5)/1). The least common denominator for 4, 9, and 1 is 36. So I need to convert each term to have 36 as the denominator.\n\nFirst term: (sqrt(5)/4) becomes (9 sqrt(5))/36 because 4 times 9 is 36.\n\nSecond term: (13 sqrt(5)/9) becomes (52 sqrt(5))/36 because 9 times 5 is 45, so I multiply numerator and denominator by 5 to get 52 sqrt(5)/36.\n\nThird term: 3 sqrt(5)/1 becomes (108 sqrt(5))/36 because 1 times 108 is 108.\n\nNow, adding them together: (9 sqrt(5) + 52 sqrt(5) + 108 sqrt(5))/36.\n\nAdding the numerators: 9 + 52 is 61, and 61 + 108 is 169. So that gives (169 sqrt(5))/36.\n\nSo now, the entire expression under the square root in the numerator is (169 sqrt(5))/36. But remember, all of this is divided by sqrt(5), which is the denominator in the original fraction. So the whole expression is sqrt[(169 sqrt(5)/36) / sqrt(5)].\n\nLet me write that as sqrt[(169 sqrt(5) ) / (36 sqrt(5))]. Because when you divide fractions, you multiply by the reciprocal, so it's like multiplying (169 sqrt(5))/36 by 1/sqrt(5). \n\n"

            "output": "Now, sqrt[(169 sqrt(5))/(36 sqrt(5))]. Let's see, the sqrt(5) in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out. So sqrt(169/36). Because sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(a)/sqrt(b), so sqrt(169) is 13, sqrt(36) is 6, so it's 13/6.\n\nWait a second, is that correct? Let me check my steps again. I had sqrt[(169 sqrt(5))/(36 sqrt(5))], and since sqrt(5) is in both numerator and denominator, they should cancel out. So it's sqrt(169/36). Then, sqrt(169) is 13, sqrt(36) is 6, so yes, 13/6.\n\nSo the entire original expression simplifies to 13/6. Hmm, that seems too simple, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Simplify each term:\n   - 5/sqrt(80) => 5/(4 sqrt(5)) => sqrt(5)/4\n   - sqrt(845)/9 => 13 sqrt(5)/9\n   - sqrt(45) => 3 sqrt(5)\n\n2. Add them together: sqrt(5)/4 + 13 sqrt(5)/9 + 3 sqrt(5)\n   - Convert to common denominator 36:\n     - sqrt(5)/4 = 9 sqrt(5)/36\n     - 13 sqrt(5)/9 = 52 sqrt(5)/36\n     - 3 sqrt(5) = 108 sqrt(5)/36\n   - Sum numerators: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169 => 169 sqrt(5)/36\n\n3. Divide by sqrt(5): (169 sqrt(5)/36) / sqrt(5) = 169/36\n\n4. Take square root: sqrt(169/36) = 13/6\n\nYes, that all checks out. So the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break down the original expression step by step to simplify it into a fraction.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify Each Term in the Numerator**\n\n1. **First Term:** \\( \\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}} \\)\n   - Factor 80: \\( 80 = "
