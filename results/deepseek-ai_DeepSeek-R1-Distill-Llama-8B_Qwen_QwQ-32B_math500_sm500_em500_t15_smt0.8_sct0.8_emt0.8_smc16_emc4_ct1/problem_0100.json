The equation given is:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x-3}+\\frac{D}{x+8}=\\frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}\\]\n\nHmm, this looks like a partial fractions problem. I remember that when you have a rational function, you can decompose it into simpler fractions. The denominator on the right side is a quadratic, so let me factor that first.\n\nThe denominator is \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let's see, 8 and -3? Yeah, 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, the denominator factors as (x + 8)(x - 3). \n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\]\n\nNow, I know that to combine the left side, I'll need a common denominator, which is the same as the right side. So, I can write:\n\n\\[\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\]\n\nSince the denominators are equal, the numerators must be equal too:\n\n\\[C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\\]\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation where I need to solve for C and D. Since this is true for all real x except -8 and 3, the coefficients of like terms must be equal on both sides.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nC(x) + 8C + D(x) - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, I can set up a system of equations by equating the coefficients of x and the constant terms.\n\nFirst, the coefficients of x:\n\nC + D = "

Let me solve this system.\n\nFrom equation (1): C = 4 - D\n\nI can substitute this into equation (2):\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = 5\n\nNow, plugging D = 5 back into equation (1):\n\nC + 5 = 4\n\nSo, C = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nAlright, so C is -1 and D is 5. The product CD would be (-1)*5 = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the right-hand side after factoring is correct. I set up the equation correctly by equating numerators.\n\nWhen I expanded, that seems right. Then equating the coefficients, yes. \n\nThen solving for C and D: from C + D =4 and 8C -3D=-23.\n\nSubstituting C =4 - D into the second equation:\n\n8*(4 - D) -3D = 32 -8D -3D = 32 -11D = -23\n\nThen 32 +23 = 11D => 55 = 11D => D=5.\n\nThen C =4 -5= -1. So, yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, CD = (-1)*5= -5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe product \\(CD\\) is \\boxed{-5}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the product \\(CD\\) of the integers \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) for which\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nwe start by factoring the denominator on the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 5x - 24 = (x + 8)(x - 3)\n\\]\n\nThis allows us to rewrite"
