The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that when you see an equation like this, where two fractions add up to another fraction, it might be a good idea to combine the left side into a single fraction and then compare it to the right side.\n\nFirst, I need to find a common denominator for the left side. The denominators are (x - 3) and (x + 8), so the common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). That makes sense because multiplying these two would eliminate the denominators when I add the fractions.\n\nSo, I can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait, I should note that the denominator on the right side is a quadratic. Let me factor that to see if it matches the common denominator I just used. The quadratic is x² + 5x - 24. To factor that, I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3. Because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, the quadratic factors as (x + 8)(x - 3), which matches the common denominator. That's good, so the left side and the right side have the same denominator, which means their numerators must be equal for the equation to hold for all x (except x = 3 and x = -8, where the original denominators are zero, which is why x can't be 3 or -8).\n\nSo, let's combine the fractions on the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)("

            "output": "x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are equal, the numerators must be equal:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nOkay, so now I have an equation without denominators. Let me expand the left side:\n\nC times (x + 8) is Cx + 8C.\n\nD times (x - 3) is Dx - 3D.\n\nSo adding these together:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = (C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nSo the left side is (C + D)x + (8C - 3D), and it's equal to the right side, which is 4x - 23.\n\nTherefore, I can set up a system of equations by equating the coefficients of like terms. So, for the x terms:\n\nC + D = 4  ...(1)\n\nAnd for the constant terms:\n\n8C - 3D = -23  ...(2)\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables, C and D. Since C and D are integers, I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nLet me substitute this into equation (2):\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n8*4 is 32, so 32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine the D terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5.\n\nSo, D is 5.\n\nNow, substitute D = 5 back into equation (1):\n\nC + 5 = 4\n\nSo, C = 4 - 5 = -1.\n\nOkay, so C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nTherefore, the product CD is (-1) * 5 = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, from equation (1), C + D = 4."

            "output": " If D is 5, then C is 4 - 5 = -1, that's correct.\n\nThen, substituting into equation (2), 8*(-1) is -8, and 8C is -8, and 8C - 3D is -8 - 15, because 3D is 15 (since D =5, 3*5=15). So -8 -15 is -23, which matches the right side. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can cross-verify by plugging C = -1 and D =5 back into the left side's numerator and see if it equals 4x -23.\n\nSo, numerator would be (-1)(x +8) +5(x -3) = -x -8 +5x -15.\n\nCombine like terms: (-x +5x) =4x, and (-8 -15) = -23. So, 4x -23, which matches the right side. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product CD is (-1)(5)= -5.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.
