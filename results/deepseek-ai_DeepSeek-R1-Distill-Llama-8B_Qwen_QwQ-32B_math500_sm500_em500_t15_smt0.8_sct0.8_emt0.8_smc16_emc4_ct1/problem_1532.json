The problem states:\n\nLet $(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)$ be a sequence of positive real numbers, such that\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i = 96, \\quad \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2 = 144, \\quad \\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^3 = 216.\n\\]\nFind the sum of all possible values of $n$.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, we're given the sum of the first powers, second powers, and third powers of these numbers. And we need to find possible n and sum them up. \n\nFirst, let me recall that for sums of powers, sometimes we can use inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or H\u00f6lder's inequality to relate them. Also, maybe the Power Mean Inequality could be useful here. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider these as moments of a probability distribution if we normalize the variables, but I'm not sure if that's the right path.\n\nAlternatively, another thought: maybe all the sequences are equal, meaning each a_i is the same. That is, the sequence is composed of identical numbers. If that's the case, then each a_i would be 96/n. Let me check what that would imply.\n\nSo, if each a_i = 96/n, then the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)^2 = 96^2 / n. Similarly, the sum of cubes would be n*(96/n)^3 = 96^3 / n^2.\n\nGiven the problem gives us sum of squares = 144 and sum of cubes = 216, let me write that down:\n\nSo, 96^2 / n = 144, and 96^3 / n^2 = 216.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me compute 96^2 and 96^3.\n\n96^2 is 9216, and 96^3 is 96*96*96 = 884736.\n\nSo, 9216 / n = 144, which would give n = 9216 / 144 = 64.\n\nSimilarly, 884736 / n^2 = 216, so n^2"

So total is 4000 + 96 = 4096. So n^2 = 4096, so n = 64. \n\nSo, if all the a_i are equal, then n must be 64. So that's one possible value of n. But the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n,\" so maybe there are other possibilities?\n\nHmm, so maybe there are sequences where not all a_i are equal, but still satisfy the given sums. So, perhaps n can be different?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal n is 64, but can n be smaller?\n\nWait, let me think. Let me consider the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that (sum a_i^2)(sum 1^2) >= (sum a_i)^2. Here, sum a_i^2 = 144, sum a_i = 96, so (144)(n) >= (96)^2. Let's check that:\n\n144n >= 9216, so n >= 9216 / 144 = 64. So n must be at least 64. So that's interesting. So the minimal possible n is 64, which is achieved when all a_i are equal. So n can't be less than 64. But can it be more?\n\nWait, but if n is more than 64, then the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality would still hold, but the equality holds only when all a_i are equal. So if n is greater than 64, then the inequality would still be satisfied, but the equality condition is not met. However, the problem is asking for sequences where the sum of squares is exactly 144.

If n is larger, then maybe we can have more variables, but since they have to be positive, perhaps we can have sequences that are not all equal but still satisfy the sum conditions. But is that possible?\n\nWait, I need to check if for n > 64, is it possible to have the sum of a_i = 96, sum a_i^2 = 144, and sum a_i^3 = 216?\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the variance or something. Wait, if n=64, all a_i are equal, so the variance is zero. For n >64, can we have a variance that's not zero? Let me compute the variance.\n\nVariance would be (sum a_i^2)/n - (sum a_i / n)^2. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\nVariance = 144/n - (96/n)^2.\n\nSo, when n=64, variance is zero. For n>64, variance becomes positive, so we can have varying a_i's. But does this still satisfy the sum of cubes being 216?\n\nHmm, maybe I can model this as variables with certain constraints.\n\nAnother approach: Let\u2019s think of the variables as roots of a polynomial. If we have n variables a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, all positive. Let me think about the elementary symmetric sums.\n\nLet me denote s1 = sum a_i = 96,\n\ns2 = sum a_i^2 = 144,\n\ns3 = sum a_i^3 = 216.\n\nBut I don't know if this will help directly. Maybe through Newton's identities, which relate the power sums to the elementary symmetric sums.\n\nWait, Newton's identities could be useful here because they allow us to compute elementary symmetric sums from the power sums. So, maybe I can set up equations using that.\n\nNewton's identities relate the sums of powers to the elementary symmetric sums, which are the coefficients of the polynomial whose roots are the a_i's. So, if I denote e_k as the elementary symmetric sum of degree k, then we have:\n\ns1 = e1,\n\ns2 = e1 s1 - 2 e2,\n\ns3 = e1 s2 - e2 s1 + 3 e3.\n\nWait, let me recall the exact form. Newton's"

Let me try a simple case where n is 64 + m for some m, and see if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering that the given sequences have first three moments fixed, so the structure of the numbers must be such that those moments are fixed. Perhaps all but a few of the terms are the same?\n\nWait, another idea: Let's suppose that there are two distinct values, like some of the a_i are equal to a and others are equal to b.

So, perhaps for all other n>64, the sum of cubes won't be an integer, hence, no solution exists except for n=64.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"sequence of positive real numbers,\" so they can be real, not necessarily integers. So, for example, in the case where m=30, we have a sum of cubes\u2248220.8, which is different from216.\n\nBut that's a problem because the sum of cubes is given as exactly216.\n\nWait, so is there a value of m where equation3 gives exactly216? Let me check for m=16.\n\nWait, for m=16,\n\nt=3,\n\nk=8,\n\na=3,\n\nb=1,\n\nsum of cubes=8*27 +72*1=216 +72=288,\n\nWhich is more than 216,\n\nFor m=16, sum cubes=288,\n\nFor m=24, sum cubes=240,\n\nFor m=30, sum cubes\u2248220.8,\n\nFor m=32, let's check:\n\nm=32,\n\nt=48/32=1.5,\n\nk=32\u00b2/(48-32)=1024/16=64,\n\nn=96\u221232=64,\n\nSo, variables:64 a's and0 b's,\n\nSo, a=1.5b,\n\nBut since n=64, and we have k=64, so all variables are a,\n\nThus, a=1.5b,\n\nBut then, sum a_i=64 a=96,\n\nThus, a=96/64=1.5,\n\nSo, a=1.5,\n\nSum cubes=64*(1.5)^3=64*3.375=216,\n\nWhich works. So, for m=32, n=64, a=1.5, b=1,\n\nThus, all a_i's are1.5, so n=64.\n\nSo, that's the case where all variables are equal,"
