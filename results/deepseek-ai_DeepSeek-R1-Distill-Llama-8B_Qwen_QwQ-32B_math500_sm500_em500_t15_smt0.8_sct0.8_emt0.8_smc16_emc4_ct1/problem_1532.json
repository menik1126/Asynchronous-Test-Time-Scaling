Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given:\n\nWe have a sequence \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\) of positive real numbers. The sums provided are:\n\n1. The sum of the first powers: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n2. The sum of the squares: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n3. The sum of the cubes: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nAnd the task is to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\). \n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to figure out what possible values \\( n \\) can take given these constraints. This probably involves some inequalities because we're dealing with sums of powers, and maybe something related to variance or moments?\n\nWait, before jumping into that, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or Power Mean inequality? Let me recall those.\n\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in its basic form says that for sequences \\( (a_i) \\) and \\( (b_i) \\), we have:\n\n\\( (\\sum a_i b_i)^2 \\leq (\\sum a_i^2)(\\sum b_i^2) \\)\n\nBut not sure if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, the Power Mean inequality states that for positive real numbers, the mean of higher powers is greater than or equal to the mean of lower powers. Specifically, for \\( r > s \\), we have:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i^r \\right)^{1/r} \\geq \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i^s \\right)^{1/s} \\)\n\nIn our case, we have the means for exponents 1, 2, and 3. So, let's compute the means and see if we can find some inequalities.\n\nFirst, the arithmetic mean (AM):\n\n\\( AM = \\frac{96}{n} \\)\n\nNext, the quadratic mean (QM):\n\n\\( QM"

Maybe using the ratios.\n\nFrom the first term:\n\nx = m a,\n\np = m a^2 ⇒ p = a * x,\n\nSimilarly, q = (n - m) b,\n\nand y = (n - m) b ⇒ q = b * y,\n\nSimilarly, r = m a^3 = a^2 * x,\n\ns = (n - m) b^3 = b^2 * y,\n\nSo, now, express p, q, r, s in terms of a, b, x, y.\n\np = a x,\n\nq = b y,\n\nr = a^2 x,\n\ns = b^2 y,\n\nSo,\n\np + q = a x + b y =144,\n\nr + s = a^2 x + b^2 y =216,\n\nWe also have x + y =96.\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. a x + b y =144,\n\n2. a² x + b² y =216,\n\n3. x + y =96.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation 3: y =96 -x.\n\nSubstitute into equations 1 and 2.\n\nEquation 1: a x + b (96 -x ) =144 ⇒ (a - b) x +96 b =144\n\nEquation 2: a² x + b² (96 -x ) =216 ⇒ (a² - b² )x +96 b² =216\n\nLet me write equations 1 and 2 as:\n\n1. (a - b) x =144 -96 b\n\n2. (a + b)(a - b)x =216 -96 b²\n\nFrom equation 1, x=(144 -96 b)/(a - b)\n\nFrom equation 2, (a + b)(a - b)x = (a + b)(144 -96 b )\n\nBut x is from equation 1, so:\n\n(a + b)(144 -96 b ) = 216 -96 b²\n\nLet me expand left side:\n\nLeft side: 144(a + b) -96 b(a + b )=144 a +144 b -96 ab -96 b²\n\nRight side:216 -96 b²\n\nThus, equation:\n\n144 a +144 b -96 ab -96 b² ="
