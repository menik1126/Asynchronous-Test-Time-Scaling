            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here about a hot-air balloon setup with points A, B, C, D, and O on a flat field. O is the origin, and points A, B, C, D are positioned north, west, south, and east of O respectively. The balloon is at point H directly above O. There are four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD, each connecting H to A, B, C, and D. The lengths given are HC = 150 m and HD = 130 m. The task is to replace these two ropes with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the line segment CD, and figure out the greatest length we can save by doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this setup. Let me try sketching a rough mental picture. O is the center, and H is directly above it. So, if I were to imagine O at (0,0), H would be at (0, h) where h is the height of the balloon above O. Points A, B, C, D are at (0, a), (-b, 0), (0, -a), and (b, 0) respectively. So, A is north, B is west, C is south, and D is east.\n\nGiven that HC is 150 m and HD is 130 m, that gives us the distances from H to C and H to D. So, using the coordinates, distance HC can be calculated using the distance formula. Let me denote O as the origin (0,0). Then, C is at (0, -a), so HC is the line from H(0, h) to C(0, -a). The distance HC would be h + a, because they're both on the y-axis. Similarly, HD is the distance from H(0, h) to D(b, 0). Using the distance formula, HD is sqrt((b - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2) = sqrt(b² + h²) = 130 m.\n\nWait, but hold on. If HC is 150 m, since it's a straight line from H to C, and C is directly south of O, that means the y-coordinate of C is -a, while H is at (0, h). So the vertical distance between H and C is h + a. So, HC ="

So that's sqrt( (b)^2 + (h)^2 ) = 130 m. So sqrt(b² + h²) = 130.\n\nAlso, the problem states that the distance between C and D is 140 m. Since C is at (0, -a) and D is at (b, 0), the distance CD is sqrt( (b - 0)^2 + (0 - (-a))^2 ) = sqrt(b² + a²) = 140 m. So that gives another equation: sqrt(b² + a²) = 140.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. h + a = 150 (from HC)\n2. sqrt(b² + h²) = 130 (from HD)\n3. sqrt(a² + b²) = 140 (from CD)\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for a, b, and h.\n\nFirst, let's square equation 3 to get a² + b² = 140² = 19600.\n\nEquation 2 squared is b² + h² = 130² = 16900.\n\nSo, from equations 2 and 3, we can subtract equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n(a² + b²) - (b² + h²) = 19600 - 16900\n\nThis simplifies to a² - h² = 2700.\n\nBut from equation 1, h = 150 - a. Let's substitute h into the above equation.\n\nSo, a² - (150 - a)^2 = 2700.\n\nExpanding (150 - a)^2: 150² - 2*150*a + a² = 22500 - 300a + a².\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\na² - (22500"

Then, from equation 1, h + 84 = 150 => h = 150 - 84 = 66 m.\n\nNow, using equation 3, sqrt(a² + b²) = 140, so with a = 84:\n\nsqrt(84² + b²) = 140\nsqrt(7056 + b²) = 140\nSquare both sides:\n\n7056 + b² = 140² = 19600\nb² = 19600 - 7056 = 12544\nb = sqrt(12544) = 112 m.\n\nSo, so far, we have:\n\na = 84 m (distance from O to C south),\nb = 112 m (distance from O to D east),\nh = 66 m (height of the balloon above O).\n\nSo, points:\n\n- O is at (0, 0),\n- A is at (0, 84),\n- B is at (-112, 0),\n- C is at (0, -84),\n- D is at (112, 0),\n- H is at (0, 66).\n\nSo, now, the current total length of ropes HC and HD is 150 m + 130 m = 280 m.\n\nWe need to replace these two ropes with a single rope HP, where P is a point on CD. So, P is somewhere along the line segment from C(0, -84) to D(112, 0).\n\nOur goal is to find the length of HP such that HP is the shortest possible, thus maximizing the length saved. Wait, but actually, the problem is about saving the maximum length. So, we want HP to be as long as possible, but not longer than the sum of HC and HD, because otherwise, the saving would be less.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if we can have HP as long as HC + HD"

            "output": ", that would mean the ropes are just extended in some way. But with P on CD, maybe HP is the minimal distance from H to CD. But since HP must be a single rope connecting H to P on CD, so the minimal rope length would be the minimal distance from H to CD, which is the perpendicular distance. Wait, but that would give a shorter rope length. But in our problem, actually, since we are replacing two ropes HC and HD with one rope HP, the total length of the ropes will be HP instead of HC + HD. So, to save the maximum length, we need HP to be as short as possible. Because then, the difference (HC + HD - HP) is the maximum. So, the maximum saving is when HP is minimized.\n\nBut wait, maybe not necessarily. The problem says \"to reduce the total length of rope used,\" so replacing two ropes with one, so if HP is shorter than HC + HD, which it must be because it's a single rope, the total rope used would decrease, thus saving (HC + HD - HP) length. So, to maximize the saving, we need to maximize (HC + HD - HP). Since HC + HD is fixed at 280 m, the saving is 280 - HP. So, to maximize the saving, we need to minimize HP.\n\nWait, yeah, that's right. So, the more we can reduce HP, the more we save. So, the minimal HP is the shortest distance from H to CD.\n\nBut wait, HP is a rope from H to P on CD. So, the minimal distance would be the perpendicular from H to CD. Therefore, the minimal HP is the perpendicular distance from H to CD.\n\nAlternatively, since P is on CD, which is a straight line. So, the minimal HP is the length of the perpendicular from H to CD. Therefore, the minimal rope length is the minimal distance from H to CD.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C and D are 140 m apart, and H is above O. So, let's compute the perpendicular distance from H to CD.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of line CD.\n\nPoints C and D are (0, -84) and (112, 0).

Wait, no, H is at (0, h) where h = 66, so coordinates (0, 66).\n\nWait, but the line CD is from (0, -84) to (112, 0). So, the equation is correct.\n\nNow, the distance from point H(0, 66) to the line CD can be found using the formula for distance from a point to a line.\n\nThe general formula is |Ax + By + C| / sqrt(A² + B²), where Ax + By + C = 0 is the line equation.\n\nFirst, let me write the equation of CD in standard form.\n\nStarting from y = (3/4)x - 84,\n\nSubtract y: (3/4)x - y - 84 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n\n3x - 4y - 336 = 0.\n\nSo, the standard form is 3x - 4y - 336 = 0.\n\nTherefore, A = 3, B = -4, C = -336.\n\nThe point H is (0, 66).

Because point P might not lie between C and D if the perpendicular falls outside the segment CD. Hmm, so we need to check if the perpendicular from H to CD actually intersects segment CD, not just the line CD extended.\n\nLet me check the coordinates of point P where the perpendicular from H meets CD.\n\nGiven that CD is from (0, -84) to (112, 0) and the perpendicular from H(0,66) is the line we found earlier, which had a slope of -4/3. Wait, no. Wait, the slope of CD is 3/4, so the slope of the perpendicular is -4/3.\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular from H is y - 66 = (-4/3)(x - 0), so y = (-4/3)x + 66.\n\nNow, let's find the intersection point P between CD and this perpendicular.\n\nCD: y = (3/4)x - 84.\n\nPerpendicular: y = (-4/3)x + 66.\n\nSet equal:\n\n(3/4)x - 84 = (-4/3)x + 66.\n\nMultiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:\n\n12*(3/4 x) - 12*84 = 12*(-4/3 x) + 12*66\n\nSimplify:\n\n9x - 1008 = -16x + 792\n\nBring variables to left, constants to right:\n\n9x + 16x = 792 + 1008\n\n25x = 1800\n\nx = 1800 / 25 = 72.\n\nSo, x = 72.\n\nNow, plug x = 72 into CD equation:\n\ny = (3/4)*72 - 84 = 54 - 84 = -30.\n\nThus, point P is at (72, -30).\n\nNow, we need to check if this point lies on segment CD.
