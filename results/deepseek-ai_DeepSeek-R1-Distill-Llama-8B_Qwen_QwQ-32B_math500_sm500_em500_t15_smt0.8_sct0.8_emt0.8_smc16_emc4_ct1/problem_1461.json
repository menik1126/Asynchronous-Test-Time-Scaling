The distance between C and D is 140 meters. There's a hot-air balloon at point H directly above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. The lengths given are HC = 150 meters and HD = 130 meters. \n\nThe problem says that to reduce the total length of rope used, we can replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. We need to find the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this.\n\nAlright, so first, let me visualize the setup. O is the origin, and H is directly above O at some height. The points A, B, C, D are positioned north, west, south, and east of O respectively. So, A is at (0, a), B is at (-b, 0), C is at (0, -c), and D is at (d, 0). But in the problem, it just says A is directly north, B west, etc., but it doesn't specify their distances from O. Hmm, wait, maybe I don't need their exact positions because the distance between C and D is given as 140 meters.\n\nWait, C is south of O, so if O is (0,0), then C is probably (0, -c). Similarly, D is east of O, so it's (d, 0). The distance between C and D would then be the straight line from (0, -c) to (d, 0). Using the distance formula, that would be sqrt(d² + c²) = 140 meters. Hmm, so that's one equation: d² + c² = 140². I might need that later.\n\nNow, the hot-air balloon is at H above O, so H has coordinates (0, h) where h is the height. The ropes are HA, HB, HC, HD, each connecting H to A, B, C, D respectively.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the lengths of HA, HB, but only HC = 150m and HD"

Wait, but if it's a flat field, the balloon is directly above O, so 3D coordinates could be (0,0, h). But for the purposes of calculating distance between H and the ground points, it's 3D distance.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem, all the points A,B,C,D are on the ground, and H is in the air above O, so the distance from H to each of the ground points would be a 3D distance. But since O is on the ground, H is (0, 0, h), so coordinates:\n\nH: (0, 0, h)\n\nA: (0, 0, a)? Wait, no, because the problem says A is directly north of O. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the coordinates.\n\nLet me think again. Let me model the flat field as the xy-plane, and H is at (0,0, h) in 3D space. Then:\n\n- Point O is (0,0,0)\n\n- Point A is directly north of O: Let's assume north is the positive y-direction, so A would be at (0, a, 0).\n\n- Point B is directly west of O, so that's the negative x-direction: (-b, 0, 0).\n\n- Point C is directly south of O: (0, -c, 0).\n\n- Point D is directly east of O: (d, 0, 0).\n\nThe distance between C and D is given as 140 m.

Now, sqrt(128) is sqrt(64*2) = 8√2. So, sqrt(12800) = 10*8√2=80√2.\n\nSo, c = 80√2 meters. Since c is the distance from O to C in the south direction, that would be the length. Similarly, since c² = 12800, and c² + h² =22500,\n\nSo h² = 22500 - 12800 = 9700, so h = sqrt(9700).\n\nSimplify sqrt(9700): 9700 = 100*97, so sqrt(9700) =10√97.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 3, d² + h² =16900, so d² =16900 -9700=7200.\n\nSo, d = sqrt(7200)=sqrt(7200)=sqrt(7200)=sqrt(72*100)=10*sqrt(72)=10*sqrt(36*2)=10*6*sqrt(2)=60√2.\n\nSo, now, we have d =60√2 and c=80√2.\n\nSo, points C is at (0, -80√2, 0), D is at (60√2, 0, 0).\n\nNow, the problem is that currently, there are two ropes, HC and HD, of lengths 150 m and 130 m respectively.
