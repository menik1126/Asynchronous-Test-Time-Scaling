The problem provides an Asymptote figure which I can't see directly, but based on the code, I can try to visualize it.\n\nFrom the Asymptote code, it looks like the line is drawn on a coordinate plane with points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3). There's also a red line drawn between points L and R, which are the intersections of the line AB with the vertical lines \\( x=-8 \\) and \\( x=8 \\) at some \\( y \\)-values.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the coordinates of points A and B. Point A is at (-5,4) and point B is at (-1,3). So, the line AB connects these two points. The direction vector of this line AB can be found by subtracting the coordinates of point A from point B.\n\nCalculating the change in x and y:\n\nChange in x: \\( (-1) - (-5) = -1 + 5 = 4 \\)\n\nChange in y: \\( 3 - 4 = -1 \\)\n\nSo, the direction vector from A to B is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). But the problem states that the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, these don't seem to match at first glance. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the direction vector.\n\nIn the Asymptote code, the line is plotted with points L and R, which are the intersections of line AB with the vertical lines at \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\). The red line from L to R is the line AB itself. However, the direction vector mentioned might be the slope vector of the line, not necessarily between points A and B.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. It says the direction vector of the line is of the form \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, if the line has a slope equal to \\( b/(-7) \\), then I need to find the slope of line AB and set it equal to \\( b/"

            "output": "(-7) \\), then solve for \\( b \\).\n\nTherefore, first, compute the slope between points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3). The slope \\( m \\) is:\n\n\\( m = \\frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} = \\frac{-1}{4} \\)\n\nSo the slope is \\( -1/4 \\). But the direction vector given is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), so the slope would be \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\). Setting these equal:\n\n\\( \\frac{b}{-7} = \\frac{-1}{4} \\)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\( -4b = -7 \\times (-1) \\)\nWait, actually cross-multiplying would give \\( b \\times 4 = (-7) \\times (-1) \\), or maybe I should solve for \\( b \\):\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\( \\frac{b}{-7} = \\frac{-1}{4} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -7:\n\n\\( b = \\frac{-1}{4} \\times (-7) \\)\n\n\\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\)\n\nHmm, so is that correct? Let's check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the direction vector. A direction vector for the line AB can be given by any scalar multiple of the vector from A to B. The vector AB is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, direction vectors are scalar multiples of this. The problem wants a direction vector of the form \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, we need to find \\( b \\) such that \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nLet’s denote the scalar as \\( k \\). Then,\n\n\\( -7 = 4k \\)\n\nand\n\n\\( b = -1 \\times k \\)\n\nSo, solving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\( k = -7 / 4 \\)\n\nThen plugging into the second equation:\n\n\\( b = -1 \\times (-7/4) = 7/4"

            "output": " \\)\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach it: The line AB has a direction vector from A to B as \\( \\langle 4, -1 \\rangle \\). The line's slope is rise over run, which is -1/4. The direction vector given is \\( \\langle -7, b \\rangle \\), so the slope is \\( b/-7 \\). Setting them equal:\n\n\\( b/-7 = -1/4 \\)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\( b = (-7) \\times (-1/4) \\) => \\( b = 7/4 \\)\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, just to recap, by finding the slope between A and B, recognizing that the direction vector must have the same slope, setting up the equation, and solving, I find that \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( b \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( b \\) in the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) for the given line, we start by calculating the direction vector of the line segment connecting points \\( A(-5, 4) \\) and \\( B(-1, 3) \\).\n\n1. Calculate the change in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) between points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n   - Change in \\( x \\): \\( (-1) - (-5) = 4 \\)\n   - Change in \\( y \\): \\( 3 - 4 = -1 \\)\n\n2. The direction vector from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\n3. The slope of the line \\( AB \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{slope} = \\frac{-1}{4}\n   \\]\n\n4. The direction vector given in the problem is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). The slope of this direction vector is \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\).\n\n5. Setting the slopes equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b}{-7} = \\frac{-1}{4}\n  "
