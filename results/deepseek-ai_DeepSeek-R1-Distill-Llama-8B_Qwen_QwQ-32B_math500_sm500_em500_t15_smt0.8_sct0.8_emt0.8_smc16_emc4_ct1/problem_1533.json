The sums given are:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i = 96,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2 = 144,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^3 = 216.\n\\]\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with sums of powers, sometimes we can use inequalities or identities that relate these sums. Maybe something with Cauchy-Schwarz or Hölder's inequality? Or perhaps there's a way to use the Cauchy-Schwarz on the sums of squares and cubes.\n\nWait, another thought: if all the \\( a_i \\)s are equal, then each \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\). Let me compute the sums in that case and see if they match the given values.\n\nIf \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\sum a_i^2 = n \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9216}{n},\n\\]\nand\n\n\\[\n\\sum a_i^3 = n \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^3 = \\frac{884736}{n^2}.\n\\]\n\nWe are given that \\( \\sum a_i^2 = 144 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9216}{n} = 144 \\implies n = \\frac{9216}{144} = 64.\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, checking for the sum of cubes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{884736}{n^2} = 216 \\implies n^2 = \\frac{884736}{216} = 4096 \\implies n = 64.\n\\]\n\nWait, that works out nicely. So if all \\( a_i \\) are equal, then \\( n = 64 \\). But the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\)\", implying there might be more than one solution.

The sums of the first, second, and third powers seem to uniquely determine \\( n \\) when all terms are equal. Is that always the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to consider that these sums could only be possible if the sequence is constant, i.e., all \\( a_i \\) are equal.

That doesn't give any new information.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to apply Hölder's inequality. Hölder's inequality states that for positive real numbers \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that \\( 1/p + 1/q = 1 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\sum |f_i g_i| \\leq \\left( \\sum |f_i|^p \\right)^{1/p} \\left( \\sum |g_i|^q \\right)^{1/q}\n\\]\nBut I'm not sure how to apply this here directly.\n\nAlternatively, the Power Mean inequality says that for positive real numbers,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i^3} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i^2} \\geq \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i\n\\]\n\nLet me compute these means.\n\nFirst, the cube root of the average of cubes:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{216}{n}} \\approx 6.0\n\\]\nBecause \\( 6^3 = 216 \\), so if \\( n=1 \\), but here it's \\( 216/n \\), so for \\( n=64 \\), it's \\( 216/64 \\approx 3.375 \\), cube root is about 1.5.
