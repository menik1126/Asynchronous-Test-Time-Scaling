Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should write down what I know:\n\n1. log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2\n2. log_y(5x) = 2\n\nAlright, let's tackle the first equation. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them using the product rule. So, log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(a * c). Applying that here, the first equation becomes:\n\nlog₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\nWait, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, right? So that simplifies to x² - y². So now the equation is:\n\nlog₆(x² - y²) = 2\n\nI also remember that if log_b(z) = k, then z = b^k. So, applying that here, we get:\n\nx² - y² = 6²\nx² - y² = 36\n\nOkay, so that's one equation relating x and y.\n\nNow, let's look at the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Again, using the definition of logarithms, if log_y(z) = k, then z = y^k. So here, 5x = y².\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. x² - y² = 36\n2. 5x = y²\n\nHmm, equation 2 gives me y² = 5x. Maybe I can substitute this into equation 1.\n\nSo substituting y² from equation 2 into equation 1:\n\nx² - (5x) = 36\n\nThat's x² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see:\n\nThe factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18,"

            "output": " 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nLooking for a pair that subtracts to 5 (since the sum is -5 and the product is -36). Let me try 6 and -6: 6 * (-6) = -36, and 6 + (-6) = 0. Not the right sum. Next, 9 and -4: 9 * (-4) = -36, and 9 + (-4) = 5. Wait, but I need a sum of -5, so maybe -9 and 4. That would give -9 * 4 = -36 and -9 + 4 = -5. Perfect!\n\nSo the quadratic factors as:\n\n(x - 9)(x + 4) = 0\n\nSo the solutions are x = 9 or x = -4.\n\nBut wait, let's think about whether x can be negative. Looking back at the original logarithmic equations, the arguments of the logs must be positive. So for log₆(x - y) and log₆(x + y) to be defined, both (x - y) and (x + y) must be greater than 0. Similarly, for log_y(5x) to be defined, y must be positive and not equal to 1, and 5x must be positive.\n\nSo let's check x = 9 first.\n\nFrom equation 2: 5x = y². If x = 9, then y² = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But since y must be positive (because it's the base of a logarithm and must be positive and not 1), y = 3√5.\n\nNow check if (x - y) and (x + y) are positive. x=9, y≈6.708.\n\nSo 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292 > 0, and 9 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708 > 0. So both are positive, so x=9 is valid.\n\nNow check x = -4.\n\nFrom equation 2: 5*(-4) = y², so y² = -20. But y² can't be negative since y is a real number. So y² = -20 is impossible. Thus, x = -4 is not"
