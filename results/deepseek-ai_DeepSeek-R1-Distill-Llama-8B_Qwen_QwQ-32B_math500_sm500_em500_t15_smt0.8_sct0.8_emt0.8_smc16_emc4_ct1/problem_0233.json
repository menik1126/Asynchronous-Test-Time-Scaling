He walks 1/2 mile south initially and then another 1/2 mile south, totaling 1 mile south.\n\nNext, I'll calculate his eastward displacement, which is 3/4 mile east.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. The displacement south is 1 mile, and the displacement east is 3/4 mile.\n\nUsing the formula, 1 squared plus (3/4) squared equals the square of the straight-line distance. Solving this gives the distance as approximately 1.22 miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down Bill's movements and calculate his straight-line distance from the starting point step by step.\n\n1. **Displacements:**\n   - **South:** Bill walks a total of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile + \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile = **1** mile south.\n   - **East:** Bill walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n\n2. **Visualizing the Path:**\n   - Bill's path forms a right-angled triangle with:\n     - One side as 1 mile (south).\n     - The other side as \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile (east).\n\n3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Straight-line distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{South displacement})^2 + (\\text{East displacement})^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Straight-line distance} = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 0.5625} = \\sqrt{1.5625} \\approx 1.22 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.22}\n\\]"
