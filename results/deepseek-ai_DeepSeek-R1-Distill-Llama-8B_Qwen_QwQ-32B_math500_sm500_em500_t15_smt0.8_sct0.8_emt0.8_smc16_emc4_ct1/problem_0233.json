That adds up to a total of one mile south.\n\nNext, I'll find out how far he walks east. He moves three-fourths of a mile east.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. The eastward distance will be one leg of the right triangle, and the southward distance will be the other leg.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the hypotenuse to find the straight-line distance, which will be the answer to the problem.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Understanding the Directions:**\n1. **Southward Movement:**\n   - Bill walks **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)** mile south.\n   - Then, he walks an additional **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)** mile south.\n   - **Total Southward Distance:** \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\) mile.\n\n2. **Eastward Movement:**\n   - Bill walks **\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)** mile east.\n\n**Calculating the Straight-Line Distance:**\nTo find the straight-line distance from Bill's starting point, we can visualize his path as the legs of a right triangle:\n- **Eastward Distance:** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile.\n- **Southward Distance:** \\( 1 \\) mile.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Eastward Distance})^2 + (\\text{Southward Distance})^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + (1)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.25}\n\\]"
