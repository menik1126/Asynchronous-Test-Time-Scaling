            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nAnd this has to hold true for all real values of x except x = -8 and x = 3 because those would make the denominators zero, which is undefined. \n\nAlright, so my goal is to find C and D such that when I combine the left side, it equals the right side. Then, once I have C and D, I can just multiply them to get CD. \n\nFirst, I think I should combine the fractions on the left side so that I can compare them to the right side. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (x - 3) and (x + 8), so the common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). \n\nSo, I'll rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait, I notice that the denominator on the right side is x\u00b2 + 5x - 24. Maybe I can factor that to check if it's related to the common denominator. Let me try factoring it:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3: 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So yes, it's (x + 8)(x - 3). That's the same as the common denominator on the left. Cool, so the denominators are equal, which is good because that means the numerators must be equal as well for the equation to hold for all x (except the excluded values).\n\nSo, combining the fractions on the left:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8"

Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables, C and D. I can solve this system to find C and D.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI can solve Equation 1 for one variable in terms of the other. Let me solve for D:\n\nD = 4 - C\n\nThen, substitute D into Equation 2:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8C + 3C) - 12 = -23\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, substitute C back into Equation 1 to find D:\n\n-1 + D = 4\n\nSo, D = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nTherefore, C is -1 and D is 5. \n\nThe question asks for the product CD:\n\nCD = (-1)(5) = -5\n\nWait, let me double-check my work. Sometimes signs can be tricky.\n\nSo, plugging C = -1 and D = 5 into the original left side:\n\nLeft side: (-1)/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8)\n\nCombine them:\n\n[ -1(x + 8) + 5(x - 3) ] / (x - 3)(x + 8"
