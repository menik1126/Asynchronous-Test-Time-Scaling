            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the magnitude of a complex number w, given that z is 1 + i. Hmm, let's see. The problem says z = 1 + i and w is equal to (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). I remember that the magnitude of a complex number is the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts. So, if I can express w in the form a + bi, then |w| would just be sqrt(a^2 + b^2).\n\nAlright, let's start by plugging z into the expression for w. So w = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). Since z is 1 + i, let's compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nFirst, the numerator: 3z + 1. Let's compute 3 times z, which is 3*(1 + i). That would be 3*1 + 3*i, which is 3 + 3i. Then, adding 1 to that gives 3 + 3i + 1, which simplifies to 4 + 3i. So the numerator is 4 + 3i.\n\nNow, the denominator: 5z + 7. Let's compute 5*z, which is 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i. Adding 7 to that gives 5 + 5i + 7, which is 12 + 5i. So the denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nSo now, w is (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). I need to simplify this complex fraction. I remember that to divide complex numbers, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i. So, I'll multiply both the top and bottom by 12 - 5i.\n\nLet me write that out: w = [(4 + 3i)*(12 - 5i)] / [(12 + 5i)*(12 - 5i)].\n\nNow, let's compute the numerator first. Multiply (4 + 3i) by (12 - 5i). Using the distributive property, I'll do each term step by step.\n\n4*12 = 48\n"

            "output": "4*(-5i) = -20i\n3i*12 = 36i\n3i*(-5i) = -15i^2\n\nSo, adding these up: 48 - 20i + 36i -15i^2.\n\nCombine like terms: The real parts are 48 and -15i^2. Wait, but i^2 is -1, so -15i^2 is -15*(-1) = 15. So, 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nThe imaginary parts: -20i + 36i = 16i.\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to 63 + 16i.\n\nNow, the denominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i). I remember that this is a difference of squares, so it's 12^2 - (5i)^2. 12 squared is 144, and (5i)^2 is 25i^2, which is 25*(-1) = -25. So the denominator becomes 144 - (-25) = 144 + 25 = 169.\n\nSo now, w is (63 + 16i)/169. This can be written as 63/169 + (16/169)i.\n\nNow, to find |w|, I compute the magnitude of this complex number. The magnitude is sqrt((63/169)^2 + (16/169)^2).\n\nLet me compute each part: (63/169)^2 and (16/169)^2.\n\n63 squared is 3969, and 169 squared is 28561. So 3969/28561.\n\nSimilarly, 16 squared is 256, so 256/28561.\n\nAdding these gives (3969 + 256)/28561.\n\n3969 + 256 = 4225. So, the sum is 4225/28561.\n\nTherefore, |w| is sqrt(4225/28561).\n\nNow, sqrt(4225) is 65, because 65^2 is 4225. And sqrt(28561) is 169, since 169^2 is 28561.\n\nSo, sqrt(4225/28561) = 65/169.\n\nWait, but 65 and 169 have a common factor. Let's check, 65 divides into 13*5, and 169 is 13^2. So, 65"

Let me double-check:\n\n4225 ÷ 169: 169 times 25 is 4225 because 169*25 = (170 -1)*25 = 170*25 -25 = 4250 -25 = 4225. So yes, 4225/169 is 25, so sqrt(4225/169) is 5. Then sqrt(169) is 13, so sqrt(4225/28561) = sqrt(25/169) = 5/13.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check:\n\nEarlier, I had sqrt(4225/28561) = sqrt(4225)/sqrt(28561) = 65/169. Then, reducing that, 65 ÷13=5, 169 ÷13=13, so 5/13.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, |w| is 5/13.\n\nWait, let me confirm this another way. Alternatively, maybe I could compute |w| without converting to rectangular form. Since |w| = |(3z + 1)/(5z +7)|, which is |3z +1| / |5z +7|.\n\nSo perhaps I can compute |3z +1| and |5z +7| and then take their ratio.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nGiven z = 1 + i, compute |3z +1|.\n\nFirst, compute 3z: 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i. Then add 1: 3 + 3i +1 = 4 +3i. Then |4 +3i| is sqrt(4^2 +3^2) = sqrt(16 +9) = sqrt(25)=5.\n\nNext, compute |5z +7|. 5z is 5*(1 + i) =5 +5i. Add 7:5 +5i +7 =12 +5i. The magnitude is sqrt(12^2 +5^2)=sqrt(144 +25)=sqrt(169)=13.\n\nTherefore, |w| is |3z +1| / |"

Express w in terms of z.\n2. Substitute z =1 + i.\n3. Compute numerator and denominator separately.\n4. For the numerator, compute |3z +1| which is 5.\n5. For the denominator, compute |5z +7| which is 13.\n6. Therefore, |w| = 5/13.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of that shortcut, I could have converted w to the a + bi form and then computed the magnitude, but this way is quicker.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here, so the magnitude should be 5/13.\n</think>\n\nNow, let's provide the step-by-step explanation and answer.\n\nTo find the magnitude of \\( w \\), we can use the property that the magnitude of a quotient of complex numbers is the quotient of their magnitudes.
