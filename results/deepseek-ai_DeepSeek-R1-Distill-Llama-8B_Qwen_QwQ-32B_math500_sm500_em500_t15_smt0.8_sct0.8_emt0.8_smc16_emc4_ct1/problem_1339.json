Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the left side consists of four fractions, each with a linear numerator and a quadratic denominator. The right side is a linear equation in x. So, the equation is a rational equation equal to a linear term. My goal is to find the sum of all complex solutions x to this equation.\n\nThe question asks for the sum of all complex solutions. That makes me think about Vieta's formulas, which relate the sum and product of roots of a polynomial equation to its coefficients. But to apply Vieta, I need the equation in polynomial form. So, my first step should be to eliminate the denominators by multiplying both sides by the product of all denominators. That should turn the equation into a polynomial equation, which I can then solve or analyze for its roots.\n\nLet me denote the left-hand side as LHS and the right-hand side as RHS.\n\nSo,\n\nLHS = \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4}\\)\n\nand\n\nRHS = \\(2010x - 4\\)\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, I need to find a common denominator. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). The common denominator would be their product, which is:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 -"

            "output": " 3)(x^2 - 4).\n\\]\n\nBut before multiplying everything out, maybe I can rearrange the equation to set it equal to zero.\n\nLet me subtract RHS from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow, to eliminate the denominators, multiply every term by the common denominator. So:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 \\cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\right) + \\left(2 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\right) + \\left(3 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4)\\right) + \\left(4 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)\\right) - 2010x \\cdot \\left((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\right) + 4 \\cdot \\left((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\right) = 0.\n\\]\n\nWow, that seems really complicated. Multiplying all these terms out would result in a very high-degree polynomial. The denominators are quartic (degree 4), so when multiplied out, each term will become degree 4 * 4 = 8? Wait, no, because each fraction is multiplied by a quartic term, so the resulting terms are degree 8? Let me think.\n\nWait, the denominators are quartic, so when we multiply each fraction by the common denominator, each term becomes a quartic times a linear or constant term, resulting in degree 8. So, the resulting polynomial after multiplying through would be degree 8. But also, the RHS had a term with 2010x multiplied by the quartic, which is degree 5 (since 2010x is degree "

Then, the last term is 4 times the quartic, which is degree 4.\n\nSo, the entire equation after multiplying by the common denominator will result in a degree 8 polynomial. Hmm, that's a huge equation to solve. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider a substitution to simplify the equation. Let me let y = x^2. Then, each denominator becomes y - k, where k is 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nBut wait, the LHS would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}\n\\]\n\nand the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nBut now, x is still present on the RHS. Since y = x^2, we have x = sqrt(y) or x = -sqrt(y). So, perhaps we can write x in terms of y, but I don't see an immediate way to make this substitution helpful. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function f(x) = LHS - RHS and analyze its behavior? But that seems vague.\n\nWait, another thought: the sum of all complex solutions to a polynomial equation is given by -b/a, where the polynomial is expressed as a monic polynomial of the form ax^n + bx^{n-1} + ... + k. So, if I can write the equation as a polynomial, say P(x) = 0, then the sum of the roots is -b/a.\n\nBut given that when I multiply through by the common denominator, the resulting polynomial will have leading term of degree 8, but wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, when I multiply each term on the LHS and RHS by the common denominator, which is degree 8, each term on the LHS becomes degree 8 (because x^2 - k is degree 2, so 1/(y - 1) multiplied by y - 1)(...), that would be "

Wait, no, each denominator is degree 2, so the product of three denominators would be degree 6, so when multiplied by the numerator (which is a constant), the term is degree 6. Wait, but the denominators are four terms, so the common denominator is (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4), which is degree 8. So, when I multiply each fraction by the common denominator, each term would be (numerator) * (common denominator)/(denominator). So, for example, the first term is 1/(x^2 -1) multiplied by the common denominator gives (x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). So that term is degree 6. Similarly, each of the four terms on the LHS when multiplied by the common denominator gives a degree 6 term. The RHS terms, when multiplied by the common denominator, would be (2010x -4) multiplied by the common denominator (degree 8), so that term is degree 9 (since 2010x is degree 1, times degree 8 gives degree 9). Wait, so actually, the entire equation after multiplying through would be:\n\nSum of four terms (each degree 6) minus (2010x -4) times the common denominator (degree 9) equals zero. Wait, so the highest degree term would be from the RHS term, which is degree 9. Therefore, the resulting equation is a 9th-degree polynomial. Therefore, the equation is of degree 9, so the sum of all roots would be the negative of the coefficient of x^8 divided by the coefficient of x^9.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can compute the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in the polynomial equation, then use Vieta's formula to get the sum of roots.\n\nBut this seems tedious, but perhaps manageable if I can find the leading coefficients without expanding everything.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let me denote the common denominator as D(x) = (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x"

But we are to find the sum of all complex solutions.\n\nSo, the sum would be the sum of roots of the 8th-degree polynomial plus x=0. So, if I can find the sum of roots of the 8th-degree polynomial, then add 0, which doesn't change the sum.\n\nSo, the total sum is the sum of roots of the 8th-degree equation. To find that, we can use Vieta's formula, which says that the sum of roots of a monic polynomial is equal to negative the coefficient of x^{7} divided by the coefficient of x^8.\n\nBut in our case, the 8th-degree polynomial is not monic. It is:\n\n-2010x^8 +4x^7 +20100x^6 -30x^5 -70350x^4 +70x^3 +100500x^2 -83x -48240=0\n\nSo, the leading coefficient is -2010, and the coefficient of x^7 is +4.\n\nWait, in Vieta's formula, the sum of roots is -b/a, where b is the coefficient of x^{n-1} and a is the coefficient of x^n. So, for the 8th-degree polynomial, the coefficient of x^8 is -2010, and the coefficient of x^7 is +4.\n\nTherefore, the sum of roots is -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nSimplify that, 2 and 1005. Let's see if they can be reduced. 1005 divided by 5 is 201, divided by 3 is 67, so 1005=5*201=5*3*67. 2 doesn't divide into 1005, so it's 2/1005.\n\nBut wait, the equation is not monic, so the polynomial is in the form:\n\na8x^8 + a7x^7 + ... + a0=0\n\nHence, the sum is -a7/a8.\n\nIn our case, a8=-2010, a7=4.\n\nSo, sum = -a7/a8 = -4/(-2010)=4/2010=2/1005.\n\nSo, the sum of roots of the 8th"

Wait, the problem says \"the sum of all complex solutions\". But in our equation, we've already considered that x=0 is one solution, and the other roots come from the 8th-degree polynomial.\n\nBut is 0 considered a complex solution? Well, in the realm of complex numbers, 0 is a complex number (since it's 0 +0i). So, yes, it is included. So, the total sum is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me make sure that all the other roots are accounted for. The other roots are roots of the 8th-degree polynomial, which has 8 roots. So, total solutions are x=0, plus 8 roots, making 9 solutions. But in the original rational equation, we have denominators x^2 -1, etc., so we must ensure that x^2 - k ≠0, which would mean x≠±1, x≠±sqrt{2}, x≠±sqrt{3}, x≠±2. But since the original equation is a rational equation, we have to exclude those x where any denominator is zero. So, x=±1, x=±sqrt{2}, x=±sqrt{3}, x=±2.

So, x=0 is not a root of the 8th-degree equation, so it's a separate root.\n\nTherefore, the roots of the 8th-degree equation do not include the excluded values (since they are not roots of the polynomial), so all roots of the 8th-degree equation are valid solutions except those excluded x's. Wait, but actually, when we multiplied both sides by D(x), we might have introduced extraneous roots where D(x)=0, but since D(x)=0 corresponds to x^2=1,2,3,4, so x=±1, etc. But since we already checked that x=1 is not a root of the 8th-degree equation, so those points are not solutions. Therefore, all roots of the 8th-degree equation are valid, except perhaps if any of them coincide with the excluded x's, but since they are not roots, they are okay.\n\nTherefore, the total solutions are x=0 and the 8 roots of the 8th-degree equation, so total 9 roots, and their sum is 2/1005 +0=2/1005.\n\nWait, but hold on.
