Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the left side of the equation has four fractions, each with a linear coefficient in the numerator (1, 2, 3, 4) and a quadratic denominator of the form \\(x^2 - k\\), where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let me consider each fraction separately.\n\nFor the first term, \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1}\\), I remember that this can be expressed using partial fractions. The denominator factors as \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\), so I can write:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} = \\frac{A}{x - 1} + \\frac{B}{x + 1}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\):\n\n\\[\n1 = A(x + 1) + B(x - 1).\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), I can substitute suitable values for \\(x\\):\n\nLet \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\(1 = A(2) + B(0) \\Rightarrow A = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nLet \\(x = -1\\):\n\n\\(1 = A(0) + B(-2) \\Rightarrow B = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{"

So, perhaps if I can write the equation as:\n\nSum over terms of \\(1/(x - a)\\) equals a linear function of \\(x\\).\n\nBut I don't see an immediate way to combine these. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire left side as a function \\(f(x)\\) and set it equal to \\(2010x - 4\\), so \\(f(x) = 2010x - 4\\). Then, the equation becomes \\(f(x) - (2010x - 4) = 0\\). So, the roots of \\(f(x) - (2010x - 4)\\) will be the solutions.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a substitution for \\(x\\). Since the denominators are \\(x^2 - k\\), perhaps substituting \\(y = x^2\\), so:\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^4 \\frac{k}{y - k} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but then \\(y = x^2\\), which may complicate things because \\(y\\) is related to \\(x\\) in a non-linear way. Maybe that substitution isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider each term as a function and think about the equation as a sum of these functions. Each term is a simple rational function, and the sum is equal to another rational function.\n\nBut, I think maybe another approach would be better.\n\nWait,"

In polynomial equations, the sum of roots can be found using Vieta's formula, but this equation isn't a polynomial equation yet. However, perhaps if we can manipulate it into a polynomial equation, then Vieta's formula can be applied.\n\nSo, let's try to clear denominators. To do that, we can multiply both sides by the product of all denominators. The denominators on the left are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). So, the common denominator would be \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\).

Let me denote the left side minus the right side as \\(P(x)\\). Then, \\(P(x) = 0\\) is the equation we need to solve, and the solutions are the roots of \\(P(x)\\).

So, \\(D(x)\\) is a product of four quadratic terms, which would make it an 8th degree polynomial. Multiplying both sides by \\(D(x)\\) should result in a polynomial of degree 8 on the right side, and the left side would be a degree 6 polynomial, but when subtracting the right side, the highest degree term would be from the right side, so the overall polynomial \\(P(x)\\) would be of degree 8.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then \\(P(x)\\) is a degree 8 polynomial. So, the sum of the roots (solutions) would be equal to minus the coefficient of \\(x^7\\) divided by the coefficient of \\(x^8\\), by Vieta's formula.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I can compute the coefficients of \\(x^8\\) and \\(x^7\\) in \\(P(x)\\). Since \\(P(x)\\) is constructed as Left Side minus Right Side, where Left Side is a sum of products of lower-degree terms, and Right Side is a degree 8 term, the coefficients of \\(P(x)\\) can be determined by subtracting the coefficients of Right Side from Left Side.\n\nSo, let's think about it.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLeft Side: L = 1*(x\u00b2-2)(x\u00b2-3)(x\u00b2-4) + 2*(x\u00b2-1)(x\u00b2-3)(x\u00b2-4) + 3*(x\u00b2-1)(x\u00b2-2)(x\u00b2-4) + 4*(x\u00b2-1)(x\u00b2-2)(x\u00b2-3)\n\nRight Side: R = (2010x -4)*(x\u00b2 -1)(x\u00b2 -2)(x\u00b2 -3)(x\u00b2 -4)\n\nSo, P(x) = L - R = 0\n\nTherefore, P(x) is a polynomial where L is of degree 6 and R is of degree 8, so P(x) is of degree 8.\n\nThe leading term in L would be each of the terms in L.

Wait, but L is degree 6, so when subtracted from R (degree 9), the result is degree 9. Hmm, so my previous thought was wrong. So actually, the equation is a 9th degree polynomial?\n\nWait, that complicates things. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the left side L is the sum of four terms, each of which is a constant multiplied by a product of three quadratic terms. Each quadratic term is degree 2, so three of them multiplied is degree 6. So each term in L is degree 6, so L is a degree 6 polynomial.
