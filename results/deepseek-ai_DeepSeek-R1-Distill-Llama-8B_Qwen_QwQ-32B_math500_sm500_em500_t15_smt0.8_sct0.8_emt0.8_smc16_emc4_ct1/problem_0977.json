But I need to figure out what he should have gotten if he didn't make that mistake.\n\nFirst, I remember that dividing complex numbers involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to simplify the expression. The conjugate of (1 + 2i) is (1 - 2i), right? So, I'll try that.\n\nLet me write down what he should have done. The original expression is (-3 + 4i)/(1 + 2i). To simplify, multiply both the numerator and denominator by (1 - 2i). \n\nSo, numerator becomes (-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i). I'll use the distributive property to expand this. \n\nFirst, multiply -3 by 1, which is -3. Then, -3 multiplied by -2i is +6i. Next, 4i times 1 is 4i, and 4i times -2i is -8i². \n\nNow, combining like terms: -3 + 6i + 4i -8i². Wait, i² is -1, so -8i² becomes +8. Combining real parts: -3 + 8 is 5. The imaginary parts: 6i + 4i is 10i. So the numerator simplifies to 5 + 10i.\n\nNow, the denominator is (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i). Multiplying these, 1*1 is 1, 1*(-2i) is -2i, 2i*1 is 2i, and 2i*(-2i) is -4i². Again, i² is -1, so -4i² is +4. Combining these, 1 + 4 is 5, and -2i + 2i cancels out. So the denominator is 5.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to (5 + 10i)/5. Dividing each term by 5 gives 1 + 2i. \n\nWait, but let me"

Let's re-examine the numerator:\n\n(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = -3*1 + (-3)*(-2i) + 4i*1 + 4i*(-2i)\n\n= -3 + 6i + 4i -8i²\n\n= -3 + 10i + 8 (since i² is -1)\n\n= 5 + 10i. Yep, that's correct.\n\nDenominator: (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (-4) = 5. Correct.\n\nSo, dividing numerator by denominator: (5 + 10i)/5 = 1 + 2i.\n\nTherefore, William's correct answer should have been 1 + 2i.\n</think>\n\nTo find the correct result of the division \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\), we use the method of multiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.\n\n1. **Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (1 - 2i):**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand the numerator:**\n\n   \\[\n   (-3)(1) + (-3)(-2i) + 4i(1) + 4i(-2i) = -3 + 6i + 4i -8i^2\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying \\(i^2 = -1\\):\n\n   \\[\n   -3 + 10i + 8 = 5 + 10i\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expand the denominator:**\n\n   \\[\n   (1)(1) + (1)(-2i) + (2i)(1) + (2i)(-2i) = 1 - 2i + 2i -4i^2\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying \\(i^2 = -1\\):\n\n   \\[\n   1 + 4 = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide numerator by denominator:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5 + 10i}{5} = 1"
