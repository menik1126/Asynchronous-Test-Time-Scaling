The company's new policy involves assigning or unassigning new dogs in groups of \\( x \\) dogs. The key is that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same in two different scenarios.\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, while Nate continues to walk 12 dogs. In the second scenario, \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, so Denali walks \\( 16 + x \\) dogs, and Nate walks \\( 12 - x \\) dogs.\n\nI'll set up the ratio of their pays based on the number of dogs they walk. Let’s denote Denali's pay as \\( P_D \\) and Nate's pay as \\( P_N \\). Initially, the ratio \\( \\frac{P_D}{P_N} \\) is \\( \\frac{16}{12} \\).\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali's new number of dogs is \\( 16 + 4x \\), and Nate's remains at 12. The ratio of their pays should still be \\( \\frac{16}{12} \\). Therefore, I can write the equation \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16}{12} \\).\n\nSolving this equation will give me the value of \\( x \\).\n\nIn the second scenario, after reassignment, Denali walks \\( 16 + x \\) dogs, and Nate walks \\( 12 - x \\) dogs. Again, the ratio \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\) should equal \\( \\frac{16}{12} \\). This gives me another equation to solve for \\( x \\).\n\nSince both scenarios must hold true, I can solve either equation to find the value of \\( x \\). However, I notice that both equations would lead to the same solution, so solving one will suffice.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks \\(16\\) dogs.\n- Nate walks \\(12\\) dogs.\n- The company assigns or unassigns dogs in groups of \\(x\\).\n\n**Under the New Policy:**\n1. **If Denali walks \\(4x\\) more dogs, and Nate walks \\(12\\) dogs:**\n   - Denali"

This suggests an error in interpretation.\n\n**Re-examining the Problem:**\nThe ratio must be the *same* in both scenarios, not necessarily equal to the original ratio. Let’s denote the common ratio as \\(k\\).\n\n**First Scenario:**\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = k\n\\]\n\n**Second Scenario:**\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = k\n\\]\n\nSet the two expressions equal to each other:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\n**Cross-Multiplying:**\n\\[\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpand both sides:\n\\[\n16 \\cdot 12 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x\n\\]\n\\[\n192 + 32x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x\n\\"
