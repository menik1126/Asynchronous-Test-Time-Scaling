If \\(2^{24}\\) is a perfect nth power, there must be some positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(2^{24} = k^n\\).\n\nTo find the possible values of \\(n\\), I should express \\(2^{24}\\) in its prime factorization form. Since 2 is a prime number, \\(2^{24}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\nNext, I know that for \\(2^{24}\\) to be a perfect nth power, the exponent in its prime factorization must be divisible by \\(n\\). This means that \\(24\\) must be divisible by \\(n\\), or mathematically, \\(n\\) must be a divisor of \\(24\\).\n\nI'll list all the positive divisors of \\(24\\): \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\\). However, the problem specifies that \\(n > 1\\), so I'll exclude \\(1\\).\n\nTherefore, the possible values of \\(n\\) are \\(2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\\).\n\nFinally, I'll count the number of these values to determine how many positive integers \\(n > 1\\) satisfy the condition. There are \\(7\\) such values.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) it is true that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, let's follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding Perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) Powers**\nA number \\( m \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( m = k^n \\). Here, \\( m = 2^{24} \\), so we need to find all \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\).\n\n**Step 2: Expressing \\( 2^{24} \\) in Terms of \\( n \\)**\nTo satisfy \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\), \\( k \\) must be a power of 2. Let \\( k = 2^m \\). Substit"
