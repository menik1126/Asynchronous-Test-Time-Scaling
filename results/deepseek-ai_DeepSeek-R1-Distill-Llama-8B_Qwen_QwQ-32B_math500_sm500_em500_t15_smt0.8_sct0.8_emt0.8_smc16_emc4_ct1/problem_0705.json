            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has. Hmm, y-intercepts. Let me think about what that means. \n\nI remember that a y-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the y-axis. And on the y-axis, the value of x is always 0 because it's where the graph meets the vertical axis. So, to find the y-intercepts, I should set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nAlright, let me write down the equation again: \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\). If I set \\( x = 0 \\), the equation becomes:\n\\[ 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\]\nSo, I need to solve this quadratic equation for \\( y \\).\n\nQuadratic equations are of the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\). Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\). I can use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( y \\). The quadratic formula is:\n\\[ y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\\[ y = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} \\]\nSimplifying the numerator:\n- The first term is \\( -(-4) = 4 \\).\n- The discriminant inside the square root is \\( (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) \\).\nLet me compute the discriminant:\n\\[ (-4)^2 = 16 \\]\n\\[ 4(1)(-1) = -4 \\]\nWait, but in the discriminant, it's \\( b^2 - 4ac \\), so plugging in the values:\n\\[ 16 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\]\nOkay, so the square root of 20. Hmm, I can simplify \\( \\sqrt{20} \\) to \\( 2\\sqrt{5} \\) because \\( 20 = 4 \\times 5 \\)"

            "output": " and \\( \\sqrt{4} = 2 \\).\n\nSo, putting it all back into the formula:\n\\[ y = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\nNow, let me simplify that. I can factor out a 2 from the numerator:\n\\[ y = \\frac{2(2 \\pm \\sqrt{5})}{2} \\]\nThe 2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:\n\\[ y = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{5} \\]\nSo, the two solutions are:\n1. \\( y = 2 + \\sqrt{5} \\)\n2. \\( y = 2 - \\sqrt{5} \\)\n\nSince both are real numbers, does that mean there are two y-intercepts? Let me double-check.\n\nYes, the quadratic equation gave me two distinct real roots, which means the parabola crosses the y-axis at two points. Therefore, the graph has two y-intercepts.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me verify the discriminant again. So, discriminant \\( D = b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\). Correct, which is positive, so two real solutions.\n\nSo, yeah, there should be two y-intercepts for this parabola.\n</think>\n\nTo find the y-intercepts of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), we set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\). \n\n1. Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation:\n   \\[ 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\]\n2. This is a quadratic equation in the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n3. Use the quadratic formula:\n   \\[ y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n4. Plug in the values:\n   \\[ y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 4}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = \\"
