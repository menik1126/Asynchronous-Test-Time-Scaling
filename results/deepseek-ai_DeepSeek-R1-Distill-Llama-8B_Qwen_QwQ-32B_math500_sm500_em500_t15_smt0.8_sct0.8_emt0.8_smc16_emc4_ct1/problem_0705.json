So, I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation gives:\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). To find the number of real solutions, I'll calculate the discriminant using the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic equation is of the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nThe discriminant \\( D \\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (\\( D > 0 \\)), there are two distinct real solutions for \\( y \\). This means the parabola intersects the y-axis at two points.\n\nTherefore, the graph of the parabola \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of **y-intercepts** of the parabola defined by the equation \n\\[ x = y^2 - 4y - 1, \\]\nfollow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand What a Y-Intercept Is\nA **y-intercept** is a point where the graph intersects the **y-axis**. On the y-axis, the **x-coordinate** is always **0**. Therefore, to find the y-intercepts, we set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the Equation\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Quadratic Equation for \\( y \\)\nThe equation is a quadratic in terms of \\( y \\), of the form:\n\\[ y^2 + by"
