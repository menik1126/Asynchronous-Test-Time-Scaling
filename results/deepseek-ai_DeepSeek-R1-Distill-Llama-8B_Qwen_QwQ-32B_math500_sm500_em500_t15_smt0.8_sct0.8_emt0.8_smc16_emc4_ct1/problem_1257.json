Essentially, I need to express 999 as a sum of powers of 6.\n\nI'll start by determining the highest power of 6 that is less than or equal to 999. Calculating the powers of 6, I find that 6 to the 5th power is 7776, which is too large. The next lower power is 6 to the 4th power, which is 1296. That's also larger than 999. \n\nContinuing down, 6 cubed is 216. Now, 216 is less than 999, so I'll use this power first. I'll divide 999 by 216 to find out how many 216s fit into 999. The division gives me 4 with a remainder. This means there are 4 units of 216 in the base 6 number.\n\nNext, I'll move to the next lower power of 6, which is 6 squared (36). Taking the remainder from the previous division, I divide 999 - (4 * 216) = 999 - 864 = 135 by 36. This gives me 3 with another remainder. So, there are 3 units of 36 in the base 6 number.\n\nMoving to the next lower power, which is 6 to the first power (6), I take the remainder from the previous step, 135 - (3 * 36) = 135 - 108 = 27, and divide it by 6. This results in 4 with no remainder. Therefore, there are 4 units of 6 in the base 6 number.\n\nSince there's no remainder left, I don't need to include a unit for 6 to the zero power (which is 1). \n\nFinally, I'll compile all these coefficients together to form the base 6 number: 4 units of 216, 3 units of 36, and 4 units of 6. This gives me 4*6^4 + 3*6^3 + 4*6^2 = 4*1296 + 3*216 + 4*36, which simplifies to 4356 + 648 + 144 = 5148 in base "

Let me recalculate the powers of 6 again:\n\n6^0 = 1\n\n6^1 = 6\n\n6^2 = 36\n\n6^3 = 216\n\n6^4 = 1296\n\nAh, so 6^4 is 1296, which is larger than 999, so the highest power needed is actually 6^3 = 216. Therefore, the highest exponent is 3, so the digits will be up to 6^3.\n\nWait, so my initial step was wrong. Let me start over.\n\nStarting over:\n\nFirst, find the highest power of 6 less than or equal to 999. \n\n6^0 = 1\n\n6^1 = 6\n\n6^2 = 36\n\n6^3 = 216\n\n6^4 = 1296 (too big)\n\nSo the highest power is 6^3 = 216.\n\nNow, divide 999 by 216. \n\n999 ÷ 216 = 4.625. So the coefficient for 6^3 is 4. \n\n4 * 216 = 864. Subtract that from 999: 999 - 864 = 135.\n\nNow move to the next lower power, which is 6^2 = 36.\n\n135 ÷ 36 = 3.75. So the coefficient here is 3.\n\n3 * 36 = 108. Subtract: 135 - 108 = 27.\n\nNext power is 6^1 = 6.\n\n27 ÷ 6 = 4.5. So coefficient is 4.\n\n4 * 6 = 24. Subtract: 27 - 24 = 3.\n\nNext power is 6^0 = 1.\n\n3 ÷ 1 = 3. So coefficient is 3.\n\nPutting all coefficients together: 4 (for 6^3), 3 (for 6^2), 4 (for 6^1), and 3 (for"
