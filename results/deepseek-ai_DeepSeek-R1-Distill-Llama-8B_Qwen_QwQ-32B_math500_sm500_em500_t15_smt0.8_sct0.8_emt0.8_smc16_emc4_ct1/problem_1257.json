            "output": "To find the base six equivalent of the number 999 in decimal, I first need to understand what each digit in the number represents in base six.\n\nStarting with the rightmost digit, which is the units place in base six, the number 9 in base ten doesn't correspond directly to a single digit in base six. It's equivalent to 1×6¹ + 3×6⁰, which means it's 13 in base six.\n\nNext, I move to the middle digit. The digit 9 here represents a value of 1×6² + 3×6¹. Calculating this gives 36 + 18, which sums up to 54 in decimal.\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit, also 9, represents 1×6³ + 3×6². This equals 216 + 72, totaling 288 in decimal.\n\nNow, I convert each of these base six components back into their decimal equivalents:\n\n- 3×6² = 3×36 = 108\n- 1×6² = 36\n- 3×6¹ = 18\n- 1×6¹ = 6\n- 3×6⁰ = 3\n- 1×6⁰ = 1\n\nAdding these together: 108 + 36 + 18 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 172 in decimal.\n\nTo ensure the result is accurate, I verify each step and confirm that the base six conversion process was correctly applied.\n\nTherefore, the base six equivalent of 999 in base ten is 1333.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\), we'll perform a base conversion. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understand Base Six Digits**:\n   - In base six, the digits used are 0 to 5.\n   - Each digit position represents a power of six:\n     - Rightmost digit: \\(6^0 = 1\\)\n     - Middle digit: \\(6^1 = 6\\)\n     - Leftmost digit: \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n\n2. **Break Down the Decimal Number**:\n   - We'll break down \\(999_{10}\\) into its individual digits:\n     ```\n     9 (in the hundreds place) 9 (in the tens place) 9 (in the ones place)\n     ``"

            "output": "`\n\n3. **Convert Each Digit to Base Six**:\n   - **Rightmost Digit (Ones Place)**:\n     - The digit is 9. Since base six digits must be less than 6, we divide by 6:\n       - \\(9 \\div 6 = 1\\) with a remainder of 3.\n       - This gives the rightmost digit as 3 and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n   - **Middle Digit (Tens Place)**:\n     - The digit is 9 plus the carry-over of 1, totaling 10.\n     - Divide by 6 again:\n       - \\(10 \\div 6 = 1\\) with a remainder of 4.\n       - This gives the middle digit as 4 and carry over 1 to the next digit.\n   - **Leftmost Digit (Hundreds Place)**:\n     - The digit is 9 plus the carry-over of 1, totaling 10.\n     - Divide by 6:\n       - \\(10 \\div 6 = 1\\) with a remainder of 4.\n       - This gives the leftmost digit as 4 and carry over 1 to the next higher digit.\n   - **Next Higher Digit (Thousands Place)**:\n     - The carry-over of 1 remains, so the next digit is 1.\n\n4. **Combine the Digits**:\n   - Combining all digits from highest to lowest gives \\(1\\ 4\\ 4\\ 3\\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Convert back to decimal to confirm:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 6^3 + 4 \\times 6^2 + 4 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0 = 216 + 144 + 24 + 3 = 387\n     \\]\n   - Wait, this result is incorrect. Let me recheck the steps.\n\n**Revised Steps**:\n- **Correct Approach**:\n  - Divide 999 by 6 repeatedly and record the remainders:\n    1. \\(999 \\div 6 = 166\\) with remainder \\(3\\).\n    2. \\(166 \\div 6 = 27\\) with remainder \\(4\\).\n    3. \\(27 \\div 6 = 4\\) with remainder \\("
