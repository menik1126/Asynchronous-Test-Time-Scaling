            "output": "To determine when the two gears will next align their marks due north, I need to find the time when both gears complete an integer number of turns simultaneously.\n\nFirst, I'll convert the gears' rotations from per-minute to per-second to ensure consistent units.\n\nGear 1 rotates 33 1/3 times per minute. Converting this to per-second:\n33 1/3 rotations per minute = (33 + 1/3) * 60 seconds = 1998/3 * 60/60 = 1998/3 = 666 rotations per minute.\n\nGear 2 rotates 45 times per minute, which is already in per-minute.\n\nNext, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods to determine when they'll align again.\n\nThe LCM of 666 and 45 is calculated by breaking down each number into its prime factors:\n- 666 = 2 * 3^3 * 37\n- 45 = 3^2 * 5\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present:\nLCM = 2 * 3^3 * 5 * 37 = 10 * 27 * 5 * 37 = 10,530 rotations.\n\nSince Gear 1 makes 666 rotations per minute, the time needed to complete 10,530 rotations is:\n10,530 rotations / 666 rotations per minute = 15.75 minutes.\n\nFinally, converting minutes to seconds:\n15.75 minutes = 15.75 * 60 = 945 seconds.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Gear 1** rotates \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute.\n- **Gear 2** rotates \\(45\\) times per minute.\n\n**Objective:** Find the number of seconds after which both gears will have their marks pointing due north again.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Rotation Rates\n- **Gear 1:** \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) rotations per minute.\n- **Gear 2:** \\(45\\) rotations per minute.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Rotation Rates to Seconds\nFirst, convert the rotations per minute to rotations per second.\n\n- **For Gear 1:**\n  \\[\n  33\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ rotations/minute} = 33 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\"

Let \\(t\\) be the time in seconds when this happens.\n\n- **Gear 1:** \\(\\frac{5}{9} \\times t\\) must be an integer.\n- **Gear 2:** \\(\\frac{3}{4} \\times t\\) must be an integer.\n\nLet \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) be integers such that:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{9}t = n \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{3}{4}t = m\n\\]\nSolving for \\(t\\):\n\\[\nt = \\frac{9}{5}n \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = \\frac{4}{3}m\n\\]\nThus, \\(t\\) must be a common multiple of \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\). To find the smallest such \\(t\\), compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the numerators divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominators.\n\n### Step 4: Compute LCM of the Rotation Periods\nAlternatively, consider the periods (time for one full rotation) of each gear:\n- **Gear 1's period:** \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{9}} = \\frac{9}{5} \\) seconds per rotation.\n- **Gear 2's period:** \\( \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds per rotation.\n\nThe LCM of the periods will give the first time they align:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}\\left(\\frac{9}{5}, \\frac{"
