            "output": "Okay, I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x), which is defined as the square root of (x - 3) squared minus (x - 8) squared. So, the function is g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2].\n\nFirst, I remember that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to zero because you can't have a square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, I need to find when (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 is greater than or equal to zero.\n\nHmm, let me write that down as an inequality:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0.\n\nI think this looks like a difference of squares, which has a factoring formula. The formula for a^2 - b^2 is (a - b)(a + b). So maybe I can factor the expression inside the square root.\n\nLet me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). Then, (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 factors into (a - b)(a + b). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute (a - b): (x - 3) - (x - 8). That simplifies to x - 3 - x + 8. The x terms cancel out, leaving (-3 + 8) which is 5.\n\nNext, compute (a + b): (x - 3) + (x - 8). That simplifies to x - 3 + x - 8. Combine like terms: 2x - 11.\n\nSo, the expression inside the square root becomes (5)(2x - 11). Therefore, the inequality is 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0.\n\nNow, I can divide both sides by 5 because 5 is positive, and the inequality sign doesn't change. So, 2x - 11 ≥ 0.\n\nSolving for x, I add 11 to both sides: 2x ≥ 11.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2: x ≥ 11/2.\n\nSo, the expression inside the square root is non-negative when x is greater than or equal"

Since the domain starts at x = 11/2, the smallest x is 11/2.\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Started with g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2]. Correct.\n\n2. Set up the inequality (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0. That makes sense because the inside of the square root must be non-negative.\n\n3. Factored using a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). Yes, that's the difference of squares formula.\n\n4. Calculated (a - b) = (x - 3) - (x - 8) = 5. That seems right. The x terms cancel out, and constants add to 5.\n\n5. Calculated (a + b) = (x - 3) + (x - 8) = 2x - 11. That also looks correct. Combining like terms gives 2x - 11.\n\n6. So, expression is 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0. Divided both sides by 5 (positive, so inequality remains same): 2x - 11 ≥ 0.\n\n7. Solved for x: 2x ≥ 11, so x ≥ 11/2. That seems right, 5.5.\n\nSo, the domain is x ≥ 5.5, so the smallest real number is 5.5.\n\nWait, let me verify the factoring again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there because sometimes when I factor, I might mix up signs.\n\nWait, so the original expression was (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. So, a = (x - 3), b = (x - 8). So, a - b = (x - 3) - (x - 8) = x - 3 - x + 8 = 5. Correct.\n\na + b = (x - 3) +"
