I can't rearrange the terms, just add parentheses. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, let me write down the original expression to visualize it better: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. Without any parentheses, the calculation goes from left to right with the given operations. Let me compute that to see what the result is. \n\nStarting with 1 + 2, that's 3. Then 3 + 3 is 6. Next, subtract 4, so 6 - 4 is 2. Then add 5, so 2 + 5 is 7. Finally, add 6, which gives 13. So, the original value is indeed 13.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimum value we can get by adding parentheses. I remember that parentheses change the order of operations, so by grouping certain numbers together, I can affect the result. Since all operations are addition and subtraction, I need to think about how to group numbers in a way that maximizes the subtraction effect, because subtraction can reduce the total.\n\nLet me think about how parentheses can affect the operations. If I group a positive number with a negative number, that might lead to a larger subtraction, which could decrease the total. Alternatively, grouping negative numbers together would make their subtraction effect more pronounced. Wait, but in the original expression, the only negative is the -4. So maybe I should try to group numbers before the -4 in a way that makes the result as large as possible before subtracting, or group numbers after the -4 in a way that increases their sum, thus reducing the overall value.\n\nLet me try some different groupings:\n\n1. What if I group the first three numbers: (1 + 2 + 3). That gives me 6. So the expression becomes 6 - 4 + 5 + 6. Let me compute that: 6 - 4 is 2, then 2 +5 is 7, then 7 +6 is 13. Hmm, same as original.\n\n2. What if I group 1 + 2 + 3 - 4. That is 6"

Wait, that was the example given in the problem, which gives 3. That's better. But can we do even lower?\n\nLet me try that example again. The example was 1+2+3-(4+5)+6. So that's (1+2+3) =6, then subtract (4+5)=9, so 6-9 = -3, then add 6 gives 3. So that's 3. But maybe there's a way to get even lower.\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping more terms together. Let's see. Let me try different groupings step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 +6. The operations are all addition and subtraction, so parentheses can group any of these terms in different ways. Since subtraction is left-associative by default, but parentheses can override that.\n\nLet me consider all possible places where parentheses can be inserted. Since the expression is a sequence of numbers and operators, parentheses can be added around any subexpression. Let me think of all possible groupings that can lead to a lower value than 3.\n\nLet me try grouping the -4 with the following terms. For instance, if I group the -4 +5 as ( -4 +5 ), but that would be 1, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe group 4 +5 +6 together? Let's see.\n\nWait, let's think of different possibilities:\n\nOption 1: Group the first few terms to make a large number before subtracting something big.\n\nOption 2: Group terms after the -4 to make a larger number to subtract.\n\nWait, perhaps if I can make the subtraction of a larger number. Since the only subtraction is the -4, but maybe by grouping terms after that, I can turn that into subtracting a larger group. For example, if I can write it as 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 +5 +6). Let me check that.\n\nCalculating that: 1+2+3 is 6, then subtract ("

But wait, is that a valid placement of parentheses?\n\nLet me write it as 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 +5 +6). So the original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. To group 4 +5 +6, I would have to place parentheses starting at 4, so 1+2+3 - (4+5+6). Is that allowed? Or does the original expression have the numbers in a specific order that can't be regrouped like that?\n\nWait, the problem says we cannot change the order of the terms, only add parentheses. So I can't rearrange the numbers; they have to stay in the given order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, but I can group different operations together by adding parentheses. So if I group starting at 4, I can have 4 +5 +6, but would the previous terms be before that grouped as 1 +2 +3, or can I have a different grouping?\n\nWait, let's clarify. The expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So the operators are: between 1 and 2 is +, between 2 and3 is +, between 3 and4 is -, between 4 and5 is +, between5 and6 is +. So parentheses can enclose any subsets, but the numbers stay in order.\n\nSo for instance, if I want to group 4,5,6, I can write 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6). So that would be permissible because it's adding parentheses without changing the order.\n\nSimilarly, I can group other subsets, like 3 -4, but that would be (3 -4), which is -1. Alternatively, group 2 +3 -4. Let me try that. Let me enclose 2 +3 -4 in parentheses.\n\nSo that would be 1 + (2 +3 -4) +5 +6. Compute that: 2 +3 is 5, minus 4 is 1, then 1 +1 is 2, then 2 +5 is 7, "

Since subtraction is only at the -4, but perhaps by grouping terms after the -4, we can subtract a larger value. For example, if I can make the expression into 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6), which would be 6 -15 = -9, then adding nothing else? Wait, but in the original expression, after the -4, there is a +5 and +6. So if I group 4 +5 +6, then the expression becomes 1+2+3 - (4+5+6). That would indeed be 6 -15 = -9. But is that allowed?\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again. The original is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So the operator before the 4 is a minus, so the term is -4, followed by +5 and +6. So if I group the 4,5,6 together, the expression would be 1+2+3 - (4+5+6). Since the operator before the 4 is -, so the parentheses would group the 4+5+6, so the entire term becomes subtracted. That seems valid. So that gives -9, which is better than the example's 3. So maybe that's the minimum?\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a way to get even lower. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, can I group terms before the -4 in a way that reduces the value before subtracting?\n\nWait, but the terms before the -4 are 1+2+3. If I group them as (1 +2 +3), that's 6. If I group them differently, like (1 + (2 +3)), which is still 6. So that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe group 1 + (2 +3 -4).

Then the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 -9 +6, which is what the example did, giving 3.\n\nAlternatively, can I group 5 +6 to make 11? But then I would have 1 +2 +3 -4 +11. Let me compute that: 1+2=3, +3=6, -4=2, +11=13. Same as before.\n\nWait, but if I group 4 +5 +6, that gives a larger subtraction. So 1 +2 +3 - (4+5+6). Let me check if the parentheses can be placed correctly.\n\nThe original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. So the minus sign is before the 4, and then there's a plus 5 and plus 6. So I can group 4 +5 +6 as (4 +5 +6), and since the operator before 4 is -, the entire (4 +5 +6) is subtracted. So the expression would be 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6) = 6 -15 = -9, which is lower than 3.\n\nWait, that's much lower. Can I go lower than that?

Let me see. For instance, if I can write 1 +2 +3 - (4 -5 +6). Wait, but the original operators after 4 are +5 and +6, so to have 4 -5 +6, that would require changing the operator between 4 and5 to a minus, which isn't allowed. The problem states that we can't change the operators, only add parentheses. So the operators between the numbers must stay as they are. So between 4 and5 is a plus, so I can't make that a minus. So that grouping isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, can I group 4 +5 as (4+5), then the expression becomes 1+2+3 - (4+5) +6, which is the example, giving 3. Alternatively, group 4 +5 +6 as (4+5+6), so subtracting that entire sum, which gives -9. That's better.\n\nWait, so that's the key. Let me confirm again. The original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. The operators are between the numbers as follows:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6.\n\nSo the minus is only before the 4. So if I group the 4,5,6 together, the expression becomes 1+2+3 - (4+5+6).

Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, group 1 +2 + (3 -4) +5 +6. That gives 1+2=3, 3-1=2, then 2+5+6=13.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, group 1 + (2 +3) -4 +5 +6. That's 1+5=6, then 6-4=2, etc. Still 13.\n\nAlternatively, group 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5) +6. That's the example, giving 3. \n\nAlternatively, group 1 +2 +3 -4 + (5 +6). That gives 1+2+3=6, 6-4=2, then +11=13.\n\nHmm. So the only way to get lower than 3 is by grouping 4+5+6, leading to -9. \n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way to group terms before the minus to make the value before the minus smaller, so that when you subtract 15, it's even lower. Wait, but the terms before the minus are 1+2+3. If I can make that smaller, but they are all additions, so the minimal they can be is 6. So"

Subtract the second result from the first: \\(6 - 15 = -9\\).\n\nThis grouping results in the minimum value of \\(-9\\).

If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain?
