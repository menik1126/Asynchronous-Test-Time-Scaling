            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial equation: \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\), where the coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) are integers. I need to find the number of different possible rational roots for this polynomial. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. It says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. So, in this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. \n\nLet me write down the possible values for \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). The factors of 1 are just ±1, right? Because 1 only has two factors, 1 and -1. Then, the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. So, combining these, the possible rational roots are \\(\\frac{\\pm1}{1}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pm1}{2}\\). That gives me the possible roots as ±1, ±1/2. \n\nWait, so let me list them out to make sure I haven't missed any: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That's four possible rational roots. Is there a chance I might have missed something? Let me double-check. The constant term is 1, so possible numerators are only 1 and -1. The leading coefficient is 2, so possible denominators are 1, 2. That means the fractions can be 1/1, -1/1, 1/2, -1/2. So yeah, four possible rational roots.\n\nI think that's all of them. There are no other integers that divide 1 except for 1 and -1, and for 2, the factors are 1, 2, -1, -2, but since we're combining them, it's just those four possibilities. So, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nI don't think there's anything else I need to consider here. The polynomial is of degree 4, so"

            "output": " maybe some roots are irrational or complex, but the question is specifically about rational roots. The coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) are integers, but since they can vary, all the roots I listed are possible depending on the coefficients. \n\nLet me confirm with an example. Suppose if the polynomial had a root at 1, then plugging in x=1 gives \\(2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 +1 =0\\), so \\(a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = -3\\). Since they are integers, this is possible. Similarly, if I plug in x=-1: \\(2(-1)^4 + a_3(-1)^3 + a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) +1 = 0\\). That simplifies to \\(2 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 +1 =0\\), so \\(-a_3 -a_1 = -3 - (a_2 +3)\\) hmm maybe that's getting too complicated. But the point is, coefficients can be chosen to make these roots possible. \n\nAlternatively, for the 1/2 case: plugging in x=1/2 gives \\(2*(1/2)^4 + a_3*(1/2)^3 + a_2*(1/2)^2 + a_1*(1/2) +1 =0\\). Multiplying both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators: 2*(1/16)*16 + ... Hmm, perhaps just the key point is that even with those fractions, there exists integers a3, a2, a1 such that the equation holds. Since coefficients are integers, but scaling appropriately, they can accommodate that. \n\nTherefore, I think those four are indeed possible, so the number is 4.\n\nWait, but the question says \"different possible rational roots\". Does that mean that even if some of these can't be achieved for any coefficients, they don't count? Let me see. Is there any of these four that cannot be a root of the polynomial regardless of the coefficients a3, a2, a1?\n\nSuppose someone says maybe 1. Let's see, set x=1: then the polynomial becomes 2 + a3 + a2 + a1 +1 =0 →"

            "output": " a3 +a2 +a1 =-3. Since a3, a2, a1 are integers, this is achievable. So 1 is a possible root.\n\nSimilarly, x=-1: plug in, we get 2 - a3 + a2 -a1 +1=0 → -a3 -a1 = -3 -a2, which is again achievable because all variables are integers.\n\nx=1/2: plug into polynomial, 2*(1/16) + a3*(1/8) + a2*(1/4) + a1*(1/2) +1=0. Multiply all by 16: 2 + 2a3 +4a2 +8a1 +16=0 → 2a3 +4a2 +8a1 = -18. Divide both sides by 2: a3 +2a2 +4a1 = -9. Since a3, a2, a1 are integers, this is also achievable. For example, set a3=1, a2=0, a1=-2. Then 1 + 0 + -8 = -7 ≠-9. Hmm, maybe pick a different set. Let's see, a3=3, a2=0, a1=-6: 3 +0 -24 = -21. No, that's not helpful. Maybe a3=-7, a2=0, a1=2: -7 +0 +8=-(-9 + 8? No, that might not work). Alternatively, a3= -9, a2=0, a1=0: -9 +0 +0=-9. Bingo! So if a3=-9, a2=0, a1=0, then when plugging in x=1/2, we get the root. So yes, 1/2 is achievable.\n\nSimilarly, x=-1/2: plug into polynomial, 2*(1/16) + a3*(-1/8) + a2*(1/4) + a1*(-1/2) +1=0. Multiply all terms by 16: 2 -2a3 +4a2 -8a1 +16=0 → -2a3 +4a2 -8a1 = -18.

Hmm, 2a2 -4a1 must equal -9. The left side is even (since 2 and 4 are multiples of 2, so 2*(a2 -2a1)), but the right side is -9 which is odd. That's a problem. So maybe that's not possible. Wait, so does that mean that x=-1/2 can't be a root?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check again.

Alternatively, a1=1, then a3=5; a1=2, a3=1; a1=3, a3=-3; etc. So, yes, there are integer solutions. Let me test with a1=0, a2=0, a3=9.\n\nSo putting these into the original equation:\n\n2x^4 +9x^3 +0x^2 +0x +1.
