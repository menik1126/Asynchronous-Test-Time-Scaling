            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial equation: \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\). The coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) are integers, but I don't know their exact values. The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots this polynomial could have. Hmm, alright. \n\nFirst, I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me try to recall how that works. The theorem states that any possible rational solution (root) of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients is of the form \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nSo, in this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. That means any rational root must have a numerator that is a factor of 1 and a denominator that is a factor of 2. The factors of 1 are just ±1, right? And the factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, the possible values for \\(p\\) (the numerator) are ±1, since 1 is the constant term. The possible values for \\(q\\) (the denominator) are ±1 and ±2 because the leading coefficient is 2. So, when we take all possible combinations of \\(p\\) over \\(q\\), we get several possible rational roots.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. When \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 1\\), we get \\( \\frac{1}{1} = 1 \\).\n2. When \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = -1\\), we get \\( \\frac{1}{-1} = -1 \\).\n3. When \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 2\\), we get \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n4. When \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = -2\\), we get \\( \\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n5. When \\(p = -1\\) and \\(q = 1\\), we get \\( \\frac{-1}{1} = -1"

When \\(p = -1\\) and \\(q = -2\\), we get \\( \\frac{-1}{-2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nWait, hold on. I think I might be duplicating some roots here. For example, both cases where \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 1\\) and \\(p = -1\\) and \\(q = -1\\) give me 1 and -1 respectively. Similarly, other combinations might result in repeats. So, to avoid overcounting, I should consider unique values.\n\nLet me list all the possible roots without duplication:\n\nLooking at the possible numerators and denominators, the unique possible rational roots are ±1 and ±1/2. So that's four possible distinct rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2.\n\nBut hold on, the polynomial is of degree 4, so there could be up to 4 roots, but this is about possible rational roots, not necessarily all of them. The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots, so it's how many unique candidates there are, given the coefficients can vary.\n\nWait another thought: the coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) can be any integers. So, does that affect the possible rational roots? Let me think. The Rational Root Theorem only depends on the constant term and the leading coefficient, not on the other coefficients in between. So, whether or not a polynomial has a rational root depends only on whether that candidate \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\) satisfies the equation, but it doesn't restrict the possible candidates. Therefore, regardless of the middle coefficients, the possible rational roots are still limited to those given by the constant term and leading coefficient.\n\nSo, even though the middle coefficients can change, the possible candidates for rational roots are always ±1 and ±1/2. So, that gives us exactly four different possible rational roots.\n\nBut let me verify if I missed any other possible roots. For the constant term, which is 1"

            "output": ", the factors are only ±1, so p can only be ±1. The leading coefficient is 2, so factors are ±1, ±2. Therefore, the possible p/q combinations are indeed ±1/1, ±1/2. So, four possibilities. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if all of these are actually possible? Like, could there be a case where, for example, 1/2 can't be a root for some reason?\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me try to construct a polynomial where each of these is a root and see if it's possible.\n\nFirst, let's try to make 1 a root. If 1 is a root, then plugging in x=1:\n\n2(1)^4 + a_3(1)^3 + a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) + 1 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to 2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + 1 = 0 => a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = -3. Since a_3, a_2, a_1 are integers, this is possible. For example, set a_3 = 0, a_2 = 0, a_1 = -3. So yes, possible.\n\nSimilarly, let's try -1 as a root. Plugging in x = -1:\n\n2(-1)^4 + a_3(-1)^3 + a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) + 1 = 0\n\nSimplifies to 2 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 + 1 = 0 => -a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = -3. Again, integers can satisfy this. For instance, set a_3 = 0, a_2 = 0, a_1 = 3. Then -0 + 0 -3 = -3, so that works.\n\nNow, 1/2 as a root. Let's plug in x = 1/2:\n\n2*(1/2)^4 + a_3*(1/2)^3 + a_2*(1/2)^2 + a_1*(1/2) + 1 = 0\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\n\n"

So, equation: a_3 + 2a_2 + 4a_1 = -9.\n\nSince a's are integers, can we find integers that satisfy this? For example, let a_3 = 0, a_2 = 0, then 4a_1 = -9 => a_1 = -9/4. Not integer. Hmm. So maybe pick other a's.\n\nLet me try a_3 = 1:\n\n1 + 2a_2 +4a_1 = -8 => 2a_2 +4a_1 = -9. Maybe set a_2 = 1: 2 + 4a_1 = -9 => 4a_1 = -11 => a_1 = -11/4.

Since the polynomial has integer coefficients, then (2x -1) must be a factor. So, if I have (2x -1) as a factor, then the polynomial can be written as (2x -1)(some cubic polynomial with integer coefficients). Let me try that.\n\nLet me suppose the polynomial factors as (2x -1)(bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e). Since the leading term is 2x^4, then 2x * bx^3 = 2x^4, so b must be 1. So, (2x -1)(x^3 + cx^2 + dx + e). Let's multiply this out:\n\nFirst term: 2x * x^3 = 2x^4\n\n2x * cx^2 = 2c x^3\n\n2x * dx = 2d x^2\n\n2x * e = 2e x\n\n-1 * x^3 = -x^3\n\n-1 * cx^2 = -c x^2\n\n-1 * dx = -d x\n\n-1 * e = -e\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x^4 + (2c -1)x^3 + (2d - c)x^2 + (2e - d)x - e\n\nNow, the original polynomial is 2x^4 + a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x +1. Comparing coefficients:\n\n- The constant term is -e, which must equal 1. So, -e =1 => e = -1.\n\nThen, the x term coefficient: 2e - d = a1. Since e = -1, that becomes 2*(-1) - d = a1 => -2 -d = a1.\n\nThe x^2 term: (2d - c) = a2.\n\nThe x^3 term: (2c -1) = a3.\n\nThe leading term is okay.\n\nSo, as long as we can choose integers c and d such that these equations hold, then such a polynomial exists.

So, if I pick d=0, then a2=0, a1=-2. Thus, the polynomial becomes:\n\n2x^4 -1x^3 + 0x^2 -2x +1. Then, evaluating at x=1/2:\n\n2*(1/2)^4 - (1/2)^3 + 0 -2*(1/2) +1 = 2*(1/16) - (1/8) -1 +1.\n\nCalculating:\n\n= (1/8) - (1/8) -1 +1 = 0. So yes, x=1/2 is a root.\n\nTherefore, indeed, 1/2 is a possible rational root.\n\nSimilarly, let's test -1/2.
