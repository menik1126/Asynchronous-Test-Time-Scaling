            "output": "First, I need to determine the robot's speed. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. To find the speed in meters per second, I'll convert the distance and time to compatible units.\n\nNext, I'll convert 2.5 hours to hours and then to seconds. Since 1 hour equals 3600 seconds, 2.5 hours is 9000 seconds.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the speed by dividing the distance in meters (1000 meters) by the time in seconds (9000 seconds), which gives the robot a speed of approximately 0.111 meters per second.\n\nNow, using the calculated speed, I'll find the length of the hallway by multiplying the speed by the time it takes to travel the hallway, which is 90 seconds. Therefore, the hallway is 10 meters long.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The robot travels **1 kilometer** in **2.5 hours** at a constant speed.\n- It takes the robot **90 seconds** to travel the length of a particular hallway at the same speed.\n\n**Step 1: Find the Robot's Speed**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the robot's speed in meters per second (m/s).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n\\]\n\nConvert the time from hours to seconds:\n\\[\n2.5 \\text{ hours} = 2.5 \\times 3600 \\text{ seconds} = 9000 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the speed:\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{1}{9} \\text{ m/s} \\approx 0.111 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Length of the Hallway**\n\nUsing the robot's speed, we can find the length of the hallway.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = 0.111 \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ seconds} = 10 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{10 \\text{ meters}}\n\\]"
