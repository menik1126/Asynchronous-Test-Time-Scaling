Hmm, modulus of a complex number, right? That's the absolute value, the distance from the origin in the complex plane. \n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number a + bi, the modulus |a + bi| is sqrt(a² + b²). So, maybe I can calculate w first and then find its modulus. Let me try that.\n\nSo, z is 1 + i. Let me plug that into the expression for w. That would make w equal to (3*(1 + i) + 1)/(5*(1 + i) + 7). Let me compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 3*(1 + i) + 1. That would be 3*1 + 3*i + 1, which is 3 + 3i + 1. Combining like terms, 3 + 1 is 4, so the numerator is 4 + 3i.\n\nNow the denominator: 5*(1 + i) + 7. So, 5*1 is 5, 5*i is 5i, plus 7. So, that's 5 + 5i + 7, which is 12 + 5i. \n\nSo now I have w as (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). To find the modulus of w, I recall that for a complex number expressed as a fraction, the modulus is the modulus of the numerator divided by the modulus of the denominator. \n\nSo, that would mean |w| = |4 + 3i| / |12 + 5i|.\n\nCalculating the modulus of the numerator: |4 + 3i| is sqrt(4² + 3²) which is sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nSimilarly, the modulus of the denominator: |12 + 5i| is sqrt(12² + 5²) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13.\n\nTherefore, |w| is 5/13.\n\nWait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes in my"

            "output": " calculations. So, numerator: 3*(1 + i) is 3 + 3i, adding 1 gives 4 + 3i. Denominator: 5*(1 + i) is 5 + 5i, adding 7 gives 12 + 5i. Then modulus calculations: numerator is 5, denominator is 13. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, could I have approached this differently? Maybe by rationalizing the denominator or something? Let me see. If I have (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i), I could multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to make it a real number. That would give me (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) / (12² + 5²). But that seems more complicated than necessary because I don't actually need the exact value of w, just its modulus.\n\nSo, since modulus is multiplicative, |w| = |numerator| / |denominator| is correct. Yeah, so I think my initial approach was efficient and correct.\n\nJust to recap: compute numerator and denominator, calculate each modulus, then divide. Steps are clear and straightforward. No mistakes noticed this time either.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulus of \\( w \\), we first compute the modulus of the numerator and the denominator separately. \n\n1. Compute the modulus of the numerator \\( 3z + 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   |3z + 1| = |3(1 + i) + 1| = |4 + 3i| = \\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = 5\n   \\]\n2. Compute the modulus of the denominator \\( 5z + 7 \\):\n   \\[\n   |5z + 7| = |5(1 + i) + 7| = |12 + 5i| = \\sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} = 13\n   \\]\n3. Divide the moduli:\n   \\[\n   |w| = \\frac{|3z + 1|}{|5z + 7|} = \\frac{5}{13}\n   \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}\n\\]"
