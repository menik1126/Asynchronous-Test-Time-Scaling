            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here: Let \\( z = 1 + i \\) and \\( w = \\dfrac{3z + 1}{5z + 7} \\). I need to find \\( |w| \\), which is the modulus of the complex number \\( w \\). Hmm, okay. I remember that the modulus of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is calculated as \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\). But since \\( w \\) is a fraction, maybe I need to first simplify it before finding its modulus. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably plug in the value of \\( z \\) into both the numerator and the denominator of \\( w \\). So, let me write that out:\n\nNumerator: \\( 3z + 1 = 3(1 + i) + 1 \\)\nDenominator: \\( 5z + 7 = 5(1 + i) + 7 \\)\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the numerator: \\( 3(1 + i) + 1 \\). I can distribute the 3 first, so that becomes \\( 3*1 + 3*i + 1 \\). That simplifies to \\( 3 + 3i + 1 \\). Combining like terms, 3 and 1 make 4, so the numerator is \\( 4 + 3i \\).\n\nNow for the denominator: \\( 5(1 + i) + 7 \\). Distribute the 5 first: \\( 5*1 + 5*i + 7 \\). That gives me \\( 5 + 5i + 7 \\). Adding 5 and 7 gives 12, so the denominator is \\( 12 + 5i \\).\n\nSo now, \\( w = \\dfrac{4 + 3i}{12 + 5i} \\). Okay, so \\( w \\) is a complex fraction. To find the modulus, I think I need to rationalize the denominator, because the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli. But wait, is that right? Let me recall: \\( |w| = \\left| \\dfrac{a}{b} \\right| = \\dfrac{|a|}{|b|} \\). Yes, that's correct. So,"

            "output": " if I can find the modulus of the numerator and the modulus of the denominator separately, then I can just divide them.\n\nSo, let's compute \\( |4 + 3i| \\) first. Using the formula for modulus, that's \\( \\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\).\n\nNext, compute \\( |12 + 5i| \\). That would be \\( \\sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13 \\).\n\nSo, \\( |w| = \\dfrac{5}{13} \\). That seems straightforward. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again, the numerator was \\( 3z + 1 \\) where \\( z = 1 + i \\). So, 3*(1 + i) is 3 + 3i, plus 1 is 4 + 3i. That seems correct. Denominator: 5z + 7, so 5*(1 + i) is 5 + 5i, plus 7 is 12 + 5i. That also seems correct. Then, modulus of numerator: 4 squared is 16, 3 squared is 9, total 25, square root is 5. Denominator modulus: 12 squared is 144, 5 squared is 25, total 169, square root is 13. So, 5 divided by 13. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could also compute \\( w \\) by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator to rationalize it, just to see if I get the same result. Let me try that.\n\nSo, \\( w = \\dfrac{4 + 3i}{12 + 5i} \\). To rationalize, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \\( 12 - 5i \\). So:\n\n\\( w = \\dfrac{(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i)}{(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)} \\)\n\nLet me compute the denominator first because it's a difference of squares, which is simpler.\n\nDenominator: \\( (12 + 5"

            "output": "i)(12 - 5i) = 12^2 - (5i)^2 = 144 - 25i^2 \\). But since \\( i^2 = -1 \\), this becomes 144 - 25*(-1) = 144 + 25 = 169. So, the denominator is 169, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow the numerator: \\( (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i) \\). Let's expand this:\n\nMultiply 4 by 12: 48\nMultiply 4 by (-5i): -20i\nMultiply 3i by 12: 36i\nMultiply 3i by (-5i): -15i^2\n\nSo, combining all these terms: 48 - 20i + 36i -15i^2.\n\nNow, combine like terms: The real parts are 48 and -15i^2. Since \\( i^2 = -1 \\), -15i^2 is +15. So, 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nThe imaginary parts: -20i + 36i = 16i.\n\nSo, numerator is 63 + 16i.\n\nTherefore, \\( w = \\dfrac{63 + 16i}{169} = \\dfrac{63}{169} + \\dfrac{16}{169}i \\).\n\nNow, let's compute the modulus of \\( w \\). That would be \\( \\sqrt{ \\left( \\dfrac{63}{169} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\dfrac{16}{169} \\right)^2 } \\).\n\nBut that's the same as \\( \\dfrac{1}{169} \\sqrt{63^2 + 16^2} \\).\n\nWait, 63 squared is 3969, and 16 squared is 256, so sum is 4225. Square root of 4225 is 65. So, the modulus is \\( \\dfrac{65}{169} \\).\n\nSimplifying \\( \\dfrac{65}{169} \\): Let's see, 65 divides by 13 is 5, and 169 is 13 squared, so 169 divided by 13 is 13. So, 65/169 reduces to 5/13. Which matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute the modulus directly by dividing the moduli of"
