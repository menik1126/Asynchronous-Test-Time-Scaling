            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). The answer should be expressed as √a / b, where a and b are positive integers, and a isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I need to find a + b.\n\nAlright, let's think about how to approach this. The distance from the origin to a point (x, y) on the graph is given by the distance formula: d = √(x² + y²). Since the point lies on the graph, y is equal to (1/√2)(x² - 3). So, I can substitute y in the distance formula.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nd = √(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²)\n\nHmm, let me square both sides to make it easier, because the square root can complicate things. If I square both sides, the smallest distance squared will be x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]². Since the square of the distance is easier to work with, and the square root will just be the square root of that result.\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\nd² = x² + (1/√2)² * (x² - 3)²\n\nSimplify (1/√2)². That should be 1/2. So:\n\nd² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nNow, let's expand (x² - 3)². That would be x⁴ - 6x² + 9. So, substituting back in:\n\nd² = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9)\n\nMultiply through by 1/2:\n\nd² = x² + (x⁴/2 - 3x² + 9/2)\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. The x² term is 1x² plus (-3x²), which is -2x², and then we have x⁴/2 and 9/2.\n\nSo, d² = x⁴/2 - 2x² + 9/2\n\nHmm, to make this easier to"

Then, the minimal distance corresponds to the minimal value of f(x). So, I can find the derivative f'(x), set it to zero, and solve for x.\n\nLet me compute the derivative:\n\nf(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nf'(x) = (d/dx)[(1/2)x⁴] - (d/dx)[2x²] + (d/dx)[9/2]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(d/dx)[(1/2)x⁴] = (1/2)*(4x³) = 2x³\n\n(d/dx)[2x²] = 4x\n\nAnd the derivative of a constant, 9/2, is zero.

So, f(-√2) is also 5/2.\n\nSo, the minimal value is 5/2 at x = √2 and x = -√2.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that the minimal distance squared? So, if f(x) is the square of the distance, then the minimal distance is the square root of 5/2. So, d = √(5/2).\n\nBut let's double-check that because 5/2 seems a bit too straightforward.\n\nWait, no. Let me see. Wait, 5/2 is the minimal value of f(x), which is d squared. So, the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2). That can be expressed as √10 / 2, since sqrt(5/2) is equal to sqrt(10)/2.\n\nWait, sqrt(5/2) can be written as √5 / √2, but rationalizing the denominator, it's √10 / 2.\n\nYes, since √(5/2) = √5 / √2 = (√5 * √2) / (√2 * √2) ) = √10 / 2.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is √10 / 2.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph\".

Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the derivative?\n\nWait, let me check the derivative again. The function f(x) is (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2. The derivative is 2x³ - 4x. Setting that to zero gives 2x³ -4x =0, so 2x(x² - 2)=0, so x=0 or x=±√2. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation of f(√2):\n\nx⁴/2 is ( (√2)^4 ) /2. (√2)^4 is (2)^2 =4, so 4/2 =2.\n\nThen -2x² is -2*(2)= -4.\n\nThen +9/2 is +4.5.\n\nSo 2 -4 +4.5 = 2.5, which is 5/2. Correct.\n\nSo, the minimal distance squared is 5/2, so the distance is sqrt(5/2). But sqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(10)/2, since sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(10)/2. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b = 12. Hmm, but let me check if there's another critical point or if I missed something.\n\nWait, but let me think again.

So, correct, x=√2 is a local minimum.\n\nWait, but is there any other minima? Let me think. The function f(x) = x⁴/2 - 2x² +9/2, as x approaches infinity, x⁴ dominates, so the function goes to infinity. Similarly as x approaches negative infinity, it goes to infinity. So, the minimal value is indeed at x=√2 and x=-√2, so the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2.\n\nWait a second. Is there any point on the graph where y is zero? Because if so, the distance from the origin to that point would be sqrt(x² + 0) = |x|. But looking at the equation y=(1/√2)(x² -3), it's zero when x² -3=0, so x=√3 or x=-√3. So, points are (sqrt3, 0) and (-sqrt3, 0). The distance from origin is sqrt( (sqrt3)^2 + 0 ) = sqrt3 ≈1.732.\n\nBut wait, the sqrt(10)/2 ≈ 3.162/2 ≈1.581, which is smaller than sqrt3. So, that would make sense because the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2, which is less than sqrt3.\n\nWait, so that makes sense. So, perhaps the minimal distance occurs at x=√2 and x=-√2, giving a smaller distance than when y is zero.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So, the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2, so a=10, b=2, so a +b= 12.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers such that a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one.\" So, 10 is square-free, since 10=2"

So, the distance squared from origin is x² + y² = x² + [ (x² -3)^2 / 2 ]\n\nSo, that's correct. Then, f(x) = x² + (x^4 -6x² +9)/2 = (2x² +x^4 -6x² +9)/2 = (x^4 -4x² +9)/2. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I had before. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, when I expanded (x² -3)^2, that's x^4 -6x² +9. Then, multiplying by 1/2 gives (x^4 -6x² +9)/2. Then, adding x², which is (2x²)/2, so total is (x^4 -6x² +9 +2x²)/2 = (x^4 -4x² +9)/2. Wait, so that's different from my previous calculation. Wait, so I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, in my initial calculation, I had:\n\nd² = x² + (1/2)(x^4 -6x² +9). So, expanding that, it's x² + (x^4)/2 -3x² + 9/2. Then, combining x² terms: 1x² -3x² = -2x². So, total is (x^4)/2 -2x² +9/2. Which is the same as (x^4 -4x² +9)/2. So, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check for any possible mistakes. So, to recap:\n\n1. Distance from origin to (x,y) is sqrt(x² + y²).\n\n2. Substitute y with (1/√2)(x² -3).\n\n3. So, distance squared is x² + (x² -3)^2 / 2.\n\n4. Expand and simplify to f(x) = (x^4 -4x² +9)/2.\n\nWait, no.

The minimal distance from a point to a curve is along the line perpendicular to the tangent of the curve at that point. So, perhaps setting the slope of the line from the origin to the point (x,y) equal to the negative reciprocal of the derivative of the curve at that point.\n\nLet me try that approach to confirm.\n\nFirst, the curve is y = (1/√2)(x² -3). The derivative dy/dx = (1/√2)(2x) = (2x)/√2 = √2 x.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at any point (x,y) is √2 x.\n\nThe slope of the line connecting the origin (0,0) to the point (x,y) is (y - 0)/(x -0) = y/x = [(1/√2)(x² -3)] / x = (x² -3)/(x√2).\n\nFor the line from the origin to the point (x,y) to be perpendicular to the tangent line at (x,y), their slopes must multiply to -1.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[ (x² -3)/(x√2) ] * [ √2 x ] = -1\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nMultiply the two slopes:\n\n[(x² -3)/(x√2)] * [√2 x] = [(x² -3) * √2 x ] / (x√2) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe √2 cancels, the x cancels, so we get (x² -3) = -1\n\nTherefore, x² -3 = -1 => x² = 2 => x = ±√2\n\nWhich is exactly the critical points we found earlier.
