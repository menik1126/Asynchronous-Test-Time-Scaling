            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Hmm, that sounds like a distance minimization problem. I remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0) can be calculated using the distance formula, which is sqrt(x² + y²). So, in this case, the distance D from the origin to a point (x, y) on the graph would be D = sqrt(x² + y²).\n\nBut since y is given in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula. So let me write that out:\n\nD = sqrt(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²)\n\nI think it would be easier to work with the square of the distance to avoid dealing with the square root in the equation. So, let's square both sides:\n\nD² = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²\n\nLet me compute the second term. Squaring (1/√2) gives me 1/2, and squaring (x² - 3) gives (x² - 3)². So,\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)²\n\nNow, I need to expand (x² - 3)². That would be x⁴ - 6x² + 9. So plugging that back in:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9)\n\nLet me distribute the 1/2:\n\nD² = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + (9/2)\n\nCombine like terms. So x² - 3x² is -2x²:\n\nD² = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nHmm, this looks like a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can set u = x² to make it easier. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet u = x², so D² becomes:\n\nD² = (1/2)u² - 2u + 9/2\n\nNow, I need to minimize D² with respect to u. Since D² is a quadratic function, the minimum"

            "output": " occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The quadratic is in the form au² + bu + c, so the vertex is at u = -b/(2a).\n\nHere, a = 1/2 and b = -2. Plugging into the formula:\n\nu = -(-2)/(2*(1/2)) = 2/(1) = 2\n\nSo, the minimum occurs at u = 2. That means x² = 2, so x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2).\n\nNow, let's plug u = 2 back into the expression for D² to find the minimum distance squared.\n\nD² = (1/2)(2)² - 2*(2) + 9/2\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(1/2)(4) = 2\n\n-2*(2) = -4\n\nSo, 2 - 4 + 9/2 = (-2) + 9/2 = ( -4/2 + 9/2 ) = 5/2\n\nTherefore, D² = 5/2, so D = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2\n\nWait, is sqrt(5/2) equal to sqrt(10)/2? Let me check. Yes, because sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) = sqrt(10)/2. So that's correct.\n\nBut the question says the smallest distance can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. So, I have D = sqrt(10)/2. Here, a is 10 and b is 2. Now, 10 is 2*5, which is square-free, so a =10, b=2.\n\nTherefore, a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculation. Let me recap.\n\nWe started with y = (1/√2)(x² - 3)\n\nThen, D² = x² + y² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)^2\n\nExpanding that, D² becomes (1/2)x⁴"
