            "output": "First, I need to determine the prime factorization of 196. I start by recognizing that 196 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. Repeating the process, I divide 98 by 2 to get 49. Since 49 is not divisible by 2, I move to the next prime number, which is 7. Dividing 49 by 7 yields 7, and dividing 7 by 7 results in 1. This means the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared, 7 squared, and 7 cubed.\n\nNext, I calculate the number of divisors by adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying these values together. For the prime factor 2, the exponent is 2, so adding 1 gives me 3. For the prime factor 7, the exponent is 3, so adding 1 results in 4. Multiplying these together, 3 times 4 equals 12. Therefore, 196 has 12 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors \\(196\\) has, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - \\(196\\) is even, so it's divisible by \\(2\\):\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   - Repeat the division by \\(2\\) for \\(98\\):\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   - Now, \\(49\\) is not divisible by \\(2\\), so we move to the next prime number, which is \\(7\\):\n     \\[\n     49 \\div 7 = 7\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     7 \\div 7 = 1\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the prime factors of \\(196\\) are:\n     \\[\n     196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Divisors**:\n   - If a number \\(N\\) has the prime factorization \\(N = p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{c}\\), the total number of positive divisors is:\n     \\[\n     (a + 1"
