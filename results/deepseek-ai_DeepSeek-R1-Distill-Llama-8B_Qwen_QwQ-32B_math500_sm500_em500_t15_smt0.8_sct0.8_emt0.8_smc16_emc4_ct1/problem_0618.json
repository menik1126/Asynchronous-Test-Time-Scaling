            "output": "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, I'll start by finding its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I notice that 196 is divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives 98.\n\nNext, I divide 98 by 2 again to get 49, which is no longer divisible by 2. I'll move on to the next prime number, which is 3.\n\nHowever, 49 divided by 3 does not result in a whole number. I'll skip to the next prime number, which is 7.\n\nFinally, dividing 49 by 7 yields 7. I'll divide 7 by 7 to obtain 1, completing the factorization.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared, 7 cubed, and 2 squared multiplied by 7 cubed (which simplifies to 14 squared).\n\nUsing the formula for the number of divisors, if a number N has a prime factorization in the form of \\( p_1^a \\times p_2^b \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^k \\), then the number of divisors is \\( (a+1)(b+1)\\ldots(k+1) \\).\n\nApplying this to 196, which is \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\), the number of divisors is \\( (2+1)(2+1) = 9 \\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 196**\n   \n   - **196 ÷ 2 = 98**\n   - **98 ÷ 2 = 49**\n   - **49 ÷ 7 = 7**\n   - **7 ÷ 7 = 1**\n\n   So, the prime factors of 196 are:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Divisor Formula**\n   \n   If a number \\( N \\) has a prime factorization \\( p_1^a \\times p_2^b \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^k \\), the total number of positive divisors is:\n   \\[\n   (a+1)(b+1)\\"
