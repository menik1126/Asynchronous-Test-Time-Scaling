            "output": "First, I need to determine how many options there are for the first part of the license plate. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and since they want 2 different letters, I can choose from 26 for the first letter and 25 for the second. \n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of possible combinations for the letters. This is done using the multiplication principle: 26 options for the first letter multiplied by 25 options for the second letter. So, 26 * 25 = 650 possible combinations for the letters part.\n\nNow, moving on to the numbers part of the license plate. Each number can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible options for each of the two digits. Since the numbers must also be different, the first number has 10 options, and the second has 9 remaining options.\n\nApplying the multiplication principle again for the numbers: 10 * 9 = 90 possible combinations for the numbers part.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of unique license plates, I need to combine the letter combinations with the number combinations. That's done by multiplying the two results: 650 * 90 = 58,500 possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break the problem into two parts: the letters and the numbers. \n\n1. **Letters (A-Z):**\n   - **First character:** There are 26 letters to choose from.\n   - **Second character:** After choosing the first letter, there are 25 remaining letters to choose from.\n   \n   **Total letter combinations:** \n   \\[\n   26 \\times 25 = 650\n   \\]\n\n2. **Numbers (0-9):**\n   - **First character:** There are 10 digits to choose from.\n   - **Second character:** After choosing the first digit, there are 9 remaining digits to choose from.\n   \n   **Total number combinations:** \n   \\[\n   10 \\times 9 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total license plate combinations:**\n   Combine the letter and number combinations.\n   \\[\n   650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n   \\]\n\n\\(\\boxed{58,\\!500}\\)"
