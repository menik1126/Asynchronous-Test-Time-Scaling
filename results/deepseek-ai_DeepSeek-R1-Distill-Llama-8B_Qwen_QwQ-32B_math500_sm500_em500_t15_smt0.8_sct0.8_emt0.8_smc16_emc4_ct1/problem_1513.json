Since the letters must be different, the number of possible combinations for the letters is the number of ways to choose two distinct letters from 26, which is calculated using the permutation formula. This gives us 26 × 25 possible combinations for the letters.\n\nNext, there are two digits, and each digit can be any of the 10 digits (0 through 9). Similar to the letters, the digits must also be different. Therefore, the number of possible combinations for the digits is also calculated using the permutation formula, resulting in 10 × 9 possible combinations for the digits.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of possible license plates, I multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of possible digit combinations. This means multiplying 26 × 25 by 10 × 9, which gives the total number of unique license plates that can be formed under the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we need to consider the number of choices for each part of the plate.\n\n1. **Letters:**\n   - There are 26 possible letters (A-Z).\n   - Since the letters must be **different**, the number of ways to choose two different letters is:\n     \\[\n     26 \\times 25 = 650\n     \\]\n\n2. **Digits:**\n   - There are 10 possible digits (0-9).\n   - Since the digits must also be **different**, the number of ways to choose two different digits is:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Combinations:**\n   - To find the total number of possible license plates, multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations:\n     \\[\n     650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
