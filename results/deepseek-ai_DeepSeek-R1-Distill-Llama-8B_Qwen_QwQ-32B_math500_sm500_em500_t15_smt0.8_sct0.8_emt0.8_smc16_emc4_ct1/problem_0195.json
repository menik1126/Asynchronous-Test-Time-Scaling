Hmm, let's start by recalling that integer roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients must divide the constant term, right? So in this case, the constant term is -14. That means possible integer roots are the divisors of 14, which are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14.\n\nAlright, so the possible candidates are 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, and -14. I need to test each of these values in the polynomial to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet me start with x = 1.\n\nPlugging in x=1: \\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\). Calculating each term: 1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14. That's 1 +5=6, 6+9=15, 15-1=14, 14-14=0. Oh, wow, so x=1 is a root. That's one down.\n\nNext, let me try x=-1.\n\nPlugging in x=-1: \\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14\\). Calculating: 1 + (-5) + 9 +1 -14. Let's add this up: 1-5= -4, -4+9=5, 5+1=6, 6-14= -8. Not zero, so x=-1 isn't a root.\n\nMoving on to x=2.\n\nPlugging x=2: \\(16 + 5(8) + 9(4) - 2 -14\\). Calculating: 16 +40=56, 56 +36=92, 92 -2=90, 90-14=76. Nope, not zero. So x=2 isn't a root.\n\nHow about x=-2.\n\nPlugging x=-2: \\(16 + 5(-8) + 9(4) - (-2) -14\\). Breaking it down: 16 -40= -24, -24 +36"

Calculating step by step: 7^4 is 2401, 5*(343)=1715, 9*(49)=441, so adding them up: 2401 +1715=4116, 4116+441=4557. Now subtract 7 and 14: 4557-7=4550, 4550-14=4536. Definitely not zero, so x=7 isn't a root.\n\nHow about x=-7.\n\nPlugging x=-7: \\((-7)^4 +5(-7)^3 +9(-7)^2 -(-7) -14\\). Calculating: 2401 +5*(-343)=2401 -1715=686, 686 + 9*(49)=686 +441=1127, 1127 +7=1134, 1134 -14=1120. Not zero, so x=-7 isn't a root.\n\nNext, x=14 seems too big, but let's check.\n\nPlugging x=14: \\(14^4 +5(14)^3 +9(14)^2 -14 -14\\). 14^4 is 14*14=196, 196*14=2744, 2744*14=38416. Then 5*(14)^3=5*(2744)=13720. 9*(14)^2=9*196=1764. So adding all these: 38416 +13720=52136, 52136 +1764=538, 538... wait, 52136 +1764=538, 538... no, wait, 52136 +1764 is 52136 +1000=53136, 53136 +764=538, 538... wait, that's not right. Wait, 52136 +1764: 52136 +1000=53136, 53136 +700=53836, 53836 +64=538, wait no, 53836 +64 is 53900. Hmm,"

So 53900 -14 -14=53892. Definitely not zero. So x=14 isn't a root.\n\nHow about x=-14. That's going to be a huge number, but let's see.\n\nPlugging x=-14: \\((-14)^4 +5*(-14)^3 +9*(-14)^2 -(-14) -14\\). Calculating each term: (-14)^4 is 14^4=38416. 5*(-14)^3=5*(-2744)= -13720. 9*(196)=1764. Now, adding them up: 38416 -13720=24696, 24696 +1764=26460. Then, subtracting (-14) is adding 14: 26460 +14=26474, minus 14=26460. Not zero, so x=-14 isn't a root.\n\nSo from the possible candidates, x=1 and x=-2 are roots. But wait, since it's a quartic equation, there should be four roots (real or complex). But since we are looking for integer roots, we have two so far. Maybe I missed something?\n\nWait, actually, for integer roots, the possible roots can be divisors of the constant term, so -14, but we considered all. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in testing x=7 or something. Let me double-check x=7.\n\nx=7: \\(7^4 +5*7^3 +9*7^2 -7 -14\\). 7^4: 7^2=49, 49^2=2401. 5*7^3: 7^3=343, so 5*343=1715. 9*7^2=9*49=441.

Not a root.\n\nWait, so maybe there's another approach. Since we found two roots, x=1 and x=-2, perhaps we can factor them out and reduce the polynomial.\n\nLet's try polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nStarting with x=1: using synthetic division.\n\nSet up the coefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14.\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1*1=1, add to next coefficient:5+1=6.\n\nMultiply 6*1=6, add to 9:15.\n\nMultiply15*1=15, add to -1:14.\n\nMultiply14*1=14, add to -14:0. Perfect, so we have (x-1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic polynomial: x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14.\n\nLet me attempt to factor this. Trying possible roots again: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nTesting x=1:1 +6 +15 +14=36≠0.\n\nTesting x=-1: -1 +6 -15 +14=4≠0.\n\nTesting x=-2: -8 +24 -30 +14=0. Let's see: -8+24=16, 16-30=-14, -14+14=0. So x=-2 is a root.\n\nSo we can factor the cubic as (x+2)(quadratic). Let's use synthetic division on the cubic.\n\nCoefficients:1 (x^3),6 (x^2),15 (x),14.\n\nUsing x=-2:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1*(-2)=-2. Add to 6:4.\n\nMultiply4*(-2)=-8. Add to15:7.\n\nMultiply7*(-2)=-14. Add to14:0. So it factors as (x+2)("
