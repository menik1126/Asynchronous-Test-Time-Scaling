            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, integer roots... That means I'm looking for whole numbers, positive or negative, that satisfy this equation when plugged in for x. \n\nFirst, I remember something called the Rational Root Theorem. I think it can help me figure out possible candidates for roots. The theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So that simplifies things because if q is 1, then all possible rational roots are just the factors of -14. \n\nSo, the factors of -14 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, and \u00b114. That gives me a list of possible integer roots: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14. \n\nNow, I can test each of these to see if they satisfy the equation. Let me start with x=1:\n\nPlugging in 1: \\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\)\nCalculates to: 1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14 = (1+5) + (9-1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0. \n\nOh, wow, x=1 is a root! So, (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial.\n\nBut wait, since the polynomial is of degree 4, it might factor into lower-degree polynomials. Maybe (x - 1) times a cubic? Let me try polynomial division or synthetic division to find the other factors.\n\nLet me use synthetic division with root 1. So, set up the coefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 1, get 1. Add to next coefficient: 5 +1 =6.\n\nMultiply 6 by1 =6. Add to next coefficient:9+6"

Add to last coefficient: -14 +14=0.\n\nSo, after division, the cubic polynomial is \\(x^3 + 6x^2 +15x +14\\). So, the original polynomial factors as (x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, I need to factor the cubic. Maybe I can apply the Rational Root Theorem again on this cubic. The constant term is 14, and leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nLet me test x=-2 first because sometimes negative numbers can be roots:\n\nPlugging in x=-2: (-2)^3 +6*(-2)^2 +15*(-2) +14.\n\nCalculates to: -8 + 6*4 + (-30) +14 = -8 +24 -30 +14.\n\nAdding up: (-8 +24)=16, (16 -30)=-14, (-14 +14)=0. Yup, x=-2 is a root. So, (x +2) is a factor.\n\nNow, let's perform synthetic division on the cubic with root -2.\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^3), 6 (x^2),15 (x),14.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2. Add to 6: 4.\n\nMultiply 4 by -2: -8. Add to 15:7.\n\nMultiply 7 by -2: -14. Add to 14: 0.\n\nSo, the quadratic is x^2 +4x +7.\n\nWait, so now the polynomial is factored as (x-1)(x+2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, we're left with the quadratic: x^2 +4x +7. Let's see if it has real roots. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = 16 -28 = -12. Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots, let alone integer roots. So, the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I made any mistakes. Maybe I should test another root. Let's try x"

Not zero, so not a root.\n\nHow about x=7? That seems big, but let's check.\n\n7^4 is 2401, 5*7^3=5*343=1715, 9*49=441, -7, -14.\n\nAdding up: 2401 +1715=4116, 4116 +441=4557, 4557 -7=4550, 4550 -14=4536. Definitely not zero.\n\nx=-1: (-1)^4 is 1, 5*(-1)^3 is -5, 9*(-1)^2 is 9, -(-1)=1, -14.\n\nAdding up: 1 -5 = -4, +9 =5, +1=6, -14=-8.

Not zero.\n\nx=14 is going to be too big, let's skip that.\n\nWait, so from the synthetic division, the only integer roots were 1 and -2. Did I miss something? Let me check if x=2 is a root of the original equation. Wait, plugging x=2: 16 + 40 + 36 -2 -14= 16+40=56, 56+36=92, 92-2=90, 90-14=76\u22600. So no.\n\nSimilarly, x= -2 was a root.\n\nWhat about x= -14? That seems too big and negative, but let's see"

Not zero.\n\nSo, no. It seems that the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2. Let me just confirm once more.\n\nWait, did I do the synthetic division correctly for the cubic? Let me check the cubic polynomial after dividing by (x - 1):\n\nOriginal cubic: x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14.\n\nDivided by (x +2). Using synthetic division:\n\n-2 | 1 \u00a0 6 \u00a0 15 \u00a0 14\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -2 \u00a0 -8 \u00a0 -14\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 ---------------------\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1 \u00a0 4 \u00a0 \u00a07 \u00a0 \u00a00\n\nYes, that's correct. So the quadratic is x^2 +4x +7, which has no real roots.\n\nSo, the integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nI think that's all. Let me see if I can factor the original polynomial further, but since the quadratic doesn't factor over integers, that's it. So, the integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n</think>\n\nTo find all integer roots of the equation \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\), we apply the Rational Root Theorem. The possible integer roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114. Testing these, we find that \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\) are roots.
