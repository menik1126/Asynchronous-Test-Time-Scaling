Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the expression looks like. The numerator is x - y, and the denominator is x^4 + y^4 + 6. Both x and y can be any real numbers, positive or negative. Since the denominator is always positive (because x^4 and y^4 are non-negative, and adding 6 makes it at least 6), the whole expression will have the sign of the numerator, which is x - y. So, the expression can be positive or negative depending on whether x is greater than y or not. But since we are looking for the maximum value, I think we should focus on when the expression is positive. That is, when x > y.\n\nNow, to find the maximum value, maybe I can try to set up some kind of optimization problem. I know that in calculus, to find maxima or minima, we can take partial derivatives with respect to each variable and set them to zero. That should give us the critical points which could be maxima or minima.\n\nLet me denote the function as f(x, y) = (x - y)/(x^4 + y^4 + 6). To find its maximum, I need to compute the partial derivatives \u2202f/\u2202x and \u2202f/\u2202y, set them equal to zero, and solve the resulting system of equations.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u2202f/\u2202x. Using the quotient rule, which is (denominator * derivative of numerator - numerator * derivative of denominator) divided by denominator squared.\n\nSo, for \u2202f/\u2202x:\nNumerator derivative: 1\nDenominator derivative: 4x^3\nSo,\n\u2202f/\u2202x = [ (x^4 + y^4 + 6) * 1 - (x - y) * 4x^3 ] / (x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2\n\nSimilarly, for \u2202f/\u2202y:\nNumerator derivative: -1\nDenominator derivative: 4y^3\nSo,\n\u2202f/\ufffd"

So, all critical points must satisfy one of these two conditions. Therefore, the only critical points are either along x=y (which gives zero) or along y=-x (which gives the function g(x)=x/(x^4 +3)), so the maximum is indeed 1/4.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities.

For example, suppose if x and y are such that x^4 + y^4 is very small? Wait, but the denominator is x^4 + y^4 +6, so making x^4 + y^4 small would make denominator as small as possible, but the numerator is x - y. So perhaps if x is large and y is small, the numerator could be large, but the denominator is x^4 which would dominate. So as x or y go to infinity, the function tends to zero, because numerator is x - y while denominator is x^4 + y^4 +6, which grows much faster.\n\nSo, the function likely achieves its maximum somewhere finite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution.\n\nLet me suppose that t = y/x, assuming x\u22600. Then y = t x.\n\nSo then, the function becomes:\n\n(x - t x)/(x^4 + (t x)^4 +6)= x(1 - t)/(x^4 + t^4 x^4 +6)= x(1 - t)/(x^4(1 + t^4) +6)\n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, let me set t = x - y.

Since the denominator is x^4 times something plus 6, to maximize f(x, y), for a given k, I can choose x that maximizes this.\n\nBut this seems a bit complex.

Let me think.\n\nWe can consider maximizing f(x,y) = (x - y) subject to the constraint g(x,y) = x^4 + y^4 +6 = constant. Wait, but since the denominator is in the expression, maybe it's better to set up the problem as maximizing (x - y) while minimizing the denominator. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function f(x,y) = (x - y)/(x^4 + y^4 +6). To maximize this, perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers where we set the gradient of f equal to zero. Wait, that's essentially what I did with partial derivatives earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider substituting variables such that u = x - y and v = x + y or something else. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider symmetry. Let me see, if I set variables such that x = a and y = -b, then the numerator becomes a + b, and the denominator is a^4 + b^4 +6. So, the function becomes (a + b)/(a^4 + b^4 +6). Maybe this is easier to handle?\n\nWait, but that substitution is similar to the case when y = -x, but here a and b are independent variables. Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the maximum occurs when x and y are related in some way. For instance, in the case when y = -x, we found a critical point.

Suppose x and y are such that y = -x, but with x different from 1. For example, x= sqrt(1), so x=1, which is the case we already considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where x and y are not related by y = -x, but still gives a higher value?\n\nWait, according to the equations from the partial derivatives, all critical points must satisfy either x=y or y=-x, so there are no other critical points. Therefore, the maximum must be at one of these points, and since the maximum among them is 1/4, that's the answer.\n\nTherefore, after all these considerations, I think the maximum value is 1/4, achieved at x=1, y=-1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the maximum value of the expression \\(\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\) over all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we start by considering the function \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\).\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and set them to zero to find critical points. Using the quotient rule, we find:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - 4x^3(x - y)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{-(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - 4y^3(x - y)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSetting these partial derivatives to zero, we derive the system of equations:\n1. \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6 - 4x^3(x - y) = 0\\"
