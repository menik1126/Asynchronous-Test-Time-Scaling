Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the function looks like. The numerator is \\(x - y\\), which suggests that if I increase \\(x\\) while keeping \\(y\\) fixed, the numerator becomes larger. On the other hand, the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\), which grows very quickly as \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) get large in absolute value. So, this function might have some maximum somewhere, maybe not at infinity.\n\nSince the denominator is always positive (because \\(x^4\\) and \\(y^4\\) are always non-negative, and we add 6), the function is defined for all real numbers. But I need to find the maximum value. Maybe I can use calculus to find critical points.\n\nLet me consider \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). To find its maximum, I should find the partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and set them equal to zero.\n\nFirst, the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{(-1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4y^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nTo find critical points, set both partial derivatives equal to zero. So,\n\n1. \\( (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - 4x^3(x - y) = 0 \\)\n2. \\( - (x^4 + y^4 + 6) - 4y^3(x - y) = 0 \\)\n\nLet me write these down clearly:\n\n1. \\(x"

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\):\n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1:\n\n\\[\n[ x^4 + y^4 + 6 + 4y^3(x - y) ] - [ x^4 + y^4 + 6 - 4x^3(x - y) ] = 0 - 0\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\n\\(4y^3(x - y) - (-4x^3(x - y)) = 0\\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\(4y^3(x - y) + 4x^3(x - y) = 0\\)\n\nFactor out \\(4(x - y)\\):\n\n\\(4(x - y)(y^3 + x^3) = 0\\)\n\nSo, either \\(x - y = 0\\) or \\(y^3 + x^3 = 0\\).\n\nCase 1: \\(x - y = 0\\) => \\(x = y\\)\n\nIf \\(x = y\\), then the original function becomes:\n\n\\(\\frac{0}{2x^4 + 6}\\) which is 0.
