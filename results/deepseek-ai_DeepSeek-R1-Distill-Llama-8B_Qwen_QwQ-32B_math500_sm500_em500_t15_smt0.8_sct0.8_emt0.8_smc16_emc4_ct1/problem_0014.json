            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about polynomials. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nThe problem says: Let \\( P(x) \\) be a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So, the polynomial looks like \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are coefficients we need to find.\n\nIt also mentions two things about the remainders when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by certain quadratic polynomials. First, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). Second, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). I think this means that \\( R(x) \\) is also a polynomial, and its degree should be less than 2 since it's the remainder of a division by a quadratic. So, \\( R(x) \\) must be a linear polynomial, right? So, let's denote \\( R(x) = dx + e \\) where \\( d \\) and \\( e \\) are constants.\n\nGiven that \\( P(x) \\) is monic and of degree 3, when we divide it by a quadratic, the remainder should be of degree less than 2, which we've established as \\( R(x) \\). \n\nAnother piece of information given is \\( P(0) = 5 \\). Since \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\), plugging in \\( x = 0 \\) gives \\( P(0) = c = 5 \\). So, we know \\( c = 5 \\). That's one constant found.\n\nNow, let's think about the division by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\). When a polynomial is divided by a quadratic, the remainder can be expressed as \\( R(x) \\). By the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by a linear polynomial \\( (x - k) \\) is \\( P(k) \\). But here, we're dividing by a quadratic, so the remainder is of"

Therefore, the remainder \\( R(x) \\) can be written as \\( R(x) = P(x) - (x - 1)(x - 4)Q(x) \\) where \\( Q(x) \\) is the quotient polynomial.\n\nBut wait, since we don't know \\( Q(x) \\), maybe it's better to evaluate \\( P(x) \\) at the roots of the quadratic, which are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\), because \\( P(1) = R(1) \\) and \\( P(4) = R(4) \\).\n\nYes, that's right. So, \\( P(1) = R(1) \\) and \\( P(4) = R(4) \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). So, following a similar logic, evaluating \\( P(x) \\) at \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\) should give us \\( 2R(2) \\) and \\( 2R(3) \\) respectively.\n\nSo, let me write these down:\n\n1. \\( P(1) = R(1) \\)\n2. \\( P(4) = R(4) \\)\n3. \\( P(2) = 2R(2) \\)\n4. \\( P(3) = 2R(3) \\)\n\nSince \\( R(x) = dx + e \\), we can write:\n\n- \\( R(1) = d(1) + e = d + e \\)\n- \\( R(4) = d(4) + e = 4d + e \\)\n- \\( R(2) = 2d + e \\)\n- \\( R(3) = 3d + e \\)\n\nSo, substituting back into points 1-4:\n\n1. \\( P(1) = d + e \\)\n2. \\( P(4) = 4d + e \\)\n3. \\( P(2) = 2(2d + e) = 4d + 2e \\)\n4. \\( P(3) = 2(3d + e) = 6d + "
