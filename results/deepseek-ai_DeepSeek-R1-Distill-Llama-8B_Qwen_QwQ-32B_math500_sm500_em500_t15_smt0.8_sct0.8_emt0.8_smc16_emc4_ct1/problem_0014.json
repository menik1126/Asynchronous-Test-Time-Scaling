            "output": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. It's about polynomials, specifically a cubic one, and some remainders when it's divided by certain quadratic factors. Hmm, okay, let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So, we can write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + c\n\nWhere a, b, c are constants that we need to find. We also know that P(0) = 5. Since P(0) is the constant term, that tells us c = 5. So, now we have:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + 5\n\nNext, the problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). \n\nI remember from the Remainder Theorem that if a polynomial P(x) is divided by a linear divisor (x - k), the remainder is P(k). But here, the divisors are quadratic, so we need to use a generalized version of the Remainder Theorem or maybe polynomial division.\n\nI think that when dividing by a quadratic polynomial, say (x - m)(x - n), the remainder will be a linear polynomial, R(x) = d x + e. Because the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor. So, in both cases, R(x) will be of degree 1.\n\nSo, let's denote R(x) as:\n\nR(x) = m x + n\n\nNow, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). That means:\n\nP(1) = R(1)\nP(4) = R(4)\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So:\n\nP(2) = 2R(2)\nP(3) = 2R(3)\n\nThis gives us four equations:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4)"

P(2) = 2*(m*2 + n) = 4m + 2n\n4. P(3) = 2*(m*3 + n) = 6m + 2n\n\nSo, we have four equations. Let's write them down using our expression for P(x):\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + a x\u00b2 + b x + 5\n\nSo:\n\n1. P(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = 6 + a + b\n   This equals m + n.\n\n2. P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 69 + 16a + 4b\n   This equals 4m + n.\n\n3.
