This means I'll multiply both sides of the equation by (x - 5) and by 3.\n\nAfter cross-multiplying, the equation becomes 2 times (x - 5) equals 12.\n\nNext, I'll distribute the 2 on the left side, which gives me 2x minus 10 equals 12.\n\nThen, I'll isolate the term with x by adding 10 to both sides, resulting in 2x equals 22.\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for x, which gives x equals 11.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x-5} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiply** to eliminate the fractions:\n   \\[\n   2(x - 5) = 3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Distribute** the 2 on the left side:\n   \\[\n   2x - 10 = 12\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Isolate** the term with \\( x \\) by adding 10 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x = 12 + 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 22\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve** for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{22}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 11\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
