Setting \\(2n - 1 = 199\\), I solve for \\(n\\) and find that there are 100 terms in this series.\n\nNext, I recall that the sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is given by the formula \\(n^2\\). Therefore, the sum of 100 odd numbers is \\(100^2 = 10,000\\).\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I perform the division and calculate \\(10,000 \\mod 7 = 1\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Sequence\nThe given series is a sequence of consecutive odd numbers starting from \\(1\\) and ending at \\(199\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Terms\nThe \\(n\\)-th odd number is given by:\n\\[\n2n - 1\n\\]\nSetting \\(2n - 1 = 199\\):\n\\[\n2n = 200 \\Rightarrow n = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are **100 terms** in this sequence.\n\n### Step 3: Sum of the First \\(n\\) Odd Numbers\nThe sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is a well-known formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = n^2\n\\]\nTherefore, the sum of the first 100 odd numbers is:\n\\[\n100^2 = 10,000\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Modulo \\(7\\) of the Sum\nNow, we need to find \\(10,000 \\mod 7\\), which is the remainder when \\(10,000\\) is divided by \\(7\\).\n\nLet's perform the division:\n\\[\n10,000 \\div 7 = 1,428 \\text{ with a remainder of } 2\n\\]\nWait, let's correct that.

Let me recalculate carefully:\n\nAlternatively, break down \\(10,000\\) as \\(10^4\\). Since \\(10 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\), then:\n\\[\n10^4 \\equiv 3^4 \\mod 7\n\\]\nCalculate \\(3^4\\):\n\\[\n3^2 = 9 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7 \\Rightarrow 3^4 = (3^2)^2 \\equiv 2^2 = 4 \\mod 7\n\\]\nThus, \\(10^4 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\), so the remainder is \\(4\\).\n\nWait, but this contradicts my initial division approach. Let me check division again:\n\n\\(7 \\times 1,428 = 9,996\\). Then \\(10,000 - 9,996 = 4\\). So remainder is indeed 4. So my first division approach was correct, but my initial thought of remainder 1 was wrong. The correct remainder is 4.\n\nWait, but where did I get 1 before? Maybe miscalculation. Let me confirm again:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula step. Let me retrace all steps.\n\nWait, the problem is the sum is 100^2 = 10,000. Then 10,000 divided by 7:\n\n7 × 1,428 = 9,996. 10,000 - 9,996 = 4. So remainder is 4. Therefore, the correct remainder is 4. So my first step had an error in the remainder calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using modular arithmetic:\n\n100 mod 7: 100 divided by 7 is 14×7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7. Then 100^2 mod7 = (2)^2 mod7 = 4 mod7. So that also gives "
