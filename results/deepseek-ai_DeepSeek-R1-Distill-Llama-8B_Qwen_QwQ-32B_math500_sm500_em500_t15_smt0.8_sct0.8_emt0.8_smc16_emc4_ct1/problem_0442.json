Since it's an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\( a = 1 \\) and a common difference of 2, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \\( a_n = a + (n - 1)d \\). Setting \\( a_n = 199 \\) and \\( d = 2 \\), I solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\( 199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\)\n\n\\( 199 - 1 = 2n - 2 \\)\n\n\\( 198 = 2n - 2 \\)\n\n\\( 200 = 2n \\)\n\n\\( n = 100 \\)\n\nSo, there are 100 terms in the sequence.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of the first 100 terms of this arithmetic sequence using the formula \\( S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) \\):\n\n\\( S_{100} = \\frac{100}{2} \\times (1 + 199) = 50 \\times 200 = 10,000 \\)\n\nNow, I need to find \\( 10,000 \\mod 7 \\).
