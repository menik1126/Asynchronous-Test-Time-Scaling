            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD, given this equation involving fractions. Let me see how to approach this. \n\nFirst, the equation is \\(\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\). I know that for this equation to hold for all real values of x except -8 and 3 (because those would make the denominators zero), the left side must simplify to the right side. \n\nHmm, so I think I should combine the fractions on the left side into a single fraction. To add them, I need a common denominator. The denominators are \\(x - 3\\) and \\(x + 8\\), so the common denominator would be their product, which is \\((x - 3)(x + 8)\\). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, rewriting both fractions with the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait, the denominator on the right side is \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). Maybe I can factor that to see if it's related to the common denominator I just found. Let me factor it:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 5... Hmm, 8 and -3. Yes, because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, it factors into \\((x + 8)(x - 3)\\), which matches the common denominator. Great, that means both sides have the same denominator now. \n\nSo, combining the numerators on the left:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are equal, the numerators must be equal for all x (except -8 and 3). So, I can write:\n\n\\[\nC(x + "

The x terms and the constant terms separately:\n\nFor x terms: \\(C + D\\)\nFor constant terms: \\(8C - 3D\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, for these two expressions to be equal for all x, their coefficients must be equal. That means:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: \\(C + D = 4\\)\n2. Constant term: \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nSo now, I have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\nEquation 1: \\(C + D = 4\\)\n\nEquation 2: \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nI need to solve for C and D. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nFrom Equation 1, I can express C as \\(C = 4 - D\\). Then substitute this into Equation 2.\n\nSubstituting into Equation 2:\n\n\\(8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\\)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\(32 - 8D - 3D = -23\\)\n\nCombine the D terms:\n\n\\(32 - 11D = -23\\)\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n\\(-11D = -23 - 32\\)\n\n\\(-11D = -55\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\n\\(D = \\frac{-55}{-11} = 5\\)\n\nSo, D is 5. Now, substitute back into Equation 1:\n\n\\(C + 5 = 4\\)\n\nSo, \\(C = 4 - 5 = -1\\)\n\nTherefore, C is -1 and D is 5. Now, the question asks for the product CD.\n\nCD = (-1) * 5 = -5\n\nWait, let me double-check to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me plug C = -1 and D = 5 back into the original equation to see if it holds.\n\nLeft side:\n\n\\"
