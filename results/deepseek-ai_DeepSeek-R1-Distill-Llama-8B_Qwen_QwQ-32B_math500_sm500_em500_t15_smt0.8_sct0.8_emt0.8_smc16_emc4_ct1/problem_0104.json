            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the product CD where C and D are integers. The equation given is a sum of two fractions on the left side, and a single fraction on the right. It says that this equality holds for all real x except x = -8 and x = 3. Hmm, I remember that when you have an equation like this, where two rational expressions are equal for all x except certain values, the numerators and denominators must be proportional. So, maybe I can use partial fractions to solve for C and D.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nI notice that the denominator on the right side is a quadratic, so I should factor it to make sure it matches the denominators on the left. Let me try factoring x² + 5x -24. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to +5. Hmm, 8 and -3 work because 8*(-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, the denominator factors as:\n\nx² + 5x -24 = (x + 8)(x - 3)\n\nThat's good because now the left side has denominators (x - 3) and (x + 8), which match. So, perhaps I can combine the left side into a single fraction and compare it to the right side.\n\nTo combine the fractions on the left, I need a common denominator, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). So, I'll rewrite each fraction with this common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, since the denominators are the same, I can set the numerators equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nLet me"

Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I need to solve this system for C and D. Let's write them out:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Let me solve Equation 1 for C:\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 2:\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nCompute 8*(4 - D):\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 -32 = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo, D = 5. Now, substitute back into Equation 1:\n\nC + 5 = 4 => C = 4 -5 = -1\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nTherefore, the product CD is (-1)*(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me verify if I did everything correctly.\n\nStarting with the numerators:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = (-1)(x + 8) + 5(x -3) = -x -8 +5x -15 = ( -x +5x ) + ( -8 -15 ) = 4x -23, which matches the right side. Yay, that's correct.\n\nSo, the product CD is -5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), we start by expressing the given equation with a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = "
