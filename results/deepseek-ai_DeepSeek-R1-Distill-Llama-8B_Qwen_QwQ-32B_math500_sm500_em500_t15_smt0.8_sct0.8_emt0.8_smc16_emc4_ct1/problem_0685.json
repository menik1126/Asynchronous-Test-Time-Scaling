Therefore, the number of players \\( x \\) must satisfy the equation:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{54}{y} \\)\n\nGiven that \\( x \\) is at least 2 and \\( y \\) is at least 5, I need to identify all possible integer values of \\( y \\) that result in \\( x \\) being an integer and meeting the minimum requirements. This means \\( y \\) must be a divisor of 54 and satisfy:\n\n\\( y \\geq 5 \\) and \\( \\frac{54}{y} \\geq 2 \\)\n\nNext, I list all the divisors of 54 that are equal to or greater than 5 and ensure that \\( x = \\frac{54}{y} \\) is also an integer. The divisors of 54 are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n\nFrom this list, the values of \\( y \\) that meet the criteria are:\n\n6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n\nThese correspond to the following values of \\( x \\):\n\nFor \\( y = 6 \\), \\( x = 9 \\)\nFor \\( y = 9 \\), \\( x = 6 \\)\nFor \\( y = 18 \\), \\( x = 3 \\)\nFor \\( y = 27 \\), \\( x = 2 \\)\nFor \\( y = 54 \\), \\( x = 1 \\) (but \\( x \\) must be at least 2, so this value is excluded)\n\nFinally, the valid values of \\( x \\) based on the constraints are \\( x = 3, 6, 9 \\).\n\nThus, there are 3 possible values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the given conditions.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nI have a deck of **54** cards, and I deal all of the cards to **\\( x \\)** players, with each player getting **\\( y \\)** cards.
