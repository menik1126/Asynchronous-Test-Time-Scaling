Let me recalculate the speed conversion properly.\n\nWait, 0.4 km/h is 0.4 * 1000 m / 3600 s = 400/3600 = 0.1111 m/s. Then 0.1111 m/s * 90 s = 9.999 meters, which is approximately 10 meters. But that contradicts my previous step. Wait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem again.\n\nWait, the first step: 1 km in 2.5 hours. So speed is 1/2.5 km/h = 0.4 km/h. Converting to m/s:\n\n0.4 km/h = 0.4 * 1000 m / 3600 s = 400/3600 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111 m/s.\n\nThen, time is 90 seconds. So distance is speed * time = (1/9) * 90 = 10 meters.\n\nWait, but the user's initial thought had 250 meters. Hmm, so there must be a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer\". So speed is 1 km / 2.5 hours = 0.4 km/h. That's correct.\n\nConverting to m/s: 0.4 km/h = 0.4 * 1000 m / 3600 s = 400/3600 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111 m/s. Correct.\n\nThen, time is 90 seconds.

To convert to m/min, multiply by 1000: 1000/900 ≈ 1.111 m/min.\n\nThen, in 90 seconds (which is 1.5 minutes), the distance is 1.111 m/min * 1.5 min = 1.6665 meters, which is approximately 1.6665 meters. That's even shorter. This is conflicting with the initial thought of 250 meters.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\n\"A robot moving forward at a constant speed takes 2.5 hours to travel 1 kilometer. Moving forward at this same constant speed, it takes the robot 90 seconds to travel the length of a particular hallway. How many meters long is the hallway?\"\n\nWait, so 2.5 hours for 1 km.

Let's see:\n\nIf the robot travels 1 km in 2.5 hours, the speed is 1 / 2.5 = 0.4 km/h. That is correct.\n\nBut in the initial thought, they wrote 1 km in 2.5 hours: speed is 0.4 km/h.

The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours, so its speed is 1 km per 2.5 hours.\n\nNext, I'll convert the speed to meters per second to match the hallway's time measurement. Since 1 hour is 3600 seconds, the speed becomes 1 km / 3600 seconds, which is approximately 0.0002778 km/s or 2.778 m/s.\"\n\nWait, here is the mistake. The user incorrectly converted 1 km per 2.5 hours to 1 km per 3600 seconds, which is wrong. The correct conversion is:\n\nSpeed = 1 km / 2.5 hours = (1000 m) / (2.5 * 3600 s) = 1000 / 9000 ≈ 0.1111 m/s.\n\nBut the user instead did 1 km / 3600 s, which is wrong because 2.5 hours is not 1 hour. So their mistake was dividing by 3600 instead of 2.5*3600.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is 1000 meters divided by (2.5 * 3600 seconds):\n\nSpeed = 1000 m / (2.5 * 3600 s) = 1000 / 9000 ≈ 0.1111 m/s.\n\nThen, distance = speed * time = 0.1111 m/s * 90 s ≈ 10 meters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10 meters.

So the initial thought had an error, and the correct answer is 10 meters.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem says \"1 kilometer in 2.5 hours\", so speed is 1/2.5 = 0.4 km/h. That's 0.4 km/h. So in seconds, 0.4 km/h = 0.4 * 1000 m / 3600 s = 400 / 3600 ≈ 0.1111 m/s.\n\nThen, time is 90 s.

How many meters long is the hallway?\"\n\nNo, the problem is straightforward. So the answer is 10 meters.\n\nWait, but hold on, perhaps the question states \"forward\" but there is a component? No, the problem says it's moving forward at constant speed, so no acceleration or turning.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10 meters.\n\nBut then why did I initially think 250 meters? Because my first thought assumed the speed was 1 km per hour instead of 2.5. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps someone might think that 2.5 hours per km would be the pace. Wait, so pace is time per distance, but speed is distance per time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if a person miscalculates the time conversion, like multiplying instead of dividing.\n\nWait, let me check another approach:\n\nIf the robot takes 2.5 hours to go 1 km, then in one hour it travels 1/2.5 km, which is 0.4 km. So speed is 0.4 km/h. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, how many seconds to travel 1 km?\n\nTime taken for 1 km is 2.5 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 9000 seconds per kilometer.\n\nThus, speed is 1000 m / 9000 s ≈ 0.1111 m/s.\n\nThen, in 90 seconds: 0.1111 * 90 ≈ 10 meters. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, setting up a proportion.\n\nLet’s set up the proportion:\n\n1 km / 2.5 hours = L meters / 90 seconds.\n\nConvert 2.5 hours to seconds: 2.5 hours = 2.5 × 3600 = 9000 seconds.\n\nSo, 1000 m / 9000 s = L / 90 s\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nL = (1000 × 90) / 9000 = (90,000) / 9000 = 10 meters.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the hallway is 10"
