I'm a bit nervous because it's about quadratics and inequalities, but I'll try to stay calm and think it through.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it. We have a quadratic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) with real coefficients. It's given that for all real numbers \\( x \\), the polynomial satisfies the inequality:\n\\[ x^2 - 2x + 2 \\leq P(x) \\leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\]\nAdditionally, we're told that \\( P(11) = 181 \\), and we need to find \\( P(16) \\).\n\nOkay, so \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic, which means it has the general form:\n\\[ P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\]\nwhere \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are real coefficients that we need to determine.\n\nGiven the inequalities, the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is sandwiched between two other quadratics for all real \\( x \\). This makes me think that \\( P(x) \\) must be equal to the upper bound or the lower bound at certain points, but considering it's in between for all \\( x \\), perhaps it's a specific combination of these quadratics.\n\nBut wait, more precisely, since \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic, the inequalities define a region between two quadratics. For the inequalities to hold for all real \\( x \\), the coefficients of \\( P(x) \\) must satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, the difference between \\( P(x) \\) and each of the bounding quadratics must be non-positive or non-negative for all \\( x \\).\n\nLet me denote the lower bound as \\( Q_1(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) and the upper bound as \\( Q_2(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\).\n\nSo we have:\n\\[ Q_1(x) \\leq P(x) \\leq Q_2(x) \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\]\n\nThis implies that:\n1. \\( P(x) - Q_1(x) \\geq 0 \\) for all \\( x \\).\n2. \\( Q_2(x) - P(x) \\geq"

Because otherwise, if they have real roots, the sign might change, which would violate the inequality.\n\nLet me write \\( P(x) \\) as:\n\\[ P(x) = Q_1(x) + k(x) \\]\nwhere \\( k(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial that's non-negative for all \\( x \\).\n\nSimilarly, since \\( P(x) \\leq Q_2(x) \\), we can write:\n\\[ P(x) = Q_2(x) - m(x) \\]\nwhere \\( m(x) \\) is also a non-negative quadratic.\n\nBut \\( P(x) \\) is the same polynomial in both equations, so:\n\\[ Q_1(x) + k(x) = Q_2(x) - m(x) \\]\nThis implies that:\n\\[ k(x) + m(x) = Q_2(x) - Q_1(x) \\]\n\nLet me compute \\( Q_2(x) - Q_1(x) \\):\n\\[ Q_2(x) - Q_1(x) = (2x^2 - 4x + 3) - (x^2 - 2x + 2) \\]\n\\[ = 2x^2 - 4x + 3 - x^2 + 2x - 2 \\]\n\\[ = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\]\nHmm, that simplifies to \\( (x - 1)^2 \\). That's nice because it's a perfect square, which is non-negative for all \\( x \\). \n\nSo, we have:\n\\[ k(x) + m(x) = (x - 1)^2 \\]\n\nBut since both \\( k(x) \\) and \\( m(x) \\) are non-negative quadratics, their sum is also a non-negative quadratic, which matches our result. \n\nNow, since \\( k(x) \\) and \\( m(x) \\) are both quadratics, their sum is another quadratic.

If \\( k(x) \\) and \\( m(x) \\) are both non-negative quadratics, their sum must also be non-negative, which it is. However, for their sum to be a perfect square, it's possible that each of them is a multiple of \\( (x - 1)^2 \\), or maybe one of them is zero and the other is \\( (x - 1)^2 \\). \n\nBut if one of them is zero, then \\( P(x) = Q_1(x) \\) or \\( P(x) = Q_2(x) \\). But in the problem statement, \\( P(x) \\) is between \\( Q_1(x) \\) and \\( Q_2(x) \\), implying it is squeezed between them. So it's not equal to either; therefore, both \\( k(x) \\) and \\( m(x) \\) must be non-zero, positive quadratics.\n\nTherefore, \\( k(x) = a(x) \\cdot (x - 1)^2 \\) and \\( m(x) = b(x) \\cdot (x - 1)^2 \\) where \\( a(x) \\) and \\( b(x) \\) are non-negative constants. But wait, is that necessarily the case?\n\nAlternatively, since their sum is \\( (x - 1)^2 \\), perhaps one is \\( (x - 1)^2 \\) and the other is zero. But since \\( k(x) \\) and \\( m(x) \\) cannot be zero (as that would imply \\( P(x) \\) is equal to one of the bounds, which is not the case here), maybe they are scalar multiples of \\( (x - 1)^2 \\).\n\nWait, no. Since \\( k(x) + m(x) = (x - 1)^2 \\), if both are quadratics, they might have different leading coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\( k(x) \\) and \\( m(x) \\) are both scalar multiples of \\( (x - 1)^2 \\).

But since the inequalities must hold for all x, the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the difference between P(x) and Q1(x). Let me denote D(x) = P(x) - Q1(x). Since Q1(x) ≤ P(x), D(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSimilarly, E(x) = Q2(x) - P(x). Since P(x) ≤ Q2(x), E(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nMoreover, since Q2(x) - Q1(x) = (x-1)^2, we have that D(x) + E(x) = (x-1)^2.\n\nSince D(x) and E(x) are non-negative quadratics, and their sum is (x-1)^2, which is a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, D(x) and E(x) must each be scalar multiples of (x-1)^2, but added together to make (x-1)^2. So, if D(x) = a(x-1)^2 and E(x) = b(x-1)^2, then a + b = 1.\n\nBut since (x-1)^2 is a square, D(x) and E(x) must also be squares or zero. Wait, but D(x) is non-negative and quadratic, so it could be written as a square, or as a multiple of a square. But if D(x) and E(x) are both non-negative quadratics, and their sum is a square, then perhaps each of them is a multiple of that square.\n\nWait, maybe one of them is a multiple of (x-1)^2, and the other is zero. But since both D(x) and E(x) are non-negative, if one is zero, then the other is (x-1)^2. But in that case, P(x) would be either Q1(x) or Q2(x), which contradicts the fact that P(x) is strictly between them. Therefore, both D(x) and E(x) must be positive for some x, so neither can be identically zero.\n\nTherefore, another approach: since"
