I need to find P(16) given that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients, and it's bounded between two other quadratics: x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3 for all real numbers x. Also, P(11) is given as 181. Hmm, interesting problem.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic, I can express it in the general form: P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are real coefficients that I need to determine.\n\nNow, the problem states that x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all x. This means that for every real number x, the value of P(x) lies sandwiched between these two quadratics. So, P(x) is squeezed between them everywhere on the real line.\n\nTo visualize this, maybe I can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound to see what relationship arises. Let's define Q(x) = 2x² - 4x + 3 - (x² - 2x + 2). That simplifies to Q(x) = x² - 2x + 1. Wait, x² - 2x + 1 is a perfect square: (x - 1)². And since (x - 1)² is always non-negative, that means 2x² - 4x + 3 is always greater than or equal to x² - 2x + 2. So, the difference between the upper and lower bounds is always non-negative.\n\nSimilarly, if I define R(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2), then R(x) must be between 0 and (x - 1)² for all x. Since (x - 1)² is non-negative, R(x) is also non-negative. Therefore, R(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) is between 0 and (x - 1)².\n\nBut R(x) is also a quadratic because P(x) is quadratic and x² - 2x + 2 is quadratic. So R(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = ("

Since R(x) must be less than or equal to (x - 1)² for all x, and (x - 1)² is a non-negative quadratic, maybe R(x) is a scalar multiple of (x - 1)², but scaled by some constant?\n\nWait, but R(x) is a quadratic and (x - 1)² is also quadratic. Since both are quadratics, their difference (or ratio) would have certain properties. Given that R(x) ≤ (x - 1)² for all x, maybe R(x) is equal to k(x - 1)² where k is a constant less than or equal to 1? Or maybe not exactly that, but something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(x) can be expressed as (x - 1)^2 + c, where c is a constant. Because (x - 1)^2 is the difference between the upper and lower bounds, so maybe P(x) is somewhere in between.\n\nWait, let's think again. If I have P(x) sandwiched between two quadratics, and the difference between the upper and lower is (x - 1)^2, then P(x) could be equal to the lower bound plus some multiple of (x - 1)^2, but since it's a quadratic, perhaps the multiple is a constant.\n\nBut I might need to approach this differently. Since P(x) is between x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3 for all x, then P(x) is equal to x² - 2x + 2 plus some non-negative multiple of (x - 1)^2, but that seems complicated because (x - 1)^2 is a specific quadratic.\n\nWait, another idea: Since both bounds are quadratics, maybe the coefficients of P(x) can be found by considering them as linear combinations of these bounds.\n\nLet me set up inequalities:\n\nFor all x, x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nSince these inequalities must hold for all x, the coefficients of corresponding powers of x in P(x) must satisfy:\n\n- For x² term: coefficient of P(x) is a.

So the coefficient b must be between -4 and -2? Wait, but inequalities are in terms of the entire polynomial, not just coefficients. Hmm, maybe this approach is not straightforward because the coefficients can't be directly compared like that. For example, even if the coefficients of x² are between 1 and 2, the linear terms might not be between -4 and -2 because the quadratic terms can affect the inequality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference between P(x) and the lower bound must be a non-negative quadratic, and the difference between the upper bound and P(x) must also be non-negative. So:\n\nLet me define D1(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x,\n\nand D2(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nTherefore, both D1(x) and D2(x) are non-negative quadratics for all real x. Since they are quadratics that are non-negative everywhere, their leading coefficients must be non-negative, and their discriminants must be non-positive (so they don't cross the x-axis).\n\nLet me write D1(x) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x,\n\nand D2(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSince both D1 and D2 are non-negative for all x, they must be perfect squares or have leading coefficients non-negative and discriminant ≤ 0.\n\nFirst, let's analyze D1(x):\n\nD1(x) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic D1(x) must satisfy:\n\n1.

Therefore, P(x) must be equal to the lower bound plus some multiple of (x -1)^2, but such that the multiple is between 0 and 1. Because if you add 0, you get the lower bound, and adding 1 gives the upper bound. So, perhaps P(x) = (x² - 2x +2) + k(x -1)^2, where 0 ≤ k ≤1.\n\nWait, that might be a good approach. Let me try that.\n\nLet me suppose that P(x) = (x² - 2x +2) + k(x -1)^2, where k is a constant between 0 and 1. Then, since (x -1)^2 is non-negative, adding it to the lower bound would give a polynomial between the lower and upper bounds. Also, when k=1, it would reach the upper bound. So, this parametrization might work.\n\nLet me check if this is valid. Let's compute P(x):\n\nP(x) = x² -2x +2 + k(x² - 2x +1)\n\n= (1 + k)x² + (-2 - 2k)x + (2 + k).\n\nSo, coefficients:\n\na = 1 + k,\n\nb = -2 -2k,\n\nc = 2 + k.\n\nNow, since k is between 0 and 1, then a is between 1 and 2, which matches the earlier condition. Also, the discriminant conditions?\n\nWait, but maybe this parametrization is sufficient? Let me see.\n\nIf I can write P(x) in this form, then perhaps the only condition is that k is between 0 and 1, and also that P(11)=181. Let's see if this works.\n\nSo, substituting x=11 into P(x):\n\nP(11) = (1 + k)(121) + (-2 -2k)(11) + (2 + k).\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (1 + k)*121 = 121 + 121k,\n\nSecond term: (-2 -2k)*11 = -22"
