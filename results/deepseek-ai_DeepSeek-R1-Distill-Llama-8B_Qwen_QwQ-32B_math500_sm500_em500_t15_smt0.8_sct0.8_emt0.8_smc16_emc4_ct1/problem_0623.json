Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98.\n\nNext, I check if 98 can be divided by 2 again. Since 98 divided by 2 equals 49, which is not a whole number, I move to the next prime number, which is 3. However, 49 is not divisible by 3.\n\nThen, I try the next prime number, 5, but 49 is also not divisible by 5. Moving on to 7, I find that 49 divided by 7 equals 7, which is a whole number.\n\nNow, I have 7 as a factor. I know that 7 multiplied by 7 equals 49. Since 7 is a prime number, I can stop the factoring process here.\n\nFrom this, the prime factorization of 196 is 2² × 7².\n\nTo find the number of positive divisors, I use the formula that involves adding one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying the results. So, (2 + 1) × (2 + 1) equals 3 × 3, which is 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of \\(196\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of \\(196\\):**\n   \n   Start by breaking down \\(196\\) into its prime factors.\n   \n   - \\(196\\) is even, so it is divisible by \\(2\\):\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   \n   - \\(98\\) is also even, so divide by \\(2\\) again:\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   \n   - Now, \\(49\\) is not even. Test for divisibility by prime numbers:\n     \\[\n     49 \\div 7 = 7\n     \\]\n     Since \\(49 = 7 \\times 7\\), and \\(7\\) is a prime number, we stop here.\n   \n   Therefore, the prime factorization of \\(196\\) is:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^"
