            "output": "I need to determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196. To do this, I'll start by finding its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I notice that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98.\n\nNext, I'll check if 98 is divisible by 2 again. Since 98 divided by 2 is 49, it is, and I now have 2 squared.\n\nNow, 49 is a known square number, specifically 7 squared. Dividing 49 by 7 results in 7, and then dividing 7 by 7 gives me 1.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared.\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, if a number N has a prime factorization of \\( p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^{a_n} \\), the total number of divisors is \\( (a_1 + 1) \\times (a_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots \\times (a_n + 1) \\).\n\nApplying this to 196, that would be \\( (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 196**:\n   - 196 is even, so divide by 2:  \n     \\( 196 ÷ 2 = 98 \\)\n   - 98 is also even, divide by 2:  \n     \\( 98 ÷ 2 = 49 \\)\n   - 49 is a known square number, specifically \\(7^2\\):  \n     \\(49 = 7 × 7\\)\n   \n   Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 × 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Divisor Formula**:\n   - For a number in the form \\( N = p^a × q^b \\), the total number of positive divisors is \\( (a + 1) × ("
