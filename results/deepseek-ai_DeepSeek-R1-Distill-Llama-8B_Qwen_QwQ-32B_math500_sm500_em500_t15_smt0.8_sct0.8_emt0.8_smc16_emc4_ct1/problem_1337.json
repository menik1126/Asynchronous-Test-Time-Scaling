It's a rational equation with multiple terms on the left side and a linear term on the right. I remember that when dealing with equations like this, especially with complex solutions, sometimes it helps to use substitution methods or look for patterns.\n\nFirst, I notice that each term on the left has the form \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\), where \\(n\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe there's a way to combine these terms or manipulate the equation to make it more manageable.\n\nI also recall that when you have expressions like \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - a}\\), it can be useful to use partial fractions or substitute \\(y = x^2\\) to simplify. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet me set \\(y = x^2\\). Then each term becomes \\(\\frac{n}{y - n}\\). So the left side of the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\]\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nBut wait, \\(y = x^2\\), so the right side is still in terms of \\(x\\), which complicates things because now I have \\(x\\) on one side and \\(y\\) on the other. Maybe this substitution isn't the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire left side as a function of \\(x^2\\). Let me denote \\(z = x^2\\), so each term becomes \\(\\frac{n}{z - n}\\), and the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{z - 1} + \\"

Let's try to combine the terms on the left side.\n\nTo add the fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). The common denominator would be the product of all four denominators:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4).\n\\]\n\nBut that sounds really complicated. Multiplying all those terms together would result in a very high-degree polynomial, which might not be practical. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait a second, the right side is \\(2010x - 4\\), which is linear. The left side, when written with a common denominator, would result in a rational function of degree 8 (since each denominator is degree 2, and there are four denominators, the numerator after combining would be a cubic or higher). That seems impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize that the left side is the derivative of some function. Let me think.\n\nI know that the derivative of \\(\\ln(x^2 - n)\\) is \\(\\frac{2x}{x^2 - n}\\). Hmm, but the left side has terms like \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - n}\\), which is similar to \\(\\frac{1}{2x} \\cdot \\frac{2x}{x^2 - n}\\). So, actually, the left side can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2x} \\left( \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{2x}{x^"

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the left side is a sum of terms each of which is a constant over \\(x^2 - n\\). Let me think of the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^4 \\frac{k}{x^2 - k} = 2010x -4\n\\]\n\nPerhaps I can consider moving all terms to one side and then analyze the equation. Let me write:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^4 \\frac{k}{x^2 - k} - 2010x +4 =0\n\\]\n\nBut this still seems difficult. Maybe there's a symmetry here? Let me check if substituting \\(x\\) with \\(-x\\) does something.\n\nLet me see: if I replace \\(x\\) with \\(-x\\), then the left side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(-x)^2 -1} + \\frac{2}{(-x)^2 -2} + \\frac{3}{(-x)^2 -3} + \\frac{4}{(-x)^2 -4} = \\frac{1}{x^2 -1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 -2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 -3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 -4}\n\\]\n\nSo the left side is even in \\(x\\), but the right side becomes \\(-2010x -4\\). Since the left side is even and the right side is not, the equation is not symmetric. So solutions for \\(x\\) and \\(-x\\) won't necessarily be related unless the right side is also even, which it isn't. So that might not help.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can consider that the left side is a function of \\(x^2\\), so maybe if I let \\(y = x^2\\), then the left side is a function of \\(y\\), but the right side is linear in \\(x\\). So maybe I can write the equation as:\n\n\\[\nf(y) = 2010x -4\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(f(y)\\) is the sum of the fractions. But since \\(y = x^2\\), this is a system of equations:\n\n\\"
