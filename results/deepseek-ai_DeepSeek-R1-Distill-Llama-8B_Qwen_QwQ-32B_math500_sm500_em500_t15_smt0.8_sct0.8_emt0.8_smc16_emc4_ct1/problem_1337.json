Hmm, complex solutions? That means I have to consider roots even if they aren't real, right? So, I should probably rewrite this equation in a form that's easier to solve or at least understand better.\n\nFirst, looking at the left side, there are four fractions, each with a linear numerator and a quadratic denominator. Maybe I can combine these fractions somehow. But that might get complicated because they have different denominators. Let me think about another approach.\n\nThe equation is a rational equation, meaning it's a ratio of two polynomials. To solve it, I might need to clear the denominators. But before doing that, maybe I can analyze the equation to see if there's a pattern or a substitution that can simplify things.\n\nWait a second, looking at the denominators: \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). These are all similar to each other, except for the constant term. Maybe I can let \\(y = x^2\\), which would make the denominators \\(y - 1\\), \\(y - 2\\), \\(y - 3\\), \\(y - 4\\). So the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nBut wait, that substitution replaces \\(x^2\\) with \\(y\\), which means when I solve for \\(y\\), I can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\). However, the right side still has an \\(x\\) term. That complicates things because I can't have both \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) in the equation unless I express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\), which would give me \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{y"

Hmm, maybe that's not the right substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire complexity of the equation. Since the problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions, maybe I don't have to find each solution individually. There might be a trick with Vieta's theorem, where the sum of roots can be found without solving the equation. Vieta's formulas relate the sum and product of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial, but that requires that the equation is a polynomial equation. \n\nSo, perhaps if I can rearrange the given equation into a polynomial equation, then I can apply Vieta's formula. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's move all terms to the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHmm, now I need to combine the fractions. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are all quadratic terms, so the common denominator would be the product of all four denominators: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). But multiplying out terms like that might be tedious, but let's see if we can make progress.\n\nHowever, also note that there is a linear term \\( -2010x + 4 \\) on the left side, so when we multiply everything by the common denominator, we will end up with a polynomial equation (since we'll be multiplying terms that have denominators by that common denominator, and the linear terms will as well). \n\nBut this seems very high degree. Let me see. The denominators are all degree 2, so the product is degree 8. The numerator terms after multiplying each fraction by the common denominator (i.e., dividing by each denominator) would result in numerators that are each missing one term. Let me perhaps try to compute the equation step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's some symmetry here. Let me check if the equation is even or odd. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we substitute \\(x\\) with \\"

So, the left side is even. What about the right side: substituting \\(-x\\) gives \\(2010(-x) - 4 = -2010x - 4\\), which is not the same as the original right side, \\(2010x - 4\\), unless \\(x=0\\). So, if \\(x\\) is not zero, the right side is odd. Therefore, the equation is not symmetric about the y-axis in a way that would make it an even function. Therefore, the solutions are not symmetric with respect to negation. So, perhaps some solutions are positive, some are negative.\n\nBut that might not be directly helpful. Let me think about another approach.\n\nWait, if I think about this equation, all the denominators are of the form \\(x^2 - k\\), which is similar to the form \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\). Hmm, perhaps I can relate this to the derivative of some function or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let \\(x^2 = t\\), then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{t - 1} + \\frac{2}{t - 2} + \\frac{3}{t - 3} + \\frac{4}{t - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nBut again, the problem is the \\(x\\) on the right side. Since \\(t = x^2\\), \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{t}\\), but then we have both plus and minus. Maybe this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific values of \\(x\\). For example, what if \\(x\\) is an integer? Maybe I can test some integer values to see"

Let's suppose x is approaching 0, then the left side is about -4, the right side is linear in x. So near x=0, the equation is -4 ≈ 2010x -4. So the only solution near x=0 is x=0.\n\nWhat about if x is very large? Let's see.\n\nFor large x, the left side consists of terms like 1/(x^2 -1) ≈ 1/x², similarly for others, so the left side is approximately (1 + 2 + 3 +4)/x² = 10/x², which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity.\n\nThe right side is 2010x -4, which tends to infinity as x approaches infinity.

            "output": "^8 = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the total roots of Q(x)=0 is x=0 plus roots of R(x)=0. So the total sum is 0 + 2/1005 = 2/1005.\n\nBut the roots of R(x)=0 must include all the extraneous roots (the poles) and any other valid roots beyond x=0.\n\nHowever, the problem is, are there any valid roots besides x=0? Because when we considered the real number line, we only found x=0 as the real solution, and the function seems to not cross zero elsewhere on the real line. Maybe there are complex solutions.\n\nBut the question asks for the sum of all complex solutions, which would be the valid roots (x=0 and any complex roots that are not poles).\n\nHowever, the polynomial Q(x)=0 includes all the poles, and the sum over all roots of Q(x)=0 is 2/1005. The sum of the poles is zero (as their pairs cancel), so the remaining roots (the solutions) must sum to 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"complex solutions\"—so even complex ones. The original equation could have complex roots. Even if they don't cross zero on the real line, they might have complex solutions.\n\nTherefore, the correct sum should account for all roots except the poles (extraneous ones), but since the poles sum to zero, the total sum excluding them is equal to the total sum of Q(x)=0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me check numerically. We saw that x=0 is a solution. If there are other complex solutions, they come in conjugate pairs, so their sum would be real. Since the polynomial has real coefficients, complex roots come in conjugate pairs so their sum is also real.\n\nTherefore, the total sum of all solutions is 2/1005. So, I think that is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the equation:\n\nThe original equation can be considered as:\n\nLeft side: sum_{k=1}^4 k/(x² -k) = 2010x -4.\n\nSuppose I consider substituting y = x + c,"

Hmm, that seems not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that the left side is similar to a derivative of some function, but I can't think of a direct relation.\n\nTherefore, going back, the sum is 2/1005, so boxed, it would be \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{1005}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{1005}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of all complex solutions of the equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4,\n\\]\n\nwe start by noting that the left side is an even function, while the right side is an odd function. This suggests that the solutions are not symmetric with respect to negation.\n\nWe test specific values and find that \\( x = 0 \\) is a solution. To find other solutions, we consider the equation as a polynomial equation by clearing the denominators. Multiplying both sides by the common denominator \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\) results in a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\nWe denote this polynomial as \\( Q(x) \\). Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of all roots of \\( Q(x) = 0 \\) is given by the coefficient of \\( x^7 \\) divided by the coefficient of \\( x^9 \\) with a sign change.
