The given information is that z is equal to 1 plus i, and w is defined as (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). Hmm, alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number, the modulus is like its distance from the origin on the complex plane. So, if I can express w in the form a + bi, then |w| would just be the square root of (a squared plus b squared). That makes sense.\n\nBut before I can find the modulus of w, I need to figure out what w actually is. Since w is given in terms of z, I should start by substituting z into the expression. Given that z is 1 + i, replacing z in the numerator and denominator should give me another complex number.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nNumerator: 3z + 1. Since z is 1 + i, this becomes 3*(1 + i) + 1. Let me compute that.\n\n3*(1 + i) is 3*1 + 3*i, which is 3 + 3i. Then adding 1 gives 3 + 3i + 1, which simplifies to 4 + 3i. Okay, so the numerator is 4 + 3i.\n\nNow the denominator: 5z + 7. Again, substituting z as 1 + i, this becomes 5*(1 + i) + 7. Calculating that:\n\n5*(1 + i) is 5*1 + 5*i, which is 5 + 5i. Then adding 7 gives 5 + 5i + 7, which simplifies to 12 + 5i. So the denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nSo now, w is (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). Hmm, dividing complex numbers can be tricky. I remember that to divide complex numbers, you multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of a complex number a + bi is a - bi. So the conjugate of 12 + 5i would be 12 - 5i.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nw = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5"

Let's compute the numerator first.\n\nMultiplying (4 + 3i) by (12 - 5i):\n\nUsing the distributive property:\n\n4*12 + 4*(-5i) + 3i*12 + 3i*(-5i)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n4*12 is 48.\n\n4*(-5i) is -20i.\n\n3i*12 is 36i.\n\n3i*(-5i) is -15i². Wait, i squared is -1, so this becomes -15*(-1) which is +15.\n\nNow, adding all these terms together:\n\n48 - 20i + 36i + 15.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n48 + 15 is 63.\n\n-20i + 36i is 16i.\n\nSo the numerator becomes 63 + 16i.\n\nNow the denominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i). That's a difference of squares, so it's 12² - (5i)².\n\n12 squared is 144.\n\n(5i) squared is 25i², which is 25*(-1) = -25.\n\nSo, 144 - (-25) is 144 + 25, which is 169.\n\nSo now, w is (63 + 16i)/169.\n\nThis means that a, the real part, is 63/169 and the imaginary part, b, is 16/169.\n\nSo, |w| is the modulus, which is sqrt(a² + b²). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute the squares of a and b.\n\n(63/169)² = (63²)/(169²) = 3969 / 28561.\n\n(16/169)² = (256)/(28561).\n\nAdding these together:\n\n3969 + 256 = 4225.\n\nSo 4225 / 28561.\n\nNow, sqrt(4225) is 65, and sqrt(28561) is 169.\n\nWait, but 169 squared is 28561, yes, because 170 squared is 28900, so subtracting 339 gives 28561, which is 169 squared.\n\nSo sqrt(4225/28561) is"

So both have a common factor of 13.\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 13, 65 ÷13=5, 169 ÷13=13. So 5/13.\n\nWait, is that right? Because 65/169 simplifies to 5/13.\n\nSo the modulus is 5/13.\n\nWait, that seems a bit small, let me double-check my steps.\n\nStarting with z = 1 + i, so 3z + 1 = 3*(1 + i) +1 = 3 + 3i +1 = 4 + 3i, that seems correct.\n\n5z +7 =5*(1 +i) +7 =5 +5i +7=12 +5i, that's right.\n\nThen, to divide, I multiplied numerator and denominator by 12 -5i.\n\nSo numerator: (4 +3i)(12 -5i) =4*12 +4*(-5i) +3i*12 +3i*(-5i)=48 -20i +36i -15i².\n\n-15i² becomes +15. So terms:48+15=63, -20i +36i=16i, so 63+16i. That seems correct.\n\nDenominator: (12+5i)(12-5i)=144 - (5i)^2=144 -(-25)=144+25=169. Correct.\n\nSo w= (63 +16i)/169.\n\nThus, |w|=sqrt(63² +16²)/169.\n\nCompute 63²: 63*63, let me compute:\n\n60²=3600, 3²=9, and cross term 2*60*3=360. So 3600 + 360 +9=3969.\n\n16²=256.\n\nAdding:3969 +256=4225.\n\nsqrt(4225)=65, so sqrt(4225)/169=65/169=5/13. Because 65 is 5*13, 169 is 13², so 13 cancels, leaving 5/13.\n\nHence, |w|=5/13.\n\nWait"

            "output": ", 5/13 is approximately 0.3846, which seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, another method: I can express w as (3z +1)/(5z +7), so |w|= |3z +1| / |5z +7|.\n\nSince modulus is multiplicative, so |w|= |3z +1| / |5z +7|.\n\nSo maybe I can compute |3z +1| and |5z +7| separately, then divide.\n\nLet me try that method as a cross-check.\n\nCompute |3z +1|:\n\nz =1 +i, so 3z =3 +3i, 3z +1=4 +3i. So |4 +3i|=sqrt(4² +3²)=sqrt(16 +9)=sqrt(25)=5.\n\nCompute |5z +7|:\n\n5z=5 +5i, 5z +7=12 +5i, so |12 +5i|=sqrt(12² +5²)=sqrt(144 +25)=sqrt(169)=13.\n\nThus |w|= |3z +1| / |5z +7|=5/13.\n\nSo same result. That's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, |w|=5/13.\n</think>\n\nTo find |w| where w = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7) and z = 1 + i:\n\n1. Compute the numerator: 3z + 1 = 3(1 + i) + 1 = 4 + 3i. The modulus |4 + 3i| is √(4² + 3²) = 5.\n2. Compute the denominator: 5z + 7 = 5(1 + i) + 7 = 12 + 5i. The modulus |12 + 5i| is √(12² + 5²) = 13.\n3. Therefore, |w| = |3z + 1| / |5z + 7| = 5 / 13.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{13}}."
