The matrix M transforms the vector [2, -1] to [9, 3] and [1, -3] to [7, -1]. Hmm, I think I need to figure out what M is first, and then apply it to the line.\n\nLet me recall how matrices work. A matrix transformation can be represented as M * vector = image vector. So, if I can express M as a matrix, I can then multiply it by the equation of the line to find its image.\n\nBut wait, how do I find matrix M? The problem gives me two vectors and their images. Maybe I can set up a system of equations to find the elements of M.\n\nLet\u2019s denote M as:\n\n[ a  b ]\n[ c  d ]\n\nSo, applying M to [2, -1] should give [9, 3]. That means:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, applying M to [1, -3] should give [7, -1]. So:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nNow I have four equations:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. 2c - d = 3\n3. a - 3b = 7\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c, d. Let me work on equations 1 and 3 first for a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nI can solve these two equations simultaneously. Maybe use substitution or elimination. Let me use elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 3: 6a - 3b = 27\nSubtract equation 3 from this: (6a - 3b) - (a - 3b) = 27 - 7\nSo, 6a - 3b - a + 3b = 20\nThis simplifies to 5a = 20 => a = 4\n\nNow plug a=4 into equation 1: 2*"

Multiply equation 4 by 2: 2c - 6d = -2\n\nSubtract equation 2 from this: (2c - 6d) - (2c - d) = -2 - 3\nWhich gives: 2c -6d -2c + d = -5 => -5d = -5 => d = 1\n\nNow plug d=1 into equation 4: c - 3*1 = -1 => c -3 = -1 => c = 2\n\nSo, c=2, d=1.\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n\n[4  -1]\n[2   1]\n\nLet me double-check these values to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the first vector [2, -1]:\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1) = 8 + 1 = 9 \u2705\n2*2 + 1*(-1) = 4 -1 = 3 \u2705\n\nSecond vector [1, -3]:\n4*1 + (-1)*(-3) = 4 + 3 = 7 \u2705\n2*1 + 1*(-3) = 2 -3 = -1 \u2705\n\nGreat, M is correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. To do this, I think I can parametrize the line and then apply the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, since the line is affine, maybe I can express it as a vector equation and then multiply by M.\n\nWait, another approach: since the line can be written as [x, y] where y = 2x + 1, so for any point (x, y) on the line, y -1 = 2(x). So, points on the line can be written as (t, 2t + 1) for some parameter t.\n\nSo, the vector form is [x; y] ="
