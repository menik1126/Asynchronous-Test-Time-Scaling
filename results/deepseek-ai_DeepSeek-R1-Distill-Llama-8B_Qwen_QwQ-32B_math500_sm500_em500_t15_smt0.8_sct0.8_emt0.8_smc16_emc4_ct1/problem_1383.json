So maybe I should figure out how the matrix M acts on points and then see what happens to the line y = 2x + 1.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me two specific transformations. It says that M takes the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3) and (1, -3) to (7, -1). I think I can use these to find the matrix M. Let me denote M as a 2x2 matrix:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nSo, when M acts on a vector v = (x, y), it becomes Mv = (ax + by, cx + dy). Applying this to the given vectors:\n\nFor the first transformation: M*(2, -1) = (9, 3)\nSo, 2a - b = 9\nAnd 2c - d = 3\n\nFor the second transformation: M*(1, -3) = (7, -1)\nSo, a - 3b = 7\nAnd c - 3d = -1\n\nNow I have a system of equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) a - 3b = 7\n3) 2c - d = 3\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c, d. Let me start with equations 1 and 2, which involve a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 2: a - 3b = 7\n\nMaybe I can solve for one variable in terms of another. Let's solve equation 1 for b:\n\n2a - b = 9\n=> b = 2a - 9\n\nNow substitute this into equation 2:\n\na - 3*(2a - 9) = 7\na - 6a + 27 = 7\n-5a = 7 - 27\n-5a = -20\na = 4\n\nNow plug a = 4 back into b = 2a - 9:\n\nb = 2*"

Let me double-check with the given vectors.\n\nFirst vector: (2, -1)\nM*(2, -1) = (4*2 + (-1)*(-1), 2*2 + 1*(-1)) = (8 +1, 4 -1) = (9,3) Correct.\n\nSecond vector: (1, -3)\nM*(1, -3) = (4*1 + (-1)*(-3), 2*1 + 1*(-3)) = (4 +3, 2 -3) = (7, -1) Correct.\n\nOkay, so M is correctly determined.\n\nNow, I need to find the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M. The image will be another line, so I need to find two points that are transformed by M, find their images, then determine the equation of the line connecting these images.\n\nBut how do I find points on y=2x +1? Maybe it's easier to parameterize the line. Let me represent any point on y=2x +1 as (t, 2t +1), where t is any real number.\n\nSo, a general point on the line is (t, 2t +1). Let me apply M to this point:\n\nM*(t, 2t +1) = [4*t + (-1)*(2t +1), 2*t +1*(2t +1"

Now, I need to express this in terms of x’ and y’ to find the relationship between x’ and y’.\n\nLet me denote x’ = 2t -1 and y’ = 4t +1.\n\nI can solve for t from the x’ equation:\n\nx’ = 2t -1\n=> x’ +1 = 2t\n=> t = (x’ +1)/2\n\nNow, substitute this into y’:\n\ny’ = 4t +1 = 4*(x’ +1)/2 +1 = 2*(x’ +1) +1 = 2x’ +2 +1 = 2x’ +3\n\nSo, the image of the line y=2x +1 under M is y’ = 2x’ +3.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, (x’, y’) = (2t -1, 4t +1). So:\n\nLet me try to express y’ in terms of x’:\n\nFrom x’ = 2t -1,\n\nLet me solve for t: t = (x’ +1)/2\n\nThen y’ = 4t +1 = 4*(x’ +1)/2 +1 = 2*(x’ +1) +1 = 2x’ +2 +1 = 2x’ +3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to see it as a linear transformation. Since M is a linear transformation, the image of a line will be another line. So, perhaps another way is to take two points on the original line, apply M, get two points on the image line, then compute the equation.\n\nLet me try that as a cross-check.\n\nPick two points on y=2x +1. Let me choose t=0 and t=1.\n\nWhen t=0: (0"

Applying M:\n\nM*(1,3) = (4*1 + (-1)*3, 2*1 +1*3) = (4 -3, 2 +3) = (1,5)\n\nSo, two points on the image line are (-1,1) and (1,5).\n\nNow, find the equation of the line through (-1,1) and (1,5).\n\nCompute slope m:\n\nm = (5 -1)/(1 - (-1)) = 4/2 = 2.\n\nSo, slope is 2. Now, using point (-1,1):\n\ny -1 = 2(x - (-1)) => y -1 = 2(x +1) => y = 2x +2 +1 => y=2x +3.\n\nSame result as before.
