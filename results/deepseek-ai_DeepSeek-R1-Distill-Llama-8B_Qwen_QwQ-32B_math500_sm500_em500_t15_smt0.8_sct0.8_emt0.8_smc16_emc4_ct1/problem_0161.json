            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve for the positive value of x where the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the cube root of something is the number which, when multiplied by itself three times, equals that something. So, if I have the cube root of A equals B, that means A must be equal to B cubed. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, applying that to the given equation: the cube root of (x² - 4x + 4) is equal to 16. That should mean that (x² - 4x + 4) is equal to 16 cubed. Let me write that down:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 16³.\n\nNow, I should compute 16 cubed. I know that 16 is 2 to the power of 4, so maybe I can use exponents to simplify that. But for now, let me just calculate it. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... let's see, 256 x 10 is 2560, and 256 x 6 is 1536, so adding those together gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, 16³ is 4096.\n\nSo, the equation now is:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nHmm, okay. Next, I can subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero, which will give me a quadratic equation. Let me do that:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0.\n\nSimplifying that, 4 minus 4096 is -4092. So the equation becomes:\n\nx² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0. I need to solve for x. Since it's a quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\nIn this equation, a = 1, b = -4, and c = -4092. Let me substitute these values into the quadratic formula.\n\nFirst, let me compute the discriminant, which is"

            "output": " b² - 4ac. So, b squared is (-4) squared, which is 16. Then, 4ac is 4 * 1 * (-4092) = -16368. So, plugging that in, the discriminant becomes:\n\n16 - (-16368) = 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nWait, so the discriminant is 16384. That's a perfect square, right? Because 128 squared is 16384. Let me check: 128 x 128. 100 x 100 is 10,000, 100 x 28 is 2800, 28 x 100 is another 2800, and 28 x 28 is 784. So, 10,000 + 2800 + 2800 + 784 = 10,000 + 5600 = 16,600 + 784 = 17,384. Hmm, wait, that's not right. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, no, because 128 x 128 is actually 128^2, which I recall is 16384. So yes, 128^2 is 16384. So, sqrt(16384) is 128.\n\nSo, going back to the quadratic formula, x equals [-b plus or minus sqrt(discriminant)] / (2a). Since b is -4, -b is 4. So:\n\nx = [4 ± 128] / (2*1).\n\nSo, that gives two possible solutions:\n\nx = (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66,\n\nand\n\nx = (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62.\n\nBut the question asks for the positive value of x, so x = 66 is the solution.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation:\n\nCube root of (x² - 4x + 4) = 16.\n\nCubed both sides: x² - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nSubtracted 4096: x² -4x -4092 = 0.\n\nThen applied quadratic formula with a=1, b=-4, c=-4092.\n\nDiscriminant: (-4)^2 -4*1*(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 163"

Let me just verify by plugging x=66 back into the original equation to ensure it works.\n\nCompute x² -4x +4: 66^2 is 4356, 4x is 264, so 4356 - 264 = 4092, then +4 gives 4096.\n\nSo, cube root of 4096 is indeed 16, since 16^3=4096.
