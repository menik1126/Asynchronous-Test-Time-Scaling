Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with cube roots, one way to get rid of them is by cubing both sides of the equation. That should help me simplify things. So, if I cube both sides, I should be able to eliminate the cube root on the left side. Let me write that down:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\\right)^3 = 16^3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side gives me just \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\). On the right side, 16 cubed. I need to calculate what 16 cubed is. Let me compute that:\n\n\\(16 \\times 16 = 256\\), and then \\(256 \\times 16\\). Hmm, 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, 16 cubed is 4096.\n\nNow, my equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\\]\n\nAlright, next step is to bring the 4096 to the left side so that the equation equals zero. I'll subtract 4096 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that, 4 minus 4096 is -4092. So the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = -4092\\). I need to solve for x. Since this is a quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula, which is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values I have:\n\n- \\(b = -4\\), so \\(-b = 4\\)\n-"

What's the square root of 16384? Let me think... Maybe 128 because \\(128 \\times 128 = 16384\\). Let me check:\n\n128 times 100 is 12800, and 128 times 28 is 3584. So, 12800 + 3584 = 16384. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the square root of 16384 is 128. Now plugging back into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2 \\times 1}\n\\]\n\nThis gives me two solutions:\n\n1. \\(x = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\\)\n2. \\(x = \\frac{4 - 128}{2} = \\frac{-124}{2} = -62\\)\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 66 and x = -62. The question asks for the positive value of x, so 66 is the answer.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nLet's plug x = 66 into the original equation:\n\nFirst, compute \\(x^2 - 4x + 4\\):\n\n66 squared is 4356. Then 4 times 66 is 264. So, 4356 - 264 is 4092, and 4092 + 4 is 4096.\n\nSo, the cube root of 4096 is indeed 16. That's correct.\n\nNow, checking x = -62:\n\nCompute \\((-62)^2 - 4*(-62) + 4\\):\n\n62 squared is 3844. 4 times 62 is 248. So, 3844 - (-248) is 3844 + 248 = 4092. Adding 4 gives 4096. So, again, cube root is 16. So"
