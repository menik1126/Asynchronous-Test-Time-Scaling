            "output": "First, I need to simplify the expression \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3.\n\nI'll start by addressing each term individually. For the \u221a2 and 1/\u221a2 terms, I can combine them. To simplify 1/\u221a2, I'll rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a2. This gives me \u221a2/2. So, \u221a2 + \u221a2/2 equals (2\u221a2 + \u221a2)/2, which simplifies to (3\u221a2)/2.\n\nNext, I'll handle the \u221a3 and 1/\u221a3 terms in the same way. Rationalizing 1/\u221a3 by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a3 yields \u221a3/3. Adding this to \u221a3 gives \u221a3 + \u221a3/3. Combining these terms, I get (3\u221a3 + \u221a3)/3, which simplifies to (4\u221a3)/3.\n\nNow, I'll combine the simplified terms of \u221a2 and \u221a3: (3\u221a2)/2 + (4\u221a3)/3. To add these, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 2 and 3 is 6. Therefore, I'll convert each term to have a denominator of 6.\n\nMultiplying the first term by 3/3 and the second term by 2/2 gives me (9\u221a2)/6 + (8\u221a3)/6. Combining these, the expression becomes (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nFinally, I identify the values of a, b, and c. Here, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Adding these together, a + b + c equals 9 + 8 + 6, which is 23.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow the steps methodically.\n\n**Problem:**\nSimplify the expression:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\nand express it in the form:\n\\[\n\\frac{a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3}}{c}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are positive integers, and \\(c\\) is as small as possible.
