Then, I will find the sum \\(a + b + c\\).\n\nFirst, I'll focus on simplifying the terms involving \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). The expression has both \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), so I can combine these two terms. To add them, it's helpful to find a common denominator.\n\nI'll rewrite \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) as \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) because multiplying the numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) rationalizes the denominator. Now, the two terms become \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\nNext, I'll combine these like terms. \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), so adding them together gives \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the terms involving \\(\\sqrt{3}\\). The expression has both \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\). Similar to the previous step, I'll rewrite \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) as \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). So, the terms become \\(\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n\nCombining these, \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), so adding them gives \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{3} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\).\n\nNow, I'll combine the simplified terms for"

The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator (LCD) is 6. I'll convert each fraction to have the denominator of 6.\n\nFor \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 3 gives \\(\\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{6}\\). For \\(\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\), multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 2 gives \\(\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{6}\\).\n\nNow, adding these together, the expression is \\(\\frac{9\\sqrt{2} + 8\\sqrt{3}}{6}\\).\n\nIn this form, \\(a = 9\\), \\(b = 8\\), and \\(c = 6\\). Since 6 is the smallest possible integer for \\(c\\), the conditions of the problem are satisfied.\n\nFinally, to find \\(a + b + c\\), I add 9, 8, and 6 to get 23.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression and find the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Separate the terms involving \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Simplify \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\):**\n   - Rewrite \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) as \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n   - Combine the terms:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify \\(\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3"
