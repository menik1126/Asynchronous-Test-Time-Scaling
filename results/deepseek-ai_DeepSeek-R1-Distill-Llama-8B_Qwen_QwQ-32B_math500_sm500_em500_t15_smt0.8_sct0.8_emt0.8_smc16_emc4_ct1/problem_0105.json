Let me write it down step by step to understand better.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, I remember that when you have an equation like this, where two fractions are on the left side and one on the right, you can combine the fractions on the left into a single fraction. That way, you can compare the numerators and set up equations to solve for C and D.\n\nFirst, let me note the denominators on the left side: (x - 3) and (x + 8). The right side denominator is given as (x^2 + 5x - 24). I should factor that to see if it matches the other denominators, which might help in combining the fractions.\n\nFactoring x^2 + 5x - 24. I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let me think: 8 and -3 work because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, the denominator factors into (x + 8)(x - 3). That's good because it's the same as the denominators on the left side.\n\nSo, the right-hand side denominator factors into (x + 8)(x - 3), which means the denominators on both sides are the same. Therefore, the numerators must be equal for the equation to hold true for all x (except x = 3 and x = -8 to avoid division by zero).\n\nSo, let me write the left side as a single fraction. The common denominator is (x - 3)(x + 8). So, I need to combine the two fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSo, now the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - "

            "output": "3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find the values of C and D such that the left side equals the right side for all x (except 3 and -8). This is an identity, so it must hold for all x.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nNow, set this equal to the right side:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nSo, now we have a linear equation in x. For these two expressions to be equal for all x, the coefficients of the corresponding terms must be equal. That means:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables, C and D. Let me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me use substitution.\n\nFrom Equation 1, I can express C in terms of D: C = 4 - D\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 2:\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n8 * 4 = 32\n\n8 * (-D) = -8D\n\nSo,\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nNow, let me solve for D. Subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo, D is 5. Now, substitute back into Equation 1:\n\nC + "
