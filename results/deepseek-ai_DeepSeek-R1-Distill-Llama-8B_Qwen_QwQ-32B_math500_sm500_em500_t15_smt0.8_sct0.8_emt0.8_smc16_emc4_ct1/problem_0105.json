            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\]\n\nAnd this is supposed to be true for all real values of x except -8 and 3 because those values would make the denominators zero, right? So, my goal is to find C and D such that this equation holds for all other x. Then, once I have C and D, I just multiply them together to get CD.\n\nHmm, okay, so first, maybe I should simplify the right-hand side? Let me factor the denominator to see if it can be broken down into simpler terms. The denominator is \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let me think: 8 and -3? Because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. Yeah, that works. So, the denominator can be factored as (x + 8)(x - 3).\n\nSo, rewriting the right-hand side, it becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{4x - 23}{(x + 8)(x - 3)}\\]\n\nNow, looking at the left-hand side, it's the sum of two fractions with denominators (x - 3) and (x + 8). Since these are common denominators, maybe I can combine the two fractions on the left to have a common denominator as well. That way, both sides of the equation will have the same denominator, and I can set the numerators equal to each other.\n\nSo, to add \\(\\frac{C}{x - 3}\\) and \\(\\frac{D}{x + 8}\\), the common denominator would be (x - 3)(x + 8). So, I would multiply the first fraction by (x + 8)/(x + 8) and the second fraction by (x - 3)/(x - 3) to get:\n\n\\[\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x + 8"

Since the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal:\n\n\\[C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\\]\n\nAlright, so now I have an equation in terms of x:\n\n\\[C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\\]\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n\\[C \\cdot x + 8C + D \\cdot x - 3D = 4x - 23\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\\]\n\nNow, since this equation is supposed to hold for all real values of x except -8 and 3, the coefficients of the corresponding powers of x must be equal on both sides. That is, the coefficients of x must be equal, and the constant terms must be equal.\n\nSo, let's set up a system of equations based on the coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: \\(C + D = 4\\)\n2. Constant term: \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1. \\(C + D = 4\\)\n2. \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nI need to solve for C and D. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe substitution is easier here.\n\nFrom the first equation: \\(C + D = 4\\), so \\(C = 4 - D\\).\n\nNow, substitute \\(C = 4 - D\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\(8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\\)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply out the 8:\n\n\\(32 - 8D - 3D = -23\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(32 - 11D = -23\\)\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n\\(-11D = -23"

Now, since D is 5, plug back into the first equation to find C:\n\n\\(C + 5 = 4\\)\n\nSo, \\(C = 4 - 5 = -1\\)\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nTherefore, CD is the product of -1 and 5, which is -5.\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with substituting C into the second equation:\n\n\\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nC = -1, D = 5:\n\n8*(-1) - 3*5 = -8 - 15 = -23\n\nYes, that works. So the coefficients are correct.\n\nSo, the product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just review the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1.

Expanded and collected like terms.\n5. Set coefficients equal, leading to two equations.\n6. Solved the system of equations using substitution.\n7. Checked the solution by plugging back into the original equations.\n\nEverything seems to add up.
