The equation says that half the value of \\(3x - 9\\) is equal to \\(x + 37\\).\n\nTo simplify the equation, I'll write \"half of\" \\(3x - 9\\) as \\(\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9)\\).\n\nNext, I'll set up the equation: \\(\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\\).\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply every term in the equation by 2, resulting in \\(3x - 9 = 2x + 74\\).\n\nNow, I'll subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get \\(x - 9 = 74\\).\n\nFinally, I'll add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\), which gives \\(x = 83\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction.\n\n\\[\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to isolate the variable \\(x\\).\n\n\\[\n3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n\\[\nx = 74 + 9\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 83\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{83}\n\\]"
