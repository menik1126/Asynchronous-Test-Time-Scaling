I'll write that as an equation.\n\nSo, half of \\(3x - 9\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9)\\). This is equal to \\(x + 37\\).\n\nNext, I'll simplify the equation by distributing the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) on the left side.\n\nThat gives me \\(\\frac{3x}{2} - \\frac{9}{2} = x + 37\\).\n\nNow, to eliminate the fractions, I'll multiply every term in the equation by 2.\n\nMultiplying through by 2 results in \\(3x - 9 = 2x + 74\\).\n\nThen, I'll subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to get all the \\(x\\) terms on one side.\n\nThis simplifies to \\(x - 9 = 74\\).\n\nFinally, I'll add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\).\n\nThis gives me \\(x = 83\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n\\[\n\\text{Half the value of } 3x - 9 = x + 37\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Write the equation as is.\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Distribute the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) on the left side.\n\\[\n\\frac{3x}{2} - \\frac{9}{2} = x + 37\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** To eliminate the fractions, multiply every term by 2.\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3x}{2}\\right) - 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cdot x + 2 \\cdot 37\n\\]\n\\[\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to gather like terms.\n\\[\n3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 5:** Add 9 to both sides to"
