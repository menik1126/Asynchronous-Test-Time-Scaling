The solutions are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of this polygon, express it in a certain form, and then find \\( a + b + p \\). Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the equation is a quartic (degree 4) in \\( z \\). Quartic equations can be tricky, but sometimes they factor nicely. Let me see if I can factor this.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). I notice that the coefficients have a kind of pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. That seems a bit like a binomial expansion, maybe something like \\( (z + i)^4 \\) or something similar. Let me try expanding \\( (z + i)^4 \\) and see if it matches.\n\nExpanding \\( (z + i)^4 \\):\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 \\).\n\nSimplify the powers of \\( i \\):\n\n\\( i^2 = -1 \\), \\( i^3 = -i \\), \\( i^4 = 1 \\).\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2(-1) + 4z(-i) + 1 \\).\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi + 1 \\).\n\nWait, our original equation is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). Comparing this with the expansion above, the only difference is the constant term. In the expansion, it's 1, but in our equation, it's -i. So, unless there's a scaling factor or something else, maybe we can adjust.\n\nLet me write the original equation as:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - "

Hmm, but our equation has -i instead of a constant term. Maybe I need to factor something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original equation is similar to \\( (z + i)^4 \\) but with some scaling.

But that doesn't quite match. Hmm, maybe a different substitution.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the equation can be rewritten as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\). Because if I set \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\), then \\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) = 0 \\). Let's see:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi +1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) = 0 \\) would mean \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi +1 -1 -i = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). Which is exactly our equation! Great, that's a breakthrough.\n\nSo, the equation can be written"

Does that affect the area? I don't think so, because shifting the center doesn't change the size or the shape of the square, only its position.\n\nTherefore, the area is \\( 2^{5/4} \\).
