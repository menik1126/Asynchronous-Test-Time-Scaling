Then, I need to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I remember that complex roots can be plotted on the complex plane, and if you connect them in order, they form a polygon. So, since it's a quartic equation, there are four roots, which should form a quadrilateral. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the equation is of degree four, so there should be four roots (solutions). Hmm. To find the roots, maybe I can factor the equation somehow. It looks complicated, but perhaps it's a quadratic in disguise.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). Hmm, the coefficients have an alternating pattern. Let me check if it's a quadratic in terms of \\( z^2 \\). But wait, the exponents are 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, so that's a quartic. Maybe I can factor it as a product of two quadratics?\n\nLet me try that. Suppose \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = (z^2 + az + b)(z^2 + cz + d) \\). Let's expand the right-hand side:\n\n\\( (z^2 + az + b)(z^2 + cz + d) = z^4 + (a + c)z^3 + (ac + b + d)z^2 + (ad + bc)z + bd \\).\n\nNow, equate the coefficients with the given polynomial:\n\n- Coefficient of \\( z^4 \\): 1 = 1 (okay)\n- Coefficient of \\( z^3 \\): 4 = a + c\n- Coefficient of \\( z^2 \\): -6 = ac + b + d\n- Coefficient of \\( z \\"
