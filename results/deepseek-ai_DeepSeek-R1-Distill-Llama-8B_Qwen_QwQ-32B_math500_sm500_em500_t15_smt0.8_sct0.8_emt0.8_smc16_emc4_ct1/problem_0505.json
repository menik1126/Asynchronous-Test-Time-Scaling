The total number of students is 360, and 15 take none of these subjects.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of students taking at least one of the subjects by subtracting the 15 who take none from the total: 360 - 15 = 345 students.\n\nNext, I'll use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students taking exactly two subjects. The formula for two sets is |C ∩ P| + |C ∩ Ch| + |P ∩ Ch| - 2|C ∩ P ∩ Ch|. Plugging in the numbers: 75 (C and Ch) + 75 (P and Ch) - 2×30 (C, P, and Ch) = 165 students.\n\nSince 75 students take both Physics and Chemistry, and 30 take both Calculus and Physics, I can set up equations to find the number of students taking only one subject.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the total number of students taking each subject by adding the students taking exactly one subject to the students taking two or more. For Physics, let x be the number of students taking only Physics. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, x + 75 + 30 = 345. Solving for x gives x = 240. Therefore, the total number of students taking Physics is 240 + 30 = 270.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step using the principle of **inclusion-exclusion**.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students in the school: 360\n- Students taking none of the subjects: 15\n- Students taking at least one subject: \\( 360 - 15 = 345 \\)\n\nLet:\n- \\( C \\) = Students taking Calculus\n- \\( P \\) = Students taking Physics\n- \\( Ch \\) = Students taking Chemistry\n\n**Additional Information:**\n1. \\( |C \\cap P \\cap Ch| = 30 \\) (Students taking all three subjects)\n2. \\( |C \\cap P| = 30 \\) (Students taking both Calculus and Physics)\n3. \\( |C \\cap Ch| = 75 \\) (Students taking both Calculus and Chemistry)\n4. \\( |P \\cap Ch| = 75 \\"

Let me recheck the steps.\n\n**Rechecking Step 1:**\nWait, the problem states that 15 students take all three subjects, not 30. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"15 take calculus, physics, and chemistry\" → \\( |C \\cap P \\cap Ch| = 15 \\).\n\nBut in my calculation above, I used \\( |C \\cap P \\cap Ch| = 30 \\). That"
