The innermost expression is the cube root of 1/729, which is $$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{729}}$$.\n\nNext, I recognize that 729 is equal to 9 raised to the power of 6, so $$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{9^6}} = \\frac{1}{9^2} = \\frac{1}{81}$$.\n\nNow, the expression becomes the square root of 1/81, which is $$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{81}} = \\frac{1}{9}$$.\n\nFinally, taking the square root of 1/9 gives $$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{1}{3}$$.\n\nSo, the simplified form of the original expression with a rational denominator is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression $$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$ and write it with a rational denominator, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the innermost radical:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{729}}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(729 = 9^6\\), the cube root of 729 is \\(9^2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{9^6} = 9^{6/3} = 9^2 = 81\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{81}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Replace the innermost radical with its simplified form:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{81}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{81}} = \\frac{1}{9}\n   \\]\n   Here, we used the fact that \\(\\sqrt{81} = 9\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the outermost radical:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\"
