There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and each of the two letter positions must be different. So, for the first letter, there are 26 possible choices. For the second letter, there are 25 remaining choices since it must be different from the first one.\n\nNext, I'll focus on the numbers. Each number position can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible choices for each. Since the two number positions must also be different, the first number has 10 choices and the second number has 9 remaining choices.\n\nTo find the total number of license plates, I'll multiply the number of choices for each position together. That is, 26 (for the first letter) multiplied by 25 (for the second letter), followed by 10 (for the first number) multiplied by 9 (for the second number). Finally, I'll multiply all these results together to get the total number of possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of possible license plates step by step.\n\n1. **Letters:**\n   - **First Letter:** There are 26 possible choices (A through Z).\n   - **Second Letter:** Since it must be different from the first, there are \\( 25 \\) remaining choices.\n\n   **Total combinations for letters:** \\( 26 \\times 25 = 650 \\)\n\n2. **Numbers:**\n   - **First Number:** There are 10 possible choices (0 through 9).\n   - **Second Number:** Since it must be different from the first, there are \\( 9 \\) remaining choices.\n\n   **Total combinations for numbers:** \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\)\n\n3. **Total License Plates:**\n   - Multiply the combinations for letters and numbers.\n   - \\( 650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{58,\\!500}\\)"
