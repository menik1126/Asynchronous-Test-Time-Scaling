This results in 26 multiplied by 25 possible combinations for the letter part of the license plate.\n\nNext, for the digits, there are 10 possible choices for the first digit and 9 remaining choices for the second digit, leading to 10 multiplied by 9 possible combinations for the digit part.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of unique license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of possible combinations for the letters.**\n- There are **26 letters** (A through Z).\n- Since the two letters must be **different**, the number of ways to choose the first letter is **26**, and for the second letter, it's **25** (since one letter is already used).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of letter combinations} = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of possible combinations for the digits.**\n- There are **10 digits** (0 through 9).\n- Similar to the letters, the two digits must be **different**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of digit combinations} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of license plates.**\n- Each license plate has **2 letters** followed by **2 digits**. Therefore, we multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of license plates} = 650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
