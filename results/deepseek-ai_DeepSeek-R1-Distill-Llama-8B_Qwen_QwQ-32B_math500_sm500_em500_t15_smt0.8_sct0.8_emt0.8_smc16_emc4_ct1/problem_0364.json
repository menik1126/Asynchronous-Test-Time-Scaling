            "output": "First, I'll define variables for the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means B divided by Y equals 4/3. So, I can set up the equation B/Y = 4/3, which simplifies to 3B = 4Y.\n\nNext, I'll consider the change in the number of marbles. I add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, resulting in a new ratio of blue to yellow marbles of 7:3. After the change, the number of blue marbles becomes B + 5, and the number of yellow marbles becomes Y - 3.\n\nI'll set up a second equation based on the new ratio: (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3. This simplifies to 3(B + 5) = 7(Y - 3), which expands to 3B + 15 = 7Y - 21.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n1. 3B = 4Y\n2. 3B + 15 = 7Y - 21\n\nI'll solve the first equation for B: B = (4/3)Y.\n\nNext, I'll substitute B in the second equation with (4/3)Y:\n3*(4/3)Y + 15 = 7Y - 21\nSimplifying, I get 4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21.\n\nSubtracting 4Y from both sides:\n15 = 3Y - 21\n\nAdding 21 to both sides:\n36 = 3Y\n\nDividing by 3:\nY = 12\n\nFinally, substituting Y back into B = (4/3)Y:\nB = (4/3)*12 = 16\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = number of blue marbles initially\n- \\( Y \\) = number of yellow marbles initially\n\n**Given:**\n1. The initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 4:3 \\).  \n   Therefore,  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4"
