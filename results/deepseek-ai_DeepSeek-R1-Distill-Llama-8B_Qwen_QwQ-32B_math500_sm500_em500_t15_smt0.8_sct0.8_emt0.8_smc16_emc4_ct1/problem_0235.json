This means his vertical displacement from the starting point is 0.5 miles.\n\nNext, he walks three-fourths of a mile east. This adds to his horizontal displacement. The eastward distance is 0.75 miles.\n\nThen, he walks another half a mile south, making his total southward distance 1 mile.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from the starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. \n\nI'll square the total southward distance (1 mile) and the eastward distance (0.75 miles), then add them together to get the squared distance. Taking the square root of this result will give me the direct-line distance.\n\nFinally, I'll round the result to the nearest hundredth to get the final answer.\n</think>\n\nBill starts at a point and walks in two directions: south and east. To find his straight-line distance from the starting point, we can break down his movements into their components and then use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Bill's movements**\n- **First movement:** Bill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south.\n- **Second movement:** He then walks \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east.\n- **Third movement:** Finally, he walks another \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total displacement in each direction**\n- **Southward displacement:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} = 1 \\text{ mile} \\)\n- **Eastward displacement:** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile} \\)\n\n**Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance**\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, \\( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\), where \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse (straight-line distance), and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the other two sides (displacements).\n\n- Let \\( a = 1 \\text{ mile} \\) (southward displacement)\n- Let \\( b = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile} \\)"
