The southward distance is 1 mile, and the eastward distance is 3/4 mile.\n\nCalculating the displacement, the straight-line distance is √(1² + (3/4)²) = √(1 + 0.5625) = √1.5625 ≈ 1.25 miles.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how far Bill is from his starting point, let's break down his movements step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Southward Distance:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile south} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile south} = 1 \\text{ mile south}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Eastward Distance:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile east}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Straight-Line Distance Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   \n   The straight-line distance \\( D \\) can be found using the formula:\n   \\[\n   D = \\sqrt{(\\text{southward distance})^2 + (\\text{eastward distance})^2}\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   D = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 0.5625} = \\sqrt{1.5625} \\approx 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.25}\n\\]"
