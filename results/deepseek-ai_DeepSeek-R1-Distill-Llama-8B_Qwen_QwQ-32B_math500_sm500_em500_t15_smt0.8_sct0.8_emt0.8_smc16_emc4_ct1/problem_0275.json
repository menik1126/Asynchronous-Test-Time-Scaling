Specifically, positive odd numbers are added, and negative even numbers are subtracted.\n\nNext, I'll group the terms in pairs to simplify the calculation. Each pair consists of an odd number followed by an even number:\n\n\\[\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n\\]\n\nCalculating each pair, I find that each pair equals \\(-1\\). Since there are 50 such pairs, the total sum is:\n\n\\[\n50 \\times (-1) = -50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final result of the series is \\(-50\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's compute the sum step by step:\n\n\\[\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** **Identify the Pattern**\n\nNotice that the series alternates between addition and subtraction:\n\n\\[\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** **Calculate Each Pair**\n\nEach pair consists of an odd number minus the following even number:\n\n\\[\n1 - 2 = -1 \\\\\n3 - 4 = -1 \\\\\n5 - 6 = -1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n99 - 100 = -1\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** **Count the Number of Pairs**\n\nThere are \\(100\\) terms in total, which means there are \\( \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\) pairs.\n\n**Step 4:** **Compute the Total Sum**\n\nSince each pair equals \\(-1\\), multiply the number of pairs by \\(-1\\):\n\n\\[\n50 \\times (-1) = -50\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
