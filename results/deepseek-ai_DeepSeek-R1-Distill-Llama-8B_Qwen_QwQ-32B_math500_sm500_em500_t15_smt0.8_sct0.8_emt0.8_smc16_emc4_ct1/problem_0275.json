So, the sequence becomes (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + ... + (99 - 100).\n\nEach pair equals -1. There are 50 such pairs, so the total sum is -1 multiplied by 50, which equals -50.\n</think>\n\nLet's compute the sum step by step.\n\n**Problem:** Compute: \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\).\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Sequence:**\n   - We have a series of numbers from 1 to 100 with alternating signs.\n   - The sequence can be written as:\n     \\[\n     1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100\n     \\]\n   - Notice that there are **100 terms** in total.\n\n2. **Split the Sequence into Positive and Negative Terms:**\n   - **Positive terms:** \\(1, 3, 5, \\dots, 99\\) (total of 50 terms)\n   - **Negative terms:** \\(-2, -4, -6, \\dots, -100\\) (total of 50 terms)\n\n3. **Rewrite the Sum:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = (1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + 99) + (-2 - 4 - 6 - \\dots - 100)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Sum of Positive Terms:**\n   - The sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers can be expressed as \\(n^2\\).\n   - Here, \\(n = 50\\), so:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + 99 = 50^2 = 2500\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Sum of Negative Terms:**\n   - This is simply:\n     \\[\n     - (2 + 4 + 6 + \\dots + 100)\n     \\]\n   - The sum of the first \\(n\\) even numbers is"
