            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt[(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2]. Hmm, first, I remember that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root has to be non-negative because you can\u2019t take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x where (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \u2265 0.\n\nAlright, so my first step is to solve this inequality: (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \u2265 0. Maybe I can simplify this expression first. I recall that a^2 - b^2 factors into (a - b)(a + b), so I can apply that here. Let me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). So, the expression becomes:\n\n[(x - 3) - (x - 8)] * [(x - 3) + (x - 8)] \u2265 0\n\nNow, let me simplify each bracket separately. Starting with the first bracket: (x - 3) - (x - 8). That would be x - 3 - x + 8, which simplifies to (x - x) + (-3 + 8) = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nNext, the second bracket: (x - 3) + (x - 8). That would be x - 3 + x - 8, which simplifies to (x + x) + (-3 - 8) = 2x - 11.\n\nSo, putting it back together, the inequality becomes:\n\n5 * (2x - 11) \u2265 0\n\nHmm, okay, so I have 5 times (2x - 11) is greater than or equal to zero. Since 5 is a positive number, I can divide both sides of the inequality by 5 without changing the direction of the inequality sign. So, this simplifies to:\n\n2x - 11 \u2265 0\n\nNow, solving for x, I add 11 to both sides:\n\n2x \u2265 11\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx \u2265 11/2\n\nWait, 11 divided by 2 is 5.5, so"

            "output": " x is greater than or equal to 5.5. So, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x where x is at least 5.5.\n\nThe question is asking for the smallest real number x in the domain. Well, since x has to be greater than or equal to 5.5, the smallest possible x would be 5.5. So, in fractional terms, that's 11/2.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by recognizing the domain requires the expression inside the square root to be non-negative. Then, I used the difference of squares formula correctly to factor the expression into two terms. I simplified each term properly, which gave me 5*(2x - 11) \u2265 0. Then, dividing both sides by 5 gave me 2x - 11 \u2265 0, leading to x \u2265 5.5 or 11/2.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 11/2.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is found by determining where the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Simplifying \\( (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \\) using the difference of squares gives \\( 5(2x - 11) \\geq 0 \\), leading to \\( x \\geq \\frac{11}{2} \\). Thus, the smallest \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}\n\\]"
