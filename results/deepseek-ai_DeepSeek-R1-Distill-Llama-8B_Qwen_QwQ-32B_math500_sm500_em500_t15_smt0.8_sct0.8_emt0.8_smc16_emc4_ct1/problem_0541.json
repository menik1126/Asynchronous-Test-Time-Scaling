            "output": "First, I recognize that Yann and Camille are each selecting one dish from the menu, and there are 10 different dishes available.\n\nSince the order of who chooses which dish matters (i.e., Yann choosing dish A and Camille choosing dish B is different from Camille choosing dish A and Yann choosing dish B), this is a permutation problem, not a combination.\n\nFor the first person, there are 10 possible choices. After that, there are 9 remaining choices for the second person because they cannot order the same dish as the first person.\n\nTo find the total number of permutations, I multiply the number of choices for the first person by the number of choices for the second person: 10 × 9 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 different combinations of meals that Yann and Camille can order without both choosing the same dish.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order from a menu of 10 dishes, given that they refuse to order the same dish and the order of who orders what matters.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - **Total dishes available:** 10\n   - **Each person orders one dish.**\n   - **They cannot order the same dish.**\n   - **The order matters (Yann orders chicken vs. Camille orders chicken is a different scenario).**\n\n2. **Approach:**\n   - This is a permutation problem because the order in which the dishes are chosen matters.\n   - We are dealing with permutations of 10 dishes taken 2 at a time.\n\n3. **Calculating the Permutations:**\n   - **For the first person (Yann),** there are 10 possible dishes to choose from.\n   - **For the second person (Camille),** since one dish has already been chosen by Yann, there are only 9 remaining dishes to choose from.\n   - Therefore, the total number of permutations is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are **90** different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order without both choosing the same dish.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
