This can be calculated using the multiplication principle: 10 options for Yann multiplied by 9 remaining options for Camille, giving 90 possible combinations.\n\nHowever, the problem states they refuse to order the same dish. Therefore, we need to exclude the scenario where both choose the same dish. There are 10 such cases, one for each dish where both order the same.\n\nBy subtracting these 10 cases from the total 90, we arrive at 80 valid combinations.\n\nIn summary, there are 80 ways Yann and Camille can order their meals without having the same dish, considering the order matters.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find out how many different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order under the given conditions.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Number of dishes on the menu (Total items):** 10\n- **Each person orders one dish.**\n- **They refuse to order the same dish.**\n- **The order matters (Yann ordering Chicken and Camille ordering Fish is different from Yann ordering Fish and Camille ordering Chicken).**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Possible Combinations Without Restrictions**\n\nSince there are 10 dishes and each person can choose any dish, the total number of ways they can order is:\n\n\\[\n10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 10 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 100 \\text{ combinations}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Subtract the Cases Where Both Order the Same Dish**\n\nWe need to exclude the cases where both Yann and Camille choose the same dish.

Let's reassess:\n\nWait, actually, **Step 1 was incorrect**. We should not have initially multiplied \\( 10 \\times 10 \\). The problem states that they refuse to order the same dish. Therefore, after Yann chooses a dish, Camille must choose from the remaining \\( 10 - 1 = 9 \\) dishes. \n\n**Correct Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **Choose a dish for Yann first:** There are 10 dishes.\n2. **Choose a dish for Camille:** Since Camille cannot choose what Yann chose, there are 9 remaining dishes.\n3. **Thus, the total valid combinations are:** \n\n\\[\n10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\nWait, **this conflicts with earlier reasoning. Which is correct?**\n\nAh, confusion arises from two different methods. Let me clarify:\n\n- **Method 1:** Total unrestricted combinations are \\( 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\). Subtract the cases where they choose the same dish (which are 10), resulting in \\( 100 - 10 = 90 \\).\n  \n- **Method 2:** Directly compute by noting that once Yann picks one thing, Camille has 9 choices left: \\( 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\).\n\nBoth methods lead to the same result: **90 valid combinations.** \n\n**Wait, but the original question says \"different combinations of meals if they refuse to order the same dish\". However, the problem says \"It does matter who orders what\".**\n\nLet me confirm: Since *permutation matters* (i.e., order matters), this is indeed a permutation problem. When order matters, the number of permutations of 10 items taken 2 at a time is:\n\n\\[\nP(n, k) = n \\times (n-1) = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{90}.\n\nWait, but the initial draft's thought process ended up with 80. Clearly, that was due to an arithmetic error. Let me re"
