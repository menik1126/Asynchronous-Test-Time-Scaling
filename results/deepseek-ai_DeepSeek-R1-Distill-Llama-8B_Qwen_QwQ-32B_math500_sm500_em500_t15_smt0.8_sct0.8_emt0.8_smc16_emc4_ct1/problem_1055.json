The polynomial has integer coefficients, and I remember there's something called the Rational Root Theorem that can help with this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the Rational Root Theorem states. If a polynomial has integer coefficients, then any possible rational root expressed in lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. So, in this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2.\n\nOkay, so for the constant term, the possible values of \\(p\\) are the factors of 1. Since 1 only has one factor, which is itself, \\(p\\) can only be 1 or -1. Now, for the leading coefficient, the possible values of \\(q\\) are the factors of 2, which are 1 and 2.\n\nPutting that together, the possible rational roots are \\(\\frac{1}{1}\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{1}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(\\frac{-1}{2}\\). So that would be four possible rational roots: 1, -1, 1/2, and -1/2.\n\nI should check if there are any other possibilities, but since the constant term is 1, there are no other factors for \\(p\\). The leading coefficient is 2, which doesn't have any other factors besides 1 and 2. So, I don't think I'm missing any possible rational roots.\n\nLet me think if there's an example where this applies. For example, if we have a polynomial like \\(2x^2 + 1\\), the possible rational roots would be \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\). Testing these, if \\(x=1\\), it gives \\(2 + 1 = 3 \\neq 0\\), \\(x=-1\\) gives \\(2 - 1 = 1 \\neq 0\\), \\(x=\\frac{1}{2}\\) gives \\(2*(1/4) + 1 = 0.5 + 1 ="

The point is the possible ones are still those four.\n\nSo, in our given polynomial, even though the coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) are unknown, the Rational Root Theorem only depends on the constant term and leading coefficient. Therefore, regardless of what the other coefficients are, as long as they are integers, the possible rational roots can only be those four.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"different possible rational roots\". Does \"possible\" here mean that they might not necessarily be roots, but just the possible candidates? So, since the question is asking for the number of different possible candidates, not how many of them actually are roots for some polynomial of this form. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, let me read again: \"Find the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial.\"\n\nWait, but \"of this polynomial\", but the coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) are variables here. So perhaps the polynomial is of that form with integer coefficients, so the question is asking for all possible rational numbers that could be a root of such a polynomial for some choice of \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\). So, the possible rational roots vary depending on the coefficients, but we need to count all possible distinct rationals that can be roots for some such polynomial.\n\nAh, that's a crucial point! The question isn't about a specific polynomial with given \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\), but all polynomials of the given form. So we need to find all rational numbers \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) in lowest terms such that there exists integers \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) for which \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) is a root of the polynomial \\(2x^4 +a_3x^3 +a_2x^2 +a_1x +1\\). Then, count how many distinct such rationals exist.\n\nHmm, okay so that's different. The Rational Root Theorem gives the candidates, but not all candidates can be roots for some polynomial of this form. Wait, actually, can all of them be possible?\n\nFor"

So 2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + 1 = 3 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = 0.\n\nSo, that would require \\(a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = -3\\). Since coefficients can be any integers, I can choose \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) such that their sum is -3. For instance, set \\(a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=-3\\). So that would make the polynomial \\(2x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 -3x +1\\). Then, plugging x=1, we get 2 -3 +1 =0. So yes, 1 can be a root.\n\nSimilarly, let's check x=-1.

For example, set \\(a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=3\\). Then, the polynomial would be \\(2x^4 + 0x^3 +0"

Or could there be more? Because in the given polynomial, the degree is 4. Wait, but we can have other roots beyond just the ones given by the constant term over leading coefficient?\n\nWait, no. The Rational Root Theorem says that any rational root must have p dividing the constant term and q dividing the leading coefficient. So in this case, since the constant term is 1 and leading coefficient is 2, the possible p's are 1 and -1, and q's are 1 and 2. So possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, that's four. So regardless of the polynomial, any rational root must be among these four. However, not all of them necessarily are roots for a given polynomial, but for this problem, it's asking for the number of different possible rational roots across all such polynomials.
