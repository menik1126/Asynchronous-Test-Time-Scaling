            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial: \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\). It's a quartic polynomial with integer coefficients, and the leading coefficient is 2, which is positive. The constant term is 1. The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots.\n\nHmm, I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me try to recall. I think it says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. Right?\n\nSo, in this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. The factors of 1 are just \\(\\pm1\\), and the factors of 2 are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\). That means the possible rational roots can be written as \\(\\frac{\\pm1}{\\pm1}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\pm1}{\\pm2}\\).\n\nLet me write that out. So, possible roots would be \\(\\pm1, \\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\). Are there any overlaps there? Let me check: 1 and -1 are straightforward. Then 1/2 and -1/2. So, that gives a total of four possible rational roots.\n\nWait, but are there more? Because sometimes people also consider the cases where the numerator or denominator is shifted, but in this case, since the constant term is 1, the numerator has to be 1 or -1. And the denominator has to be a factor of 2, which is 1 or 2.\n\nSo, listing them out:\n\n1. \\(1\\)\n2. \\(-1\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n4. \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nThat's four different possible rational roots. I think that's it because there are no other factors of 1 or 2. So, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The polynomial has integer coefficients, so the Rational Root Theorem definitely applies here. The possible roots are only those fractions where the numerator divides the constant term and the"

So, yeah, that gives exactly four possibilities. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if these roots can actually occur? Like, maybe some of them can't be roots for some reason? The question says \"possible\" rational roots, so even if they aren't roots for some specific polynomials, they are still considered possible because there exists some polynomial of this form where that is a root. \n\nFor example, if I want to see if 1 is possible, can I choose coefficients such that 1 is a root? Let's test that. Let me plug in x=1 into the polynomial:\n\n\\(2(1)^4 + a_3(1)^3 + a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) + 1 = 0\\)\n\nThat simplifies to 2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + 1 = 0, so a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = -3. Since the coefficients a3, a2, a1 are integers, this equation is possible. For example, set a3 = 0, a2 = 0, a1 = -3. So yes, there exists such a polynomial where 1 is a root.\n\nSimilarly, let's check -1. Plugging in x = -1:\n\n\\(2(-1)^4 + a_3(-1)^3 + a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) + 1 = 0\\)\n\nThat's 2(1) + a3(-1) + a2(1) + a1(-1) +1 = 0 → 2 - a3 + a2 - a1 +1 = 0 → -a3 + a2 - a1 = -3. Again, possible with integers. Let's say a3 = 0, a2 =0, a1 =3. Then -0 +0 -3 = -3, so that works. So -1 is possible.\n\nNow, 1/2. Let's plug in x = 1/2:\n\n\\(2*(1/2)^4 + a3*(1/2)^3 + a2*(1/2)^2 + a1*(1"

Let's see. Let me choose a3, a2, a1 integers. For example, set a3=1, a2=0, then 1 + 0 + 4a1 = -9 → 4a1 = -10 → a1 = -10/4 = -2.5, which is not integer. Hmm, try a3=3: 3 + 0 +4a1 = -9 → 4a1 = -12 → a1=-3. That works. So a3=3, a2=0, a1=-3. So plugging back, the equation becomes 0. So yes, 1/2 is a possible root.\n\nSimilarly, check -1/2. Plug in x= -1/2:\n\n\\(2*(-1/2)^4 + a3*(-1/2)^3 + a2*(-1/2)^2 + a1*(-1/2) + 1 = 0\\)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\(2*(1/16) = 1/8\\)\n\n\\(a3*(-1/8)\\)\n\n\\(a2*(1/4)\\)\n\n\\(a1*(-1/2)\\)\n\nPlus 1 at the end.\n\nSo equation:\n\n1/8 - (a3)/8 + (a2)/4 - (a1)/2 + 1 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 8:\n\n1 - a3 + 2a2 -4a1 +8 =0 → -a3 + 2a2 -4a1 = -9\n\nIs this solvable? Let's set a3=1:\n\n-1 + 2a"
