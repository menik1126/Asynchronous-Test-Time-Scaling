I'm told that \\( a_n = 2 \\) and \\( a_0 = 66 \\). I need to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since the leading coefficient \\( a_n \\) is 2, the polynomial is monic except for the leading term. If all roots are integers, then the polynomial can be factored as \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), where each \\( r_i \\) is an integer. This makes sense because multiplying out the factors will give me a polynomial with integer coefficients.\n\nNow, the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is 66. In the factored form, \\( a_0 \\) is the product of the leading coefficient and the product of all the roots with a sign depending on the degree. Specifically, \\( a_0 = 2 \\times (-1)^n \\times r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\). Since \\( a_0 = 66 \\), we have \\( (-1)^n \\times 2 \\times r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 66 \\). So, simplifying, \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = \\frac{66}{2 \\times (-1)^n} \\). Let me write that as \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = \\frac{66}{2 \\times (-1)^n} \\).\n\nWait, actually, hold on. \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), so when expanded, the constant term is \\( 2 \\times (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\). So \\( a_0 = 2 \\times (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 66 \\). Therefore, \\( (-1)^n"

If \\( n \\) is even, it's positive 33, and if \\( n \\) is odd, it's negative 33.\n\nNow, \\( r_i \\) are distinct integers. So I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is \\( \\pm 33 \\). The more factors I have, the more spread out the roots are, but each additional root will likely make the next coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) larger in absolute value, so to minimize \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), maybe I should have as few roots as possible? But wait, the number of roots is determined by the degree, which is also tied to the number of terms in the polynomial.\n\nWait, no, the degree is \\( n \\), so the number of roots is \\( n \\). But I don't know \\( n \\) yet. Hmm, since \\( a_n = 2 \\), the degree is \\( n \\). So, the product of the roots is \\( \\pm 33 \\), and I need the roots to be distinct integers. So, perhaps I should factor 33 into as few distinct integer factors as possible.\n\nLet me factor 33. 33 is 3 times 11, and both 3 and 11 are prime. So, the divisors of 33 are \\( \\pm1, \\pm3, \\pm11, \\pm33 \\). If I need distinct integer roots, the possible roots can be combinations of these. So, if I choose roots as 1, 3, 11, 33, etc., but since 33 is not too large, maybe a small number of roots.\n\nWait, but the product of the roots is 33 or -33. Let me consider positive and negative roots.\n\nCase 1: Product is +33.\n\nCase 2: Product is -33.\n\nI need to consider both cases because the sign depends on \\( n \\). For each case, I can choose different roots.\n\nSince I want to have distinct integer roots, maybe starting with small numbers of roots would be better because each additional root will complicate the polynomial and perhaps increase the coefficient \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nLet me try having"

Hmm, maybe that's not the right combination.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where the product of the roots is +33. Then, the roots must multiply to 33.

Then roots could be 3 and 11, or 1 and 33, or -3 and -11, etc. Let's pick 3 and 11. Then the polynomial would be 2(x - 3)(x - 11). Let's compute the coefficients.\n\nExpanding this:"

So, a_{n-1}=2*(-sum of ri).\n\nWait, wait, actually, no. Let me recall: for a monic polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is -sum of roots. But in our case, the leading coefficient is 2. So, when we factor f(x)=2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn), then the expansion will have coefficients scaled by 2.\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is 2*(-sum of ri).
