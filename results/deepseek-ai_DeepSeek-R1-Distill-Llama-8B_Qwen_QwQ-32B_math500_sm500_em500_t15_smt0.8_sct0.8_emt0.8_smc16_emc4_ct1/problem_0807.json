            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}| for a polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients. The polynomial is given by f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0. I know that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. Also, all the roots of the polynomial are distinct integers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, it must be a product of linear factors with integer roots. So, if the roots are r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, each r_i is an integer, and f(x) can be written as f(x) = 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n). Here, the leading coefficient is 2, so the constant term a_0 would be 2*(-1)^n times the product of all the roots. Given that a_0 is 66, I can write:\n\n2*(-1)^n * r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n = 66.\n\nSo the product of the roots, multiplied by (-1)^n and divided by 2, equals 66. Let's write that as:\n\nr_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n = 66 * (-1)^n / 2.\n\nBut since the product of integers on the left must be an integer, 66 must be divisible by 2 when multiplied by (-1)^n. So, 66 * (-1)^n must be even, which is always true because 66 is even. So, 66 * (-1)^n / 2 is an integer, which means the product r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n is an integer.\n\nWait, actually, let's correct that. The equation is:\n\nf(x) = 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0.\n\nSo, the constant term a_0 is 2*(-1)^n*r_1*r_2*...*r_n. Since a_0 is 66, we have:\n\n2*(-1)^n*(r_1*r"

Therefore, the product of roots is either 33 or -33 depending on the sign from (-1)^n. But actually, the exact sign might not matter as much as the magnitude here.\n\nOur task is to minimize |a_{n-1}|. Let's recall that in the expansion of the polynomial, a_{n-1} is the coefficient of x^{n-1}. For a monic polynomial (leading coefficient 1), the coefficient of x^{n-1} is - (sum of the roots). However, since the leading coefficient here is 2, the polynomial is 2 times the monic polynomial with roots r_i. Therefore, the coefficient a_{n-1} would be 2 times the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the monic polynomial. Let me think again.\n\nLet me write f(x) as 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n). Let me denote the monic polynomial as P(x) = (x - r_1)...(x - r_n). Then f(x) = 2*P(x). Therefore, the coefficients of f(x) will be 2 times the coefficients of P(x), except that the leading coefficient is 2*1 = 2. The coefficient a_{n-1} in f(x) is 2 times the coefficient of x^{n-1} in P(x). \n\nIn the monic polynomial P(x), the coefficient of x^{n-1} is - (sum of roots). Therefore, in f(x), the coefficient a_{n-1} is 2*(-sum of roots). Wait, no. Wait, let me confirm.\n\nLet me consider a simple case: suppose P(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n). Expanding this, the coefficient of x^{n-"

Therefore, f(x) = 2*P(x) will have a coefficient of 2*(- (r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)) for x^{n-1}, so a_{n-1} = 2*(-sum of roots) = -2*(sum of roots). So, |a_{n-1}| = |sum of roots|*2.\n\nSo, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, I need to find the roots r_i such that the sum of r_i is as close to zero as possible, because |a_{n-1}| is 2 times the absolute value of the sum. Therefore, I need to choose roots whose sum is minimized in absolute value.\n\nAdditionally, the product of the roots times 2*(-1)^n equals 66, so the product of the roots is 33*(-1)^n. So, the product is either 33 or -33. Since the product of integers is 33 or -33, so we need to think about how to factor 33 into integer factors, keeping in mind that the roots are distinct integers.\n\nFirst, let's factor 33. 33 factors into 1, 3, 11, 33. Also, considering negative factors, so the product can be 33 or -33.\n\nSince the product can be positive or negative, depending on the number of negative roots. Since the roots can have both positive and negative signs, we can get either a positive or negative product.\n\nBut since 33 is positive, we can have the number of negative roots even (so that product is positive) or odd (so product is negative). However, in our equation, the product is 33*(-1)^n, so it can be positive or negative depending on n.\n\nWait, maybe I should think more clearly. Since f(x) is 2*(x - r_1)...(x - r_n), the constant term is 2*(-1)^n*(r_1*...*r_n) = 66. So, r_1*...*r_n = 66 / [2*(-1)^n] = 33*(-1)^{n+1}. So, the product is either 33 or -33.\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33.\n\nSo"

Also, since they have to be distinct integers, we need to find sets of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and then find among all such sets the one with the minimal absolute sum.\n\nThe minimal |sum| would lead to minimal |a_{n-1}|.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and the sum of those integers has the smallest absolute value. Then, 2 times that minimal |sum| is the minimal |a_{n-1}|. Therefore, I need to consider both cases where the product is 33 and -33 and see which gives a smaller |sum|.\n\nFirst, let's consider when the product is 33. Let's think about all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 33. The prime factors of 33 are 3 and 11. Also, 1 and -1 can be used as factors, but they have to be distinct.

But they have to be distinct. Wait, need distinct integers.\n\nPossible factorizations into distinct integers:\n\n- 33 = 33 * 1, but only two factors. The roots would be 33 and 1, but since coefficients are integers, but also need the leading coefficient 2, so maybe that's okay. Wait, but we can have more factors.

But product is 33.\n\nAlternatively, can we factor into more terms?\n\nSince 33 = 3 * 11, but 1 is needed if we want more factors.
