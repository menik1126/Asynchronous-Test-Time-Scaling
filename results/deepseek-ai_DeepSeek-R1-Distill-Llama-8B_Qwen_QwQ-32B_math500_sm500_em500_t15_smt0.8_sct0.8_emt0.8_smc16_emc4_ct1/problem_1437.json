In this case, the exponent is 24.\n\nThis means that \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24. I'll list all the positive divisors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that \\( n > 1 \\), so I exclude 1 from the list. This leaves the possible values of \\( n \\) as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nFinally, I'll count these valid values of \\( n \\). There are 7 such integers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) satisfy the condition that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**:\n   - We need to find all positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that there exists an integer \\( k \\) where \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\).\n   \n2. **Prime Factorization Insight**:\n   - The number \\( 2^{24} \\) is already expressed in its prime factorized form.\n   - For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent in its prime factorization (which is 24) must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n   \n3. **Determine Divisors of 24**:\n   - Find all positive"
