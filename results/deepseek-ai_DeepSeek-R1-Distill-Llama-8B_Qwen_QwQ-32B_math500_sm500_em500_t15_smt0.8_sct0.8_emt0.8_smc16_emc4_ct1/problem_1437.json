Since \\( 2^{24} \\) is already a power of a prime number, the entire expression can be written as \\( (2^k)^n \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nSetting \\( 2^{24} = (2^k)^n \\) allows me to equate the exponents, resulting in \\( 24 = k \\times n \\). This means that \\( k \\) must be a divisor of \\( 24 \\) for \\( n \\) to be a positive integer greater than 1. \n\nNext, I'll list all positive divisors of \\( 24 \\). These are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. However, since \\( n \\) must be greater than 1, I'll exclude 1 from the list, leaving the possible values of \\( k \\) as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nEach of these values of \\( k \\) corresponds to a unique \\( n \\) by solving the equation \\( 24 = k \\times n \\). Therefore, there are 7 possible values for \\( n \\) that satisfy the condition. These values are \\( n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, \\) and \\( 24 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   We need to find all positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( (a)^n \\) for some integer \\( a \\).\n\n2. **Express \\( 2^{24} \\) as a Perfect Power:**\n   Since \\( 2^{24} \\) is already a power of a prime number, it's already a perfect power. Let's represent it as \\("
