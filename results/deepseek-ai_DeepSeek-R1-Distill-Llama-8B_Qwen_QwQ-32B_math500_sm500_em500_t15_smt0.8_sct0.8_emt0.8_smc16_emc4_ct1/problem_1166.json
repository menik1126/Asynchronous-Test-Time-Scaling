We can simplify this using the rule:\n   \\[\n   (a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\n   \\]\n   \n   Applying this to \\((3^k)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6 \\times k} = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   \n   Now, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   3^{6k} = 3^6\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the bases are the same (\\(3\\)), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\(k\\)**:\n   \n   To find \\(k\\), divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1}\n   \\]"
