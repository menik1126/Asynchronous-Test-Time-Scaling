Applying this property to the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{k \\times 6} = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Exponents Equal:**\n   \n   Since the bases are the same (\\( 3 \\) in both cases), set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\):**\n   \n   To find the value of \\( k \\), divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\nk = \\boxed{1}\n\\]"
