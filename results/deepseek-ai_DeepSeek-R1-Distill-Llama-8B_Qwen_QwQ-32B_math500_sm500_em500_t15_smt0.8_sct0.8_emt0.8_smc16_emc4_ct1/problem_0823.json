            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Hmm, let's see. I remember that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity, right? One is 1 itself, and the other two are complex numbers. So, ω can be either 1, or the other two roots. \n\nSince the problem doesn't specify which root ω is, I think I need to consider all cases. But maybe some of them will lead to the same result. Let me recall the properties of cube roots of unity. I think they satisfy the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0 for the non-real roots. So, if ω is not equal to 1, then ω² + ω + 1 = 0.\n\nWait, that might be useful. Let me write that down: If ω ≠ 1, then ω² + ω + 1 = 0, which implies ω² = -ω - 1. Maybe I can use this to simplify the expression.\n\nSo, the expression is \\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\] Let's first consider the case when ω = 1. Then, substituting ω = 1, the expression becomes \\[\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1.\\] Okay, so if ω is 1, the sum is 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the other case where ω is a primitive cube root of unity, meaning ω ≠ 1. Then, as I wrote earlier, ω² + ω + 1 = 0. Maybe I can use this equation to simplify the denominators.\n\nLet me handle each term separately. First, consider \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\). I can multiply the numerator and denominator by something to make it easier. Since ω² = -ω -1, perhaps multiplying by ω² might help. Wait, let me try that.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by ω²:\n\n\\[\\frac"

Since ω³ = 1, this becomes ω² + 1. Hmm, so the denominator is ω² + 1. But from the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0, we can write ω² = -ω -1. Therefore, substituting that in, the denominator becomes (-ω -1) + 1 = -ω. So the denominator is -ω, so the whole term becomes ω² / (-ω) = -ω² / ω = -ω. Wait, hold on, let me check that again.\n\nWait, let's go step by step. Let me compute the denominator again:\n\n(1 + ω) * ω² = ω² + ω³ = ω² + 1 (since ω³ =1). Then, since ω² = -ω -1, substituting that in gives:\n\nω² +1 = (-ω -1) +1 = -ω. So denominator is -ω. Therefore, the numerator is ω², so the term is ω² / (-ω) = -ω² / ω = - (ω² / ω). Since ω² / ω = ω^(2-1) = ω^1 = ω. So that term becomes -ω. \n\nWait, so \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\) becomes -ω? That seems a bit strange, but let me check with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use the equation ω² + ω +1 =0 to manipulate the denominator.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the sum directly. Let me write the two fractions:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\]\n\nLet me find a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²). The common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute the numerator:\n\n1*(1 + ω²)"

So the entire fraction becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{2 + \\omega + ω²}{2 + ω + ω²} = 1.\\]\n\nWait, so that sum is 1? But wait, when ω=1, we also got 1. So regardless of whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root of unity, the sum is 1. So, the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut that seems conflicting with my earlier thought where I tried to compute \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega}\\) and got -ω. Maybe I made a mistake there.

But ω² = -ω -1, so substituting, denominator is (-ω -1) +1 = -ω. So denominator is -ω, so overall, the fraction is ω² / (-ω) = -ω.\n\nWait, that gives 1/(1 + ω) = -ω. But then, let's check 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nUsing the same approach, 1/(1 + ω²) × (ω)/ω = ω / ( (1 + ω²) ω ). Now, expanding denominator: ("

Multiply numerator and denominator by ω:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} \\times \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega} = \\frac{\\omega}{(1 + \\omega^2)\\omega} = \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega + \\omega^3}.\\]\n\nSince ω^3 =1, that's ω/(ω +1). Hmm, so that's ω/(1 + ω). But then, if I have 1/(1 + ω) = -ω, then ω/(1 + ω) would be ω*(-ω) = -ω². \n\nWait, so then 1/(1 + ω²) would be -ω²? Let me check that again.

So that matches the previous result. \n\nTherefore, whether I compute directly by common denominator or by manipulating each term, I get the same result of 1. \n\nWait, so does that mean that regardless of which cube root of unity ω is (except 1?), but even when ω is 1, the sum is"

Let me try taking ω as another cube root of unity. Let me pick ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = (-1/2) + i (√3/2). Then ω^2 is the other root, which is e^(4πi/3) = (-1/2) - i (√3/2).\n\nLet me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω:\n\n1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1 - 1/2 + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² is 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, let me compute 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2).

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but I might wonder if I made a mistake in the initial calculation when I thought it could be different. But all approaches so far point to 1 being the answer. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for cube roots of unity, 1, ω, ω² are the roots of x³ -1 =0, so x² +x +1=0 for ω and ω².\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution. Let me denote S as the sum:\n\nS = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nLet me try to express S in terms of ω. As done before, I can write S as [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ].\n\nWhich is (2 + ω + ω²) / (1 + ω + ω² + ω^3).\n\nBut since ω^3 =1, so denominator is 1 + ω + ω² +1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo the fraction becomes (2 + ω + ω²)/(2 + ω + ω²) = 1.
