            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. That means ω can be either 1, or the other two complex roots. But wait, if ω is a cube root of unity, then ω ≠ 1, right? Because 1 is already a root, but the other two are primitive roots. So ω can be either the primitive first root or the primitive second root. Wait, actually, cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1. Also, I recall that ω² is the complex conjugate of ω because they are roots of the same polynomial.\n\nSo, there are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². Therefore, I need to evaluate the given expression for each of these roots. But maybe instead of evaluating for each, I can find a general expression that works for ω and ω².\n\nLet me consider that expression: 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Maybe I can find a common denominator or manipulate it somehow.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression:\n\nE = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nI can combine these two fractions by finding a common denominator. The common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So,\n\nE = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ].\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nNow, the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut wait, ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, the denominator becomes:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω"

But let me check again.\n\nWait, let me verify the denominator again step by step. Let me expand (1 + ω)(1 + ω²):\n\nFirst term: 1*1 = 1,\n\nSecond term: 1*ω² = ω²,\n\nThird term: ω*1 = ω,\n\nFourth term: ω*ω² = ω³.\n\nSo, adding all terms: 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nSince ω³ = 1, substitute that in: 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = (1 + 1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (ω + ω²).\n\nTherefore, denominator is 2 + ω + ω², which is the same as the numerator. So indeed, the numerator and denominator are the same, so E = 1. Hmm, so does that mean the expression is always equal to 1?\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check if there are any restrictions. For example, if ω = 1, then the original expression would be 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that works. But ω can also be the other roots, so let me check with ω being a primitive root.\n\nLet me take ω = e^(2πi/3), which is a primitive cube root of unity. Then ω² = e^(4πi/3). Let me compute the expression numerically to check.\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω. Let's see, ω is -1/2 + i√3/2, so 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2. The reciprocal of that would be (1/(1/2 + i√3/2)). Let me compute that.\n\nThe modulus squared of the denominator is (1/2)^2 + (√3/2"

            "model": "small",
            "output": ")^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, so the modulus is 1. Therefore, 1/(1/2 + i√3/2) is the complex conjugate divided by the modulus squared, which is (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2. So the reciprocal is 1/(1/2 - i√3/2) = (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nNow, adding these two reciprocals: (1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = (1/2 + 1/2) + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, even when ω is a primitive cube root of unity, the expression still equals 1. Therefore, regardless of whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², the expression equals 1.\n\nWait, but let me check with ω². So if ω² = e^(4πi/3) = (-1/2 - i√3/2), let me compute 1 + ω²: 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2. As before, 1/(1 + ω²) is 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω is 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2, so reciprocal is 1/2 - i√3/2. Adding these two gives 1 again.\n\nSo, in all cases, the expression equals 1.\n\nWait, but is this possible? Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that it's the same for all roots. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use algebra to manipulate the expression.\n\nWe know that ω³ = 1, so 1 + ω + ω² = 0.\n\nThat's a key identity with cube roots of unity.

Since ω + ω² = -1, so the numerator is 2 - 1 = 1, and the denominator is also 1. Therefore, E = 1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is (including ω = 1), the expression always equals 1.\n\nWait, but if ω = 1, then 1/(1 + ω) is 1/2, and 1/(1 + ω²) is also 1/2, adding to 1. Similarly, if ω is the primitive root, as checked earlier, it also gives 1. So in all cases, the expression is 1.\n\nIs there a way this could be different? Wait, perhaps I can think of another approach. Let me consider the original expression:\n\nE = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nLet me try to express this in terms of ω. Since 1 + ω and 1 + ω² can be expressed as 1 + ω and 1 + ω². Maybe I can rationalize the denominators or something.\n\nAlternatively, I might express the denominators in terms of ω's minimal polynomial. Since 1 + ω is the denominator, and ω satisfies ω² + ω + 1 = 0. So, 1 + ω = -ω².\n\nWait, let's check that. From ω² + ω + 1 = 0, so ω² = -ω - 1. Therefore, 1 + ω = -ω². Hence, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(-ω²) = -1/ω².\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = -ω, because from the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0, we can write 1 + ω² = -ω. Hence, 1/(1 + ω²) = -1/ω.\n\nSo, substituting back into E:\n\nE = -1/ω² + (-1/ω) = - (1/ω + 1/"

So that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the expression simplifies to 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all possible values\". Since ω is a cube root of unity, but when ω = 1, the expression is 1, and when ω is the other roots, it's also 1. So the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nHmm, but let me check once more. Let me try plugging in ω = 1. Then the expression is 1/(1+1) + 1/(1+1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. If ω is a primitive root, say ω = e^(2πi/3), then as I did before, the expression is 1. So indeed, in all cases, it's 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. So the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values\". Since ω^3 = 1, so ω can be 1, ω, or ω². But in all cases, the expression gives 1, so there's only one possible value. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that when ω is 1, the expression is valid. Let me check the denominators. If ω = 1, then 1 + ω = 2, so no division by zero. Similarly, 1 + ω² = 2. So denominators are okay. So all three roots are allowed, and in all cases, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1. So the answer is 1.\n\nI think that's solid. I tried multiple approaches: algebraic manipulation using the identity of"
