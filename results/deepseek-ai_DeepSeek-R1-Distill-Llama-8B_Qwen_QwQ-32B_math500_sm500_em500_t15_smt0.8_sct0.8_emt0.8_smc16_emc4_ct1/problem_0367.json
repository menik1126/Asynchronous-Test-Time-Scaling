This means the new number of blue marbles is 4x + 5, and the new number of yellow marbles is 3x - 3.\n\nSetting up the equation based on the new ratio: (4x + 5)/(3x - 3) = 7/3.\n\nCross-multiplying and simplifying the equation: 12x + 15 = 9x - 9.\n\nSolving for x: 3x = -24, so x = -8.\n\nFinally, calculating the initial number of blue marbles: 4x = 4 * (-8) = -32.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Initial ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles:** 4:3\n- **After adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles:**\n  - **New ratio becomes:** 7:3\n\n**Let’s define the variables:**\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of **blue marbles** in the initial ratio.\n- Let \\( 4x \\) be the initial number of **blue marbles**.\n- Let \\( 3x \\) be the initial number of **yellow marbles**.\n\n**After the change:**\n- **Blue marbles added:** 5\n- **Yellow marbles removed:** 3\n- **New number of blue marbles:** \\( 4x + 5 \\)\n- **New number of yellow marbles:** \\( 3x - 3 \\)\n\n**Set up the equation based on the new ratio:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Cross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\):**\n\\[\n3(4x + 5) = 7(3x - 3)\n\\]\n\\[\n12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\\]\n\n**Solve for \\( x \\):**\n\\[\n15 + 21 = 21x - 12x\n\\"
