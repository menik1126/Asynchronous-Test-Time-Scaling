A is directly north of O, B is directly west of O, C is directly south of O, and D is directly east of O. The distance between C and D is 140 meters. There's a hot-air balloon at point H, which is directly above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. The lengths of HC and HD are given as 150 meters and 130 meters, respectively. \n\nThe goal is to replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. We need to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the setup. Points A, B, C, D form a rectangle around point O, with A north, B west, C south, and D east. So, O is the center, and H is above O. The ropes from H to each of these points (A, B, C, D) keep the balloon in place. \n\nSince the balloon is held in all directions by these ropes, that means the balloon must be positioned such that all ropes are taut, right? Without any additional information, I might assume that the balloon is directly above O, but since H is already described as being directly above O, that makes sense.\n\nNow, originally, there are four ropes: HA, HB, HC, HD. Two of these, HC and HD, are 150 m and 130 m long, respectively. If we want to replace these two ropes with one rope HP, the idea is to find a point P along the line CD such that the total length of rope used for HC and HD (which is 150 + 130 = 280 m) is reduced as much as possible by using a single rope HP.\n\nTo find the maximum rope saved, we need to minimize the total length of HP. The minimal total length would be the straight line distance from H to P, where P is somewhere along CD. But wait, P is on CD, so the minimal HP is just the straight line from H to CD. That would give us the minimal rope length, which would save the most rope.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. The balloon must still be held in place by"

The problem states that the balloon remains at the same position H above O, so the other ropes (HA and HB) are still there, but HC and HD are replaced by HP. Therefore, the position of P must be such that the rope HP can hold the balloon in place along with HA and HB. However, since the problem doesn't mention any constraints on the forces or angles, maybe we can just consider the geometric problem of minimizing HP such that P is on CD, and then the saved rope is (HC + HD) - HP. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible HP where P is on CD, and then the maximum saved length is (150 + 130) - HP. So, the key is to find the minimal HP, which is the shortest distance from H to the line CD. Since H is directly above O, we can model this in coordinates.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let’s let O be at the origin (0,0). Since A is north, B is west, C is south, D is east, so:\n\n- Let’s denote coordinates:\n\n- O is (0,0).\n\n- Let’s let the coordinates of A be (0, a), since it's north of O.\n\n- Similarly, B is west, so coordinates (-b, 0).\n\n- C is south, so (0, -c).\n\n- D is east, so (d, 0).\n\nBut the problem says the distance between C and D is 140 m. The distance between C (0, -c) and D (d, 0) is sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2) = sqrt(d² + c²) = 140 m.\n\nAlso, the ropes HC and HD have lengths 150 m and 130 m. Since H is directly above O, let's denote H as (0,0,h), where h is the height above O. Wait, actually, in 3D coordinates, but since the problem is in a flat field, maybe we can model it in 2D with H above O. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since all the points A, B, C, D are on the ground (the flat field), and H is above O."

Maybe not.\n\nWait, actually, in 3D, the minimal distance from a point to a line is calculated as the norm of the cross product of vectors divided by the norm of the direction vector. Let's recall the formula.\n\nGiven a line defined by two points C and D, and a point H not on the line, the minimal distance from H to the line CD is |(D - C) × (H - C)| / |D - C|.\n\nSince we're dealing with 3D coordinates, let me write it out.\n\nLet me denote vectors:\n\nVector CD = D - C = (d, 0 - (-c), 0 - 0) = (d, c, 0).\n\nVector CH = H - C = (0 - 0, 0 - (-c), h - 0) = (0, c, h).\n\nThe cross product CD × CH is determinant:\n\n|i    j     k|\n|d    c     0|\n|0    c     h|\n\n= i*(c*h - 0) - j*(d*h - 0) + k*(d*c - 0*c)\n= (c h)i - (d h)j + (d c)k\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt( (c h)^2 + (d h)^2 + (d c)^2 )\n\nThe norm of CD is sqrt(d² + c²) = 140, as given.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is |CD × CH| / |CD| = sqrt( (c² h²) + (d² h²) + (d² c²) ) / 140.\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nsqrt( h²(c² + d²) + d² c² )\n\nBut since c² + d² = (140)^2 = 19"

The line CD is in the ground plane. The point P is on CD, so its coordinates are (x,y) lying on CD. The distance from H to P is sqrt(x² + y² + h²). To minimize this, we can minimize sqrt(x² + y² + h²). Since h is fixed, this is equivalent to minimizing sqrt(x² + y²), which is the distance from O to P. Therefore, the minimal distance from H to CD is sqrt( (minimal distance from O to CD)^2 + h^2 ).\n\nWait, that's a better approach. Since the minimal distance from H to the line CD is the hypotenuse of the minimal horizontal distance from O to CD and the vertical distance h.\n\nTherefore, first, compute the minimal distance from O to the line CD, then the minimal HP is sqrt( (distance)^2 + h^2 ).\n\nSo, let's compute the minimal distance from O to CD.\n\nThe line CD connects points C(0, -c) and D(d, 0).

Let me think differently.\n\nWe have HP_min= sqrt(14,406.25)=120.05625.\n\nYes, because 120^2=14,400, so sqrt(14,406.25)=120 + (6.25)/ (2*120)=120 +6.25/240≈120.026.\n\nWait, but 120.026²≈(120)^2 +2*120*0.026 +0.026²=14,400 +6.24 +0.000676≈14,406.240676.\n\nWhich is close to14,406.25, so HP_min=120.026.\n\nWait, more accurately, 120.026^2≈14,406.25.\n\nThus, HP_min≈120.026 m.\n\nThus, the saved length is280 -120.026≈159.974 m.\n\nSo, approximately159.974 m, which is very close to160 m.\n\nTherefore, the maximum rope that can be saved is approximately160 meters.\n\nBut to be precise, 159.974 m.\n\nBut perhaps we can express this exactly as 159.94375 m, but that's not a whole number.\n\nWait, 159.94375 is approximately160 -0.05625.\n\nBut anyway, the problem is asking for the greatest length saved, so likely the answer is160 meters.\n\nTherefore, the greatest length of rope that can be saved is160 meters.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved by replacing ropes \\( HC \\) and"
