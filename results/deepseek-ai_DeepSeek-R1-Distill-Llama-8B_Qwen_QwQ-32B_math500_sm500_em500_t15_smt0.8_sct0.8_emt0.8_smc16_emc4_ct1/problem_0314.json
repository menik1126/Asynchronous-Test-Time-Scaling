            "output": "Alright, so I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 - 5x -14), and then add them together to find a + b + c. Let's start by recalling what vertical and horizontal asymptotes are.\n\nVertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I should factor the denominator to find these x-values. The denominator is x\u00b2 -5x -14. Let me try factoring that.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm,  Let's see:  -7 and +2. Because (-7) * 2 = -14, and (-7) + 2 = -5. So, the denominator factors as (x -7)(x + 2). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = 7 and x = -2. So, a = 7 and b = -2.\n\nNow, for the horizontal asymptote, I remember the rules for rational functions. The horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The degree of the numerator here is 1 (because it's 2x), and the denominator is 2 (since it's a quadratic). Since the degree of the denominator is higher by 1, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nSo, the leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1 (from x\u00b2). Therefore, the horizontal asymptote y = c is c = 2/1 = 2. So, c = 2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If the degree of the denominator is higher by exactly 1, the horizontal asymptote is indeed the ratio of the leading coefficients. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nSo, now I have a = 7, b = -2, and c = 2. Now, the problem asks for a + b + c. Let's add them up: 7 + (-2) + 2. So, 7 - 2 is 5, and 5 + 2 is 7. Therefore, a + b + c equals 7.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just walk through again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Factoring the denominator: x"

Correct. \n\nHorizontal asymptote: numerator degree is 1, denominator is 2. Since denominator degree is higher, the horizontal asymptote is y=0? Wait, hold on! Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nThe horizontal asymptote rule is: if the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. If they are equal, it's the ratio of leading coefficients. If the numerator is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote (but maybe an oblique one). \n\nWait, so in this case, numerator degree is 1, denominator is 2. Since 1 < 2, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So c is 0, not 2. Oh no! I messed that up earlier. \n\nSo that means c is actually 0. So my previous calculation was wrong. Let me recalculate. \n\nSo a =7, b = -2, c =0. Then a + b + c = 7 + (-2) +0 =5. \n\nHmm, so I need to correct that. Let me see why I thought it was 2 before. I think I confused the case when the degrees are equal. Since when degrees are equal, you take the ratio of leading coefficients, but here since denominator is higher, it's y=0. \n\nSo the horizontal asymptote is y=0. Therefore, c is 0. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 7 + (-2) +0 =5. \n\nWait, so I need to make sure. Let me think again. \n\nThe function is 2x over x\u00b2 -5x -14. As x approaches infinity, the denominator grows much faster than the numerator. So the value of the function approaches 0. So yes, horizontal asymptote at y=0. \n\nTherefore, c is 0. \n\nSo the sum is 7 + (-2) +0 =5. \n\nHmm, so my first answer was wrong because I confused the horizontal asymptote rule. So the correct answer is 5. \n\nLet me check once more. \n\nVertical asymptotes"

So c=0.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 7 + (-2) +0 =5. \n\nWait, no, 7 + (-2) is 5, and 5 +0 is 5. So the final answer is 5.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Factor denominator: x\u00b2 -5x -14 = (x -7)(x +2). Thus, vertical asymptotes at x=7 and x=-2.\n\n2. For horizontal asymptote, since degree numerator (1) < degree denominator (2), horizontal asymptote is y = 0.\n\n3. Therefore, a=7, b=-2, c=0.\n\n4. Sum: 7 + (-2) +0=5.\n\nSo the answer is 5.\n\nI think that's correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe vertical asymptotes are found by setting the denominator equal to zero, factoring it as (x-7)(x+2), giving x=7 and x=-2. The horizontal asymptote is y=0 because the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator. Adding these together: 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5.\n\n\\boxed{5}"
