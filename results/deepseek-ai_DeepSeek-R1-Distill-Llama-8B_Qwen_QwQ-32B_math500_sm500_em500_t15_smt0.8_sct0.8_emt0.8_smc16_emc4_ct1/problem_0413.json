            "output": "To determine after how many seconds both gears will next have their marks pointing due north, I'll follow these steps. First, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of the two gears. Gear A turns 33 1⁄3 times per minute, and Gear B turns 45 times per minute. To calculate the LCM, I'll convert the fractions to their decimal forms: 33.333... and 45. Since 33.333... is a repeating decimal, I'll represent it as a fraction: 101/3. Now, the problem becomes finding the LCM of 101/3 and 45. To simplify, I'll find the LCM of the numerators (101 and 45) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominators (3 and 1), which is 1. The LCM of 101 and 45 is 101 multiplied by 45, which equals 4545. Therefore, the LCM of 101/3 and 45 is 4545 divided by 3, resulting in 1515. This means that both gears will align after 1515 minutes. Since the question asks for the time in seconds, I'll multiply 1515 minutes by 60 seconds per minute, which gives 90,900 seconds. Thus, the two gears will next have their marks pointing due north after 90,900 seconds.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n- **Gear A** turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute.\n- **Gear B** turns 45 times per minute.\n- Initially, both gears have a mark pointing **due north**.\n- **Question:** After how many seconds will the two gears **next** have both their marks pointing due north?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Gear Rotations:**\n   - **Gear A:** \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) rotations per minute.\n     - Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:\n       \\[\n       33\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{33 \\times 3 + 1}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\text{ rotations per minute}\n       \\]\n   - **Gear B:** 45 rotations per minute.\n\n2. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the Rotations:"
