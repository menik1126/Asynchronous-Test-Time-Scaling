            "output": "To determine when the two gears will both have their marks pointing due north again, I first need to understand how often each gear completes a full rotation.\n\nThe first gear makes 33 and 1/3 rotations per minute. Converting this to seconds, since there are 60 seconds in a minute, I calculate:\n33\u2153 rotations/minute \u00d7 60 seconds/minute = 2000 seconds per full rotation.\n\nThe second gear makes 45 rotations per minute. Similarly, converting this to seconds:\n45 rotations/minute \u00d7 60 seconds/minute = 2700 seconds per full rotation.\n\nNext, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2000 and 2700 to determine when both gears will align again. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.\n\nFirst, I factorize both numbers:\n2000 = 2^4 \u00d7 5^3\n2700 = 2^2 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 5^2\n\nThe LCM is obtained by taking the highest power of each prime number present in the factorizations:\nLCM = 2^4 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 5^3 = 16 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 125 = 54000 seconds.\n\nFinally, to find out how many minutes this is, I divide by 60:\n54000 seconds \u00f7 60 = 900 minutes.\n\nTherefore, both gears will have their marks pointing due north after 900 minutes.\n</think>\n\nTo determine when the two gears will both have their marks pointing due north again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes each gear to complete one full rotation.\n\n1. **Calculate the Rotation Period for Each Gear:**\n\n   - **First Gear:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time per rotation} = 33\\frac{1}{3} \\text{ rotations/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 2000 \\text{ seconds/rotation}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Second Gear:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time per rotation} = 45 \\text{ rotations/minute} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 2700 \\text{ seconds/rotation}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 2000 and 2700:**\n\n   - **Prime"
