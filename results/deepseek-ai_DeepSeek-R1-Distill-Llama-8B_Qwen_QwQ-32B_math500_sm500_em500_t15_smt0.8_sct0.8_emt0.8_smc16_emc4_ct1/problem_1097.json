Hmm, okay, let's try to understand the function step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the definition of f(i,j). There are three cases:\n\n1. When i=0 and j is between 0 and 4, inclusive, then f(0,j) is just mod_5(j+1). Since mod_5 gives the remainder when divided by 5, this means f(0,j) = (j+1) mod 5. So, for j=0, f(0,0)=1; for j=1, f(0,1)=2; j=2, f(0,2)=3; j=3, f(0,3)=4; and j=4, f(0,4)=0.\n\n2. If i >=1 and j=0, then f(i,0) is f(i-1,1). So, this is a recursive call where the second argument increments by 1 when j was 0.\n\n3. The general case for i>=1 and 1<=j<=4 is f(i,j) = f(i-1, f(i,j-1)). That seems a bit more complicated, as it's a nested recursion.\n\nOur goal is f(2015,2). That's a pretty large i, so doing this recursively step by step might not be feasible. Maybe there's a pattern or cycle we can exploit.\n\nLet me try to compute some small values to look for a pattern.\n\nStarting with i=0:\n\nf(0,0)=1, f(0,1)=2, f(0,2)=3, f(0,3)=4, f(0,4)=0.\n\nNow, for i=1:\n\nCompute f(1,0) first: f(1,0)=f(0,1)=2.\n\nThen f(1,1): f(1,1)=f(0, f(1,0))=f(0,2)=3.\n\nSimilarly, f(1,2)=f(0, f(1,1))=f(0,3)=4.\n\nf(1,3)=f(0, f("

Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, f(1,0)=2, which is (0+2)=2,\n\nf(1,1)=3=(1+2),\n\nf(1,2)=4=(2+2),\n\nf(1,3)=0=(3+2)-5=0,\n\nf(1,4)=1=(4+2)-5=1. So yes, f(1,j) = (j+2) mod 5, which is the same as mod_5(j+2). Which is consistent with the initial function definition, since when i=1, j=1, we have f(1,1) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,2) = 3, which is 2+1, which is similar to (1+2).\n\nHmm, so maybe for i=1, f(i,j) is (j + i + 1) mod 5? Wait, in this case, i=1, so j + 1 +1 = j+2, which is correct. Let's test for i=2.\n\nCompute f(2,j) for j=0 to 4.\n\nStart with f(2,0)=f(1,1)=3.\n\nf(2,1)=f(1, f(2,0))=f(1,3)=0.\n\nf(2,2)=f(1, f(2,1))=f(1,0)=2.\n\nf(2,3)=f(1, f(2,2))=f(1,2)=4.\n\nf(2,4)=f(1, f(2,3))=f(1,4)=1.\n\nSo for i=2:\n\nf(2,0)=3,\n\n"
