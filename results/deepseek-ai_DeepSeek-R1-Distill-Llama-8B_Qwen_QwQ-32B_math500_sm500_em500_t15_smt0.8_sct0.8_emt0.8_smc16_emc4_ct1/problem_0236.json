            "output": "First, I need to determine Bill's total displacement in the southern direction. He walks 1/2 mile south twice, which adds up to 1 mile south.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total eastern displacement. Bill walks 3/4 mile east once, so his total eastern displacement is 3/4 mile.\n\nNow, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point. The formula is the square root of (east displacement squared plus south displacement squared).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nDistance = √( (3/4)^2 + (1)^2 )\nDistance = √(0.5625 + 1)\nDistance = √1.5625\nDistance ≈ 1.25 miles.\n\nTherefore, Bill is approximately 1.25 miles away from his starting point in a straight line.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's analyze Bill's movements step by step.\n\n1. **Southward Movement:**\n   - Bill walks \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - Then, he walks another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - **Total Southward Displacement:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile.\n\n2. **Eastward Movement:**\n   - Bill walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n   - **Total Eastward Displacement:** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile.\n\n3. **Calculating the Straight-Line Distance:**\n   - To find the straight-line distance from the starting point, we can use the Pythagorean theorem.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the eastward displacement and \\( y \\) be the southward displacement.\n   - The formula is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + (1)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.25}\n\\]"
