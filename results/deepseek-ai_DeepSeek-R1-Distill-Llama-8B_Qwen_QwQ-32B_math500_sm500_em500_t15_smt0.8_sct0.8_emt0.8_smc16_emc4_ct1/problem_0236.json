Eastward, he walks 3/4 mile.\n\nTo find his displacement in a direct line from the starting point, I use the Pythagorean theorem. The horizontal distance is 3/4 mile, and the vertical distance is 1 mile.\n\nCalculating the displacement:\n\nHorizontal: 3/4 = 0.75 miles\n\nVertical: 1 mile\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDisplacement = sqrt((0.75)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(0.5625 + 1) = sqrt(1.5625) \u2248 1.25 miles\n\nTherefore, Bill is approximately 1.25 miles away from his starting point.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many miles Bill is directly from his starting point, we'll break down his movements step by step and use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the straight-line distance.\n\n**Step 1: Summing the Southward Distances**\nBill walks:\n- \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south\n- Then another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south\n\n**Total Southward Distance:**\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} = 1 \\text{ mile} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Eastward Distance**\nBill walks:\n- \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east\n\n**Eastward Distance:**\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile} = 0.75 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**\nTo find the straight-line distance from the starting point, we consider the southward and eastward movements as the legs of a right triangle.
