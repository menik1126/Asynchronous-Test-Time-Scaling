            "output": "First, I recognize that I need to subtract and add three repeating decimals: 0.777..., 0.444..., and 0.222...\n\nTo simplify, I'll convert each repeating decimal into a fraction. I remember that repeating decimals can be expressed as fractions by using algebra.\n\nStarting with 0.777..., I let x = 0.777... and solve for x: 10x = 7.777..., subtracting gives 9x = 7, so x = 7/9.\n\nNext, for 0.444..., I'll set y = 0.444... and solve: 10y = 4.444..., subtracting gives 9y = 4, so y = 4/9.\n\nSimilarly, for 0.222..., I'll let z = 0.222... and solve: 10z = 2.222..., subtracting gives 9z = 2, so z = 2/9.\n\nNow, I'll perform the arithmetic: 7/9 - 4/9 + 2/9. Combining the numerators, I get (7 - 4 + 2)/9 = 5/9.\n\nFinally, I'll simplify the fraction 5/9 to ensure it's in its lowest terms, which it already is.\n</think>\n\nTo compute \\(0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} + 0.\\overline{2}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert Repeating Decimals to Fractions:**\n   - \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{7}{9}\\).\n   - \\(0.\\overline{4}\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\).\n   - \\(0.\\overline{2}\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{2}{9}\\).\n\n2. **Perform the Arithmetic:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{9} - \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{7 - 4 + 2}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{9}}\n\\]"
