Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that divides both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\). Let me denote this gcd as \\(d\\). So, \\(d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\).\n\nSince \\(d\\) divides both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\), it must also divide any linear combination of these two numbers. That is, \\(d\\) will divide the result when we subtract multiples of one from the other. Maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here, which is a method to find the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying the division algorithm.\n\nLet me try that. The Euclidean algorithm states that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b)\\). So, applying it here, let me set \\(a = 2n + 1\\) and \\(b = n + 7\\). Then, the first step would be to compute \\(a \\mod b\\), which is \\((2n + 1) \\mod (n + 7)\\).\n\nTo compute that, I can express \\(2n + 1\\) in terms of \\(n + 7\\). Let me write \\(2n + 1\\) as \\(2(n + 7) - 13\\). Because \\(2(n + 7) = 2n + 14\\), and if I subtract 13, I get \\(2n + 1\\). So, \\(2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13\\). Therefore, when I divide \\(2n + 1\\) by \\(n + 7\\), the quotient is 2 and the remainder is \\(-13\\). But, in modulo arithmetic, remainders are usually taken as positive, so I can add \\(n + 7\\) to \\(-13\\) to make it positive. Wait, actually, let me correct that. The remainder should be between "

So, perhaps another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write \\(2n + 1 = q(n + 7) + r\\), where \\(q\\) is the quotient and \\(r\\) is the remainder. Let me see, if I take \\(q = 2\\), then \\(2(n + 7) = 2n + 14\\). But \\(2n + 1 = 2n + 14 - 13\\). So that's correct. Therefore, the remainder \\(r = -13\\). But the remainder is usually considered positive, so if I add \\(n + 7\\) to \\(-13\\), that would be \\(n + 7 - 13 = n - 6\\). However, \\(n\\) is a positive integer, so \\(n - 6\\) could be negative or positive depending on the value of \\(n\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me note that if I compute \\(\\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7)\\), it should be equal to \\(\\gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7))\\), right? Because the Euclidean algorithm tells me that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a - k*b)\\) where \\(k\\) is chosen such that the result is smaller.\n\nSo, let's compute \\((2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7)\\). That would be \\(2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13\\). So, \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 13)\\). Because the gcd of \\(n + 7\\) and \\(-13\\) is the same as the gcd of \\(n + 7\\) and 13. Since 13 is a prime number, the gcd can only be either 1 or 13.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) is either 1 or 13, depending on whether \\(n + 7\\) is divisible by 13 or not. So, the greatest possible value of this gcd is 13. Now, I need to check if this is achievable, i.e., whether there exists an \\(n\\) such that \\(\\gcd(n + 7, "

Let me write that down:\n\n1. \\(13 \\mid (n + 7)\\) implies \\(n + 7 = 13k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). Therefore, \\(n = 13k - 7\\).\n2. Also, \\(13 \\mid (2n + 1)\\). Let's substitute \\(n = 13k - 7\\) into this expression:\n   \\(2n + 1 = 2*(13k - 7) + 1 = 26k - 14 + 1 = 26k - 13 = 13*(2k - 1)\\). \n\nSo, \\(2n + 1\\) is indeed divisible by 13. Therefore, whenever \\(n = 13k - 7\\), both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\) are divisible by 13, so their gcd is at least 13. Since 13 is prime, the gcd can't be higher than 13. Therefore, the maximum possible gcd is 13.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Let me choose a value of \\(k\\) such that \\(n\\) is a positive integer. Let's take \\(k = 1\\), then \\(n = 13*1 -7 = 6\\). Let's compute \\(\\gcd(6 +7, 2*6 +1) = \\gcd(13,13) =13\\). That works. \n\nAnother example, \\(k =2\\), \\(n =13*2 -7 =26 -7=19\\). Then, \\(\\gcd(19+7, 2*19 +1)= \\gcd(26,39)\\). The gcd of 26 and 39 is 13, since 26 divides into 39 once with remainder 13, then gcd(26,13)=13. Yep, that works too.\n\nSo, that seems to check out. Therefore, the greatest possible value is 13. \n\nBut wait,"

So, unless 13 divides into 2n +1 and n +7 in some way, it's not possible to get a higher gcd.\n\nAlternatively, another approach. Let me denote \\(d = \\gcd(n +7, 2n +1)\\).
