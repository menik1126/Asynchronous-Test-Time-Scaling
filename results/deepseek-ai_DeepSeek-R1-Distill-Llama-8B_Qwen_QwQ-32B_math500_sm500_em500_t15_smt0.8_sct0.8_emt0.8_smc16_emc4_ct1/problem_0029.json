To simplify this, I'll first convert the complex number to its polar form.\n\nFirst, I'll find the modulus of (1 - i), which is √(1² + (-1)²) = √2.\n\nNext, the argument (angle) of (1 - i) is -45 degrees or 315 degrees, which is 7π/4 radians.\n\nRaising the complex number to the 8th power means raising the modulus to the 8th power and multiplying the argument by 8.\n\nSo, (√2)^8 = (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16.\n\nThe new argument is (7π/4) * 8 = 14π.\n\nSince 14π radians is the same as 0 radians after subtracting multiples of 2π, the resulting angle is 0 radians.\n\nFinally, converting back to rectangular form, the absolute value is 16.\n</think>\n\nRingo is trying to calculate \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\). To solve this, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert to Polar Form**:  \n   First, represent the complex number \\(1 - i\\) in polar form.  \n   - **Modulus (r):**  \n     \\[\n     r = \\sqrt{(1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n     \\]\n   - **Argument (\\(\\theta\\)):**  \n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-1}{1}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians or } 315^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n2. **Raise to the 8th Power**:  \n   When raising a complex number to a power, we raise both the modulus and the argument to that power.  \n   - **Modulus:**  \n     \\[\n     r^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16\n     \\]\n   - **Argument:**  \n     \\[\n     \\theta^8 = \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)^8 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)^8\n     \\]  \n     However, since"
