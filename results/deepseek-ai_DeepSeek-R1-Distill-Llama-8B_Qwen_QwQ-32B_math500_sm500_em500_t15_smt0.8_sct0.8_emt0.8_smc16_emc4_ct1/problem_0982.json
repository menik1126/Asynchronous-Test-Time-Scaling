By multiplying both the numerator and denominator by this conjugate, I can eliminate the imaginary unit \\(i\\) from the denominator, making the division easier to perform.\n\nAfter applying this method, I will separate the real and imaginary parts of the resulting complex number to express the final answer in the standard \\(a + bi\\) format.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:** William Sydney Porter tried to perform the calculation \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\).
