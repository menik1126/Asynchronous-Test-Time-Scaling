First, he multiplies both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \\(1-2i\\), to eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator. \n\nAfter multiplying, the numerator becomes \\(-3(1) + 4i(1) -3(-2i) -4i(-2i)\\), which simplifies to \\(-3 + 4i + 6i + 8i^2\\). Since \\(i^2 = -1\\), this further simplifies to \\(-3 + 10i - 8 = -11 + 10i\\).\n\nIn the denominator, multiplying \\(1+2i\\) by \\(1-2i\\) gives \\(1(1) + 1(-2i) + 2i(1) + 2i(-2i)\\), which simplifies to \\(1 - 2i + 2i - 4i^2\\). Again, \\(i^2 = -1\\), so this becomes \\(1 + 4 = 5\\).\n\nFinally, Braeden divides the simplified numerator by the denominator: \\(\\frac{-11 + 10i}{5} = -\\frac{11}{5} + \\frac{10}{5}i = -\\frac{11}{5} + 2i\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer William Sydney Porter should have obtained is \\(-\\frac{11}{5} + 2i\\).\n</think>\n\nSure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:** William Sydney Porter tried to perform the calculation \\(\\frac{-3+4i}{1+2i}\\).
