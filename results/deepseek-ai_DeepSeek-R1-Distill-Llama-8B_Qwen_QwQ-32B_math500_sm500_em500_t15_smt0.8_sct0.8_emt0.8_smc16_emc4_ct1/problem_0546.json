Each country has a different price for their stamps in the 1970s.\n\nFor Brazil in the 1970s, the price is $12$ cents. For France, it's also $12$ cents. Peru has a price of $6$ cents, and Spain is priced at $13$ cents. \n\nI'll start by calculating the total number of stamps in the 1970s. There are four countries, each with one stamp in that decade.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total cost of all stamps in the 1970s by adding up the prices for each country: $12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43$ cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per stamp in the 1970s, I'll divide the total cost by the total number of stamps: $43 \\div 4 = 10.75$ cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of the stamps issued in the **1970s**, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices for Each Country in the 1970s:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 cents\n   - **France:** 12 cents\n   - **Peru:** 6 cents\n   - **Spain:** 13 cents\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Stamps in the 1970s:**\n   - There are **4** countries (Brazil, France, Peru, Spain).\n\n3. **Compute the Total Cost of All 1970s Stamps:**\n   - **Total Cost** = Brazil's Price + France's Price + Peru's Price + Spain's Price\n   - **Total Cost** = 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = **$43$ cents**\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Price per 1970s Stamp:**\n   - **Average Price** = Total Cost ÷ Total Number of Stamps\n   - **Average Price** = 43 ÷ 4 = **10.75** cents\n\nTo the nearest tenth of a cent, the average price of Juan's **1970s** stamps is:\n\n\\boxed{10.8}"
