            "output": "To determine the number of trailing zeros in 42!, I need to calculate the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of numbers from 1 to 42. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I'll count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of 5s in the factors. I'll divide 42 by 5, which gives me 8.5. Taking the floor of this value, I have 8 fives. Then, I'll divide 42 by 25 to account for higher powers of 5. Dividing 42 by 25 gives me 1.68, and taking the floor results in 1 additional five. Adding these together, there are a total of 9 fives.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 2s in the factors. I'll start by dividing 42 by 2, which equals 21. I'll take the floor to get 21 twos. Then, I'll divide 42 by 4, resulting in 10.5. Taking the floor gives me 10 more twos. I'll continue this process by dividing 42 by 8, 16, and 32, each time taking the floor to accumulate more twos. After performing all these divisions, I find that there are 22 twos in total.\n\nFinally, to find the number of trailing zeros, I'll compare the number of fives and twos. Since there are 9 fives and 22 twos, the limiting factor is the number of fives. Therefore, there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) (42 factorial), we need to calculate the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of integers from 1 to 42.
