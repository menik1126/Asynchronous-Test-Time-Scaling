Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst off, the polynomial is given by:\n\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\n\nAnd I know that:\n\n- The polynomial has integer coefficients, which is important because it restricts the kind of roots and the kind of factors the polynomial can have.\n- All the roots of this polynomial are distinct integers.\n- The leading coefficient a_n is 2, so the polynomial is monic except for the leading term, which is 2.\n- The constant term a_0 is 66.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimal possible value of |a_{n-1}|. So, I need to figure out what a_{n-1} can be, given the constraints, and find the smallest possible absolute value it can take.\n\nLet me recall some properties of polynomials with integer coefficients and integer roots. If a polynomial has integer coefficients and a root at an integer k, then by the Rational Root Theorem, (x - k) is a factor of the polynomial. Since all roots are distinct integers, the polynomial can be expressed as:\n\n$$f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n)$$\n\nWhere each r_i is an integer, and they are all distinct.\n\nGiven that a_0 is 66, which is the constant term, let me think about how that relates to the roots. The constant term of this polynomial is equal to 2 times the product of all the roots, considering the signs. Wait, more precisely, it's 2 times (-1)^n times the product of the roots. Because when you expand the polynomial, the constant term is 2 * (-1)^n * r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n.\n\nBut a_0 is given as 66. So,\n\n$$2 \\times (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 66$$\n\nWhich means,\n\n$$r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = \\frac{66}{2 \\"

Since 33 is positive, if n is even, then (-1)^n is 1, so the product is 33. If n is odd, then (-1)^n is -1, so the product is -33. But since the roots are integers, their product must be an integer, which it is here.\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots (r1 * r2 * ... * rn) must be either 33 or -33. Since the roots are distinct integers, we need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and then figure out the coefficients of the polynomial, particularly the coefficient a_{n-1}, which is the coefficient of x^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me recall Vieta's formula here. The coefficient a_{n-1} is related to the sum of the roots. Specifically, in the expanded form, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is -2 times the sum of the roots multiplied by (-1)^{n-1}? Wait, maybe I need to be more precise.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider the polynomial as:\n\nf(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn)\n\nExpanding this, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is 2 times the sum of the products of the roots taken (n-1) at a time, but with a sign. Wait, actually, let me recall Vieta's formula properly.\n\nFor a monic polynomial (leading coefficient 1) of degree n:\n\nx^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + c0 = (x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn)\n\nThen, the coefficient c_{n-1} is equal to - (r1 + r2 + ... + rn). The coefficient c_{n-2} is the sum of all products of roots two at a time, etc.\n\nBut in our case, the polynomial is 2*(x - r1)...(x - rn). So, the leading term is 2x^n, and the next term"

Let me expand the polynomial a bit.\n\nLet me compute the expansion of 2*(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Let me denote P(x) = (x - r1)...(x - rn). Then, f(x) = 2P(x).\n\nThe expansion of P(x) has coefficients based on the roots:\n\nP(x) = x^n - (r1 + r2 + ... + rn)x^{n-1} + (sum_{i<j} rirj) x^{n-2} - ... + (-1)^n r1 r2...rn.\n\nTherefore, f(x) = 2P(x) = 2x^n - 2(r1 + r2 + ... + rn)x^{n-1} + 2(sum_{i<j} rirj) x^{n-2} - ... + 2(-1)^n r1 r2...rn.\n\nSo, the coefficient a_{n-1} is -2*(sum of roots). Therefore,\n\na_{n-1} = -2(r1 + r2 + ... + rn)\n\nSo, to find |a_{n-1}|, I need to find | -2*(sum of roots)|, which is equal to 2*|sum of roots|. So, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, I need to minimize |sum of roots|. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and whose sum has the smallest possible absolute value.\n\nSo, the key is to find all possible sets of distinct integers (positive and negative) whose product is 33 or -33, and among those, find the set where the sum of the numbers has the smallest absolute value. Once I have such a set, then |sum| multiplied by 2 will give me |a_{n-1}|, and I can find the minimal value.\n\nAlright, so let me note that 33 factors into primes as 3 * 11. Since we need distinct integers, both positive and negative factors can be considered, but they have to multiply to give 33 or -33"

The constant term \\(a_0 = 66\\) implies that the product of the roots (considering the sign) is \\(33\\) or \\(-33\\), depending on whether \\(n\\) is even or odd. \n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, the coefficient \\(a_{n-1}\\) is related to the sum of the roots: \\(a_{n-1} = -2 \\times \\text{(sum of roots)}\\). To minimize \\(|a_{n-1}|\\), we need to find the set of distinct integers whose product is \\(33\\) or \\(-33\\) and whose sum has the smallest absolute value.\n\nAfter examining various combinations, the minimal absolute sum of the roots is found to be \\(7\\) (e.g., the set \\(\\{-3, -1, 11\\}\\) for product \\(33\\) or \\(\\{1, 3, -11\\}\\) for product \\(-33\\)). Thus, the smallest possible \\(|a_{n-1}|\\) is \\(2 \\times 7 = 14\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]"
