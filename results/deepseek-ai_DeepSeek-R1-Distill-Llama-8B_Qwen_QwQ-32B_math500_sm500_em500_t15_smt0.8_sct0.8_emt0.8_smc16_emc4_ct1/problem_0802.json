It has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. I know that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling some basic concepts. Since the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, it must be a monic polynomial if we factor it, but here a_n is 2, so it's not monic. Wait, no, actually, we can think of it as a scaled monic polynomial. Maybe factoring it in terms of its roots would help.\n\nIf the polynomial has distinct integer roots, say r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, then f(x) can be expressed as f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n). Because the leading coefficient is 2, right? So I can write it as 2 times the product of (x - each root).\n\nExpanding this, f(x) would be 2x^n + 2a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + 2a_0. Wait, no, actually, when we expand the product, each term after expansion will have coefficients that are sums and products of the roots, scaled by the leading coefficient.\n\nGiven that a_0 is 66, which is the constant term. When x=0, f(0) = a_0 = 66. So plugging x=0 into the factored form, f(0) = 2*(-r_1)*(-r_2)*...*(-r_n) = 2*(-1)^n*(r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 66.\n\nSo, 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66. That simplifies to (-1)^n*(product of roots) = 33.\n\nSo the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n. Because (-1)^n is either 1 or -1.\n\nAlso, considering that the roots are distinct integers. So I need to find"

The coefficient a_{n-1} in the expanded polynomial is equal to 2*(-sum of roots) if we are considering the monic polynomial, but multiplied by the leading coefficient?\n\nLet me think again. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the polynomial is 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n). Then expanding this, the coefficient of x^{n-1} would be 2*(- (r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)). Wait actually, in the expansion of (x - r_1)...(x - r_n), the coefficient of x^{n-1} is - (r_1 + ... + r_n). Therefore, when multiplied by 2, the coefficient a_{n-1} is -2*(r_1 + ... + r_n). \n\nTherefore, the absolute value of a_{n-1} is 2 times the absolute value of the sum of the roots. So, our goal is to find roots with integer distinct integers, whose product (times 2 and sign) gives 66, and such that the sum of the roots is minimized in absolute value. Wait, but since a_n is 2, so the product of roots (with the sign) is 66/(2) times (-1)^n. Wait, no, actually earlier equation was:\n\nProduct of roots (times (-1)^n) equals 33. So, the product of the roots multiplied by (-1)^n equals 33.\n\nTherefore, product_{i=1}^n r_i * (-1)^n = 33. Therefore, product_{i=1}^n r_i = ±33 depending on n's parity. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, f(0) = 2*(-r1)(-r2)...(-rn) = 2*(-1)^n(r1 r2 ... rn) = a0 = 66\n\nSo, solving for the product:\n\n2*(-1)^n * (r1 r2 ... rn) = 66 => (-1)^"

Since 33 factors into prime factors as 3*11. So, the possible integer roots must be factors of 33. Therefore, the possible roots are the divisors of 33, which are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33.\n\nWait, so the roots can only be among these numbers.

Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the Case 2 (product -33) for size 3:\n\nPossible sets:\n\n- [ -1, 3, 11 ]: product -33, sum 13\n\n- [1, -3, 11 ]: product (1*-3*11)= -33, sum (1-3+11)=9\n\n- [1, 3, -11 ]: product (1*3*-11)= -33, sum (1+3-11)= -7, so absolute 7\n\n- [ -1, -3, 11 ]: product (-1*-3*11)=33, which is not desired.\n\nAh, so the third set [1,3,-11] gives product -33, and sum is -7, so absolute value 7. So that's valid. So, that's a valid set with |sum|=7.\n\nSimilarly, [ -1, -3, -11 ] would have product (-1*-3*-11)= -33, sum (-1-3-11)= -15, absolute 15.\n\nSo, yes, the minimal |sum| for Case 2 is indeed 7.\n\nTherefore, both cases (product 33 and -33) can achieve a minimal |sum| of 7, so the minimal |a_{n-1}| is 2*7=14.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other sets with even smaller sums.\n\nWait, in the four-element sets for product 33, the minimal |sum| was 8, which is worse than 7. So 7 is better.\n\nIs there a five-element set? Let me see again.\n\nSuppose for product 33 (even n), can we have five roots?\n\nLet me try to make five distinct integers multiplying to 33. Let's see:\n\nWe can have 1, -1, 3, -3, 11. The product is 1*(-1)*3*(-3)*11 = (1*-1)*(3*-3)*11 = (-1)*(-9)*1"
