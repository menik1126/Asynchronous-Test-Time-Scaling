All the coefficients are integers, and the roots are distinct integers. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. \n\nHmm, let me think. Since the roots are distinct integers, the polynomial can be factored as f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), where each r_i is an integer, and all are distinct. \n\nTo find a_{n-1}, I remember that in a polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is equal to - (sum of the roots) multiplied by the leading coefficient. So, a_{n-1} = -2(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| is equal to 2 times the absolute value of the sum of the roots. \n\nSo, my goal is to choose distinct integer roots such that when I sum them up and multiply by 2 and take the absolute value, I get the smallest possible value. \n\nWait, but what do I know about the constant term a_0? It's given as 66. From the polynomial factoring, a_0 is equal to 2 times (-1)^n times the product of all the roots. So, a_0 = 2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n. \n\nSince a_0 is positive 66, that means that 2 times (-1)^n times the product of the roots is 66. So, 2 * (-1)^n * (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 66. Which simplifies to (-1)^n * (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 33. Therefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33 depending on whether n is even or odd. \n\nSo, I need to factor 33 or -33 into the product of distinct integers, each contributing to the roots. Remember, the roots can be positive or negative, but they have to be"

Wait, but the roots must be integers. \n\nFirst, let me note that 33 factors into primes as 3*11. But maybe there are other factors. Since the roots can be both positive and negative, I can also consider negative factors. So, the product of the roots must be 33 or -33. Let me see.\n\nFirst case: Let me suppose that (-1)^n is multiplied by the product to get 33. Therefore, if n is even, then the product of the roots must be positive 33. If n is odd, it's -33. Alternatively, maybe I should think of whether n is even or odd can be chosen to make the product match 33 or -33. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach the problem by considering the factors of 66, which is given as a_0. Since the constant term is 66, and the polynomial has leading coefficient 2, so factoring gives me that the product of the roots is (66)/ (2*(-1)^n). Wait, no, let's be precise.\n\nLet me recall that for a polynomial of degree n: f(x) = a_n (x - r_1)...(x - r_n). Then expanding, the constant term is a_n (-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n. \n\nGiven that a_0 is 66, so 66 = a_n (-1)^n (r_1 ... r_n). Since a_n is 2, this gives 66 = 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots). Therefore, dividing both sides by 2: 33 = (-1)^n*(product of roots). Therefore, the product of roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd.\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots must be 33 or -33. So the problem reduces to: choose a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and then find the configuration where the absolute value of their sum is as small as possible.

So, the minimal |sum| would correspond to the roots whose absolute values are as small as possible, but whose product is 33 or -33. \n\nSo, let me think about how to factor 33 into distinct integers.\n\n33 factors as 1 * 3 * 11. But it can also be factored into negative numbers, because (-1)*(-3)*11 = 33, but that would be a product of 33 if n is even, but wait, actually, if we have an even number of negative roots, their product would be positive.\n\nAlternatively, also, 33 can be written as (-1)*(-3)*11, or perhaps with more factors, but all distinct. Wait, but 33 is 3*11, so to factor it into more distinct integers, perhaps including 1 and -1.\n\nWait, but let's see.

So, if n=4, then we can have roots 1, -1, 3, 11, and the product is -33, so (-1)^4*(product) = 33, which matches a_0=66. Alternatively, if n=3, then 1*3*11=33, and with n=3, (-1)^3*(product)= -33, so a_0=2*(-33)= -66, which is not the case. So, in that case, n must be even, meaning to get a positive 33.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf the product of the roots is 33, and n is even, then (-1)^n * product would be positive 33, so a_0"

So, if the product of roots is 33, then (-1)^n must be 1, so n is even. If the product is -33, then (-1)^n must be -1, so n is odd. \n\nTherefore, the product of roots is 33 when n is even, and -33 when n is odd. \n\nTherefore, to get the product of roots as 33, n must be even, and to get -33, n must be odd. \n\nSo, the roots can be arranged in such a way. \n\nNow, the problem is to choose a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33, with the number of roots (degree n) being even or odd accordingly, such that the absolute value of their sum is as small as possible. \n\nOur goal is to minimize |sum|, so that when multiplied by 2, the |a_{n-1}| is minimized. \n\nSo, let's consider possible factorizations of 33 and -33 into distinct integers, and compute their sums. \n\nFirst, let's consider the case where the product is 33 (so n even).
