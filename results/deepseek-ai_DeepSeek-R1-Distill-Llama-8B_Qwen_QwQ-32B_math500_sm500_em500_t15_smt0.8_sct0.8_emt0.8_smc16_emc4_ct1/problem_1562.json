Since the table is square, there are rotational symmetries, which can complicate the counting.\n\nI'll start by fixing the position of one person to eliminate the rotational duplicates. Once one person's seat is fixed, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways.\n\nNext, I need to consider the reflectional symmetry. If two arrangements are mirror images of each other, they should be counted as the same. However, because we've already fixed one person's position, reflections are now considered unique.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is 7!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we must account for rotational and reflectional symmetries.\n\n1. **Fix One Person's Position**:\n   - To eliminate rotational duplicates, fix one person's seat. This reduces the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people.\n\n2. **Arrange the Remaining People**:\n   - The remaining 7 people can be arranged in \\( 7! \\) ways.\n\n3. **Consider Reflections**:\n   - Reflections (mirror images) are considered distinct in this context because we've already fixed one person's seat, thus eliminating identical configurations due to rotation.\n\n**Final Calculation**:\n\\[\n7! = 5040\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements is \\(\\boxed{5040}\\)."
