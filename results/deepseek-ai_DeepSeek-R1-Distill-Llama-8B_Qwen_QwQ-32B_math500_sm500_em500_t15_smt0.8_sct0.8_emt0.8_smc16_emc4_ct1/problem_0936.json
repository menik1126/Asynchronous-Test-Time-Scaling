Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is related to how many times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, each pair of 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero. \n\nFirst, I think I need to find out how many times the number 10 is a factor in 42!. But since 10 is a product of 2 and 5, I should also consider how many times the factors 2 and 5 appear in the prime factors of 42!. However, I remember that in factorials, there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros. That makes sense because every 5 needs a 2 to make a 10, and since 2s are more plentiful, the number of 5s will be the limiting factor.\n\nSo, my next step is to calculate how many times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. That can be done using division and taking the floor of the result. The formula I remember is:\n\nNumber of times 5 appears = floor(42/5) + floor(42/25) + floor(42/125) + ...\n\nWait, let me break that down. The first term, floor(42/5), gives the number of multiples of 5 up to 42. Then, floor(42/25) counts the multiples of 25 (since 25 is 5 squared), which contributes an extra 5 for each multiple. Similarly, floor(42/125) would count multiples of 125, but since 125 is greater than 42, floor(42/125) is 0. So, I don't need to go beyond 25 in this case because higher powers of 5 would exceed 42.\n\nLet me calculate each term:\n\nFirst term: floor(42/5) = 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, so the floor is 8.\n\nSecond term: floor(42/25) = 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, so the floor is 1.\n\nThird term: floor(42/125) = 42 divided by 125 is 0."

So, there are 9 factors of 5 in 42!.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the number of 2s will be more than the number of 5s, so the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s, which is 9.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. The count of 2s in 42! would be higher because there are more even numbers. Let me calculate that just to confirm.\n\nNumber of 2s = floor(42/2) + floor(42/4) + floor(42/8) + floor(42/16) + floor(42/32) + ...\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nfloor(42/2) = 21\n\nfloor(42/4) = 10\n\nfloor(42/8) = 5\n\nfloor(42/16) = 2\n\nfloor(42/32) = 1\n\nfloor(42/64) = 0 (since 64 > 42)\n\nAdding these up: 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39.\n\nSo, there are 39 factors of 2 in 42!. That's way more than the 9 factors of 5, which means the number of trailing zeros is indeed 9.\n\nI think that's it. So, the answer should be 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we count the number of times 10 is a factor. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), and there are typically more 2s than 5s in a factorial, the number of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\n1.
