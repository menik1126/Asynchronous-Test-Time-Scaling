Each trailing zero comes from a factor of 10 in the number, and since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I need to determine how many pairs of 2s and 5s are in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of times 2 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. For the number 2, it appears in 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on up to 42. I'll use the formula for the highest power of a prime number less than or equal to n: \n\nNumber of 2s = ⌊42/2⌋ + ⌊42/4⌋ + ⌊42/8⌋ + ⌊42/16⌋ + ⌊42/32⌋.\n\nCalculating each term: \n- 42 divided by 2 is 21\n- 42 divided by 4 is 10.5, which rounds down to 10\n- 42 divided by 8 is 5.25, which rounds down to 5\n- 42 divided by 16 is 2.625, which rounds down to 2\n- 42 divided by 32 is 1.3125, which rounds down to 1\n\nAdding these together: 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39. So, there are 39 factors of 2 in 42!.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the number of 5s:\n\nNumber of 5s = ⌊42/5⌋ + ⌊42/25⌋ + ⌊42/125⌋.\n\nCalculating each term: \n- 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, which rounds down to 8\n- 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, which rounds down to 1\n- 42 divided by 125 is 0.336, which rounds down to 0\n\nAdding these together: 8 + 1 + 0 = 9. So, there are 9 factors of 5 in 42!.\n\nFinally, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the smaller of the two"

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we'll follow the step-by-step process below:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Formation of Trailing Zeros\nA trailing zero in a number is produced by multiplying 10, and since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), each trailing zero corresponds to a pair of factors 2 and 5 in the number's prime factorization. Therefore, to find the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in its prime factorization.\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of 2s in \\(42!\\)\nThe number of times a prime number \\(p\\) divides \\(n!\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of } p \\text{ in } n! = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor\\) denotes the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\).\n\nFor \\(p = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{8} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{16} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{32} \\right\\rfloor = 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39\n\\]\n\nSo, there are **39** factors of 2 in \\(42!\\).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of 5s in \\(42!\\)\nUsing the same formula for \\(p = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5"
