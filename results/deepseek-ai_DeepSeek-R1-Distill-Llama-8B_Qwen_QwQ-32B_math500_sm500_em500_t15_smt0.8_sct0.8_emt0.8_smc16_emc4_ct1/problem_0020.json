Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that the absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number a + bi is defined as the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So, for the complex number (1 - i), which can be written as 1 - i, the modulus would be sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2). That would be sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). So, the modulus of (1 - i) is sqrt(2). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for (1 - i)^8. I think I can use De Moivre's Theorem here. De Moivre's Theorem says that for any complex number in polar form, (r*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8))^n = r^n*(cos(n\u03b8) + i sin(n\u03b8)). So, if I can express (1 - i) in polar form, I can apply this theorem.\n\nSo, let's convert (1 - i) into polar form. As I found earlier, the modulus r is sqrt(2). Now, the angle \u03b8 is the argument of the complex number. Since (1 - i) is in the fourth quadrant (positive real part, negative imaginary part), \u03b8 would be -45 degrees or 315 degrees, which in radians is -\u03c0/4 or 7\u03c0/4. Alternatively, I can write it as 7\u03c0/4 or -\u03c0/4 because trigonometric functions are periodic.\n\nSo, (1 - i) can be written in polar form as sqrt(2)*(cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)). Now, applying De Moivre's Theorem for the 8th power: [sqrt(2)]^8 * [cos(8*(-\u03c0/4)) + i sin(8*(-\u03c0/4))]. \n\nCalculating [sqrt(2)]^8 first. Since (sqrt(2))^2 is 2, then [sqrt(2)]^8 would be (2)^4, which is 16. \n\nNext, let's compute the angle 8*(-\u03c0/4). That simplifies to -2\u03c0. But angles in trigonometry"

            "output": " are periodic with a period of 2\u03c0, so -2\u03c0 is the same as 0 radians. Therefore, cos(-2\u03c0) is the same as cos(0), which is 1, and sin(-2\u03c0) is the same as sin(0), which is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, [sqrt(2)]^8 * [cos(-2\u03c0) + i sin(-2\u03c0)] becomes 16*(1 + 0i) = 16.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about (1 - i) squared first, then squared again, and so on, but using De Moivre's Theorem seems more straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, when calculating [sqrt(2)]^8, is that correct? Yes, because (sqrt(2))^2 is 2, so (sqrt(2))^8 = (2)^4 = 16.\n\nAnd the angle calculation: 8*(-\u03c0/4) is indeed -2\u03c0, which is coterminal with 0 radians. So, yes, the cosine and sine of that angle would be 1 and 0, respectively. \n\nSo, the result is 16, which is a real number. Therefore, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is 16.\n</think>\n\nRingo should calculate the absolute value of (1 - i) raised to the 8th power. \n\n1. The modulus of (1 - i) is \u221a(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = \u221a2.\n2. Express (1 - i) in polar form: \u221a2 * (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)).\n3. Apply De Moivre's Theorem: (\u221a2)^8 * [cos(8*(-\u03c0/4)) + i sin(8*(-\u03c0/4))].\n4. Simplify: (\u221a2)^8 = 16, and 8*(-\u03c0/4) = -2\u03c0, which is equivalent to 0 radians.\n5. Thus, the result is 16*(1 + 0i) = 16.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{16}."
