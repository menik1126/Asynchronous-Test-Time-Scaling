            "output": "First, I need to calculate the absolute value of (1 - i) raised to the 8th power. To simplify this, I'll convert the complex number from rectangular form to polar form because working with exponents in polar form can make raising them to a power more straightforward.\n\nTo convert (1 - i) to polar form, I should find its modulus and argument. The modulus of (1 - i) is the square root of (1 squared plus 1 squared), which is \u221a2. The argument is arctangent of (-1/1), which is -\u03c0/4 radians.\n\nNow, I have (1 - i) in polar form as \u221a2 multiplied by (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)). Raising this to the 8th power means I raise both the modulus and the argument to the 8th power. The new modulus becomes (\u221a2)^8, which simplifies to 16. The new argument is (-\u03c0/4) multiplied by 8, resulting in -2\u03c0. However, since adding -2\u03c0 is the same as adding 0 in terms of direction, the effective angle is 0 radians.\n\nFinally, converting back from polar form, the absolute value of (1 - i)^8 is the modulus, which is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo find \\[|(1 - i)^8|\\], we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert to Polar Form:**\n   - The complex number \\(1 - i\\) has a modulus (or absolute value) of \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - The argument (or angle) of \\(1 - i\\) is \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) radians because it lies in the fourth quadrant.\n\n   So, in polar form:  \n   \\[\n   1 - i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i \\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Raise to the 8th Power:**\n   - When raising a complex number in polar form to a power, raise the modulus to that power and multiply the argument by the same number.\n   \n   \\[\n   (1 - i)^8 = \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\right)^8 \\left"
