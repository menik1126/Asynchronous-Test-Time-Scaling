The question is asking for the area of the quadrilateral formed by connecting these four points of tangency.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There's a circle given by the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\). That's a circle centered at the origin (0,0) with a radius of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). Then there's a parabola given by \\( y^2 = 8x \\). That's a right-opening parabola with its vertex at the origin, and it's quite wide because the coefficient 8 is large.\n\nThe Asymptote code provided seems to be drawing both the circle and the parabola, along with the common tangents. It shows four points of tangency: points A, B, C, D. Points A and C are (-1,1) and (-1,-1), which are symmetric about the x-axis. Points B and D are (2,4) and (2,-4), also symmetric about the x-axis. So the quadrilateral is a rectangle or something similar due to this symmetry.\n\nHmm, if I connect these four points, it should form a rectangle because of their symmetry. Let me verify that. Points A(-1,1) and B(2,4) – if I plot these, the sides would be from (-1,1) to (2,4), then to (2,-4), then to (-1,-1), and back to (-1,1). Wait, actually, if I plot all four points, the quadrilateral would have sides connecting A(-1,1) to B(2,4), then B to D(2,-4), then D to C(-1,-1), then C back to A. Hmm, that shape might not be a rectangle. Maybe it's a kite or something else. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the slopes of the sides to figure that out.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to approach this problem by finding the equations of the common tangents first, then find their points of tangency, and then compute the area. So let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, to find the common tangents to both the"

Since they have two common tangents, each tangent touches both the circle and the parabola at some points, and those points are the four points of tangency that form the quadrilateral.\n\nLet me recall that the general equation of a tangent line to a parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\) is given by \\( y = mx + \\frac{a}{m} \\), but here our parabola is \\( y^2 = 8x \\), which is similar but with a different coefficient. Let me verify.\n\nWait, the standard parabola is \\( y^2 = 4ax \\). Here, \\( 4a = 8 \\implies a = 2 \\). Therefore, the equation of the tangent to the parabola would be \\( y = mx + \\frac{a}{m} \\) but with a = 2, so \\( y = mx + \\frac{2}{m} \\). Wait, but actually, maybe this applies only for positive m? Hmm, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent to parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\) at a point (x1, y1) is given by \\( yy1 = 4(x + x1) \\). But perhaps it's better to use the condition for a line to be tangent to a parabola.\n\nAlternatively, since we need lines that are tangent to both the circle and the parabola, perhaps we can use the condition for a line to be tangent to a circle and to a parabola, and then set them to have the same slope or something?\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose the equation of the common tangent line is y = mx + c.\n\nFirst, the line must be tangent to the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\). The condition for a line \\( y = mx + c \\) to be tangent to the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\) is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to the radius. The distance from (0,0) to the line is |c| / sqrt(1 + m^2) = radius, which is sqrt(2). So:\n\n|c| / sqrt(1 + m^2) = sqrt(2) => |c| ="

For a line y = mx + c to be tangent to a parabola, the condition is that when we substitute y into the parabola's equation, the resulting quadratic in x has a discriminant equal to zero.\n\nSo, substituting y = mx + c into \\( y^2 = 8x \\):\n\n( mx + c )^2 = 8x\n\nExpanding: m²x² + 2mcx + c² = 8x\n\nBring all terms to one side: m²x² + (2mc - 8)x + c² = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic in x.

So the quadrilateral is formed by connecting A to B to D to C and back to A? Let me see:\n\nThe Asymptote code draws:\n\ndraw(interp(A,B,-0.2)--interp(A,B,1.2)); // this is the line AB extended\n\ndraw(interp(C,D,-0.2)--interp(C,D,1.2)); // line CD extended\n\ndraw(A--C); // vertical line from A to C\n\ndraw(B--D); // vertical line from B to D\n\nSo the figure is formed by the two vertical lines and the two slanted lines. So the quadrilateral is A-B-D-C-A.\n\nSo the order is A, B, D, C.\n\nSo let's apply the shoelace formula with these coordinates in order.\n\nShoelace formula steps:\n\nList the coordinates in order, repeating the first at the end:\n\nA(-1,1), B(2,4), D(2,-4), C(-1,-1), A(-1,1)\n\nCompute the sum of x_i * y_{i+1} minus x_{i+1} * y_i for each i.\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst pair: A to B:\n\nx_i = -1, y_i =1\n\nx_{i+1}=2, y_{i+1}=4\n\nContribution: (-1)(4) - (2)(1) = -4 -2 = -6\n\nSecond pair: B to D:\n\nx_i=2, y_i=4\n\nx_{i+1}=2, y_{i+1}=-4\n\nContribution: 2*(-4) -2*4 = -8 -8 = -16\n\nThird pair: D to C:\n\nx_i=2, y_i=-4\n\nx_{i+1}=-1"

The upper half is the polygon formed by A(-1,1), B(2,4), and the reflection of D over the x-axis, but D is (2,-4), so its reflection is (2,4), which is point B.

So the shoelace formula is reliable here, giving area 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the figure is a rectangle, and I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, if the quadrilateral is a rectangle, then the sides would be of lengths equal to the lengths of the vertical sides and the horizontal sides.\n\nWait, but in reality, the sides aren't all at right angles. Wait, because the sides AB and DC have slopes 1 and -1, meaning that the angles at A and C are not right angles. So it's not a rectangle.\n\nWait, then another thought: maybe the area can be calculated as the product of the lengths of the two common tangents times the distance between them, divided by something.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's overcomplicating. Since the shoelace formula gave 15, which is a straightforward answer, and it was computed correctly, I think 15 is the right answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me go back through the steps.\n\nFirst, equation of the circle: x² + y² =2.\n\nEquation of the parabola: y² =8x.\n\nT"
