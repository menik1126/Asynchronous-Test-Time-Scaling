Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that the circle has its center at the origin (0,0) and a radius of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). The parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\) opens to the right, with its vertex at the origin as well. So both curves pass through the origin, but the circle also extends above and below, while the parabola is symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nNow, the problem states that there are two common tangents, forming four points of tangency. Wait, actually, for two circles or a circle and a parabola, the number of common tangents can vary. In this case, it's two common tangents. So, each tangent touches both the circle and the parabola at exactly one point each, making four points of tangency in total.\n\nMy goal is to find the coordinates of these four points of tangency and then calculate the area of the quadrilateral formed by connecting them.\n\nTo find these points, I should probably find the equations of the common tangents to both the circle and the parabola.\n\nLet me recall that a common tangent to both the circle and the parabola will satisfy both their equations with some condition for tangency, meaning the distance from the center to the line is equal to the radius.\n\nSo, let me assume that the equation of a tangent line to the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\) is \\(y = mx + c\\). Since it's a tangent to the parabola, the condition for tangency is that the discriminant of the system is zero. So, substituting \\(y = mx + c\\) into \\(y^2 = 8x\\):\n\n\\[\n(mx + c)^2 = 8x\n\\]\n\\[\nm^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 - 8x = 0\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic in x. For it to have exactly one solution (tangency), the discriminant must be zero.\n\nThe discriminant \\(D\\) is:\n\\[\nD = (2mc - 8)^2"

So each common tangent touches both the circle and the parabola, so each tangent has two points of tangency, one on the circle and one on the parabola. Since there are two common tangents, that gives four points total.
