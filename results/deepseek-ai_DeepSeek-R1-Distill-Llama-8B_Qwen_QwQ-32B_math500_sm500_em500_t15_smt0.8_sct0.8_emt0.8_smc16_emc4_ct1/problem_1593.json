Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst off, I remember that sometimes when you have equations with cubes, it can be helpful to see if there's a way to simplify or factor them. Maybe there's a common term or something that cancels out. Let me look at the equation again.\n\nOn the left side, we have (x - 3)^3 and (x - 7)^3. On the right, it's (2x - 10)^3. Wait a minute, 2x - 10... that looks like it can be factored. Let me check: 2x - 10 is just 2(x - 5). So, the right side becomes [2(x - 5)]^3. Hmm, maybe I can write both sides in terms of (x - something) to make it easier.\n\nLet me expand both sides to see if that helps. Starting with the left side:\n\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\n\n(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\n(x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343) = 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370\n\nWait, is that right? Let me add the coefficients:\n\nx^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\n\n-9x^2 -21x^2 = -30x^2\n\n27x + 147x = 174x\n\n-27 - 343 = -370\n\nOkay, so left side simplifies to 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370.\n\nNow, the right side is (2x - 10)^3. Let me expand that:\n\n(2x)^3 - 3*(2x)^2*(10) + 3*(2x)*(10)^2 - (10)^3\n\nWhich is 8x^3 -"

Alternatively, let me factor out a -6 to see.\n\nFactoring -6:\n\n-6(x³ -15x² +71.5x -105) = 0\n\nWait, 90 divided by -6 is -15, 426 divided by -6 is 71, and 630 divided by -6 is -105. Hmm, but dealing with decimals is a bit messy. Maybe instead, factor out a common factor of 6, but positive.\n\nWait, 6x³, 90x², 426x, 630. Let's see:\n\nThe coefficients: 6,90,426,630.\n\nDivide each by 6: 1,15,71,105. Hmm, none of these have an obvious common factor. Maybe just leave it"

Add to -630: 0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x -5)(6x² -60x +126) = 0\n\nWait, let me write it:\n\n6x³ -90x² +426x -630 = (x -5)(6x² -60x +126)\n\nNow, let's factor 6x² -60x +126. First, factor out a 6:\n\n6(x² -10x +21)\n\nNow, factor the quadratic: x² -10x +21. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 21 and add to -10. Those are -3 and -7.\n\nSo, x² -10x +21 = (x -3)(x -7)\n\nTherefore, the cubic equation factors completely as:\n\n6(x -5)(x -3)(x -7) = 0\n\nSo, the roots are x=5, x=3, x=7.\n\nWait, but hold on.

So x=5 is also a root.\n\nWait, but I thought sometimes when we factor equations, especially cubics, sometimes we get roots that don't satisfy the original equation because of the manipulations, but here all three roots satisfy. So, seems like x=3,5,7 are the roots.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that (x - 3) + (x -7) = 2x -10. Let me see:\n\n(x - 3) + (x -7) = 2x -10\n\nSo, if a + b = c, then a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b). \n\nThat's the identity I can use here. Let me recall:\n\na³ + b³ = (a + b)³ - 3ab(a + b)\n\nSo in this case, a = x -3, b = x -7, c = 2x -10\n\nSo, (x-3)^3 + (x-7)^3 = (2x -10)^3 - 3*(x -3)*(x -7)*(2x -10)\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n(2x -10)^3 - 3*(x -3)*(x -7)*(2x -10) = (2x -10)^3\n\nSubtracting (2x -10)^3 from both sides:\n\n-3*(x -3)*(x -7)*(2x -10) = 0\n\nSo, either (x -3)=0, (x -7)=0, or (2x -10)=0.\n\nTherefore, solutions are x=3, x=7, x=5.\n\nSo, same answer as before. This method seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, the roots are 3,5,7.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is solved by recognizing the identity for the sum of cubes and factoring, leading to the roots x = 3, 5, and 7.\n\n\\boxed{3, 5, 7}"
