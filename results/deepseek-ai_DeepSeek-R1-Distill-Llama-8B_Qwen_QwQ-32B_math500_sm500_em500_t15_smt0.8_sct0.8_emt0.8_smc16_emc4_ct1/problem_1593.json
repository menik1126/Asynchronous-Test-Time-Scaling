Let me start by understanding what each part of the equation is.\n\nFirst, let me write out the equation again to make sure I have it right:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHm, I notice that on the right side, 2x - 10 can be factored. Let me factor that out. 2x - 10 is the same as 2(x - 5). So, the right side becomes (2(x - 5))^3. Applying the power rule for exponents, that would be 2^3 times (x - 5)^3, which is 8(x - 5)^3. So, the equation becomes:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3.\n\nAlright, now I need to see if I can simplify the left side. The left side has two cubes being added together, and the right side has one cube multiplied by 8. Maybe I can expand both sides and then bring everything to one side to solve for x.\n\nLet me expand (x - 3)^3 first. I remember the expansion formula for (a - b)^3 is a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3. So applying that:\n\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2*3 + 3x*9 - 27. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. It's a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3. So substituting a = x and b = 3:\n\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 3*x^2*3 + 3*x*(3)^2 - (3)^3\n= x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27.\n\nSimilarly, expanding (x - 7)^3:\n\n(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 3x^2*7 + 3x"

Let me expand that:\n\n(x - 5)^3 = x^3 - 15x^2 + 75x - 125.

Let me see if I can factor out a common factor from the coefficients: -6, 90, -426, 630.\n\nLet's see, 6 divides into all coefficients:\n\nDivide each term by 6:\n\n(-6x^3)/6 = -x^3,\n90x^2/6 = 15x^2,\n-426x/6 = -71x,\n630/6 = 105.\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n- x^3 + 15x^2 - 71x + 105 = 0.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as:\n\nx^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0.\n\nWait, I just multiplied both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive. That doesn't affect the roots, just their signs.\n\nSo the equation is now:\n\nx^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to find the roots of this cubic equation. I can try rational root theorem, which says that any rational root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nHere, the constant term is -105, and the leading coefficient is 1. So possible rational roots are the factors of 105, both positive and negative.\n\nFactors of 105: 1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105 and their negatives.\n\nSo possible roots to test are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, etc.\n\nLet me test x=1:\n\n1 - 15 + 71 - 105 = 1 -15 = -14; -14 +71=57; 57 -105 = -48 ≠0.

Perfect, so the cubic factors as (x -3)(x^2 -12x +35).\n\nNow, factor the quadratic: x^2 -12x +35.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add up to -12. The factors of 35 are 1 and 35, 5 and 7. Since it's negative, both numbers are negative. So, -5 and -7: (-5)*(-7) = 35, and (-5) + (-7) = -12.\n\nSo, x^2 -12x +35 = (x -5)(x -7).\n\nThus, the cubic equation factors as (x -3)(x -5)(x -7) = 0.\n\nSo the roots are x = 3, x =5, and x=7.\n\nWait, but let me check these solutions in the original equation to make sure they don't result in any errors, especially considering the original equation had cubes. Although, since all roots will satisfy the equation, they should check out, but just to be thorough.\n\nLet me verify for x=3:\n\nLeft side: (3 -3)^3 + (3 -7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 -64 = -64.\n\nRight side: (2*3 -10)^3 = (6 -10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64.\n\nSo, yes, they are equal.\n\nFor x=5:\n\nLeft side: (5 -3)^3 + (5 -7)^3 = (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 -8 = 0.\n\nRight side: (2*5 -10)^3 = (10 -10)^"
