I need to find the sum of all complex solutions. Hmm, complex solutions usually involve some trick or recognizing a pattern. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's look at the denominators on the left side. They are quadratic terms, each like \\(x^2 - n\\), where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. So, \\(x^2 - 1\\) can be factored as \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\), similarly for others. So, each denominator has two roots: \\(x = \\sqrt{n}\\) and \\(x = -\\sqrt{n}\\).\n\nWait, but the equation is in terms of \\(x^2\\), which suggests that maybe if I set \\(y = x^2\\), the equation becomes a rational function in terms of y. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet \\(y = x^2\\). Then, each term becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but now there's a problem because on the left side, we have terms of y, and on the right, we have x. So, I can't directly write it in terms of y. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nLet me think about the original equation again. It has terms like \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\) for k from 1 to 4. The right-hand side is linear in x: \\(2010x - 4\\). The left side is"

But Vieta's applies to polynomials, so perhaps I need to manipulate the equation into a polynomial equation first.\n\nTo do that, I can multiply both sides by the common denominator to eliminate the fractions. Let's see. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). The common denominator would be the product of all these denominators.

The right side is a polynomial of degree 7 because of the 2010x term multiplied by a degree 6 polynomial. So, moving everything to one side, we have a degree 7 polynomial equation.\n\nBut dealing with a 7th-degree polynomial is going to be messy. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions. In a polynomial equation, the sum of the roots is given by the negative coefficient of the second highest degree term divided by the leading coefficient (Vieta's formula). \n\nSo, if I can write the equation as a polynomial and find the coefficients, I can get the sum of the roots. But since the polynomial is of degree 7, but we have complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs if coefficients are real.\n\nBut wait, are the coefficients real here? Let me check. The original equation is with real coefficients, since all the denominators and the right-hand side are real. So, yes, complex roots will come in conjugate pairs, but when we sum all the roots, the imaginary parts will cancel out, and we will have twice the real parts. But in the case of real coefficients, the sum of all complex roots (counted with multiplicity) is equal to the negative coefficient of the second highest degree term divided by the leading coefficient. Wait, actually, for a polynomial with real coefficients, the sum of all roots (real and complex) is equal to -b/a, where b is the coefficient of x^{n-1} and a is the leading coefficient. But for the sum of complex roots, considering that complex roots come in conjugate pairs, their sum is twice their average, which is a real number.\n\nBut in this case, all roots are complex because the original equation has denominators \\(x^2 -k\\), so the equation is defined for x where \\(x^2 \\neq 1,2,3,4\\). But when multiplied through, the equation becomes a 7th-degree polynomial, so maybe there are 7 roots. But some roots might be real, but not necessarily. \n\nBut regardless, the sum of all roots, according to Vieta, is equal to the coefficient of x^6 term divided by the coefficient of x^7 term, but with a negative sign"

But since \\(y = x^2\\), perhaps there's a relationship between x and y here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the left side is a function of \\(x^2\\), so perhaps the equation is symmetric in some way.

Since D is the product of four quadratics, each of which has leading term \\(x^2\\). So, D is a degree 8 polynomial? Wait, hold on, each denominator is quadratic, so four denominators multiplied together would be degree 8. Wait, but in the original equation, the denominators are four terms, each quadratic, so the common denominator D is indeed (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4), which is a degree 8 polynomial. Wait, but then when I multiplied both sides by D, the LHS becomes a sum of terms each of which is D divided by a quadratic term, so each term is degree 6. Therefore, the LHS after multiplying is a degree 6 polynomial. The RHS is (2010x -4)*D, which is (2010x -4) multiplied by a degree 8 polynomial, so that's degree 9?

Since D includes (x^2 -k) as a factor, so D/(x^2 -k) is the product of the remaining three quadratics, each of degree 2, so D/(x^2 -k) is degree 6.

(lower degree terms) + LHS terms.\n\nBut actually, since LHS is subtracted, the x^8 term remains as -4x^8 minus the x^8 term from LHS, but since LHS is degree 6, it has no x^8 or higher terms. So, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is -4.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of x^9 is 2010.\n\nTherefore, in the polynomial equation P(x) = 0, which is of degree 9, the leading term is 2010x^9, and the next term is -4x^8.\n\nTherefore, by Vieta's formula, the sum of all roots is equal to -(-4)/2010 = 4/2010 = 2/1005.

So, here, the polynomial is \\(2010x^9 -4x^8 + ... + c =0\\). Therefore, the sum of the roots is \\(-(-4)/2010 = 4/2010 = 2/1005\\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute. x=0 is a root, as we saw earlier. So, does this include x=0? Let's check.\n\nYes, because when x=0, both sides are equal: L"

But if x=0 is one of the roots, then the sum of all roots includes 0 plus the other roots. Hmm, but maybe there are other roots that cancel out?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of coefficients.\n\nWait, let me recheck the coefficients.\n\nThe polynomial P(x) is (2010x -4)*D - LHS.\n\nThe leading term of (2010x -4)*D is 2010x * x^8 = 2010x^9. The next term is (2010x)*(-10x^6) = -20100x^7, but that's the x^7 term. The x^8 term comes from the -4 multiplied by the x^8 term of D. Since D has leading term x^8, so the coefficient of x^8 in D is 1. Therefore, the term from -4*D is -4x^8. There are no other terms contributing to x^8, because the other terms in (2010x -4)*D would be lower degrees. So, the coefficient of x^8 is indeed -4. The LHS, being a degree 6 polynomial, does not affect the x^8 term. Therefore, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is -4, and the leading coefficient is 2010. Therefore, the sum of roots is -(-4)/2010 = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. The problem says \"the sum of all complex solutions\". The equation is a 9th-degree polynomial, so there are 9 roots (counting multiplicity). The sum is 2/1005. But when I checked x=0, it is a root.

Let me think if the substitution y =x^2 would help.\n\nAlternatively, since y is x^2, and the original equation relates y to x, but perhaps that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation can be manipulated as follows:\n\nLet me denote y =x^2, then the LHS is sum_{k=1}^4 [k/(y -k)].\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\nsum_{k=1}^4 [k/(y -k)] = 2010x -4.\n\nBut since y =x^2, maybe we can write 2010x -4 = something involving y.\n\nBut it's tricky because the RHS is linear in x, while LHS is a function of y.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that I set z =x, then the equation is a complicated relation between z and y, where y = z^2. But I don't see a straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set t = x, and think of the equation as a function f(t) = LHS - RHS.\n\nBut perhaps it's overcomplicating.\n\nWait, but given that we have a 9th-degree polynomial, which is a lot. But through Vieta's formula, the sum is 2/1005. So, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's any other way. Let me compute the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) again.\n\nFrom the expansion of (2010x -4)*D, the coefficient of x^9 is 2010, and the coefficient of x^8 is -4, as we saw.\n\nBut when we subtract LHS, which is degree 6, so LHS doesn't contribute to x^8 or higher.

But let me check if that fraction can be simplified further. 2 and 1005: 1005 divided by 5 is 201, so 1005 =5×201=5×3×67. 2 is prime, so no common factors. So, 2/1005 is the simplified form.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005. So, boxed, it's \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{1005}}.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if x=0 is indeed a root. Plugging x=0 into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: 1/(0 -1) + 2/(0 -2) + 3/(0 -3) +4/(0 -4) = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -4.\n\nRight side: 2010*0 -4 = -4. So yes, x=0 is a root. So, the sum includes 0 plus the other 8 roots. But according to Vieta, the total sum is 2/1005. So, the other roots must add up to 2/1005.
