Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the equation has four fractions on the left side, each of the form \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\) where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. The right side is a linear expression in \\(x\\). This looks a bit intimidating, but maybe I can simplify it somehow.\n\nI remember that when dealing with equations involving rational expressions, sometimes it's helpful to combine them into a single fraction. But combining four fractions would be quite messy. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a substitution that makes this equation simpler.\n\nLet me consider the denominators: \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). They are all quadratic in \\(x\\). If I let \\(y = x^2\\), then each denominator becomes \\(y - k\\). That might simplify things.\n\nSo, let me set \\(y = x^2\\). Then the left side of the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\]\n\nAnd the right side becomes:\n\n\\[\n2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nWait, but the right side still has an \\(x\\) term. So, I have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but \\(y = x^2\\) is a function of \\(x\\), so the left side is only in terms of \\(y\\), while the right side has both \\("

If I denote \\(f(y)\\) as the sum of the four fractions, then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(y) = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nBut \\(f(y)\\) is a function of \\(y\\), and \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\). So unless there's a direct relation between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), this might not help. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the equation as a function of \\(x\\) and analyze its roots. The equation is a rational equation, so perhaps I can multiply both sides by the product of the denominators to eliminate the fractions. That might result in a polynomial equation, and then the sum of all complex roots can be found using Vieta's formula.\n\nLet me try that. First, let me note the denominators: \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). The least common denominator (LCD) would be the product of all four denominators, but that's a degree 8 polynomial. However, maybe instead of computing the LCD, I can clear the denominators step by step.\n\nBut if I multiply each term by the LCD, which is \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\), that would be a huge expression. Let me denote this product as \\(D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\).\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(D\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nD \\left( \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} \\right) = (2010x - 4)D.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nD \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{"

The original equation is a rational equation, and when we multiplied by D, we introduced extraneous roots? Or, does it include all solutions?\n\nWait, no. When you multiply both sides by D, the equation becomes P(x) = 0, which is a polynomial equation, and all roots of P(x)=0 are solutions of the original equation, except when D=0 because x^2 - k=0 would make denominators undefined.\n\nTherefore, the solutions of P(x)=0 are exactly the solutions of the original equation, so the sum is the sum of all roots of P(x)=0, which is 2/1005.\n\nBut wait, earlier in the process"

These are excluded from the solutions. Therefore, the roots of P(x)=0 must exclude these values. However, if any of these values are roots of P(x)=0, they would be extraneous and must be subtracted from the total sum.\n\nTherefore, we need to check whether any of the excluded x values (x^2=1,2,3,4) are roots of P(x)=0.\n\nLet me check x=1:\n\nPlug x=1 into P(x):\n\nFirst, compute P(1):\n\nBut since P(x) is a long polynomial, maybe it's easier to check in the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation at x=1:\n\nLeft side: denominators x^2 -1=0, so undefined. So x=1 is excluded. Similarly, x=-1, sqrt(2), etc., are excluded.\n\nTherefore, the roots of P(x)=0 must not include these points. Therefore, if none of these points are roots of P(x)=0, then the sum of all complex solutions is indeed 2/1005.\n\nBut how do we know that none of the excluded points are roots?\n\nSuppose x=1 is a root of P(x)=0. Then plugging x=1 into P(x)=0 would require that the original equation is satisfied, but since x=1 makes denominators zero, it can't be a solution. Therefore, x=1 is not a root of P(x)=0. Similarly for the others.\n\nTherefore, the roots of P(x)=0 are exactly the solutions of the original equation, so their sum is 2/1005.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with x=0. Since x=0 is a solution, and it's not excluded, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005, which simplifies to 2/1005. Let me see if that can be reduced. 2 and 1005: 1005 divided by 5 is 201, so 1005 =5\u00d7201=5\u00d73\u00d767. 2 and "
