            "output": "To determine when the two gears will both point north again, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotational periods.\n\nFirst, I'll convert the gear rotation rates from per-minute to per-second to keep the units consistent.\n\nThe first gear turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute. Calculating this, it's \\(33.\\overline{3}\\) rotations per minute, which is equivalent to \\(200\\) rotations per minute. Converting to seconds, that's approximately \\(200\\) rotations per minute divided by \\(60\\) seconds, resulting in \\(3.\\overline{3}\\) rotations per second.\n\nThe second gear turns \\(45\\) times per minute. Converting this to rotations per second, that's \\(45\\) rotations per minute divided by \\(60\\) seconds, resulting in \\(0.75\\) rotations per second.\n\nNext, I'll express the rotation periods in terms of fractions to find the LCM. The first gear's rotation period can be represented as \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\) seconds per rotation, and the second gear's as \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) seconds per rotation.\n\nTo find the LCM of \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\), I'll consider the LCM of their numerators (8 and 4) and the LCM of their denominators (3 and 3), which is 3.\n\nThe LCM of 8 and 4 is 8, so the LCM of the two rotation periods is \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\) seconds.\n\nTherefore, both gears will point north again after \\(\\boxed{8}\\) seconds.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nOne gear turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times in a minute.  \nAnother gear turns \\(45\\) times in a minute.  \nInitially, a mark on each gear is pointing due north.  \nAfter how many seconds will the two gears next have both their marks pointing due north?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Gear Rotation Rates:**  \n   - The first gear makes \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) rotations per minute.  \n   - The second gear makes \\(45\\) rotations per minute.\n\n2. **Convert Rotations per Minute to Rotations per Second:**  \n   - For the first gear:  \n    "
