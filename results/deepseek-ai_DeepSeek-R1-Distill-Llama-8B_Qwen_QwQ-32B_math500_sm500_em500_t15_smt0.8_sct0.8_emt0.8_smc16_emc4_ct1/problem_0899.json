            "output": "First, I need to convert the fraction \\( \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\) into a terminating decimal. To do this, I'll express the denominator as a power of 10 since the presence of 2 and 5 in the denominator ensures that the decimal will terminate.\n\nCalculating \\( 2^2 \\) gives 4, and \\( 5^7 \\) is 78125. Multiplying these together results in a denominator of \\( 4 \\times 78125 = 312500 \\). \n\nNow, the fraction becomes \\( \\frac{21}{312500} \\). To convert this into a decimal, I'll divide 21 by 312500. Performing the division gives 0.000067. \n\nTherefore, the terminating decimal representation of \\( \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\) is 0.000067.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator**:\n   - The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).\n   - Calculate \\(2^2 = 4\\) and \\(5^7 = 78125\\).\n   - Multiply these together: \\(4 \\times 78125 = 312500\\).\n\n2. **Express the Fraction with a Power of 10**:\n   - The denominator \\(312500\\) can be written as \\(10^5 / 2\\), since \\(10^5 = 100000\\) and \\(100000 / 2 = 50000\\).\n   - However, to make it a power of 10, multiply both numerator and denominator by 2:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21}{312500} = \\frac{21 \\times 2}{625000} = \\frac{42}{625000} = \\frac{21}{312500}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 1 in this case.\n\n3. **Convert to Decimal**:\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     21 \\div 312500 = 0.000067\n     \\]\n   - The decimal terminates because the denominator has factors of only 2 and 5"
