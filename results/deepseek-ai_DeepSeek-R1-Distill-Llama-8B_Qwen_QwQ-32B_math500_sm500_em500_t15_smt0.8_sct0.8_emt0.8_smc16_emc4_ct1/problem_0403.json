Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, dividing the number of turns by 60 will give me the rotations per second.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the time it takes for each gear to complete one full rotation. This is done by dividing the number of rotations per second by the number of seconds in a full rotation, which is 60.\n\nOnce I have the time for each gear to complete a full rotation, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two times. The LCM will tell me when both gears will be back to their starting position at the same time.\n\nFinally, I'll convert the LCM from minutes to seconds by multiplying by 60. This will give me the exact number of seconds after which both gears will have their marks pointing due north again.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine after how many seconds both gears will have their marks pointing due north again.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe have two gears:\n- **Gear A** turns \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) times in a minute.\n- **Gear B** turns \\( 45 \\) times in a minute.\n\nBoth gears start with a mark pointing due north. We need to find the next time (in seconds) when both marks will point due north simultaneously.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Rotations per Second (RPS)\nFirst, let's find out how many times each gear turns per second.\n\n- **Gear A**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Rotations per minute} = 33\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\text{ rotations per minute}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Rotations per second} = \\frac{100}{3} \\div 60 = \\frac{100}{180} = \\frac{5}{9} \\text{ rotations per second}\n  \\]\n\n- **Gear B**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Rotations per minute} = 45 \\text{ rotations per minute}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\text{Rotations per second} = \\frac{45}{60} = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ rotations per second}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine"
