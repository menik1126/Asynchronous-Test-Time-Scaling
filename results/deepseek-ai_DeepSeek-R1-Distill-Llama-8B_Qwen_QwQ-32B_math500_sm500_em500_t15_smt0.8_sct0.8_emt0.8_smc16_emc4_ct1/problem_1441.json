            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, let's see. I need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. I'm a bit rusty on my exponent rules, but let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that 3^{2x} can be rewritten using a property of exponents. Specifically, 3^{2x} is the same as (3^x)^2 or (sqrt(3))^{2x}, but maybe I should write it as (3^x)^2 to make it easier to relate to 10^x.\n\nSo, let's rewrite the equation:\n3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\nWhich becomes:\n(3^x)^2 + 19 = 10^x\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can let y = 3^x and z = 10^x to simplify things. But wait, since both sides have the same variable base, maybe I can relate 3^x and 10^x somehow.\n\nAlternatively, I could try taking the natural logarithm of both sides after some manipulation. But before that, maybe I can make a substitution to make the equation easier to handle.\n\nLet me set t = 3^x. Then, since 3^{2x} is (3^x)^2, it's t^2. So the equation becomes:\nt^2 + 19 = 10^x\n\nBut wait, 10^x can also be expressed in terms of t. Since t = 3^x, can I find a relationship between 3^x and 10^x? I know that 10^x is (3^x)^{log_3(10)}, because 10^x = (3^{log_3(10)})^x = (10)^{x log_3(10)}. Hmm, maybe that's too convoluted.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express 10^x in terms of t. Let me think about it. Since t = 3^x, taking log base 3 of both sides gives x = log_3(t). Then, 10^x = 10^{log_3(t)} = t^{log_3(10)}. That seems complicated, but maybe we can use it.\n\nSo substituting back"

Maybe this substitution isn't the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to take logarithms on both sides, but the problem is that the equation has two terms on the left side. Taking log of a sum is not straightforward. So that might not work directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the equation to isolate the exponential terms. Let's see:\n\n3^{2x} = 10^x - 19\n\nHmm, but 10^x - 19 is still a problem because it's a subtraction. Maybe I can try plugging in some integer values for x to see if they work?\n\nLet me test x=1: 3^2 +19 = 9 +19 =28, and 10^1=10. 28≠10. Not equal.\n\nx=2: 3^4 +19 =81 +19=100, and 10^2=100. Oh!
