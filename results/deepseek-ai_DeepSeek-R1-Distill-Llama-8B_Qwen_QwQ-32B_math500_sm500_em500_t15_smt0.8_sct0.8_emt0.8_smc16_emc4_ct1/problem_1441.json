Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that \\(3^{2x}\\) can be rewritten as \\((3^2)^x\\) which simplifies to \\(9^x\\). So the equation becomes \\(9^x + 19 = 10^x\\). That seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward.\n\nMaybe I can rearrange the equation to get all the exponential terms on one side. Let me try subtracting \\(9^x\\) from both sides: \\(19 = 10^x - 9^x\\). Hmm, that might be useful. So, \\(10^x - 9^x = 19\\).\n\nI wonder if I can factor anything out here. Both terms have an \\(x\\) exponent, but I don't see a common factor. Another thought: perhaps I can write this as \\(10^x = 9^x + 19\\). Maybe taking logarithms will help, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here.\n\nLet me think about possible integer values of \\(x\\) that might satisfy the equation. Let's test some small integers.\n\nIf \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(9^1 = 9\\) and \\(10^1 = 10\\). Plugging in, \\(10 - 9 = 1\\), which is not 19. So, \\(x=1\\) doesn't work.\n\nIf \\(x = 2\\):\n\\(9^2 = 81\\) and \\(10^2 = 100\\). Then, \\(100 - 81 = 19\\). Oh, that works! So, \\(x=2\\) is a solution.\n\nWait, but could there be more solutions? Maybe negative values or fractional exponents.\n\nLet me check \\(x=0\\):\n\\(9^0 = 1\\) and \\(10^0 = 1\\). Then, \\(1 - 1 = 0\\), which isn't 19. So, \\(x=0\\) isn't a solution.\n\nWhat about \\(x\\) being negative? Let me try \\(x = -1\\):\n\\(9^{-1} = 1/9\\) and \\(10^{-1} = 1/"

Then, \\(1000 -729 = 271\\), which is bigger than 19. So that's too much. So maybe after \\(x=2\\), the difference increases?\n\nWait, so when x increases beyond 2, 10^x grows much faster than 9^x. So the difference 10^x - 9^x increases as x increases. For x less than 2, like x=1, the difference was 1; at x=0 it's 0. So maybe there's only one solution at x=2. But let me check between 0 and 2, say x=1.5?\n\nLet me compute 10^1.5 versus 9^1.5.\n\n10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3) = sqrt(1000) ≈ 31.62\n\n9^1.5 = sqrt(9^3) = sqrt(729) = 27. So, 31.62 -27 ≈ 4.62. That's still less than 19.\n\nHmm, how about x=1.9?\n\nCalculating 10^1.9: 10^(2 - 0.1) = 10^2 / 10^0.1 ≈ 100 / 1.2589 ≈ 79.4\n\n9^1.9: 9^(2 - 0.1) = 9^2 / 9^0.1 ≈ 81 / (9^(0.1)). Since 9^0.1 = e^(0.1 * ln9) ≈ e^(0.1*2.1972) ≈ e^(0.2197) ≈ 1.2457. So 81 /1.2457 ≈ 6"

So maybe between x=1 and x=2, the function goes from 1 to 19. So perhaps another solution exists somewhere between x=1 and x=2? Wait, but when I tested x=2, it was exactly 19. So actually, the equation is equal at x=2.\n\nWait, but earlier, when x increased from 1.5 to 1.9, the difference increased a lot. So perhaps there's only one solution at x=2?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's define a function f(x) = 10^x -9^x -19. We can analyze its behavior.\n\nFor x approaching negative infinity: 10^x and 9^x both approach 0, so f(x) approaches -19.\n\nAt x=2: f(2)=100 -81 -19=0.\n\nWe can compute f(1)=10 -9 -19=-18\n\nf(1.5)= ~31.62 -27 -19≈-14.38\n\nf(1.9)= ~79.4 -6.5 -19≈53.9\n\nWait, so somewhere between x=1.5 and x=1.9, f(x) crosses zero from negative to positive, meaning exactly one solution at x=2 and another solution somewhere around x=1.97 perhaps? But wait, f(2)=0. So, is x=2 the only solution?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check x=1. Let me compute f(1)=10 -9 -19= -18. At x=2, f(2)=0. So, between x=1 and x=2, f(x) goes from -18 to 0, but at x=1.5, f(x)=~ -14.38, and at x=1.9, it's +53. So, actually, f(x) crosses zero exactly once at x=2 because it's monotonic increasing after x=1?\n\nWait, not necessarily. Let me take derivative to see if it's increasing.\n\nf(x)="

But at x=0, f’(0)= ln(10) - ln(9) ≈0.1054>0. So the function is increasing at x=0.

Let me check f(2.001):\n\n10^2.001≈100*10^0.001≈≈100*1.0023≈100.23.\n\n9^2.001≈81*9^0.001≈81*(1 +0.001*ln9)≈81*(1 +0.002197)≈81*1.002197≈81.18.\n\nThus, f(2.001)=100.23 -81.18 -19≈100.23 -100.18≈0.05.\n\nSo, f(2.001)=≈0.05>0.\n\nTherefore, f(x) crosses zero at x=2 from negative to positive, meaning it's the only solution.\n\nTherefore, x=2 is the only solution.\n\nBut wait, when I tried x=1.999, f(x)=≈-0.06, and x=2.001, f(x)=≈0.05.\n\nSo, the function crosses zero only once at x=2.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe another solution around x≈1.97, but according to these calculations, there isn't. Because if I have f(1.95)=≈-2.92, f(1.999)=≈-0.06, and f(2)=0, and it's strictly increasing.\n\nThus, the only solution is x=2.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is x=2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we start by rewriting \\(3^{2x}\\) as \\((3^2)^x = 9^x\\). This transforms the equation into:\n\n\\[9^x + 19 = 10^x\\]\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n\\[10^x - 9^x = 19\\]\n\nWe define a function \\(f(x) ="
