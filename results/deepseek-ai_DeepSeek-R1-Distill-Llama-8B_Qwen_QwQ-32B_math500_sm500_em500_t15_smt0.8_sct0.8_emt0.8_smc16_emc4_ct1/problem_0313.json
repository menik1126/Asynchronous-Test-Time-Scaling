            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x -14). Then, I have to find the sum of these asymptotes, a + b + c. Hmm, let me start by recalling what vertical asymptotes and horizontal asymptotes are.\n\nVertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function equals zero, but the numerator doesn't, provided that those points aren't canceled out by zeros in the numerator. For horizontal asymptotes, we look at the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity or negative infinity. So, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, to find vertical asymptotes, I need to factor the denominator or find its roots. The denominator is x² -5x -14. Let me try to factor this quadratic. To factor x² -5x -14, I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see. Factors of -14 are (1, -14), (-1, 14), (2, -7), (-2, 7). Let's check which pair adds up to -5. So, 2 and -7: 2 + (-7) = -5. Yes! So, it factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). So, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the denominator is zero when x = -2 and x = 7. Now, let's check the numerator at these points. The numerator is 2x, which is zero when x = 0. So, since neither -2 nor 7 make the numerator zero, both x = -2 and x = 7 are vertical asymptotes. So, a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nNext, let me find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator here is 1 (since it's 2x), and the degree of the denominator is 2 (since it's a quadratic). When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If it's equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. So, here, since the numerator has a lower degree, the horizontal asympt"

Vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x = 7, horizontal asymptote at y = 0. So, sum is -2 +7 +0, which is indeed 5. Hmm, seems straightforward.\n\nWait, let me confirm I factored the denominator correctly. Is (x + 2)(x - 7) equal to x² -5x -14? Let me multiply it out: x² -7x +2x -14 = x² -5x -14. Yes, that's correct. So, my vertical asymptotes are correctly identified as x = -2 and x =7.\n\nAnd for the horizontal asymptote, since the degree of numerator is 1 and denominator is 2, it's y = 0. So, I think my earlier conclusion is correct. Therefore, a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the vertical asymptotes and horizontal asymptote of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\):\n\n1. **Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - Factor the denominator: \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7) \\).\n   - Set the denominator equal to zero: \\( (x + 2)(x - 7) = 0 \\) gives \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n   - These values are the vertical asymptotes: \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Horizontal Asymptote**:\n   - The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2.\n   - Since the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\).\n   - Thus, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Sum of Asymptotes**:\n   - \\( a + b + c = (-"
