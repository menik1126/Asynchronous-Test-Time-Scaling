            "output": "To determine the vertical asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), I need to factor the denominator.\n\nFirst, I'll factor the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\). I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. These numbers are -7 and 2.\n\nSo, the factored form of the denominator is \\( (x - 7)(x + 2) \\).\n\nNext, I'll identify the vertical asymptotes by setting each factor equal to zero:\n- \\( x - 7 = 0 \\) gives \\( x = 7 \\)\n- \\( x + 2 = 0 \\) gives \\( x = -2 \\)\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\), so \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nNow, to find the horizontal asymptote, I'll compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is of degree 1, and the denominator is of degree 2. Since the degree of the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nThe leading coefficient of the numerator is 2, and the leading coefficient of the denominator is 1. Thus, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2 \\), so \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll add \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):\n\\[\na + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 2 = 7\n\\]\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll analyze the given function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\) to find its vertical and horizontal asymptotes.\n\n**Step 1: Find Vertical Asymptotes**\n\nVertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero (provided the numerator is not also zero at those points).\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set Each Factor Equal to Zero:**\n   \\[\n   x - 7 = 0 \\"
