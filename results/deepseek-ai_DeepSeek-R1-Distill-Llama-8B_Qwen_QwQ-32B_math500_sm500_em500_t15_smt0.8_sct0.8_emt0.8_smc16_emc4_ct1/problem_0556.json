            "output": "First, I need to identify the prices of Juan's stamps from the 70s. Looking at the chart, Peru has stamps priced at 12 cents each.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total number of 70s stamps by multiplying the number of Peru stamps from that decade by the price per stamp. Since there are no other countries listed under the 70s, I'll assume the number of Peru stamps is 12.\n\nFinally, I'll compute the average price by dividing the total price by the number of stamps. So, the average price is 12 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices of 70s Stamps:**\n   - **Peru** stamps are priced at **12** cents each.\n   - No other countries (Brazil and France) are listed under the 70s decade.\n\n2. **Assumptions:**\n   - Since only Peru is listed under the 70s, we'll assume there are **12** stamps of Peru from that decade. (This number represents the price listed for Peru in the 70s.)\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 12 \\, \\text{stamps} \\times 12 \\, \\text{cents per stamp} = 144 \\, \\text{cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Average Price:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Price} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Number of Stamps}} = \\frac{144 \\, \\text{cents}}{12 \\, \\text{stamps}} = 12 \\, \\text{cents per stamp}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   The average price of Juan's **70s** stamps is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) cents."
