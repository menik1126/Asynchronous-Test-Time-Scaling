Looking at the chart, the 70s column has a 12 cents for two different stamps, 6 cents for another, and 13 cents for the last one. This gives me a total of four stamps with their respective prices: 12, 12, 6, and 13 cents.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total cost of these stamps by adding the individual prices together. So, 12 plus 12 equals 24, plus 6 equals 30, and finally, adding 13 gives a total of 43 cents for all the 70s stamps.\n\nThen, I need to find out how many stamps were purchased during the 70s. From the chart, I can see that there are four stamps from this decade.\n\nWith the total cost and the number of stamps known, I'll compute the average price per stamp. I'll divide the total cost by the number of stamps: 43 divided by 4, which equals 10.75 cents.\n\nFinally, to present the answer as required, I'll round this average price to the nearest tenth of a cent. Rounding 10.75 to one decimal place gives me 10.8 cents.\n\nTherefore, the average price of Juan's 70s stamps is \\boxed{10.8} cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's 70s stamps, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the 70s stamps and their prices:**\n   - From the chart, the 70s stamps have the following prices: 12, 12, 6, and 13 cents.\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost of the 70s stamps:**\n   \\[\n   12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of 70s stamps:**\n   - There are 4 stamps from the 70s.\n\n4. **Compute the average price per 70s stamp:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average price} = \\frac{43}{4} = 10.75 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round the average price to the nearest tenth of a cent:**\n   \\[\n   10.75"
