            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a quadratic polynomial P(x). It says that for all real numbers x, P(x) is squeezed between two other quadratics: x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3. Also, we know that P(11) is 181. The goal is to find P(16). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, it has the general form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real coefficients that we need to find. So, my first thought is to express P(x) in this form and then use the given inequalities to set up some constraints on a, b, and c.\n\nThe inequalities given are:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nThis has to hold for all real numbers x. So, the polynomial P(x) is sandwiched between these two quadratics. Maybe I can subtract the lower bound from both sides and the upper bound from P(x) as well? Let me think.\n\nLet me define two new functions to simplify this:\n\nLet’s say f(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2). Then f(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x), so g(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSo now, both f(x) and g(x) are non-negative for all real x. Since both are quadratics, their leading coefficients must be non-negative; otherwise, the parabola would open downward, and they couldn't be always non-negative. That gives us some information.\n\nLet’s compute f(x) and g(x):\n\nf(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\n\nSimilarly, g(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c)\n\nSince f(x) and g(x) are both non-negative for all real x, they must be perfect"

            "output": " squares or have non-positive discriminant if they are to be non-negative everywhere.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, since f(x) and g(x) are quadratics that are always non-negative, their discriminants must be less than or equal to zero, and their leading coefficients must be non-negative. That's because for a quadratic ax² + bx + c to be always non-negative, it must either open upwards (a > 0) and have discriminant ≤ 0, or open downwards (a < 0) and have discriminant ≤ 0, but in the latter case, it can’t be non-negative for all x because it would tend to negative infinity as x goes to ±infinity. So, in this problem, since both f(x) and g(x) are non-negative everywhere, their leading coefficients must be positive, and their discriminants must be non-positive.\n\nSo, let's write down these conditions.\n\nFirst, for f(x):\n\nf(x) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\n\nLeading coefficient: a - 1 ≥ 0 => a ≥ 1\n\nDiscriminant D_f: (b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0\n\nSimilarly, for g(x):\n\ng(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c)\n\nLeading coefficient: 2 - a ≥ 0 => a ≤ 2\n\nDiscriminant D_g: (-4 - b)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0\n\nSo, putting it together, we have:\n\n1 ≤ a ≤ 2\n\nDiscriminant conditions:\n\n(b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0\n\nand\n\n(-4 - b)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Maybe I can also use P(11) = 181 to form another equation.\n\nSince P(x) = ax² + bx + c, then:\n\na*(11)^2 + b*11 + c = 181\n\nSo,\n\n121a + 11b + c = 181\n\nThat's our third equation.

So, a is a real number between 1 and 2.\n\nSo, we have four conditions: a is between 1 and 2, and the discriminant conditions, and the equation from P(11) = 181.\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but maybe I can try to set up equations to solve for a, b, c.\n\nWait, perhaps the only way for f(x) and g(x) to be non-negative for all x is if they are perfect squares. Because otherwise, their discriminants being negative would mean they just touch the x-axis at one point, but as quadratics that's allowed.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to note that for f(x) and g(x) to be non-negative everywhere, they must have a double root, so their discriminants are zero.\n\nSo maybe D_f = 0 and D_g = 0. Let me consider this possibility.\n\nIf that's the case, then both f(x) and g(x) would be perfect squares, so P(x) is exactly in the middle between the two given quadratics.\n\nSo, let's try this approach.\n\nSet D_f = 0 and D_g = 0, so we can get equations to solve for a, b, c.\n\nSo,\n\nFrom f(x):\n\n(b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) = 0\n\nSimilarly, from g(x):\n\n(-4 - b)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) = 0\n\nAnd from P(11) = 181:\n\n121a + 11b + c = 181\n\nSo, now we have three equations with three variables, which is good.\n\nSo, let's write these equations.\n\nEquation 1: (b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) = 0\n\nEquation 2: (-4 - b)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) = 0\n\nEquation 3: 121a + 11b"

But in order to have the minimal case where P(x) is exactly touching the lower bound at some point, the discriminant must be zero. Similarly for the upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quadratic P(x) touches both the lower and upper bounds at the same point, so that both f(x) and g(x) have a double root at that point. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that there exists some x₀ where P(x₀) = x₀² -2x₀ +2 and also P(x₀)=2x₀² -4x₀ +3. Then, setting them equal:\n\nx₀² -2x₀ +2 = 2x₀² -4x₀ +3\n\n=> 0 = x₀² -2x₀ +1\n\n=> (x₀ -1)^2 =0 => x₀=1.\n\nSo, the two quadratics intersect at x=1. Therefore, if P(x) touches both the lower and upper bounds at x=1, then P(1)=1² -2*1 +2=1-2+2=1, and also P(1)=2*1² -4*1 +3=2-4+3=1. So, P(1)=1.\n\nTherefore, if P(x) touches both bounds at x=1, then P(1)=1, and the quadratic P(x) must have its vertex at x=1, since that's the point where both inequalities touch.\n\nTherefore, perhaps P(x) has its vertex at x=1, and is between the two quadratics elsewhere.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nLet me write P(x) in vertex form. Since the vertex is at x=1, then P(x)= a(x-1)^2 +k.\n\nBut since it's a quadratic, and the leading coefficient must be between 1 and 2 (from the inequalities), so a is between 1 and 2.\n\nWait, but also, since P(x) must be equal to the lower bound at x=1, which is 1, so P(1)=1.
