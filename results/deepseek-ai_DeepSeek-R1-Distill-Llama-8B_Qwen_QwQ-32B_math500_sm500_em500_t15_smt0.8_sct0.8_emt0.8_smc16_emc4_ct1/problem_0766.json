I need to find the first term, \\( a_1 \\), given that the 13th term, \\( a_{13} \\), is 2016. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a strictly increasing sequence \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots \\). For every positive integer \\( k \\), there are two sequences involved:\n\n1. The subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric. That means each term after the first is a multiple of the previous term by a common ratio.\n2. The subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is arithmetic. That means each term after the first is obtained by adding a common difference.\n\nSo, every odd-indexed term, the next even term, and then the term after that form a geometric progression. Then, the even term, the next odd term, and the term after that form an arithmetic progression. This seems to set up a recursive relationship between the terms.\n\nSince the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms must be positive integers, and each term must be greater than the previous one.\n\nGiven that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\), I need to find \\( a_1 \\).\n\nLet me start by writing out the relations for the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern or come up with a recursive formula.\n\nFor \\( k = 1 \\):\n\n- Geometric sequence: \\( a_1, a_2, a_3 \\)\n- Let the common ratio be \\( r_1 \\). So,\n  - \\( a_2 = a_1 \\times r_1 \\)\n  - \\( a_3 = a_2 \\times r_1 = a_1 \\times r_1^2 \\)\n\n- Arithmetic sequence: \\( a_2, a_3, a_4 \\)\n- Let the common difference be \\( d_1 \\). So,\n  - \\( a_3 = a_2 + d_1 \\)\n  - \\( a_4 = a_3 + d_1 = a_2 + 2d_1 \\)\n\nFrom the geometric sequence,"

So, 144 is a square factor.\n\nWait, but 144 is 12 squared, so perhaps \\( r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4 r_5 r_6 = 12 \\). Then, \\( a_1 = 2016 / 144 = 14 \\). Hmm, that's a possible way.\n\nBut let me check if it's feasible to have \\( r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4 r_5 r_6 = 12 \\).\n\nBut 12 is 2 × 2 × 3, which would require that each \\( r_k \\geq 2 \\), but 12 has only three prime factors, but we have six \\("

Therefore, this approach might not work.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. The product of the \\( r_k \\) squared must divide 2016, but in reality, it's the product squared that divides 2016, so the product itself is less than or equal to sqrt(2016) ≈ 44.9.

But the problem states that the sequence consists of positive integers, so the ratios must be rational numbers such that the terms remain integers.
