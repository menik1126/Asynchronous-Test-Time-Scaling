The problem says that for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. Also, I know that a\u2081\u2083 is 2016, and I need to find a\u2081. Hmm, that's a mouthful, but let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what geometric and arithmetic sequences are. A geometric sequence is one where each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, if I have a geometric sequence like a, b, c, then b/a = c/b, which means b\u00b2 = a*c. An arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, is one where each term is obtained by adding a common difference. So, if I have a, b, c, then b - a = c - b, meaning 2b = a + c.\n\nNow, the problem tells me that for each k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. So, for k=1, that would be a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083. For k=2, it would be a\u2083, a\u2084, a\u2085, and so on. Similarly, for each k, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. So, again, for k=1, that's a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084; for k=2, it's a\u2084, a\u2085, a\u2086, etc.\n\nSo, this gives me a recursive way of defining the sequence. It seems like each odd-indexed term and its next two terms form a geometric sequence, and each even-indexed term and its next two terms form an arithmetic sequence. Interesting. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms are positive integers, and each term is larger than the one before it.\n\nGiven that a\u2081\u2083 = 2016, and the sequence is strictly increasing, I need to find a\u2081.

Let me think.\n\nFor each k, the geometric sequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} has a common ratio. Let's call this ratio r_k.
