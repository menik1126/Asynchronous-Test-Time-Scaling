Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the given equations so I can keep track of them:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, I need to find \\( xy + yz + zx \\). I remember that in algebra, sometimes we can use symmetric sums and identities to relate different equations. Let me recall some useful identities.\n\nI know that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\). Maybe that could help here since we have \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\) and \\( xyz \\) given.\n\nGiven that, let's denote \\( S = x + y + z \\), \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\).\n\nFrom the first identity:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nWe know \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\) and \\( xyz = 4 \\), so plugging in:\n\n\\( 4 - 3*4 = S*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - P) \\)\n\nSimplify left side: 4 - 12 = -8\n\nSo,\n\n\\( -8 = S*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - P) \\)\n\nI need to express \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\) in terms of other variables.

It's:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nThis looks a bit complicated. Let me try to factor or rearrange it.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \\)\n\nAnd \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \\)\n\nSo, the entire left side can be written as:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\)\n\nWhich is equal to 12.\n\nHmm, that might not be directly helpful, but let me write it as:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nAnother thought: perhaps we can factor this differently or express it in terms of S, P, and Q.\n\nWait, maybe consider grouping differently.\n\nAlternatively, note that each term has two variables multiplied by the sum of two variables.\n\nBut perhaps I can express \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) \\).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\( S * P = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y + 3xyz \\)\n\nWait, that looks similar to the third equation. Let me see:\n\nThe third equation is:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n\\( (x^2 y + x^2 z) + (y^2 x + y^2 z) + (z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12 \\"
