Hmm, at first glance, it looks a bit intimidating because of all the cubes, but maybe I can simplify it step by step.\n\nLet me write it down again to visualize better:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nFirst, I notice that both sides have cubic terms. Maybe expanding them would help. But expanding each side might be messy. Alternatively, I can try to see if there's a substitution that can make this equation simpler.\n\nLooking at the right side, (2x - 10) can be factored as 2(x - 5). So, (2x - 10)^3 = [2(x - 5)]^3 = 8(x - 5)^3. Hmm, that might be useful later.\n\nNow, looking back at the left side: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3. I remember that there's a formula for the sum of cubes: a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me set a = x - 3 and b = x - 7. Then, the left side becomes:\n\na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2).\n\nSo, let's compute a + b and a^2 - ab + b^2.\n\nFirst, a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10.\n\nOkay, that's interesting because the right side is also (2x - 10)^3. So, the equation now looks like:\n\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHmm, so if 2x - 10 is not zero, I can divide both sides by 2x - 10, right? Let's try that:\n\na^2 - ab + b^2 = (2x - 10)^2.\n\nSince a = x - 3 and b = x -7, let me substitute those back in:\n\n(x - 3)^2"

Let me compute (x -3)(x -7):\n\n(x -3)(x -7) = x^2 -7x -3x +21 = x^2 -10x +21.\n\nSo, subtracting that: -(x^2 -10x +21) = -x^2 +10x -21.\n\nNow, combine all the terms on the left side:\n\n(x^2 -6x +9) + (-x^2 +10x -21) + (x^2 -14x +49).\n\nLet's add them term by term:\n\nx^2 -6x +9 -x^2 +10x -21 +x^2 -14x +49.\n\nFirst, x^2 -x^2 +x^2 = x^2.\n\nThen, -6x +10x -14x = (-6 +10 -14)x = (-10)x.\n\nConstants: 9 -21 +49 = 37.\n\nSo, left side simplifies to x^2 -10x +37.\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\nx^2 -10x +37 = (2x -10)^2.\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\n(2x -10)^2 = (2x)^2 - 2*(2x)*10 +10^2 = 4x^2 -40x +100.\n\nSo, now, the equation is:\n\nx^2 -10x +37 = 4x^2 -40x +100.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n0 = 4x^2 -40x +100 -x^2 +10x -37.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4x^2 -x^2) + (-40x +10x) + (100 -37) = 0.\n\nSo, 3x^2 -30x +63 =0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation.

Let me check the discriminant:\n\nD = (-10)^2 -4*1*21 = 100 -84 =16.\n\nSince D is 16, which is a perfect square, the roots can be found using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [10 \u00b1 sqrt(16)] / 2 = [10 \u00b14]/2.\n\nSo, x = (10 +4)/2=14/2=7 or x=(10 -4)/2=6/2=3.\n\nWait, so the solutions are x=7 and x=3. But hold on, earlier I divided both sides by (2x -10), so I need to check if 2x -10 is zero, which would make that division invalid. Let me see:\n\n2x -10=0 \u2192 x=5.\n\nSo, x=5 could be another solution, but we didn't get it here. So, we need to check if x=5 is a solution.\n\nLet me plug x=5 into the original equation:\n\n(5 -3)^3 + (5 -7)^3 = (2*5 -10)^3.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(2)^3 + (-2)^3 = (10 -10)^3.\n\n8 + (-8) = 0^3.\n\n0 =0.\n\nYes, so x=5 is also a solution.\n\nSo, the roots are x=3, x=5, and x=7.\n\nWait, but in the quadratic equation, I only got x=3 and x=7. So, perhaps x=5 is a solution that comes from the case where 2x -10=0, so I need to include that as another solution.\n\nSo, altogether, the roots are x=3, x=5, and x=7.\n\nHmm, let me verify each one again:\n\nFor x=3:\n\nLeft side: (0)^3 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64.\n\nRight side: (6 -10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64.

Let me check the equation again.\n\nWait, the original equation is a cubic on both sides. Let's see: the left side is (x-3)^3 + (x-7)^3, which is a sum of two cubes. The right side is (2x -10)^3, which is a single cube. When we moved everything to one side, we ended up with a quadratic, but we also considered the case where 2x -10 \u22600, which gave two roots. Then, the x=5 case gave another solution. So, in total, three roots: 3,5,7.\n\nBut let me think about the original equation: if I set both sides as cubes, then (x-3)^3 + (x-7)^3 equals another cube. So, for real numbers, when does the sum of two cubes equal another cube? Perhaps another way to approach is to consider the identity I used earlier.\n\nWait, because a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 -ab + b^2). So, in this case, a + b = 2x -10, as we had earlier. So, if 2x -10 is not zero, then a^3 + b^3 = (2x -10)^3 implies that a^2 -ab + b^2 = (2x -10)^2. But when 2x -10 is zero, both sides become zero, so x=5 is a solution. So, I think that correctly gives all solutions.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when you have a^3 + b^3 = c^3, you can think of it as a + b = c, but that's only sometimes possible. In our case, a + b = c, so a + b = c and a^3 + b^3 = c^3. So, in this case, since a + b = c and a^3 + b^3 = c^3, substituting gives a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3, which expands to a^3 + b^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b"

So, ab=0 implies either a=0 or b=0. So, a=0 is x-3=0 \u2192 x=3, and b=0 is x-7=0 \u2192 x=7. So, that gives the three solutions: x=3,5,7. So that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the roots are 3,5,7. So, the answer should be those three numbers.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again. Let me plug in x=3,5,7 into the original equation:\n\nFor x=3:\n\nLeft: (0)^3 + (-4)^3 = 0 -64 = -64\n\nRight: (6-10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64. Equal.\n\nx=5:\n\nLeft: (2)^3 + (-2)^3 =8 -8=0\n\nRight: (10-10)^3=0. Equal.\n\nx=7:\n\nLeft: (4)^3 +0=64\n\nRight: (14-10)^3=4^3=64. Equal.\n\nSo all three work. Therefore, the roots are 3,5,7.\n\nHence, the final answer is those three numbers in boxed form. Since the question says \"roots\", and the equation is a cubic, so three roots. So, boxed answers separated by commas?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Find the roots\", so probably list all three. The instructions say \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Maybe as a list inside the box. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". So maybe separate each in boxes? Or as a list. Hmm, maybe boxed as \\boxed{3}, \\boxed{5}, \\boxed{7}. But maybe they want all in one box. Let me see examples. In many cases, multiple answers are separated by commas inside a single box.
