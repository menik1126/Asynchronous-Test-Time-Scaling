            "output": "Okay, I need to find the roots of the equation \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\). Hmm, let me see how to approach this. First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving cubes, sometimes factoring or looking for patterns can help. But I don't immediately see an obvious way to factor this, so maybe I should try expanding both sides and see if I can simplify it.\n\nLet me write down the equation again:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, perhaps I can let \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). Then the left side becomes \\(a^3 + b^3\\), and the right side is \\((2x - 10)^3\\). I also notice that \\(2x - 10\\) might be related to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me compute \\(a + b\\):\n\n\\[\na + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\n\\]\n\nOh! So \\(a + b = 2x - 10\\). That's interesting because the right side of the equation is \\((a + b)^3\\). So the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I can recall the identity for the sum of cubes: \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\). So, substituting that in:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (a + b)^3\n\\]\n\nWait, so if I subtract \\((a + b)^3\\) from both sides, I get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) - (a + b)^3 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\((a + b)\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)\\left[(a^2 - ab + b^2) - (a + b)^2\\right] = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, this product is zero if either of the factors is zero. So, first possibility: \\(a + b ="

Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the second factor is:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 - ab + b^2) - (a + b)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nLet me expand \\((a + b)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 - ab + b^2 - (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify this:\n\n\\[\na^2 - ab + b^2 - a^2 - 2ab - b^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(a^2 - a^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(b^2 - b^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(-ab - 2ab = -3ab\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n-3ab = 0 \\implies ab = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, either \\(a = 0\\) or \\(b = 0\\).\n\nBut remember, \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). So,\n\nCase 1: \\(a = 0 \\implies x - 3 = 0 \\implies x = 3\\)\n\nCase 2: \\(b = 0 \\implies x - 7 = 0 \\implies x = 7\\)\n\nSo, from the second factor, we get two more roots: x = 3 and x = 7.\n\nWait a second, so all roots are x = 3, x = 5, and x = 7? Hmm, but let me make sure. I should check if these solutions satisfy the original equation.\n\nLet me test x = 3:\n\nLeft side: \\((3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 - 64 = -64\\)\n\nRight side: \\((2*"

So, yes, it works.\n\nx = 5:\n\nLeft side: \\((5 -3)^3 + (5 -7)^3 = 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 -8 = 0\\)\n\nRight side: \\((2*5 -10)^3 = (10 -10)^3 = 0^3 = 0\\).

That works too.\n\nSo, all three roots check out. Therefore, the roots are 3, 5, and 7.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me think again about the original equation. The left side is a sum of two cubes, and the right side is another cube. When I used the substitution \\(a = x - 3\\), \\(b = x -7\\), I found that the equation simplifies when either \\(a + b = 0\\) or \\(ab = 0\\). Therefore, this should capture all possible solutions. I don't think there are more roots, because the equation is a cubic, so it should have up to three roots, which we found: 3, 5, 7.\n\nBut let me check if these are all the roots. Since the original equation is a cubic, it can have at most three real roots. We found three real roots, so that's all.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x = 3, 5, 7.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\) can be solved by recognizing that \\(2x - 10 = (x - 3) + (x - 7)\\). Substituting \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\), the equation becomes \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3\\). Factoring this, we find either \\(a + b = 0\\) leading to \\("
