To eliminate the cube root, I'll cube both sides of the equation.\\n\\nAfter cubing both sides, the equation simplifies to \\(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3\\). I'll calculate \\(16^3\\), which equals 4096.\\n\\nNow, the equation becomes \\(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\\). I'll subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero: \\(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\\).\\n\\nThis is a quadratic equation in the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). I'll use the quadratic formula to solve for \\(x\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\), and \\(c = -4092\\).\\n\\nApplying the quadratic formula: \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). Plugging in the values: \\(x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}\\). The discriminant becomes \\(16384\\), and its square root is 128.\\n\\nSo, the solutions are \\(x = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} = 66\\) and \\(x = \\frac{4 - 128}{2} = -62\\). Since we're asked for the positive value, the solution is \\(x = 66\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\\) for the positive value of \\(x\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Eliminate the Cube Root:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\n   \\]\n   Cube both sides to remove the cube root:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(16^3\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the"
