            "output": "Alright, so I need to solve the equation where the cube root of (x² - 4x + 4) equals 16. Hmm, okay. Let me write that down clearly: ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. \n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have a cube root equals a number, you can get rid of the cube root by cubing both sides. That makes sense because cube and cube root are inverse operations, right? So if I cube the left side, it should simplify to just x² - 4x + 4, and on the right side, 16 cubed is... let's see, 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is 4096. So that gives me the equation x² - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation. The next step is probably to get everything on one side so I can try to factor it or use the quadratic formula. So I'll subtract 4096 from both sides to get all terms on the left. That gives me x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, so the equation is x² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nHmm, trying to factor a quadratic with such a large constant term. That might not be easy. Maybe I should use the quadratic formula instead. The quadratic formula is x = [ -b ± √(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a). In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092.\n\nLet me plug those values in. So, b squared is (-4)², which is 16. Then, 4ac is 4 * 1 * (-4092), which is -16368. So the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac, becomes 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, so that's 16 + 16368, which equals 16384.\n\nWait, is 16384 a perfect square? I'm not sure. Let me think. I know that 128 squared is 16384 because 128 times 128 is 16384. Yeah, that's right. So the"

            "output": " square root of 16384 is 128.\n\nSo now, plugging back into the quadratic formula: x = [ -(-4) ± 128 ] / (2 * 1). That simplifies to x = [4 ± 128] / 2. So there are two possible solutions: one where it's 4 + 128 over 2 and another where it's 4 - 128 over 2.\n\nCalculating the first solution: (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66. The second solution: (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62.\n\nBut the question asks for the positive value of x, so 66 is the answer. Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the cube root equation, I cubed both sides to get rid of the cube root, which is correct. Then I ended up with a quadratic equation, which seems right. Using the quadratic formula, I calculated the discriminant correctly, recognizing that 16384 is 128 squared. Then applying the formula, I found two solutions, and since we want the positive one, 66 is correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 66 is the solution. I don't see any errors in the steps I took.\n</think>\n\nTo solve ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16, follow these steps:\n\n1. Cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n   \\[\n   x² - 4x + 4 = 16³\n   \\]\n2. Calculate 16³:\n   \\[\n   16³ = 4096\n   \\]\n   So the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   x² - 4x + 4 = 4096\n   \\]\n3. Subtract 4096 from both sides to form a quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0 \\implies x² - 4x - 4092 = 0\n   \\]\n4.
