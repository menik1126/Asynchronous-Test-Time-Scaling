To combine the left side, I should find a common denominator, which would be the product of (x - 3) and (x + 8). \n\nSo, let me rewrite each term with the common denominator:\n\n- The first term is \\(\\frac{C}{x - 3}\\), so when multiplied by \\(\\frac{x + 8}{x + 8}\\), it becomes \\(\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\).\n- The second term is \\(\\frac{D}{x + 8}\\), which becomes \\(\\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\).\n\nAdding these together, I get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, according to the equation, this should equal the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x -23}{x^2 +5x -24}\n\\]\n\nWait, I notice that the denominator on the right side, \\(x^2 +5x -24\\), can be factored. Let me factor that:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to +5. Hmm, 8 and -3 work because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5.\n\nSo, the denominator factors as (x + 8)(x - 3). That means the right-hand side is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x -23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, since both sides have the same denominator, I can set the numerators equal to each other:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x -23\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\nCx + 8C + Dx -"

That gives us a system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: \\(C + D = 4\\)\n2. Constant term: \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nNow, I need to solve this system for C and D. Let's rewrite these equations:\n\nFirst equation: \\(C + D = 4\\) --> equation (1)\n\nSecond equation: \\(8C - 3D = -23\\) --> equation (2)\n\nFrom equation (1), I can express D as \\(D = 4 - C\\). Let's substitute this into equation (2):\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nExpanding:\n\n8C -12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11C -12 = -23\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -11\n\nSo, C = -1.\n\nNow, substitute back into equation (1): -1 + D = 4, so D = 5.\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nBut the question asks for the product CD, so:\n\nCD = (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me verify that these values satisfy the second equation.\n\nPlugging C = -1 and D =5 into equation (2):\n\n8*(-1) -3*(5) = -8 -15 = -23, which matches. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product CD is -5.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is given as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x -23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nBy equating the numerators after finding a common denominator, we set up the system:\n\n1. \\(C + D = 4\\)\n2. \\(8C - 3D = -23\\)\n\nSolving these, we find \\(C = -1\\) and \\(D = 5\\). Thus, the product \\(CD = (-1)(5) = -5\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed"
