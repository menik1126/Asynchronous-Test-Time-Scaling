I remember that when you have a fraction like this, you can combine the left side into a single fraction and then compare the numerators. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I should note that the denominator on the right side is a quadratic that can be factored. Let me factor \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Let me think, 8 and -3 work because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, the denominator factors to \\((x + 8)(x - 3)\\).\n\nSo now, the right side becomes \\(\\frac{4x - 23}{(x + 8)(x - 3)}\\).\n\nOn the left side, we have \\(\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8}\\). To combine these, I need a common denominator, which would be \\((x - 3)(x + 8)\\). So, let's rewrite each fraction with this common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, since the denominators are the same, I can set the numerators equal:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\[\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nThis gives us a system of equations by equating the coefficients of like terms:\n\n1.

From the first equation, I can express D in terms of C:\n\n\\(D = 4 - C\\)\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n\\(8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\\)\n\nLet's expand that:\n\n\\(8C - 12 + 3C = -23\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\(11C - 12 = -23\\)\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n\\(11C = -11\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\n\\(C = -1\\)\n\nNow, substitute back into D = 4 - C:\n\n\\(D = 4 - (-1) = 5\\)\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Therefore, the product CD is:\n\n\\(-1 * 5 = -5\\)\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I combined the fractions correctly and set the numerators equal. Expanded and combined like terms, got two equations. Solved for C and D, got -1 and 5. Calculated the product as -5. Hmm, seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should plug back into the original equation to verify.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the left side with C=-1 and D=5:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1}{x - 3} + \\frac{5}{x + 8}\n\\]\n\nCombine them:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-1(x + 8) + 5(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{-x -8 +5x -15}{(x -3)(x +8)} = \\frac{4x -23}{(x -3)(x +8)}\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches the right side. So, my solution is correct. Therefore, CD = (-1)(5) = -5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), we combine the left-hand side into a single fraction and equate it to the right-hand side.\n\n1.
