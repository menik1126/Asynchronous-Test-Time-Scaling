This is done by dividing the male percentage by the female percentage and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage ratio.\n\nThen, I'll apply the 135% threshold to each grade's ratio. This involves multiplying the calculated ratio by 135 and determining which grade's ratio is closest to this value.\n\nFinally, I'll compare the differences between each grade's ratio and 135% to identify the grade with the smallest difference, indicating the closest match.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to **135%** of the number of female bus riders.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Data\nWe have data for each grade, showing the percentage of male and female bus riders. Since **300 males and 300 females** were surveyed in each grade, we can calculate the actual number of male and female bus riders for each grade.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Actual Numbers\nLet's assume the total number of students surveyed in each grade is **300 males + 300 females = 600 students**.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|l|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{Grade} & \\text{Males (\\%)} & \\text{Females (\\%)} \\\\\n\\hline\n9^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade} & 41.1\\% & 39.4\\% \\\\\n\\hline\n10^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade} & 34.4\\% & 33.1\\% \\\\\n\\hline\n11^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade} & 20.6\\% & 13.8\\% \\\\\n\\hline\n12^{\\mathrm{th}} \\text{ grade} & 11.6\\% & 8.6\\% \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Ratio of Male to Female Bus"
