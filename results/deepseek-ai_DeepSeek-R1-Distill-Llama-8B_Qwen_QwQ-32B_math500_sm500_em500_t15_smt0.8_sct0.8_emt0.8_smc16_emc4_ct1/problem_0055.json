Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of male and female bus riders for each grade by applying the given percentages to the total of 300 students per grade.\n\nFor each grade, I'll compute the percentage of males and females relative to the total surveyed students.\n\nAfter obtaining the actual numbers of male and female bus riders, I'll then compare the number of male bus riders to 135% of the female bus riders for each grade.\n\nFinally, I'll identify the grade where this comparison is closest to the specified 135% threshold.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to \\(135\\%\\) of the female bus riders, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Data:**\n   - There are \\(300\\) males and \\(300\\) females surveyed in each grade.\n   - The percentages provided are of the total surveyed students (\\(300 + 300 = 600\\)).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Bus Riders:**\n   - **Male Bus Riders:** \\(300 \\times (\\text{Percentage of males})\\)\n   - **Female Bus Riders:** \\(300 \\times (\\text{Percentage of females})\\)\n\n3. **Determine the Ratio of Male to Female Bus Riders:**\n   - For each grade, compare the number of male bus riders to \\(135\\%\\) of the female bus riders.\n   - Calculate the absolute difference from \\(135\\%\\).\n\n4. **Find the Grade with the Closest Ratio:**\n   - The grade with the smallest difference is the answer.\n\nLet's apply these steps to each grade.\n\n---\n\n### **9th Grade:**\n- **Male Bus Riders:** \\(300 \\times 41.1\\% = 123.3\\)\n- **Female Bus Riders:** \\(300 \\times 39.4\\% = 117.6\\)\n- **Desired Male/Female Ratio:** \\(123.3 / (1.35 \\times 117.6) = 1.008\\)\n- **Difference:** \\(|1.008 - 1| = 0.008\\)\n\n### **10th Grade:**\n- **Male Bus Riders:** \\(300 \\times 34.4\\% = 103.2\\)\n- **Female Bus Riders"
