            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \\( x \\). The problem gives me two logarithmic equations:\n\n1. \\( \\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2 \\)\n2. \\( \\log_y 5x = 2 \\)\n\nHmm, okay. I remember that logarithms can sometimes be manipulated using logarithmic properties. Let me take it step by step.\n\nStarting with the first equation: \\( \\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2 \\). I recall that \\( \\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (a \\cdot c) \\), so maybe I can combine these two logs.\n\nApplying that property, this equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2 \\)\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the log: \\( (x - y)(x + y) \\) is a difference of squares, so that's \\( x^2 - y^2 \\). Therefore, the equation is:\n\n\\( \\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2 \\)\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that \\( \\log_b a = c \\) is equivalent to \\( b^c = a \\). So here, \\( 6^2 = x^2 - y^2 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( 6^2 \\) is 36, so:\n\n\\( 36 = x^2 - y^2 \\)  --- Equation (1)\n\nOkay, so that's Equation (1). Now, moving on to the second equation: \\( \\log_y 5x = 2 \\). Again, using logarithmic properties, I can rewrite this equation.\n\nFirst, recall that \\( \\log_b a = c \\) is equivalent to \\( b^c = a \\). So here, \\( y^2 = 5x \\).\n\nSo, that gives:\n\n\\( y^2 = 5x \\)  --- Equation (2)\n\nGreat, now I have two equations: Equation (1) and Equation (2). Let me write them down again for clarity.\n\nEquation (1): \\( x^2 - y^2 = 36 \\)\n\nEquation (2): \\( y^2 ="

            "output": " 5x \\)\n\nHmm, since Equation (2) gives \\( y^2 \\) in terms of \\( x \\), I can substitute that into Equation (1). Let me try that.\n\nSubstituting Equation (2) into Equation (1):\n\n\\( x^2 - (5x) = 36 \\)\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\( x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0 \\)\n\nSo, I have a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0 \\). I need to solve for \\( x \\). Let me try factoring this quadratic.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm. Let's see.\n\nFactors of 36 are: 1, 36; 2, 18; 3, 12; 4, 9; 6, 6.\n\nLooking for a pair that subtracts to 5, since the product is negative. So, which pair would that be? Let's see:\n\n- 9 and 4: 9 - 4 = 5. Yes, that works. So we can write the quadratic as:\n\n\\( (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0 \\)\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n\\( (x - 9)(x + 4) = x^2 +4x -9x -36 = x^2 -5x -36 \\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, setting each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\( x - 9 = 0 \\) => \\( x = 9 \\)\n2. \\( x + 4 = 0 \\) => \\( x = -4 \\)\n\nSo, potential solutions are \\( x = 9 \\) or \\( x = -4 \\).\n\nBut wait, I need to check if both solutions are valid in the original logarithmic equations because logarithms have domain restrictions.\n\nFirst, looking at the first equation: \\( \\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2 \\). For this to be defined, the arguments must be positive.\n\nSo:\n\n\\( x - y > 0 \\) and \\( x + y > 0 \\)\n\nWhich implies:\n\n1. \\( x - y > 0 \\)\n2. \\( x + y > 0 \\)\n\nAlso, in the second equation:"

Therefore, the only possible solution is \\( x = 9 \\).\n\nBut let's not stop here. Let's find \\( y \\) to make sure that all the original conditions are satisfied with \\( x = 9 \\).\n\nFrom Equation (2): \\( y^2 = 5x \\), so if \\( x = 9 \\), then:\n\n\\( y^2 = 5 * 9 = 45 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( y = \\sqrt{45} \\) or \\( y = -\\sqrt{45} \\). But let's recall that in the first equation, \\( x + y > 0 \\) and \\( x - y > 0 \\).\n\nSince \\( x = 9 \\), let's check for both values of \\( y \\).\n\nCase 1: \\( y = \\sqrt{45} \\) which is approximately 6.708.\n\nCheck \\( x + y = 9 + 6.708 > 0 \\). That's definitely true.\n\nCheck \\( x - y = 9 - 6.708 \u2248 2.292 > 0 \\). Also true.

That's also true.\n\nCheck \\( x - y = 9 - (-6.708) = 15.708 > 0 \\). True.\n\nSo, both positive and negative \\( y \\) seem acceptable in terms of the domain.

Good.\n\nSecond equation:\n\n\\( \\log_y (5x) = \\log_{\\sqrt{45}} (45) \\). Because \\( 5x = 5*9=45 \\).\n\n\\( \\log_{\\sqrt{45}} 45 = \\frac{\\ln 45}{\\ln \\sqrt{45}} = \\frac{\\ln 45}{(1/2) \\ln 45} = 2 \\). So that's correct. So, \\( x = 9 \\) is valid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's make sure \\( x = -4 \\) is invalid. If \\( x = -4 \\), from Equation (2):\n\n\\( y^2 = 5*(-4) = -20 \\). Which is impossible because square of a real number can't be negative. So \\( x = -4 \\) is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\( x = 9 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{9}\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem, we need to find the value of \\( x \\).
