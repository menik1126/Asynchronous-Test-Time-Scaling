I remember some logarithm rules from algebra, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll need to think carefully.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations to have them clear:\n\n1. log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2. So, mathematically, that's:\n   \\[\n   \\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\n   \\]\n   \n2. The second equation is log base y of 5x equals 2:\n   \\[\n   \\log_y (5x) = 2\n   \\]\n   \nAlright, I need to solve for x. Let me tackle each equation one by one and see how they relate.\n\nStarting with the second equation because it seems simpler and perhaps I can express y in terms of x or vice versa. Let me recall that log_b (a) = c can be rewritten as b^c = a. So applying that here:\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\n\\log_y (5x) = 2 \\implies y^2 = 5x\n\\]\nSo, that gives me y squared equals 5 times x. I can write this as:\n\\[\ny^2 = 5x \\quad \\text{(Equation 2a)}\n\\]\nThis is useful because now I can express x in terms of y or y in terms of x. Since I might need to substitute one into the first equation, let's see how that goes.\n\nNow, moving on to the first equation:\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\n\\]\nI remember that the sum of two logs with the same base can be expressed as the log of the product. Specifically:\n\\[\n\\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (a \\times c)\n\\]\nSo applying that here:\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\nSimplifying the inside of the log:\n\\[\n(x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2\n\\]\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\\[\n"

            "output": "\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\n\\]\nTo get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that \\(\\log_b (k) = c \\implies b^c = k\\), so:\n\\[\n6^2 = x^2 - y^2\n\\]\nCalculating 6 squared:\n\\[\n36 = x^2 - y^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1a)}\n\\]\nNow I have two equations:\n\n1. Equation 1a: \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\)\n2. Equation 2a: \\(y^2 = 5x\\)\n\nHmm, let me substitute Equation 2a into Equation 1a to eliminate y^2. So, replacing y^2 in Equation 1a with 5x:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x = 36\n\\]\nThat simplifies to:\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\n\\]\nSo now I have a quadratic equation in terms of x. I need to solve for x. Let's see if I can factor this quadratic. The quadratic is \\(x^2 -5x -36 = 0\\).\n\nTo factor, I need two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Let me think: factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nLooking for a pair where one is positive and the other negative, so that their product is -36 and their sum is -5. Let's see:\n\n- Let's try 4 and -9: 4 * (-9) = -36, and 4 + (-9) = -5. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as:\n\\[\n(x + 4)(x - 9) = 0\n\\]\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n1. \\(x + 4 = 0 \\implies x = -4\\)\n2. \\(x - 9 = 0 \\implies x = 9\\)\n\nSo, the potential solutions for x are -4 and 9. But I can't forget that x is inside logarithms in the original equations, so the arguments of the logs must be"

Let me check both solutions to ensure they are valid.\n\nFirst, for x = -4:\n\nLooking at the first equation's arguments:\n- \\(x - y = -4 - y\\)\n- \\(x + y = -4 + y\\)\n\nSince log_6 requires the arguments to be positive:\n1. \\(-4 - y > 0 \\implies y < -4\\)\n2. \\(-4 + y > 0 \\implies y > 4\\)\n\nWait, these two conditions require y to be both less than -4 and greater than 4, which is impossible. So x = -4 is not a valid solution.\n\nNow, checking x = 9:\n\nAgain, the arguments:\n1. \\(9 - y > 0 \\implies y < 9\\)\n2. \\(9 + y > 0 \\implies y > -9\\)\n\nSo, y must be between -9 and 9. That's feasible. Now, let's also check if this satisfies Equation 2a: \\(y^2 = 5x = 5*9 = 45\\).\n\nSo, \\(y^2 = 45\\) implies y is sqrt(45) or -sqrt(45). Which is approximately 6.708 or -6.708.\n\nSo, y = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708 or y = -sqrt(45) ≈ -6.708.\n\nNow, since y must be between -9 and 9, both are acceptable. So, x = 9 is a valid solution.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me plug x = 9 back into both original equations to confirm.\n\nFirst, in the first equation:\n\nlog6(x - y) + log6(x + y) = 2\n\nWe know x = 9, so x - y = 9 - y and x + y = 9 + y.\n\nGiven that y^2 = 45, so y can be √45 or -√45. Let's take y = √45 first.\n\nThen x - y = 9 - √45 ≈ 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292\n\nx + y = 9 + √45 ≈ 9 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708\n\nCalculating log6(2.292) + log6(15.708) should equal 2.\n\nLet me compute each log"

So total approx 30 + 4.38 +1.416 +0.207 ≈ 36. So the product is 36, so log6(36) = 2, which matches the equation. So that works.\n\nSimilarly, if y is negative, say y = -√45 ≈ -6.708:\n\nThen x - y = 9 - (-6.708) = 15.708\n\nx + y = 9 + (-6.708) = 2.292\n\nSame product, so log6(15.708) + log6(2.292) is the same as before, so that also equals 2. So that works too.\n\nBut wait, we also need to check the second equation, log base y of 5x = 2.\n\nWait, log base y of 5x. Let me check for y = sqrt(45):\n\nFirst, y must be positive and not equal to 1, because logarithm base must be positive and not 1.\n\nsqrt(45) is positive and not 1, so that's okay. Let's see:\n\nlog_{sqrt(45)} (5*9) = log_{sqrt(4"

Wait, 5x is 5*9=45.\n\nSo log_{3√5} (45) = 2.\n\nBut 45 is (3√5)^2, since (3√5)^2=9*5=45.\n\nSo, log_{3√5} (45) = log_{3√5} ((3√5)^2) = 2, which is correct. So that works.\n\nSimilarly, for y = -sqrt(45), the base of a logarithm must be positive, so y cannot be negative. Thus, y can't be -sqrt(45). So only y = sqrt(45) is valid.\n\nSo, when x=9, y=sqrt(45)=3√5. So that's the only valid solution.\n\nTherefore, x=9 is the solution.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me make sure that when x=9 and y=3√5, the original logarithmic expressions are defined.\n\nFirst, log6(x - y) and log6(x + y):\n\nx - y = 9 - 3√5 ≈ 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292 > 0\n\nx + y = 9 + 3√5 ≈ 9 + 6.708 ≈ 15.708 > 0\n\nSo both logs are defined.\n\nSimilarly, in the second equation, log base y of 5x is defined because y is positive and not 1.\n\nSo everything checks out.\n\nSo, the value of x is 9.\n</think>\n\nNow, let's go through the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start with the second equation:\n   \\[\n   \\log_y (5x) = 2 \\implies y^2 = 5x\n   \\]\n2. Substitute \\( y^2 = 5x \\) into the first equation's simplified form:\n   \\[\n   \\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2 \\implies 36 = x^2 - y^2\n   \\]\n   Replace \\( y^2 \\) with \\(5x\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 5x = 36 \\implies x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\n   \\]\n3"
