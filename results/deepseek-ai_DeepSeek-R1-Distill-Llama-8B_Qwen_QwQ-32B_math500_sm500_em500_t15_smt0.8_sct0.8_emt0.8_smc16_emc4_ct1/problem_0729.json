            "output": "Alright, let me try to solve this problem. So, we have two logarithmic equations, and we need to find the value of x. Let me write them down again to have them clear:\n\n1. log base 6 of (x - y) + log base 6 of (x + y) = 2\n2. log base y of (5x) = 2\n\nHmm, okay. I think I should start with the second equation because it seems a bit simpler. Maybe I can express y in terms of x or vice versa. Let me recall the definition of a logarithm. If log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So, applying that to the second equation:\n\nlog_y(5x) = 2 implies that y^2 = 5x.\n\nAlright, so y squared is equal to 5 times x. That gives me a relationship between y and x. Maybe I can use this in the first equation. Let's go back to the first equation.\n\nlog_6(x - y) + log_6(x + y) = 2.\n\nI remember that the sum of two logarithms with the same base can be rewritten as the logarithm of the product. So, log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(a * c). Applying that here:\n\nlog_6[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nNow, the argument of the logarithm simplifies to (x - y)(x + y), which is a difference of squares. So, that becomes x² - y².\n\nSo, the equation now is log_6(x² - y²) = 2.\n\nUsing the definition of logarithm again, this means that 6^2 = x² - y². So, 36 = x² - y².\n\nNow, from the second equation, I have y² = 5x. So, maybe I can substitute y² in this equation.\n\nLet me write that down: 36 = x² - y². But since y² = 5x, then substituting:\n\n36 = x² - 5x.\n\nSo now, I have a quadratic equation: x² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nI need to solve for x. Let me try to factor this quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, let"

            "output": " me think. The factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6. Let's see, maybe 4 and -9? Because 4 * (-9) = -36 and 4 + (-9) = -5. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero: x + 4 = 0 => x = -4, or x - 9 = 0 => x = 9.\n\nWait, x is supposed to be a variable in a logarithm. Let me check if these solutions are valid. In the original equations, we have logarithms, so the arguments must be positive.\n\nFirst, let's consider x = -4. Let's see if that works.\n\nFrom the second equation, y² = 5x. So, if x = -4, then y² = 5*(-4) = -20. Hmm, y squared can't be negative because square of a real number is always non-negative. So, y² = -20 is impossible. Therefore, x = -4 is not a valid solution.\n\nOkay, so x must be 9. Let's check this.\n\nIf x = 9, then y² = 5*9 = 45. So, y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Which simplifies to y = 3*sqrt(5) or y = -3*sqrt(5).\n\nNow, let's plug these into the first equation to see if it holds.\n\nFirst, x = 9, y = 3√5. So, x - y = 9 - 3√5, and x + y = 9 + 3√5.\n\nTheir product is (9 - 3√5)(9 + 3√5) = 9² - (3√5)² = 81 - 9*5 = 81 - 45 = 36.\n\nSo, log base 6 of 36 is equal to log_6(6²) which is 2. So, yes, that works.\n\nSimilarly, if y = -3√5, then x - y = 9 - (-3√5) = 9 + 3√5,"

So, that also works.\n\nTherefore, x = 9 is a valid solution.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for x, so x = 9 is the solution.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Started with the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2 ⇒ y² = 5x.\n2. Substituted y² into the first equation: log_6(x² - y²) = 2 ⇒ x² - y² = 36.\n3. Replaced y² with 5x: x² - 5x = 36 ⇒ x² -5x -36 =0.\n4. Factored the quadratic equation: (x +4)(x -9)=0 ⇒ x= -4 or 9.\n5. Checked for validity: x=-4 makes y² negative, which is impossible. So, only x=9 is valid.\n6. Verified that x=9 satisfies both original equations.\n\nYeah, that seems solid. So, x must be 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given equations, we start with the second equation:\n\n\\[\n\\log_y (5x) = 2 \\implies y^2 = 5x\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( y^2 = 5x \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 ((x - y)(x + y)) = 2 \\implies \\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2 \\implies x^2 - y^2 = 36\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( y^2 = 5x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x = 36 \\implies x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic:\n\n\\[\n(x + 4)(x - 9) = 0 \\implies x = -4 \\text{ or } x = 9\n\\]\n\nChecking for valid solutions, we find \\( x = 9 \\) is valid as \\( y^2 = 45 \\) are real numbers.\n\n**Answer:**"
