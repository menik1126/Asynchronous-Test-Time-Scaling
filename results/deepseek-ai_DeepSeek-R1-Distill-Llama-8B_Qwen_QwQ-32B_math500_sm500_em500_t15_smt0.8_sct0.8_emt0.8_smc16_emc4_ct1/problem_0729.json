            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: If log base 6 of (x minus y) plus log base 6 of (x plus y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then I need to find x. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's like multiplying the arguments. So, log₆(A) + log₆(B) should be equal to log₆(AB). Let me check that: yes, that's a logarithm property. So, applying that here, this equation becomes log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nNow, the argument of the logarithm simplifies to (x - y)(x + y), which is a difference of squares. So that becomes x² - y². Therefore, log₆(x² - y²) = 2. To get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that log_b(C) = d means that b^d = C. So, 6² = x² - y². That simplifies to 36 = x² - y². I'll write that down: x² - y² = 36. Let me call this Equation 1.\n\nNext, the second equation is log_y(5x) = 2. Similarly, to get rid of the logarithm, I'll convert this into exponential form. So, y² = 5x. That's straightforward. I'll note that as Equation 2: y² = 5x.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. x² - y² = 36\n2. y² = 5x\n\nI can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1. Since y² = 5x, I can replace y² in the first equation with 5x. So, x² - 5x = 36.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in terms of x: x² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form ax² + bx + c = "

            "output": "0, so here a = 1, b = -5, and c = -36.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nx = [5 ± sqrt(25 + 144)] / 2\nx = [5 ± sqrt(169)] / 2\nx = [5 ± 13] / 2\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\nx = (5 + 13)/2 = 18/2 = 9\nx = (5 - 13)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4\n\nHmm, wait a second. The original logarithms have arguments (x - y) and (x + y). Since logarithms are only defined for positive numbers, (x - y) and (x + y) must both be greater than zero.\n\nLooking at the solutions, if x = 9, then y² = 5x = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Let's check if (x - y) and (x + y) are positive.\n\nIf y is positive, say y = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708, then x - y ≈ 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292 > 0, and x + y ≈ 15.708 > 0. So that's fine.\n\nIf y is negative, y = -sqrt(45) ≈ -6.708, then x - y ≈ 9 - (-6.708) ≈ 15.708 > 0, and x + y ≈ 9 + (-6.708) ≈ 2.292 > 0. So both cases are positive, so x = 9 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, what about x = -4? Let's see: y² = 5*(-4) = -20. But y² can't be negative because any real number squared is non-negative. So y² = -20 implies no real solution for y. Therefore, x = -4 is invalid.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nWait, just to double-check everything. Let me plug x = 9 back into Equation 2: y² = 5*9 = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Now, plug into Equation "

            "output": "1: x² - y² = 81 - 45 = 36, which matches the given. So yes, that works.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem, maybe by expressing x in terms of y from Equation 2 and then substituting into Equation 1?\n\nLet me try that. From Equation 2: y² = 5x, so x = y² / 5.\n\nSubstitute this into Equation 1: (y²/5)² - y² = 36.\n\nCalculating: (y^4)/25 - y² = 36.\n\nMultiply both sides by 25 to eliminate the denominator:\n\ny^4 - 25y² = 900.\n\nLet me set z = y². Then the equation becomes:\n\nz² - 25z - 900 = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in z. Using the quadratic formula:\n\nz = [25 ± sqrt(625 + 3600)] / 2\nz = [25 ± sqrt(4225)] / 2\nsqrt(4225) is 65, so:\n\nz = [25 + 65]/2 = 90/2 = 45\nz = [25 - 65]/2 = (-40)/2 = -20\n\nAgain, z represents y², so z can't be negative. Thus, z = 45. Therefore, y² = 45, so y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Then, x = y² / 5 = 45/5 = 9.\n\nSame result. So whether I solve for x first or for y, I end up with x = 9 as the only valid solution.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't miss anything in the original equations. The first equation had (x - y) and (x + y), which are both positive when x = 9 and y = sqrt(45), as I checked before. So that's fine. The second equation, log base y of (5x) = 2. When x = 9, 5x = 45, and y = sqrt(45), so log base sqrt(45) of 45. Let's compute that: (sqrt(45))^2 = 45, so log_{sqrt(45)}(45) = 2. Yep, that checks out. If y were negative, log base y wouldn't be defined"
