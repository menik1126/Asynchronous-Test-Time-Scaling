A plane is cutting through it in a specific way: it's parallel to edges AB and CD and it's lying halfway between them. This cut divides the tetrahedron into two pieces, and I need to find the surface area of one of these pieces.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a regular tetrahedron looks like. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal in length, so in this case, each edge is 2 units long.\n\nThe plane is parallel to edges AB and CD, which are skew lines in the tetrahedron because they don't intersect and aren't parallel. But even though they are skew, the plane can be positioned midway between them. So, the plane is equidistant from AB and CD.\n\nSince the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, I imagine that when it cuts through the tetrahedron, it will form a quadrilateral cross-section. However, because it's a tetrahedron, the cross-section might not be a regular shape. I need to figure out what shape this cross-section is and how it affects the surface area of the resulting pieces.\n\nLet me think about how to visualize this. If I can model the tetrahedron in a coordinate system, maybe that will help me figure out where the plane is cutting and what the cross-section looks like.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the vertices of the tetrahedron. A common way to represent a regular tetrahedron is to place one vertex at the origin and position the others accordingly. But I might need a symmetric coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider a regular tetrahedron inscribed in a sphere. The coordinates can be set using four points in 3D space such that all edges have the same length. However, perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nWait, maybe using vectors could be better here. Let me denote the vertices as points in space:\n\nLet\u2019s assign vertex A at (0, 0, 0).\n\nNow, for a regular tetrahedron with edge length 2, I need to find coordinates for B, C, and D such that each pair is 2 units apart.\n\nOne way to do this is to use the vertices of a regular tetrahedron with one vertex at the origin"

The coordinates can be set as follows:\n\nLet me recall that the coordinates of a regular tetrahedron can be given with edge length \u221a2, but since we need edge length 2, I might need to scale them.\n\nAlternatively, here's a standard coordinate system for a regular tetrahedron:\n\nLet me consider the vertices as:\n\nA = (1, 1, 1)\n\nB = (1, -1, -1)\n\nC = (-1, 1, -1)\n\nD = (-1, -1, 1)\n\nBut let me check the distance between A and B:\n\nDistance between A(1,1,1) and B(1,-1,-1):\n\nsqrt[(1-1)^2 + (-1-1)^2 + (-1-1)^2] = sqrt[0 + 4 + 4] = sqrt(8) = 2\u221a2. Hmm, that's edge length 2\u221a2. Since we need edge length 2, maybe we can scale down these coordinates by a factor of \u221a2. So dividing each coordinate by \u221a2:\n\nA = (1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2)\n\nB = (1/\u221a2, -1/\u221a2, -1/\u221a2)\n\nC = (-1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2, -1/\u221a2)\n\nD = (-1/\u221a2, -1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2)\n\nThen the distance between A and B would be sqrt[(0)^2 + (-2/\u221a2)^2 + (-2/\u221a2)^2] = sqrt[ (4/2) + (4/2) ] = sqrt[2 + 2] = sqrt(4) = 2. Perfect, that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler coordinate system. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, place vertex A at (0,0,0), vertex B at (2,0,0), vertex C at (1, sqrt(3), 0), and vertex D at (1, sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(6)/\u221a2). Wait, maybe that's more complicated.

The centroid of ABC is at ( (0 + 2 + 1)/3, (0 + 0 + sqrt(3))/3, 0 ) = (1, sqrt(3)/3, 0).

Wait, but AB and CD are skew lines, so they don't intersect, so the term \"midway between\" is a bit ambiguous.

So the face BCD is divided into two triangles: B-G-H and G-H-D.\n\nNow, in summary:\n\nEach original face is split into two parts by the plane, each of which is a triangle:\n\nFace ABC: split into A-E-G and E-G-B\n\nFace ABD: split into A-F-H and F-H-B\n\nFace ACD: split into A-E-F and E-F-D\n\nFace BCD: split into B-G-H and G-H-D\n\nThus, the two pieces of the tetrahedron after the cut have the following surfaces:\n\nPiece 1: The cross-sectional quadrilateral EFGH (wait, no, cross-section is actually a rectangle or another shape). Wait, actually, the cross-section is quadrilateral EFGH, but the two pieces also include parts of the original faces.\n\nBut let me think again: Each piece will have the cross-section as a face, plus the parts of the original faces.\n\nSo let me consider the two pieces:\n\nPiece 1: One of the pieces will have faces A-E-F, E-F-D, D-H-G, G-E-B, and the cross-section EFGH? Wait, perhaps not exactly.\n\nWait, actually, each piece is a polyhedron with:\n\n- Some of the original triangular faces\n\n- The cross-sectional quadrilateral\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to think about how the plane divides the tetrahedron.\n\nSince the plane cuts four edges, creating intersection points E, F, G, H, and the cross-section EFGH. Each original face is split into two parts.\n\nBut now, each piece will contain half of some original faces and the cross-section.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the areas of the original faces that remain attached to each piece, plus the cross-sectional area.\n\nSo to compute the surface area of one piece (let's say the one containing vertex A and B), the surface area would consist of:\n\n- The area of triangle A-E-F (from face ACD)\n\n- The area of triangle A-E-G (from face"

Wait, perhaps it's a pentahedron? Let me see.\n\nWait, the cross-section is a quadrilateral EFGH. The original vertex A is connected to E and F. The cross-section EFGH is part of the boundary. So the piece containing A would have vertices A, E, F, and the cross-section's vertices E, F, G, H? Wait, no, because G and H are on the other edges.\n\nWait, perhaps the piece containing A has vertices A, E, F, and the cross-section EFGH. But since E and F are on edges AC and AD, which are connected to A, so the piece would have vertices A, E, F, and the cross-section's other vertices?\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to compute the surface area by considering that each piece has the cross-section plus three of the original faces' halves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the surface area of each piece is half of the original surface area plus the cross-sectional area.

No, that's not the case. The cross-section is entirely on one side or the other.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. The cross-section is entirely within each piece.
