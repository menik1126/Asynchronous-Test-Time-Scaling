Each of them orders one dish, and they refuse to order the same dish. We need to find out how many different combinations of meals they can order, considering that the order matters (i.e., Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken).\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Choices:**\n   - **Total dishes available:** 10\n   - **Each person orders one dish:**\n     - Yann has **10 options** to choose from.\n     - After Yann has chosen, Camille cannot choose the same dish, so Camille has **9 options** left.\n\n2. **Calculating the Combinations:**\n   - For the first person (Yann), there are **10** possible choices.\n   - For the second person (Camille), since one dish is already taken by Yann, there are **9** choices left.\n\n   **Total number of combinations = Number of choices for Yann × Number of choices for Camille**\n   \\[\n   Total = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"
