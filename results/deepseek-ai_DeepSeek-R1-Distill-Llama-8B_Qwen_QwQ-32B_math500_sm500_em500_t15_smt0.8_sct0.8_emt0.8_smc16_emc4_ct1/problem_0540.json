There are 10 items on the menu, and both Yann and Camille want to order different dishes.\n\nSince Yann can choose any of the 10 items, and Camille needs to select a different one, Camille has 9 available options after Yann's choice.\n\nTo find the total number of possible combinations, I'll multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has. So, 10 multiplied by 9 equals 90 possible combinations.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the number of different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of dishes available:**\n   \n   There are **10** items on the menu.\n\n2. **Determine the number of choices for each person:**\n   \n   - **Yann** can choose **any** of the 10 dishes.\n   - **Camille** must choose a different dish from Yann. Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining choices.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of combinations:**\n   \n   Multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has:\n   \n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n   \\]\n   \n   So, there are **90** different combinations of meals they can order.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
