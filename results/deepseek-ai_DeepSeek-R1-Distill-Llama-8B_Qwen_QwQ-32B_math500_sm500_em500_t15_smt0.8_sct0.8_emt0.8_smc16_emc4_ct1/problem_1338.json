Hmm, if it's a polynomial equation, Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of the roots is equal to the coefficient of x^(n-1) divided by the coefficient of x^n, with a sign change.\n\nBut in this case, the equation isn't a polynomial; it's a rational equation. However, if we clear the denominators by multiplying through, we might end up with a polynomial equation. The degree of this polynomial could be high, but Vieta's formula can still be applied if we can figure out the degree.\n\nSo, let me try to clear the denominators. Multiply both sides by the common denominator: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\).\n\nThat would give:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2(x^2 -"
