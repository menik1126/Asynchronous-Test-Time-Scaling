Let me try to figure out how to approach this. It has four rational terms on the left and a linear term on the right. My goal is to find the sum of all complex solutions, so I don't need to find each solution individually, which would be really tough. Maybe there's a clever way to combine these terms or manipulate the equation to make it more manageable.\n\nFirst, I notice that each term on the left has a similar structure: the numerator is a constant, and the denominator is \\(x^2 - k\\), where \\(k\\) is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Maybe I can write each denominator in a factored form? Let me try that.\n\nSo, \\(x^2 - 1\\) factors into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\) doesn't factor nicely over integers, \\(x^2 - 3\\) similarly doesn't, and \\(x^2 - 4\\) factors into \\((x - 2)(x + 2)\\). Hmm, so not all of them factor nicely, but maybe partial fractions can help here.\n\nWait, partial fractions might be a good approach. If I can express each term on the left as a sum of simpler fractions, maybe I can combine them and simplify the equation. Let me recall how partial fractions work.\n\nFor each term like \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - m}\\), we can express it as \\(\\frac{A}{x - \\sqrt{m}} + \\frac{B}{x + \\sqrt{m}}\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants. Let me try this for each term.\n\nStarting with the first term: \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1}\\). Here, \\(m = 1\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x + 1)} = \\frac{A}{x - 1} + \\frac{"

This is a bit trickier because 2 isn't a perfect square. Let me express it as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{(x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{A}{x - \\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{B}{x + \\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\((x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})\\):\n\n\\[\n2 = A(x + \\sqrt{2}) + B(x - \\sqrt{2})\n\\]\n\nTo find \\(A\\), set \\(x = \\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\(2 = A(2\\sqrt{2}) + B(0)\\) \u21d2 \\(A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)\n\nSimilarly, set \\(x = -\\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\(2 = A(0) + B(-2\\sqrt{2})\\) \u21d2 \\(B = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}(x - \\sqrt{2})} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}(x + \\sqrt{2})}\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy with the square roots, but manageable.\n\nNext, the third term: \\(\\frac"

Let's try to group similar terms together.\n\nLooking at the denominators, each has a linear term, so perhaps when we combine all these fractions, they'll form a single rational function.

Maybe another approach would work better. Alternatively, instead of partial fractions, perhaps I can consider substituting \\(y = x - a\\) for each term, but that might not help much.

In polynomial equations, the sum of roots is given by Vieta's formula, which relates the coefficients. However, this isn't a polynomial equation because of the denominators.

Because each term in the product is a product of terms from each quadratic, each of which is either x^2 or -k. Therefore, all exponents in D(x) are even. Therefore, the coefficient of x^7 in D(x) is zero. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient 'a' (the coefficient of x^7) is zero. Therefore, the contribution to x^8 from (2010x -4) D(x) is 2010*0 -4*(coefficient of x^8 in D(x)). Wait, but the coefficient of x^8 in D(x) is 1, since the leading term is x^8. Wait, actually, the coefficient of x^8 in D(x) is 1, so the term is -4*1 = -4. Wait, but hold on:\n\nWait, D(x) is (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). The leading term is x^2 * x^2 * x^2 * x^2 = x^8, so the coefficient of x^8 is indeed 1. The coefficient of x^7 is zero, as all terms have even exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of x^8 in (2010x -4)*D(x) is (2010 * 0) + (-4)*1 = -4.\n\nNow, the other part of P(x) is the subtraction of the LHS terms.

The subtraction of the four terms (each degree 6) does not affect x^9 or x^8 coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^9 is 2010, and the coefficient of x^8 is -4, because as above, it's only the -4 D(x) term that contributes to x^8, and D(x) coefficient for x^8 is 1.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nCoefficient of x^9 in P(x): comes only from 2010x * D(x). As D(x) is degree 8, 2010x * D(x) gives 2010x^9 as the leading term, and the rest is lower degree. The subtraction of the LHS terms (each degree 6) doesn't affect the x^9 term. So indeed, coefficient of x^9 is 2010.\n\nCoefficient of x^8: comes from two places:\n\n1. From 2010x * D(x): as we saw, D(x) has no x^7 term, so 2010x * D(x) has no x^8 term from 2010x * (term x^7 of D(x)). However, the term from -4 * D(x) is -4*(x^8 term of D(x)) = -4*1 = -4.\n\n2. The subtraction of the four terms on LHS: each of these is degree 6, so their highest degree is x^6. Therefore, they don't contribute to x^8 or x^9.\n\nSo, overall, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is (-4). But wait, hold on.

Therefore, to find the sum of solutions of the original equation, we need to subtract the sum of these extraneous roots from Vieta's sum.\n\nSo, first, the Vieta's sum is 2/1005, as we found earlier.
