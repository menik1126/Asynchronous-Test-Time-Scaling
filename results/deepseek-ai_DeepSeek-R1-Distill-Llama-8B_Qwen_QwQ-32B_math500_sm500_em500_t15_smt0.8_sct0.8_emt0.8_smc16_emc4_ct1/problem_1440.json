Hmm, it looks a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that 3^{2x} can be rewritten as (3^2)^x, which simplifies to 9^x. So, the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That seems a bit simpler. \n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Both sides of the equation have exponents with base 9 and 10, which are both greater than 1, so maybe I can use logarithms. But I'm not sure exactly how yet. Let me think.\n\nAnother idea is to rearrange the equation to get all the x terms on one side. Let me subtract 9^x from both sides to get 19 = 10^x - 9^x. Hmm, that gives me 10^x - 9^x = 19. Still not sure how to solve this directly.\n\nMaybe I can express both 10 and 9 in terms of smaller numbers or relate them somehow. Wait, 10 is 9 + 1, so 10^x is (9 + 1)^x. Maybe I can expand that using the binomial theorem, but that might get complicated. Let's see how many terms I need. \n\nUsing the binomial expansion, (9 + 1)^x = 1^x + x*9^x + (x(x-1)/2!)*9^{x-1} + ... and so on. But if I subtract 9^x from this, I get 1 + x*9^x + ... = 19. That seems messy with an infinite series, so maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can try plugging in some integer values for x and see if they satisfy the equation. Let's start with small integers.\n\nLet me try x = 1:\nLeft side: 3^{2*1} + 19 = 9 + 19 = 28\nRight side: 10^1 = 10\n28 ≠ 10, so x=1 is not a solution.\n\nx = 2:\nLeft: 3^4 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100\nRight:"

Not equal. So left is less than right here.\n\nWait, but at x=2, they are equal. Let me check between x=1 and x=2.

Let me see the behavior.\n\nWait, when x approaches negative infinity, 10^x approaches 0, and 3^{2x}=9^x also approaches 0, so the left side approaches 19, which is greater than 0.

Wait, but when x is very negative, 9^x is approaching 0, so left side approaches 19, and 10^x approaches 0, so the equation becomes 19 = 0, which is not possible. So maybe the only solution is x=2?\n\nWait, but let me see what happens when x is less than 2. Let's try x=1.5 again.\n\nWait, for x=1, left=28, right=10. So left is higher. At x=2, left=100, right=100. So left meets right at x=2, and beyond x=2, left is 3^{2x}=9^x, which grows faster than 10^x? Wait, no, 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so for large x, 10^x will dominate. So at x=3, 10^3=1000, and 9^3=729, so right side is larger. So the function f(x)=10^x -9^x increases as x increases beyond 2.\n\nBut let's see, at x=2, f(x)=0. So maybe x=2 is the only solution.\n\nWait, but let me check for x=0.5:\n\nLeft:3^{1} +19=3+19=22\nRight:10^{0.5}=sqrt(10)≈3.16. So left is higher.\n\nx=1: left=28, right=10.\n\nx=2: both 100.\n\nx=3: left=748, right=1000.\n\nSo, the left side is higher at x=1, meets right at x=2, then right overtakes left at x=3.\n\nWait, but wait, if I graph f(x)=10^x -9^x, it starts at x=-infty approaching 0, at x=0: 1 -1=0."

Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, the original equation is 9^x +19 =10^x. So rearranged, 10^x -9^x =19. So the function f(x)=10^x -9^x equals 19 at x=2. Let's see the behavior of f(x):\n\nAt x=0: 1 -1 =0.\n\nAt x=1:10-9=1.\n\nAt x=2:100-81=19. So that's exactly the solution.\n\nAt x=3:1000-729=271.\n\nSo f(x) increases from 0 to infinity as x increases, passing through 1 at x=1, 19 at x=2, and then increasing further. So the equation f(x)=19 has only one solution at x=2.\n\nWait, but what about for x less than 2? Let's see, between x=1 and x=2, f(x) goes from 1 to 19, so it's increasing. So it only crosses 19 once at x=2. For x less than 2, f(x) is less than 19. For x greater than 2, it's more than 19. So the only solution is x=2.\n\nWait, but let me check x=1.5 again. f(1.5)=10^1.5 -9^1.5. Let me compute that numerically.\n\n10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)= approx 31.62.\n\n9^1.5 is sqrt(9^3)=sqrt(729)=27. So 31.62 -27≈4.62, which is less than 19.

So 0.1 -0.111≈-0.011, which is less than 19.\n\nAt x=0: 1-1=0.\n\nSo the function f(x)=10^x -9^x is negative for x<0, zero at x=0, positive for x>0, and increases as x increases beyond 0. So it's monotonic increasing. Therefore, there's only one solution where f(x)=19, which is x=2.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another point. Let's try x=1. Let's compute f(1)=10 -9=1. Then at x=2, it's 100 -81=19, so yes, it's increasing.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nI think that's it.
