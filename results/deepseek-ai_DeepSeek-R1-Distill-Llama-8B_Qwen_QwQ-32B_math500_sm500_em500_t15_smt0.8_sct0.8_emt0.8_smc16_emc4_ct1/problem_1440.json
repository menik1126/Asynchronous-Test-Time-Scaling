            "output": "Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, exponential equations can be tricky, but let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I notice that both sides of the equation have exponents with x. On the left side, there's 3^{2x}, which is the same as (3^2)^x or 9^x. So, I can rewrite the equation as 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That seems a bit simpler, so I think that's a good first step.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Since both 9^x and 10^x are exponential functions, they might not have algebraic solutions, which means I might need to use logarithms or another method. Maybe I can get all the terms on one side to see if it helps. Let me subtract 9^x from both sides to get 19 = 10^x - 9^x. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem immediately helpful. Alternatively, I could try to express everything in terms of the same base or find a substitution. Let me think about substitution. If I let y = 9^x, then 10^x would be (10/9)^x * 9^x, which is (10/9)^x * y. But that might complicate things more because now I have (10/9)^x, which isn't a constant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take the logarithm of both sides. But since the equation has addition, it might not be straightforward. Let me try that. If I take the natural log of both sides, I get ln(9^x + 19) = ln(10^x). That simplifies to ln(10^x) which is x*ln(10). However, the left side is ln(9^x + 19), which doesn't simplify easily because of the addition. So, that might not be the best approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider if there's an integer solution. Let me test some small integer values of x to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet's try x = 1:\n9^1 + 19 = 9 + 19 = 28\n10^1 = 10\n28 ≠ 10, so that's not a solution"

Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, 9^x grows slower than 10^x? Wait, 10^x grows faster than 9^x because the base is larger. Wait, but when x increases, 10^x will outpace 9^x.

Let's say x=3:\n\n9^3 +19=729 +19=748\n\n10^3=1000\n\n748 <1000. So, left side is less now. So, at x=2, left=right=100; at x=3, left=748, right=1000. So, left is less. So between x=2 and x=3, the right side overtakes the left. So, is there another intersection point between x=2 and x=3?\n\nWait, but we have at x=2, both 100.
