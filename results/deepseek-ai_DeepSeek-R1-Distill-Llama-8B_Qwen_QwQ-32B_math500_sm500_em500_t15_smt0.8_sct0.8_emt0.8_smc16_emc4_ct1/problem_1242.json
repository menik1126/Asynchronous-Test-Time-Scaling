            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer. It's x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, so I need to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. \n\nFirst off, since there's a square root in there, I remember that the expression inside the square root has to be non-negative. That means 11 - 2x must be greater than or equal to zero. So, let's write that down: 11 - 2x ≥ 0. Solving for x, I can add 2x to both sides to get 11 ≥ 2x, and then divide both sides by 2, which gives me 11/2 ≥ x, so x ≤ 5.5. That’s one condition that x has to satisfy.\n\nNow, moving on to the equation itself. It’s x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. Since there's a square root, maybe I can isolate it and then square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me try that. So, I'll subtract 4 from both sides: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x). Now, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides. That gives me (x - 4)² = (√(11 - 2x))². \n\nExpanding the left side, (x - 4)² is x² - 8x + 16, and the right side simplifies to 11 - 2x. So now, the equation is x² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x. Let me bring all the terms to one side to set the equation to zero. I'll subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides, resulting in x² - 6x + 5 = 0.\n\nAlright, so now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 6x + 5 = 0. I can solve this by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me try factoring first. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, 5 and 1. If I take -5 and -1, they multiply"

            "output": " to 5 and add up to -6. So, the factors are (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0. \n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives me the potential solutions: x - 5 = 0 ⇒ x = 5, and x - 1 = 0 ⇒ x = 1. So, my solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. But wait, I can't forget that earlier condition where x has to be less than or equal to 5.5. Both 1 and 5 satisfy that because 1 ≤ 5.5 and 5 ≤ 5.5, so that's good. But I also need to make sure that when I plug these values back into the original equation, they don't result in any issues, like taking the square root of a negative number or something else invalid.\n\nLet me check x = 1 first. Plugging into the original equation: 1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4. That simplifies to 1 = √(11 - 2) + 4, which is √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7. So, 1 = 7? Wait, that's not true. So x = 1 is actually not a solution. Hmm, that means I have to discard that solution.\n\nNow, let's check x = 5. Plugging in: 5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4. That becomes 5 = √(11 - 10) + 4, which is √1 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. So, 5 = 5. That works! So x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nHmm, so why did x = 1 come up as a solution when I squared both sides? Squaring can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions because both positive and negative roots are considered, but in the original equation, the square root is defined to be the principal (non-negative) root. So when I squared both sides, the equation allowed for both possibilities, but only the non-negative one is valid here. Therefore, in this case, x = 1 doesn't satisfy the original equation, so it's extraneous.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is x = 5. Let me just recap everything to make sure I didn't miss anything."

Then I solved the equation algebraically, got two solutions, and checked both in the original equation. One worked, the other didn't, so I discarded the invalid one. \n\nI think that's all. Sometimes these problems can have multiple solutions or extraneous ones, so it's always good to check your solutions in the original equation. Especially when you square both sides, which can sometimes create solutions that don't actually work. So, in this case, x = 5 is the only valid solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), we first consider the domain.
