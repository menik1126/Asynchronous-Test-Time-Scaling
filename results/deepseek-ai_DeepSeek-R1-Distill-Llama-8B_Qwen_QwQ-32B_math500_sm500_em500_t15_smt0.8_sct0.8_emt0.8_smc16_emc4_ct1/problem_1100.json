Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the function \\( f \\) is defined for non-negative integers \\( i \\) and \\( j \\), where \\( j \\) is between 0 and 4, inclusive. The function is defined recursively, which means I might need to break it down into smaller cases.\n\nThe function \\( f(i, j) \\) is defined in three cases:\n\n1. If \\( i = 0 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq j \\leq 4 \\), then \\( f(i, j) = \\text{mod}_5(j + 1) \\). So, for the base case when the first argument is 0, the function just increments \\( j \\) by 1 and takes the remainder when divided by 5.\n\n2. If \\( i \\geq 1 \\) and \\( j = 0 \\), then \\( f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1) \\). So, when the second argument is 0, we reduce \\( i \\) by 1 and set \\( j \\) to 1.\n\n3. If \\( i \\geq 1 \\) and \\( 1 \\leq j \\leq 4 \\), then \\( f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)) \\). This is the recursive case where both arguments are at least 1.\n\nSo, our goal is to compute \\( f(2015, 2) \\). That seems quite large, so I need to figure out a pattern or some kind of periodicity to make this manageable.\n\nLet me start by computing some small values of \\( f(i, j) \\) to see if I can notice a pattern.\n\nFirst, when \\( i = 0 \\):\n- \\( f(0, 0) = \\text{mod}_5(0 + 1) = 1 \\)\n- \\( f(0, 1) = \\text{mod}_5(1 + 1) = 2 \\)\n- \\( f(0, 2) = \\text{mod}_5(2 + 1) = 3 \\)\n- \\( f(0, 3"
