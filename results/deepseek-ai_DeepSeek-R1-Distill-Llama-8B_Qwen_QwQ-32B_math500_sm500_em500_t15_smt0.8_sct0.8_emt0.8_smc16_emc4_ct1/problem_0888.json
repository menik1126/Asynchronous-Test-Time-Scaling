            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, I first need to determine if it has a denominator with only the prime factors 2 and 5. \n\nThe denominator here is 160. Breaking it down, \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\\). Since it is composed solely of 2s and 5s, the fraction can be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n\nNext, I'll perform the division of 57 by 160. Dividing 57 by 160 gives 0.35625. Therefore, the terminating decimal representation of \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) is 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand Terminating Decimals\nA fraction will represent a terminating decimal if the denominator (after simplifying the fraction) has only the prime factors 2 and/or 5. \n\n### Step 2: Factorize the Denominator\nLet's factorize the denominator \\(160\\):\n\\[\n160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n\\]\nSince the denominator consists only of the prime factors 2 and 5, the fraction can be expressed as a terminating decimal.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Division\nDivide the numerator by the denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
