            "output": "I need to convert the fraction 57/160 into a terminating decimal. To do this, I'll first find the prime factors of both the numerator and the denominator. \n\nStarting with 57, I know it's divisible by 3 because 5 + 7 equals 12, which is a multiple of 3. So, 57 divided by 3 is 19, and 19 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factors of 57 are 3 and 19.\n\nNext, I'll factorize the denominator, 160. I begin by dividing 160 by 2 until I can no longer do so without getting a remainder. This gives me 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5, or 2⁴ × 5¹.\n\nNow, I'll check if there are any common factors between the numerator and the denominator. The numerator's factors are 3 and 19, while the denominator's factors are 2⁴ and 5¹. There are no common factors, which means the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nSince the denominator doesn't have any prime factors other than 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate. To find the decimal, I'll divide 57 by 160. \n\nPerforming the division, 57 divided by 160 is 0.35625. Therefore, the terminating decimal representation of 57/160 is 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction $\\frac{57}{160}$ to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - **Numerator (57)**:  \n     57 can be factorized into \\( 3 \\times 19 \\).\n   - **Denominator (160)**:  \n     160 can be factorized into \\( 2^4 \\times 5 \\).\n\n2. **Check for Common Factors**:\n   - There are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator. This means the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Determine if the Decimal Will Terminate**:\n   - A fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5 after simplifying.  \n     Here, the denominator has only \\( 2 \\) and \\( 5 \\) as prime factors, so the decimal will terminate.\n\n4. **Convert to Decimal**:\n   - Perform the division \\( "
