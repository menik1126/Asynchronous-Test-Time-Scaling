To do this, I'll start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions.\n\nCross-multiplying gives me \\(2(x - 5) = 3 \\times 4\\). Simplifying both sides, I get \\(2x - 10 = 12\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate the term with \\(x\\) by adding 10 to both sides of the equation. This results in \\(2x = 22\\).\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\(x\\), which gives me \\(x = 11\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x-5}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cross-multiply** to eliminate the fractions:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times (x - 5) = 3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x - 10 = 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate the term with \\(x\\)** by adding 10 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x - 10 + 10 = 12 + 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2x = 22\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\)** by dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{22}{2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 11\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
