            "output": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt[(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2]. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root, which is called the radicand, must be greater than or equal to zero. So, I need to set up an inequality:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0.\n\nAlright, let me simplify this expression. I can expand both squares first.\n\nStarting with (x - 3)^2:\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nNow, expanding (x - 8)^2:\n(x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64.\n\nSo, subtracting these two:\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64).\n\nLet's distribute the negative sign into the second parentheses:\nx^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\nx^2 - x^2 cancels out (they are the same term, so subtracting them gives zero).\n-6x + 16x = 10x.\n9 - 64 = -55.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 10x - 55.\n\nTherefore, the inequality becomes:\n10x - 55 ≥ 0.\n\nLet me solve for x:\n10x - 55 ≥ 0\nAdd 55 to both sides:\n10x ≥ 55\nDivide both sides by 10:\nx ≥ 5.5.\n\nWait, so x has to be greater than or equal to 5.5 for the expression inside the square root to be non-negative. That means the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x such that x ≥ 5.5.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest real number x in the domain of g. Since the domain starts at x = 5.5 and goes upwards, the smallest x is 5.5.\n\nHold on, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expanding the squares correctly, then subtracting, combining like"

That seems right.\n\nI wonder if 5.5 can be expressed as a fraction? 5.5 is the same as 11/2, right? So, maybe writing it as 11/2 is better, depending on the context. But since the question asks for the smallest real number, both 5.5 and 11/2 are correct, but I think 5.5 is more straightforward.\n\nIs there a possibility that x could be smaller than 5.5? Let me test x = 5. Plugging into the original expression:\n\ng(5) = sqrt[(5-3)^2 - (5-8)^2] = sqrt[4 - 9] = sqrt[-5], which is not a real number. So, x=5 is not in the domain.\n\nWhat about x=5.5? Plugging in:\n\ng(5.5) = sqrt[(5.5 -3)^2 - (5.5 -8)^2] = sqrt[2.5^2 - (-2.5)^2] = sqrt[6.25 - 6.25] = sqrt[0] = 0. So, it works. That's the minimum value where the expression inside becomes zero, so it's included in the domain.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the smallest real number x in the domain of g is 5.5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \\), we first set up the inequality for the radicand to be non-negative:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nExpanding both squares:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\n\\]\n\\[\n(x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64\n\\]\n\nSubtracting these:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + "
