It\u2019s a rational equation, meaning it's fractions equal to another fraction. And this is true for all real x except x = 3 and x = -8. That makes sense because if x were 3 or -8, the denominators on the left side would become zero, which is undefined.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nLeft side: two fractions, C over (x - 3) and D over (x + 8).\n\nRight side: a single fraction with numerator 4x - 23 and denominator x\u00b2 + 5x - 24.\n\nI remember that when you have fractions like this and they're equal for all x (except specific values), you can combine the left side into a single fraction and then compare the numerators. That should give us an equation that can help solve for C and D.\n\nFirst, I think I need to combine the two fractions on the left side to have a common denominator. The common denominator would be (x - 3)(x + 8). So, I can rewrite each fraction with this common denominator.\n\nFor the first fraction, C/(x - 3), I need to multiply numerator and denominator by (x + 8) to get the common denominator. Similarly, for the second fraction, D/(x + 8), I'll multiply numerator and denominator by (x - 3).\n\nSo, left side becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nCombine the numerators:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nThat equals the right side, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are the same, we can set the numerators equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - "

Let me expand the left side first.\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = (C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nSo, the left side is (C + D)x + (8C - 3D). The right side is 4x - 23. Therefore, the coefficients of x and the constant terms must be equal.\n\nSo, setting up equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve this system. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nLet me solve Equation 1 for C:\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nThen substitute into Equation 2:\n\n8*(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nCompute 8*(4 - D):\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo D is 5. Then substitute back into Equation 1:\n\nC + 5 = 4 => C = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nWait, so C is -1 and D is 5. Therefore, the product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nHmm, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, combining the fractions: yes, the denominators are (x-3)(x+8). The numerator becomes C(x+8) + D(x-3). Then equate to 4x -23. Then expanding gives (C + D)x +"

So, equations:\n\nC + D = 4\n\n8C -3D = -23\n\nSolved for C = 4 - D, substituted in:\n\n8*(4 - D) = 32 -8D\n\nThen 32 -8D -3D = 32 -11D = -23\n\nSo 32 +23 = 11D? No, wait, 32 -11D = -23\n\nSo, 32 -11D = -23\n\n32 +23 = 11D\n\n55 = 11D\n\nD = 5, correct. Then C = 4 - 5 = -1.\n\nSo CD = (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nLet me double-check by plugging back into the original equation.\n\nLeft side: C/(x-3) + D/(x+8) = (-1)/(x-3) + 5/(x +8)\n\nRight side: (4x -23)/(x\u00b2 +5x -24)\n\nLet me compute left side:\n\n(-1)/(x -3) +5/(x +8) = [ - (x +8) +5(x -3) ] / (x -3)(x +8)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n- x -8 +5x -15 = ( -x +5x ) + ( -8 -15 ) = 4x -23.\n\nYes, numerator is 4x -23.
