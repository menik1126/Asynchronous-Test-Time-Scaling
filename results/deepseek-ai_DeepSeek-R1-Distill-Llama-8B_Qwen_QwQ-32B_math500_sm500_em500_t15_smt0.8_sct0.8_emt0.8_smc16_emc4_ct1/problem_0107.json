            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve. It's about finding the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n(C)/(x - 3) + (D)/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/(x\u00b2 + 5x - 24)\n\nAnd this has to hold true for all real values of x except -8 and 3 because those would make the denominators zero, which is undefined.\n\nHmm, I remember that when you have fractions like this on the left side, and they equal some other fraction on the right, you can combine them into a single fraction by finding a common denominator. That common denominator would be the product of the denominators of the two fractions on the left, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). That should clear the denominators and let me solve for C and D.\n\nLet me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, rewrite the left side:\n\nC/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = [C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nSo the left side becomes this single fraction, and that's equal to the right side, which is (4x - 23)/(x\u00b2 + 5x - 24). Wait, the denominator on the right side is x\u00b2 + 5x - 24. Maybe I can factor that to check if it's the same as (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me try factoring it.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to +5. Hmm, 8 and -3: 8 * (-3) = -24, and 8 + (-3) = 5. So yeah, x\u00b2 + 5x - 24 factors into (x + 8)(x - 3). That matches the denominator on the left side. So the denominators are the same, which means the numerators must be equal. So the equation simplifies to:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, I need to solve for C and D. Since this equation must hold for all x except -8 and 3, the coefficients for each power of x on both sides must be equal. So I can expand the left side and"

So, setting coefficients equal:\n\nFor x term: C + D = 4\nFor constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow I have a system of two equations:\n\n1) C + D = 4\n2) 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve this system for C and D. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is better here because substitution might lead to fractions.\n\nLet's try to eliminate one variable. Let me solve equation 1 for one variable, say D. So D = 4 - C.\n\nThen substitute D = 4 - C into equation 2:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nExpanding this:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8C + 3C) - 12 = -23\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, substitute C = -1 back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Now, the question asks for the product CD. So CD = (-1) * 5 = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, substitute C and D back into the left side equation to see if it equals the right side.\n\n(C)/(x - 3) + (D)/(x + 8) = (-1)/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8)\n\nCombine them with the common denominator (x - 3)(x + 8):\n\n[(-1)(x + 8) + 5(x - 3)] / (x - 3)(x + 8)\n\nExpanding numerator:\n\n-"
