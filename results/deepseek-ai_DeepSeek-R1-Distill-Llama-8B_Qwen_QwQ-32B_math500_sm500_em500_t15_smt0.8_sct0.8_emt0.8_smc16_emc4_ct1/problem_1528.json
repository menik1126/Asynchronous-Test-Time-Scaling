Hmm, okay. So \\( n \\) has to be a positive integer, right? Since we're dealing with a sequence of positive real numbers.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with sums of powers, there are some inequalities that relate them, like the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the Power Mean inequality. Maybe I can use those here.\n\nLet me think: The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality relates the sum of products to the product of sums, but I'm not sure how directly applicable it is here. Maybe I should consider the Power Mean inequality instead.\n\nThe Power Mean inequality states that for positive real numbers, the mean of the \\( k \\)-th powers is greater than or equal to the mean of the \\( m \\)-th powers if \\( k > m \\). So, in this case, since we have the first, second, and third powers, perhaps I can relate the means.\n\nLet me write down the Power Mean inequality for \\( k = 3 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\). The Power Mean for \\( k=3 \\) is \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i^3 \\right)^{1/3} \\) and for \\( m=1 \\) is \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum a_i \\right) \\). Since \\( k > m \\), the former is greater than or equal to the latter:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{216}{n} \\right)^{1/3} \\geq \\frac{96}{n}\n\\]\n\nSimplify this inequality:\n\nCube both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{216}{n} \\geq \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^3\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n \\)"

For the Power Mean inequality, equality holds when all the \\( a_i \\) are equal.

If \\( n > 64 \\), each \\( a_i \\) would be \\( 96/n \\), which is less than \\( 96/64 = 1.5 \\). Then, the sum of squares would be \\( n*(96/n)^2 = 144 \\), same as before, but if each \\( a_i \\) is less than 1.5, the sum of squares should be less than when all are equal.\n\nBut the sum of squares is given as 144, which is exactly the case when all are equal.
