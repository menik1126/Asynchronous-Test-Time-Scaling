The given conditions are the sums of the first, second, and third powers of these numbers, all equaling 96, 144, and 216 respectively. Hmm, that's interesting. I think I need to use some algebraic identities or maybe Cauchy-Schwarz or something related to power sums.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given information:\n\n- Sum of the numbers: S₁ = 96\n- Sum of the squares: S₂ = 144\n- Sum of the cubes: S₃ = 216\n\nAnd I need to find all possible values of n, then sum them up. \n\nI remember that for sequences of numbers, especially when dealing with power sums, there's something called Newton's identities which relate the power sums to each other and to the elementary symmetric sums. Maybe I can use that. Newton's formulas connect the sums of powers to the symmetric sums, which in turn can be related to the roots of a polynomial. \n\nIf I consider the numbers a₁, a₂, ..., a_n as roots of a polynomial, then perhaps I can find relationships between S₁, S₂, and S₃. Let me recall that for a monic polynomial with roots a₁, a₂, ..., a_n, the elementary symmetric sums are related to the coefficients. Specifically, the first few symmetric sums are:\n\n- e₁ = a₁ + a₂ + ... + a_n = S₁ = 96\n- e₂ = a₁a₂ + a₁a₃ + ... + a_{n-1}a_n\n- e₃ = a₁a₂a₃ + ... \n\nAnd so on. The coefficients can be expressed in terms of these symmetric sums.\n\nBut I don't know e₁, e₂, etc., directly. However, Newton's identities relate the power sums to these elementary symmetric sums. For example, for the first few power sums:\n\n- S₁ = e₁\n- S₂ = e₁ S₁ - 2e₂\n- S₃ = e₁ S₂ - e₂ S₁ + 3e₃\n\nI can plug in the known values here to solve for e₂ and e₃.\n\nSo, let me compute S₂ first:\n\nS₂ = e₁ S₁ - 2e₂\n144 = 96"

Let me recall the exact form. The general formula for Newton's identities is:\n\nFor k ≥ 1,\n\nS_k - e₁ S_{k-1} + e₂ S_{k-2} - ... + (-1)^{k-1} e_{k-1} S₁ + (-1)^k k e_k = 0\n\nHmm, so for k=2,\n\nS₂ - e₁ S₁ + 2e₂ = 0\n\nTherefore,\n\nS₂ = e₁ S₁ - 2e₂\n\nWait, so rearranged, that gives:\n\n2e₂ = e₁ S₁ - S₂\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n2e₂ = 96 * 96 - 144\n\nWait, hold on, 96 * 96 is 9216, so 9216 - 144 = 9072, so 2e₂ = 9072, so e₂ = 4536.\n\nWait, that seems really big. Let me check again. Wait, S₁ is 96, so e₁ is 96. Then S₂ is 144. So according to the formula:\n\nS₂ = e₁ * S₁ - 2e₂ ?\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, the formula is S₂ = e₁ S₁ - 2e₂? Wait, but S₁ is the sum of the variables, so S₁ is e₁. So S₂ = e₁^2 - 2e₂? Wait, that's another way to think about it. Let me see:\n\nThe sum of squares is (a₁ + a₂ + ... + a_n)^2 = sum a_i^2 + 2 sum_{i<j} a_i a_j. Therefore,\n\nsum a_i^2 = e₁² - 2e₂\n\nSo that gives:\n\n144 = 96² - 2e₂\n\nWhich is the same as before. So 96 squared is 9216, so 9216 - 2e₂ = 144, so 2"

So if e₂ is 4536, then the sum of the products of the numbers two at a time is 4536.\n\nMoving on to k=3. So for S₃, the formula would be:\n\nS₃ = e₁ S₂ - e₂ S₁ + 3e₃\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n216 = 96 * 144 - 4536 * 96 + 3e₃\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated, but let's compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 96 * 144. Let me calculate that. 96 * 100 is 9600, 96 * 44 is 4224, so total is 9600 + 4224 = 13824.\n\nSecond term: e₂ * S₁ = 4536 * 96. Hmm, 4536 * 100 is 453600, subtract 4536 *4=18144, so 453600 - 18144=435456. So 4536*96=435456.\n\nThird term: 3e₃.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n216 = 13824 - 435456 + 3e₃\n\nCompute 13824 - 435456: 13824 - 435456 = -421632\n\nSo:\n\n216 = -421632 + 3e₃\n\nBring -421632 to the left:\n\n216 + 421632 = 3e₃\n\n216 + 421632 = 421848\n\nSo 421848 = 3e₃\n\nThus, e₃ = 421848 / 3 = 140,616.\n\nOkay, so e₃ is 140,616.\n\nNow, I have e₁=96, e₂=4536, e₃=140,616, but I'm not sure how that helps me find n.\n\nWait, the problem says the numbers are positive real numbers, so the elementary symmetric sums have specific properties. But I don't immediately see how to relate e₁, e₂, e₃ to n. Maybe I can think about the case where all the numbers are equal because that might give me some constraints on n.\n\nSuppose all a_i are equal. Then each a_i = 96/n, since sum"

So if all a_i are equal, then n=64, but is that the only case?\n\nWait, but 64 is a possible value for n, but the problem says \"sum of all possible values of n\", so maybe there are more? Or maybe 64 is the only possible value.\n\nBut to check that, I need to see if the given power sums can only correspond to the case when all the a_i are equal, or if other configurations are possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The sum of a_i squared is 144, and the sum of a_i is 96. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality tells us that:\n\n(Sum a_i)^2 ≤ n * Sum a_i²\n\nSo 96² ≤ n * 144\n\nCompute 96²=9216, so 9216 ≤ 144n ⇒ n ≥ 9216 /144=64.\n\nSo n must be at least 64. But equality holds when all a_i are equal, so n=64 is the minimal possible n.\n\nBut what about the maximal possible n? Hmm, that might be tricky. Since the terms are positive real numbers, n can be as large as possible, but the sum of cubes is fixed at 216. Wait, but as n increases, the numbers can be made very small, but their cubes would become very small, so perhaps n can't be too large.\n\nWait, but maybe n is constrained by the other sums. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all n ≥64 are possible? Because for n=64, all a_i=96/64=1.5. Then sum a_i²=64*(2.25)=144, yes, sum a_i^3=64*(3.375)=216, which matches. So n=64 is possible.\n\nNow, could n be larger than 64?\n\nSuppose n is 65. Then can we have positive real numbers a₁, a₂,...,a_65 with sum 96, sum of squares 144, sum of cubes 216?\n\nWait, let me check. If n increases beyond 64, the individual terms must become smaller"

But perhaps more importantly, the sum of squares being 144, and the sum being 96, so the mean is 96/n.\n\nSo the sum of squares is 144, so sum (a_i - 96/n)^2 = sum a_i² - (sum a_i)^2 /n = 144 - 96² /n.\n\nFor non-negative variance, this must be non-negative, so 144 - 96² /n ≥ 0 ⇒ n ≥ 96² /144 = 64, as we saw before.\n\nSo n must be at least 64.\n\nBut can n be larger than 64? Let me think. Suppose we have n=65, can we have positive real numbers satisfying the given sums?\n\nWait, perhaps. Let me try to see if that's possible.\n\nLet me assume that n=65 is possible. Then, the mean is 96/65 ≈1.4769.\n\nThen, the sum of squares is 144. So the variance would be 144/n - (mean)^2 = 144/65 - (96/65)^2.\n\nCompute that: 144/65 ≈2.2154, and (96/65)^2≈(1.4769)^2≈2.1815. So variance≈2.2154 - 2.1815≈0.0339. So that's positive, possible.\n\nSimilarly, sum of cubes is 216. Let me compute the mean of cubes: 216/65≈3.2923.\n\nBut since the mean of cubes can be higher than the cube of the mean if the numbers aren't all equal, but in our earlier case when n=64, all numbers are 1.5, so their cubes are 3.375, and the sum is 216, so each is 3.375. So if n=65, perhaps one of the numbers is slightly higher and another is slightly lower?\n\nBut maybe it's complicated to check if that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps n=64 is the only possible value. Because when all numbers are equal, we get the minimal possible n, and for higher n, it's impossible because of some constraints.\n\nWait, but earlier, when n=65, the variance was positive, which is"

Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Hölder's inequality?\n\nWait, Hölder's inequality states that (sum a_i^3)^{1/3} (sum 1)^{2/3} ≥ (sum a_i).

Let me compute the ratio between the sums:\n\nS₁ = 96, S₂ = 144, S₃ = 216.\n\nNotice that S₂ = (96)^2 / 64, since 96^2 is 9216, divided by 64 is 144. Similarly, S₃ = (96)^3 / (64)^2?

Now, the question is whether another value of n is possible.\n\nWait, if n>64, then S₂ =144 < 96² /n, which is only possible if n=64 because for n>64, 96² /n <144. Wait, but according to Cauchy-Schwarz, equality holds when all the a_i are equal, so for n>64, we must have S₂ >96² /n, so if n>64, then 96² /n <144, which would mean that sum a_i² must be greater than 96² /n, but in our case it's exactly 144 when n=64. So for n>64, does that mean sum a_i² would have to be greater than 96² /n?\n\nWait, but if n increases beyond 64, 96² /n decreases, so 144 would be greater than that, so sum a_i² >96² /n, which is okay, as the variance would be positive.\n\nBut then, the problem is, given that S₁=96, S₂=144, S₃=216, can we have more than one value of n possible?\n\nI think that the problem is that for n=64, all variables are equal, and for n=65, maybe they're not, but can such a configuration exist?

Therefore, n=64 is the only possible value.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of n is 64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{64}\n</think>\n\nGiven the sequence \\((a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)\\) of positive real numbers with the conditions:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96, \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144, \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216,\n\\]\n\nwe need to find the sum of all possible values of \\(n\\).\n\nFirst, we use the given sums to find the elementary symmetric sums \\(e_1\\), \\(e_2\\), and \\(e_3\\). Using Newton's identities, we have:\n\n1. \\(e_1 = 96\\).\n2. \\(S_2 = e_1^2 - 2e_2\\):\n   \\[\n   144 = 96^2 - 2e_2 \\implies 144 = 9216 - 2e_2 \\implies 2e_2 = 9072 \\implies e_2 = 4536.\n   \\]\n3. \\(S_3 = e_1 S_2 - e_2 S_1 + 3e_3\\):\n   \\[\n   216 = 96 \\cdot 144 - 4536 \\cdot 96 + 3e_3 \\implies 216 = 13824 - 435456 + 3e_3 \\implies 3e_3 = 421848 \\implies e_3 = 140616.\n   \\]\n\nNext, we consider the case where all \\(a_i\\) are equal. If they are all equal, each \\(a_i = \\frac{96}{n}\\). Then:\n\n- Sum of squares: \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = n \\left"
