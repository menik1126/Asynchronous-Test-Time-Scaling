There are 4 stamps with prices listed.\n\nThen, I'll find the total cost by adding up the prices of these stamps: 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 equals 49 cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per 70s stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the number of stamps: 49 divided by 4 is 12.25 cents.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo find the average price of Juan's **70's** stamps, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices of 70's Stamps:**\n\n   From the chart:\n   - **Brazil (70s):** 12 cents\n   - **France (70s):** 12 cents\n   - **Peru (70s):** 12 cents\n   - **Spain (70s):** 13 cents\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of 70's Stamps:**\n\n   There are **4** stamps listed for the 70's.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost of 70's Stamps:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 = 49 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Average Price of 70's Stamps:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Price} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Number of Stamps}} = \\frac{49}{4} = 12.25 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{12.3}"
