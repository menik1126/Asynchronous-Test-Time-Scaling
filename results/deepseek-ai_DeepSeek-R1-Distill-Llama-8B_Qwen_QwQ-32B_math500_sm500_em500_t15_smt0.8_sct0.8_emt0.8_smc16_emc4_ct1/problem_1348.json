            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dividing polynomials, we can use polynomial long division, or maybe synthetic division. Since the divisor is linear, \\( x + 1 \\), synthetic division might be quicker. But just to make sure I understand, let me recall how both methods work.\n\nFirst, polynomial long division. Let me outline the steps. I need to divide \\( x^6 - 3 \\) by \\( x + 1 \\). So, set it up like a long division problem. The dividend is \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\), because I'm writing out all the terms up to the constant term to fill in the division setup.\n\nThe divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), so I'll write that outside. Then, I'll proceed step by step:\n\n1. Divide the first term of the dividend, \\( x^6 \\), by the first term of the divisor, \\( x \\), which gives \\( x^5 \\).\n2. Multiply the entire divisor, \\( x + 1 \\), by \\( x^5 \\), resulting in \\( x^6 + x^5 \\).\n3. Subtract this product from the dividend: \\( (x^6 + 0x^5 + \\dots) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 \\).\n4. Bring down the next term, which is already 0x^4, so now we have -x^5 + 0x^4.\n5. Repeat the process: divide -x^5 by x, which gives -x^4.\n6. Multiply the divisor by -x^4: \\( -x^5 - x^4 \\).\n7. Subtract this from the current dividend: (-x^5 + 0x^4) - (-x^5 - x^4) = x^4.\n8. Bring down the next term, 0x^3, so now it's x^4 + 0x^3.\n9. Divide x^4 by x, which gives x^3.\n10. Multiply the divisor by x"

Multiply the divisor by -x^2: \\( -x^3 - x^2 \\).\n15. Subtract: (-x^3 + 0x^2) - (-x^3 - x^2) = x^2.\n16. Bring down the next term, 0x: so it's x^2 + 0x.\n17. Divide x^2 by x: x.\n18. Multiply the divisor by x: x^2 + x.\n19. Subtract: (x^2 + 0x) - (x^2 + x) = -x.\n20. Bring down the next term, which is -3: so now it's -x - 3.\n21. Divide -x by x: -1.\n22. Multiply the divisor by -1: -x - 1.\n23. Subtract: (-x - 3) - (-x -1) = -2.\n24. So, the remainder is -2, and the quotient is x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But maybe I should double-check using synthetic division to see if I get the same quotient.\n\nSynthetic division uses the root corresponding to the linear divisor. Since the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), the root is \\( x = -1 \\). So, I'll set up the coefficients of the dividend. The dividend is \\( x^6 - 3 \\), which can be written as \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\). The coefficients are 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root -1, the setup is:\n\n-1 | 1  0  0  0  0  0  -3\n\nI"

Add to next coefficient: 0 + (-1) = -1.\n\nMultiply -1 by -1: 1. Add to last coefficient: -3 + 1 = -2.\n\nSo, the coefficients of the quotient are: 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, and the remainder is -2. Therefore, the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\), same as before.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same quotient and a remainder of -2. Thus, the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\) is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\) with a remainder of -2. But the question specifically asks for the quotient, so I don't need to mention the remainder unless it's required.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result. Let me just verify it by multiplying the quotient by \\( x + 1 \\) and adding the remainder to see if I get back to the original dividend.\n\nSo, multiplying \\( (x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1)(x + 1) \\):\n\nFirst, distribute \\( x \\) to each term:\n\n\\( x*(x^5) = x^6 \\)\n\n\\( x*(-x^4) = -x^5 \\)\n\n\\( x*(x^3) = x^4 \\)\n\n\\( x*(-x^2) = -x^3 \\)\n\n\\( x*(x) = x^2 \\)\n\n\\( x*(-1) = -x \\)\n\nThen, distribute 1 to each term:\n\n\\( 1*(x^5) = x"

Then, adding the remainder from synthetic division, which is -2, so:\n\nx^6 - 1 -2 = x^6 -3.\n\nWhich matches the original dividend. So yes, that confirms that the quotient is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to find the quotient is using the Remainder Theorem, but that only gives the remainder. However, since I needed the quotient, the long division or synthetic division methods were necessary.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've used two methods to arrive at the same quotient, and then checked the result by multiplying back. So, I'm pretty sure that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\), we can use synthetic division. \n\nThe coefficients of the polynomial \\( x^6 - 3 \\) are \\( 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3 \\).
