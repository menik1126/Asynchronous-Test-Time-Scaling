Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with symmetric equations involving variables like \\( x, y, z \\), it might be useful to use symmetric sums or Vieta's formulas. Maybe if I can express everything in terms of elementary symmetric sums, that could help me find the value I'm looking for.\n\nSo, let me denote the elementary symmetric sums as follows:\n\n- \\( S_1 = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( S_2 = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( S_3 = xyz \\)\n\nFrom the problem, I know \\( S_3 = 4 \\).\n\nI also notice that the second equation is \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). I remember that there's a formula for the sum of cubes:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\)\n\nSo substituting what I know into this formula:\n\n\\( 4 = S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 + 3 \\times 4 \\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( 4 = S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 + 12 \\)\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n\\( S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 = 4 - 12 \\)\n\\( S_1^3 - 3 S_1 S_2 = -8 \\)  --- Equation (A)\n\nOkay, so that's one equation involving \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\). I need another equation to solve for these.\n\nLooking at the third given equation:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = "

Alternatively, perhaps if I let variables be equal.\n\nWait, but if x = y = z, then xyz = x^3 = 4, so x = cube root of 4, which is approximately 1.587. Then, let's check x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3x^3 = 3*(4) = 12, but in the problem, it's 4. So nope, that's not equal.\n\nSo, they can't be all equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two variables are equal, and one is different. Let me suppose that x = y, so then:\n\nFrom xyz = 4, if x = y, then x^2 z = 4 => z = 4 / x^2.\n\nNow, compute x^3 + y^3 + z^3. Since x = y, it's 2x^3 + z^3.

Let me check that again.\n\nEarlier, I thought that (x + y + z)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = x\u00b3 + y\u00b3 + z\u00b3 + (xy\u00b2 + x\u00b2 y + xz\u00b2 + x\u00b2 z + yz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 z). Let me verify that.\n\nTake x=1, y=2, z=3, for example.\n\nLeft side: (1 + 2 + 3)(1 + 4 + 9) = 6 * 14 = 84\n\nRight side: 1 + 8 + 27 + (1*4 + 1*4 + 1*9 + 1*9 + 2*9 + 2*4) = 36 + (4 + 4 + 9 + 9 + 18 + 8) = 36 + 52 = 88\n\nWhich is not equal to 84. So, that formula must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so my earlier step is incorrect. Therefore, I cannot use that method. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, so that identity is not correct. So, my approach using S1 p2 = p3 + 12 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, going back, I need another way to handle the third equation.\n\nHmm, the third equation is:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nMaybe I can factor this in another way. Let me try to factor terms:\n\nGroup terms:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) = xy S1 \\)\n\n\\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) = xz S1 \\)\n\n\\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) = yz S1 \\)\n\nSo, indeed, it's \\( (xy + xz + yz) S1 = S2 S1 \\), so S1 S2 = 12. So equation (B) is correct.\n\nSo, if the third equation is correct, then equation (B) is correct.\n\nBut now, when using Newton's identities, I have a conflict because I get two different"
