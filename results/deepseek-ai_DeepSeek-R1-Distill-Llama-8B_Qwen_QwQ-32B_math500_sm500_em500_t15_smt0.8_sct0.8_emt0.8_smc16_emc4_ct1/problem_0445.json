            "output": "First, I recognize that the series given is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.\n\nI calculate the total number of terms in the sequence by using the formula for the nth term: 199 = 1 + (n - 1) * 2. Solving for n gives me 100 terms.\n\nNext, I determine the sum of the arithmetic sequence using the formula: sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2. Plugging in the numbers, the sum is (100 * (1 + 199)) / 2, which equals 100 * 200 / 2 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, I find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7. Dividing 10,000 by 7 gives a quotient of 1428 and a remainder of 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Sequence\nThe given series is an **arithmetic sequence** where each term increases by \\(2\\):\n\\[\n1, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 9, \\ \\dots, \\ 199\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Terms\nThe \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nWhere:\n- \\(a_n\\) is the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) term,\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n- \\(d\\) is the common difference,\n- \\(n\\) is the number of terms.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\\[\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\n199 - 1 = (n - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\n198 = (n - 1) \\times 2\n\\]\n\\[\nn - 1 = 99\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are **100 terms** in this sequence.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Sequence\nThe sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\)"
