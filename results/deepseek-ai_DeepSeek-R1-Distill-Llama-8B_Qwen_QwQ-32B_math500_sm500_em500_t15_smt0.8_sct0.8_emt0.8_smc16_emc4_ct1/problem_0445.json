Since the sequence is an arithmetic progression starting at 1 and ending at 199 with a common difference of 2, the number of terms can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of terms = ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1.\n\nPlugging in the values, I get:\n\nNumber of terms = ((199 - 1) / 2) + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100.\n\nNext, I will calculate the sum of the arithmetic sequence using the formula:\n\nSum = (Number of terms / 2) × (First term + Last term).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nSum = (100 / 2) × (1 + 199) = 50 × 200 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, to find the modulo 7 remainder of 10,000, I will divide 10,000 by 7 and find the remainder. Performing the division:\n\n10,000 ÷ 7 = 1,428 with a remainder of 4.\n\nTherefore, the modulo 7 remainder of the sum is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), follow these steps:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Number of Terms**\n\nThe given sequence is an **arithmetic progression (AP)** where:\n- **First term (\\(a\\))** = \\(1\\)\n- **Common difference (\\(d\\))** = \\(2\\) (since the sequence increases by \\(2\\) each time)\n\nTo find the **number of terms (\\(n\\))** in the sequence:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{\\text{Last term} - \\text{First term}}{\\text{Common difference}} + 1\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{199 - 1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{198}{2} + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Sum of the Arithmetic Progression**\n\nThe sum (\\(S\\)) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an"
