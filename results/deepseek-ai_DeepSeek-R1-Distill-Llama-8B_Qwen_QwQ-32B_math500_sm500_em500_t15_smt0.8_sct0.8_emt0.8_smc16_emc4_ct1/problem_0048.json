            "output": "First, I need to determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders.\n\nI'll start by calculating 135% of the number of female bus riders for each grade. This involves multiplying the female percentage by 1.35.\n\nNext, I'll compare this calculated value to the number of male bus riders in each grade. I'll look for the grade where the difference between the male percentage and 135% of the female percentage is the smallest.\n\nFor each grade, I'll compute the absolute difference between the male and 135% female values and identify which grade has the smallest difference.\n\nFinally, I'll conclude that the grade with the smallest difference has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the female bus riders.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to \\(135\\%\\) of the number of female bus riders, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Data:**\n   - Each grade has \\(300\\) males and \\(300\\) females surveyed.\n   - The percentages provided represent the proportion of bus riders from each gender in that grade.\n\n2. **Calculate \\(135\\%\\) of Females:**\n   - For each grade, compute \\(135\\%\\) of the female bus riders.\n   - Use the formula:\n     \\[\n     135\\% \\text{ of Females} = 1.35 \\times \\text{Female Percentage}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Male Bus Riders:**\n   - Since each grade has exactly \\(300\\) males surveyed, the number of male bus riders is \\(300\\) in each grade.\n\n4. **Find the Closest Grade:**\n   - Compare the calculated \\(135\\%\\) of females to the number of males.\n   - The grade where the number of males is closest to \\(135\\%\\) of females is our answer.\n\n5. **Calculate for Each Grade:**\n   - **9th Grade:**\n     \\[\n     135\\% \\text{ of Females} = 1.35 \\times 39.4\\% = 53.0\\%\n     \\]\n     Difference from Males:\n     \\[\n     300 \\text{ (males)} \\text{ vs. } 53.0\\% \\text{ (females)}\n     \\]\n     \n  "
