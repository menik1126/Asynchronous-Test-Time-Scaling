            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about bus riders at Central H.S. It says that a survey was done with 300 males and 300 females in each grade. They want to find out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the table is showing. Each grade has a percentage of males and females who are bus riders. So, for example, in the 9th grade, 41.1% of males are bus riders, and 39.4% of females are. Since there are 300 males and 300 females surveyed in each grade, I can calculate the actual number of bus riders by multiplying these percentages by 300.\n\nWait, but do I need to calculate the actual numbers, or is there a ratio or percentage comparison I can do directly? The question is about the number of male bus riders being closest to 135% of the female ones. That means I need to find, for each grade, how many males are 135% of the females. So, for each grade, I can set up an equation where Males = 1.35 * Females.\n\nBut since the percentages are given, I can adjust those to find out if the given male percentage exceeds or is less than 135% of the female percentage. Alternatively, I could calculate the ratio of male to female bus riders and see which grade is closest to 1.35:1.\n\nLet me think about both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: For each grade, calculate the actual number of bus riders (Male and Female). Then, for each grade, check if Male is approximately 1.35 times Female.\n\nApproach 2: Use the percentages directly. Since 300 males and 300 females, the counts would be (Males % of 300) and (Females % of 300). So, for each grade, Malecount = 0.411*300, Femalecount=0.394*300, etc. Then, compute Malecount / Femalecount and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nHmm, both seem similar. Maybe approach 2 is more straightforward because I can just use the percentages without calculating the exact numbers. Let's go with approach 2.\n\nSo, for each grade, I'll compute (Males %) / (Females"

            "output": " %) and see which is closest to 1.35. Wait, but actually, the question is about the number of males being 135% of the number of females. So, the ratio of males to females should be 1.35. So, if I compute (Male % / Female %), since both are percentages of the same base (300), the ratio of their counts would be (Male% / Female%) because the 300 cancels out. Let me verify that.\n\nSuppose Male% is M and Female% is F. Then, Male count is 3*M, Female count is 3*F (since 300 is 3*100, but actually, 300 is the total, so 300*(M/100) = 3*M. Similarly for females. So, the ratio of Male count to Female count is (3*M)/(3*F) = M/F. So yes, the ratio of the percentages is the same as the ratio of the counts. Therefore, I can just compute M/F for each grade and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nTherefore, I can compute for each grade:\n\nGrade 9: 41.1 / 39.4 \u2248 ?\n\nGrade 10: 34.4 / 33.1 \u2248 ?\n\nGrade 11: 20.6 / 13.8 \u2248 ?\n\nGrade 12: 11.6 / 8.6 \u2248 ?\n\nThen, compare each of these to 1.35 and see which is closest.\n\nLet me compute each one step by step.\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n\n41.1 divided by 39.4. Let me do that division. Let's see, 39.4 goes into 41.1. Since 39.4*1 = 39.4, subtract that from 41.1, you get 1.7. So, 1.7 / 39.4 is approximately 0.043. So total is 1.043. So approximately 1.043. So that's about 1.04, which is 104% of the female riders. But we need 135%, so"

So, 1.3 / 33.1 is approximately 0.039. So total is about 1.039, or 103.9%. Again, that's lower than 135%.\n\n11th grade:\n\n20.6 divided by 13.8. Let me see. 13.8 times 1 is 13.8. Subtract from 20.6, you have 6.8 left. 6.8 divided by 13.8 is approximately 0.492. So total is 1.492. Hmm, 1.492 is approximately 1.49, which is 149%. So that's closer to 135%, but not quite there yet.\n\n12th grade:\n\n11.6 divided by 8.6. Let me compute that. 8.6 times 1 is 8.6, subtract from 11.6, that's 3.0 left. 3.0 / 8.6 is approximately 0.348. So total is 1.348, which is about 134.8%. Oh, that's really close to 135%.\n\nSo, grade 12 gives us approximately 134.8%, which is almost 135%. So that's very close.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for each grade to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nGrade 9: 41.1 / 39.4.\n\n39.4 * 1 = 39.4\n\n41.1 - 39.4 = 1.7\n\n1.7 / 39.4 \u2248 0.0432\n\nSo total is \u2248 1.0432, which is about 104.32%.\n\nGrade 10: 34.4 / 33.1.\n\n33.1 *1 =33.1\n\n34.4 -33.1=1.3\n\n1.3/33.1\u22480.0392\n\nTotal\u22481.0392, so 103.92%.\n\nGrade 11:20.6 /13.8\n\n13.8 *1=13.8\n\n20.6"

So that's our answer.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe the question is about the number of male bus riders being closest to 135% of female riders. So, perhaps I should check if any other grade is closer than 12th.\n\nLet's see, 9th grade is ~104%, which is 31% away from 135%.\n\n10th grade ~103.9%, which is again 31.1% away.\n\n11th grade is ~149%, which is 14% over.\n\n12th grade is ~134.88%, which is only 0.12% less than 135%. So that's really close.\n\nSo, 12th grade is the closest.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question is about the number of male bus riders being closest to 135% of the female. So, another way is to compute for each grade: (Males) / (Females) = 135%.\n\nSince (Males) = 135% of (Females), which is 1.35 times.\n\nSo, we can compute (Males)/(Females) for each grade:\n\nFor 9th grade, 41.1 / 39.4 = 1.043.\n\nSo, 1.043 is the ratio, so 4.3% over.\n\nFor 10th grade, 34.4 / 33.1 \u2248 1.039, so about 3.9% over.\n\nWait, but actually, 1.043 is 104.3%, which is less than 135%.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, 1.043 is 104.3%, meaning males are 104.3% of females, which is way below 135%.\n\nSimilarly, 1.039 is 103.9%, which"

But the male percentage is 11.6, which is just slightly less than 11.61. So, 11.6 is 0.01 less than 11.61, so the ratio is (11.6)/(8.6) = (11.61 -0.01)/8.6 = 1.35 - (0.01/8.6) \u2248 1.35 -0.00116 \u2248 1.3488, which matches the previous calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the 12th grade's ratio is 1.3488, which is 134.88%, so just 0.12% less than 135%.\n\nThe next closest is 11th grade, which is 149.23%, which is 14.23% over. So, the difference between 149.23 and 135 is 14.23, which is way bigger than 0.12%.\n\nTherefore, 12th grade is the closest.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to compute this.

So, let me compute the actual numbers for each grade.\n\nSince each grade has 300 males and 300 females, but only a certain percentage take the bus.\n\nFor 9th grade:\n\nMales bus riders: 41.1% of 300 = 0.411*300 = 123.3\n\nFemales bus riders: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394*300=118.2\n\nSo, 123.3 / 118.2 \u2248 1.043 (same as before)\n\nFor 10th grade:\n\nMales:34.4% of 300= 0.344*300=103.2\n\nFemales:33.1% of 300=99.3\n\n103.2/99.3\u22481.039.\n\n11th grade:\n\nMales:20.6% of 300=6.18\n\nFemales:13.8% of 300=4.14\n\n6.18/4.14=1.496 approx.\n\nWait, earlier I got 1.492, but that's because I might have miscalculated.
