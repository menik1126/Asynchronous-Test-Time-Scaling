            "output": "To determine the volume of the original cube, I need to understand the relationship between the cube's side length and the sphere that's formed by cutting its corners.\n\nFirst, a sphere with a 3-inch radius has a diameter of 6 inches. If the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, the sphere's diameter will be equal to the cube's side length. This implies that the cube has a side length of 6 inches.\n\nOnce I have the side length of the cube, calculating its volume is straightforward. The volume \\( V \\) of a cube is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV = \\text{side}^3\n\\]\nSubstituting the side length:\n\\[\nV = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and the Cube:**\n   - **Sphere Dimensions:** The sphere has a 3-inch radius. \n     - **Diameter of the Sphere:** \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) inches.\n\n2. **Determine the Cube's Side Length:**\n   - When a sphere is inscribed inside a cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube.\n   - Therefore, the side length of the cube is **6 inches**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**\n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a cube with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     V = s^3\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( s = 6 \\) inches:\n     \\[\n     V = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{216}\n\\]"
