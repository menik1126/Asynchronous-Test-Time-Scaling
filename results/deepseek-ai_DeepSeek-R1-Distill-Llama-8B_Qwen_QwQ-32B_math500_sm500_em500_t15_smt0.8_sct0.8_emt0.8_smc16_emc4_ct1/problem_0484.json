            "output": "First, I need to determine the side length of the cube before any metal is removed. The sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is twice that, which is 6 inches.\n\nSince the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the cube has a side length of 6 inches.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the cube using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is side length cubed. So, the volume is 6 inches multiplied by 6 inches multiplied by 6 inches, resulting in 216 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, I'll consider whether the removal of metal from the corners affects the volume of the cube. However, since the problem focuses on the original cube before any metal is removed, the volume remains 216 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Sphere's Diameter:**\n   \n   The steel sphere has a radius of 3 inches. Therefore, the diameter \\( D \\) of the sphere is:\n   \\[\n   D = 2 \\times \\text{radius} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Relate the Sphere's Diameter to the Cube's Side Length:**\n   \n   When a sphere is inscribed inside a cube (i.e., it touches all the cube's faces exactly at the centers of each face), the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's side length \\( S \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   S = D = 6 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Cube's Volume:**\n   \n   The volume \\( V \\) of a cube is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = S^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging in the side length:\n   \\[\n   V = 6^3 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consider the Effect of Removing Metal:**\n   \n   While the problem mentions that the steel sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of the cube, this does **not** affect the volume of the original cube before the metal was removed. The sphere's volume is entirely contained within the cube, and the removed corners are part of the final product"
