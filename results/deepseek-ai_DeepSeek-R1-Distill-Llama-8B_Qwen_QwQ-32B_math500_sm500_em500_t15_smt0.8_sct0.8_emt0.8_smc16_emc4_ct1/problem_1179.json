Maybe this equation can be factored somehow. Let me try to see if I can write it in a form that might be easier to handle.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \\). Hmm, the coefficients involve \\( i \\) and real numbers, so perhaps this is a biquadratic equation or has some symmetry.\n\nI notice that the coefficients are: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. The pattern seems to be that every other coefficient is a real number, and the others are multiples of \\( i \\). So maybe there's a substitution I can make to simplify it.\n\nI recall that sometimes substituting \\( w = z + c \\) can transform the equation into something more manageable. Alternatively, maybe I can factor this polynomial.\n\nLet me assume that the quartic can be factored into two quadratics. Let's suppose:\n\n\\( (z^2 + a z + b)(z^2 + c z + d) = 0 \\)\n\nMultiplying this out, we get:\n\n\\( z^4 + (a + c) z^3 + (ac + b + d) z^2 + (ad + bc) z + b d = 0 \\)\n\nNow, comparing coefficients with the original equation:\n\n1.
