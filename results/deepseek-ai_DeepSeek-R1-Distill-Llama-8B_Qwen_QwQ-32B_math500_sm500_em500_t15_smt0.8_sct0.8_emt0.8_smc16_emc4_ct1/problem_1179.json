The equation is a quartic, which means it has four roots. These roots are the vertices of a convex polygon. Since it's a convex polygon with four sides, it's a quadrilateral. So, I need to find the four roots of the equation and then calculate the area of the quadrilateral they form in the complex plane.\n\nBut how do I find the roots of this quartic equation? Maybe I can factor it somehow. Let me see if it's factorable.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 -4zi - i = 0 \\). Hmm, it kind of resembles the expansion of a binomial like \\( (z + a i)^4 \\). Let me check that.\n\nWait, if I set \\( (z + i)^4 \\), let's expand it:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 \\).\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi + 1 \\).\n\nWait, but our original equation is \\( z^4 +4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i =0 \\).

The chord length is 2r sin(\u03b8/2), where \u03b8 is the angle between them.\n\nSo, the chord length is 2 * 2^{1/8} * sin(\u03c0/4).

The area of a square with diagonal d is (d^2)/2, so ( (2^{9/8})^2 ) / 2 = (2^{9/4}) / 2 = 2^{9/4 - 1} = 2^{5/4}, which matches the previous result.
