Then, after factoring it, I have to plug in \\( x = 1 \\) into each of these polynomials and add up the results. \n\nFirst, I should try to factor the given polynomial. The polynomial is \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. It's an eighth-degree polynomial, so it might be challenging, but perhaps there's a way to factor it into lower-degree polynomials.\n\nLet me look at the structure: it's \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). That seems similar to a quadratic in terms of \\( x^4 \\). Let me consider substituting \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). That's a quadratic equation. Maybe I can factor this quadratic.\n\nSo, let's try to factor \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). Looking for two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1? Yes, 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). Substituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), that gives \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nAlright, so now our original polynomial is factored into \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). But can we factor these further? Let's see.\n\nLooking at \\( x^4 - 1 \\) first. That's a difference of squares because \\( x^4 = (x^2)^2 \\) and 1 is \\( 1^2 \\). So, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Each of those can be factored further: \\( x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + "

Wait, 4 is \\( (2)^2 \\), so maybe I can factor this using sum of squares formula. But the sum of squares doesn't factor nicely over integers unless you use complex numbers, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, maybe it can be factored as a product of two quadratics.\n\nLet me try to factor \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Let's suppose it factors as \\( (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d) \\), where a, b, c, d are integers. Multiplying them out, we get:\n\n\\( (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d) = x^4 + (a + c) x^3 + (ac + b + d) x^2 + (ad + bc) x + b d \\).\n\nWe need this to equal \\( x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4 \\). So, setting up the equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\): \\( a + c = 0 \\)\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( a c + b + d = 0 \\)\n3. Coefficient of \\( x \\): \\( a d + b c = 0 \\)\n4. Constant term: \\( b d = 4 \\)\n\nFrom equation 1, \\( c = -a \\). Let's substitute that into the rest.\n\nEquation 2 becomes: \\( a (-a) + b + d = -a^2 + b + d = 0 \\)\nEquation 3: \\( a d + b (-a) = a d - a b = a (d - b) = 0 \\)\nEquation 4: \\( b d = 4 \\)\n\nSo, from equation 3, either a = 0 or \\( d = b \\).\n\nIf a = 0, then c = 0 from equation 1"

So a can't be zero.\n\nTherefore, \\( d = b \\). Then equation 4: \\( b d = b^2 = 4 \\), so \\( b = \\pm 2 \\). Let's test both cases.\n\nCase 1: \\( b = 2 \\), so \\( d = 2 \\).\nFrom equation 2: \\( -a^2 + 2 + 2 = -a^2 + 4 = 0 \\), so \\( a^2 = 4 \\), which gives \\( a = \\pm 2 \\).\nThen from equation 1: \\( c = -a \\). So c is either -2 or 2.\n\nCase 2: \\( b = -2 \\), so \\( d = -2 \\).\nFrom equation 2: \\( -a^2 + (-2) + (-2) = -a^2 -4 = 0 \\), which would require \\( a^2 = -4 \\), which is impossible since a is an integer. So only Case 1 is possible.\n\nSo, \\( a = \\pm 2 \\), \\( b = d = 2 \\), \\( c = \\mp 2 \\).\n\nThus, the factorization is:\n\nIf a = 2, then c = -2:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\)\n\nIf a = -2, then c = 2:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 2x + 2)(x^2 + 2x + 2) \\), which is the same as above.\n\nSo, \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nGreat! So now, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 +"
