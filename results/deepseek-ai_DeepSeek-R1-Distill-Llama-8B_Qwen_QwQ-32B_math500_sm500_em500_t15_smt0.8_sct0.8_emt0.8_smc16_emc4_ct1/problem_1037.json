Then, I have to compute the sum of \\(p_i(1)\\) for all these factors. \n\nFirst, let me write down the polynomial again to make sure I have it right: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). Hmm, it looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \\(x^4\\). Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me try substituting \\(y = x^4\\). Then the equation becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\\). \n\nNow, I can solve this quadratic equation for \\(y\\). Using the quadratic formula: \\(y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2}\\). So, the solutions are \\(y = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\\) and \\(y = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4\\). \n\nSo, substituting back, \\(x^4 = 1\\) or \\(x^4 = -4\\). Let me consider these equations separately. \n\nStarting with \\(x^4 = 1\\). The real solutions are \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -1\\), but since we're dealing with polynomials over integers, the complex roots can be factored into quadratics. Remember, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\), and then \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\). So, that gives me four linear factors, but since we need monic polynomials with integer coefficients, I can write \\(x^4 - 1\\) as \\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). \n\nBut wait, in our original substitution, we have \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). Let me see how \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) relates"

As I know, this factors into \\((x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4)\\), because \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\) and \\(1 + 4 = 5\\), so it's a difference of squares. Let me check: \\((x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4) = x^8 + 4x^4 - x^4 - 4 = x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, now I have \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4)\\). Now, I need to factor each of these quartic polynomials further into polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\), as I thought before, this factors into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). That's as far as it can go over the integers because \\(x^2 + 1\\) doesn't factor further.\n\nNow, onto \\(x^4 + 4\\). Hmm, this one is a bit trickier. I remember that \\(x^4 + 4\\) can be factored as a product of two quadratics. The standard factorization is \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Let me verify this:\n\nMultiply \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\):\nFirst, \\(x^2 \\times x^2 = x^4\\).\nThen, \\(x^2 \\times (-2x) = -2x^3\\).\nNext, \\(x^2 \\times 2 = 2x^2\\).\nThen, \\(2x \\times x^2 = 2x^3\\).\n\\(2x"

So, yes, \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Both of these quadratics have discriminant \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), which is negative, so they can't be factored further over integers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4\\) factors as:\n\n\\((x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1)(x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)\\).\n\nNow, we need to compute the sum \\(p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1)\\), where each \\(p_i(x)\\) is one of these factors.\n\nSo, let's compute each factor evaluated at \\(x=1\\):\n\n1. \\(p_1(x) = (x -1)\\).

So total sum is 10.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, is there any possibility that I missed any factors or made a mistake in factoring?\n\nLet me step back. The original equation was \\(x^8 +3x^4 -4\\). We noticed it's a quadratic in \\(x^4\\), so factored into \\((x^4 -1)(x^4 +4)\\). Then factored each part. \n\n\\(x^4 -1\\) is straightforward, giving linear and quadratic factors. \\(x^4 +4\\) factors into two quadratics as I did above, which are irreducible.\n\nSo, all five factors are accounted for, and none can be factored further. Therefore, each \\(p_i(1)\\) is correct, so the total sum is 10.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be 10.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4\\) factors into \\((x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1)(x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)\\). Evaluating each factor at \\("
