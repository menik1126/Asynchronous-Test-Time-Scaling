I need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}.\\]\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1 means \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. I remember there are three cube roots of unity: 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1 and \u03c9\u00b2 \u2260 1. Also, I think these roots satisfy certain properties, like 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. I should verify that.\n\nIf \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, then we can write \u03c9\u00b3 - 1 = 0, which factors as (\u03c9 - 1)(\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1) = 0. Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it must be that \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0. Oh, right, so 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. That will probably be useful.\n\nNow, the expression I need to compute is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Since \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2 are roots, maybe I can express everything in terms of \u03c9 and use the equation 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0 to simplify.\n\nLet me denote S = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). I can try to compute S by first finding each fraction separately.\n\nBut maybe it's better to combine them into a single fraction. To add the two fractions, I need a common denominator:\n\nThe common denominator is (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). So, let me write S as:\n\nS = [ (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) ] / [ (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) ].\n\nSimplifying the numerator: 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 + \u03c9 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nBut from earlier, 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo S = 1 / [ (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) ].\n\nNow I need to compute the denominator"

But we know 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so this adds up to 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the denominator is 1.\n\nTherefore, S = 1 / 1 = 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"find all possible values.\" So is S always equal to 1 regardless of which cube root \u03c9 we take (other than 1)?\n\nLet me check with each root.\n\nCase 1: \u03c9 = 1.\n\nIf \u03c9 = 1, then the expression becomes 1/(1+1) + 1/(1+1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that's 1.\n\nCase 2: \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) = -1/2 + i(\u221a3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + \u03c9: 1 + (-1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + (-1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + \u03c9) = 1 / (1/2 + i\u221a3/2). To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by 2 - i\u221a3:\n\n(2 - i\u221a3)/( (1/2)^2 + (\u221a3/2)^2 ) = (2 - i\u221a3)/(1/4 + 3/4) = (2 - i\u221a3)/1 = 2 - i\u221a3.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1/(1/2 - i\u221a3/2).

Hmm, so that suggests that the possible values are 1 and 4.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier computation where S was equal to 1.\n\nWait, let me check my earlier computation step because clearly something went wrong.\n\nWait, when I expanded (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2), I thought it becomes 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9^3, which is 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2, but wait, isn't 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, so it's 1 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + (-1) = 0. Wait, no, wait: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3, but since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, that's 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 = (1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo denominator is 1, so S = 1/1 =1.\n\nWait, then when I took \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3), I computed S = 4.

Its reciprocal would be 2 - i\u221a3, as I did before.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 is 1/2 - i\u221a3/2; reciprocal is 2 + i\u221a3.\n\nAdding them: (2 - i\u221a3) + (2 + i\u221a3) = 4. So S =4 in that case.\n\nBut when I plugged \u03c9=1, S=1, and when \u03c9 is the primitive root, S=4.\n\nSo that"

So that's my mistake earlier: I must have miscalculated 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nWait, because if \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3), then 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + e^(4\u03c0i/3) = 1 + (-1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) is the reciprocal of (1/2 - i\u221a3/2), which is (1/2 + i\u221a3/2)/[(1/2)^2 + (\u221a3/2)^2] = (1/2 + i\u221a3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nWait, so I think earlier when I computed 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2), I messed up the sign. Let me correct that.\n\nIf \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3), then 1 + \u03c9 = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2, so 1/(1 + \u03c9) is 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSimilarly, \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3), so 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2, and its reciprocal is 1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo adding them: (1/2 - i\u221a3/2) + (1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i\u221a3/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1 + 0 =1.\n\nAh! So S=1. Therefore, my initial algebra was correct, and my earlier miscalculation when I thought I was getting"
