I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Hmm, alright. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, ω is a cube root of unity. That means ω³ = 1, right? So, ω is one of the three roots of the equation x³ = 1. I remember there are three cube roots of unity: 1, and the two complex roots. Since one of them is 1, the other two must be complex numbers. Let me recall what those are. I think they are usually denoted as ω and ω², where ω ≠ 1, and ω² is the complex conjugate of ω. So, ω satisfies ω² + ω + 1 = 0. Wait, is that right? Let me check.\n\nYes, the minimal polynomial for the primitive cube roots of unity is x² + x + 1 = 0. So, ω and ω² satisfy this equation, meaning ω² = -ω - 1, and similarly, ω = -ω² - 1. That might come in handy later.\n\nSo, the expression I need to evaluate is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Let's denote this expression as S. So, S = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nHmm, maybe I can find a way to simplify this expression by combining the fractions. Let me try that. To add these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). That seems fine.\n\nSo, let me write S as:\n\nS = \\(\\frac{1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega^2) + 1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)}\\)\n\nSimplifying the numerator: 1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω) = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 +"

Because ω is a cube root of unity. So, ω³ = 1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator simplifies to 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, both numerator and denominator are 2 + ω + ω². That means S = \\(\\frac{2 + ω + ω²}{2 + ω + ω²}\\) = 1.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Did I do that correctly?\n\nLet me go through it again.\n\nCompute numerator: 1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω) = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω². That's correct.\n\nDenominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. But since ω³ = 1, substitute: 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω². So, yes, same as numerator. So, S = 1.\n\nWait, so is it always 1?\n\nBut ω can be either of the two non-real roots or 1 itself. Let me check what happens when ω = 1.\n\nIf ω = 1, then S becomes 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, same result.\n\nHmm, so does that mean no matter which cube root of unity ω is (including 1), S is always 1?\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive because sometimes expressions can have different values depending on which root you take. Let me double-check with specific ω.\n\nTake ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2. Then ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nCompute S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/("

When ω is 1, we already saw S is 1. So, seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe when ω = 1, the expression might be different, but no, it still gives 1.\n\nSo, is the only possible value 1? So, the answer is 1.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming ω and ω² both lead to S = 1. Is it possible that the expression is always 1 regardless of which cube root ω is?\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about this expression in another way. Since ω³ = 1, perhaps I can use substitution"
