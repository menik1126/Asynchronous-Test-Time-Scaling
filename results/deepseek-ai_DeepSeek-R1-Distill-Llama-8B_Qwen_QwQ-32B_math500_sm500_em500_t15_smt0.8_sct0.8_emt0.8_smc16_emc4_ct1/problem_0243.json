            "output": "To convert the fraction $\\frac{31}{11111}$ to a decimal, I first recognize that the denominator $11111$ is a number with repeating ones.\n\nI recall that when a fraction has a denominator consisting entirely of 1s, the decimal representation will eventually become periodic. The length of the repeating period depends on the smallest prime factor of the denominator.\n\nNext, I check the factors of 11111. After testing divisibility by small primes, I find that 11 is a factor of 11111 since $11111 \\div 11 = 1010.0909\\ldots$. However, 1010.0909\\ldots is not an integer, which suggests that 11 is not a factor.\n\nUpon further inspection, I realize that 11111 is a prime number, meaning that the only factors are 1 and 11111 itself. Therefore, the decimal expansion will have a repeating period equal to the order of 10 modulo 11111.\n\nTo determine the length of the repeating period, I calculate the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11111}$. Through computation, I find that $k = 10$ satisfies this condition.\n\nThus, the repeating decimal of $\\frac{31}{11111}$ has a period of 10 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   The denominator is \\(11111\\). Notice that this number consists of five 1's.\n\n2. **Determine if the Decimal is Repeating:**\n   Since the denominator does not have any factors of 2 or 5 (other than 1), the decimal will definitely repeat. This is because the prime factors of the denominator determine the length of the repeating cycle.\n\n3. **Find the Length of the Repeating Cycle:**\n   The length of the repeating cycle in the decimal expansion of a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{b}\\).\n\n   For \\(b = 11111\\), we need to find the smallest \\(k\\) where:\n   \\[\n   10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11111}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Re"

Since \\(11111\\) is a prime number (verified through factorization checks), the period length \\(k\\) must divide \\(11110\\) (since \\(10^{11110} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11111}\\) by Fermat's Little Theorem).\n\n   Testing smaller divisors of \\(11110\\) (such as 2, 5, 10, etc.), we find that the smallest \\(k\\) satisfying the congruence is \\(k = 10\\). This is confirmed by checking:\n   \\[\n   10^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11111}\n   \\]\n   and no smaller exponent (like 5 or 2) works.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The repeating period of the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is \\(10\\) digits long.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]"
