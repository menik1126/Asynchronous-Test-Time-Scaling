            "output": "To determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of 31/11111, I'll start by simplifying the fraction.\n\nFirst, I can see that both the numerator and the denominator are prime numbers. Since 31 is a prime number and doesn't divide evenly into 11111, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nNext, I know that the length of the repeating period of a decimal expansion of a fraction 1/p (where p is a prime number) is equal to the order of 10 modulo p. This means I need to find the smallest positive integer k such that 10^k \u2261 1 mod p.\n\nGiven p = 11,111, I'll calculate 10^k mod 11,111 for successive values of k until I find when the remainder equals 1. Through this process, I discover that k = 5 satisfies this condition because 10^5 \u2261 10^5 mod 11,111 equals 1.\n\nTherefore, the length of the repeating period is 5 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction:**\n   The fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is already in its simplest form since both 31 and 11111 are prime numbers.\n\n2. **Find the Decimal Expansion:**\n   Dividing 31 by 11111 gives a repeating decimal. For instance, using long division:\n   \\[\n   31 \\div 11111 = 0.00280002800028\\ldots\n   \\]\n   Here, the repeating part is \"0028.\"\n\n3. **Determine the Repeating Sequence:**\n   The repeating sequence \"0028\" consists of 4 digits. After the decimal point, the \"0028\" pattern repeats indefinitely.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The repeating decimal has **4** digits that repeat.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
