The standard form for a parabola that opens horizontally is \\( x = a(y - k)^2 + h \\).\n\nGiven the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), I notice that it doesn't have a vertex term, which means the vertex is at \\( (h, k) = (0, 0) \\). This simplifies the equation to \\( x = y^2 - 4y \\).\n\nNext, I'll complete the square for the quadratic in terms of \\( y \\). Starting with \\( y^2 - 4y \\), I add and subtract \\( (4/2)^2 = 4 \\) to complete the square, resulting in \\( x = (y^2 - 4y + 4) - 4 \\). This simplifies to \\( x = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \\).\n\nThe completed square form is now \\( x = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \\), which clearly shows that the vertex is at \\( (-4, 2) \\) and the parabola opens to the right.\n\nSince the parabola opens to the right, it will extend towards the right side of the coordinate plane. Therefore, it will only have one \\( y \\)-intercept.\n\nFinally, to find the \\( y \\)-intercept, I set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\). This gives the equation \\( 0 = (y - 2)^2 - 4 \\), which simplifies to \\( (y - 2)^2 = 4 \\). Taking the square root of both sides, I find two solutions for \\( y \\): \\( y = 2 + 2 = 4 \\) and \\( y = 2 - 2 = 0 \\).\n\nThus, the graph of the parabola has two \\( y \\)-intercepts at \\( (0, 4) \\) and \\( (0, 0) \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the given equation step by step to determine the number of $y$-intercepts for the graph of the parabola.\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[ x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\]\n\n**Step 1: Rewrite the Equation in Standard Form**\nThe standard form of a"
