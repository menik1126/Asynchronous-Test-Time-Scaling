            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many y-intercepts does the graph of the parabola x = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1 have?\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember that intercepts are points where the graph crosses the axes. Specifically, a y-intercept is where the graph crosses the y-axis, which happens when x is zero. So, to find the y-intercepts, I need to find all the values of y when x is zero. \n\nAlright, so if I set x equal to zero, the equation becomes 0 = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1. This is a quadratic equation in terms of y. I can solve this equation using the quadratic formula or by factoring, if possible. Let me first check if it can be factored. \n\nLooking at the quadratic equation y\u00b2 - 4y - 1, I need two numbers that multiply to -1 and add to -4. Hmm, wait, this might not factor nicely because the product is negative and the sum is negative. Let me think: possible factors of -1 are 1 and -1. But 1 and -1 add up to 0, not -4. So, probably it doesn't factor nicely, which means I should use the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula is y = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a is 1 (the coefficient of y\u00b2), b is -4 (the coefficient of y), and c is -1 (the constant term). Plugging these into the formula: \n\ny = [ -(-4) \u00b1 \u221a((-4)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-1)) ] / (2*1)\ny = [4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 4)] / 2\ny = [4 \u00b1 \u221a20] / 2\n\nWait, \u221a20 can be simplified. Since 20 is 4*5, \u221a20 is 2\u221a5. So, the equation becomes:\n\ny = [4 \u00b1 2\u221a5] / 2\n\nI can factor out a 2 in the numerator:\n\ny = 2[2 \u00b1 \u221a5] / 2\n\nCanceling the 2 in the numerator and denominator:\n\ny = 2 \u00b1 \u221a5\n\nSo, that gives me two solutions: y = 2 + \u221a5 and y"

            "output": " = 2 - \u221a5. Since both values are real numbers, that means there are two y-intercepts. \n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I did everything right. The equation is x = y\u00b2 -4y -1. When x is zero, we set y\u00b2 -4y -1 = 0. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac = (-4)\u00b2 -4*1*(-1) = 16 +4 = 20, which is positive. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions, meaning two y-intercepts. \n\nSo, yeah, the graph should cross the y-axis at two points. Therefore, the number of y-intercepts is two.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is x = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1. To find the y-intercepts, set x = 0 and solve for y:\n\n0 = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 4)] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 \u221a20] / 2 = 2 \u00b1 \u221a5\n\nThere are two real solutions, so there are two y-intercepts.\n\nThe number of y-intercepts is \\boxed{2}."
