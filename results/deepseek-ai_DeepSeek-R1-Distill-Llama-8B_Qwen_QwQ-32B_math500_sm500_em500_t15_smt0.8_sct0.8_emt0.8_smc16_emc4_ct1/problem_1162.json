Applying this rule, the equation becomes \\( 3^{6k} = 3^6 \\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. This gives me the equation \\( 6k = 6 \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 6, resulting in \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( k \\) is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\((3^k)^6 = 3^6\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Rule**:\n   \n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the Exponents Equal to Each Other**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same (\\(3\\)), you can set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\(k\\)**:\n   \n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   \\[\n   k = \\boxed{1}\n   \\]"
