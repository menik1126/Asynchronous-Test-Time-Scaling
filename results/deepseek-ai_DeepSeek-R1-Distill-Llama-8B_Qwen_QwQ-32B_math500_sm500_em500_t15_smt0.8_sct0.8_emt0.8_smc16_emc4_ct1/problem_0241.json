            "output": "First, I need to convert the fraction 31/11111 into its decimal form. To do this, I'll perform the division of 31 by 11111.\n\nI start by dividing 31 by 11111. Since 31 is less than 11111, the decimal begins with 0.\n\nNext, I'll add a decimal point and bring down a zero, making it 310.\n\nNow, I divide 310 by 11111, which still doesn't reach the divisor. I'll add another zero, making it 3100.\n\nDividing 3100 by 11111, it's still less than the divisor. Adding another zero gives me 31000.\n\nDividing 31000 by 11111, I subtract 2 times 11111 (which is 22222) from 31000, resulting in 87878. I'll add another zero, making it 878780.\n\nI continue this process, adding zeros sequentially and performing the division each time. This pattern reveals that the decimal doesn't terminate, indicating it's a repeating decimal.\n\nLooking at the sequence of remainders, I notice a repeating pattern after a certain number of digits. By observing this, I can determine the length of the repeating cycle.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the repeating part of the decimal is found to be three digits long.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the repeating decimal of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   When converting a fraction to a decimal, some fractions result in repeating decimals. The goal is to find the length of the repeating sequence.\n\n2. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111} = 0.\\overline{002800282828\\ldots}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Identify the Repeating Part:**\n   - The decimal expansion \\(0.\\overline{002800282828\\ldots}\\) shows that the sequence \"00280\" repeats.\n   - Before the repeating part, there are two non-repeating digits (\"00\").\n   - The repeating sequence itself is \"280\", which has a length of 3 digits.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The repeating part of the decimal has **3** digits.\n\n\\(\\boxed{3}\\)"
