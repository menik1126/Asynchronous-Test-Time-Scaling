            "output": "\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify again. The user's example shows that if it's like \\(0.\\overline{123}\\), the answer is 3. So the length of the repeating block is the key. \n\nWait, but in my initial reasoning, I thought the repeating part was \"000002777778\", but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the period of 1/11111 is known. Since 11111 is a repunit number (all ones). The length of the repeating period (periodicity) of 1/p where p is a prime is related to the order of 10 modulo p. But 11111 is not prime. Let me check if 11111 is prime.\n\nWait, 11111 divided by small primes: 11111 ÷ 3? 1+1+1+1+1=5, not divisible by 3. 11111 ÷ 7? 7*1587=11109, remainder 2. Not divisible by 7. 11? 11*1010 = 11110, remainder 1. Not divisible by 11. 13? Let's see 13*854 = 11102, remainder 9. Not divisible. 37? 37*300 = 11100, 37*300 + 37*0.27027? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 41? 41*271 = 11111? Let me check 41*271: 40*271 = 10840, plus 1*271 = 10840 + 271 = 11111. Yes! So 11111 = 41 × 271. \n\nTherefore, the denominator factors into 41 and 271. Since both are primes? Let me check 41 is prime, yes. 271 is also a prime (since it's not divisible by"
