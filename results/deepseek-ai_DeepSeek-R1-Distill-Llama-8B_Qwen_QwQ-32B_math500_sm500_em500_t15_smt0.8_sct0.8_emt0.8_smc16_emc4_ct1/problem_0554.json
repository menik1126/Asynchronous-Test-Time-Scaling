            "output": "To determine the average price of Juan's 70s stamps, I first need to identify how many stamps he owns from each country during that decade.\n\nLooking at the chart, in the 70s row, there are four stamps: two Brazil, one France, and one Spain. However, Peru does not have any stamps listed for the 70s.\n\nNext, I calculate the total price by multiplying the quantity of each stamp by its respective price and then summing these amounts. For Brazil, 2 stamps at 6 cents each give 12 cents. France has 1 stamp at 6 cents, adding 6 cents. Spain also has 1 stamp at 5 cents, contributing 5 cents. Peru, as there are no 70s stamps, doesn't add anything.\n\nThe total price for the 70s stamps is 12 + 6 + 5, which equals 23 cents. There are 4 stamps in total.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per stamp, I divide the total price by the number of stamps: 23 cents divided by 4 stamps equals 5.75 cents per stamp.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Stamps for Each Country in the 70s:**\n   - **Brazil:** 2 stamps\n   - **France:** 1 stamp\n   - **Peru:** 0 stamps\n   - **Spain:** 1 stamp\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Price for Each Country:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) cents\n   - **France:** \\( 1 \\times 6 = 6 \\) cents\n   - **Peru:** \\( 0 \\times 4 = 0 \\) cents\n   - **Spain:** \\( 1 \\times 5 = 5 \\) cents\n\n3. **Sum the Total Prices:**\n   \\[\n   12 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 23 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Average Price per Stamp:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Price} = \\frac{\\text{Total Price}}{\\text{Number of Stamps}} = \\frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round to the Nearest"

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
