So, 56 Drinkets multiplied by 3 Blinkets per Drinket gives me 168 Blinkets.\n\nNext, since 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, I'll divide the total number of Blinkets by 4 to find the equivalent in Trinkets. Dividing 168 Blinkets by 4 Trinkets per Blinket results in 42 Trinkets.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are equal to 42 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conversion Rates:**\n   - **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**\n   - **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**\n\n2. **Convert Drinkets to Blinkets:**\n   - Since **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**, we can find out how many Blinkets correspond to 1 Drinket.\n   - **1 Drinket = 3/7 Blinkets**\n\n3. **Calculate Blinkets for 56 Drinkets:**\n   - Multiply the number of Drinkets by the Blinkets per Drinket:\n   - **56 Drinkets × (3/7) Blinkets/Drinket = 24 Blinkets**\n\n4. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:**\n   - Since **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**, divide the total Blinkets by 4 to find the equivalent in Trinkets:\n   - **24 Blinkets ÷ 4 Trinkets/Blinket = 6 Trinkets**\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - **56 Drinkets = 6 Trinkets**\n\n\\boxed{6}"
