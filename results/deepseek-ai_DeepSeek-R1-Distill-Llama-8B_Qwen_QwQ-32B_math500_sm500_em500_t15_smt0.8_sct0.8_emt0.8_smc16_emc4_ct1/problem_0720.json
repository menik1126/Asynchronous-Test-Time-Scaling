So, using the property \\(\\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (a \\cdot c)\\), I can rewrite the left side as:\n\n\\(\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\\).\n\nSimplifying inside the logarithm, \\((x - y)(x + y)\\) is a difference of squares, so it becomes \\(x^2 - y^2\\). So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\\).\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Since \\(\\log_b a = c\\) is equivalent to \\(b^c = a\\), applying that here gives:\n\n\\(6^2 = x^2 - y^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(6^2\\) is straightforward, that's 36. So, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\(36 = x^2 - y^2\\)  \nor  \n\\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\).  \nI'll keep this as equation (1).\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\).\n\nAgain, using the definition of a logarithm, \\(\\log_b a = c\\) means \\(b^c = a\\). So, in this case, it would be:\n\n\\(y^2 = 5x\\).  \nI'll call this equation (2).\n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1. \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\)\n2. \\(y^2 = 5x\\)\n\nSince equation (2) gives me \\(y^2"

Let me write it clearly:\n\n\\(x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\\)\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\(x\\). Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square. Let me check if this quadratic factors nicely.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Let's list the factors of 36:\n\n1 and 36, 2 and 18, 3 and 12, 4 and 9, 6 and 6.\n\nLooking for a pair that subtracts to 5 when one is positive and the other is negative. Let's see:\n\n9 and 4: 9 - 4 = 5. If I take 9 and -4, their product is -36 and their sum is 5. But wait, the middle term is -5x, so actually, both numbers should add to -5. So, if both numbers are negative, their sum would be negative. Let me try -9 and 4: No, 4 -9 = -5, but their product is -36.\n\nWait, actually, let's consider it differently. The equation is \\(x^2 -5x -36 = 0\\). So, the two numbers that multiply to -36 and add to -5. Let me think:\n\nIf I have 6 and -6: 6 * (-6) = -36, and 6 + (-6) = 0, which is not -5.\n\nHow about 9 and -4: 9 * (-4) = -36, and 9 + (-4) = 5. Hmm, but the middle term is -5x, so perhaps I need -9 and 4: (-9) * 4 = -36, and (-9) + 4 = -5. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the factors would be:\n\n\\((x - 9"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are \\(x = 9\\) or \\(x = -4\\).\n\nBut since we are dealing with logarithms in the original equations, we need to check if these solutions are valid in the original logarithmic equations. Because the arguments of logarithms must be positive, and the base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\(x = 9\\):\n\nWe need to check the original equations:\n\nFirst equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\). The arguments \\(x - y\\) and \\(x + y\\) must be positive. Also, the base 6 is valid.\n\nSecond equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\). Here, the base \\(y\\) must be positive, not equal to 1, and the argument \\(5x\\) must be positive.\n\nLet me first find \\(y\\) when \\(x = 9\\). From equation (2): \\(y^2 = 5x = 5*9 = 45\\), so \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\). But since \\(y\\) is the base of a logarithm in the second equation, it must be positive and not equal to 1. So \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) is acceptable (since sqrt(45) is positive and not 1). The negative root is invalid here.\n\nSo, \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\). Let's check the first equation's arguments:\n\n\\(x - y = 9 - \\sqrt{45}\\). Since sqrt(45) is approximately 6.708, so 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292, which is positive.\n\n\\(x + y = 9 + \\sqrt{45}\\) ≈ 15.708, which is also positive. So both arguments are positive, so that's okay.\n\nNow, check the second equation's"

So \\(y^2 = -20\\), which is impossible since a square of a real number cannot be negative. Therefore, \\(y\\) cannot be real in this case. Hence, \\(x = -4\\) is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\(x = 9\\).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this because sometimes when dealing with logs, especially with multiple variables, other things can come into play.\n\nLet me substitute \\(x=9\\) and \\(y=\\sqrt{45}\\) back into the original equations to verify.\n\nFirst equation: \\(\\log_6(9 - \\sqrt{45}) + \\log_6(9 + \\sqrt{45})\\).\n\nWe know that \\(9 - \\sqrt{45}\\) and \\(9 + \\sqrt{45}\\) multiply to \\( (9)^2 - (\\sqrt{45})^2 = 81 - 45 = 36\\). So, the product of the two terms is 36. Therefore, \\(\\log_6(36) + \\log_6(1)\\) since \\(9 + sqrt(45) = 36/sqrt(45)\\), wait no, perhaps I should see it differently.\n\nWait, the product is 36, so \\(\\log_6(36) = 2\\) because 6^2 = 36.\n\nBut the sum of the logs is 2, which matches the first equation. So that's correct.\n\nSecond equation: \\(\\log_y(5x) = 2\\). With x=9, 5x=45, and y= sqrt(45). So, \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{45}}(45)\\). \n\nLet me compute this. Since \\(\\sqrt{45}\\) is 45^{1/2}, and 45 is 45^{2}. So, \\(\\log_{45^{1/2}}(45^{2}) = 2\\). Because (45^{1/2})^2 = 45, so yes, it's correct.\n\nTherefore, \\("
