I remember that when you add two logs with the same base, it's equivalent to the log of the product. So, log_b a + log_b c = log_b (a * c). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first equation: log_6 (x - y) + log_6 (x + y) = 2. Using the property, this simplifies to log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nOkay, that looks better. Now, the expression inside the log is (x - y)(x + y), which I recognize as a difference of squares. So that's x^2 - y^2. So the equation becomes log_6 (x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2.\n\nNow, to get rid of the log, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that log_b a = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So here, base 6 raised to the power of 2 equals x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. \n\nSo, 6\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. Calculating that, 6 squared is 36. So, 36 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\nAlright, so that's our first equation simplified: x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log base y of (5x) equals 2. Again, using the logarithm property, this means that y squared equals 5x. So, y\u00b2 = 5x.\n\nNow, so far, we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36\n2. y\u00b2 = 5x\n\nHmm, maybe I can substitute the second equation into the first one. Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation 2, y\u00b2 is 5x, so plugging that into equation 1: x\u00b2 - 5x = 36.\n\nSo, now I have a quadratic equation: x\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = "

Let's think: factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nWait, 4 and 9: if I have -9 and 4, their product is -36 and their sum is -5. Perfect!\n\nSo, the equation factors as (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = 9 or x = -4.\n\nBut, wait, I need to consider the domain of the original logarithmic equations because the arguments of the logs must be positive.\n\nSo, let's check for x = 9 first.\n\nFrom equation 2: y\u00b2 = 5x = 5 * 9 = 45. So y\u00b2 = 45, which means y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45).\n\nBut, the arguments of the logs in the first equation are (x - y) and (x + y). So, we need both (x - y) > 0 and (x + y) > 0.\n\nLet's take y = sqrt(45) \u2248 6.708.\n\nSo, x - y \u2248 9 - 6.708 \u2248 2.292 > 0. That's good.\n\nx + y \u2248 9 + 6.708 \u2248 15.708 > 0. Also good.\n\nNow, let's check if both logs are defined. Since both (x - y) and (x + y) are positive, the first equation is valid.\n\nNow, let's check x = -4.\n\nFrom equation 2: y\u00b2 = 5 * (-4) = -20. Hmm, y\u00b2 can't be negative because you can't have a square root of a negative number in real numbers. So y\u00b2 = -20 implies y is imaginary, which isn't allowed here because we're dealing with real numbers (assuming the problem is in real numbers). \n\nTherefore, x = -4 is not a valid solution.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nWait, but let me double-check everything to be sure I"

Let me compute that. Let me write log_{sqrt(45)} 45. Let me recall that log_b a = (ln a)/(ln b). So, log_{sqrt(45)} 45 = (ln 45)/(ln sqrt(45)) = (ln 45)/( (1/2) ln 45 ) ) = 2. So that works out. So that's correct.\n\nAlso, the first equation: log_6 (x - y) + log_6 (x + y) = log_6 ( (x - y)(x + y) ) = log_6 (x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = log_6 (36) = 2, since 6^2 = 36. That checks out.\n\nSo, all the conditions are satisfied for x = 9. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, what about the other possible y value? Since y\u00b2 = 45, y could also be negative sqrt(45). Let me see if that's allowed.\n\nIf y is negative, then in the second equation, log base y of 5x. The base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1. So, y must be positive and not 1. Since y = sqrt(45) is positive and not 1, that's okay. But if y were negative, then the base of the logarithm would be negative, which is invalid. So y must be positive. Therefore, y = sqrt(45) is the only valid solution here.\n\nTherefore, x = 9 is the only valid solution.\n\nHmm, so I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes here. Let me recap the steps again quickly:\n\n1. Combined the two logs into a single log using product rule.\n2. Converted to exponential form to get x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n3. From the second equation, expressed y\u00b2 in terms of x (y\u00b2 = 5x).\n4. Substituted into the first equation to get a quadratic in"

So, x must be 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given logarithmic equations.\n\nFirst, we use the logarithm addition rule on the equation \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\n\\]\n\nConverting this to exponential form gives:\n\n\\[\n6^2 = x^2 - y^2 \\implies 36 = x^2 - y^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we simplify the second equation \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\).

However, substituting \\(x = -4\\) into \\(y^2 = 5x\\) results in \\(y^2 = -20\\), which is impossible for real numbers. Thus, \\(x = -4\\) is discarded.\n\nChecking \\(x = 9\\) in \\(y^2 = 5x\\) yields \\(y^2 = 45\\), giving \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) (since \\(y\\) must be positive to satisfy the logarithm base condition). \n\nFinally, verifying the original logarithmic equations confirms that they are satisfied with \\(x = 9\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\("
