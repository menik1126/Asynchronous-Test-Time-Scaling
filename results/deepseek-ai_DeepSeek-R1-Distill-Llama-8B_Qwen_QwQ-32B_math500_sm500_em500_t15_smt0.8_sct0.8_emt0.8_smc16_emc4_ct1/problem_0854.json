Multiplying both sides by 2 eliminates the fraction. This gives me \\( 3x - 9 = 2x + 74 \\).\n\nNext, I'll subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides to get all the \\( x \\) terms on one side. This simplifies the equation to \\( x - 9 = 74 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll add 9 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\). This results in \\( x = 83 \\).\n</think>\n\nSure! Let's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the original equation**\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2**\n\\[ 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\times (x + 37) \\]\n\\[ 3x - 9 = 2x + 74 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides to get all \\( x \\) terms on one side**\n\\[ 3x - 2x - 9 = 74 \\]\n\\[ x - 9 = 74 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Add 9 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\)**\n\\[ x - 9 + 9 = 74 + 9 \\]\n\\[ x = 83 \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[ \\boxed{83} \\]"
