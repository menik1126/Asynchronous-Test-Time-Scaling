            "output": "First, I need to translate the given statement into an equation. It says that half the value of (3x - 9) is equal to (x + 37). To find half of (3x - 9), I multiply it by 1/2.\n\nSo, (1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37.\n\nNext, I'll distribute the 1/2 across the terms inside the parentheses. This gives me (3x/2) - (9/2) = x + 37.\n\nNow, to make this equation easier to solve, I should eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 1, so I'll multiply every term by 2 to get rid of them.\n\nMultiplying each term by 2, I obtain 3x - 9 = 2x + 74.\n\nThen, I'll subtract 2x from both sides to gather the x terms on one side. This results in x - 9 = 74.\n\nFinally, I'll add 9 to both sides to isolate x. This gives me x = 83.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation where half the value of \\(3x - 9\\) equals \\(x + 37\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Translate the statement into an equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distribute the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) across the terms inside the parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3x}{2} - \\frac{9}{2} = x + 37\n   \\]\n\n3. **Eliminate the fractions by multiplying each term by 2:**\n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to gather like terms:**\n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add 9 to both sides to isolate \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 83\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{83}\n\\]"
