            "output": "To solve the problem, I need to determine the length of the hallway the robot travels in 90 seconds while moving at a constant speed.\n\nFirst, I'll find the robot's speed. It travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. Since speed is distance divided by time, the robot's speed is 1 km ÷ 2.5 hours, which equals 0.4 km/h or 400 meters per hour.\n\nNext, I'll convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second to match the time units. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so 400 meters per hour divided by 3600 seconds gives a speed of approximately 0.111 meters per second.\n\nNow, knowing the robot's speed, I can calculate the hallway's length by multiplying the speed by the time taken. 0.111 meters per second multiplied by 90 seconds equals 10 meters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of the hallway, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Robot's Speed:**\n   \n   - **Distance Traveled:** 1 kilometer (1,000 meters)\n   - **Time Taken:** 2.5 hours\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1,\\!000 \\text{ meters}}{2.5 \\text{ hours}} = 400 \\text{ meters per hour}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the Speed to Meters per Second:**\n   \n   - **1 hour = 3,\\!600 seconds**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{400 \\text{ m/h}}{3,\\!600 \\text{ seconds/hour}} = 0.1111 \\text{ meters per second}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of the Hallway:**\n   \n   - **Time Taken:** 90 seconds\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 0.1111 \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ s} \\approx 10 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10 \\text{ meters}}\n\\]"
