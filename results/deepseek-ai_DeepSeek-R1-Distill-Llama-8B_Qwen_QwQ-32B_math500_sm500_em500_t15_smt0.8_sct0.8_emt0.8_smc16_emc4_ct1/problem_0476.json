Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with symmetric equations involving three variables, sometimes using symmetric sums can help. The expressions \\( x + y + z \\), \\( xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( xyz \\) are the elementary symmetric sums. Maybe if I can find these, it could help solve the problem.\n\nLooking at the given equations, the first one is already in terms of the elementary symmetric sum \\( xyz = 4 \\). The second equation is about the sum of cubes, and the third equation is a bit more complicated. Let me write down what I know:\n\n- Let \\( S = x + y + z \\)\n- Let \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\) (this is what we need to find)\n- Let \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\)\n\nI also recall that the sum of cubes can be expressed using the formula:\n\\[\nx^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz\n\\]\nSo plugging in the known values:\n\\[\n4 = S^3 - 3SP + 3(4)\n\\]\nSimplifying that:\n\\[\n4 = S^3 - 3SP + 12\n\\]\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\\[\n-8 = S^3 - 3SP\n\\]\nLet me write that as:\n\\[\nS^3 - 3SP = -8 \\quad \\text{(Equation A)}\n\\]\nOkay, so that's one equation involving S and P.\n\nNow, looking at the third equation:\n\\[\nxy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\n\\]\nThis"
