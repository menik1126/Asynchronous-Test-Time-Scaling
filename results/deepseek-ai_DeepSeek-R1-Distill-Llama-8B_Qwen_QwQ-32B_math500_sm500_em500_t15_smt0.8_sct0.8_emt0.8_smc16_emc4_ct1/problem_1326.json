Let me carefully read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have a rectangle ABCD with center O. The ratio of AB to AD is k. So, AB is the length of the longer side, and AD is the shorter side, or vice versa, depending on the rectangle's dimensions. A point is randomly chosen from the interior of the rectangle, and we need to find the probability that this point is closer to the center O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the rectangle. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. The center O is the intersection point of the diagonals of the rectangle.\n\nGiven that AB/AD = k, I can denote AB as the length of one side, say the horizontal side, and AD as the vertical side. So, let's assume AB = k * AD. This ratio will be important in determining the regions within the rectangle where a point is closer to O than to any vertex.\n\nSince the problem is about probability, I know that the probability will be the area of the region where the condition is met divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Assign coordinates to the rectangle to make calculations easier.\n2. Express the distance from any point inside the rectangle to O and to each vertex.\n3. Find the region where the distance to O is less than the distance to any vertex.\n4. Determine the area of this region.\n5. Divide it by the total area of the rectangle to get the probability.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me place the rectangle such that its center O is at the origin (0, 0). Then, the rectangle's sides will be symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis.\n\nSince AB is the length of the horizontal side, and AD is the vertical side, with AB/AD = k, I can denote AB = k * AD. Let me let AD = a, so AB = k * a. Therefore, the rectangle's dimensions are AB = k * a and AD = a.\n\nBut wait, if I place the rectangle with its center at (0, 0), then the coordinates of the vertices will be:\n\n- A: (-k * a / 2, a / 2)\n- B: (k *"

Let me let the rectangle have length 2L (so from -L to L on the x-axis) and width 2W (from -W to W on the y-axis). Then, the center is at (0,0). Then, the sides AB and AD would be length 2L and 2W, respectively, but wait, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are length and width. But in the problem, AB/AD = k. So let me see.\n\nWait, in rectangle ABCD, each vertex is connected as A to B to C to D to A. So AB is one side, BC is the other. Since it's a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. The center is the intersection of the diagonals.\n\nSo, let me let AB be the length of the side from A to B, which is horizontal, and AD be the length from A to D, which is vertical. Therefore, AB is the horizontal side, and AD is the vertical side.\n\nTherefore, if the rectangle is centered at (0,0), then the coordinates would be:\n\n- A: (- (AB/2), AD/2)\n- B: (AB/2, AD/2)\n- C: (AB/2, - AD/2)\n- D: (- (AB/2), - AD/2)\n\nWait, actually, coordinates depend on how we orient it. Let me think of the rectangle as centered at (0,0) so that the vertices are at (\u00b1a, \u00b1b), where the length along the x-axis is 2a, and the length along the y-axis is 2b. Then AB would be the side from (-a, b) to (a, b), so that length AB is 2a, and AD would be from (-a, b) to (-a, -b), so length AD is 2b. Therefore, the ratio AB/AD would be (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. Therefore, a = k*b.\n\nHmm, that seems better. Let me use variables such that:\n\nLet\u2019s define"

The vertices are:\n\n- A: (-a, b)\n- B: (a, b)\n- C: (a, -b)\n- D: (-a, -b)\n\nSo, the rectangle extends from x = -a to x = a, and y = -b to y = b.\n\nNow, a point (x,y) inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. So, for each vertex, the set of points closer to that vertex than to O is the region inside the perpendicular bisector between the point and the vertex. So, the locus of points equidistant to O and a given vertex is the perpendicular bisector between O and that vertex. Therefore, the region closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions closer to O than each vertex.\n\nTherefore, the area we're interested in is the set of points where for all four vertices, the distance to O is less than the distance to the vertex.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the region as being within all four perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex. So, each perpendicular bisector divides the plane into two regions: one closer to O and one closer to the vertex. So, the region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the four regions closer to O than each vertex.\n\nTo find this region, I can find the equations of each perpendicular bisector and then find the shape defined by their intersection.\n\nThen, the area of this region can be computed, and the probability will be that area divided by the area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's assign specific coordinates. Let me let b = 1 for simplicity, so a = k. Then, the rectangle extends from x = -k to x = k, and y = -1 to y = 1. The area of the rectangle is then (2k)*(2*1) = 4k. Wait, no, 2k *"

Hmm, but maybe keeping variables as a and b is better so that we can see the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to let the rectangle have sides of length 2 and 2k, so that the ratio AB/AD = k. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, in the problem, AB is the length of the side, so if AB is the horizontal side, then AB = 2a, and AD is the vertical side, so AD = 2b. Then, the ratio AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, a = k*b. So, if I set b = 1, then a = k. So, the rectangle is from x = -k to x = k, and y = -1 to y =1. The area is (2k)*(2) = 4k.

Wait, when k >=\u221a3, then (k\u00b2 +3)/(2k) <=k.\n\nBecause, as above, 3 <=k\u00b2 \u21d2(k\u00b2 +3)/(2k) <= (k\u00b2 +k\u00b2)/(2k)= (2k\u00b2)/(2k)=k.\n\nSo, for k >=\u221a3, the intersection of line from A with y=1 is at x=(k\u00b2 +3)/(2k) <=k, so within the rectangle.\n\nSimilarly, for line from B:\n\nThe x-coordinate where it intersects y=1 is (k\u00b2 -1)/(2k)\n\nWhich is less than k for all k >1, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for line from C and D, we can see that for k >=1, their intersection points with y=-1 and x=\u00b1k are within the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, for all k >=1, the diamond's vertices are within the rectangle on the x-axis, and their projections on the y-axis lie outside the rectangle, so the region is bounded by the four bisectors within the rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps I was overcomplicating before. Let's proceed with this understanding.\n\nSo, the region where the point is closer to O than any vertex is the area inside the rectangle and bounded by the four perpendicular bisectors. Since for k >=1, the diamond's vertices on the x-axis are within the rectangle, and on the y-axis are outside, the region is"
