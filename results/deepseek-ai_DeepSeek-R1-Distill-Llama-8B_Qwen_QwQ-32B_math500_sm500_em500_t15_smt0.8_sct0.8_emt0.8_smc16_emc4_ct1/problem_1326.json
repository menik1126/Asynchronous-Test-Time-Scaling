I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should probably visualize the rectangle. It's a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The center O is the intersection point of the diagonals, right? So, O is equidistant from all four vertices. That makes sense.\n\nGiven that AB is the length and AD is the width, and their ratio is k. So, if AB is the length, then AB = k * AD. Let me note that down. Let's denote the length as 'k' times the width. Let's say the width is 'd', so the length would be 'k*d'. Hmm, maybe I can assume specific values for d and k to make the calculations easier? Or perhaps I can work with variables for now.\n\nNow, I need to find the region within the rectangle where any point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. That is, for a given point (x, y) inside the rectangle, the distance to O is less than the distance to A, B, C, or D. \n\nWait, so I need to set up inequalities where the distance from (x, y) to O is less than the distance to each vertex. Then, the area where all these inequalities hold true divided by the total area of the rectangle will give me the probability.\n\nLet me write down the distance formulas. The distance from a point (x, y) to O, which is the center, is sqrt(x² + y²). The distance to vertex A, which is at (-a, b), would be sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²), right? Similarly, distance to B (a, b), distance to C (a, -b), and distance to D (-a, -b).\n\nWait, maybe I should assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me place the rectangle centered at the origin for simplicity. So, if the rectangle has width 2a and height 2b, then the coordinates of the vertices would be A (-a, b), B (a, b), C (a, -b), D"

Let's see, AB is the length of the side from A to B, which is the horizontal side. The length of AB is 2a, since it goes from -a to a. The length of AD is the vertical side from A to D, which is 2b. Wait, hold on, actually, AD is from A (-a, b) to D (-a, -b), so that's vertical, so its length is 2b. So AB is 2a, AD is 2b. Therefore, the ratio AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, a/b = k, so a = k*b. \n\nTherefore, if I let the width be 2a = 2k*b and the height be 2b. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to set b = 1, then a = k. Let me see. Let me choose coordinates such that the rectangle has vertices at (-k, 1), (k, 1), (k, -1), (-k, -1). Then the center is (0,0). The length AB is 2k, and the width AD is 2*1 = 2. Wait, but then AB/AD would be (2k)/2 = k, which matches the given ratio. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even simpler: Let me set the rectangle with sides of length 2a and 2b, so that AB = 2a, AD = 2b, so the ratio AB/AD = a/b = k. So, a = k*b. Then, the coordinates can be set as (-a, b), (a, b), etc. \n\nEither way, the key is that the rectangle is centered at the origin, with sides parallel to the axes, and the ratio of length to width is k. \n\nNow, the problem is to find the region inside the rectangle where the distance to O is less than the distance to each of the four vertices. \n\nAlternatively, the set of points closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions where distance to O is less"

Specifically, for each vertex, the set of points (x,y) such that sqrt(x² + y²) < distance to the vertex.\n\nSo, let's compute the distance to each vertex.\n\nFor vertex A at (-a, b), the distance to (x, y) is sqrt((x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2). \n\nSo, the inequality would be sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2). \n\nSquaring both sides, we get x² + y² < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2.\n\nExpanding the right-hand side: (x + a)^2 = x² + 2a x + a², and (y - b)^2 = y² - 2b y + b². So, adding them, we get x² + 2a x + a² + y² - 2b y + b².\n\nSo, subtracting x² + y² from both sides, we get 0 < 2a x + a² - 2b y + b².\n\nSo, 2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other vertices:\n\n- Vertex B (a, b): distance squared is (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2.

The boundary between these regions is the perpendicular bisector between A and O, which we already found as Line 1: 2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²)=0.\n\nThe region closer to A is the area on the A side of this bisector.
