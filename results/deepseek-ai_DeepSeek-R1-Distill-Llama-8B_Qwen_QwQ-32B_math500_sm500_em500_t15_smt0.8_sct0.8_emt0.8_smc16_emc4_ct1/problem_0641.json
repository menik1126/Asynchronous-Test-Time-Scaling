Additionally, it tells me that P(11) = 181, and I need to find P(16). \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly P(x) is. Since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, it has the general form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real coefficients that I need to find. \n\nThe problem gives me that P(x) is bounded below by another quadratic, x² - 2x + 2, and above by another quadratic, 2x² - 4x + 3. So, for all real x, P(x) must be greater than or equal to x² - 2x + 2, and less than or equal to 2x² - 4x + 3. \n\nHmm, so how can a single quadratic be between these two? Maybe they touch each other at certain points? Or perhaps the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is non-negative, and the difference between the upper bound and P(x) is non-negative for all x. \n\nLet me write down the inequalities:\n\n1. P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n2. (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSo, if I subtract the lower bound from P(x), I get P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2). Since this is always non-negative, this quadratic must be ≥ 0 for all x. Similarly, subtracting P(x) from the upper bound gives (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nBut for a quadratic to be always non-negative or always non-positive, it must have a discriminant ≤ 0. If it's always non-negative, discriminant ≤ 0. Similarly, if it's always non-positive, discriminant ≤ 0 as well, but the leading"

So, let me calculate the discriminant for both cases.\n\nFirst, let's define two quadratics:\n\nD1(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\nD2(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c)\n\nFor D1(x) to be non-negative for all x, it must satisfy two conditions:\n1. The leading coefficient (a - 1) must be ≥ 0.\n2. The discriminant of D1(x) must be ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, for D2(x) to be non-negative for all x:\n1. The leading coefficient (2 - a) must be ≥ 0.\n2. The discriminant of D2(x) must be ≤ 0.\n\nSo now, I can set up these conditions.\n\nFrom D1:\n1. a - 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≥ 1\n2. Discriminant of D1(x) ≤ 0:\n   Discriminant D1 = (b + 2)² - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0\n\nFrom D2:\n1. 2 - a ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≤ 2\n2. Discriminant of D2(x) ≤ 0:\n   D2 discriminant = (-4 - b)² - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0\n\nSo, combining the two, a must be between 1 and 2, inclusive.

Also, we have variables b and c which need to satisfy those discriminant inequalities.\n\nBut this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can find more constraints on b and c by thinking about the quadratics D1 and D2.\n\nWait, another approach: Since both D1(x) and D2(x) are non-negative for all x, they must have at most one real root each, which would be a double root (i.e., discriminant zero) if they touch the x-axis.\n\nBut for quadratics that are non-negative for all x, the leading coefficients must be positive, which we already have.\n\nAlternatively, maybe D1(x) and D2(x) can be expressed as perfect squares? Maybe, but that might not necessarily hold.\n\nBut perhaps, since P(x) is squeezed between two quadratics, and P(x) is a quadratic, maybe P(x) coincides with both D1(x) and D2(x) at certain points.\n\nWait, but D1(x) ≥0 and D2(x)≥0. So, P(x) can be written as P(x) = x² - 2x + 2 + k(x), where k(x) is a non-negative quadratic with leading coefficient (a -1) ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, P(x) = 2x² -4x +3 - m(x), where m(x) is a non-negative quadratic with leading coefficient (2 - a) ≥0.\n\nSo, if I set both expressions equal because both are equal to P(x):\n\nx² -2x + 2 + k(x) = 2x² -4x +3 - m(x)\n\nThen, simplifying, x² -2x + 2 + k(x) = 2x² -4x +3 - m(x)\n\nSo, bringing all terms to one side:\n\n(2x² -4x +3 - m(x)) - (x² -2x + 2 + k(x)) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx² -2x +1 - (m(x) + k(x)) = 0\n\nWait, this seems more complicated.

Since P(x) is between them everywhere, maybe they touch at two points, so that the difference quadratics D1 and D2 have double roots?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal case is when D1 and D2 are both perfect squares, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference between the upper and lower bounds is another quadratic, and P(x) is exactly halfway? But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is (2x² -4x +3) - (x² -2x +2) = x² -2x +1 = (x -1)^2. So the upper bound is exactly the lower bound plus (x-1)^2. So, the difference between the upper and lower bounds is (x-1)^2. Therefore, P(x) must lie between the lower bound and the lower bound plus (x-1)^2. So, P(x) can be written as the lower bound plus some multiple of (x-1)^2, but such that the multiple is between 0 and 1 for all x? Wait, but (x-1)^2 is always non-negative, so if we set P(x) = lower bound + t(x)*(x-1)^2, where t(x) is between 0 and 1 for all x. But since P(x) is a quadratic, then t(x) must be a constant, because otherwise, if t(x) is a function, then P(x) would be a higher degree polynomial. Wait, but P(x) is quadratic, so t(x) must be a constant. Let me see:\n\nSuppose P(x) = (x² -2x +2) + t*(x -1)^2, where t is a constant between 0 and 1. Then, expanding this:\n\n(x² -2x +2) + t*(x² -2x +1) = (1 + t)x² + (-2 -2t)x + (2 + t)\n\nSimilarly, the upper bound is 2x² -4x +3. Let's see if this can be equal when t=1:\n\n(1+1)x² + (-2 -2)x"

So, when t=1, P(x) equals the upper bound, but in our case, P(x) is less than or equal to the upper bound, so t must be ≤1. Wait, but can t be equal to 1? Because P(x) is less than or equal to the upper bound for all x, so if t=1, P(x) equals the upper bound. So, t can be up to 1.\n\nAlternatively, t is between 0 and 1, but maybe for some x, t is less than or equal to1.\n\nWait, but actually, in order for P(x) to be quadratic, (x-1)^2 must not have a coefficient that would make P(x) higher than quadratic. So, if I set P(x) as lower bound + t*(x-1)^2, as above, then P(x) is quadratic as required.\n\nSo, perhaps P(x) can be written as:\n\nP(x) = (1 + t)x² + (-2 - 2t)x + (2 + t)\n\nAnd this needs to equal both the lower bound plus some non-negative multiple, but given that we must have both D1(x) and D2(x) non-negative, as we saw earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t is 1, but that would make P(x) the upper bound, but P(x) can be any quadratic between the two.
