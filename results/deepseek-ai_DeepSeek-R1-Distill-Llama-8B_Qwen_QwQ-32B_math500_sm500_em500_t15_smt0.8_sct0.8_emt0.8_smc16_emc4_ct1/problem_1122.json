            "output": "I need to determine the length of the hallway in meters. The robot's speed is constant, so I can calculate its speed using the distance and time it takes to travel 1 kilometer.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the robot's speed by dividing the distance by the time. Speed equals distance divided by time, so that's 1 kilometer divided by 2.5 hours, which gives me a speed of 0.4 kilometers per hour.\n\nNext, I want to convert this speed into meters per second because the hallway's time is given in seconds. I know that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters and 1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds. So, I'll multiply the speed by these conversion factors: 0.4 km/h multiplied by 1000 meters/km is 400 meters per hour. Then, 400 meters per hour divided by 3600 seconds per hour gives me a speed of approximately 0.1111 meters per second.\n\nNow, I'll use the speed of 0.1111 meters per second to find out how long the hallway is. I have the time it takes to travel the hallway as 90 seconds. So, distance equals speed multiplied by time, which means the hallway's length is 0.1111 meters/second multiplied by 90 seconds, resulting in 10 meters.\n\nTherefore, the hallway is 10 meters long.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Robot's Speed:**\n   - The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n   - Speed = Distance / Time = 1 km / 2.5 hours = 0.4 km/h.\n\n2. **Convert Speed from km/h to m/s:**\n   - 1 km = 1000 meters.\n   - 1 hour = 3600 seconds.\n   - Speed = 0.4 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 0.4 * (1000/3600) m/s = 0.1111 m/s.\n\n3. **Calculate the Hallway Length:**\n   - Time taken to travel the hallway = 90 seconds.\n   - Distance = Speed * Time = 0.1111 m/s * 90 s = 10 meters.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{10} meters."
