            "output": "First, I recognize that the expression involves multiple layers of roots, so I'll start by addressing the innermost radical.\n\nThe innermost part is the cube root of 1/729. I know that 729 is equal to 9 cubed, so the cube root of 1/729 simplifies to 1/9.\n\nNext, I'll substitute this back into the expression, which now becomes the square root of 1/9. The square root of 1/9 is straightforward; it's 1/3.\n\nFinally, I take the square root of 1/3. To rationalize the denominator, I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by the square root of 3. This gives me √3 divided by 3, which is the simplified form with a rational denominator.\n</think>\n\nLet's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n$$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the innermost cube root.**\n$$\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the cube root inside the square root.\n\n1. **Calculate the cube root of 1/729:**\n   $$\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{729}} = \\frac{1}{9}\n   $$\n   (Because \\(9^3 = 729\\).)\n\n**Step 2: Substitute back into the expression.**\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9}}$$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the square root.**\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the outer square root.**\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}$$\n\n**Step 5: Rationalize the denominator.**\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\):\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$$\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}\n$$"
