            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to simplify the expression √(³√(√(1/729))). Hmm, that seems a bit complex with all the roots involved. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that 729 is a familiar number. I think it's a power of 9 because 9 times 9 is 81, and 81 times 9 is 729. So, 9^3 is 729. Wait, no, 9^3 is 729? Let me check: 9 times 9 is 81, and 81 times 9 is indeed 729. So, 9^3 is 729, which means 1/729 is 1/(9^3). That might be helpful later.\n\nOkay, so starting inside out, the innermost part is √(1/729). Let me write that down: √(1/729). I remember that the square root of a fraction is the same as the square root of the numerator divided by the square root of the denominator. So, √(1)/√(729). The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729 is... Hmm, I think 27 because 27 times 27 is 729. Let me verify: 27 squared is 729, yes. So, √(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nAlright, now moving one layer out, the expression becomes the cube root of that result. So, the next step is ³√(1/27). Again, using the property of roots, the cube root of a fraction is the cube root of the numerator divided by the cube root of the denominator. So, ³√(1)/³√(27). The cube root of 1 is still 1. What's the cube root of 27? Since 3^3 is 27, so that's 3. So, ³√(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nNow, the expression is simplified to the square root of 1/3. So, √(1/3). Using the same logic as before, the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 3 remains 3, but we can't have a square root in the denominator, so we need to rationalize the denominator.\n\nTo rationalize 1/√3, I"

            "output": " can multiply numerator and denominator by √3. That gives (1*√3)/(√3*√3) = √3/(3). Wait, but the original problem says to write the result with a rational denominator, so that's exactly what we need here. So, √(1/3) simplifies to √3/3.\n\nLet me recap all the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start with the innermost radical: √(1/729) = 1/27.\n2. Then take the cube root of that result: ³√(1/27) = 1/3.\n3. Finally, take the square root of that: √(1/3) = √3/3.\n\nWait a second, let me check each step again to ensure there are no mistakes. \n\nFirst step: √(1/729). Since 729 is 9^3, but the square root of 9^3 would be 9^(3/2) which is 27. So, √(1/729) is indeed 1/27. That's correct.\n\nSecond step: cube root of 1/27. Since 27 is 3^3, so cube root of 1/3^3 is 1/3. That's right.\n\nThird step: square root of 1/3. To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by √3, resulting in √3/3. Yep, that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the final simplified form with a rational denominator is √3 over 3. Let me just confirm once more that all the exponents and roots are handled properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express everything using exponents with fractional powers to see if I get the same result. Let's try that approach.\n\nStarting with the original expression:\n\n√(³√(√(1/729))) \n\nExpressed with exponents, that would be:\n\n[( ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) )^(1/2) ]\n\nWait, let me parse the order correctly. The innermost is the square root of (1/729), which is (1/729)^(1/2). Then, the cube root of that is"

            "output": " [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6). Then, the square root of that is [ (1/729)^(1/6) ]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nHmm, so that's (1/729) raised to the power of 1/12.\n\nBut 729 is 9^3, which is (3^2)^3 = 3^(6). So, 1/729 is 1/(3^6) = (1/3)^6.\n\nTherefore, (1/(3^6))^(1/12) = (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/(3^(1/2)) = √3/3.\n\nWait, so that's another way to look at it, and I arrive at the same result. So, that's reassuring.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same answer. I feel more confident now that the simplification is correct.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of the original expression with a rational denominator is √3 divided by 3.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is simplified by evaluating each root step by step, starting from the innermost radical. Each operation reduces the complexity, leading to the final result with a rational denominator.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}"
