To do this, I'll calculate the ratio of male to female bus riders for each grade.\n\nFor each grade, I'll divide the percentage of male bus riders by the percentage of female bus riders. This will give me the ratio of males to females. Then, I'll compare this ratio to 1.35 (which represents 135%).\n\nNext, I'll compute the absolute difference between the calculated ratio and 1.35 for each grade. The grade with the smallest difference will be the one where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders.\n\nFinally, I'll present the grade that meets the criteria with the smallest difference.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to find the grade where \\( \\text{Number of Male Riders} \\) is approximately \\( 1.35 \\times \\text{Number of Female Riders} \\).\n   - This means \\( \\frac{\\text{Males}}{\\text{Females}} \\approx 1.35 \\) or \\( \\text{Males} \\approx 1.35 \\times \\text{Females} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Ratio for Each Grade:**\n   - For each grade, compute the ratio of male to female riders.\n   - Compare this ratio to \\( 1.35 \\), and find the smallest difference.\n\n3. **Compute the Ratios:**\n   \n   - **9th Grade:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{41.1}{39.4} \\approx 1.04\n     \\]\n     Difference: \\( 1.04 - 1.35 = -0.31 \\)\n\n   - **10th Grade:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{34.4}{33.1} \\approx 1.04\n     \\]\n     Difference: \\( 1.04 - 1.35 = -0.31 \\)\n\n   - **11th Grade:**\n     \\[\n     \\frac{20.6}{13.8} \\approx 1.49\n     \\]\n     Difference: \\( 1.49 -"
