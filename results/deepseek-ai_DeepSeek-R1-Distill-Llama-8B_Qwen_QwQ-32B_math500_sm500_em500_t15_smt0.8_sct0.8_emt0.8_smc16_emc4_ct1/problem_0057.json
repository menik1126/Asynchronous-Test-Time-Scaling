            "output": "First, I need to determine for each grade what percentage of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders.\n\nI'll start by calculating 135% of the female percentage for each grade. This gives me a target percentage to compare against the male percentages.\n\nFor the 9th grade, 135% of 39.4% is 53.01%. The male percentage is 41.1%, which is lower than 53.01%, so the difference is 11.91%.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the 10th grade. Calculating 135% of 33.1% gives 44.635%. The male percentage is 34.4%, with a difference of 10.235%.\n\nMoving on to the 11th grade, 135% of 13.8% is 18.57%. The male percentage is 20.6%, resulting in a difference of 2.03%.\n\nFinally, for the 12th grade, 135% of 8.6% is 11.59%. The male percentage is 11.6%, which matches closely with the target, giving a difference of 0.01%.\n\nComparing all the differences, the 12th grade has the smallest difference, making it the grade where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the data step by step to determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to **135%** of the number of female bus riders.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe need to find the grade where:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Male Bus Riders} = 135\\% \\times \\text{Number of Female Bus Riders} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate 135% of Female Bus Riders for Each Grade\nFor each grade, compute **135%** of the female bus riders' percentage and compare it with the male bus riders' percentage.\n\n| **Grade**   | **Males** (\\%) | **Females** (\\%) | **135% of Females** | **Difference** (Males vs 135% Females) |\n|------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|\n| **9\\textsuperscript{th} Grade** | 41.1              | 39.4              | **53.01**            |"
