Let’s denote the pay per dog as \"p.\" Therefore, Denali's pay is 16p and Nate's pay is 12p.\n\nNow, the problem introduces two scenarios where the ratio of their pays remains the same. The first scenario involves Denali walking 4x more dogs while Nate stays at 12 dogs. The second scenario involves reassigning x of Nate's dogs to Denali without changing the number of dogs Denali walks.\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali walks 16 + 4x dogs, and Nate still walks 12 dogs. The ratio of their pays should remain equal to the initial ratio. So, the ratio of Denali’s new pay to Nate's pay is (16 + 4x)p / 12p. Setting this equal to the initial ratio gives:\n\n(16 + 4x) / 12 = 16 / 12\n\nSimplifying this equation leads to:\n\n16 + 4x = 16\n\nFrom this, we can solve for x:\n\n4x = 0\nx = 0\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that x ≠ 0, so this scenario doesn't provide a valid solution.\n\nIn the second scenario, x dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali. This increases Denali’s dog count by x and decreases Nate's by x. Now, Denali walks 16 + x dogs, and Nate walks 12 - x dogs. The ratio of their pays remains equal:\n\n(16 + x)p / (12 - x)p = 16 / 12\n\nSimplifying gives:\n\n(16 + x) / (12 - x) = 16 / 12\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for x:\n\n12(16 + x) = 16(12 - x)\n192 + 12x = 192 - 16x\n12x + 16x = 192 - 192\n28x = 0\nx = 0\n\nAgain, this leads to x = 0, which contradicts the condition x ≠ 0.\n\nSince both scenarios result in x = 0, which is not allowed, there must be"

That means the ratio from the first scenario must equal the ratio from the second scenario. \n\nLet me re-examine the problem. The key is that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is the same in both scenarios. So, the ratio when Denali takes 4x more dogs (and Nate stays at 12) must equal the ratio when x dogs are moved from Nate to Denali.\n\nSo, setting the two ratios equal:\n\n(16 + 4x)/12 = (16 + x)/(12 - x)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n16*12 -16x + 48x -4x² = 192 + 12x\n\nCalculating left side:\n\n192 + 32x -4x² = 192 + 12x\n\nSubtract 192 from both sides:\n\n32x -4x² = 12x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-4x² + 32x -12x = 0 → -4x² +20x =0\n\nFactor:\n\n-4x(x -5) =0 → x=0 or x=5\n\nSince x≠0, the solution is x=5.\n\nWait, let me check the algebra again to be sure.\n\nStarting from cross-multiplication:\n\n(16 +4x)(12 -x) = (16 +x)(12)\n\nLeft side: 16*12 +16*(-x) +4x*12 +4x*(-x) = 192 -16x +48x -4x² = 192 +32x -4x²\n\nRight side: 12*(16 +x) = 192 +12x\n\nSet equal:\n\n192 +32x -4x² = 192 +12x\n\nSubtract 192 from both sides:\n\n32x -4x² =12x\n\nSubtract 12x:\n\n20x -4x² =0"

Denali initially walks 16 dogs, and Nate walks 12 dogs. The company's new policy allows them to be reassigned dogs in groups of x. The key is that the ratio of their pays remains the same in two different scenarios.\n\n1. **First Scenario**: Denali walks 4x more dogs, and Nate stays at 12 dogs.\n2. **Second Scenario**: x dogs from Nate are reassigned to Denali.\n\nThe ratio of their pays should be equal in both scenarios. By setting up the equations for both scenarios and solving them, we find that x must be 5 to satisfy both conditions without x being zero.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{5}"
