Denali has 16 dogs, and Nate has 12 dogs. The initial ratio of their pays is \\( \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nUnder the first scenario, Denali would walk \\( 4x \\) more dogs, making her total 16 + 4x dogs. Nate's number of dogs remains at 12. The ratio of their pays in this case should still be \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\). Therefore, I can set up the equation \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nSolving the first equation:\nMultiply both sides by 12 to eliminate the denominator:\n\\( 16 + 4x = 16 \\)\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\\( 4x = 0 \\)\nDivide by 4:\n\\( x = 0 \\)\n\nBut \\( x \\) cannot be zero based on the problem statement, so this scenario doesn't provide a valid solution. Therefore, I need to consider the second scenario to find \\( x \\).\n\nIn the second scenario, \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. This means Denali will have \\( 16 + x \\) dogs and Nate will have \\( 12 - x \\) dogs. The ratio of their pays should still be \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\). Thus, I set up the equation \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nSolving the second equation:\nCross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:\n\\( 3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x) \\)\nExpand both sides:\n\\( 48 + 3x = 48 - 4x \\)\nSubtract 48 from both sides:\n\\( 3x = -4x \\)\nAdd \\( 4x \\) to both sides:\n\\( 7x = 0 \\)\nDivide by 7:\n\\( x = 0 \\)\n\nAgain, \\( x = 0 \\), which isn't allowed.

Therefore, my initial approach might be incorrect.\n\nLet me reconsider the problem. Perhaps the pay ratio should remain the same without the addition of dogs in the first scenario. Let's adjust the first equation accordingly:\n\nFirst scenario:\nDenali walks \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs.\nNate walks 12 dogs.\nRatio \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 12:\n\\( 16 + 4x = 16 \\)\nSubtract 16:\n\\( 4x = 0 \\)\n\\( x = 0 \\)\n\nStill, \\( x = 0 \\) is the only solution, which isn't valid.\n\nNow, focusing solely on the second scenario where \\( x \\) dogs are reassigned:\n\nDenali: \\( 16 + x \\)\nNate: \\( 12 - x \\)\nRatio \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3} \\)\n\nCross-multiply:\n\\( 3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x) \\)\n\\( 48 + 3x = 48 - 4x \\)\nSubtract 48 from both sides:\n\\( 3x = -4x \\)\nAdd \\( 4x \\) to both sides:\n\\( 7x = 0 \\)\n\\( x = 0 \\)\n\nAgain, \\( x = 0 \\), which isn't allowed. This suggests that under both conditions, the ratio can only be maintained when \\( x = 0 \\), which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me revisit the problem statement and ensure I've interpreted it correctly. The ratio should remain the same in two different assignments: one where Denali gets more dogs and one where some of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. The key is to find \\( x \\) such that both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.\n\nLet me set up the equations again:\n\nFrom the first condition:\nDenali: \\( 16 + 4x \\)\nNate: 12\nRatio: \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\)\nWhich leads to \\( x = "

So the ratio in the first scenario (Denali +4x, Nate stays at 12) must equal the ratio in the second scenario (Denali +x, Nate -x). The ratio doesn't have to be the original ratio, just that the two new scenarios have the same ratio.\n\nThat's a different interpretation. I think I misunderstood the problem initially.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nLet the ratio in the first scenario be \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\).\n\nLet the ratio in the second scenario be \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\).\n\nThese two ratios must be equal. Therefore:\n\n\\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\)\n\nNow, this is the correct equation to solve for \\( x \\).\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\( (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x) \\)\n\nExpand the left side:\n\nFirst, multiply 16 by (12 - x): 16*12 = 192, 16*(-x) = -16x\n\nThen, 4x*(12 - x) = 48x - 4x²\n\nSo altogether:\n\n192 -16x +48x -4x² = 192 + 32x -4x²\n\nThe right side is 12*(16 +x) = 192 +12x\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n192 +32x -4x² ="
