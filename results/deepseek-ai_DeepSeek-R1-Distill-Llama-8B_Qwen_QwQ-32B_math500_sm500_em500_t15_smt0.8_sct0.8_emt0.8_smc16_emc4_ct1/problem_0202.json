Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that to find integer roots, I can use the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term of the polynomial and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is \\(-14\\) and the leading coefficient is \\(1\\). \n\nSince the leading coefficient is \\(1\\), the possible rational roots are just the factors of \\(-14\\). So, the possible integer roots are the divisors of \\(-14\\), which are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). Alright, so I have a list of possible candidates to test: \\(x = 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14\\).\n\nNow, I should test each of these values by substituting them into the polynomial and seeing if the result equals zero. Let me start with \\(x = 1\\):\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 1\\) into \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 is 6, 6 + 9 is 15, 15 - 1 is 14, 14 - 14 is 0\\). \n\nOh, so \\(x = 1\\) is a root. That's one integer root found. \n\nNext, let's try \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 + (-5) + 9 + 1 - 14\\). Calculating this: 1 - 5 is -4, -4 + 9 is 5, 5 + 1 is"

            "output": " 6, 6 - 14 is -8. So, not zero. Therefore, \\(x = -1\\) is not a root.\n\nMoving on to \\(x = 2\\):\n\\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14\\). Let's compute step by step: 16 + 40 is 56, 56 + 36 is 92, 92 - 2 is 90, 90 - 14 is 76. Not zero, so \\(x = 2\\) isn't a root.\n\nNow, \\(x = -2\\):\n\\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) - 14 = 16 + (-40) + 36 + 2 - 14\\). Calculating: 16 - 40 is -24, -24 + 36 is 12, 12 + 2 is 14, 14 - 14 is 0. So, \\(x = -2\\) is another integer root.\n\nAlright, so far, I've found \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\) as integer roots. Let me note that down.\n\nNext up is \\(x = 7\\):\n\\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14\\). Calculating each term: \\(7^4 = 2401\\), \\(5 \\times 343 = 1715\\), \\(9 \\times 49 = 441\\). So adding them up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116, 4116 + 441 = 4557. Then subtract 7 and 14: 4557 - 7 = 4550, 4550 -14 = 4536. Definitely not zero, so \\(x = 7\\) isn't a root.\n\nHow about \\(x = -7\\)?\n\\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) -14\\). Calculating each term: \\((-7)^4 = 2401\\), \\(5 \\times (-343) = -1715\\), \\(9 \\times 49 = 441\\). Adding them"

Not zero, so \\(x = -7\\) isn't a root.\n\nNext candidate is \\(x =14\\). Wow, that's going to be a big number. Let's compute:\n\n\\(14^4 +5(14)^3 +9(14)^2 -14 -14\\). \n\nFirst, \\(14^4 = 14 \\times 14 \\times14 \\times14\\). Let me compute step by step: 14 squared is 196, then 14 cubed is 196 \\times14 = 2744, and 14^4 is 2744 \\times14 = 38416.\n\nThen, \\(5 \\times14^3 = 5 \\times2744 = 13720\\).\n\nNext, \\(9 \\times14^2 =9 \\times196 =1764\\).\n\nSo putting it all together: 38416 +13720 = 52136, 52136 +1764 =53900. Now subtract 14 and 14: 53900 -14 =53886, 53886 -14=53872. That's way too big, not zero.\n\nSo, \\(x=14\\) is not a root.\n\nLastly, \\(x = -14\\). That would be even bigger. Let me try:\n\n\\((-14)^4 +5(-14)^3 +9(-14)^2 - (-14) -14\\).\n\nCalculating each term: \\((-14)^4 =14^4 =38416\\), \\(5 \\times (-14)^3 =5 \\times (-2744)= -13720\\), \\(9 \\times (-14)^2 =9 \\times196=1764\\).\n\nAdding them up: 38416 -13720 = 24696, 24696 +1764 =26460. Now subtracting (-14) is adding 14: 26460 +14 =26474, then subtract 14: 26474 -14=26460.\n\nNot zero, so \\(x=-14\\) isn't a root.\n\nAlright, so from the list of possible integer roots, only \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\) satisfy the equation"

Since the polynomial is of degree 4, there could be up to four roots, but they might not all be integers. So, perhaps I should factor the polynomial using the roots I found to see if there are any other linear factors.\n\nSo, starting with the given polynomial: \\(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\\). \n\nI found that \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=-2\\) are roots, so let me perform polynomial division to factor them out.\n\nFirst, let's divide the polynomial by \\((x - 1)\\). Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nUsing root x=1:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 1: 1, add to next term: 5 +1 =6.\n\nMultiply 6 by 1:6, add to next term:9 +6=15.\n\nMultiply15 by1=15, add to next term: -1 +15=14.\n\nMultiply14 by1=14, add to next term: -14 +14=0. So, remainder is zero, as expected.\n\nSo, the polynomial after division by (x-1) is \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\).\n\nNow, let's factor this cubic. Looking for rational roots again, possible roots are factors of 14, so \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\).\n\nTesting x=1: 1 +6 +15 +14=36\u22600.\n\nx=-1: -1 +6 -15 +14=4\u22600.\n\nx=2: 8 +24 +30 +14=76\u22600.\n\nx=-2: -8 +24 -30 +14=0.\n\nYes, x=-2 is a root of the cubic. So divide the cubic \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\) by (x +2).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients:1, 6, 15,14.\n\nRoot x=-2:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2, add to "
