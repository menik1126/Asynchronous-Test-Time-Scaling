            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: find all the integer roots of the polynomial equation \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). Hmm, I remember that integer roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients must satisfy the Rational Root Theorem. Let me recall what that is. The Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at the given polynomial, the leading coefficient is 1 on \\(x^4\\). Since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible values of \\(q\\) are just \u00b11. That means all possible rational roots are integers that divide the constant term, which here is -14. So, the possible integer roots are the factors of -14. Let me list them out: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114. Those are the possible candidates.\n\nAlright, so I need to test these values one by one by plugging them into the polynomial and seeing if the result is zero. Let me start with the smaller numbers first since they are easier to compute.\n\nFirst, let's test \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1 + 5) + (9 - 1) - 14 = 6 + 8 - 14 = 14 - 14 = 0\\). Oh, wow, \\(x = 1\\) is a root! Nice, that's one down.\n\nNext, \\(x = -1\\):\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14\\). Let's compute step by step:\n1 - 5 = -4\n-4 + 9 = 5\n5 + 1 = 6\n6 - 14 = -8. Not zero, so -1 is not a root.\n\nMoving on to \\(x = 2\\):\n\\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2"

Oh! \\(x = -2\\) is also a root.\n\nAlright, so far we have x=1 and x=-2 as roots. That's two roots. Since it's a quartic equation, there should be four roots in total, but they can be real or complex. But we are only asked for integer roots, so maybe there are only two.\n\nBut let me check the other possible candidates just to be thorough. Next is \\(x = 7\\). That's a bit bigger, but let's see.\n\nCompute \\(7^4 + 5*7^3 +9*7^2 -7 -14\\). Let's calculate each term step by step:\n\n7^4 = 7*7*7*7 = 49*49 = 2401\n5*7^3: 7^3 = 343, so 5*343 = 1715\n9*7^2: 7^2=49, so 9*49=441\nNow, the negative terms: -7 -14 = -21\n\nAdding them all up:\n2401 + 1715 = 4116\n4116 + 441 = 4557\n4557 -21 = 4536.

Not zero, so -7 is not a root.\n\nNext, \\(x=14\\). That's a big number, but let me compute it just in case.\n\n\\(14^4 +5*14^3 +9*14^2 -14 -14\\).\n\n14^4: 14*14=196, 196*14=2744, 2744*14=38416\n5*14^3: 14^3=2744, 5*2744=13720\n9*14^2: 14^2=196, 9*196=1764\nNegative terms: -14 -14 = -28.\n\nAdding all together:\n38416 +13720 = 52136\n52136 +1764 = 538, wait 52136 +1764. Let's compute: 52136 + 1000=53136, plus 764=538, so 53800? Wait, 1764 is 1000 + 700 + 64. So, 52136 +1000=53136, 53136 +700=53836, 53836 +64=53900.\n\nSo now, 53900 -28 =53872. Definitely not zero.\n\nSimilarly, \\(x=-14\\) is going to be a massive number. Let me just check:\n\n\\((-14)^4 +5*(-14)^3 +9*(-14)^2 -(-14) -14\\).\n\nCalculates to:\n14^4 +5*(-14)^3 +9*(14)^2 +14 -14.\n\nFirst, (-14)^3 is -2744, so 5*(-2744)=-13720.\n\n14^4=38416, 9*14\u00b2=1764.\n\nSo 38416 -13720 +1764 +14 -14.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n38416 -13720 = 247, 38416-10000=284"

Not zero.\n\nSo, both 14 and -14 are not roots.\n\nSo, the only integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nWait, but the question is to find all integer roots, so I should present both 1 and -2.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I made an arithmetic mistake when testing x=2 or x=-2.\n\nWait, let me double-check x=2:\n\n2^4=16, 5*(2)^3=5*8=40, 9*(2)^2=9*4=36, then -2 -14= -16.\n\nAdding up: 16 +40=56, 56+36=92, 92-16=76.

Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 1 and -2 are the integer roots.\n\nBut wait, is that all? Since it's a quartic equation, it can have up to four roots, but it's possible that other roots are not integers. Since we have found two roots, 1 and -2, perhaps we can factor the polynomial using these roots and see if the remaining quadratic can be factored more.\n\nLet me try that. If 1 and -2 are roots, then (x -1)(x +2) are factors of the polynomial. Let me perform polynomial division to factor out (x -1) and (x +2) from the quartic.\n\nAlternatively, since we found two roots, the polynomial can be expressed as (x -1)(x +2)(quadratic). Let me try to perform the polynomial division step by step.\n\nFirst, let's divide the polynomial by (x -1). Using synthetic division:\n\nSet up the coefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nUsing x"

Perfect, so the result is x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14.\n\nSo now, the polynomial factors as (x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic polynomial x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14. Let's try to find another integer root here. Again, possible roots are factors of 14 divided by 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nTesting x = -2 again (since maybe it's a double root?):\n\nPlugging into cubic: (-2)^3 +6*(-2)^2 +15*(-2) +14.\n\nCalculates to: -8 +6*4 + (-30) +14.\n\n-8 +24 =16, 16 -30 = -14, -14 +14=0.
