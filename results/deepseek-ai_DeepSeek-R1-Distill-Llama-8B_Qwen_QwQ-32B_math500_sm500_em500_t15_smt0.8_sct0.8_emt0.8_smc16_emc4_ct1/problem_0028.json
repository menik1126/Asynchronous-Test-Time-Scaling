            "output": "To solve |(1 - i)^8|, I'll start by understanding the complex number (1 - i).\n\nI remember that complex numbers can be represented in polar form, which makes exponentiation easier. The polar form of a complex number a + bi is r(cos\u03b8 + isin\u03b8), where r is the magnitude and \u03b8 is the argument.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the magnitude of (1 - i). The magnitude r is found using the formula r = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Plugging in the values, r = \u221a(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = \u221a2.\n\nNext, I'll determine the argument \u03b8. Since the complex number is in the fourth quadrant (real part positive and imaginary part negative), the argument is \u03b8 = -\u03c0/4 or 7\u03c0/4. Using radians, \u03b8 = -\u03c0/4.\n\nNow, I'll express (1 - i) in polar form: \u221a2 (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)). \n\nWhen raising a complex number in polar form to the 8th power, I raise the magnitude to the 8th power and multiply the argument by 8. So, (\u221a2)^8 = (2^(1/2))^8 = 2^(4) = 16.\n\nMultiplying the argument: 8 * (-\u03c0/4) = -2\u03c0. Since angles are periodic with period 2\u03c0, -2\u03c0 is equivalent to 0.\n\nTherefore, (1 - i)^8 results in 16 (cos0 + i sin0) = 16.\n\nThe magnitude |(1 - i)^8| is the absolute value of this complex number, which is 16.\n</think>\n\nRiproarin' Ringo needs to calculate \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\) to determine how much he needs to ride after the dogie. Let's break this down step by step.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Complex Number:**\n   - We have the complex number \\( 1 - i \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit with the property \\( i^2 = -1 \\).\n\n2. **Convert to Polar Form:**\n   - A complex number \\( a + bi \\) can be expressed in polar form as \\( r(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta"
