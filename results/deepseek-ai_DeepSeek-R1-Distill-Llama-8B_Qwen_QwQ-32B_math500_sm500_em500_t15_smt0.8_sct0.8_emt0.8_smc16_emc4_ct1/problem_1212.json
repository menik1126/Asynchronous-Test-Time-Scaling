The direction vector is provided as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the direction vector of a line is determined by two points that lie on the line. In the Asymptote code, there are two points A and B given: A is (-5,4) and B is (-1,3). So, if I can find the slope of the line using these two points, I can relate it to the direction vector.\n\nRight, the slope of a line is calculated as (change in y)/(change in x). So, let me calculate that. The x-coordinates of A and B are -5 and -1, respectively. The y-coordinates are 4 and 3. So, the change in y is 3 - 4, which is -1. The change in x is -1 - (-5), which is -1 + 5, so that's 4. Therefore, the slope is (-1)/4, which is -1/4.\n\nWait, but the direction vector is given as (-7, b). The slope is also equal to the rise over run, which in the case of the direction vector is b / (-7). So, the slope of the line is equal to the slope calculated from points A and B, which is -1/4. Therefore, I can set up an equation: b / (-7) = -1/4.\n\nHmm, solving for b, I can cross-multiply. So, b = (-7) * (-1/4). That would be 7/4. So, b is 7/4.\n\nLet me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Calculated the slope between A and B: (3 - 4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4. Then, the direction vector is given as (-7, b), so the slope should be b / (-7) = -1/4. Solving for b gives b = (-7) * (-1/4) = 7/4. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any errors here.

The slope is rise over run, so that's the y-component divided by the x-component, which must equal the slope between points A and B. Therefore, the value of b should be 7/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4}}\n</think>\n\nThe line is parameterized with a direction vector of the form \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\). To find \\(b\\), we first determine the slope of the line using points \\(A(-5, 4)\\) and \\(B(-1, 3)\\). \n\nThe change in \\(y\\) is \\(3 - 4 = -1\\), and the change in \\(x\\) is \\(-1 - (-5) = 4\\). The slope of the line is therefore:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{-1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThe direction vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\) must have the same slope. The slope of the direction vector is given by the ratio \\(\\frac{b}{-7}\\). Setting this equal to the calculated slope:\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{-7} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(b\\):\n\\[\nb = -7 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{7}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(b\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4}}\\)."
