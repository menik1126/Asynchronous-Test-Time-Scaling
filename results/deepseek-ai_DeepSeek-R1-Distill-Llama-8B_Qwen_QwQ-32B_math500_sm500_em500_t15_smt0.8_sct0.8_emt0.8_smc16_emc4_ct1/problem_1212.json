The graph is provided as an Asymptote figure, which I can sort of visualize, but I don't have the exact image. However, I can infer some information from the Asymptote code.\n\nFirst, let me parse the Asymptote code to understand the setup. The axes are drawn with unitsize(0.4 cm), which probably affects the scaling but isn't critical for solving the problem. The grid is created with loops that range from -8 to 8, so the x and y axes range from -8 to 8. The Asymptote code then draws the x-axis and y-axis with arrows, indicating that the lines extend beyond the drawn parts.\n\nPoints A and B are defined as \\( A = (-5,4) \\) and \\( B = (-1,3) \\). Then, points L and R are found using the extension function, which likely finds the intersection points of the line AB with the vertical lines \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\). The line AB is drawn in red, and labels for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are added.\n\nGiven that the direction vector of the line AB is in the form \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), I need to find \\( b \\). The direction vector of a line is typically found by subtracting the coordinates of two points on the line. Since points A and B lie on the line, the direction vector can be calculated as \\( B - A \\) or \\( A - B \\).\n\nLet me compute that. Point A is (-5,4) and point B is (-1,3). So subtracting A from B:\n\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-5) \\\\ 3 - 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 + 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nWait, but the direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}"

That might mean that either the direction vector is scaled by some factor, or perhaps I have the direction vector in the opposite direction. Let me see.\n\nDirection vectors can be scaled and still represent the same line direction. So the direction vector between A and B is \\( \\begin{pmatrix}4 \\\\ -1\\end{pmatrix} \\), but the problem states that the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix}-7 \\\\ b\\end{pmatrix} \\). These two vectors should be scalar multiples of each other because they are direction vectors of the same line.\n\nSo, let me denote \\( \\begin{pmatrix}4 \\\\ -1\\end{pmatrix} = k \\times \\begin{pmatrix}-7 \\\\ b\\end{pmatrix} \\), where \\( k \\) is some scalar.\n\nAlternatively, it could be the other way around, but let's see. Let me check both possibilities.\n\nSuppose \\( \\begin{pmatrix}-7 \\\\ b\\end{pmatrix} = m \\times \\begin{pmatrix}4 \\\\ -1\\end{pmatrix} \\), where \\( m \\) is a scalar. Then, -7 = 4m, so m = -7/4. Then, the second component would be \\( b = m \\times (-1) = (-7/4)(-1) = 7/4. \\)\n\nAlternatively, if it's the other way, then \\( 4 = k*(-7) \\), so k = -4/7. Then the second component would be -1 = k*b => -1 = (-4/7)*b => b = (-1)*( -7/4 ) = 7/4. Wait, the value of b is the same in both cases.\n\nHmm, so in either case, whether I set the direction vectors to be scalar multiples in either direction, the value of \\( b \\) comes out as 7/4. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let's verify again step by step.\n\nFirst direction vector from A to B is [4, -1]. The problem states the direction vector is [-7, b]. Since direction vectors can be scaled, there must exist a scalar \\( k \\) such that:\n\n-7 = 4k,\n\nand\n\nb = -1*k.\n\nSo from the first equation, k = -7/4"

            "output": ". Then plug that into the second equation, b = -1 * (-7/4) = 7/4.\n\nTherefore, \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nAlternatively, if you take the vector from B to A, which is (-4, 1), then scaling that to get [-7, b], we have:\n\n-7 = (-4)*k,\n\nso k = 7/4.\n\nThen, b = 1*k = 7/4.\n\nEither way, \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nWait, but let me also think about the Asymptote code. The line is drawn as L to R, where L is the extension of line AB with x from -8 to some value, and R is from x=8. But perhaps the direction vector is from L to R, which might be in the direction of the line from left to right.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, L is defined as extension(A,B, (-8,0), (-8,1)), meaning it's the intersection point on x=-8. Similarly, R is the intersection on x=8.\n\nSo perhaps the direction vector is from L to R, which is from x=-8 to x=8 on the line AB.\n\nSo, let me compute the coordinates of L and R.\n\nPoint A is (-5,4), point B is (-1,3). The equation of line AB can be found.\n\nFirst, compute the slope \\( m \\).\n\nSlope \\( m = (3 - 4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4.\n\nSo the equation of the line AB is \\( y - 4 = (-1/4)(x + 5) \\).\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( y = (-1/4)x - (5/4) + 4 \\)\n\n\\( y = (-1/4)x + ( -5/4 + 16/4 ) \\)\n\n\\( y = (-1/4)x + 11/4 \\).\n\nSo the equation is \\( y = (-1/4)x + 11/4 \\).\n\nNow, let me find the intersection point L on x=-8.\n\nSubstitute x = -8 into the equation:\n\n\\( y = (-1/4)*(-8) + 11/4 = 2 + 11/4 = (8/4 + 11/4) = "

So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, scaling by k=-7/4 from (-4,1) would give us:\n\n(-4)*(-7/4) = 7,\n\n1*(-7/4) = -7/4,\n\nWait, that gives (7, -7/4), which is not the same as (-7, 7/4), unless we perhaps take the negative.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of vector direction, regardless of magnitude.\n\nSo since the direction vector is given as (-7, b), and our possible direction vectors from L to R is (16, -4) or (-16,4). So, to see if these are scalar multiples.\n\nIf I take (16, -4), does there exists a scalar m such that 16 = m*(-7) and -4 = m*b.\n\nFrom 16 = -7m, m = -16/7,\n\nthen, -4 = (-16/7)*b,\n\nso, b = (-4)*(-7/16) = 28/16 = 7/4.\n\nAlternatively, using (-16,4):\n\nIf (-16,4) = scalar multiple (-7, b).\n\nSo,\n\n-16 = (-7)*k,\n\n4 = b*k,\n\nFrom the first equation, k = 16/7,\n\nthen, 4 = b*(16/7) => b = 4*(7/16) = 28/16 = 7/4.\n\nIn both cases, b is 7/4.\n\nTherefore, \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nWait, let me just cross-verify this.

So, for a run of -7 (since the direction vector's x-component is -7), the rise would be slope * run = (-1/4)*(-7) = 7/4. Therefore, the direction vector is (-7, 7/4), so b is 7/4.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it. The slope is (change in y)/(change in x). Since the direction vector is (Δx, Δy), so slope = Δy / Δx. Here, the direction vector is given as (-7, b), so slope = b / (-7). But the slope of the line is -1/4, so:\n\nb / (-7) = -1/4,\n\nso solving for b:\n\nb = (-7)*(-1/4) = 7/4.\n\nThat's straightforward.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe problem gives a line parameterized with direction vector (-7, b). The line passes through points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3). The direction vector between A and B is (4, -1). Since direction vectors can be scaled, we set (4, -1) proportional to (-7, b). The proportionality constant is found by equating components, leading to b = 7/4. Alternatively, using the slope, which is -1/4, and setting the slope equal to b / (-7), we get the same result.
