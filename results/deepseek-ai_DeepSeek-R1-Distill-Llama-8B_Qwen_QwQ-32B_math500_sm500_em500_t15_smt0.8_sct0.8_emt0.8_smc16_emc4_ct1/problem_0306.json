            "output": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the function given is f(x) = (2x)/(x² -5x -14). We need to find the vertical asymptotes x=a and x=b, the horizontal asymptote y=c, and then compute a + b + c.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero and the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, let's factor the denominator to find those x-values.\n\nThe denominator is x² -5x -14. To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, let me think: 2 and -7? Because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. So, it factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nNext, horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. Both the numerator and denominator are degree 2 here. The rules are:\n\n- If the degree of numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y=0.\n- If they are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nIn this case, both are degree 2, so the horizontal asymptote will be the ratio of the leading coefficients. The numerator's leading term is 2x, and the denominator's leading term is x². So, the ratio is 2x / x² = 2/x. But as x approaches infinity, 2/x approaches 0. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nNo, wait. When the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. So, f(x) = (2x)/(x² -5x -14) behaves like (2x)/(x²) = 2/x as x approaches infinity. But as x goes to infinity, 2/x approaches 0. So, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So, c = 0.\n\nWait, but hold on. I think I made a mistake there. Let me double-check. When degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of leading coefficients, which in this case is 2 from"

            "output": " the numerator (coefficient of x) and 1 from the denominator (coefficient of x²). Wait, but the numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Wait, hold on, the numerator is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x², which is degree 2. So actually, the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So that part was correct. So c is 0.\n\nWait, so the initial thought was conflicting because I thought numerator and denominator were both degree 2, but actually, the numerator is degree 1. Let me check again. The numerator is 2x, so degree 1. The denominator is x² -5x -14, which is degree 2. Therefore, the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, so horizontal asymptote is y=0. So c is 0. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x =7, so a and b are -2 and 7. Adding them together: -2 +7 =5. Then adding c which is 0, so total is 5 +0 =5. Therefore, the answer is 5. Wait, but let me confirm again.\n\nWait, the denominator factors to (x +2)(x -7), so the roots are x = -2 and x =7. So vertical asymptotes at those points. So a and b are -2 and 7. So a + b =5. Then c is 0, so total is 5 +0 =5. So the final answer is 5. Hmm, but let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in factoring the denominator. Let me check that again. The denominator is x² -5x -14. Let me compute the discriminant to find the roots. The quadratic equation is x² -5x -14 =0. The roots are [5 ± sqrt(25 +56)]/2 = [5 ± sqrt(81)]/2 = [5 ±9]/2. So (5+9)/2 =14/2=7, and (5-9)/2 =-4/2 =-2. So yes, the roots are indeed"

            "output": " x=7 and x=-2. So that's correct.\n\nAnd since both vertical asymptotes are at these roots, that's where x approaches those values, making the function go to infinity.\n\nFor horizontal asymptote, since numerator's degree is less than denominator's, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. So c=0.\n\nSo adding a +b +c: (-2) +7 +0=5. So the final answer is 5.\n\nWait, but wait, I just thought, the function f(x) is 2x/(x² -5x -14). Let me try to divide numerator and denominator by x to see. So f(x) = (2/x)/((x² -5x -14)/x) = (2/x)/(x -5 -14/x). As x approaches infinity, 14/x approaches 0, so denominator becomes x -5. So f(x) behaves like 2/x / (x -5) which goes to 0 as x approaches infinity. So horizontal asymptote is y=0, correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the numerator and denominator were both degree 2, like in the case of 2x²/(x² -5x -14), then the horizontal asymptote would be 2/(1) =2. But in this case, numerator is degree 1, so horizontal asymptote is y=0.\n\nSo everything checks out. Therefore, a + b + c is (-2) + 7 +0=5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the vertical asymptotes and horizontal asymptote of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\):\n\n1. **Vertical Asymptotes**:\n   - The denominator \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\) factors to \\( (x + 2)(x - 7) \\).\n   - Setting each factor equal to zero gives the vertical asymptotes at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n   - Thus, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Horizontal Asymptote**:\n   - The degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2).\n   - Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\).\n   - Hence, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\n3"
