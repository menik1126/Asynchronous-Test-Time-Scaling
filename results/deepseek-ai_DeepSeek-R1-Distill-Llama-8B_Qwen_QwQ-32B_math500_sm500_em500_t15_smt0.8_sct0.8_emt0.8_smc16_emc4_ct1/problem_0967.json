Therefore, the initial ratio can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nUnder the new policy, Denali's pay ratio to Nate's pay can be affected in two scenarios. The first scenario is if Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs while Nate stays at 12 dogs. In this case, Denali would be walking:\n\n\\[\n16 + 4x\n\\]\n\ndogs, and Nate would still be walking 12 dogs. The new ratio \\( R_1 \\) is then:\n\n\\[\nR_1 = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12}\n\\]\n\nThe second scenario is if \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. After the reassignment, Denali would be walking:\n\n\\[\n16 + x\n\\]\n\ndogs, and Nate would be walking:\n\n\\[\n12 - x\n\\]\n\nThe new ratio \\( R_2 \\) in this case is:\n\n\\[\nR_2 = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nSince both ratios are required to maintain the same proportion \\( R = \\frac{4}{3} \\), we can set up the following equations:\n\n1. From the first scenario:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\nMultiply both sides by 12:\n\n\\[\n16 + 4x = 16\n\\]\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n4x = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies \\( x = 0 \\), but the problem states \\( x \\neq 0 \\). Therefore, this scenario doesn't provide a valid solution.\n\n2. From the second scenario:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions:\n\n\\[\n3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n48 + 3x = 48 - 4x\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[\n7x = 0\n\\]\n\nAgain,"
