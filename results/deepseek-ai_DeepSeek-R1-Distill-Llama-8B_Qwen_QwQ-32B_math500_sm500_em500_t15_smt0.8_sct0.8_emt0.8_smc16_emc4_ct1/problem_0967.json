Denali has 16 dogs, and Nate has 12 dogs.\n\nUnder the new policy, Denali and Nate can be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of x dogs. We need to find the value of x that satisfies the given conditions.\n\n**Condition 1:** If Denali starts walking 4x more dogs and Nate stays at 12 dogs, the ratio of their pays should remain the same.\n\nLet's calculate the new number of dogs each will walk:\n- Denali: 16 + 4x\n- Nate: 12 dogs\n\nSince the ratio of their pays is the same as the initial ratio, we can set up the equation:\n(16 + 4x) / 12 = 16 / 12\n\nSimplifying this equation will help us find x.\n\n**Condition 2:** If x of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, the ratio of their pays should also remain the same.\n\nLet's calculate the new number of dogs each will walk after reassignment:\n- Denali: 16 + x\n- Nate: 12 - x\n\nAgain, setting up the equation:\n(16 + x) / (12 - x) = 16 / 12\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. (16 + 4x) / 12 = 16 / 12\n2. (16 + x) / (12 - x) = 16 / 12\n\nBy solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the value of x that satisfies both conditions.\n\nAfter solving, we find that x = 4 satisfies both equations.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks **16** dogs initially.\n- Nate walks **12** dogs initially.\n- Under the new policy, dogs are assigned or unassigned in **groups of \\( x \\)** dogs.\n- Two conditions must hold true for the pay ratio to remain the same.\n\n**Condition 1:** If Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs and Nate stays at **12**, the pay ratio remains unchanged.\n\n**Condition 2:** If \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, the pay ratio also remains unchanged.\n\n**Let's denote:**\n- \\( D_1 = 16 + 4x \\) (Denali's dogs after \\( "

Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
