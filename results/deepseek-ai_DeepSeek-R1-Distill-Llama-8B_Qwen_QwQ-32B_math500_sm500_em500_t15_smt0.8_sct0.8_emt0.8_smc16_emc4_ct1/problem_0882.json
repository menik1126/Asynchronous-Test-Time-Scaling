The prime factors of 160 are 2 raised to the 5th power.\n\nNext, I'll express the fraction in its simplest form by reducing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which in this case is 1. Since 57 and 160 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nNow, I'll convert the denominator to a power of 10 by multiplying it by 5 to get 800, which is 10^3.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to maintain the value of the fraction. This gives me 285/800.\n\nSince 800 is a power of 10, the decimal representation of this fraction will terminate.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is \\(160\\).\n   - Factorizing \\(160\\):\n     \\[\n     160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n     \\]\n   - For a fraction to be a terminating decimal, the denominator must be of the form \\(2^n \\times 5^m\\) after simplifying the fraction.\n\n2. **Check for Simplifiable Fractions:**\n   - Determine if the numerator and denominator have any common factors.\n   - The numerator is \\(57\\).\n   - Prime factors of \\(57\\): \\(3 \\times 19\\).\n   - Since \\(57\\) shares no common factors with \\(160\\) other than \\(1\\), the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Adjust the Denominator to a Power of 10:**\n   - The denominator \\(160\\) can be expressed as \\(2^5 \\times 5^1\\).\n   - To convert it to a power of \\(10\\), we need equal powers of \\(2\\) and \\(5\\).\n   - Multiply both numerator and denominator by \\(5\\) to make the denominator a power of \\(10\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57 \\times 5}{160 \\times 5} = \\frac{285}{800}\n     \\]\n   -"
