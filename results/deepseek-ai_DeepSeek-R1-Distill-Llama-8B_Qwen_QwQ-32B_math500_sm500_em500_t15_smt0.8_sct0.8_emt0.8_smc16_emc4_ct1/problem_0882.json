            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) into a terminating decimal, I first need to determine whether the denominator has prime factors other than 2 and 5. \n\nI'll start by factoring 160. Breaking it down, 160 can be expressed as \\(2^5 \\times 5\\). There are no other prime factors in the denominator, which means the fraction is already in its simplest form with only 2 and 5 as prime factors.\n\nSince the denominator only contains 2 and 5 as prime factors, the fraction will convert to a terminating decimal. \n\nNext, I'll divide the numerator by the denominator to find the decimal equivalent. Performing the division of 57 by 160 yields 0.35625. This is a terminating decimal because the denominator only has 2 and 5 as its prime factors.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of Denominator:**\n   - First, factorize the denominator to check if it contains only prime factors 2 and 5.\n   - \\(160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^5 \\times 5\\)\n\n2. **Determine Decimal Representation:**\n   - Since the denominator factors into only 2 and 5, the fraction will convert to a terminating decimal.\n   - Perform the division \\(57 \\div 160\\).\n   - \\(57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\\)\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   - The decimal representation of \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) is \\(\\boxed{0.35625}\\)."
