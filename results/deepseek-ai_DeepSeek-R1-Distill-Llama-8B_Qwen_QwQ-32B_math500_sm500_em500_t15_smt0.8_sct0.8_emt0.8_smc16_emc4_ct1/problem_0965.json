            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about Denali and Nate's dog walking business. Let me try to understand what's going on. \n\nFirst, Denali is responsible for 16 dogs and Nate is responsible for 12 dogs. The company has a new policy where they can assign or unassign new dogs in groups of x dogs. The key here is that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same in two different scenarios. My goal is to find the value of x, given that x is not zero.\n\nLet me break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Pay Ratio:**\n   Denali's pay to Nate's pay is in a certain ratio. Let me denote Denali's pay as D and Nate's pay as N. So, the initial ratio is D/N.\n\n2. **Scenario 1: Denali walks 4x more dogs, Nate stays at 12 dogs.**\n   - Denali's new number of dogs: 16 + 4x\n   - Nate's dogs remain at 12\n   - So, the new ratio would be (16 + 4x)/12.\n\n3. **Scenario 2: x dogs of Nate's are reassigned to Denali.**\n   - Denali's new number of dogs: 16 + x\n   - Nate's new number of dogs: 12 - x\n   - The new ratio here is (16 + x)/(12 - x).\n\n4. **Setting the Ratios Equal:**\n   Since the ratio D/N must remain the same in both scenarios, we can set the ratios equal to each other:\n   (16 + 4x)/12 = (16 + x)/(12 - x)\n\n5. **Solving the Equation:**\n   Let's solve this equation step by step.\n\n   First, cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:\n   (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)\n\n   Now, expand both sides.\n\n   Left side:\n   16*12 - 16x + 4x*12 - 4x*x\n   = 192 - 16x + 48x - 4x²\n   = 192 + 32x - 4x²\n\n   Right side:\n   12*16 + 12x\n   = 192 + 12x\n\n   Now, set the equation"

            "output": ":\n   192 + 32x - 4x² = 192 + 12x\n\n6. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   Subtract 192 from both sides:\n   32x - 4x² = 12x\n\n   Bring all terms to one side:\n   32x - 4x² - 12x = 0\n   Simplify like terms:\n   20x - 4x² = 0\n\n   Let me rewrite this:\n   -4x² + 20x = 0\n\n7. **Factor the Equation:**\n   Factor out -4x:\n   -4x(x - 5) = 0\n\n   So, the solutions are x = 0 or x = 5.\n\n   But since x ≠ 0, the solution is x = 5.\n\n8. **Verification:**\n   Let me check if x = 5 works in both scenarios to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n   **Scenario 1:**\n   Denali walks 16 + 4*5 = 16 + 20 = 36 dogs\n   Nate walks 12 dogs\n   Ratio: 36/12 = 3/1\n\n   **Scenario 2:**\n   Denali gets 16 + 5 = 21 dogs\n   Nate loses 5 dogs, so 12 - 5 = 7 dogs\n   Ratio: 21/7 = 3/1\n\n   Both ratios are 3:1, so it checks out.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   So, x is 5.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a calculation error when expanding the left side:\n\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 16*12 - 16x + 4x*12 - 4x^2 = 192 -16x + 48x -4x² = 192 + 32x -4x². Correct.\n\nRight side: 12*(16 + x) = 192 +12x. Correct.\n\nThen, when subtracting 192: 32x -4x² =12x. Then, 32x -12x =4x² ⇒20x=4x² ⇒4x² -20x=0 ⇒4x(x -5)=0. Therefore, x=0 or x=5. So yes,"
