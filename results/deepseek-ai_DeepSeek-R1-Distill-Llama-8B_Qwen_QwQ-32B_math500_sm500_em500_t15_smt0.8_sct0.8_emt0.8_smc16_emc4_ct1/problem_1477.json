            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the cube root of the square root of the square root of 1 over 729. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that 729 is a power of 9, or perhaps 3. Let me check: 9 times 9 is 81, 81 times 9 is 729. So, 729 is 9 to the power of 3, which is (3^2)^3. That simplifies to 3^(2*3) = 3^6. So, 729 is 3^6. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, the expression given is the cube root of the square root of the square root of 1/729. Let me write that out with more parentheses to make it clearer: it's the cube root of (the square root of (the square root of (1/729))).\n\nSo, starting from the inside, I have the square root of (1/729). The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729 is 27, since 27 times 27 is 729. So, that innermost part simplifies to 1/27.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have the square root of 1/27. The square root of 1 is still 1, and the square root of 27 is... hmm, 27 is 3^3, so its square root is 3^(3/2) which is 3*sqrt(3). So, the square root of 1/27 is 1/(3*sqrt(3)).\n\nBut wait, the denominator has a square root. I remember that we can rationalize denominators by multiplying numerator and denominator by that radical. So, 1/(3*sqrt(3)) can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(3), resulting in sqrt(3)/(3*3) which is sqrt(3)/9.\n\nOkay, so now we have the square root of 1/27 simplifies to sqrt(3)/9.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have the cube root of sqrt(3)/9. Let's write that as the cube root of (sqrt(3)/9). I need to simplify this.\n\nFirst, let's think about sqrt(3)."

            "output": " That's 3^(1/2). And 9 is 3^2. So, sqrt(3)/9 is 3^(1/2) divided by 3^2, which is 3^(1/2 - 2) = 3^(-3/2). So, the expression inside the cube root is 3^(-3/2).\n\nTaking the cube root of that would be the same as raising it to the 1/3 power. So, (3^(-3/2))^(1/3) = 3^(-3/2 * 1/3) = 3^(-1/2). \n\nHmm, 3^(-1/2) is the same as 1 over 3^(1/2), which is 1/sqrt(3). But the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator. So, I need to rationalize 1/sqrt(3). \n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(3), we get sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with the original expression: sqrt( cube root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). Wait, actually, hold on. Wait, the original problem is sqrt{ cube root{ sqrt{1/729} } }, right? Let me confirm the order. The question says: sqrt of cube root of sqrt of 1/729. So the order is: first take the square root of 1/729, then take the cube root of that result, then take the square root of that. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the way it's written is sqrt{ cube root{ sqrt{1/729} } }, so the cube root is inside the square root. So the order is: first compute sqrt(1/729), then take the cube root of that, then take the square root of the cube root result. Wait, no, actually, the cube root is inside the square root. Let me parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). So the order is:\n\n1. Start with 1/729.\n\n2."

Then take the square root of that cube root result.\n\nWait, so I get sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ) = sqrt( cube_root(1/27) ) = sqrt(1/3).\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Did I misinterpret the expression?\n\nWait, the original expression is sqrt{ cube_root{ sqrt{1/729} } }, so the operations are nested as follows: cube_root(...) is inside sqrt(...). So, the cube_root is taken first, then the square root is applied to the result of the cube_root. So, order of operations is: innermost is sqrt(1/729) = 1/27. Then, cube_root of that is (1/27)^(1/3). Since 27 is 3^3, cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then, we have sqrt(1/3). So, sqrt(1/3) is equal to 1/sqrt(3), which rationalized is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought about this, I thought that the cube root was inside another square root, but now I realize that's not the case. Let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is sqrt{ cube_root{ sqrt{1/729} } }, which is equivalent to sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). \n\nLet me compute each step:\n\n1. Compute sqrt(1/729): Since sqrt(1) is 1 and sqrt(729) is 27, so sqrt(1/729) = 1/27.\n\n2. Next, compute the cube root of 1/27: The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 27 is 3, so this is 1/3.\n\n3. Finally, take the square root of 1/3: sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/3 after rationalizing.\n\nSo, the result is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, but that conflicts with my initial thought, so I must have misread the expression before.\n\nSo, the key here is the order of operations.

Initially, I thought the cube root was inside another square root, but actually, the cube root is inside the square root. So the correct order is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ), so the cube root is applied after the first square root, then the final square root is applied to the cube root's result. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nLet me confirm this again step by step:\n\n1. Start with 1/729. \n\n2. Take the square root: sqrt(1/729) = 1/27. \n\n3. Take the cube root of that: (1/27)^(1/3) = 1/3. \n\n4. Take the square root of that: sqrt(1/3) = sqrt(3)/3. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express all steps using exponents to see if that helps.

Let me see. Since 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is 3^(-6).\n\nSo, sqrt(1/729) = (3^(-6))^(1/2) = 3^(-3).\n\nThen, cube root of 3^(-3) is (3^(-3))^(1/3) = 3^(-1).\n\nThen, sqrt(3^(-1)) = (3^(-1))^(1/2) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/3^(1/2) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSame result.
