I'll start by addressing the innermost radical, which is the cube root of 1/729.\n\nI know that 729 is 9 cubed, so the cube root of 1/729 is 1/9.\n\nNext, the expression becomes the square root of 1/9. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 9 is 3, so this simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNow, I have the cube root of 1/3. To simplify the cube root, I can express 1/3 as a fraction with a denominator that is a perfect cube. The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 3 remains as is, so it stays as 1/3.\n\nSince there are no further radicals, the simplified expression is 1/3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression and write the result with a rational denominator, we'll follow these steps:\n\n**Given Expression:**\n$$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the innermost radical.**\nFirst, let's focus on the innermost part of the expression: \n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}$$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the square root of 1/729.**\nWe can separate the square root of the fraction:\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{729}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{729}}$$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify \\(\\sqrt{729}\\).**\nWe know that 729 is a perfect square because:\n$$729 = 9^3 = (9^2) \\times 9 = 81 \\times 9$$\nSo,\n$$\\sqrt{729} = \\sqrt{81 \\times 9} = \\sqrt{81} \\times \\sqrt{9} = 9 \\times 3 = 27$$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute back into the expression.**\nNow, replace \\(\\sqrt{729}\\) with 27 in the previous step:\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}$$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back into the original expression.**\nNow, the original"
