            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to combine these square roots and their reciprocals into a single fraction. The expression is √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3. The goal is to write it in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I need to find a + b + c.\n\nHmm, first, I should probably deal with each pair separately. Let me see, √2 and 1/√2 can be combined, and similarly, √3 and 1/√3 can be combined. So, I can tackle each of these pairs one by one.\n\nStarting with √2 + 1/√2. To combine these, I need a common denominator, which would be √2. So, I can rewrite 1/√2 as √2/2. That means √2 is the same as 2√2/2. So adding them together: 2√2/2 + √2/2 = (2√2 + √2)/2. That simplifies to 3√2/2.\n\nOkay, that takes care of the √2 part. Now, moving on to √3 + 1/√3. Similar approach here. 1/√3 can be written as √3/3. So, √3 is √3/1, which is the same as 3√3/3. Adding them together: 3√3/3 + √3/3 = (3√3 + √3)/3. That simplifies to 4√3/3.\n\nNow, the original expression is equal to 3√2/2 + 4√3/3. I need to combine these two fractions. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator is 6.\n\nSo, I can rewrite 3√2/2 as (3√2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = 9√2/6. Similarly, 4√3/3 can be written as (4√3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = 8√3/6.\n\nAdding these together: 9√2/6 + 8√3/6 = (9√2 +"

            "output": " 8√3)/6.\n\nWait a second, so in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Now, I should check if c can be simplified further. Let's see, the numerator is 9√2 + 8√3. Since √2 and √3 are irrational and not related by any rational factor, the coefficients can't be simplified. Also, the denominator 6 can't be simplified further because 9 and 8 are co-prime with 6.\n\nSo, the expression is already in its simplest form. Therefore, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Adding them together: 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with √2 + 1/√2: √2 is approx 1.414, 1/√2 is approx 0.707. Adding them gives about 2.121. 3√2/2 is about 3*1.414/2 ≈ 2.121, which matches. Good.\n\nFor √3 + 1/√3: √3 is approx 1.732, 1/√3 is approx 0.577. Adding them gives about 2.309. 4√3/3 is about 4*1.732/3 ≈ 2.309, which also matches. Good.\n\nThen, adding 3√2/2 (≈2.121) and 4√3/3 (≈2.309), which gives approximately 4.43. Calculating (9√2 + 8√3)/6: 9*1.414≈12.726, 8*1.732≈13.856. Adding these gives 26.582, divided by 6 is ≈4.43. That matches, so my calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the values are a=9, b=8, c=6, so a+b+c=23.\n</think>\n\nTo combine the terms, first simplify each pair:\n\n√2 + 1/√2 = (2√2 + √2)/2 = 3√2/2.\n\n√3 + 1/√3 = (3√3 + √3"
