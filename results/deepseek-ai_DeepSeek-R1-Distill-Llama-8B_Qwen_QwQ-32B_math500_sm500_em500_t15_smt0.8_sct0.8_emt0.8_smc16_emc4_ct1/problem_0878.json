            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to combine these square roots and their reciprocals into a single fraction. The expression is \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. The goal is to write it in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I need to find a + b + c.\n\nHmm, first, I should probably deal with each pair separately. Let me see, \u221a2 and 1/\u221a2 can be combined, and similarly, \u221a3 and 1/\u221a3 can be combined. So, I can tackle each of these pairs one by one.\n\nStarting with \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2. To combine these, I need a common denominator, which would be \u221a2. So, I can rewrite 1/\u221a2 as \u221a2/2. That means \u221a2 is the same as 2\u221a2/2. So adding them together: 2\u221a2/2 + \u221a2/2 = (2\u221a2 + \u221a2)/2. That simplifies to 3\u221a2/2.\n\nOkay, that takes care of the \u221a2 part. Now, moving on to \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. Similar approach here. 1/\u221a3 can be written as \u221a3/3. So, \u221a3 is \u221a3/1, which is the same as 3\u221a3/3. Adding them together: 3\u221a3/3 + \u221a3/3 = (3\u221a3 + \u221a3)/3. That simplifies to 4\u221a3/3.\n\nNow, the original expression is equal to 3\u221a2/2 + 4\u221a3/3. I need to combine these two fractions. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator is 6.\n\nSo, I can rewrite 3\u221a2/2 as (3\u221a2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = 9\u221a2/6. Similarly, 4\u221a3/3 can be written as (4\u221a3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = 8\u221a3/6.\n\nAdding these together: 9\u221a2/6 + 8\u221a3/6 = (9\u221a2 +"

            "output": " 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nWait a second, so in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Now, I should check if c can be simplified further. Let's see, the numerator is 9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3. Since \u221a2 and \u221a3 are irrational and not related by any rational factor, the coefficients can't be simplified. Also, the denominator 6 can't be simplified further because 9 and 8 are co-prime with 6.\n\nSo, the expression is already in its simplest form. Therefore, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Adding them together: 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2: \u221a2 is approx 1.414, 1/\u221a2 is approx 0.707. Adding them gives about 2.121. 3\u221a2/2 is about 3*1.414/2 \u2248 2.121, which matches. Good.\n\nFor \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3: \u221a3 is approx 1.732, 1/\u221a3 is approx 0.577. Adding them gives about 2.309. 4\u221a3/3 is about 4*1.732/3 \u2248 2.309, which also matches. Good.\n\nThen, adding 3\u221a2/2 (\u22482.121) and 4\u221a3/3 (\u22482.309), which gives approximately 4.43. Calculating (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6: 9*1.414\u224812.726, 8*1.732\u224813.856. Adding these gives 26.582, divided by 6 is \u22484.43. That matches, so my calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the values are a=9, b=8, c=6, so a+b+c=23.\n</think>\n\nTo combine the terms, first simplify each pair:\n\n\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 = (2\u221a2 + \u221a2)/2 = 3\u221a2/2.\n\n\u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 = (3\u221a3 + \u221a3"
