The distance between C and D is 140 meters. There's a hot-air balloon at point H above O, held by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. HC is 150 meters and HD is 130 meters. The goal is to replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is somewhere on the line between C and D, to save the maximum length of rope.\n\nHmm, let me visualize this. So, if I imagine a coordinate system with O at the origin, A is north, so that's positive y-axis. B is west, so negative x-axis. C is south, so negative y-axis, and D is east, so positive x-axis.\n\nThe distance between C and D is 140 m. Since C is at (-a, -a) and D is at (a, a), but wait, the distance between C and D would be the straight line between (-a, -a) and (a, a). But actually, wait, is that correct? Let me think.\n\nNo, actually, since C is directly south of O and D is directly east of O, the coordinates of C would be (0, -c) and D would be (d, 0), so the distance between C(0, -c) and D(d, 0) would be sqrt(d^2 + c^2) = 140. But actually, in the problem, the distance between C and D is given as 140 m, so that gives us sqrt((d)^2 + (c)^2) = 140.\n\nBut wait, from the setup, A is directly north of O, meaning A is (0, a) for some a, same for B, C, D being directly west, south, east of O, so B is (-b, 0), C is (0, -c), D is (d, 0). Wait, that might complicate things. Wait, no, in the Asy code given, it seems that A is at (1,1), D at (1.5, -0.3), B at (-1.5, 0.3), C"

Hmm.\n\nBut the problem says, points are directly north, west, south, east. So it's a coordinate system where O is the origin. Let me consider O as (0,0). So point A is along positive y-axis, B along negative x-axis, C along negative y-axis, D along positive x-axis. So coordinates: A (0, a), B (-b, 0), C (0, -c), D (d, 0). All variables a, b, c, d are positive numbers. The distance between C and D is sqrt(d^2 + c^2) = 140. Hmm, okay.\n\nThe balloon H is directly above O, so coordinates of H are (0,0, h) if we consider three dimensions, but maybe the problem is in 2D with H vertically above O so coordinates (0,0) but in 3D with height h? But maybe in the problem, since all ropes are connected from H to the points, which are on the ground, so we can model this as a 2D problem with H at (0,0) and the ground points as in a plane.\n\nWait, maybe better to consider H directly above O, so in coordinates, if O is (0,0), then H would be (0,0, h) in 3D coordinates, but the problem might simplify to using Pythagorean theorem. The lengths of the ropes HA, HB, HC, HD depend on the distances from H to each point.\n\nGiven that HC is 150 m and HD is 130 m. Let's think of H's height as h. The length HC is the distance from H to C, so if C is (0, -c), then the horizontal distance from O to C is c, so HC would be sqrt(c^2 + h^2) = 150. Similarly, HD is sqrt(d^2 + h^2) = 130.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) sqrt(c^2 + h^2) = 150\n\n2) sqrt(d^2 + h^2) = 130\n\nAnd also, from the distance between C and D being 140 meters,"

So, the idea is to find the point P on CD such that the total length of HP is the same as HC + HD, but we can't have HP longer than that, but the problem says to replace them to save rope, so maybe the sum of HC and HD is 150 + 130 = 280 m.\n\nSo, if we can find the minimal length of HP, but the problem says \"greatest length of rope that can be saved.\" Wait, so the maximum possible saving would be the"

Because the maximum possible saving is if HP is as short as possible.\n\nSo, in other words, the minimal possible length of HP is the straight-line distance from H to the line CD. So, the minimal length of HP would be the shortest distance from H to CD, which is the perpendicular distance.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the perpendicular distance from H to the line CD, since that's the minimal length for HP. Thus, the maximum rope saved would be (HC + HD) - (perpendicular distance).\n\nWait, but wait. Is that correct? Let me think.\n\nBecause when you have two points C and D, the shortest path from H to CD is the perpendicular distance. So if P is that foot of the perpendicular, then HP would be minimal. But is that allowed? Because P must lie on the straight line between C and D. So, yes, that is possible.\n\nSo the minimal HP is the perpendicular distance. Therefore, the minimal HP would be the distance from H to the line CD.\n\nSo, to find that distance, let's model this in 2D.\n\nWe have points C at (0, -c) and D at (d, 0). So, the equation of line CD can be found.\n\nWait, so from C(0, -c) to D(d, 0). The slope of CD would be (0 - (-c))/(d - 0) = c/d.\n\nSo, the equation of CD in standard form is y = (c/d)x - c.\n\nBut the general formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is |Ax0 + By0 + C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2).\n\nWait, so let me write the equation of CD in standard form.\n\nFrom the points C(0, -c) and D(d, 0), the line CD can be written as:\n\ny = (c/d)x - c\n\nMultiplying both sides by d:\n\nd y = c x - c d\n\nRearranged: c x - d y - c d = 0\n\nSo, A = c, B = -d, C = -c d\n\nThe point H is"

Wait, perhaps better to model in 3D coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, since all the ropes are vertical plus horizontal, so the distance from H to any point on the ground is sqrt( (horizontal distance)^2 + h^2 )\n\nWait, but in this case, the point P is on CD, so the coordinates of P can be parametrized along CD.

Since H is vertically above O, which is the origin, so coordinates of H are (0,0,h). The line CD is in the ground plane (z=0). The distance from H to the line CD would be the minimal distance between the point (0,0,h) and any point on CD. Since CD is in the z=0 plane, the minimal distance would be sqrt( (perpendicular distance from O to CD)^2 + h^2 )\n\nWait, that might be a better way to think.
