Denali has 16 dogs and Nate has 12 dogs.\n\nThe company's new policy involves assigning or unassigning dogs in groups of \\( x \\) dogs. The key information is that the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same under two different scenarios. \n\nFirst, I'll consider the scenario where Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs while Nate stays at 12 dogs. In this case, Denali's total dogs become \\( 16 + 4x \\) and Nate's remains \\( 12 \\).\n\nNext, I'll examine the second scenario where \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. This changes Denali's total to \\( 16 + x \\) and Nate's total to \\( 12 - x \\).\n\nSince the ratio of their pay remains the same in both scenarios, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), I'll cross-multiply and simplify the equation. This will involve expanding and rearranging terms to isolate \\( x \\). After simplifying, I'll divide both sides by the coefficient of \\( x \\) to find the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali is responsible for \\( 16 \\) dogs.\n- Nate is responsible for \\( 12 \\) dogs.\n- The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same under two different scenarios:\n  1. If Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, and Nate stays at \\( 12 \\) dogs.\n  2. If \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n\n**Let \\( x \\) be the number of dogs in the group used for reassignment.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Set Up the Pay Ratios**\n\n1. **First Scenario:**\n   - Denali walks \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs.\n   - Nate walks \\( 12 \\) dogs.\n   - The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{16 + 4x}{"

Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
