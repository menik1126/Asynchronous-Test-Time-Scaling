            "output": "First, I'll define the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay as \\( R \\).\n\nOriginally, Denali walks 16 dogs and Nate walks 12 dogs. So, \\( R = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nIn the first scenario, Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, making her total dogs \\( 16 + 4x \\), while Nate still walks 12 dogs. The new ratio is \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\). Setting this equal to the original ratio gives \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), I multiply both sides by 12: \\( 16 + 4x = 16 \\). Subtracting 16 from both sides, \\( 4x = 0 \\), so \\( x = 0 \\). However, \\( x \\) must not be zero, so this scenario doesn't work.\n\nIn the second scenario, \\( x \\) dogs are reassigned from Nate to Denali. Denali now walks \\( 16 + x \\) dogs, and Nate walks \\( 12 - x \\) dogs. The ratio becomes \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\). Setting this equal to the original ratio, \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n\nSolving for \\( x \\), I cross-multiply: \\( 3(16 + x) = 4(12 - x) \\). Expanding both sides, \\( 48 + 3x = 48 - 4x \\). Combining like terms, \\( 7x = 0 \\), so \\( x = 0 \\). This also doesn't satisfy \\( x \\neq 0 \\).\n\nSince both scenarios lead to \\( x = 0 \\), and \\( x \\) must not be zero, there is no valid solution for \\( x \\) that satisfies the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks \\(16\\) dogs.\n- Nate walks \\(12\\) dogs.\n- The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is to remain the same under two different scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:** Denali walks \\(4x\\) more dogs, and"

    "question": "Denali and Nate work for a dog walking business and are paid for each dog they walk. Denali is responsible for $16$ dogs and Nate is responsible for $12$ dogs. Under the company's new policy, they will be assigned or unassigned new dogs in groups of $x$ dogs. The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali. Find $x$ if $x\\neq0$.",
