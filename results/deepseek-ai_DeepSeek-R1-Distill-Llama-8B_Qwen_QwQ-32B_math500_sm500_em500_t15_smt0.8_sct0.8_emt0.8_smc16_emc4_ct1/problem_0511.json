            "output": "First, let's identify the total number of students, which is 360.\n\nNext, it's given that 15 students take none of the three subjects: calculus, physics, or chemistry. So, the number of students taking at least one of these subjects is 360 minus 15, which equals 345.\n\nWe know that 180 students take calculus. This includes those who might also be taking physics or chemistry.\n\nIt's also stated that twice as many students take chemistry as take physics. Let's denote the number of students taking physics as P. Therefore, the number of students taking chemistry would be 2P.\n\nAdditionally, 75 students take both calculus and chemistry, and 75 students take both physics and chemistry. However, only 30 students take both physics and calculus.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets, we can set up the equation:\n\nCalculus + Physics + Chemistry - (Students taking both Calculus and Physics + Students taking both Calculus and Chemistry + Students taking both Physics and Chemistry) + Students taking all three = Total students taking at least one subject.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n180 + P + 2P - (30 + 75 + 75) + All three = 345\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n180 + 3P - 180 + All three = 345\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3P + All three = 345\n\nSince the number of students taking all three subjects can't be more than 75 (as only 75 take both physics and chemistry), there's a constraint here. However, based on the equation, it suggests that:\n\n3P = 345 - All three\n\nGiven that All three must be less than or equal to 75, the smallest 3P can be is 270, leading to P being 90.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students in the school: 360\n- Students taking none of the subjects: 15\n- Students taking at least one subject: 360 - 15 = 345\n- Students taking Calculus (C): 180\n- Students taking Physics (P): Let's denote as \\( P \\)\n- Students taking Chemistry (Ch): Given as twice the number of Physics students, so \\( \\text{Ch} = 2P \\)\n- Students taking both Calculus and Chemistry (C ∩"
