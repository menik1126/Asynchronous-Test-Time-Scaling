            "output": "I need to determine how many students take physics in the school. Let's start by defining some variables to represent the different groups of students. Let me denote:\n\n- \\( P \\) = number of students who take physics.\n- \\( C \\) = number of students who take calculus.\n- \\( Ch \\) = number of students who take chemistry.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that 180 students take calculus. So, \\( C = 180 \\).\n\nIt's also mentioned that 15 students take all three subjects: calculus, physics, and chemistry. This means that the number of students taking all three is 15, so \\( P \\cap C \\cap Ch = 15 \\).\n\nTwice as many students take chemistry as take physics. That gives me the relationship:\n\\( Ch = 2P \\).\n\nAdditionally, it's stated that 75 students take both physics and chemistry, and another 75 take both calculus and chemistry. However, I need to be careful here because these numbers could overlap with the students taking all three subjects.\n\nI can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets to find the total number of students taking at least one of the subjects. The formula is:\nTotal = \\( P + C + Ch - (P \\cap C) - (P \\cap Ch) - (C \\cap Ch) + (P \\cap C \\cap Ch) \\).\n\nGiven that 30 students take both physics and calculus, so \\( P \\cap C = 30 \\).\n\nNow, considering the students who take both physics and chemistry (75) and those who take both calculus and chemistry (75), but 15 students are taking all three, I need to adjust for the overlap. So, the actual number of students taking only physics and chemistry is \\( 75 - 15 = 60 \\), and similarly, the number of students taking only calculus and chemistry is \\( 75 - 15 = 60 \\).\n\nSubstituting all the known values into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\nTotal = \\( P + 180 + Ch - 30 - (P + Ch - 15) - (180 + Ch - 15) + 15 \\).\n\nSimplifying this equation will help me find \\( P \\).\n\nAdditionally, since \\( Ch = 2P \\), I can substitute \\( Ch \\) in the equation with \\( 2P \\) to help solve for \\( P \\).\n\nAfter simplifying and solving,"

So subtract 30 +75 +75 = 180.\n\nThen add back the triple overlap (C\u2229P\u2229Ch)=15.\n\nSo total is:\n\n180 + P + Ch"
