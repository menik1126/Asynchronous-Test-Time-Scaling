Since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, I can exclude the number 2 from the list.\n\nThe remaining prime numbers are: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nThere are 9 prime numbers in this list. Therefore, the intersection of the two sets contains 9 elements.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of elements in the intersection of the two sets:\n\n1. **Identify the set of all prime numbers less than 30.**\n2. **Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than zero.**\n3. **Find the common elements (intersection) between these two sets.**\n4. **Count the number of common elements.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n### 1. List of Prime Numbers Less Than 30\nThe prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Here are all prime numbers less than 30:\n\\[\n\\text{Primes less than 30} = \\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Set of All Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero\nAll odd numbers greater than zero are:\n\\[\n\\text{Odd numbers} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, \\dots\\}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Find the Intersection\nThe intersection of the two sets consists of the numbers that are both prime and odd. Since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, we exclude 2 from the prime list:\n\\[\n\\text{Intersection} = \\{3, 5"
