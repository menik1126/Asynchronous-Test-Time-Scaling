These are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll identify which of these primes are also odd numbers. Since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, the relevant primes are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 prime numbers less than 30 that are also odd numbers greater than zero.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Set of Prime Numbers Less Than 30:**\n   \n   The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n   \\[\n   \\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify the Set of Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero:**\n   \n   The odd numbers greater than zero are all integers greater than zero that are not divisible by 2. This set includes:\n   \\[\n   \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, \\dots\\}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Find the Intersection of the Two Sets:**\n   \n   The intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd. Notably:\n   - The number 2 is a prime number but not odd.\n   - All other prime numbers (greater than 2) are odd.\n   \n   Therefore, the intersection set is:\n   \\[\n   \\{3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Count the Elements in the Intersection:**\n   \n   Counting the elements in the intersection:\n   \\[\n   3, 5, 7, 11, "
