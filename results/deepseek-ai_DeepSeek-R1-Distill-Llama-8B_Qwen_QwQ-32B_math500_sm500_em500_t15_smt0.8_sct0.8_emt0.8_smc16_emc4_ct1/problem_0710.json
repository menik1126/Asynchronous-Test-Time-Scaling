            "output": "I need to determine how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola defined by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has.\n\nFirst, I recall that the y-intercept of a graph occurs where it crosses the y-axis. At the y-axis, the value of \\( x \\) is 0. So, I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\) in the given equation.\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation gives:\n\\( 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\).\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\): \\( y^2 - 4y - 1 = 0 \\). To find the number of real solutions, I'll calculate the discriminant using the quadratic formula discriminant formula \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\( D = (-4)^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-1) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\).\n\nSince the discriminant \\( D \\) is positive (\\( 20 > 0 \\)), there are two distinct real roots. This means the parabola will cross the y-axis at two different points.\n\nTherefore, the graph of the parabola \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts for the given parabola.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Equation**\n\nThe equation is:\n\\[\nx = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\), which means it forms a parabola that opens either to the right or to the left.\n\n**Step 2: Find the \\( y \\)-Intercepts**\n\nA \\( y \\)-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the \\( y \\)-axis. At the \\( y \\)-axis, the value of \\( x \\) is 0.\n\nSet \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation:\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\( y \\).\n\n**Step 3:"
