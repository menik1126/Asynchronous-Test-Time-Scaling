            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many y-intercepts does the graph of the parabola x = y² - 4y - 1 have?\" Hmm, I'm trying to remember what a y-intercept is. If I recall correctly, a y-intercept is a point where the graph crosses the y-axis. And on the y-axis, the value of x is always 0. So, to find the y-intercepts, I need to find all the points where x is 0 and see if those points exist on the graph.\n\nAlright, so let me set x equal to 0 because that's where the y-axis is. So, 0 = y² - 4y - 1. That gives me a quadratic equation in terms of y. Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation to find the y-values where the graph crosses the y-axis.\n\nQuadratic equations are usually in the form ay² + by + c = 0, so here, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -1. I can use the quadratic formula to solve for y, which is (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a). Plugging in the values: b is -4, so -b would be 4. Then, b squared is (-4)² = 16. The discriminant is b² - 4ac, so that's 16 - 4*(1)*(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20. So the discriminant is 20, which is positive, meaning there are two real solutions.\n\nSo, the solutions would be (4 ± √20)/2. Let me simplify √20. Since √20 is √(4*5) = 2√5, so that becomes (4 ± 2√5)/2. Then, dividing numerator terms by 2, we get 2 ± √5. So the two y-values where the graph crosses the y-axis are y = 2 + √5 and y = 2 - √5.\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of y-intercepts. So, in this case, since we have two distinct real solutions, that means the graph crosses the y-axis at two different points. Therefore, there are two y-intercepts.\n\nLet me just double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So"

            "output": " starting again, set x=0 in the equation x = y² -4y -1, so 0 = y² -4y -1. The quadratic equation coefficients are correct. The discriminant calculation: (-4)^2 is 16, 4ac is 4*1*(-1) = -4, so 16 - (4*1*(-1)) would be 16 +4 = 20. That's right. So discriminant is positive, so two real roots. Therefore, two y-intercepts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the equation as a parabola. Since the equation is given in terms of x equals a quadratic in y, this is a parabola that opens either to the right or to the left. The standard form for such a parabola is x = a(y - k)^2 + h. Let me see if I can rewrite the given equation in that form.\n\nStarting with x = y² -4y -1. Let's complete the square for the y terms. The coefficient of y is -4, so half of that is -2, square it is 4. So, add and subtract 4:\n\nx = (y² -4y +4) -4 -1  \nx = (y - 2)^2 -5\n\nSo the equation is x = (y - 2)^2 -5. Comparing to standard form x = a(y - k)^2 + h, here the vertex is at (h, k) which would be (-5, 2). Since the coefficient a is positive (1), the parabola opens to the right. \n\nNow, to find the y-intercepts, we set x=0 and solve for y, which we did earlier. Since the vertex is at (-5, 2), which is to the left of the y-axis (since x is -5), and the parabola opens to the right, it should cross the y-axis (x=0) at two points. That makes sense because the parabola is opening towards the positive x-direction, so starting from the vertex on the left, it would go through the y-axis twice. \n\nAlternatively, if the vertex was on the right side of the y-axis and opening to the right, it might only cross once or not at all, but in this case, since it's opening towards the right"

Therefore, the answer should be 2 y-intercepts.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when a parabola is vertical, like y = f(x), the y-intercepts are the x's where y=0, but in this case, the equation is x = f(y), so the y-intercepts are the points (0, y). So, if we're solving for y when x=0, which we have two solutions, so that would be two points on the graph where x=0, which are (0, 2 + √5) and (0, 2 - √5). So yes, two y-intercepts.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the number should be two.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of y-intercepts of the parabola given by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), we set \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nStarting with the equation:\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\) where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).
