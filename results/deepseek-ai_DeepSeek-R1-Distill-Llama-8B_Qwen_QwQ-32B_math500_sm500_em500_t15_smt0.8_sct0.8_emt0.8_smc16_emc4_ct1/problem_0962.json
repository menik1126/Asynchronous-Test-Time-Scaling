Denali is responsible for 16 dogs, and Nate is responsible for 12 dogs.\n\nNext, let's define the variables. Let \\( x \\) represent the number of dogs in each group under the company's policy.\n\nUnder the first scenario, Denali starts walking \\( 4x \\) more dogs. This means Denali's new number of dogs becomes \\( 16 + 4x \\). Nate's number of dogs remains unchanged at 12.\n\nIn the second scenario, \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. This results in Denali having \\( 16 + x \\) dogs and Nate having \\( 12 - x \\) dogs.\n\nSince the ratio of their pay remains the same in both scenarios, I can set up the equations:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), I'll first simplify both sides of the equation by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\( (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = (16 + x)(12) \\)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\( 192 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x \\)\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\( -4x^2 + 32x + 192 = 192 + 12x \\)\n\nSubtracting \\( 192 + 12x \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( -4x^2 + 20x = 0 \\)\n\nFactoring out \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x(-4x + 20) = 0 \\)\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero and solving:\n\n\\( x = 0 \\) or \\( -4x + 20 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 5 \\)\n\nSince \\( x \\neq 0 \\), the solution is \\( x = 5 \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali walks **16** dogs.\n- Nate walks **12** dogs.\n- Under the new policy, dogs are assigned or unassigned in groups of **\\(x\\)** dogs.\n- The ratio of Denali"

The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same if Denali started walking $4x$ more dogs and Nate stayed at $12$ dogs or if $x$ of Nate's dogs were reassigned to Denali.
