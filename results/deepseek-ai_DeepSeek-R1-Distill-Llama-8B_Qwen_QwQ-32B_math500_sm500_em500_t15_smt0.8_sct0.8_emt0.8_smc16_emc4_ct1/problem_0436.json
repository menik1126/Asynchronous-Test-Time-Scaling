Solving for \\(n\\) gives \\(n = 100\\). This means there are 100 terms in the series.\n\nNext, I calculate the sum of the series using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n)\\). Substituting the known values, the sum \\(S_{100} = \\frac{100}{2} \\times (1 + 199) = 50 \\times 200 = 10,\\!000\\).\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 7, I compute \\(10,\\!000 \\div 7\\). The quotient is 1428 with a remainder of 4. Therefore, the modulo 7 remainder of the sum is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Series:**\n   - This is an arithmetic series of consecutive odd numbers.\n   - The first term (\\(a_1\\)) is \\(1\\), and the common difference (\\(d\\)) is \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms (\\(n\\)):**\n   - The last term (\\(a_n\\)) is \\(199\\).\n   - Using the formula for the \\(n\\)th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     198 = 2(n - 1)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     99 = n -"
