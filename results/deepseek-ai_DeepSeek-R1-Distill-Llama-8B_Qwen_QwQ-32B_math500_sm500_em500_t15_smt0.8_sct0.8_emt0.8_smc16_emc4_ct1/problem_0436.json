            "output": "First, I recognize that the given series is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.\n\nI can determine the number of terms in the sequence by using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. Here, a_n is 199, a_1 is 1, and d is 2. Plugging in these values, I solve for n, which gives me 100 terms.\n\nNext, I calculate the sum of the series using the arithmetic series sum formula: S = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n). With n = 100, a_1 = 1, and a_n = 199, the sum S is (100/2) * (1 + 199) = 50 * 200 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I perform the division: 10,000 ÷ 7 = 1,428 with a remainder. Calculating 7 * 1,428 = 9,996, and subtracting this from 10,000 gives a remainder of 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Series Type:**\n   - The given series is an **arithmetic series** where each term increases by \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**\n   - Use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n     \\]\n     - Here, \\(a_1 = 1\\), \\(d = 2\\), and \\(a_n = 199\\).\n     - Plugging in the values:\n       \\[\n       199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n       198 = (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n       n - 1 = 99 \\\\\n       n = 100\n       \\]\n   - So, there are **100 terms**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Series:"
