            "output": "First, I need to understand the problem. I need to convert the binary number 10101001110\u2082 into an octal number. \n\nSince octal is base 8, I should divide the binary number into groups of 3 bits from the rightmost bit. Each group of 3 bits will correspond to a single octal digit.\n\nLet me write down the binary number and insert spacing every 3 bits to make grouping easier: 1 010 010 011 10.\n\nNow, I'll convert each 3-bit group to its corresponding octal value:\n- 001 corresponds to 1,\n- 010 corresponds to 2,\n- 011 corresponds to 3,\n- 100 corresponds to 4.\n\nSince the last group has only 2 bits, I need to add a leading zero to make it 010, which is 2 in octal.\n\nFinally, I'll combine all the octal digits: 1 2 3 4 2, resulting in the octal number 12342\u2088.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to an octal number, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between Binary and Octal:**\n   - Octal is base 8, which means it is composed of binary digits grouped into sets of 3 bits. Each 3-bit group corresponds to an octal digit.\n\n2. **Break the Binary Number into Groups of 3 Bits:**\n   ```\n   1 010 010 011 10\n   ```\n   - If there's an uneven number of bits, add leading zeros to complete the last group.\n\n3. **Convert Each 3-Bit Group to Its Octal Equivalent:**\n   - **001:** \\(1_{2} = 1_{8}\\)\n   - **010:** \\(10_{2} = 2_{8}\\)\n   - **011:** \\(11_{2} = 3_{8}\\)\n   - **100:** \\(4_{2} = 4_{8}\\)\n   - **010:** \\(10_{2} = 2_{8}\\)\n\n4. **Combine the Octal Digits:**\n   ```\n   1 2 3 4 2\n   ```\n   - The octal number is \\(12342_{8}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12342_{8}}\n"
