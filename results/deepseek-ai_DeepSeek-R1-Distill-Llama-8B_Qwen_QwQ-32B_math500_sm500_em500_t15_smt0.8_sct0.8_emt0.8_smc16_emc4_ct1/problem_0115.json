First, I'll convert the binary number to decimal (base ten) by expanding each power of two.\n\nStarting from the right, the binary digits represent \\(2^0\\), \\(2^1\\), \\(2^2\\), and so on. I'll multiply each digit by its corresponding power of two and sum all the values.\n\nOnce I have the total in decimal, I'll divide by eight to find the equivalent number in base eight. If the remainder when divided by eight is zero, it means that particular digit is a multiple of eight and can be omitted in the final octal number.\n\nFinally, I'll write the number in base eight, ensuring that each digit is between zero and seven, and omitting any zeros that aren't necessary to represent the number accurately.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to base eight (octal) step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Binary to Octal Conversion\n\nTo convert a binary number to octal, we can use the following method:\n\n1. **Binary to Decimal (Base 10):**  \n   Convert the binary number to its decimal equivalent.\n2. **Decimal to Octal:**  \n   Divide the decimal number by 8 and record the quotients and remainders. Each remainder corresponds to a digit in the octal number.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Binary to Decimal\n\nThe binary number is \\(10101001110_2\\). Let's find its decimal value:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n1 \\times 2^9 & = 512 \\\\\n0 \\times 2^8 & = 0 \\\\\n1 \\times 2^7 & = 128 \\\\\n0 \\times 2^6 & = 0 \\\\\n1 \\times 2^5 & = 32 \\\\\n0 \\times 2^4 & = 0 \\\\\n0 \\times 2^3 & = 0 \\\\\n1 \\times 2^2 & = 4 \\\\\n1 \\times 2^1 & = 2 \\\\\n0 \\times 2^0 & = 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Decimal Value} = 512 + 0 + 128 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 2"

Let's properly group:\n\nOriginal binary:  \n\\(1\\ 010\\ 100\\ 111\\ 0\\) \u2192 Wait, actually, let's split correctly:\n\nStarting from the right:  \n\\(10101001110\\) \u2192 Split into groups of three from the right:  \n\\(10\\ 101\\ 001\\ 110\\). Wait, but this leaves two bits at the start. To fix, pad with a leading zero:  \n\\(010\\ 101\\ 001\\ 110\\). Now each group has three bits:\n\n- \\(010_2 = 2_8\\)\n- \\(10"
