            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under a matrix M. M takes the vector [2, -1] to [9, 3] and [1, -3] to [7, -1]. I'm a bit new to transformations, but I think matrices can represent linear transformations, right? So, first, maybe I should figure out what matrix M is.\n\nLet me recall that if a matrix M transforms a vector v to Mv, then each column of M is the image of the corresponding standard basis vector. The standard basis vectors in 2D are [1, 0] and [0, 1]. So, if I can figure out where [1, 0] and [0, 1] go, then I can construct M.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, I'm given where M sends [2, -1] and [1, -3]. Maybe I can use that information to find M. Let me denote M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nSo, when M acts on [2, -1], it gives [9, 3]. So, according to matrix multiplication:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, when M acts on [1, -3], it gives [7, -1]. So:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nHmm, maybe I can solve for a and b first. Let's take equations 1 and 3. Wait, actually, equations 1 and 3 are both about a and b. So equation 1: 2a - b = 9 and equation 3: a - 3b = 7.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\n2a - b = 9     ...(1)\na - 3b = 7     ...(3)\n\nLet me solve this system. From equation (1), I can express 2a = b + 9, so a ="

Equations 2 and 4:\n\n2c - d = 3 ...(2)\nc - 3d = -1 ...(4)\n\nFrom equation (2): 2c = d + 3, so c = (d + 3)/2.\n\nSubstitute into equation (4):\n\n( (d + 3)/2 ) - 3d = -1\n\nMultiply through by 2:\n\nd + 3 - 6d = -2\n\nSimplify:\n\n-5d + 3 = -2\n-5d = -5\nd = 1\n\nThen, c = (d + 3)/2 = (1 + 3)/2 = 4/2 = 2.\n\nSo, c = 2, d = 1.\n\nThus, the matrix M is:\n\n[4  -1]\n[2   1]\n\nLet me double-check that with the given vectors:\n\nM * [2, -1] = [4*2 + (-1)*(-1)] = [8 + 1] = [9], and [2*2 + 1*(-1)] = [4 -1] = [3]. That's correct.\n\nM * [1, -3] = [4*1 + (-1)*(-3)] = [4 + 3] = [7], and [2*1 + 1*(-3)] = [2 - 3] = [-1]. Perfect.\n\nSo, M is correct. Now, the problem is to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. Hmm. The image of a line under a linear transformation is another line, so I need to find what line the transformed points lie on.\n\nAlternatively, since y = 2x + 1 is"

To find the equation of this image line, maybe I can apply M to two points on the original line and then find the equation of the line connecting their images.\n\nSo, pick two points on y = 2x + 1. Let's choose x = 0 and x = 1 for simplicity.\n\nWhen x=0, y=1: Point A is (0, 1).\nWhen x=1, y=3: Point B is (1, 3).\n\nNow, let's find where these points go under M.\n\nCompute M * A:\n\nM = [[4, -1], [2, 1]]\nA = [0, 1]^T\n\nSo,\n\n[4*0 + (-1)*1] = [ -1 ]\n[2*0 + 1*1]  = [ 1 ]\n\nSo, point A' is (-1, 1).\n\nCompute M * B:\n\nB = [1, 3]^T\n\n[4*1 + (-1)*3] = [4 -3] = [1]\n[2*1 + 1*3] = [2 + 3] = [5]\n\nSo, point B' is (1, 5).\n\nNow, we have two points on the image: (-1, 1) and (1, 5). Let's find the equation of the line passing through these two points.\n\nFirst, compute the slope: m = (5 - 1)/(1 - (-1)) = 4/2 = 2.\n\nSo, slope m is 2.\n\nNow, using point-slope form. Let's use point (-1, 1):\n\ny - 1 = 2(x - (-1)) => y - 1 = 2(x +1) => y = 2x + 2 +1 => y = 2x +3.\n\nAlternatively, check with point (1,5): 5 = 2*1 + b => b = 3.
