            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under the matrix M. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a matrix does. A matrix transformation takes a vector in one space and maps it to another vector in another space. In this case, M is a 2x2 matrix that transforms points from R² to R², right? \n\nSo, the problem gives me two specific transformations:\n- When M is applied to the vector [2, -1], it becomes [9, 3].\n- When M is applied to the vector [1, -3], it becomes [7, -1].\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the matrix M itself. If I can determine M, then I can apply it to the entire line y = 2x + 1, which is a set of points (x, y) where y is defined by that equation.\n\nTo find M, I can set up equations based on the given transformations. Let me denote M as:\nM = [a  b]\n     [c  d]\n\nSo, applying M to the vector [2, -1] gives [9, 3]. That means:\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9  (1)\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3  (2)\n\nSimilarly, applying M to [1, -3] gives [7, -1], so:\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7  (3)\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1 (4)\n\nNow, I have four equations:\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. 2c - d = 3\n3. a - 3b = 7\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nI can solve these equations to find a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me start with equations 1 and 3 to find a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nI can use substitution or elimination. Let me solve equation 1 for b:\nb = 2a - 9\n\nNow plug this into equation 3:\na - 3*(2a - 9) = 7\na - 6a + 27 = 7\n-5"

Now, I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. So, for any point (x, y) on this line, the image point under M will be (x', y') = M*(x, y).\n\nSo, let me represent (x, y) as a vector and apply M to it.\n\nIf I can parameterize the line y = 2x + 1, maybe I can express it as a vector function. Let's say t is a parameter, so:\n\nx = t\ny = 2t + 1\n\nThen, the vector (x, y) = [t, 2t + "

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Since the transformation is linear, maybe I can represent it as a combination of the given transformations.\n\nBut wait, the line y = 2x +1 is a specific line. Since affine transformations (which include linear transformations and translations) transform lines to lines, I can find the image by finding the image of two points on the line and then determine the equation.\n\nBut in this case, the problem is linear because the transformation is given by a linear matrix (since the given transformations are linear, as M is a linear transformation, no translation involved? Wait, no, because M is a linear transformation, so the image of a line will be another line. But since y =2x +1 is an affine line, but under a linear transformation, it should map to another affine line.\n\nWait, but I think my earlier approach is correct, because when I parametrized the line, I got y'"

Let's choose x =0, then y=1. So the point (0,1). Applying M:\n\nM*(0,1) = [4*0 -1*1, 2*0 +1*1] = [-1, 1]\n\nSo the image point is (-1,1). Let's plug into y =2x +3:\n\ny =2*(-1) +3 = -2 +3 =1. That works.\n\nAnother point: x=1, then y=3. The point (1,3). Applying M:\n\nM*(1,3) = [4*1 -1*3, 2*1 +1*3] = [4-3, 2+3] = [1,5]\n\nCheck in y =2x +3: y =2*1 +3 =5.

So the image is y =2x +3. Wait, but let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since the line can be written as a vector equation. Let me think of the line as all vectors (x, y) where y =2x +1. So, in vector form, this can be written as a point plus a direction vector. The direction vector of the line y=2x +1 is (1,2), since the slope is 2. The line can be parametrized as (0,1) + t*(1,2). \n\nSo, the direction vector is (1,2). The point (0,1) is on the line. \n\nUnder the transformation M, the direction vector (1,2)"

The image of the point (0,1) under M is (-1,1), as before.\n\nSo, the image line can be written as the image point plus t times the transformed direction vector. So, the line is (-1,1) + t*(2,4). Let's express this:\n\nx = -1 +2t\n\ny = 1 +4t\n\nNow, to express y in terms of x, we can solve for t from x:\n\nx = -1 +2t => t = (x +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into y:\n\ny =1 +4*( (x +1)/2 ) =1 +2*(x +1) =1 +2x +2 =2x +3\n\nSo, the image is y =2x +3, same as before.
