Then, I have to find \\( a + b + p \\) where the area is expressed as \\( p^{a/b} \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, my first thought is that maybe this equation can be factored or transformed into something more manageable. The coefficients have imaginary units and powers of z, so perhaps it's a quartic equation that can be rewritten in a form that allows me to factor it or use substitution.\n\nLooking at the equation again: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). The coefficients 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i remind me of the coefficients of a binomial expansion. Wait, maybe if I let \\( w = z + i \\) or some substitution like that, I might be able to rewrite the equation in terms of \\( w \\).\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let \\( w = z + i \\). Then, \\( z = w - i \\). Let me substitute \\( z = w - i \\) into the equation.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( z^4 \\):\n\\( z^4 = (w - i)^4 \\). Hmm, that might get complicated, but let's try to expand it.\n\nBut before I dive into expanding \\( z^4 \\), maybe I can notice a pattern in the coefficients. The coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Wait, those look a lot like the coefficients of \\( (a + b)^4 \\), which is \\( a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4 \\). But in this case, the coefficients alternate with imaginary units. So, is there a substitution that can make this resemble a binomial expansion?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation can be rewritten as a quadratic in terms of \\( z^2 \\) or \\( z^2 + something \\).

However, the center of the square would also be shifted.\n\nWait, but actually, the original square (the roots \\( \\omega_k \\)) is centered at the origin, right? Because roots of complex numbers are symmetric around the origin. So, when we subtract i, we are translating the entire square down by 1 unit. So, the shape remains a square, just shifted.

Since shifting a figure in the plane doesn't change its area, the area remains the same as the original square.

Therefore, the fourth root of that modulus is (sqrt(2))^{1/4}= (2^{1/2})^{1/4}=2^{1/8}.

So, the area is that of the square.\n\nBut is there a way to compute this area more directly? Maybe using complex analysis, such as using the formula for the area of a polygon given its vertices in the complex plane.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula that the area is half the magnitude of the sum over edges of z_j conj(z_{j+1}).\n\nBut since all the vertices are known, it's a bit involved but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, alternatively, since the polygon is a square, which is a regular polygon, the area can be calculated as (side length)^2. As we found, the side length is 2^{5/8}, so area is 2^{5/4}.\n\nTherefore, I think this makes sense.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Is 2^{5/4} actually the area? Or is the area of the square different? Because if the square is inscribed in a circle of radius 2^{1/8}, then the area is 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2*2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think 2^{5/4} is the correct area, so the answer is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11.\n\nAnother sanity check: Since the original equation is quartic, with leading coefficient 1, the product of the roots is the constant term divided by the leading coefficient, so the product of z's is -i, which makes sense because the product of the roots \\( \\omega_k - i \\) would involve some complex number, but I don't think that's necessary here since we already figured out the shape is a square with area 2^{5/4}.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. So, the area is 2^{5/4}, so a=5, b=4, p=2, and a + b + p = 11.\n</think>\n\nThe given equation can be rewritten as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\). Solving for \\( z \\) gives the solutions as the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i"
