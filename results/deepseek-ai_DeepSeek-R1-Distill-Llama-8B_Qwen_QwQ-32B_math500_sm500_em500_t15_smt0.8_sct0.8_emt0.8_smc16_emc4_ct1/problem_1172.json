The problem says that the solutions of this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon. The area is supposed to be expressible as \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime. Then, I need to compute \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, let me understand the equation. It's a quartic equation because the highest power of \\( z \\) is 4. So, there should be four solutions (roots) in the complex plane. These four roots form the vertices of a convex polygon, which in the complex plane are points in the plane, connected in order, forming a quadrilateral. Maybe a square or a rectangle? Or some other convex quadrilateral.\n\nSince it's a convex polygon, the order of the roots (when connected in the complex plane) will form a convex quadrilateral without self-intersections.\n\nI think the first step is to solve the equation \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). But quartic equations can be tough. Maybe there's a way to factor this equation.\n\nLooking at the coefficients, I see they involve powers of \\( i \\). Let me write down the equation again:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \\).\n\nHmm. The coefficients seem a bit like those of a quadratic in \\( z \\), but with each term multiplied by a power of \\( i \\). Let me see if I can factor this expression as a quadratic in \\( z \\), but with some manipulation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as \\( (z^2 + a z + b)^2 + ... \\) or something similar. Or maybe factor by grouping.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 - 4i z - i = 0 \\).\n\nLet me try to group terms:\n\nGroup the first two terms and the next two terms:\n\n\\( (z^4 + 4i z^3) +"

The original equation is almost the same except the constant term is -i instead of +1, and the original also has an extra term? Wait, actually, the original equation is:\n\n\\( z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i =0 \\).\n\nSo, the difference between the expansion of \\( (z +i)^4 \\) and the original equation is that:\n\n\\( (z +i)^4 = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 \\),\n\nOriginal equation: \\( (z +i)^4 -1 -i =0"
