Hmm, that seems a bit daunting at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the left side of the equation has four fractions, each with a linear numerator and a quadratic denominator. The right side is a linear equation in x. So, maybe there's a way to manipulate this equation to make it more manageable. \n\nI wonder if there's a substitution that can simplify things here. Let's see, each denominator is of the form \\(x^2 - n\\), where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe I can let \\(y = x^2\\), but then again, each term has a different constant, which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe I can express each term as a function of \\(x^2\\), but that might not directly help.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the entire left-hand side (LHS) as a function and see if it's possible to express it in terms of partial fractions or something similar. However, each term has a unique denominator, so partial fractions might not easily combine here. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominators could work, but with four different denominators, that might result in a very complicated polynomial equation. Before diving into that, maybe I can analyze the structure of the equation a bit more.\n\nLet me write out the equation again for clarity:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\\]\n\nI notice that each denominator can be factored as \\(x^2 - n = (x - \\sqrt{n})(x + \\sqrt{n})\\). So, each term has roots at \\(x = \\sqrt{n}\\) and \\(x = -\\sqrt{n}\\). But since x is squared,"

Anyway, moving on... the equation is set equal to a linear function 2010x -4. So, the LHS is a sum of reciprocals of quadratics, and the RHS is a straight line. The solutions to this equation would be the x-values where these two sides intersect.\n\nBut solving for x directly here seems difficult because of the different denominators. Maybe there's a trick here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions, perhaps Vieta's theorem can be applied here. Vieta's relates the sum of roots of a polynomial to its coefficients. But to use that, I need the equation to be a polynomial equation. \n\nSo, let me try to manipulate the equation into a polynomial form. Let's see:\n\nFirst, multiply both sides of the equation by the product of all denominators to eliminate the fractions. That would be the common denominator. The denominators are \\(x^2 -1\\), \\(x^2 -2\\), \\(x^2 -3\\), \\(x^2 -4\\). Let me denote the denominators as follows for simplicity:\n\nLet \\(D_1 = x^2 -1\\), \\(D_2 = x^2 -2\\), \\(D_3 = x^2 -3\\), \\(D_4 = x^2 -4\\). \n\nThe common denominator would then be \\(D_1 D_2 D_3 D_4\\). Multiplying both sides by this common denominator will clear the denominators:\n\n\\(D_2 D_3 D_4 + 2 D_1 D_3 D_4 + 3 D_1 D_2 D_4 + 4 D_1 D_2 D_3 = (2010x -4) D_1 D_2 D_3 D_4\\)\n\nWait, let me confirm that.

However, the right side is (2010x -4) times D1D2D3D4, which is degree 8 multiplied by degree 1, so degree 9.\n\nWait, but is this approach feasible? It might result in a very high-degree polynomial, which is difficult to solve. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAnother thought: the equation is of the form sum_{n=1}^4 (n/(x^2 - n)) = 2010x -4.\n\nPerhaps I can express each term as n/(x^2 - n) = A_n/(x - sqrt(n)) + B_n/(x + sqrt(n)).\n\nBut this partial fraction decomposition could be helpful, but with each decomposition having coefficients dependent on n.\n\nWait, let me try that. Let me write each term on the LHS as partial fractions.\n\nSo, for each term, \\(n/(x^2 -n)\\), which can be written as \\(n/(x^2 -n) = \\frac{A}{x - \\sqrt{n}} + \\frac{B}{x + \\sqrt{n}}\\).\n\nSolving for A and B: Let's multiply both sides by (x - sqrt(n))(x + sqrt(n)) = x^2 -n.\n\nSo, n = A(x + sqrt(n)) + B(x - sqrt(n)).\n\nNow, set x = sqrt(n): then n = A(2 sqrt(n)) => A = n/(2 sqrt(n)) = sqrt(n)/2.\n\nSimilarly, set x = -sqrt(n): n = B(-2 sqrt(n))"

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the first term properly.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nEach term in the sum is n/(x^2 -n) multiplied by the common denominator D1 D2 D3 D4. So, for each term, when n=1, the term is 1/(x^2 -1) multiplied by D1 D2 D3 D4, which is D2 D3 D4.

The coefficient of x^8 is 1, since all the constant terms are negative, but when you multiply everything, the x^8 term comes only from multiplying the x^2 terms together: x^2 * x^2 * x^2 * x^2 = x^8.

Because the original equation isn't a polynomial, but after clearing denominators, it becomes a polynomial. The roots correspond to the solutions of the original equation, which are the x-values that make the equation true. However, we had to exclude some x-values because the denominators can't be zero, but those are just points where the function is undefined, not solutions.\n\nThus, in the polynomial equation, all roots correspond to solutions of the original equation, except possibly solutions where D1 D2 D3 D4 =0, but those are excluded. Wait, but in the process of multiplying both sides by D1 D2 D3 D4, we introduced extraneous roots which make the denominators zero, but actually, these roots are not solutions of the original equation.\n\nHowever, Vieta's theorem counts all roots, including extraneous ones. So, does that mean that when we compute the sum, we have to include these extraneous roots as well?\n\nWait, but the original problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions of the equation. The solutions to the original equation are the x where f(x) =2010x -4, and f(x) is undefined when any denominator is zero, so x ≠ ±1, ±sqrt(2), ±sqrt(3), ±2. Therefore, any root in the polynomial that is x=1, -1, sqrt(2), etc., is actually an extraneous root and should not be included in the sum.\n\nHmm, this complicates things because if Vieta counts all roots, including extraneous ones, then 2/1005 includes those extr"

Therefore, the actual sum of the solutions would be the Vieta sum minus the sum of the extraneous roots.\n\nTherefore, I need to check whether any of the excluded x-values (the denominators' roots) are actually roots of the polynomial equation P(x)=0.\n\nWait, let me think. The polynomial equation P(x)=0 is equivalent to the original equation multiplied by the denominators, so any solution of the original equation is a solution of P(x)=0, but solutions of P(x)=0 that make any denominator zero are not solutions of the original equation. Therefore, the roots of P(x)=0 include the solutions of the original equation plus the roots of the denominators (i.e., x^2 -1=0, etc.), so those are the extraneous roots.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial P(x)=0 has degree 9, so 9 roots (counting multiplicity). The original equation has solutions equal to the roots of P(x)=0 except for the roots of the denominators (i.e., x=±1, ±sqrt(2), ±sqrt(3), ±2). But how many of those are roots of P(x)=0?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me check if x=1 is a root of P(x)=0.\n\nPlugging x=1 into P(x):\n\nFirst, the original equation at x=1 would have denominators x^2 -1=0, so it's undefined.
