Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down. \n\nFirst, I need to find the sum of all complex solutions for this equation. So, my goal is to find all the roots \\(x\\) that satisfy this equation and then add them up. Since it's a complex equation, I expect there might be multiple solutions, maybe even some complex ones. \n\nLooking at the left side, it's a sum of four rational expressions. Each denominator is a quadratic, like \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), etc. The denominators are all different, so the function on the left should be a rational function with some specific behavior. The right side is a linear function, \\(2010x - 4\\), which is much simpler. \n\nSince both sides are functions of \\(x\\), maybe I can set them equal and analyze their intersections. But solving such an equation directly seems complicated. I wonder if there's a way to manipulate the equation or use some algebraic identities to simplify it.\n\nLet me think about possible substitutions. Maybe if I let \\(y = x^2\\), then each denominator becomes \\(y - n\\) where \\(n\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the left side becomes \\(\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}\\). Hmm, that might not immediately help, but maybe it can be useful later.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for equations involving sums of reciprocals of quadratics, partial fraction decomposition is often a useful technique. But in this case, the denominators are all different, so partial fractions might be a way forward, but it could get messy with four terms.\n\nWait, maybe instead of looking at partial fractions, I can consider the entire left-hand side (LHS) as a function and the right-hand side (RHS) as another function and analyze"

Since the LHS is a sum of terms each of which has a vertical asymptote at \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{n}\\) for \\(n = 1,2,3,4\\), so the function is undefined at those points. The RHS is a straight line with a very steep slope (2010) and a y-intercept at -4. \n\nThe equation is asking where these two functions intersect. Since the LHS has vertical asymptotes, the solutions can't be at those points, but they can be anywhere else. However, since we are dealing with complex solutions, maybe the asymptotes aren't as much of an issue? Wait, in complex analysis, asymptotes are different, but since we are just solving the equation algebraically, perhaps we can proceed by manipulating the equation.\n\nLet me try to combine the terms on the left side. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), \\(x^2 - 4\\). The common denominator would be the product of all these denominators. That's going to be a huge polynomial, degree 8, which might be too complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying everything to one side and setting the equation to zero. Let me write the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut even so, combining all these terms into a single rational function would require multiplying through by the common denominator, which is indeed the product of all denominators. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote \\(D(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). Then, multiplying both sides by \\(D(x)\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nD(x) \\left( \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} +"

Each term is a product of three quadratics, multiplied by 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. Then subtracting the product of the line and the common denominator.\n\nThis seems really messy. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me think about the original equation again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the left side is a function, say \\(f(x)\\), and the right side is \\(g(x) = 2010x - 4\\). Then, perhaps, the equation \\(f(x) = g(x)\\) can be thought of as a function equation, and the solutions are the x-values where these two functions intersect.\n\nSince we are looking for the sum of all solutions, maybe we can use some properties of polynomials. But I need to check whether after moving everything to one side, is the resulting polynomial's degree?\n\nWait, if I let \\(P(x) = f(x) - g(x)\\), then \\(P(x) = 0\\) is the equation we need to solve. So, \\(P(x)\\) is the left side as above minus the right side. The degree of \\(P(x)\\) will be 8, since the denominators are quadratics, so when multiplied out, each denominator term cancels a quadratic, but since we have four denominators, each term when multiplied becomes degree 6, but we have subtraction of a linear term, so the overall degree is 8.\n\nWait, actually,"

Then the right side term is (2010x -4)*D(x), which is degree 9 (since D(x) is degree 8, multiplied by x gives degree 9). Wait, so actually, the equation after multiplying by D(x) would be a degree 9 polynomial equals zero. Hmm, so the equation is a 9th-degree polynomial equation. Therefore, the equation has 9 roots (counting multiplicity) in the complex plane. But the problem says \"sum of all complex solutions\", so the sum would be the sum of all roots of this polynomial. \n\nHowever, there's a caveat here: when we multiplied both sides by D(x), we might have introduced extraneous roots where D(x)=0, but those are exactly the points where the original equation is undefined (since denominators are zero). Therefore, the roots of D(x)=0 are excluded from the solutions. Therefore, the actual solutions are the roots of the equation P(x)=0 (the polynomial of degree 9) except those roots which are also roots of D(x)=0. \n\nTherefore, the equation P(x)=0 has 9 roots, but some of them might coincide with the roots of D(x)=0 (i.e., x^2 =1,2,3,4). So, the actual solutions are the roots of P(x)=0 excluding those roots. However, since we are to find the sum of all complex solutions, perhaps we can use Vieta's formula on the polynomial P(x), then subtract the sum of the roots that are excluded (i.e., the roots of D(x)=0 that are also roots of P(x)=0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the roots of D(x)=0 are not roots of P(x)=0, so they are not solutions. Therefore, the solutions are exactly the roots of P(x)=0 except those roots which are in the excluded points.

Let me recall that for a polynomial equation, the sum of all roots is equal to minus the coefficient of the second highest degree term divided by the leading coefficient. So, if I can write P(x) as a polynomial, then the sum of its roots is just -b/a, where a is the leading coefficient, b is the coefficient of x^7.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I can compute P(x) as a polynomial, find its leading coefficient and the coefficient of x^7, and then the sum of all its roots is -b/a.\n\nSo, maybe I don't need to find all the roots, just to compute the sum. That seems feasible.\n\nLet me try that. So, I need to find P(x) = LHS - RHS, where LHS = sum of 1/(x^2 - n) multiplied by their coefficients, and RHS = 2010x -4. So, P(x) is equal to sum_{n=1}^4 c_n * (product of three quadratics without denominator n) - (2010x -4) * D(x).\n\nBut that might be quite involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the original equation and make a substitution that can simplify it.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe if I let t = x + 1/x? But let's see, the denominators are x^2 - n, so perhaps that could be rewritten as x^2 - n = x(x - sqrt(n))(x + sqrt(n)). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that the coefficients 1,2,3,4 could relate to the linear terms in the numerator. Maybe I can relate the numerators to the derivatives or something? Hmm, that might be a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps an important property is that for each term, 1/(x^2 - n) can be expressed as (1/2) [1/(x - sqrt(n)) + 1/(x + sqrt(n))].
