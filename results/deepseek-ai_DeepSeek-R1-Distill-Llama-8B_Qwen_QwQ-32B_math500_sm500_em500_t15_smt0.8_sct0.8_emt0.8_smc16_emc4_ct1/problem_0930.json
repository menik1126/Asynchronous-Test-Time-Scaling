            "output": "First, I need to determine how many trailing zeros are in the factorial of 42. Trailing zeros are produced by factors of 10, and since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I should count the number of times 2 and 5 appear in the prime factors of 42!.\n\nI know that in any factorial, there are more multiples of 2 than multiples of 5, so the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros. I'll start by dividing 42 by 5.\n\n42 divided by 5 is 8 with a remainder. This means there are 8 factors of 5 in 42!.\n\nNext, I need to account for the multiples of higher powers of 5. Multiples of 25 contribute an additional 5 for each multiple. Dividing 42 by 25 gives 1 with a remainder, so there's 1 more factor of 5 from these.\n\nCombining these, the total number of factors of 5 in 42! is 8 plus 1, which equals 9.\n\nFinally, I'll add 1 to the total number of factors of 5 because each trailing zero requires one pair of 2 and 5, and there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial. Therefore, 42! has 9 trailing zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to find out how many times the factor 10 appears in the product. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), each trailing zero is contributed by a pair of these factors.\n\n**Step 1: Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\)**\n\nEvery multiple of 5 in the numbers from 1 to 42 contributes at least one 5. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, there are **8** fives in the prime factors of \\(42!\\).\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of 25s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\)**\n\nNumbers that are multiples of 25 contribute an extra 5. Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, there is **1** additional five from multiples of 25.\n\n**Step 3"
