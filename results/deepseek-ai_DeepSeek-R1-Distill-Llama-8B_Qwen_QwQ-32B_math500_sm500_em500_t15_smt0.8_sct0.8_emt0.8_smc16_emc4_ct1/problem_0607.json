Hmm, let me start by recalling what common tangents are. They are lines that touch both curves without crossing them.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the problem. The circle is centered at the origin with a radius of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), and the parabola opens to the right with vertex at the origin. The parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\) has a focus at (2, 0) and a directrix at \\(x = -2\\), I think. But maybe that's not important right now.\n\nI remember that to find the equations of the common tangents, I can use the condition for a line to be tangent to both the circle and the parabola. Let me denote the equation of a tangent line as \\(y = mx + c\\). Since it's a tangent to the circle, the distance from the center (which is (0,0)) to the line must be equal to the radius. The formula for the distance from a point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) to the line \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\) is \\(\\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}\\). \n\nSo, rewriting \\(y = mx + c\\) as \\(mx - y + c = 0\\), the distance from (0,0) to this line is \\(\\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}}\\). This distance should equal the radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). So, I have \\(\\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = \\sqrt{2}\\). Squaring both sides, \\(\\frac{c^2}{m^2 + 1} = 2\\), which means \\(c^2 = 2(m^2 + 1)\\). So, \\(c = \\pm \\sqrt{2(m^2 + 1)}\\).\n\nNow, this same line \\(y = mx + c\\) must also be tangent to the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\). For a line to"
