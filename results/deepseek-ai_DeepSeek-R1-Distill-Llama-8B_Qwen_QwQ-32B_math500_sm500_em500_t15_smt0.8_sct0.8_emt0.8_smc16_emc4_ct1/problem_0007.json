            "output": "Okay, I have this problem here about polynomials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the problem says:\n\nLet P(x) be a monic polynomial of degree 3. That means the leading coefficient is 1, so P(x) should look like x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find or maybe use somehow.\n\nIt also says that P(x) has a remainder R(x) when it's divided by (x - 1)(x - 4). And when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Additionally, we're given that P(0) = 5, and we need to find P(5).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall some polynomial division concepts. When you divide a polynomial P(x) by a quadratic polynomial, say (x - a)(x - b), the remainder R(x) will be of degree less than 2, so it's a linear polynomial, like R(x) = mx + n.\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by another quadratic, say (x - c)(x - d), the remainder will also be linear, say S(x) = px + q. The problem says this remainder is 2R(x), so S(x) = 2R(x).\n\nI remember the Remainder Theorem which states that the remainder of a polynomial P(x) divided by (x - k) is P(k). But this is for linear divisors. For quadratic divisors, I think the remainder can be found by evaluating P at the roots.\n\nWait, more precisely, if the divisor is (x - a)(x - b), then P(a) = R(a) and P(b) = R(b), because when x = a or x = b, the divisor becomes zero, so the remainder is the value of P at those points.\n\nBut in the problem, it's given that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So that means:\n\nP(1) = R(1)\nP(4) = R(4)\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So:\n\nP(2) = 2R(2"

Then:\n\nP(1) = m*1 + n = m + n\nP(4) = m*4 + n = 4m + n\n\nSimilarly, 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n, so:\n\nP(2) = 2m*2 + 2n = 4m + 2n\nP(3) = 2m*3 + 2n = 6m + 2n\n\nSo now I have expressions for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) in terms of m and n. But also, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, I can write it as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)(something) + R(x)\n\nBut since it's a cubic divided by a quadratic, the quotient would be linear, so let me write:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)(dx + e) + R(x)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), it would be:\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(fx + g) + 2R(x)\n\nBut maybe this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, since P(x) is a cubic, maybe I can write it in terms of its general form and use the given conditions.\n\nLet me try that. Let me write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\nWe know that P(0) = 5, so plugging in x = 0:\n\nP(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + c = c = 5. So c = 5. That's one variable found.\n\nSo now, P(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + 5.\n\nNow, we need to use the remainder conditions. Let me recall that when dividing by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder R(x) is a linear polynomial, so R(x) = mx + n. Then, as per the Remainder Theorem, P(1) = R(1) = m + n, and P(4)"
