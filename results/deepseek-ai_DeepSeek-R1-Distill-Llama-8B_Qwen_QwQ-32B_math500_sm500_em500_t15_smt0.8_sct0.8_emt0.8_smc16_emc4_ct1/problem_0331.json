Mr. Brennan has 7 boys and 4 girls in his statistics class.\n\nNext, I will identify how many boys and girls need to be selected for the group presentation. The task is to pick 3 boys out of the 7 and 2 girls out of the 4.\n\nTo find the number of ways to choose the boys, I'll use the combination formula, which is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. So, for the boys, the number of combinations is C(7, 3).\n\nSimilarly, for the girls, the number of combinations will be C(4, 2).\n\nAfter calculating the combinations for both boys and girls, I'll multiply the two results together to get the total number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick the group.\n\nFinally, I will present the final answer, which is the product of the two combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll use combinations since the order of selection doesn't matter.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7.**\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4.**\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two results to find the total number of ways.**\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Brennan can pick the group in \\(\\boxed{210}\\) different ways."
