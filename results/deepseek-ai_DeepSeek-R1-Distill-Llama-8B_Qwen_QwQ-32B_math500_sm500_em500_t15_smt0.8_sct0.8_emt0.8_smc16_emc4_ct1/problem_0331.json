Mr. Brennan wants to select 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the boys. This can be done using combinations, specifically \"7 choose 3,\" which is written as C(7,3). The formula for combinations is C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).\n\nThen, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the girls. Since there are 4 girls and we need to choose 2, this is \"4 choose 2,\" or C(4,2). Using the same combination formula, I'll compute this value.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to form the group, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls. This will give me the total combination of students for the presentation.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nMr. Brennan needs to select 3 boys and 2 girls from his class. We'll use combinations to determine the number of ways to do this.\n\n1. **Number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   \\[\n   C(7,3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}\n   \\]\n   \n   Calculating the factorial:\n   \n   \\[\n   7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4! \\\\\n   4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging back:\n   \n   \\[\n   C(7,3) = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{3! \\times 4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{6} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \n   \\[\n   C(4,2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!}\n   \\]\n   \n   Calculating the factorial:\n   \n   \\[\n   4! = 4 \\times"
