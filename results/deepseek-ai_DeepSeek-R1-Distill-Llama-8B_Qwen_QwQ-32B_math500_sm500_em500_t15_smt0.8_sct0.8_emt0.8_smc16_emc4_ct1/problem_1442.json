I remember that equations with exponents can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can simplify it by rewriting 3^(2x) as something else. \n\nWait, 3^(2x) is the same as (3^x)^2, right? Because when you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So 3^(2x) = (3^x)^2. That might make things easier.\n\nSo then the equation becomes (3^x)^2 + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, maybe it's helpful to let y equal 3^x or 10^x. Let me think. If I let y = 3^x, then 3^(2x) is y squared, so (3^x)^2 = y\u00b2. Then the equation is y\u00b2 + 19 = 10^x.\n\nBut 10^x is a different base, so maybe that's not the best substitution. Alternatively, what if I let z = 10^x? Then 10^x = z, so the equation becomes (3^x)^2 + 19 = z. But I still have 3^x in there, which is related to z somehow. \n\nI know that 3^x can be expressed in terms of z because 3^x = (3^x). Since 10^x = z, maybe I can write 3^x as z raised to the power of something. Wait, 10^x = z, so x = log_10(z). Then 3^x = 3^(log_10(z)). Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nLet me try plugging in some integer values for x to see if I can find a solution. Exponential functions can sometimes have integer solutions.\n\nLet's try x = 1: 3^(2*1) + 19 = 9 + 19 = 28. 10^1 = 10. So 28 \u2260 10.\n\nx = 2: 3^4 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100. 10^2 = 100. Oh! So 100 = 100. That works. So x = 2 is a solution"

But the problem might have another solution. Since both sides are exponential functions, but different bases. The left side is 3^(2x) which grows as (9)^x and the right is 10^x. Since 10 >9, so perhaps after x=2, the right side overtakes again?\n\nWait at x=2, both are 100. Let's check x=2.5. Let me compute:\n\nLeft side: 3^(5) +19 =243 +19=262. Right side: 10^2.5 is sqrt(10^5)= sqrt(100000)=approx 316.23. So left side is less than right here. So at x=2.5, 262 < 316.23, so right is bigger. \n\nThen at higher x, since 10^x is growing faster, the right side will dominate. \n\nWhat about x between 0 and 2? Let's check x=1.5: Left: 3^3 +19 =27 +19=46. Right: 10^1.5\u224831.62. So here, left is 46, right ~31.62. So left is bigger here.\n\nSo between x=1.5 and x=2.5, the functions cross at x=2. But maybe they cross somewhere else?\n\nWait, maybe between x=0 and 1, or x negative?\n\nLet me try x=0. Left is 20, right is 1. So right is smaller.\n\nx=0.5: Left side: 3^1 +19 =3 +19=22. Right side: 10^0.5\u22483.16. So left much larger.\n\nSo from x= -infinity to some point, maybe the equations cross once"

So left is bigger.\n\nAt x=0: left is 20, right is 1.\n\nAt x=2: both 100.\n\nAt x=3: left=729 +19=748, right=1000. So right is bigger.\n\nSo plotting the functions, left is (9)^x +19 and right is 10^x. The left starts higher, but the right overtakes at x=2 and keeps growing faster beyond that. But what's the behavior between x= -infty and x=2?\n\nWait, what if x is between 0 and 2: the left decreases from 20 to 100, but wait 9^x is increasing, so 9^x +19 is increasing. Wait, no, 3^(2x) is 9^x, which is an increasing function, so as x increases, 9^x increases, so left side increases from 19 to 100 as x goes from 0 to 2. Right side 10^x increases from 1 to 100 as x goes from 0 to 2. So both functions are increasing from x=0 to x=2. The left starts higher, both increase, and cross at x=2.\n\nNow, what about for x less than 2, is there another crossing?\n\nWait, at x=2, both equal 100. At x=1, left is 28, right is 10. At x=0, left is 20, right is 1. So between x=0 and x=2, left is always above right. So does that mean that the only crossing is once at x=2?\n\nBut wait, could there be another crossing for x < 0?\n\nLet me check x= -1: 3^(-2) +19 =1/9 +19 \u2248 0.11 +19=19.11. Right side:10^(-1)=0.1. So left is bigger. What about x= -0.5: 3^(-1) +19\u22480.33 +19=19.33. Right side:10^(-0.5)\u22480.316. So left still bigger.\n\nWait, how about x approaching negative"

Right is 10^5=100000. So right is bigger. Hmm, so after x=2, right side is growing faster. So maybe the left side never catches up again. So the only solution is x=2?\n\nWait, but let me check between x=2 and x=3 again. At x=2, both are 100. At x=2.5, left is 262, right is ~316. So right is bigger. So the right side is above left from x=2 onwards. So the only point where they cross is at x=2. So that's the only solution?\n\nWait, but maybe there's another solution where x is less than 0? Let me see. Let me suppose x is negative. Let me pick x = -2: left is 3^(-4) +19 = 1/(81) +19 \u2248 0.012 +19 \u224819.012. Right side is 10^(-2)=0.01. So left is way bigger.

Let me try taking logarithms, but that might complicate because of the addition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe substituting variables. Let me set y = 10^x. Then, since 3^(2x) = (3^2)^x =9^x. So 9^x = (9/10)^x *10^x = (9/10)^x *"

So:\n\n(9/10)^x * y = y -19. \n\nBut (9/10)^x is equal to (9^x)/(10^x) = (y -19)/y.\n\nSo (9/10)^x = (y -19)/y.\n\nBut (9/10)^x = e^{x ln(9/10)}.\n\nAlternatively, taking natural logs:\n\nln( (y -19)/y ) = x ln(9/10).\n\nBut x = log_10(y), since y =10^x, so x = ln y / ln 10.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nln( (y -19)/y ) = (ln y / ln 10) * ln(9/10).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nln( (y -19)/y ) = (ln y / ln 10) * ln(9/10).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can manipulate it.\n\nLet me denote a = ln(9/10), so the equation becomes:\n\nln( (y -19)/y ) = a * (ln y / ln 10).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure that's helpful. Maybe trying to see if y=100, which corresponds to x=2, since 10^2=100.\n\nPlugging y=100: Left side: ln( (100 -19)/100 )=ln(81/100)=ln(0.81). Right side: a * (ln 100 / ln10 )= a * 2, since ln100=ln(10^2)=2 ln10. So a= ln(9/10)=ln(0.9). So right side is 2 * ln(0.9)\u22482*(-0.105)= -0.21. Ln(0.81)\u2248-0.2107. So it's approximately equal. That's consistent with x=2 being a solution.\n\nBut does another y satisfy this? It's not obvious. Since the equation in terms of y seems transcendental, meaning it can't be solved with algebraic methods, so maybe x=2 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, plotting or testing"

At x=3, left is 748 vs 1000. So right is still bigger. So the right side is always above left for x>2. So no solution there.\n\nWhat about between x=1 and 2? At x=1.5, left is 46, right is ~31.62. So left is bigger. At x=2, they meet. So between 1.5 and 2, the left decreases to meet the right? Wait, no, both are increasing. Wait, left is 9^x +19, so increasing. Right is 10^x, also increasing. So from x=1.5 to 2, left goes from 46 to 100, right goes from ~31.62 to 100. So they cross at x=2. So before that, left is above.
