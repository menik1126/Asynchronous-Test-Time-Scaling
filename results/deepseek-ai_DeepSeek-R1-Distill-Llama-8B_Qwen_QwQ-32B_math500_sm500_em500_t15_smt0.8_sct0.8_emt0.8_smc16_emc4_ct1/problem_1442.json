Hmm, this looks a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me understand the equation better. It has two exponential terms: \\(3^{2x}\\) and \\(10^x\\), plus a constant on the left side. Maybe I can rewrite \\(3^{2x}\\) in a different form to make it easier to work with. \n\nI remember that \\(3^{2x}\\) is the same as \\((3^2)^x\\) because of the exponentiation rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\). So, \\(3^{2x} = (3^2)^x = 9^x\\). That means I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\(9^x + 19 = 10^x\\)\n\nOkay, so now the equation is \\(9^x + 19 = 10^x\\). Hmm, maybe I can get all the exponential terms on one side. Let me subtract \\(9^x\\) from both sides:\n\n\\(19 = 10^x - 9^x\\)\n\nHmm, interesting. So now it's \\(19 = 10^x - 9^x\\). I wonder if there's a way to express this so that I can factor something out or use logarithms. \n\nLet me think about the properties of exponents. Both \\(10^x\\) and \\(9^x\\) have the same base, sort of. Wait, no, 10 and 9 are different. Hmm. Maybe I can write \\(10^x\\) as \\((10^x)\\) and \\(9^x\\) as \\((9^x)\\), which doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I can rewrite the equation in terms of a ratio?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take logarithms on both sides, but I'm not sure if that will help directly since there's a constant term involved. Let me consider if substitution might help. \n\nLet me set \\(y = 9^x\\). Then, since \\(10^x = (9 + 1)^x\\), which I know can be expanded using the binomial theorem, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can express \\(10^x\\) in terms of \\(9^x\\). \n\nLet me"

For x negative, let's say x approaching negative infinity, 10^x approaches zero, 9^x approaches zero, but 10^x is larger than 9^x because 10>9 and when x is negative, the larger base leads to a larger result when raised to a negative power. Wait, actually, when x is negative, a larger base raised to x gives a smaller result. For example, 10^{-1}=0.1, 9^{-1}=0.111..., so 10^{-1} <9^{-1}. Hmm, so for x negative, 10^x <9^x.\n\nSo, in that case, f’(x)= ln10 *10^x - ln9 *9^x. For x negative, 10^x is less than 9^x, so ln10 *10^x < ln9 *9^x.

Therefore, the function f(x) may have a minimum somewhere.\n\nWait, so if f’(x) changes sign from negative to positive, there's a critical point.
