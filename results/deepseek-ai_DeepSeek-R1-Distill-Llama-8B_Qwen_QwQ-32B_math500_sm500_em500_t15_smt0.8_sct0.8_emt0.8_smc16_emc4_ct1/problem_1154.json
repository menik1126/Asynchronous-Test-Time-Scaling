Let's solve it step by step.\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Rule:**\n   \n   The expression \\( (3^k)^6 \\) can be simplified using the power of a power rule, which states that \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n} \\).\n   \n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Exponents Equal to Each Other:**\n   \n   Now, the equation becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   3^{6k} = 3^6\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the bases are the same (\\( 3 \\)), the exponents must be equal.\n   \n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\):**\n   \n   To find \\( k \\), divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n   \n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
