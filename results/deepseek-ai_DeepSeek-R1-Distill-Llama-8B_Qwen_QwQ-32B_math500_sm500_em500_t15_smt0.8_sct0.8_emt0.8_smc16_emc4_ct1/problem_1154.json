Applying this to the left side of the equation, I get:\n\n\\[\n(3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n\\]\n\nNow the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3^{6k} = 3^6\n\\]\n\nSince the bases are the same and both sides are powers of 3, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, I can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\n6k = 6\n\\]\n\nFinally, solving for \\( k \\) by dividing both sides by 6 gives me:\n\n\\[\nk = 1\n\\]\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\nWe are given the equation:\n\\[\n(3^k)^6 = 3^6\n\\]\nOur goal is to find the value of \\( k \\).\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property:**\n   \n   The expression \\( (3^k)^6 \\) can be simplified using the exponent rule \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n} \\):\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the Exponents Equal:**\n   \n   Now the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   3^{6k} = 3^6\n   \\]\n   Since the bases are the same and the equation holds true, the exponents must be equal:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\( k \\):**\n   \n   Divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
