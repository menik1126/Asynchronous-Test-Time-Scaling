Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the expression represents. It's a fraction where the numerator is \\(x - y\\) and the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\). I need to find the maximum value of this fraction. So, essentially, I want to maximize the numerator while minimizing the denominator, but they're both dependent on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). That makes it a bit tricky.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to simplify this expression or maybe use some calculus to find the critical points. Since both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are variables, maybe I can use partial derivatives to find where the function reaches its maximum.\n\nLet me denote the function as \\(f(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\). To find its maximum value, I should compute the partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), set them equal to zero, and solve the resulting equations. That should give me the critical points which could be candidates for maxima or minima.\n\nSo, let's compute the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\) first. Using the quotient rule, the derivative of the numerator with respect to \\(x\\) is 1, and the derivative of the denominator with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(4x^3\\). So, the partial derivative \\(f_x\\) should be:\n\n\\[\nf_x = \\frac{(1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4x^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) will be:\n\n\\[\nf_y = \\frac{(-1)(x^4 + y^4 + 6) - (x - y)(4y^3)}{(x^4 + y^4 + 6)^2}\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the critical points, I need to set both \\(f_x = 0\\) and \\(f_y = 0\\).

So, no critical points here.\n\nCase 2: x = -y\n\nThen, let me substitute x = -y into equation (1):\n\n-3(-y)^4 +4(-y)^3 y + y^4 +6=0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n-3y^4 +4(-y^3)y + y^4 +6=0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-3y^4 -4y^4 + y^4 +6=0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-3 -4 +1)y^4 +6=0 → (-6)y^4 +6=0 → -6y^4= -6 → y^4=1 → y=±1\n\nSo, if y=1, then x=-1. If y=-1, then x=1.\n\nNow, check if these satisfy equation (2):\n\nEquation (2): -x^4 +3y^4 -4x y^3 -6=0\n\nFor x=-1, y=1:\n\n-(-1)^4 +3(1)^4 -4*(-1)(1)^3 -6= -1 +3 +4 -6= (-1 +3)=2; 2 +4=6; 6-6=0. Yes, satisfies.\n\nSimilarly, x=1, y=-1:\n\n-(1)^4 +3(-1)^4 -4*(1)*(-1)^3 -6= -1 +3 +4 -6= same result.\n\nSo, both points satisfy.\n\nThus, two critical points: (x, y)=(-1,1) and (1,-1).\n\nNow, let's compute f(x,y)= (x - y)/(x^4 + y^4 +6) at these points.\n\nFirst, at (-1,1):\n\nNumerator: (-1) -1="

So, only critical points are the ones found in case 2: (x,y)= (1,-1) and (-1,1).\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of the function is 0.25, since that's the higher value between 0.25 and -0.25.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, let's check what the function does at infinity. As |x| and |y| go to infinity, the denominator grows like x^4 or y^4, while the numerator grows linearly. So the function tends to zero. So, the maximum must be at one of the critical points.\n\nAdditionally, earlier testing when y=0 gives a maximum of ~0.1414, which is less than 0.25. Similarly, when y=-x, maximum is 0.25, which is the same as the critical points.\n\nTherefore,"

Then numerator is 4, denominator is 16 +16 +6=38, so 4/38≈0.105, which is less than 0.25. If I take x=1, y=0, then f(1,0)=1/(1+0+6)=1/7≈0.142, still less. If I take x=2, y= -1, then numerator is 3, denominator is 16 +1 +6=23, so 3/23≈0.13. Hmm, so indeed, the maximum seems to be at (1,-1) with 0.25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another critical point?\n\nWait, but according to the equations, the only critical points are those two. So, unless I made a mistake in solving the equations, that should be the maximum.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose that x and y are not negatives but something else. Let me try x=2, y=1. Then numerator is 1, denominator is 16 +1 +6=23, so 1/23≈0.043. Not better.\n\nAlternatively, x=0.5, y= -0.5. Then numerator is 1, denominator is (0.5)^4 + (-0.5)^4 +6= 0.0625 +0.0625 +6≈6.125, so 1/6.125≈0.163, still less than 0.25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x= sqrt(2), y= -sqrt(2). Then numerator is 2 sqrt(2), denominator is ( (sqrt(2))^4 )*2 +6= (4)*2 +6=14, so 2 sqrt(2)/14≈0.20, still less than 0.25.\n\nHmm, so seems like 0.25 is indeed the maximum.
