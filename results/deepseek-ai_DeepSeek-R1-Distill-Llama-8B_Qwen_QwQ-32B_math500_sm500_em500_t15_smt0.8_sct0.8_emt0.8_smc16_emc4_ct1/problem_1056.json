            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm and a hexagon has six sides, I'll multiply the side length by six.\n\nNext, the problem states that the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon. Therefore, I'll set the perimeter of the octagon equal to the perimeter of the hexagon, which is 96 cm.\n\nFinally, a regular octagon has eight sides. To find the length of each side, I'll divide the total perimeter by the number of sides, which is eight.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Find the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16\\,\\text{cm} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the perimeter of the regular octagon equal to that of the hexagon.**\n   \n   - Let \\( s \\) represent the length of each side of the octagon.\n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{octagon}} = 8s\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equate the perimeters and solve for \\( s \\).**\n   \n   \\[\n   8s = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{96\\,\\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe length of each side of the regular octagon is \\(\\boxed{12\\,\\text{cm}}\\)."
