            "output": "First, I need to find the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, the perimeter of the hexagon is calculated by multiplying the number of sides by the length of one side.\n\nNext, I should calculate the perimeter of the regular octagon. The problem states that the perimeters of the octagon and the hexagon are equal, so the perimeter of the octagon is also equal to 6 multiplied by 16 cm.\n\nFinally, to determine the length of each side of the octagon, I will divide the total perimeter by the number of sides, which is 8.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6** sides.\n   - Each side is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand that the perimeter of the regular octagon is equal to the perimeter of the hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8** sides.\n   - Let the length of each side of the octagon be \\( x \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n   \n3. **Set up the equation for the perimeter of the octagon.**\n   \n   \\[\n   8x = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\).**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
