            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here that I need to solve. It involves this function f defined recursively, and I need to find f(2015, 2). Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a function f that takes two arguments: i and j. The domain for i is all non-negative integers, and for j, it's from 0 to 4. The codomain is {0,1,2,3,4}. So, for any given i and j, f(i, j) will produce a remainder between 0 and 4 when divided by 5.\n\nThe function is defined recursively in three cases:\n\n1. If i = 0 and j is between 0 and 4, then f(0, j) is just mod5(j + 1). That means, for the base case when i=0, it's like adding 1 to j and taking modulo 5.\n\n2. If i is greater than or equal to 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) is equal to f(i - 1, 1). So, when j=0, the function calls itself with i decreased by 1 and j set to 1.\n\n3. If i is greater than or equal to 1 and j is between 1 and 4, then f(i, j) is f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). That looks a bit more complicated since it's a nested function call.\n\nGiven that, I need to compute f(2015, 2). Hmm, 2015 is a large number, so I don't want to compute this recursively step by step. I need to find a pattern or some periodicity in the function that can help me compute it efficiently.\n\nLet me start by computing some small cases to see if I can spot a pattern. Maybe the function f(i, j) has a period modulo some number, or maybe the j component cycles in a predictable way.\n\nStarting with i=0:\n\n- f(0,0) = mod5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0,1) = mod5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0,2) = mod5(2 + 1) = 3\n- f(0,3"

Let's compute f(1, j) for j from 0 to 4.\n\nStarting with j=0:\n\n- f(1,0) = f(0,1) = 2 (from above, since f(0,1)=2)\n\nFor j=1:\n\n- f(1,1) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0,2) = 3 (since f(1,0)=2, so f(0,2)=3)\n\nFor j=2:\n\n- f(1,2) = f(0, f(1,1)) = f(0,3) = 4\n\nFor j=3:\n\n- f(1,3) = f(0, f(1,2)) = f(0,4) = 0\n\nFor j=4:\n\n- f(1,4) = f(0, f(1,3)) = f(0,0) = 1 (since f(1,3)=0, so f(0,0)=1)\n\nSo summarizing for i=1:\n\n- f(1,0)=2\n- f(1,1)=3\n- f(1,2)=4\n- f(1,3)=0\n- f(1,4)=1\n\nHmm, so for i=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,0,1].\n\nNow let's do i=2.
