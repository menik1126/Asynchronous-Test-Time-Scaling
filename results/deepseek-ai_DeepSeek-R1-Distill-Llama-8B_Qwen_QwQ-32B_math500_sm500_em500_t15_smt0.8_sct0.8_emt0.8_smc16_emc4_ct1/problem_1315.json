            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. A point is randomly chosen inside the rectangle, and we need to find the probability that it's closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the rectangle. Let me consider the rectangle ABCD, where O is the center. So, AB and AD are the lengths of the sides, with AB being the length and AD being the width. The ratio AB/AD is given as k, so if I let AB = k units, then AD would be 1 unit, but maybe it's better to assign specific lengths to make calculations easier. Let me denote AB = k and AD = 1; that way, the ratio is k, and I can work with easier numbers.\n\nSince O is the center, its coordinates would be the midpoint of both diagonals. If I place the rectangle on a coordinate system with O at (0,0), then the coordinates of the rectangle's vertices would be: A(-k/2, 1/2), B(k/2, 1/2), C(k/2, -1/2), and D(-k/2, -1/2). Wait, is that correct? If the rectangle has length AB = k, then the distance from the center to each side along AB would be k/2, and similarly, the distance from the center to each side along AD (height) would be 1/2. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem is about the set of points inside the rectangle that are closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D. We need to find the area of this set of points and then divide it by the total area of the rectangle to get the probability.\n\nSo, how do I determine the region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex? Well, for any point P(x, y) inside the rectangle, the distance from P to O is sqrt(x² + y²). The distance from P to a vertex, say A, would be sqrt((x + k/2)² + (y - 1/2)²). Similarly, distances to B, C, D can be written as sqrt((x - k/2)² + (y - 1/2)²),"

Wait, but the equations are linear, so the boundaries are straight lines?\n\nWait, but the set of points equidistant to O and a vertex is a parabola, not a straight line. Wait, but when we squared the distances, maybe the equations turned into linear equations?\n\nHmm, that seems contradictory. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's take the equation for equidistant to O and A:\n\nsqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nx² + y² = (x + k/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\nx² + kx + (k²)/4 + y² - y + 1/4\n\nSubtract left side:\n\n0 = kx - y + (k²)/4 + 1/4\n\nSo, indeed, the equation is linear.

Similarly, lines C and D intersect at ( (k² +1)/(4k), 0 ). So, perhaps the four lines form a diamond shape with vertices at these two points and two others.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find all four intersection points.\n\nWait, lines A and D: Line A is y = kx + c, line D is y = -kx + c.\n\nSet equal: kx + c = -kx + c → 2kx = 0 → x = 0, y = c.\n\nSo, that's the same as lines A and B intersecting at (0, c).\n\nSimilarly, lines C and B: Line C is y = kx - c, line B is y = -kx + c.\n\nSet equal: kx - c = -kx + c → 2kx = 2c → x = c/(k).\n\nThen, y = k*(c/k) - c = c - c = 0. So, point is (c/k, 0).\n\nSimilarly, lines C and D would intersect at x = same as lines A and B, but let's check:\n\nLine C: y = kx - c,\n\nLine D: y = -kx + c.\n\nSet equal: kx - c = -kx + c → 2kx = 2c → x = c/k,\n\ny = k*(c/k) - c = c - c = 0. So, same point as before.\n\nHmm, that seems to suggest that lines C and D also intersect at (c/k, 0), which is the same as lines C and B. So, that suggests that lines A, B intersect at (0, c), and lines C, D, and others intersect at (c/k, 0). Thus, the shape is a kite formed by these four lines, with two vertices at (0, c) and (c/k, 0), but that seems like only two points, so perhaps the other two vertices are where the lines intersect the rectangle.\n\nWait,"

But it should be in the region because it's closer to O than to any vertex.\n\nSo, maybe the inequalities are wrong for point C.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the derivation for point C.\n\nPoint C is at (k/2, -1/2).\n\nThe condition is distance to O < distance to C.\n\nSo, sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt( (x - k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\nSquaring:\n\nx² + y² < (x - k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2\n\nExpand RHS:\n\nx² - kx + (k²)/4 + y² + y + 1/4\n\nSubtract LHS:\n\n0 < -kx + y + (k²)/4 + 1/4\n\nSo, -kx + y + (k² + 1)/4 > 0 → y > kx - (k² +1)/4.\n\nWait, that's different from before.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was y > -kx + (k² +1)/4. That must have been the error. So, for point C, the inequality is y > kx - (k² +1)/4.\n\nSimilarly, for point D, let's check:\n\ndistance to O < distance to D: sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt( (x + k/2)^2 + (y + 1/2)^2 )\n\nSquare:\n\nx² + y² < x² + kx + (k²)/4 + y² + y + 1/4\n\nSubtract LHS:\n\n0 < kx + y + (k² +1)/4 → y > -kx - (k² +1)/4.\n\nSo, correct inequalities for each point:\n\n1. Point A: y < kx + (k² +1)/4,\n\n2. Point B: y < -kx + (k² +1)/4,\n\n3. Point C: y > kx - (k² +1)/4,\n\n4. Point D: y > -kx - (k² +"
