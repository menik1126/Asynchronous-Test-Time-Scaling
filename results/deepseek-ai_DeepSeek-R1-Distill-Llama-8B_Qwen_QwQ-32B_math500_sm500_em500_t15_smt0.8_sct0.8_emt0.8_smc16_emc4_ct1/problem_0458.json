Hmm, this looks like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember from my math classes that when dealing with optimization under constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be useful, but since all variables are positive, maybe I can also use the AM-GM inequality somewhere. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraint \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). This seems a bit complicated because it involves both the product of variables and their sum. Maybe I can find a way to express this in terms that would make applying AM-GM easier. Alternatively, I could try to express one variable in terms of the others using the constraint and substitute it into the expression I need to minimize.\n\nLet me write down the expression I need to minimize: \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Let me expand this to see if it can lead me somewhere. Expanding gives:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz\n\\]\n\nSo, \\((x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz\\). That's interesting because the term \\(y(x + y + z)\\) is part of the constraint \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). Maybe I can relate these two expressions.\n\nGiven the constraint \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), I can solve for \\(x + y + z\\) to express it in terms of the product \\(xyz\\):\n\n\\[\nx + y + z = \\frac{1}{xyz}\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting this into the expression for \\((x + y)(y + z)\\):\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y \\cdot \\frac{1}{xyz} + xz = \\frac{1}{xz} + xz\n\\]\n\nSo, now the expression to minimize becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{xz} + xz\n\\]\n\nHmm, that looks like something I can apply AM-GM inequality on. The AM-GM inequality states that for positive"
