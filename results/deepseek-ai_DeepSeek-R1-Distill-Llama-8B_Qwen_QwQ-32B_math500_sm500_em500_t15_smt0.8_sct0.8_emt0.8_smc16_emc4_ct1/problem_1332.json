I remember that when dealing with equations like this, especially with multiple terms, it might be helpful to find a common denominator or maybe manipulate the equation into a more manageable form. But I'm not sure exactly how to approach it yet.\n\nFirst, let me think about the left side. Each term is of the form \\( \\frac{k}{x^2 - k} \\) where k is 1, 2, 3, 4. So, each term can be rewritten as \\( \\frac{k}{(x - \\sqrt{k})(x + \\sqrt{k})} \\). That factorization might come in handy later, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe I can combine all the terms on the left side into a single fraction. To do that, I would need a common denominator, which would be the product of all the denominators: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). That seems like a huge expression, but perhaps it's necessary.\n\nSo, if I combine them, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)}{(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nWow, that numerator is going to be a mess.

The left side has terms like 1/(x\u00b2 - k), which reminds me of the derivative of something. But I don't know if that's useful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the left side is the sum of 1/(x\u00b2 - k) multiplied by coefficients.

Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of x^8 in the right side is:\n\nThe right side is (2010x -4)*(product). The product has terms up to x^8. So, the x^8 term in the product is the leading term, which is x^8. Therefore, multiplying by 2010x gives 2010x * x^8 = 2010x^9, and multiplying by -4 gives -4*x^8. Therefore, the coefficient of x^8 in the right side is -4*(coefficient of x^8 in the product). But the coefficient of x^8 in the product is 1 (since it's (x\u00b2)^4). Wait, actually, the coefficient of x^8 in the product (x\u00b2 -1)(x\u00b2 -2)(x\u00b2 -3)(x\u00b2 -4) is 1, because each term is x\u00b2 minus something, so when multiplied, the leading term is x^8. So, the coefficient is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of x^8 in the right side is -4*1 = -4. But also, the 2010x term multiplied by the x^7 term (which is zero) gives nothing. So, the total coefficient of x^8 in the right side is -4.\n\nTherefore, when moving everything to the left side, the equation becomes:\n\nLeft side (which has no x^8 term) minus right side gives:\n\n-2010x^9 - (-4)x^8 + ... (other terms) + (left side terms) = 0.\n\nWait"

(lower degree terms) +10x\u2076 -70x\u2074 +150x\u00b2 -96 = 0\n\nBut for the purposes of Vieta's formula, the sum of roots is - (coefficient of x\u2078) / (coefficient of x\u2079). But here, the coefficient of x\u2079 is -2010, and coefficient of x\u2078 is +4.\n\nSo, sum of roots = -4 / (-2010) = 4 / 2010 = 2 / 1005.\n\nSimplify 2/1005: Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(2,1005)=1, so remains 2/1005.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Since the polynomial is degree 9, the sum of all roots is - (coefficient of x\u2078) / (coefficient of x\u2079). So, yes, coefficient of x\u2079 is -2010, coefficient of x\u2078 is 4, so sum is -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The original equation is equal to zero, which is a 9th-degree polynomial. But if the equation comes from substitution y = x\u00b2, we might have introduced extraneous roots or perhaps some roots that were solutions to y = x\u00b2. So, do I need to worry about multiplicities or other roots?\n\nWait, but in the equation, we have y = x\u00b2, so for each y, there are two x's (positive and negative square roots) unless y=0, which is a double root.

So, the polynomial is:\n\n-2010x^9 +4x^8 + ... =0\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^9 is -2010, coefficient of x^8 is +4. So, the sum of roots is - (4)/(-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005. So, 2/1005 simplifies to 2/1005, which is the answer?\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is that when we cross-multiplied, we might have introduced extraneous roots from the denominators. The original equation has denominators x\u00b2 -1, x\u00b2 -2, etc., so x cannot be \u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12. So, those values are excluded from the domain. Therefore, the polynomial equation of degree 9 includes those roots, but they are not solutions to the original equation.

Therefore, the polynomial equation has 9 roots, but 8 of them are excluded, so only 1 root is valid? That can't be right.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"sum of all complex solutions\". So, even though some roots are excluded due to the denominators, the question is asking for the sum of the roots that are actually solutions.

Hmm.\n\nBut maybe Vieta's formula already accounts for all roots, and since the original equation is a polynomial equation, the excluded roots wouldn't be roots of the original equation, but they are roots of the polynomial equation we constructed.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused something.\n\nWait, the original equation is a rational equation, which we converted into a polynomial equation. The polynomial equation will have all roots that satisfy the rational equation, including roots that make denominators zero, but since in the rational equation, the denominators cannot be zero, so those roots are not actually solutions to the original equation. Therefore, the polynomial equation has 9 roots, but only some of them are valid. So, Vieta's formula gives the sum of all 9 roots, but actually, only some of them are solutions. Therefore, to get the sum of solutions, I need to exclude the sum of roots that make denominators zero.\n\nBut that complicates things, because I don't know which roots correspond to which denominators. It might be too involved. So, maybe the problem is constructed in such a way that all the excluded roots have a combined sum that cancels out with something, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation's leading coefficients and terms interact in such a way that the sum remains 2/1005 regardless of the excluded roots.\n\nWait, but wait: in the original equation, all the denominators are x\u00b2 -k, so the roots that are excluded are x=\u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12. So, all those are real roots, right? So, the original equation is defined for all x except those values. So, the polynomial equation we formed includes all of these as roots (actually, each excluded root would make the original equation undefined). So, if the original equation is supposed to have solutions, then the polynomial equation's roots that coincide with the excluded roots are to be discarded.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the actual solutions are the roots of the polynomial equation that are not x = \u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12.\n\nTherefore, to compute their sum, we need to know the sum of all roots of the polynomial equation minus the sum of the roots that are among x = \u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, etc.\n\nSo, let me think: in the polynomial equation, the coefficient of x^8 is +4"

Wait, but 1005 divided by 5 is 201, so 1005 = 5\u00d7201, and 201 is 3\u00d767. So, 2/1005 can't be simplified further.
