It's a rational equation with multiple terms on the left side and a linear term on the right. I remember that for equations like this, one approach is to manipulate them into a form that can be transformed into a polynomial equation, which might be easier to solve.\n\nFirst, let me note that the denominators on the left are \\(x^2 - n\\) where \\(n\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4, and the numerators are 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. So, each term is of the form \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\), where \\(k\\) is 1 to 4.\n\nI wonder if there's a substitution that can simplify this. Let me let \\(y = x^2\\), but then I realize that when I do that, each denominator becomes \\(y - k\\). So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nBut wait, \\(y = x^2\\), so substituting that in doesn't directly help because of the term \\(2010x\\) on the right. That still has an \\(x\\) term, which isn't simplified in terms of \\(y\\). So maybe substitution isn't the way to go.\n\nAnother thought: Perhaps cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominators. If I can bring everything to one side and get a single equation, maybe I can find a common denominator.\n\nLet me try that. Let me define the entire left-hand side (LHS) as a single fraction. The LHS is a sum of four fractions, so the common denominator would be the product of all denominators: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). That"

Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I denote \\(y = x^2\\), then the LHS becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4}.\n\\]\n\nPerhaps I can compute that expression first in terms of y, then set it equal to \\(2010x - 4\\), but then I still have a problem with the right-hand side (RHS) having an x and not a y. Hmm.\n\nWait, but \\(y = x^2\\), so x can be expressed as \\(\\sqrt{y}\\) or \\(-\\sqrt{y}\\), but that complicates things because of the square roots. Maybe it's better not to substitute here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtract the RHS from the LHS and set the equation equal to zero, then combine all terms into one fraction. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, moving all terms to the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow, to combine these terms, I need a common denominator. The denominators on the first four terms are all \\(x^2 - k\\), so the common denominator is the product of all four denominators: \\( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \\). But then the terms without denominators (the linear terms) would also need to be multiplied by that denominator to get everything over the common denominator. That might result in a polynomial equation of degree... let me see. The denominator is degree 8, so when multiplied by the numerator terms which are degree 1 (the linear terms), the overall equation would be degree 9? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the coefficients. Let's see:\n\nThe numerators are 1, 2, 3, 4, and denominators are \\(x^2 - 1, x"

Maybe consider that \\(x^2 - k = (x - \\sqrt{k})(x + \\sqrt{k})\\), but I don't know if that helps.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the equation can be manipulated by substitution. Let me think about the equation:\n\nLet me denote \\(t = x^2\\). Then, maybe express the equation in terms of t?\n\nBut then, the LHS becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{t - 1} + \\frac{2}{t - 2} + \\frac{3}{t - 3} + \\frac{4}{t - 4}\n\\]\n\nAnd the RHS is \\(2010x - 4\\). Hmm. But t is \\(x^2\\), so maybe I can express x in terms of t, but t is non-negative if x is real, but we might have complex solutions as well. Hmm, but thinking in terms of t might not resolve the x in the RHS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the function on the LHS as a sum of functions. Maybe partial fractions? But the denominators are all different, so perhaps it's a bit more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function on the LHS can be expressed as a simpler function.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe cross-multiplying the entire equation.

For example, the first term is D/(x^2 -1) *1, which is equal to (x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). Similarly, the second term is 2*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4), and so on.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand side becomes:\n\n(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 2(x^"

Therefore, the polynomial equation (LHS - RHS)*D=0 has roots:\n\n- Solutions of the original equation,\n\n- And solutions of D=0.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial equation includes all roots of original equation plus the roots of D=0. Therefore, the sum of all roots of the polynomial is equal to sum_original + sum_D_roots.\n\nWe found sum_polynomial = 2/1005.\n\nsum_D_roots is zero, as we saw.\n\nThus, sum_original = sum_polynomial - sum_D_roots = 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions (including x=0) is 2/1005.\n\nHence, the final answer is 2/1005, which is equal to 2/1005.\n\nBut to confirm, let me see. Because the original equation's solutions are all roots of the polynomial except the D=0 roots, but x=0 is a solution, so in the polynomial, the roots are the original solutions plus the D=0 roots.\n\nWait, yes, so the sum of original solutions is sum_polynomial - sum_D_roots, which is 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of all complex solutions of the given equation is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{1005}}\\)."
