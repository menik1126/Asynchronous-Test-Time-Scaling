Setting this equal to 199 gives:\n2n - 1 = 199\nSolving for n, I add 1 to both sides:\n2n = 200\nThen divide by 2:\nn = 100\n\nSo, there are 100 terms in total.\n\nNext, I recall that the sum of the first n odd numbers can be calculated using the formula:\nSum = n²\n\nApplying this to our series:\nSum = 100² = 10,000\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I perform the division:\n10,000 ÷ 7 = 1,428 with a remainder of 4\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum \\( 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 199 \\) is divided by 7, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Number of Terms\nThe series consists of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 and ending at 199. The \\( n \\)-th odd number can be expressed as:\n\\[\n2n - 1\n\\]\nSet this equal to 199 to find \\( n \\):\n\\[\n2n - 1 = 199\n\\]\n\\[\n2n = 200\n\\]\n\\[\nn = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are **100 terms** in the series.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of the Series\nThe sum \\( S \\) of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is given by:\n\\[\nS = n^2\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( n = 100 \\):\n\\[\nS = 100^2 = 10,\\!000\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Remainder When Divided by 7\nNow, we need to find \\( 10,\\!000 \\mod 7 \\):\n\\[\n10,\\!000 \\div"
