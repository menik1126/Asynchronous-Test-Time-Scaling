            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of terms in the arithmetic series 1, 3, 5, ..., 199. Since the common difference is 2, the series consists of consecutive odd numbers. The nth term of an odd number series can be expressed as 2n - 1. Setting this equal to 199 gives \\(2n - 1 = 199\\), solving for n yields \\(n = 100\\). So, there are 100 terms in the series.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of these terms using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\(S = \\frac{n}{2}(first\\ term + last\\ term)\\). Plugging in the values, the sum \\(S = \\frac{100}{2}(1 + 199) = 50 \\times 200 = 10,000\\).\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 7, I'll compute \\(10,000 \\mod 7\\). Dividing 10,000 by 7 gives a quotient of 1,428 with a remainder of 3. Therefore, the modulo 7 remainder of the sum is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Number of Terms\nThe given series is an arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd numbers starting from \\(1\\) and ending at \\(199\\). \n\n- **First term (\\(a_1\\))**: \\(1\\)\n- **Last term (\\(a_n\\))**: \\(199\\)\n- **Common difference (\\(d\\))**: \\(2\\) (since each term increases by \\(2\\))\n\nThe \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n198 = (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\nn - 1 = 99 \\\\\nn = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are **100 terms** in the series.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Sum of the Series\nThe sum \\(S\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of"
