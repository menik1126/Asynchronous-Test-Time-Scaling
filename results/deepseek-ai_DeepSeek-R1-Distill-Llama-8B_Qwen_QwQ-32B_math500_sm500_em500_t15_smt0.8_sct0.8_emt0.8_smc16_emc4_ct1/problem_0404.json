Gear 2 turns 45 times every minute.\n\nSince both gears start with their marks pointing north, they'll align again when the number of rotations each makes is an integer. This means I need to find a common multiple of their rotation cycles.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 200 and 45 is 3600. This tells me that after 3600 seconds, both gears will be pointing north again.\n\nFinally, converting 3600 seconds to minutes gives me 60 minutes. Therefore, the gears will align after 3600 seconds.\n</think>\n\nTo determine after how many seconds both gears will next point their marks due north, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Rotation Rates\n- **Gear 1:** Turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute.\n  \\[\n  33\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\text{ rotations per minute}\n  \\]\n- **Gear 2:** Turns 45 times per minute.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Rotation Rates to Seconds\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute.\n\n- **Gear 1:**\n  \\[\n  \\frac{100}{3} \\text{ rotations per minute} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds per minute} = 200 \\text{ rotations per second}\n  \\]\n- **Gear 2:**\n  \\[\n  45 \\text{ rotations per minute} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds per minute} = 2700 \\text{ rotations per second}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)\nTo find when both gears align, find the LCM of their rotation rates.\n\n- **Gear 1:** 200 rotations per second\n- **Gear 2:** 2700 rotations per second\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM of } 200 \\text{ and } 2700 = 3600 \\text{ rotations}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Convert LCM to Seconds\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{LCM of Rotations}}{\\text{Rotations per Second"

The LCM here should be computed between the times it takes each gear to complete one full rotation (i.e., their periods), not between the numerical rotations per second. Let's correct this.\n\n### Corrected Step 3:\nCompute the **period** (time for one rotation):\n\n- **Gear 1 Period:**\n  \\[\n  T_1 = \\frac{60 \\text{ seconds}}{\\frac{100}{3} \\text{ rotations per minute}} = \\frac{60}{100/3} = \\frac{180}{100} = 1.8 \\text{ seconds per rotation}\n  \\]\n  \n- **Gear 2 Period:**\n  \\[\n  T_2 = \\frac{60 \\text{ seconds}}{45 \\text{ rotations per minute}} = \\frac{60}{45} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ seconds per rotation}\n  \\]\n\nThe LCM of the two periods (expressed as fractions):\n- \\( T_1 = \\frac{9}{5} \\) seconds\n- \\( T_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds\n\nConvert to integers for LCM calculation:\n- Multiply both periods by 15 (the LCM of denominators 5 and 3) to eliminate fractions:\n  \\[\n  T_1 = \\frac{9}{5} \\times 15 = 27, \\quad T_2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 15 = 20\n  \\]\n  \nLCM of 27 and 20:\n- Prime factors:\n  - 27 = 3\u00b3\n  - 20 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5\n- LCM = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b3 \u00d7 5 = 4 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 5 = 540\n- Divide by the earlier factor (15):\n  \\[\n  \\text{LCM}(T_1, T_2) = \\frac{540}{15} = 36 \\text{ seconds}\n  \\]\n\nWait, this also seems conflicting."

Alternatively, think in terms of periods.\n\nThe LCM of the periods (1.8 and 1.333...) is the smallest time where both have completed an integer number of rotations.\n\nLet me compute LCM of 1.8 and 1.333...:\n\nConvert to fractions:\n\n1.8 = 9/5, 1.333... = 4/3.\n\nThe LCM of two fractions is LCM(9,4)/GCD(5,3) = 36/1 = 36 seconds.\n\nWait, LCM(a/b, c/d) = LCM(a,c)/GCD(b,d).\n\nYes, formula is LCM(a/b, c/d) = LCM(a,c)/GCD(b,d).\n\nSo LCM(9/5, 4/3) = LCM(9,4)/GCD(5,3) = 36/1 = 36 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36 seconds.\n\nWait, but let me verify:\n\nAfter 36 seconds:\n\nGear 1 rotations: 36 / (9/5) = 36*(5/9)=20 rotations (integer).\n\nGear 2 rotations: 36 / (4/3)=36*(3/4)=27 rotations (integer).\n\nYes, so 36 seconds is correct.\n\nBut let me check with the original rotation rates:\n\nGear 1: 33 1/3 per minute = 100/3 per minute. In 36 seconds (which is 0.6 minutes):\n\n(100/3)*0.6 = 20 rotations.\n\nGear 2: 45 per minute. In 0.6 minutes: 45*0.6 = 27 rotations.\n\nYes, both integers. So 36 seconds is correct.\n\nBut why"
