            "output": "I need to simplify the expression (10r³)(4r⁶) divided by 8r⁴. First, I'll multiply the numerators: 10 times 4 is 40, and r³ times r⁶ is r⁹. So the expression becomes 40r⁹ over 8r⁴.\n\nNext, I'll simplify the coefficients by dividing 40 by 8, which equals 5. Now the expression is 5r⁵, since r⁹ divided by r⁴ is r⁵. Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is 5r⁵.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators:**\n   \\[\n   (10r^3)(4r^6) = 10 \\times 4 \\times r^3 \\times r^6 = 40r^{3+6} = 40r^9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide the denominators:**\n   \\[\n   8r^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40r^9}{8r^4} = \\frac{40}{8} \\times \\frac{r^9}{r^4} = 5 \\times r^{9-4} = 5r^5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Simplified Expression:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{5r^5}\n   \\]"
