            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that ω is a cube root of unity, which means it's one of the solutions to the equation x³ = 1. The cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. I also recall that these roots satisfy certain properties, like ω³ = 1 and ω² + ω + 1 = 0. Yeah, that seems right because if you factor x³ - 1, you get (x - 1)(x² + x + 1), so the non-real roots satisfy x² + x + 1 = 0.\n\nSo, knowing that ω² + ω + 1 = 0 might help simplify the expression. Let me write down the expression:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²)\n\nMaybe I can combine these two fractions into one to simplify. To add them, I need a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute that denominator first.\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω²\n= 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut wait, ω³ is 1, right? So that becomes:\n\n1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nHmm, okay, so the denominator is 2 + ω + ω². But from earlier, I know that ω² + ω + 1 = 0. So substituting that in, 2 + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (-1) = 1. Oh, nice, the denominator simplifies to 1.\n\nNow, what about the numerator? The numerator is the sum of the two fractions, so:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = [1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω)] / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)]\n= (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) / 1\n="

            "output": " (2 + ω + ω²)\n\nWait, that's the same as the denominator we had earlier, which is 1. So the entire expression simplifies to 2 + ω + ω², but we know that ω² + ω = -1, so 2 + (-1) = 1. So, is it 1? But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the numerator. Let me redo that step:\n\nAfter finding the denominator is 1, let me compute the numerator:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = [1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω)] / [denominator]\n= (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) / 1\n= 2 + ω + ω²\n\nAnd since ω² + ω = -1, then 2 + (-1) = 1. So the value is 1.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother method could be to express ω in terms of its real and imaginary parts, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 1/(1 + ω) can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by (1 - ω), similar for 1/(1 + ω²) by multiplying by (1 - ω²).\n\nLet me try this:\n\n1/(1 + ω) = [1*(1 - ω)] / [(1 + ω)(1 - ω)] = (1 - ω)/(1 - ω²)\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = [1*(1 - ω²)] / [(1 + ω²)(1 - ω²)] = (1 - ω²)/(1 - ω)\n\nNow, let's compute each:\n\nFirst term: (1 - ω)/(1 - ω²)\nSecond term: (1 - ω²)/(1 - ω)\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\n(1 - ω)/(1 - ω²) + (1 - ω²)/(1 - ω) = ?\n\nLet me find a common denominator, which would be (1 - ω²)(1 - ω). So:\n\n[(1 - ω)² + (1 - ω²)²] / [(1 - ω²)(1 - ω)]\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\n(1 - 2ω + ω²) + (1 -"

            "output": " 2ω² + ω⁴)\n\nWait, but ω⁴ is ω^(3+1) = ω^3 * ω = 1*ω = ω. So ω⁴ = ω.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n(1 - 2ω + ω²) + (1 - 2ω² + ω)\n= 1 - 2ω + ω² + 1 - 2ω² + ω\n= (1 + 1) + (-2ω + ω) + (ω² - 2ω²)\n= 2 - ω - ω²\n\nHmm, so numerator is 2 - ω - ω². The denominator is (1 - ω²)(1 - ω). Let me compute the denominator:\n\n(1 - ω²)(1 - ω) = 1*(1 - ω) - ω²*(1 - ω) = 1 - ω - ω² + ω³\n\nAgain, ω³ = 1, so this becomes:\n\n1 - ω - ω² + 1 = 2 - ω - ω²\n\nSo denominator is also 2 - ω - ω². Therefore, the entire expression is (2 - ω - ω²)/(2 - ω - ω²) = 1. So that's the same result as before. So that's good, so the expression simplifies to 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all possible values\". Since ω is a cube root of unity, but not equal to 1, so ω can be either ω or ω². But does the expression depend on which one we choose?\n\nWait, let me check with specific values. Let me take ω = e^(2πi/3), which is a primitive cube root of unity. Then ω² = e^(4πi/3). Let me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nAlternatively, maybe plugging in numerical values would help. Let me compute numerically.\n\nLet me recall that ω = -1/2 + i√3/2, and ω² = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo let's compute 1/(1 +"

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):\n\n2*(1 - i√3) / [(1 + i√3)(1 - i√3)] = 2*(1 - i√3)/ (1 + 3) = (2 - 2i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1 - 1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2).

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i√3):\n\n2*(1 + i√3)/(1 + 3) = (2 + 2i√3)/4 = (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nNow, adding these two results:\n\n(1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = [1 + 1]/2 + [-i√3 + i√3]/2 = 2/2 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo, whether we take ω or ω², the expression equals 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values\", implying there might be more than one. But in this case, it seems like the expression always evaluates to 1, regardless of the value of ω (as long as ω³ = 1 and ω ≠ 1). So, perhaps 1 is the only possible value.\n\nLet me just think if there's any other approach that might suggest otherwise, but I don't think so. Since ω and ω² are conjugates, and the expression is symmetric in ω and ω², the result would be the same for either. So, I don't think there are multiple possible values. Hence, the only possible value is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\(\\omega\\) is a complex number such that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\"
