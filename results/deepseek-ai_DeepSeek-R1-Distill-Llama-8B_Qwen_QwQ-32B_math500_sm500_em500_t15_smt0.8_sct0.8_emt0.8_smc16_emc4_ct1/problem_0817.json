            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number satisfying ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, ω can be either of the non-real cube roots. That means I might have to consider two cases: one where ω is the primitive cube root, and another where it's the other primitive one. But maybe there's a smarter way than considering two cases. Let me think.\n\nI also recall that for cube roots of unity, the sum ω + ω² + 1 = 0. That's a useful identity. Maybe that can help simplify the expression somehow.\n\nSo, the expression I need to evaluate is S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I wonder if I can combine these two fractions into one. Let me try that.\n\nTo add the two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's compute the numerator:\n\n1 · (1 + ω²) + 1 · (1 + ω) = (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo, S = [2 + ω + ω²] / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)]. \n\nNow, from the identity I mentioned earlier, ω + ω² = -1. So, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 - 1 = 1. That simplifies the numerator to 1.\n\nNow, let's work on the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let's expand that.\n\n1 · 1 = 1\n1 · ω² = ω²\nω · 1 = ω\nω · ω² = ω³\n\nSo, the expanded denominator is 1 + ω² + ω + ω³. But since ω³ = 1, this becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω +"

Wait, that can't be right because sometimes these expressions might have different values depending on ω, but in this case since it's symmetric, maybe it's always 1.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I combined the fractions:\n\n[ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ] = [2 + ω + ω²] / [denominator].\n\nThen, ω + ω² = -1, so numerator is 1. Then denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Which expands to 1 + ω + ω² + ω³ = 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω² = 1. So denominator is 1. Therefore, S = 1/1 = 1.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So the value is always 1 regardless of which primitive cube root ω is.\n\nWait, but let me test it with actual numbers. Let's take ω = e^(2πi/3) which is (-1/2) + i(√3/2). Then compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2. To compute 1/(1 + ω), let's find its reciprocal. The modulus of 1 + ω is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. The argument is arctan( (√3/2) / (1/2) ) = arctan(√3) = π/3. So, 1/(1 + ω) has modulus 1 and argument -π/3, which is (1/2 - i√3/2).\n\nSimilarly, compute 1 + ω². ω² is e^(4πi/"

Therefore, adding them together, 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) is (1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 - i√3/2) = 1 - i√3.\n\nBut wait, that's a complex number, but in my earlier algebraic approach, I got S = 1, which is real. That's a contradiction. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my algebraic calculation.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check: 1 + ω is (1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2)) = (1/2 + i√3/2). Its reciprocal is (1/(1/2 + i√3/2)). Multiply numerator and denominator by (1/2 - i√3/2), so denominator becomes (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, it's (1/2 - i√3/2). Similarly for 1/(1 + ω²): same calculation, same result.\n\nSo, both 1/(1 + ω) and 1/(1 + ω²) are (1/2 - i√3/2). So adding them, I get 1 - i√3. But that suggests that S = 1 - i√3, which is a complex number, but in my algebraic approach, I got S = 1, which is real. There's a conflict here. So, clearly, I made an error in my algebra.\n\nWait, perhaps in the denominator expansion. Let me go back.\n\nSo, in S = [2 + ω + ω²] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ], and 2 + ω + ω² = 1, as ω + ω² = -1. So numerator is 1.\n\nDenominator:"

Then, since ω + ω² = -1, that's 2 + (-1) = 1. So denominator is 1. So S = 1/1 = 1. But when I plug in the actual value, I get 1 - i√3. That's a problem.\n\nWait, so which one is correct? Let me compute numerically:\n\nLet me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) with ω = e^(2πi/3).\n\nFirst, ω = -1/2 + i√3/2. Then 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2. The reciprocal of this is (1/2 - i√3/2) divided by ( (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) which is 1, so reciprocal is (1/2 - i√3/2).\n\nSimilarly, ω² = (-1/2 - i√3/2). So 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2. Its reciprocal is (1/2 + i√3/2) divided by 1, so (1/2 + i√3/2).\n\nWait a second! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the reciprocal of (1 + ω²). \n\nWait, 1 + ω² is 1/2 - i√3/2.

Adding them together gives 1/2 - i√3/2 + 1/2 + i√3/2 = (1/2 + 1/2) + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1. \n\nAh, okay, that's consistent with my algebraic result! So S = 1. So in my earlier calculation, I must have miscalculated 1/(1 + ω²). I thought it was (1/2 - i√3/2), but actually, it's (1/2 + i√3/2). So adding them gives 1.\n\nTherefore, the expression S = 1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Since ω can be either the primitive cube roots, in one case, is it possible that depending on ω, the expression could take different values? Or in both cases, it's always 1.\n\nWait, when I calculated with ω = e^(2πi/3), S was 1. What if I took ω = e^(4πi/3), which is the other primitive cube root. Let me check.\n\nLet ω = e^(4πi/3) = (-1/2 - i√3/2). Then 1 + ω = 1 - 1/2 - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nThe reciprocal of that is (1/2 + i√3/2) / 1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, ω² = e^(8πi/3) = e^(2πi/3) = (-1/2 + i√3/2).

So again, S = 1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of which primitive cube root ω we take, the value of the expression is 1. So, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, so in my first calculation, I miscalculated 1/(1 + ω²). Initially, I thought it was (1/2 - i√3/2), but actually, it's (1/2 + i√3/2). So, adding the two terms gives 1, which matches the algebraic result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a smarter way is to use substitution. Let me let x = 1 + ω, then ω² = ?\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider the minimal polynomial. Since ω³ = 1 and ω ≠ 1, then ω² + ω + 1 = 0. So, ω² = -1 - ω. Maybe substitute that into the expression.\n\nSo, expression S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + (-1 - ω)) = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(-ω). \n\nSo, S = 1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω. \n\nHmm, maybe that can be manipulated.\n\nExpress 1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω = [ ω - (1 + ω) ] / [ω(1 + ω)] = (ω - 1 - ω) / [ω(1 + ω)] = (-1)/[ω(1 + ω)].\n\nSo, S = -1/[ω(1 + ω)].

Therefore, S = 1.\n\nThat's a more straightforward approach.
