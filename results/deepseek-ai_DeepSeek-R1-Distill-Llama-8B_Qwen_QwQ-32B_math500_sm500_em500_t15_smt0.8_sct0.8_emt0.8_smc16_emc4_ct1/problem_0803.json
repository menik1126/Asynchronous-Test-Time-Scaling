Given that the leading coefficient a_n is 2 and the constant term a_0 is 66. We need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials with integer coefficients and integer roots, the roots must divide the constant term. That's from the Integer Root Theorem. So, the possible roots are the divisors of 66. Let me list those out.\n\n66 can be factored into prime factors as 2 * 3 * 11. So, the divisors are all the products of these primes in various combinations. That would give us: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, and ±66.\n\nSince all roots are distinct integers, we need to choose a set of these divisors such that when we multiply them together (with signs) and set the polynomial's leading coefficient to 2, the resulting polynomial has integer coefficients. Also, the coefficient a_{n-1} is the negative of the sum of the roots (times -1 for quadratics and higher, but I need to check).\n\nWait, for a general polynomial, if f(x) = 2*(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn), then expanding it, the coefficient a_{n-1} would be 2*(-1)^{1}*(sum of roots). So, it's -2*(sum of roots). So, |a_{n-1}| would be 2*(sum of roots). But wait, is that right?\n\nWait, let's think again. For a monic polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is the negative of the sum of the roots. But since our leading coefficient is 2, the expansion would be 2*(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). So when we expand it, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is 2*(-1)^1*(sum of roots) = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, a_{n-1} is -2*(sum of roots). So, |a_{n-1}| is 2*|sum of roots|.\n\nOur goal is to minimize this value"

But also, the roots must be distinct integers dividing 66, and their product (times the leading coefficient?) must give the constant term 66. Wait, actually, the constant term of the polynomial is 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots). Since the constant term a_0 is 66, so 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66. Therefore, the product of the roots is 66 / [2*(-1)^n] = 33 / (-1)^n. Hmm, so depending on whether n is even or odd, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33.\n\nWait, let me clarify that. Let me write the polynomial as f(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Then expanding this, the constant term is 2*(-r1)*(-r2)*...*(-rn) = 2*(-1)^n*(r1*r2*...*rn). This is equal to a_0 = 66. Therefore, 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66. So, product of roots = 66 / [2*(-1)^n] = 33 / (-1)^n. Therefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. Since the roots are integers, their product must be an integer, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots must be either 33 or -33. Since the roots are distinct integers dividing 66, their product must be a divisor of 66^n? Wait, not exactly. The roots are divisors of 66, so each root divides 66, but their product can be 33 or -33. Let me see.\n\nWait, 33 is a factor of 66, so that's okay. So, the product of the roots must be either 33 or -33. So, we need to choose a set of distinct integers from the divisors of 66 (including negatives) such that their product is either 33 or -33, and then find the set where the"

Wait, actually I was in the product 33 case earlier, but this set gives product -33, so maybe it's in the product -33 case.\n\nHold on, I might have made a mistake here. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the roots are 1, 3, -11, their product is (1)(3)(-11) = -33, so that would be in the case where the product is -33, so then in that case, the product being -33 would mean that the equation for the polynomial requires product of roots (times 2*(-1)^n) equals 66. Let me recall:\n\nproduct of roots is 33 or -33, depending on the parity. So, if the product is -33, then the polynomial is 2*(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn), whose constant term is 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66. So, if product of roots is -33, then 2*(-1)^n*(-33) = 66 → (-1)^{n+1}*66 = 66. So, (-1)^{n+1} = 1. Therefore, n+1 must be even → n is odd.\n\nSimilarly, if product is 33, then 2*(-1)^n*(33)=66 → (-1)^n*66 =66 → (-1)^n =1 → n even.\n\nSo, in any case, depending on whether the product is 33 or -33, the number of roots (degree) has to be even or odd. But since we can choose any number of roots as long as they are distinct and their product is 33 or -33, so the number of terms depends on that product.\n\nBut back to the example of roots 1,3,-11.

Now, let's check if there are other three-root sets.\n\nFor example, { -1, -3, 11 }, product (-1)(-3)(11)=33, which would make n even, then the constant term is 2*(-1)^n*(product)= 2*(1)*(33)=66, which matches. The sum is (-1) + (-3) +11=7. So, |a_{n-1}|=14.\n\nAlternatively, { -1, 3, 11 }, product (-1)(3)(11)= -33, so n is odd, constant term is 2*(-1)^n*(product)=2*(-1)^{odd}*(-33)=2*(-1)*(-33)=66. So, yes, that's correct. The sum is (-1)+3+11=13, |sum|=13, so |a|=26.\n\nSimilarly, {1, -3, 11}, sum=9, |sum|=9, product=1*(-3)*11=-33, so n is odd, constant term=66.
