The leading coefficient \\( a_n \\) is 2, and the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is 66. The roots of this polynomial are distinct integers. I need to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nHmm, let me recall that for a polynomial with integer coefficients, if it has integer roots, those roots must be divisors of the constant term \\( a_0 \\), right? So, since \\( a_0 = 66 \\), the possible integer roots are the divisors of 66. Let me list them out: \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66 \\).\n\nNow, since the polynomial has distinct integer roots, I need to select a set of these divisors such that when I multiply them together and multiply by \\( (-1)^k \\cdot 2 \\), I get 66, where \\( k \\) is the number of roots. Wait, actually, the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is equal to \\( a_n \\times (-1)^n \\times \\) product of the roots. Since \\( a_n = 2 \\), that means \\( 66 = 2 \\times (-1)^n \\times r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_k \\). So, the product of the roots times \\( (-1)^n \\) should equal \\( 33 \\).\n\nSo, \\( r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_k = \\pm 33 \\) depending on the parity of \\( k \\) and the sign. But 33 factors into \\( 3 \\times 11 \\), so the roots must be combinations of 1, 3, 11, 33 and their negatives.\n\nSince we need distinct integer roots, let's try to find the minimal \\( |a_{n-1}| \\). I remember that \\( a_{n-1} \\) is related to the sum of the products of the roots taken \\( n-1 \\) at a time, multiplied by \\( (-1)^{n-1}"

Since this polynomial is not monic, but has leading coefficient 2, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nSuppose the polynomial is written as \\( 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\). Then expanding this, the coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) would be \\( 2 \\times (-1)^{n-1} \\times (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n) \\). Wait, let me confirm that.\n\nYes, for a monic polynomial \\( (x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), the coefficient of \\( x^{n-1} \\) is \\( - (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n) \\). So, if the polynomial is multiplied by 2, then the coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) would be \\( 2 \\times (-1)^{n-1} \\times (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n) \\). Wait, actually, hold on. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider the general case. Let the polynomial be \\( a_n \\prod_{i=1}^n (x - r_i) \\). Then expanding this, the coefficient of \\( x^{n-1} \\) is \\( a_n \\times (-1) \\times (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n) \\). Because when you expand the product, the \\( x^{n-1} \\) term comes from choosing one of the \\( -r_i \\) terms and the rest \\( x \\). So the coefficient is \\( a_n \\times (- \\sum r_i) \\). Therefore, \\( a_{n-1} = -a_n \\times (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n) \\).\n\nWait, so that's simpler. So, \\( a_{n-1} = -2 \\times (sum \\, of \\, roots) \\).

So, to minimize \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), I need to minimize \\( |sum \\, of \\, roots| \\).\n\nSo, the task reduces to finding a set of distinct integer divisors of 66 (from the list I made earlier) such that their product is \\( \\pm 33 \\) (since \\( 66 = 2 \\times 33 \\)) and the sum of these roots is as close to zero as possible. Because \\( |sum| \\) being small will make \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) small.\n\nWait, but the product of the roots is \\( \\pm 33 \\), and each root is a divisor of 66, so the roots can be \\( \\pm1, \\pm3, \\pm11, \\pm33 \\).\n\nSince the roots must multiply to \\( \\pm33 \\), let's think about possible combinations of these numbers. We need distinct integers, so let me list the possible sets.\n\nFirst, note that 33 is positive, so the product can be positive or negative depending on the number of negative roots.\n\nSince 33 is positive, an even number of negative roots would give a positive product, and an odd number would give a negative product. So, depending on the desired product sign, but since 33 is positive, whether we take an even or odd number of negative roots.\n\nBut in any case, the product of the roots is going to be 33 or -33.\n\nSo, our job is to choose a set of distinct integer divisors of 66 whose product is 33 or -33, and the sum is as small as possible in absolute value.\n\nLet me consider that 33 factors as 3*11, or 1*3*11, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps using the smallest possible numbers in magnitude.\n\nLet me try starting with the smallest possible roots.\n\nCase 1: Only 1, 3, 11.\n\nBut 1*3*11 = 33. So, the sum is 1 + 3 + 11 = 15. So, |sum| is 15.

The roots of this polynomial are distinct integers.\n\nFirst, we note that the constant term \\( a_0 = 66 \\) implies that the possible integer roots are the divisors of 66: \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66 \\).\n\nUsing Vieta's formulas, the coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) is related to the sum of the roots. Specifically, \\( a_{n-1} = -2 \\times (\\text{sum of the roots}) \\). Therefore, to minimize \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots.\n\nWe consider the product of the roots, which must be \\( \\pm33 \\) (since \\( 66 = 2 \\times 33 \\)). The factors of 33 are 1, 3, 11, and 33, as well as their negatives. We need to find distinct sets of these factors whose product is \\( \\pm33 \\) and whose sum is minimized.\n\nAfter evaluating various combinations, we find that the set of roots \\(-1, -3, 11\\) or \\(-1, 1, -11\\) gives a product of 33 or -33 and a sum of -7 or 7, respectively. The absolute value of this sum is"
