            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the modulus of w, where w is defined as (3z + 1)/(5z + 7), and z is given as 1 + i. Hmm, alright, let me start by recalling what the modulus of a complex number is. If I have a complex number like a + bi, the modulus is the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So, |z| would be sqrt(1^2 + 1^2), which is sqrt(2). But in this case, I need to find |w|, which is the modulus of a fraction. I think there's a property of complex numbers that says the modulus of a quotient is the quotient of the moduli. So, |w| = |3z + 1| / |5z + 7|. That seems right. \n\nSo, now I need to compute |3z + 1| and |5z + 7|. Let me first compute 3z + 1. Since z is 1 + i, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i. Then adding 1 gives (3 + 1) + 3i = 4 + 3i. So, 3z + 1 is 4 + 3i. Therefore, |3z + 1| is the modulus of 4 + 3i, which is sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5. Got that part.\n\nNow, moving on to 5z + 7. Let me compute that. z is 1 + i, so 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i. Adding 7 gives (5 + 7) + 5i = 12 + 5i. So, 5z + 7 is 12 + 5i. The modulus of that would be sqrt(12^2 + 5^2). Calculating that, 12 squared is 144, and 5 squared is 25, so adding them gives 169. The square root of 169 is 13. So, |5z + 7| is 13.\n\nPutting it all together, |w| = |3z + 1| / |5z + 7|"

Calculating 3z + 1 as 4 + 3i, modulus 5, and 5z + 7 as 12 + 5i, modulus 13. Dividing them gives 5/13. Yep, that seems correct. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors here.
