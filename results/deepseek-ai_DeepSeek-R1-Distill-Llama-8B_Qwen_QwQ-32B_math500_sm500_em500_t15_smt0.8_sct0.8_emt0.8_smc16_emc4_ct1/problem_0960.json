Denali is responsible for 16 dogs, and Nate is responsible for 12 dogs.\n\nUnder the company's new policy, dogs are reassigned in groups of \\( x \\). We need to express the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay both before and after any reassignment and set them equal.\n\nInitially, the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is proportional to the number of dogs they walk, so the ratio is \\( \\frac{16}{12} \\).\n\nAfter \\( 4x \\) more dogs are added to Denali's assignment, Denali will be walking \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs. The ratio remains proportional, so \\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} \\).\n\nAlternatively, if \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali, Denali will walk \\( 16 + x \\) dogs, and Nate will walk \\( 12 - x \\) dogs. The ratio here is \\( \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\).\n\nSince both scenarios result in the same ratio, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n\\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\)\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we'll cross-multiply and simplify the equation.\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( 12(12 - x) \\) gives:\n\n\\( (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 16(16 + x) \\)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\( 192 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 256 + 16x \\)\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\( 192 + 32x - 4x^2 = 256 + 16x \\)\n\nRearranging all terms to one side:\n\n\\( -4x^2 + 16x - 64 = 0 \\)\n\nDividing the entire equation by -4 to simplify:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x + 16 = 0 \\)\n\nFinally, solving the quadratic equation:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 64}}{2} \\)\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions. This indicates that our initial assumption may need revisiting or there's"

Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} \\)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\( (16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x) \\)\n\nWait, no, cross-multiplying should be:\n\nLeft side: (16 + 4x) * (12 - x)\n\nRight side: 12 * (16 + x)\n\nWait, actually, the right side is 12*(16 + x). Let me recalculate the expansion.\n\nLeft side:\n\n16*12 = 192\n\n16*(-x) = -16x\n\n4x*12 = 48x\n\n4x*(-x) = -4x\u00b2\n\nTotal left side: 192 -16x +48x -4x\u00b2 = 192 +32x -4x\u00b2\n\nRight side:\n\n12*(16 +x) = 192 +12x\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n192 +32x -4x\u00b2 = 192 +12x\n\nSubtract 192 from both sides:\n\n32x -4x\u00b2 = 12x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n32x -4x\u00b2 -12x =0 \u2192 20x -4x\u00b2 =0\n\nFactor:\n\n4x(5 -x)=0\n\nThus, solutions are x=0 or x=5. Since x\u22600, the answer is 5.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong before? Probably miscalculating the cross-multiplication step. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n(16 +4x)/12 = (16 +x)/(12 -x)\n\nCross-multiplying gives (16+4x)(12 -x) = 12*(16 +x). Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen expanding left side:\n\n16*12 =192, 16*(-x)= -16x, 4x*12=48x, 4x*(-x)= -4x\u00b2."
