Let's denote Denali's current number of dogs as \\( D = 16 \\) and Nate's current number of dogs as \\( N = 12 \\).\n\nUnder the new policy, Denali and Nate can be reassigned or unassigned dogs in groups of \\( x \\). This means that \\( x \\) represents the number of dogs that can be added or removed from their assignments in each adjustment.\n\nThe problem states two scenarios where the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same:\n\n1. **First Scenario:** Denali is assigned \\( 4x \\) more dogs, while Nate stays at 12 dogs.\n2. **Second Scenario:** \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n\nFor each scenario, I'll set up the ratio of their dogs and equate it to 1 (since the ratio remains the same).\n\n**First Scenario:**\n\\[\n\\frac{D + 4x}{N} = 1\n\\]\nPlugging in the known values:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = 1\n\\]\n\n**Second Scenario:**\n\\[\n\\frac{D + x}{N - x} = 1\n\\]\nPlugging in the known values:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = 1\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll solve both equations to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = 1\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by 12:\n\\[\n16 + 4x = 12\n\\]\nSubtracting 16 from both sides:\n\\[\n4x = -4\n\\]\nDividing by 4:\n\\[\nx = -1\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) represents the number of dogs in a group and cannot be negative, this indicates a contradiction, suggesting that the first scenario isn't possible. Therefore, I'll proceed to solve the second equation.\n\nFor the second equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = 1\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\( 12 - x \\):\n\\[\n16 + x = 12 - x\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n2x = -4\n\\]\nDividing by "

This implies that both scenarios result in negative \\( x \\) values, which don't make sense in the context of the problem. Therefore, there might be an error in my initial approach.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that \\( x \\) is the number of dogs being reassigned and not the group size. If \\( x \\) is the number of dogs, then I can reconsider the equations accordingly.\n\nRevisiting the second scenario with \\( x \\) as the number of dogs:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x} = 1\n\\]\nSolving this gives:\n\\[\nx = -2\n\\]\nWhich is still negative. This suggests that neither scenario provides a valid, positive \\( x \\) value.\n\nSince both scenarios lead to negative values for \\( x \\), it might indicate that the initial problem statement contains inconsistencies or that additional constraints are needed to find a valid solution.\n\nHowever, if I assume that \\( x \\) is a positive integer and re-examine the equations, it's possible that the problem expects us to find \\( x \\) such that both ratios are equal, regardless of the sign.
