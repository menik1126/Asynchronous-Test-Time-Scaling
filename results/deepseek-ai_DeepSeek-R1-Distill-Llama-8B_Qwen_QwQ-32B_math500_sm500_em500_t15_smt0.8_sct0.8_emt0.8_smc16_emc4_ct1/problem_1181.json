The roots of this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon. The final answer should be in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are relatively prime. Then, compute \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the equation. It's a quartic equation in \\( z \\), meaning it's degree 4. Quartic equations can have up to four roots, which will be the vertices of a convex polygon. The problem states it's a convex polygon, so it should be a quadrilateral, either a convex quadrilateral, probably a convex quadrilateral since four points in general position (no three on a line) form a convex quadrilateral.\n\nSo, my plan is to find the four roots of this equation, plot them in the complex plane, and then compute the area of the quadrilateral they form. To make this manageable, I might need to factor the equation or use some substitution to simplify it. \n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\). Hmm, the coefficients involve powers of \\( i \\). Let me see if there's a substitution that can make this equation look simpler.\n\nI notice that the coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. It's reminiscent of the expansion of \\( (z + i)^n \\), but the signs and coefficients don't directly match. Alternatively, maybe a substitution like \\( w = z + i \\) or something similar could help. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution involving \\( z = it \\), turning the equation into a polynomial in terms of \\( t \\).\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe this equation can be transformed by substituting \\( z = i w \\) to make it a real polynomial in \\( w \\). Let me try that.\n\nLet \\( z = i w \\). Then:\n\n\\( z^4 = (i w)^4 = i^4 w^4 = (1) w^4 = w^4 \\) (since"

Since the exact expressions might be too complicated, but maybe there's a symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the figure is a square centered at (-i) shifted down by 1? Wait, actually, the center of the original square (the roots ω_k) is at the origin, since they are equally spaced on a circle centered at the origin. Then, shifting all points by -i (i.e., subtracting i from each ω_k) translates the center to -i. So the center of the polygon is at (0, -1).\n\nTherefore, the square is centered at (0, -1), with its vertices shifted down by 1 unit. The side length remains the same as the original square, so the area is the same as the original square, which is (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area is different because of the translation? Wait, no, translation doesn't change the area. So the area is indeed 2^{5/4}.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2^{5/4}, so p=2, a=5, b=4, so 2+5+4=11.\n\nWait, but let me check with coordinates.\n\nLet me compute coordinates numerically.\n\nLet me compute r = 2^{1/8} ≈ 1.09050773267664.\n\nCompute θ0 = π/16 ≈ 0.19635 radians (about 11.25 degrees)\n\ncos(π/16) ≈ cos(0.19635) ≈ 0.980785\n\nsin(π/16) ≈ 0.195090\n\nθ1 = 9π/16 ≈ 1.76715 radians (about 101.25 degrees)\n\ncos(9π/16) ≈ cos(1.76715) ≈ -0.195090\n\nsin(9π/16) ≈ sin(1.76715) ≈ 0.980785\n\nWait, let me confirm with calculator:\n\ncos(π/16):\n\nπ ≈ 3.14"
