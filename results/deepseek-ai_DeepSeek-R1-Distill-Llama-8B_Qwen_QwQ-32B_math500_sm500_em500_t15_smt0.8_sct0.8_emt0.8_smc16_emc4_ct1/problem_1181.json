The area is expressed in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime, and then find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I should probably try to solve the equation. It's a quartic equation, which can be challenging, but maybe it factors nicely or has some symmetry that I can exploit.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). Hmm, I notice that the coefficients seem to follow a pattern similar to the expansion of something like \\( (z + iz)^4 \\), but let me check.\n\nWait, let me try substituting \\( z = w \\). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this equation by grouping terms. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\).\n\nIf I group the terms as follows:\n\n\\( (z^4 + 4z^3i) + (-6z^2 - 4zi) + (-i) = 0 \\).\n\nFactoring each group:\n\nFrom the first group, \\( z^3(z + 4i) \\).\n\nFrom the second group, -2z(3z + 2i).\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to help immediately. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I notice the coefficients 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -1. That looks kind of like a binomial expansion.

Okay, so squared is 2i z^2.\n\nThen, raising to the 4th power: (z + iz)^4 = (2i z^2)^2 = (2i)^2 z^4 = -4 z^4. Hmm, that's not matching the given equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different substitution. Let me think of the equation as similar to \\( (z + i)^4 \\), but let's check.\n\nExpanding \\( (z + i)^4 \\):\n\nUsing binomial theorem:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4 z^3 i + 6 z^2 (i)^2 + 4 z (i)^3 + (i)^4 \\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: z^4.\n\nSecond term: 4 z^3 i.\n\nThird term: 6 z^2 (i^2) = 6 z^2 (-1) = -6 z^2.\n\nFourth term: 4 z (i^3) = 4 z (-i) = -4i z.\n\nFifth term: (i)^4 = 1.\n\nSo altogether, \\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 \\).\n\nWait a second! Comparing this to the given equation:\n\nGiven equation: \\( z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i =0 \\).\n\nThe expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\) is \\( z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 \\).

These are positive integers, 2 is prime, and 5 and 4 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, \\( a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \\).\n\nI think that's the answer. So, I should write \\boxed{11}.\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). We notice that this can be rewritten as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\). \n\nTo solve this, we express \\( 1 + i \\) in polar form:\n\\[ 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) \\]\n\nThe fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\) are:\n\\[ 2^{1/8} \\left( \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\right) + i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\right) \\right) \\]\nfor \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\).\n\nThese roots form the vertices of a square inscribed in a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\). The area of this square is calculated as follows:\n- The diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle, which is \\( 2 \\times 2^{1/8} = 2^{9/8} \\).\n- The side length of the square is \\( \\frac{2^{9/8}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2^{5/8} \\).\n- The area of the square is \\( (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nThe area \\( 2^{5/4} \\) can be expressed as \\( p^{a/b} \\) where \\( p = 2 \\), \\( a = 5 \\), and \\( b = 4 \\). Therefore, \\( a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
