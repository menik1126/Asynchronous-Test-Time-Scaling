Since the seating is circular, rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.\n\nTo simplify the problem, I can fix the position of one person to eliminate the rotational symmetry. I'll choose to fix the Independent in a specific seat. This approach reduces the complexity of the problem to arranging the remaining 9 members linearly around the table.\n\nNext, I need to consider the arrangement within each party group. The Democrats and Republicans each have 5 members, and the Independent is already fixed. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange the 5 members in a line. Similarly, for the Republicans, there are also 5! ways to arrange their 5 members.\n\nAfter arranging the Democrats and Republicans, I need to decide how to place their groups relative to each other. Since the table is circular and the Independent's position is fixed, the two party groups can either be seated to the left or right of the Independent. This gives 2 possible configurations for the party groupings.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the total number of distinct seating arrangements by multiplying the number of ways to arrange each party group by the number of configurations. This accounts for all possible rotations and party ordering.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of arranging the Senate committee members around a circular table with the given constraints, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix the Position of the Independent**: To eliminate rotational symmetry, we can fix the Independent's position. This simplifies the problem to arranging the remaining 9 members linearly around the table.\n\n2. **Arrange the Democrats in a Line**: There are 5 Democrats to seat in a line. The number of ways to arrange them is \\(5!\\).\n\n3. **Arrange the Republicans in a Line**: Similarly, there are 5 Republicans to seat. The number of ways to arrange them is \\(5!\\).\n\n4. **Determine the Order of Party Groups**: Since the Independent's position is fixed, the two party groups (Democrats and Republicans) can be seated either to the left or to the right of the Independent. This gives us 2 possible configurations.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements**: Multiply the number of ways to arrange each party by the number of configurations:\n   \\[\n   5! \\times 5!"
