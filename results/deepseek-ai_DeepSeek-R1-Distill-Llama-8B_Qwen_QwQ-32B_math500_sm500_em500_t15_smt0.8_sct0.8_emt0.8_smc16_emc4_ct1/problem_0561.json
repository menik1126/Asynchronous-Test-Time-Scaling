Since the parties must all sit together, they can be thought of as three blocks: one for Democrats, one for Republicans, and one for the Independent.\n\nFirst, I'll fix the position of the Independent block to eliminate rotational symmetry. This effectively linearizes the problem, making it easier to count the arrangements.\n\nNext, I'll arrange the three blocks in a specific order. There are 3! (which is 6) ways to arrange these blocks around the table.\n\nAfter determining the order of the blocks, I'll consider the internal arrangement within each party. The 5 Democrats can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways, the 5 Republicans in 5! ways, and the single Independent in 1! way.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of internal arrangements for each party to find the total number of distinct seatings.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA Senate committee consists of 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. They need to sit around a circular table such that all members of each party sit together. Two seatings are considered the same if one can be rotated to get the other.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Constraints**\n- The members must be seated **in blocks** by party.\n- Since the table is circular, **rotational arrangements** are considered identical.\n\n**Step 2: Fix One Party to Eliminate Rotational Symmetry**\nTo avoid counting rotations as distinct arrangements, fix the position of one party. Let's fix the Independent's position.\n\n**Step 3: Arrange the Three Blocks Around the Table**\nAfter fixing the Independent, we have to arrange the three blocks (Democrats, Republicans, and Independent) around the table. However, since the Independent's position is fixed, the remaining two parties can be arranged in **2!** ways relative to the Independent.\n\n**Step 4: Arrange Members Within Each Block**\n- There are **5 Democrats**, so they can be arranged in **5!** ways.\n- There are **5 Republicans**, so they can be arranged in **5!** ways.\n- There is **1 Independent**, so they can be arranged in **1!** way.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Arr"
