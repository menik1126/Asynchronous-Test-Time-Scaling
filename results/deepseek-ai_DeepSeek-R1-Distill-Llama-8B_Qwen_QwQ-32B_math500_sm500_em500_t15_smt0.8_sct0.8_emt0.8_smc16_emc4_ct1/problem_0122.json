            "output": "To convert the binary number 10101001110 to base eight, I first need to determine its value in decimal. Since each digit in a binary number represents a power of two, I'll assign the rightmost digit to 2^0, the next rightmost to 2^1, and so on.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the value of each digit by multiplying the digit (0 or 1) by its corresponding power of two. After obtaining all the individual values, I'll sum them up to get the total decimal value.\n\nOnce I have the decimal equivalent, I'll then convert this value into base eight. To do this, I'll divide the decimal number by 8 and record the remainder. I'll repeat this process with each subsequent quotient until the quotient becomes zero. The base eight number will be the remainders read in reverse order.\n\nFinally, I'll write down the base eight number to provide the answer.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nThe binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) is equal to what number in base eight?\n\n---\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Binary to Octal Conversion:**\n   \n   - Each digit in an octal number represents \\(8\\) values.\n   - Binary numbers can be grouped into sets of three digits from the right, as \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\n2. **Split the Binary Number into Groups of Three:**\n   \n   \\[\n   101\\ 010\\ 011\\ 10\n   \\]\n   \n   However, since the binary number has \\(11\\) digits, we'll pad it with a leading zero to make it a multiple of three:\n   \n   \\[\n   010\\ 101\\ 001\\ 110\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert Each Binary Group to Its Octal Equivalent:**\n   \n   - \\(010_{2} = 2_{8}\\)\n   - \\(101_{2} = 5_{8}\\)\n   - \\(001_{2} = 1_{8}\\)\n   - \\(110_{2} = 6_{8}\\)\n\n4. **Combine the Octal Digits:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2\\ 5\\ 1\\ 6 \\Rightarrow 2516_{8}\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n"
