Let's denote the first term as \\( a \\) and the common difference as \\( d \\).\n\nThe fourth term of the sequence is given as 200. Using the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence, which is \\( a_n = a + (n-1)d \\), I can set up the equation:\n\\[ a_4 = a + 3d = 200 \\]\n\nSimilarly, the eighth term is given as 500:\n\\[ a_8 = a + 7d = 500 \\]\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n1. \\( a + 3d = 200 \\)\n2. \\( a + 7d = 500 \\)\n\nTo find the value of \\( d \\), I'll subtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[ (a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200 \\]\n\\[ 4d = 300 \\]\n\\[ d = 75 \\]\n\nWith the common difference \\( d \\) known, I can now solve for \\( a \\) by subtracting \\( 3d \\) from 200:\n\\[ a = 200 - 3(75) \\]\n\\[ a = 200 - 225 \\]\n\\[ a = -25 \\]\n\nFinally, to find the sixth term \\( a_6 \\), I'll use the formula again:\n\\[ a_6 = a + 5d \\]\n\\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \\]\n\\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \\]\n\\[ a_6 = 350 \\]\n\nThe sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is 350.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, follow these steps:\n\n**1. Understand the Arithmetic Sequence Formula**\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference \\( d \\) to the preceding term. The general formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[\na_n = a + (n - 1)d\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( a \\) is the first term,\n- \\( d \\) is the common difference,\n- \\( n \\) is the term number.\n\n**2.
