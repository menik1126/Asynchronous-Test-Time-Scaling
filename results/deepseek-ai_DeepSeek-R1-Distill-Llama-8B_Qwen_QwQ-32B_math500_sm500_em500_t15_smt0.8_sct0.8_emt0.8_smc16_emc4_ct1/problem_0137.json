The superfactorial of a number n, denoted as n$, is a tower of factorials, starting with n! and continuing with n! factorial of that result, and so on, for a total of n! levels. So, for 4$, it means we have four factorial operations stacked.\n\nStarting with 4!, which is 24. The units digit of 24 is 4. Now, I need to compute 5! based on this result. Since 5! is 120, its units digit is 0. Moving forward, 6! is 720, also with a units digit of 0. Finally, 7! is 5040, which has a units digit of 0.\n\nSince all the subsequent factorials beyond 5! have a units digit of 0, the units digit of 4$ remains 4.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the units digit of the superfactorial \\(4\\)\\(.\\) The superfactorial \\(n\\)\\( is defined as a tower of factorials with \\(n!\\) levels.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate \\(4!\\)**\n\\[\n4! = 24 \\quad \\text{\u2192 Units digit: } 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate \\(5!\\)**\n\\[\n5! = 120 \\quad \\text{\u2192 Units digit: } 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate \\(6!\\)**\n\\[\n6! = 720 \\quad \\text{\u2192 Units digit: } 0\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate \\(7!\\)**\n\\[\n7! = 5040 \\quad \\text{\u2192 Units digit: } 0\n\\]\n\nSince all subsequent factorials after \\(5!\\) result in a units digit of 0, the units digit of the superfactorial \\(4\\)\\( remains 4.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
