            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number excluding the number itself. So, I'll start by determining the prime factors of 284.\n\nI know that 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. Since 142 is also even, it can be divided by 2 to get 71. Now, 71 is a prime number, as it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nWith the prime factorization of 284 being 2 squared multiplied by 71, I can now find its proper divisors. They are 1, 2, 4, and 71. Adding these together, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 1 + 2 + 4 + 71, which equals 78.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 78. To do this, I'll factorize 78. It can be divided by 2 to get 39, and 39 can be further divided by 3 to get 13. So, the prime factors of 78 are 2, 3, and 13.\n\nThe proper divisors of 78 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, and 26. Adding these together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 13 + 26 equals 51.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 51.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** The proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. A proper divisor of an integer \\( N \\) is a positive divisor of \\( N \\) that is less than \\( N \\). What is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284:**\n   \n   - **Prime factorization of 284:**\n     \\[\n     284 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 71 = 2^2 \\times 71\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Proper divisors of 284:**\n     \\[\n     1,\\ 2,\\ 4"
