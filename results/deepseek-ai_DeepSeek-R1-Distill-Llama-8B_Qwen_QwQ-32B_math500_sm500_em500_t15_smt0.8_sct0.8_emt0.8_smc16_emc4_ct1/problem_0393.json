The volume V is 45π, and the radius r is 3 cm.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 45π = π(3)²h.\n\nCalculating the radius squared, I get 3² = 9.\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to 45π = 9πh.\n\nTo solve for h, I'll divide both sides of the equation by π, which gives 45 = 9h.\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 9, resulting in h = 5 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo find the height (\\( h \\)) of the cylinder, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = 45\\pi \\ \\text{cubic cm}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = 3 \\ \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Plug the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = 9\\pi h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\) to cancel out \\( \\pi \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \\( h \\).\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
