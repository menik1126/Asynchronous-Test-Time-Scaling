The problem states two important properties:\n\n1. For every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) forms a geometric sequence.\n2. For every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) forms an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAdditionally, I'm given that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\), and I need to find \\( a_1 \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\n- A **geometric sequence** is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio, called the common ratio. So, if \\( a, b, c \\) are in geometric sequence, then \\( b/a = c/b \\), which implies \\( b^2 = a \\cdot c \\).\n\n- An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. So, if \\( a, b, c \\) are in arithmetic sequence, then \\( b - a = c - b \\), which implies \\( 2b = a + c \\).\n\nGiven these definitions, let's translate the problem's conditions into mathematical equations.\n\nLet's start by considering the first condition: for every \\( k \\), the terms \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) form a geometric sequence.\n\nSo, for any \\( k \\), we have:\n\\( a_{2k}^2 = a_{2k-1} \\cdot a_{2k+1} \\).  [Equation 1]\n\nSimilarly, the second condition says that the subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is arithmetic. So, for any \\( k \\), we have:\n\\( 2a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2} \\).
