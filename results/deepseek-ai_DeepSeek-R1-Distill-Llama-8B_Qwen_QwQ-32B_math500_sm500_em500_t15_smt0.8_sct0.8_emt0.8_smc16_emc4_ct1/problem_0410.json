            "output": "I need to determine when the two gears will next align their marks pointing north. \n\nFirst, I'll calculate the speed of each gear in revolutions per second. The first gear turns 33 and 1/3 times per minute. Converting this to seconds, since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 1 revolution equals 1 full rotation, I'll divide 33.333... by 60. This gives approximately 0.5555556 revolutions per second.\n\nThe second gear turns 45 times per minute. Similarly, converting this to revolutions per second, I'll divide 45 by 60, which equals 0.75 revolutions per second.\n\nNext, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods to determine when they'll align again. The periods are 1/0.5555556 seconds per revolution and 1/0.75 seconds per revolution. Calculating the LCM of these periods will give me the time in seconds until both gears align.\n\nAfter finding the LCM, which is 440 seconds, I can conclude that the marks will next point north after 440 seconds.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**\n- **Gear 1** turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times per minute.\n- **Gear 2** turns 45 times per minute.\n- Both gears start with a mark pointing due north.\n- **Question:** After how many seconds will both marks next point due north?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand Gear Speeds in Revolutions per Second:**\n   - **Gear 1:** \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) revolutions per minute.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revolutions per second} = \\frac{33\\frac{1}{3}}{60} = \\frac{100}{3 \\times 60} = \\frac{100}{180} = \\frac{5}{9} \\text{ revs/sec}\n     \\]\n   - **Gear 2:** 45 revolutions per minute.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revolutions per second} = \\frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \\text{ revs/sec}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine When They'll Align Again:**\n   - To find when both gears align, we need to find the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of their periods.\n"
