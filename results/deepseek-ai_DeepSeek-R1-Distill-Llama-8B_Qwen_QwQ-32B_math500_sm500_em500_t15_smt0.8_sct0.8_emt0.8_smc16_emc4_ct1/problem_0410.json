Since \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\), the time for Gear A to complete an integer rotation is:\n\n   \\( \\frac{60}{\\frac{100}{3}} = \\frac{60 \\times 3}{100} = 1.8 \\) seconds per rotation.  \n   But actually, after 60 seconds, Gear A completes exactly \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\times 2 = 66\\frac{2}{3} \\times 3 = 100/3 \\times 60? Wait, perhaps better to think in fractions.\n\n   Alternatively, since rotations per minute for Gear A is \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\), its **period** (time per rotation) is \\( \\frac{60}{\\frac{100}{3}} = \\frac{180}{100} = 1.8 \\) seconds per rotation. Similarly, Gear B's period is \\( \\frac{60}{45} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds per rotation.\n\n   To find the time when both marks align, we need the LCM of their periods (1.8 and 1.3333) seconds. However, dealing with decimals complicates this. Instead, let's find LCM of their rotation counts per minute and see over how many minutes they align.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to treat this as a LCM problem between the time it takes each gear to complete a full rotation an integer number of times.\n\nBut the classic way is to use LCM of their periods, but LCM can also be considered using their rotational frequencies.\n\nAlternatively, to find the time \\( t \\) where:\n\nThe angle rotated by Gear A is an exact multiple of 360 degrees (i.e., full rotations), same for Gear B. Since their angular speeds are \\( \\omega_A = \\frac{100}{3} \\times 2\\pi \\) radians per minute, and \\( \\omega_B = 45 \\times 2\\pi \\) radians per minute, the time required for both angles to be multiples"
