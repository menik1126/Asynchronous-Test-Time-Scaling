This reveals that the denominator is of the form \\(10^n - 1\\), where \\(n = 5\\).\n\nNext, I'll recall that when a fraction has a denominator of the form \\(10^n - 1\\), the length of the repeating decimal cycle is equal to the smallest integer \\(k\\) such that \\(10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\\). In this case, \\(n = 11\\) (since \\(11111 = 11 \\times 1010.09\\) and we're considering the prime factor \\(11\\) for the purpose of finding the repeating cycle).\n\nFinally, applying Euler's theorem, since \\(11\\) is prime and \\(10\\) is not a multiple of \\(11\\), the smallest \\(k\\) is \\(10\\). Therefore, the repeating cycle length is \\(5\\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator's Structure:**\n   \\[\n   11111 = 10^5 - 1\n   \\]\n   This indicates that the denominator can be expressed as \\(10^5 - 1\\), where \\(5\\) is the exponent.\n\n2. **Identify the Repeating Cycle Length:**\n   When a fraction has a denominator of the form \\(10^n - 1\\), the decimal expansion results in a repeating cycle. The length of this repeating cycle is equal to the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(n = 11\\) (since \\(11111 = 11 \\times 1010.09\\) and we're considering the prime factor \\(11\\) for the purpose of finding the repeating cycle).\n\n3. **Apply Euler's Theorem:**\n   Euler's theorem states that for \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) coprime, the smallest \\(k\\) satisfying the above congruence is:\n   \\[\n   k = \\phi(n)\n   \\]\n   Where \\(\\phi(n)\\) is Euler's totient function.

The correct approach is to recognize that the denominator \\(11111\\) itself is \\(10^5 - 1\\), so the repeating cycle length is the order of \\(10\\) modulo \\(11111\\). Since \\(11111\\) is a prime number (which it is not; actually, \\(11111 = 41 \\times 271\\)), the correct cycle length must be found by checking the order of \\(10\\) modulo each prime factor and taking the least common multiple (LCM). \n\n**Corrected Steps:**\n\n1. **Factorize the Denominator:**\n   \\[\n   11111 = 41 \\times 271\n   \\]\n   Both \\(41\\) and \\(271\\) are primes.\n\n2. **Find the Order of 10 Modulo Each Prime:**\n   - For \\(41\\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Find the smallest } k \\text{ such that } 10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{41}\n     \\]\n     Testing exponents:\n     \\[\n     10^5 \\equiv 10^5 \\mod 41 \\quad (\\text{since } 10^5 = 100000 \\mod 41)\n     \\]\n     Calculating \\(10^5 \\mod 41\\):\n     \\[\n     10^1 \\equiv 10 \\mod 41 \\\\\n     10^2 \\equiv 100 \\equiv 100 - 2 \\times 41 = 18 \\mod 41 \\\\\n     10^4 \\equiv (10^2)^2 \\equiv 18^2 = 324 \\equiv 324 - 7 \\times 41 = 324 - 287 = 37 \\mod 41 \\\\\n     10^5 \\equiv 10^4 \\times"

The order is not \\(5\\) (as shown by calculating \\(10^5 \\mod 271\\)), so it must be a higher divisor of \\(270\\). Further testing shows that the order is \\(10\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Repeating Cycle Length:**\n   The length of the repeating decimal is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders modulo each prime factor:\n   \\[\n   \\text{LCM}(5, 10) = 10\n   \\]\n   \nTherefore, the repeating decimal has a cycle of length \\(10\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{5}\\)"
