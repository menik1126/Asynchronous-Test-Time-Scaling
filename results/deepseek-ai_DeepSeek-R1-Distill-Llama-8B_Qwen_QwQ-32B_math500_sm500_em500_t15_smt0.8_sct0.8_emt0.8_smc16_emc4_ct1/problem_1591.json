            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, that's a cubic equation, and I remember that solving cubics can sometimes be tricky, but maybe there's a way to simplify it. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I should probably expand all the terms to see if any patterns emerge or if some terms can be combined. Let's start with expanding each cubic separately.\n\nStarting with (x - 3)^3. I recall that (a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3. So applying that here:\n\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27.\n\nNext, (x - 7)^3. Using the same expansion:\n\n(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343.\n\nNow, let's add these two expanded forms together:\n\n(x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343) = 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370.\n\nWait, that simplifies to 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370.\n\nNow, the right-hand side is (2x - 10)^3. Let me expand that as well. Using (a - b)^3 again:\n\n(2x - 10)^3 = (2x)^3 - 3*(2x)^2*10 + 3*(2x)*(10)^2 - 10^3\n= 8x^3 - 3*4x^2*10 + 3*2x*100 - 1000\n= 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Subtract 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x"

Let me see if all coefficients have a common divisor. 6, 90, 426, 630... 6 divides all, so let's factor out a 6:\n\n6(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105) = 0.\n\nSo now, the equation is x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0.\n\nNow, to solve this cubic equation, maybe we can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (105) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1). So possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b15, \u00b17, \u00b115, \u00b121, \u00b135, \u00b1105.\n\nLet me test x=1: 1 -15 +71 -105 = (1 -15) + (71 -105) = (-14) + (-34) = -48 \u2260 0.\n\nx=3: 27 - 135 + 213 - 105. Let's calculate step by step: 27 -135 = -108; -108 +213 = 105; 105 -105 = 0. Oh, so x=3 is a root!\n\nThat's great. So (x - 3) is a factor. Now, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor this cubic.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root x=3:\n\n coefficients: 1 | -15 | 71 | -105\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 3: 3. Add to -15: -12.\n\nMultiply -12 by 3: -36. Add to "

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add up to -12. Those numbers are -5 and -7 because (-5)*(-7)=35 and (-5)+(-7)=-12.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as (x -5)(x -7).\n\nPutting it all together, the cubic factors as (x -3)(x -5)(x -7) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x = 3, x=5, and x=7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if these roots satisfy the original equation. Let's plug in x=3:\n\nLeft side: (3-3)^3 + (3-7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 -64 = -64.\n\nRight side: (2*3 -10)^3 = (6-10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64. Okay, that works.\n\nx=5: Left side: (5-3)^3 + (5-7)^3 = 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 -8 = 0.\n\nRight side: (10 -10)^3 = 0^3 = 0. So 0=0, which works.\n\nx=7: Left side: (7-3)^3 + (7-7)^3 = 4^3 + 0 = 64 +0 =64.\n\nRight side: (14 -10)^3 =4^3=64. So, 64=64, correct.\n\nSo all three roots are valid.
