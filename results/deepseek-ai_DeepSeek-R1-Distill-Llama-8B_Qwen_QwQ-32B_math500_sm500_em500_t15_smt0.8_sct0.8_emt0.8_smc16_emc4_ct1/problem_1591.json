I remember that sometimes when you have cubes on both sides, you can try expanding them or maybe looking for some pattern or substitution.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the equation to make sure I understand it correctly:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nLooking at the right side, I notice that \\(2x - 10\\) can be factored. Let me factor that out:\n\n\\[\n2x - 10 = 2(x - 5)\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = [2(x - 5)]^3\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n\\[\n[2(x - 5)]^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\\]\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see if I can find a substitution here. Maybe if I let \\(y = x - 5\\), then \\(x = y + 5\\). Let's try that substitution to see if it simplifies things.\n\nSo, let \\(y = x - 5\\). Then:\n\n- \\(x - 3 = y + 2\\)\n- \\(x - 7 = y - 2\\)\n- \\(x - 5 = y\\)\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n\\[\n(y + 2)^3 + (y - 2)^3 = 8y^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems a bit more manageable. Let me expand the left side.\n\nI recall that \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\) and \\((a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3\\). So, if I add these two expansions together:\n\n\\[\n(y + 2)^3 + (y -"

Sometimes, when you manipulate equations, especially by expanding and factoring, you might introduce extraneous solutions or sometimes the solutions may not satisfy the original equation due to some miscalculations.\n\nLet's check each solution one by one.\n\n**Checking x = 5:**\n\nLeft side: \\((5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0\\)\n\nRight side: \\((2*5 - 10)^3 = (10 - 10)^3 = (0)^3 = 0\\)\n\nSo, 0 = 0.

The original equation is a cubic, so it's a third-degree polynomial, which can have up to three real roots. So, having three real roots is expected. Let's see the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nIt's interesting because when x = 5, both sides are zero. When x = 7, the left side is 64, right side is 64, and when x = 3, left is -64 and right is -64.\n\nSo, all three solutions are valid. Therefore, the roots are x = 3, 5, and 7.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me try another approach just to be thorough. Maybe by substitution, as initially started.\n\nBut I think the substitution method worked fine, leading me to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have considered using the formula for a + b = c^3, but I think the expansion method was a solid approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking both sides to some power or considering symmetry.\n\nWait, looking at the original equation again, I can see that the right side is the cube of 2x - 10, which is 2(x - 5). So, the right side is 8(x - 5)^3.\n\nOn the left side, we have (x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3. Let me note that if x - 5 = 0, i.e., x =5, then both (x -3) = 2 and (x -7)= -2, so their cubes add up to 8 + (-8)=0, which is equal to the right side, which is also zero. So that's why x =5 is a solution.\n\nBut what about x =3 and x=7? Let's see if they satisfy any particular relation.\n\nFor x =3:\n\n(x -3)=0, and (x -7)= -4, so 0 + (-4)^3 = -64.\n\nOn the right side: (2*3 -10)^3 = (-4)^3=-64. So they match.\n\nSimilarly, for x=7:\n\n(x -3)=4, (x -7)=0, so 4^3 + 0 = "

The problem is a cubic equation, so when we expanded everything, we ended up with a cubic equation in y, which had three roots, so that's consistent. So, the answer is three roots: 3,5,7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to see this without expanding?\n\nLet me think. Let me consider the equation again:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x -10)^3\n\\]\n\nNotice that 2x -10 is equal to (x -3) + (x -7). Let me check that:\n\n(x -3) + (x -7) = 2x -10. Yes! Exactly. So, the equation is of the form:\n\na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3, where a = (x -3) and b = (x -7).\n\nRecall that (a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b). Therefore, if we have a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3, then substituting the expansion:\n\na^3 + b^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a + b)\n\nSubtract a^3 + b^3 from both sides:\n\n0 = 3ab(a + b)\n\nTherefore, 3ab(a + b) =0.\n\nSo, either a + b =0, or ab =0.\n\nTherefore, the equation reduces to either:\n\n1. a + b =0, which is (x -3) + (x -7)=0 => 2x -10 =0 => x=5\n\nOr,\n\n2. ab =0, which is (x -3)(x -7)=0 => x=3 or x=7.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x=3,5,7. Exactly the same as before.\n\nAh! That's a much more straightforward approach. So, by recognizing the identity \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)^3 - 3ab(a + b)\\),"
