            "output": "Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 2 raised to the power of 2x equals 256 raised to the power of one-half. Hmm, let me write that down properly. It's 2^(2x) = 256^(1/2). Alright, now I need to figure out what x is. \n\nFirst, I remember that both sides of the equation have exponents, so maybe I can rewrite them with the same base if possible. Let me see, 2 is already a base, so that's good. What about 256? Hmm, I think 256 is a power of 2. Let me check that. 2 to the 8th is 256 because 2^10 is 1024, so 2^8 is 256. Yeah, that seems right. So, 256 is 2^8. \n\nSo, if I rewrite 256^(1/2) as (2^8)^(1/2), that should help me since both sides have base 2 now. Okay, let me do that. So, (2^8)^(1/2). Now, I remember the exponent rule that (a^b)^c = a^(b*c). So applying that, 8 times 1/2 is 4. So, 2^(8*(1/2)) becomes 2^4. 2^4 is 16, right? So, 256^(1/2) simplifies down to 16.\n\nNow, my equation is 2^(2x) = 16. Hmm, 16 is also a power of 2. Specifically, 2^4. So, I can rewrite 16 as 2^4. So now, the equation is 2^(2x) = 2^4. \n\nSince the bases are the same and the equation holds, the exponents must be equal. So, I can set 2x equal to 4. That gives me 2x = 4. To solve for x, I just divide both sides by 2. So, x = 4 / 2, which is 2. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I plug x back into the original equation, does it hold? Let's see: 2^(2*2) = 2^4 = 16, and 256^(1/"

            "output": "2) is sqrt(256) which is 16. Yep, that works. So x is indeed 2. \n\nHmm, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes in the exponent rules. Let me go through it again. \n\nOriginal equation: 2^(2x) = 256^(1/2). \n\nExpress 256 as 2^8: 256^(1/2) = (2^8)^(1/2) = 2^(8*(1/2)) = 2^4. \n\nSo equation becomes 2^(2x) = 2^4. \n\nSince the bases are equal, exponents must be equal: 2x = 4. \n\nDivide both sides by 2: x = 2. \n\nYep, that all checks out. I think that's correct. Maybe another way to look at it is to take logarithms, but since the bases are the same, equating exponents is straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't recognize 256 as a power of 2, I could factor it down. Let's see, 256 divided by 2 is 128, then 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. That's 8 divisions by 2, so 2^8. Yep, that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using natural logs? Let's try that method just to confirm. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2^(2x)) = ln(256^(1/2))\n\nUsing the log power rule: 2x * ln(2) = (1/2) * ln(256)\n\nThen solve for x: x = [(1/2) * ln(256) / ln(2)] / 2\n\nWait, let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, the right-hand side: (1/2)*ln(256). Since ln(256) is ln(2^8) which is 8*ln(2). So substituting that in:\n\n(1/2)*(8*ln(2)) = 4*ln(2). \n\nSo the equation becomes 2x * ln(2) = 4 * ln"

            "output": "(2). \n\nDivide both sides by ln(2): 2x = 4. \n\nThen, divide by 2: x = 2. \n\nYep, same answer. So whether I use exponent rules or logarithms, I get x = 2. \n\nI guess another way to think about it is taking the square root of both sides. Since the right side is 256^(1/2), which is sqrt(256) = 16. Then the equation becomes 2^(2x) = 16. Then take log base 2 of both sides: 2x = log2(16) = 4, so x=2. \n\nYep, same result. So all methods point to x being 2.
