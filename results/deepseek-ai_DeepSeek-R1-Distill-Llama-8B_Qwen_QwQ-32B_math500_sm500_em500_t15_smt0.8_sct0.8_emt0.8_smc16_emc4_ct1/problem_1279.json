I know that \\(2^8 = 256\\).\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, it becomes \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the exponentiation rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\), which simplifies the right side to \\(2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, solving for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2 gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) for \\(x\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a power of 2:**\n   \n   We know that \\(256 = 2^8\\) because:\n   \\[\n   2^8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 256\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute 256 in the equation:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the exponentiation rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set the exponents equal to each other (since the bases are the same):**\n   \n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\"
