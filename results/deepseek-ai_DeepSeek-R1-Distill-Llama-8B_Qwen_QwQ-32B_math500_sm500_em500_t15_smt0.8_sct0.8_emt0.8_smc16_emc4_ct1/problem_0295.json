The task is to rotate z around c by \u03c0/4 radians counter-clockwise, and find the resulting complex number w. Hmm, let me try to recall how rotations and translations work with complex numbers.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the complex plane, a rotation can be represented by multiplying by e^{i\u03b8}. But here, we're rotating around a specific point c, not the origin. So, I think the process involves translating z so that c becomes the origin, then performing the rotation, and then translating back. Let me write that down step by step.\n\n1. **Translation to move point c to the origin:** To do this, I subtract c from z. So, if z is 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i and c is 2 - 3i, then z - c would be (2 + sqrt(2) - 2) + (-3 - 3 sqrt(2) - (-3)i). Let's compute that.\n\n   Real part: 2 + sqrt(2) - 2 = sqrt(2)\n   Imaginary part: -3 - 3 sqrt(2) + 3 = -3 sqrt(2)\n   So, z - c = sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2)i.\n\n2. **Rotation by \u03c0/4:** The rotation factor is e^{i\u03c0/4}, which is cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4). Since \u03c0/4 is 45 degrees, both cos and sin are sqrt(2)/2. So e^{i\u03c0/4} is sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\n   Multiplying this by the translated z - c:\n   (sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2)i) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\n   Let me compute that step by step:\n   Multiply sqrt(2) by sqrt(2)/2: (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = 2/2 = 1.\n   Multiply sqrt(2) by i sqrt(2)/2: i*(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 = i*2/2 = i.\n   Multiply -3 sqrt(2)i by sqrt(2)/2: -3 sqrt(2)*sqrt("

So, 4 - 2i + (2 - 3i).\n\n   Compute the real parts: 4 + 2 = 6\n   Compute the imaginary parts: -2i - 3i = -5i\n   So, w = 6 - 5i.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, it's easy to make a mistake with the signs or multiplications.\n\nStarting with the translation: z - c. z is 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i, c is 2 - 3i. Subtracting c:\n\nReal part: 2 + sqrt(2) - 2 = sqrt(2)\nImaginary part: - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i - (-3i) = (-3 - 3 sqrt(2))i + 3i = (-3 sqrt(2))i.

Alternatively, using the formula for rotation about a point c:\n\nIf I have a point z, then the rotated point w is given by:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^{i\u03b8}\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.

So I think I got it right. So w = 6 -5i.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of rotating \\( z \\) around \\( c \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) counter-clockwise is \\(\\boxed{6 - 5i}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the result of rotating \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \\sqrt{2})i \\) around \\( c = 2 - 3i \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) counter-clockwise, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Translate"
