            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to rotate a complex number z around another complex number c by π/4 radians counter-clockwise. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me write down the given values to keep things clear. We have z = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i. That means in the form a + bi, the real part a is 2 + √2, and the imaginary part b is -3 - 3√2. Then we have c = 2 - 3i, so the real part is 2, and the imaginary part is -3.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the result w, which is z rotated around c by π/4. Hmm, rotation of a complex number. I remember that multiplying a complex number by e^(iθ) rotates it counter-clockwise by θ radians. But wait, we're rotating around another point c, not the origin. So, this is a rotation about a point other than zero. I think the general method involves translating the system so that c becomes the origin, rotating, and then translating back.\n\nLet me recall the steps for this. To rotate z around c by an angle θ, we can:\n\n1. Translate z by subtracting c. This moves the point c to the origin, keeping z' = z - c.\n2. Rotate z' by θ using multiplication by e^(iθ).\n3. Translate back by adding c to the result.\n\nSo, the formula should be w = c + (z - c) * e^(iθ).\n\nWait, let me make sure I have this right. Yes, that seems correct. So let me note down the formula:\n\nw = c + (z - c) * e^(iθ)\n\nWhere θ is π/4. So, substituting θ, e^(iπ/4) is equal to cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4), which is √2/2 + i√2/2.\n\nOkay, so I need to compute (z - c) first. Let's compute that. \n\nGiven z = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i\n\nAnd c = 2 - 3i\n\nSo, z - c is z minus c, which is (2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i)"

The imaginary part of z is - (3 + 3√2), so when subtracting the imaginary part of c, which is -3i, so subtracting a negative is adding. \n\nWait, actually, let me write it step by step:\n\nImaginary part of z is - (3 + 3√2), so that's the coefficient of i. The imaginary part of c is -3. \n\nTherefore, when subtracting c from z, the imaginary part becomes:\n\n[ - (3 + 3√2) - (-3) ] = -3 - 3√2 + 3 = (-3 + 3) - 3√2 = 0 - 3√2 = -3√2. \n\nYes, that's correct. So z - c is indeed √2 - 3√2 i. \n\nSo, z - c = √2 (1 - 3i). \n\nHmm, that's a nice simplification. So, that's the vector from c to z. \n\nNow, we need to rotate this vector by π/4. \n\nThe rotation factor is e^(iπ/4) = cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) = √2/2 + i√2/2. \n\nTherefore, multiplying (z - c) by this factor:\n\nLet me denote (z - c) as a complex number: √2 (1 - 3i). \n\nSo, multiplying by e^(iπ/4):\n\nFirst, let me compute the multiplication step by step. Let me write both in terms of their components.\n\nLet me write (z - c) as √2*(1 - 3i). \n\nMultiplying by e^(iπ/4) which is (√2/2 + i√2/2). \n\nSo, the product is √2*(1 - 3i)*(√2/2 + i"
