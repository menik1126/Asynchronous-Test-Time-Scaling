            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196. To do this systematically, I'll start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n196 can be divided by 2, giving us 98. Dividing 98 by 2 again yields 49. Next, I'll factor 49 into 7 and 7, since 7 multiplied by 7 equals 49. Therefore, the prime factors of 196 are \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\).\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply these results together, I get \\( (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\). This means there are 9 positive whole-number divisors of 196.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors \\( 196 \\) has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 196**:\n   \\[\n   196 \\div 2 = 98 \\\\\n   98 \\div 2 = 49 \\\\\n   49 \\div 7 = 7 \\\\\n   7 \\div 7 = 1\n   \\]\n   So, the prime factorization is:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Formula for Number of Divisors**:\n   The formula to find the number of positive divisors of a number \\( n = p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{c} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of divisors} = (a + 1)(b + 1)\\ldots(c + 1)\n   \\]\n   For \\( 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of divisors} = (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **List of Divisors (Optional)**:\n   The divisors of \\( 196 \\) are:\n   \\[\n   1,\\ 2,\\ 4,\\ 7,\\ 14,\\ 28,\\ 49,\\ 98,\\"
