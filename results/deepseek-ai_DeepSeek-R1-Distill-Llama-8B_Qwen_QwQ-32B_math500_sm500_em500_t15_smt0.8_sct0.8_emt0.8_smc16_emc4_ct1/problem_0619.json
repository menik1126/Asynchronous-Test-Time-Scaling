Dividing 196 by 2 gives 98.\n\nSince 98 is also even, it's divisible by 2 again. Dividing 98 by 2 results in 49.\n\nNext, I'll consider 49. I know that 49 is a perfect square, specifically 7 squared. Therefore, its prime factorization is 7 multiplied by itself, which is 7².\n\nCombining these steps, the prime factorization of 196 is 2² multiplied by 7².\n\nNow, to find the number of positive whole-number divisors, I'll use the formula for the number of divisors, which is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply these values together. In this case, the exponents are 2 and 2.\n\nAdding 1 to each exponent gives me 3 and 3. Multiplying these together: 3 * 3 equals 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 196\n\nStart by dividing 196 by the smallest prime number, which is **2**:\n\n\\[\n196 \\div 2 = 98\n\\]\n\n98 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:\n\n\\[\n98 \\div 2 = 49\n\\]\n\nNow, we're left with **49**. The number 49 is a perfect square and can be factored into:\n\n\\[\n49 = 7 \\times 7 = 7^2\n\\]\n\nSo, combining the prime factors, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\n\\[\n196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the Divisor Formula\n\nThe formula to find the number of positive whole-number divisors of a number is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of divisors} = (e_1 + 1) \\times (e_2 + 1) \\times \\dots \\times (e_n + 1)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( e_1, e_2"
