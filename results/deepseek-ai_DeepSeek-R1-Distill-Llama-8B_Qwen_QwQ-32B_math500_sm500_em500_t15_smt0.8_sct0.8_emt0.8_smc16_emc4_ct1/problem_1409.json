Given that the radius of the tank is 6 cm, the volume will be \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6)^3 = 144\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( \\pi r^2 h \\). With a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm, the volume of one beaker is \\( \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nFinally, to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the total volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker: \\( \\frac{144\\pi}{72\\pi} = 2 \\). Therefore, it will take 2 such cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   Given that the radius \\( r \\) of the tank is **6 cm**:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{tank}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (216) = 144\\pi \\ \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Given that the beaker has a radius \\( r \\) of **3 cm** and a height \\( h \\) of **8 cm**:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{beaker}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi (9) (8) = 72\\pi \\ \\text{cm}^"
