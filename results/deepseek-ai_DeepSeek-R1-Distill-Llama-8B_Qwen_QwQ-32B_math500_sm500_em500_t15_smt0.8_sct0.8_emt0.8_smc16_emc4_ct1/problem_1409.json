            "output": "I need to determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are required to fill a spherical tank.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Given that the radius of the spherical tank is 6 cm, plugging this into the formula gives (4/3)\u03c0(6)\u00b3, which simplifies to (4/3)\u03c0(216) = 288\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2h. With a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, the volume is \u03c0(3)\u00b2(8) = 72\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nFinally, to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, I'll divide the total volume of the sphere by the volume of one cylindrical beaker. So, 288\u03c0 divided by 72\u03c0 equals 4. Therefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, let's perform the calculations step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Given the radius \\( r = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\):\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (216) = 288 \\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n   Given the radius \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\) and height \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\):\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72 \\pi \\, \\text"
