            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since a hexagon has six equal sides, I multiply the length of one side by six.\n\nSo, 16 cm multiplied by six equals 96 cm, which is the perimeter of the hexagon.\n\nNext, I know that the regular octagon has the same perimeter. To find the length of one side of the octagon, I divide the total perimeter by the number of sides, which is eight.\n\nDividing 96 cm by eight gives me 12 cm, so each side of the octagon is 12 cm long.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6** equal sides.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of the hexagon} = \\text{Number of sides} \\times \\text{Length of one side} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the perimeter of the regular octagon.**\n   \n   - The problem states that the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of the octagon} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the length of one side of the regular octagon.**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8** equal sides.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of one side of the octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of the octagon}}{\\text{Number of sides}} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
