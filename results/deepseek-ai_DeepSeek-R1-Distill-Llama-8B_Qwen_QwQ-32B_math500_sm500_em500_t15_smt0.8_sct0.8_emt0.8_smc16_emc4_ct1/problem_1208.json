The direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), so we need to find \\( b \\).\n\nFirst, I should recall that the direction vector of a line can be found by taking the difference between the coordinates of two points on that line. The figure is an Asymptote drawing with points A and B labeled. Point A is at (-5, 4) and point B is at (-1, 3). So, those are two points on the line.\n\nTo find the direction vector, I can subtract the coordinates of point A from point B. That is, compute \\( B - A \\). Let me write that out:\n\n\\( x \\)-component: \\( (-1) - (-5) = (-1) + 5 = 4 \\)\n\\( y \\)-component: \\( 3 - 4 = -1 \\)\n\nSo, the direction vector from A to B is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). However, in the problem statement, the direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, that doesn't match up directly. Maybe I need to consider the direction of the line beyond just segment AB.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, points L and R are extensions of the line AB beyond the y-axis. So, point L is the intersection of line AB with the left boundary of the grid (x = -8, y between 0 and 1), and point R is the intersection with the right boundary (x = 8, y between 0 and 1). \n\nWait, so the line goes from point A (-5, 4) through B (-1, 3) and extends to the left and right. So, the direction vector should be consistent across the entire line, not just the segment AB.\n\nLet me find the equation of line AB first. To do that, I can compute the slope.\n\nSlope \\( m \\) is \\( (y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1) \\). Plugging in points A (-5, 4) and B (-1, 3):\n\n\\("

But the direction vector given in the problem is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Let's see if that's consistent with the slope.\n\nThe slope is rise over run, so \\( m = \\text{change in y} / \\text{change in x} \\). In the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), the change in x is -7 and the change in y is \\( b \\). Therefore, the slope would be \\( b / (-7) \\). Since we already found the slope is -1/4, setting them equal:\n\n\\( b / (-7) = -1/4 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( b \\):\n\nMultiply both sides by -7:\n\n\\( b = (-1/4) * (-7) = 7/4 \\)\n\nWait, that gives \\( b = 7/4 \\). But let me check again because maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the direction vector can be scaled. The direction vector doesn't have to be exactly the displacement from A to B. Since direction vectors can be any scalar multiple, but in the problem it's fixed with an x-component of -7, so we can find the corresponding y-component.\n\nAlternatively, the direction vector of a line with slope \\( m \\) is proportional to \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ m \\end{pmatrix} \\), but since the slope here is -1/4, that would be \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1/4 \\end{pmatrix} \\). To get a direction vector with x-component -7, we can scale this vector by -28? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the direction vector can be written as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta x \\\\ \\Delta y \\end{pmatrix} \\), so if the slope is \\( m = \\Delta y / \\Delta x = -1/4 \\), then \\( \\Delta y = (-1/4) \\Delta x \\).\n\nIf the direction vector"

So:\n\n\\( b / (-7) = -1/4 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by (-7):\n\n\\( b = (-7)*(-1/4) = 7/4 \\)\n\nSo \\( b = 7/4 \\). Hmm, but let me verify if that makes sense with the points. Let's see, if we go -7 in x and 7/4 in y, the slope is (7/4)/(-7) = -1/4, which is correct. So that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using another method. Let's consider the parametric equations of the line. Since we have points A and B, we can write parametric equations for the line.\n\nLet’s set point A as the reference, so when parameter \\( t = 0 \\), we are at A. Then for \\( t = 1 \\), we are at B. So:\n\n\\( x = -5 + t*(-1 - (-5)) = -5 + t*4 \\)\n\\( y = 4 + t*(3 - 4) = 4 + t*(-1) \\)\n\nSo parametric equations:\n\n\\( x = -5 + 4t \\)\n\\( y = 4 - t \\)\n\nBut in the problem, the direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, for some value of \\( t \\), the change in x is -7 and the change in y is \\( b \\). Let me express this.\n\nFrom the parametric equations:\n\nIf we move from some \\( t = k \\) to \\( t = k + s \\), then:\n\n\\( \\Delta x = 4s \\)\n\\( \\Delta y = -s \\)\n\nWe need \\( \\Delta x = -7 \\) and \\( \\Delta y = b \\). So,\n\n\\( 4s = -7 \\Rightarrow s = -7/4 \\)\n\\( -s = b \\Rightarrow s = -b \\)\n\nSo from \\( s = -7/4 = -b \\), we get \\( b ="

The direction vector from A to B is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, any direction vector parallel to this would be a scalar multiple. The problem's direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, we need to find a scalar \\( k \\) such that:\n\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nWait, but that would mean:\n\n-7 = 4k\n\nand\n\nb = -k\n\nSolving for k from the first equation: k = -7/4\n\nThen substituting into the second equation: b = -(-7/4) = 7/4. So that's the same answer again.\n\nTherefore, all methods point to \\( b = 7/4 \\). Wait, but let me check the Asymptote code again to make sure I didn't misinterpret the points.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code:\n\npair A, B, L, R;\nA = (-5,4);\nB = (-1,3);\n\nYes, so points A and B are indeed (-5,4) and (-1,3). So the direction vector between them is (4, -1). So scaling that to get the x-component as -7, so scaling factor is -7/4, so the y-component would be -1 * (-7/4) = 7/4. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the direction vector in the opposite direction? Let me see.\n\nWait, the direction vector given is (-7, b). The direction from A to B is (4, -1). So if we want a direction vector pointing in the opposite direction, it would be (-4, 1). But scaling that to get x-component -7, so scaling factor would be (-7)/(-4) = 7/4, so then the y-component would be 1*(7/4) = 7/4. So either way, whether you take the direction from A to B or the opposite, you"
