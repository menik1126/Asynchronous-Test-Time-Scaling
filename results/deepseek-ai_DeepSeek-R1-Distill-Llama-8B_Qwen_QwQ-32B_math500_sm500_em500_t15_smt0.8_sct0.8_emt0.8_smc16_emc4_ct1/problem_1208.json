The direction vector is given as (-7, b). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the direction vector of a line tells us the slope of the line. So if the direction vector is (-7, b), that means for every -7 units we move in the x-direction, we move 'b' units in the y-direction. Therefore, the slope of the line is rise over run, which would be b divided by -7. So slope = b / (-7) or slope = -b/7.\n\nNow, I need to find the slope of the given line from the Asymptote figure. The figure is on a coordinate grid, and there are two points labeled A and B. Point A is (-5, 4) and point B is (-1, 3). I think these are two points on the line, so I can use them to calculate the slope of the line.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The Asymptote code is drawing the line from points A to B, which are defined as (-5,4) and (-1,3). So yes, those two points lie on the line, and the direction vector is derived from these points.\n\nOkay, so to find the slope between points A and B, I use the formula:\n\nslope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nLet me plug in the coordinates. Point A is (-5, 4), so x1 = -5, y1 = 4. Point B is (-1, 3), so x2 = -1, y2 = 3.\n\nSo, m = (3 - 4) / (-1 - (-5)) = (-1) / (4) = -1/4.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the direction vector is (-7, b), so the slope is -b/7. If I got the slope as -1/4, then I can set up the equation:\n\n-b / 7 = -1 / 4\n\nSolving for b:\n\nMultiply both sides by 7: -b = -7/4\n\nThen multiply both sides by -1: b = 7/4\n\nWait"

Let me check my calculation again.\n\nHold on, calculating the slope between A(-5,4) and B(-1,3):\n\nChange in y: 3 - 4 = -1\n\nChange in x: -1 - (-5) = -1 + 5 = 4\n\nSo slope is -1/4. That's correct. So slope is -1/4. \n\nSince the direction vector is given as (-7, b), the slope from direction vector is (b)/(-7) → since slope is Δy / Δx. \n\nWait, direction vector is <Δx, Δy>, so slope = Δy / Δx. So direction vector components are (Δx, Δy) = (-7, b). Therefore, slope is b / (-7). \n\nSo slope = b / (-7) = -1/4. \n\nTherefore, solving for b:\n\nb / (-7) = -1/4 → Multiply both sides by -7:\n\nb = (-1/4)*(-7) = 7/4. \n\nHmm, so that gives me b = 7/4. But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in direction vector components?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction vector is from point A to point B. Let's see. The direction vector from A to B would be (B - A). \n\nSo coordinates of B minus coordinates of A: \n\nx-component: -1 - (-5) = 4\n\ny-component: 3 - 4 = -1\n\nSo the direction vector from A to B is (4, -1). \n\nBut the problem states that the direction vector is of the form (-7, b). So perhaps they want a direction vector that's a scalar multiple of (4, -1). \n\nSo if (4, -1) is the direction vector, then any scalar multiple of that is also a direction vector. \n\nSo if we want a direction vector where the x-component is -7, then we can set up the equation:\n\n4 * k = -7 → k = -7/4\n\nThen the y-component would be -1 * k = -1*(-7/4) = 7/4. \n\nTherefore, the direction vector would be (-7, 7/4), so b is 7/4. \n\nSo that seems consistent"

Since our calculated slope from points A and B is -1/4, setting:\n\nb/(-7) = -1/4 → b = (-1/4)*(-7) = 7/4.\n\nHence, b is 7/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the line itself. If the line is going from A(-5,4) to B(-1,3), and it crosses the x-axis, which points L and R are shown on the Asymptote figure. But actually, perhaps I don't need that because I already have two points and can compute the direction vector.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, points L and R are the intersections of the line with the y-axis and x-axis respectively. But I don't think that's needed for computing the slope, because I can get the slope from points A and B. So I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe to confirm, I can check the equation of the line using points A and B and see if the slope is indeed -1/4.\n\nSo, using point A(-5,4) and slope -1/4, the equation is:\n\ny - 4 = (-1/4)(x + 5)\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = (-1/4)x - 5/4 + 4\n\ny = (-1/4)x + 11/4\n\nNow, if this line crosses the x-axis at point R, which is (8,0) according to the Asymptote code.

So the line is drawn from L to R, which are the intersections at x=-8 and x=8.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can use these points to find the equation of the line?\n\nAlternatively, since I have points A and B, which are on the line, I can use them to find the equation, but when I did that, plugging in y=0 gave me x=11, but according to the Asymptote code, R is at (8,0).

But since I don't have L and R, that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the direction vector using points L and R.\n\nBut since L is at (-8, something) and R is at (8,0), perhaps I can find the direction vector from L to R, then compare it to (-7, b).\n\nWait, let me think. If I can find the coordinates of L and R, then the direction vector from L to R would be from (-8, y_L) to (8,0). So the direction vector would be (16, -y_L). Since the given direction vector is (-7, b), maybe I can find a relationship there.\n\nWait, but I don't know y_L, because point L is the intersection at x=-8, so I need to find the y-coordinate when x=-8 on the line AB.\n\nLet me use the equation I found earlier: y = (-1/4)x + 11/4.\n\nPlugging x=-8:\n\ny = (-1/4)*(-8) + 11/4 = 2 + 11/4 = 8/4 + 11/4 = 19/4 ≈ 4.75.\n\nWait, so point L is at (-8, 19/4), which is (-8, 4.75), and point R is at (8,0).

So now I have conflicting results. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, this is a problem. The problem says the line is parameterized with direction vector (-7, b). So the direction vector can be any scalar multiple, so the direction vector from points A to B is (4, -1), which is equivalent to direction vector (-7, b). So to get from (4, -1) to (-7, b), we can scale by a factor. Let me see:\n\nSuppose direction vector (4, -1) is scaled by some factor k to get (-7, b).

So that suggests that the direction vector (-7, 7/4) is not the same as AB's direction vector (4,-1).\n\nWait, but direction vectors are just directions, they don't have to be the same as the vector between specific points. If they parameterize the line with direction vector (-7, b), it just needs to be a direction vector of the line, which must be parallel to AB. So scaling factors are allowed.\n\nFor instance, the direction vector (4, -1) can be scaled by any real number, so to get a direction vector with x-component -7, we compute the scaling factor as -7 divided by original x-component 4, which is -7/4. Then multiply the y-component by the same factor: -1 * (-7/4) = 7/4. So that gives the direction vector (-7, 7/4).\n\nTherefore, even if the parameterization is using a different scaling, the direction vector just needs to be a scalar multiple. So the key is that the direction vector must have the same slope. Since slope is (Δy)/(Δx) = (7/4)/(-7) = -1/4, which matches the slope between A and B. \n\nHence, my conclusion is that b is 7/4.\n\nPerhaps the confusion with the x-intercept at (8,0) comes from the Asymptote drawing, which might be scaled or labeled incorrectly, but since the coordinates of A and B are given, we should rely on that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the Asymptote coordinates for points A and B? Let me check again: the code says A = (-5,4); B = (-1,3); so that's correct.\n\nThus, I think the answer is 7/4. Maybe the figure is slightly inaccurate, but the question says \"Please answer the following problem using step-by-step reasoning\" so the coordinates given in the Asymptote code should be authoritative. \n\nTherefore, the value of b is 7/4, which is 1.75. \n\nSo I'll put my answer as \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{4"
