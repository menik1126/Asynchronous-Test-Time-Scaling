This difference is often denoted as \"d\".\n\nGiven the fourth term (a₄) is 200 and the eighth term (a₈) is 500, I can express these terms using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)d.\n\nStarting with the fourth term:\na₄ = a₁ + 3d = 200\n\nNext, for the eighth term:\na₈ = a₁ + 7d = 500\n\nNow, I can set up a system of equations:\n1. a₁ + 3d = 200\n2. a₁ + 7d = 500\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate a₁:\n( a₁ + 7d ) - ( a₁ + 3d ) = 500 - 200\nThis simplifies to:\n4d = 300\nTherefore, d = 75.\n\nWith the value of d, I can find a₁ by substituting back into the fourth term equation:\na₁ + 3(75) = 200\na₁ + 225 = 200\nThus, a₁ = -25.\n\nFinally, to find the sixth term (a₆), I use the same formula:\na₆ = a₁ + 5d\nPlugging in the known values:\na₆ = -25 + 5(75) = -25 + 375 = 350.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** If the fourth term of an arithmetic sequence is \\(200\\) and the eighth term is \\(500\\), what is the sixth term?\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Arithmetic Sequence**\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a constant difference \\(d\\) to the previous term. The \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(a_n\\) is the \\(n\\)-th term,\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n- \\(d\\) is the common difference,\n- \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information**\n\nWe are given:\n- The fourth term (\\("
