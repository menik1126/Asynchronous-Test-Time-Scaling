            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this equation: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer. So it's x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, let's see how to approach this. \n\nFirst off, the equation has a square root in it, which means I might need to do some squaring to eliminate it. But before I get ahead of myself, maybe I should isolate the square root term to make things easier. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. If I subtract 4 from both sides, I get x - 4 = √(11 - 2x). That seems like a good first step because now the square root is by itself on one side of the equation. \n\nNow, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. Let me do that. If I square the left side, (x - 4)^2, that should equal the square of the right side, which is just (11 - 2x). So expanding the left side: (x - 4)^2 is x² - 8x + 16. On the right side, it's just 11 - 2x. So putting that together, I have x² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x.\n\nWait, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all terms to one side so that I can set the equation equal to zero. Subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides. So adding 2x gives me x² - 6x + 16 = 11 - 2x + 2x, which simplifies to x² - 6x + 16 = 11. Then subtracting 11 from both sides: x² - 6x + 5 = 0.\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 6x + 5 = 0. Let me try to factor this. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, 1 and 5. Since they need to add up to -6 and multiply to +5, both numbers must be negative."

            "output": " So, -1 and -5. Yes, that works because (-1) + (-5) = -6 and (-1)*(-5)=+5. So, the equation factors as (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero: x - 1 = 0 → x = 1; x - 5 = 0 → x = 5. So, my potential solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. \n\nBut wait, I squared both sides of the equation earlier, which sometimes can introduce extraneous solutions. I need to check both of these solutions in the original equation to make sure they actually work. So let's do that.\n\nFirst, testing x = 1: Plug into the original equation, x = √(11 - 2x) + 4.\n\nLeft side: x = 1.\n\nRight side: √(11 - 2*1) + 4 = √(11 - 2) + 4 = √9 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nSo, 1 does not equal 7. That means x = 1 is an extraneous solution and should be discarded.\n\nNow, testing x = 5: Plug into the original equation.\n\nLeft side: x = 5.\n\nRight side: √(11 - 2*5) + 4 = √(11 - 10) + 4 = √1 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nSo, 5 equals 5. That works! Therefore, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me just make sure I didn't miss any other possible solutions. Maybe I should consider whether there are more than two solutions. Hmm, in this case, the quadratic equation only gave me two roots, and we've checked both. Since the original equation is a transformation of a square root function and a linear function, they can intersect at most two times, so two solutions make sense here.\n\nAnother thing to check is the domain of the original equation because the square root requires that the expression inside be non-negative. So, the expression under the square root is 11 - 2x. So, 11 - 2x ≥ 0 → 2x ≤ 11 → x ≤ 5.5.\n\nSo, our solutions must be less than or equal to"

            "output": " 5.5. Both x = 1 and x = 5 are within this domain, but since x =1 didn't work, only x=5 is valid. \n\nAlso, when we squared both sides, we might have introduced an extraneous solution, which in this case was x=1. So, the only valid solution is x=5.\n\nHmm, let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in algebra.\n\nOriginal equation: x = √(11 - 2x) +4.\n\nSubtract 4: x -4 = √(11 -2x).\n\nSquare both sides: (x -4)^2 = 11 -2x.\n\nExpand left side: x² -8x +16 = 11 -2x.\n\nBring all terms to left: x² -8x +16 -11 +2x =0 → x² -6x +5 =0. That's correct.\n\nFactoring: (x-1)(x-5)=0. So x=1 and x=5. Then checking in original equation, only x=5 works. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the only solution is x=5. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe graphing? If I graph y = x and y = √(11 -2x) +4, the intersection point should be at x=5. Let me see:\n\nFor y = x, it's a straight line. The other function is a square root function shifted. The square root part √(11-2x) is a square root that's decreasing because of the -2x, so it's a reflection over the y-axis and scaled, then shifted up by 4. The intersection at x=5 would be at (5,5). When x=5, the square root part is √(1)=1, plus 4 is 5. That's correct. \n\nAt x=1, the square root part would be √(9)=3, plus 4 is 7, so the point (1,7) is on the right-hand side function, but the left-hand side at x=1 is 1, so they don't intersect there. \n\nTherefore, I think that's solid.
