            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\). Hmm, it looks like a radical equation since there's a square root in there. I remember that to solve radical equations, I should probably isolate the square root term first and then square both sides to eliminate it. Let me try that step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the equation again: \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\). I need to get rid of that square root. So, I can subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the square root. Let's do that:\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n\\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\)\n\nOkay, so now the square root is by itself on the right side. The next step is to square both sides to get rid of the square root. That should help me solve for x. So, squaring both sides:\n\n\\( (x - 4)^2 = (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 \\)\n\nCalculating both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 \\) because \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\nRight side: \\( 11 - 2x \\) because squaring a square root just gives the original expression.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\\( x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\)\n\nHmm, okay, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side to set the equation to zero. I'll subtract \\(11 - 2x\\) from both sides:\n\nSubtract \\(11 - 2x\\) from both sides:\n\\( x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify the terms:\nCombine \\( -8x + 2x \\) to get \\( -6x \\).\nCombine \\( 16 - 11 \\) to get \\( 5 \\).\n\nSo the equation is:\n\\( x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\)\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and I can try to factor it. Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6.\n\nThe factors of "

So, -1 and -5 multiply to +5 and add up to -6.\n\nSo, factoring the quadratic:\n\\( (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 \\)\n\nTherefore, the solutions are:\n\\( x = 1 \\) or \\( x = 5 \\)\n\nBut wait, I can't forget that I squared both sides earlier, which can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. I need to check each solution in the original equation to make sure it works.\n\nFirst, let's check \\( x = 1 \\):\nPlug into the original equation:\nLeft side: \\( 1 \\)\nRight side: \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2(1)} + 4 = \\sqrt{9} + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 1 \\) vs. \\( 7 \\). That doesn't work. So, \\( x = 1 \\) is an extraneous solution and should be discarded.\n\nNow, let's check \\( x = 5 \\):\nPlug into the original equation:\nLeft side: \\( 5 \\)\nRight side: \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4 = \\sqrt{1} + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 5 \\) vs. \\( 5 \\). That works. So, \\( x = 5 \\) is the valid solution.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I did everything correctly. Did I make any calculation mistakes?\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. Original equation: \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\)\n2. Subtract 4: \\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\)\n3. Square both sides: \\( (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x \\)\n4. Expand left side: \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\)\n5. Bring all terms to left: \\( x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\)\n6. Factor: \\( (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0 \\)\n7. Solutions: \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 5"

So, only \\( x = 5 \\) is the solution.\n\nI just want to double-check the squaring step because sometimes when squaring both sides, the equality can be affected. But in this case, since \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\) is a real number, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative.\n\nSo, let's also find the domain of the original equation.\n\nFor \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\) to be real, \\( 11 - 2x \\geq 0 \\)\nWhich means:\n\\( 11 \\geq 2x \\)\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\( x \\leq \\frac{11}{2} \\) or \\( x \\leq 5.5 \\)\n\nSo, any solution must be less than or equal to 5.5. Our solutions are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\). Both are less than 5.5, so that's good.\n\nBut we already saw that \\( x = 1 \\) doesn't satisfy the original equation, so only \\( x = 5 \\) works.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me plug \\( x = 1 \\) again into the square root expression to see if it's even valid. If the square root is of a negative number, it's not real, and that would have been an error.\n\nSo, plugging \\( x = 1 \\):\n\\( \\sqrt{11 - 2(1)} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\). So, that's valid. But when substituting back into the original equation, it didn't work because \\( 1 \\) didn't equal \\( 7 \\).\n\nSo, \\( x = 1 \\) is just an extraneous solution from squaring both sides. So, it's not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nWait, another thought: when we squared both sides, the left side was \\( (x - 4)^2 \\) and the right side was \\( 11 - 2x \\). So, if I consider \\( (x - 4)^2 = 11 -"

The left side is a linear function \\( y = x \\), and the right side is \\( y = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\). The intersection point should be at x = 5. But since I can't graph here, I'll stick with algebra.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another way to approach the problem, just to confirm.\n\nSuppose I let \\( y = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\). Then the original equation is \\( x = y + 4 \\). So, substituting back, \\( y = x - 4 \\). Then, since \\( y = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\), so:\n\n\\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\)\n\nWhich is exactly the same equation as before. So, squaring again gives the same quadratic. So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the domain again. Since the square root is non-negative, \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\geq 0 \\), so the right-hand side of the original equation is \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\geq 4 \\). Therefore, the left-hand side must also be at least 4. So, \\( x \\geq 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the domain for x is \\( x \\geq 4 \\) and \\( x \\leq 5.5 \\). So, x must be between 4 and 5.5. \n\nWait, that's an important point. The original equation requires that \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\). Since the square root is non-negative, the right-hand side is at least 4, so x must be at least 4. Therefore, the domain is actually \\( 4 \\leq x \\leq 5.5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the solution x = 1 is not in this domain (since 1 < 4), so it's invalid. So, that's another way to see why x =1 is extraneous. \n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is x =5, which is within the domain [4, 5"

I've cross-checked by plugging the solution back into the original equation, checked the domain, reconsidered the steps, and everything points to x =5 being the only solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), we start by isolating the square root term. \n\n1. Subtract 4 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x}\n   \\]\n\n2.

Check each solution in the original equation:\n   - For \\( x = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     1 \\neq \\sqrt{11 - 2(1)} + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\n     \\]\n     Thus, \\( x = 1 \\) is extraneous.\n   - For \\( x = 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     5 = \\sqrt{11 - 2(5)} + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\n     \\]\n     Thus, \\( x = 5 \\) is valid.\n\n7.
