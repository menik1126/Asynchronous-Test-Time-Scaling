It says that this equation has 10 complex roots, which are paired as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). I need to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\). \n\nFirst off, I recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to the modulus squared of \\(r\\), which is \\(|r|^2\\). Also, \\(\\frac{1}{r\\overline{r}} = \\frac{1}{|r|^2}\\), which is a real, non-negative number. So each term in the sum I'm supposed to compute is essentially the reciprocal of the squared modulus of each root \\(r_i\\).\n\nLooking at the equation, it's a polynomial of degree 10, which means there are 10 roots (counting multiplicities and considering complex ones). The equation can be rewritten as \\(x^{10} = -(13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides might be tricky because of the negative sign, but perhaps I can factor this somehow or use substitution.\n\nWait, if I let \\(y = 13x - 1\\), then the equation becomes \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\), which can be factored as \\((x + y)(x^9 - x^8 y + x^7 y^2 - \\cdots - x y^8 + y^9) = 0\\). Since it's a degree 10 polynomial, this makes sense. So one root is \\(x = -y\\), which is \\(x = -(13x - 1)\\). Let me solve that equation: \\(x = -13x + 1\\), which simplifies to \\(14x = 1\\), so \\(x = \\frac{1}{14"

Hmm, so \\(x = \\frac{1}{14}\\) is one real root.\n\nBut the other roots satisfy the other factor, the ninth-degree polynomial \\(x^9 - x^8 y + x^7 y^2 - \\cdots - x y^8 + y^9 = 0\\). Since \\(y = 13x - 1\\), substituting back in, this becomes a complicated polynomial in x. I'm not sure how to handle this directly.\n\nMaybe another approach: consider that the equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\) can be seen as \\( \\left( x + (13x - 1) \\right)^{10} \\) but wait, that's not quite right because the expansion of \\((a + b)^{10}\\) includes all cross terms, but our equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\), which is different. Hmm, perhaps not the right way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this in terms of roots of a polynomial. Let me define a transformation. Let me set \\(z = x\\), so the equation becomes \\(z^{10} + (13z - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Hmm, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider dividing both sides by \\(x^{10}\\) (assuming \\(x \\neq 0\\), which should be okay because if \\(x=0\\), then the equation becomes \\(0 + (-1)^{10} = 1 \\neq 0\\), so x=0 is not a root). Dividing by \\(x^{10}\\) gives \\(1 + \\left( \\frac{13x - 1}{x} \\right)^{10} = 0\\). Let me set \\(w = \\frac{13x - 1}{x}\\), which simplifies to \\(w = 13 - \\frac{1}{x}\\). So substituting back, we have \\(1 + w^{10} = 0\\), which implies \\(w^{10} = -1\\).\n\nSo \\(w\\) is a 10th root of -1. The 10th roots of -1 can be written as \\(e^{(2k + 1)\\pi i /10}\\) for \\(k"

Since each root x corresponds to a unique w, so there are 10 terms in the sum, each term being |13 - w|^2. Therefore, the total sum over all roots is 1700, so the sum over the five conjugate pairs (each pair contributing once) would be 1700 divided by 2, since each pair's term is counted twice in the total sum. Wait, actually, no. Wait, each pair contributes two terms in the total sum (since each pair has two roots, each with their own w and conjugate w). But since the terms for w and its conjugate give the same |13 - w|^2 and |13 - \\overline{w}|^2, which are equal. Therefore, each pair contributes 2 * |13 - w|^2. Wait, but actually, each pair corresponds to two different w's (w and \\overline{w}), so their contributions are |13 - w|^2 + |13 - \\overline{w}|^2 = 2 |13 - w|^2 (since |13 - \\overline{w}|^2 = |13 - w|^2 because modulus squared is the same for a complex number and its conjugate). Therefore, each pair contributes 2 |13 - w|^2, so the total sum over all roots is Sum_{pairs} 2 |13 - w|^2. Therefore, the total sum is 2 * (sum over each pair's term). Therefore, the desired sum S is (total sum)/2 = 1700 /2 = 850. \n\nWait, but hold on, let me think again. Let me see:\n\nEach pair (r_j, \\overline{r"

Therefore, since there are five such pairs, the total sum over all roots is 5 * 2 |13 - w|^2 = 10 |13 - w|^2 summed over all w. Wait, no, that's not correct because for each pair, w is a unique root, not all w.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me perhaps think in terms of what the sum S is: S is the sum over each pair of 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |13 - w_j|^2, where w_j are the five distinct 10th roots of -1. Since each conjugate pair in the roots corresponds to a pair of w and \\overline{w}, and for each such pair, their contributions to the total sum (if we summed over all roots) would be |13 - w|^2 + |13 - \\overline{w}|^2 = 2 |13 - w|^2, as |13 - \\overline{w}|^2 = |13 - w|^2.\n\nTherefore, if the total sum over all roots is Sum_{all w} |13 - w|^2 = 1700, which includes all 10 roots. Since the roots are grouped into 5 pairs, each pair contributes 2 |13 - w|^2, so 5 pairs give 5 * 2 |13 - w|^2, but wait, w varies for each pair, so actually, the total sum over all roots is Sum_{j=1}^5 [ |13 - w_j|^2 + |13 - \\overline{w_j}|^2 ] = Sum_{j=1}^5 2 |13 - w_j|^2 = 2 Sum_{j=1}^5 |13 - w_j|^2. Therefore, the total sum over all roots is 2 Sum_{j=1}^5 |13 - w_j|^2 = 1700. Hence, Sum_{j=1}^5 |13 - w_j|^2 = 1700 / 2 = 850. \n\n"
