The question mentions that the roots come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). So, there are five pairs of complex conjugates as roots.\n\nThe problem is asking me to find the value of the sum:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3\\overline{r}_3} + \\frac{1}{r_4\\overline{r}_4} + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}.\n\\]\nHmm. I need to figure out what each \\( \\frac{1}{r_k\\overline{r}_k} \\) represents and then sum them up. Since each \\( r_k \\) is a root, their conjugates \\( \\overline{r}_k \\) must also be roots because the coefficients of the polynomial are real, right? So, complex roots come in conjugate pairs.\n\nI remember that for a complex number \\( z \\), the product \\( z\\overline{z} \\) is the square of the modulus of \\( z \\), which is \\( |z|^2 \\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{r_k\\overline{r}_k} = \\frac{1}{|r_k|^2} \\). That means each term in the sum is the reciprocal of the squared modulus of each root.\n\nTherefore, the entire sum is \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_k|^2} \\).\n\nSo, I need to find the sum of reciprocals of squared moduli of the roots. Now, how can I relate this to the given polynomial?\n\nI recall that for a polynomial, the sum of reciprocals of squared moduli can be related to the coefficients.

Let me see:\n\nSuppose we write \\( (13 - y)^{10} = -1 \\). The left side is a polynomial in y with real coefficients, and the right side is -1, so the equation is with real coefficients. Therefore, the roots must come in complex conjugate pairs. Therefore, the roots y_k and their conjugates are also roots.

Therefore, as previously thought, the sum over all roots is twice the sum over five roots (since each pair contributes |y_i|^2 + |\\overline{y_i}|^2 = 2|y_i|^2). Therefore, the sum over five roots is half of 1700.\n\nHence, the desired sum is 1700 / 2 = 850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, in our earlier computation, we found that the total sum over all 10 roots is 1700. Since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each contributing |y_i|^2 + |y_j|^2 where y_j is the conjugate. Therefore, the sum over all roots is 2*(sum over five roots of |y_i|^2). Therefore, 2*(desired sum) = 1700 => desired sum = 1700 / 2 = 850.\n\nBut I should verify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of it this way: because each pair contributes |y_i|^2 + |\\overline{y_i}|^2 = 2 |y_i|^2. Since the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots come in pairs y and \\overline{y}, so indeed, summing over all roots gives us twice the sum over one of each pair.\n\nHence, since we have 10 roots, with five pairs, the total sum is 2*(sum over each pair |y_i|^2). Therefore, the sum over each pair is (sum over all roots)/2, but since each pair is separate, and the desired sum is over each y_i once, and they are"

Which is correct, since r_k \\overline{r}_k = |r_k|^2. So, the problem is asking for the sum of 1/|r_k|^2 for each pair. But earlier, I computed the sum of |y_k|^2 over all roots y_k, where y_k = 1/r_k. Since y_k = 1/r_k, then |y_k|^2 = 1/|r_k|^2. Therefore, the sum over all roots y of |y|^2 is equal to the sum over all roots r of 1/|r|^2. But since the roots come in conjugate pairs, the sum over all roots y of |y|^2 is equal to the sum over all roots r of 1/|r|^2. But since each pair r and \\overline{r} contribute 1/|r|^2 + 1/|\\overline{r}|^2 = 2/|r|^2. Wait, but actually, each pair r and \\overline{r} in the original equation correspond to y and \\overline{y} in the transformed equation. Wait, but in the transformed equation, the roots are y = 1/r, so each pair r and \\overline{r} correspond to y and \\overline{y} (since 1/\\overline{r} is the conjugate of 1/r).
