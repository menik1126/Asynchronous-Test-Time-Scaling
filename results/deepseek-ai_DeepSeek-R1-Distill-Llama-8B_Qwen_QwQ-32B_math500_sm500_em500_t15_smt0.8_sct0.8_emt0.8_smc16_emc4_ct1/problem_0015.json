            "output": "Alright, I need to solve this problem about a cubic polynomial P(x). Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so I can write P(x) as x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nNext, it mentions that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). I know that when a polynomial is divided by a quadratic, the remainder will be linear, so R(x) is probably something like dx + e.\n\nAlso, P(0) is given as 5. Since P(0) is the constant term c, that tells me c = 5.\n\nNow, let me recall the Remainder Theorem. The remainder when a polynomial P(x) is divided by (x - k) is P(k). But here, we're dividing by a product of two linear factors. So, I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or polynomial remainder concepts.\n\nSince when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So, I can write:\n\nP(1) = R(1)\nP(4) = R(4)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so:\n\nP(2) = 2R(2)\nP(3) = 2R(3)\n\nSince R(x) is a linear polynomial, I can write R(x) = mx + n. So, now I have:\n\nP(1) = m*1 + n\nP(4) = m*4 + n\n\nAnd also:\n\nP(2) = 2*(m*2 + n)\nP(3) = 2*(m*3 + n)\n\nSo, I can set up four equations:\n\n1) P(1) = m + n\n2) P(4) = 4m + n\n3) P(2) = 4m + 2n\n4) P(3) = 6m +"

Since P(x) is divided by (x-1)(x-4) with remainder R(x)=-2x -5.\n\nSo, can I write P(x)= (x-1)(x-4)Q1(x) -2x -5.\n\nSimilarly, P(x) divided by (x-2)(x-3) is 2R(x)=2*(-2x -5)= -4x -10.\n\nSo, P(x)= (x-2)(x-3)Q2(x) -4x -10.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated, but maybe evaluating at P(5).\n\nAlternatively, since I know R(x)=-2x-5, then P(5)=R(5)+ (5-1)(5-4)*something.\n\nWait, when you divide by (x-1)(x-4), the quotient is Q1(x), and P(x)= (x-1)(x-4)Q1(x) + R(x).
