Monic means the leading coefficient is 1. So, P(x) looks like x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find or use to find P(5).\n\nThe problem says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Then, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we're given that P(0) = 5. The goal is to find P(5).\n\nHmm. Let me recall that when a polynomial is divided by another polynomial, say a quadratic like (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder will be of lower degree, so in this case, it will be a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) is linear, which means R(x) can be written as dx + e, where d and e are constants.\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), which is also quadratic, the remainder R(x) will again be linear, but in this case, the remainder is 2R(x). Wait, so when divided by the second quadratic, the remainder is twice R(x). That's interesting.\n\nAlso, since P(x) is a cubic, dividing by a quadratic will give a linear quotient and a linear remainder. So, we can express P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nwhere Q1(x) is a linear polynomial (degree 1), and R(x) is linear, as I said.\n\nSimilarly, P(x) can also be written as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nwhere Q2(x) is also linear.\n\nSo, I have two expressions for P(x). Maybe I can set them equal to each other:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nLet"

Since R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), then evaluating P(x) at x = 1 and x = 4 should give us R(1) and R(4).\n\nSimilarly, since R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), perhaps evaluating P(x) at x = 2 and x = 3 will give us R(2) and R(3). But wait, but it's given that the remainder in that division is 2R(x), so when x = 2 and x = 3, P(2) and P(3) would be 2R(2) and 2R(3), respectively.\n\nLet me write down the equations I can get from this.\n\nFirst, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So,\n\nP(1) = R(1)\nP(4) = R(4)\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So,\n\nP(2) = 2R(2)\nP(3) = 2R(3)\n\nAlso, P(0) = 5. Since P(x) is a cubic, let's note that P(0) is the constant term c, so c = 5. So P(0) = 5.\n\nSo far, I have some equations:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n3. P(2) = 2R(2)\n4. P(3) = 2R(3)\n5. P(0) = 5\n\nAlso, since R(x) is a linear polynomial, let's denote R(x) = mx + n. So R(1) = m + n, R(2) = 2m + n"
