The rule is to alternately add and multiply by each successive integer starting from 1.\n\nLet's list out the terms step by step to see the pattern:\n\n1. Term 1: 0\n2. Term 2: 0 + 1 = 1\n3. Term 3: 1 × 1 = 1\n4. Term 4: 1 + 2 = 3\n5. Term 5: 3 × 2 = 6\n6. Term 6: 6 + 3 = 9\n7. Term 7: 9 × 3 = 27\n8. Term 8: 27 + 4 = 31\n9. Term 9: 31 × 4 = 124\n10. Term 10: 124 + 5 = 129\n\nUpon reaching Term 10, the value is 129, which is the first term greater than 125.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to find the first term greater than 125.\n\n1. **Term 1:** 0\n2. **Term 2:** \\(0 + 1 = 1\\)\n3. **Term 3:** \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n4. **Term 4:** \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n5. **Term 5:** \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\)\n6. **Term 6:** \\(6 + 3 = 9\\)\n7. **Term 7:** \\(9 \\times 3 = 27\\)\n8. **Term 8:** \\(27 + 4 = 31\\)\n9. **Term 9:** \\(31 \\times 4 = 124\\)\n10. **Term 10:** \\(124 + 5 = 129\\)\n\nAfter calculating each subsequent term, we find that the **10th term** is the first one that exceeds 125.\n\n\\boxed{129}"

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
