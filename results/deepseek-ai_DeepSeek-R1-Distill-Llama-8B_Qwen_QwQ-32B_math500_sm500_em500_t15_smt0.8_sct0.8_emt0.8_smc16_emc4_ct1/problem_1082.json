Each subsequent term alternates between addition and multiplication with successive integers starting from 1.\n\nLet's break down the sequence step by step:\n\n1. Term 1: 0 (given)\n2. Term 2: Add 1 to Term 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n3. Term 3: Multiply Term 2 by 1 = 1 * 1 = 1\n4. Term 4: Add 2 to Term 3 = 1 + 2 = 3\n5. Term 5: Multiply Term 4 by 2 = 3 * 2 = 6\n6. Term 6: Add 3 to Term 5 = 6 + 3 = 9\n7. Term 7: Multiply Term 6 by 3 = 9 * 3 = 27\n8. Term 8: Add 4 to Term 7 = 27 + 4 = 31\n9. Term 9: Multiply Term 8 by 4 = 31 * 4 = 124\n10. Term 10: Add 5 to Term 9 = 124 + 5 = 129\n\nAt Term 10, the value is 129, which is greater than 125. Therefore, the first term exceeding 125 is 129.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's analyze the given sequence step by step to find the first term greater than 125.\n\n### **Understanding the Sequence**\n\nThe sequence starts with **Term 1 = 0**. Subsequent terms are generated by alternately:\n- **Adding** the next integer\n- **Multiplying** by the next integer\n\nHere's how the sequence progresses:\n\n| **Term** | **Operation**                  | **Result**  | **Explanation**                         |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| 1        | -                               | 0           | Initial term.                           |\n| 2        | + 1                               | 1           | Add 1 to Term 1.                        |\n| 3        | × 1                               | 1           | Multiply Term 2 by 1.                  |\n| 4        | + 2                               | 3          "

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
