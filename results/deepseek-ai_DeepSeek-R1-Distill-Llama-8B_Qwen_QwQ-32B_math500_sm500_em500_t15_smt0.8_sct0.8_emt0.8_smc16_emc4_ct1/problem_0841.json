Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. It wants the maximum value of this fraction. So, I need to maximize the numerator while minimizing the denominator, right? But it's a ratio, so it's not straightforward. Maybe I can use some calculus here, like finding partial derivatives and setting them to zero to find critical points.\n\nLet me denote the function as f(x, y) = (x - y)/(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6). To find its maximum, I need to find the points where the gradient of f is zero. That means computing the partial derivatives with respect to x and y and setting them equal to zero.\n\nSo, let's compute ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y.\n\nStarting with ∂f/∂x:\nUsing the quotient rule, if f = u/v, then ∂f/∂x = (v * ∂u/∂x - u * ∂v/∂x) / v².\n\nHere, u = x - y, so ∂u/∂x = 1.\nv = x⁴ + y⁴ + 6, so ∂v/∂x = 4x³.\n\nTherefore, ∂f/∂x = [ (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6)(1) - (x - y)(4x³) ] / (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6)².\n\nSimilarly, ∂f/∂y:\nAgain, using the quotient rule, u = x - y, so ∂u/∂y = -1.\nv = x⁴ + y⁴ + 6, so ∂v/∂y = 4y³.\n\nThus, ∂f/∂y = [ (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6)(-1) - (x - y)(4y³) ] / (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6)².\n\nNow, to find critical points, both partial derivatives must be zero.

So, the function tends to zero.\n\nSimilarly, if one variable is large and the other is small, the denominator is still large, making the fraction small.\n\nTherefore, the function likely attains its maximum at one of the critical points we found.\n\nTo be thorough, let's check the second derivative test or use the Hessian to confirm whether (1, -1) is a maximum, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since we have only two critical points and the function tends to zero at infinity, the maximum is likely at (1, -1) with value 1/4.\n\nWait, but let me also consider if there are other critical points when, for example, both x and y are zero.\n\nAt x = 0, y = 0: f(0, 0) = 0/(0 + 0 + 6) = 0.\n\nAt x = 0, y = something else: Let's say x = 0.

Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that maybe my substitution approach missed something?\n\nWait, perhaps because when I set y = kx, I might have restricted the variables in a way that doesn't capture the maximum point?\n\nWait, in the case of (1, -1), y = -1, x =1, so k = y/x = -1, so that is exactly the case when t = -1. So, according to the substitution, f(t) at t = -1 is 2^{3/4}/8 ≈ 0.2102, but when we plug into the original function, it's 1/4 = 0.25. So, there must be an error in my substitution steps.\n\nWait, let me recalculate f(t) at t = -1.\n\nWait, f(x, k) when k = -1, so y = -x.

So, perhaps in substituting, I have a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the substitution. I set y = kx, so in the function f(x, y) = (x - y)/(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6) = [x(1 - k)]/[x⁴(1 + k⁴) +6].\n\nBut when I set x = [2/(1 + k⁴)]^{1/4}, then f(x, k) = [x(1 - k)] / [2 + 6] = [x(1 - k)] / 8.\n\nWait, no. The denominator is x⁴(1 + k⁴) +6, which when x⁴(1 +k⁴) =2, as per the critical point, so the denominator is 2 +6 =8.\n\nThus, f(x, k) = [x(1 - k)] / 8.
