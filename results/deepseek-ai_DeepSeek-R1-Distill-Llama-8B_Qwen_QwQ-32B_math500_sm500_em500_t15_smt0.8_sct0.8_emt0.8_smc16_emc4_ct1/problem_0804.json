            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. The polynomial is given as f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0. They told me that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|.\n\nHmm, let me start by recalling that for a polynomial with integer coefficients and integer roots, the polynomial can be factored into linear terms with integer roots. So, since all roots are distinct integers, let's say the roots are r1, r2, ..., rn, which are all integers and different from each other.\n\nGiven that, the polynomial can be written as f(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). The constant term a_0 is 66, which is the product of the roots multiplied by (-1)^n * 2. Wait, no, the constant term is (-1)^n times the product of the roots times the leading coefficient. So, in this case, since a_n is 2, the constant term a_0 is (-1)^n * 2 * (r1 * r2 * ... * rn). They told me a_0 is 66, so:\n\n(-1)^n * 2 * (r1 * r2 * ... * rn) = 66.\n\nSo, the product of the roots, times 2, times (-1)^n, equals 66. That means that the product of the roots is 66 divided by 2 times (-1)^n. So, product of the roots is 33 * (-1)^n.\n\nBut since the roots are integers, and the product is either 33 or -33, depending on n. Wait, because (-1)^n is either 1 or -1. So product of roots is either 33 or -33.\n\nSo, the roots are integers multiplying to 33 or -33, and all distinct. Also, the leading coefficient is 2. So, we need to find such integer roots that when we multiply them, their product is 33 or -33, and when we expand the polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is minimized in absolute value.\n\nI think the"

Let me recall Vieta's formula.\n\nVieta's formula for monic polynomials says that the coefficient of x^{n-1} is - (sum of roots). But here, the polynomial is not monic; it's 2 times the monic polynomial. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the polynomial is f(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Then expanding this, the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to 2 times the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the monic polynomial.\n\nThe coefficient of x^{n-1} in the monic polynomial (x - r1)...(x - rn) is - (r1 + r2 + ... + rn). Therefore, multiplying by 2, the coefficient a_{n-1} is 2 * [ - (r1 + r2 + ... + rn) ].\n\nWait, no, actually, let me verify that. Let me consider expanding (x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). The expansion is x^n - (r1 + r2 + ... + rn)x^{n-1} + ... + (-1)^n (r1 r2 ... rn). Therefore, if we multiply by 2, the coefficient of x^{n-1} becomes -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|.\n\nTherefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize |sum of roots|. Since the roots multiply to either 33 or -33 (depending on n and the sign), we can choose the sign such that the sum is as small as possible in absolute value.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to partitioning 33 or -33 into distinct integers, whose product is 33 or -33 (depending on n's parity), and such that the sum of those integers is as small as possible in absolute value.\n\nWait, but n isn't fixed here. The problem just says the polynomial has degree n. Since the roots are distinct integers, the minimal degree would be 2 (if you have two roots), but if possible with higher degrees? But since n is"

            "output": " not fixed, perhaps using more roots can allow the sum to be smaller.\n\nWait, but 33 and -33 are fixed. The product is fixed, but the number of factors can vary. So, to minimize |sum|, we need to choose the roots such that their product is 33 or -33, they are distinct integers, and their sum has the smallest possible absolute value.\n\nSo, perhaps to minimize |sum|, the roots should be as close to each other as possible, but since 33 isn't a very large number, maybe we can find small integers whose product is 33 or -33, with distinct factors.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 33. 33 = 1 * 3 * 11. Alternatively, 33 can be written as (-1)*(-3)*11, etc. But all roots must be distinct integers. So, let's see the possible sets of roots.\n\nSince 33 is positive or -33 is negative, and we need the product to be positive or negative, depending on the number of negative roots. Since the product is \u00b133, the roots can be all positive or have an odd number of negative roots.\n\nWait, but if all roots are positive, the product is positive. If we have an odd number of negative roots, the product is negative. So, the product is either 33 or -33.\n\nI think to minimize |sum|, perhaps having an even number of negative roots, so that the overall sign is positive, but wait, no: the sum would be affected by the negative roots.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of having both positive and negative roots. Let's see:\n\nCase 1: all roots positive. Then, we need a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 33. The factors of 33 are 1, 3, 11. So, the possible roots are 1, 3, 11. So, the sum is 1 + 3 + 11 = 15. |sum| is 15. So, then |a_{n-1}| is 2*15 = 30.\n\nCase 2: an odd number of negative roots. So, for example, one negative root and the rest positive.

So, (-1)^n * 2 *33 =66 \u21d2 (-1)^n *66 =66 \u21d2 (-1)^n =1 \u21d2 n is even. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, if we have roots with product -33, then (-1)^n *2*(-33)=66 \u21d2 (-1)^n*(-66)=66 \u21d2 (-1)^n = -1 \u21d2 n is odd. So, that's also possible.\n\nWait, so maybe there's another set of roots with product -33 and a smaller sum?\n\nLet me see. Let's try to get a smaller sum with product -33.\n\nSuppose roots are -1, 3, 11. Then product is -1*3*11 = -33. Sum is -1 +3 +11 =13. So |sum| is 13, so |a_{n-1}| is 26.

We need 33x =\u00b133. So, x=\u00b11.\n\nBut then, we already have 1 as a root, so x cannot be 1, as roots must be distinct. If x=-1, then we have two -1s, which is duplication.
