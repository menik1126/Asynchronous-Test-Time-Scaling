It's given that all the coefficients \\( a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_0 \\) are integers, and the polynomial has distinct integer roots. Hmm, that means it must be a monic polynomial, right? Wait, no, because \\( a_n \\) is given as 2. So it's not monic. Hmm, okay.\n\nSince the polynomial has distinct integer roots, I can express it in its factored form as \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n) \\), where each \\( r_i \\) is an integer. That makes sense because when expanded, the leading coefficient will be 2, and all coefficients will be integers.\n\nGiven that \\( a_0 = 66 \\), which is the constant term. In the factored form, the constant term is \\( 2(-1)^n r_1r_2\\cdots r_n \\). So, \\( 2(-1)^n r_1r_2\\cdots r_n = 66 \\). Therefore, \\( r_1r_2\\cdots r_n = \\frac{66}{2(-1)^n} \\). Simplifying, that's \\( r_1r_2\\cdots r_n = \\frac{33}{(-1)^n} \\).\n\nWait, \\( 66 \\) is positive, so \\( (-1)^n \\) times the product of roots is \\( \\frac{66}{2} = 33 \\). So depending on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd, the product of roots will be \\( \\frac{33}{1} = 33 \\) or \\( -33 \\). So the product of the roots is \\( \\pm33 \\).\n\nOur goal is to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\). Now, \\( a_{n-1} \\) is the coefficient of \\( x^{n-1} \\) in the polynomial, which in the factored form is \\( 2(-1)^{n-1}(r_1 + r_2 +"
