            "output": "I need to determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are required to fill a spherical tank. \n\nFirst, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * \u03c0 * r\u00b3. Given the radius is 6 cm, plugging in the value gives the tank's volume as 4/3 * \u03c0 * 216, which simplifies to 288\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nNext, I'll find the volume of each cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h, where the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm. Calculating this results in \u03c0 * 9 * 8, which equals 72\u03c0 cm\u00b3 per beaker.\n\nFinally, to find how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the tank's volume by the beaker's volume. Dividing 288\u03c0 by 72\u03c0 gives 4. Therefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA cylindrical beaker is 8 cm high and has a radius of 3 cm.
