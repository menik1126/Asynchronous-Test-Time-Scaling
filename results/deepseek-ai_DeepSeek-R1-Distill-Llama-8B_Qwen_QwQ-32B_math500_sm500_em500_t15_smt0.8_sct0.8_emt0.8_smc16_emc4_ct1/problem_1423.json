            "output": "I need to determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are required to fill a spherical tank. \n\nFirst, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * π * r³. Given the radius is 6 cm, plugging in the value gives the tank's volume as 4/3 * π * 216, which simplifies to 288π cm³.\n\nNext, I'll find the volume of each cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is π * r² * h, where the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm. Calculating this results in π * 9 * 8, which equals 72π cm³ per beaker.\n\nFinally, to find how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the tank's volume by the beaker's volume. Dividing 288π by 72π gives 4. Therefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA cylindrical beaker is 8 cm high and has a radius of 3 cm.
