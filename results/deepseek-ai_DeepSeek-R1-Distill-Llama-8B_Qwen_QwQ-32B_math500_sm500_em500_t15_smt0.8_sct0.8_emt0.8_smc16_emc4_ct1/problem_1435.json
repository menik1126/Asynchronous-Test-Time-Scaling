This means I need to find all \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^{24} = k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nI'll start by analyzing the exponent 24. Since \\( k \\) must also be a power of 2, let's denote \\( k = 2^m \\). Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\n\\[ 2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn} \\]\n\nBy comparing the exponents, I have:\n\n\\[ mn = 24 \\]\n\nNow, I need to find all pairs of positive integers \\( (m, n) \\) where both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are greater than 1 and their product equals 24. Listing all possible factor pairs of 24:\n\n1. \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( n = 12 \\)\n2. \\( m = 3 \\) and \\( n = 8 \\)\n3. \\( m = 4 \\) and \\( n = 6 \\)\n4. \\( m = 6 \\) and \\( n = 4 \\)\n5. \\( m = 8 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\)\n6. \\( m = 12 \\) and \\( n = 2 \\)\n\nEach of these pairs satisfies \\( mn = 24 \\) and \\( n > 1 \\). Therefore, there are 6 positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to find all \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n   - This implies that \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\), i.e., \\( n \\) is a divisor of \\( 24 \\"
