William tried to calculate \\(\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\) but missed the negative sign, resulting in \\(\\frac{3 + 4i}{1 + 2i} = \\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\). Now, we need to find the correct answer he should have obtained.\n\nFirst, I remember that to divide complex numbers, a common method is to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(1 + 2i\\) is \\(1 - 2i\\). This helps eliminate the imaginary unit \\(i\\) from the denominator.\n\nSo, let's apply this method to the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-3 + 4i}{1 + 2i}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both numerator and denominator by \\(1 - 2i\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's expand the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(-3)(1) + (-3)(-2i) + (4i)(1) + (4i)(-2i)\n\\]\n\\[\n= -3 + 6i + 4i - 8i^2\n\\]\n\nI remember that \\(i^2 = -1\\), so:\n\n\\[\n-3 + 10i - 8(-1)\n\\]\n\\[\n= -3 + 10i + 8\n\\]\n\\[\n= 5 + 10i\n\\]\n\nNow, the denominator:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - 4i^2 = 1 - 4(-1) = 1 + 4 = 5\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 + 10i}{5} = 1 + 2i\n\\]\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. If William forgot the negative sign, he got \\(\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\), but the correct answer seems to be \\(1 + 2i\\). Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting over,"

Let me express the numerator in terms of the denominator times something.\n\nLet me write -3 +4i as (1 +2i) multiplied by something plus a remainder.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n-3 +4i = (1 +2i)(x + yi) + (a + ib)\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to compute it as:\n\nDivide -3 +4i by 1 +2i.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLet me denote z = -3 +4i, w =1 +2i.\n\nWe can write z = w * q + r, where q is the quotient and r is the remainder. Since w is a complex number, q and r are complex numbers too. However, to find q, we need to solve w * q ≈ z, ignoring the remainder.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a method to compute the division, but perhaps another approach is to solve for q in:\n\n-3 +4i = q*(1 +2i)\n\nAssume q = a + bi.\n\nThen:\n\n(a + bi)(1 + 2i) = a + ai + bi + 2bi^2\n\n= a + (a + 2b)i - 2b\n\n= (a - 2b) + (a + 2b)i\n\nSet equal to -3 +4i:\n\nSo,\n\na -2b = -3  --- (1)\n\na +2b =4     --- (2)\n\nAdd equations (1) and (2):\n\n2a = 1 => a=1/2\n\nThen from equation (1): 1/2 -2b = -3\n\n-2b = -3 -1/2 = -7/2 => b=7/4\n\nThus, q = (1/2"

Let me check again:\n\nThe equations from equating real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: (a -2b) = -3\n\nImaginary part: (a +2b) =4 \n\nSo adding them:\n\n(a -2b) + (a +2b) = -3 +4 ⇒ 2a =1 ⇒ a = 0.5\n\nThen substitute back into equation (2):\n\n0.5 + 2b =4 ⇒ 2b = 3.5 ⇒ b = 1.75 or 7/4\n\nThus, q = 0.5 + (7/4)i\n\nBut that gives q = 0.5 + 1.75i which would mean:\n\nZ = q * w = (0.5 + 1.75i)(1 +2i) = 0.5*1 +0.5*2i +1.75i*1 +1.75i*2i\n\n=0.5 +i +1.75i +3.5i²\n\n=0.5 +2.75i +3.5(-1)\n\n= 0.5 -3.5 +2.75i\n\n= -3 +2.75i\n\nHmm, but the original z is -3 +4i. So that's not right. So there's an error in this method? Wait, why?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps my mistake is that the initial assumption was to set z = q*w, which would require that the remainder is zero. But in reality, z divided by w is a complex number, so the quotient is an exact division (since complex numbers form a field). So this suggests that perhaps this approach isn't correct, because in my previous steps when I multiplied back, it didn't match. Wait, but according to previous methods, the quotient is 1+2i, which when multiplied by (1+2i):\n\n(1+2i)(1+2i) =1 +4i +4i²=1 +4i -4 = -3 +4i, which is z! So that's correct.\n\nWait, so the quotient"

So, that would mean:\n\n(1 +2i)*(1 +2i) =1 +4i +4i²=1 +4i -4 =-3 +4i.\n\nAh, that makes sense now. So, the division is \\(\\frac{-3 +4i}{1 +2i} = \\frac{(1 +2i)(1 +2i)}{1 +2i} =1 +2i\\). So that's why the correct answer is 1 +2i.\n\nTherefore, William should have gotten 1 +2i, but instead, he missed the negative sign and got \\(\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't seem consistent because if he forgot the negative sign, he did \\(\\frac{3 +4i}{1 +2i}\\), which we saw gives \\(\\frac{11}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i\\), but the correct computation gives 1 +2i.\n\nWait, wait a minute.

Let me verify once again.\n\nYes, as shown earlier, both through the conjugate method and through algebraic expansion, the result is 1 +2i.
