            "output": "To determine the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table with all members of each party seated together, I'll start by considering the circular nature of the arrangement. In circular permutations, the number of arrangements is typically (n-1)! because rotations are considered equivalent.\n\nGiven that all Democrats, Republicans, and Independent must sit together, I can treat each party as a single unit. This means I have three units to arrange: the Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent.\n\nSince it's a circular table, the number of ways to arrange these three units is (3-1)! = 2! = 2.\n\nNext, within each party, the members can be arranged among themselves. The Democrats have 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways, and the Independent has only 1 member, so there's only 1 way to arrange them.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of seating arrangements, I'll multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the members within each unit. That gives 2 (for the party units) multiplied by 5! (Democrats) multiplied by 5! (Republicans) multiplied by 1 (Independent).\n\nSo, the total number of ways is 2 × 5! × 5! × 1 = 2 × 120 × 120 × 1 = 28,800.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll break it down into two main steps:\n\n1. **Arrange the Party Units Around the Table.**\n2. **Arrange the Members Within Each Party Unit.**\n\n**Step 1: Arrange the Party Units Around the Table**\n\nSince the table is circular, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered identical. We have three distinct party units: Democrats (5 members), Republicans (5 members), and the Independent (1 member). The number of ways to arrange these units around a circular table is \\((3-1)! = 2!\\).\n\n**Step 2: Arrange the Members Within Each Party Unit**\n\n- **Democrats:** There are 5 Democrats, and they can be arranged in \\(5!\\) ways.\n- **Republicans:** There are 5 Republicans, and they can be arranged in \\(5!\\) ways.\n- **Independent:** There's only 1 Independent, so there's only \\(1\\) way to arrange them.\n\n"
