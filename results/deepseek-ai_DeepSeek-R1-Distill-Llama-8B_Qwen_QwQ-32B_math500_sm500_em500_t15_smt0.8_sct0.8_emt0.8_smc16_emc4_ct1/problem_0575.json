This simplifies the problem to a linear arrangement of the remaining members.\n\nNext, I'll consider the three distinct groups: Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent. Each group must sit together, which means I'll treat each group as a single unit or \"block.\"\n\nThere are 3 blocks in total, so I'll line them up in a circular manner. However, because one position has been fixed, I'll treat this as a linear arrangement for counting purposes.\n\nWithin each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways, and the Independent has only 1 way to arrange.\n\nFinally, I'll account for the different ways the blocks can be arranged relative to each other. Since the blocks are considered different (Democrats vs. Republicans vs. Independent), there are 3! ways to arrange them around the table.\n\nMultiplying all these possibilities together will give the total number of distinct seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of seating the Senate committee around a circular table with each party's members sitting together, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix a Position to Eliminate Rotations:**\n   Since the table is circular, rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new seating. To account for this, fix the position of one person. For simplicity, fix the Independent in a specific seat.\n\n2. **Treat Each Party as a Single Unit:**\n   Now, consider the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent as three distinct \"blocks.\" Each block must remain intact and seated together around the table.\n\n3. **Arrange the Blocks:**\n   There are 3 blocks, so they can be arranged in \\(3!\\) ways around the table. However, since we've already fixed the Independent's position, we only need to consider the relative ordering of the Democrat and Republican blocks.\n\n4. **Arrange Members Within Each Block:**\n   - **Democrats:** There are 5 Democrats, so they can be arranged among themselves in \\(5!\\) ways.\n   - **Republicans:** Similarly, the 5 Republicans can be arranged in \\(5!\\) ways"

    "question": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)"
