Brazil and France each cost $6$ cents per stamp, Peru is $4$ cents, and Spain is $5$ cents.\n\nNext, I'll determine the number of stamps for each country in the 70s. From the chart, Brazil has 12 stamps, France has 12 stamps, Peru has 12 stamps, and Spain has 13 stamps.\n\nThen, I'll calculate the total cost for each country by multiplying the number of stamps by their respective prices.\n\nAfter that, I'll sum up the total costs for all four countries to get the overall total cost for the 70s stamps.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the total cost by the total number of 70s stamps to find the average price, rounding the result to the nearest tenth of a cent.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo find the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices for 70s Stamps:**\n   - **Brazil and France:** \\$6 **each**\n   - **Peru:** \\$4 **each**\n   - **Spain:** \\$5 **each**\n\n2. **Determine the Number of 70s Stamps for Each Country:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 stamps\n   - **France:** 12 stamps\n   - **Peru:** 12 stamps\n   - **Spain:** 13 stamps\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost for Each Country:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 stamps \u00d7 \\$6 = \\$72\n   - **France:** 12 stamps \u00d7 \\$6 = \\$72\n   - **Peru:** 12 stamps \u00d7 \\$4 = \\$48\n   - **Spain:** 13 stamps \u00d7 \\$5 = \\$65\n\n4. **Sum the Total Costs:**\n   - Total = \\$72 (Brazil) + \\$72 (France) + \\$48 (Peru) + \\$65 (Spain) = \\$257\n\n5. **Find the Total Number of 70s Stamps:**\n   - Total = 12 (Brazil) + 12 (France) + 12 (Peru) + 13 (Spain) = 49 stamps\n\n6. **Calculate the Average Price:**\n   - Average Price = Total Cost \u00f7 Total Number of Stamps = \\$257 \u00f7 49 \u2248 \\$5"

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
