Looking at the chart, Spain has a price of $6$ cents, and Peru has a price of $12$ cents.\n\nNext, I count how many stamps Juan has from each decade. In the 70s section, there are $6$ stamps from Spain and $12$ stamps from Peru.\n\nI calculate the total price for each country in the 70s by multiplying the number of stamps by their respective prices. For Spain, $6 \\times 6 = 36$ cents. For Peru, $12 \\times 12 = 144$ cents.\n\nThen, I add the total prices together to find the overall total for the 70s: $36 + 144 = 180$ cents.\n\nFinally, I find the average price by dividing the total price by the number of stamps from the 70s: $\\frac{180}{18} = 10.0$ cents.\n\nThe average price of Juan's 70s stamps is $10.0$ cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70's** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices:**\n   - **Spain:** \\$6 **cents** per stamp.\n   - **Peru:** \\$12 **cents** per stamp.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Stamps:**\n   - **Spain:** 6 stamps.\n   - **Peru:** 12 stamps.\n   - **Total 70's stamps:** \\(6 + 12 = 18\\) stamps.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost for Each Country:**\n   - **Spain:** \\(6 \\text{ stamps} \\times \\$6/\\text{stamp} = \\$36\\).\n   - **Peru:** \\(12 \\text{ stamps} \\times \\$12/\\text{stamp} = \\$144\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Overall Total Cost for the 70's Stamps:**\n   - **Total cost:** \\(\\$36 + \\$144 = \\$180\\).\n\n5. **Compute the Average Price:**\n   - **Average price:** \\(\\frac{\\$180}{18 \\text{ stamps}} = \\$10.0\\) **cents**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{10.0}\\)"
