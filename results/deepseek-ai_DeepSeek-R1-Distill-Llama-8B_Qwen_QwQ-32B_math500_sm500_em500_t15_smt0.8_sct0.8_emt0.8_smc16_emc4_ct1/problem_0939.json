            "output": "First, I need to understand what a factorial is. The factorial of a number \\( n \\) is the product of all positive integers from 1 up to \\( n \\).\n\nNext, to determine the number of trailing zeros in \\( 42! \\), I should count how many times the number 10 is a factor in the product. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I need to find how many pairs of 2s and 5s are in the prime factorization of \\( 42! \\).\n\nI know that in factorials, there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros.\n\nNow, I'll count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\( 42! \\). I do this by dividing 42 by 5 and taking the floor of the result, then dividing by 25 and taking the floor again, and so on until the division yields zero.\n\nCalculating this, \\( 42 \\div 5 = 8.4 \\), so there are 8 fives. Then, \\( 42 \\div 25 = 1.68 \\), so there's an additional 1 five. Adding these together, there are a total of 9 fives in the prime factors of \\( 42! \\).\n\nSince the number of 5s is higher than the number of 2s, the number of trailing zeros in \\( 42! \\) is determined by the number of 5s, which is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\( 42! \\), we need to count how many times the number 10 is a factor in the product. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), we look for pairs of the prime factors 2 and 5 in the factorial.\n\nThere are typically more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, so the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 appears in the prime factors.\n\nHere's how to calculate it:\n\n1. **Count the number of 5s in the prime factors:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\quad \\text{(from multiples of 5)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right"
