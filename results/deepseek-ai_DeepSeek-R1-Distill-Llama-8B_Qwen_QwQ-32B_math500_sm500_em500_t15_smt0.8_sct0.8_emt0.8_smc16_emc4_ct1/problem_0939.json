Trailing zeros result from factors of 10 in the number, and since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, each pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factors contributes to a trailing zero.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. This can be done by dividing 42 by 5 and taking the floor of the result.\n\n\\( \\frac{42}{5} = 8.4 \\), so there are 8 multiples of 5 in this range.\n\nNext, I'll consider higher powers of 5, such as 25, because these contribute more than one 5 to the prime factorization. Dividing 42 by 25 gives:\n\n\\( \\frac{42}{25} = 1.68 \\), so there is 1 multiple of 25.\n\nAdding these together, there are \\(8 + 1 = 9\\) factors of 5 in \\(42!\\).\n\nNow, I'll determine the number of factors of 2 in \\(42!\\). Since there are more multiples of 2 than 5 in the range, I can use a similar approach by dividing 42 by 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32, and summing the results:\n\n\\( \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{42}{4} = 10.5 \\) \u2192 10 (since we take the floor)\n\n\\( \\frac{42}{8} = 5.25 \\) \u2192 5\n\n\\( \\frac{42}{16} = 2.625 \\) \u2192 2\n\n\\( \\frac{42}{32} = 1.3125 \\) \u2192 1\n\nAdding these together gives \\(21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39\\) factors of 2.\n\nFinally, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the minimum of the number of 5s and 2s. Since there are 9 fives and 39 twos, the limiting factor is 9.\n\nTherefore, \\(42!\\) has 9 trailing zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to calculate how many times the number 10 is a factor in \\(42"
