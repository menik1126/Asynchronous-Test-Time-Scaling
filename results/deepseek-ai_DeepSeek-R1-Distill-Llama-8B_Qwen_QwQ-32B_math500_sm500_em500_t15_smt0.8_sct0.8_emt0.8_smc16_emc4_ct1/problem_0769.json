The answer needs to be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers with \\( a \\) square-free, and then find \\( a + b \\). \n\nHmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. I need to find the point on the graph of this function that's closest to the origin (0,0). The distance from the origin to any point (x, y) can be calculated using the distance formula: \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). So, if I can express the distance in terms of \\( x \\) alone, I can then find the minimum distance by minimizing the squared distance to avoid dealing with the square root, which might complicate things.\n\nThe given function is \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). Let me substitute this into the distance formula. So, substituting \\( y \\) gives me:\n\nDistance squared \\( D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\).\n\nI think minimizing \\( D^2 \\) will give me the same point as minimizing \\( D \\), so that's where I'll start. Let me write that out:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\).\n\nSimplifying that, I can square the term:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\right) \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 \\):\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \\).\n\nSo substituting that back in:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\frac{x^4 - 6x^2 + 9}{2} \\).\n\nTo simplify this, I can write everything over a common denominator:\n\n\\( D^2"

To do this, I can take the derivative of \\( D^2 \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and set it equal to zero.\n\nLet's compute the derivative:\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{dx}(D^2) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}{2} \\right) \\).\n\nSince the derivative of a constant is zero, this simplifies to:\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{dx}(D^2) = \\frac{4x^3 - 8x}{2} = 2x^3 - 4x \\).\n\nSet this derivative equal to zero for critical points:\n\n\\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \\).\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n\\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \\).\n\nSo the critical points are when \\( 2x = 0 \\) or \\( x^2 - 2 = 0 \\). That gives \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nNow, I should evaluate \\( D^2 \\) at each critical point to determine which gives the minimum distance.\n\nFirst, \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( D^2 = \\frac{0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9}{2} = \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\).\n\nNext, \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\):\n\nCompute \\( x^4 = (\\sqrt{2})^4 = (2)^{2} = 4 \\).\nCompute \\( x^2 = (\\sqrt{2})"

So, the minimum squared distance is 2.5, which occurs at \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is the square root of 2.5, which is \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\). Because 2.5 is equal to \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\).\n\nThe problem says that this distance can be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\) where \\( a \\) is square-free. Let me rewrite \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\) as \\( \\sqrt{5}/\\sqrt{2} \\). However, rationalizing the denominator, \\( \\sqrt{5}/\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{10}/2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\). Since 10 is 2\u00d75, and neither 2 nor 5 is a square, it's square-free.\n\nTherefore, \\( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \\).\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check. When I took \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\), is this equal to \\( \\sqrt{10}/2 \\)?\n\nWait, no, actually, \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\) is equal to \\( \\sqrt{5}/\\sqrt{2} \\), which can be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{10}/2 \\). Because multiplying numerator and denominator by \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), \\( \\sqrt{5}/\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{2})"

So, 10 is square-free. And \\( b = 2 \\).\n\nWait a second, let me confirm the value at \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\). Plugging back into the original equation:\n\n\\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}( (\\sqrt{2})^2 - 3 ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nSo, the point is \\( (\\sqrt{2}, -1/\\sqrt{2}) \\).

So the minimal distance is \\( \\sqrt{10}/2 \\), so \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\), so \\( a + b = 12 \\).\n\nAlternatively, just to double-check, perhaps I can consider another method like using the derivative or maybe using geometry.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the distance squared function:\n\n\\( f(x) = x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\).\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n\\( f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\).\n\nWhich is the same as I had before, so taking the derivative, set to zero, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider this function as the sum of two squared terms, but I don't see a simpler method for this.\n\nWait, another thought: since the function is a quadratic in \\( x^2 \\), perhaps I can write it as \\( f(u) = u + \\frac{(u - "

So the minimum occurs at \\( u = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, substituting back, \\( x^2 = 2 \\implies x = \\sqrt{2} \\) or \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\), which matches the previous result.\n\nThen, plugging \\( u = 2 \\) into \\( f(u) \\):\n\n\\( f(2) = \\frac{2^2}{2} - 2(2) + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} - 4 + \\frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + 4.5 = 2.5 \\), which is 5/2. So the squared distance is 5/2, so the distance is sqrt(5/2) as before. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2) which is sqrt(1"

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):\n\nsqrt(5)*sqrt(2) / 2 = sqrt(10)/2. So, yes, same result.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another thing.

So, the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2) or sqrt(10)/2.\n\nI think that's correct.
