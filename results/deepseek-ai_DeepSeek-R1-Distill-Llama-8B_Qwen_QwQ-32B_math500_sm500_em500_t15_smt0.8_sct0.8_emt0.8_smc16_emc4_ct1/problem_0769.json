            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y equals (1 over square root of 2) times (x squared minus 3). The answer is supposed to be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a shouldn't be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then I have to find a plus b. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance between two points in a plane is calculated using the distance formula. If there's a point (x, y), the distance from the origin (0,0) to that point is sqrt(x² + y²). So, I need to express the distance from the origin to a point on the graph of this function and then find its minimum value.\n\nGiven the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). So, I can substitute this into the distance formula. That would make the distance D equal to sqrt(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nD = sqrt(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²)\n\nFirst, let me square both sides to make it easier to work with, since the square root can complicate differentiation later. So, D squared is equal to x² plus [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]².\n\nLet me compute [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]². That would be (1/2)(x² - 3)². So, D squared is x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nNow, let me expand that (x² - 3)² term. That would be x⁴ - 6x² + 9. So, plugging that back in, D squared is x² + (1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9). Let me distribute the (1/2):\n\nD squared = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + (9/2)\n\nCombine like terms. The x² terms: 1x² - 3x² is -2x². So:\n\nD squared = (1/"

To find the minimum distance, I can find the minimum of D squared, which will occur at the same x where D is minimized.\n\nSo, to find the minimum of this function, I can take its derivative with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2.\n\nCompute f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [(1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2] = (1/2)*4x³ - 4x + 0 = 2x³ - 4x\n\nSet f'(x) = 0:\n\n2x³ - 4x = 0\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n2x(x² - 2) = 0\n\nSo, 2x = 0 gives x=0. The other solutions come from x² - 2 = 0, which is x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the critical points are at x = 0, x = sqrt(2), and x = -sqrt(2).\n\nNow, I need to evaluate f(x) at these critical points to find which one gives the minimal D squared.\n\nLet's compute f(0):\n\nf(0) = (1/2)(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2.\n\nNow, f(sqrt(2)):\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/2)(sqrt(2))^4 = (1/2)(4) because (sqrt(2))^4 is (2)^2 = 4.\n\n-2*(sqrt(2))^2 = -2*(2) = -4.\n\n+9/2 remains.\n\nSo, f(sqrt(2)) = (1/2)(4) - 4 + 9/2 = 2 - 4 + 4.5 = (2 - 4) is -2, plus 4.5 is 2.5, which is 5/2.\n\nSimilarly, f(-sqrt(2)) will be the same because all terms are even powers of x"

            "output": ", so the function is even, so f(-sqrt(2)) is also 5/2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of D squared is 5/2, which occurs at x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the minimal distance D is sqrt(5/2). But the problem says it can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. So, sqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(10)/2. Let me check:\n\nsqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/(sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nYes, so sqrt(10)/2 is the expression. So, a is 10 and b is 2.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that 10 is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. 10 factors into 2*5, neither of which is a square, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, a is 10 and b is 2, so a + b is 12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me start from the function again. The minimal distance squared at x = sqrt(2) is 5/2, so the distance is sqrt(5/2). So, sqrt(5/2) can be rationalized as sqrt(10)/2. Okay, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me confirm whether 5/2 is indeed the minimal value. Because maybe I should check the second derivative to ensure it's a minimum.\n\nCompute f''(x):\n\nf'(x) = 2x³ - 4x\n\nf''(x) = 6x² - 4\n\nAt x = sqrt(2), f''(sqrt(2)) = 6*(2) -4 = 12 -4 = 8, which is positive. So, that point is indeed a local minimum.\n\nAt x=0, f''(0) = 0 -4 = -4, which is negative, so that's a local maximum.\n\nTherefore, the minimal occurs at x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2), which gives D squared as 5/2, so D is sqrt("

Maybe I should try plugging in x = sqrt(2) into the original function to check the y-value.\n\nSo, y = (1/sqrt(2))*( (sqrt(2))^2 - 3 ) = (1/sqrt(2))*(2 - 3) = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = -1/sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the point is (sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)). Calculating distance from origin:\n\nsqrt( (sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/sqrt(2))^2 ) = sqrt( 2 + 1/2 ) = sqrt(5/2), same as before.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, another way to express that is sqrt(10)/2, so 10 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of parametrizing the distance squared as a function of x, but I think the method I took is solid.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 12.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\) is found by minimizing the distance function.
