            "output": "I need to simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\) step by step. First, I'll multiply the numerators together. Multiplying 10 by 4 gives 40, and multiplying \\(r^3\\) by \\(r^6\\) results in \\(r^{9}\\). So, the numerator simplifies to \\(40r^{9}\\).\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides of the fraction by \\(8r^4\\). Dividing 40 by 8 gives 5, and dividing \\(r^{9}\\) by \\(r^{4}\\) subtracts 4 from the exponent, leaving \\(r^{5}\\). Therefore, the simplified expression is \\(5r^{5}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators:**\n   \n   \\[\n   10 \\times 4 = 40\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   r^3 \\times r^6 = r^{3+6} = r^{9}\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the numerator becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   40r^{9}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by the denominator:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{40r^{9}}{8r^{4}}\n   \\]\n   \n   - Divide the coefficients:\n   \n     \\[\n     \\frac{40}{8} = 5\n     \\]\n   \n   - Subtract the exponents of \\(r\\) since \\(r^a / r^b = r^{a-b}\\):\n   \n     \\[\n     r^{9-4} = r^{5}\n     \\]\n   \n   Therefore:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{40r^{9}}{8r^{4}} = 5r^{5}\n   \\]\n\n**Final simplified expression:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5r^{5}}\n\\]"
