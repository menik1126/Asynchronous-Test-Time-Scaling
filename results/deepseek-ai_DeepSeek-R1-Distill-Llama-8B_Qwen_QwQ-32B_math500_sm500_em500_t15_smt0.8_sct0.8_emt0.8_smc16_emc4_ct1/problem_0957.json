Multiplying 10 by 4 gives 40, and multiplying r^3 by r^6 results in r^(3+6) which is r^9.\n\nThen, I'll handle the division by 8r^4. Dividing 40 by 8 simplifies to 5, and dividing r^9 by r^4 gives r^(9-4) which is r^5.\n\nCombining these results, the simplified expression is 5r^5.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\( \\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators and denominators separately:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(10 \\times 4) \\times (r^3 \\times r^6)}{8 \\times r^4} = \\frac{40 \\times r^9}{8 \\times r^4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the numerical coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{8} = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the variable terms by subtracting exponents:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{r^9}{r^4} = r^{9-4} = r^5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the simplified numerical and variable parts:**\n   \\[\n   5r^5\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5r^5}\n\\]"
