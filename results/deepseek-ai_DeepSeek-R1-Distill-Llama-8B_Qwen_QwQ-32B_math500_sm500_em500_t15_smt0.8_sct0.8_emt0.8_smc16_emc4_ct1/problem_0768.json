Then, express that distance as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Finally, I have to find \\( a + b \\). Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst off, the distance between two points \\( (x, y) \\) and the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) can be found using the distance formula. I remember that the distance \\( D \\) is given by \\( D = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} \\), which simplifies to \\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nSince I'm looking for the smallest distance, I guess I need to minimize this distance function. But minimizing the square root can sometimes be tricky, so maybe it's easier to minimize the square of the distance instead. That way, I can work with \\( D^2 \\) instead of \\( D \\), which should make the differentiation simpler. So, let me define a function \\( f(x) = x^2 + y^2 \\), where \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). Substituting that into \\( f(x) \\), I get:\n\n\\( f(x) = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\)\n\nLet me simplify that expression. First, square the second term:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\times (x^2 - 3)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (x^2 - 3)^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( f(x) \\) becomes:\n\n\\( f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\)\n\nNow, to find the minimum distance"

Because sometimes when minimizing, especially with calculus, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Instead of using calculus, I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using geometry: the graph is a parabola. The distance from the origin to a point on the parabola y = (1/√2)(x² -3). So, parametrizing the point on parabola as (x, y), and the distance squared is x² + y².

So, the calculus approach seems valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check if the minimal distance is indeed at x = sqrt(2). Let me plug in another value, say x =1.\n\nAt x =1, y = (1 -3)/sqrt(2) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2). Then distance squared is 1 + ( (-sqrt(2))² ) = 1 + 2 = 3, so distance sqrt(3) ≈1.732, which is more than sqrt(5/2)≈1.581. So that's higher. So, yes, the minimal is indeed at sqrt(2).\n\nAlternatively, x = sqrt(2):\n\nCompute y-coordinate:\n\ny = ( (sqrt(2))² -3 ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -3)/sqrt(2) = (-1)/sqrt(2) ≈ -0.707.\n\nSo, the point is (sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)). The distance squared is (sqrt(2))² + (-1/sqrt(2))² = 2 + (1/2) = 2.5, which is 5/2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. So, a is 10, b is 2, so a + b is 12. Hmm, but let me check the problem statement again to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of y = ...\". So, the graph is a parabola opening upwards, since the coefficient of x² is positive (1/sqrt(2) is positive). The vertex of the parabola is at (0, -3/sqrt(2)), which is below the origin. So, the closest point might be somewhere on the parabola. But according to the calculations, the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2, which is approximately 1.58. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the distance squared function as f(x) = x² + y², which is x² + ( (x² -3)/sqrt"

Let me see if there's a way without calculus...\n\nAlternatively, using completing the square or something, but I think calculus is the straightforward method here.\n\nWait, is there a way to express y in terms of x, so that I can have the equation of the parabola and then find the minimal distance from the origin to this parabola? Yes, but it's the same as using the distance formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of it as finding the point on the parabola closest to the origin. In geometry, the closest distance from a point to a curve is along the line perpendicular to the tangent at that point. So, the gradient of the distance function should be parallel to the gradient of the curve. Which is essentially the same as using calculus of multiple variables, i.e., Lagrange multipliers.\n\nSo, setting up Lagrange multipliers: We want to minimize f(x, y) = x² + y² subject to the constraint g(x, y) = y - (1/√2)(x² -3) = 0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = x² + y² - λ(y - (1/√2)(x² -3)).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n∂L/∂x = 2x - λ*(-2/√2)x = 0\n\n∂L/∂y = 2y - λ = 0\n\n∂L/∂λ = -(y - (1/√2)(x² -3)) = 0\n\nSo, from ∂L/∂y: 2y - λ = 0 => λ = 2y\n\nFrom ∂L/∂x: 2x + (2λ /√2) x = 0\n\nWait, no, ∂L/∂x = 2x + (2/√2)x λ = 0\n\nSimplify 2/√2: that's √2. So,\n\n2x + √2 x λ = 0\n\nBut λ = 2y, so plug that in:\n\n2x + √2 x (2y) = 0\n\nSo, 2x + 2√2 x y = 0\n\nWe can factor 2x:\n\n2x(1 + √2 y) = 0\n\nSo, either x = 0 or 1 + √2"

The distance squared is 0 + (9/2) = 9/2, so distance 3/√2, which is the same as before.\n\nCase 2: 1 + √2 y = 0 => y = -1/√2\n\nThen, from the constraint equation: y = (1/√2)(x² -3)\n\nSet equal to -1/√2:\n\n(1/√2)(x² -3) = -1/√2\n\nMultiply both sides by √2:\n\nx² - 3 = -1\n\nThus, x² = 2 => x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the points are (sqrt(2), -1/√2) and (-sqrt(2), -1/√2).
