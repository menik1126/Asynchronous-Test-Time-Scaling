The answer should be expressed in the form \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I need to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. We need the shortest distance from the origin (0,0) to some point (x, y) on the curve defined by the equation above. Hmm, so this is essentially a problem of minimizing the distance function from the origin to the curve.\n\nI remember that the distance between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by the formula \\( \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\). Since one of the points is the origin (0,0), the distance simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nSo, for our problem, the distance \\( D \\) from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) on the graph is \\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). But since \\( y \\) is given in terms of \\( x \\), we can substitute that into the distance formula.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying that, the square of the distance would be:\n\n\\[\nD^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating the second term, squaring \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) gives \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), so:\n\n\\[\nD^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding \\("

Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should visualize this function or consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, another method to find the minimal distance from a point to a curve is to use the formula for the distance from a point to a curve, which involves taking the gradient and setting it proportional to the gradient of the curve.\n\nBut in this case, since we've already done the calculus approach and it seems consistent, I think it's okay.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is using parametric equations or using the method of Lagrange"
