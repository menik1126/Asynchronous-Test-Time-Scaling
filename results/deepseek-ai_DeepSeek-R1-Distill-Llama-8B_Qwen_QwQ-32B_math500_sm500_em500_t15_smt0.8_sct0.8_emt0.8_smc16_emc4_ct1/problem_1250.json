            "output": "To convert 999 from base 10 to base 6, I'll start by determining the largest power of 6 that fits into 999. The powers of 6 are 1, 6, 36, 216, and 1296. The largest power less than 999 is 216, which is 6 to the power of 3.\n\nNext, I'll divide 999 by 216 to find out how many 216s are in 999. Dividing 999 by 216 gives approximately 4.6296. Since we can't have a fraction of a digit, I'll take the integer part, which is 4.\n\nThen, I'll subtract 4 times 216 from 999 to find the remainder. 4 multiplied by 216 is 864. Subtracting 864 from 999 leaves a remainder of 135.\n\nNow, I'll repeat the process with the smaller remainder. I'll divide 135 by 36, which is the next lower power of 6. Dividing 135 by 36 gives approximately 3.75. Taking the integer part, that's 3.\n\nI'll then subtract 3 times 36 from 135, which is 108. Subtracting 108 from 135 leaves a remainder of 27.\n\nContinuing, I'll divide 27 by 6. Dividing 27 by 6 gives exactly 4.5. I'll take the integer part, which is 4.\n\nFinally, I'll subtract 4 times 6 from 27. 4 multiplied by 6 is 24, and subtracting that from 27 leaves a remainder of 3.\n\nWith all the remainders determined, I'll arrange them in the order of the highest power to the lowest. That gives me the base 6 equivalent as 4 3 4 3.\n\nSo, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 4343.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\) to its base six equivalent, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the place values in base six:**\n   \n   Base six uses powers of six. The place values are:\n   \\[\n   6^0 = 1,\\quad 6^1 = 6,\\quad 6^2 = 36,\\quad 6^3 = 216,\\quad 6^4 = 1296,\\quad \\"
