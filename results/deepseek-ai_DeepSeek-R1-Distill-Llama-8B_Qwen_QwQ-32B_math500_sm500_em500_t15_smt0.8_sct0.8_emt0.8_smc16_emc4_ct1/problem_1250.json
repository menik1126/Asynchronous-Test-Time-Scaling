            "output": "To convert 999 from base 10 to base 6, I first need to determine how many 6² (36) fit into 999. \n\nDividing 999 by 36 gives me 27 with a remainder of 27. This means there are 27 sixes in the third place.\n\nNext, I divide 27 by 6 to find the number of sixes in the second place, which is 4 with a remainder of 3.\n\nFinally, I take the remainder of 3 and place it in the first place. Combining these, the base 6 equivalent of 999 in base 10 is 2343_6.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Place Values in Base Six:**\n   - Each digit in base six represents powers of six.\n   - The rightmost digit is \\( 6^0 = 1 \\).\n   - The middle digit is \\( 6^1 = 6 \\).\n   - The leftmost digit is \\( 6^2 = 36 \\).\n\n2. **Determine How Many Sixes Fit into 999:**\n   - Divide 999 by 36 to find how many sixes fit into the leftmost place.\n     \\[\n     999 \\div 36 = 27 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 999 - (27 \\times 36) = 27\n     \\]\n   - So, there are **27** sixes in the \\( 6^2 \\) place.\n\n3. **Find the Next Place Value:**\n   - Divide the quotient by 6 to find the number for the \\( 6^1 \\) place.\n     \\[\n     27 \\div 6 = 4 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 27 - (4 \\times 6) = 3\n     \\]\n   - So, there are **4** sixes in the \\( 6^1 \\) place.\n\n4. **Handle the Remainder:**\n   - The final remainder is 3, which goes into the \\( 6^0 \\) place.\n\n5. **Combine the Digits:**\n   - Starting from the highest power, assemble the digits: 27, 4, and 3.\n   - Therefore, \\( 999_{10} ="
