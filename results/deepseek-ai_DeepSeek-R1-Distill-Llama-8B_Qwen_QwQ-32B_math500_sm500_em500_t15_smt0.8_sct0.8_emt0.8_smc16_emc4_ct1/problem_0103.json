            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here that I need to solve. It says to find the product CD of the integers C and D for which the equation \n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nholds true for all real values of x except -8 and 3. Hmm, that looks like a rational equation. I remember that when you have an equation like this, one way to solve it is by combining the fractions on the left side so that you can compare them to the fraction on the right side. That should help us figure out what C and D are.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the denominators on the left side can be combined. The denominators are (x - 3) and (x + 8), so the common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). That makes sense because (x - 3) and (x + 8) are both linear terms. So, to add the two fractions, I should multiply each term by the common denominator.\n\nLet me write that down step by step.\n\nStarting with the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8}\n\\]\n\nI can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\nC*(x + 8)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)] + D*(x - 3)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nAdding these together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSo now, the left side is a single fraction with the denominator (x - 3)(x + 8), and the numerator is C(x + 8) + D(x - 3).\n\nThe right side is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nI notice that the denominator here is a quadratic. Maybe I can factor it to see if it relates to the denominator on the left side.\n\nLet me try factoring x² + 5x - 24. I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 5. Let"

            "output": "'s see: 8 and -3. Because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So that factors to:\n\n(x + 8)(x - 3)\n\nOh, that's the same as the denominator on the left side! Great, so both sides have the same denominator, which means their numerators must be equal for the equation to hold for all x (except where it's undefined, which is already given as x ≠ -8, 3).\n\nSo, setting the numerators equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, I need to find the values of C and D that make this equation true for all x. Since this is an identity, it must hold for any x (except -8 and 3), so the coefficients of corresponding powers of x on both sides must be equal.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nSo the left side is (C + D)x + (8C - 3D), and the right side is 4x - 23.\n\nNow, set the coefficients equal:\n\nFor the x terms:\n\nC + D = 4\n\nFor the constant terms:\n\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nSo now I have a system of two equations:\n\n1. C + D = 4\n2. 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve this system for C and D.\n\nLet me use the elimination method. First, from the first equation, I can express C in terms of D:\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nThen substitute this into the second equation:\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo D is 5. Then, from the first equation, C = 4 - D = 4"
