            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. I remember that when you have fractions like this, you can combine them by finding a common denominator. The common denominator for these two fractions would be the product of (x - 3) and (x + 8), right? So, I should rewrite the left side with this common denominator.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait a second, the denominator on the right side is a quadratic. Let me factor that to see if it matches the common denominator I found. \n\nThe quadratic is x² + 5x - 24. To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3: 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, it factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). Perfect! That matches the common denominator. So, I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal for all real x except x = 3 and x = -8. So, I can set the numerators equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, let me expand the left side:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nI can combine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\n"

            "output": "So, this equation has to hold for all x except x = 3 and x = -8. That means the coefficients of the corresponding powers of x must be equal on both sides. So, I can set up a system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables. I need to solve for C and D.\n\nFrom the first equation, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for C:\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet me compute 8*(4 - D):\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo, D is 5. Now, plug this back into C = 4 - D:\n\nC = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nTherefore, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nThe question asks for the product CD. So:\n\nCD = (-1) * 5 = -5\n\nWait, is that all? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the initial equation, I combined the fractions correctly. Then, I factored the denominator on the right correctly. Then, I set the numerators equal and expanded everything. The coefficients led me to a system of equations, which I solved, resulting in C = -1 and D = 5.\n\nJust to double-check, let me plug these values back into the left side and see if it equals the right side.\n\nCompute numerator with C = -1, D = 5:\n\n-1(x + 8) + 5(x - 3) = -x -8 + 5x -15 = 4x -23\n\nWhich matches the right side numerator. So, my answer seems correct.\n\nSo, the product CD is -1 * 5 = -5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for integers \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) such that:\n\n\\"
