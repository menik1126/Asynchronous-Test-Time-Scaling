            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step. First, I should probably write down the equation to visualize it better.\n\nThe equation is:\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, so I have a square root on one side and x on the other. Since there's a square root, I might need to square both sides at some point to eliminate it. But before that, let me make sure I isolate the square root term properly.\n\nLet me subtract 4 from both sides to get the square root by itself. That would give me:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nOkay, so now the square root is isolated. The next step is to square both sides to get rid of the square root. Squaring both sides means I'll have to deal with (x - 4) squared on the left side.\n\nSo, squaring both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nAlright, so now I have a quadratic equation. Let's bring all the terms to one side to set the equation to zero.\n\nSubtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\nx² - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nHmm, this quadratic equation is x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. Let me try to factor this. I need two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, if both are negative, their product is positive, and their sum is -6. So, yes, that works.\n\nThus, factoring the quadratic:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 1 = 0  =>  x = 1\nx - 5 = 0  =>  x = 5\n\nSo, potential solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. But wait, I have to"

            "output": " check these solutions in the original equation because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions that don't actually satisfy the original equation, especially when there's a square root involved.\n\nLet me check x = 1 first.\n\nOriginal equation:\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nPlugging in x = 1:\n\n1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4\n1 = √(11 - 2) + 4\n1 = √9 + 4\n1 = 3 + 4\n1 = 7\n\nHmm, that's not true. 1 does not equal 7. So, x = 1 is an extraneous solution. I must have made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. Oh, I see where I might have messed up earlier. So, when I squared both sides, I have to ensure that the left side is non-negative because the square root function only outputs non-negative numbers.\n\nWait, let me go back to when I had x - 4 = √(11 - 2x). Since the square root is always non-negative, the right side is at least zero, so the left side, x - 4, must also be equal to that non-negative number. So, x - 4 >= 0. Which means x >= 4.\n\nSo, x must be greater than or equal to 4 for a valid solution. That means x = 1, which is less than 4, isn't a valid solution. So, that checks out why it didn't work.\n\nNow, let's check x = 5.\n\nPlugging x = 5 into the original equation:\n\n5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4\n5 = √(11 - 10) + 4\n5 = √1 + 4\n5 = 1 + 4\n5 = 5\n\nOkay, that works. So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nHmm, so why did x = 1 come up as a solution? Because when we square both sides, we create a scenario where negative solutions can appear, but in this case, since the square root is only defined for non-negative numbers and the left side x - 4 must also be non-negative, we can discard x = 1.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss anything"

Since the square root is non-negative, x - 4 must be >= 0, so x >=4. So any solution must be at least 4. So x=1 is invalid, so only x=5 is left.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nWait, but let me also check the domain of the original equation. The expression under the square root must be non-negative as well. So 11 - 2x >=0.\n\nSo 11 - 2x >=0 => 2x <=11 => x <= 5.5.\n\nSo the domain is x between negative infinity and 5.5, but combined with the previous condition from the square root's right side, x must be >=4 and <=5.5. So x is in [4, 5.5].\n\nSo x=5 is within that interval, so that's okay. x=1 is not in that interval, so it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nHmm, so I think that's the only solution. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in algebra.\n\nStarting with the equation:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) +4\n\nSubtract 4:\n\nx -4 = √(11 -2x)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(x -4)^2 = 11 -2x\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx² -8x +16 =11 -2x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx² -8x +16 -11 +2x =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx² -6x +5 =0\n\nFactor:\n\n(x -5)(x -1)=0\n\nWait, hold on, when I factored x² -6x +5, I thought it was (x-1)(x-5). Let me check that again.\n\nYes, (x -1)(x -5) = x² -6x +5. Correct. So the roots are 1 and 5. But as we saw, only 5 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is"

I want to find where f(x)=0.\n\nWe know x must be >=4 and <=5.5.\n\nAt x=4: f(4) = 4 - sqrt(11 -8) -4 = 4 - sqrt(3) -4 = -sqrt(3) ≈ -1.732 <0\n\nAt x=5: f(5)=5 - sqrt(11-10) -4=5 -1 -4=0.\n\nAt x=5.5: f(5.5)=5.5 - sqrt(11 -11) -4=5.5 -0 -4=1.5>0\n\nSo, f(x) crosses zero at x=5.\n\nBecause f(4) is negative, f(5)=0, f(5.5) is positive. So, the function increases from x=4 to x=5.5, moving from negative to positive, crossing zero at x=5. So that's consistent with the solution.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the only solution is x=5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\):\n\n1.
