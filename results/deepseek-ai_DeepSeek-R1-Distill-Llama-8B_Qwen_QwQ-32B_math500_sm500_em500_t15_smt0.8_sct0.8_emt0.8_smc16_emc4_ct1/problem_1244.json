            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4.\n\nAlright, first things first, square roots can sometimes complicate things, so maybe I can get rid of the square root by squaring both sides of the equation. But before I do that, I should make sure that it's a valid operation. Since we have a square root, the expression inside the square root, which is (11 - 2x), must be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real numbers. So, that gives me an inequality: 11 - 2x \u2265 0. Let me solve that first to know the possible values of x that I can consider.\n\nSolving 11 - 2x \u2265 0:\nSubtract 11 from both sides: -2x \u2265 -11\nNow, divide both sides by -2. But wait, when I divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, that gives me x \u2264 11/2. 11 divided by 2 is 5.5, so x \u2264 5.5.\n\nOkay, so any solution I get must satisfy x \u2264 5.5. Good to know. Now, back to the original equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. I need to solve for x.\n\nLet me isolate the square root term first. So, subtract 4 from both sides:\n\nx - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nNow, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. Let's do that.\n\nLeft side: (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16\n\nRight side: (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nNext, I should bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let's subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx^2 -"

Let me try to factor that.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, 1 and 5. Since the middle term is negative and the constant term is positive, both numbers must be negative.\n\nSo, (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 5.\n\nWait, but I can't forget that we squared both sides earlier, which sometimes introduces extraneous solutions. That means I need to check both solutions in the original equation to make sure they work.\n\nLet's check x = 1 first.\n\nPlugging into the original equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4.\n\nLeft side: x = 1.\n\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 2(1)) + 4 = sqrt(11 - 2) + 4 = sqrt(9) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nWait, 1 does not equal 7. That means x = 1 is an extraneous solution and must be discarded.\n\nNow, let's check x = 5.\n\nLeft side: x = 5.\n\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 2(5)) + 4 = sqrt(11 - 10) + 4 = sqrt(1) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nOkay, 5 equals 5. So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nSo, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps, let me go through the process again quickly.\n\nStarting equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4.\n\nIsolate the sqrt: x - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x).\n\nSquare both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x.\n\nExpand left side: x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x.\n\nBring all terms to left: x^2 -"
