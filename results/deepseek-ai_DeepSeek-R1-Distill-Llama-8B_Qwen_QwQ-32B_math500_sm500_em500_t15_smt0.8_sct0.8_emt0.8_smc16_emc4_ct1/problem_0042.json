            "output": "To solve the problem, I first need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\nI start by determining the prime factors of 284. Breaking it down, 284 equals 2 multiplied by 142, and 142 further breaks down into 2 and 71. So, the prime factorization of 284 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71\u00b9.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/(p - 1) for each prime factor, I calculate the sum of all positive divisors. For the prime number 2 with the exponent 2, the sum is (2\u00b3 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 7. For the prime number 71 with the exponent 1, the sum is (71\u00b2 - 1)/(71 - 1) = 2520. Multiplying these together gives a total sum of divisors of 7 \u00d7 2520 = 17640.\n\nSince I'm looking for the sum of proper divisors, I subtract 284 from the total sum, resulting in 17640 - 284 = 17356.\n\nFinally, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 17356. To do this, I'll repeat the process: first, find the prime factors of 17356. Breaking it down, 17356 equals 4 multiplied by 4329, and further, 4329 is divisible by 3, giving 3 \u00d7 1443. This continues until all factors are broken down into prime numbers. Once I have the prime factors, I'll apply the sum of divisors formula again and then subtract 17356 to get the sum of the proper divisors.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nWhat is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284?\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n\nFirst, we need to find the sum of all proper divisors of 284.\n\n**Step 1.1: Prime Factorization of 284**\n- 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2.\n- 284 \u00f7 2 = 142\n- 142 is also even, so divide by 2: 142 \u00f7 2 = 71\n- 71"
