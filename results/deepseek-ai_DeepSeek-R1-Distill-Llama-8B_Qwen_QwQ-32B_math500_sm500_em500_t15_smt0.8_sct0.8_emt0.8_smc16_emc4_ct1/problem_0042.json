            "output": "To find the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284, I'll start by determining the proper divisors of 284.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 284. I notice that 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. Since 142 is also even, it can be divided by 2 again, resulting in 71. The number 71 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This means the prime factorization of 284 is 2² × 71¹.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is (p⁰ + p¹)(q⁰ + q¹) for a number n = p^a * q^b, I'll compute the sum of all divisors of 284:\n(1 + 2 + 71 + 142) = 216.\n\nSince we're only interested in the proper divisors, I'll subtract the number itself (284) from the total sum of divisors:\n216 - 284 = -68, which doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in calculating the sum of divisors.\n\nRe-evaluating, the correct sum of all divisors should be (1 + 2 + 71 + 142) = 216. Proper divisors exclude the number itself, so I'll subtract 284:\n216 - 284 = -68, which is incorrect. This indicates an error in my approach.\n\nUpon reflection, I realize that proper divisors are positive integers that divide the number without leaving a remainder and are less than the number itself. Therefore, the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 71, and 142. Adding these together gives:\n1 + 2 + 71 + 142 = 216.\n\nNow, I'll find the sum of these proper divisors, which is 216. The next step is to calculate the sum of the proper divisors of 216.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 216. It's divisible by 2, giving 108. Dividing 108 by 2 again yields 54, and dividing 54 by 2 results in 27. Since 27 is divisible by 3, dividing it by 3 gives 9, and dividing 9 by 3 again yields "

            "output": "3, and finally dividing 3 by 3 gives 1. Thus, the prime factorization of 216 is 2³ × 3³.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again:\n(1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = (15)(40) = 600.\n\nThe sum of all divisors of 216 is 600. To find the proper divisors, subtract 216 from this total:\n600 - 216 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of 216 is 384. Since the question asks for the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify the steps again to ensure there are no mistakes. \n\nStarting with 284: its divisors are indeed 1, 2, 71, 142, and 284. The proper divisors exclude 284, so their sum is 1+2+71+142 = 216. Then, moving to 216, its prime factors are 2^3 * 3^3. The sum of divisors formula gives (2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3) * (3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3) = (1+2+4+8)*(1+3+9+27) = 15*40 = 600. Subtracting 216 gives 384. That seems correct. \n\nI think my initial confusion was with the first step where I thought I made a mistake, but after rechecking, it's correct. So the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe proper divisors of 284 are found by factorizing it into primes: \\(284 = 2^2 \\times 71\\). The divisors are \\(1, 2, 4, 71, 142,\\) and \\(284\\).
