            "output": "First, I need to establish the relationships between Trinkets, Blinkets, and Drinkets given in the problem. \n\nWe know that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets. This means that each Trinket can be exchanged for 4 Blinkets.\n\nNext, the problem states that 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets. This tells us the exchange rate between Blinkets and Drinkets.\n\nTo find the value of 56 Drinkets in terms of Trinkets, I'll start by converting Drinkets to Blinkets using the second relationship.\n\nUsing the ratio of 7 Drinkets to 3 Blinkets, I can determine that each Blinket is equivalent to 7/3 Drinkets. Therefore, 56 Drinkets divided by 7/3 will give me the number of Blinkets in 56 Drinkets.\n\nOnce I have the equivalent number of Blinkets, I'll convert these to Trinkets using the first relationship. Since 4 Blinkets equal 1 Trinket, I'll divide the number of Blinkets by 4 to find the equivalent number of Trinkets.\n\nFinally, by following these steps, I'll have the total value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given the following exchange rates in the land of Ink:\n\n1. **Trinkets to Blinkets:**  \n   \\(1\\ \\text{Trinket} = 4\\ \\text{Blinkets}\\)\n\n2. **Blinkets to Drinkets:**  \n   \\(3\\ \\text{Blinkets} = 7\\ \\text{Drinkets}\\)\n\nOur goal is to find the value of **56 Drinkets** in terms of **Trinkets**.\n\nLet's break down the conversion step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Convert Drinkets to Blinkets**\n\nWe know that \\(3\\ \\text{Blinkets} = 7\\ \\text{Drinkets}\\). To find out how many Blinkets correspond to **56 Drinkets**, we can set up a proportion.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7\\ \\text{Drinkets}}{3\\ \\text{Blinkets}} = \\frac{56\\ \\text{Drinkets}}{X\\ \\text{Blinkets}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(X\\):\n\n\\[\nX = \\frac{56\\ \\text{Drinkets} \\times "
