            "output": "First, I need to understand the relationships between the different types of currency in Ink. I know that 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets and that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets.\n\nNext, I'll determine how many Blinkets are equivalent to 1 Drinket by dividing both sides of the 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets equation by 3. This simplifies to 1 Blinket = (7/3) Drinkets, meaning 1 Drinket is worth 3/7 Blinkets.\n\nThen, to find out how many Trinkets 56 Drinkets are worth, I'll multiply the number of Drinkets by the equivalent number of Blinkets per Drinket (3/7). So, 56 Drinkets \u00d7 (3 Blinkets / 7 Drinkets) equals 24 Blinkets.\n\nFinally, since 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, I'll divide the total number of Blinkets by 4 to find the equivalent number of Trinkets. Therefore, 24 Blinkets \u00f7 4 Trinkets per Blinket equals 6 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets step by step.\n\n### Given:\n- **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**\n- **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**\n\n### Step 1: Find the value of 1 Drinket in Blinkets\nSince 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets, we can find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to 1 Drinket:\n\\[\n1 \\text{ Drinket} = \\frac{3 \\text{ Blinkets}}{7 \\text{ Drinkets}} = \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total value of 56 Drinkets in Blinkets\nMultiply the number of Drinkets by the value of 1 Drinket in Blinkets:\n\\[\n56 \\text{ Drinkets} \\times \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets per Drinket} = 24 \\text{ Blinkets}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Blinkets to Trinkets\nSince 1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets, divide the total number of Blinkets by 4 to find the equivalent number of Trinkets:\n\\[\n24 \\text{ Blinkets} \\"
