The problem says that these solutions form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and we need to find the area of that polygon expressed in a specific form and then determine \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, complex equations often have symmetries or can be factored in certain ways. I notice that the coefficients have a pattern: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. That seems a bit magical. Maybe this equation is related to some known polynomial form?\n\nWait, sometimes quartic equations can be transformed into quadratics by substitution. Maybe we can factor this as a biquadratic or something similar. Let me think: if I set \\( w = z^2 \\), then \\( z^4 = w^2 \\), but looking at the equation, the middle terms are linear in \\( z \\), so maybe substitution won't help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this equation is a special case of a known polynomial. Let me see: 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. If I consider these coefficients, they resemble the coefficients of the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\). Let me check:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4 \\)\nSimplify each term:\n- \\( z^4 \\) stays.\n- \\( 4z^3i \\) is good.\n- \\( 6z^2i^2 = 6z^2(-1) = -6z^2 \\)\n- \\( 4zi^3 = 4z(i^2(i)) = 4z(-1)(i) = -4zi \\)\n- \\( i^4 = (i^2)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 \\)\n\nSo expanding \\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi + 1 \\)\n\nWait a minute, that's almost exactly the equation we have, except our equation has an extra \"-i\""

So if I subtract 1 from both sides of the expansion, I get \\( (z + i)^4 -1 -1 = -i \\)? Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given equation is \\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) =0 \\)? Let me check:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\)\n\nBut let's compute the difference between the given equation and the expansion:\n\nGiven equation minus expansion: ( -i ) - ( +1 ) = -i -1. So the given equation is \\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) =0 \\). Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\) is \\( z^4 +4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi +1 \\). The given equation is \\( z^4 +4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i =0 \\). So subtract the expansion from the given equation:\n\nGiven equation - expansion = ( -i ) - ( +1 ) = -i -1. So that would mean the given equation is equal to \\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) =0 \\). Therefore, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\)\n\nAh! That seems to be the case. So the equation simplifies to \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\). That's a big simplification. So the solutions are the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), shifted by \\( -i \\).\n\nTherefore, to find the solutions, we can write \\( z + i = \\sqrt[4]{1 + i} \\), so each solution is \\( z = -i + \\sqrt[4]{1 + i} \\).

Let me see.\n\nWait, but actually, the original roots (the fourth roots of \\(1 + i\\)) are equally spaced on a circle of radius \\(2^{1/8}\\).

Let me compute the distance between point 1 and point 2:\n\nDistance squared: (1.070 - (-0.213))^2 + (-0.787 - 0.070)^2 ≈ (1.283)^2 + (-0.857)^2 ≈ 1.645 + 0.734 ≈ 2.379\n\nSimilarly, distance between point 2 and point 3:\n\nDistance squared: (-0.213 - (-1.070))^2 + (0.070 - (-1.213))^2 ≈ (0.857)^2 + (1.283)^2 ≈ 0.734 + 1.645 ≈ 2.379\n\nSame distance squared between point 3 and point 4:\n\n(-1.070 - 0.213)^2 + (-1.213 - (-2.070))^2 ≈ (-1.283)^2 + (0.857)^2 ≈ 1.645 + 0.734 ≈ 2.379\n\nAnd distance between point 4 and point 1:\n\n(0.213 - 1.070)^2 + (-2.070 - (-0.787))^2 ≈ (-0.857)^2 + (-1.283)^2 ≈ 0.734 + 1.645 ≈ 2.379\n\nSo all sides are equal, which is consistent with it being a square.\n\nNow, to find the area, we can compute the area using the shoelace formula with the coordinates. Let me list the coordinates in order:\n\n1. (1.070, -0.787)\n2. (-0.213, 0.070)\n3. (-1.070, -1.213)\n4. (0.213, -2.070)\n\nBut since shoelace requires the points to be ordered either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Let me make sure they are in order.\n\nAssuming they are given in order, let's apply shoelace.\n\nFormula:\n\nArea = 1/2 |sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|\n\nWhere (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = (x_1, y_1)\n\nSo compute:\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1.

When we shifted down by 1, which translates the square, does that affect the area? No, translation doesn't change the area. So yeah, the area is the same as the original square, which is \\( 2^{5/4} \\).
