The problem says that the solutions to this equation are the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane. My goal is to find the area of that polygon and express it in the form p^(a/b), where p is prime, and then find a + b + p.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that complex roots of polynomials can often be related to geometric shapes in the complex plane. Since it's a fourth-degree equation, there should be four solutions, which would form a quadrilateral. The problem mentions a convex polygon, which for four points usually means a convex quadrilateral.\n\nI wonder if this polynomial can be factored or transformed into a more familiar form. Maybe I can factor it somehow. The coefficients involve i, which suggests that we might have roots related to rotations or something in the complex plane.\n\nLet me look at the equation again: z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0. It seems like the coefficients are following a pattern. Let me write them down:\n\n- z^4 term: coefficient is 1\n- z^3 term: 4i\n- z^2 term: -6\n- z term: -4i\n- constant term: -i\n\nWait a minute, this looks similar to a binomial expansion. Let me check: if I consider something like (z + i)^4, expanding that would give me terms involving z^4, 4z^3i, 6z^2i^2, 4zi^3, and i^4. Calculating each term:\n\n- (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i + 6z^2i^2 + 4zi^3 + i^4\n- Simplify each term:\n  - 6z^2i^2 = 6z^2(-1) = -6z^2\n  - 4zi^3 = 4zi(-i) = -4zi^2 = -4zi\n  - i^4 = 1\n\nSo putting it all together, (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2"

That's not true. So that suggests that the given equation isn't equal to (z + i)^4, but maybe differs by some constant.\n\nWait, let me think.

Well, okay.\n\nThe argument of (1 + i) is π/4, so the argument of (1 + i)^{1/4} is (π/4)/1 = π/4. Wait, no, for each root, the angle is (π/4 + 2πk)/4 for k=0,1,2,3. Wait, actually, no.
