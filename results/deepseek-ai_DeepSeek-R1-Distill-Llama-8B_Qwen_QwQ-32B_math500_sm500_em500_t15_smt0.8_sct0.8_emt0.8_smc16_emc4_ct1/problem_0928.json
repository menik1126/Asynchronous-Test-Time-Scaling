            "output": "To find out how many zeros are at the end of 42!, I need to determine how many times the number 10 is a factor in 42!.\n\nSince 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I should count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of 5s in the factors of 42!. This is done by dividing 42 by 5, which gives 8.4. Taking the floor of this value, I get 8 fives.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 2s in the factors of 42!. Dividing 42 by 2 gives 21, then dividing by 4 gives 10.5, taking the floor, which is 10. Dividing by 8 gives 5.25, taking the floor, which is 5. Dividing by 16 gives 2.625, taking the floor, which is 2. Adding these up, there are 21 twos.\n\nSince there are more twos than fives, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of fives, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, 42! ends with 8 zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeros are at the end of \\(42!\\), we need to find out how many times the number \\(10\\) is a factor in \\(42!\\). Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), we'll count the number of pairs of \\(2\\)s and \\(5\\)s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\).\n\n### Step 1: Count the number of \\(5\\)s in \\(42!\\)\n- Divide \\(42\\) by \\(5\\): \\(42 \\div 5 = 8.4\\). Since we can't have a fraction of a factor, we take the floor value: \\(8\\).\n- There are \\(8\\) fives in \\(42!\\).\n\n### Step 2: Count the number of \\(2\\)s in \\(42!\\)\n- Divide \\(42\\) by \\(2\\): \\(42 \\div 2 = 21\\).\n- Divide \\(42\\) by \\(4\\): \\(42 \\div 4 = 10.5\\), floor is \\(10\\).\n- Divide \\(42\\) by \\(8\\): \\(42 \\div 8 = 5.25\\), floor"
