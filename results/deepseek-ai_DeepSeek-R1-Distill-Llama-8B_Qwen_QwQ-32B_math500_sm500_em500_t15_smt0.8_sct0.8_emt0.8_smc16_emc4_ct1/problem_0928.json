Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. I do this by dividing 42 by 5 and taking the floor of the result, which gives me 8. This means there are 8 factors of 5 in 42!.\n\nNext, I'll determine how many times 2 appears as a factor. By dividing 42 by 2, I get 21, and dividing by 4 gives 10.5, which floors to 10. Dividing by 8 yields 5, and continuing this process for higher powers of 2, I find that there are 22 factors of 2 in 42!.\n\nSince the number of 5s (8) is less than the number of 2s (22), the limiting factor is the number of 5s. Therefore, there are 8 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) (42 factorial), we need to calculate how many times the number 10 is a factor in the product. Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), the number of trailing zeros is determined by the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\).\n\n**Step 1: Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots = 8 + 1 + 0 = 9\n\\]\n\nHowever, considering only up to \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor\\) is sufficient for this calculation.\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of 2s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\"
