Then I have to find the sum a + b + c. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the terms individually. The expression has four terms: √2, 1/√2, √3, and 1/√3. I notice that √2 and √3 are both irrational numbers, and their reciprocals are also irrational. To combine them, I probably need to find a common denominator or rationalize the denominators.\n\nStarting with √2 and 1/√2. I remember that 1/√2 can be rationalized by multiplying numerator and denominator by √2. So, 1/√2 becomes √2/2. Similarly, for 1/√3, it would be √3/3. Let me write that down:\n\n√2 + (√2/2) + √3 + (√3/3)\n\nSo now, the expression is √2 + √2/2 + √3 + √3/3. Hmm, this looks more manageable. Now, let's combine the like terms. Let's group the terms with √2 and the terms with √3 separately.\n\nFor the √2 terms: √2 + √2/2. I can factor out √2:\n\n√2(1 + 1/2) = √2*(3/2) = (3√2)/2\n\nSimilarly, for the √3 terms: √3 + √3/3. Factor out √3:\n\n√3(1 + 1/3) = √3*(4/3) = (4√3)/3\n\nSo now, the entire expression becomes (3√2)/2 + (4√3)/3. Now, to combine these two fractions, they need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common denominator is 6.\n\nSo, I can rewrite each term with denominator 6:\n\n(3√2)/2 = (9√2)/6\n\n(4√3)/3 = (8√3)/6\n\nAdding these together: (9√2"

Here, a=9, b=8, c=6.\n\nWait, but the question says c should be as small as possible. Is 6 the smallest possible? Let's see. The numerator is a combination of √2 and √3, which are irrational and cannot be simplified further because they are different radicals. So, the denominator c has to be 6 because when we added the fractions, the LCD was 6. I don't think we can have a smaller denominator without having fractions in the numerator, which would complicate it more. Therefore, c=6 is indeed the smallest possible.\n\nSo, a=9, b=8, c=6. Therefore, a + b + c is 9 + 8 + 6, which equals 23.\n\nWait, before I finish, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original expression:\n\n√2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3\n\nRationalize the denominators:\n\n√2 + √2/2 + √3 + √3/3\n\nCombine √2 terms: 1 + 1/2 is 3/2, so (3√2)/2\n\nCombine √3 terms: 1 + 1/3 is 4/3, so (4√3)/3\n\nConvert to common denominator 6:\n\n(9√2)/6 + (8√3)/6 = (9√2 + 8√3)/6\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 23.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by rationalizing the denominators of the fractions in the expression. \n\nFirst, we rationalize each term:\n- \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\)\n\nSubstituting these back into the original expression, we get:\n\\[ \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt"
