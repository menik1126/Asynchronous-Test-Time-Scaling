This can be calculated using the combination formula:\n\nC(7,3) = 7! / (3!(7-3)!) = 35.\n\nNext, I need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 4 available:\n\nC(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to select 3 boys and 2 girls, I multiply the two combinations:\n\n35 * 6 = 210.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his statistics class, we'll use combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection doesn't matter.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   \\[\n   C(7,3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \n   \\[\n   C(4,2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the total number of ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = C(7,3) \\times C(4,2) = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
