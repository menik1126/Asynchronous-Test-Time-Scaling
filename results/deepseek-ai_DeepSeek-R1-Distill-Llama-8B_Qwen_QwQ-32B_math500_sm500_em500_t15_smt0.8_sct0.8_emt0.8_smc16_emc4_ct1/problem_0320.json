            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of boys available, which is 7, and the total number of girls, which is 4. Mr. Brennan wants to select 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the boys. Since the order doesn't matter, I'll use the combination formula for selecting 3 boys out of 7, which is denoted as C(7,3).\n\nThen, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the girls. Using the combination formula again, I'll find the number of ways to select 2 girls out of 4, which is C(4,2).\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to form the group, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls. This gives me the total number of possible groups.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation, we can use combinations. \n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two results to find the total number of ways to form the group.**\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Brennan can form the group in \\(\\boxed{210}\\) different ways."
