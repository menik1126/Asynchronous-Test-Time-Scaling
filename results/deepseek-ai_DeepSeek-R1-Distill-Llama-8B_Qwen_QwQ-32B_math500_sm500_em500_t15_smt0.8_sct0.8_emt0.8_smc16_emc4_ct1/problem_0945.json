This gives 40r^9.\n\nNext, I will multiply the denominators: 8r^4 multiplied by 1 (since there's no denominator term in the first fraction). This results in 8r^4.\n\nNow, I have the fraction 40r^9 divided by 8r^4.\n\nI will simplify the numerical coefficients by dividing 40 by 8, which equals 5.\n\nThen, I will address the variable part of the fraction. Since the exponents are 9 and 4, I can subtract the smaller exponent from the larger one to get r^(9-4) = r^5.\n\nFinally, combining these results, the simplified expression is 5r^5.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators and denominators:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10r^3 \\times 4r^6}{8r^4} = \\frac{40r^9}{8r^4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the numerical coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{8} = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the variable exponents:**\n   - For the \\(r\\) terms: Subtract the exponents since the base is the same.\n     \\[\n     r^{9} \\div r^{4} = r^{9-4} = r^{5}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the results:**\n   \\[\n   5r^{5}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{5r^5}\\)"
