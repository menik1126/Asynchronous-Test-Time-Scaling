This means:\n\\[\n\\text{Male Bus Riders} = 1.35 \\times \\text{Female Bus Riders}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Ratios for Each Grade\nWe'll compute the ratio for each grade:\n\n#### **9th Grade**\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{41.1}{39.4} \\approx 1.04\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = |1.04 - 1.35| = 0.31\n\\]\n\n#### **10th Grade**\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{34.4}{33.1} \\approx 1.04\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = |1.04 - 1.35| = 0.31\n\\]\n\n#### **11th Grade**\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{20.6}{13.8} \\approx 1.49\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = |1.49 - 1.35| = 0.14\n\\]\n\n#### **12th Grade**\n\\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{11.6}{8.6} \\approx 1.35\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = |1.35 - 1.35| = 0.00\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Differences\n- **9th Grade:** Difference = 0.31\n- **10th Grade:** Difference = 0.31\n- **11th Grade:** Difference = 0.14\n- **12th Grade"
