            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here about bus riders at Central H.S. They surveyed 300 males and 300 females in each grade. The question is asking for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 135% means in this context. The problem says, \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders.\" So, for each grade, I have to calculate the number of male bus riders and the number of female bus riders, then find out what percentage the male is of the female. If that percentage is closest to 135%, then that's the grade we're looking for.\n\nLooking at the table, each grade has two percentages: one for males and one for females. Since they surveyed 300 males and 300 females in each grade, I can find the actual numbers by multiplying these percentages by 300.\n\nLet me jot down the data:\n\n- **9th grade**: Males = 41.1%, Females = 39.4%\n- **10th grade**: Males = 34.4%, Females = 33.1%\n- **11th grade**: Males = 20.6%, Females = 13.8%\n- **12th grade**: Males = 11.6%, Females = 8.6%\n\nOkay, so for each grade, I need to calculate (Male percentage / Female percentage) and see if it's closest to 1.35 (since 135% is 1.35 times). Alternatively, maybe I should compute (Male count / Female count) and see if it's closest to 1.35. Wait, which one is more accurate?\n\nHmm. Since both the number of males and females surveyed are 300, if I take the percentages and divide them, I can find the ratio as a percentage, which would match the ratio of the actual counts. So, for example, if Male is 41.1% and Female is 39.4%, then 41.1/39.4 is the ratio, and then I can compare that to 1.35.\n\nBut actually, the ratio of the counts is the same as the ratio of the percentages because the total surveyed in each grade is the same ("

            "output": "300 males and 300 females). Let me verify that. Suppose Male is 41.1% of 300, so that's 0.411 * 300, and Female is 0.394 * 300. So the ratio would be (0.411/0.394) = ?\n\nYes, exactly. So, to avoid having to compute the actual numbers, since both are multiplied by the same 300, the ratio will be the same as the ratio of the percentages. So I can just work with the percentages given. That simplifies it.\n\nTherefore, for each grade, compute (Male % divided by Female %) and see which is closest to 1.35. Alternatively, compute (Male % divided by Female %)*100 to get the percentage, then see which is closest to 135. Either way. Maybe doing it as a percentage is easier.\n\nSo let me go through each grade one by one.\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n- Males: 41.1%, Females: 39.4%\n- Male / Female = 41.1 / 39.4 \u2248 Let me calculate that. \n\nLet me do the division: 41.1 divided by 39.4. \n\nWell, 39.4 * 1 = 39.4, which is less than 41.1. The difference is 1.7. So 41.1 /39.4 \u22481.04315 approximately. Because 39.4 + 39.4*0.04315 \u224839.4+1.7\u224841.1. So the ratio is about 104.3%, which is much lower than 135%. So that's way off.\n\nNext, 10th grade:\nMales: 34.4%, Females:33.1%\nAgain, compute 34.4 /33.1 \u2248?\n\nSame approach. 33.1*1.04\u224834.4? Let's check 33.1*1.04 = 33.1 + (0.04*33.1)= 3"

            "output": ".324, so 33.1 +3.324\u224836.424, which is less than 34.4. Wait, no, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should do 34.4 divided by 33.1. Let me do this properly.\n\n33.1 into 34.4. 33.1*1 =33.1. 34.4-33.1=1.3. So 1.3/33.1\u22480.0392. So total is approximately 1.0392, so about 103.92%. That's still around 104%, so not close to 135%.\n\nAlright, moving on to 11th grade:\nMales:20.6%, Females:13.8%\nCompute 20.6 /13.8 \u2248?\n\nSo 13.8*1.5=20.7. Oh, that's very close to 20.6. 13.8*1.5= 13.8 + 6.9=20.7. So 20.6 is just slightly less than 1.5 times. So 20.6 /13.8\u22481.496 approximately, which is about 149.6%.\n\nWait, 149.6% is higher than 135%, but closer to 150%. So that's 14.96% above 135%. So let's note that.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute it more accurately:\n\n20.6 \u00f713.8. Let's do that division.\n\n13.8 goes into 20.6 once, with 6.8 remaining. 6.8 divided by 13.8 is 0.493 approximately. So total is 1.493, so approximately 149.3%, so about 149.3%. So that's 149.3% which is 14.3% higher than 135%. So that's a difference of about 14.3 percentage points.\n\nWait, but let's think about 12th grade.\n\n12th grade: Males 11.6%, Females 8.6%\nCompute 11.6 /8.6 \u2248?\n\n8.6*1.35= let's see:\n\n8.6 *1=8.6\n\n8.6 *0.35=3.01\n\nTotal 8.6 + "

Wait a second. 8.6 multiplied by 1.35 is exactly 11.61, which is very close to the male percentage of 11.6%.\n\nSo 11.6 divided by 8.6 is approximately 1.35 (since 8.6*1.35=11.61). The actual male percentage is 11.6, which is just 0.01 less than 11.61. So that's almost exactly 1.35 times. So that's 135% exactly, except for a tiny difference.\n\nWait, so 11.6 divided by 8.6 is:\n\nLet me compute 11.6 /8.6. Let's do the division:\n\n8.6 goes into 11.6 once, with a remainder of 3.0. Then, 3.0 divided by 8.6 is 0.3488. So total is 1.3488, which is approximately 134.88%, which is just 0.12% less than 135%.

That's extremely close. \n\nThe next closest is 11th grade at 149.3%, which is 14.3% over. The others are way below. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be 12th grade. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for 12th grade again to be sure. \n\nMale percentage: 11.6%, female:8.6%. \n\nSo 11.6 divided by 8.6.

Let me compute that. \n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, it's (11.6 /8.6) =1.3488, which is 134.88%, which is 0.12% less than 135. So very close.
