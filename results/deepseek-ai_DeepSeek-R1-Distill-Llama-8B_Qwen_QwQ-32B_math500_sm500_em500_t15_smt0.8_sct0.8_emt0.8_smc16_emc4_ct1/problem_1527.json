The sum of all the numbers is 96.\n2. The sum of their squares is 144.\n3. The sum of their cubes is 216.\n\nAnd I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with sums of powers, sometimes it's helpful to think about moments or use inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or H\u00f6lder's inequality. But I'm not sure which one applies here. Maybe I should also consider if all the numbers are equal because that might simplify things. If all \\( a_i \\) are equal, then each \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\). Let me check if that works with the other sums.\n\nSo, if each \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\), then the sum of squares would be \\( n \\times \\left(\\frac{96}{n}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9216}{n} \\). They told us this equals 144, so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9216}{n} = 144 \\implies n = \\frac{9216}{144} = 64\n\\]\n\nWait, so if all the numbers are equal, \\( n \\) has to be 64. But the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\)\", which implies there might be more than one possible value. So maybe the numbers aren't all equal?\n\nHmm, okay, so perhaps I need to consider if \\( n \\) can be different. Let's think about the relationship between the sums. I remember that for numbers, the sum of cubes relates to the sum, sum of squares, and maybe the sum of the cubes can be expressed in terms of them. Wait, actually, there's a formula involving the sum, sum of squares, sum of cubes, and the sum of the product of the variables in pairs and triplets. But I might be mixing something up here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the variance or something. Since we have sums of different powers, maybe the variance can help. The variance is related to the mean and the sum of squares."
