The sum of all the a_i's is 96.\n2. The sum of all the a_i squared is 144.\n3. The sum of all the a_i cubed is 216.\n\nAnd the question is asking for the sum of all possible values of n. So, I need to figure out what n could be, given these sums, and then add up those possible n's.\n\nHmm, let me think. Since I have the sums of the first, second, and third powers of these numbers, maybe I can relate them somehow. I remember that for problems involving sums of powers, sometimes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequalities come into play. Or maybe there's a relationship involving variance or something similar.\n\nLet me recall that if we have the sum of numbers, the sum of their squares, and the sum of their cubes, perhaps we can relate them using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other techniques. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that for any set of numbers, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality tells us that:\n\n(sum a_i)^2 ≤ n * sum(a_i^2)\n\nLet me plug in the numbers I have.\n\nLeft side: (sum a_i)^2 = 96² = 9216\n\nRight side: n * sum(a_i^2) = n * 144\n\nSo, according to Cauchy-Schwarz:\n\n9216 ≤ 144n\n\nIf I divide both sides by 144:\n\n9216 / 144 = 64 ≤ n\n\nSo, n must be at least 64. Hmm, interesting.\n\nBut wait, is that the only condition? Or are there other constraints?\n\nAlso, another thought: maybe I can relate the sum of cubes somehow. Because we have sum a_i = 96, sum a_i² = 144, sum a_i³ = 216. Maybe I can use Hölder's inequality or some other higher inequality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps these numbers are related to some optimization problem. For example, for fixed sum and fixed sum of squares, how the sum of cubes is maximized or minimized. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe"

Then the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)^2 = 9216/n. But according to the problem, the sum of squares is 144, so:\n\n9216/n = 144 ⇒ n = 9216 / 144 = 64. So if all a_i are equal, then n must be 64. But the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n,\" so maybe there are other possibilities where the a_i are not all equal?\n\nHmm, so 64 is one possible value of n. But maybe there are other n's where the a_i are not all equal but still satisfy the given sums?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is constructed such that the only possible n is 64, but the question says \"sum of all possible values,\" so maybe there are multiple?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me see if there are other possibilities. Let me consider the case where some of the a_i are different. Let me try with n=64. If all a_i are 96/64 = 1.5, then the sum of squares would be 64*(1.5)^2 = 64*(2.25) = 144, which matches. The sum of cubes would be 64*(1.5)^3 = 64*(3.375) = 216, which also matches. So that works. So n=64 is definitely a possible value.\n\nBut maybe there are other n's where the numbers aren't all equal but still satisfy the three equations?\n\nLet me see. Let me suppose that there are two different values in the sequence. Let's say that there are k numbers equal to x and (n - k) numbers equal to y. Then, we can set up equations:\n\nkx + (n - k)y = 96,\n\nkx² + (n - k)y² = 144,\n\nkx³ + (n - k)y³ = 216.\n\nWe can try to solve these equations for x, y, k, n.

Let me remember that for two variables, we can express sums of powers and find relationships.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the only possible n is 64, and so the sum of all possible n's is just 64. Let me check.\n\nSuppose n=64 is the only possible value. But maybe not. Let me see if there's a way for n to be different.\n\nWait, let's consider another approach. Let me think in terms of the variance. The variance of the numbers is given by:\n\nVar = (sum a_i² / n) - (sum a_i / n)^2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nsum a_i = 96, so average is 96/n.\n\nsum a_i² = 144, so average of squares is 144/n.\n\nThus, variance = (144/n) - (96/n)^2.\n\nSimilarly, the standard deviation would be sqrt( (144/n) - (96/n)^2 ).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in another way. Wait, we did that earlier and found that n ≥ 64.\n\nBut maybe there's another inequality that gives a lower or upper bound on n.\n\nWait, also, let's look at the sum of cubes. I wonder if we can relate that to other sums.\n\nI know that for non-negative real numbers, we can use the inequality that the sum of cubes is at least the cube of the sum divided by n. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, maybe if I consider the Cauchy-Schwarz for the sum of cubes. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Hölder's inequality, since we have sum a_i, sum a_i^2, sum a_i^3.\n\nWait, Hölder's inequality states that for positive real numbers, (sum a_i * a_i * a_i) ≤ (sum a_i^p)^(1/p) * (sum a_i^q)^(1/q) * (sum a_i^r)^(1/r) ), where 1/p + 1/q + 1/r = 1. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps power mean. The power mean inequality says that for positive real numbers,\n\n("

But wait, in the case where all a_i are equal, we had n=64. So, perhaps 64 is the minimum possible value of n, but maybe n can be larger.\n\nWait, but how can n be larger than 64? Because if n is larger than 64, we have more variables, so the individual a_i's could be smaller. Hmm, maybe as n increases, each a_i is smaller, so their squares and cubes would be smaller. So, perhaps for n larger than 64, the sum of squares and cubes would decrease, but in our problem, sum of squares is 144 and sum of cubes is 216, which are higher than what you get when a_i's are equal.\n\nWait, when n=64, a_i = 1.5 each. If I make n larger, say n=65, and spread the total sum 96 over 65 variables, each a_i would be slightly less than 1.5, so sum of squares would be less than 144, right? But in our problem, sum of squares is exactly 144, which is higher than the case where n=64. So perhaps n can't be more than 64, because otherwise the sum of squares would be lower than 144.\n\nWait, let me check this.\n\nWait, let me consider two cases: n=64 and n=65.\n\nIn the case where n=64, each a_i is 1.5, sum of squares is 64*(1.5)^2=64*2.25=144, which is correct.\n\nIf I take n=65, I can't have all a_i's equal because 96/65 ≈ 1.4769, which is less than 1.5.
