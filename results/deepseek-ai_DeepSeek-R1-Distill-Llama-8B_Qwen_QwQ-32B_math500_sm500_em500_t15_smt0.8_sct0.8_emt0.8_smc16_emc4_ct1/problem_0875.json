            "output": "Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It says: If we write the expression √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3 in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers and c is as small as possible, then what is a + b + c?\n\nHmm, let's break this down. The expression has four terms: two with square roots and their reciprocals. Maybe I can simplify each pair separately.\n\nStarting with √2 + 1/√2. To combine these, I need a common denominator. Let me rationalize 1/√2. That would be multiplying numerator and denominator by √2, so 1/√2 becomes √2/2. So now the terms are √2 + √2/2. To add them, I can express √2 as 2√2/2. So adding 2√2/2 + √2/2 gives 3√2/2.\n\nOkay, that takes care of the √2 terms. Now moving on to √3 + 1/√3. Similarly, I'll rationalize 1/√3 by multiplying numerator and denominator by √3, getting √3/3. So now it's √3 + √3/3. Expressing √3 as 3√3/3, so adding 3√3/3 + √3/3 gives 4√3/3.\n\nSo now the original expression is simplified to 3√2/2 + 4√3/3. Now, I need to combine these two fractions into a single fraction with a common denominator. To do that, I find the least common denominator (LCD) of 2 and 3, which is 6.\n\nSo, I'll convert each fraction to have the denominator of 6. For 3√2/2, I multiply numerator and denominator by 3, resulting in 9√2/6. For 4√3/3, I multiply numerator and denominator by 2, getting 8√3/6.\n\nNow, adding these together: 9√2/6 + 8√3/6. Since they have the same denominator, I can combine them into (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nSo, in the form (a√2 + b√3)/c,"

            "output": " the values are a = 9, b = 8, c = 6. To make sure c is as small as possible, I should check if 9 and 8 have any common factors with 6. Well, 6 is 2×3, and 9 is divisible by 3, 8 is not, so the denominator can't be reduced further because 8 and 6 share a common factor of 2, but 9 and 6 share a common factor of 3. Since the numerator has both 9√2 and 8√3, which are separate terms, we can't factor out a 2 or 3 from both.\n\nTherefore, the expression is already in its simplest form with the smallest possible c, which is 6. So, adding a, b, and c together: 9 + 8 + 6 equals 23.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is simplified step by step by rationalizing and combining fractions, leading to the form (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Thus, a=9, b=8, c=6, and their sum is 23.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{23}"
