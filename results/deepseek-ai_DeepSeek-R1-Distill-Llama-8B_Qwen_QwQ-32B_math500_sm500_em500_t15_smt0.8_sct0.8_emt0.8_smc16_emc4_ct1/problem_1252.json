            "output": "First, I need to convert the decimal number 999 to its base six equivalent. To do this, I'll divide 999 by 6 and record the quotient and remainder.\n\nThe quotient from the first division is 166, and the remainder is 3. This means that the least significant digit in base six is 3.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6 again. The new quotient is 27, and the remainder is 4. So, the next digit in base six is 4.\n\nThen, I'll divide the new quotient 27 by 6, yielding a quotient of 4 with a remainder of 3. This means the next digit is 3.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the quotient 4 by 6, which gives a quotient of 0 with a remainder of 4. The most significant digit in base six is therefore 4.\n\nPutting all the remainders together from last to first, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 1443₆.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6**:\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - The first (rightmost) digit in base six is the remainder, which is **3**.\n\n2. **Divide the quotient (166) by 6**:\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - The next digit in base six is **4**.\n\n3. **Divide the new quotient (27) by 6**:\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - The next digit in base six is **3**.\n\n4. **Divide the new quotient (4) by 6**:\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - The next (and most significant) digit in base six is **4**.\n\n5. **Finalize the base six number**:\n   - Arrange the remainders from last to first: **4**, **3**, **4**, **3"
