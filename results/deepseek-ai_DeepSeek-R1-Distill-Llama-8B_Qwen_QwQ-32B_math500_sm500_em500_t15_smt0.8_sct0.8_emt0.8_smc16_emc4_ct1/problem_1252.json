It wants the base six equivalent of the number 999 in decimal.\n\nTo convert a decimal number to base six, I should divide the number by six and record the remainders. I'll start with 999 divided by 6.\n\nCalculating 999 ÷ 6 gives me 166 with a remainder of 3. I'll set this remainder as the least significant digit.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6. This gives 27 with a remainder of 4. I'll write down the 4 as the next digit.\n\nContinuing, I'll divide 27 by 6, which equals 4 with a remainder of 3. I'll add the 3 as the following digit.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the new quotient 4 by 6. This results in 0 with a remainder of 4. I'll place the 4 as the most significant digit.\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 3444.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's convert the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Divide by 6 and Find Remainders\nTo convert a decimal number to base six, we repeatedly divide the number by six and record the remainders. \n\n1. **First Division:**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Least Significant Digit (LSD):** 3\n\n2. **Second Division:**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Next Digit:** 4\n\n3. **Third Division:**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Next Digit:** 3\n\n4. **Fourth Division:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Most Significant Digit (MSD):** 4\n\n### Step 2: Combine the Remainders\nReading the remainders from the last division to the first, we get the base six number:\n\\[\n4\\"

Hmm, in my initial reasoning, I had 3444, but here I wrote 4343. Let me verify each step carefully.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\n1. **First Division:**\n   \\[\n   999 ÷ 6 = 166.5, but integer division gives 166 with remainder 3 (since 6×166=996; 999−996=3). Correct.\n\n2. **Second Division:**\n   \\[\n   166 ÷ 6 = 27.666..., so 27×6=162, remainder 4 (166−162=4). Correct.\n\n3. **Third Division:**\n   \\[\n   27 ÷ 6 = 4.5 → 4×6=24, remainder 3 (27−24=3). Correct.\n\n4. **Fourth Division:**\n   \\[\n   4 ÷ 6 = 0.666..., so remainder 4 (since 0×6=0, 4−0=4). Correct.\n\nSo the remainders, from last to first, are 4 (from 4/6), then 3 (from 27/6), then 4 (from 166/6), then 3 (from 999/6). So the digits are 4, 3, 4, 3 → 4343? Wait, but in my initial reasoning I thought 3444. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first remainder is the least significant digit. Let me list them in order:\n\nFirst division remainder: 3 (LSD)\nSecond division remainder: 4\nThird division remainder: 3\nFourth division remainder: 4 (MSD)\n\nSo the digits are 4 (MSD), 3, 4, 3 (LSD)."
