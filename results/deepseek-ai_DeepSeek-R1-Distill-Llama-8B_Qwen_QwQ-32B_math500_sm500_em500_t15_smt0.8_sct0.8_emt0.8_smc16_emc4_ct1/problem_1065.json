            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, I can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by the number of sides, which is 6.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the perimeter of the regular octagon. The problem states that both the hexagon and the octagon have the same perimeter. Therefore, the perimeter of the octagon is also 6 times the side length of the hexagon, which is 16 cm.\n\nHowever, I realize that I need to express the perimeter in terms of a variable to find the relationship between the side lengths. Let’s denote the side length of the octagon as \\( x \\).\n\nNow, I can set up the equation for the perimeters:\nPerimeter of the hexagon = 6 × 16 cm = 96 cm\nPerimeter of the octagon = 8 × \\( x \\)\n\nSince the perimeters are equal, I can equate the two expressions:\n8 × \\( x \\) = 96 cm\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n\\( x \\) = 96 cm ÷ 8\n\\( x \\) = 12 cm\n\nTherefore, each side of the regular octagon is 12 centimeters long.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the length of each side of the regular octagon step by step.\n\n### Given:\n- **Perimeter of the regular hexagon** = Perimeter of the regular octagon\n- **Side length of the hexagon** = 16 cm\n- **Number of sides in a hexagon** = 6\n- **Number of sides in an octagon** = 8\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon\nThe perimeter (\\(P\\)) of a regular polygon is given by:\n\\[\nP = \\text{Number of sides} \\times \\text{Side length}\n\\]\nFor the hexagon:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Express the Perimeter of the Octagon\nLet \\( x \\) be the length of each side of the octagon.
