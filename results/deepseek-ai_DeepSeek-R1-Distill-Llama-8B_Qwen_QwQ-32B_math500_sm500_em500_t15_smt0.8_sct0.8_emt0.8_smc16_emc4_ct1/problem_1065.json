            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm and a hexagon has 6 sides, the perimeter is 16 cm multiplied by 6, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, since the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, the perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm. A regular octagon has 8 sides, so I will divide the total perimeter by 8 to find the length of each side of the octagon.\n\nFinally, dividing 96 cm by 8 gives me the length of each side of the octagon, which is 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- A regular hexagon with a side length of 16 cm.\n- The regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon.\n\n**Steps to Find the Side Length of the Octagon:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times \\text{Side length} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Perimeter of the Octagon:**\n   \n   Since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon,\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Side Length of the Octagon:**\n   \n   A regular octagon has 8 equal sides.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Side length of octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{8} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nEach side of the regular octagon is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) centimeters long."
