It has 10 complex roots, and they come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). I need to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nFirst, I recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real number. So each term in the sum is the reciprocal of the squared modulus of each root. That is, \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\).\n\nSince the equation is a polynomial of degree 10, Vieta's formulas might be useful here. Vieta relates the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. But I need to find the sum of reciprocals of squared moduli, which seems a bit tricky.\n\nI know that for a complex number \\(r\\), \\(|r|^2 = r \\overline{r}\\). So, if I can express \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\) in terms of the equation, maybe I can relate it to something I can compute from the polynomial's coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that for any root \\(r\\) of a polynomial \\(P(x)\\), there's a relationship with the reciprocal polynomial. If \\(P(x) = 0\\), then \\(1/(x - r)\\) is a term in the derivative, but I don't know if that directly helps.\n\nWait, let me think. If \\(r_i\\) is a root, then \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking modulus on both sides, we have \\(|x|^{10} = |13x - 1|^{10}\\), so \\(|x| = |13x - 1|\\). But that's only for real x, right? Since modulus is always real"

Let me compute y_9:\n\ny_9 = e^{i (\u03c0 + 18\u03c0)/10}= e^{i 19\u03c0/10}=e^{-i \u03c0/10 + i 2\u03c0}= e^{-i \u03c0/10}, which is same as y_0's conjugate. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps better to see that the roots come in pairs where y and y' are conjugates, so the 10 roots consist of 5 conjugate pairs.\n\nThus, if y and y' are conjugates, then their contributions to Re(y) will be added.\n\nBut since in the sum, for each root r_i, we have 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) =170 -26 Re(y_i). So, the sum over 5 roots would be sum_{i=1}^5 [170 -26 Re(y_i)].\n\nBut since the roots come in conjugate pairs, the Re(y_i) for each pair would be added as Re(y) + Re(\\overline{y}) =2 Re(y).\n\nTherefore, perhaps the sum over y's can be simplified.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term in the sum is for a single root, not a pair. Wait, no, the roots r_i are 5 distinct roots, each with their own y_i, but actually, in reality, each root r_i is associated with a y and another conjugate pair.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the sum over all 10 roots y, but then note that each 1/(r \\overline{r}) is |13 y -1|^2, so the sum over all roots is the sum over all y's. But since the polynomial has 10 roots, if I can compute the sum over all y's, then divide by 2 because the roots are paired.\n\nWait, but the problem only asks for the sum over 5 terms, each corresponding to a distinct pair? Or is it over all 10 roots but as 5 pairs? Wait, problem statement says 10 complex roots r1, r1_bar, r2, r2_bar"

Since each pair contributes the same term, so the total sum is 5 terms, each being 1/|r_i|^2. So, the total sum is the sum over all 5 distinct roots (each pair counted once) of 1/|r_i|^2.\n\nBut in terms of the y's, each root r_i corresponds to a unique y, so the 10 roots correspond to 10 y's. But since each pair (r_i, r_i_bar) corresponds to two y's (y and its conjugate?), so the 10 roots correspond to 10 y's, but grouped into 5 conjugate pairs.\n\nTherefore, the sum over the 5 terms (each term being 1/|r_i|^2) is equal to the sum over all 10 roots divided by 2, because each pair contributes the same value.

Wait, no, because each pair contributes one term (since the problem lists each pair once). So actually, the problem's sum is exactly the sum over all 10 roots divided by 2?

Wait, no, the problem's sum is over the 5 distinct terms, each corresponding to a pair. Since each pair has the same value, so the total is 5 terms each equal to 1/|r_i|^2. So, the total is the same as the sum over all 10 roots divided by 2, because each term is counted twice in the 10 roots.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nSuppose the roots are r1, \\overline{r1}, r2, \\overline"

Therefore, S = T/2.\n\nThus, if I can compute the total sum T over all roots, then S = T/2.\n\nTherefore, since T is the sum over all 10 roots of 1/|r_k|^2, which is the same as sum_{k=1}^{10} |13 y_k -1|^2, as per above.\n\nThus, T = sum_{k=1}^{10} |13 y_k -1|^2.\n\nBut y_k are the 10th roots of -1, each y has modulus 1, so y_k lies on the unit circle.
