The roots are given in pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1\\), \\(r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). So each \\(r_i\\) has its complex conjugate as another root.\n\nThe question is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the product of each root and its conjugate. Specifically, it's \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\). Hmm, okay. So I need to find each \\( \\frac{1}{r_i\\overline{r_i}} \\) and sum them up.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is the square of the modulus of \\(r\\). So, \\(|r|^2 = r \\overline{r}\\). Therefore, \\( \\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}} = \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} \\). That means the sum we're trying to find is the sum of \\(1/|r_1|^2 + 1/|r_2|^2 + \\dots + 1/|r_5|^2\\).\n\nSo, I need to find \\(|r_i|^2\\) for each root and then sum their reciprocals. How can I approach this?\n\nGiven the equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), maybe I can factor it or make a substitution. Let's see.\n\nLet me try letting \\(y = x^{10}\\).

Then, the sum over all 10 roots would be:\n\n\\( \\sum_{k=0}^{9} |1 -13 \\omega_k |^2 \\).\n\nBut since the roots come in conjugate pairs, the terms come in pairs of equal values.
