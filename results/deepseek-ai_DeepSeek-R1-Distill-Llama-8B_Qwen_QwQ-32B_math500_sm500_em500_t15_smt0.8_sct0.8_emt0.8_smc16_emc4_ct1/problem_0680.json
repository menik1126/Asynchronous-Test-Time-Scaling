Therefore, the number of players x must satisfy the equation x multiplied by y equals 54.\n\nSince x is at least 2 and y is at least 5, I can express y as 54 divided by x. This means the minimum value for y occurs when x is maximized, and vice versa.\n\nTo find the possible values of x, I need to identify all divisors of 54 that are greater than or equal to 2 and for which 54 divided by x is at least 5. This will give me the valid numbers of players that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nNext, I'll list the divisors of 54: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54. However, since x must be at least 2, I can disregard 1.\n\nNow, I'll check each divisor starting from 2 to see if the corresponding y value meets the minimum requirement of 5. If 54 divided by x is 5 or more, then that x is a valid number of players.\n\nContinuing with this process, I find that the valid values of x are 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. These are the values that satisfy both conditions: x is at least 2, and y is at least 5.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 possible values for the number of players x.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values for \\( x \\) (the number of players), we start by noting that the total number of cards is 54, and each player receives \\( y \\) cards. \n\nGiven:\n- Total cards: \\( 54 \\)\n- Number of players: \\( x \\)\n- Cards per player: \\( y \\)\n\nWe have the equation:\n\\[\nx \\times y = 54\n\\]\n\n**Constraints:**\n- \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n- \\( y \\geq 5 \\)\n\n**Step 1: Find Possible Values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)**\nSince \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive integers, we can list the factor pairs of 54:\n- \\( (x, y) = (1, 54) \\)\n- \\( (2, 27) \\)\n- \\( (3"
