I'll multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2.\n\nNext, I'll add all the resulting products together to get the total decimal value.\n\nFinally, I'll convert this decimal number to base eight by determining how many groups of eight (since base eight uses digits from 0 to 7) fit into the total and finding the remainders, which will give me the final base eight number.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to its equivalent in base eight (\\( octal \\)), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Binary to Decimal Conversion:**\n   Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit (which is \\(2^0 = 1\\)).\n\n2. **Expand the Binary Number:**\n   \\[\n   1\\,0\\,1\\,0\\,1\\,0\\,0\\,1\\,1\\,1\\,0_2 = 1 \\times 2^{10} + 0 \\times 2^9 + 1 \\times 2^8 + 0 \\times 2^7 + 1 \\times 2^6 + 0 \\times 2^5 + 0 \\times 2^4 + 1 \\times 2^3 + 1 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Each Term:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 \\times 2^{10} &= 1024 \\\\\n   0 \\times 2^9 &= 0 \\\\\n   1 \\times 2^8 &= 256 \\\\\n   0 \\times 2^7 &= 0 \\\\\n   1 \\times 2^6 &= 64 \\\\\n   0 \\times 2^5 &= 0 \\\\\n   0 \\times 2^4 &= 0 \\\\\n   1 \\times 2^3 &= "
