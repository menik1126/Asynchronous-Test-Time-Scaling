The last group, 10, has fewer than three bits, so I'll pad it with a leading zero to make it 010.\n\nNext, I'll convert each binary triplet to its corresponding octal value. \n\n- 101 in binary equals 5 in octal.\n- 010 in binary equals 2 in octal.\n- 011 in binary equals 3 in octal.\n- 010 in binary equals 2 in octal.\n\nFinally, I'll combine these octal numbers from left to right to get the final base eight representation, which is 5232.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\( 10101001110_2 \\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide the binary number into groups of three bits starting from the right**:\n\n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n   \n   If the last group has fewer than three bits, pad it with leading zeros to make it three bits:\n\n   ```\n   101 010 011 010\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert each binary triplet to its corresponding octal value**:\n\n   - \\( 101_2 = 5_8 \\)\n   - \\( 010_2 = 2_8 \\)\n   - \\( 011_2 = 3_8 \\)\n   - \\( 010_2 = 2_8 \\)\n\n3. **Combine the octal values from left to right**:\n\n   ```\n   5 \\quad 2 \\quad 3 \\quad 2\n   ```\n   \n   Concatenating these gives \\( 5232_8 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5232_8}\n\\]"
