            "output": "First, I'll recall that the product of distinct positive integers is 84. My goal is to find the combination of these numbers that adds up to the smallest possible sum.\n\nI'll start by factoring 84 into its prime factors: 2 × 2 × 3 × 7. This gives me the prime components that make up the product.\n\nNext, I'll consider how to break down these prime factors into distinct integers. The more smaller numbers I include, the higher the sum tends to be, so I should aim for larger numbers to minimize the sum. However, all numbers must be distinct.\n\nI'll begin by listing possible sets of numbers:\n1. 1, 2, 3, 7: Their product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 42, which is less than 84. I need a larger number.\n2. 1, 2, 3, 7, 2: This includes a duplicate, which isn't allowed.\n3. 2, 3, 7: Their product is 2 × 3 × 7 = 42. Still less than 84.\n4. 1, 2, 3, 7, 2: Again, duplicates are present, so this isn't valid.\n5. 1, 2, 4, 7: Their product is 1 × 2 × 4 × 7 = 56. Still not 84.\n6. 1, 2, 4, 7, 3: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 7 = 168, which is too large.\n7. 1, 2, 6, 7: Their product is 1 × 2 × 6 × 7 = 84. This fits the requirement, and the sum is 1 + 2 + 6 + 7 = 16.\n\nFinally, I'll verify if there's any other combination with a smaller sum. Upon reviewing, I realize that there isn't a valid set of distinct integers with a product of 84 that adds up to less than 16.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 84**:\n   - 84 can be factored into primes as \\( 2 \\times "
