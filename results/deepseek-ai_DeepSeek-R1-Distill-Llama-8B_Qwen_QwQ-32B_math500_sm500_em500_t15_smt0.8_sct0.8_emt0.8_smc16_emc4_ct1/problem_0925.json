The prime factors of 84 are 2, 3, and 7, which multiply together to give 84.\n\nNext, I consider different ways to combine these prime factors while ensuring all integers are distinct. The goal is to minimize the sum, so I aim to use smaller numbers as much as possible.\n\nFirst, I try using the smallest prime factors: 2, 3, and 7. Their sum is 2 + 3 + 7, which equals 12. However, I can likely achieve a smaller sum by combining factors in a different way.\n\nAnother combination is grouping 2 and 3 together to form 6, resulting in the numbers 6, 7, and 2. Wait, that's not allowed because 2, 6, and 7 are all distinct, but their sum is 2 + 6 + 7 = 15, which is higher than 12.\n\nWhat if I group 2 and 7 to make 14? Then the numbers would be 3 and 14, giving a sum of 3 + 14 = 17, which is even higher.\n\nAlternatively, grouping 3 and 7 gives 21, and the numbers would be 2 and 21, resulting in a sum of 2 + 21 = 23, which is worse.\n\nIt seems that splitting the factors into 2, 3, and 7 directly gives the smallest sum of 12. Therefore, the least possible sum of these integers is 12.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84:**\n   - 84 can be factored into prime numbers: \\(84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n\n2. **Identify the smallest distinct integers:**\n   - To minimize the sum, use the smallest possible distinct integers.\n   - From the prime factors, the numbers are 2, 3, and 7.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum:**\n   - \\(2 + 3 + 7 = 12\\).\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, we realize that combining factors might yield a lower sum. Let's explore this.\n\n4. **Alternative combination:**\n   -"

However, this includes duplicates (since 2 is repeated), which is invalid.\n   - Another attempt: Combine \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\), but \\(84 = 4 \\times 3 \\times 7\\). The integers are 4, 3, 7, which are distinct. Their sum is \\(4 + 3 + 7 = 14\\), which is larger than 12.\n\n5. **Verify no smaller combinations exist:**\n   - Using 1 as a factor (since 1 is a positive integer) might help, but \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 42\\), which is half of 84. To reach 84, we need another factor of 2, leading to \\(1, 2, 3, 14\\) (sum \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 14 = 20\\)), which is worse.\n   - Other combinations like \\(1, 6, 7, 2\\) (sum \\(16\\)) also exceed 12.\n\nThus, the smallest distinct integers are indeed 2, 3, and 7, with the minimal sum of \\(12\\).\n\n\\boxed{12}"
