To solve for \\(x\\), I need to eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator.\n\nI can do this by cross-multiplying, which means I'll multiply the numerator of each fraction by the denominator of the other fraction. This gives me \\(2(x - 5) = 3 \\times 4\\).\n\nNext, I'll distribute the 2 on the left side, resulting in \\(2x - 10 = 12\\).\n\nThen, I'll isolate the term with \\(x\\) by adding 10 to both sides, leading to \\(2x = 22\\).\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 2 to solve for \\(x\\), which gives me \\(x = 11\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\[ \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x-5}, \\] follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiply** to eliminate the fractions:\n   \\[\n   2(x - 5) = 3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distribute** the 2 on the left side:\n   \\[\n   2x - 10 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate the term with \\( x \\)** by adding 10 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x = 22\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)** by dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 11\n   \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
