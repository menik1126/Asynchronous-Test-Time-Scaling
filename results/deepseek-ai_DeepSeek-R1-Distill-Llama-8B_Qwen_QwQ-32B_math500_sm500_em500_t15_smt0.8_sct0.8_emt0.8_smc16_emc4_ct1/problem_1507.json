Since the problem specifies that the two letters must be different, the number of possible combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, for the numbers, there are 10 possible digits (0-9). Similar to the letters, the digits must also be different. Therefore, the number of possible combinations for the numbers is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of unique license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we will analyze each section of the plate and calculate the number of combinations.\n\n1. **Letters Section:**\n   - **Total letters (A-Z):** 26 letters\n   - **Condition:** Both letters must be different.\n   - **Calculation:** \n     \\[\n     26 \\text{ (choices for first letter)} \\times 25 \\text{ (choices for second letter)} = 650 \\text{ combinations}\n     \\]\n   \n2. **Numbers Section:**\n   - **Total digits (0-9):** 10 digits\n   - **Condition:** Both digits must be different.\n   - **Calculation:** \n     \\[\n     10 \\text{ (choices for first digit)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for second digit)} = 90 \\text{ combinations}\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Total License Plate Combinations:**\n   - **Calculation:** \n     \\[\n     650 \\text{ (letter combinations)} \\times 90 \\text{ (number combinations)} = 58,500\n     \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
