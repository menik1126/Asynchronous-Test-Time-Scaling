            "output": "To determine the number of possible license plates, I need to consider the structure of the plate. Each plate consists of two different letters followed by two different digits.\n\nFirst, for the letters, there are 26 letters in the English alphabet. Since the two letters must be different, the number of possible combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nFor the digits, there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9). Similar to the letters, the two digits must be different, so the number of possible combinations for the digits is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll analyze each part of the license plate separately and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Letters:**  \n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).  \n   - Since the license plate requires **2 different letters**, the number of possible combinations for the letters is:  \n     \\[\n     26 \\times 25\n     \\]\n     (Here, 26 choices for the first letter and 25 choices for the second letter.)\n\n2. **Digits:**  \n   - There are 10 digits (0-9).  \n   - Similarly, for the two different digits, the number of possible combinations is:  \n     \\[\n     10 \\times 9\n     \\]\n     (10 choices for the first digit and 9 choices for the second digit.)\n\n3. **Total Combinations:**  \n   - To find the total number of license plates, multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations:  \n     \\[\n     (26 \\times 25) \\times (10 \\times 9)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 26 \\times 25 \\times 10 \\times 9\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 26 \\times 225 \\times 10\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 26 \\times 2250\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 58500\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
