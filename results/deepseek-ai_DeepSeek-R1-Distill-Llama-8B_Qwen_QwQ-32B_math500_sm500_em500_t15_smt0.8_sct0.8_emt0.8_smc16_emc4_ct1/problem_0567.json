            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of seats around the table. Since there are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, that makes a total of 11 seats.\n\nNext, I should consider the arrangement constraints. All members of each party must sit together, which means the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent will each form a single block or segment around the table.\n\nGiven that the seating is circular, one position can be fixed to eliminate equivalent rotations. I'll fix the Independent's seat to serve as the reference point.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to arranging the three blocks (Democrats, Republicans, Independent) around the table. Since there are three blocks and one position is fixed, the number of ways to arrange these blocks is 2. The Independent can either be between the Democrats and Republicans or flanked by both.\n\nWithin each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. The Democrats can be arranged in 5! ways, the Republicans in 5! ways, and the Independent is a single individual, so only 1 way.\n\nMultiplying these together, the total number of distinct seatings is 2 \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 1.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways the Senate committee can sit around the circular table under the given conditions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Members**:  \n   - **Democrats**: 5  \n   - **Republicans**: 5  \n   - **Independent**: 1  \n   - **Total**: \\(5 + 5 + 1 = 11\\) members.\n\n2. **Arrangement Constraints**:  \n   - All members of each party must sit together.  \n   - Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.\n\n3. **Fixing a Position**:  \n   - Since the seating is circular, we can fix one member's position to eliminate rotations. For simplicity, fix the **Independent** member's seat.\n\n4. **Arranging the Blocks**:  \n   - Now, we have three blocks to arrange around the table:  \n     - **Democrats (D-block)**  \n     - **Republicans (R-block)**  \n     - **Independent (I-block)**  \n   - Since one position is fixed, the number of ways to arrange these blocks is \\(2\\) (I can be to the left or right of the combined D and R blocks).\n\n5. **Arranging Within Blocks**:  \n   - **D-block**: \\("
