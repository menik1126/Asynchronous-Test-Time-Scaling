            "output": "First, I recognize that the problem involves arranging members of three distinct groups around a circular table. The groups are Democrats, Republicans, and an Independent.\n\nNext, since all members of each party must sit together, I can treat each party group as a single unit or \"block.\" This simplifies the problem by reducing the total number of units to arrange around the table.\n\nThere are 3 blocks in total: Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent. Arranging these blocks around a circular table can be done in (3 - 1)! ways, which equates to 2! or 2 ways.\n\nEach block itself consists of a specific number of members that can be arranged among themselves. The Democrats have 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans also have 5 members, giving them 5! arrangements. The Independent, being a single person, has only 1 way to arrange himself.\n\nFinally, I multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the members within each block. This gives me the total number of distinct seatings possible.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways the Senate committee can be seated around a circular table with the specified conditions, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Treat Each Party as a Single Unit:**\n   - Since all members of each party must sit together, consider each party (Democrats, Republicans, and Independent) as a single \"block\" or \"unit.\"\n   - This reduces the problem to arranging 3 units around a circular table.\n\n2. **Arrange the Units Around the Circular Table:**\n   - The number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) units around a circular table is \\( (n-1)! \\).\n   - Here, \\( n = 3 \\).\n   - \\( (3-1)! = 2! = 2 \\) ways.\n\n3. **Arrange Members Within Each Unit:**\n   - **Democrats:** 5 members can be arranged among themselves in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n   - **Republicans:** Similarly, 5 members can be arranged in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n   - **Independent:** Only 1 person, so there's only 1 way to arrange.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements:**\n   - Multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange the members within each unit:\n   \\[\n  "
