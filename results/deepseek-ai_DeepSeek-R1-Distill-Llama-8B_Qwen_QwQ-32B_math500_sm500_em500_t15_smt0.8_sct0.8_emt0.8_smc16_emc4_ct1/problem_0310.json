            "output": "Okay, I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 - 5x -14). Then, I have to add the values a, b, and c together, where a and b are the x-values of the vertical asymptotes, and c is the y-value of the horizontal asymptote.\n\nFirst, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't zero there as well. So, I should factor the denominator to find its roots.\n\nThe denominator is x\u00b2 -5x -14. Let me try factoring that. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5. Hmm, 2 and -7? Yes, because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. So, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7).\n\nSo, the denominator is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x - 7 = 0, which means x = -2 and x = 7. That means the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x =7. So, a = -2 and b =7.\n\nNext, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I recall that the rules for horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. In this case, the numerator is of degree 1 (since it's 2x) and the denominator is of degree 2. \n\nWhen the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. If the degree of the numerator is less, then as x approaches infinity, the function behaves like the numerator divided by the leading term of the denominator, which is x\u00b2. So, the function behaves like (2x)/x\u00b2 = 2/x, which approaches 0 as x goes to infinity or negative infinity. So, yes, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Therefore, c = 0.\n\nNow, I need to add a, b, and c together: a = -2, b =7, c =0. So, -2 +7 +0 equals 5. \n\nWait, let me double-check everything. Did I factor the denominator correctly? x\u00b2 -5"

So, that seems correct.\n\nFor the horizontal asymptote, another way to think is using the formula: lim (x->\u221e) f(x) = lim (x->\u221e) (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). Dividing numerator and denominator by x\u00b2, we get lim (x->\u221e) (2/x)/(1 -5/x -14/x\u00b2). As x approaches infinity, 5/x and 14/x\u00b2 go to zero, so it's 0/(1) = 0. So yes, that confirms it's y=0.\n\nSo, adding them up: (-2) +7 +0 =5. That should be the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe vertical asymptotes are found by setting the denominator equal to zero, which gives \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). The horizontal asymptote is determined by the difference in degrees of the numerator and denominator, resulting in \\( y = 0 \\). Adding these values together:\n\n\\[\na + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{5}"
