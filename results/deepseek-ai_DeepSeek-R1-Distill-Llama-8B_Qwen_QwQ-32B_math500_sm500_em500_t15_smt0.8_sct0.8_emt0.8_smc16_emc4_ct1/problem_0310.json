Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I should factor the denominator to find those x-values.\n\nThe denominator is x² -5x -14. Let me try to factor that. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, 2 and -7? Because 2 * (-7) = -14, and 2 + (-7) = -5. Yeah, that works. So, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). That means the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nWait, before I move on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in factoring. If I plug in x = -2 into the denominator, it should be zero: (-2)^2 -5*(-2) -14 = 4 +10 -14 = 0. Yep. And x = 7: 7^2 -5*7 -14 = 49 -35 -14 = 0. That's correct.\n\nOkay, so vertical asymptotes are x = -2 and x =7. So, a = -2 and b =7. Got that.\n\nNow, for the horizontal asymptote. I remember that the horizontal asymptote for a rational function depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. If the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. If the numerator's degree is less than the denominator's, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If it's higher, there's no horizontal asymptote, but instead an oblique or slant asymptote.\n\nLet's check the degrees here. The numerator is 2x, which is degree 1. The denominator is x² -5x -14, which is degree 2. So, the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator. That means the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If the numerator's"

            "output": " degree is less, horizontal asymptote is y=0, correct. But maybe I should double-check by dividing numerator and denominator by the highest power of x, which is x².\n\nSo, f(x) = (2x)/(x² -5x -14). Let's divide numerator and denominator by x².\n\nNumerator: 2x / x² = 2/x.\n\nDenominator: (x² -5x -14)/x² = 1 -5/x -14/x².\n\nSo, as x approaches infinity, 2/x approaches 0, and the denominator approaches 1. Therefore, f(x) approaches 0. So, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Yep, that confirms it.\n\nSo, a = -2, b =7, and c=0. Now, let's compute a + b + c.\n\n-2 + 7 + 0 = 5. So, the sum is 5.\n\nI think that's all. Let me just recap:\n\n- Vertical asymptotes are found by setting the denominator equal to zero and factoring: x = -2 and x =7.\n\n- Horizontal asymptote: since the degree of numerator is less than the denominator, it's y=0.\n\n- Adding them together: -2 +7+0=5.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determine the vertical asymptotes by setting the denominator equal to zero and factoring. The denominator factors into (x + 2)(x - 7), giving vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x = 7. For the horizontal asymptote, since the numerator's degree (1) is less than the denominator's degree (2), the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Adding these values together: -2 + 7 + 0 equals 5.\n\n\\boxed{5}"
