            "output": "First, I need to find the perimeter of the regular hexagon. The hexagon has 6 sides, each with a length of 16 cm.\n\nI'll calculate the perimeter by multiplying the number of sides by the length of one side:\nPerimeter of hexagon = 6 sides × 16 cm/side = 96 cm.\n\nSince the regular octagon has the same perimeter, its perimeter is also 96 cm.\n\nNext, I'll determine the number of sides on the octagon. A regular octagon has 8 sides.\n\nTo find the length of one side of the octagon, I'll divide the total perimeter by the number of sides:\nLength of each side of octagon = 96 cm / 8 sides = 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   - The hexagon has **6 sides**, each with a length of **16 cm**.\n   - Perimeter of the hexagon = Number of sides × Length of one side\n   - Perimeter = 6 × 16 cm = **96 cm**\n\n2. **Determine the Perimeter of the Octagon:**\n   - Since the regular octagon has the **same** perimeter as the hexagon, it is also **96 cm**.\n\n3. **Find the Length of Each Side of the Octagon:**\n   - The octagon has **8 sides**.\n   - Let \\( L \\) be the length of one side of the octagon.\n   - Perimeter of the octagon = Number of sides × Length of one side\n   - 96 cm = 8 × \\( L \\)\n   - To find \\( L \\), divide both sides by 8:\n   - \\( L = \\frac{96}{8} = **12 cm** \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12 \\text{ cm}}\n\\]"
