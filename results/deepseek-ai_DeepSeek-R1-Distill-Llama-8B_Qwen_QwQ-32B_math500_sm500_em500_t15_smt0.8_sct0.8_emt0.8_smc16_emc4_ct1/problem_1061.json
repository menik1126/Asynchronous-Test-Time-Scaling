            "output": "First, I need to find the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, I can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by the number of sides, which is 6.\n\nNext, I know that a regular octagon also has equal sides. To find the length of each side of the octagon, I need to set its perimeter equal to the perimeter of the hexagon.\n\nFor the octagon, I'll let \\( s \\) represent the length of one side. Since it has 8 sides, the perimeter is \\( 8s \\).\n\nFinally, I can set up the equation \\( 8s = 6 \\times 16 \\) and solve for \\( s \\) to find the length of each side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- A regular hexagon with a side length of **16 cm**.\n- The perimeter of the regular octagon is equal to the perimeter of the hexagon.\n\n**To Find:**\n- The side length of the regular octagon.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon**\n\nA regular hexagon has **6 equal sides**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = \\text{Number of sides} \\times \\text{Side length} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Equation for the Octagon's Perimeter**\n\nA regular octagon has **8 equal sides**.
