I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me recall what that is.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, expressed in the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1 (since the \\(x^4\\) term has a coefficient of 1). So, the possible rational roots are just the factors of -14. That would be \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). \n\nAlright, so I should test each of these to see if they satisfy the equation. Maybe I can start by plugging in some of these values and see if the equation equals zero.\n\nLet me start with \\(x = 1\\). Plugging into the equation:\n\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\). That's \\(1 + 5 + 9 - 1 -14 = 1 +5=6, 6+9=15, 15-1=14, 14-14=0\\). Oh, so 1 is a root! Nice.\n\nNow, since \\(x=1\\) is a root, I can factor the polynomial by dividing it by \\((x - 1)\\). But wait, since I'm looking for integer roots, maybe I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division. Let me try synthetic division because it's quicker.\n\nSetting up synthetic division with root \\(x=1\\):\n\n1 | 1   5   9   -1   -14\n     |     1   6   15   14\n     -------------------------\n     1   6   15   14   0\n\nSo the quotient polynomial is \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x +14\\). Now, I need to factor this cubic polynomial to find more roots.\n\nAgain, using the Rational Root Theorem on this cubic. The constant term"

            "output": " is 14, leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). Let me test these.\n\nTesting \\(x = -1\\):\n\n\\((-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 15(-1) +14\\). That's \\(-1 + 6 -15 +14 = (-1 +6)=5, (5 -15)=-10, (-10 +14)=4\\). Not zero.\n\nTesting \\(x = -2\\):\n\n\\((-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 15(-2) +14\\). That's \\(-8 + 24 -30 +14\\). Calculating: (-8 +24)=16, (16 -30)=-14, (-14 +14)=0. So, \\(x = -2\\) is a root.\n\nGreat, now I can factor out \\((x + 2)\\) from the cubic. Let's do synthetic division again.\n\n-2 | 1   6   15   14\n     |     -2   -8   -14\n     --------------------\n     1   4    7    0\n\nSo, the new quotient polynomial is \\(x^2 + 4x + 7\\). Now, I can try to factor this quadratic, or use quadratic formula.\n\nTrying to factor \\(x^2 + 4x + 7\\). Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to 7 and add to 4. 7 is a prime number, so the factors are 1 and 7. 1 + 7 = 8, which is not 4. So, it doesn't factor nicely over integers. Therefore, the quadratic doesn't have real roots, let alone integer ones.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original equation factors into \\((x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7) = 0\\). The integer roots are \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\). The quadratic factor doesn't contribute any more integer roots.\n\nWait a second, should I double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes? Let me re-calculate the synthetic divisions.\n\nFor the first synthetic division with \\(x = 1\\):\n\n1"

Each step subtracts 2 from 6 to get 4, then subtracts 2 from 15 is 13, but wait, actually, -2 times 4 is -8, so 15 -8 is 7, and then 14 -14 is 0. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I did everything right. Therefore, the only integer roots are 1 and -2.\n\nWait, hold on, let me plug in 7 into the original equation to make sure I didn't skip something.\n\nPlugging \\(x = 7\\): \\(7^4 +5*7^3 +9*7^2 -7 -14\\).\n\nCalculating:\n\n7^4 is 2401.\n\n5*7^3 = 5*343 = 1715.\n\n9*7^2 = 9*49 = 441.\n\nSo adding up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116. 4116 + 441 = 4557. Then subtract 7: 4557 -7 = 4550. Subtract 14: 4550 -14 = 4536. Not zero, so 7 is not a root.\n\nSimilarly, let me check \\(x = -7\\):\n\n(-7)^4 +5*(-7)^3 +9*(-7)^2 -(-7) -14.\n\nThat's 2401 +5*(-343) +9*49 +7 -14.\n\nCalculates to: 2401 - 1715 + 441 +7 -14.\n\n2401 -1715 = 686.\n\n686 +441 = 1127.\n\n1127 +7 =1134.\n\n1134 -14=1120. Not zero. So, -7 isn't a root either.\n\nHow about 14? That"

So, 1 and -2 are the only integer roots.\n</think>\n\nThe equation \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\) can be solved by testing possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.
