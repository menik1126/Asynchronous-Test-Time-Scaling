            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). The task is to find all the integer roots. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomial equations, integer roots are factors of the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible integer roots are the factors of -14, which are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. That gives me a list to test.\n\nNow, I can use the Rational Root Theorem, which tells us that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. Since the leading coefficient is 1, all rational roots are integers, specifically the factors of -14. So, I only need to test these integer values.\n\nLet me list them out again: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. I should test each of these in the equation to see if they satisfy it, meaning when plugged into the polynomial, the result is zero.\n\nLet me start with x = 1:\n\nPlugging x = 1 into the equation:\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 is 6, 6 + 9 is 15, 15 - 1 is 14, 14 -14 is 0. So, 0! That means x = 1 is a root. Great, so (x - 1) is a factor.\n\nNow, since it's a quartic equation, there might be up to four roots, but since we're only looking for integer roots, maybe only some of these will work. Let me test the next number: x = -1.\n\nPlugging x = -1:\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) -14 = 1 -5 + 9 +1 -14 = 1 -5 is -4, -4 +9 is 5, 5 +1 is 6,"

Let me do step by step:\n\n16 + 40 = 56, 56 + 36 = 92, 92 -2 = 90, 90 -14 = 76. That's not zero. So x = 2 is not a root.\n\nWait, maybe I did the arithmetic quickly and made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\n2^4 is 16, 5*(2)^3 is 5*8=40, 9*(2)^2 is 9*4=36. So 16+40=56, 56+36=92. Then subtract 2: 92-2=90, subtract 14: 90-14=76. Yeah, 76. Not zero. So x=2 is not a root.\n\nNext, x = -2:\n\nCalculate:\n\\((-2)^4 +5(-2)^3 +9(-2)^2 -(-2) -14\\). Let's compute each term:\n\n(-2)^4 = 16, 5*(-2)^3 = 5*(-8) = -40, 9*(-2)^2 = 9*4 = 36. So, 16 -40 +36 +2 -14.\n\n16 -40 is -24, -24 +36 is 12, 12 +2 is 14, 14 -14 is 0. Oh! That works. So x = -2 is another root.\n\nSo far, we have x=1 and x=-2 as integer roots. Let me note that.\n\nNow, moving on to x=7.\n\nThat might be a bit large, but let's try:\n\nCalculate:\n\\(7^4 +5(7)^3 +9(7)^2 -7 -14\\).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n7^4 = 7*7*7*7=49*49=2401\n\n5*(7)^3 = 5*343 = 1715\n\n9*(7)^2 = 9*49 = 441\n\nSo, 2401 + 1715 + 441 -7 -"

Wait, no, 38416 -13720.\n\nWait, better to compute step by step:\n\n38416 minus 13720: subtract 13000 from 38416, which gives 25416, then subtract 720, which gives 25416 -720=24796.\n\nThen add 1764: 24796 +1764.\n\n24796 +1000=25796, +700=26496, +64=26560.\n\nThen add 14: 26560 +14=26574.\n\nThen subtract 14: 26574 -14=26560.\n\nSo, total is 26560, not zero. So x=-14 is not a root.\n\nOkay, so among all the possible integer roots, only x=1 and x=-2 satisfy the equation.\n\nBut wait, the equation is a quartic (degree 4), so there should be four roots in total, but they might not all be integers. So, perhaps after factoring out the known roots, we can factor the quartic into quadratics or cubics and find other roots. However, since the question is only about integer roots, maybe just 1 and -2 are the integer roots.\n\nTo confirm, I can perform polynomial division. Let me factor the quartic by dividing it by (x - 1) and (x + 2).\n\nFirst, let me divide the polynomial by (x - 1). I can use synthetic division.\n\nSet up synthetic division with root 1:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 1: 1, add to next coefficient: 5+1=6.\n\nMultiply 6 by 1=6, add to next:"

Perfect, so the result is:\n\n\\(x^3 + 6x^2 +15x +14\\).\n\nSo, now the quartic is (x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic. Let me try to factor it. Maybe it has an integer root.\n\nPossible roots again are factors of 14, same as before: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nTest x=-2 in the cubic:\n\n(-2)^3 +6*(-2)^2 +15*(-2) +14= -8 +24 -30 +14.\n\nCompute: -8 +24=16, 16 -30=-14, -14 +14=0.\n\nSo, x=-2 is a root again. Therefore, (x +2) is a factor.\n\nSo, perform synthetic division on the cubic:\n\nCubic: 1, 6, 15, 14.\n\nRoot: -2.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2, add to next coefficient:6 + (-2)=4.\n\nMultiply 4 by -2=-8, add to next:15 + (-8)=7.\n\nMultiply 7 by -2=-14, add to last:14 + (-14)=0.\n\nSo, the cubic factors into (x +2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nThus, the original quartic factors into (x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, the quadratic factor is x^2 +4x +7.\n\nTo find other roots, solve x^2 +4x +7=0.\n\nUse quadratic formula: x = [-4 ±√(16 -28)]/2 = [-4 ±√(-12)]/2, which are complex numbers. So, no real roots from the quadratic, hence no integer roots.\n\nTherefore, the only integer roots of the original equation are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I made any miscalculations.\n\nI tested all possible candidates, and only 1 and -2 worked.
