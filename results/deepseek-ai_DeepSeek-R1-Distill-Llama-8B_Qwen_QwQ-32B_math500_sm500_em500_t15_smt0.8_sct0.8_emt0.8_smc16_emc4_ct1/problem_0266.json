            "output": "First, I need to understand the relationships between the different types of currency in the land of Ink. \n\nI see that 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, which means each Blinket is worth less than a Trinket. \n\nNext, there's the relationship between Blinkets and Drinkets: 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets. This tells me that each Drinket has a lower value than a Blinket.\n\nTo find out how much 56 Drinkets are worth in Trinkets, I'll start by converting Drinkets to Blinkets using the given exchange rate. \n\nSince 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, 1 Drinket is equivalent to 3/7 of a Blinket. Therefore, 56 Drinkets would be 56 multiplied by 3/7 Blinkets, which equals 24 Blinkets.\n\nNow that I have the equivalent value in Blinkets, I'll convert Blinkets to Trinkets. Given that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, I can divide the number of Blinkets by 4 to get the value in Trinkets. \n\nDividing 24 Blinkets by 4 gives me 6 Trinkets. \n\nSo, 56 Drinkets are worth 6 Trinkets in the land of Ink.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, we need to follow the exchange rates step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the exchange rates:**\n   - **Trinket (T) to Blinket (B):** \\( 1T = 4B \\)\n   - **Blinket (B) to Drinket (D):** \\( 3B = 7D \\)\n\n2. **Express Drinkets in terms of Blinkets:**\n   - Starting with \\( 3B = 7D \\), we can find the value of 1 Drinket in Blinkets:\n     \\[\n     1D = \\frac{3B}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}B\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( 56D = 56 \\times \\frac{3}{7}B = 24B \\)\n\n3. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:**\n   - Since \\( 1T = 4B \\), we can find the value of 1 Blinket in Trinkets:\n     \\[\n     "
