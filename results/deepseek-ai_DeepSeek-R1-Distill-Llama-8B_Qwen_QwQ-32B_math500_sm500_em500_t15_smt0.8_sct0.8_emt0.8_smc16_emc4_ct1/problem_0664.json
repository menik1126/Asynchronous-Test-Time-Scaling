So, 2T + G = S.\n\nI can express 1 goolee as S - 2T.\n\nNow, substitute S - 2T for G in the first equation.\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)  \n10T = 4S - 2T  \n12T = 4S  \n3T = S\n\nThis shows that the weight of one squig (S) is equal to the weight of 3 treeks (T).\n\nTherefore, 3 treeks weigh the same as one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n2.
