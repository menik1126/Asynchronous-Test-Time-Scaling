So, \\(x = 1\\) is not a solution.\n\nNext, I'll try \\(x = 2\\):\n\\[\ny = 3^2 = 9 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z = 10^2 = 100\n\\]\nPlugging these in: \\(9^2 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100\\), which equals \\(z\\). Therefore, \\(x = 2\\) is a solution.\n\nFinally, I'll check if there are any other possible solutions by examining the behavior of the functions \\(y^2 + 19\\) and \\(z\\). As \\(x\\) increases beyond 2, \\(z\\) grows much faster than \\(y^2 + 19\\), so no other solutions exist.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are tasked with solving the equation:\n\\[\n3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Simplify the equation using substitution.\n\nLet’s define:\n\\[\ny = 3^x \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z = 10^x\n\\]\nThe equation becomes:\n\\[\ny^2 + 19 = z\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Analyze possible integer solutions.\n\nWe can test small integer values of \\(x\\).\n\n- **Case \\(x = 1"
