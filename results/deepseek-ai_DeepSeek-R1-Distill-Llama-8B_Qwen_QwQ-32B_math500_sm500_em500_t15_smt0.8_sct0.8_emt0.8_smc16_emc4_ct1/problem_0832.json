Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the expression looks like. The numerator is \\(x - y\\), which is a linear expression, and the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\), which is a quartic polynomial. So, we have a rational function where both the numerator and denominator are functions of two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). My goal is to find the maximum value of this function over all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nSince both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are variables, I might need to use calculus, specifically partial derivatives, to find the critical points where the function could attain its maximum. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to simplify or transform the problem using algebraic manipulations or inequalities. Let me think about both approaches.\n\nLet me first consider trying to rewrite the expression or find some substitution that can make it easier. Let me denote \\(A = x - y\\), but I'm not sure if that helps yet. The denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\). Hmm, quartic terms can be tricky, but perhaps I can use some inequality to bound the denominator.\n\nI know that for any real number \\(z\\), \\(z^4\\) is always non-negative, so \\(x^4 + y^4 \\geq 0\\). Therefore, the denominator \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6 \\geq 6\\). So, the denominator is always at least 6, which means the expression is at least \\(\\frac{x - y}{6}\\). But that doesn't directly help because \\(x - y\\) can be positive or negative, and we're looking for the maximum value, so we need to maximize \\(x - y\\) while keeping the denominator as small as possible.\n\nWait, so to maximize the expression, we need both \\(x - y\\) to be as large as possible and the denominator to be as small as possible. So, perhaps we can consider when \\(x - y\\) is maximized relative to the denominator.\n\nGiven that the denominator is \\(x^4 + y^4 + "

However, if \\(x = y = 0\\), then the numerator is 0, so the expression is 0. But maybe there's a point where \\(x - y\\) is positive and the denominator isn't too large?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use some substitution to reduce the number of variables. Let me think: perhaps set \\(u = x - y\\), and then express the denominator in terms of \\(u\\) and another variable. But I'm not sure if that's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set \\(y = tx\\), so that we can express everything in terms of a single variable. Let me try that substitution. Let me let \\(y = tx\\), where \\(t\\) is a real number. Then, the numerator becomes \\(x - tx = x(1 - t)\\), and the denominator becomes \\(x^4 + (tx)^4 + 6 = x^4(1 + t^4) + 6\\).

Not easy to solve, but perhaps has real roots.\n\nUsing numerical methods, let's see:\n\nAt x=1: -3 +4 +7=8>0,\n\nAt x=2: -48 +32 +7=-9<0,\n\nThus, there is a root between 1 and 2.\n\nSimilarly, at x=1.5:\n\n-3*(5.0625) +4*(3.375) +7= -15.1875 +13.5 +7≈5.3125>0,\n\nAt x=1.75:\n\n-3*(1.75)^4 +4*(1.75)^3 +7.\n\nCompute 1.75^2=3.0625,\n\n1.75^3≈5.359,\n\n1.75^4≈9.378.\n\nSo,\n\n-3*9.378 +4*5.359 +7≈-28.134 +21.436 +7≈0.302>0.\n\nAt x=1.8:\n\n1.8^4= (1.8^2)^2=3.24^2≈10.4976,\n\n1.8^3≈5.832,\n\nSo,\n\n-3*10.4976 +4*5.832 +7≈-31.4928 +23.328 +7≈-1.1648<0.\n\nSo, root between 1.75 and 1.8.\n\nThus, f(x) at this x would be positive, but let me compute f(1.75):\n\nf(1.75)= (1.75 -1)/(1.75^4 +7)=0.75/(9.378+7)=0.75/16.378"
