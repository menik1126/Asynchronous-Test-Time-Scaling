            "output": "First, I recognize that the problem involves circular permutations because the table is square, meaning rotational symmetry should be considered.\n\nSince the table is square, it has four sides, and we need to seat 8 people with 2 people on each side. This means each side will have exactly 2 seats.\n\nI'll start by arranging the 8 people in a line, which can be done in 8! ways.\n\nNext, because the table is circular, I need to account for rotational symmetry. In circular permutations, we divide by the number of seats to eliminate equivalent rotations, so I'll divide by 8.\n\nHowever, since the table is square and each side has the same number of people, I need to consider additional symmetries. A square has 4 sides, so I should divide by 4 to account for rotational symmetry between the sides.\n\nFinally, I should consider if there are any reflections that make configurations equivalent. Since the problem only mentions rotations, reflections don't need to be accounted for.\n\nPutting it all together, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is (8! / (8 × 4)) which simplifies to 8! / 32.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways 8 people can be seated around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotational symmetry:\n\n1. **Linear Arrangement**: Start by arranging all 8 people in a straight line. This can be done in \\(8!\\) ways.\n\n2. **Circular Arrangement**: Since the table is circular, rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical. To account for this, divide by the number of seats, which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8!}{8} = 7!\n   \\]\n\n3. **Square Symmetry**: The table is square, meaning it has rotational symmetry every \\( \\frac{360^\\circ}{4} = 90^\\circ \\). Therefore, we need to divide by 4 to account for these additional rotations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7!}{4}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7!}{4} = \\frac{5040}{4} = 1260\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{1260}\\)"
