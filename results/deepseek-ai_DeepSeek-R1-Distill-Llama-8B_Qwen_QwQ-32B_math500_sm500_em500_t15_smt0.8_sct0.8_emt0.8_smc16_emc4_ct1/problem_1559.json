And the thing is, rotations of the same arrangement are considered equivalent, so I don't want to count those multiple times. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, seating arrangements around a table usually involve circular permutations. For a circular table with n people, the number of ways is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But wait, this is a square table, not a circular one. So it might be a bit different. A square has four sides, each needing 2 people. So, it's like a square with 8 seats, 2 on each side.\n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine a square table where each side has 2 chairs. So, each corner is shared by two sides, right? That means each chair is part of two sides. Wait, actually, no. Each side has two chairs, but the corners themselves are where the sides meet, so each corner is a single chair that's part of two sides. So, in total, how many chairs are there? Let's see, each side has 2 chairs, but four sides would have 8, but that counts the corners twice because each corner is shared by two sides. Wait, that can't be right. No, actually, if each side has 2 chairs, including the corners, then each corner is counted once for each side. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the table as having four sides, each with two chairs. So, that's 4 sides × 2 chairs = 8 chairs in total. Yes, that makes sense. So, the table has 8 chairs arranged in a square, 2 on each side. So, the chairs are placed such that each corner has a chair, and each side between the corners has another chair. So, chair positions would be: North, Northeast, Northwest; East, Southeast, Southwest; South, Southwest, Southeast; West, Northwest, Northeast. Wait, no, that's not quite right because each side has two chairs. Let me think again.\n\nMaybe the square table has 8 chairs, 2 on each side, equally spaced. So each side has 2 chairs, making the total 8 chairs, with each"

Wait, perhaps each side has two chairs, one at each end (the corners) and one in the middle? But that would be three chairs per side, which is too many. Hmm, maybe the problem states that each side has exactly two people, so each side has two chairs. Therefore, the total number of chairs is 8, arranged so that each side of the square has two chairs. So, the corners must be chairs, and each side has one chair between the corners? Wait, that would be three chairs per side. Hmm, maybe the problem is that each side has two chairs, so the corners are not chairs? That can't be, because then the sides would have two chairs each, but the corners would be between sides. Maybe the problem is that each side has two seats, so the total is 8, arranged in a square with two seats per side. So, each side has two seats, so between each corner, there are two seats. Wait, perhaps the table is a square with four sides, each side having two seats, so the total is 8 seats. So, each side is divided into two seats, so between two corners, there are two seats. So, the corners themselves are not seats, but the sides have two seats each. That would make sense. So, the table has 8 seats arranged in a square, with two seats on each side, not including the corners. So, each side has two seats, and the corners are just the corners of the table but not seats. So, the seats are placed along the sides, two per side. \n\nOkay, so now, the problem is to seat 8 people around this table, with two people per side, and considering rotations as the same. So, how do we count the number of distinct seating arrangements?\n\nFirst, in circular permutations, when arranging people around a circular table, we fix one person's position to account for rotations. But here, the table is square, so the rotational symmetry is different. A square has rotational symmetry of order 4, meaning rotating by 90 degrees, 180, 270, and 360 (which is the same as 0). So, if we rotate the table by 90 degrees, the configuration would be considered the same."

Let's think about the table. If we fix one seat as a reference point, then the rest can be arranged relative to that. But since rotations are considered the same, we need to fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\nSo, in a circular table, we fix one person and arrange the rest relative to them, which gives (n-1)! arrangements. But for a square table, the number of rotational symmetries is 4. So, perhaps we can divide by 4? But wait, that might not be accurate because fixing one person already accounts for rotations.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. If we fix one person's seat, then the remaining people can be arranged in 7! ways. But since the table is square, even after fixing one person, we might still have rotational symmetries that make some arrangements equivalent. So, maybe fixing one person only accounts for 90-degree rotations, but since we've fixed one position, perhaps we don't need to divide by the number of symmetries.\n\nHmm, maybe I should model this as a circular arrangement with 8 seats, but each rotation by 90 degrees is considered equivalent. So, the number of distinct arrangements would be the number of linear arrangements divided by 4. But wait, in circular permutations, when we fix one position, we don't divide by the number of seats, but by the number of symmetries. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a problem of seating people around a square table with two people on each side, considering rotations as identical. So, perhaps I can model this as arranging 8 people in a circle, but with the additional constraint that the seating is in blocks of two on each side of the square. So, each side has two people, and the arrangement must follow the square's structure.\n\nWait, but the square imposes a specific cyclic order. So, maybe the number of distinct arrangements is similar to arranging 8 people in a circle, but divided by 4 because of the rotational symmetries of the square.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a circular permutation where the table's rotational symmetry is considered.

But since the square table has rotational symmetry of order 4 (rotations by 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360°), then the number of distinct arrangements would be 5040 divided by 4, which is 1260. But is that correct?\n\nWait, but maybe the square table has more symmetries? Like reflections? The problem says that configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. It doesn't mention reflections. So, reflections would count as different. So, only rotations are considered equivalent. Therefore, the symmetry group is the cyclic group of order 4, so the number of distinct arrangements is total arrangements divided by 4.\n\nBut hold on, in circular permutations, when considering rotations, the formula is (n-1)! because fixing one person's position accounts for the rotations. But here, if we have a square table, perhaps the same idea applies. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. Let's say we fix person A at a specific seat. Then, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. Since we fixed one seat, rotations are accounted for, so the total number would be 7!.\n\nWait, but that would be 5040. But if the table is square, maybe there are more constraints? Because the sides have two people each. Wait, actually, the problem states that the table has two people on a side, so the seating must be such that each side has exactly two people. But if we fix one person's seat, then the rest can be arranged in any way, but the sides must have two each. Wait, but actually, the problem is just about seating 8 people around the table with two per side, so the seats are already arranged in the square with two per side. So, the seats are fixed in their positions, so the only thing that matters is the assignment of people to seats, considering rotations as equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the seats are indistinct except for their positions relative to each other. Hmm, perhaps the key is that the table's rotational symmetry allows us to rotate the entire table, so two seatings are the same if you can rotate one to get the other.

So, we divide by 4, giving 40320 / 4 = 10080.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought about fixing one seat, giving 7! = 5040. Which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I confused two different approaches. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn circular permutations, when all seats are identical except for their positions relative to each other, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. But in this case, the table is square, so it's a specific kind of circular table with rotational symmetries. So, perhaps the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! divided by the number of symmetries that remain after fixing one seat.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, in this problem, the rotational symmetries that make arrangements equivalent are the 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360° rotations. So, in total, 4 rotational symmetries.\n\nTherefore, when considering circular arrangements where rotations by 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360° are equivalent, the number of distinct arrangements is the total permutations divided by 4.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements without considering rotation is 8! = 40320.

Since we fixed one seat, we've already accounted for one rotation, so the total number of distinct arrangements would be 7! = 5040. So, which is it?\n\nWait, I'm getting two different answers: 10080 and 5040. Which is correct?\n\nI think the key is to understand whether fixing one seat automatically accounts for all rotational symmetries or not. In circular permutations, fixing one seat removes the rotational symmetry, so you don't need to divide by the number of symmetries again. So, if I fix one seat, then the number of distinct"

Therefore, the answer would be 7!.\n\nBut why the discrepancy with the other approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in a square table, fixing a seat doesn't account for all symmetries because the square has more structure. Wait, no. Fixing a seat would mean that rotations that move that seat to another position are considered different. Wait, actually, if you fix a specific seat, then you are effectively choosing a reference point, so rotations that move that seat would not be considered equivalent. Therefore, fixing a seat would eliminate rotational symmetry, so the total number is 7!.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't fix a seat, then the total number is 8! divided by the number of rotations (4), so 8!/4 = 40320/4 = 10080. But which is the correct approach?\n\nHmm, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the seats are labeled or not. If the seats are labeled (i.e., distinguishable), then rotations would produce different arrangements, so the answer would be 8!.\n\nBut the problem states that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. So, the seats are not labeled, and rotations are considered the same. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 8! divided by the number of rotational symmetries (4), so 8!/4 = 10080.\n\nHowever, in circular tables, the standard formula is (n-1)! because fixing one person's position accounts for rotations. So, in that case, it's equivalent to dividing by n. But here, the rotational symmetry is of order 4, so dividing by 4 instead of 8. Wait, but the number of rotational symmetries for a square is 4 (rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). So, the group of rotations has order 4, so the number of distinct arrangements is total arrangements divided by the size of the group, so 8! /4.\n\nBut in the circular table case, the rotational group has order n (since rotating by"

So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps both are correct, but in different contexts. If the seats are labeled, then the number is 8!. If the seats are unlabeled and we consider rotations as equivalent, then it's 8! /4. Similarly, fixing one seat gives (8-1)! = 5040, which is another way of accounting for rotations.\n\nWait, but (8-1)! is 5040, and 8! /4 is also 10080.

In the 4-seat case, the rotational symmetry group is of order 4, so dividing by 4 gives the correct result. But in the 8-seat case, the rotational symmetry group is still of order 4, because the table is square. So, the number of rotational symmetries is still 4, so dividing by 4 is correct.

Therefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements is 8! /4.\n\nAlternatively, if we fix one seat, then the rotational symmetries that fix that seat are only 180° and 360°, so the number of rotational symmetries is reduced. Wait, no, that's not correct. If we fix a specific seat, say seat 1 at position (1,1), then the only rotational symmetries that fix this seat are the identity rotation (0°) and 180° rotation if the table's center is at (0,0). Wait, but in a square table, rotating 180° would map seat 1 to itself if it's at a corner, wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose we fix seat 1 at position (1,1). Then, a rotation of 90° clockwise would move seat 1 to (1,1) rotated 90°, which would be (1,-1). So, the seat at (1,1) is not fixed under a 90° rotation unless it's at the center, which it's not. So, fixing seat 1's position would break the rotational symmetry except for 180° rotation if the seat is at the center, which it's not. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nIn any case, the standard approach in combinatorics for counting distinct arrangements under rotational symmetry is to use Burnside's lemma, which involves averaging the number of fixed points under each group action.\n\nBut perhaps that's beyond my current level.
