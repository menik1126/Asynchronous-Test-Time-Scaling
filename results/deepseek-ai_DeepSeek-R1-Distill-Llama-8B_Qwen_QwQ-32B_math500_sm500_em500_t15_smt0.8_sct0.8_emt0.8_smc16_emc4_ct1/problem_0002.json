That means the leading coefficient is 1. Monic is important because it tells us the highest degree term is \\( x^3 \\).\n\nThe problem says that \\( P(x) \\) has a remainder \\( R(x) \\) when it's divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\). So, if I perform polynomial division, or use the Remainder Theorem, I can express \\( P(x) \\) in terms of this divisor and \\( R(x) \\).\n\nSimilarly, the problem states that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). So, this gives me another equation.\n\nWe are also given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall the Remainder Factor Theorem. It says that if a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by a linear divisor \\( (x - a) \\), the remainder is \\( P(a) \\). But here, we have quadratic divisors, so the remainder will be of lower degree. Since \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder when divided by a quadratic, \\( R(x) \\) must be a linear polynomial, right? So, \\( R(x) = ax + b \\) for some constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nGiven that, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), we can write:\n\n\\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \\)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\):\n\n\\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\)\n\nWhere \\( Q_1(x) \\) and \\( Q_2(x) ) are the quotient polynomials.\n\nSince \\( P(x) \\) is cubic (degree 3) and each divisor is quadratic (degree 2), the quotient polynomials \\( Q_"

Since it's monic, the leading coefficient is 1.\n\nBut since I have values at x=0,1,2,3,4, maybe I can set up a system of equations.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the differences. Since we have these equations involving P(1), P(4), P(2), and P(3), maybe I can find a linear combination that allows me to solve for a and b.\n\nWait, but also, P is a cubic polynomial. So, if I know four points, but it's only four points, it might not be sufficient. Hmm, wait, but actually, P is expressed in terms of R(x) and quadratics. So, maybe we can express everything in terms of R(x).\n\nWait, since \\( R(x) \\) is linear, perhaps I can write P(x) as \\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)(something) + R(x) \\). But since P is cubic and the divisor is quadratic, the something must be linear. So, P(x) = (x -1)(x -4)(m x + n) + R(x). Similarly, when divided by (x -2)(x -3), P(x) = (x -2)(x -3)(p x + q) + 2R(x)\n\nBut perhaps another way is to consider that P(x) - R(x) is divisible by (x -1)(x -4). Similarly, P(x) - 2R(x) is divisible by (x -2)(x -3). Therefore, if I denote:\n\nLet me define \\( S(x) = P(x) - R(x) \\). Then, S(x) is divisible by (x -1)(x -4). Similarly, define another polynomial \\( T(x) = P(x) - 2R(x) \\), which is divisible by (x -2)(x -3).\n\nSo S(x) = (x -1)(x -4) A(x), where A(x) is a linear polynomial since S(x) is cubic minus linear, which is still cubic, but the divisor is quadratic, so A(x) is linear.\n\nSimilarly, T(x) = (x -2)(x -3) B(x), where B(x) is linear.\n\nSo, S(x) is cubic, so A(x"

Similarly, B(x) = px + q, so T(x) = (x -2)(x -3)(p x + q).\n\nBut since S(x) = P(x) - R(x) and T(x) = P(x) - 2R(x), then:\n\nS(x) - T(x) = (P(x) - R(x)) - (P(x) - 2R(x)) = R(x)\n\nTherefore, R(x) = S(x) - T(x) = (x -1)(x -4)(k x + m) - (x -2)(x -3)(p x + q)\n\nHmm, but this might complicate things. Maybe this approach is getting too involved. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since P(x) is a cubic, and we have four equations (from the four points x=1,2,3,4 and x=0), perhaps we can set up equations for the coefficients of P(x).\n\nLet me write P(x) as \\( x^3 + c x^2 + d x + e \\). Since it's monic, the leading term is 1. Then, we can use the given conditions to set up equations for c, d, e.\n\nWe know P(0) = e = 5. So that's one equation: e = 5.\n\nNow, let's write equations for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4). But these are related to R(x). Let me see.\n\nFrom the first division, P(1) = R(1) = a + b, and P(4) = R(4) = 4a + b.\n\nFrom the second division, P(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(2a + b) = 4a + 2b, and P(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(3a + b) = 6a + 2b.\n\nSo, if I can express P(1"
