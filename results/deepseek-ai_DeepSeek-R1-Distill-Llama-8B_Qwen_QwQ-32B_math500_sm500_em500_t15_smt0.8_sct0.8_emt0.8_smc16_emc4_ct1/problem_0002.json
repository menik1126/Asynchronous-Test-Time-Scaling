            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about polynomials. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The problem says:\n\nLet \\( P(x) \\) be a monic polynomial of degree 3. Suppose that \\( P(x) \\) has remainder \\( R(x) \\) when it's divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), and it has a remainder of \\( 2R(x) \\) when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\). Also, we're given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\). We need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nHmm, okay, so \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, meaning it's of the form \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) since it's monic (leading coefficient is 1). The problem mentions remainders when divided by two quadratic polynomials: \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) and \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\). So, when you divide a cubic polynomial by a quadratic, the remainder should be linear, right? So \\( R(x) \\) must be a linear polynomial, like \\( dx + e \\).\n\nWait, let me confirm that. If you divide a cubic \\( P(x) \\) by a quadratic \\( (x - a)(x - b) \\), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) will have a degree less than 2, so yes, linear or constant. But in this problem, they specify the remainder as \\( R(x) \\), so it must be linear.\n\nSo, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) = dx + e \\). Similarly, when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) = 2dx + 2e \\).\n\nGiven that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), maybe we can find some relationships using this information.\n\nLet me recall the Remainder Theorem. It says that if you divide a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) by \\( (x - c) \\), the remainder is \\( P(c) \\). But here, we're dealing with quadratic divisors, so it's a"

So, each pair of roots corresponds to different divisors, and the Chinese Remainder Theorem says that the remainder modulo each divisor can be considered separately and then combined.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the remainder when divided by each quadratic is given, so perhaps we can write \\( P(x) \\) in terms of these remainders. Let me think about how to express \\( P(x) \\) when divided by these quadratics.\n\nSo, if \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), we can write \\( P(x) = Q_1(x)(x - 1)(x - 4) + R(x) \\), where \\( Q_1(x) \\) is a linear polynomial since \\( P(x) \\) is cubic and the divisor is quadratic. Similarly, \\( P(x) = Q_2(x)(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2R(x) \\).\n\nWait, but \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic. Let me check: if \\( P(x) \\) is divided by a quadratic, the quotient \\( Q(x) \\) must be linear, so degree 1. So, \\( Q_1(x) \\) is degree 1 and \\( Q_2(x) \\) is also degree 1.\n\nHmm, maybe we can set up two equations based on these expressions and then find \\( R(x) \\) and \\( P(x) \\). But since \\( P(x) \\) is cubic, and the coefficients are to be determined, perhaps we can express \\( P(x) \\) in terms of \\( R(x) \\) and then compare coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to evaluate \\( P(x) \\) at the roots of these divisors. Since \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) = 0 \\) when \\( x = 1 \\) or \\( x = 4 \\), and similarly, \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \\) when \\( x = 2 \\) or \\( x = 3 \\), maybe we can plug in these values into \\( P(x) \\)"

Since it's monic, the leading coefficient is 1. We also know that \\( P(0) = c = 5 \\). So, c is 5.
