            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, at first glance, it looks a bit tricky because there are exponentials with different bases on both sides. I need to figure out a way to simplify this or find a substitution that makes it easier to solve for x. Let me think about the properties of exponents and see if I can manipulate the equation somehow.\n\nFirst, I notice that 3^{2x} can be rewritten. Since 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, which simplifies to 9^x. So, I can rewrite the equation as 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That might make it easier to handle because now I have terms with the same exponent, but different bases. So the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x.\n\nNow, I have 9^x and 10^x. Maybe I can write both sides in terms of the same base or find a relationship between them. Let me think about taking logarithms because logarithms can sometimes help me solve equations with exponents. However, I have two exponentials here, so I'm not sure if that's the best approach yet.\n\nAnother idea is to let y = 10^x. Then, since 9^x is (9/10)^x multiplied by 10^x, I can express 9^x as y*(9/10)^x. Let me try that.\n\nLet y = 10^x. Then, 9^x = (9/10)^x * 10^x = y*(9/10)^x. Substituting back into the equation, I get y*(9/10)^x + 19 = y. Hmm, that might not immediately help because now I have a term with (9/10)^x, which is another exponential. Maybe I can rearrange the equation to isolate that term.\n\nSo, let's subtract y from both sides: y*(9/10)^x - y + 19 = 0. Hmm, but that doesn't seem very helpful. Maybe another approach would be better.\n\nLet me consider the function f(x) = 10^x - 9^x - 19. I want to find the value of x where f(x) = 0. To solve this"

That's negative.\n\nx = 1:\nf(1) = 10 - 9 -19 = (10-9) -19 = 1 -19 = -18. Still negative.\n\nx = 2:\nf(2) = 100 - 81 -19 = 100 - 100 = 0. Oh! Wait, that's exactly zero. So x=2 is a solution?\n\nWait, let me check that again. 10^2 is 100, 9^2 is 81. So 100 -81 = 19, and then subtract 19 gives 0. Yes, so f(2)=0. So x=2 is a solution.\n\nHmm, so that's one solution. But maybe there's another solution? Let me check x=3:\n\nf(3)=10^3 -9^3 -19 = 1000 -729 -19 = 1000 -748 = 252. That's positive. So between x=2 and x=3, the function goes from 0 to positive, so maybe there's another solution? Wait, but at x=2 it's already zero. Let me check x=1.5.\n\nWait, but let's see. Let me check x=1.5:\n\nFirst, 10^1.5 is 10^(3/2) = sqrt(10^3) = sqrt(1000) ≈ 31.623.\n\n9^1.5 = 9^(3/2) = sqrt(9^3) = sqrt(729) = 27.\n\nSo f(1.5) = 31.623 -27 -19 ≈ 31.623 -46 ≈ -14.377.

So the function is positive at x=4.\n\nWait, so from x=2 onwards, it's positive. So is x=2 the only solution?\n\nWait, but let's consider the behavior of the function f(x)=10^x -9^x -19.\n\nAs x approaches negative infinity:\n\n10^x approaches 0 (since 10^x=1/(10^(-x)) and as x approaches -infty, 10^x becomes 0)\nSimilarly, 9^x approaches 0.\n\nSo f(x) approaches 0 -0 -19 = -19.\n\nAt x=0, f(0)=1 -1 -19 = -19.\n\nAt x=2, f(2)=100 -81 -19=0.\n\nAnd as x increases beyond 2, f(x) increases.\n\nBut wait, what happens between x=2 and x=3?

Therefore, since f(x) is strictly increasing, and it crosses zero at x=2, that must be the only solution.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Since f(x) is strictly increasing, then once it crosses zero at x=2, it can't come back down. So there's only one solution at x=2.\n\nWait, but let me check x=1.5 again. At x=1.5, f(x) was negative, and at x=2 it's zero, so the function is increasing, so that's the only crossing point.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nBut let me check if there's another solution for x less than 2. Let's see, for x=1, f(1)= -18, x=0 is -19, and as x approaches negative infinity, it approaches -19. So the function is increasing from -19 upwards, but never reaches zero before x=2. So yes, x=2 is the only solution.\n\nWait, but let me test x=2 again to be sure.\n\n3^{2x} when x=2 is 3^4 =81, and 10^x is 100. So 81 +19 =100, which is exactly 100. So yes, that works.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x=2.\n\nHmm, but maybe I should check if there's another solution where x is negative? Let's see.\n\nSuppose x is negative, say x = -1.\n\nThen 3^{2"

Wait, that can't be because if f(x)=10^x -9^x -19, then at x=-1, it's 0.1 - (1/9) -19 ≈0.1 -0.1111 -19≈-19.0111, which is negative.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, at x=-1, 10^x is 10^{-1}=0.1, 9^x is (1/9)^{-2}? Wait, no, wait, 9^(-1)=1/9≈0.1111. So f(-1)=0.1 -0.1111 -19≈0.1 -0.1111= -0.0111 -19≈-19.0111, which is negative.\n\nSo f(-1) is negative.\n\nAt x=0, f(x)= -19.\n\nAt x=2, f(x)=0.\n\nSince the function is strictly increasing, and f(x) approaches -19 as x approaches negative infinity, but then it goes to +infty as x approaches positive infinity, but crosses zero only once at x=2.\n\nTherefore, there is only one solution at x=2.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought of negative x, I thought perhaps there could be another solution, but after calculating f(-1) it was negative, and at x=0 it's also negative, so it doesn't cross zero again on the negative side. So yeah, x=2 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, another way to check is to consider that 10^x is an exponential function that grows faster than 9^x because 10 >9, so as x increases, 10^x will dominate, making 10^x -9^x grow without bound. Since the function is strictly increasing, it can only cross zero once.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x=2.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step"
