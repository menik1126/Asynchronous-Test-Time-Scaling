            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, I know that 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, which simplifies to 9^x. So, I can rewrite the equation as 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That seems a bit simpler. Now, I have 9^x and 10^x on opposite sides of the equation.\n\nHmm, how do I solve for x here? Both sides are exponential functions with different bases, 9 and 10. Maybe I can try taking the natural logarithm of both sides? Wait, but before that, maybe I can manipulate the equation to make it easier.\n\nLet me subtract 10^x from both sides to bring everything to one side: 9^x - 10^x + 19 = 0. Hmm, that doesn't seem particularly helpful. Maybe I can factor something out? Or perhaps I can divide both sides by a common term? Let me see...\n\nAlternatively, I could try to express both 9^x and 10^x in terms of the same base. But 9 is 3 squared, and 10 is just 10. Not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can use substitution. Let's let y = 10^x. Then, since 9^x is (9)^x, and 9 is 10^{log10(9)}, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe take the logarithm of both sides. Let me try that. Taking natural log on both sides: ln(9^x) + ln(19) = ln(10^x). Simplifying, that gives x*ln(9) + ln(19) = x*ln(10). Hmm, okay, so I can rearrange that to x*(ln(9) - ln(10)) = -ln(19).\n\nThen, solving for x: x = ln(19)/(ln(10) - ln(9)). Let me calculate that. Using a calculator, ln(19) is approximately 2.9444, ln(10) is about 2.3026, and ln(9) is"

Because taking the logarithm of the left side was incorrect here. The original equation after substitution was 9^x +19=10^x. Taking ln of both sides would be ln(9^x +19)=ln(10^x). But that's not straightforward because the left side is the sum of exponentials, which can't be simplified with logarithm rules. Oh no, I made a mistake there!\n\nOkay, so that approach was wrong. Taking logarithms of sums isn't helpful. So I need another plan. Let me backtrack.\n\nOriginal equation: 9^x +19 =10^x. Maybe I can rearrange terms: 10^x -9^x =19. Let me see if I can test specific integer values for x to see if it works.\n\nLet's try x=2. 10^2 -9^2 =100 -81=19. Oh! That's exactly the right-hand side. So x=2 is a solution. Wait, does that work?\n\nPlugging back into original equation: 9^2 +19 =81 +19=100, and 10^2 is also 100. So yes, that works. Great! So x=2 is a solution. Is there another solution?\n\nLet me check x=1. 10^1 -9^1 =10-9=1≠19. x=3: 10^3-9^3=1000-729=271 which is more than 19. How about x=0: 10^0 -9^0 =1-1=0≠19. Negative x? Maybe x= -1: 10^{-1} -9^{-1}=0.1 - 0.111...≈ -0.011... which is negative not matching. So seems only x=2 is integer solution"

            "output": ". Maybe no other solutions?\n\nWait, but 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so maybe for some x between 1 and2, is there another solution?\n\nWait, let's think. Let me define the function f(x) =10^x -9^x. We saw that f(1)=1, f(2)=19. What about for x between 0 and 1? For x=0.5: sqrt(10)≈3.162, sqrt(9)=3, so 3.162 -3≈0.162. So f(0.5)≈0.162, which is less than 19.\n\nWait, but is the function f(x)=10^x -9^x increasing or not? Let's check its derivative. f'(x)=ln(10)10^x -ln(9)9^x. Both terms are positive because ln(10)≈2.3026 and ln(9)≈2.1972, so f'(x) is positive since 2.3026*10^x >2.1972*9^x. So, f(x) is increasing for all x. Thus, there can be only one solution.\n\nTherefore, x=2 is the only solution. So the answer is x=2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we start by rewriting \\(3^{2x}\\) as \\((3^2)^x = 9^x\\). This transforms the equation into:\n\n\\[9^x + 19 = 10^x\\]\n\nNext, we rearrange the equation to isolate the exponential terms:\n\n\\[10^x - 9^x = 19\\]\n\nWe test specific integer values for \\(x\\). Trying \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[10^2 - 9^2 = 100 - 81 = 19\\]\n\nThis satisfies the equation. We check if there could be another solution by considering the function \\(f(x) = 10^x - 9^x\\). The derivative \\(f'(x) = \\ln(10) \\cdot 10^x - \\ln(9) \\cdot 9^x\\) is positive, indicating that \\(f(x)\\)"
