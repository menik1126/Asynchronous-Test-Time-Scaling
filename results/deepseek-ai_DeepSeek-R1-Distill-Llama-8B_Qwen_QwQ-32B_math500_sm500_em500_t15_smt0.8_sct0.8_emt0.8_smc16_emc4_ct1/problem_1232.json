            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation: \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\). Hmm, okay, I need to find all the values of \\( x \\) that satisfy this. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, since there's a square root, I know that whatever is inside it, the radicand, has to be non-negative. So, \\( 11 - 2x \\geq 0 \\). Let me solve that inequality first.\n\nSubtracting 11 from both sides, I get \\( -2x \\geq -11 \\). Then, dividing both sides by -2. Wait, I remember that when I divide or multiply by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, \\( x \\leq \\frac{11}{2} \\) or \\( x \\leq 5.5 \\). Okay, so whatever solution I find, \\( x \\) must be less than or equal to 5.5. That’s a useful starting point.\n\nNow, let me look at the original equation: \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\). I need to isolate the square root to get rid of it because square roots can make equations tricky. So, maybe I can subtract 4 from both sides to get \\( x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\).\n\nThat looks better. Now, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. Let’s do that.\n\nSquaring the left side: \\( (x - 4)^2 \\), and squaring the right side: \\( (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 = 11 - 2x \\). So now, we have \\( (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x \\).\n\nExpanding the left side: \\( (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 \\). So, the equation becomes \\( x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\).\n\nNow, let me bring all terms to one side so that the equation is equal to zero. Subtracting \\( 11 \\) and adding \\( 2x \\) on both sides, we get:\n\n\\( x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x ="

Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Let's see, 5 and 1. 5 * 1 = 5 and 5 + 1 = 6. Since the middle term is -6x, both numbers should be negative: -5 and -1.\n\nSo, factoring gives \\( (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0 \\).\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero: \\( x - 5 = 0 \\) leads to \\( x = 5 \\), and \\( x - 1 = 0 \\) leads to \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nWait, but I need to remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I have to check each of these in the original equation to make sure they actually work.\n\nLet me check \\( x = 5 \\) first. Plugging into \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\):\n\nLeft side: \\( 5 \\). Right side: \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2*5} + 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 10} + 4 = \\sqrt{1} + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5 \\). So, yes, it works.\n\nNow, checking \\( x = 1 \\). Plugging into the equation:\n\nLeft side: \\( 1 \\). Right side: \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2*1} + 4 = \\sqrt{9} + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7 \\). That's not equal to 1. Hmm, so \\( x = 1 \\) is an extraneous solution and must be discarded.\n\nWait, that’s interesting. So, even though \\( x = 1 \\) satisfied the quadratic equation, when plugged back into the original equation, it didn’t work. That must mean that when we squared both sides, we introduced a solution that doesn't satisfy the original equation. So, \\( x = 1 \\) is not a valid solution.\n\nSo, the only solution is \\( x = 5 \\). But just to make sure"
