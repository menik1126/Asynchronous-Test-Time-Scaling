Let me write it down first to visualize it better.\n\nSo, the equation is x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, my goal is to find all the real values of x that satisfy this equation. Since there's a square root involved, I remember that whenever you have a square root, the expression inside has to be non-negative because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real numbers. That gives me a domain to work with.\n\nFirst, let me set up the domain. The expression inside the square root is 11 - 2x, so:\n\n11 - 2x >= 0\n\nLet me solve this inequality. Subtracting 11 from both sides:\n\n-2x >= -11\n\nNow, dividing both sides by -2. But wait, when I divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So:\n\nx <= 11/2\n\nWhich is the same as x <= 5.5. So, x has to be less than or equal to 5.5 for this equation to have a real solution. That's the domain.\n\nNow, let's get back to the equation:\n\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nI think the standard approach here is to isolate the square root term and then square both sides to eliminate it. Let me try that.\n\nSo, subtract 4 from both sides:\n\nx - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nHmm, that seems manageable. Now, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. Let me write that down:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nLeft side: (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16\n\nRight side: (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nLet me bring all the terms to one side to form a quadratic equation.

I can try to factor this. Let me look for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6.\n\nWait, 5 is a prime number, so its factors are 1 and 5. Let me see:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = x^2 - 6x + 5\n\nYes, that works because when I multiply (x - 1)(x - 5), I get x squared minus 5x minus x plus 5, which is x squared minus 6x plus 5. Perfect.\n\nSo, the equation factors to:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the potential solutions:\n\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5\n\nWait, so x could be 1 or 5. But hold on, I need to check these solutions in the original equation to make sure they work and also to ensure they are within the domain I established earlier, which was x <= 5.5.\n\nLet me check x = 1 first:\n\nOriginal equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nPlugging in x = 1:\n\nLeft side: 1\n\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 2*1) + 4 = sqrt(9) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nWait, 1 does not equal 7. Hmm, that's not good. So x = 1 is not a valid solution. It must have been introduced when I squared both sides, which can sometimes give extraneous solutions. So I need to discard x = 1.\n\nNow, let's check x = 5:\n\nLeft side: 5\n\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 2*5) + 4 = sqrt(11 - 10) + 4 = sqrt(1) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nOkay, that works. So x = 5 is a valid solution"

So let's go through it again.\n\nStarting over:\n\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtract 4: x - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSquare both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nWhich gives x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nBring all terms to left: x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nFactoring: (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0, so x = 1 and x = 5\n\nNow, checking x = 1:\n\nLeft side x = 1\n\nRight side sqrt(11 - 2*1) + 4 = sqrt(9) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7. Not equal, so rejected.\n\nx = 5:\n\nLeft side 5\n\nRight side sqrt(11 - 10) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. Works.\n\nSo x = 5 is the only solution.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, are there any other possible solutions?\n\nWell, the quadratic gave only two solutions, and one was extraneous. So unless there's a calculus approach or something, but I don't think so here. It's a straightforward algebra problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve it graphically. Let me consider the functions y = x and y = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. The solution is where these two graphs intersect.\n\nLet me think about their shapes.\n\ny = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4 is a square root function shifted to the right and up. It starts at x = 5.5, y = sqrt(11 - 11) + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4, so at (5.5, 4). As x decreases, y increases because the square root grows as x gets smaller.\n\ny = x is a straight line with slope 1.\n\nAt x = 5, y = 5 for the line, and for the square root function, at x =5, y = sqrt(11 - 10"

So that's why x=1 is extraneous.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nWait, but let me also check if there's another point where they might intersect. Let's see, when x is less than 5.5, the square root function is defined. Let me see when x is 0, the square root function would be sqrt(11) +4 \u2248 3.316 +4 \u22487.316, which is way higher than y=0. So the square root function is above the line y=x at x=0. Then, as x increases, the square root function decreases, while the line increases. They cross at x=5, and then after that, the square root function stops at x=5.5, y=4. The line at x=5.5 would be y=5.5, which is higher than the square root function's y=4 there. So they only cross once at x=5. So that's the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is x=5.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes when plugging in x=1 and x=5. Let me check again.\n\nFor x=1:\n\nOriginal equation: 1 = sqrt(11 - 2*1) +4 \u2192 sqrt(9)=3, so 3+4=7. 1 vs 7. Nope.\n\nx=5:\n\n5 = sqrt(11 -10) +4 \u2192 sqrt(1)=1, so 1+4=5. 5=5. Correct.\n\nAlright, so that's solid. So the only solution is 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5, which should be boxed.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), we start by considering the domain of the square root expression.
