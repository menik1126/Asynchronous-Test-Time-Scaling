            "output": "I need to simplify the given expression step by step. The expression is a square root of a fraction, so I'll start by simplifying the numerator inside the square root.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each term in the numerator: 5 divided by the square root of 80, the square root of 845 divided by 9, and the square root of 45. I'll simplify each of these individually to make the expression easier to handle.\n\nStarting with 5 over the square root of 80, I can simplify the square root of 80 by factoring it into 16 times 5, since 16 is a perfect square. This gives me 5 over the square root of 16 times 5, which simplifies to 5 over 4 times the square root of 5.\n\nNext, for the square root of 845 divided by 9, I'll factor 845 to find that it's 5 times 169. Since 169 is a perfect square, the square root of 845 becomes 13 times the square root of 5. So, the term becomes 13 times the square root of 5 divided by 9.\n\nThen, the square root of 45 can be simplified by factoring it into 9 times 5, resulting in 3 times the square root of 5.\n\nNow, I'll rewrite the numerator with these simplified terms: 5 over 4 times the square root of 5 plus 13 times the square root of 5 over 9 plus 3 times the square root of 5.\n\nTo combine these terms, I notice that each has a common factor of the square root of 5. I'll factor this out and express the numerator as the square root of 5 times (5/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nTo add the fractions inside the parentheses, I'll find a common denominator, which is 36. Converting each fraction accordingly, I'll get 5/4 as 45/36, 13/9 as 52/36, and 3 as 108/36. Adding these together gives a total of 205/36.\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to the square root of 5 times 205/36. Now, the entire original expression is the square root of this result divided by the square root of 5.\n\nDividing by the square root of 5 is the same as multiplying by 1"

So, the expression becomes the square root of 5 times 205/36 multiplied by 1 over the square root of 5.\n\nThe square roots cancel out, leaving me with 205/36. I'll check if this fraction can be simplified further, but since 205 is 5 times 41 and 36 is 4 times 9, there are no common factors to reduce the fraction.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is 205 over 36.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression, we'll follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Simplify each term in the numerator:**\n   - \\( \\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{80}} = \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} \\)\n   - \\( \\dfrac{\\sqrt{845}}{9} = \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9} \\)\n   - \\( \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5} \\)\n\n2. **Combine the terms in the numerator:**\n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} + \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\\sqrt{5}\n   \\]\n   Factor out \\( \\sqrt{5} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{5} \\left( \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} + \\dfrac{13}{9} + 3 \\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplify the fractions:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{5} \\left( \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} + \\dfrac{13}{9} + 3 \\right) = \\sqrt{5} \\left( \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} + \\dfrac{13}{9} + 3 \\right)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Combine the fractions and constants:**\n   Convert all terms to have a common denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} = \\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} \\times \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\dfrac{5\\sqrt{5}}{20} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\dfrac{"
