            "output": "Alright, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of a fraction, where the numerator is (5 divided by the square root of 80) plus (square root of 845 divided by 9) plus the square root of 45, and the denominator is the square root of 5. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I need to simplify each of the terms in the numerator individually. Maybe if I can simplify each part, adding them up will be easier.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 divided by the square root of 80. I remember that to simplify square roots, I should look for perfect squares. So, 80 can be broken down into 16 times 5, right? Because 16 is a perfect square. So, sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5), which is sqrt(16)*sqrt(5) = 4*sqrt(5). So, 5 divided by sqrt(80) is the same as 5 divided by (4*sqrt(5)). That can be written as (5)/(4*sqrt(5)).\n\nHmm, but there's a square root in the denominator, which I don't like. Maybe I can rationalize the denominator. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and denominator by sqrt(5). So, that would give me (5*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(5)*sqrt(5)). Simplifying the denominator, sqrt(5)*sqrt(5) is 5, so it becomes (5*sqrt(5))/(4*5) = (sqrt(5))/4. Okay, so the first term simplifies to sqrt(5)/4.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second term: sqrt(845) divided by 9. Hmm, 845 isn't a number I recognize off the top of my head. Let me see if I can factor it. 845 divided by 5 is 169, right? Because 5*169 is 845. And 169 is 13 squared. So, sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*13^2) which is sqrt(5)*13. So, sqrt(845)/9 is (13*sqrt(5))/9. That seems simplified enough.\n\nNow, the third term is sqrt(45). Again, 45 can be broken down into 9"

            "output": "*5, so sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) = 3*sqrt(5). Cool, so that's 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo now, putting it all together, the numerator is sqrt(5)/4 + (13*sqrt(5))/9 + 3*sqrt(5). Since all terms have sqrt(5), I can factor that out. Let me write it as sqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nWait, let me compute the constants separately. The constants are 1/4, 13/9, and 3. To add them together, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1. The least common denominator for 4 and 9 is 36. So, converting each fraction:\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n\n13/9 = 52/36,\n\n3 = 108/36.\n\nSo adding them up: 9 + 52 + 108 = 169. So 169/36. Therefore, the numerator becomes sqrt(5)*(169/36).\n\nSo the entire expression under the square root is sqrt(5)*(169/36) divided by sqrt(5). Wait, let me clarify. The entire numerator is sqrt(5)*(169/36), and the denominator is sqrt(5). So the expression becomes:\n\nsqrt(5) * (169/36) / sqrt(5).\n\nThe sqrt(5) in the numerator and denominator should cancel each other out, right? So that just leaves 169/36.\n\nWait, is that right? Because sqrt(5) divided by sqrt(5) is 1. So yes, 169/36 is left. So the entire expression simplifies to sqrt(169/36). Since sqrt(a/b) is sqrt(a)/sqrt(b), that would be sqrt(169)/sqrt(36). Which is 13/6.\n\nWait, so the simplified fraction is 13/6. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst term: 5/sqrt(80). I simplified sqrt(80) as 4*sqrt(5), so 5/(4*sqrt(5)) becomes sqrt(5)/4 after rationalizing. That part seems correct.\n\nSecond term: sqrt(845)/9. I broke down 845 into 5"

Correct.\n\nAdding the three terms: sqrt(5)/4 + 13*sqrt(5)/9 + 3*sqrt(5). Factoring out sqrt(5): sqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Correct.\n\nCalculating the constants: 1/4 + 13/9 + 3. Converted to 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36. Adding: 9 + 52 is 61, plus 108 is 169. So 169/36. So numerator is sqrt(5)*169/36. Divided by sqrt(5): (sqrt(5)*169/36)/sqrt(5) = 169/36.\n\nThen sqrt(169/36) is 13/6. All steps seem correct. So I think the simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified expression is \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{6}}.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression, we start by simplifying each term in the numerator individually.\n\n1.
