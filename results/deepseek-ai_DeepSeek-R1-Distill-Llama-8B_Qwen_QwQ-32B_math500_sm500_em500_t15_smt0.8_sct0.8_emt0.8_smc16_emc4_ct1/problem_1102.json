First, let me try to understand how this function works because it's defined recursively, which can sometimes be a bit tricky.\n\nThe function f is defined for non-negative integers i and j, where j is between 0 and 4. It has three cases:\n\n1. If i = 0, then f(0,j) is just mod5(j + 1). So for i=0, it's straightforward. For any j from 0 to 4, I just add 1 and take the remainder when divided by 5.\n\n2. If i ≥ 1 and j = 0, then f(i,0) = f(i-1,1). That means whenever the second argument is 0, I need to look at the function value for i-1 and j=1.\n\n3. If i ≥ 1 and j is between 1 and 4, then f(i,j) = f(i-1, f(i,j-1)). So this is a nested recursive call.\n\nSo the function builds up from i=0 and uses previous values to compute higher i's.\n\nGiven that, I need to compute f(2015, 2). That seems pretty far out, so maybe there's a pattern or cycle that repeats, which would make it easier to compute without calculating all the previous steps.\n\nLet me try computing some small values first to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with i=0:\n\nf(0,0) = mod5(0+1) = 1\n\nf(0,1) = mod5(1+1) = 2\n\nf(0,2) = mod5(2+1) = 3\n\nf(0,3) = mod5(3+1) = 4\n\nf(0,4) = mod5(4+1) = 0\n\nOkay, so for i=0, the function just increments j by 1 modulo 5.\n\nNow, let's compute f(1, j) for j=0 to 4, since that's the base case for i=1.\n\nf(1,0) = f(0,1) = 2 (since i=1 and j=0, so f(1-"

So once you get to i=5, everything is 1. Then for any higher i, since f(i,0)=f(i-1,1)=1, and then f(i,j) for j>0 is f(i-1, f(i,j-1)), but since f(i,j-1) is 1, so f(i-1,1)=1.
