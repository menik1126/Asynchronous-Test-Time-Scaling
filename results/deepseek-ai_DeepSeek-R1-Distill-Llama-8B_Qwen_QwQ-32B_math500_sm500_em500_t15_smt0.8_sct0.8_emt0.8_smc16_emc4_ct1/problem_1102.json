            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find f(2015, 2). The function f is defined recursively, which means I have to break it down step by step. Let me start by understanding the definition of f.\n\nThe function f is defined for non-negative integers i and j, where j is between 0 and 4. It has three cases:\n\n1. If i = 0 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 4, then f(i, j) = mod5(j + 1). That seems straightforward. For i=0, the function just takes j+1 modulo 5.\n\n2. If i ≥ 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1). Hmm, so if j is 0, we look at the function for i-1 and j=1.\n\n3. If i ≥ 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, then f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). Okay, this is a bit more complex. It's like a nested function call. So for each i and j, we have to compute f(i, j - 1) first, then use that result as the new j in f(i - 1, ...).\n\nMy goal is to find f(2015, 2). That seems pretty far out, so I suspect there's a pattern or cycle that repeats every few steps, which would make it easier to compute without calculating each step manually.\n\nLet me try computing f(i, j) for small values of i and j first to see if I can spot any patterns.\n\nStarting with i=0:\n- f(0,0) = mod5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0,1) = mod5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0,2) = mod5(2 + 1) = 3\n- f(0,3) = mod5(3 + 1) = 4\n- f(0,4) = mod5(4 + 1) = 0\n\nSo for i=0, f(0,j) cycles through 1,2,3,4,0 as j increases from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, let's move to i=1.\n\nFor i=1, j"
