When you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, \\( (3^k)^6 \\) becomes \\( 3^{6k} \\).\n\nNow, the equation is \\( 3^{6k} = 3^6 \\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. This gives me \\( 6k = 6 \\).\n\nFinally, to solve for \\( k \\), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 6, resulting in \\( k = 1 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\) in the equation \\((3^k)^6 = 3^6\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**:\n   \n   When a power is raised to another power, you multiply the exponents. Therefore,\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same (\\(3\\)), the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold true. Thus,\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \n   To find the value of \\( k \\), divide both sides of the equation by 6:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
