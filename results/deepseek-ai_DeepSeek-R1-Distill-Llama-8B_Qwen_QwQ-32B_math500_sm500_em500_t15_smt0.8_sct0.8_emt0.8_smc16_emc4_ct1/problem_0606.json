Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a tangent to a circle is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point. Similarly, a tangent to a parabola also touches it at just one point. Since these are common tangents, the same line will be tangent to both the circle and the parabola. So, I need to find the equations of these common tangents and then find the four points where they touch both curves. Once I have those four points, I can figure out the shape of the quadrilateral they form and calculate its area.\n\nLet me start by recalling the general equation of a line. A line can be written as \\(y = mx + c\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(c\\) is the y-intercept. Since this line is tangent to both the circle and the parabola, it must satisfy the condition of tangency for both.\n\nLet's first consider the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\). If a line \\(y = mx + c\\) is tangent to this parabola, substituting the line into the parabola's equation should give a quadratic in \\(x\\) with exactly one solution, which implies the discriminant is zero. Substituting, we get:\n\n\\[\n(mx + c)^2 = 8x\n\\]\nExpanding this, we have:\n\\[\nm^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 = 8x\n\\]\nBringing all terms to one side:\n\\[\nm^2x^2 + (2mc - 8)x + c^2 = 0\n\\]\nFor this quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. The discriminant \\(D\\) is given by:\n\\[\nD = (2mc - 8)^2 - 4 \\cdot m^2 \\cdot c^2 = 0\n\\]\nCalculating this:\n\\[\n(2mc - 8)^2 = 4m^2c^2\n\\]\nExpanding the left"

That gives us one condition: \\(mc = 2\\).\n\nNext, I need to apply the condition for the same line to be tangent to the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\). The condition for a line \\(y = mx + c\\) to be tangent to a circle with radius \\(r\\) centered at the origin is that the distance from the center to the line equals the radius. The distance \\(d\\) from the origin to the line is given by:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{|0 - (mx + c)|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}}} \\quad \\text{Wait, no, that's not quite right.}\n\\]\nActually, the standard formula for the distance from a point \\((x_0, y_0)\\) to the line \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\) is:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}\n\\]\nIn our case, the line is \\(y = mx + c\\), which can be rewritten as \\(mx - y + c = 0\\). So, \\(A = m\\), \\(B = -1\\), and \\(C = c\\). The center of the circle is at (0,0), so substituting into the distance formula:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{|m(0) + (-1)(0) + c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}}\n\\]\nThe radius of the circle is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), so this distance must equal the radius:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{|c|}{\\sqrt{m^2 + 1}} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\nS"

Hmm, perhaps each tangent line touches both the circle and the parabola at two points each? No, wait, a tangent line should touch each curve at exactly one point. So, if there are two tangent lines, that would give four points of tangency. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I need to find the four points where these two lines are tangent to both the circle and the parabola.\n\nFirst, let me find the point of tangency on the circle for each line.\n\nStarting with the line \\(y = x + 2\\). The point of tangency on the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\) can be found using the formula for the point of contact of a tangent line. Alternatively, since the line is tangent to the circle, the point of contact lies on the line and on the circle.\n\nSo, solve the system:\n\n1. \\(y = x + 2\\)\n2. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\)\n\nSubstitute \\(y = x + 2\\) into the circle equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + (x + 2)^2 = 2\n\\]\nExpanding this:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + x^2 + 4x + 4 = 2\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n2x^2 + 4x + 4 - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0\n\\]\nDivide the entire equation by 2:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\n\\]\nThis factors as:\n\n\\[\n(x + 1)^2 = 0\n\\]\nSo, \\(x = -1\\).

The area above the x-axis is a triangle with vertices (-1,1), (2,4), and (2,0), but actually, maybe not the most efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area as twice the area of the upper half.\n\nLooking at the upper half, the points are A (-1,1) and B (2,4). The base can be considered from (-1,1) to (2,4), and the height... Hmm, perhaps not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates, it's easier to stick with the shoelace formula which gave 15.\n\nSo, after computing the shoelace formula, the area is 15. That seems reasonable.\n\nSo, final answer: 15.\n</think>\n\nThe area of the quadrilateral formed by the four points of tangency is found using the shoelace formula. The four points are calculated as \\((-1,1)\\), \\((2,4)\\), \\((-1,-1)\\), and \\((2,-4)\\). Applying the shoelace formula to these points in order yields an area of 15.\n\nThe area of the quadrilateral is \\(\\boxed{15}\\)."
