I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, sometimes substitution helps because you can take logarithms of both sides or find a way to express both sides with the same base or something similar.\n\nFirst, I should write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x.\n\nAlright, so I have 3^{2x} and 10^x. Hmm, 3^{2x} can be rewritten as (3^2)^x, which is 9^x. So that part becomes 9^x. Now the equation is:\n\n9^x + 19 = 10^x.\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have 9^x and 10^x. Those are both exponential functions with different bases. I wonder if I can manipulate this equation somehow. Maybe move all the exponential terms to one side?\n\nLet's try subtracting 10^x from both sides to get:\n\n9^x - 10^x + 19 = 0.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem too helpful immediately. Maybe I can factor something out or find a substitution. Let's see, 9^x is (10/10)*9^x, which might not help. Alternatively, 10^x can be written as (9 + 1)^x. Hmm, maybe not directly useful, but let me explore that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write this equation as 9^x = 10^x - 19. Then, taking natural logarithms of both sides, but wait, that doesn't directly help because it's not just one term on the right. Alternatively, maybe I can divide both sides by 10^x to normalize the equation.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n9^x / 10^x + 19 / 10^x = 0.\n\nSimplify 9^x / 10^x as (9/10)^x, and 19 / 10^x is 19*(1/10)^x. So the equation becomes:\n\n(9/10)^x + 19*(1/10)^x = 0.\n\nHmm, that might be a bit better. Let me"

Then, since (9/10)^x = e^{x ln(9/10)}, but maybe that's complicating. Wait, let's see.\n\nFirst, write the equation in terms of y:\n\nIf y = (9/10)^x, then (1/10)^x can be written as ( (10/9)*(9/10))^x? Wait, maybe not. Wait, (1/10)^x is (9/10)^x multiplied by (1/9)^x, so that would be y*(1/9)^x? Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the equation again:\n\n(9/10)^x + 19*(1/10)^x = 0.\n\nWait, but since both (9/10)^x and (1/10)^x are positive for all real x because any exponential function with a positive base is positive. Adding two positive terms together, their sum can't be zero. Wait, but the original equation was 9^x +19=10^x, so moving 10^x over gives 9^x -10^x +19 =0. Then, moving 10^x over gives 9^x +19 =10^x, so actually when I divided by 10^x, it becomes (9/10)^x +19*(1/10)^x =1? Wait, no, that's a mistake!\n\nWait a second, let me go back. The user wrote 3^{2x} +19 =10^x. Then, moving 10^x to the left gives 3^{2x} -10^x +19=0. But when I rewrote 3^{2x} as 9^x, then the equation is 9^x -10^x +19 =0. So moving the 10^x over gives 9^x +19 =10^x. So when I divide both sides by 10^x, I get"

So starting over:\n\n9^x +19 =10^x\n\nSo, subtract 10^x from both sides:\n\n9^x -10^x +19=0\n\nBut that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, let's bring all terms to the right except 19:\n\n9^x =10^x -19.\n\nAlternatively, let's try dividing both sides by 10^x as I did before, but correctly:\n\n(9/10)^x + 19*(1/10)^x =1.\n\nWait, because 9^x /10^x is (9/10)^x, and 19 /10^x is 19*(1/10)^x. So:\n\n(9/10)^x + 19*(1/10)^x =1.\n\nHmm, but is this equation correct? Let me check with x=2, because sometimes plugging in a value can give me a sense.\n\nIf x=2, then:\n\n(9/10)^2 +19*(1/10)^2 = (81/100) + 19*(1/100)=81/100 +19/100=100/100=1. So yeah, that works. So x=2 is a solution. Let me try x=3:\n\n(9/10)^3 +19*(1/10)^3=729/1000 +19/1000=748/1000=0.748, which is less than 1. So at x=2, the left-hand side (LHS) equals 1, and at x=3, it's 0.748, so it's decreasing. How about x=1:\n\n(9/10)^1 +19*(1/10)^1=0.9 +1.9=2.8, which is greater than 1. So when x=1, LHS=2.8; x=2, LHS=1; x=3, LHS=0.748. So it's decreasing from x=1 onwards.\n\nWait, but does this equation only have x=2 as the solution? Let's try x=0:\n\n(9/10)^0 +19*(1/10)^0=1+19=20, which is"

So the LHS would go to infinity as x approaches negative infinity, and as x approaches positive infinity, (9/10)^x tends to zero, and 19*(1/10)^x also tends to zero, so the LHS approaches zero. So the function is decreasing from infinity to zero, passing through 20 at x=0, 2.8 at x=1, 1 at x=2, 0.748 at x=3, etc. So it only crosses 1 once at x=2. So maybe x=2 is the only solution?\n\nWait, but let me check x=2 in the original equation to confirm:\n\n3^{2*2} +19 = 3^4 +19 =81 +19=100. And 10^2=100. So yes, that works. So x=2 is a solution. But is there another solution?\n\nWait, when x approaches negative infinity, the LHS (9/10)^x +19*(1/10)^x tends to infinity, so maybe there's another solution where the LHS equals 1 when x is negative?\n\nWait, let's try x= -1:\n\n(9/10)^{-1} +19*(1/10)^{-1}= (10/9) +19*10= (approx 1.111) +190=191.111, which is way more than 1. So even at x=-1, it's still way above 1. Since as x approaches negative infinity, it's going to infinity, so maybe the function is always decreasing from infinity to zero, so only crossing 1 once at x=2.

So 10^x -9^x=19.\n\nWait, let me think about possible x values where this might hold. We know that at x=2, 10^2 -9^2=100-81=19, so that works. Now, could there be another x where 10^x -9^x=19?\n\nLet me consider x=1: 10 -9=1, which is less than 19.\n\nx=3: 1000 -729=271, which is greater than 19.\n\nx=2: 19, as above. So at x=2, it's 19.

So x=2 is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another solution between x=0 and x=2?\n\nWait, let's check x=1.5:\n\n10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)=~31.62, 9^1.5= sqrt(9^3)=sqrt(729)=27. So 31.62 -27≈4.62, which is less than 19. So between x=1.5 and x=2, the difference goes from ~4.62 to 19. So it's increasing. So the function 10^x -9^x is increasing for x>0?\n\nWait, let's see the derivative of f(x)=10^x -9^x. The derivative is f’(x)=10^x ln10 -9^x ln9. Since ln10>ln9, and 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so for x>0, the derivative is positive, so the function is increasing. Therefore, since f(2)=19, and it's increasing, then for x>2, f(x) is greater than 19, and for x<2, less than 19.

So 9*5.78≈52.02.\n\nSo 10^1.8 -9^1.8≈63 -52.02≈10.98, which is less than 19. So at x=1.8, f(x)=10.98.\n\nAt x=2, it's exactly 19, so between x=1.8 and x=2, the function increases from ~11 to 19, so yeah, it's increasing, so there are no other solutions.\n\nSo, after all this, I think the only solution is x=2.\n</think>\n\nThe equation to solve is \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\).\n\n1.
