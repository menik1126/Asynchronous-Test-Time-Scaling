            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3 raised to the power of 2x plus 19 equals 10 raised to the power of x. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to write that equation down clearly so I can see it better. It's 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Alright, so the variable is in the exponents, which usually makes equations like this a bit more challenging. \n\nI remember that when dealing with exponential equations, sometimes substitution can help simplify things. Let me see if that applies here. Notice that 3^{2x} is the same as (3^x)^2, right? Because when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, 3^{2x} = (3^x)^2. That seems useful because if I let y be equal to 3^x, then 3^{2x} becomes y squared. \n\nLet me try that substitution. Let y = 3^x. Then, the equation becomes y² + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, but I still have 10^x in the equation, which is a different base. Maybe I can express 10^x in terms of y as well? Hmm, not sure if that's straightforward. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, what if I let t = 10^x? Then, 10^x is just t, but the other term is y². Is there a relationship between y and t? Let me think. Since y = 3^x and t = 10^x, I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to relate x. \n\nLet me try that. Taking ln of both sides for y = 3^x gives x*ln(3) = ln(y), so x = ln(y)/ln(3). Similarly, for t = 10^x, taking ln gives x*ln(10) = ln(t), so x = ln(t)/ln(10). Therefore, ln(y)/ln(3) equals ln(t)/ln(10). So, ln(y)/ln(3) = ln(t)/ln(10). Maybe I can cross-multiply here to get a relation between y and t.\n\nCross-multiplying, I get ln(y"

            "output": ")*ln(10) = ln(t)*ln(3). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe this substitution is complicating things more. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can take logarithms on both sides of the original equation? Let me see. The problem is that the equation is 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. If I take the logarithm of both sides, the left side is a sum, which complicates things because log(a + b) isn't easily simplified. So that might not be helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe I can rearrange the equation to isolate the exponential terms? Let's see. Subtract 19 from both sides: 3^{2x} = 10^x - 19. Still, the right side is a combination of an exponential and a constant, so not sure how to proceed.\n\nWait a second, maybe I can try to express both sides with the same base? Let me see. 3^{2x} is (3^2)^x = 9^x. So the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Oh, that's a good point! So rewriting 3^{2x} as 9^x simplifies the equation to 9^x + 19 = 10^x. \n\nNow, the equation is 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, maybe I can rearrange this to get all exponential terms on one side. Let's subtract 9^x from both sides: 19 = 10^x - 9^x. \n\nHmm, so 10^x minus 9^x equals 19. I wonder if there's an integer value of x that satisfies this. Let me try plugging in some integer values for x to see if it works. \n\nLet's try x = 2. Then 10^2 - 9^2 = 100 - 81 = 19. Oh! That's exactly the right-hand side. So x = 2 is a solution. \n\nWait, so x=2 works. Let me check that again. Plugging x=2 into the original equation: 3^{2*2} +19 = 3^4 +19 = 81"

            "output": " +19 =100, and 10^2 is also 100. So yes, it checks out.\n\nBut hold on, exponential equations sometimes have more than one solution. Maybe there's another x that satisfies 9^x + 19 = 10^x. Let me see if there's another integer solution.\n\nTrying x=1: 9 +19=28; 10^1=10. 28 ≠10, so no.\n\nTrying x=3: 9^3 +19=729 +19=748; 10^3=1000. Not equal.\n\nWhat about fractions? Maybe x=0. The original equation would be 1 +19=20 vs 1, which isn't equal. So no.\n\nWhat about x=0.5? Let's compute 9^{0.5}=3, so 3 +19=22. 10^{0.5}=sqrt(10)=approx 3.16. 22≠3.16. Not a solution.\n\nHow about x= -1? 9^{-1}=1/9, so 1/9 +19≈19.111; 10^{-1}=0.1, which isn't equal. So not a solution.\n\nWait, but the function 10^x -9^x is increasing for all x because both 10^x and 9^x are increasing functions, and 10^x grows faster than 9^x. So the difference 10^x -9^x is also increasing. Therefore, since it's increasing, and we have 10^x -9^x=19 when x=2, and for x>2, 10^x -9^x increases further, and for x<2, it's smaller. Thus, x=2 is the only solution.\n\nBut let me just verify that there isn't another solution for some x. Let's consider the function f(x) =10^x -9^x. We know that f(2)=19. Let's compute f(1)=10 -9=1, f(2)=19, f(3)=1000 -729=271, which is much larger. So, as x increases, f(x) increases, so x=2 is the unique solution.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2.\n\nBut just to make sure I haven't missed other possible solutions, perhaps"

            "output": " when x is between 0 and 2? Let's check x=1.5. \n\nCompute 10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)≈31.62. 9^1.5 is sqrt(9^3)=sqrt(729)=27. So 31.62 -27≈4.62, which is less than 19. So at x=1.5, f(x)=~4.62. So between x=1.5 and x=2, the function goes from ~4.62 to 19. Since it's strictly increasing, there's only one crossing point at x=2. \n\nSimilarly, for x less than 2, the function is less than 19, so no other solutions. \n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2. \n\nWait, but let me check another point between 2 and 3, like x=2.5. 10^2.5 is sqrt(10^5)=sqrt(100000)=~316.23. 9^2.5 is sqrt(9^5)=sqrt(59049)=~243. So 316.23 -243≈73.23, which is more than 19, so the function is increasing. \n\nTherefore, since f(x) is strictly increasing, there's only one solution at x=2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is x=2. \n\nI think that's it. Let me just confirm once again with the original equation. Plugging x=2 into 3^{2x} +19: 3^4 is 81, plus 19 is 100. 10^2 is 100. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo I think that's the only solution. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we start by rewriting \\(3^{2x}\\) as \\((3^2)^x = 9^x\\). This transforms the equation into:\n\n\\[\n9^x + 19 = 10^x"
