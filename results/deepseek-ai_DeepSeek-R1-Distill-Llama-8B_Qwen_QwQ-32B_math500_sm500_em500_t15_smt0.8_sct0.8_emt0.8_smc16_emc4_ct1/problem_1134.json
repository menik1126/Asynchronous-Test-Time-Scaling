The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n\nNext, I'll convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second. Since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour, the speed is 1000 divided by 3600, which is approximately 0.2778 meters per second.\n\nNow, I'll use this speed to find out how long the hallway is. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the length of the hallway. By multiplying the speed by the time, the hallway's length in meters is 0.2778 meters/second multiplied by 90 seconds, resulting in 25 meters.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step:\n\n**Given:**\n- Time taken by the robot to travel 1 kilometer at a constant speed: 2.5 hours\n- Time taken by the robot to travel a hallway at the same speed: 90 seconds\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Robot's Speed**\n\nFirst, we need to find the robot's speed in meters per second (m/s).\n\n1. **Convert 2.5 hours to seconds:**\n   \\[\n   2.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 3600 \\text{ seconds/hour} = 9000 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the speed:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} = 0.0001111 \\text{ km/second}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Convert km/second to m/s:**\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ km} = 1000 \\text{ meters} \\\\\n   0.0001111 \\text{ km/second} \\times 1000 \\text{ meters/km} = 0.1111 \\text{ m/s}\n   \\]\n   \nSo, the robot's speed is **0.1111 m/s**.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Length of the Hallway**\n\nUsing the speed calculated:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = 0.111"
