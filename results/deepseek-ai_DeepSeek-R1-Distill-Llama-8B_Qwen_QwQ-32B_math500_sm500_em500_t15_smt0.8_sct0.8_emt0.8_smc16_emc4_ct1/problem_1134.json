            "output": "First, I need to determine the robot's speed. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. Since speed is distance divided by time, I'll set up the calculation as 1 kilometer divided by 2.5 hours, which gives me 0.4 kilometers per hour.\n\nNext, I'll convert the speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second because the hallway length is given in meters and the time taken is in seconds. There are 1,000 meters in a kilometer and 60 seconds in an hour. So, 0.4 kilometers per hour multiplied by 1,000 meters per kilometer equals 400 meters per hour. Then, divide by 60 seconds per hour to get 6.666... meters per second.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the length of the hallway. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway length at a speed of approximately 6.666 meters per second. Multiplying the speed by the time gives me 6.666 meters per second multiplied by 90 seconds, which equals 600 meters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of the hallway, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the robot's speed in meters per second (m/s):**\n   \n   - The robot travels **1 kilometer** in **2.5 hours**.\n   - Convert kilometers to meters: \\(1 \\text{ km} = 1000 \\text{ m}\\).\n   - Convert hours to seconds: \\(2.5 \\text{ hours} = 2.5 \\times 60 = 150 \\text{ seconds}\\).\n   - Speed \\(= \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ m}}{150 \\text{ s}} = \\frac{10}{1.5} = 6.\\overline{6} \\text{ m/s}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the hallway length using the speed and given time:**\n   \n   - The robot takes **90 seconds** to travel the hallway.\n   - Length of hallway \\(= \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 6.\\overline{6} \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ s} = 600 \\text{ meters}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{600 \\text{ meters}}\\)"
