            "output": "), we have to skip over the +5. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the original expression, the terms are 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.\n\nIf we group 4,5,6, the expression would be 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6), but that would require that after 3, we have -4, and then +(5+6). So to group 4+5+6, we'd have to have:\n\n1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6).\n\nBut in the original, after the -4, we have +5 +6. So to group 4,5,6, we need to have the minus before 4, but the +5 and +6 are after that. So can we group 4+5+6?\n\nWait, perhaps. Because in the original, it's -4 +5 +6. So the operators are after each number.\n\nSo, the expression can be viewed as:\n\n1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.\n\nTo group 4,5,6, we can place parentheses as -(4 +5 +6). So the expression becomes:\n\n1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6).\n\nYes, that is allowed because the parentheses are placed around the 4,5,6, and the operator before 4 is already a minus. So that is a valid placement.\n\nTherefore, computing this:\n\n1 +2 +3 =6,\n\n4 +5 +6 =15,\n\n6 -15 = -9.\n\nSo the total expression evaluates to -9.\n\nThat's lower than the previous 3.\n\nIs -9 the minimum possible? Let me see if I can get even lower.\n\nLet me think of another grouping: group 3 -4 +5 +6 as a single term.\n\nSo the expression becomes 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5 +6).\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses:3-4=-1, -1+5=4, 4+6=10. So 1+2=3, 3 +10=13.\n\nThat's 13.\n\nAlternatively, group more terms:\n\n1 + (2 +3 -4 +5) +6.\n\nAs before, that gives 13.\n\nAlternatively, group 1 +2 + (3 -4 +5) +6.\n\nThat gives 1 +"
