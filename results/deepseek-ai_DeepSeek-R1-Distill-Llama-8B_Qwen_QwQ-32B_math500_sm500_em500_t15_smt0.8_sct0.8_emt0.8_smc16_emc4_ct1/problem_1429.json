This means I need to find all integers \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nSince \\( 2^{24} \\) is already a power of 2, it simplifies the problem. I can express \\( 24 \\) as a product of integers greater than 1. The exponents of 2 that divide 24 are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Each of these exponents corresponds to a possible value of \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n \\)-th power.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of \\( n \\) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Counting these, there are 7 such integers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**:\n   - We need to find all integers \\( n > 1 \\) such that \\( 2^{24} \\) can be expressed as \\( k^n \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Analyze the Structure of \\( 2^{24} \\)**:\n   - The number \\( 2^{24} \\) is already a power of 2. To be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent must be divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Determine Possible Values of \\( n \\)**:\n   - \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\), i.e., \\( n \\) is a divisor of \\( 24 \\).\n   - The divisors of \\( 24 \\) greater than \\( 1 \\) are: \\( 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \\).\n\n4. **Count the Valid Values of \\( n \\)**:\n   - There are \\( 7 \\) divisors of \\("
