Hmm, that seems a bit tricky at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I want to understand what this function looks like. The function is f(x, y) = (x - y)/(x⁴ + y⁴ + 6). I know that for functions of multiple variables, finding maxima or minima often involves calculus, specifically partial derivatives. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I can see if there's a way to simplify the problem.\n\nLet me think about whether there's some symmetry or substitution that can make this easier. The numerator is (x - y), which is linear in both x and y, while the denominator is (x⁴ + y⁴ + 6), which is a quartic function. Since both x and y are raised to the same power in the denominator, maybe I can use some substitution or consider polar coordinates or something similar.\n\nWait, polar coordinates might complicate things because of the mixture of x and y in the numerator. Maybe I can use a substitution where I let u = x and v = y, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, I could try to set y = kx, where k is some constant, to see if that helps. Let me try that.\n\nIf I let y = kx, then the numerator becomes x - kx = x(1 - k), and the denominator becomes x⁴ + (kx)⁴ + 6 = x⁴ + k⁴ x⁴ + 6 = x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6. So the entire expression becomes f(x, k) = [x(1 - k)] / [x⁴(1 + k⁴) + 6]. Hmm, that simplifies things a bit because now I can see how f depends on x for a given k.\n\nBut wait, if x is a variable, then for each k, I can consider f as a function of x. Maybe I can find the maximum of f with respect to x for each k, and then find the maximum over all k.\n\nLet me try taking the derivative of f with respect to x to find its critical points."

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, to use Lagrange multipliers, perhaps set up the problem as maximizing f(x, y) = (x - y) subject to the constraint g(x, y) = x⁴ + y⁴ +6 = k, but since the denominator is part of the function, maybe this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the function f(x, y) and set its gradient to zero.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y, set them to zero.\n\nLet me compute ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y.\n\nFirst, f(x, y) = (x - y)/(x⁴ + y⁴ +6).\n\nCompute ∂f/∂x:\n\nUsing the quotient rule:\n\n[ (1)(x⁴ + y⁴ +6) - (x - y)(4x³) ] / (x⁴ + y⁴ +6)^2.\n\nSimilarly, ∂f/∂y:\n\n[ (-1)(x⁴ + y⁴ +6) - (x - y)(4y³) ] / (x⁴ + y⁴ +6)^2.\n\nSet both partial derivatives to zero.\n\nTherefore, the numerators must be zero:\n\nFor ∂f/∂x = 0:\n\n(x⁴ + y⁴ +6) - (x - y)(4x³"

Maybe there are other solutions, but perhaps (1, -1) is the only real critical point that gives a maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another approach. Suppose we let x = -y, then the numerator becomes 2x, and the denominator becomes 2x⁴ +6. So f(x, -x) = 2x/(2x⁴ +6). To maximize this, set derivative to zero.\n\nLet me compute derivative of 2x/(2x⁴ +6):\n\nd/dx [2x/(2x⁴ +6)] = [2*(2x⁴ +6) - 2x*(8x³)]/(2x⁴ +6)^2 = [4x⁴ +12 -16x⁴]/denominator = (-12x⁴ +12)/denominator.\n\nSet numerator to zero: -12x⁴ +12 =0 ⇒x⁴=1 ⇒x=±1.\n\nThus, maximum at x=1, y=-1 gives 2*1/(2+6)=2/8=1/4, same as before.
