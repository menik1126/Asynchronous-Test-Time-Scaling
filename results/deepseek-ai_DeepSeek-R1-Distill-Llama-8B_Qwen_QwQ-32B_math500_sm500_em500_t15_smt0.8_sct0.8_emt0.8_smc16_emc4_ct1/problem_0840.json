Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what's being asked. I need to maximize this fraction. Since both the numerator and denominator are functions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), I can think of this as an optimization problem in two variables. My goal is to find the maximum value of this expression.\n\nI wonder if I can use calculus here, specifically partial derivatives since there are two variables. If I can set up the partial derivatives equal to zero, I might be able to find critical points that could give me the maximum value.\n\nLet me denote the function as:\n\\[\nf(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\n\\]\n\nTo find the maximum, I need to compute the partial derivatives of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), set them equal to zero, and solve the resulting equations. That should give me the critical points which I can then test for maxima.\n\nStarting with the partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\). Let me recall the quotient rule for derivatives: if I have \\(f/g\\), then the derivative is \\((f'g - fg')/g^2\\). So, applying that here.\n\nFirst, let me compute the numerator as a function:\n\\[\nN(x, y) = x - y\n\\]\nSo, the partial derivative of \\(N\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is 1, and with respect to \\(y\\) is -1.\n\nDenominator:\n\\[\nD(x, y) = x^4 + y^4 + 6\n\\]\nPartial derivatives: with respect to \\(x\\), it's \\(4x^3\\), and with respect to \\(y\\), it's \\(4y^3\\).\n\nSo, applying the quotient rule, the partial derivative of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{(1)(D) - (N)(4x^3)}{D^2}\n\\]\nSimilarly, the partial derivative with respect to \\(y\\) is:\n\\[\n"
