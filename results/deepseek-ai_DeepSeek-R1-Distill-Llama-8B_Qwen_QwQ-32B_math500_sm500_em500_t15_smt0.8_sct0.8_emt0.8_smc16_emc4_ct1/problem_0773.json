            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). Then, express that distance as \u221aa/b, where a and b are positive integers, with a square-free, and find a + b. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that the distance from the origin to a point (x, y) is given by the distance formula: \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Since y is given in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula to get the distance as a function of x alone. That should make it easier to find the minimum.\n\nSo, substituting y, the distance D(x) becomes:\n\nD(x) = \u221a[x\u00b2 + (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2]\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify the expression under the square root before dealing with the square root itself. Let me expand the squared term:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 = x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9\n\nSo, plugging that back in:\n\nD(x) = \u221a[x\u00b2 + (1/\u221a2)(x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9)]\n\nLet me distribute the (1/\u221a2):\n\n= \u221a[x\u00b2 + (1/\u221a2)x\u2074 - (6/\u221a2)x\u00b2 + (9/\u221a2)]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nLet's see, x\u00b2 - (6/\u221a2)x\u00b2 is equal to x\u00b2(1 - 6/\u221a2). Hmm, but that might not be the best way to write it. Alternatively, factor x\u00b2:\n\n= \u221a[(1)x\u00b2 + (1/\u221a2)x\u2074 - (6/\u221a2)x\u00b2 + 9/\u221a2]\n\nAlternatively, arrange terms by degree:\n\n= \u221a[(1/\u221a2)x\u2074 + x\u00b2 - (6/\u221a2)x\u00b2 + 9/\u221a2]\n\nCombine the x\u00b2 terms:\n\nx\u00b2 - (6/\u221a2)x\u00b2 = x\u00b2(1 - 6/\u221a2)\n\nSo, now:\n\n= \u221a[(1/\u221a2)x\u2074 + x\u00b2(1 - 6/\u221a2) + 9/\u221a2]\n\nThis still looks messy.

Therefore, the minimum of D(x) occurs at the same x where f(x) is minimized.\n\nTherefore, maybe it's easier to minimize f(x) instead of D(x). Let me try that.\n\nLet me write f(x) again:\n\nf(x) = (1/\u221a2)(x\u2074 + (\u221a2 -6)x\u00b2 +9)\n\nWait, let me check the coefficients again:\n\nOriginal expression after expanding:\n\nInside the sqrt, before factoring 1/\u221a2:\n\nx\u00b2 + (1/\u221a2)(x\u2074 -6x\u00b2 +9)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion earlier. Let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal distance squared is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. Since y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 -3), so y\u00b2 = (1/2)(x\u00b2 -3)^2.\n\nTherefore, distance squared D\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 -3)^2.\n\nAh! Wait, that's a better way to think about it. Since the distance is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), so the square of the distance is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. Since y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 -3), then y squared is (1/2)(x\u00b2 -3)^2. Therefore, D squared is x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 -3)^2. That's simpler. I think I overcomplicated it earlier by substituting too quickly.\n\nSo, let me correct that. Let me define D\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 -3)^2. Then, to find the minimum distance, I can just minimize D\u00b2, which is easier, and then take the square root at the end.\n\nYes, that's a better approach. So, let's work with D\u00b2(x) = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 -3)^2.\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nFirst, expand (x\u00b2 -3)^2:\n\n(x\u00b2 -3)^2 = x\u2074 -6x\u00b2 +9\n\nTherefore, D\u00b2(x) = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u2074 -6x\u00b2 +9)\n\nMultiply through:\n\n= x\u00b2 + (1/2)x\u2074 - 3x\u00b2 + 9/2\n\nCombine like"

So this inconsistency arises.\n\nWait, but when I derived D squared(x) as a function of x and took its derivative, I did account for the constraint because I substituted y from the parabola equation.
