            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). Then, express this distance as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Finally, I need to find \\( a + b \\). Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance between two points \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) is given by the distance formula: \\( \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \\). Since we want the distance from the origin to a point \\( (x, y) \\) on the graph, \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) will be \\( (0, 0) \\) and \\( (x_2, y_2) \\) will be \\( (x, y) \\). So the distance \\( d \\) is \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nBut wait, the point \\( (x, y) \\) lies on the graph of \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), so \\( y \\) is not just any point; it's specifically related to \\( x \\) by that equation. That means I can substitute \\( y \\) in the distance formula with \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\).\n\nSo, substituting \\( y \\), the distance becomes:\n\n\\( d = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 } \\)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me square both sides to make it easier to work with, since the square of the distance will be the same as the square of the minimal distance, and minimizing the square will give the same result.\n\nSo, \\( d^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{"

First, expand the square:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\right) \\)\n\nSo, \\( d^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \\)\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\( d^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nThe \\( x^2 \\) terms: \\( x^2 - 3x^2 = -2x^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( d^2 = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nHmm, that's a quartic function in terms of \\( x \\). To find the minimal distance, I need to find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes \\( d^2 \\). Since the square function is increasing for positive values, minimizing \\( d^2 \\) will also minimize \\( d \\), so this should work.\n\nTo find the minimum, I can take the derivative of \\( d^2 \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and set it equal to zero. Let's do that.\n\nFirst, rewrite \\( d^2 \\) as:\n\n\\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\)\n\nCompute the derivative \\( f'(x) \\):\n\n\\( f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\right) \\)\n\nDifferentiate term by term:\n\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{1}{2}x^4 \\) is \\( 2x^3 \\)\n- The derivative of \\( -2x^2 \\) is \\( -4x \\)\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) is 0\n\nSo, \\( f'(x"

That seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me confirm the value of the distance when x is sqrt(2).\n\nPlug x = sqrt(2) into the original equation:\n\ny = (1/sqrt(2))( (sqrt(2))^2 - 3 ) = (1/sqrt(2))(2 - 3) = (1/sqrt(2))(-1) = -1/sqrt(2)\n\nThen, the distance squared is x^2 + y^2 = (2) + (1/2) = 2.5, which is 5/2.
