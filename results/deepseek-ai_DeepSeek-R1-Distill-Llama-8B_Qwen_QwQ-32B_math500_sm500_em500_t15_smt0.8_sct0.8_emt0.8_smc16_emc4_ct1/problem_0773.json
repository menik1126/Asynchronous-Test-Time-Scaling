Then, express that distance as √a/b, where a and b are positive integers, with a square-free, and find a + b. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that the distance from the origin to a point (x, y) is given by the distance formula: √(x² + y²). Since y is given in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula to get the distance as a function of x alone. That should make it easier to find the minimum.\n\nSo, substituting y, the distance D(x) becomes:\n\nD(x) = √[x² + (1/√2)(x² - 3)²]\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify the expression under the square root before dealing with the square root itself. Let me expand the squared term:\n\n(x² - 3)² = x⁴ - 6x² + 9\n\nSo, plugging that back in:\n\nD(x) = √[x² + (1/√2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9)]\n\nLet me distribute the (1/√2):\n\n= √[x² + (1/√2)x⁴ - (6/√2)x² + (9/√2)]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nLet's see, x² - (6/√2)x² is equal to x²(1 - 6/√2). Hmm, but that might not be the best way to write it. Alternatively, factor x²:\n\n= √[(1)x² + (1/√2)x⁴ - (6/√2)x² + 9/√2]\n\nAlternatively, arrange terms by degree:\n\n= √[(1/√2)x⁴ + x² - (6/√2)x² + 9/√2]\n\nCombine the x² terms:\n\nx² - (6/√2)x² = x²(1 - 6/√2)\n\nSo, now:\n\n= √[(1/√2)x⁴ + x²(1 - 6/√2) + 9/√2]\n\nThis still looks messy.

Wait, that's a better way to think about it. Since the distance is sqrt(x² + y²), so the square of the distance is x² + y². Since y = (1/√2)(x² -3), then y squared is (1/2)(x² -3)^2. Therefore, D squared is x² + (1/2)(x² -3)^2. That's simpler. I think I overcomplicated it earlier by substituting too quickly.\n\nSo, let me correct that. Let me define D² = x² + (1/2)(x² -3)^2. Then, to find the minimum distance, I can just minimize D², which is easier, and then take the square root at the end.\n\nYes, that's a better approach.
