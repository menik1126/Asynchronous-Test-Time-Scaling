            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the complex number w when z is rotated around c by π/4 counter-clockwise. Let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, let's recap. We have two complex numbers: z = 2 + √2 - (3 + 3√2)i and c = 2 - 3i. We need to rotate z around c by 45 degrees (which is π/4 radians) counter-clockwise. The result of this rotation will be w.\n\nI remember that rotating a point in the complex plane around another point involves translating the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, performing the rotation, and then translating back. So, the steps should be: translate z by -c, rotate, and then translate by c again.\n\nLet me write down z and c in terms of their real and imaginary parts:\n\nz = (2 + √2) + (-3 - 3√2)i\n\nc = 2 - 3i\n\nSo, if I translate z by -c, I subtract c from z. That is:\n\nz_translated = z - c = [ (2 + √2) - 2 ] + [ (-3 - 3√2) - (-3) ]i\n\nSimplifying that:\n\nReal part: 2 + √2 - 2 = √2\n\nImaginary part: -3 - 3√2 + 3 = -3√2\n\nSo, z_translated = √2 + (-3√2)i\n\nAlternatively, z_translated = √2 - 3√2 i\n\nNow, I need to rotate this translated point by π/4. The rotation of a complex number z' = a + bi by an angle θ is given by:\n\nw' = a cos θ - b sin θ + (a sin θ + b cos θ)i\n\nSince θ is π/4, cos θ = sin θ = √2/2.\n\nLet me compute the real and imaginary parts:\n\na = √2, b = -3√2\n\nSo,\n\nReal part: a cos θ - b sin θ = √2*(√2/2) - (-3√2)*(√2/2)\n\nImaginary part: a sin θ + b cos θ = √2*(√2/2) + (-3√2)*(√2/2)\n\nLet's compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst,"
