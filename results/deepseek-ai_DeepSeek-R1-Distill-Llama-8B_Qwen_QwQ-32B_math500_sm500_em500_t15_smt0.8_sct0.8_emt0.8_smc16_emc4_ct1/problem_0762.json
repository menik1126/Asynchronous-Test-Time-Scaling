            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here. It involves a sequence of positive integers that's strictly increasing. The sequence has some interesting properties, especially regarding geometric and arithmetic subsequences. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's restate the problem to make sure I understand it. We have a sequence: a₁, a₂, a₃, …, and it's strictly increasing. So, each term is bigger than the one before it. The key properties given are about subsequences. Specifically, for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is a geometric sequence, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAdditionally, we're told that a₁₃ = 2016, and we need to find a₁.\n\nOkay, so let me break this down. Let's consider what a geometric sequence and an arithmetic sequence are. In a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by a constant ratio. So, if I have three terms in a geometric sequence, say b, c, d, then c = b*r and d = c*r = b*r². So the ratio between consecutive terms is constant.\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So, if I have three terms c, d, e in an arithmetic sequence, then d = c + d, and e = d + d (wait, that doesn't make sense; I think I meant e = d + e). Wait, no—actually, in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So if c, d, e are in arithmetic sequence, then d - c = e - d, which means 2d = c + e.\n\nSo, combining these two properties for the given sequence: for each k, the terms at positions 2k-1, 2k, 2k+1 form a geometric sequence, and the terms at 2k, 2k+1, 2k+2 form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSo, for each k, we have two things:\n\n1. a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k}, so the ratio between consecutive terms is constant"

So, a₂ = a₁ * r₁, and a₃ = a₂ * r₁ = a₁ * r₁².\n\nSimilarly, for the arithmetic sequence a₂, a₃, a₄, let's say the common difference is d₁. So, a₃ = a₂ + d₁, and a₄ = a₃ + d₁ = a₂ + 2d₁.\n\nBut wait, since a₃ is also part of the geometric sequence, we can relate these.
