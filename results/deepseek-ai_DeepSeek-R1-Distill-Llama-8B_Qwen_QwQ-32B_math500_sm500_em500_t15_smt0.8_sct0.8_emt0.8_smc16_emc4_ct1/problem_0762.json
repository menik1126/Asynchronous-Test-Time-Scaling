            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to find.\n\nThe sequence is a1, a2, a3, and so on, with each term bigger than the one before. The problem says something about every positive integer k, so k can be 1, 2, 3, etc. For each k, there's a geometric subsequence and an arithmetic subsequence.\n\nSpecifically, for every k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. That means each term is multiplied by a common ratio. So, for example, a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} should be the same as a_{2k+1} / a_{2k}. \n\nAnd then, the other subsequence for each k is a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, which is arithmetic. An arithmetic sequence has a common difference, so the difference between a_{2k+1} and a_{2k} should be the same as between a_{2k+2} and a_{2k+1}.\n\nAlso, it's given that a_{13} = 2016, and I need to find a1.\n\nHmm, okay. So, maybe I can try to look for a pattern or figure out a recursive relation here.\n\nLet me start by writing down the conditions for a few values of k to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst, for k=1:\n- Geometric subsequence: a1, a2, a3. So, a2 = a1 * r1, and a3 = a2 * r1 = a1 * r1^2.\n- Arithmetic subsequence: a2, a3, a4. So, a3 - a2 = a4 - a3, which means 2a3 = a2 + a4. Therefore, a4 = 2a3 - a2.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2:\n- Geometric subsequence: a3, a4, a5. So, a4 = a3 * r2, and a5 = a4 * r2 = a3 * r2^2.\n- Arithmetic subsequence: a4, a5, a6. So,"

So, a7 - a6 = a8 - a7, leading to a8 = 2a7 - a6.\n\nWait, so each time for k, we have a geometric part (three terms) and an arithmetic part (three terms). So, for each k, the term at position 2k+2 is determined by the previous two terms.\n\nBut let me write down these relations for a few k to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nFor k=1:\na2 = a1 * r1\na3 = a1 * r1^2\na4 = 2a3 - a2 = 2a1*r1^2 - a1*r1\n\nFor k=2:\na4 = a3 * r2 = a1*r1^2 * r2\nBut wait, from above, a4 is already expressed in terms of a1 and r1.
