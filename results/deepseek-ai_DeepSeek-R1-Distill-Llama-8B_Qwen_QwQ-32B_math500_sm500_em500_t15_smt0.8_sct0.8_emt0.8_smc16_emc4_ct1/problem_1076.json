The second term is obtained by adding 1 to the first term, resulting in 1. The third term is obtained by multiplying the second term by 1, which gives 1. The fourth term is obtained by adding 2 to the third term, making it 3. The fifth term is obtained by multiplying the fourth term by 2, which results in 6. The sixth term is obtained by adding 3 to the fifth term, giving 9, and the seventh term is obtained by multiplying the sixth term by 3, resulting in 27.\n\nContinuing this pattern, each term alternates between addition and multiplication using the next integer in the sequence of natural numbers.\n\nTo find the first term greater than 125, I'll list out more terms following this alternation:\n\n- 8th term: Add 4 to 27, resulting in 31.\n- 9th term: Multiply by 4, giving 124.\n- 10th term: Add 5 to 124, resulting in 129.\n\nSince 129 is the first term that exceeds 125, it is the desired value.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the first term in the sequence that exceeds 125, let's analyze the given sequence step by step.\n\n1. **Sequence Definition:**\n   - **First term:** \\( a_1 = 0 \\)\n   - Each subsequent term alternates between addition and multiplication, using successive integers starting from 1.\n\n2. **Generating the Sequence:**\n   - **Second term:** \\( a_2 = a_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \\)\n   - **Third term:** \\( a_3 = a_2 \\times 1 = 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)\n   - **Fourth term:** \\( a_4 = a_3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n   - **Fifth term:** \\( a_5 = a_4 \\times 2 = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)\n   - **Sixth term:** \\( a_6 = a_5 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 \\)\n   - **Seventh term:** \\( a_7 = a_6 \\times 3 ="

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
