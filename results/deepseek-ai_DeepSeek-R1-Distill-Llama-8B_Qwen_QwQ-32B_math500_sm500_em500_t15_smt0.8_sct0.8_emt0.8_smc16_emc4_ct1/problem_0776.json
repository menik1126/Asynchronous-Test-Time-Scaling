The answer needs to be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) shouldn't be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, I remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. If I have a point \\( (x, y) \\), the distance \\( D \\) from the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). But in this problem, the point is on the graph, so \\( y \\) is related to \\( x \\) by the given equation.\n\nSo, substituting \\( y \\) from the equation into the distance formula makes sense. Let me write that down:\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\)\n\nHmm, okay. So, simplifying this expression might help find the minimum distance. Since the square root can complicate things, maybe I should square both sides to make it easier to handle. That is, minimize \\( D^2 \\) instead, because the square function is monotonic for non-negative numbers, so the minimum of \\( D \\) will occur at the same point as the minimum of \\( D^2 \\).\n\nSo, let me compute \\( D^2 \\):\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\)\n\nLet me compute each term separately. First, \\( x^2 \\) is just \\( x^2 \\). Then, the second term is \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\). Since squaring \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) would give \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and squaring \\( (x^"

So now, I have an expression for \\( D^2 \\) in terms of \\( x \\). To find the minimum distance, I should find the value of \\( x \\) that minimizes this expression. That is, take the derivative of \\( D^2 \\) with respect to \\( x \\), set it to zero, and solve for \\( x \\).\n\nSo, let me compute the derivative \\( \\frac{d}{dx} D^2 \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\right) \\)\n\nBreaking it down term by term:\n\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{1}{2}x^4 \\) is \\( 2x^3 \\).\n- The derivative of \\( -2x^2 \\) is \\( -4"

Approximately 1.581.\n\nSimilarly, \\( x = -\\sqrt{2} \\) would give the same result because \\( x^4 \\) and \\( x^2 \\) are even powers, so the value of \\( D^2 \\) would be the same as at \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance occurs at \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\), and the minimal \\( D^2 \\) is 2.5 or \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\), so the minimal distance is \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem says the minimal distance can be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), so let me write \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\) as \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2} \\).

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is \\( \\sqrt{10}/2 \\), so \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\). But wait, is 10 square-free? Square-free means that in the prime factorization, no prime is squared. The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5, neither of which are squared, so 10 is square-free. Therefore, \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( a + b = 10 + 2"
