            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). The answer needs to be expressed in the form sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a shouldn't be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find a + b. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0) is given by the distance formula: D = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Since I want the smallest distance, I need to minimize this expression.\n\nSo, let's write down the distance squared to make things easier. Minimizing D is equivalent to minimizing D\u00b2 because the square root is a monotonically increasing function. Therefore, we can work with D\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. This should be easier because working with squared terms can avoid some square roots in the derivatives later.\n\nNow, let's substitute y from the given equation into this distance squared equation. So y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3). Plugging that into D\u00b2, we get:\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + [(1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)]\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, square the y term:\n\n[(1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)]\u00b2 = (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2.\n\nSo now, D\u00b2 becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2.\n\nI can expand the (x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 term:\n\n(x\u00b2 - 3)\u00b2 = x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9.\n\nTherefore, substituting back, we have:\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)(x\u2074 - 6x\u00b2 + 9).\n\nLet me distribute the 1/2:\n\nD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (1/2)x\u2074 - 3x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 - 3x\u00b2 is -2x\u00b2. So,\n\nD\u00b2 = (1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check"

Then, expanding gives (1/2)x^4 - 3x\u00b2 + 9/2 + x\u00b2, which simplifies to (1/2)x^4 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2. Yep, that looks good.\n\nSo, D\u00b2 = (1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nNow, to find the minimum distance, I need to find the critical points of this function. Critical points occur where the derivative is zero or undefined. Since this is a polynomial, the derivative will exist everywhere, so I just need to find where the derivative is zero.\n\nLet me compute the derivative with respect to x.\n\nLet me denote f(x) = D\u00b2 = (1/2)x\u2074 - 2x\u00b2 + 9/2.\n\nf'(x) = derivative of f(x) with respect to x.\n\nSo,\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [(1/2)x\u2074] - d/dx [2x\u00b2] + d/dx [9/2].\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nd/dx [(1/2)x\u2074] = (1/2)*4x\u00b3 = 2x\u00b3.\n\nd/dx [2x\u00b2] = 4x.\n\nd/dx [9/2] = 0.\n\nTherefore,\n\nf'(x) = 2x\u00b3 - 4x.\n\nSet this equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n2x\u00b3 - 4x = 0.\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n2x(x\u00b2 - 2) = 0.\n\nSo, the critical points are when 2x = 0 or x\u00b2 - 2 = 0.\n\nThus,\n\nx = 0 or x\u00b2 = 2 => x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2).\n\nSo, we have three critical points: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2).\n\nNow, we need to evaluate D\u00b2 at these points to find which one gives the minimum distance.\n\nLet's compute f(x) for each x.\n\n"

Since 10 factors into 2 and 5, neither of which is a square, so"

Express as sqrt(a)/b. Is sqrt(5/2) equal to sqrt(10)/2?\n\nWait, yes, because sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. Because 5/2 is 10/4, so sqrt(10/4) is sqrt(10)/2. So, yes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, it's also sqrt(5)/sqrt(2). But they want both a and b to be integers, so rationalizing the denominator, we get sqrt(10)/2.\n\nThus, a = 10, b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my work, because sometimes when dealing with critical points, sometimes you might have a minima or maxima.\n\nWait, is 5/2 indeed the minimal value? Let me analyze the function f(x) = (1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + 9/2.\n\nAs x approaches infinity, (1/2)x^4 dominates, so f(x) approaches infinity. Similarly, as x approaches negative infinity, same thing.\n\nWe found critical points at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). We computed f(0) = 9/2, which is 4.5, and f(sqrt(2)) = 5/2, which is 2.5, which is less. So yes, 5/2 is indeed the minimal value.\n\nTherefore, D = sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. So a = 10, b = 2, so a + b = 12.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think\u2014could the minimal distance be at another point? Hmm, perhaps not because f(x) only has those critical points and it's a quartic function opening upwards with a 'W' shape, so it's going to have a local minima at x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2), which are lower than the point at x=0.

So, the point on the graph is (x, (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3)). The distance squared from the origin is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, which is x\u00b2 + [ (x\u00b2 - 3)^2 / 2 ].\n\nYes, that's correct. Then expanding (x\u00b2 - 3)^2 gives x^4 -6x\u00b2 +9, so divided by 2 gives (x^4)/2 - 3x\u00b2 + 9/2. Then adding x\u00b2 gives (x^4)/2 -2x\u00b2 + 9/2. That's correct.\n\nTaking derivative: 2x^3 -4x. Setting to zero, 2x^3 -4x =0, so 2x(x\u00b2 -2)=0, so x=0 or x=\u00b1\u221a2. Correct.\n\nThen plugging back in, at x= sqrt(2):\n\ny = (1/\u221a2)( (sqrt(2))\u00b2 -3 ) = (1/\u221a2)(2 -3) = (1/\u221a2)(-1) = -1/\u221a2. So the point is (sqrt(2), -1/\u221a2). The distance squared is (sqrt(2))\u00b2 + (-1/\u221a2)^2 = 2 + (1/2) = 2.5 = 5/2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, at x= -sqrt(2), same y value, so same distance.\n\nAt x=0, y = (1/\u221a2)(0 -3) = -3/\u221a2. Distance squared is 0 + (9/2) = 4.5, which is 9/2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance squared is indeed 5/2, so the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. So a is 10, b is 2, so 10 + 2 = 12. Therefore, the answer is 12.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using calculus of variations or parametrization, but I think the method"

Express the distance squared as a function, take its derivative, set it to zero, find critical points, evaluate, etc. So, that seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think geometrically. The graph of y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 -3) is a parabola opening upwards, vertex at (0, -3/\u221a2). The origin is at (0,0). The minimal distance should be along the line connecting the origin to the parabola. So, maybe I can find the point on the parabola closest to the origin by solving for where the line connecting (x, y) to (0,0) is perpendicular to the tangent of the parabola at that point.\n\nLet me try that approach to verify.\n\nSo, if the line from the origin to (x, y) is perpendicular to the tangent of the parabola at (x, y), then their slopes must multiply to -1.\n\nFirst, let me find the derivative of the parabola, which is the slope of the tangent at any point (x, y).\n\nGiven y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3), so dy/dx = (1/\u221a2)(2x) = (2x)/\u221a2 = x\u221a2 /1. Wait, wait, 2x divided by sqrt(2) simplifies to x*sqrt(2). Because 2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). So, dy/dx = sqrt(2) x.\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at (x, y) is m_tangent = sqrt(2) x.\n\nNow, the slope of the line connecting (x, y) to the origin is (y - 0)/(x - 0) = y/x.\n\nSince these two lines are perpendicular, their slopes satisfy:\n\nm_tangent * m_line = -1.\n\nSo,\n\n(sqrt(2) x) * (y / x) = -1.\n\nSimplify this:\n\nsqrt(2) x * y /x = sqrt(2) y = -1.\n\nThus, sqrt(2) y = -1 => y = -1 / sqrt(2).\n\nBut from the parabola equation, y = (1/\u221a2)(x\u00b2 - 3).
