            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where a matrix M transforms one vector to another and another vector to another. I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this matrix M. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my linear transformations, but let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a matrix transforms a vector, it essentially applies a linear transformation. So, M takes each vector from its domain to its range. Given that, the image of a line under this transformation should be another line, right? So, I need to figure out how points on y = 2x + 1 are transformed by M.\n\nBut wait, do I know what M is? No, not directly. I only know how it transforms two specific vectors. So, M is a 2x2 matrix, I assume, because we're working in R². Since M isn't given directly, maybe I can find it by setting up equations based on the given transformations.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n      [c  d]\n\nSo, applying M to a vector [x; y] would give [a*x + b*y; c*x + d*y].\n\nNow, according to the problem, when M acts on the vector [2; -1], it results in [9; 3]. So, plugging into M's formula:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, when M acts on [1; -3], it gives [7; -1]. So:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo, now I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nNow, I can solve this system of equations to find a, b, c, d.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9 => Let's express b in terms of a: b = 2a - 9\n\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7 => Substitute b from above: a - 3*(2a - 9) = "

Then, substitute back into equation 1 to find b:\n\nb = 2*4 - 9 = 8 - 9 = -1\n\nSo, b = -1.\n\nNow, moving on to the equations for c and d.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2c - d = 3 => Let's solve for d: d = 2c - 3\n\nFrom equation 4: c - 3d = -1 => Substitute d from above:\n\nc - 3*(2c - 3) = -1\n\nCompute that:\n\nc - 6c + 9 = -1\n-5c + 9 = -1\n-5c = -1 -9\n-5c = -10\nc = (-10)/(-5) = 2\n\nSo, c = 2. Then, substitute back into equation 2 to find d:\n\nd = 2*2 -3 = 4 -3 = 1\n\nTherefore, d = 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the matrix M is:\n\n[ a   b ]   [4   -1]\n[ c   d ] = [2    1 ]\n\nLet me verify if this works with the given vectors.\n\nFirst, check the first vector [2; -1]:\n\nM * [2; -1] = [4*2 + (-1)*(-1); 2*2 + 1*(-1)] = [8 +1; 4 -1] = [9; 3]. That's correct.\n\nSecond vector [1; -3]:\n\nM * [1; -3] = [4*1 + (-1)*(-3); 2*1 + 1*(-3)] = [4 +3; 2 -3] = [7; -1]. Perfect, that matches too. So the matrix is correct.\n\nNow, the next part is to find the image of the line y = 2x +1 under this matrix M. \n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, the image of a"

            "output": " line under a linear transformation is another line. So, if I can parameterize the original line and then apply the transformation, I can find the equation of the image.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the transformation's effect on the coordinates. Since y = 2x +1 is a line, it's made up of points (x, y) where y is related to x. So, suppose we take a general point (x, y) on the line, which satisfies y = 2x +1. Then, the transformed point under M is (x', y') where:\n\nx' = a*x + b*y\ny' = c*x + d*y\n\nWe know a, b, c, d, so we can substitute:\n\nx' = 4x - y\ny' = 2x + y\n\nNow, since y = 2x +1, we can substitute that into the above equations.\n\nSo, substitute y = 2x +1 into x' and y':\n\nx' = 4x - (2x +1) = 4x -2x -1 = 2x -1\n\ny' = 2x + (2x +1) = 2x +2x +1 =4x +1\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx' = 2x -1\ny' =4x +1\n\nWait, but x' and y' are the transformed coordinates. I need to express y' in terms of x', so I can eliminate x and get an equation relating x' and y'.\n\nFrom the first equation: x' = 2x -1, we can solve for x:\n\nx = (x' +1)/2\n\nSubstitute this into the expression for y':\n\ny' =4x +1 =4*( (x' +1)/2 ) +1 = 2*(x' +1) +1 = 2x' +2 +1 = 2x' +3\n\nSo, y' = 2x' +3\n\nTherefore, the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M is y = 2x +3.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Found the matrix M correctly by solving the system: Correct.\n2. Substituted the original line into the transformation equations: Correct.\n3. Substituted y"

Solved for x in terms of x', substituted into y', and simplified: Let me check the algebra again.\n\nStarting with x' =2x -1, so x = (x' +1)/2. Then:\n\ny' =4x +1 =4*( (x' +1)/2 ) +1 = (4/2)(x' +1) +1 = 2(x' +1) +1 = 2x' +2 +1 = 2x' +3. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with a specific point on the original line.\n\nTake a point on y =2x +1. Let's choose x=0, then y=1. So the point is (0,1).\n\nApplying M to this vector:\n\nM*(0,1) = [4*0 -1*1; 2*0 +1*1] = [-1; 1]. So the transformed point is (-1,1). Let's see if this lies on y =2x +3.\n\nPlugging x' =-1 into the equation: y =2*(-1)+3 = -2 +3 =1. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother point: Let's take x=1 on the original line. Then y=2*1 +1=3. The point is (1,3).\n\nApplying M: [4*1 -1*3; 2*1 +1*3] = [4-3; 2+3] = [1;5]. So transformed point (1,5). Check in y=2x+3: 2*1 +3=5. Correct.\n\nAnother point: x= -1, then y=2*(-1)+1 =-1.
