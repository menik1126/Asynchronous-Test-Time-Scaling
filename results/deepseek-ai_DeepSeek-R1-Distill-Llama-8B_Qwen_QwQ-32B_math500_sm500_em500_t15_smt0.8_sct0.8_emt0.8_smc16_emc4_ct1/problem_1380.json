Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that matrices can represent linear transformations. So, if I can figure out what matrix M is, then I can apply it to the entire line y = 2x + 1. But wait, the problem only gives me two specific transformations. How do I find the entire matrix from that?\n\nLet me recall. A matrix has two columns since we're dealing with transformations in 2D. Each column of the matrix corresponds to the transformation of the standard basis vectors. So, if I denote the standard basis vectors as e1 = [1, 0]^T and e2 = [0, 1]^T, then:\n\nM * e1 = [9; 3] because when M is applied to e1, it gives the first column of M. Similarly, M * e2 = [7; -1]. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, each column is the image of each basis vector. But in the problem, the first transformation is M applied to [2; -1] resulting in [9; 3], and the second transformation is M applied to [1; -3] resulting in [7; -1]. Hmm, so I can't directly get the columns of M from the given information. I need another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can express the given vectors as linear combinations of the basis vectors and then find M? Let me think. Let me denote the two given vectors as v1 = [2; -1] and v2 = [1; -3]. The images under M are w1 = [9; 3] and w2 = [7; -1]. So, M(v1) = w1 and M(v2) = w2.\n\nIf I set up the equations, it's like M * v1 = w1 and M * v2 = w2. Since M is a 2x2 matrix, I can write it as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nThen, M * v1 = a*2 + b*(-1) = 9\n          M * v2 = a*1 + b*(-"

Let me think again.\n\nWait no, more accurately, when we multiply matrix M with vector v, it is:\n\nM * v1 = [a b; c d] * [2; -1] = a*2 + b*(-1) for the first component, and c*2 + d*(-1) for the second component. That should equal [9; 3]. Similarly, M * v2 is [a*1 + b*(-3); c*1 + d*(-3)] and that equals [7; -1].\n\nSo, I can set up four equations here. Let's see.\n\nFirst equation: 2a - b = 9 (from the first component of M*v1)\n\nSecond equation: 2c - d = 3 (from the second component of M*v1)\n\nThird equation: 1a - 3b = 7 (from the first component of M*v2)\n\nFourth equation: 1c - 3d = -1 (from the second component of M*v2)\n\nSo now, we have four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 2: 2c - d = 3\nEquation 3: a - 3b = 7\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nHmm, okay, so first, I can solve the first two equations for a and c in terms of b and d?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to solve the first two variables (a and b first using equations 1 and 3, then c and d using equations 2 and 4.\n\nLet me start with equations 1 and 3 for a and b.\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nLet's solve for one variable in terms of the other.

Correct.\n\nSo, matrix M is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the image of the line y=2x+1 under M. Hmm.\n\nThe image of a line L under a linear transformation M is another line L'. The way to find L' is to find the image of two points on L, then find the line connecting those two images. Alternatively, since M is linear, we can apply M to the line and find its image equation.\n\nLet me think: the line y=2x+1 can be parametrized as (t, 2t +1), where t is a parameter.

So points on the line are (t, 2t +1), which can be written as (t,1) + t*(0,2) = t*(0,2) + (t,1). Hmm, perhaps that's not as straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using a vector approach: find two points on the line, apply M to both, and then find the line through the images.\n\nBut the line y=2x +1 has infinitely many points. So maybe another approach is to express the line in the form y = mx + b, which it already is, and find the image by applying M to each point, but since M is linear, I can represent the image as a linear transformation of the original line.\n\nWait, another idea: if we have a line y = mx + b, then applying a linear transformation M (represented by matrix [[a,b],[c,d]]) will transform the line to another line. The slope of the image line can be determined by the determinant of M, or maybe through the inverse transformation.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps it's better to find two points on the line y=2x +1, transform them with M, and then find the equation of the line connecting the transformed points.\n\nI'll try that.\n\nLet me choose two points on the line y=2x +1.

Let me check the slope between (-1,1) and (1,5):\n\nSlope m = (5 -1)/(1 - (-1)) = 4/2 = 2.\n\nBetween (1,5) and (3,9): (9-5)/(3-1)=4/2=2. So, same slope. So the image is a straight line with slope 2. Now, let's find the equation.\n\nUsing point-slope form. Let's take the first point (-1,1):\n\ny -1 = 2(x - (-1)) => y -1 = 2(x +1) => y = 2x +2 +1 => y=2x +3.\n\nWait, but let me check with another point.

Wait, but the original line was y=2x +1, and after transformation, it's y=2x +3? That seems too straightforward. But let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here.

Correct.\n\nSo, those points are correctly transformed.\n\nNow, let me see: the images are at (-1,1), (1,5), (3,9). So, in terms of points on the line y = 2x +3, because when x=-1, y=2*(-1)+3=-2+3=1.\n\nAt x=1, y=2*1 +3=5. Correct.\n\nAt x=3, y=2*3+3=9. Correct. So that's the image.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think more generally: since M is linear, it transforms lines to lines. So the image of y=2x +1 under M is another line. Alternatively, if M is invertible, we can find the inverse and see where the line maps, but perhaps that's more involved.\n\nAlternatively, since the original line y=2x +1 can be written as y -1 =2(x -0). So in parametric form, it's x = t, y=2t +1.\n\nSo, any point (t, 2t +1) when transformed by M becomes:\n\nM*(t, 2t +1) = [4*t + (-1)*(2t +1); 2*t +1*(2t +1)]\n\nCompute each component:\n\nFirst component: 4t -2t -1 = 2t -1\n\nSecond component: 2t +2t +1 =4t +1\n\nSo, the transformed point is (2t -1, 4t +1). Now, to find the equation of this line.\n\nLet me let u = t. So, x =2u -1, y=4u +1.\n\nFrom x: u = (x +1)/2.\n\nSubstitute into y: y=4*(x+1)/2 +1=2(x+1)+1=2"

So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the image of the line y=2x +1 under M is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Since the problem says \"the image of the line under M\", and M is a linear transformation, but the original line is affine (since it's y=2x+1, not through the origin). So linear transformations can map lines to lines or points, but in this case, since the line is not through the origin, the image will also be an affine line, which is what we have here.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think is that the image of a line under a linear transformation can be found by applying the transformation to the direction vector of the line and to a point on the line.\n\nThe original line has direction vector (1, 2) because the slope is 2. The point (0,1) is on the line.\n\nApplying M to the direction vector (1,2):\n\nM*(1,2) = [4*1 + (-1)*2; 2*1 +1*2] = [4-2; 2+2] = [2;4]. So the direction vector of the image line is (2,4), which simplifies to (1,2). So the slope is still 4/2 = 2, which matches our previous result.\n\nThen, applying M to the point (0,1) gives (-1,1), which is a point on the image line. So the image line has slope 2 and passes through (-1,1). So the equation is y -1 =2(x +1), which simplifies to y=2x +3. Same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is y=2x +3. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the matrix's effect on the equation of the line.\n\nSuppose we have a linear transformation represented by matrix M. The line y = 2x +1 can be written as 2x - y +1 =0.\n\nUnder the transformation M, the coordinates (x,y) are transformed to (x', y') = M*(x"

Let me think again.\n\nWait, if the transformation is given by M, then for each point (x, y) on the original line, we have (x', y') = M*(x, y). So, to find the equation of the image line, we can express x' and y' in terms of x and y, and then substitute y from the original equation.\n\nWait, the original line is y = 2x +1. So, y = 2x +1.\n\nSo, for any point on the line, y =2x +1. Then, under M, this point is transformed to x' = a x + b y, and y' = c x + d y.\n\nSo substitute y from the original equation: y =2x +1.\n\nSo, x' = a x + b*(2x +1) = (a +2b)x +b\n\ny' =c x + d*(2x +1) = (c +2d)x +d\n\nSo, the image point (x', y') is given by:\n\nx' = (a +2b)x +b\n\ny' = (c +2d)x +d\n\nWhich is a parametric equation in x.
