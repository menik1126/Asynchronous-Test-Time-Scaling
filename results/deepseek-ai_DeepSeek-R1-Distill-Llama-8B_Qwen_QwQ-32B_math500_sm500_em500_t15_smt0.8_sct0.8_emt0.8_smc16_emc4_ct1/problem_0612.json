So, 196 equals 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared.\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is (exponent of each prime + 1) and then multiply those together, I'll add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization.\n\nThis means I'll calculate (2 + 1) for the exponent 2 and (2 + 1) for the exponent 7, resulting in 3 and 3 respectively.\n\nFinally, multiplying these together gives 3 times 3, which equals 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors \\( 196 \\) has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 196:**\n   \n   - Divide \\( 196 \\) by \\( 2 \\): \\( 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\)\n   - Divide \\( 98 \\) by \\( 2 \\): \\( 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\)\n   - Now, \\( 49 \\) is \\( 7 \\times 7 \\)\n   \n   So, the prime factors of \\( 196 \\) are:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the Formula for Number of Divisors:**\n   \n   If a number \\( N \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^{k} \\), then the number of positive divisors of \\( N \\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + 1)(b + 1)\\ldots(k + 1)\n   \\]\n   \n   Applying this to \\( 196 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of divisors} = (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **List of Divisors (Optional):**\n   \n   The divisors of \\( 196 \\) are:\n   \\[\n   1, 2, 4, 7"
