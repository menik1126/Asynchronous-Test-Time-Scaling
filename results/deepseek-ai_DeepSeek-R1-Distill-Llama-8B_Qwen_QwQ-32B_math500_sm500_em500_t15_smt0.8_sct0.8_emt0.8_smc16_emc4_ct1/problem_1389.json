            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where a matrix M transforms one vector to another and another vector to another, and I need to figure out what happens to the line y = 2x + 1 when it's transformed by M. Hmm, that sounds like it involves linear transformations and maybe some composition of functions or something. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when a matrix transforms a vector, it's like applying a linear transformation. So, if M takes a vector (a, b) to another vector, we can represent that as M*(a, b) = (c, d). So, in this problem, M is transforming two specific vectors. Let me write down what I know.\n\nThe first vector is (2, -1) being transformed to (9, 3). So, in equation form, that would be M * [2; -1] = [9; 3]. Similarly, the second vector (1, -3) is transformed to (7, -1). So, M * [1; -3] = [7; -1].\n\nSince M is a linear transformation, it can be represented by a 2x2 matrix. Let's denote M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n      [c  d]\n\nSo, when I multiply M by a vector [x; y], I get [a*x + b*y; c*x + d*y]. So, for the first transformation, plugging in (2, -1):\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nAnd for the second transformation, plugging in (1, -3):\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nSo now I have a system of equations:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. 2c - d = 3\n3. a - 3b = 7\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nSo, I have four equations with four unknowns: a, b, c, d. I can solve this system step by step.\n\nLet me try to solve for a and b first. From equations 1 and 3:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 3: a - 3b = 7"

Let me multiply equation 3 by 2 so that the coefficients of a match:\n\n2*(a - 3b) = 2*7 => 2a - 6b = 14\n\nNow, subtract equation 1 from this:\n\n(2a - 6b) - (2a - b) = 14 - 9\n2a - 6b - 2a + b = 5\n-5b = 5\nSo, b = -1\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, if -5b = 5, then b = -1. Hmm. Let me check that again.\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nMultiply equation 3 by 2: 2a - 6b = 14\nSubtract equation 1: (2a -6b) - (2a - b) = 14 - 9 => (-6b + b) = 5 => -5b = 5 => b= -1\n\nYes, that's correct. So b = -1. Now, plug this back into equation 1 to find a.\n\nEquation 1: 2a - (-1) = 9 => 2a + 1 = 9 => 2a = 8 => a = 4.\n\nSo, a = 4, b = -1.\n\nNow, let's solve for c and d using equations 2 and 4.\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d = 3\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nLet me solve this system. Maybe I can solve for c from equation 4 first.\n\nFrom equation 4: c = -1 + 3d\n\nNow plug this into equation 2:\n\n2*(-1 + 3d) - d = 3\n-2 + 6d - d = 3\n-2 + 5d = 3\n5d = 5\nd = 1\n\nThen, from equation 4: c = -1 + 3(1) = -1 + 3 = 2\n\nSo, c = 2 and d = 1.\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n\nM = [4  -1]\n      [2   1"

Hmm. So, this line is in the original plane, and when transformed by M, it becomes another line. I need to find the equation of the transformed line.\n\nThinking about how linear transformations affect lines. So, if a line is transformed by a linear transformation, the image of the line is another line. To find its equation, we can find two points on the original line, transform them, and then find the equation of the new line through those transformed points.\n\nAlternatively, since the transformation is linear, the image of the line y=2x+1 can be found by expressing the line in parametric form and then applying M.\n\nWait, another approach: since the line is y=2x +1, we can represent it parametrically as x = t, y = 2t +1, where t is a parameter. Then, the transformation M acts on each point (t, 2t +1) by multiplying M, so the transformed point is (4t -1, 2t +1). Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, let's represent the line as a vector function. Let me take a general point (x, y) on the line y=2x+1. So, x can be any real number, and y=2x +1. So, a point can be written as (x, 2x +1). To express this as a vector function, we can let x = t, so the vector is:\n\nv(t) = [t; 2t +1]\n\nThen, the transformation M acts on this vector:\n\nM * v(t) = [4t -1; 2t +"

So the transformed point is (2t -1, 4t +1). So, the parametric equations for the image are:\n\nx' = 2t -1\n\ny' = 4t +1\n\nNow, to find the equation of the line in terms of x' and y', we can eliminate the parameter t.\n\nFrom the first equation, x' = 2t -1, so solving for t:\n\nx' +1 = 2t => t = (x' +1)/2\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\ny' = 4*( (x' +1)/2 ) +1 = 2*(x' +1) +1 = 2x' +2 +1 = 2x' +3\n\nTherefore, the equation is y' = 2x' +3.

Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, let me verify this with another approach to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the original line is y = 2x +1, which can be written as a linear equation plus a constant. Since linear transformations preserve lines, but the constant term might be affected by the translation? Wait, but actually, linear transformations (matrices) are linear, so they don't preserve translations. Wait, but the line y=2x +1 is an affine line, not necessarily through the origin. Hmm, so"

Alternatively, maybe x=1, y=3, and x=0, y=1.\n\nSo, point A: (0,1)\n\nPoint B: (1,3)\n\nNow, transform these two points using M.\n\nCompute M*(0;1):\n\nM = [4 -1; 2 1]\n\nSo, [4*0 + (-1)*1; 2*0 +1*1] = (-1; 1)\n\nSimilarly, M*(1;3):\n\n[4*1 + (-1)*3; 2*1 +1*3] = (4 -3; 2 +3) = (1;5)\n\nSo, the transformed points are (-1,1) and (1,5).\n\nNow, find the equation of the line passing through (-1,1) and (1,5).\n\nCompute the slope m:\n\nm = (5 -1)/(1 - (-1)) = 4/2 = 2\n\nSo, slope is 2.

Plugging x=3: y=2*3 +3=9. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother point: x=-1, then y=2*(-1)+1 = -1. So point (-1, -1). Wait, no, wait, when x=-1, y=2*(-1)+1 = -2 +1 = -1. So point (-1, -1).

So that's good.\n\nTherefore, the transformed line is indeed y=2x +3. So, the answer should be y = 2x +3. Wait, but let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the matrix's effect on the direction vector and the point.\n\nAlternatively, since the line is affine, it can be written as a point plus a direction vector. The line y=2x +1 can be parametrized as:\n\nLet me write it as a vector equation. Let me set t as a parameter, so:\n\nr(t) = (0,1) + t*(1,2). Because the direction vector is (1,2) since the slope is 2. Wait, but the line is y=2x +1, so direction vector is (1,2).

So the direction vector becomes (2,4). Wait, that can be simplified by dividing by 2, so direction vector is (1,2), same as before. Wait, that can't be. Wait, let me compute again.\n\nWait, M*(1;2) is [4*1 + (-1)*2; 2*1 +1*2] = [4 -2; 2 +2] = (2;4). So direction vector is (2,4), which is 2*(1,2). So, that's just scaling by 2. So, the direction is preserved, as expected.\n\nNow, the point (0,1) is transformed to M*(0;1) = (-1;1). So, the transformed line passes through (-1,1) and has direction vector (2,4), which is same as scaling by 2.
