            "output": "Alright, so I need to figure out how the matrix M transforms the line y = 2x + 1. Hmm, okay. First, let me recall what I know about matrices and linear transformations. A matrix can represent a linear transformation, and when applied to a vector, it changes the vector according to the matrix's rules. \n\nThe problem says that M takes the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3) and (1, -3) to (7, -1). So, M is a 2x2 matrix that transforms these input vectors to their respective outputs. My goal is to find what happens to the entire line y = 2x + 1 under this transformation. \n\nI think the way to approach this is to first determine the matrix M itself. Once I have M, I can apply it to the entire line. But how do I find M? Well, since M takes two vectors to their images, I can set up equations based on the given information.\n\nLet me denote M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nWhen I multiply M by the vector (2, -1), I should get (9, 3). So, the equations are:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, for the vector (1, -3), multiplying by M gives (7, -1). So, the equations are:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nNow, I have four equations:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. 2c - d = 3\n3. a - 3b = 7\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nSo, I can solve these equations to find a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me work on equations 1 and 3 first. \n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nI can solve this system. Let me solve equation 3 for a: a = 7 + 3b\n\nNow, plug this into equation 1:\n\n2*(7 + 3b) - b = 9\n14 + 6b - b = 9\n14 + 5"

Next, I need to apply this transformation to the entire line y = 2x + 1. Hmm, how do I do that? \n\nI recall that the image of a line under a linear transformation is another line, unless the transformation is degenerate, which it isn't here because it's given as a matrix transforming specific vectors. So, I should find the image of two points on the line y = 2x +1, then find the equation of the line connecting those images.\n\nBut since M transforms any vector (x, y) to (a x + b y, c x + d y), perhaps I can express the image of the line in terms of y = m'x + b'. Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the line and apply the transformation.\n\nWait, maybe a more straightforward way is to express the line in parametric form and then apply M to the parameters. Let me think. \n\nThe line y = 2x + 1 can be parametrized. Let me let x = t, so y = 2t + 1. So, any point on the line can be written as (t, "

Let me denote the transformed coordinates as (X, Y). \n\nSo, X = 2t -1 and Y = 4t +1. \n\nLet me solve for t from the X equation:\n\nX = 2t -1 => 2t = X +1 => t = (X +1)/2\n\nNow, substitute this into the Y equation:\n\nY = 4*( (X +1)/2 ) +1 = 2*(X +1) +1 = 2X +2 +1 = 2X +3\n\nTherefore, the equation Y = 2X +3. \n\nWait, so the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M is Y = 2X +3. \n\nBut let me check if this is correct. Let me verify with a point on the original line. \n\nTake a point on the original line, say when x =0, y=1. Applying M to (0,1):\n\nM*(0,1) = (4*0 -1*1, 2*0 +1*1) = (-1, 1). \n\nPlugging into Y = 2X +3: 2*(-1) +3 = -2 +3 =1. So Y=1, which matches. \n\nAnother point: when x=1, y=3. Applying M to (1,3):\n\nM*(1,3) = (4*1 -1*3, 2*1 +1*3) = (4-3, 2+3) = (1,5). \n\nPlugging into Y=2X +3: 2*1 +3 =5. That works. \n\nAnother point"
