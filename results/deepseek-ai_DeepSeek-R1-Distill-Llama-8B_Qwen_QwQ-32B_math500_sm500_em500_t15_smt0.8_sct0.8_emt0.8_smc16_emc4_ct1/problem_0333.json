The number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7 is calculated using the combination formula C(7,3). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4 is C(4,2).\n\nAfter calculating the number of combinations for boys and girls, I'll multiply the two results to find the total number of ways Mr. Brennan can form the group.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer as the product of the two combination values.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we can use combinations. Combinations are suitable because the order in which the students are selected does not matter.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\nThe formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two results to find the total number of ways.**\n\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
