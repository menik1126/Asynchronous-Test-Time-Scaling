Let G represent the number of girls attending the math club, and B represent the number of boys.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that the total number of students is 35. So, the equation is G + B = 35.\n\nNext, it's given that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. That means G can be 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since there are only 35 students in total, G must be less than or equal to 35. The possible multiples of 13 within this range are 13 and 26.\n\nAdditionally, there are more girls than boys, which means G > B.\n\nLet's test the possible values for G:\n\n1. If G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. But this contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys, since 13 is not greater than 22.\n\n2. If G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. This satisfies both conditions: 26 is a multiple of 13, and there are more girls (26) than boys (9).\n\nSince G = 26 is the only value that meets all the criteria, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys.\n\n**Let’s define:**\n- G = Number of girls\n- B = Number of boys\n\n**From the problem:**\n1. \\( G + B = 35 \\) \\(\\quad\\) (Total students)\n2. \\( G = 13k \\) \\(\\quad\\) where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n3. \\( G > B \\)\n\n**Step 1: Determine possible values for G**\nSince G is a multiple of 13 and \\( G \\leq 35 \\), the possible values for G are:\n- \\( G = 13 \\times 1 = 13 \\)\n- \\( G = 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\)\n\n**Step 2: Apply the condition G > B**\n- If \\( G = 13 \\):\n  \\[ 13 + B = 35 \\implies B = 22 \\]\n  But"
