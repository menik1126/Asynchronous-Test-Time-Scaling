Since 13 is a larger multiple, the smallest possible number of girls is 13. However, since there are more girls than boys, \\( g \\) must be greater than \\( b \\).\n\nLet's test \\( g = 26 \\) because \\( 26 \\) is a multiple of 13 and:\n\\[\nb + 26 = 35 \\implies b = 9\n\\]\nThis means there are 9 boys at the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Total number of students = 35\n2. Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n3. There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( b \\) = Number of boys\n- \\( g \\) = Number of girls\n\n**Step 1:** Write the equation for the total number of students.\n\\[\nb + g = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Since the number of girls is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys, let's find possible values for \\( g \\).\n- The smallest multiple of 13 greater than half of 35 is \\( 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\) (since 26 is a multiple of 13 and \\( 26 > 17.5 \\) (half of 35)).\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute \\( g = 26 \\) into the equation.\n\\[\nb + 26 = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Solve for \\( b \\).\n\\[\nb = 35 - 26\n\\]\n\\[\nb = 9\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
