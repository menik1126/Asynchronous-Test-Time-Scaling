            "output": "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, I'll start by performing its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 196 by 2 to get 98. Dividing 98 by 2 again gives 49. Next, I'll divide 49 by 7 to obtain 7, and finally, 7 divided by 7 equals 1. So, the prime factors of 196 are \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nUsing the formula for the number of divisors, which is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply them, I'll calculate the number of divisors. That is, \\((2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - **196** can be divided by **2**:\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   - **98** can be divided by **2** again:\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **49** is a perfect square of **7**:\n     \\[\n     49 = 7^2\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the prime factors of **196** are:\n     \\[\n     196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Divisors**:\n   - The formula to find the number of positive whole-number divisors of a number \\( N = p^a \\times q^b \\) is:\n     \\[\n     (a + 1) \\times (b + 1)\n     \\]\n   - Applying this formula to **196**:\n     \\[\n     (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
