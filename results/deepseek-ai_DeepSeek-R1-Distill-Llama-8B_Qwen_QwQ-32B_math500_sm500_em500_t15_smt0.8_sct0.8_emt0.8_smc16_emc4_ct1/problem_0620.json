            "output": "To determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, I'll start by finding its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I note that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives 98.\n\nNext, I factor 98 further by dividing it by 2 again, resulting in 49.\n\nNow, 49 is a known square number, specifically 7 squared. Therefore, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared (2²) and 7 squared (7²).\n\nWith the prime factorization established, I can calculate the total number of divisors using the formula: (exponent of each prime + 1) multiplied together.\n\nFor 196, this means (2 + 1) times (2 + 1), which equals 3 multiplied by 3, resulting in 9.\n\nSo, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many **positive whole-number divisors** \\( 196 \\) has, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of \\( 196 \\).**\n\n   - \\( 196 \\) is even, so it's divisible by \\( 2 \\).\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   - \\( 98 \\) is also even, so divide by \\( 2 \\) again:\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   - \\( 49 \\) is a known square number (\\( 7^2 \\)):\n     \\[\n     49 = 7 \\times 7\n     \\]\n   \n   Therefore, the prime factors of \\( 196 \\) are:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the formula for finding the number of divisors.**\n\n   If a number \\( N \\) has a prime factorization of \\( p^a \\times q^b \\times \\dots \\), then the total number of positive divisors is:\n   \\[\n   (a + 1)(b + 1)\\dots\n   \\]\n   \n   For \\( 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\):\n   - The exponents are \\( 2 \\) and \\( 2 \\).\n   - Add \\( 1 \\)"
