The prime numbers in this range are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll list all the odd numbers greater than zero.

The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n   \n   \\[\n   2, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 23, \\ 29\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify the set of all odd numbers greater than zero:**\n   \n   Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. The sequence of odd numbers greater than zero is:\n   \n   \\[\n   1, \\ 3, \\ 5, \\ 7, \\ 9, \\ 11, \\ 13, \\ 15, \\ 17, \\ 19, \\ 21, \\ 23, \\ 25, \\ 27, \\ 29\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Find the intersection of the two sets:**\n   \n   The intersection consists of numbers that are in both sets. Comparing the two lists:\n   \n   - **Primes less than 30:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,"

However, upon closer inspection:\n   \n   - **29** is a prime number and an odd number greater than zero, so it should be included.\n   \n   Therefore, the correct count is **9**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{9}"
