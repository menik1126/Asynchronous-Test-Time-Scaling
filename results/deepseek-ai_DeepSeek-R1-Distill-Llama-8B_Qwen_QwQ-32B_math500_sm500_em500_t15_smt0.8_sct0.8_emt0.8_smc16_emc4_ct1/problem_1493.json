The primes less than 30 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll determine the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. These include 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29.\n\nNow, I'll find the intersection of these two sets. The intersection consists of the numbers that are in both sets. From the list of primes less than 30, the odd primes are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nTherefore, the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero contains the odd prime numbers: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nFinally, counting these numbers gives us a total of 9 elements in the intersection.\n</think>\n\nSure!
