I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the maximum value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) as \\( n \\) varies over all positive integers.\n\nFirst, let me denote \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). Then, the problem becomes finding \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\). I think the Euclidean algorithm would be helpful here. The Euclidean algorithm is a method to compute the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying division and taking remainders. The formula for the Euclidean algorithm is \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b) \\).\n\nSo, let me compute \\( a \\mod b \\). Since \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\), to find \\( a \\mod b \\), I need to express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\). Maybe I can rewrite \\( a \\) as a linear combination of \\( b \\). Let me see:\n\nWe have \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). Let me solve for \\( n \\) in terms of \\( b \\). Subtracting 1 from both sides gives \\( b - 1 = 2n \\), so \\( n = \\frac{b - 1}{2} \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, \\( b \\) must be odd because \\( b - 1 \\) must be even. Therefore, \\( b \\) is an odd integer greater than 1.\n\nNow, substitute \\( n = \\frac{b - 1}{2} \\) back into \\( a \\):\n\n\\( a = n + 7 = \\frac{b - 1}{2} + 7 = \\frac{b - 1 + 14}{2} = \\frac{b + 13}{2} \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = \\frac{b + 13}{2} \\).

To find \\( q \\) and \\( r \\), since \\( b \\) is approximately twice \\( a \\) if \\( a \\) is large, I think \\( q \\) is 1/2 times something, but since \\( q \\) has to be an integer, maybe I should multiply both sides by 2.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to express \\( a \\) in terms of \\( b \\). Let me try subtracting an appropriate multiple of \\( b \\) from \\( a \\) to find the remainder.\n\nLet me compute \\( 2a = b + 13 \\). Since \\( a = \\frac{b + 13}{2} \\), multiplying both sides by 2 gives \\( 2a = b + 13 \\). Therefore, \\( 2a - b = 13 \\). So, the equation \\( 2a - b = 13 \\) relates \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nBut since \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\), perhaps I can use this equation in the gcd computation. Let's recall that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b) \\). So, let me compute \\( a \\mod b \\).\n\nFrom the equation \\( 2a = b + 13 \\), so \\( 2a \\equiv 13 \\mod b \\). Therefore, \\( a \\equiv 13/2 \\mod b \\). Hmm, but we can't directly divide by 2 in modular arithmetic unless 2 has an inverse modulo \\( b \\). Since \\( b \\) is odd, 2 and \\( b \\) are coprime, so 2 does have an inverse modulo \\( b \\). The inverse of 2 modulo \\( b \\) is the number \\( x \\) such that \\( 2x \\equiv 1 \\mod b \\).

But since \\( 2x \\equiv 1 \\mod b \\), \\( x = (b + 1)/2 \\) because \\( 2 \\times (b + 1)/2 = b + 1 \\equiv 1 \\mod b \\). Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the inverse of 2 modulo \\( b \\) can be found using the extended Euclidean algorithm. Let me compute it for a general odd \\( b \\). Let me set \\( b = 2k + 1 \\) where \\( k \\) is a positive integer. Then, we can solve for \\( x \\) such that \\( 2x \\equiv 1 \\mod (2k + 1) \\). Let me see:\n\n\\( 2x = 1 + m(2k + 1) \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nThis simplifies to \\( 2x = 1 + 2mk + m \\).\n\nLet me choose \\( m = 0 \\), then \\( 2x = 1 \\), which would require \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\), but that's not an integer. So, instead, let me pick \\( m \\) such that \\( 1 + m(2k +1) \\) is even.\n\nSince \\( 2k + 1 \\) is odd, \\( m(2k +1) \\) is odd if \\( m \\) is odd and even if \\( m \\) is even. Therefore, \\( 1 + m(2k +1) \\) is even when \\( m \\) is odd because adding 1 to an odd number gives an even number.\n\nSo, let me try \\( m = 1 \\): \\( 2x = 1 + (2k +1) = 2k + 2 \\), so \\( x = k + 1 \\). Therefore, the inverse of 2 mod \\( b = 2k +1 \\) is \\( k +1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( x = k + 1 \\), which is \\( (b +1)/2 \\) since \\( b = 2k +1 \\). Therefore, the inverse \\( x = (b +1"

When we take modulo \\( b \\), \\( 13b \\) is congruent to 0 mod \\( b \\), so we have \\( \\frac{13}{2} \\mod b \\). Wait, that seems similar to earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think differently. Let me try to compute \\( a \\mod b \\). Since \\( a = \\frac{b +13}{2} \\), then \\( a \\mod b = \\frac{b +13}{2} \\mod b \\). But \\( \\frac{b +13}{2} = \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{13}{2} \\). Since \\( b \\) is odd, \\( \\frac{b}{2} \\) is not an integer, but in modular arithmetic, we can write \\( b = 2k +1 \\), so \\( \\frac{b}{2} = k + \\frac{1}{2} \\), which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of \\( a \\) as \\( (2n +1 +7)/2 = (2n +8)/2 = n +4 \\). So, \\( a = n +4 \\). Wait, no, because \\( a = n +7 \\), right? Wait, no. Let me make sure: \\( a = n +7 \\) and \\( b = 2n +1 \\). So, if I write \\( a = (2n +1) +6 \\), then \\( a = b +6 \\). Therefore, \\( a - b = 6 \\). So, perhaps that's a useful equation.\n\nSo, \\( a - b = 6 \\), meaning \\( a = b +6 \\). Therefore, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b +6, b) \\). Using the Euclidean algorithm, \\( \\gcd(b +6, b) = \\gcd(b, 6) \\).\n\nOh! That's a key insight. So, \\( \\gcd(n +7, 2n +1) = \\gcd(2n +"

Since \\( a = n +7 \\) and \\( b = 2n +1 \\), which is larger than \\( a \\) when \\( n \\) is large enough.

Let me denote \\( a = n +7 \\), \\( b = 2n +1 \\). Since \\( b = 2n +1 \\), which is greater than \\( a = n +7 \\) when \\( n >6 \\). For \\( n \\leq6 \\), \\( a \\) could be larger or smaller.

The quotient is 2, since \\( 2*(n +7) = 2n +14 \\), which is larger than \\( 2n +1 \\). Wait, actually, the quotient would be 1, because 2*(n +7) is 2n +14, which is bigger than 2n +1. So, actually, the first step would be:\n\n\\( \\gcd(2n +1, n +7) \\). Because if \\( a = n +7 \\), \\( b = 2n +1 \\), then since \\( b > a \\), we can swap them, so \\( \\gcd(b, a) \\).\n\nThen, divide \\( b = 2n +1 \\) by \\( a = n +7 \\).

So, \\( a \\) is about half of \\( b \\). Let me compute:\n\n\\( 2*(n +7) = 2n +14 \\), which is larger than \\( 2n +1 \\) by 13.
