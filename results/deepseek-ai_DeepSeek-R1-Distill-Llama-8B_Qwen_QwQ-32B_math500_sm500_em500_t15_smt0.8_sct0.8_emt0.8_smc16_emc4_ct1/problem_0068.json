            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Given a positive integer n, I need to find the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor of n + 7 and 2n + 1. Hmm, that sounds like a number theory problem involving the gcd function. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest possible gcd that can result from the two expressions n + 7 and 2n + 1.\n\nI remember that one useful property of gcd is that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a) when b > a. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me denote d = gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1). If I can express d in terms of n, perhaps I can find its maximum value.\n\nSo, let's write that down: d = gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1). Applying the property I just mentioned, d should divide (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7). That should give me a simpler expression to work with.\n\nCalculating that difference: (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13. So, d divides -13. Since the gcd is always a positive integer, this means that d must be a divisor of 13. \n\nNow, 13 is a prime number, so its only positive divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the possible values for d are 1 and 13. The question is asking for the greatest possible value, so it must be 13.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that this divisor 13 is actually attainable. That is, there exists some positive integer n such that both n + 7 and 2n + 1 are divisible by 13.\n\nLet me set up the equations to check this. If 13 divides n + 7, then n \u2261 -7 mod 13. Similarly, if 13 divides 2n + 1, then 2n \u2261 -1 mod 13, which means n \u2261 (-1)/2 mod 13. \n\nSince 2 and 13 are copr"

            "output": "ime, the inverse of 2 modulo 13 exists. The inverse of 2 mod 13 is 7 because 2*7=14 \u2261 1 mod 13. Therefore, n \u2261 -1 * 7 mod 13, which simplifies to n \u2261 -7 mod 13. \n\nSo, both conditions lead to n \u2261 -7 mod 13. That means if I choose n such that n = 13k - 7 for some integer k, then both n + 7 and 2n + 1 will be divisible by 13.\n\nWait a second, n needs to be a positive integer. So, I have to ensure that n = 13k - 7 > 0. Let's solve for k:\n\n13k - 7 > 0 \u2192 13k > 7 \u2192 k > 7/13. Since k must be an integer, the smallest possible k is 1. So, plugging k = 1, n = 13*1 - 7 = 6. Let me check if that works.\n\nFor n = 6:\nn + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13.\n2n + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.\ngcd(13, 13) = 13. Perfect, that works.\n\nLet me try k = 2 just to see another example. n = 13*2 -7 = 26 -7 = 19.\nn +7 = 19 +7 =26.\n2n +1= 38 +1=39.\ngcd(26,39). Let's compute that: factors of 26 are 1,2,13,26. Factors of 39 are 1,3,13,39. So the gcd is 13. That also works.\n\nSo, as long as n is congruent to -7 mod 13, which is the same as n \u2261 6 mod 13, the gcd will be 13. Since 13 is the largest possible divisor (as 13 is prime), the greatest possible gcd is indeed 13.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. I started by applying the gcd property, found that the gcd must divide 13, checked that 13 is attainable by finding an n that satisfies both congruences, so I think the answer is safe.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest"
