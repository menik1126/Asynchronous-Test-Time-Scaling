            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, I first need to understand what constitutes a terminating decimal. A fraction will always result in a terminating decimal if, after simplifying, the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\nIn this case, the denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\). Since both 2 and 5 are among the allowed prime factors, the fraction is already set up to convert into a terminating decimal.\n\nNext, I'll convert the denominator from its exponential form to its standard form. Calculating \\(2^2\\) gives 4, and \\(5^7\\) equals 78,125. Multiplying these together results in a denominator of 4 \\cdot 78,125, which is 312,500.\n\nNow, the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{21}{312,500}\\). To convert this into a decimal, I'll perform the division of 21 by 312,500.\n\nFinally, after completing the division, I'll obtain a decimal that terminates because the denominator after simplification only contains the primes 2 and 5.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Condition for a Terminating Decimal:**\n   A fraction will result in a terminating decimal if the denominator (after simplifying the fraction) has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n2. **Simplify the Denominator:**\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 4 \\cdot 78,\\!125 = 312,\\!500\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Write the Fraction with the Simplified Denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{312,\\!500}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   \\[\n   21 \\div 312,\\!500 = 0.000067\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.000067}\n   \\]"
