            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, I first need to understand its prime factorization. The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\), which means the fraction is already in its simplest form with both 2 and 5 as prime factors.\n\nNext, I recall that a fraction will terminate if the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5 after simplifying. Here, since the fraction is already simplified, I can directly work with the denominator's existing form.\n\nI then consider the number of decimal places the fraction will have. The number of 2s in the denominator determines the number of decimal places. With \\(2^2\\) in the denominator, the fraction will have \\(2\\) decimal places.\n\nTo convert the fraction to a decimal, I can calculate the denominator's value. \\(2^2\\) is 4, and \\(5^7\\) is 78125. Multiplying these together gives \\(4 \\cdot 78125 = 312500\\).\n\nFinally, I divide the numerator by the denominator. Dividing 21 by 312500 yields 0.000067.\n\nTherefore, the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) converts to 0.000067 in decimal form.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Prime Factors\nThe denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\), which means:\n- **Number of 2s:** 2\n- **Number of 5s:** 7\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Decimal Places\nA fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator has only the prime factors 2 and/or 5. Here, both 2 and 5 are present.\n\nThe **number of decimal places** a fraction will have is determined by the **number of 2s** in the denominator. Since there are 2 twos, there will be **2 decimal places**.\n\n### Step 3: Convert the Fraction to a Decimal\n1. **Simplify the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 4 \\cdot 78125 = 312500\n   \\]\n\n"

However, rounding to the correct number of decimal places (2) gives **0.000067**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{0.000067}"
