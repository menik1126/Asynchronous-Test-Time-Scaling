            "output": "To determine the volume of the cube, I need to first understand the relationship between the sphere and the cube.\n\nThe steel sphere has a radius of 3 inches, which means its diameter is twice that, so 6 inches. For the sphere to fit perfectly inside the cube without any extra space, the sphere's diameter must match the cube's side length. Therefore, the cube must have a side length of 6 inches.\n\nNow that I know the cube's side length, I can calculate its volume using the formula for the volume of a cube, which is the side length raised to the power of three. So the volume is 6 inches multiplied by 6 inches multiplied by 6 inches, which equals 216 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, I'll present the volume of the cube as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Sphere's Diameter**:\n   - The radius of the sphere is 3 inches.\n   - The diameter is twice the radius: \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) inches.\n\n2. **Relate the Sphere's Diameter to the Cube's Side Length**:\n   - For the sphere to fit perfectly inside the cube, the sphere's diameter must equal the cube's side length.\n   - Therefore, the cube has a side length of 6 inches.\n\n3. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube**:\n   - The volume \\(V\\) of a cube is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\text{side length}^3\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the side length:\n     \\[\n     V = 6^3 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{216}\n\\]"
