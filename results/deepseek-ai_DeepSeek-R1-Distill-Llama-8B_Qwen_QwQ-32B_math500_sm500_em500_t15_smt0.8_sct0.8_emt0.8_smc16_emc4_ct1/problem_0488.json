The volume \\( V \\) of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself three times, so \\( V = s^3 \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length.\n\nNext, I should find out the volume of the steel sphere that is formed after the metal is removed from the cube. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\), with \\( r \\) being the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is 3 inches.\n\nAfter calculating the volume of the sphere, I will subtract this volume from the volume of the original cube to find out how much metal was removed. This will give me the remaining volume, which is the volume of the cube without the corners.\n\nFinally, by knowing the original volume of the cube and the volume of the sphere, I can calculate the volume of the cube after the metal from the corners has been removed.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Radius of the steel sphere, \\( r = 3 \\) inches.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Sphere**\n\nThe volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( r = 3 \\) inches:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (27) = 36 \\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Side Length of the Cube**\n\nWhen metal is removed from the corners of the cube to form a sphere, the radius of the sphere is related to the side length \\( s \\) of the cube.

Let me clarify the problem.\n\n**Problem Clarification:**\n\nThe sphere is made by removing metal from the corners of the cube. The cube has the shortest possible side lengths. This implies the sphere must be inscribed in the cube such that the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces, but the corners are removed. Alternatively, the sphere is the largest possible inscribed sphere, but the corners are cut off to form the sphere.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. But then the sphere's radius would be half the edge length, so \\( s = 2r = 6 \\). But then the volume of the cube would be \\( 6^3 = 216 \\), and the sphere's volume is \\( 36\\pi \\approx 113 \\), so the remaining volume would be \\( 216 - 36\\pi \\). But the problem says the cube is made by removing metal from the corners to form the sphere. So the sphere is the remaining part after removing the corners. Therefore, the sphere's volume equals the cube's volume minus the removed corners. But the problem states the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners, so the sphere's volume is equal to the cube's volume minus the removed parts. But the question asks for the volume of the cube, not the sphere. Wait, the question says \"How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?\" So the cube is the original cube before removing the metal. The sphere is formed by removing metal from the corners of the cube, so the sphere's volume is less than the cube's volume. But the problem is asking for the volume of the original cube. To find that, we need to relate the sphere's dimensions to the cube's dimensions.\n\nPerhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so the sphere's diameter equals the cube's edge length. Then, the sphere's radius is half the edge length, so \\( s = 2r = 6 \\). Thus, the cube's volume is \\( 6^3 = 216 \\).

            "output": " the cube's volume is indeed 216 cubic inches.\n\nWait, but the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the corners, so the sphere is the shape after the corners are removed. Therefore, the sphere's volume is less than the cube. But the problem is asking for the cube's original volume, which is the starting point. So to find the cube's original volume before any metal was removed, we need to establish the relationship between the sphere's radius and the cube's space diagonal.\n\nThe sphere is formed by cutting off each corner of the cube. Each corner cut is a small octant of a sphere. Therefore, the sphere's radius is related to the cube's edge length.\n\nBut actually, when you cut off each corner of the cube, each corner becomes a small sphere of radius \\( r \\). The space diagonal of the cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere. Because the sphere must fit perfectly inside the cube, touching the centers of the faces.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. When you cut off each corner of the cube to form a sphere, the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's edge length. Because the sphere touches the centers of each face of the cube.\n\nThus, if the sphere has a radius \\( r = 3 \\) inches, its diameter is \\( 6 \\) inches, which equals the cube's edge length.

However, the problem doesn't provide any information about the sphere's volume, only its radius. Thus, perhaps the relationship is that the sphere's diameter equals the cube's space diagonal.\n\nLet me clarify: When a sphere is inscribed in a cube, the sphere touches the centers of each face of the cube, and the space diagonal of the cube is equal to the sphere's diameter. The space diagonal \\( d \\) of the cube is \\( s \\sqrt{3} \\). The sphere's diameter is \\( 2r = 6 \\) inches.\n\nSetting \\( s \\sqrt{3} = 6 \\implies s = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2 \\"

But this is smaller than the sphere's volume \\( 36 \\pi \\approx 113 \\), which is impossible because the sphere can't have a larger volume than the cube.\n\nThis contradiction suggests an error in the assumption. The sphere must be entirely within the cube, so its volume must be less than the cube's volume. Therefore, the sphere's diameter must be less than or equal to the cube's edge length.\n\nPerhaps the sphere is inscribed in the cube such that its diameter equals the edge length of the cube.

The sphere's volume is \\( 36\\pi \\approx 113 \\), which is less than 216, so this works.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the cube has the \"shortest possible side lengths\". If the sphere is inscribed with diameter equal to edge length, then the cube's edge length is 6, which is the minimal possible? Or is there a smaller cube?\n\nWait, if the sphere is formed by removing the corners, perhaps the sphere is not inscribed in the cube but is instead the result of truncating the cube's corners such that the sphere touches the edges or vertices. This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternative approach: The problem says the cube has the shortest possible side lengths. To minimize the cube's side length while still allowing the sphere to be formed by removing metal from the corners, the sphere must be as large as possible given the cube's dimensions.\n\nAssuming the sphere is inscribed in the cube, so its diameter equals the cube's edge length. Thus, the minimal cube side length is \\( s = 2r = 6 \\), leading to volume \\( 216 \\).\n\nAlternatively, if the sphere is inscribed in the cube's space diagonal, then \\( s \\sqrt{3} = 2r \\implies s = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\"
