            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: 3^(2x) + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit nervous because exponential equations can be tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that 3^(2x) is the same as (3^2)^x, which simplifies to 9^x. So, the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That feels a bit simpler, right? Now, I have 9^x and 10^x on the same side, so maybe I can get all the terms involving x on one side.\n\nLet me subtract 9^x from both sides to get 19 = 10^x - 9^x. Hmm, okay, so 10^x minus 9^x equals 19. I'm not sure how to solve this directly, so maybe I can try plugging in some integer values for x and see if they work.\n\nLet's start with x=0. Then, 10^0 is 1, and 9^0 is also 1. So, 1 - 1 = 0, which is not equal to 19. Nope, x=0 is not a solution.\n\nHow about x=1? 10^1 is 10, and 9^1 is 9. So, 10 - 9 = 1, which is not 19. Still not there.\n\nNext, try x=2. 10^2 is 100, and 9^2 is 81. So, 100 - 81 = 19. Hey, that works! So, x=2 is a solution.\n\nBut wait, are there more solutions? Maybe. When dealing with exponential functions, sometimes there can be two points where they intersect. Let me check another value to see if there's another solution.\n\nLet's try x=3. 10^3 is 1000, and 9^3 is 729. So, 1000 - 729 = 271, which is way bigger than 19. Hmm, so for x > 2, 10^x grows much faster than 9^x, so the difference increases rapidly.\n\nWhat about x=0.5? Let's see. 10^0.5 is the square root"

            "output": " of 10, approximately 3.162. 9^0.5 is 3. So, 3.162 - 3 = 0.162, which is less than 19. So, between x=0 and x=2, the function 10^x - 9^x goes from 0 to 19, and since it's continuous, there must be some solutions in between.\n\nBut wait, at x=1, the difference was 1, and at x=2, it's 19. So, maybe x=2 is the only integer solution, but perhaps there's another solution between x=0 and x=1.\n\nLet me test x=0.5 again. It was about 0.162. What about x=0.7? 10^0.7 is approximately 5.0119, and 9^0.7 is about 3.737. So, 5.0119 - 3.737 \u2248 1.274, still less than 19.\n\nWait, maybe trying intermediate values isn't the best approach. Maybe I should consider the function f(x) = 10^x - 9^x and analyze its behavior.\n\nLet me think about the derivatives to see how the function behaves. The derivative of 10^x is ln(10)*10^x, and the derivative of 9^x is ln(9)*9^x. So, f\u2019(x) = ln(10)*10^x - ln(9)*9^x.\n\nAt x=2, f(x)=19, and f\u2019(x) is positive because 10^x grows faster than 9^x. So, the function is increasing at x=2.\n\nWhat about when x is negative? Let me check x=-1. 10^(-1) is 0.1, and 9^(-1) is approximately 0.1111. So, 0.1 - 0.1111 \u2248 -0.0111, which is negative. But we have f(x) = 10^x - 9^x = 19. So, for negative x, 10^x is less than 9^x because 10 is bigger than 9, but since x is negative, 10^x is actually smaller.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me clarify: 10"

            "output": "^(-1) is 1/10, and 9^(-1) is 1/9. Since 1/10 < 1/9, so 10^(-1) - 9^(-1) is negative. So, as x approaches negative infinity, 10^x and 9^x both approach zero, but 10^x approaches zero faster because it's a smaller base? Wait, actually, when x is negative, 10^x = 1/(10^|x|), so the smaller the base, the larger the value when x is negative. So, 9^(-x) is larger than 10^(-x) when x is positive, so 10^x - 9^x is negative for negative x.\n\nTherefore, the function f(x) = 10^x - 9^x is negative when x <0, crosses zero somewhere between x=0 and x=1, but wait, at x=0, it's 0. Hmm, actually at x=0, it's 1 -1 =0. Then, at x=1, it's 10-9=1, so it's increasing from 0 to 1 as x goes from 0 to1. Wait, so between x=0 and x=1, the function goes from 0 to 1, so it's increasing. Then, at x=2, it's 19, so it's increasing further. So, the function is always increasing?\n\nWait, let me check the derivative again. The derivative f\u2019(x) = ln(10)*10^x - ln(9)*9^x. Let's see when this is positive.\n\nSince ln(10) \u2248 2.3026 and ln(9) \u2248 2.1972. So, the coefficients are close. Let's see at x=0: f\u2019(0) = ln(10) - ln(9) \u2248 0.1054, which is positive. So, the function is increasing at x=0. At x=1, f\u2019(1)= ln(10)*10 - ln(9)*9 \u2248 2.3026*10 - 2.197"

Suppose for some x, f(x)=19, but as the function is always increasing, is that the only point?\n\nLet me think of the function when x approaches negative infinity: 10^x approaches 0, 9^x approaches 0, but since 10 >9, 10^x approaches zero faster than 9^x. So, 10^x -9^x approaches negative zero, but still negative. At x=0, it's zero, and then increases to positive values as x increases. Therefore, since it's strictly increasing and only crosses 19 once, x=2 must be the only solution.\n\nSo, the solution is x=2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we start by rewriting \\(3^{2x}\\) as \\((3^2)^x = 9^x\\).
