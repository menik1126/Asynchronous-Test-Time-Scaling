            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x). The function is given as g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2]. Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the domain of a function includes all the possible x-values that we can plug into the function without causing any mathematical issues. In this case, since there's a square root, the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to zero. So, the first thing I need to do is set up that inequality.\n\nLet me write that down: (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, I have this expression inside the square root, which is a difference of squares. I recall that a difference of squares can be factored. The formula is a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). So maybe I can factor this expression.\n\nLet me let a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). Then, the expression becomes a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). So substituting back, it would be [(x - 3) - (x - 8)] * [(x - 3) + (x - 8)]. That should make it easier to solve the inequality.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step. First, expand the first bracket: (x - 3) - (x - 8). Let me distribute the negative sign: x - 3 - x + 8. Now, the x terms: x - x cancels out, leaving -3 + 8, which is 5. So the first part simplifies to 5.\n\nNow, the second bracket: (x - 3) + (x - 8). Let me compute that: x - 3 + x - 8. Combine like terms: x + x is 2x, and -3 -8 is -11. So that simplifies to 2x - 11.\n\nPutting it all together, the expression under the square root factors into 5*(2x - 11). So the inequality becomes 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0.\n\nSince "

            "output": "5 is a positive constant, I can divide both sides of the inequality by 5 without changing the direction of the inequality. So, 2x - 11 ≥ 0.\n\nNow, solving for x: add 11 to both sides. That gives 2x ≥ 11. Then, divide both sides by 2: x ≥ 11/2, which is 5.5.\n\nWait, hold on. Is that all? So the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to zero, which gives x ≥ 11/2. So the domain of g(x) is [11/2, ∞). Therefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 11/2.\n\nBut let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I started by setting the inside of the square root greater than or equal to zero. Then, I correctly identified that it's a difference of squares and factored it correctly. The first bracket became 5, the second became 2x - 11. Then, 5 times (2x - 11) is greater than or equal to zero. Dividing both sides by 5 gives 2x - 11 ≥ 0, leading to x ≥ 11/2. That seems correct.\n\nLet me also compute 11/2 as a decimal to get a better sense. 11 divided by 2 is 5.5, so x must be at least 5.5.\n\nWait another thing, is there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by expanding the squares first and then simplifying. Let me try that method to cross-verify.\n\nCompute (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Let me expand both squares.\n\nFirst, (x - 3)^2 is x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nThen, (x - 8)^2 is x^2 - 16x + 64.\n\nSubtracting the second from the first: (x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64). Let me distribute the negative sign: x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64.\n\nNow, x^2 cancels with -x^2, leaving (-6x + 16x) + (9 -"

            "output": " 64).\n\nSo, -6x + 16x is 10x, and 9 - 64 is -55. So the expression simplifies to 10x - 55.\n\nSo, 10x - 55 ≥ 0. Solving for x: 10x ≥ 55; x ≥ 55/10; x ≥ 5.5. Which is the same as 11/2. So that confirms my earlier result.\n\nWait, so both methods give me the same answer, so I think that solidifies that the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5, or 11/2.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, maybe I should plug in a number less than 5.5 into the original expression to see if it's negative, which would mean it's not in the domain.\n\nLet me try x = 5, which is less than 5.5.\n\nCompute (5 - 3)^2 - (5 - 8)^2. That's (2)^2 - (-3)^2. Which is 4 - 9 = -5. Which is negative, so indeed, g(5) is not a real number. Therefore, x = 5 is not in the domain. So 5.5 is the smallest x where the expression becomes non-negative.\n\nWait, let's test x = 5.5 to see what we get.\n\nCompute (5.5 - 3)^2 - (5.5 - 8)^2. That's (2.5)^2 - (-2.5)^2. 6.25 - 6.25 = 0. So sqrt(0) is 0, which is allowed. So at x = 11/2, the function is defined and gives zero. Perfect.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the domain is x ≥ 11/2, so the smallest real number is 11/2.\n\nI think that's pretty thorough. I tried two different methods to factor the expression, both confirmed the same result. I also tested a value below 11/2 to make sure it's not allowed. So I'm confident that the answer is 11/2.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of the function \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \\), we need to"
