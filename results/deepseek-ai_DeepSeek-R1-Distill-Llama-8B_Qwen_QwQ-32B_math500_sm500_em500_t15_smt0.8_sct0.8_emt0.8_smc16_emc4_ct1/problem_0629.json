            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2]. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the domain of a function includes all the possible x-values for which the function is defined. Since this is a square root function, the expression inside the square root needs to be non-negative. So, I need to make sure that (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 is greater than or equal to zero.\n\nAlright, let me write that down: (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0. Hmm, this looks like a difference of squares. I remember that a difference of squares can be factored as (a + b)(a - b). So, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me try that.\n\nLet’s set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). Then, (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 becomes a^2 - b^2, which factors into (a + b)(a - b). So, substituting back in, it would be ( (x - 3) + (x - 8) ) times ( (x - 3) - (x - 8) ). Let me simplify each part.\n\nFirst, the first part: (x - 3) + (x - 8) = x - 3 + x - 8 = 2x - 11. The second part: (x - 3) - (x - 8) = x - 3 - x + 8 = 5. So, putting it together, the expression simplifies to (2x - 11)(5). So, 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0.\n\nAlright, so now we have 5*(2x - 11) ≥ 0. Since 5 is a positive constant, I can divide both sides of the inequality by 5 without changing the direction of the inequality. So, that gives me 2x - 11 ≥ 0.\n\nSolving for x, I add 11 to both sides: 2x ≥ 11. Then, divide both sides by 2: x ≥ 11/2."

            "output": " So, x is greater than or equal to 5.5. That means the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x such that x is at least 5.5. But the question is asking for the smallest real number x in the domain. So, that should be 11/2, which is 5.5, right?\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check my factoring to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original expression is (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Factoring as (a + b)(a - b) where a = x - 3 and b = x - 8. So, a + b is (x - 3) + (x - 8) = 2x - 11, and a - b is (x - 3) - (x - 8) = 5. So, yes, that's correct. So, the expression becomes (2x - 11)*5 ≥ 0.\n\nSince 5 is positive, it doesn't affect the inequality, so 2x - 11 ≥ 0. So, x ≥ 11/2. So, 11/2 is 5.5. Therefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 11/2.\n\nHmm, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem just to confirm. Alternatively, I could have expanded the squares first and then subtracted. Let me try that method too, just to make sure.\n\nSo, expanding (x - 3)^2 gives x^2 - 6x + 9, and expanding (x - 8)^2 gives x^2 - 16x + 64. Then, subtracting those, we have (x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) = x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64. Let me compute term by term: x^2 - x^2 cancels out, -6x + 16x is 10x, and 9 - 64 is -55. So, the expression inside the square root simplifies to 10x - 55.\n\nTherefore, 10x - 55 ≥ 0. Solving for x, add 55 to both sides"

            "output": ": 10x ≥ 55. Divide both sides by 10: x ≥ 11/2, which is 5.5. So, same result as before. So, that confirms my previous answer.\n\nWait, so both methods give me x ≥ 11/2, so the smallest x is 11/2. I think that's solid. So, yeah, the answer should be 11/2, which is 5.5. So, in boxed form, that would be \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me pick a value less than 5.5 and see if it's negative. Let's say x = 5. Then, (5 - 3)^2 = 4, and (5 - 8)^2 = 9. So, 4 - 9 = -5, which is negative. So, sqrt(-5) is not a real number, which means x=5 is not in the domain. What about x=6? (6-3)^2=9, (6-8)^2=4, so 9 - 4 = 5, which is positive. So, g(6)=sqrt(5), which is real. Similarly, x=11/2 is 5.5. Let me compute that: (5.5 - 3)^2 = (2.5)^2=6.25, and (5.5 - 8)^2= (-2.5)^2=6.25. So, 6.25 - 6.25=0. So, sqrt(0)=0, which is defined. Thus, x=5.5 is the smallest x where the expression inside the square root is zero, and for any x larger than that, it's positive. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I checked using both factoring and expanding, and both methods led me to the same conclusion, and I even tested specific values to confirm. So, confident that 11/2 is the correct smallest x in the domain.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of the function \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \\), we need to ensure the expression inside the square root is non-negative.\n\nFirst"
