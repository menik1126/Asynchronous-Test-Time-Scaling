That sounds complicated because it involves complex numbers and rational functions. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that each term on the left side has a similar structure: a constant numerator and a denominator that's a quadratic expression. Specifically, each denominator is of the form \\(x^2 - k\\), where k is 1, 2, 3, or 4. The numerators are 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. The right side is a linear function: \\(2010x - 4\\).\n\nSince this equation involves both polynomial and rational functions, maybe I can simplify or manipulate it to make it more manageable. One common approach is to find a common denominator for all the terms on the left side. If I can combine them into a single fraction, maybe I can cross-multiply or bring everything to one side to form a polynomial equation.\n\nLet me write down the denominators: \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). I notice that these are all similar, just differing by the constant term. That might be useful later.\n\nSo, the left-hand side (LHS) can be written as:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{(x^2 - 1)} + \\frac{2}{(x^2 - 2)} + \\frac{3}{(x^2 - 3)} + \\frac{4}{(x^2 - 4)}.\\]\n\nTo combine these, I need the common denominator, which would be the product of all four denominators: \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). That seems quite complicated, but maybe it's manageable if I proceed carefully.\n\nSo, if I take each term and multiply numerator and denominator by the appropriate factors to reach the common denominator,"

Then set that equal to the right-hand side (RHS), which is \\(2010x - 4\\), and then bring everything to one side to have a numerator equal to zero.\n\nHowever, this seems like a lot of algebra and might get messy. Maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nAlternatively, I could consider substituting \\(y = x^2\\). Since each term on the LHS is in terms of \\(x^2\\), this substitution might simplify things. Let me try that.\n\nLet \\(y = x^2\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\\]\n\nHmm, but substituting \\(y = x^2\\) still leaves the RHS with an \\(x\\), not a \\(y\\). That complicates things because the RHS is linear in \\(x\\), but the LHS is now in terms of \\(y\\), which is a function of \\(x^2\\). That might not help much. Unless I can find a relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). Maybe this substitution isn't the best approach here.\n\nWait, perhaps another idea: Let me consider moving all terms to one side so that I can set the equation to zero. Let me write:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\\]\n\nNow, if I can write this entire expression as a rational function, then the solutions to this equation are the roots of that numerator set to zero. The sum of all complex solutions (roots) would be related to the coefficients of the polynomial via Vieta's formula, provided that I can form the polynomial equation.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the equation includes both rational terms and a linear term in x, so combining them into a single polynomial may require cross-multiplying, which could lead to a very high-degree polynomial.

So, yeah, each term is \\( \\frac{k}{x^2 - k} \\).\n\nThis seems like a function that could be summed up, perhaps with some pattern or identity that can be exploited. Alternatively, perhaps I can write each term as a partial fraction or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that each term can be rewritten as \\( \\frac{k}{(x - \\sqrt{k})(x + \\sqrt{k})} \\). Maybe that's helpful? I can try partial fractions decomposition on each term.\n\nWait, but partial fractions are typically used when you have a rational function that can be expressed as a sum of simpler fractions. In this case, each term is already a simple fraction with denominator quadratic. But perhaps if I consider the entire sum as a single fraction, maybe there's a telescoping or some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} +"

The sum of the roots of this polynomial (counting multiplicity) is given by the negative coefficient of the second-highest degree term divided by the leading coefficient, according to Vieta's formula. However, since the equation is a rational function, we have to be careful about the denominator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross-multiplying to form a polynomial equation. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote the left-hand side (LHS) as:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x -4.\\]\n\nLet me first compute the left-hand side as a single fraction.

Let me try to see what degree we would get.\n\nFirst, N is the sum of four terms, each of which is a polynomial of degree 6: because each term is the product of three quadratic factors, so 3 quadratics make degree 6.\n\nSimilarly, multiplying (2010x -4) with another quadratic term (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4). So, (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4) is a quartic (degree 8) polynomial. Multiplying by (2010x -4) gives a degree 9 polynomial.\n\nSo, when we subtract N (which is a degree 6 polynomial) from (2010x -4)*(x^8 + ...) (which is degree 9), the resulting polynomial will be degree 9.\n\nTherefore, the equation is a 9th-degree polynomial equation. So, there are 9 roots (counting multiplicity) in the complex plane.\n\nBut, the question is asking for the sum of all complex solutions. So, if I can find the sum of the roots of this 9th-degree polynomial, that would be the answer.\n\nFrom Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots of a polynomial equation \\(a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_0 =0\\) is equal to \\(-a_{n-1}/a_n\\).\n\nTherefore, I need to find the coefficients \\(a_9\\) and \\(a_8\\) of the polynomial equation I derived earlier, and then compute \\(-a_8 / a_9"

Maybe there's a smarter way to find the coefficients without expanding everything?\n\nLet me think. Let me denote the polynomial as P(x) = N - (2010x -4)*D1 D2 D3 D4 = 0.\n\nWe need to find the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in P(x).\n\nFirst, let's note that the leading term of D1 D2 D3 D4 is (x²)^4 = x^8. So, D1 D2 D3 D4 is a degree 8 polynomial with leading term x^8. Then, multiplying by (2010x -4) gives a polynomial with leading term 2010x * x^8 = 2010x^9. So, the leading term of the second part is 2010x^9, and the next term is -4x^8.\n\nOn the other hand, the numerator N is a sum of four terms, each of which is a product of three quadratics. Each term in N is of degree 6, so the leading term of each term in N is x^6. Let's compute the leading coefficients of each term in N:\n\nFirst term: 1*(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4). The leading term is 1*(x²)^3 = x^6.\n\nSecond term: 2*(x² -1)(x² -3)(x² -4). Leading term is 2*(x²)^3 = 2x^6.\n\nThird term: 3*(x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -4). Leading term is 3*(x²)^3 = 3x^6.\n\nFourth term: 4*(x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3). Leading term is 4*(x²)^3 = 4x^6.\n\nTherefore, the total leading term of N is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)x^6 = 10x^6.\n\nTherefore, the leading term of N is 10x^6, so when we subtract (2010x -4)*D1 D2 D3 D4 ("

So, N has x^6 as the highest degree term. Therefore, in the polynomial P(x) = N - (2010x -4)*D1 D2 D3 D4, the only x^8 term comes from the expansion of (2010x -4)*D1 D2 D3 D4, because N doesn't have an x^8 term. Therefore, in P(x), the coefficient of x^9 is -2010 (from the second term, because the first term N has no x^9), and the coefficient of x^8 is just the coefficient of x^8 in (2010x -4)*D1 D2 D3 D4.\n\nWait, hold on.

Therefore, the sum of all solutions to the original equation is equal to the sum of all roots of P(x) minus the sum of excluded roots.\n\nWait, that complicates things. Because if I directly compute the sum of all roots of P(x), which includes the extraneous roots, but the original equation doesn't include those. Therefore, I need to adjust the sum accordingly.\n\nTherefore, first, let's compute the sum of all roots of P(x) (including extraneous roots), then subtract the sum of the roots at the excluded values.\n\nSo, to compute the sum of all roots of P(x): as we've found, it is 2/1005.\n\nNow, the extraneous roots are x=1, -1, √2, -√2, √3, -√3, 2, -2.\n\nSo, we have 8 extraneous roots (x=±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2).

So, even though they are roots of P(x), their contributions to the sum cancel each other out. Therefore, the total sum remains the same as the sum of the roots of P(x).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me check again if I made any mistake in the calculation of coefficients.\n\nFirst, the leading term of P(x) is -2010x^9, so a_9 = -2010.\n\nThe coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is 4, so a_8 =4.\n\nTherefore, sum of roots is -a_8/a_9 = -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to see this without going through all the polynomial expansion?\n\nLet me think. The original equation is:\n\nSum_{k=1}^4 [k/(x² -k)] = 2010x -4.\n\nSuppose we let y = x². Then, the left-hand side becomes Sum_{k=1}^4 [k/(y -k)].\n\nBut the right-hand side is 2010x -4, which still has an x term. So, unless we can relate x to y, this substitution might not help. However, perhaps if we consider that the equation is not symmetric in x and -x, so maybe the solutions come in pairs?\n\nWait, but the equation is not symmetric. For example, if x is a solution, then -x is not necessarily a solution, because the RHS is 2010x -4, which is not an even function. Therefore, the solutions are not symmetric, so their sum can't be directly inferred from symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be manipulated in another way. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I denote f(x) = LHS - RHS = 0.\n\nThen, f(x) = [1/(x² -1) + 2/(x² -2) + 3/(x² -3) +4/(x² -4)] -2010x"
