Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst off, I notice that the left side has four fractions, each with a linear numerator and a quadratic denominator. The right side is a linear function of x. Maybe I can find a substitution or transformation that simplifies this equation. \n\nLooking at the denominators, they are all of the form \\(x^2 - k\\), where k is 1, 2, 3, or 4. That makes me think of partial fractions or maybe some symmetry. Wait, perhaps I can rewrite each term to make it easier to handle. \n\nLet me consider each fraction individually:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1}\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x + 1)}\\).\n2. \\(\\frac{2}{x^2 - 2}\\) is \\(\\frac{2}{(x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})}\\).\n3. \\(\\frac{3}{x^2 - 3}\\) is \\(\\frac{3}{(x - \\sqrt{3})(x + \\sqrt{3})}\\).\n4. \\(\\frac{4}{x^2 - 4}\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{(x - 2)(x + 2)}\\).\n\nHmm, each of these can be expressed using partial fractions. Maybe that will help me sum them up or find a pattern. Let me try that.\n\nFor each term, I can write:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x + 1)} = \\frac{A}{x - 1} + \\frac{B}{x + 1}\\).\n2. \\(\\frac{2}{(x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{C}{x - \\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{D}{x + \\sqrt{"

But that seems like a lot of work. Is there a smarter way?\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can let \\(y = x^2\\).

Maybe another substitution? \n\nAlternatively, since the equation is a sum of four rational functions equal to a linear function, perhaps I can consider that the left side is a function that can be expressed as a linear function plus a constant or something. Let me think.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe I can consider that the left side can be written as a sum where each term is of the form \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n^2}\\). So, for n = 1, 2, 3, 4. That might hint at a telescoping series or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function on the left can be expressed as a derivative of some function. That sometimes helps in integrating or differentiating to find patterns.\n\nLet me try that. Let me consider the derivative of \\( \\ln(x^2 - k) \\). The derivative is \\( \\frac{2x}{x^2 - k} \\). But that's not quite matching the terms I have, which are constants over \\(x^2 -k\\). \n\nHmm, maybe let's think of the function as a sum of terms each of the form \\( \\frac{n}{x^2 - n^2} \\).

That might be messy, but let's see.\n\nThe denominators on the left are \\(x^2 -1\\), \\(x^2 -2\\), \\(x^2 -3\\), \\(x^2 -4\\). The common denominator would be the product of all four denominators. That's going to be a huge polynomial. Maybe that's too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe move all terms to one side and set the equation equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThen, perhaps factor this equation? But factoring such a complex expression seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the left-hand side (LHS) is a function that's even in x?

The right-hand side (RHS) is \\(2010(-x) -4 = -2010x -4\\), which is not even. Therefore, the equation is not symmetric in x and -x, so solutions might not come in pairs. Hmm, so maybe that approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the equation is of high degree, so maybe the sum of roots can be found using Vieta's formula? But to do that, I need to write the equation as a polynomial equation and then find the sum of all roots. Since the problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions, Vieta's formula might be the way to go here.\n\nSo, let's try to clear denominators and turn this into"

Now, I need to find the coefficient of x^8 in P(x).\n\nIn the Sum terms, as discussed earlier, each term is degree 6, so the coefficient of x^8 in Sum terms is 0.\n\nIn the (2010x -4)*D term, the coefficient of x^8 is -4, as we saw.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is:\n\n0 (from Sum terms) - (-4) (from -(2010x -4)*D) = +4.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nP(x) = Sum terms - (2010x -4)*D.\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is:\n\ncoefficient of x^8 in Sum terms - coefficient of x^8 in (2010x -4)*D.\n\nFrom Sum terms: each term is up to x^6, so coefficient of x^8 is 0.\n\nFrom (2010x -4)*D: coefficient of x^8 is -4 (from -4x^8).\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is 0 - (-4) = +4.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of x^9 in P(x) is -2010.\n\nTherefore, P(x) is a degree 9 polynomial with leading term -2010x^9 and coefficient of x^8 equal to +4. Hence, the sum of the roots is - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9) = -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010.\n\nSimplify 4/2010: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 2/1005.\n\nSo, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\nWait, let me verify this again.\n\nYes, P(x) is -2010x^9 +4x^8 + ... =0.\n\nSo, in standard form: -2010x^9 +4x"

But in the polynomial as written, the coefficient of x^8 is +4, and coefficient of x^9 is -2010.\n\nWait, actually, Vieta's formula for a monic polynomial says that the sum of roots is - (coefficient of x^{n-1}) / (coefficient of x^n). But in this case, the polynomial is not monic; it's leading coefficient is -2010.\n\nSo, the formula is: if polynomial is a x^n + b x^{n-1} + ... + k =0, then sum of roots is -b/a.\n\nIn our case, P(x) = -2010x^9 +4x^8 + ... =0.\n\nSo, a = -2010, b =4. Therefore, sum of roots is -b/a = -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\nThat seems correct. Let me double-check my steps.\n\n1. I noted that the equation is a combination of rational functions equal to a linear term.\n\n2. I considered clearing denominators by multiplying both sides by the common denominator, which is a degree 8 polynomial.\n\n3. This led to a polynomial P(x) which is degree 9, because (2010x -4)*D is degree 9, and the other terms are up to degree 6.\n\n4. I found the leading term of P(x) is -2010x^9.\n\n5. To find the coefficient of x^8, I expanded (2010x -4)*D and found that the coefficient of x^8 is -4.\n\n6. Since the Sum terms do not contribute to x^8, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is +4.\n\n7. Then, applying Vieta's formula, the sum of roots is - (coefficient of x^8) / (coefficient of x^9) = -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010"
