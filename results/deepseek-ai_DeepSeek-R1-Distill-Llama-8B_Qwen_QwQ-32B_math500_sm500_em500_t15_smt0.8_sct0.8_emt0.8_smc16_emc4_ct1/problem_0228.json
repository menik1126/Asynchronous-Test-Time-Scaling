            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where Bill is walking in different directions, and I need to figure out how far he is from his starting point in a straight line. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Bill walks half a mile south. Hmm, okay, so that's straightforward. If I imagine a coordinate system where I'm starting at the origin (0,0), walking south would decrease my y-coordinate. So after walking 1/2 mile south, I would be at (0, -1/2). I'm assuming east is the positive x-direction and north is the positive y-direction, so south is negative y.\n\nNext, he walks 3/4 mile east. East is the positive x-direction, so I add 3/4 to my x-coordinate. So now, my position is (3/4, -1/2). That makes sense because he's moving east, so only the x-value changes.\n\nThen, finally, he walks another 1/2 mile south. That means I subtract another 1/2 from my y-coordinate. So now, my position is (3/4, -1/2 - 1/2), which simplifies to (3/4, -1). \n\nSo, after all this walking, Bill is at (3/4, -1). Now, I need to find the straight-line distance from his starting point, which is at (0,0). I remember from the distance formula that the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].\n\nApplying that here, the distance D would be sqrt[(3/4 - 0)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2]. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, (3/4)^2 is 9/16, which is 0.5625. Then, (-1)^2 is 1. So adding those together, 0.5625 + 1 gives me 1.5625. \n\nNow, taking the square root of 1.5625. Hmm, I know that sqrt(1.5625) is 1.25 because 1.25 times 1.25 is 1.5625. So, the distance is 1.25 miles.\n\nWait, let me double-check to"

            "output": " make sure I didn't make a mistake in the coordinates. Let's see:\n\nStarting at (0,0). South 1/2 mile: (0, -0.5). Then east 3/4: (0.75, -0.5). Then south another 1/2 mile: (0.75, -1). Yep, that's correct. So the coordinates are right. \n\nCalculating the distance again: sqrt(0.75^2 + (-1)^2). 0.75 squared is 0.5625, plus 1 is 1.5625. Square root of that is indeed 1.25. \n\nSo, converting that to a decimal, it's already 1.25, which is to the nearest hundredth. So the answer should be 1.25 miles. \n\nWait, but the question says \"to the nearest hundredth.\" Since 1.25 is exact, there's no rounding needed. So I think that's the answer. Let me just confirm once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should write all steps in fractions first to see if there's another way. Let's see:\n\nThe coordinates are (3/4, -1). The distance squared is (3/4)^2 + (1)^2 (since distance is squared, the negative doesn't matter). \n\n(3/4)^2 = 9/16, and 1^2 = 16/16. So total is 25/16. The square root of 25/16 is 5/4, which is 1.25. Yep, that's the same. \n\nOkay, so I think that's solid. The answer is 1.25 miles. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{1.25}\n</think>\n\nBill starts at the origin (0,0). \n\n1. He walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south, moving to \\((0, -\\frac{1}{2})\\).\n2.
