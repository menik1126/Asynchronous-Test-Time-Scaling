Adding these gives a total southward distance of 1 mile.\n\n2. **Determine the Eastward Distance:**\n   He walks 3/4 mile east.\n\n3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   The displacement forms a right triangle with sides of 1 mile and 3/4 mile. Using the theorem, the direct distance is the square root of (1^2 + (3/4)^2).\n\n4. **Compute the Square Root:**\n   (1)^2 is 1, and (3/4)^2 is 0.5625. Adding these gives 1.5625. The square root of 1.5625 is exactly 1.25 miles.\n\n5. **Round the Answer:**\n   To the nearest hundredth, 1.25 miles is already precise.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how far Bill is from his starting point, we'll break down his movements and use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Southward Distance**\n- **First Southward Movement:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile\n- **Second Southward Movement:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile\n- **Total Southward Distance:** \n  \\[\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Eastward Distance**\n- **Eastward Movement:** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe displacement forms a right-angled triangle with:\n- **Opposite Side (South):** \\( 1 \\) mile\n- **Adjacency Side (East):** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile\n- **Hypotenuse (Direct Line Distance):** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left(1\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 0.5625} = \\sqrt{1.5625} ="
