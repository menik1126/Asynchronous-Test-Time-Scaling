            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\nTo do that, I'll start by determining the prime factorization of 284.\n\n284 divided by 2 equals 142, so 2 is a prime factor.\n\nNext, I divide 142 by 2 to get 71, which is a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of 284 are 2² and 71¹.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \\((2 + 2 + 71) \\times (1 + 1)\\), I get 75 × 2 = 150. This includes all divisors, including 284 itself.\n\nTo find the sum of the proper divisors, I subtract 284 from 150, resulting in 74.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 74.\n\nFirst, I factorize 74. It's divisible by 2, giving 37, which is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 74 are 2¹ and 37¹.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again, \\((2 + 2 + 37) × (1 + 1)\\) equals 41 × 2 = 82. This includes all divisors, including 74 itself.\n\nFinally, I subtract 74 from 82 to get the sum of the proper divisors, which is 8.\n\nSo, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 8.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:** Find the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\n**Step 1: Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n\n1. **Determine the prime factorization of 284:**\n   - 284 ÷ 2 = 142\n   - 142 ÷ 2 = 71\n   - 71 is a prime number.\n   \n   So, the prime factorization is \\( 284 = 2^2 \\times 71^1 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of all divisors (σ(284)):**\n   \\[\n   σ(284) = (2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2) \\times (71^0 + 71^1) = (1 + "
