Proper divisors are positive integers that divide 284 without leaving a remainder and are less than 284 itself. Let's list them:\n\n1, 2, 4, 71, 142\n\nNow, I'll sum these proper divisors:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of the number 220.\n\nThe proper divisors of 220 are:\n\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110\n\nAdding these together:\n\n1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 284.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Sum those proper divisors to get a new number.**\n3. **Find the proper divisors of that new number.**\n4. **Sum those new proper divisors to get the final answer.**\n\nLet's go through each step carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Proper Divisors of 284\n\nA **proper divisor** of a number \\( N \\) is a positive integer that divides \\( N \\) without leaving a remainder and is less than \\( N \\).\n\nLet's find all proper divisors of 284:\n\n1. Start by dividing 284 by small integers:\n\n   - \\( 284 \\div 1 = 284 \\) → 1 is a proper divisor.\n   - \\( 284 \\div 2 = 142 \\) → 2 is a proper divisor.\n   - \\( 284 \\div 4 = 71 \\) → 4 is a proper divisor.\n   - \\( 284 \\div 71 = 4 \\) → 71 is a proper divisor.\n   \n   Since 284 is even and we've found all its divisors from the list, the proper divisors of 284 are:\n   \n   \\[\n   1,"
