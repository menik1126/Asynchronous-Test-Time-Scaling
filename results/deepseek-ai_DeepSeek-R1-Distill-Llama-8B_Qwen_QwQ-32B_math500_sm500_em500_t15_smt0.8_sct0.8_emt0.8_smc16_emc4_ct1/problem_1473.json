Since the index of the cube root is 3, I can take the cube root of the denominator directly, resulting in 1/9.\n\nNext, I'll consider the square root of this simplified fraction. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 9 is 3. So, the square root of 1/9 is 1/3.\n\nFinally, I'll take the square root of the result. The square root of 1 is still 1, and the square root of 3 remains \u221a3. Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression with a rational denominator is 1 over \u221a3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\\) and write the result with a rational denominator, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Innermost Radical\nStart by simplifying the innermost cube root.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, recognize that \\(729 = 9^3\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9^3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{9^3}} = \\frac{1}{9^{3/2}} = \\frac{1}{9 \\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{1}{9 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{27}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Substitute Back into the Original Expression\nNow, substitute the result back into the original expression.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the cube root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{3^3}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Take the Square Root of the Result\nFinally, take the square root of the result from the previous step.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\"
