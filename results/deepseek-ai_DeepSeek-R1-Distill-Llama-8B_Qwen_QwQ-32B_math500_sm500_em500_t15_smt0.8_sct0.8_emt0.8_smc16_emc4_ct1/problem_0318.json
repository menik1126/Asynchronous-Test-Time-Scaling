Hmm, let me start by recalling what vertical and horizontal asymptotes mean.\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero but the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I should factor the denominator to find where it equals zero.\n\nThe denominator is x² - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring it. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, 2 and -7? Because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. So, yes, that factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the denominator is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x - 7 = 0, which means x = -2 and x = 7. Since these are the roots, and since neither the numerator is zero at these points (let me check: numerator is 2x. At x = -2, it's -4, not zero, and at x = 7, it's 14, not zero), these are indeed vertical asymptotes. So, a = -2 and b = 7. That gives a + b = -2 + 7 = 5.\n\nNow, moving on to the horizontal asymptote. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The degree of the numerator here is 1 (from 2x), and the degree of the denominator is 2 (from x² -5x -14). The rule is that if the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients. If the numerator's degree is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote, but in this case, since the denominator is higher, y = 0 is the horizontal asymptote. So, c = 0. \n\nTherefore, a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the vertical asymptotes \\( a \\)"
