Looking at the table, the 70s row has the following prices: 12, 12, 6, and 13 cents.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total number of 70s stamps by counting the number of entries in the 70s row. There are 4 stamps in total.\n\nThen, I'll find the sum of the prices of these 70s stamps by adding each price together: 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 cents.\n\nAfter that, I'll use the total number of stamps to find the average price by dividing the total sum by the number of stamps: 43 ÷ 4 = 10.75 cents.\n\nFinally, I'll round this average price to the nearest tenth of a cent, which is 10.8 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo find the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the prices of the 70s stamps:**\n   - **12** cents\n   - **12** cents\n   - **6** cents\n   - **13** cents\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of 70s stamps:**\n   - There are **4** stamps in the 70s.\n\n3. **Compute the total price of the 70s stamps:**\n   - Sum of the prices = **12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43** cents.\n\n4. **Find the average price:**\n   - **Average price = Total price ÷ Number of stamps = 43 ÷ 4 = 10.75** cents.\n\n5. **Round to the nearest tenth of a cent:**\n   - **10.75** rounds to **10.8** cents.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{10.8}"
