We need to find the vertical asymptotes, which are \\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\), and the horizontal asymptote \\( y = c \\). Then, we have to add them together \\( a + b + c \\).\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero (as long as the numerator isn't also zero there). So, I need to factor the denominator \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\) to find its roots.\n\nLet me try factoring it. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, the factors of -14 are:\n\n1 and -14 (1 + (-14) = -13)\n2 and -7 (2 + (-7) = -5). Oh, that works!\n\nSo, the denominator factors as \\( (x + 2)(x - 7) \\). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). So, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\nNext, horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. When the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). But wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me recall: The horizontal asymptote rules are:\n\n- If degree numerator < degree denominator: HA is y=0.\n\n- If degree numerator = degree denominator: HA is y = ratio of leading coefficients.\n\n- If degree numerator > degree denominator: HA is y = ratio of leading coefficients.\n\nSo in this case, numerator is 1, denominator is 2. So HA is y=0. Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nWait, but sometimes I might be mixing up. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, for \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 -5x -14} \\), as x approaches infinity, the function behaves like \\( \\frac{2x}{x^2} = \\frac{2}{x} \\), which approaches 0. So y=0 is indeed the"

Let me factor it correctly: (x +2)(x -7). So roots at x = -2 and 7. That's correct.\n\nHorizontal asymptote: since denominator is degree 2, numerator is degree 1, so yes, HA is y=0. So c=0.\n\nSo adding a, b, c: -2 +7 +0=5.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just think if I missed anything.\n\nIs there a chance that the horizontal asymptote is not y=0? Suppose I didn't remember correctly. Let's do the limit.\n\nLimit as x approaches infinity of f(x) is limit of 2x / x^2 = 2/x, which is 0. So yes, horizontal asymptote is y=0.\n\nSo, a + b + c = -2 +7 +0=5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\).\n\n1. **Finding Vertical Asymptotes:**\n   - Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero. We factor the denominator:\n     \\[\n     x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7)\n     \\]\n   - The roots are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). So, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\n2. **Finding Horizontal Asymptote:**\n   - The horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Therefore,"
