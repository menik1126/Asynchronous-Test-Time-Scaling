The factors of -14 that add up to -5 are -7 and 2. \n\nSo, the denominator factors to \\( (x - 7)(x + 2) \\). \n\nThis means the vertical asymptotes are at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). \n\nNext, to find the horizontal asymptote, I'll consider the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is of degree 1 and the denominator is of degree 2, which means the horizontal asymptote will be in the form \\( y = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum \\( a + b + c \\) is \\( 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**1. Finding Vertical Asymptotes**\n\nA vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator of the function equals zero (provided the numerator doesn't also equal zero at the same point).\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\n\\]\n\nFirst, factor the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)\n\\]\n\nSo, the vertical asymptotes are at:\n\n\\[\nx = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -2\n\\]\n\nLet \\( a = 7 \\) and \\( b = -2 \\).\n\n**2. Finding Horizontal Asymptote**\n\nA horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator:\n\n- If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\).\n- If the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Degree of numerator = 1\n- Degree of denominator = 2\n\nSince the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is:\n\n\\[\ny = 0\n\\]\n\nLet \\( c = 0 \\).\n\n**3.
