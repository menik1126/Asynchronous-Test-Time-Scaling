Therefore, its area is:\nA_X = 49π - 36π = 13π.\n\nRegion Y is between the middle circle (radius 6) and the smallest circle (radius 4). Its area is:\nA_Y = 36π - 16π = 20π.\n\nRegion Z is the area of the smallest circle (radius 4), which is:\nA_Z = 16π.\n\nTo find the difference between the largest and smallest areas, I will subtract the area of region Z from the area of region X:\nDifference = A_X - A_Z = 13π - 16π = -3π.\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the positive difference, I will take the absolute value:\nPositive Difference = |13π - 16π| = 3π.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the area of the region with the greatest area and the area of the region with the smallest area is 3π.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step to determine the difference between the area of the largest region and the smallest region.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Area of Each Circle**\n\nThe formula to find the area of a circle is:\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n\n1. **Largest Circle (Radius = 7):**\n   \\[ A_1 = \\pi (7)^2 = 49\\pi \\]\n\n2. **Middle Circle (Radius = 6):**\n   \\[ A_2 = \\pi (6)^2 = 36\\pi \\]\n\n3. **Smallest Circle (Radius"

The largest is Y (20π), and the smallest is X (13π). The difference is \\( 20π - 13π = 7π \\). Wait, my previous conclusion was incorrect. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, in my initial reasoning, I thought the smallest was Z (16π) but actually, Region X is 13π, which is smaller than Z (16π). So the largest is Y (20π), smallest is X (13π). The difference is 20π - 13π = 7π. But let me confirm again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the difference between the area of the region with the greatest area and the area of the region with the smallest area\".\n\nRegions:\n- X: 13π\n- Y: 20π\n- Z: 16π\n\nGreatest area is Y (20π"
