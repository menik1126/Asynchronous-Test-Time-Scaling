That calculation gives me 4\u03c0.\n\nRegion Y is between the middle circle (radius 6) and the outer circle (radius 7), so its area is the difference between these two circles, which results in 2\u03c0.\n\nFinally, Region Z is located between the outer circle (radius 7) and the middle circle (radius 6). However, since this area is larger, it's actually the area of the outer circle minus the middle circle, which is 2\u03c0.\n\nComparing all three regions, the largest area is 4\u03c0, and the smallest area is 0. Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest areas is 4\u03c0.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the difference between the area of the region with the greatest area and the area of the region with the smallest area, let's analyze each region step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Areas of Each Region:**\n   - **Region X:** This region lies between the innermost circle (radius 4) and the middle circle (radius 6).\n     - **Area of Region X:**  \n       \\[\n       \\text{Area}_X = \\text{Area of middle circle} - \\text{Area of inner circle} = \\pi \\times 6^2 - \\pi \\times 4^2 = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\n       \\]\n   \n   - **Region Y:** This region lies between the middle circle (radius 6) and the outer circle (radius 7).\n     - **Area of Region Y:**  \n       \\[\n       \\text{Area}_Y = \\text{Area of outer circle} - \\text{Area of middle circle} = \\pi \\times 7^2 - \\pi \\times 6^2 = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n       \\]\n   \n   - **Region Z:** This region lies between the outer circle (radius 7) and the middle circle (radius 6).\n     - **Area of Region Z:**  \n"
