This gives me 4d = 400, so d = 100.\n\nNow that I know the common difference d is 100, I can substitute this value back into the first equation to find a₁:\na₁ + 3(100) = 200\na₁ + 300 = 200\na₁ = -100\n\nWith the first term known, I can now find the sixth term (a₆). Using the general formula:\na₆ = a₁ + 5d\na₆ = -100 + 5(100)\na₆ = -100 + 500\na₆ = 400\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nIf the fourth term of an arithmetic sequence is $200$ and the eighth term is $500$, what is the sixth term?\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Formula for an Arithmetic Sequence**\n\nAn arithmetic sequence is defined by the formula:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(a_n\\) is the \\(n\\)-th term,\n- \\(a_1\\) is the first term,\n- \\(d\\) is the common difference,\n- \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Equations Using the Given Information**\n\nWe are given:\n- The fourth term (\\(a_4\\)) is $200$.\n- The eighth term (\\(a_8\\)) is $500$.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\na_4 = a_1 + (4 - 1)d = a_1 + 3d = 200 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1"
