The nth term of the sequence can be expressed as:\n\na\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n - 1)d\n\nGiven that the fourth term (a\u2084) is 200 and the eighth term (a\u2088) is 500, I can set up two equations based on the formula:\n\na\u2084 = a\u2081 + 3d = 200\na\u2088 = a\u2081 + 7d = 500\n\nNext, I'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate a\u2081:\n\n(a\u2081 + 7d) - (a\u2081 + 3d) = 500 - 200\nThis simplifies to:\n4d = 300\nTherefore, d = 75\n\nNow that I have the common difference, I can find a\u2081 by plugging d back into the first equation:\n\na\u2081 + 3(75) = 200\na\u2081 + 225 = 200\nSo, a\u2081 = -25\n\nFinally, to find the sixth term (a\u2086), I'll use the formula again with n = 6:\n\na\u2086 = a\u2081 + 5d\nSubstituting the known values:\na\u2086 = -25 + 5(75)\na\u2086 = -25 + 375\na\u2086 = 350\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- The fourth term (\\(a_4\\)) of an arithmetic sequence is 200.\n- The eighth term (\\(a_8\\)) is 500.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\(d\\) be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.\n- \\(a_1\\) be the first term of the sequence.\n\n**Formulas to Use:**\n1. \\(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\\) \u2014 General formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Write the Equations for \\(a_4\\) and \\(a_8\\).**\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\na_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\\\\na_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\"
