Rotations of the seating are considered the same, so I need to fix one position to avoid counting identical rotations multiple times.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the circular nature of the table. Since rotations are equivalent, I can fix the position of one party to remove the circular symmetry. Let's fix the Independent's seat for simplicity because there's only one Independent, making it easier to manage.\n\nNext, I need to arrange the three blocks: the Democrats (D), Republicans (R), and the Independent (I). Since all members of each party must sit together, these blocks will be treated as single units. The number of ways to arrange these three units around the table is (3-1)! = 2! = 2. This accounts for the linear arrangement of the blocks, considering the circular table's rotational symmetry.\n\nHowever, within each party's block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange the members. Similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways as well. The Independent doesn't need any arrangement since there's only one person.\n\nMultiplying these possibilities together gives the total number of seating arrangements. That is, 2! (for the party blocks) multiplied by 5! (Democrats) and 5! (Republicans).\n\nTherefore, the total number of seating arrangements is 2! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5!.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the number of ways the Senate committee can be seated around a circular table, with all members of each party sitting together. The committee consists of:\n- 5 Democrats (D)\n- 5 Republicans (R)\n- 1 Independent (I)\n\n**Step 2: Treat Each Party as a Single Block**\n\nSince all members of a party must sit together, we can consider each party as a single \"block\" or \"unit.\" This means we will have three units to arrange around the table:\n1. Democrats (D)\n2. Republicans (R)\n3. Independent (I)\n\n**Step 3: Arrange the Blocks Around the Table**\n\nSince the table is circular, the number of ways to arrange \\("

Here, we have 3 blocks, so the number of arrangements is:\n\\[\n(3-1)! = 2! = 2\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Fixed Position of the Independent**\n\nTo account for rotational symmetry, we can fix the position of the Independent block. This removes rotational duplicates, so we no longer need to divide by the number of rotations. Fixing the Independent block leaves us with arranging the remaining two blocks (Democrats and Republicans) relative to the Independent. This can be done in:\n\\[\n2! = 2 \\text{ ways}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Arrange Members Within Each Party Block**\n\n- **Democrats**: There are 5 members, so they can be arranged among themselves in \\(5!\\) ways.\n- **Republicans**: Similarly, they can be arranged in \\(5!\\) ways.\n- **Independent**: Since there is only 1 member, there is \\(1!\\) way to arrange them.\n\n**Step 6: Multiply All Possibilities Together**\n\nThe total number of seating arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the blocks and the number of ways to arrange members within each block:\n\\[\n2! \\times 5! \\times 5! = 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 = 2 \\times 14400 = 28800\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{28800}"
