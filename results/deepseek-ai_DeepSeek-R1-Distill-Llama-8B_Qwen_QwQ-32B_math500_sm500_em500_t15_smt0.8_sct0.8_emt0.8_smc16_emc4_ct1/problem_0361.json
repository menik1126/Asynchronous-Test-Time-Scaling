            "output": "Okay, let me try to figure out this marble problem. So, the problem says that there's a bag with yellow and blue marbles. Initially, the ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. Then, if I add 5 blue marbles and remove 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3. The question is asking how many blue marbles were in the bag before adding the new ones.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. I think I need to set up some variables. Let me denote the number of blue marbles as B and the number of yellow marbles as Y. \n\nThe initial ratio is blue to yellow as 4:3, so that means B/Y = 4/3. Which also implies that B = (4/3)Y. Got that part. \n\nNow, after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new number of blue marbles is B + 5, and the new number of yellow marbles is Y - 3. The new ratio is 7:3, so (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3. \n\nSo, I have two equations now:\n\n1. B = (4/3)Y\n2. (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3\n\nI can substitute the first equation into the second one. So, replacing B with (4/3)Y in the second equation:\n\n[(4/3)Y + 5] / (Y - 3) = 7/3\n\nAlright, let's solve this equation for Y. First, I'll get rid of the denominator by multiplying both sides by (Y - 3):\n\n(4/3)Y + 5 = (7/3)(Y - 3)\n\nNow, let me distribute the 7/3 on the right side:\n\n(4/3)Y + 5 = (7/3)Y - 7\n\nHmm, now let's get all the Y terms on one side and the constants on the other. Let me subtract (4/3)Y from both sides:\n\n5 = (7/3)Y - (4/3)Y - 7\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n5 = (3/3)Y - 7\n5 = Y - 7\n\nNow, adding "

            "output": "7 to both sides:\n\n5 + 7 = Y\nY = 12\n\nSo, the number of yellow marbles was 12 initially. Now, using the first equation, B = (4/3)Y, so B = (4/3)*12 = 16\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Plugging Y=12 into B=(4/3)*12 gives B=16. That seems right.\n\nLet me verify the second part. After adding 5 blue marbles, B becomes 16 + 5 = 21. Removing 3 yellow marbles, Y becomes 12 - 3 = 9. Then the ratio is 21:9, which simplifies to 7:3. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of blue marbles before adding was 16.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem using straightforward algebra.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nLet \\( B \\) be the number of blue marbles and \\( Y \\) be the number of yellow marbles initially.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Ratios**\n\nGiven the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3, we can write:\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\implies B = \\frac{4}{3}Y\n\\]\n\nAfter adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio is 7:3:\n\\[\n\\frac{B + 5}{Y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute and Solve for Y**\n\nSubstitute \\( B = \\frac{4}{3}Y \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}Y + 5}{Y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by \\( Y - 3 \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{3}Y + 5 = \\frac{7}{3}(Y - 3)\n\\]\nMultiply through by 3 to clear the fractions:\n\\[\n4Y + 15 = 7(Y - 3)\n\\]\nExpand the right side:\n\\[\n4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21\n\\]\nRearrange terms:\n\\[\n15"
