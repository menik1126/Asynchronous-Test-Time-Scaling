I remember that when dealing with cubic equations, sometimes expanding them can be a way to go, but that might get messy. Maybe there's a smarter approach here.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to have it clear:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n\nHmm, I notice that the right-hand side is (2x - 10)^3, which seems related to the terms on the left. Maybe I can factor something out or find a substitution to simplify it.\n\nWait a minute, 2x - 10 can be factored as 2(x - 5). So, let's rewrite that:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = [2(x - 5)]^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\nHmm, that seems interesting. Now, I wonder if there's a way to express the left side in terms of (x - 5) or something related. Let me think differently.\n\nI remember that a^3 + b^3 can be factored as (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe I can apply that identity here. Let me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 7). So,\n\na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\n\nSo, the left side is (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Let me compute a + b first.\n\na + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\n\nOh, interesting! So, a + b = 2x - 10, which is exactly the term on the right side of the equation, raised to the third power. So, the equation becomes:\n\n(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (a + b)^3\n\nSince a + b ="

Let me see if there are any other possible solutions or if I've missed something.\n\nWait, in the process, I used the identity a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 -ab +b^2), which is correct. Then, substituted correctly.\n\nThen, the equation reduces to (2x -10)(something) = (2x -10)^3, so moving everything to the left gives (2x -10)(something - (2x -10)^2)=0.\n\nThen, (2x -10)^2 is 4x² -40x +100, so in the other factor, as above.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=3, x=5, and x=7.\n\nI think that's all. Maybe I can graph the function to check, but since it's a cubic equation, it can only have three real roots, which we have found.
