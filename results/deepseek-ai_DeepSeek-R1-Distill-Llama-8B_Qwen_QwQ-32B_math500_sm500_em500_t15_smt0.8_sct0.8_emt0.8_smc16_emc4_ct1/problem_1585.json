            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, it's a cubic equation, which I remember can sometimes be tricky because they have three roots. I'm not super confident about the best approach here, but let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try to simplify both sides as much as possible. Looking at the right side, (2x - 10)^3. I notice that 2x -10 is just 2 times (x - 5). So maybe I can write it as (2(x - 5))^3. Since (ab)^3 is a^3*b^3, that would be 2^3*(x - 5)^3, which is 8*(x - 5)^3. Okay, so the right side simplifies to 8*(x - 5)^3. That might be helpful.\n\nNow, let's look at the left side: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3. I wonder if I can combine these two terms somehow. Maybe expanding them would help. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or identity I can use.\n\nWait, I recall that sometimes when you have a sum of cubes, you can use the formula a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). But I'm not sure if that will help here because the right side is not just another cube, it's (2x -10)^3. Maybe I should try expanding both sides and see if I can bring everything to one side to solve.\n\nSo, let me try expanding the left side first. Let's expand (x - 3)^3. Using the binomial expansion: (a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3. So, for (x - 3)^3, it would be x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27.\n\nSimilarly, expanding (x - 7)^3: x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343. Now, adding these two together: (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21"

Let's combine like terms:\n\nx^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\n\n-9x^2 -21x^2 = -30x^2\n\n27x + 147x = 174x\n\n-27 -343 = -370\n\nSo the left side simplifies to 2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370.\n\nNow, the right side is (2x -10)^3. Let me expand that as well. Let's do it step by step. Let me write it as (2x -10)^3. Let me use the binomial expansion again:\n\n(a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3. Here, a = 2x, b = 10.\n\nSo, (2x)^3 - 3*(2x)^2*10 + 3*(2x)*(10)^2 - (10)^3.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(2x)^3 = 8x^3\n\n-3*(4x^2)*10 = -3*40x^2 = -120x^2\n\n3*(2x)*100 = 600x\n\n-1000\n\nSo altogether, the right side is 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.\n\nNow, the original equation is left side = right side, so:\n\n2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.\n\nLet me bring all terms to the left side by subtracting the right side from both sides:\n\n2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - (8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000) = 0\n\nCalculating term by term:\n\n2x^3 -8x^3 = -6x^3\n\n"

It might be better to make it monic (leading coefficient 1). Let's divide both sides by -6 to simplify.\n\n(-6x^3)/(-6) = x^3\n\n90x^2/(-6) = -15x^2\n\n-426x/(-6) = 71x\n\n630/(-6) = -105\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nx^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 = 0.\n\nOkay, now we have a cubic equation: x³ - 15x² +71x -105 = 0.\n\nI need to find the roots of this cubic. I remember that rational roots can be found using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. Since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are the factors of 105.\n\nFactors of 105 are: ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.\n\nLet me test these one by one. Starting with x=1:\n\n1³ -15(1)² +71(1) -105 = 1 -15 +71 -105 = (1-15) + (71-105) = (-14) + (-34) = -48 ≠ 0.\n\nNot a root.\n\nx=3:\n\n3³ -15(3)² +71(3) -105 = 27 -135 +213 -105.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n27 -135 = -108\n\n213 -105 = 108\n\n-108 + 108 = 0.\n\nYes! So x=3 is a root. Good.\n\nNow, since x=3 is a root, we can factor (x - 3) out of the cubic.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nLet me use synthetic division with x=3.\n\nCoefficients of the cubic: 1 (x³), -15 (x²), 71 (x), -105 (constant).\n\nSet up"
