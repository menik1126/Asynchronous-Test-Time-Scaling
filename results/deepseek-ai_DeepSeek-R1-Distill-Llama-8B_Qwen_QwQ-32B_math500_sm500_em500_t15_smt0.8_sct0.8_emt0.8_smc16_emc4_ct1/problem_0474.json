The equations given are:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with symmetric equations involving sums of powers, the identities related to symmetric polynomials come into play. So, let me denote the elementary symmetric sums:\n\n- \\( S = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\) (given)\n\nThese are the basic symmetric sums, and often, we can express higher powers in terms of these. Let me recall the formula for the sum of cubes:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q \\)\n\nWe know that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\) and \\( Q = 4 \\), so plugging in:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3 S P + 3 * 4 \\)\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3 S P + 12 \\)\n\nWait, that gives:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P = 4 - 12 = -8 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\) ...(Equation 1)\n\nNow, looking at the third equation:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, let me see if I can factor or rewrite this expression.\n\nLooking at each term:\n\n- \\( xy^2 \\) and \\( x^2 y \\) can be grouped as \\( xy(y + x) \\)\n- Similarly, \\( xz^2 \\) and \\( x^2 z \\) can be grouped as \\( xz(z + x) \\)\n- And \\( yz^2 \\"

So:\n\n- First term: \\( -xy z \\)\n- Second term: \\( -xz y \\) which is same as \\( -xy z \\)\n- Third term: \\( -yz x \\) same as \\( -xy z \\)\n\nSo altogether, that's \\( -3 xyz \\).\n\nSo overall:\n\n\\( S P - 3 xyz = 12 \\)\n\nBut we know that \\( xyz = 4 \\), so substituting:\n\n\\( S P - 3 * 4 = 12 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( S P - 12 = 12 \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( S P = 24 \\) ...(Equation 2)\n\nNow we have from Equation 1: \\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\)\n\nBut from Equation 2, \\( S P = 24 \\). So substitute into Equation 1:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 * 24 = -8 \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( S^3 - 72"

Then, I substituted \\( S = x + y + z \\) into \\( x + y = S - z \\), etc. Expanded correctly and then noticed that the cross terms give \\( -3xyz \\). Plugged in \\( xyz =4 \\), so indeed it becomes \\( -12 \\). \n\nThen, the equation became \\( S P -12 =12 \\), so \\( S P=24 \\). Then using the first equation, substituted \\( S P=24 \\) into \\( S^3 -3 S P= -8 \\), leading to \\( S^3=64 \\), so S=4, and then P=6. \n\nThat seems consistent. Let me check if all substitutions are correct.\n\nYes, the sum of cubes formula is correct: \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q \\). We had 4 on the left, 4 on the right from 3Q, then Equation 1: \\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\). Correct.\n\nThird equation was correctly manipulated, leading to Equation 2: \\( S P=24 \\). All the algebra steps look right. \n\nSo I think the answer is indeed 6.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given system of equations, we utilize symmetric polynomials and known identities.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nWe denote the elementary symmetric sums as:\n- \\( S = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( P = xy"
