The problem states:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to make sense of these equations. They all involve variables \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\), and each is a different degree. Maybe I can find a way to relate them using some algebraic identities.\n\nStarting with the first equation: \\( xyz = 4 \\). That's straightforward, the product of the three variables is 4.\n\nThe second equation is \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\). I remember that there's an identity for the sum of cubes. Specifically, \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\). That might be useful here. Since I know \\( xyz = 4 \\), I can substitute that into the identity.\n\nSo, plugging in, we have:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nFrom the second equation, \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\), so:\n\n\\( 4 - 3*4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nCalculating the left side: \\( 4 - 12 = -8 \\). So,\n\n\\( -8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nHmm, let me denote \\( S = x + y + z \\), \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\).\n\nAlso, I remember that \\( x"

Let me substitute that into the equation:\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\n\n\\( -8 = S*( (S^2 - 2P) - P ) \\)\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\n\\( (S^2 - 2P - P) = S^2 - 3P \\)\nThus,\n\\( -8 = S*(S^2 - 3P) \\)\nSo, \\( -8 = S^3 - 3SP \\)\n\nLet me write that as equation (4):\n\n4. \\( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \\)\n\nOkay, that's one equation involving S and P. I need more equations to solve for P.\n\nLooking at the third equation: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nThis looks a bit complex. Maybe I can factor it somehow. Let me try to group terms:\n\nGrouping terms with similar variables:\n\n- Terms with x: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z \\)\n- Terms with y: \\( yz^2 + y^2 z \\)\n\nWait, actually, maybe I can factor common terms:\n\nLooking at \\( xy^2 + x^2 y \\), I can factor out \\( xy \\):\n\n\\( xy(y + x) \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \\)\n\nAnd \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \\)\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\)\n\nHmm, that's a bit cleaner. Let me write that:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nI can also express these in terms of S, P, and maybe another variable. Let's see.\n\nSince \\( S = x + y + z \\), then \\( x + y = S - z \\), \\( x + z = S - y \\), and \\( y + z = S - x \\).\n\nSo substituting these into the equation:\n\n\\( xy(S - z) + x"
