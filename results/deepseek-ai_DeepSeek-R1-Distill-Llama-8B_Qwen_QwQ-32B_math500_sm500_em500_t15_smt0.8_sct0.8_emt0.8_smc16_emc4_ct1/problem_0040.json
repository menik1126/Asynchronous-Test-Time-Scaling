            "output": "First, I need to find the proper divisors of 284.\n\nTo do this, I'll start by determining the prime factors of 284. Since 284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. \n\nNext, I'll factorize 142. It's also even, so dividing by 2 results in 71. Now, I'll check if 71 is a prime number. It isn't divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, so 71 is prime.\n\nWith the prime factors identified, the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the sum of these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220.\n\nFinally, I'll find the proper divisors of 220. I'll start by factoring 220 into its prime components: 220 = 2 × 2 × 5 × 11. Using these factors, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, and 55.\n\nSumming these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 = 173.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 173.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Problem:**  \nThe proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. A proper divisor of an integer \\( N \\) is a positive divisor of \\( N \\) that is less than \\( N \\). What is the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284?\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Find the Proper Divisors of 284**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the proper divisors of 284.\n\n1. **Factorize 284:**\n   - 284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2.\n   - \\( 284 \\div 2 = 142 \\)\n   - 142 is also even, so divide by 2:\n     - \\( 142 \\"
