Proper divisors are positive integers that divide 284 without leaving a remainder and are less than 284.\n\nNext, I'll list the divisors of 284. I know that 284 is an even number, so 2 is a divisor. I'll also check if 4, 6, 8, 12, and so on divide 284 evenly. Once I have all the divisors, I'll sum them up.\n\nAfter finding the sum of the proper divisors of 284, the next step is to calculate the sum of these divisors. This means I'll add each proper divisor together.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer in a box as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.**\n3. **Find the proper divisors of the sum obtained in step 2.**\n4. **Sum these divisors to get the final answer.**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Proper Divisors of 284\n\nA proper divisor of a number \\( N \\) is a positive integer that divides \\( N \\) without leaving a remainder and is less than \\( N \\).\n\nLet's list the proper divisors of 284:\n\n- **1** (since 1 divides all integers)\n- **2** (284 is even, so 2 divides 284)\n- **4** (284 \u00f7 4 = 71, which is an integer)\n- **71** (284 \u00f7 71 = 4, which is an integer)\n- **142** (284 \u00f7 142 = 2, which is an integer)\n\n**Proper divisors of 284:** 1, 2, 4, 71, 142\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284\n\nNow, let's sum these proper divisors:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is **220**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Proper Divisors of 220\n\nNext, we"
