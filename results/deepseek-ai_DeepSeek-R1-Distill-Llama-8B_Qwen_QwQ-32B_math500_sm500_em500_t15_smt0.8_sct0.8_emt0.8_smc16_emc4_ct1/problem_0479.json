            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here with three variables: x, y, and z. They satisfy three equations, and I need to find the value of xy + yz + zx. Let me write down the equations first to make it clearer.\n\nThe equations are:\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, the third equation looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate it somehow.\n\nLooking at the third equation, it's symmetric in x, y, z. Each term is of the form variable times another variable squared or something like that. Maybe I can factor it or find a pattern.\n\nLet me try to factor the third equation. Let's see:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z \\)\n\nI notice that each of these terms can be grouped. For example, \\( xy^2 + x^2 y \\) can be factored as \\( xy(y + x) \\). Similarly, \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \\), and \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \\).\n\nSo, rewriting the third equation:\n\n\\( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12 \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( S = x + y + z \\), \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\), and \\( Q = xyz \\). These are the standard symmetric sums.\n\nWait, we already know Q from the first equation: Q = 4.\n\nSo, substituting into the third equation:\n\n\\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nWhich can also be written as:\n\n\\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, is that helpful? Let me think.\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n1. \\( xy(S - z) = x y S - x y z \\)\n2. \\( xz(S - y) = x"

So substituting:\n\n\\( S P - 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( S P - 12 = 12 \\)\nSo,\n\\( S P = 24 \\)\n\nAlright, so we have \\( S P = 24 \\). Let's remember that.\n\nNow, let's look at the second equation: \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\).\n\nI remember that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\) can be expressed in terms of S, P, and Q. The formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q \\)\n\nLet me verify that.\n\nYes, the expansion of \\( (x + y + z)^3 \\) is \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3(x + y)(y + z)(z + x) \\). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me recall the correct formula.\n\nActually, the correct formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3 xyz \\)\n\nSo, in terms of S, P, Q:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q \\)\n\nGiven that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\), substitute:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q = 4 \\)\n\nWe know that S P = 24, so substituting that:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3(24) + 3 Q = 4 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( S^3 - 72 + 12 = 4 \\) because"
