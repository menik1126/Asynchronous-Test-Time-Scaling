            "output": "First, I observe that the expression involves nested fractions and square roots. To simplify, I'll start by simplifying each of the square roots individually.\n\nFor √80, I can factor out the perfect square 16, so √80 becomes √(16 × 5) which simplifies to 4√5.\n\nNext, √845 is broken down into √(5 × 169), and since 169 is a perfect square (13²), √845 simplifies to 13√5.\n\nThen, √45 is factored into √(9 × 5), resulting in 3√5.\n\nWith these simplifications, the expression now looks cleaner. Now, I'll focus on simplifying the numerator by combining the terms: (5/4√5) + (13√5/9) + 3√5.\n\nTo add these fractions, I'll need a common denominator. The denominators are 4√5, 9, and 1. The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Therefore, I'll convert each term to have 36√5 as the denominator.\n\nAfter finding a common denominator and combining the terms, I'll have a single fraction in the numerator. Next, I'll simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n\nFinally, I'll simplify the entire expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by √5, resulting in a simplified fraction.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression step-by-step:\n\n1. **Simplify the radicals in the numerator:**\n   \n   - \\(\\sqrt{80} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 5} = 4\\sqrt{5}\\)\n   - \\(\\sqrt{845} = \\sqrt{5 \\times 169} = 13\\sqrt{5}\\)\n   - \\(\\sqrt{45} = \\sqrt{9 \\times 5} = 3\\sqrt{5}\\)\n\n2. **Rewrite the expression with simplified radicals:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} + \\dfrac{13\\sqrt{5}}{9} + 3\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify each term in the numerator:**\n   \n   - \\(\\dfrac{5}{4\\sqrt{5}} = \\d"
