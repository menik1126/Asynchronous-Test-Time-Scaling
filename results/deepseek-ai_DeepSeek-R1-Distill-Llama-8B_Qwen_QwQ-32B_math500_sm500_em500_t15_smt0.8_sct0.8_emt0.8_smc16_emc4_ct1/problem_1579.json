            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of (5 over square root of 80 plus square root of 845 over 9 plus square root of 45) all divided by square root of 5. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle the numerator inside the radical. So, the numerator is 5 divided by sqrt(80), plus sqrt(845) divided by 9, plus sqrt(45). Maybe I can simplify each of these terms separately. \n\nStarting with 5 over sqrt(80). I know that sqrt(80) can be simplified because 80 is 16 times 5, and 16 is a perfect square. So sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5) which is sqrt(16)*sqrt(5), which is 4*sqrt(5). So, 5 over sqrt(80) becomes 5 over 4*sqrt(5). Maybe I can simplify that further by rationalizing the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(5), so that's (5*sqrt(5))/(4*sqrt(5)*sqrt(5)) = (5*sqrt(5))/(4*5) = sqrt(5)/4. Okay, so the first term simplifies to sqrt(5)/4.\n\nNext, let's look at sqrt(845). Hmm, 845 is 5 times 169, and 169 is 13 squared. So sqrt(845) is sqrt(5*13^2), which is sqrt(5)*13, so that's 13*sqrt(5). So, sqrt(845)/9 becomes 13*sqrt(5)/9.\n\nNow, the third term is sqrt(45). 45 is 9*5, so sqrt(45) is sqrt(9*5) which is sqrt(9)*sqrt(5) = 3*sqrt(5).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the numerator becomes sqrt(5)/4 + 13*sqrt(5)/9 + 3*sqrt(5). Since all terms are in terms of sqrt(5), maybe I can factor that out and combine the coefficients.\n\nLet me express each term with a common denominator. The denominators are 4 and 9, so the least common denominator is 36. So, sqrt(5)/4"

Let's do it carefully. \n\nsqrt(5)/4: to get denominator 36, multiply numerator and denominator by 9: (1*9)/(4*9) = 9/36. So, sqrt(5)/4 is 9*sqrt(5)/36.\n\n13*sqrt(5)/9: to get denominator 36, multiply numerator and denominator by 4: (13*4)/(9*4) = 52/36. So, that term is 52*sqrt(5)/36.\n\n3*sqrt(5): to get denominator 36, multiply numerator and denominator by 12: wait, no, that's too much. Wait, 3*sqrt(5) is equal to (3*sqrt(5))*(36/36) = (108*sqrt(5))/36. Wait, 3*36 is 108, so yeah, 108*sqrt(5)/36.\n\nWait, actually, that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, just add all three terms as they are, maybe using another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since all have sqrt(5), let me factor sqrt(5) out:\n\nNumerator = sqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nBecause sqrt(5)/4 is sqrt(5)*(1/4), 13*sqrt(5)/9 is sqrt(5)*(13/9), and 3*sqrt(5) is sqrt(5)*3, which is sqrt(5)* (3/1). Wait, actually, 3 is equal to 3/1, so when factored out, it's sqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nNow, let's compute 1/4 + 13/9 + 3.\n\nFirst, let's find a common denominator for 4, 9, and 1. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1, so the least common multiple is 36.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = (13*4)/36 ="

So total is 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is sqrt(5)*(169/36).\n\nSo the entire expression inside the big square root is (sqrt(5)*(169/36)) divided by sqrt(5). \n\nWait, the original expression is sqrt( [numerator] / sqrt(5) ). \n\nWait, let me check again. The original expression is sqrt( ( [5/sqrt(80) + sqrt(845)/9 + sqrt(45)] ) / sqrt(5) )\n\nSo the numerator inside the big square root is the sum we just calculated, which is sqrt(5)*(169/36). Then, we divide that by sqrt(5). \n\nSo the entire fraction inside the big square root is [sqrt(5)*(169/36)] / sqrt(5). \n\nThe sqrt(5) in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out, so that simplifies to 169/36. \n\nTherefore, the entire expression is sqrt(169/36). \n\nTaking the square root of that fraction, sqrt(169)/sqrt(36) = 13/6. \n\nWait, so the final answer is 13/6? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the numerator terms:\n\nFirst term: 5/sqrt(80). Simplified sqrt(80) to 4*sqrt(5), so 5/(4*sqrt(5)). Then rationalizing gives sqrt(5)/4. That seems right.\n\nSecond term: sqrt(845). 845 divided by 5 is 169, which is 13 squared. So sqrt(5*13^2) is 13*sqrt(5). Divided by 9, so 13*sqrt(5)/9. That's correct.\n\nThird term: sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5). Correct.\n\nAdding them together, factoring sqrt(5):\n\nsqrt(5)*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3"
