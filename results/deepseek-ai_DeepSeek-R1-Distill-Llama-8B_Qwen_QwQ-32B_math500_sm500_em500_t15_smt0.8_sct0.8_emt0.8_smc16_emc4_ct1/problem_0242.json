            "output": "To convert \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) to a decimal, I'll start by performing the division \\(31 \\div 11111\\). This will give me an initial decimal approximation, which is \\(0.0027992478\\).\n\nNext, I'll express this decimal as a repeating decimal. Observing the decimal expansion, it appears that the repeating part is \"0027992478\". However, upon closer inspection, it seems that the pattern actually repeats every 4 digits, resulting in a repeating block of \"0027\".\n\nNow, to determine the length of the repeating block, I'll examine the denominator \\(11111\\). This number can be factored into its prime components: \\(11111 = 41 \\times 271\\). \n\nSince both 41 and 271 are prime numbers, the period of the repeating decimal is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of their orders modulo 10. However, calculating the exact period is complex without more advanced number theory tools.\n\nGiven the initial approximation and the pattern observed in the decimal expansion, I conclude that the repeating block has a length of 1 digit.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   \n   We need to convert the fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) into a decimal and identify the length of the repeating block.\n\n2. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   \n   Performing the division \\(31 \\div 11111\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   31 \\div 11111 = 0.0027992478\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n   Observing the decimal expansion:\n   \\[\n   0.002799247800027992478\\ldots\n   \\]\n   \n   It appears that the repeating block is \"0027992478\".\n\n3. **Determine the Length of the Repeating Block:**\n   \n   The repeating sequence in the decimal is \"0027992478\". Counting the digits:\n   \\[\n   0,\\ 0,\\ 2,\\ 7,\\ 9,\\ 9,\\ 2,\\ 4,\\ 7,\\ 8\n   \\]\n   \n   That makes a total of **10 digits** repeating.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n\n   The repeating decimal has **10** digits repeating."
