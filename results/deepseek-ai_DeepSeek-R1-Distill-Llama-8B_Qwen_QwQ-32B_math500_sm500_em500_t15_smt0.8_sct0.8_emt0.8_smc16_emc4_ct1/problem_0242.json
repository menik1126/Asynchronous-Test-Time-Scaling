            "output": "To determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of 31/11111, I first need to understand the relationship between the numerator and the denominator. The denominator is 11111, which is a number with five 1s.\n\nNext, I recall that the length of the repeating cycle in a fraction like a/b is related to the order of 10 modulo b. Specifically, the repeating decimal will have a cycle length equal to the smallest positive integer k such that 10^k ≡ 1 mod b.\n\nSince b = 11111, I need to find the smallest k for which 10 raised to the power of k leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 11111. This is equivalent to solving the congruence equation 10^k ≡ 1 mod 11111.\n\nGiven that 11111 can be factored into the product of primes, I can use Euler's theorem to find a potential value for k. Euler's theorem states that k must be a divisor of Euler's totient function φ(b). Calculating φ(11111) will help determine the possible values of k.\n\nAfter performing the prime factorization and calculating φ(11111), I can identify the divisors and test each to find the smallest k that satisfies 10^k ≡ 1 mod 11111.\n\nOnce I have the smallest k, this value represents the number of digits that will repeat in the decimal expansion of 31/11111.\n\nTherefore, the repeating decimal of 31/11111 has a cycle length of 5 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), we'll analyze the properties of the denominator and use concepts from number theory.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Denominator**\nThe denominator is \\(11111\\). Notice that \\(11111 = 10^5 - 1 - 1 = 99999 + 1\\). However, a more precise factorization is:\n\\[\n11111 = 41 \\times 271\n\\]\nBoth 41 and 271 are prime numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Cycle Length of the Decimal Expansion**\nA fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will have a repeating decimal expansion if and only if the denominator \\(b\\) has prime factors other than 2 and 5. In this case, \\(b = 11111\\) factors into primes as"

To find the period for each prime factor, we need the smallest integer \\(k\\) such that \\(10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod p\\), where \\(p\\) is the prime factor.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Period for Each Prime Factor**\n- **For \\(p = 41\\):**\n  - Find the smallest \\(k\\) such that \\(10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod 41\\).\n  - The order of 10 modulo 41 divides \\(\\phi(41) = 40\\).\n  - Testing divisors of 40 (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40):\n    - \\(10^5 \\mod 41 = 100000 \\mod 41 = 1\\). Thus, the period for 41 is 5.\n\n- **For \\(p = 271\\):**\n  - Find the smallest \\(k\\) such that \\(10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod 271\\).\n  - The order of 10 modulo 271 divides \\(\\phi(271) = 270\\).\n  - Testing divisors of 270 (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 27, 30, 45, 54, 81, 90, 135, 270):\n    - \\(10^5 \\mod 271 = 100000 \\mod 271 = 1\\). Thus, the period for 271 is also 5.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the LCM of the Periods**\nThe periods for both prime factors (41 and 271) are 5. The LCM of 5 and 5 is 5.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe repeating decimal of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) has a repeating cycle of"
