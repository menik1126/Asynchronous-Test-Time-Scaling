I need to find the surface area of one of the pieces created when a plane cuts the tetrahedron halfway between edges AB and CD. The plane is parallel to both AB and CD.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a regular tetrahedron is. It's a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, each one equilateral, and all edges are equal in length. So, every edge here is length 2, and every face is an equilateral triangle with sides of length 2.\n\nNow, the plane is parallel to both AB and CD. Since AB and CD are edges of the tetrahedron, and the plane is parallel to both, it must be cutting through the tetrahedron in a way that creates a smaller similar tetrahedron and another piece. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's cutting off a smaller tetrahedron and leaving a pentahedron or something else.\n\nWait, the plane is lying halfway between AB and CD. So, halfway along their length? But since AB and CD are skew lines in the tetrahedron, meaning they don't lie on the same plane and don't intersect, being parallel to both means the plane will intersect the tetrahedron along a line that's parallel to both.\n\nWait, but they are edges, so their midpoints might be important here. If the plane is halfway between AB and CD, perhaps it intersects each of them at their midpoints? Because halfway along the line between AB and CD would be the midpoints.\n\nLet me visualize this. So, in a regular tetrahedron, any two opposite edges like AB and CD are skew. The midpoints of AB and CD would each be at a distance of 1 from their respective vertices because the edges are length 2.\n\nIf I create a plane that passes through the midpoints of AB and CD and is parallel to both, then this plane would intersect the tetrahedron along a quadrilateral, right? Because a plane cutting two opposite edges would create a quadrilateral where it intersects the faces.\n\nSo, the plane would intersect the tetrahedron, creating two new polyhedrons: one is a smaller tetrahedron, and the other is a pentahedron, perhaps? Or maybe a different shape.\n\nWait, actually, if the plane"

Since the plane is halfway between them, maybe the intersection is a parallelogram?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to approach this more systematically.\n\nFirst, let me set up coordinates for the tetrahedron. Let me choose coordinates such that the vertices are easy to work with. Let me recall that in a regular tetrahedron, one way to assign coordinates is to place the vertices at (1,1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1), and (1,-1,-1), scaled appropriately so that the edge lengths are 2. Wait, but maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe place vertex A at (0,0,0), B at (2,0,0), C at (1, √3, 0), and D at (1, √3/3, √(8/3)). Wait, let me think. Let me recall that in a regular tetrahedron, the coordinates can be set with one vertex at the origin, and others in such a way that all edges are equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use coordinates where the centroid is at the origin, but maybe that complicates things. Let me try to set coordinates for a regular tetrahedron with edge length 2.\n\nLet me recall that the coordinates for a regular tetrahedron can be given as follows: Let’s place vertex A at (0,0,0). Then, vertex B can be at (2,0,0). To find vertex C, since it's an equilateral triangle in the xy-plane, the coordinates would be (1, √3, 0). Now, the fourth vertex D must be above the xy-plane such that its distance to A, B, and C is 2. Let me compute that.\n\nLet’s denote D as (x, y, z). The distance from D to A is √(x² + y² + z²) = 2,\n\ndistance to B is √((x-2)² + y² + z²) = 2,\n\ndistance to C is √((x-1)² + (y - √3)² + z²) = 2.\n\nSubtracting"

If it has a quadrilateral, it must be a pentahedron.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lower piece is a pyramid with a quadrilateral base (the cross-section) and apex at A and B? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the vertices of the lower piece.\n\nThe lower piece must include vertices A and B, since they are on the lower side of the plane.\n\nThe intersection points P1, P2, P3, P4 are also part of the lower piece's boundary.\n\nWait, but P3 and P4 are on edges BD and AD, which are connected to D, which is on the upper side. So, the lower piece includes the points along those edges up to the intersection points.\n\nTherefore, the vertices of the lower piece are A, B, P1, P2, P3, P4.\n\nSo, the faces of the lower piece are:\n\n- The original face ABC, but only the part below the plane, which is triangle AP1P2.\n\n- The original face ABD, below the plane, which is triangle AP4P3.\n\n- The original face ACD, below the plane, which is triangle AP1P4.\n\n- The original face ABD? Wait, no, ABD is split into two parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the lower piece has the following faces:\n\n1. Triangle AP1P2 (part of ABC),\n\n2. Triangle BP2P3 (part of BCD? Wait, BCD is on the upper side? Wait, vertex C is on the upper side, so BCD is split.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to compute the surface area by considering the areas of the original faces that are entirely on the piece plus the area of the cross-section.\n\nThe original tetrahedron has four faces, each of area (sqrt(3)/4)*(2)^2 = sqrt(3). Wait, since each face is an equilateral triangle with side length 2.\n\nWait, area of an equilateral triangle with side length a is (√3/4)a². So for a=2, area is (√3/4)*4 = √3.\n\nSo each face has area √3.\n\nNow, the lower piece (containing A and B) will have parts of three original faces (ABC,"
