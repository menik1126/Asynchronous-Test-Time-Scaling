            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem: \"How many y-intercepts does the graph of the parabola x = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1 have?\" Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that intercepts are points where the graph crosses the axes. So, a y-intercept would be where the graph crosses the y-axis. Now, the y-axis is where x = 0, right? So, to find the y-intercept(s), I need to set x equal to 0 and solve for y. That makes sense because at the y-intercept, the value of x is 0.\n\nSo, starting with the equation:\n\nx = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1\n\nI can substitute x with 0 to find the y-intercepts:\n\n0 = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1\n\nHmm, okay, so this is a quadratic equation in terms of y. I can solve for y by using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is y = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where the equation is in the form ay\u00b2 + by + c = 0.\n\nIn this case, the equation is:\n\ny\u00b2 - 4y - 1 = 0\n\nSo, comparing to ay\u00b2 + by + c = 0, I have:\n- a = 1\n- b = -4\n- c = -1\n\nLet me plug these into the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [-(-4) \u00b1 \u221a((-4)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-1))] / (2*1)\n\nSimplify step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\n-(-4) is 4. So, 4 \u00b1 \u221a(something).\n\nNow, inside the square root:\n\n(-4)\u00b2 is 16, and 4*1*(-1) is -4. So, 16 - (-4) is 16 + 4 = 20.\n\nSo, the square root part is \u221a20.\n\n\u221a20 can be simplified. 20 is 4*5, so \u221a20 = \u221a4 * \u221a5 = 2\u221a5.\n\nSo, plugging back into the numerator:\n\n4 \u00b1 2\u221a5\n\nAnd the denominator is 2*1 = 2.\n\nSo, y = (4 \u00b1 2\u221a5)/2\n\nI can simplify this by dividing numerator"

Maybe I should verify by plugging these y-values back into the original equation to see if x indeed becomes 0.\n\nFirst, for y = 2 + \u221a5:\n\nx = (2 + \u221a5)\u00b2 - 4*(2 + \u221a5) - 1\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n(2 + \u221a5)\u00b2 = 4 + 4\u221a5 + 5 = 9 + 4\u221a5\n\nThen, subtract 4*(2 + \u221a5):\n\n4*(2 + \u221a5) = 8 + 4\u221a5\n\nSo, subtracting that:\n\n9 + 4\u221a5 - (8 + 4\u221a5) = 9 - 8 + 4\u221a5 - 4\u221a5 = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nWait, that gives x = 1, not 0. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, wait. Let me recalculate:\n\nCompute x = (2 + \u221a5)\u00b2 - 4*(2 + \u221a5) - 1\n\nFirst, expand (2 + \u221a5)\u00b2:\n\n(2 + \u221a5)(2 + \u221a5) = 4 + 2\u221a5 + 2\u221a5 + (\u221a5)\u00b2 = 4 + 4\u221a5 + 5 = 9 + 4\u221a5.\n\nThen, compute 4*(2 + \u221a5):\n\n4*2 + 4*\u221a5 = 8 + 4\u221a5.\n\nNow, subtract that from the first part:\n\n(9 + 4\u221a5) - (8 + 4\u221a5) - 1\n\n= 9 - 8 + 4\u221a5 - 4\u221a5 - 1\n\n= 1 + 0 -1\n\n= 0.\n\nOkay, so x is indeed 0.

Because generally, the standard form is x = a(y - k)^2 + h, which opens to the right or left depending on the sign of 'a'.\n\nIn our case, the coefficient of y\u00b2 is 1, which is positive, so it opens to the right.\n\nBut how does that affect the number of y-intercepts? Well, since it opens to the right, it may cross the y-axis at two points if the vertex is low enough on the y-axis. Alternatively, if it just touches the y-axis, it would have one y-intercept, or maybe none if it never reaches x=0.\n\nWait, but in this case, since substituting x=0 gives a quadratic equation with two real solutions, that means it crosses the y-axis twice. So that's why there are two y-intercepts.\n\nLet me visualize it. The parabola opens to the right, so it's like a sideways U-shape. If the vertex is below the y-axis, it would cross the y-axis twice. If the vertex is exactly at the origin, it only touches once. If the vertex is above or too far, it might not cross. But in this case, the vertex"

Let me complete the square for the equation x = y\u00b2 -4y -1.\n\nStarting with x = y\u00b2 -4y -1.\n\nTo complete the square for the y terms:\n\nTake y\u00b2 -4y. The coefficient of y is -4, so half of that is -2, square is 4. So add and subtract 4:\n\nx = (y\u00b2 -4y +4 -4) -1\n\n= (y - 2)^2 -4 -1\n\n= (y - 2)^2 -5\n\nSo the equation is x = (y - 2)^2 -5.\n\nTherefore, the vertex is at (h, k) = (-5, 2). Wait, because in the standard form x = a(y - k)^2 + h, so h is the x-coordinate and k is the y-coordinate. So vertex is at (-5, 2). \n\nSo the vertex is at (-5, 2). Since the parabola opens to the right (since a is positive), the vertex is at x = -5, which is to the left of the y-axis (which is at x=0). Since it opens to the right, it will go from the vertex at (-5,2) towards the right. Since the vertex is left of the y-axis, the parabola will cross the y-axis (x=0) at two points. That matches with our previous result of two solutions. \n\nTherefore, the number of y-intercepts is two. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way. The y-intercepts are the points where x=0, so solving for y gives two real solutions, so two points. Therefore, the answer is 2. \n\nHmm, seems consistent. I think that's correct. So the final answer is 2, so boxed answer is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts of the parabola given by \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), we need to find the points where the graph crosses the \\( y \\)-axis.
