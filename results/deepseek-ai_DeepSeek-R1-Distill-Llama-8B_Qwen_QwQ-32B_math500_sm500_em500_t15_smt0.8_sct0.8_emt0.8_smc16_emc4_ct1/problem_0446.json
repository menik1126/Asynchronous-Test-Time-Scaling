The sequence starts at 1 and increases by 2 each time, so the number of terms can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. Here, a_1 is 1, the common difference d is 2, and a_n is 199.\n\nSolving for n gives me 100 terms in total.\n\nNext, I'll use the formula for the sum of the first n odd numbers: S = n^2. Plugging in the number of terms, the sum is 100 squared, which equals 10,000.\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I'll perform the division and find that 10,000 ÷ 7 leaves a remainder of 3.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo $7$ remainder of the sum $1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199$, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence and Number of Terms:**\n   - The given sequence is the sum of the first $100$ odd numbers. This is because the sequence starts at $1$ and increases by $2$ each time, so the $n$-th term is given by:\n     \\[\n     a_n = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n     \\]\n   - Setting $a_{100} = 199$:\n     \\[\n     199 = 1 + (100 - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n     199 = 1 + 198 \\\\\n     199 = 199\n     \\]\n   - **Number of Terms ($n$):** $100$\n\n2. **Sum of the First $n$ Odd Numbers:**\n   - The sum of the first $n$ odd numbers is a well-known formula:\n     \\[\n     S = n^2\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in $n = 100$:\n     \\[\n     S = 100^2 = 10,\\!000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Modulo $7$ Remainder:**\n   - To find $"
