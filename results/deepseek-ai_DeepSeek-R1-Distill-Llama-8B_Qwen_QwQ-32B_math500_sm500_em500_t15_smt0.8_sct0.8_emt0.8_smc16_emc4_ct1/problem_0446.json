            "output": "First, I recognize that the given series is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. The sequence starts at 1 and ends at 199. To find the number of terms, I'll use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. Here, a_1 is 1, d is 2, and a_n is 199. Solving for n, I get n = (199 - 1)/2 + 1 = 100 terms.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence using the formula S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n). Plugging in the values, I find that the sum is 100/2 * (1 + 199) = 50 * 200 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, I'll determine the modulo 7 remainder of 10,000 by dividing 10,000 by 7 and finding the remainder. 10,000 divided by 7 is 1,428 with a remainder of 4. Therefore, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum of the sequence \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 197 + 199\\) is divided by 7, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Properties:**\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.\n   - The first term (\\(a_1\\)) is 1, and the last term (\\(a_n\\)) is 199.\n   - The common difference (\\(d\\)) is 2.\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms (\\(n\\)):**\n   - Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n     \\]\n   - Plug in the known values:\n     \\[\n     199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\implies 198 = (n - 1) \\times 2 \\implies n - 1 = 99 \\implies n = 100\n     \\]\n   - So, there are **100** terms in the sequence.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the"
