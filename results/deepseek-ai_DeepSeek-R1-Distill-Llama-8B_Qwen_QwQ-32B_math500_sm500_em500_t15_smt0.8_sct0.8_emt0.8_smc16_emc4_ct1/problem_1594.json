Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes when you have sums of cubes, there might be a formula or a substitution that can help. But here, it's not just two cubes being added, but three terms. Wait, actually, the right side is also a cube, specifically \\((2x - 10)^3\\). Maybe I can write the left side as a single cube somehow?\n\nLet me try expanding both sides to see if that helps. Starting with the left side: \\((x - 3)^3\\) and \\((x - 7)^3\\). I can use the binomial expansion for cubes. The expansion of \\((a - b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3\\).\n\nSo, expanding \\((x - 3)^3\\):\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\n\\]\nSimilarly, expanding \\((x - 7)^3\\):\n\\[\n(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\n\\]\nNow, adding these two together:\n\\[\n(x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n- \\(x^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\\)\n- \\(-9x^2 - 21x^2 = -30x^2\\)\n- \\(27x + 147x = 174x\\)\n- \\(-27 - 343 = -370\\)\n\nSo, the left side simplifies to:\n\\[\n2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370\n\\]\n\nNow, let's look at the right side: \\((2x - 10)^3\\). Again, using the binomial expansion:\n\\[\n(2x - 10)^3 = (2x)^3 - "

Maybe I can factor out a common term. Looking at the coefficients, I see that -6, 90, -426, and 630 are all divisible by 6. Let me factor out a -6:\n\nWait, no, perhaps factor out a common factor first. Alternatively, I can factor out a 6, but since the leading coefficient is -6, I might factor out a -6 or a 6 and adjust the signs accordingly.\n\nLet me try factoring out a -6:\n\\[\n-6(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105"

Maybe I can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is -105 and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.\n\nLet me test these one by one.\n\nTesting x=1:\n\\(1 - 15 + 71 - 105 = (1 -15) + (71 -105) = (-14) + (-34) = -48 ≠ 0\\).\n\nTesting x=3:\n\\(27 - 135 + 213 - 105 = (27 -135) + (213 -105) = (-108) + 108 = 0\\). Oh, x=3 is a root!\n\nSo, (x - 3) is a factor. Now, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 3) from the cubic.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n3 | 1  -15   71  -105\n\nMultiply 3 down:\n\nBring down the 1.\n\n1\n\nMultiply 1 by 3: 3, add to next term: -15 + 3 = -12\n\n-12\n\nMultiply -12 by 3: -36, add to next term: 71 + (-36) = 35\n\n35\n\nMultiply 35 by 3: 105, add to next term: -105 +105= 0\n\nSo, the cubic factors into (x - 3)(x^2 -12x +35). Now, let's factor the quadratic: x^2 -12x +35.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12. Those numbers would be -5 and -7.\n\nSo, x^2 -12x +35 = (x -5)(x -7).\n\nTherefore, the equation factors into:\n\\[\n(x - 3)(x - 5)(x -7) ="

Looking back at the original equation:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x -10)^3\n\\]\nI can let u = x - 5, shifting the variable to center it around 5. Let's see:\n\nThen, x -3 = u + 2 and x -7 = u -2. So, the left side becomes (u + 2)^3 + (u - 2)^3.\n\nExpanding these:\n\n(u + 2)^3 = u^3 + 6u^2 + 12u + 8\n(u - 2)^3 = u^3 -6u^2 +12u -8\n\nAdding them together:\nu^3 +6u^2 +12u +8 + u^3 -6u^2 +12u -8 = 2u^3 +24u\n\nOn the right side, 2x -10. Since x = u +5, 2(u +5) -10 = 2u +10 -10 = 2u.\n\nThus, the right side is (2u)^3"
