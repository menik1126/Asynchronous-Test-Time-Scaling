Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all the cubes, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with equations involving cubes, sometimes substitution can help. The right-hand side is \\((2x - 10)^3\\). I notice that 2x - 10 is similar to 2 times (x - 5), right? Because 2 times (x - 5) would be 2x - 10. So maybe I can rewrite the right side as [2(x - 5)]^3. Let me write that down:\n\n\\[\n(2x - 10)^3 = [2(x - 5)]^3\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2^3 \\cdot (x - 5)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, that seems a bit better. Maybe I can expand the left side. Let me try expanding both \\((x - 3)^3\\) and \\((x - 7)^3\\).\n\nI recall that \\((a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3\\), so applying that:\n\nFirst, expand \\((x - 3)^3\\):\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, expand \\((x - 7)^3\\):\n\n\\[\n(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\n\\]\n\nNow, if I add these two together:\n\n\\[\n(x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)\n\\]\n\nLet me combine like terms:\n\n- \\(x^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\\)\n- \\(-9x^2 - 21x^"

Earlier, I simplified it to \\(8(x - 5)^3\\). Let me expand that:\n\n\\[\n8(x - 5)^3 = 8(x^3 - 15x^2 + 75x - 125)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\n\\]\n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. Let me bring all terms to one side so I can set the equation to zero. Subtract the left side from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000 - (2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370)\n\\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000 - 2x^3 + 30x^2 - 174x + 370\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(8x^3 - 2x^3 = 6x^3\\)\n- \\(-120x^2 + 30x^2 = -90x^2\\)\n- \\(600x - 174x = 426x\\)\n- \\(-1000 + 370 = -630\\)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n6x^3 - 90x^2 + 426x - 630 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's a cubic equation.

Maybe I can factor it or use the Rational Root Theorem.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root, p/q, is a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. Here, the constant term is -105, and the leading coefficient is 1. So possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b15, \u00b17, \u00b115, \u00b121, \u00b135, \u00b1105.\n\nLet me test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation.\n\nFirst, try x = 1:\n\n\\(1 - 15 + 71 - 105 = 1 -15 = -14; -14 +71=57; 57-105=-48 \u2260 0\\).\n\nNot a root.\n\nNext, x = 3:\n\n\\(27 - 135 + 213 -105 = 27 -135=-108; -108 +213=105; 105 -105=0\\).\n\nYes! x=3 is a root. Great, so (x - 3) is a factor.\n\nNow, let's perform polynomial division to factor out (x - 3). Using synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -15 | 71 | -105\n\nDivide by (x - 3), so we use root 3.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 3: 3. Add to -15: -12.\n\nMultiply -12 by 3: -36. Add to 71: 35.\n\nMultiply 35 by 3: 105. Add to -105: 0.\n\nSo the quotient is \\(x^2 - 12x + 35\\).\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\(x - 3 = 0\\) \u21d2 x = 3.\n\n2. \\(x^2 - 12x + 35 = 0\\).

So that step is okay.\n\nThen, finding roots, got x=3, and factored to quadratic, which gave 5 and7.\n\nSo I think I did everything correctly.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes when you have equations like a^3 + b^3 = c^3, it's useful to see if a + b = c, but in this case, a is (x-3), b is (x-7), and c is (2x-10). Let me see if a + b = c.\n\nCompute a + b: (x-3) + (x-7) = 2x -10, which is exactly c. So that's interesting.\n\nSo in this case, a + b = c. Now, I remember that if a + b = c, then a^3 + b^3 can be factored as (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Let me try that:\n\nGiven a + b = c, then:\n\na^3 + b^3 = c^3\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = c^3\n\nBut since a + b = c, substitute:\n\nc (a^2 - ab + b^2) = c^3\n\nAssuming c \u2260 0 (which we can check, but in our case, c is 2x -10, which can be zero when x=5, which is one of our roots), so if c \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by c:\n\na^2 - ab + b^2 = c^2\n\nSo, from this, we get another equation:\n\na^2 - ab + b^2 = c^2\n\nLet me compute a^2, ab, b^2, and c^2.\n\nGiven a = x-3, b = x-7, c=2x-10.\n\nCompute a^2: (x-3)^2 = x^2 -6x +9\n\nCompute ab: (x-3)(x-7) = x^2 -10x +21\n\nCompute b^2: (x-7)^2 = x^2 -14x +49\n\nCompute c^2: (2x -10)^2 = 4x^2 -40x +"
