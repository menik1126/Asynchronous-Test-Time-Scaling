            "output": "First, I'll identify the given information. The volume of the cylinder is provided as 45\u03c0 cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h. Here, V is 45\u03c0, and the radius r is given as 3 centimeters.\n\nNow, I'll substitute these known values into the volume formula to find the height h. Plugging in the numbers, the equation becomes 45\u03c0 = \u03c0(3)\u00b2h.\n\nSimplifying further, 45\u03c0 equals \u03c0 times 9 times h. This reduces to 45\u03c0 = 9\u03c0h.\n\nSince both sides of the equation have \u03c0, I can divide both sides by \u03c0 to eliminate it, resulting in 45 = 9h.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for h by dividing both sides by 9, which gives h = 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo find the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, we'll use the volume formula for a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Given:**\n- Volume (\\( V \\)) = \\( 45\\pi \\) cm\u00b3\n- Radius (\\( r \\)) = 3 cm\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi \\times 9 \\times h\n\\]\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = 9\\pi h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\pi \\) to solve for \\( h \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Divide both sides by 9 to find the height \\( h \\).\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
