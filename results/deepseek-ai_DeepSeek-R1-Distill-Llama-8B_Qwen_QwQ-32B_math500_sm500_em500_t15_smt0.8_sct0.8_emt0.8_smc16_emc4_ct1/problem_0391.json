Here, the volume \\( V \\) is given as \\( 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll substitute the known values into the formula. Since the radius \\( r \\) is 3 cm, the equation becomes \\( 45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h \\).\n\nNow, I'll simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\) to get \\( 45 = 9h \\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9, which gives \\( h = 5 \\) cm.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder given the volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cm³ and the radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm, we can use the **volume formula for a cylinder**:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\).**\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.**\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe height of the cylinder is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) centimeters."
