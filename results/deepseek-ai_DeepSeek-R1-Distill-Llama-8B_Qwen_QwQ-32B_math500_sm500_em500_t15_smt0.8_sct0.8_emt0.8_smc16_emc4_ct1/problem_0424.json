It says that there are 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The problem is asking for the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nHmm, okay. First, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\). So, \\(\\frac{1}{r\\overline{r}}\\) is the reciprocal of the square of the modulus of \\(r\\). That might come in handy.\n\nSince the equation is a polynomial of degree 10, it has 10 roots, and because the coefficients are real (I think), the non-real roots must come in complex conjugate pairs. So, each \\(r_i\\) has a corresponding \\(\\overline{r}_i\\). So, we have these five pairs.\n\nI need to find the sum of \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\) for each pair \\(i\\) from 1 to 5. So, first, perhaps I should figure out how to express this sum in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial equation.\n\nLet me think about Vieta's formulas. Vieta relates the sums and products of the roots to the coefficients. But here, it's not straightforward because I don't have a simple polynomial like \\(x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_0 = 0\\). The given equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Hmm, maybe I can expand this?\n\nWait, let's see. Maybe expanding \\((13x - 1)^{10}\\) using the binomial theorem? That might get complicated, but perhaps some terms will cancel out or simplify when adding \\(x^{10"

Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach that doesn't require expanding the entire polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th roots of both sides, but considering complex roots, so each side has roots which are 10th roots of the other side. But this might involve introducing a factor with \\(e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\), since the right-hand side is negative and raised to an even power. Let me think:\n\nIf \\(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0\\), then \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Therefore, \\( \\left( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} \\right)^{10} = -1 \\).\n\nAh! So that's better. Let me define \\(y = \\frac{x}{13x - 1}\\). Then the equation becomes \\(y^{10} = -1\\). The solutions to this are the 10th roots of -1, which can be written as \\(y_k = e^{i(\\pi + 2\\pi k)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\). So each root \\(y_k\\) corresponds to an angle of \\(\\pi/10 + \\pi k/5\\), spread out by \\(2\\pi/10 = \\pi/5\\) each.\n\nTherefore, for each such \\(y_k\\), we have \\(y_k = \\frac{x}{13x - 1}\\). Let me solve for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y_k\\):\n\nStarting with \\( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} = y_k \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(13x - 1\\):\n\n\\(x = y_k (13x - 1)\\)\n\nExpand right side:\n\n\\(x = 13 y_k x - y_k\\)\n\nBring terms with x to the left:\n\n\\(x - 13 y_k x = - y_k\\)\n\nFactor x:\n\n\\(x (1 - 13 y_k) = - y_k\\)\n\nTherefore, solving for x:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{"

Then, we can take the reciprocal and sum them up.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the sum of \\(1/(r_i \\overline{r_i})\\), which is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\), let's note that each pair \\(r_i, \\overline{r}_i\\) will correspond to two roots \\(x_i, \\overline{x}_i\\) (but in our case, the equation is such that if \\(x\\) is a root, so is \\( \\overline{x}\\), right? Wait, is that necessarily the case here? Wait, if the original equation has real coefficients, then yes, complex roots come in conjugate pairs. So, in this case, yes, each \\(x\\) is either real or comes with its conjugate.\n\nBut wait, in our case, our polynomial is \\(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} = 0\\). If we plug in \\(x\\) and \\(\\overline{x}\\), then \\(x^{10}\\) would become \\(\\overline{x}^{10}\\), and \\((13x -1)^{10}\\) would become \\((13\\overline{x} -1)^{10}\\), which is the conjugate of \\((13x -1)^{10}\\). Therefore, since original equation is equal to zero, the conjugate equation is also equal to zero, so yes, if \\(x\\) is a root, so is \\(\\overline{x}\\).\n\nTherefore, the roots come in conjugate pairs, so each \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) are roots. So, in our 10 roots, we have 5 such pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps instead of considering each pair, we can just compute the sum over all roots, but divided by 2? Wait, no, because"

Wait, no. Wait, each pair contributes one term. Since each pair (r_i and its conjugate) have the same modulus, so |r_i|^2 = |overline{r_i}|^2, so the term 1/(r_i overline{r_i}) is 1/|r_i|^2 for each root in the pair, but since each pair has two roots, but in the problem, they are listed as r_1, overline{r}_1,... so each term is for each pair.\n\nTherefore, actually, the problem's sum is exactly 5 terms, each 1/|r_i|^2, so it's the sum over all roots of 1/(|r|^2), divided by 2 (since each pair is counted twice in the total sum). Wait, actually, no. The problem lists the roots as r_1, overline{r}_1, etc., so they are five distinct pairs. Therefore, the problem wants us to add 1/(r_i overline{r}_i) for each pair, so each pair contributes once, so the total number of terms is 5, each term being 1/(r_i overline{r}_i). So each term is 1/|r_i|^2, and since r_i and overline{r}_i are part of the same term, it's just adding up for each pair.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to compute this sum using the roots themselves. Let me think about Vieta's formula again. Let me denote the polynomial equation as P(x) = x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0. So, the roots are the solutions to P(x) = 0.

Because each non-real pair contributes two terms, same for each modulus, so S = 2*(sum over pairs 1/|r_i|^2).\n\nBut the question is asking for sum over five pairs, so if I compute S/2, that would be the answer.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute S = sum_{i=1}^10 1/|x_i|^2, then the answer would be S/2.\n\nSo, let me try to compute S.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps by using Vieta's formula on the polynomial equation.
