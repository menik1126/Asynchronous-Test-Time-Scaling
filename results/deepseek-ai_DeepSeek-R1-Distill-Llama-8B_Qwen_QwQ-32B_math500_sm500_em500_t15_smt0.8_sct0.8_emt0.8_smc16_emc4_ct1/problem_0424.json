The roots are given as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\ldots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). I need to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to the square of its modulus, which is \\(|r|^2\\). So, each term like \\(\\frac{1}{r_i\\overline{r}_i}\\) is the reciprocal of \\(|r_i|^2\\).\n\nGiven that, the sum we're looking for is essentially the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the moduli of each pair of complex conjugate roots. Since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each pair will contribute the same term, so this sum is just five times the reciprocal of the modulus squared of one of these roots.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. If each pair \\(r_i, \\overline{r}_i\\) has the same modulus, then each term \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\) is the same. So, if I can find the modulus squared of one root, I can just multiply that by 5 to get the total sum. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, how do I find \\(|r_i|^2\\) for each root? Let's consider one of the roots \\(r_i\\). It satisfies the equation \\(r_i^{10} + (13r_i - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Hmm, how can I relate this to the modulus?\n\nI know that for a complex number \\(r\\), \\(|r| = \\sqrt{r \\overline{r}}\\), so \\(|r|^2 = r \\overline{r}\\). But I'm not sure how that helps here."

Taking the 10th roots of both sides, we can write \\(x = \\omega \\cdot ( -1)^{1/10} \\cdot (13x - 1)\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of unity.

So, each pair \\(r_i, \\overline{r}_i\\) corresponds to a single term in the sum, which is \\( \\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r}_i} \\). Since \\(r_i \\overline{r}_i = |r_i|^2\\), so each term is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). Since each pair contributes the same value, the total sum is 5 times the value for one pair. Wait, but actually, each pair is two roots, but the term is only counted once per pair. So, the total sum is the sum over each pair's reciprocal modulus squared. Since each pair's reciprocal modulus squared is the same as the reciprocal of the modulus squared of either root in the pair, so each pair contributes one term. Therefore, the total sum is the sum over all distinct pairs, so 5 terms. \n\nHowever, in the expression above, each root \\(x\\) corresponds to a \\(k\\), so each \\(k\\) gives a root \\(x_k\\), and its conjugate would correspond to another \\(k'\\).

Therefore, the total sum over all roots would be twice the desired sum (since each pair contributes two terms, but the problem wants each pair counted once).

Each \\(1/(r_i \\overline{r}_i)\\) is equal for the pair, as modulus squared is same. So if I can compute the sum over all 10 roots, which is sum_{k=0}^{9} 1/|x_k|^2, that would be twice the desired sum. Therefore, desired sum is (1/2) * sum_{k=0}^9 [1/|x_k|^2].\n\nBut earlier, I have \\(1/|x_k|^2 = 170 - 26 \\Re(\\omega_k)\\). Therefore, the total sum over all 10 roots is sum_{k=0}^9 [170 - 26 \\Re(\\omega_k)] = 10*170 - 26 * sum_{k=0}^9 \\Re(\\omega_k) = 1700 - 26 * S, where S is the sum of the real parts of the 10th roots of -1.\n\nSo, let me compute S = sum_{k=0}^9 \\Re(\\omega_k).

The problem says \"the value of \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1}+\\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2}+\\ldots+\\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\)\", which is exactly the sum over each pair once. Since each pair's reciprocal modulus squared is the same for both roots, so each pair contributes once. Since there are 5 pairs, the total is the sum over all 10 roots divided by 2. Since each term in the total sum (over all roots) is counted twice (once for each root in the pair), so dividing by 2 gives the desired sum. Therefore, 1700 / 2 = 850. So the answer is 850?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me see:\n\nEach term \\(1/(r_i \\overline{r}_i)\\) is equal to \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). Since each pair \\(r_i, \\overline{r}_i\\) has the same modulus squared, so each pair contributes exactly one term to the desired sum. The total over all roots (each root's \\(1/|x|^2\\)) is 1700, so the desired sum is exactly half of that, since each pair's two roots contribute two terms to the total, but only one term to the desired sum. Therefore, 1700 / 2 = 850. So the answer is 850?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me take a simple case. Suppose there are two roots, r and \\over"

So yes, in this case, 10 roots would have the desired sum as total over all roots divided by 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 850.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about the sum again.\n\nWe had \\(1/|x_k|^2 = 170 - 26 \\Re(\\omega_k)\\), then the total sum over all 10 roots is 1700 - 26*S, where S = sum_{k=0}^9 Re(\u03c9_k).
