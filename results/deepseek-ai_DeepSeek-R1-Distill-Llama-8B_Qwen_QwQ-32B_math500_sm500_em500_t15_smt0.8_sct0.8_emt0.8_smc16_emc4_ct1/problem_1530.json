The problem states:\n\nLet \\((a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)\\) be a sequence of positive real numbers, such that\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i = 96,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^2 = 144,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i^3 = 216.\n\\]\nFind the sum of all possible values of \\(n\\).\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out all possible values of n that satisfy these three equations. Let me start by thinking about how to relate these sums to each other.\n\nI know that in problems involving sums of powers, sometimes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the Power Mean inequality can be useful. Maybe I can use one of those here. Let me recall what those inequalities say.\n\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real numbers, the square of the sum is less than or equal to the product of the sums of squares. Specifically, in this case, for our sequence \\(a_i\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^2 \\leq n \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\right).\n\\]\nPlugging in our given sums, the left side is \\(96^2 = 9216\\) and the right side is \\(n \\times 144 = 144n\\). So, we can write:\n\\[\n9216 \\leq 144n \\implies n \\geq \\frac{9216}{144}.\n\\]\nCalculating that, \\(144 \\times 64 = 9216\\), so \\(n \\geq 64\\). Okay, that gives me a lower bound for n.\n\nNow, what's the upper bound? I might need another inequality for that. Maybe the Power Mean inequality. The Power Mean inequality tells us that for positive real numbers, the mean of the squares is greater than or equal to the square of the mean. But wait, that's similar to Cauchy-Schwarz and might not give a useful upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, I might think"

H\u00f6lder's inequality generalizes Cauchy-Schwarz and might relate the sums of different powers.\n\nLet me check H\u00f6lder's inequality: For sequences \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n |a_i b_i| \\leq \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n |a_i|^p \\right)^{1/p} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n |b_i|^q \\right)^{1/q},\n\\]\nwhere \\(1/p + 1/q = 1\\). But maybe I can apply it in the case where \\(b_i = 1\\), which would just give the Cauchy-Schwarz result again.\n\nAlternatively, since I have three sums, perhaps I can consider the variance or some other measure.

So maybe n can't be too large, because if n is too big, the sum of cubes would be too small? Wait, no, that's not necessarily straightforward.\n\nWait, actually, the sum of cubes being 216, which might impose another constraint. Let me think about that.\n\nPerhaps I can use H\u00f6lder's inequality for three sums to relate the first, second, and third powers. H\u00f6lder's inequality in the case of three terms would relate the sum of \\(a_i^3\\), but I don't remember the exact form.

Then, the sum of squares would be \\(n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{96^2}{n} = \\frac{9216}{n}\\). But the given sum of squares is 144, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{9216}{n} = 144 \\implies n = \\frac{9216}{144} = 64.\n\\]\nSimilarly, the sum of cubes in the equal case would be \\(n \\times \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^3 = \\frac{96^3}{n^2}\\).

So, when all \\(a_i\\) are equal to \\(\\frac{96}{64} = \\frac{3}{2}\\), then all three given sums match. So, in this case, \\(n=64\\) is a possible value.\n\nBut the question says \"the sum of all possible values of n\". So, is n=64 the only possible value?\n\nWait, maybe not. Because I can't be sure that all \\(a_i\\) must be equal. Perhaps there are other sequences where the sums still add up to 96, 144, and "

Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of vectors. Let me consider the vector of a_i's. The given sums are the first, second, and third moments. The question is asking for possible n such that there exists a vector of positive real numbers with those moments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only solution is n=64, so the answer is 64.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another solution where n= 24?

E[X] Var(X) + 3 E[X]^2 \u03c32 + ... but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the relation that relates the skewness to the third moment. The skewness is E[X^3]/(E[X]^3) - 3(E[X]^2 Var(X))/(E[X]^4).\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering only the Cauchy-Schwarz and Power Mean inequalities, which only give lower bounds on n, and without more constraints, n can only be 64.\n\nThus, perhaps the only possible value is n=64.\n\nHence, the sum of all possible values of n is 64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{64}\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem where \\((a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)\\) is a sequence of positive real numbers such that:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216,\n\\]\nwe need to find the sum of all possible values of \\(n\\).\n\nFirst, we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find a lower bound for \\(n\\):\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\right)^2 \\leq n \\left( \\sum_{i="
