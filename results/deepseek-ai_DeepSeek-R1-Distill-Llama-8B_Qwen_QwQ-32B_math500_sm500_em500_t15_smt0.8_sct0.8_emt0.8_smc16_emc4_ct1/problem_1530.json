The problem states that the sum of these numbers is 96, the sum of their squares is 144, and the sum of their cubes is 216. I need to find the sum of all possible values of \\(n\\).\n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. Since we're dealing with sums of powers of numbers, maybe there's a way to relate these sums to each other or use some known inequalities or equations. I remember that for numbers, knowing their sums, sums of squares, and sums of cubes might relate to the concept of moments in statistics, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the Power Mean inequality. Let me recall what those say. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality relates the sum of products to the product of sums, but I'm not sure it's directly applicable here. The Power Mean inequality states that for positive real numbers, the mean of the \\(k\\)-th powers is greater than or equal to the mean of the \\(m\\)-th powers if \\(k > m\\). So, in this case, maybe I can find some relationship between the means or variances.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the numbers are all equal? If so, then \\(a_1 = a_2 = \\dots = a_n = a\\), so the sums would be \\(na = 96\\), \\(na^2 = 144\\), and \\(na^3 = 216\\). Let me check if this is possible.\n\nFrom the first equation, \\(a = 96/n\\). Plugging this into the second equation: \\(n*(96/n)^2 = 144\\), which simplifies to \\(96^2 / n = 144\\). So \\(n = 96^2 / 144\\). Calculating that: 96 squared is 9216, and 9216 divided by 144 is 64. So \\(n = 64\\). Wait, but then from the third equation, \\(n*(96/n)^3 = 216\\). Plugging \\(n=64\\) in: \\(64*(96/64)^3 = 64*(4^3) = 64*"

So maybe it's a two-number case, like most of the numbers are the same except for one or two. Wait, but \\(n\\) could be any number, so maybe I can use some variance or other approach.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the variance can be calculated from the sums. Let me recall that variance is \\(E[X^2] - (E[X])^2\\). So in terms of the sums, the variance would be \\(\\frac{\\sum a_i^2}{n} - \\left(\\frac{\\sum a_i}{n}\\right)^2\\). Let's compute that: \\(\\frac{144}{n} - \\left(\\frac{96}{n}\\right)^2\\).\n\nSimplifying that: \\(\\frac{144}{n} - \\frac{9216}{n^2}\\). Combine the terms: \\(\\frac{144n - 9216}{n^2}\\).\n\nHmm, but I don't see an immediate connection to the third sum, which is the sum of cubes. Wait, maybe I can express the sum of cubes in terms of the sum and the sum of squares and some other terms. Alternatively, perhaps using Newton's identities.\n\nNewton's identities relate the power sums to the elementary symmetric sums, but that might be a bit involved. Maybe I can look for some relationship between the sums given.\n\nLet me consider the sum of the cubes: \\(\\sum a_i^3\\). I know that \\(\\sum a_i^3 = (\\sum a_i)^3 - 3(\\sum a_i)(\\sum a_i a_j) + 3\\sum a_i a_j a_k\\), where the sums are over distinct \\(i, j, k\\). Hmm, but I don't know the sum of products of two terms or three terms, so maybe that's not helpful directly.\n\nWait, but maybe for a more general approach, since the sum, sum of squares, and sum of cubes are given, perhaps the numbers are all equal except for one number which is different. Wait, but with more variables, that could get complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the sum of the cubes can also be expressed as the sum of (a_i"

The vector of a_i's has a certain norm. The first norm is the L1 norm (sum), the second is the L2 norm squared, and the third is the L3 norm cubed. But I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the problem as an optimization problem. Suppose we want to maximize or minimize n given the constraints. But the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n\", so there might be multiple n's that satisfy the conditions, and we need to find their sum.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there are multiple n's where such a sequence exists, and we need to find all such n and add them up.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is set up so that the numbers are all equal except for one or two terms. Let me try assuming that all but one of the terms are equal. Let me suppose that there are \\(n-1\\) terms equal to some value \\(a\\), and one term equal to \\(b\\). Then, the total sum would be \\((n-1)a + b = 96\\), the sum of squares would be \\((n-1)a^2 + b^2 = 144\\), and the sum of cubes would be \\((n-1)a^3 + b^3 = 216\\). Then, maybe I can solve for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(n\\).\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me denote \\(k = n - 1\\), so that the equations become:\n\n1. \\(ka + b = 96\\)\n2. \\(ka^2 + b^2 = 144\\)\n3. \\(ka^3 + b^3 = 216\\)\n\nWe can try to solve these equations for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(k\\).

So actually, \\(n=64\\) is a valid solution. So my mistake earlier was miscalculating.\n\nTherefore, \\(n=64\\) is a valid solution where all terms are equal to 1.5.

So perhaps all \\(n\\) ≥64 are possible, making the sum of all possible \\(n\\) from 64 to infinity, which is not feasible because the problem expects a finite answer.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another constraint that limits \\(n\\). Let me think again.\n\nWait, from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, \\(n ≥ 64\\). Also, from the Power Mean inequality, the third power mean is greater than or equal to the second power mean. So,\n\n\\((\\frac{\\sum a_i^3}{n})^{1/3} \\geq (\\frac{\\sum a_i^2}{n})^{1/2}\\)\n\nCompute the left side: \\((216/n)^{1/3}\\)\n\nRight side: \\((144/n)^{1/2}\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\((216/n)^{1/3} \\geq (144/n)^{1/2}\\)\n\nRaise both sides to the 6th power to eliminate roots:\n\n(216/n)^2 ≥ (144/n)^3\n\nSo,\n\n(216^2) / n^2 ≥ (144^3) / n^3\n\nMultiply both sides by n^3:\n\n216^2 n ≥ 144^3\n\nCompute 216^2 = 46,656\n\n144^3 = 144*144*144 = (12^2"
