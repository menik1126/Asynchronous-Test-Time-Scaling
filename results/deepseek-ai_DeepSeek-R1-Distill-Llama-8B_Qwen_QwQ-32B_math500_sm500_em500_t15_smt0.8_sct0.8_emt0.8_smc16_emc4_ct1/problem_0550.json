            "output": "First, I need to identify the prices of the stamps from the 70s decade. Looking at the chart, the 70s row shows the prices for each country.\n\nFor Brazil, the price is 13 cents. France is listed as 12 cents, Peru is also 12 cents, and Spain is 6 cents.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of stamps for each country in the 70s. Since there are four countries and each country typically has one stamp per decade, it's reasonable to assume there are four stamps from the 70s.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the total cost by adding up the prices of all four stamps: 13 (Brazil) + 12 (France) + 12 (Peru) + 6 (Spain) equals 43 cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per 70s stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the number of stamps: 43 cents divided by 4 stamps equals 10.75 cents.\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth of a cent, the average price is 10.8 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70's** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the prices of the 70's stamps:**\n   - **Brazil:** 13 cents\n   - **France:** 12 cents\n   - **Peru:** 12 cents\n   - **Spain:** 6 cents\n\n2. **Count the number of 70's stamps (assuming one stamp per country per decade):**\n   - There are **4** stamps from the 70's.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the 70's stamps:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Cost} = 13 \\, (\\text{Brazil}) + 12 \\, (\\text{France}) + 12 \\, (\\text{Peru}) + 6 \\, (\\text{Spain}) = 43 \\, \\text{cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the average price per 70's stamp:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Price} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cost}}{\\text{Number of Stamps}} = \\frac{43}{4} = 10.75 \\, \\text{cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round to the nearest tenth of a cent:**\n   \\[\n   10.75 \\, \\text{cents}"

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
