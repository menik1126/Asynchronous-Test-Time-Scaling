This gives me \\( 3 \\times 5^2 - 4 \\times (5 - a)^2 = 189 \\).\n\nNext, I'll calculate \\( 3 \\times 5^2 \\) which equals 75. So the equation becomes \\( 75 - 4 \\times (5 - a)^2 = 189 \\).\n\nThen, I'll subtract 75 from both sides to isolate the term with the squared variable, resulting in \\( -4 \\times (5 - a)^2 = 114 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by -4 to solve for \\( (5 - a)^2 \\), which gives \\( (5 - a)^2 = -28.5 \\). Since a square of a real number can't be negative, there are no real solutions for \\( a \\).
