Let\u2019s let \\( T \\) represent the weight of one treek, \\( S \\) for one squig, and \\( G \\) for one goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, \"Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee,\" I can write the equation:\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says, \"Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig,\" which gives me a second equation:\n2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with three variables. To find the relationship between T and S, I'll solve the equations step by step. First, I'll solve the second equation for G:\nG = S - 2T.\n\nNext, I'll substitute this expression for G into the first equation:\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T),\nwhich simplifies to:\n10T = 4S - 2T.\n\nTo isolate T, I'll add 2T to both sides:\n12T = 4S.\n\nThen, I'll divide both sides by 4 to find the relationship between T and S:\n3T = S.\n\nSo, one squig weighs the same as three treeks.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( T \\) = weight of one treek\n- \\( S \\) = weight of one squig\n- \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee\n\n**Given:**\n1. **Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.**  \n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.**  \n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1:** Solve Equation 2 for \\( G \\).\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute \\( G \\) from Equation 2 into Equation 1.\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2"
