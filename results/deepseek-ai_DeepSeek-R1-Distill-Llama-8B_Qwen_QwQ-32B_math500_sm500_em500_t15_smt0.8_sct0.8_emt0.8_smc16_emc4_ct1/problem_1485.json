            "output": "I need to simplify the expression √(∛(√(1/729))). Let's start by simplifying the innermost radical.\n\nFirst, I recognize that 1/729 is equal to 1/9³, which is the same as 1/(9³). Since the square root of a cube is the same as raising it to the power of 3/2, √(1/729) becomes (1/729)^(3/2).\n\nNext, I'll evaluate the cube root of this result. The cube root of (1/729)^(3/2) can be simplified by recognizing that (1/729)^(1/3) is 1/9, so (1/729)^(3/2) is the same as (1/9).\n\nThen, I'll take the square root of 1/9. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 9 is 3, so √(1/9) is 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of the original expression is 1/3.\n</think>\n\nLet's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the innermost radical.**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute back into the expression.**\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}} = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the cube root.**\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{1}}{\\sqrt[3]{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Take the square root of the result.**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n**Rationalizing the Denominator:**\nTo eliminate the radical in the denominator, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{"
