            "output": "Alright, so I have this expression to simplify: the cube root of the square root of 1/729. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step. I remember that when dealing with roots, especially nested ones, it's helpful to rewrite them using fractional exponents. \n\nFirst, let me look at the innermost part: the square root of 1/729. I know that a square root can be written as something raised to the power of 1/2. So, sqrt(1/729) is the same as (1/729)^(1/2). Now, simplifying that, 1 is a 1, and 729 is a number I recognize from previous math problems. I think 729 is 9 to the power of 3, which is 9*9*9, right? So, 729 = 9^3. But 9 itself is 3^2, so substituting that in, 729 = (3^2)^3 = 3^(2*3) = 3^6. Therefore, 1/729 is the same as 1/(3^6), which can be written as (1/3)^6 when expressed as a single base raised to an exponent.\n\nSo now, sqrt(1/729) is (1/3)^(6*(1/2)). Multiplying the exponents, 6*(1/2) is 3. So that simplifies to (1/3)^3, which is 1/27. Okay, so the inner part simplifies to 1/27.\n\nNow, the original expression is the cube root of that result. So, cube root of 1/27. Similar to before, a cube root can be written as something raised to the power of 1/3. Therefore, cube root of 1/27 is (1/27)^(1/3). Again, 27 is 3^3, so 27 = 3^3. Hence, 1/27 is (1/3)^3, so raising that to the 1/3 power would give (1/3)^(3*(1/3)) = (1/3)^1 = 1/3. So, the cube root simplifies to 1/3.\n\nWait, but the problem also mentions writing the result with a rational"

            "output": " denominator. Hmm, but 1/3 already has a rational denominator, right? The denominator is 3, which is an integer, so that's rational. Maybe I did something wrong here? Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me retrace the steps. The original problem is sqrt( cube root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). Let me parse that again. The innermost is sqrt(1/729). Let me confirm that step again. \n\nsqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2). Since 729 is 9^3, so 1/729 is 1/(9^3). Then sqrt(1/(9^3)) would be (1/(9^3))^(1/2) = 1/(9^(3/2)). Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express everything in exponents of 3. Let me try that approach again. Let's see:\n\nStarting with sqrt(1/729). Since 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is 3^(-6). Then taking the square root (exponent 1/2) gives 3^(-6*(1/2)) = 3^(-3). So that's 1/(3^3) = 1/27. Okay, that matches my previous result. Then the cube root of that is (1/27)^(1/3). Since 27 is 3^3, so (3^3)^(-1/3) = 3^(-1) = 1/3. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 1/3, which already has a rational denominator. So maybe the problem is expecting that? But perhaps I misread the original problem? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: sqrt( cube root( sqrt(1/729) ) ). Let me parse the order again. The innermost is sqrt(1/729), then the cube root of that result, then the square root of the cube root? Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the order of the roots. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe question is written as sqrt{ \\sqrt"

            "model": "small",
            "output": "[3]{ \\sqrt{1/729} } }, so it's square root of the cube root of the square root of 1/729. So the order is: first sqrt(1/729), then cube root of that, then sqrt of that. Wait, that would be sqrt(cube_root(sqrt(1/729))). Hmm, which would be the same as the cube root being in the middle. So, to clarify:\n\nStart with sqrt(1/729) = 1/27.\n\nThen take the cube root of 1/27, which is 1/3.\n\nThen take the square root of 1/3. Wait a second, that's different from what I thought before. Oh no! I think I misread the order. The original expression is sqrt{ \\sqrt[3]{ \\sqrt{1/729} } }, so the outermost operation is the square root, which would act on the result of the cube root of the square root. So the correct order is:\n\nsqrt(cuberoot( sqrt(1/729) )).\n\nSo first, compute sqrt(1/729) = 1/27.\n\nThen compute cuberoot(1/27) = 1/3.\n\nThen compute sqrt(1/3) = (1/3)^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(3). Which is irrational because sqrt(3) is irrational. So, to rationalize the denominator, we can multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\n1/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nTherefore, the final result would be sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the cube root was the outermost operation, but no, the square root is outermost. I must've misread the LaTeX. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is written as sqrt{ \\sqrt[3]{ \\sqrt{1/729} } }, which in LaTeX is \\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}. So, the order is: the innermost is sqrt(1/729), then cuberoot of that, then square root of that.\n\nSo, that's sqrt( cuberoot( sqrt(1/729) ) ).\n\nTherefore, we have to compute sqrt(cuberoot(sqrt(1/729))). Let's compute step by step.\n\n1. Compute sqrt(1/729):\n\nsqrt"

Let me check: 27*27 is 729? 27*20 is 540, 27*7 is 189, so 540+189=729. Yes, so 27^2 is 729. Wait, but 27 is 3^3, so 27^2 is (3^3)^2 = 3^6. So sqrt(729) is sqrt(27^2) = 27. Therefore, sqrt(1/729) is 1/27. So that part is correct.\n\n2. Then, take the cube root of that result: cuberoot(1/27). Since 27 is 3^3, so cuberoot(1/27) is 1/3. That's correct.\n\n3. Then, take the square root of that result: sqrt(1/3). Which is 1/sqrt(3). Since the problem requires a rational denominator, we need to rationalize this. \n\nTo rationalize 1/sqrt(3), multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):\n\n(1 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, so my initial mistake was misreading the order of the roots. I first thought the cube root was the outermost, but actually the square root is. So that changes the result. Therefore, the correct answer is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nLet me verify this again step by step using exponents to make sure.\n\nStarting with the original expression:\n\nsqrt( cuberoot( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nExpressed with exponents:\n\n[ ( ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) ) ]^("

So the final simplified result is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nI think I had a momentary confusion with the order of the roots, but after carefully re-examining, it makes sense. So the key steps were correctly identifying the order of operations, simplifying each root step by step, and then rationalizing the denominator when necessary.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated step by step by simplifying each root, resulting in \\(\\sqrt{3}/3\\) after rationalizing.\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}\\)"
