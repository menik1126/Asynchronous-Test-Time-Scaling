Converting this to revolutions per second, I'll multiply by 60 seconds per minute and then divide by 60 to get the number of seconds per revolution. \n\nNext, Gear B makes 45 revolutions per minute. I'll perform a similar conversion to find its revolutions per second.\n\nWith both gears now expressed in revolutions per second, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods to determine when they'll both simultaneously align their marks due north. The LCM of the two periods will give the time in seconds when this alignment occurs.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate and present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Gear A** turns \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) times in a minute.\n- **Gear B** turns 45 times in a minute.\n- Both gears start with a mark pointing due north.\n\n**Objective:**\nFind the number of seconds after which both gears will again have their marks pointing due north.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand Gear Rotations:**\n   - A full rotation of a gear brings its mark back to the initial position (due north).\n   - Therefore, we need to find when both gears complete an integer number of full rotations simultaneously.\n\n2. **Convert Rotations to Revolutions per Minute:**\n   - **Gear A:** \\(33\\frac{1}{3}\\) revolutions per minute.\n   - **Gear B:** 45 revolutions per minute.\n\n3. **Convert Revolutions per Minute to Revolutions per Second:**\n   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.\n   - **Gear A:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revolutions per second} = 33\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{60}{60} = 33.\\overline{3} \\text{ rev/s}\n     \\]\n   - **Gear B:**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Revolutions per second} = 45 \\times \\frac{60}{60} = 45 \\text{ rev/s}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of"
