I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the maximum possible gcd for these two expressions as \\( n \\) varies over the positive integers.\n\nLet me start by recalling how to compute the gcd of two numbers. One common method is the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here. The Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then taking the remainder, repeating the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.\n\nSo, let's let \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). Then, I can write \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\).\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm, I can subtract an appropriate multiple of one from the other to get a smaller expression. Specifically, I can compute \\( 2n + 1 - 2(n + 7) \\). Let's see:\n\n\\( 2n + 1 - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\).\n\nWait, that's helpful because 13 is a prime number. So, the gcd can only be either 1 or 13 because those are the divisors of 13.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd is 13, provided that \\( n + 7 \\) is a multiple of 13. So, we need \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\), which implies \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, the smallest such \\( n \\) would be \\( 13 - 7 = 6 \\), but actually, \\( n \\) can be any number congruent to 6 modulo 13, like 6, 19, 32, and so on.\n\nLet me test this"

So, \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\).\n\nAnother example: \\( n = 19 \\) (since 19 ≡ 6 mod 13).\n\n\\( n + 7 = 26 \\), and \\( 2n + 1 = 39 \\). \\( \\gcd(26, 39) = 13 \\), because 26 and 39 are both multiples of 13.\n\nSo, that seems to work. But just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me consider if the gcd can be larger than 13. Since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13. So, it's impossible for the gcd to be greater than 13. Therefore, 13 is indeed the maximum possible value.\n\nWait, but just to ensure, let me pick another \\( n \\) not of the form 13k - 7. For example, \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\( n + 7 = 8 \\), and \\( 2n + 1 = 3 \\). \\( \\gcd(8, 3) = 1 \\).\n\nAnother one: \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n\\( n + 7 = 9 \\), \\( 2n + 1 = 5 \\). \\( \\gcd(9, 5) = 1 \\).\n\nAnd \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\( n + 7 = 12 \\), \\( 2n + 1 = 11 \\). \\( \\gcd(12, 11) = 1 \\).\n\nSo, in cases where \\( n + 7 \\) isn't a multiple of 13, the gcd drops to 1, as expected.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's explore the general case. Suppose \\( d \\) is a common divisor of \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). Then, \\( d \\) divides \\( 2n + 1 \\) and \\( n + 7 \\). So, \\( d \\) divides their linear combinations as well.\n\nLet's compute \\( 2n + 1 - 2(n + 7) = -13 \\). So, \\("
