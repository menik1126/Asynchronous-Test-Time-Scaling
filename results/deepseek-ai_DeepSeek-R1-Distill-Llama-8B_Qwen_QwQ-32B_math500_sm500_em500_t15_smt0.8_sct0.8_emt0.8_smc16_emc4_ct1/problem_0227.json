            "output": "To determine how far Bill is from his starting point, I'll break down his movements into a southward and eastward displacement.\n\nFirst, Bill walks half a mile south, which means his vertical displacement is 0.5 miles south. Then, he walks three-quarters of a mile east, resulting in a horizontal displacement of 0.75 miles east. Finally, he walks an additional half a mile south, bringing his total southward displacement to 1 mile.\n\nNext, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the straight-line distance from his starting point. This involves squaring both the total southward and eastward distances, summing them, taking the square root of the sum, and rounding the result to the nearest hundredth.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down Bill's journey and calculate his straight-line distance from the starting point using basic geometry.\n\n**Step 1: Sum the Southward Displacements**\nBill walks **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)** mile south and then another **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)** mile south. \n\\[\n\\text{Total Southward Distance} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Eastward Displacement**\nBill walks **\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)** mile east.\n\\[\n\\text{Eastward Distance} = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe straight-line distance (direct line) from the starting point can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Southward Distance})^2 + (\\text{Eastward Distance})^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(1)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.25}\n\\]"
