This means his net southward movement is increased by 1/2 mile.\n\nNext, he walks 3/4 mile east, contributing to his eastward position.\n\nFinally, he walks an additional 1/2 mile south, which means his total southward movement becomes 1 mile.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from the starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. The horizontal component is 3/4 mile, and the vertical component is 1 mile.\n\nCalculating the direct distance:\nDistance = sqrt((3/4)^2 + (1)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.5625 + 1) ≈ sqrt(1.5625) ≈ 1.25 miles.\n\nSo, Bill is approximately 1.25 miles away from his starting point in a straight line.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how far Bill is from his starting point in a direct line, we'll analyze his movements step by step.\n\n1. **Southward Movement:**\n   - Bill walks **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)** mile **south**.\n   - Then, he walks another **\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)** mile **south**.\n   - **Total Southward Movement:** \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\) mile.\n\n2. **Eastward Movement:**\n   - Bill walks **\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)** mile **east**.\n   - **Total Eastward Movement:** \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile.\n\n3. **Calculating the Straight-Line Distance:**\n   - To find the straight-line distance from the starting point, we can use the Pythagorean theorem.\n   - Let:\n     - \\( x = \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile (eastward).\n     - \\( y = 1 \\) mile (southward).\n   - The straight-line distance \\( d \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{(\\frac{3}{4})^2 + (1)^2}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     d = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} +"
