This is done by dividing 42 by 5, then 25, 125, and so on, taking the integer part of each division and adding them up.\n\nI'll then count the number of 2s in the prime factors of 42! using the same method. Since there are typically more 2s than 5s, the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, I'll add the number of 5s to find the total number of trailing zeros in 42!.\n\nI should double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy and avoid any errors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times \\(10\\) is a factor in \\(42!\\). Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). Typically, there are more factors of \\(2\\) than \\(5\\), so the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times \\(5\\) is a factor in \\(42!\\).\n\n**Step 1: Count the number of 5s in \\(42!\\)**\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{125} \\right\\rfloor = 0\n\\]\nAdding these, we get:\n\\[\n8 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of 2s in \\(42!\\)**\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 21\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{4} \\right\\"
