            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many zeros are at the end of 42! (which is 42 factorial). Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is related to how many times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. But since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I think the number of trailing zeros depends on the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factors of 42!.\n\nWait, but I also recall that in factorials, there are usually more 2s than 5s. So, the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros because each 10 requires one 2 and one 5, and since there are more 2s, the 5s will be the limiting factor.\n\nSo, to find out how many times 5 appears in the prime factors of 42!, I can use the formula where I divide 42 by 5, then divide the result by 5 again, and keep going until the result is less than 1.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nFirst, 42 divided by 5. 5 times 8 is 40, so 42 ÷ 5 is 8.4. But since we're dealing with whole numbers, I take the floor of that, which is 8. So, there are 8 multiples of 5 in 42!.\n\nNext, I take those 8 and divide by 5 again because each multiple of 25 contributes an extra 5. 8 ÷ 5 is 1.6, so taking the floor again gives me 1. So, there's 1 multiple of 25 in 42!.\n\nNow, adding those up: 8 + 1 equals 9. So, does that mean there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!? Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, when you divide 42 by 5, that gives the number of multiples of 5. Each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, but every multiple of 25 (which is 5 squared) contributes an extra 5. Similarly, multiples of 125 (5 cubed) would contribute yet another 5, but 125 is greater than 42, so we can stop at 25.\n\nSo, confirming the calculation:\n\nNumber of 5s = floor(42/5) + floor("

Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me test with a smaller number to see if the method works. Let's take 10!.\n\n10! is 3628800, which has two trailing zeros. Applying the formula:\n\nfloor(10/5) = 2, floor(10/25)=0. So total 2, which matches. Good.\n\nAnother test: 25!.\n\n25/5 =5, 25/25=1, so total 5+1=6. Let me see, 25! ends with 6 zeros. Let me check 25! value... Well, 25! is a big number, but I can trust the formula here.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to 42! gives 8 +1 =9. Hmm, so the answer should be 9?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me count the number of 5s in 42!.\n\nNumbers divisible by 5 up to 42 are 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40. That's 8 numbers. But 25 is 5x5, so it contributes an extra 5. Similarly, 50 would be another, but 50 is beyond 42. So, only 25 adds an extra. So total 8 +1 =9. That seems right.\n\nTherefore, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning here. So the final answer should be 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of trailing zeros in 42! is \\boxed"

Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5.\n\nWe use the formula where we divide 42 by 5, then divide the result by 5 again, and keep going until the result is less than 1.\n\n1. Divide 42 by 5:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   This gives the number of multiples of 5 in 42!.\n\n2. Divide the result by 5 again:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{8}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n   \\]\n   This gives the number of multiples of 25 in 42!, each contributing an extra factor of 5.\n\n3. Higher powers of 5 (like 125) will not contribute since 125 is greater than 42.\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n8 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of trailing zeros in \\(42!\\) is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."
