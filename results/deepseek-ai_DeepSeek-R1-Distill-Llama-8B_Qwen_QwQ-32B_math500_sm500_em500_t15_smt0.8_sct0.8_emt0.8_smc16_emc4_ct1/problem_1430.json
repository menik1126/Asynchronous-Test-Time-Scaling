This is helpful because it simplifies the problem.\n\nNext, I recall that for a number to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be divisible by \\( n \\). In this case, the exponent is 24, so \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\nI'll list all the positive divisors of 24. These are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. However, the problem specifies that \\( n \\) must be greater than 1, so I exclude 1 from the list.\n\nFinally, I count the remaining divisors to find the number of valid \\( n \\) values. There are 7 such divisors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) make \\( 2^{24} \\) a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition:**\n   - A number \\( A \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that \\( A = k^n \\).\n   - For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, \\( n \\) must divide the exponent in its prime factorization.\n\n2. **Prime Factorization:**\n   - \\( 2^{24} \\) is already in its prime factorized form.\n\n3. **Determine Divisors of the Exponent:**\n   - The exponent is 24.\n   - The positive divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n\n4. **Exclude \\( n = 1 \\):**\n   - Since \\( n > 1 \\),"
