            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of the 7 available. This can be calculated using the combination formula, which is denoted as C(n, k). So, the number of ways to choose the boys is C(7, 3).\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to select 2 girls out of the 4 available using the same combination formula. That would be C(4, 2).\n\nAfter finding the number of ways to choose the boys and girls separately, I'll multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of ways to form the group. This is because for each way of choosing the boys, there are multiple ways to choose the girls, and these choices are independent of each other.\n\nFinally, I'll simplify the expression by calculating the numerical value of each combination and then multiplying them to obtain the total number of unique groups that can be formed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll use the concept of combinations. The order of selection doesn't matter, so we'll use the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two results to find the total number of ways to form the group.**\n\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\nSo, the total number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls is \\(\\boxed{210}\\)."
