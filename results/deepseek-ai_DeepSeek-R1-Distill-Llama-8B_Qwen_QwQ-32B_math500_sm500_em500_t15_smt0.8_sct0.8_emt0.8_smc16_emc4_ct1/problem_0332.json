To calculate the number of ways to choose the boys, I can use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nCalculating C(7, 3):\n7! / (3! * (7 - 3)!) = 7! / (3! * 4!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35 ways.\n\nNext, there are 4 girls in the class. Mr. Brennan needs to select 2 girls. Using the combination formula again to find the number of ways to choose the girls: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!).\n\nCalculating C(4, 2):\n4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6 ways.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to choose 3 boys and 2 girls, I multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls, because for each way of choosing the boys, there are multiple ways to choose the girls.\n\nTotal combinations = C(7, 3) * C(4, 2) = 35 * 6 = 210 ways.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nMr. Brennan has a total of 7 boys and 4 girls in his statistics class. He wants to select a group of 3 boys and 2 girls for the presentation. The order of selection does not matter, so we will use combinations to solve this problem.\n\n1. **Calculating the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   The number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7 is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = "
