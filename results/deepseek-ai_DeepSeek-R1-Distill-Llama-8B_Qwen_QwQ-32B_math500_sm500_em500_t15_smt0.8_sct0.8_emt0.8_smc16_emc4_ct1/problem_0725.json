            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to solve. Let me read it again: If log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then I need to find x. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So, that should simplify to log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. \n\nMultiplying (x - y) and (x + y) gives me x² - y². So, the equation becomes log₆(x² - y²) = 2. To get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, 6^2 = x² - y², which means 36 = x² - y². Okay, so that's one equation.\n\nNow, the second equation is log_y(5x) = 2. Similar to before, I can convert this logarithm to its exponential form. That would mean y^2 = 5x. So, now I have two equations:\n\n1. 36 = x² - y²\n2. y² = 5x\n\nHmm, maybe I can substitute the second equation into the first one. Let me try that. If y² is equal to 5x, then I can replace y² in the first equation with 5x. So, 36 = x² - 5x. \n\nNow, I can rewrite this as a quadratic equation: x² - 5x - 36 = 0. I need to solve for x here. Let me see if I can factor this quadratic, but I'm not sure. Let me check the discriminant first. The discriminant is b² - 4ac, which in this case is (-5)^2 - 4*1*(-36) = 25 + 144 = 169. Oh, that's a perfect square, so the roots will be real and rational.\n\nThe solutions are given"

            "output": " by x = [5 ± sqrt(169)] / 2, which is [5 ± 13] / 2. So, x = (5 + 13)/2 = 18/2 = 9, or x = (5 - 13)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4. \n\nWait a second. Since the original logs are defined, the arguments must be positive. Let me check if x is negative. If x is -4, then looking back at the first equation, we have log₆(x - y). If x is -4, then x - y could be negative or positive depending on y, but since x and y are in logarithmic expressions, the arguments must be positive. So, x must be positive, so x = -4 is invalid.\n\nSo, x must be 9. Now, I'll find y using the second equation, which is y² = 5x. Plugging in x=9, y² = 5*9 = 45. Therefore, y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Hmm, again, since y is inside a logarithm, y must be positive. So, y = sqrt(45) = 3*sqrt(5). \n\nWait, but let me double-check the first equation with x=9 and y=3√5. Then, x - y = 9 - 3√5, and x + y = 9 + 3√5. Are these positive? Yes, because 3√5 is approximately 6.7, so 9 - 6.7 is about 2.3, which is positive. So, both arguments of the logarithm are positive, which is good.\n\nLet me also verify the second equation. If y = 3√5, then log_y(5x) = log_{3√5}(5*9) = log_{3√5}(45). Let me compute this. Since y = 3√5, then y² = (3√5)^2 = 9*5 = 45. So, log_{3√5}(45) = log_{3√5}(y²) = 2, because y² = 5x = 45. So, this equals 2, which matches the equation. Perfect.\n\nAlternatively, if y were negative, we would have issues because logarithms of"

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nFirst equation simplified to x² - y² = 36, second equation gave y² = 5x. Substituted into first equation, solved quadratic, got x=9 and x=-4. Discarded x=-4 because logs would have negative arguments. Then found y, checked validity, and confirmed that everything works. \n\nHmm, seems solid. I don't see any mistakes here.
