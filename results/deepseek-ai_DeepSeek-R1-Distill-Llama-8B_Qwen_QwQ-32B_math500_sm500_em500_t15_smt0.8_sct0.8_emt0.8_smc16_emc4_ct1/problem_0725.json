            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here that I need to solve. It involves logarithms, which I remember are kind of like the opposite of exponents. Let me try to write it down first to visualize it better.\n\nThe problem says: If log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then find x. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack. I think I should handle each equation separately and see if I can find relationships between x and y that will help me solve for x.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log6(x - y) + log6(x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So, using the logarithm product rule, log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(ac). Applying that here, this equation becomes log6[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nNow, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, which simplifies to x² - y². So, the equation now is log6(x² - y²) = 2. To get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remembering that if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So, 6^2 = x² - y², which simplifies to 36 = x² - y². Let me write that down as equation (1): x² - y² = 36.\n\nOkay, moving on to the second equation: log base y of 5x equals 2. So, log_y(5x) = 2. Again, I'll convert this logarithmic equation to its exponential form. That means y^2 = 5x. Let me note this as equation (2): y² = 5x.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1. x² - y² = 36\n2. y² = 5x\n\nHmm, maybe I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to eliminate y². Let's try that. From equation (2), y² = 5x. So, I can replace y² in equation (1) with 5x"

I can try to factor this, or use the quadratic formula if factoring isn't straightforward.\n\nLet me see if I can factor it. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6. Let's see: 6 and -6 would multiply to -36, but 6 + (-6) is 0. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 9 and -4: 9 * (-4) = -36, and 9 + (-4) = 5. But I need them to add to -5, so maybe -9 and 4? Then (-9) + 4 = -5. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, the quadratic can be factored as (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\nx - 9 = 0 => x = 9\nx + 4 = 0 => x = -4\n\nNow, I have two possible solutions for x: 9 and -4. But I need to check if these solutions make sense in the original equations because sometimes when dealing with logarithms, you can get extraneous solutions that don't satisfy the original conditions.\n\nLet's check x = 9 first. Then, from equation (2), y² = 5x = 5*9 = 45. So, y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But since y is the base of a logarithm in the second equation log_y(5x) = 2, y must be positive and not equal to 1. So, y = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708.\n\nNow, let's check if this satisfies equation (1): x² - y² = 36.\n\nCalculating x²: 9² = 81\nCalculating y²: (sqrt(45))² = 45\nSo, 81 - 45 = "

            "output": "36, which equals the right side. So, x =9 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, checking x = -4. From equation (2), y² = 5*(-4) = -20. Wait, y² equals a negative number? That's impossible because a square of a real number can't be negative. Therefore, y² = -20 has no real solution, so x = -4 is an extraneous solution and must be discarded.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x =9.\n\nWait, but let me just verify this with the original logarithmic equations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst equation: log6(x - y) + log6(x + y) = 2.\n\nIf x =9 and y² =45, then y = sqrt(45) ≈6.708. So, x - y =9 -6.708 ≈2.292, and x + y ≈15.708.\n\nTaking log base 6 of both products: log6(2.292 *15.708) = log6(36). Since 2.292 *15.708 is approximately 36. Yes, log6(36)=2 because 6²=36. So, the first equation holds.\n\nSecond equation: log_y(5x) =2. So, y^2=5x. Here, x=9, so 5x=45, and y²=45, which matches our earlier calculation. So, y= sqrt(45). Thus, log_{sqrt(45)}(45) = 2. Because (sqrt(45))^2 =45, so log_{sqrt(45)}(45) = log_{sqrt(45)}(sqrt(45)^2) =2, since (sqrt(45))^2 is indeed 45. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, x=9 is the correct and only valid solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start with the two equations:\n\n1. \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\)\n2. \\(\\log_y (5x) = 2\\)\n\n**Step 1:** Simplify the first equation using the product rule of logarithms:\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2 \\implies \\log_6 (x^2 - y^"
