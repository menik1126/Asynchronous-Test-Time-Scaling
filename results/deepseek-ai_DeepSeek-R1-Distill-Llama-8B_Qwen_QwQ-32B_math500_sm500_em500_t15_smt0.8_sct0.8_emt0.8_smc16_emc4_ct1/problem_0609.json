            "output": "To determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, I will start by finding its prime factorization.\n\nFirst, I recognize that 196 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98.\n\nNext, I take 98 and divide it by 2 again to obtain 49. Now, 49 is no longer divisible by 2, so I move on to the next prime number, which is 3. However, 49 divided by 3 does not result in a whole number.\n\nSince 3 is not a factor, I try the next prime number, which is 7. Dividing 49 by 7 yields 7. Finally, 7 divided by 7 equals 1. This means the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared, 7 squared, and 7 cubed.\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, I add one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply these results. So, (2 + 1) multiplied by (3 + 1) gives me 3 times 4, which equals 12. Therefore, 196 has 12 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of 196.**\n\n   - **196 ÷ 2 = 98** → 2 is a prime factor.\n   - **98 ÷ 2 = 49** → 2² is now a factor.\n   - **49 ÷ 7 = 7** → 7 is a prime factor.\n   - **7 ÷ 7 = 1** → 7² is now a factor.\n\n   So, **196 = 2² × 7²**.\n\n2. **Use the formula for the number of divisors.**\n\n   If a number \\( N \\) has the prime factorization \\( N = p₁^{a} × p₂^{b} × \\dots × pₙ^{k} \\), the total number of positive divisors is:\n\n   \\[\n   (a + 1) × (b + 1) × \\dots × (k + 1)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the formula to 196.**\n\n   Here, \\( a = 2 \\) (from"

Let me check again.\n\n   **Correction:**  \n   Wait, in step 1, I mistakenly wrote \"7 cubed\" but actually, 49 is \\( 7^2 \\). So the prime factorization is indeed \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\). Thus, exponents are both 2. Applying the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n   But earlier I thought it was 12. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\n   Wait, in my initial reasoning, I said \"2 squared, 7 squared, and 7 cubed\" which was a mistake. The correct prime factors are \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\). Therefore, the correct calculation is \\( (2+1)(2+1) = 9 \\).\n\n   Wait, but let me verify by listing all divisors:\n\n   Divisors of 196 are:\n   1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196 → total of 9 divisors.\n\n   So the correct answer is 9. My initial mistake was in the first draft where I incorrectly stated exponents as 2 and 3, but the correct exponents are both 2.\n\n   Therefore, the correct number of divisors is **9**.\n\n\\boxed{9}"
