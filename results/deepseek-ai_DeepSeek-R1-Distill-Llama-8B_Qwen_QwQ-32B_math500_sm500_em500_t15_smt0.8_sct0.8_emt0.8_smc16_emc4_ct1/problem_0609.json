Starting with the smallest prime, I divide by 2, resulting in 98. Dividing 98 by 2 again gives me 49.\n\nNext, I'll factorize 49. The prime factor is 7, and 49 divided by 7 is 7. Additionally, 7 divided by 7 equals 1.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is \\( 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\).\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is \\((e_1 + 1) \\times (e_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots \\times (e_n + 1)\\), where \\( e \\) represents the exponents in the prime factorization:\n\nApplying this to 196, the exponents are 2 and 2.
