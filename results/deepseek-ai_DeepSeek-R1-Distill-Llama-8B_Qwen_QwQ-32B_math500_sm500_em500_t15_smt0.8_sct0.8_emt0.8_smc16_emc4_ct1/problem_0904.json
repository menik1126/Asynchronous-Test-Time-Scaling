To do this, I'll adjust the exponents of both 2 and 5 in the denominator so that the power of 2 is the highest. This means increasing the power of 5 in the denominator to match the power of 2, which is 4. \n\nNext, I'll make the denominator a power of 2 by converting the 5^7 into a form that can be combined with 2^4. I'll do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2^(7-4) to maintain the equality of the fraction. This adjustment transforms the denominator into 2^(4+7) = 2^11.\n\nNow, the fraction has a denominator that is a power of 2, which means it will definitely terminate when expressed as a decimal. I'll divide the numerator by the denominator to find the decimal equivalent. Finally, I'll round the result to the appropriate number of decimal places to complete the conversion.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express the Denominator with Equal Exponents:**\n   - To simplify the fraction, make the exponents of 2 and 5 equal.\n   - The current exponents are \\(2^2\\) and \\(5^7\\).\n   - The highest exponent is \\(7\\) for \\(5\\).

Since \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\), to make it \\(10^n\\), we need equal exponents for 2 and 5. The exponent of 5 is higher (7 vs. 2), so we need to multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^{5}\\) to get \\(2^{7}\\) in the denominator. \n\nCalculating \\(2^5 = 32\\), so numerator becomes \\(21 \\times 32 = 672\\). The denominator becomes \\(2^7 \\times 5^7 = (2 \\times 5)^7 = 10^7\\). \n\nTherefore, \\(\\frac{672}{10^7}\\) is indeed 0.0000672. Wait, hold on, 10^7 is 10,000,000. So 672 divided by 10,000,000 moves the decimal seven places: 0.0000672. But in my previous step I wrote 0.0006720. That's a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 672 divided by 10^7: \n\n672 divided by 10^3 is 0.672, so divided by 10^7 is 0.0000672. So the correct decimal is 0.0000672. \n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the first calculation? Let me recalculate:\n\nOriginal fraction: 21/(2²×5⁷). \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2⁵:\n\nNumerator: 21×32 = 672.\n\nDenominator: (2²×2⁵) ×5⁷ = 2⁷×5⁷ = 10⁷.\n\nThus, 672/10⁷ = 0.0000672. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 0.0000672. \n\nWait, but in my first step I had"

            "output": " 0.0006720, which was incorrect because I forgot to move the decimal enough places. \n\nLet me confirm once more: \n\nSince 10⁷ is 10,000,000, so 672 divided by 10,000,000 is:\n\n- Start with 672 ÷ 10 = 67.2\n- Then ÷10 = 6.72\n- Then ÷10 = 0.672\n- Then ÷10 = 0.0672\n- Then ÷10 = 0.00672\n- Then ÷10 = 0.000672\n- Then ÷10 = 0.0000672\n\nYes, that's 0.0000672. So the correct terminating decimal is 0.0000672.\n\nBut wait, let's check with another method: Expressing 21/(2²×5⁷) as 21/(4×78125) = 21/312500. \n\nCalculate 21 ÷ 312500:\n\n312500 goes into 21 zero times. Add decimal: 312500 goes into 210000 zero times. 312500 goes into 2100000 zero times. \n\nWait, maybe a better way is to compute 21 ÷ 312500. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 21: 1 ÷ (312500/21) ≈ 1 ÷ 14861.90... \n\nBut to get the exact decimal, perform long division:\n\n312500 | 21.000000...\n\n312500 goes into 210000 0 times. 312500 goes into 2100000 0 times. 312500 goes into 21000000 0 times.\n\nWait, this is getting cumbersome. Alternatively, since 1/312500 = 0.0000032, so 21/312500 = 21 × 0.0000032 = 0.0000672.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So the correct answer is 0.0000672.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had 0.0006720. That was a mistake because I incorrectly placed the decimal.\n\nTherefore, the accurate terminating decimal is 0.0000672.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0000672}\n\\]"
