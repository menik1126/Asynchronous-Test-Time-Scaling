            "output": "First, I'll calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h. The radius of the beaker is 3 cm, and its height is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, the volume of one beaker is π * (3)² * 8 = 72π cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius. Given that the radius of the tank is 6 cm, the volume is (4/3)π * 6³ = (4/3)π * 216 = 288π cubic centimeters.\n\nFinally, I'll find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank by dividing the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker. So, 288π / 72π = 4. Therefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{cylinder}} \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( r \\) is the radius of the base of the cylinder\n   - \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder\n\n   Given:\n   - Radius \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   - Height \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere\n\n   Given:\n   - Radius \\( R = "
