Given that the radius of the beaker is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, I can plug these values into the formula to find the volume.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. The radius of the sphere is 6 cm, so I'll substitute this value into the formula to compute the volume of the tank.\n\nAfter calculating both volumes, I'll divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank. This will give me the exact number of beakers required to completely fill the spherical tank with water.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA cylindrical beaker is 8 cm high and has a radius of 3 cm. How many such beakers of water will it take to fill a spherical tank of radius 6 cm?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( r \\) is the radius of the cylinder\n   - \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder\n\n   Given:\n   - Radius of the cylinder, \\( r = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   - Height of the cylinder, \\( h = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere\n\n   Given:\n   - Radius of"
