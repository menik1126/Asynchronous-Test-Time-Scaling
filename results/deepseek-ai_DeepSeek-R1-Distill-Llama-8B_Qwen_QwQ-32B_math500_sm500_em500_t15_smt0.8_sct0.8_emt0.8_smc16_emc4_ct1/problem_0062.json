            "output": "To determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders, I'll analyze the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of male and female bus riders for each grade by applying the percentages to the total number of students surveyed (300 males and 300 females).\n\nFor each grade, I'll calculate:\n- **Males**: (Percentage of males) \u00d7 300\n- **Females**: (Percentage of females) \u00d7 300\n\nOnce I have these values, I'll compare the number of male bus riders to 135% of the number of female bus riders. This involves setting up the inequality:\n\n**Male Bus Riders = 1.35 \u00d7 Female Bus Riders**\n\nI'll solve for Male Bus Riders and then calculate the percentage difference between the actual males and the target (135% of females) for each grade. The goal is to find the smallest percentage difference.\n\nFinally, I'll identify the grade with the closest percentage difference and present that as the answer.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the data step by step to determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Data\nWe are given the percentage of male and female bus riders in each grade for a total of 300 males and 300 females surveyed in each grade.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Actual Number of Males and Females\nFor simplicity, let's assume each grade has 300 male and 300 female students surveyed.\n\n| Grade       | Males (%) | Females (%) |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 9th grade   | 41.1      | 39.4      |\n| 10th grade  | 34.4      | 33.1      |\n| 11th grade  | 20.6      | 13.8      |\n| 12th grade  | 11.6      | 8.6       |\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Actual Number of Bus Riders\n- **Total Students per Grade:** 300 males + 300 females = 600 students\n- **Males per Grade:** (Percentage of males / 100) \u00d7 300\n- **Females per Grade:** (Percentage of females / 100) \u00d7 300\n\n| Grade       | Males       | Females      |\n|-------------|-------------"
