Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the expression. It's a cube root inside a square root, which is then inside another square root. That might sound complicated, but if I take it one layer at a time, it should be manageable.\n\nLet me write down the expression properly: √(∛(√(1/729))). So, starting from the inside, I have the square root of 1/729. Then, that result is inside a cube root, and finally, that cube root is inside another square root.\n\nAlright, starting with the innermost part: √(1/729). I know that the square root of a fraction can be expressed as the square root of the numerator divided by the square root of the denominator. So, √(1/729) is the same as √1 divided by √729. Since √1 is 1, that simplifies to 1/√729.\n\nNow, √729 is something I should figure out. I recall that 729 is a perfect square because 27 times 27 is 729. Wait, let me double-check: 27 times 27 is indeed 729. So, √729 is 27. Therefore, √(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nSo, now the expression becomes √(∛(1/27)). Next, I need to compute the cube root of 1/27. Cube roots of fractions are straightforward: the cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 27 is 3, because 3 cubed is 27. So, ∛(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nNow, substituting back into the expression, we have √(1/3). Again, this is another square root of a fraction. As before, I can separate this into √1 divided by √3, which is 1/√3.\n\nSo, now the expression is 1/√3. However, the problem asks for the result with a rational denominator. I remember that rationalizing the denominator means getting rid of the square root in the denominator. To do this, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by √3"

            "output": ".\n\nLet's see: (1 * √3) / (√3 * √3) = √3 / 3. The denominator now is 3, which is rational, and the numerator is √3, so it's properly rationalized.\n\nPutting it all together, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is √3 divided by 3.\n\nWait, let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from √(1/729), that's 1/27. Then the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then the square root of 1/3 is 1/√3, and rationalizing that gives √3/3. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could express each step using exponents to see if it changes anything. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe original expression is √(∛(√(1/729))). Using exponents, the square root is the same as raising to the power of 1/2, and the cube root is the same as raising to the power of 1/3. So, starting from the inside:\n\nFirst, compute √(1/729): that's (1/729)^(1/2).\n\nThen, take the cube root of that result: [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n\nWait, 1/729 is actually (1/9^3), because 9 cubed is 729. So, 1/729 is (1/9)^3. Therefore, (1/729)^(1/6) can be expressed as [(1/9)^3]^(1/6) = (1/9)^(3*(1/6)) = (1/9)^(1/2) = √(1/9) = 1/3.\n\nWait, so that's another way to look at it. So, the entire expression simplifies down to 1/3. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because earlier I got √3/3. There must be some inconsistency here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in translating the exponents. Let me re-examine.\n\nStarting from the inside out: √(1/729) is 1/27, as I had before. Then, the cube root of 1/27"

So that's correct.\n\nBut when I tried the exponent approach, I thought of the entire expression as (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2). Wait, maybe I messed up the order of exponents.\n\nLet me see. The original expression is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nBreaking down the exponents step by step:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as:\n\nsqrt( [ cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) ] )\n\nFirst, sqrt(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2).\n\nThen, cube_root of that is [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n\nThen, the outer sqrt is [ (1/729)^(1/6) ]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nWait, so that's different from my previous exponent approach. Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent multiplication earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe entire expression is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nLet me write each operation as exponents:\n\nsqrt is exponent 1/2,\n\ncube_root is exponent 1/3,\n\ninner sqrt is exponent 1/2.\n\nSo, the order is:\n\nStart with (1/729)^(1/2) for the inner sqrt,\n\nthen take that result to the 1/3 power for the cube root,\n\nthen take that result to the 1/2 power for the outer sqrt.\n\nTherefore, the total exponent is (1/2) * (1/3) * (1/2) ?\n\nWait, no, actually, the exponents multiply in sequence. Let me see:\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nFirst exponent: inner sqrt: (1/729)^(1/2)\n\nSecond exponent: cube root: [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729"

Let me compute (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nBut 729 is 9^3, which is 3^6. So, (1/3^6)^(1/12) = (1)^1/(3^6 * 1/12) = 1/3^(6*(1/12)) = 1/3^(1/2) = 1/√3.\n\nWhich is the same result as before. So, 1/√3, then rationalize to √3/3.\n\nSo, that approach gives the same answer as the step-by-step method. So, that seems consistent.\n\nI think earlier when I was trying to express in exponents, I may have made a mistake in the order of operations or in how the exponents were being applied. But upon recalculating, both methods lead me to 1/√3, which rationalizes to √3/3.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute this numerically to check:\n\nCompute 1/729: that's approximately 0.001371742.\n\nThen, take the square root of that: sqrt(0.001371742) ≈ 0.037037.\n\nThen, take the cube root of 0.037037. Cube root of 0.037037: since 0.037 is approximately (1/3), and cube root of 1/3 is roughly 0.693.\n\nWait, no, wait: 0.037 is 1/27, and cube root of 1/27 is 1/3, which is approximately 0.333.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nIf I have 1/729 ≈ 0.001371742.\n\nTake the square root: sqrt(0.001371742) ≈ 0.037037.\n\nThen, take the cube root of 0.037037. Let's compute 0.037037^(1/3). So, 0.037 is close to 1/27, as 1/27 ≈ 0.037037.\n\nSo, cube root of "

So that matches.\n\nTherefore, the numerical approach also confirms that the result is √3/3.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. Let me just recap all the steps again to ensure there's no mistake.\n\n1. Start with the innermost radical: √(1/729).\n\n   - √(1) = 1, √(729) = 27, so √(1/729) = 1/27.\n\n2. Next, take the cube root of 1/27.\n\n   - ∛(1) = 1, ∛(27) = 3, so ∛(1/27) = 1/3.\n\n3. Then, take the square root of 1/3.\n\n   - √(1/3) = (√1)/√3 = 1/√3.\n\n4.
