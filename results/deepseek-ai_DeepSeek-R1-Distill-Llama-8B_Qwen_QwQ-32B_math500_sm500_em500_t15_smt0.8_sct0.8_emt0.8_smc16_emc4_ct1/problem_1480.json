            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of the cube root of the square root of 1/729. Hmm, let me write that down step by step to make it clearer.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is the square root of 1/729. I know that 729 is 9 to the power of 3 because 9*9=81 and 81*9=729. So, 729 = 9³. Therefore, the square root of 1/729 can be written as the square root of 1 over 9³.\n\nI remember that when taking a root of a root, you can multiply the exponents. So, the square root is the same as raising to the 1/2 power. Therefore, √(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2). But since 729 is 9³, this becomes (1/(9³))^(1/2).\n\nNow, applying the exponent: 1/2 multiplied by the exponent on the denominator. So, (9³)^(1/2) is 9^(3*(1/2)) which is 9^(3/2). Therefore, 1/(9^(3/2)) is the same as 1/(9*sqrt(9)). Since sqrt(9) is 3, this simplifies to 1/(9*3) = 1/27.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I did that too quickly. Let me double-check. So, √(1/729) is √(1)/√(729) which is 1/27 because 27 squared is 729. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo, moving one layer out, the next part is the cube root of that result. So, we have the cube root of 1/27. Again, 27 is 3³, so cube root of 1/27 is (1/27)^(1/3). Since 27^(1/3) is 3, this becomes 1/3.\n\nWait, again, that seems straightforward. So, after taking the cube root, we get 1/3.\n\nNow, the outermost operation is the square root of 1/3. So, let's compute that. The square root of 1/3 is (1/3)^(1/2). I know that (1/3"

            "output": ")^(1/2) is equal to 1 divided by the square root of 3. But the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator. So, I need to rationalize the denominator here.\n\nTo rationalize 1/√3, I can multiply numerator and denominator by √3. That gives (√3)/(√3 * √3) = √3 / 3. So, the square root of 1/3 is √3 over 3.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to √3 / 3. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\nStarting over:\n\nOriginal expression: sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nFirst step: sqrt(1/729). Since 729 is 9^3, sqrt(1/729) = 1/27 because sqrt(9^3) = 9^(3/2) = 9^(1.5) = 9*3 = 27. So yes, 1/27.\n\nSecond step: cube_root(1/27). Since 27 is 3^3, cube root of 1/27 is 1/3.\n\nThird step: sqrt(1/3). Which is √(1)/√3 = 1/√3. Rationalizing gives √3/3.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using exponents with fractional powers all the way through to see if I get the same result.\n\nLet me try that method. Let's express each root as an exponent:\n\nThe original expression is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nExpressed in exponents:\n\nFirst, sqrt(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2)\n\nThen, the cube root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6)\n\nThen, the outer sqrt is [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12)\n\nWait, hold on, that"

            "output": " might complicate things more, but let's see. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to keep exponents as products.\n\nSo, let me think in terms of exponents.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nsqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2) = 1/(729)^(1/2) = 1/(9^(3*1/2)) = 1/(9^(3/2)) = 1/(sqrt(9^3)) = 1/27.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nThen, cube root of 1/27 is (1/27)^(1/3) = 1/(27^(1/3)) = 1/3.\n\nThen, sqrt(1/3) = (1/3)^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express 729 as 3^6 since 3^6 = 729. So 729 = 3^6. Then let's re-express each sqrt as exponents.\n\nSo, sqrt(1/729) is sqrt(1/3^6) = (1/3^6)^(1/2) = 1/3^(6*(1/2)) = 1/3^3 = 1/27.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCube root of 1/27 is cube_root(1/3^3) = (1/3^3)^(1/3) = 1/3^(3*(1/3)) = 1/3^1 = 1/3.\n\nThen, sqrt(1/3) = (1/3)^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of all operations as exponents on 3.\n\nSince 729 is 3^6, 27 is 3^3, 9 is 3^2.\n\nSo, starting from inside: sqrt(1/729) = 1/(729)^(1/2) = 1/(3^6)^(1/2) = 1/3^(6*(1/2)) = 1/3^3 = 1/27.\n\nThen, cube root of 1/27 is (1/27)^(1/"

Therefore, the simplified form with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to combine the exponents from the start. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nExpressed as exponents:\n\nsqrt is exponent 1/2, cube root is exponent 1/3, sqrt is exponent 1/2.\n\nSo, starting with (1/729)^(1/2) inside the cube root, then that result is raised to 1/3, then the whole thing is raised to 1/2.\n\nSo, combining exponents:\n\nTotal exponent on 1/729 is (1/2) * (1/3) * (1/2) ?\n\nWait, no, let me think again. Let me parse the order of operations.\n\nThe expression is sqrt( cube_root( sqrt(1/729) ) )\n\nSo, starting with sqrt(1/729) = (1/729)^{1/2}\n\nThen, cube_root of that is [(1/729)^{1/2}]^{1/3} = (1/729)^{ (1/2)*(1/3) } = (1/729)^{1/6}\n\nThen, the outer sqrt is [ (1/729)^{1/6} ]^{1/2} = (1/729)^{ (1/6)*(1/2) } = (1/729)^{1/12}\n\nHmm, so the total exponent is 1/12.

Start with the innermost radical: √(1/729).\n2. Recognize that 729 = 9³, so √(1/729) = 1/27.\n3. Take the cube root of 1/27, which is 1/3.\n4.
