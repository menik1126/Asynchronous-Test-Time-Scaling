            "output": "First, I need to determine the robot's speed. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. To find the speed in meters per second, I'll convert the distance to meters and the time to seconds.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the speed using the formula: speed = distance / time. This will give me the robot's speed in meters per second.\n\nThen, I'll use this speed to find the length of the hallway. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway length. By multiplying the speed by the time, I'll obtain the length of the hallway in meters.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer clearly to answer the question accurately.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of the hallway, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the robot's speed.**\n\n   - **Distance:** 1 kilometer = 1000 meters\n   - **Time taken:** 2.5 hours = 2.5 × 60 = 150 minutes = 150 × 60 = 9000 seconds\n\n   Speed = Distance / Time\n   \\[\n   Speed = \\frac{1000 \\text{ meters}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{1}{9} \\text{ meters per second}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the length of the hallway using the calculated speed.**\n\n   - **Time taken:** 90 seconds\n\n   Length = Speed × Time\n   \\[\n   Length = \\frac{1}{9} \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ seconds} = 10 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The hallway is \\boxed{10} meters long."
