It's given that it has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs because the coefficients of the polynomial are real, right? So, the roots are \\( r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\) and so on up to \\( r_5, \\overline{r}_5 \\).\n\nThe question is asking for the value of the sum \\( \\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r_5}} \\). Hmm, each term is the reciprocal of the product of a root and its conjugate. I remember that for any complex number \\( r \\), \\( r \\overline{r} = |r|^2 \\), which is a real number. So \\( \\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}} \\) is the reciprocal of the square of the modulus of \\( r \\).\n\nWait, maybe there's another way to think about this. If I consider each pair \\( r_k \\) and \\( \\overline{r}_k \\), their product is \\( |r_k|^2 \\), which is real and non-negative. So, each term \\( \\frac{1}{r_k \\overline{r}_k} \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{|r_k|^2} \\). Therefore, the sum is just the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the moduli of each pair.\n\nBut how does this help me? Maybe I can relate this to the polynomial equation. Since \\( x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0 \\), we can factor this as \\( (x + (13x - 1))(x^9 - x^8(13x - 1) + x^7(13x - 1)^2 - \\dots + (13x - 1)^9) ) = 0 \\). Wait, but that might not be useful.

Given that, maybe I can find a relationship for the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{r_k \\overline{r}_k} \\) by considering some transformation or substitution.\n\nLet me think. Since \\( r_k \\) is a root, plugging it into the equation gives \\( r_k^{10} + (13 r_k - 1)^{10} = 0 \\). So \\( r_k^{10} = - (13 r_k - 1)^{10} \\). Taking the modulus on both sides, \\( |r_k|^{10} = |13 r_k - 1|^{10} \\). Therefore, \\( |r_k| = |13 r_k - 1| \\). Interesting, because modulus is real, so this gives an equation relating \\( r_k \\).\n\nWait, if \\( |r_k| = |13 r_k - 1| \\), then perhaps we can square both sides to get rid of the modulus and get an equation in terms of \\( r_k \\). So, let me square both sides:\n\n\\( |r_k|^2 = |13 r_k - 1|^2 \\)\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, it's \\( (13 r_k - 1)(13 \\overline{r}_k - 1) \\) because \\( |a + b|^2 = (a + b)(\\overline{a} + \\overline{b}) \\).
