It's given that it has 10 complex roots, which come in conjugate pairs, like \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The problem asks me to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nHmm, first, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real number. Also, since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each pair contributes the same term to the sum. So, I can think of the sum as 5 times the same term, right? Let me see.\n\nSo, if I let \\(S = \\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\), then \\(S = \\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{r_k\\overline{r}_k}\\).\n\nSince each \\(r_k\\) is a root of the equation, and \\(\\overline{r}_k\\) is its conjugate, maybe I can find an expression for \\(|r_k|^2\\) and then work from there.\n\nThe equation given is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Let me rewrite this as \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, but wait, complex numbers have multiple roots, so maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can factor out \\(x^{10}\\), but not sure.

Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me check: \\(\\left(\\frac{13x - 1}{x}\\right) = 13 - \\frac{1}{x}\\), so yes, that step is correct. So, \\(\\left(13 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{10} = -1\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(13 - \\frac{1}{x}\\) is a 10th root of -1. The 10th roots of -1 can be expressed as \\(e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 9\\). So, \\(13 - \\frac{1}{x}\\) equals each of these roots.\n\nSo, for each \\(k\\), \\(13 - \\frac{1}{x} = e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\). Let me denote \\(\\omega = e^{i\\pi/10}\\), so then \\(13 - \\frac{1}{x} = \\omega^{2k + 1}\\).\n\nWait, maybe I can solve for \\(x\\).

Recall that T is the sum over all 10 roots of y of |y_k|^2, which is equal to sum_{k=1}^{10} |y_k|^2 =1700.\n\nBut since S is the sum over the distinct roots (r1, conjugate(r1), etc.), which is 5 terms, each 1/|r_k|^2. So, since T=1700 is the sum over all 10 roots, which would be 2S (because each term in S is counted twice in T, once for r_k and once for \\overline{r}_k), so S = T /2 =1700 /2 = 850.\n\nWait, no, that depends on whether each term is present once or twice. If each conjugate pair contributes 1/|r_k|^2 +1/|\\overline{r_k}|^2 = 2/|r_k|^2 to T, then T = 2S.\n\nThus, T =2S, so S = T/2=1700/2=850.\n\nWait, but wait, no, that would be the case if we sum over all 10 roots, each contribution 1/|x|^2, so T = sum_{all roots} 1/|x|^2 = 2S, since each conjugate pair contributes 2 terms of 1/|x|^2.\n\nBut then, S would be the sum over the 5 distinct terms (e.g., r1, r2, r3, r4, r5) of 1/|x_k|^2 each, so T=2S, so S = T/2=850.\n\nBut let me confirm this reasoning.\n\nEach conjugate pair contributes two terms to T, each being 1/|x|^2, so T = sum_{k=1}^{10} 1/|x_k|^2 =2 sum_{k=1}^{5} 1/|x_k|^2=2S.\n\nThus, S = T/2=1700/2=850.\n\nTherefore, the value of the sum is 850.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{850}\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\), which has 10 complex roots \\(r_1, \\"
