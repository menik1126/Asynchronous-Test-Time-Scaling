Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. The condition is xyz(x + y + z) = 1. And I need to minimize the product (x + y)(y + z). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it or use some inequality to find the minimum.\n\nI remember that inequalities like AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) often help in these types of optimization problems. Maybe I can apply AM-GM here somehow. Let me think about how to relate the given condition to the expression I need to minimize.\n\nThe expression (x + y)(y + z) can be expanded to y(x + y + z) + xz. Wait, that might not be helpful immediately. Alternatively, maybe I can express (x + y)(y + z) in terms that relate to the condition.\n\nLet me denote S = x + y + z, so S is the sum of the variables. Then, (x + y) = S - z and (y + z) = S - x. So, (x + y)(y + z) = (S - z)(S - x). Hmm, that might be a useful substitution.\n\nBut I also have the condition xyzS = 1. Hmm, so I can perhaps express xyz in terms of S. Let me write that down: xyz = 1/S. Since S is positive because x, y, z are positive.\n\nNow, I'm trying to minimize (S - z)(S - x). Let me see if I can express (S - z)(S - x) in terms that can be bounded by something related to xyz or S.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use substitution variables. Let me try to set a = x, b = y, c = z, just to make the notation cleaner. So, the condition becomes ab c (a + b + c) = 1. And I need to minimize (a + b)(b + c).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use symmetry or assume some variables are equal. Since the problem is symmetric with respect to x and"

Hmm, so maybe the minimum occurs when x = z? Let me see if that's a valid assumption.\n\nSuppose that x = z. Then, let me set x = z = a, so then the variables are a, y, a. Then the condition becomes a * y * a (a + y + a) = a² y (2a + y) = 1. The expression to minimize becomes (a + y)(y + a) = (a + y)^2. Wait, that's interesting. So if x = z, then (x + y)(y + z) becomes (a + y)^2. So, in this case, we can write the problem as minimizing (a + y)^2 given that a² y (2a + y) = 1.\n\nHmm, maybe this is a simpler problem. Let me try to work with that. Let me denote t = a + y. Then, perhaps express variables in terms of t? Not sure yet. Alternatively, let me set variables such that I can apply AM-GM here.\n\nLet me see, the condition is a² y (2a + y) = 1. Let me denote variables as follows: Let me set u = a, so then the equation is u² y (2u + y) = 1. Let me see if I can set variables such that terms can be grouped for AM-GM.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables so that 2a + y is something. Let me think. Let me try to set variables such that 2a = y. Let me see if that would work. Suppose 2a = y. Then, substituting into the condition:\n\na² * (2a) * (2a + 2a) = a² * 2a * 4a = 8a^4 = 1.

I'm not sure if this approach is correct. Maybe I made the assumption that 2a = y to simplify the problem, but perhaps the minimal occurs elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is too hasty. Let me try a different method. Let's try to use Lagrange multipliers since it's an optimization problem with a constraint.\n\nSo, the function to minimize is f(x, y, z) = (x + y)(y + z). The constraint is g(x, y, z) = xyz(x + y + z) - 1 = 0.

This simplifies the problem due to symmetry.\n\n3. **Substitute Variables**:\n   - Let \\(S = x + y + z = 2a + b\\).\n   - The constraint becomes \\(a^2 b (2a + b) = 1\\).\n\n4. **Expand and Simplify**:\n   - The expression to minimize becomes \\((a + b)^2\\).\n\n5. **Solve for Variables**:\n   - Using the method of Lagrange multipliers and symmetry, we find that \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt{2} - 1\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(x = z = 1\\) and \\(y = \\sqrt{2} - 1\\) into the constraint and verify it holds true.\n   - Compute \\((x + y)(y + z) = (1 + (\\sqrt{2} - 1))( (\\sqrt{2} - 1) + 1) = (\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{2}) = 2\\).\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
