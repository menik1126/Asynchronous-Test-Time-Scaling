Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given and what I need to find. The condition is xyz times (x + y + z) equals 1, and I need to minimize the product of (x + y) and (y + z). So, the goal is to find the smallest possible value of (x + y)(y + z) given that constraint.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use some inequality here. I remember that inequalities like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz are often useful in optimization problems with constraints. Let me think about which one might apply here.\n\nLooking at the expression (x + y)(y + z), maybe expanding it could give me some insight. Let me try that:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = x y + x z + y^2 + y z.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps immediately. Maybe I can relate this to the given condition, which is xyz(x + y + z) = 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others using the given condition. Maybe introducing substitutions will help. Let me try setting some variables to simplify the problem.\n\nAlternatively, since all variables are symmetric in the constraint, maybe setting some variables equal could help. Let me assume that x = z; is that a valid assumption? I think so because the problem is symmetric in x and z. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let me suppose that x = z. Then, the condition becomes x * y * x * (x + y + x) = 1, which simplifies to x^2 y * (2x + y) = 1.\n\nOkay, and the expression to minimize becomes (x + y)(y + x) because z = x, so it's (x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)^2.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to minimizing (x + y)^2 given that x^2 y (2x + y) = 1.\n\nHmm, that seems simpler. Let me denote t = x + y. Then, maybe I can express everything in terms of t.\n\nBut"

Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe take logarithms to make the equation multiplicative into additive. Not sure yet. Alternatively, set another substitution. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use AM-GM inequality here. Let me consider the constraint equation x^2 y (2x + y) = 1. Maybe I can apply AM-GM on the terms here.\n\nWait, in the expression x^2 y (2x + y), if I can split that into terms such that when applying AM-GM, the product becomes 1, and then relate to (x + y)^2. Not sure yet. Let me try.\n\nLet me see the terms in x^2 y (2x + y). Let me consider variables a = x, b = x, c = y, d = 2x + y. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe decompose the expression into variables that can be handled with AM-GM.\n\nAlternatively, let's let\u2019s see if we can denote variables as follows:\n\nLet me set variables u = x, v = y, so the constraint is u^2 v (2u + v) =1. And the expression to minimize is (u + v)^2. So need to minimize (u + v)^2 subject to u^2 v (2u + v) =1.\n\nMaybe set variables to have some proportionality. Let me suppose that 2u + v is proportional to something. Let me think in terms of variables. Let me see if I can set variables so that the terms in the product are in geometric progression? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use Lagrange multipliers. Since it's an optimization problem with constraint, that might be a path. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote the function to minimize as f(x, y, z) = (x + y)(y + z), and the constraint is g(x, y, z) = xyz(x + y + z) - 1 = 0.\n\nThen, according to Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of f and g should be proportional. So, \u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g. Let's compute the partial derivatives.\n\nFirst, compute \u2207f. Let's compute partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z.\n\nFirst, f = (x"
