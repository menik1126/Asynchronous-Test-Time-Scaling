            "output": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we're given a quadratic polynomial P(x) that satisfies two inequalities for all real numbers x: x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3. Also, we know that P(11) = 181. We need to find P(16).\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, let me write it in the general form. Quadratic polynomials have the form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real coefficients.\n\nNow, the problem says that P(x) is bounded between two other quadratics: x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3. So, for every real number x, P(x) is at least x² - 2x + 2 and at most 2x² - 4x + 3.\n\nLet me write that as inequalities:\n1. P(x) ≥ x² - 2x + 2\n2. P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nSince both of these have to be true for all real x, the difference between P(x) and each of these quadratics must also satisfy certain conditions.\n\nLet me subtract the first inequality from P(x). So, P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0. Let's compute that:\nP(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (a x² + b x + c) - x² + 2x - 2\n= (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\n\nSince this is greater than or equal to zero for all real x, the quadratic expression (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) must be non-negative for all x. That means the quadratic must be a perfect square or always positive, which implies that the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero.\n\nSimilarly, subtract the second inequality from P(x):\nP(x) - (2x² - 4x + 3) ≤ 0\n= (a x² + b x + c) - 2x² + 4x - 3\n"

            "output": "= (a - 2)x² + (b + 4)x + (c - 3)\n\nSince this is less than or equal to zero for all real x, the quadratic (a - 2)x² + (b + 4)x + (c - 3) must be a non-positive quadratic, which again implies that it's a perfect square (if a - 2 is positive, it can't be always non-positive) or always negative. So, the discriminant must be less than or equal to zero, and the leading coefficient must be negative or zero.\n\nWait, if the leading coefficient is a - 2, then for the quadratic to be non-positive for all x, we need two things: the leading coefficient must be ≤ 0, so a - 2 ≤ 0 => a ≤ 2.\n\nAlso, the discriminant must be ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the first inequality, P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) ≥ 0 for all x, so the leading coefficient (a - 1) must be ≥ 0 because if a - 1 is positive, the quadratic will go to infinity as x grows, which is okay, but if a - 1 is negative, the quadratic might go to negative infinity, which isn't allowed because P(x) can't be less than x² - 2x + 2 for all x. Therefore, a - 1 ≥ 0 => a ≥ 1.\n\nSo, combining these from both inequalities, a must be ≥ 1 and ≤ 2. So, a is between 1 and 2, inclusive.\n\nNow, let me note down the two conditions:\n\n1. (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x, which requires:\n   - Leading coefficient (a - 1) ≥ 0 (so a ≥ 1)\n   - Discriminant D1 ≤ 0\n   Where D1 = (b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0\n\n2. (a - 2)x² + (b + 4)x + (c - 3) ≤ 0 for all x, which requires:\n   - Leading coefficient (a - 2) ≤ 0 (so a ≤ 2)\n   - Discriminant"

Since we have two inequalities, maybe we can find specific a, b, c that satisfy both inequalities and P(11) = 181.\n\nWait, but quadratic polynomials are determined by three coefficients, so we have three variables a, b, c. But the problem gives us only one equation so far, equation (1). So we need more equations or find a way to express the inequalities in terms that can be combined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(x) is the average of the two bounding quadratics, or maybe touches both quadratics at some point. But let me think.\n\nWait, since P(x) is between the two given quadratics for all x, maybe the difference between them can be expressed as a linear function or something. Let me see.\n\nLet me subtract the lower bound from the upper bound: [2x² - 4x + 3] - [x² - 2x + 2] = x² - 2x + 1.\n\nSo, the upper bound minus the lower bound is x² - 2x + 1, which factors as (x - 1)^2. So, the difference between the upper and lower bounds is a perfect square, (x - 1)^2.\n\nHmm, that's"

Therefore, the difference between the upper and lower bounds is always non-negative, which makes sense because the upper bound is always above the lower bound.\n\nTherefore, P(x) must lie between these two quadratics, so the difference between P(x) and the lower bound must be between 0 and (x - 1)^2. So, P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) is between 0 and (x - 1)^2.\n\nWait, but actually, the upper bound minus the lower bound is (x - 1)^2, so P(x) can be written as the lower bound plus some multiple of (x - 1)^2, but such that the multiple is between 0 and 1. But since the inequalities are for all x, maybe the difference is exactly a multiple of (x - 1)^2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P(x) is equal to the lower bound plus k*(x - 1)^2, where k is between 0 and 1. But since the upper bound is exactly the lower bound plus (x - 1)^2, then if k is between 0 and 1, then P(x) would be between the two. However, since the inequalities are for all x, maybe the difference is exactly a constant multiple of (x - 1)^2?\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the difference would be a quadratic, so maybe P(x) is exactly the lower bound plus some multiple of (x - 1)^2. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that P(x) = (x² - 2x + 2) + k*(x - 1)^2, where 0 ≤ k ≤ 1. Then, since (x - 1)^2 is non-negative, this would ensure that P(x) ≥ x² - 2x + 2. Also, if k ≤ 1, then P(x) ≤ (x² - 2x + 2) + (x - 1)^2 = 2x² - 4x + 3, which is exactly the upper bound. So, this would satisfy the inequalities for any k between 0 and 1.
