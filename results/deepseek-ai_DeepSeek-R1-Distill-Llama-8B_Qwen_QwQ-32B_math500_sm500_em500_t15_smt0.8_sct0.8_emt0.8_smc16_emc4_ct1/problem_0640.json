            "output": "Okay, so I need to find P(16) where P(x) is a quadratic polynomial. The problem gives me two inequalities that P(x) must satisfy for all real numbers x. It also tells me that P(11) = 181. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that a quadratic polynomial has the general form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. The problem gives me two inequalities: x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3. So, P(x) is sandwiched between these two quadratics for all x.\n\nMaybe I can express P(x) in terms of these two quadratics. Let me denote the lower bound as Q(x) = x² - 2x + 2 and the upper bound as R(x) = 2x² - 4x + 3. So, we have Q(x) ≤ P(x) ≤ R(x) for all x.\n\nSince both Q and R are quadratics, and P is also a quadratic, their difference might help. Let me compute R(x) - Q(x) to see what that gives me.\n\nR(x) - Q(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - (x² - 2x + 2) = x² - 2x + 1. Oh, that simplifies to (x - 1)². So, R(x) - Q(x) = (x - 1)², which is always non-negative because it's a square.\n\nThis tells me that P(x) is squeezed between Q(x) and R(x), and the difference between R and Q is (x - 1)². So, maybe P(x) can be expressed as Q(x) + k(x - 1)², where k is some constant. Alternatively, since R(x) is Q(x) + (x - 1)², maybe P(x) is Q(x) plus some multiple of (x - 1)².\n\nWait, let me think again. If R(x) = Q(x) + (x - 1)², then perhaps P(x) can be written as Q(x) + k(x - 1)², where k is a constant between 0 and "

Then, plug in x = 11, since we know P(11) = 181.\n\nCompute Q(11) first. Q(11) = 11² - 2*11 + 2 = 121 - 22 + 2 = 101. Then, (11 - 1)² = 10² = 100. So, P(11) = Q(11) + k*(100) = 101 + 100k. But P(11) is given as 181, so:\n\n101 + 100k = 181\n100k = 80\nk = 0.8\n\nHmm, 0.8 is between 0 and 1, so that works. So, now, P(x) = Q(x) + 0.8*(x - 1)².\n\nAlternatively, expanding P(x):\n\nP(x) = (x² - 2x + 2) + 0.8*(x² - 2x + 1)\n= x² - 2x + 2 + 0.8x² - 1.6x + 0.8\nCombine like terms:\n\nx² + 0.8x² = 1.8x²\n-2x -1.6x = -3.6x\n2 + 0.8 = 2.8\n\nSo, P(x) = 1.8x² - 3.6x + 2.8\n\nWait, let me check if this makes sense with the upper bound R(x). R(x) is 2x² -4x +3.\n\nSo, 1.8x² -3.6x +2.8 compared to 2x² -4x +3.\n\nLet me compute R(x) - P(x):\n\n(2x² -4x +3) - (1.8x² -3.6x +2.8) = 0.2x² + 0.6x +0.2\n\nIs 0.2x² +0.6x +0.2 always non-negative?

So, R(x) - P(x) is sometimes negative. That can't be because P(x) ≤ R(x) for all x.\n\nHmm, so my initial approach may be wrong. Maybe P(x) can't be expressed as Q(x) + k(x-1)². Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me go back. Maybe instead of R(x) - Q(x) being (x -1)^2, perhaps P(x) can be written as Q(x) + k(x -1)^2, but k can be any constant such that P(x) is between Q and R.\n\nBut when I plug in k=0.8, which gives P(x) = 1.8x² -3.6x +2.8, then R(x) - P(x) is 0.2x² +0.6x +0.2, which is positive for x large enough, but negative for some x.\n\nWait, but actually, R(x) - P(x) is equal to (x -1)^2*(2 -1.8) + ... Hmm, maybe an alternative approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that since P(x) is between Q(x) and R(x), then for any x, the difference R(x) - Q(x) = (x - 1)^2, so P(x) must be Q(x) + t(x)*(x -1)^2, where t(x) is between 0 and 1 for all x. But since P(x) is a quadratic, t(x) must be a constant, right? Because if t(x) varies with x, then P(x) would not be quadratic.\n\nYes, so t(x) must be a constant k, so 0 ≤ k ≤ 1. So P(x) = Q(x) + k(x -1)^2.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried that, I found k=0.8, but that made R(x) - P(x) negative for some x, which shouldn't happen because P"

Let me check again:\n\n-4x minus (-3.6x) is -4x +3.6x = -0.4x, right. And 3 -2.8 is 0.2. So the difference is 0.2x² -0.4x +0.2.\n\nNow, let's see if this quadratic is always non-negative. Let's compute its discriminant:\n\nDiscriminant D = (-0.4)^2 -4*(0.2)*(0.2) = 0.16 - 0.16 = 0.\n\nSo discriminant is zero, so it's a perfect square. So 0.2x² -0.4x +0.2 = 0.2(x² -2x +1) = 0.2(x -1)^2, which is always non-negative. So that's okay. So R(x) - P(x) is 0.2(x -1)^2, which is non-negative, so that's okay. So my mistake earlier was in the coefficients. So actually, this works.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = Q(x) +0.8*(x -1)^2 is valid, and"

So 101 +80=181, which matches P(11)=181.\n\nSo my expression for P(x) seems correct.\n\nNow, we need to find P(16).
