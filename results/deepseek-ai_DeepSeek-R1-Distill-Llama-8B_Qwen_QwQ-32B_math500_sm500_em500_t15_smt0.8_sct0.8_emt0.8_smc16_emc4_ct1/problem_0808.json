The roots of this polynomial are distinct integers, and I know that \\( a_n = 2 \\) and \\( a_0 = 66 \\). The goal is to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a polynomial with integer coefficients and integer roots, the polynomial can be factored as a product of linear factors corresponding to its roots. Since all roots are distinct integers, let me denote them as \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k \\), where each \\( r_i \\) is an integer. The polynomial can then be written as:\n\n\\[ f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_k) \\]\n\nHere, \\( 2 \\) is the leading coefficient \\( a_n \\). The constant term \\( a_0 \\) is equal to \\( 2 \\times (-1)^k r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_k \\). Given that \\( a_0 = 66 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times (-1)^k r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_k = 66 \\]\n\\[ (-1)^k r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_k = 33 \\]\n\nSo, the product of the roots multiplied by \\( (-1)^k \\) equals 33. Since 33 factors into primes as \\( 3 \\times 11 \\), I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, depending on the value of \\( k \\). But since \\( k \\) is the number of roots, it must be at least 1.\n\nI need to find such a set of integers with the smallest possible absolute value of the coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\). The coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) is related to the sum of the products of the roots taken \\( k-1 \\) at a time, multiplied by \\( (-1) \\). Wait, actually, let me think more carefully.\n\nIn general, for a polynomial:\n\n\\[ f(x) = a"

Since \\( a_n = 2 \\), then:\n\n\\[ a_{n-1} = -2 \\times (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_k) \\]\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me correct that. For a monic polynomial, the coefficient of \\( x^{k-1} \\) is \\( - \\) the sum of the roots. But in our case, the leading coefficient is 2. So, f(x) is:\n\n\\[ f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_k) \\]\n\nSo when expanded, the coefficient of \\( x^{k-1} \\) is \\( 2 \\times (-1) \\times \\) (sum of the roots). So, yes:\n\n\\[ a_{n-1} = -2 \\times (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_k) \\]\n\nTherefore, to minimize \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33 (depending on the number of roots), and whose sum has the smallest possible absolute value.\n\nSo, the first step is to factor 33 into distinct integers. Since 33 is 3 × 11, but we need to write it as a product of distinct integers. However, 33 can't be factored further into smaller integers beyond 1, 3, 11, 33. So, the possible factorizations are:\n\n1. 1 × 3 ×"

Since 33 is positive, both roots positive or both negative. So, possible pairs: (1, 33), (3, 11). Their negatives: (-1, -33), (-3, -11).
