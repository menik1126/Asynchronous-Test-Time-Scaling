All the coefficients a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_0 are integers, and all the roots of this polynomial are distinct integers. My goal is to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. \n\nFirst, I recall that since the polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, it must be a product of linear factors with integer roots. So, I can express f(x) as 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), where each r_i is an integer.\n\nGiven that a_n = 2, this means the leading coefficient is 2, not 1. So the polynomial doesn't factor as x times something, but rather 2 times the product of (x - r_i) terms. That's important because it affects how the roots relate to the coefficients.\n\nAlso, the constant term a_0 is 66. Since the polynomial is monic except for the leading coefficient 2, the constant term is 2 times the product of the roots times (-1)^n. So, 66 = 2 * (-1)^n * r_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n. Therefore, 66 must be equal to 2 times the product of the roots times (-1)^n. \n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\n66 = 2 * (-1)^n * r_1 r_2 ... r_n\n\nSimplifying, 33 = (-1)^n * r_1 r_2 ... r_n\n\nSo, the product of the roots times (-1)^n is 33. Since 33 factors into 1*3*11 or similar, the roots must be factors of 33. But considering that they are integers, the possible roots could be \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b111, \u00b133, but also combinations of these.\n\nBut wait, 33 can also be written as 3*11, or maybe with negative numbers. So, the product of the roots (with a sign depending on n) is 33.\n\nNow, the key here is that all roots are distinct integers. So, we need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, depending"

Since the product is 33 or -33, and the roots are integers, we need to find all possible factorizations of 33 into distinct integers, then see which one gives the minimal |a_{n-1}|.\n\nBut first, let's note that the coefficient a_{n-1} is related to the sum of the roots. Wait, actually, in the expansion of the polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is -2*(sum of roots) if n is even? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the polynomial is 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n). Let me expand this. The expansion would be 2 times the product of (x - r_i). The coefficient of x^{n-1} in the product (x - r_1)...(x - r_n) is - (r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n). Therefore, when multiplied by 2, the coefficient a_{n-1} is 2*(- (sum of roots)). So, a_{n-1} = -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. \n\nWait, so actually, the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to -2 times the sum of the roots. Therefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Since the roots are integers, distinct, and their product (times (-1)^n) is 33, we need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33 (depending on n's parity) and whose sum has the smallest possible absolute value.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers whose product is \u00b133, and the sum of which has the smallest absolute value. Then, the minimal |a_{n-1}| would be twice that minimal |sum|.\n\nSo, first, let's consider the possible factorizations of 33 into distinct integers. Since 33 is positive, the product can be positive or negative, so we can have an even or odd number of negative factors. But since the roots are distinct integers, we need to list all possible combinations of distinct integers whose product is 33 or"

Alternatively, 33 can be written as (-1)*(-3)*11, which is three factors as well. But I need to consider all possible factorizations into distinct integers, which may include more than three factors.\n\nWait, but 33 is 3*11, so maybe there are other ways to factor it. For example, using 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, 33, -33.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal sum occurs with the least number of terms, so probably trying to use the smallest number of roots, i.e., as few roots as possible, because more roots would likely lead to a larger sum in absolute value.\n\nBut let me try both approaches.\n\nFirst, let me consider the minimal number of roots.

But in either case, the sum is determined by the roots.\n\nBut in the previous case, we had three roots: 1, -3, -11, which gave a sum of -13, leading to |a_{n-1}| = 26.\n\nIs there a set of roots where the sum is smaller in absolute value?\n\nWait, let's see, for four roots: perhaps 1, -1, 3, -11. Let's compute the product: 1*(-1)*3*(-11) = 33. The sum is 1 + (-1) + 3 + (-11) = -8. So sum is -8, absolute value 8, leading to |a_{n-1}| = 16.

Wait, no, because the coefficients are integers, but that doesn't imply the roots have to be factors of a_0. Wait, hold on. Actually, in a monic polynomial, the constant term is the product of the roots times (-1)^n, but when the leading coefficient is not 1, like in this case, it's 2, the constant term is 2 times that product. So, in this case, 66 = 2 * (product of roots) * (-1)^n. So, the product of roots is 33 or -33, but the roots don't necessarily have to be the factors of 33 because of the 2 in front.

Not better.\n\nThree roots: -1, -3, -11. Sum is -15. Not better.\n\nThree roots: 1, -3, -11. Sum is -13. So, |sum| is 13, leading to 26. Worse than 16.\n\nThree roots: -1, 3, 11. Sum is 13. So, same.\n\nHmm, so maybe four roots are better. Let me see if there's a four-root combination with a smaller sum.\n\nWait, let's try 1, -1, 3, -11. The product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11) = 33.
