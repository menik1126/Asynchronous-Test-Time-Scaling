            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\). Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this. I remember from algebra that when dividing one polynomial by another, we can use polynomial long division. Alternatively, maybe the Remainder Theorem could be useful here. Wait, let me recall what the Remainder Theorem states. It says that if a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) is divided by \\( x - a \\), the remainder is \\( f(a) \\). But in this case, the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), which is \\( x - (-1) \\), so maybe I can use that.\n\nLet me try applying the Remainder Theorem first to check what the remainder is when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\). If I substitute \\( a = -1 \\) into the polynomial, I should get the remainder. So, plugging in, we have:\n\n\\( f(-1) = (-1)^6 - 3 \\). Since \\( (-1)^6 \\) is 1 (because any even power of -1 is 1), this simplifies to \\( 1 - 3 = -2 \\). So, the remainder is -2. But the problem asks for the quotient, not the remainder. Hmm, so maybe the Remainder Theorem alone isn't enough here. I think I need to do polynomial division to find the actual quotient.\n\nAlright, let's set up the polynomial long division then. I need to divide \\( x^6 - 3 \\) by \\( x + 1 \\). Let me write that out. So, the dividend is \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\) because all the middle terms are missing, which could make it easier.\n\nThe divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), so I'll write that as \\( x + 1 \\) with a coefficient of 1 on \\( x \\) and 1 on the constant term. Now, I need to find how many times \\( x \\) goes into each term of the dividend starting from the highest degree.\n\nStarting with \\( x^6 ÷ x \\), which is \\( x^"

Subtract that from the original dividend:\n\n\\( (x^6 + 0x^5 + ...) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 + 0x^4 + ... \\). \n\nWait, let me write that step by step. \n\nFirst term: \\( x^6 ÷ x = x^5 \\). Multiply divisor by \\( x^5 \\): \\( x^5*(x +1) = x^6 + x^5 \\). Subtract this from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^6 - 3) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 - 3 \\). But actually, since the original dividend has all the intermediate terms as zero, maybe I should track each term properly.

Multiply divisor by -1: \\( -x -1 \\).\n\nSubtract: \\( (-x -3) - (-x -1) = (-x -3) +x +1 = (-3 +1) = -2 \\).\n\nSo, the remainder is -2, which matches what I found earlier with the Remainder Theorem. That gives me confidence that I didn't make a mistake. Now, what's the quotient? The quotient is all the terms we multiplied by the divisor, which are \\( x^5, -x^4, x^3, -x^2, x, -1 \\), so putting that together:\n\nQuotient: \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 -x^2 + x -1 \\).\n\nSo, the quotient when \\( x^6 -3 \\) is divided by \\( x +1 \\) is \\( x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1 \\), and the remainder is -2. But the question specifically asks for the quotient, so the answer should be \\( x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1 \\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any subtraction errors in the division steps. It's easy to make a sign mistake when subtracting negatives.\n\nLooking back at step 2: When"

Then, in step 3, after subtracting, I get \\( x^4 +0x^3 \\), then next term is \\( x^3 \\). Hmm, maybe I miscalculated somewhere. Let me try an alternative approach using synthetic division, which might be faster.\n\nSynthetic division is another method to find the quotient and remainder when dividing by a linear polynomial. Since \\( x +1 \\) can be written as \\( x - (-1) \\), we can use \\( a = -1 \\).\n\nThe synthetic division setup for \\( x^6 -3 \\) is a bit more involved because the polynomial is of degree 6, so we need to include all the missing terms as coefficients. So, writing out the coefficients: 1 (for \\( x^6 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^5 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^4 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^3 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^2 \\)), 0 (for \\( x \\)), 0 (constant term), but wait, our polynomial is \\( x^6 -3 \\), which can be written as \\( x^6 +0x^5 +0x^4 +0x^3 +0x^2 +0x -3 \\). So, the coefficients are 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nSetting up synthetic division with root \\( a = -1 \\):\n\nBring down the leading coefficient: 1.\n\nMultiply by -1: 1*(-1) = -1.

Add to last coefficient: -3 +1= -2.\n\nSo the coefficients of the quotient are the numbers we got except the last one (which is the remainder). The coefficients are 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, and the remainder is -2. Since the original polynomial is degree 6, dividing by degree 1 gives a quotient of degree 5, so the coefficients correspond to \\( x^5 \\), \\( -x^4 \\), \\( x^3 \\), \\( -x^2 \\), \\( x \\), \\( -1 \\). So the quotient is indeed \\( x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1 \\), which matches what I got with polynomial long division. \n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the quotient is correct. The remainder is -2, but the question only asks for the quotient, so the answer is that polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this. For instance, if I let \\( x^6 -3 = (x +1)(Q(x)) + R \\), where Q(x) is the quotient and R is the remainder. Since the divisor is linear, the remainder is a constant. We already found R = -2. So, if I can express \\( x^6 -3 \\) as \\( (x +1)Q(x) -2 \\), then Q(x) would be \\( (x^6 -3 +2)/(x +1) \\), but that might not help directly. However, since we already did the division and synthetic division, and both methods gave the same result, I think that's solid.\n\nAnother check: Let me plug in x = -1 into the quotient multiplied by (x +1) plus remainder and see if it equals the original polynomial. Let me see:\n\nLet Q(x) = x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1.\n\nThen (x +1)*Q(x) + (-2) should equal x^6 -3.\n\nLet me compute (x +1)*Q(x):\n\nMultiply Q(x) by x: x*(x^5 -x^4 +x^3 -x^2 +x -1) = x^6 -x^5 +"
