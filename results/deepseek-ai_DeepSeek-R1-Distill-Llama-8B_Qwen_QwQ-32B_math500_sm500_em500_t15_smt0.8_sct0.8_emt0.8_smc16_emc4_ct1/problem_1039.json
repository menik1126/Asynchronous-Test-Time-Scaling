Hmm, okay, let's start by looking at the given polynomial: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). It looks a bit intimidating because of the high degree, but maybe I can find a way to factor it.\n\nFirst, I notice that the polynomial is a quartic in terms of \\(x^4\\). So, if I let \\(y = x^4\\), the equation becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). Maybe I can factor this quadratic equation to simplify things. Let me try factoring \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, yes, it factors to \\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\). Replacing back \\(y = x^4\\), we get \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\).\n\nNow, I have \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). Let me check if these factors can be factored further over integers. Starting with \\(x^4 - 1\\), I remember that this is a difference of squares because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and 1 is \\(1^2\\). So, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1)\\). Then, \\(x^2 - 1\\) factors further into \\((x + 1)(x - 1)\\). So now, the factorization is:\n\n\\[\n(x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1)\n\\]\n\nNext, let's look at \\(x^4 + 4\\). I remember that \\(x^4 + 4\\) is also known as a biquadratic or \"sum of squares,\" but it can be"

In our case, y is 1 because we have \\(x^4 + 4 = x^4 + 4*1^4\\). Applying the identity:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x*1 + 2*1^2)(x^2 - 2x*1 + 2*1^2) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\n\\]\n\nSo now, our full factorization is:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1)\n\\]\n\nWait, let me list all the factors:\n\n1. \\(x^2 + 2x + 2\\) (quadratic)\n2. \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) (quadratic)\n3. \\(x + 1\\) (linear)\n4. \\(x - 1\\) (linear)\n5. \\(x^2 + 1\\) (quadratic)\n\nAre any of these factors reducible over integers? Well, the linear factors \\(x + 1\\) and \\(x - 1\\) can't be factored further. The quadratics: Let's check their discriminants. For \\(x^2 + 2x + 2\\), discriminant \\(D = 4 - 8 = -4\\), which is negative, so it's irreducible over reals, hence over integers as well. Similarly, \\(x^2 - 2x + 2\\) has discriminant \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), same situation. \\(x^2 + 1\\) has discriminant \\(-4\\), so also irreducible. So all the factors are irreducible over integers. Great!\n\nSo the complete factorization is:\n\n\\[\n(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^"
