Then, I have to compute the sum of \\(p_i(1)\\) for each polynomial \\(p_i\\).\n\nFirst, I should write down the polynomial: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). Hmm, it looks a bit like a quadratic in terms of \\(x^4\\). Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me try that.\n\nLet \\(y = x^4\\). Then the polynomial becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). Now, I can try factoring this quadratic. To factor \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\), I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Let me think: 4 and -1. Because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, it factors as \\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\).\n\nNow, replacing \\(y\\) back with \\(x^4\\), the polynomial factors into \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). Wait, that seems like progress. So now I have two quartic polynomials: \\(x^4 + 4\\) and \\(x^4 - 1\\). Are these factorable over the integers?\n\nLet's check each one.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\). I recognize this as a difference of squares because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and 1 is \\(1^2\\). So, using the difference of squares formula: \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\). Applying that here:\n\n\\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Now, \\(x^2 - 1\\) is another difference of squares: \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\). So, putting it all together:\n\n\\(x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + "

Hmm, I think this might be a sum of squares. But sum of squares doesn't factor over the reals, right? Wait, but maybe it factors into quadratics with integer coefficients.\n\nI recall that \\(x^4 + 4\\) is a special case called the Sophie Germain identity. Let me try to factor it:\n\n\\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Let me check that by expanding.\n\nMultiply \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\):\n\nFirst term: \\(x^2 * x^2 = x^4\\).\nOuter terms: \\(x^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3\\).\nInner terms: \\(2x * x^2 = 2x^3\\).\nLast terms: \\(2x * (-2x) = -4x^2\\).\nWait, maybe I'm not expanding correctly.\n\nWait, no. Let me use the distributive property step by step.\n\n\\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\):\n\nMultiply \\(x^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial:\n\\(x^2 * x^2 = x^4\\),\n\\(x^2 * (-2x) = -2x^3\\),\n\\(x^2 * 2 = 2x^2\\).\n\nMultiply \\(2x\\) by each term:\n\\(2x * x^2 = 2x^3\\),\n\\(2x * (-2x) = -4x^2\\),\n\\(2x * 2 = 4x\\).\n\nMultiply 2 by each term:\n\\(2 * x^2 = 2x^2\\),\n\\(2 * (-2x) = -4x\\),\n\\(2 * 2 = 4\\).\n\nNow add all these together:\n\n\\(x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2"
