            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number w, which is the result of rotating z around c by \u03c0/4 radians counter-clockwise. The given z is 2 + sqrt(2) minus (3 + 3\u221a2)i, and c is 2 - 3i. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that rotating a complex number around another complex number involves translating the complex plane so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, then applying the rotation, and then translating back. That sounds a bit involved, but I think it's manageable.\n\nLet me denote z as 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3\u221a2)i. So, in the form a + bi, that would be a = 2 + sqrt(2) and b = -(3 + 3\u221a2). And c is given as 2 - 3i, so its real part is 2 and imaginary part is -3.\n\nThe process, as I recall, is:\n\n1. Translate z by subtracting c, so z' = z - c. This moves the center c to the origin.\n2. Rotate z' by the given angle, which is \u03c0/4. For rotation in the complex plane, multiplying by e^{i\u03b8} does the trick. Since \u03c0/4 is 45 degrees, e^{i\u03c0/4} is cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4), which is sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n3. After rotation, translate back by adding c, so w' = w'' + c.\n\nWait, let me make sure I have the order right. It's translate, rotate, then translate back. So, z' = z - c, then multiply by e^{i\u03b8} to get the rotated point, then add c to get w.\n\nSo, let me compute z' first.\n\nz = (2 + sqrt(2)) + (-3 - 3\u221a2)i\n\nc = 2 + (-3)i\n\nSo, z' = z - c = [ (2 + sqrt(2)) - 2 ] + [ (-3 - 3\u221a2) - (-3) ]i\n\nCalculating real part: (2 + sqrt(2)) - 2 = sqrt(2)\n\nImaginary part: (-3 - 3\u221a"

Now, I need to rotate this by \u03c0/4, which is 45 degrees.\n\nRotation in complex plane is done by multiplying by e^{i\u03b8}. Let's compute e^{i\u03c0/4} which is cos(\u03c0/4) + i sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.\n\nSo, let me write z' as a complex number. z' is sqrt(2) - 3\u221a2 i, so in the form a + bi, a = sqrt(2), b = -3\u221a2.\n\nMultiplying z' by e^{i\u03c0/4}:\n\nw'' = z' * e^{i\u03c0/4} = [sqrt(2) - 3\u221a2 i] * [sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2]\n\nLet's compute this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the product:\n\n= sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2) * i sqrt(2)/2 - 3\u221a2 i * sqrt(2)/2 - 3\u221a2 i * i sqrt(2)/2\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1. sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = (2)/2 = 1\n2. sqrt(2) * i sqrt(2)/2 = i * (2)/2 = i * 1 = i\n3. -3\u221a2 i * sqrt(2)/2 = -3\u221a2 * sqrt(2)/2 * i = Let's compute sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so it becomes -3*2/2 * i = -3i\n4. -3\u221a2 i * i sqrt(2)/2 = Let's see, i * i = i\u00b2 = -1. So, we have -3\u221a2 * sqrt(2)/2 * (-1) = Compute sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so it's -3*2/2 * (-1) = -3*(-1) = 3\n\n"

So, real part is 2 + sqrt(2), imaginary part is - (3 + 3\u221a2).

Let me factor out sqrt(2):\n\nsqrt(2)*(1 - 3i).
