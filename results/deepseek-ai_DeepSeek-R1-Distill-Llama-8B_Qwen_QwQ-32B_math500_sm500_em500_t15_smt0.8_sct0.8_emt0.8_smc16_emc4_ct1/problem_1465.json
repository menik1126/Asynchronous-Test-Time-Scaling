A is directly north of O, B is directly west of O, C is directly south of O, and D is directly east of O. The distance between C and D is 140 meters. There's a hot-air balloon at point H, which is directly above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. Rope HC is 150 meters long, and HD is 130 meters long. \n\nNow, the goal is to replace ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. The aim is to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved by doing this. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the setup. O is the origin point with A, B, C, D around it. H is directly above O, so it's like a point at (0, h) assuming O is at (0,0). \n\nSince A is directly north of O, A would be at (0, a) where a is some positive value. Similarly, B is directly west, so (-b, 0), C is directly south, (0, -c), and D is directly east, (d, 0). But wait, in the given problem, it's mentioned that the distance between C and D is 140 meters. C is at (0, -c) and D is at (d, 0). So the distance between C and D would be sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2) = sqrt(d\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 140. So that's one equation: d\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 140\u00b2.\n\nNext, the ropes. HA, HB, HC, HD connect H to A, B, C, D respectively. So each rope is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. \n\nFor example, HA is the rope from H to A, which is (0, h) to (0, a). So the length of HA is |h - a|. Similarly, HB is from (0, h) to (-b, 0). So the length is sqrt( (-b - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2 ) = sqrt(b\u00b2 + h\u00b2)."

Wait, H is directly above O, so H's coordinates would be (0,0, h) in 3D, but since it's a 2D field with height, maybe in the problem they consider H as (0,0) elevated by h meters in the air. But all the distances between H and the ground points would just be straight lines through 3D space. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the balloon is positioned in the air at H directly above O\", and ropes HA, etc., are the ropes connecting the balloon to each of these points. So the ropes are from H to each of the points A, B, C, D on the ground. So in coordinates, if O is (0,0,0), then H is (0,0, h). The points on the ground would have z-coordinate zero. So the distance from H to any ground point (x,y,0) would be sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + h\u00b2). \n\nTherefore, the length of rope HC is 150 meters. Since point C is directly south of O, which is (0, 0, 0), so point C would be (0, -c, 0). Therefore, the distance from H (0, 0, h) to C is sqrt( (0)^2 + (-c - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2 )? Wait, no. Wait, coordinates in the problem probably are in 2D since it's a flat field. The balloon is above O, so coordinates in the plane can be treated as (x, y), and the balloon is at (O_x, O_y, h). But the problem mentions Asymptote code where maybe they use 2D coordinates but with an H at (0, 2.5). Hmm, but maybe for the distance calculations, we need to consider 3D distances. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a coordinate system. Let me think again. Let me set O as (0,0). Then point A is (0, a), B is (-b, 0), C is (0, -c), D is (d, "

Similarly for HB: point B is (-b, 0,0), so distance from H to B is sqrt( (-b)^2 + 0^2 + h\u00b2 ) = sqrt(b\u00b2 + h\u00b2).

No, because A is north, B is west, C is south, D is east.

We find that the total length of the ropes to be replaced is 280 meters. We then find the optimal point P on the line segment CD such that the single rope HP is the shortest possible. By minimizing the distance from H to P using calculus, we find that the minimal length of HP is 120 meters. The greatest length saved is the difference between the original ropes (280 meters) and the new rope (120 meters), resulting in a savings of 160 meters.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{160}"
