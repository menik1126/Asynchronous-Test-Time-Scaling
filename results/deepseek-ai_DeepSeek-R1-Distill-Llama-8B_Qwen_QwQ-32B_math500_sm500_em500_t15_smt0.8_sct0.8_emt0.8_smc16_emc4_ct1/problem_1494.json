A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Listing them out, the prime numbers less than 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll consider the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are those that are not divisible by 2. Therefore, the set includes numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to find the intersection of these two sets. The intersection consists of the numbers that are common to both sets. Looking at the prime numbers less than 30, I notice that all of them except for the number 2 are odd. This means that the intersection includes all the prime numbers less than 30 except for 2.\n\nCounting these, there are 10 prime numbers less than 30 in total. Excluding 2, there are 9 primes that are also odd numbers.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero is 9.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Sets:**\n   - **Set A:** Prime numbers less than 30.\n   - **Set B:** Odd numbers greater than zero.\n\n2. **List the Prime Numbers Less Than 30:**\n   - The prime numbers less than 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.\n   - **Total primes in Set A:** 10.\n\n3. **Understand Set B (Odd Numbers > 0):**\n   - Odd numbers are numbers not divisible by 2. They start from 1 (since 0 is neither odd nor even, and the problem specifies \"greater than zero\").\n   - Examples: 1, 3, 5, 7, ... etc.\n\n4. **Find the"
