These primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I will determine the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, and so on.\n\nNow, I will find the intersection of these two sets. The intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd and less than 30. Examining the list of primes less than 30, I remove the even prime, which is 2, resulting in the primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nThese remaining primes are all odd, so the intersection is simply the set of these primes. Counting them, there are 9 elements in the intersection.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Set of Prime Numbers Less Than 30:**\n   \n   The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n   \\[\n   \\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\\}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify the Set of All Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero:**\n   \n   The set of all odd numbers greater than zero is:\n   \\[\n   \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, \\dots\\}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Find the Intersection of the Two Sets:**\n   \n   The intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd and less than 30. From the prime numbers less than 30, we exclude the even prime number 2:\n   \\[\n   \\{3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, "
