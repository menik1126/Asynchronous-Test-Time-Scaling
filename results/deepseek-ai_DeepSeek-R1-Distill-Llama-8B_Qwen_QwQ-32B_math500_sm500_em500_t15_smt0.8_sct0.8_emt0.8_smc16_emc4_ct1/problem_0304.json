            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). Then, from those, I have to determine a, b, and c, which are the x-values of the vertical asymptotes and the y-value of the horizontal asymptote respectively. Finally, I have to add them together to find a + b + c.\n\nFirst, let me recall what vertical and horizontal asymptotes mean. For a rational function like this, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I should factor the denominator to find those x-values.\n\nThe denominator is x² - 5x -14. Let me try to factor that. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 could be (2, -7) or (-2, 7). Let's check: 2 + (-7) = -5. Yes, that works. So, the denominator factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a and b are -2 and 7, but I need to figure out which is which.\n\nNow, for the horizontal asymptote. Horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. In this case, the numerator is degree 1 (2x) and the denominator is degree 2 (x²). Since the degree of the denominator is higher, the horizontal asymptote will be at y = 0. So, c is 0.\n\nPutting it all together, vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7, so a and b are -2 and 7. Adding them together: (-2) + 7 = 5. Then, adding c, which is 0: 5 + 0 = 5.\n\nWait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The denominator factoring: x² -5x -14. Let's calculate the discriminant to confirm. The discriminant is b² - 4ac = 25 + 56 = 81. Square root of 81 is 9, so roots are at (5 ±9)/2, which gives (14/"

            "output": "2)=7 and (-4/2)=-2. Yep, that matches. So the vertical asymptotes are indeed at x = -2 and x =7.\n\nHorizontal asymptote: since the numerator's degree is less than the denominator's, the horizontal asymptote is y=0. That's correct. So adding them: -2 +7 +0 =5. Hmm, seems right. But let me check if the question specifies the order of a and b. The problem says vertical asymptotes are x=a and x=b. Since they didn't specify order, but in the answer, a + b would just be the sum, so order doesn't matter. So the total is 5 +0 =5. \n\nWait, but let me check the horizontal asymptote again. Maybe I was too quick. The horizontal asymptote is determined by the leading coefficients when the degrees are compared. Since numerator is degree 1, denominator degree 2, as x approaches infinity, the function behaves like 2x / x² = 2/x, which goes to 0. So yes, horizontal asymptote at 0. So c is 0. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 5 +0 =5. So the answer is 5. \n\nWait, but let me check if the numerator and denominator have any common factors. The numerator is 2x, denominator factors to (x+2)(x-7). There's no common factors, so the vertical asymptotes are indeed at -2 and 7. \n\nYep, I think that's solid. So a + b + c = -2 +7 +0 =5. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{5}\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\), we factor the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7)\n\\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the vertical asymptotes at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\). Thus, \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\nNext, we determine the horizontal asymptote. Since the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2), the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0"
