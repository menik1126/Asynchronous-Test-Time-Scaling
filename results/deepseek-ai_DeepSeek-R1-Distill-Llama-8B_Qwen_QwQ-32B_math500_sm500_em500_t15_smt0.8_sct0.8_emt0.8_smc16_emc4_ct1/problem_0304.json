Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5, I find that -7 and 2 satisfy these conditions. Therefore, the denominator factors to \\( (x - 7)(x + 2) \\).\n\nThis means the vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero, so at \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). These correspond to \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 7 \\).\n\nNext, to find the horizontal asymptote, I'll consider the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is of degree 1, and the denominator is of degree 2. When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nFinally, adding these values together: \\( a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll analyze the given function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\) to find its vertical asymptotes and horizontal asymptote.\n\n1. **Vertical Asymptotes (\\( x = a \\) and \\( x = b \\))**:\n   - **Factor the Denominator**:\n     \\[\n     x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)\n     \\]\n   - **Set Each Factor Equal to Zero**:\n     \\[\n     x - 7 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 7\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -2\n     \\]\n   - **Vertical Asymptotes**:\n     \\[\n     a = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = 7\n     \\]\n\n2. **Horizontal Asymptote (\\( y = c \\))**:\n   - **Degrees of Numerator and Denominator**:\n     - Numerator: Degree \\( "
