The expression \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\) can be rewritten as \\(4 \\cdot 78125\\), which equals \\(312500\\).\n\nNext, I convert the fraction to its decimal form by dividing 21 by the denominator. This gives me \\(0.000066\\).\n\nFinally, I ensure that the decimal terminates by expressing it as \\(0.000066\\).\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Denominator:**\n   \n   The denominator is already in its factored form. We can keep it as is for easier manipulation.\n\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 4 \\cdot 78125 = 312500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert to Decimal Form:**\n   \n   Divide the numerator by the denominator to convert the fraction to a decimal.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{312500} = 0.000066\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express as a Terminating Decimal:**\n   \n   The decimal \\(0.000066\\) is already a terminating decimal because the denominator has only factors of 2 and 5 (when simplified), which are the prime factors of 10.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.000066}\n   \\]"
