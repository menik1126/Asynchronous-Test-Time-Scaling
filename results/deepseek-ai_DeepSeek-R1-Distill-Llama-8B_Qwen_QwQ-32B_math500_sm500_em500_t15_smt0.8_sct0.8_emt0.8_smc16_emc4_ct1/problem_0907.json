            "output": "Okay, so I've got this fraction here: 21 divided by (2 squared times 5 to the seventh power). The question is asking me to convert this into a terminating decimal. Hmm, I remember that terminating decimals have denominators that are products of powers of 2 and 5 only, right? So, if I can manipulate this denominator to fit that form, the decimal should terminate. \n\nFirst, let me write out the denominator to make it clearer. 2 squared is 4, and 5 to the seventh power is 78,125. So, the denominator is 4 times 78,125. Let me calculate that. 78,125 times 4... 78,125 * 4: 4 times 5 is 20, so that's 4 in the ones place, carry over 2. Then 4 times 2 is 8, plus the carried over 2 is 10, so write down 0 and carry over 1. 4 times 1 is 4, plus the carried over 1 is 5. 4 times 8 is 32, write down 2 and carry over 3. 4 times 7 is 28, plus 3 is 31, write down 1 and carry over 3. 4 times 1 is 4, plus 3 is 7. So, the denominator is 312,500.\n\nSo now, the fraction is 21 over 312,500. To convert this to a decimal, I can perform the division 21 \u00f7 312,500. But doing division by such a large number might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way using exponents and moving decimals?\n\nI recall that any fraction where the denominator is only composed of 2s and 5s in its prime factors can be expressed as a terminating decimal. Since 2 squared and 5 to the seventh are already in the denominator, maybe I can manipulate the fraction to make the denominator a power of 10. \n\nTo do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the appropriate power of 10 so that the denominator becomes a power of 10. But wait, the denominator is 2^2 * 5^7, which is 4 * 78,125 = 312,500. To make this a power of 10, I need to have the same number of 2s"

            "output": " and 5s. Since there are more 5s here (7) than 2s (2), I need to multiply by 2^(7-2) = 2^5 to balance them out. \n\nSo, if I multiply both numerator and denominator by 2^5, that would give me a denominator of 2^(2+5) * 5^7 = 2^7 * 5^7 = (2*5)^7 = 10^7. That's a power of 10, which is exactly what I need. \n\nLet me compute 2^5 first. 2^5 is 32. So, multiplying numerator and denominator by 32:\n\nNumerator becomes 21 * 32. Let me calculate that. 20*32 is 640, and 1*32 is 32, so total is 640 +32 = 672.\n\nDenominator becomes 2^2 *5^7 *2^5 = 2^(2+5)*5^7 = 2^7 *5^7 = 10^7, which is 10,000,000.\n\nSo now the fraction is 672/10,000,000. To convert this to a decimal, I can write it as 0.0000672. Wait, let me check that. \n\nSince 10^7 is 10 million, dividing by 10^7 moves the decimal point seven places to the left. Starting with 672, which is the same as 672.0. Moving the decimal seven places left: \n\nFirst place: 67.2, second: 6.72, third: 0.672, fourth: 0.0672, fifth: 0.00672, sixth: 0.000672, seventh: 0.0000672. \n\nYes, that's seven places. So the decimal is 0.0000672. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this another way. Alternatively, maybe I can do the division step by step. Let's see. 21 divided by 312"

            "output": ",500. \n\n312,500 goes into 21 zero times. So we add a decimal point and some zeros. That would make it 21.000000... Then, 312,500 goes into 210,000 zero times. 312,500 goes into 2,100,000 how many times? Let's divide 2,100,000 by 312,500. 312,500 * 6 is 1,875,000. 312,500 * 7 is 2,187,500, which is too much because 2,187,500 is more than 2,100,000. So, 6 times. 6*312,500 = 1,875,000. Subtracting from 2,100,000, we get 225,000. Bring down the next zero, making it 2,250,000.\n\nNow, 312,500 goes into 2,250,000 how many times? 312,500*7=2,187,500. 2,250,000 - 2,187,500 = 62,500. Bring down the next zero, making it 625,000.\n\n312,500 goes into 625,000 twice exactly (2*312,500=625,000). Subtracting, we get 0. Bring down the next zero, making it 0.000, and we can stop here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the decimal is 0.0000672. Yep, same as before. \n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Express the denominator as 2^2 *5^7.\n2. Since 2^2 has fewer 2s than 5^7, multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7-2)=2^5=32 to make the denominator a power of 10 (10^7).\n3. Multiply numerator by 32: 21*32=672.\n4. Denominator becomes 10^7=10,000,000.\n5. Perform the division 672 \u00f710,000,000, which moves the decimal seven places left, resulting in 0.0000672.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express the denominator in prime factors**: \n   \\[\n   2"
