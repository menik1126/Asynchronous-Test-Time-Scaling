            "output": "First, I'll determine Bill's total displacement in the south direction. He walks 1/2 mile south twice, which totals to 1 mile south.\n\nNext, I'll calculate his eastward displacement. He walks 3/4 mile east once, so his eastward distance is 3/4 mile.\n\nNow, I'll apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point. The southward distance is the opposite side, the eastward distance is the adjacent side, and the hypotenuse represents his straight-line distance.\n\nSo, the straight-line distance (d) is equal to the square root of (1 squared plus (3/4) squared). Calculating that gives me the final distance.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how far Bill is from his starting point in a direct line, we'll break down his movements and use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Southward Displacement:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile (south)} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile (south)} = 1 \\text{ mile (south)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Eastward Displacement:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile (east)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Southward Displacement})^2 + (\\text{Eastward Displacement})^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.25}\n\\]"
