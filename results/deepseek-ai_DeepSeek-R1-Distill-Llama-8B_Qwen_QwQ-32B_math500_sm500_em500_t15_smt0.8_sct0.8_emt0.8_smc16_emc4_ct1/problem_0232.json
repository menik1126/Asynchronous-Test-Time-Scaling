The southward distance forms one leg of a right triangle, and the eastward distance forms the other leg.\n\nCalculating the line-of-sight distance requires taking the square root of the sum of the squares of these two distances.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine Bill's straight-line distance from his starting point step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Southward Displacement:**\n   - First movement: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - Second movement: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - **Total southward displacement:** \n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Eastward Displacement:**\n   - Third movement: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n   - **Eastward displacement:** \n     \\[\n     \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Straight-Line Distance Using Pythagoras' Theorem:**\n   - Let \\( D \\) be the direct-line distance.\n   - Southward distance: \\( 1 \\) mile.\n   - Eastward distance: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile.\n   - Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     D = \\sqrt{(1)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nBill is \\(\\boxed{1.25}\\) miles away from his starting point."
