            "output": "First, I need to understand the relationship between the expressions given in the problem. The statement says that half of the value of 3x minus 9 is equal to x plus 37. So, I can express this as an equation: (1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37.\n\nNext, I'll eliminate the fraction to make the equation easier to work with. I can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives me 2*(3x - 9) = 2*(x + 37). This simplifies to 6x - 18 = 2x + 74.\n\nNow, I want to collect like terms on one side of the equation. I'll subtract 2x from both sides, resulting in 4x - 18 = 74. Then, I'll add 18 to both sides to isolate the term with x, which gives me 4x = 92.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for x by dividing both sides by 4, leading to x = 23.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = 23}\n\\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Given Relationship:**\n   \n   We're told that half the value of \\( 3x - 9 \\) is equal to \\( x + 37 \\). This can be written as:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eliminate the Fraction:**\n   \n   To simplify the equation, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n   \n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\times (x + 37)\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n\n3. **Collect Like Terms:**\n   \n   Subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides to gather like terms:\n   \n   \\[\n   3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplifying:\n   \n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \n   Add 9 to both sides"
