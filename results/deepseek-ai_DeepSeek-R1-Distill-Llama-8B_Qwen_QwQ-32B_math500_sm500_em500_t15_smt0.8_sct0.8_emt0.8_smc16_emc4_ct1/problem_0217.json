The largest circle is the outermost one with a radius of 7, followed by the middle circle with a radius of 6, and the innermost circle with a radius of 4.\n\nThe region labeled X is between the radii of 4 and 6, Y is between 6 and 7, and Z is inside the innermost circle with a radius of 4.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the area of each annulus.\n\nFor region X, the area is π(6² - 4²) = π(36 - 16) = 20π.\n\nFor region Y, the area is π(7² - 6²) = π(49 - 36) = 13π.\n\nFor region Z, the area is π(4²) = 16π.\n\nComparing these areas, the greatest area is 20π (region X), and the smallest is 13π (region Y).\n\nFinally, the difference between these areas is 20π - 13π = 7π.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the difference between the greatest and smallest areas among the regions labeled \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\), let's analyze the diagram step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Diagram\n- **Concentric Circles:** There are three concentric circles with radii of 4, 6, and 7 from inner to outer.\n- **Regions:**\n  - **Region \\(X\\):** Between the radii 4 and 6.\n  - **Region \\(Y\\):** Between the radii 6 and 7.\n  - **Region \\(Z\\):** Inside the smallest circle (radius 4).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Areas\nThe area of a circle is \\(\\pi r^2\\). The area between two concentric circles (an annulus) is the difference of their areas.\n\n1. **Area of Region \\(X\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area}_X = \\pi (6^2 - 4^2) = \\pi (36 - 16) = 20\\pi\n"
