            "output": "I need to determine the areas of the regions X, Y, and Z formed by the three concentric circles with radii 4, 6, and 7.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the area of the largest circle, which is the area of the circle with radius 7. The formula for the area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, so the area is \u03c0*(7)^2 = 49\u03c0.\n\nNext, I'll find the area of the middle circle with radius 6. Using the same formula, the area is \u03c0*(6)^2 = 36\u03c0.\n\nThen, I'll compute the area of the smallest circle with radius 4. Applying the formula, the area is \u03c0*(4)^2 = 16\u03c0.\n\nNow, I'll determine the areas of each region:\n- Region Y is the area between the largest circle and the middle circle, so its area is 49\u03c0 - 36\u03c0 = 13\u03c0.\n- Region X is the area between the middle circle and the smallest circle, which is 36\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = 20\u03c0.\n- Region Z is the area of the smallest circle, which is 16\u03c0.\n\nFinally, I'll find the difference between the largest and smallest areas. The largest area is Y with 13\u03c0, and the smallest is Z with 16\u03c0. The difference is 13\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = -3\u03c0. However, since the question asks for the absolute difference, it's 3\u03c0.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll analyze the areas of the three regions \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\) formed by the three concentric circles with radii 4, 6, and 7.\n\n1. **Calculate the area of each circle:**\n   - **Area of the largest circle (radius 7):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{largest}} = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Area of the middle circle (radius 6):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{middle}} = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Area of the smallest circle (radius 4):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_{\\text{smallest}} = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16"
