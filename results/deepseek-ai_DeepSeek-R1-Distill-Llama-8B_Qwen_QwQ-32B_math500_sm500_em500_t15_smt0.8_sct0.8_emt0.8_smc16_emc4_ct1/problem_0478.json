The equations given are:\n\n1. \\(xyz = 4\\)\n2. \\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\\)\n3. \\(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\\)\n\nAnd I need to find \\(xy + yz + zx\\). Hmm, this looks like a system of equations, and I remember some identities involving sums and products of variables. Maybe I can relate them to symmetric sums or something like that.\n\nFirst, let me recall some identities. I know that \\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\\). That might be useful here because I have \\(x^3 + y^3 + z^3\\) and \\(xyz\\). So, plugging in the known values:\n\n\\(4 - 3*4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\\)\n\nCalculating the left side: 4 - 12 = -8. So,\n\n\\(-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\\)\n\nI don't know \\(x + y + z\\) or \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx\\), but maybe I can find another equation that relates these terms.\n\nLooking at the third equation: \\(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\\). This can be rewritten by factoring each term. Let me see:\n\nEach term is like \\(xy^2\\), \\(x^2 y\\), etc. So, maybe this can be expressed in terms of symmetric sums.\n\nWait, I can factor this as \\(xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y)\\), but that might not be the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, notice that this sum is equal to \\((x + y + z)(xy + yz +"

So,\n\nThird equation: \\((x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12\\)\n\nWe know \\(xyz = 4\\), so substituting:\n\n\\((x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3*4 = 12\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\((x + y + z)(S) - 12 = 12\\), where \\(S = xy + yz + zx\\).\n\nSo, \\((x + y + z)S = 24\\).\n\nNow, from the first identity, we have:\n\n\\(-8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - S)\\)\n\nSo, let me denote \\(T = x + y + z\\) and \\(U = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - S\\).\n\nThen, the first identity becomes:\n\n\\(-8 = T * U\\)  ...(1)\n\nAnd from the third equation, we have:\n\n\\(T * S = 24\\)  ...(2)\n\nSo, we have:\n\nFrom equation (2): \\(T = 24 / S\\)\n\nFrom equation (1): \\(U = -8 / T\\)\n\nBut also, note that \\(U = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - S\\), so:\n\n\\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = U + S = (-8 / T) + S\\)\n\nBut \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\) can be related to \\(T\\) and \\(S\\) via the identity:\n\n\\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = T^2 - 2S\\)\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\(T^2 - 2S = U + S = (-8 /"
