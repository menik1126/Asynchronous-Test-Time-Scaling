And the question is asking for the units digit of 4$$.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a superfactorial is. From what I remember, the superfactorial is a generalization of the factorial function. Instead of multiplying a number by all the numbers below it down to 1, for the superfactorial, you take the factorial and raise it to the power of itself multiple times. So for n=4, it would be 4!^(4!^(4!^...)) with the exponent being 4! repeated n! times, which in this case is 4! times, right?\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check the definition. The problem says it's n! raised to the power of (n! raised to the power of ...), with the number of exponents being n!. So for n=4, it's 4! raised to the power of (4! raised to the power of 4!) because it's 4! times. So, 4! is 24, so 24^24. But wait, is that it? Let me make sure.\n\nNo, that would be if it's just 4!^4!. But the superfactorial is defined as n! raised to the power of n! repeatedly n! times. So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse this expression.\n\nWait, so for n=1, it's 1! =1. For n=2, it's 2!^(2!) = 2^2=4. For n=3, it's 3!^(3!^(3!)) = 6^(6^6). For n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). So it's four factorials stacked as exponents, right?\n\nBut calculating something like 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)) seems incredibly large. The number would be enormous, but we're only interested in the units digit. So maybe there's a pattern in the units"

            "output": " digits of such large exponents that we can exploit.\n\nFirst, let me compute 4! first. Since 4! is 24. Therefore, the superfactorial 4$$ is 24^(24^(24^...^24}) where the total number of 24s is 24? Wait, because n! is the number of exponents here. Wait, the problem states that n$ is equal to the number of exponents being n!?\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nn$\\$ = \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}$\n\nSo the expression is a tower of exponents with n! instances of n! in the tower. Since n is 4, n! is 24, so the tower will have 24 copies of 24, right? So the superfactorial is 24^24^24^...^24 (24 times). That is a tower of exponents 24 levels high. Obviously, computing this directly is impossible, so we need a different approach.\n\nBut the question is the units digit of such a tower. So we need to find the last digit of this tower of 24s. Since the last digit of a number raised to a power cycles with some period, perhaps we can use modular arithmetic to find it modulo 10.\n\nTo find the units digit, we can compute the number modulo 10. Since 10 factors into 2 and 5, perhaps Euler's theorem or Euler's totient theorem can help. Let me recall Euler's theorem: if a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n. However, 24 and 10 are not coprime (since gcd(24,10)=2), so Euler's theorem may not apply directly here. Hmm, maybe we can handle it by reducing the problem modulo 10 and looking for cycles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps breaking down mod 2 and mod 5 and using Chinese remainder theorem? Since 10 is 2×5, coprime.\n\nAlternatively, the units digit of a number is determined by its value mod 10. So let's compute the tower modulo 10. Let me see if"

            "output": " I can find a pattern or compute it step by step.\n\nWait, since we're dealing with exponents, perhaps the key lies in computing the exponent modulo φ(10). φ(10) is 4, since the numbers coprime to 10 below 10 are 1,3,7,9. So φ(10)=4.\n\nBut 24 and 10 are not coprime, so Euler's theorem doesn't apply. Therefore, maybe we need to compute mod 4 first? Wait, no, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the chain of exponents can be simplified by considering that 24 mod 4 is 0, so when we have exponents, perhaps certain periodicity applies.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the tower step by step, reducing modulo 10 at each step.\n\nLet me define the tower as E = 24^k, where k itself is a tower of 24s of height 23. But maybe that's not feasible. Let me see another approach.\n\nI remember that the units digit of powers of 24 repeats every certain number. But 24 mod 10 is 4. So 24^anything will have the same units digit as 4^anything. So 24^k ≡ 4^k mod 10.\n\nTherefore, the entire tower 24^(24^(24^...^24)) is equivalent to 4^(4^(4^...^4)) mod 10, with the same height as the original tower, which is 24.\n\nSo, 4^1 =4, units digit 4.\n\n4^2=16, units digit 6.\n\n4^3=64, units digit 4.\n\n4^4=256, units digit 6.\n\nSo the cycle is 4,6,4,6,... every two steps.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4^k depends on whether k is odd or even. If k is odd, units digit is 4. If k is even, units digit is 6.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to finding whether the exponent (the tower of 24s of height 23) is odd or even.\n\nWait, but 4^anything: if the exponent is even, the units digit is 6; if odd, it's 4. So the key is whether the tower exponent is even or odd.\n\nWhat is the tower's exponent? It"

Therefore, the units digit is 6?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the tower is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24. Wait, actually, the total height is 24. So the topmost exponent is 24, then the next is 24^24, etc. But when we reduce the problem to 4^k mod 10, where k is the tower of 24s of height 23. Since 24 is even, any exponentiation of 24 will be even. So the exponent k is even. Therefore, 4^even mod 10 is 6. So the units digit is 6?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me try to formalize this step by step.\n\nFirst, the superfactorial 4$$ is a tower of 24s of height 24. Let me denote this as T(24), where T(n) is a tower of n copies of 24. So T(24) = 24^24^24^...^24 (24 times). We need to find T(24) mod 10.\n\nAs 24 mod 10 = 4, so T(24) mod 10 = 4^{T(23)} mod 10, where T(23) is the tower of 24s of height 23.\n\nNow, to compute 4^{T(23)} mod 10, we can note that 4 has a cycle of 2 mod 10. So 4^1 mod10=4, 4^2 mod10=6, 4^3 mod10=4, etc. So the cycle length is 2. Therefore, the exponent T(23) mod 2 will determine the result.\n\nIf T(23) is even, then 4^{even} mod"

So the exponent is 24^24^...24. Let me look at the exponent T(22).\n\nSo T(23) = 24^{T(22)}. Since 24 is congruent to 0 mod 2, any power of 24 is congruent to 0 mod 2. Therefore, T(23) is even. So, T(23) ≡ 0 mod 2.\n\nThus, 4^{T(23)} ≡ 4^{0 mod 2} ≡ 4^0 mod 2? Wait, no. Wait, 4^{even} ≡ 6 mod10, regardless of how big the exponent is, as long as it's even. Because 4^2=16, 4^4=256, 4^6=4096, etc., all have units digit 6.\n\nSo regardless of whether T(23) is 0 or 2 or 4 mod 2, since it's even, 4^{T(23)} will have units digit 6. Therefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think.\n\nWait, we can also consider that 24 is even, so any exponentiation of 24 will be even, as above. So any tower of 24s greater than or equal to 1 will be even, because 24^k is even. So T(24) = 24^{T(23)}, which is even. Wait, but in this case, how does this affect the exponent in 4^{...}?\n\nWait, 4^{T(23)}. Since T(23) is even, so 4^{even} mod10=6.\n\nWait, so in summary: T(24) mod10=4^{T(23)} mod10=6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me try with a smaller superfactorial to test.

For n=4, following the same logic, since the exponent is even, it would also be 6? Wait, but let me check n=3 again.\n\nWait, 3! is 6. So the tower is 6^(6^6). The exponent is 6^6, which is even. So 6^(even). But 6 to any power is 6 mod10. So regardless of exponent, 6^anything mod10 is 6. So that's why 3$$ has units digit 6. So for n=4, the tower is 24^(24^...). Since 24 mod10 is 4, so 4^(even) mod10 is 6. So same as 3$$, so 6?\n\nWait, but let me see n=1: 1$$ is 1! =1, units digit 1. n=2 is 4, n=3 is 6, n=4 is 6? Hmm, so maybe the answer is 6?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me try to see if there's a case where the exponent could be odd. For example, if the exponent was 1, but in our case, the exponent is a tower of 24s. Since 24 is even, any tower of 24s will be even, so the exponent is even, so 4^even mod10 is 6.

So T(23)=24^{T(22)}. Now, since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even. Therefore, T(22) is some number, which when exponentiated by 24 gives T(23), which is even.\n\nSo T(23) is even, so when we compute 4^{T(23)} mod10, it's 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4$$ is 6. So the answer is 6.\n\nWait, so for n=3, the tower is 6^(6^6). 6^6 is 46656, which is even, so 6^(even) is 6 mod10. So yeah, units digit is 6.\n\nTherefore, for n=4, the answer is 6.\n\nI think that's correct. So, to summarize: by reducing each step mod10, and noting that any tower of 24s is even, the exponent is even, so 4^even mod10=6.\n</think>\n\nThe units digit of \\(4\\$$\\) can be found by recognizing that the superfactorial of 4 is a tower of 24s with a height of 24.
