Since we're dealing with 4, the superfactorial will have a tower of exponents all of which are 4!'s. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what 4! is. 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. So, each exponent in the tower will be 24. That means 4\\$ is equal to 24^{24^{24^{...}}}} with four 24s at the top. Wait, no, hold on. The superfactorial is defined as starting with n, then each level is n! raised to the previous level. So for 4, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. So actually, the tower has four 4!s: the base is 24, then each exponent is also 24. So, 4\\$ is 24^(24^(24^24)).\n\nBut calculating that directly is impossible because it's an astronomically large number. However, we're only interested in the units digit, so perhaps we can find a pattern or use modular arithmetic properties to simplify this.\n\nTo find the units digit, we need the number modulo 10. So, our goal is to compute 4\\$ mod 10. Let's represent this as:\n\n4\\$ ≡ ? mod 10\n\nSince 4\\$ is 24^(24^(24^24)), we can write this as:\n\n24^(24^(24^24)) mod 10\n\nLet me simplify each part step by step.\n\nFirst, note that 24 ≡ 4 mod 10. So 24^anything ≡ 4^anything mod 10. Therefore, 24^(E) ≡ 4^E mod 10, where E is the exponent tower 24^(24^24).\n\nSo, 4^E mod 10. Now, to compute 4^E mod 10, we can observe the cyclic pattern of powers of 4 modulo 10.\n\nLet's list the powers of 4 modulo 10:\n\n4^1 ≡ 4 mod "

Therefore, the exponent E mod 2 will determine the result. If E is even, the units digit is 6; if odd, it's 4.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute E mod 2, where E = 24^(24^24).\n\nBut 24 is even, so 24^(anything) is even, except when the exponent is 0, but here the exponent is 24^24, which is certainly a positive integer. Therefore, 24^(24^24) is even. Therefore, E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. Wait, E is the exponent in 4^E mod 10. Since E is 24^(24^24). Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so E is even. Therefore, 4^even mod 10 is 6. So the units digit is 6?\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check more carefully. Let me retrace.\n\nFirst step: 4\\$ = 24^(24^(24^24)). To find mod 10, since 24 mod 10 is 4, so it's equivalent to 4^(24^(24^24)) mod 10.\n\nNow, the exponent here is 24^(24^24). Let me denote that exponent as E = 24^(24^24). So, to compute 4^E mod 10, we can use Euler's theorem, but since 4 and 10 are not coprime, Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. Alternatively, since we know the cycle length for 4 mod 10 is 2, as above, so the exponent E mod 2 determines the result"

Let's consider that 24^24 is a very large exponent, but regardless of its value, since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even. So, E = 24^(24^24) is even, so E mod 2 is 0.\n\nTherefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because sometimes when dealing with exponents, especially very high ones, the modulus can cycle in a different way. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, another approach: Since 24 ≡ 4 mod 10, then 24^(anything) ≡ 4^(anything) mod 10, and the cycle of 4 mod 10 is 2.\n\nSo, 4^1=4, 4^2=6, 4^3=4, etc. So, the units digit cycles every 2. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 depends on whether E is even or odd.\n\nThus, E = 24^(24^24). Since 24 is even, 24^any positive integer is even, hence E is even. Therefore, E is even, so 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nSo, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but I have a nagging feeling. Let me think again.\n\nAnother way: Maybe we can compute 24^k mod 10, but since 24 ≡ 4 mod 10, 24^k ≡ 4^k mod 10. Now, 4^k cycles every 2 as follows: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nTherefore, 4^k mod 10 is 6 if k is even, and 4 if k is odd.\n\nSo, since E is 24^(24^24), which is 24 raised to some exponent. Since 24 is even, 24^anything is even, so E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but let me think about"

That's way more than I thought before. Wait, that's a massive tower. So, 4\\$ is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24. That's way more than the previous interpretation. So my initial mistake was thinking it's 4 copies, but actually, it's n! copies, so 24 copies. That complicates things.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"underbrace{ n!^{n!^{...^{n!}}}}_{n!}\" So the underbrace is indicating that the number of terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nTherefore, for n=4, the tower has 24 terms.

Wait, no, not exactly. Wait, the tower is 24, so each exponent is 24, which is 4 mod 10.\n\nBut 24^(something) is (4 mod 10)^(something). So, perhaps we can write the entire expression as 4^(4^(4^...)) mod 10, but with a very tall tower.\n\nBut regardless, the key is that 4^k mod 10 cycles every 2 as follows: 4,6,4,6,... So, if we can find the exponent modulo 2, we can determine whether the result is 4 or 6.\n\nSo, let's denote the tower as T = 4^(4^(4^...)) with 24 fours. So, T = 4^(4^(4^...)) with 24 levels.\n\nWe need to compute 4^T mod 10. Since 4 mod 10 cycles every 2, we need T mod 2.\n\nSo, T = 4^(4^(4^...)) with 24 fours.

Then the units digit of 24 is 4. But according to the formula, since the exponent is 0? Wait, no, if the tower has 1 term, it's just 24, so units digit 4. But according to the previous logic, if the tower has 1 term, then T is 24, so exponent is 24, so 4^24 mod 10. Since 24 is even, 4^24 mod 10 is 6. Wait, but 24 itself has units digit 4. Wait, so there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAh, here's the confusion. The problem defines n\\$ as a tower of n! terms. So, for n=1, 1\\$ would be 1!^{1!} with 1! terms? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the definition again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{...^{n!}}}}_{n!}\" So the number of terms in the tower is n!.\n\nWait, so for n=1, n! =1, so the tower has 1 term, which is 1!.\n\nTherefore, 1\\$ = 1!.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, n! =2, so the tower has 2 terms: 2!^{2!} = 2^2 =4.\n\nFor n=3, n! =6, so the tower has 6 terms: 6^(6^(6^6^6^6)).
