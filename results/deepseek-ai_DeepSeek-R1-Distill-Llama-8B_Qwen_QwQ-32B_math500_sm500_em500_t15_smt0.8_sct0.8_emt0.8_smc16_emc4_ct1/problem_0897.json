The term \\(2^2\\) is already in its prime factor form, and \\(5^7\\) is also prime. So, the denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).\n\nNext, I need to adjust the fraction so that the denominator becomes a power of 10. Since 10 is equal to \\(2 \\cdot 5\\), any power of 10 will be a product of corresponding powers of 2 and 5.\n\nTo reach a power of 10, both the exponent of 2 and the exponent of 5 in the denominator must be the same. Currently, the exponent of 2 is 2, and the exponent of 5 is 7. To balance them, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(5^2\\) to increase the exponent of 5 to 7, matching the exponent of 2.\n\nAfter multiplying the numerator by \\(5^2\\), the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{21 \\cdot 25}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\). Calculating the numerator, \\(21 \\cdot 25 = 525\\). So, the fraction is now \\(\\frac{525}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\).\n\nNow, the denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 10^7\\), which is a power of 10. This means the fraction can be expressed as \\(\\frac{525}{10^7}\\).\n\nFinally, I divide 525 by \\(10^7\\) to convert the fraction into a decimal. Performing the division, \\(525 \\div 10^7 = 0.0000525\\).\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator Structure**:\n   - The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\).\n   - For a fraction to be a terminating decimal, the denominator must be of the form \\(10^n\\), where \\(n\\) is a positive"

This requires the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization to be equal.\n\n2. **Balance the Exponents of 2 and 5**:\n   - The exponent of 2 is 2, and the exponent of 5 is 7.\n   - To balance them, multiply both the numerator and denominator by \\(5^{5}\\) (since \\(7 - 2 = 5\\)):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\times \\frac{5^5}{5^5} = \\frac{21 \\cdot 5^5}{2^2 \\cdot 5^{12}}\n     \\]\n   - Wait, this step is incorrect. Let me correct it:\n     - To balance the exponents, we need to make the exponents of 2 and 5 equal. The current exponents are 2 (for 2) and 7 (for 5). The smaller exponent is 2, so we need to increase the exponent of 2 to 7 by multiplying numerator and denominator by \\(2^{5}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\times \\frac{2^5}{2^5} = \\frac{21 \\cdot 2^5}{2^7 \\cdot 5^7}\n     \\]\n     - Now, the denominator is \\(2^7 \\cdot 5^7 = (2 \\cdot 5)^7 = 10^7\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the Numerator**:\n   - Calculate \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n   - Multiply the numerator: \\(21 \\cdot 32 = 672\\).\n   - The fraction becomes \\(\\frac{672}{10^7}\\).\n\n4. **Convert to Decimal**:\n   - Dividing by \\(10^7\\) moves the decimal point 7 places to the left:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{672}{10^7} = 0.0000672\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{0.0000672}\\)"
