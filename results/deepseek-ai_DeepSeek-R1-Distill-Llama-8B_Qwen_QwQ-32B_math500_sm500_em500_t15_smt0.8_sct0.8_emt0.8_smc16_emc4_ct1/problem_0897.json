            "output": "To convert the fraction \\( \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\) to a terminating decimal, I first need to understand the prime factors of the denominator. The denominator is \\( 2^2 \\times 5^7 \\), which consists of only the primes 2 and 5 raised to their respective powers.\n\nSince the denominator only has prime factors of 2 and 5, the fraction can be expressed as a decimal with a terminating part and a non-terminating part. However, because the exponent of 2 in the denominator is 2, I can convert the fraction to have a denominator that is a power of 10 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \\( 5^{2} \\).\n\nMultiplying \\( 21 \\) by \\( 5^{2} \\) gives \\( 525 \\), and multiplying \\( 2^{2} \\times 5^{7} \\) by \\( 5^{2} \\) results in \\( 10^{2} \\), which is \\( 100 \\).\n\nNow, the fraction becomes \\( \\frac{525}{100} \\), which can be simplified to \\( 5.25 \\).\n\nTherefore, the fraction \\( \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\) can be converted to the terminating decimal \\( 5.25 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   \n   The denominator is \\(2^2 \\times 5^7\\). For a fraction to be a terminating decimal, the denominator must be a power of 10 after simplifying. Since the denominator only has prime factors of 2 and 5, it can be converted to a power of 10.\n\n2. **Equalize the Powers of 2 and 5:**\n   \n   - The denominator has more 5s than 2s (\\(5^7\\) vs. \\(2^2\\)).\n   - To make the powers of 2 equal to the powers of 5, multiply both numerator and denominator by \\(2^{5}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{21 \\times 2^{5}}{2^{2} \\times 5^{7} \\times 2^{5}} = \\frac{21 \\"
