Trailing zeros result from factors of 10 in the number, and since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I need to find how many pairs of 2s and 5s are in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of times 5 appears in the factors of 42!. This is done by dividing 42 by 5, which gives 8.4, and taking the integer part, resulting in 8.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of times 2 appears in the factors of 42!. Dividing 42 by 2 gives 21, and dividing by 4 gives 10.5, taking the integer part, resulting in 10. Dividing by 8 gives 5.25, resulting in 5. Dividing by 16 gives 2.625, resulting in 2. Dividing by 32 gives 1.3125, resulting in 1.\n\nAdding these up: 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39.\n\nSince there are 8 fives and 39 twos, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the smaller count, which is the 8 fives.\n\nTherefore, 42! has 8 trailing zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many trailing zeros \\(42!\\) has, we need to find how many times the number 10 is a factor in \\(42!\\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). The number of trailing zeros is determined by the smaller count of these pairs.\n\n**Step 1: Count the number of 5s in \\(42!\\)**\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8 \\quad \\text{(integer division of 42 by 5)}\n\\]\nThere are **8** factors of 5 in \\(42!\\).\n\n**Step 2: Count the number of 2s in \\(42!\\)**\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{4} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{"
