Let's set up the equation:\n\n45\u03c0 = \u03c0 * (3)\u00b2 * h.\n\nNext, I'll simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \u03c0 to cancel it out:\n\n45 = 9 * h.\n\nThen, I'll divide both sides by 9 to solve for h:\n\nh = 5.\n\nSo, the height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, we'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters\n- Radius \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\).\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the height of the cylinder is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
