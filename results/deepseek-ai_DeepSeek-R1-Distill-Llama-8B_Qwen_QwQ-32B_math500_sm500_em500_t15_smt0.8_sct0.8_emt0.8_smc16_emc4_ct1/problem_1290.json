Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that $a$ is given as 8, so I can substitute that into the expression. That means wherever I see $a$, I can replace it with 8. So the expression inside the parentheses becomes $16\\sqrt[3]{8^2}$. Let me write that down:\n\n$16\\sqrt[3]{8^2}$\n\nWait, what is $8^2$? That should be 8 multiplied by itself, which is 64. So now, the expression inside the parentheses is:\n\n$16\\sqrt[3]{64}$\n\nNow, I need to figure out the cube root of 64. I remember that the cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives the original number. So, 4 times 4 times 4 is 64. Therefore, $\\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$. That means the expression is now:\n\n$16 \\times 4$\n\nOkay, 16 times 4. Let me calculate that. 16 multiplied by 4 is 64. So now, the expression inside the parentheses simplifies to 64. That means the entire original expression is:\n\n$\\left(64\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$\n\nNow, I need to compute the cube root of 64. From earlier, I remember that 4 times 4 times 4 is 64, so the cube root of 64 is 4. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 4.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with $a=8$, substituted into the expression: $\\left(16\\sqrt[3]{8^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$. Calculated $8^2$ as 64, then cube root of 64 is 4, multiplied by 16 gives 64, and then the cube root of 64 is 4. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI think I got it right. So the value of the expression should be 4.\n</think>\n\n$\\left(16\\sqrt[3]{8^2}\\"
