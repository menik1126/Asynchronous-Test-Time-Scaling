Their radii are 4, 6, and 7.\n\nRegion X is the smallest circle, so its area is calculated using the formula for the area of a circle: πr², where r is 4.\n\nRegion Y is the middle ring, which can be found by subtracting the area of the smaller circle from the area of the middle circle: π(6²) - π(4²).\n\nRegion Z is the largest ring, calculated similarly by subtracting the area of the middle circle from the area of the largest circle: π(7²) - π(6²).\n\nAfter calculating the areas of all three regions, I compare them to determine which is the largest and which is the smallest. Then, I find the difference between these two areas.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given three concentric circles with radii of 4, 6, and 7 units. The regions labeled \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\) correspond to the following areas:\n\n1. **Region \\(X\\)**: This is the **innermost circle** with radius 4.\n2. **Region \\(Y\\)**: This is the **middle ring** between radii 4 and 6.\n3. **Region \\(Z\\)**: This is the **outer ring** between radii 6 and 7.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Area of Region \\(X\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } X = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (4)^2 = 16\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Area of Region \\(Y\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } Y = \\pi (6)^2 - \\pi (4)^2 = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Area of Region \\(Z\\)**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } Z = \\pi (7)^2 - \\pi (6)^2 = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Areas**\n\n- **Largest Area**: \\(20\\pi\\) (Region \\(Y\\))\n- **Sm"
