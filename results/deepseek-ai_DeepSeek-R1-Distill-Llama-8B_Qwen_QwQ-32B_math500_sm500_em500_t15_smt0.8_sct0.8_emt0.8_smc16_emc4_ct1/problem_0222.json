            "output": "First, I need to determine the areas of the three regions labeled X, Y, and Z in the diagram of three concentric circles with radii 4, 6, and 7.\n\nI'll start by calculating the area of the largest circle, which has a radius of 7. The area is given by the formula πr², so for the largest circle, the area is π × (7)² = 49π.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the area of the middle circle with a radius of 6. Using the same formula, the area is π × (6)² = 36π.\n\nThen, I'll find the area of the smallest circle with a radius of 4. Applying the formula, the area is π × (4)² = 16π.\n\nNow, I'll determine the areas of the regions. Region Y is the area between the largest and middle circles, so its area is 49π - 36π = 13π.\n\nRegion X is the area between the middle and smallest circles, so its area is 36π - 16π = 20π.\n\nFinally, Region Z is the area of the smallest circle, which is 16π.\n\nComparing the areas, the greatest area is 20π (Region X), and the smallest area is 16π (Region Z). The difference between these areas is 20π - 16π = 4π.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll calculate the areas of each region step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the area of each circle:**\n   - **Largest circle (radius 7):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Middle circle (radius 6):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Smallest circle (radius 4):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the areas of each region:**\n   - **Region Y (between radius 7 and 6):**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area} = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Region"
