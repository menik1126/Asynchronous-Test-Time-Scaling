            "output": "To determine the first term in the sequence greater than 125, I'll start by understanding the sequence's generation rules.\n\nThe sequence begins at 0. The next term is formed by adding 1. Then, multiplying by 1 gives the third term. Adding 2 to that result forms the fourth term. Multiplying by 2 follows, and this pattern continues, alternating between addition and multiplication with successive integers starting from 1.\n\nI'll list out the first several terms based on these rules to identify the pattern and calculate the next terms until I find one exceeding 125.\n\nStarting with 0:\n1. Add 1: 0 + 1 = 1 (second term)\n2. Multiply by 1: 1 × 1 = 1 (third term)\n3. Add 2: 1 + 2 = 3 (fourth term)\n4. Multiply by 2: 3 × 2 = 6 (fifth term)\n5. Add 3: 6 + 3 = 9 (sixth term)\n6. Multiply by 3: 9 × 3 = 27 (seventh term)\n7. Add 4: 27 + 4 = 31 (eighth term)\n8. Multiply by 4: 31 × 4 = 124 (ninth term)\n9. Add 5: 124 + 5 = 129 (tenth term)\n\nAfter calculating up to the tenth term, I find that 129 is the first term that exceeds 125. Therefore, the desired value is 129.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given a sequence defined by the following rules:\n\n- The first term is **0**.\n- Subsequent terms are produced by **alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer beginning with 1**.\n\nLet's build the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **First term:** \\( 0 \\)\n2. **Second term:** \\( 0 + 1 = 1 \\)\n3. **Third term:** \\( 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)\n4. **Fourth term:** \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n5. **Fifth term:** \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)\n6. **Sixth term:** \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\)\n7. **Seventh term:** \\( 9 \\times 3 = "

For  instance, the second term is produced by adding  1 to the first term; the third term is produced by  multiplying the second term by 1; the fourth term  is produced by adding 2 to the third term; and so  on.
