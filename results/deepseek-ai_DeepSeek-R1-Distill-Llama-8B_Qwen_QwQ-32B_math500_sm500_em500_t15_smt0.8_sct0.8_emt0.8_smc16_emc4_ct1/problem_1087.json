            "output": "Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the first term in the sequence that's greater than 125. The sequence starts with 0, and the rest are made by alternately adding and multiplying by each successive integer starting from 1. Hmm, let me try to parse this.\n\nSo the first term is 0. The second term is made by adding 1 to the first term, which would be 0 + 1 = 1. The third term is made by multiplying the second term by 1, so 1 * 1 = 1. The fourth term is adding 2 to the third term, so 1 + 2 = 3. Then the fifth term is multiplying by 2, so 3 * 2 = 6. The sixth term is adding 3, so 6 + 3 = 9. The seventh term is multiplying by 3, so 9 * 3 = 27. Wait, so the sequence so far is 0, 1, 1, 3, 6, 9, 27,...\n\nLet me write down the terms step by step to see the pattern better:\n\nTerm 1: 0\n\nTerm 2: Term1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nTerm 3: Term2 * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1\n\nTerm 4: Term3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTerm 5: Term4 * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6\n\nTerm 6: Term5 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9\n\nTerm 7: Term6 * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27\n\nTerm 8: Term7 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31\n\nTerm 9: Term8 * 4 = 31 * 4 = 124\n\nTerm 10: Term9 + 5 = 124 + 5 = 129\n\nWait, so term 10 is 129, which is greater than 125. Let me check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from term 1:\n\n1: 0\n\n2: 0 + 1 = 1\n\n3: 1 * 1 = 1\n\n4: 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5"

So term 10 is 129, which is the first term exceeding 125.\n</think>\n\nThe sequence starts at 0, with each subsequent term alternately added and multiplied by successive integers starting from 1. Calculating step-by-step:\n\n1. Term 1: 0\n2. Term 2: 0 + 1 = 1\n3. Term 3: 1 * 1 = 1\n4. Term 4: 1 + 2 = 3\n5. Term 5: 3 * 2 = 6\n6. Term 6: 6 + 3 = 9\n7. Term 7: 9 * 3 = 27\n8. Term 8: 27 + 4 = 31\n9. Term 9: 31 * 4 = 124\n10. Term 10: 124 + 5 = 129\n\nSo, the first term greater than 125 is 129.\n\n\\boxed{129}"
