Hmm, okay, let me write that down to make sure I got it right.\n\nSo, g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)\u00b2 - (x - 8)\u00b2]. Got it. First off, I remember that for a square root function to be defined, the expression inside the square root, which is called the radicand, has to be greater than or equal to zero. Otherwise, we'd be taking the square root of a negative number, which isn't a real number. So, my first step should be to set up an inequality to ensure that the radicand is non-negative.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n(x - 3)\u00b2 - (x - 8)\u00b2 \u2265 0.\n\nAlright, now I need to solve this inequality to find the domain of g(x). Once I have the domain, I can then figure out what the smallest real number x in that domain is.\n\nLooking at the expression (x - 3)\u00b2 - (x - 8)\u00b2, I notice that it's a difference of squares. I remember that a difference of squares can be factored using the identity a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). So maybe I can apply that here to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me let a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). So, substituting into the identity, it becomes:\n\n[(x - 3) - (x - 8)] * [(x - 3) + (x - 8)] \u2265 0.\n\nNow, let's simplify each part inside the brackets.\n\nFirst part: (x - 3) - (x - 8). Let's distribute the negative sign:\n\nx - 3 - x + 8. The x terms cancel out: x - x is 0, and -3 + 8 is 5. So that simplifies to 5.\n\nSecond part: (x - 3) + (x - 8). That's x - 3 + x - 8. Combine like terms: x + x is 2x, and -3 - 8 is -11. So"

            "output": " that simplifies to 2x - 11.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the inequality becomes:\n\n5 * (2x - 11) \u2265 0.\n\nHmm. So, 5 multiplied by (2x - 11) is greater than or equal to zero. Well, 5 is a positive number, so it doesn't affect the inequality's sign. That means we can divide both sides by 5 without changing the inequality:\n\n(2x - 11) \u2265 0.\n\nNow, solving for x:\n\n2x - 11 \u2265 0\n\nAdd 11 to both sides:\n\n2x \u2265 11\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx \u2265 11/2.\n\n11 over 2 is 5.5, so x has to be greater than or equal to 5.5.\n\nWait, so the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x where x is at least 5.5. Therefore, the smallest real number in the domain would be 5.5, right?\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, starting from g(x) = sqrt[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2], I set the inside expression to be \u2265 0.\n\nFactoring the difference of squares: [(x - 3) - (x - 8)] * [(x - 3) + (x - 8)].\n\nSimplifying each bracket:\n\nFirst: 5, as I did before.\n\nSecond: 2x - 11.\n\nSo, 5*(2x - 11) \u2265 0.\n\nSince 5 is positive, I can ignore it, leading to 2x - 11 \u2265 0, so x \u2265 11/2.\n\nYes, that's 5.5. So, the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5. Let me just verify by plugging in x = 5.5 into the original expression to ensure it's non-negative.\n\nCalculating (5.5 - 3)^2 - (5.5 - 8)^2:\n\nFirst, 5.5 - 3 is 2.5, squared is 6.25.\n\n5.5 - 8 is -2.5, squared is also 6.25.\n\nSo, 6.25 - 6.25 equals 0. That's"
