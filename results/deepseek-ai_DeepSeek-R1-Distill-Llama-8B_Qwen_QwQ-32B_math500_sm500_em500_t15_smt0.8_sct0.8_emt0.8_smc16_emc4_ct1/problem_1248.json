It wants to find the equivalent of the number 999 in base 10 when converted to base 6.\n\nI'll start by recalling how to convert a decimal number to another base. The process involves dividing the number by the target base and keeping track of the remainders.\n\nSo, I'll divide 999 by 6. The quotient is 166, and the remainder is 3. I'll write down this remainder.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6 again. This gives me a quotient of 27 and a remainder of 4. I'll add this remainder to my list.\n\nThen, I'll divide 27 by 6, resulting in a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3. I'll note this down as well.\n\nContinuing, I'll divide 4 by 6, which gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4. Since the quotient is now 0, I can stop the division process.\n\nNow, I'll assemble the remainders from last to first to get the base 6 equivalent. So, the remainders are 4, 3, and 3, making the final number 433 in base 6.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6**:\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder**: 3\n\n2. **Divide 166 by 6**:\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder**: 4\n\n3. **Divide 27 by 6**:\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder**: 3\n\n4. **Divide 4 by 6**:\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder**: 4\n\n5. **Read the remainders from bottom to top**:\n   \\[\n"
