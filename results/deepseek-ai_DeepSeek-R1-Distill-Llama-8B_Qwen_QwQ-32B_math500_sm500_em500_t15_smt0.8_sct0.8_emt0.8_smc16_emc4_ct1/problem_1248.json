Since 6^4 is larger than 999, I'll start by using 6^3, which is 216.\n\nNext, I divide 999 by 216 to find out how many times 216 fits into 999. This gives me 4 with a remainder. \n\nThen, I take the remainder and divide it by the next lower power of six, which is 36. This division yields 2 with no remainder.\n\nAfter that, I take the remaining 36 and divide it by 6, resulting in 6 with a remainder of 0. \n\nFinally, I divide the remainder by 1, which gives me 0. \n\nPutting it all together, the coefficients for each power of six are 4, 2, 6, and 0. Therefore, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 4600_6.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the largest power of 6 that fits into the number.**\n   \n   - \\(6^0 = 1\\)\n   - \\(6^1 = 6\\)\n   - \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n   - \\(6^3 = 216\\)\n   - \\(6^4 = 1296\\) \\\\\n   \n   Since \\(6^4 = 1296\\) is larger than 999, we'll use \\(6^3 = 216\\).\n\n2. **Divide the number by \\(6^3\\) and determine the coefficient for \\(6^3\\).**\n   \n   \\[\n   999 \\div 216 = 4 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 999 - (4 \\times 216) = 999 - 864 = 135\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide the remainder by \\(6^2\\) to find the coefficient for \\(6^2\\).**\n   \n   \\[\n   135 \\div 36 = 3 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of"
