By fixing one person, I reduce the number of variables and avoid overcounting due to rotations.\n\nNext, I'll arrange the remaining 7 people around the table. Since the table is square, the arrangement can be viewed as a circular permutation problem, which means I'll use the formula for circular permutations: (n-1)!.\n\nFinally, I'll account for reflections by considering whether the arrangement is mirror image equivalent. However, since the problem doesn't specify considering reflections as distinct, I won't include a factor for reflections unless it's explicitly required.\n\nAfter applying these steps, I'll calculate the total number of distinct seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix one person's position** to eliminate rotational symmetry. This reduces the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people.\n\n2. **Arrange the 7 people** around the table. Since the table is square, this is equivalent to arranging them in a circular permutation. The formula for circular permutations is:\n   \\[\n   (n - 1)! = (7 - 1)! = 6! = 720\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Consider reflections**. If arrangements that are mirror images of each other are considered the same, we would divide by 2. However, the problem does not specify that reflections should be considered identical, so we will not include this adjustment.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of distinct seating arrangements**:\n   \\[\n   6! = 720\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{720}\n\\]"
