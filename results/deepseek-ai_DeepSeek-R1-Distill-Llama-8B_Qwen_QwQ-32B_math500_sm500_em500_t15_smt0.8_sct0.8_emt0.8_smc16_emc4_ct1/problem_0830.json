            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, since ω³ = 1, ω is a cube root of unity. I remember that cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation ω³ - 1 = 0. That equation can be factored as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0, so the roots are 1, and the two non-real roots. Let me denote these roots as ω and ω². I think the non-real roots are complex conjugates of each other. \n\nSo, there are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². Each of these satisfies ω³ = 1, and 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That must be important. I also recall that for these roots, ω² is the complex conjugate of ω because they are non-real and conjugates are roots of the same polynomial.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I wonder if I can find a common denominator or use some properties of ω to simplify this.\n\nLet me try adding the two fractions. To add them, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²). The common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So, let's write S as:\n\nS = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nSimplifying the numerator: 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nBut wait, from the equation 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we know that ω + ω² = -1. So substituting that in, the numerator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo numerator is 1. Now, the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute that.\n\nExpanding the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*(1 + ω²) + ω*("

            "output": "1 + ω²) = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so this becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1. That's 2 + ω + ω² again. Using ω + ω² = -1, the denominator is 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is also 1. So S = 1/1 = 1.\n\nWait, but does this hold for all ω? Because ω can be any of the three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, or ω². Let me check each case.\n\nFirst, if ω = 1, then S = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, that matches.\n\nNow, if ω is the non-real cube root, let's denote it as ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2. Then ω² = e^(4πi/3) = cos(4π/3) + i sin(4π/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nLet's compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω: 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1 - 1/2 + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2. Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1 - 1/2 - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, 1 + ω = (1/2) + i(√3/2) = e^(πi/3), and 1 + ω² = (1/2) - i(√3/2) = e^(-πi/3). Therefore, 1/(1 + ω) = e^(-πi/3) and 1/(1 + ω²) = e^(πi/3). Adding them together: e^(-πi/3) + e^(πi/3) = 2 cos(π/3) = 2*(1/2"

            "output": ") = 1. So, that's consistent as well.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether ω is 1 or the non-real cube roots, the expression S equals 1.\n\nWait, but hold on. When ω = 1, we plug in and get 1. When ω is the non-real root, we still get 1. So, it seems that in all cases, S = 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another approach using algebraic manipulation without considering each case separately. Let me try that.\n\nWe have S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me combine them:\n\nS = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nAs before, numerator is 2 + ω + ω², which is 1 because ω + ω² = -1. Denominator is 1 + ω + ω + ω² + ω³. Wait, no, let me compute the denominator again.\n\nWait, expanding (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. But ω³ = 1, so this becomes 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω². And since ω + ω² = -1, this is 2 + (-1) = 1. So denominator is 1.\n\nHence, S = 1 / 1 = 1. So, regardless of ω, S is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nI don't see any other possible values because all cube roots of unity only give 1 as the result for S. So, 1 is the only possible value.\n</think>\n\nThe expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity ω.\n\n\\boxed{1}"
