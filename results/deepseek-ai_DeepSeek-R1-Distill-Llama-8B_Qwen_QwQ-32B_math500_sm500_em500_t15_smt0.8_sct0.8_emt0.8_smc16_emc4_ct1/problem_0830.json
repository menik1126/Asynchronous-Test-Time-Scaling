            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression (1)/(1 + ω) + (1)/(1 + ω²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, ω and ω² are the non-real cube roots. These roots satisfy certain properties, like the sum ω + ω² = -1 and ω² + ω³ = 0, but wait, actually, since ω³ = 1, ω³ = 1, so 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That's a key identity I remember.\n\nSo, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That might be useful. Let me write that down: 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Therefore, ω² = -1 - ω. Hmm, maybe I can substitute that in somewhere.\n\nLooking at the expression: 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me denote this sum as S. So, S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I need to compute S. Maybe I can find a common denominator or use some algebraic manipulation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of ω and use the known identities. Let me see. Maybe cross-multiplying or combining the fractions.\n\nLet me try to compute S. Let me write S as:\n\nS = [1/(1 + ω)] + [1/(1 + ω²)].\n\nTo combine these, I can write them over a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So,\n\nS = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ].\n\nSimplify the numerator: (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nAnd the denominator is (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute that.\n\nMultiplying out the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*(1 + ω²) + ω*(1 + ω"

            "output": "²) = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so this becomes 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nWait, that's the same as the numerator! So, S = [2 + ω + ω²] / [2 + ω + ω²].\n\nBut, the numerator and denominator are the same, so S = 1. Wait, so does that mean S is always 1? Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting from S = [2 + ω + ω²] / [2 + ω + ω²]. So, yes, if the numerator and denominator are equal, then S = 1.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Since 1 + ω + ω² = 0, then 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (ω + ω²) = 2 - 1 = 1. Because ω + ω² = -1. So, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 -1 = 1.\n\nTherefore, numerator is 1, denominator is 1. So S = 1/1 = 1. So regardless of ω, as long as ω³ =1, S is 1. So the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm supposed to find all possible values. So, since S is always 1, regardless of which cube root ω is, as long as it's not 1. So, for ω = e^(2πi/3) and ω = e^(4πi/3), which are the primitive cube roots, S = 1 in both cases.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nHmm, let me try plugging in specific numbers to verify. Let me take ω = -1/2 + i√3/2, which is one of the cube roots.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω). 1 + ω = 1 - 1/2 + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2. The reciprocal is (1/2 - i√3/2)/( (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/(1/4 + 3/4) = (1/2 -"

            "output": " i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²). Since ω² is the conjugate of ω, so 1 + ω² = 1 + conjugate(ω) = conjugate(1 + ω). Therefore, the reciprocal would be the conjugate of the reciprocal of 1 + ω. So, conjugate(1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nAdding them together: (1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1. So that works out.\n\nAlternatively, if I take ω = 1, but wait, ω³ =1, but the problem says \"a complex number such that ω³ =1\". So ω could be 1, but then the denominators would be 1 +1 =2, so let's see:\n\nIf ω =1, then the expression is 1/(1+1) +1/(1+1) = 1/2 +1/2 =1. So even when ω=1, it's still 1. Wait, so actually, even if ω is 1, the expression is 1. So all three cube roots give the same value?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values\", but in this case, no matter which cube root of 1 you take, the expression is always 1. So the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe that's the case. Let me check with ω =1 again. Let me compute each term:\n\n1/(1 +1) = 1/2, and 1/(1 +1²)=1/2. So 1/2 +1/2 =1. Yep. So even when ω is 1, it's still 1. So the expression is always 1, so the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"all possible values\", implying there might be more than one? Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when ω is 1, the denominators become "
