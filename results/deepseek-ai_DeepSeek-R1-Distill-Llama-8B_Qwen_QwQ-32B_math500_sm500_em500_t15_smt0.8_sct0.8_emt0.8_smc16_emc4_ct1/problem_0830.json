            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where \u03c9 is a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. I remember that cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \u03c9\u00b3 - 1 = 0. That equation can be factored as (\u03c9 - 1)(\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1) = 0, so the roots are 1, and the two non-real roots. Let me denote these roots as \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2. I think the non-real roots are complex conjugates of each other. \n\nSo, there are three cube roots of unity: 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2. Each of these satisfies \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, and 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0. That must be important. I also recall that for these roots, \u03c9\u00b2 is the complex conjugate of \u03c9 because they are non-real and conjugates are roots of the same polynomial.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). I wonder if I can find a common denominator or use some properties of \u03c9 to simplify this.\n\nLet me try adding the two fractions. To add them, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + \u03c9) and (1 + \u03c9\u00b2). The common denominator would be (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). So, let's write S as:\n\nS = [ (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) ] / [ (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplifying the numerator: 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 + \u03c9 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, from the equation 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 0, we know that \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. So substituting that in, the numerator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo numerator is 1. Now, the denominator is (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nExpanding the denominator: (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1*(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + \u03c9*("

Using \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1, the denominator is 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is also 1. So S = 1/1 = 1.\n\nWait, but does this hold for all \u03c9? Because \u03c9 can be any of the three cube roots of unity: 1, \u03c9, or \u03c9\u00b2. Let me check each case.\n\nFirst, if \u03c9 = 1, then S = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Okay, that matches.\n\nNow, if \u03c9 is the non-real cube root, let's denote it as \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) = cos(2\u03c0/3) + i sin(2\u03c0/3) = -1/2 + i\u221a3/2. Then \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = cos(4\u03c0/3) + i sin(4\u03c0/3) = -1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nLet's compute 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + \u03c9: 1 + (-1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1 - 1/2 + i\u221a3/2 = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2. Similarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 - 1/2 - i\u221a3/2 = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo, 1 + \u03c9 = (1/2) + i(\u221a3/2) = e^(\u03c0i/3), and 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = (1/2) - i(\u221a3/2) = e^(-\u03c0i/3). Therefore, 1/(1 + \u03c9) = e^(-\u03c0i/3) and 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = e^(\u03c0i/3). Adding them together: e^(-\u03c0i/3) + e^(\u03c0i/3) = 2 cos(\u03c0/3) = 2*(1/2"

            "output": ") = 1. So, that's consistent as well.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether \u03c9 is 1 or the non-real cube roots, the expression S equals 1.\n\nWait, but hold on. When \u03c9 = 1, we plug in and get 1. When \u03c9 is the non-real root, we still get 1. So, it seems that in all cases, S = 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another approach using algebraic manipulation without considering each case separately. Let me try that.\n\nWe have S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me combine them:\n\nS = [ (1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + (1 + \u03c9) ] / [ (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) ]\n\nAs before, numerator is 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2, which is 1 because \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Denominator is 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3. Wait, no, let me compute the denominator again.\n\nWait, expanding (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9\u00b3. But \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so this becomes 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2. And since \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1, this is 2 + (-1) = 1. So denominator is 1.\n\nHence, S = 1 / 1 = 1. So, regardless of \u03c9, S is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nI don't see any other possible values because all cube roots of unity only give 1 as the result for S. So, 1 is the only possible value.\n</think>\n\nThe expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity \u03c9.\n\n\\boxed{1}"
