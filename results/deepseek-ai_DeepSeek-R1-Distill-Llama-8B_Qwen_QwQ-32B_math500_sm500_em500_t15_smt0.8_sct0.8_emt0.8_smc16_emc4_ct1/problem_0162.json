            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve for the positive value of x where the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me write that down first to make sure I got it right.\n\nThe equation is: \u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16. I think that's right. So, cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Alright, my goal is to find the positive x that satisfies this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with roots, especially cube roots or square roots, it's often helpful to get rid of the root by raising both sides of the equation to the power that will eliminate it. Since this is a cube root, if I cube both sides, that should get rid of the cube root.\n\nLet me try that. So, if I cube both sides, that should give me:\n\n\u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4)\u00b3 = 16\u00b3.\n\nSimplifying the left side, the cube and the cube root should cancel each other out, leaving just (x\u00b2 - 4x + 4). On the right side, 16 cubed is... let me calculate that.\n\n16 cubed is 16 * 16 * 16. Hmm, 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Let me do 256 * 10 is 2560, and 256 * 6 is 1536. So, adding those together, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, the right side is 4096.\n\nSo, now my equation is x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nAlright, next step is to bring all terms to one side so I can solve the quadratic equation. I'll subtract 4096 from both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0.\n\nSimplifying the constants: 4 - 4096 is -4092. So, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Quadratic equations are of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, and I can use the quadratic formula if needed. But sometimes it's factorable, so maybe I can try that first.\n\nLooking"

            "output": " at the equation x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0, I need two numbers that multiply to -4092 and add up to -4. That seems a bit tricky. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's factor 4092 to see if I can find any factors. 4092 \u00f7 2 is 2046. 2046 \u00f7 2 is 1023. 1023 is divisible by 3 because 1+0+2+3=6, which is divisible by 3. 1023 \u00f7 3 is 341. 341, let me check if it's prime or can be factored further. 341 \u00f7 11 is 31, because 11*31 is 341. So, the prime factors of 4092 are 2\u00b2, 3, and 11, 31.\n\nSo, the factors of 4092 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 22, 31, 33, 62, 44, etc. Wait, maybe I can find two numbers that multiply to 4092 and subtract to get 4, since I need them to add to -4.\n\nWait, since the product is negative, one has to be positive and the other negative. Also, their difference should be 4 because the middle term is -4x. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use the quadratic formula here. Let me recall the formula: x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a).\n\nIn this case, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. So, plugging those in:\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 \u221a( (-4)\u00b2 - 4 * 1 * (-4092) )] / (2 * 1).\n\nCalculating the discriminant first: (-4)\u00b2 is 16, and then -4 * 1 * (-4092) is +16368. So, the discriminant is 16 + 16368, which is 16384.\n\nHmm, 16384. I wonder what the square root of that is. I know that 128\u00b2 is 16384 because 128*128 is (130 - 2)*(130 - 2) which is 130"

Adding 12800 + 8192 gives 210, so maybe I should double-check.\n\nWait, actually, 128 * 100 is 12800, and 128 * 128 is 16384. Yes, because 128 * 128: 128*100=12800, 128*28=3584, adding together 12800 + 3584 is 16384. So, sqrt(16384) is 128.\n\nSo, the square root is 128. So, putting that back into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 128] / 2.\n\nSo, two solutions: one where I add 4 and 128, and one where I subtract.\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66.\n\nSecond solution: (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62.\n\nSo, the two solutions are x = 66 and x = -62. But the problem asks for the positive value, so x = 66 is the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, maybe I should plug 66 back into the original equation and see if it works.\n\nOriginal equation: \u221b(x\u00b2 -4x +4) =16.\n\nLet's compute x\u00b2 -4x +4 when x=66.\n\nx\u00b2 is 66*66. Let me compute that. 60*60=3600, 60*6=360, 6*60=360, 6*6=36. So, (60+6)*(60+6) = 60\u00b2 + 2*60*6 +6\u00b2 = 3600 + 720 + 36 = 4356.\n\nThen, -4x is -4*66, which is -264.\n\nSo, adding them up: 4356 -264 +4.\n\n4356 -264: Let's compute 4356 - 200 = 4156, then subtract 64: 4156 -64 = 4092. Then add 4: 4092 +4 = 4096.\n\nSo, the cube root of 4096. Wait, earlier I"

Let me compute x\u00b2 -4x +4 when x=-62.\n\nx\u00b2 is (-62)\u00b2, which is 3844.\n\n-4x is -4*(-62)= +248.\n\nSo, 3844 + 248 +4 = 3844 +252= 4096.\n\nSo, cube root of 4096 is 16. So, x=-62 also satisfies the equation. But since the problem asks for the positive value, 66 is the answer.\n\nSo, I think I did everything correctly. I started by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root, simplified, got the quadratic equation, solved it using quadratic formula because the numbers were too big to factor easily, checked the discriminant, found that one root was positive and the other negative, and then verified both solutions in the original equation to make sure they work. So, I'm confident that the positive solution is 66.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16, we start by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n\n\u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4)\u00b3 = 16\u00b3  \nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\nNext, we rearrange the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0  \nx\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find the roots. The discriminant is calculated as:\n\n(-4)\u00b2 - 4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384  \n\u221a16384 = 128\n\nSubstituting back, we get:\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 128]/2  \nx = 66 or x = -62\n\nSince we need the positive value, x = 66 is the solution.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{66}"
