            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x² - 4x + 4) equals 16. I need to find the positive value of x that satisfies this. Hmm, let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that cube roots can be tricky, but I think the key here is to get rid of the cube root to make the equation easier to handle. So, how do I do that? Well, if the cube root of something is 16, then that something must be 16 cubed, right? Because if you cube the result, you get back the original number.\n\nSo, rewriting the equation without the cube root, I can say that x² - 4x + 4 equals 16 cubed. Let me write that down: x² - 4x + 4 = 16³. Now, I need to calculate 16³. I think 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16 is... let me do that multiplication. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, 16³ is 4096. Got that.\n\nSo now my equation is x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. Hmm, this looks like a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations are in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, so maybe I should rearrange this equation to match that standard form.\n\nSubtracting 4096 from both sides to set it equal to zero, I get: x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Calculating 4 - 4096 gives me -4092. So the equation simplifies to x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. \n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. To solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula, which is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of (b squared minus 4ac) all divided by 2a. In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092.\n\nLet me plug these values into the quadratic formula. So, x equals negative (-4)"

            "output": " plus or minus the square root of ((-4)² - 4*1*(-4092)) all over 2*1. Simplifying that, negative (-4) is 4. The discriminant inside the square root is (-4) squared, which is 16, minus 4 times 1 times (-4092). Wait, that's 16 + 4*4092 because subtracting a negative is adding. So, 4*4092. Let me calculate that.\n\n4 times 4000 is 16,000 and 4 times 92 is 368. So, total is 16,000 + 368 = 16,368. So, the discriminant is 16 + 16,368, which is 16,384. Hmm, 16,384. That looks like a power of 2. Let me check: 2^10 is 1024, 2^14 is 16,384. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the square root of 16,384 is 128 because 128 times 128 is 16,384. So now, plugging back into the quadratic formula, we have x equals (4 plus or minus 128) divided by 2.\n\nSo, two possible solutions: (4 + 128)/2 and (4 - 128)/2. Let's compute both.\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128) is 132. Divided by 2 is 66. Second solution: (4 - 128) is -124. Divided by 2 is -62. So, the two solutions are x = 66 and x = -62.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the positive value of x, so x = 66 is the solution we need.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the original equation: cube root of (x² -4x +4) = 16. If x =66, plug it in: 66² is 4356. 4*66 is 264. So, 4356 - 264 +4 is 4356 - 264 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096. The cube root of 4096. Let me see, 16³ is 4096, so cube root of 4096 is indeed 16. So, that works"

So cube root of 4096 is 16, which works too. So both solutions are correct.\n\nBut since the question asks for the positive value, 66 is the answer.
