The subsequent terms are generated by alternately **adding** and **multiplying** by each successive integer starting from **1**. Let's break down the sequence step by step to find the first term greater than **125**.\n\n1. **First Term:**\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Term:**\n   - Apply **addition** with the first integer (1):\n   \\[\n   a_2 = a_1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Term:**\n   - Apply **multiplication** with the first integer (1):\n   \\[\n   a_3 = a_2 \\times 1 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth Term:**\n   - Apply **addition** with the second integer (2):\n   \\"
