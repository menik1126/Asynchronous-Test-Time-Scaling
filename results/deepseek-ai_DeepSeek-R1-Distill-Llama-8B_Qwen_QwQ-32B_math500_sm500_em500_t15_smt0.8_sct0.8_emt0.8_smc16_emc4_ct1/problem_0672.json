Since \\( y \\) must be at least 5, this implies that \\( \\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5 \\).\n\nSolving the inequality \\( \\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5 \\) leads to \\( x \\leq \\frac{54}{5} \\), which is \\( x \\leq 10.8 \\). Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, the maximum possible value for \\( x \\) is 10.\n\nAdditionally, \\( x \\) must be at least 2. Therefore, the range of possible values for \\( x \\) is from 2 to 10.\n\nFinally, to find the number of possible values of \\( x \\), I count the integers in this range. The values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, which totals 9 possible values.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\), let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Total number of cards: \\( 54 \\)\n   - Number of players: \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n   - Cards per player: \\( y \\geq 5 \\)\n   - Relationship: \\( x \\times y = 54 \\)\n\n2. **Express \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\):**\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{54}{x}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( y \\geq 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x \\leq \\frac{54}{5} = 10.8\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Determine the Integer Values of \\( x \\):**\n   - \\( x \\) must be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a player.\n   - \\( x \\) is at least \\( 2 \\) and at most \\( 10 \\) (since \\( 10"
