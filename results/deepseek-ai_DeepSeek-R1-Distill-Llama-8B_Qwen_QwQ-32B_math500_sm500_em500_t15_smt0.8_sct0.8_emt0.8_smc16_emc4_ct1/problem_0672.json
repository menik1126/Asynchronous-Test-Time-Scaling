For \\( x = 2 \\), each player gets \\( 5 \\) cards, so \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) cards. For \\( x = 10 \\), each player gets \\( 5 \\) cards, so \\( 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\) cards.\n\nI'll list each possible value of \\( x \\) from 2 to 10 and verify that the total number of cards, 54, can be divided among the players with each receiving at least 5 cards. \n\nAfter checking all values, I'll count the valid values of \\( x \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Total number of cards: 54\n   - Each player must receive at least 5 cards (\\( y \\geq 5 \\)).\n   - Number of players (\\( x \\)) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Determine the Range for \\( x \\):**\n   - Since each player must receive **at least** 5 cards:\n     \\[\n     x \\leq \\frac{54}{5} \\implies x \\leq 10.8\n     \\]\n     Since \\( x \\) must be an integer, \\( x \\) can be at most 10.\n   - The minimum value for \\( x \\) is 2 (as given).\n\n   **Possible Values for \\( x \\):** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n\n3. **Verify Each \\( x \\) Can Distribute 54 Cards:**\n   - For each \\( x \\), check if it's possible to distribute 54 cards with each player getting at least 5 cards.\n\n   | \\( x \\) | Minimum Cards per Player (\\( y = 5 \\))"
