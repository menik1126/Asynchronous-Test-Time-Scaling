            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem to simplify (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)). Hmm, I remember that when you have a fraction with a radical in the denominator, you often rationalize the denominator. That means getting rid of the square root in the denominator. Let me think about how to do that.\n\nSo, the expression is (1 + sqrt(2))/(2 + sqrt(3)). I know that to rationalize the denominator, I need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of (2 + sqrt(3)) is (2 - sqrt(3)). That way, when we multiply the denominator by its conjugate, we get a difference of squares, which will eliminate the square root.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (2 - sqrt(3)):\n\n[(1 + sqrt(2)) * (2 - sqrt(3))] / [(2 + sqrt(3)) * (2 - sqrt(3))]\n\nOkay, now let me compute the denominator first because that might be easier. The denominator is a difference of squares, so it's (2)^2 - (sqrt(3))^2, which is 4 - 3, right? So that simplifies to 1. Nice, so the denominator becomes 1.\n\nNow the numerator is (1 + sqrt(2))*(2 - sqrt(3)). I'll have to expand this. Let me do it step by step:\n\n1 * 2 = 2\n\n1 * (-sqrt(3)) = -sqrt(3)\n\nsqrt(2) * 2 = 2 sqrt(2)\n\nsqrt(2) * (-sqrt(3)) = -sqrt(6)\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator becomes:\n\n2 - sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(6)\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n(2 - sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(6)) / 1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2 + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(3) - sqrt(6)\n\nHmm, the problem mentions expressing it in the form A(1 + sqrt(B)) - (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)). Let me see how to rearrange the terms to match that.\n\nLooking at my current form:\n\n2 + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(3) - sqrt(6"

            "output": ")\n\nI notice that the terms can be grouped as follows:\n\n(2 sqrt(2)) + 2 - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6))\n\nWait, but the desired form is A(1 + sqrt(B)) - (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)).\n\nSo maybe I can factor out a 2 from the sqrt(2) term and combine the constants. Let me try:\n\n2 + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) = 2(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6))\n\nYes! That works. So that's in the form A(1 + sqrt(B)) - (sqrt(C) + sqrt(D)).\n\nLet me check each part:\n\nA is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6.\n\nSo A = 2, B = 2, C = 3, D = 6.\n\nAdding them up: 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps because 13 seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nStarting again, numerator after rationalizing:\n\n(1 + sqrt(2))(2 - sqrt(3)) = 1*2 + 1*(-sqrt(3)) + sqrt(2)*2 + sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(3)) = 2 - sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(6). So that's correct.\n\nThen the denominator is 1, so the expression is 2 - sqrt(3) + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(6).\n\nGrouped as 2 + 2 sqrt(2) - sqrt(3) - sqrt(6) = 2(1 + sqrt(2)) - (sqrt(3) + sqrt(6)). Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo A is 2, B is 2, C is 3, D is 6. Their sum is 2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\):\n\n\\"
