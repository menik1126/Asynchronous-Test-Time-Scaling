I need to find the sum of all complex solutions. That makes me think about Vieta's formula because usually, for polynomial equations, Vieta gives the sum of roots. But wait, this isn't a polynomial equation yet because of the denominators. So maybe I need to manipulate it into a polynomial form.\n\nLet me think. If I can eliminate the denominators by multiplying both sides by the product of all the denominators, I might get a polynomial equation. That sounds like a plan. But the denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). So the product would be \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). That seems like a lot, but perhaps manageable.\n\nFirst, let me denote the left side as a single fraction. The denominators are \\(x^2 -1\\), \\(x^2 -2\\), \\(x^2 -3\\), \\(x^2 -4\\). So the common denominator would be the product of all four denominators. But that's a degree 8 polynomial. Multiplying through by that would lead to a degree 8 equation, which is quite high. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor each denominator:\n\n- \\(x^2 -1 = (x -1)(x +1)\\)\n- \\(x^2 -2\\) doesn't factor nicely over integers\n- \\(x^2 -3\\) same issue\n- \\(x^2 -4 = (x -2)(x +2)\\)\n\nSo, factors are (x -1), (x +1), (x -2), (x +2), and then the irreducible quadratics for 2 and 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I don't need to deal with all denominators"

Since y = x², that substitution might complicate things because the RHS remains in x. So maybe that's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider rearranging terms.

Maybe multiply through by all denominators to clear them. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the denominators as D1 = x² -1, D2 = x² -2, D3 =x² -3, D4 =x² -4. So the product D = D1 D2 D3 D4.\n\nMultiply both sides by D:\n\nLeft side becomes:\n\n1*(D/D1) + 2*(D/D2) + 3*(D/D3) +4*(D/D4) -2010x D +4 D =0.\n\nWait, actually, expanding that:\n\nMultiplying each term in the original equation by D:\n\nThe first term, 1/(x²-1) multiplied by D gives D/(x²-1) = D/D1 * D1?

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the equation is a rational function equals a linear function. The left side is a sum of terms each of which is a hyperbola-like function, so maybe the equation can be transformed into a polynomial equation of high degree, but perhaps the sum of roots can be found without solving it?\n\nWait, Vieta's formula applies to polynomial equations. If I can write the equation as a polynomial equation, then the sum of all roots (counting multiplicity) would be the negative coefficient of the second-highest degree term divided by the leading coefficient. But since the problem says \"complex solutions\", so all roots in the complex plane, so Vieta's formula would apply here.\n\nTherefore, perhaps even without solving the equation, if I can find the leading term and the next term, I can compute the sum.\n\nBut to do that, I need to know the polynomial equation. Let me try to see the degree.\n\nThe left-hand side, when multiplied by D (the product of denominators), gives a sum of terms each of which is a product of three denominators (since each term is D/Di, which is product of the other three denominators). Each denominator is quadratic, so each term in the left side after multiplying would be (quadratic)^3, so degree 6. So each term is degree 6, so the left side after multiplying is a sum of four degree 6 terms, so the left side is a degree 6 polynomial. The right side is (2010x -4) multiplied by D, which is (linear)*(quadratic)^4, so that's linear * degree 8, so degree 9. Therefore, moving everything to the left, the equation becomes a degree 9 polynomial. Wait, so the equation after multiplying both sides by D would be:\n\nLeft side (degree 6) minus right side (degree 9) equals zero, so the equation is degree 9. Therefore, the polynomial"

As I mentioned before, D/Di is D without the factor Di.\n\nEach of these D/Di is (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) / (x^2 -k) = (product over j≠i (x^2 -k_j)). So each term is a product of three quadratics, so each term is degree 6.\n\nTherefore, the left side is a sum of four terms, each degree 6, so the left side is a degree 6 polynomial.\n\nThe right side is (2010x -4)*D, which is (2010x -4)*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4).

Let me denote each quadratic as (x^2 -k_i), so D = product_{i=1}^4 (x^2 -k_i), where k_i are 1,2,3,4.\n\nExpanding D, the leading term is x^8, and the next term is the sum of the coefficients from each (x^2 -k_i) term.
