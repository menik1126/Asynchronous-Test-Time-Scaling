This looks like a rational equation with multiple terms on the left side and a linear term on the right. My goal is to find all complex solutions \\( x \\) that satisfy this equation and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, I should consider the structure of the equation. The left side consists of four fractions, each with a quadratic denominator. The right side is a linear equation in \\( x \\). To solve for \\( x \\), I might need to manipulate the equation to eliminate the denominators or find a substitution that simplifies things.\n\nLet me write down the equation again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nI notice that each denominator is of the form \\( x^2 - k \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant. Maybe I can make a substitution here. Let me let \\( y = x^2 \\). Then each denominator becomes \\( y - k \\).\n\nSo substituting \\( y = x^2 \\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nWait, but \\( x \\) is still in the equation on the right side. So if \\( y = x^2 \\), then \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{y} \\). Hmm, that might complicate things. Maybe this substitution isn't the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire left-hand side as a function of \\( x^2 \\). Let's denote \\( z = x^2 \\). Then the left side becomes:\n\n\\[\nf(z) = \\frac{1}{z - "

So maybe I can find a relationship between \\( z \\) and \\( x \\) here.\n\nWait, but this still might not be straightforward. Another approach could be to consider the equation as a function and try to analyze its behavior. Perhaps plotting or considering the behavior of both sides might give insights, but since it's a problem-solving scenario, maybe I should proceed algebraically.\n\nAnother thought: since the left-hand side is a sum of reciprocals of quadratics, maybe it's possible to combine them into a single rational function. Let's try to compute the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{z - 1} + \\frac{2}{z - 2} + \\frac{3}{z - 3} + \\frac{4}{z - 4}.\n\\]\n\nTo combine these, I'll need a common denominator, which would be the product of all denominators: \\( (z - 1)(z - 2)(z - 3)(z - 4) \\). But that would result in a very lengthy expression, and I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function \\( f(z) \\) and look for its roots or analyze its behavior. Alternatively, since the left-hand side has poles at \\( z = 1, 2, 3, 4 \\), maybe I can write the equation as:\n\n\\[\nf(z) = 2010x -4.\n\\]\n\nBut again, \\( z = x^2 \\) complicates things since \\( z \\) is a function of \\( x \\).\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the equation as \\( f(z) - (2010x -4) = 0 \\), and then analyze for possible solutions.

That might lead to a higher-degree equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the equation as a function of \\( x \\), and then find the sum of roots using Vieta's formula. But for that, I need to express the equation as a polynomial equation, and then the sum of roots would be the negative coefficient of the second-highest degree term divided by the leading coefficient. However, the problem is that the equation is not a polynomial equation yet because of the denominators. So perhaps I need to multiply both sides by the denominators to clear the fractions, but that would lead to a very high-degree polynomial.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me denote the left-hand side as LHS and the right-hand side as RHS. So:\n\nLHS = RHS\n\nMultiply both sides by the common denominator, which is \\( (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) \\).

Let me see if there's a smarter way here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the equation is of the form:\n\nSum_{k=1}^4 [k/(x^2 -k)] = 2010x -4\n\nLet me denote each term as T_k = k/(x^2 -k).

Then, the equation becomes:\n\n1/(t - 1) + 2/(t - 2) + 3/(t - 3) + 4/(t - 4) = 2010x -4.\n\nBut t = x^2, so x = \u00b1sqrt(t).

Let me see:\n\nSuppose I let y = x^2, then the left-hand side is a function of y, but the right-hand side is a function of x. So unless there's a relation between y and x, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if x is a solution, then -x might also be a solution? Let me check.\n\nSuppose x is a solution, then substituting -x into the equation:\n\nLeft-hand side becomes:\n\n1/( (-x)^2 -1 ) + 2/( (-x)^2 -2 ) + 3/( (-x)^2 -3 ) + 4/( (-x)^2 -4 ) = same as original left-hand side, since x^2 is the same.\n\nThe right-hand side becomes 2010*(-x) -4 = -2010x -4.\n\nSo unless the left-hand side equals both 2010x -4 and -2010x -4, which would require 2010x -4 = -2010x -4, leading to 4020x =0, so x=0. But plugging x=0 into the original equation:\n\nLeft-hand side: 1/(0 -1) + 2/(0 -2) + 3/(0 -3) +4/(0 -4) = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -4.\n\nRight-hand side: 2010*0 -4 = -4. So x=0 is a solution. But that's the only solution where x and -x would both be solutions only if x=0. So except for x=0, the solutions might not come in pairs. Therefore, the equation is not symmetric in x and -x except at x=0. So maybe the sum of all solutions can be found by Vieta's formula once we have the polynomial equation, but since the equation is not symmetric, the sum might not be zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be manipulated to a polynomial equation in x, and then"
