            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify into a simplified fraction. The expression is the square root of a big fraction divided by the square root of 5. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the original expression to visualize it better:\n\n√[( (5 / √80) + (√845 / 9) + √45 ) / √5]\n\nAlright, so the numerator inside the square root has three terms: 5 divided by the square root of 80, the square root of 845 divided by 9, and the square root of 45. Then all of that is divided by the square root of 5, and then we take the square root of the whole thing.\n\nI think the key here is to simplify each term in the numerator first before dealing with the denominator and the square root. Let me tackle each term one by one.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5 divided by the square root of 80. I remember that it's often helpful to rationalize the denominator or to simplify the radical. So, let me see if I can factor 80 into something that's a perfect square times another number. 80 can be broken down into 16 and 5 because 16*5=80, and 16 is a perfect square. So, √80 = √(16*5) = √16 * √5 = 4√5. So, 5 / √80 becomes 5 / (4√5). Hmm, can I simplify that further? Yes, because 5 divided by √5 is the same as √5 times √5 divided by √5, which simplifies to √5. So, 5 / (4√5) = (5 / √5) / 4 = √5 / 4. Wait, let me check that again. Actually, √5 times √5 is 5, so 5 / √5 is √5. Therefore, 5 / (4√5) = √5 / 4. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNext term: √845 divided by 9. Let me see if I can simplify √845. 845 is a larger number, so I need to factor it. Let's try dividing by small primes first. 845 ÷ 5 = 169. And 169 is 13 squared, so √845 = √(5"

            "output": "*169) = √5 * √169 = √5 *13 = 13√5. So, √845 / 9 is (13√5) / 9.\n\nThird term: √45. I can break that down too. 45 is 9*5, so √45 = √(9*5) = √9 * √5 = 3√5.\n\nSo now, let me rewrite the numerator in the big fraction with these simplified terms:\n\nNumerator = (5 / √80) + (√845 / 9) + √45 = (√5 / 4) + (13√5 / 9) + 3√5.\n\nHmm, okay, so all terms have √5 in them. That means I can factor that out. Let's see:\n\nNumerator = √5 (1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nWait a second, hold on. 3√5 is the same as 3*√5, right? So, 3√5 can be written as √5*3, which is the same as √5*(3/1). So yes, the numerator becomes √5 times the sum of (1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nLet me compute the sum inside the parentheses: 1/4 + 13/9 + 3.\n\nTo add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 is 3/1). The least common multiple of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. So, let me convert each term to 36ths.\n\n1/4 = 9/36,\n13/9 = 52/36,\n3 = 108/36.\n\nSo adding them together: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = 169/36.\n\nSo, the numerator is √5 * (169/36) = (169√5)/36.\n\nNow, the entire expression is the square root of this numerator divided by √5. So, let's write that:\n\n√[ (169√5 / 36) / √5 ]\n\nHmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let's simplify it step by step.\n\nFirst, divide (169√5 / 36) by √5. So, (169"

So, now we have √(169 / 36).\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me make sure. Because the expression is √[ (169√5 / 36) / √5 ].\n\nSo, inside the square root, we have a fraction: (169√5 /36) divided by √5. So, (169√5 /36) / √5 = (169√5) / (36√5). Since √5 is in numerator and denominator, they cancel each other out. So we have 169 / 36. Then, we take the square root of that.\n\nSo, √(169 / 36). The square root of 169 is 13, and the square root of 36 is 6. So, √(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nHmm, so that would mean the entire expression simplifies to 13/6.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst term: 5 / √80. √80 is 4√5, so 5/(4√5). Multiply numerator and denominator by √5: (5√5)/(4*5)= √5/4. That looks correct.\n\nSecond term: √845. 845=5*169=5*13², so √845=13√5. Divided by 9: 13√5/9. Correct.\n\nThird term: √45=√(9*5)=3√5. Correct.\n\nSo, numerator becomes √5/4 +13√5/9 +3√5.\n\nFactor out √5: √5*(1/4 +13/9 +3).\n\nCalculating the sum inside: convert to 36 denominator.\n\n1/4=9/36, 13/9=52/36, 3=108/36. Adding:9+52=61, 61+108=169. So 169/36. So numerator is √5*(169/36)=169√5/36. Correct.\n\nThen,"
