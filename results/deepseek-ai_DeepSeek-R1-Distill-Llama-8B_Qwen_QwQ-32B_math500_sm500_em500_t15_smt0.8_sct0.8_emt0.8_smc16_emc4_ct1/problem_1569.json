            "output": "Alright, so I have this expression to simplify: the square root of a fraction, where the numerator is (5 over root80 plus root845 over 9 plus root45), all divided by root5. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the expression inside the square root. The main structure is a fraction, so I have numerator terms added together and then divided by another term. The entire thing is under a square root. Let me write it down to visualize better:\n\n√[(5/√80 + √845/9 + √45) / √5]\n\nOkay, so the expression is a fraction where the numerator is the sum of three terms, and the denominator is √5. My goal is to simplify this so that it's a single simplified fraction inside the square root. Then, I can perhaps take the square root of that fraction.\n\nLet me tackle each term in the numerator one by one.\n\nStarting with the first term: 5/√80. Hmm, I remember that having a square root in the denominator is often not preferred, so maybe I should rationalize the denominator here. To do that, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by √80. So, 5 times √80 divided by (√80 times √80). Wait, that's 5√80 / 80. But √80 can be simplified. Since 80 is 16 times 5, and √16 is 4, so √80 is 4√5. So substituting back, it becomes 5*(4√5) / 80. Let me compute that: 20√5 / 80. Simplifying that fraction, both 20 and 80 are divisible by 20, so it reduces to √5 / 4. Got it, so the first term simplifies to √5 / 4.\n\nMoving on to the second term: √845 / 9. Let's see if I can simplify √845. 845 is a larger number, so I need to factor it into a product of a perfect square and another number. Let's divide 845 by 5 first, which gives 845 / 5 = 169. Ah, 169 is 13 squared, so √845 is √(5*169) which is √5 * √169, which is 13√5. So substituting back, the second term"

            "output": " is 13√5 / 9. That's simpler.\n\nThird term: √45. Let's simplify that. 45 is 9*5, so √45 is √9*√5 = 3√5. So the third term is 3√5.\n\nSo now, substituting all three terms back into the numerator:\n\nFirst term: √5 / 4\n\nSecond term: 13√5 / 9\n\nThird term: 3√5\n\nSo adding them all together. Since they all have √5, maybe I can factor that out. Let me see:\n\n√5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Let me compute the coefficients inside the parentheses.\n\nFirst, let's convert all terms to fractions with a common denominator. The denominators here are 4, 9, and 1 (since 3 is 3/1). The least common denominator (LCD) of 4, 9, and 1 is 36. Let me convert each term:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n13/9 = (13*4)/36 = 52/36\n\n3 = 3/1 = 108/36\n\nAdding them together: 9/36 + 52/36 + 108/36 = (9 + 52 + 108)/36 = (169)/36\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 9 + 52 is 61, and 61 + 108 is 169. Yes, so total is 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator simplifies to √5*(169/36). So the entire numerator of the big fraction is (169/36)√5.\n\nNow, the entire expression inside the square root is [ (169/36)√5 ] divided by √5. Let me write that as:\n\n(169/36)√5 / √5\n\nSince √5 divided by √5 is 1, right? So that simplifies to 169/36. Wait, really?\n\nWait, let me confirm. The numerator is (169/36"

            "output": ")√5 and the denominator is √5. So when I divide them, √5 / √5 is 1, so 169/36 * (√5 / √5) is 169/36 * 1, which is indeed 169/36.\n\nSo now, the expression is √(169/36). The square root of a fraction is the square root of the numerator divided by the square root of the denominator. So √169 is 13, and √36 is 6. Therefore, it becomes 13/6.\n\nHmm, so after all that simplifying, the entire expression reduces to 13/6.\n\nWait, let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Simplify each term in the numerator:\n   - 5/√80 became √5 / 4\n   - √845 became 13√5, so 13√5 /9\n   - √45 became 3√5\n\n2. Added all the terms:\n   - √5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3)\n   - Converted to common denominator 36:\n     - 1/4 = 9/36\n     - 13/9 = 52/36\n     - 3 = 108/36\n   - Sum: 169/36, so total numerator inside the big fraction is (169/36)√5\n\n3. Divided by √5: (169/36)√5 / √5 = 169/36\n\n4. Took square root: √(169/36) = 13/6\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final simplified fraction is 13/6.\n\nI don't see any errors in the steps. Let me just go through each part again.\n\nFirst term: 5/√80\n- Rationalize: 5√80 /80\n- √80=4√5, so 5*4√5=20√5\n- 20√5/80=√5/4. Correct.\n\nSecond term: √845\n- 845=5*169=5*13²\n- √845=13√5\n- So √845/9=13√5/9. Correct.\n\nThird term: √45\n- 45=9*5\n- √45=3√5. Correct.\n\nAdding them all:\n√5/4 +13√"
