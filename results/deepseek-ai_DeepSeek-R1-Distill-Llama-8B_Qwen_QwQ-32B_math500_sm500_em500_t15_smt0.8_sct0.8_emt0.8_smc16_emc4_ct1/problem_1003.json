            "output": "First, I recognize that all the decimals are repeating, which means they can be expressed as fractions.\n\nStarting with 0.7 repeating, I recall that 0.7 is equal to 7/10. To find the fractional representation of 0.77 repeating, I multiply 0.77 by 10, subtract the original 0.77, and solve for the repeating part. This gives me 77/99.\n\nNext, for 0.4 repeating, I set it equal to x. Multiplying both sides by 10 gives 4x = 4. Subtracting the original equation from this new equation, I solve for x, which equals 4/99.\n\nThen, for 0.2 repeating, I follow the same process. Setting x = 0.22... and multiplying by 10, I subtract to find that x = 22/99.\n\nNow, I have all the decimals expressed as fractions:\n77/99, 4/99, and 22/99.\n\nAdding these together, I combine the numerators over the common denominator: 77 + 4 + 22 = 103. So, the sum is 103/99.\n\nFinally, I simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. Therefore, the final answer is 103/99.\n\nBut wait, upon reviewing, I realize that 103 and 99 have no common divisors other than 1. So, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nHowever, the problem asks to express the answer as a common fraction. Since 103/99 cannot be simplified further, it is already in the required form.\n\nI double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy and confirm that the answer is indeed 103/99.\n</think>\n\nLet's compute \\( 0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} + 0.\\overline{2} \\) step by step.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0.\\overline{7} &= \\frac{7}{9} \\\\\n0.\\overline{4} &= \\frac{4}{9} \\\\\n0.\\overline{2} &= \\frac{2}{9} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute these fractions back into the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{9} - \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{2}{"
