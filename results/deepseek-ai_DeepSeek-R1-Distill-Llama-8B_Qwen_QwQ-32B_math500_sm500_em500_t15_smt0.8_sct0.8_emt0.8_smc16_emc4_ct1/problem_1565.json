This eliminates rotational duplicates since rotations of the same arrangement are considered equivalent.\n- **Arrange the remaining 7 people:** After fixing one person's position, the other 7 can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways.\n\n### Step 2: Account for Reflectional Symmetry\n- **Square reflection:** A square table can be reflected, leading to mirror images that are distinct if not accounted for.\n- **Double the arrangements:** Since each unique arrangement can be mirrored, multiply the result by 2.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\\[\n\\text{Total arrangements} = 2 \\times 7! = 2 \\times 5040 = 10080\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10080}\n\\]"
