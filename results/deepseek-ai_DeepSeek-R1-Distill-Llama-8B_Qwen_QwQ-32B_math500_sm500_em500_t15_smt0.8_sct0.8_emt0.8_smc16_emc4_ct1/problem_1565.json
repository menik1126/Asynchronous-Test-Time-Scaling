Since rotations of the configuration are considered equivalent, I'll fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\nFirst, I'll fix one person at a specific seat to avoid counting rotations as different arrangements. With one person fixed, there are 7 remaining people to seat. \n\nNext, I'll consider the arrangement of these 7 people. Since the table is square, the seats are in a circular arrangement, so the number of ways to arrange 7 people in a circle is (7-1)! which equals 720.\n\nHowever, there's a division by 2 because the seating can be mirrored, meaning the arrangement and its mirror image are equivalent. Therefore, I'll divide the total arrangements by 2, resulting in 360 distinct seating arrangements.\n\nFinally, I'll add back the fixed person, which doesn't change the count, so the total number of distinct ways is 360.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways 8 people can be seated around a square table with 2 people on each side, where rotations of the configuration are considered equivalent, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix one person's position**:  \n   By fixing one person's seat, we eliminate the rotational symmetry of the square table. This means we're only arranging the remaining 7 people relative to the fixed position.\n\n2. **Arrange the remaining 7 people around the table**:  \n   Since the table is circular (but square), the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) people around a circular table is \\( (n-1)! \\). In this case, \\( n = 7 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   (7-1)! = 6! = 720\n   \\]\n\n3. **Account for reflection symmetry**:  \n   The square table can be reflected (i.e., mirrored), meaning that arrangements that are mirror images of each other are considered identical. To account for this, divide the total number of arrangements by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{720}{2} = 360\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consider the fixed person**:  \n   Since we fixed one person's position, we don't need to account for any additional rotations or reflections because all equivalent configurations under rotation have already been eliminated by fixing a position.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{360}"
