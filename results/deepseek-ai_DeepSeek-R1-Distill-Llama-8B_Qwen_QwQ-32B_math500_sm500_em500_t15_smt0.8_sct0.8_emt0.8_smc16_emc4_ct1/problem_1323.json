I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the rectangle mentally. Let’s assume ABCD is a rectangle where AB is the length and AD is the width. Since the center is O, that would be the intersection point of the diagonals. So, O is equidistant from all sides in a square, but since it's a rectangle, the distances from O to the sides are different based on the sides' lengths.\n\nGiven that AB/AD = k, so if I let AD = x, then AB = kx. Therefore, the rectangle isn't necessarily a square, it's stretched more along one direction.\n\nNow, the problem is about probability. So, the probability that a point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices is equal to the area where all points are closer to O than to the vertices, divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, I need to find the region within the rectangle where the distance from any point (x, y) to O is less than the distance to each of the four vertices.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let me place O at (0, 0). Then, since the rectangle has center O, the vertices can be determined based on AB and AD. Let's say the length AB is along the x-axis and AD is along the y-axis.\n\nWait, no, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if AB is the length, then AD is the width. So, in my coordinate system, points A, B, C, D would be located at (-AB/2, AD/2), (AB/2, AD/2), (AB/2, -AD/2), and (-AB/2, -AD/2). Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nWait, no, actually, if AB is the length from A to B, then AB = 2*(AB/2), right? So, if I set the rectangle from (-AB/2, -AD/2) to (AB/2, AD/2). So, point A is (-AB/2, AD/2), B is (AB/2, AD/"

Then AB would be 2ka, so half of AB would be ka. Therefore, coordinates would be:\n\nA: (-ka, a)\n\nB: (ka, a)\n\nC: (ka, -a)\n\nD: (-ka, -a)\n\nO is (0,0). So, the rectangle extends from x = -ka to x = +ka, and y from -a to +a.\n\nTherefore, the total area of the rectangle is (2ka)*(2a) = 4ka².\n\nNow, the problem is to find the region of points closer to O than to any of the four vertices. So, for a given point (x,y), we need:\n\ndistance to O < distance to A,\n\ndistance to O < distance to B,\n\ndistance to O < distance to C,\n\ndistance to O < distance to D,\n\nall four conditions must hold.\n\nAlternatively, since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe the regions closer to each vertex form a partition of the rectangle, and the region closer to O is the intersection of all regions closer to O than each vertex. But perhaps it's the Voronoi region around O within the rectangle? I think that's the case.\n\nVoronoi regions divide the plane into regions where each region consists of points closer to one vertex than to the others. But here, we have four vertices and the center. Wait, actually, the problem states \"closer to O than to any of the four vertices.\" So, it's the set of points where their distance to O is less than their distance to each vertex. So this region would be the intersection of the regions closer to O than to A, closer to O than to B, closer to O than to C, and closer to O than to D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the region closer to O than all vertices is the set of points where O is the nearest vertex in terms of distance, but O itself is not a vertex, but the center. Wait, O isn't a vertex, but a point in the center. So, we need to compare distances from the point to O versus each vertex and ensure"
