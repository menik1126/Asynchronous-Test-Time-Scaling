            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. I need to find \\( P(5) \\). Let me try to unpack the given information and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). That means I can express \\( P(x) \\) as:\n\\[ P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \\]\nwhere \\( Q_1(x) \\) is the quotient polynomial when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). So, another expression for \\( P(x) \\) would be:\n\\[ P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\]\nwhere \\( Q_2(x) \\) is the quotient polynomial for this division.\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( P(x) \\), I can set them equal to each other:\n\\[ (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\]\n\nHmm, but maybe a better approach is to use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) divided by a linear divisor \\( (x - a) \\) is \\( P(a) \\). But here, we're dealing with quadratic divisors, so the remainder should be a linear polynomial \\( R(x) \\). That is, \\( R(x) = ax + b \\) for some constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nGiven that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), I can plug \\( x = 0 \\) into the first expression:\n\\[ P(0) = (0 - 1)(0 - 4)Q_1(0) + R(0) \\]\n\\[ 5 = (-1)(-4)"
