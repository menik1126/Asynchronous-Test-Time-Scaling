            "output": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit nervous because it's about polynomials and remainders, but I think I can figure it out. So, the problem is:\n\nWe have a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So, \\( P(x) \\) looks like \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants we need to find.\n\nThe problem states two things about the remainders when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by certain quadratic polynomials:\n\n1. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\).\n2. When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\).\n\nWe are also given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\). We need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nAlright, let me try to make sense of this.\n\nFirst, since \\( P(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, when it's divided by a quadratic polynomial like \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) will be of degree less than 2, so it's a linear polynomial. Therefore, \\( R(x) = mx + n \\) for some constants \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\), which would also be linear, so \\( 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n \\).\n\nSo, \\( R(x) \\) is a linear polynomial, and both remainders can be expressed in terms of \\( R(x) \\). Now, let's think about how to relate these remainders to the original polynomial \\( P(x) \\).\n\nI remember that the Remainder Theorem says that the remainder when a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - a) \\) is \\( P(a) \\). But here, we're dividing by quadratic polynomials, so it's a bit more involved"

I think the generalized Remainder Theorem says that if we divide by a polynomial \\( D(x) \\), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) is such that \\( P(x) = Q(x)D(x) + R(x) \\) for some quotient polynomial \\( Q(x) \\). So, for our case, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), we can write:\n\n\\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \\)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\):\n\n\\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\)\n\nHere, \\( Q_1(x) \\) and \\( Q_2(x) \\) are the quotient polynomials, which are of degree 1 because \\( P(x) \\) is degree 3 and we're dividing by degree 2.\n\nSince both division expressions equal \\( P(x) \\), maybe we can set them equal to each other? Wait, but they might not be directly equal unless we have specific conditions. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \\( R(x) \\) as the remainder in both cases, perhaps we can relate \\( R(x) \\) by evaluating \\( P(x) \\) at specific points. Let me think: If \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), then \\( R(1) = P(1) \\) and \\( R(4) = P(4) \\) because those points are roots of the divisor polynomial.\n\nSimilarly, when the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\), then \\( 2R(2) = P(2) \\) and \\( 2R(3) = P(3) \\) because those are the roots of the other divisor.\n\nSo, let's note down the equations we can get from this:\n\n1. \\( R(1) = P(1) \\)\n2. \\( R(4) = P(4) \\)\n3. \\( 2R(2) = P(2) \\)\n4. \\( 2R(3) = P(3) \\"
