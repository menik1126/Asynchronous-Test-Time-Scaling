Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the domain of a function includes all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. Since g(x) is a square root function, the expression inside the square root must be greater than or equal to zero. So, I should start by setting up the inequality:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0\n\nAlright, now I need to solve this inequality to find the domain of g(x) and then identify the smallest real number in that domain.\n\nTo simplify the expression inside the square root, I can expand both squared terms and then subtract them. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (x - 3)^2:\n\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\n\nNext, expand (x - 8)^2:\n\n(x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64\n\nNow, subtract the second expanded expression from the first:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) ≥ 0\n\nLet me distribute the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 ≥ 0\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. The x^2 terms cancel out:\n\nx^2 - x^2 = 0\n\nNow, combining the x terms:\n\n-6x + 16x = 10x\n\nAnd the constant terms:\n\n9 - 64 = -55\n\nSo, the inequality simplifies to:\n\n10x - 55 ≥ 0\n\nTo solve for x, I can isolate it on one side. Let's add 55 to both sides:\n\n10x - 55 + 55 ≥ 0 + 55\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10x ≥ 55\n\nNow, divide both sides by 10:\n\nx ≥ 55/10\n\n55 divided by 10 is 5.5, so:\n\nx ≥ 5.5\n\nTherefore, the domain of the function g(x) is all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to"

            "output": " 5.5.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest real number x in the domain. Since x must be at least 5.5, the smallest such x is 5.5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting with expanding both squares:\n\n(x-3)^2 is x² -6x +9, that's correct. (x-8)^2 is x² -16x +64, that also seems right. Subtracting the two, I get (x² -6x +9) - (x² -16x +64) which is x² -6x +9 -x² +16x -64. The x² terms do cancel out, leaving 10x -55. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 10x -55 ≥ 0 leads to x ≥ 55/10, which is 5.5. So, the smallest x in the domain is indeed 5.5. There's no need to consider negative numbers or fractions less than 5.5 because the inequality is strictly greater than or equal to, and 5.5 is the boundary point.\n\nHmm, just to be thorough, let me test x=5.5 in the original expression to ensure it's non-negative.\n\nCompute (5.5 -3)^2 - (5.5 -8)^2:\n\nFirst term: (2.5)^2 = 6.25\n\nSecond term: (-2.5)^2 = 6.25\n\nSubtracting: 6.25 - 6.25 = 0\n\nSo, at x=5.5, the expression inside the square root is zero, which is acceptable because the square root of zero is defined.\n\nWhat happens if I pick a number less than 5.5, say x=5?\n\nCompute (5-3)^2 - (5-8)^2:\n\n(2)^2 - (-3)^2 = 4 - 9 = -5, which is negative. So, the square root of a negative number isn't real, hence x=5 is not in the domain.\n\nTherefore, the smallest x value in the domain is indeed 5.5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of the function \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2"
