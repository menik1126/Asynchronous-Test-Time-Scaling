I remember that when looking for integer roots, the Rational Root Theorem is really useful. It says that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms \\(p/q\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at the given equation, the leading coefficient is 1 for \\(x^4\\) and the constant term is -14. So, the possible values for \\(p\\) are the factors of -14, which are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. Since \\(q\\) is 1, the possible integer roots are just these values: ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14.\n\nAlright, so I can test these candidates one by one by plugging them into the equation to see if they make the polynomial equal to zero. Let me start with the smaller numbers to save time.\n\nFirst, let me test \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1 + 5) + (9 - 1) - 14 = 6 + 8 - 14 = 14 - 14 = 0\\).\n\nOh, that worked! So, \\(x = 1\\) is an integer root.\n\nNext, let me try \\(x = -1\\):\n\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14\\).\n\nCalculating that: 1 - 5 is -4, +9 is 5, +1 is 6, -14 is -8. So, it's -8, not zero. So, \\(x = -1\\) is not a root.\n\nHow about \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 -"

So, \\(x = 2\\) isn't a root.\n\nTesting \\(x = -2\\):\n\n\\((-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) - 14 = 16 - 40 + 36 + 2 - 14\\).\n\nCalculating: 16 - 40 is -24, +36 is 12, +2 is 14, -14 is 0. Oh, that's zero! So, \\(x = -2\\) is another integer root.\n\nAlright, so far, I have roots at \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\). That means I can factor the polynomial by dividing it by \\((x - 1)\\) and \\((x + 2)\\).\n\nBefore I proceed, let me check \\(x = 7\\):\n\n\\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14\\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n\\(7^4 = 2401\\)\n\n\\(5*7^3 = 5*343 = 1715\\)\n\n\\(9*49 = 441\\)\n\nSo, adding up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116, +441 = 4557, -7 = 4550, -14 = 4536. That's way too big, definitely not zero.\n\nWhat about \\(x = -7\\):\n\n\\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) - 14 = 2401 - 1715 + 441 +7 -14\\).\n\nCalculating step by step: 2401 - 1715 = 686, +441 = 1127, +7 = 1134, -14 = 1120. Not zero.\n\nTesting \\(x = 14\\):\n\nThat would be a huge number, but let me see:\n\n\\(14^4 = 14*14*14*14 = 196*196 = 38416\\)\n\n\\(5*14^3 = 5*2744 = 13720\\)\n\n\\(9*14^2 = 9*196"

Wait no, maybe I should write it down:\n\n38416 + 13720 = 52136.\n\n52136 + 1764 = 538, no. 52136 + 1764: 52136 + 1000 is 53136, then +764: 53136 + 700=53836, +64=53900. So, 53900.\n\nThen subtract 14 and 14: 53900 - 14 is 53886, -14 is 53872. Definitely not zero.\n\nSimilarly, \\(x = -14\\):\n\n\\((-14)^4 is 14^4 = 38416\\)\n\n5*(-14)^3 = 5*(-2744) = -13720\n\n9*(-14)^2 = 9*196 = 1764\n\nSo, the polynomial evaluates to:\n\n38416 - 13720 + 1764 +14 -14\n\nCalculate step by step: 38416 -13720 = 24696; 24696 +1764=26460; +14=26474; -14=26460. Not zero.\n\nSo, \\(x = 14\\) and \\(x = -14\\) are definitely not roots.\n\nSo, the only potential integer roots are 1, -2, and maybe others? Wait, did I test all possible ones? Let's double-check. The factors of 14 are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. So, yes, I think I've tested all.\n\nWait, but I only found 1 and -2 as roots. Hmm, so maybe the polynomial can be factored into (x - 1)(x + 2)(quadratic). But let me try to perform polynomial division.\n\nFirst, divide the original polynomial by (x - 1) to get a cubic polynomial, then divide that by (x + 2) to get a quadratic. Then, I can factor the quadratic or use the quadratic formula to find the remaining roots, but since we are only looking for integer roots, maybe the quadratic doesn't have integer roots.\n\nBut let me see.\n\nSo, starting with the original polynomial:\n\n\\(x^"

Let's use synthetic division.\n\nSet up coefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nUsing x = 1 as the root, so we write 1 | 1  5   9   -1   -14\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 1: 1, add to next coefficient: 5 +1 =6.\n\nMultiply 6 by 1:6, add to next coefficient:9 +6=15.\n\nMultiply 15 by1:15, add to next coefficient: -1 +15=14.\n\nMultiply 14 by1:14, add to last term: -14 +14=0. Perfect, so the result is:\n\nx^3 +6x^2 +15x +14.\n\nSo, after dividing by (x -1), we have (x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, let's divide this cubic polynomial by (x +2), since we found that x = -2 is a root.\n\nAgain, synthetic division. Let's use x = -2.\n\nCoefficients of cubic: 1 (x^3), 6 (x^2),15 (x),14 (constant).\n\nSet up: -2 | 1   6    15    14\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2.

Perfect.\n\nSo, the cubic factors into (x +2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nTherefore, the original polynomial factors as (x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, the quadratic factor is \\(x^2 +4x +7\\). Let's check if this has integer roots. The discriminant is \\(16 - 2"

            "output": "*1*7 =16 -14=2\\). Since the discriminant is 2, which is not a perfect square, the roots are irrational: \\(\\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{2}}{2}\\), which are -2 ± (√2)/2. These are irrational, so there are no integer roots from this quadratic.\n\nTherefore, the only integer roots are x = 1 and x = -2.\n\nI think that's all. Let me just recap: by using the Rational Root Theorem, I tested possible integer roots, found that 1 and -2 worked. Then, I factored the polynomial step by step, reducing it down until I got a quadratic without integer roots. So, the integer roots are only 1 and -2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe integer roots are \\boxed{1} and \\boxed{-2}.\n</think>\n\nTo find all the integer roots of the polynomial equation \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\), we use the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-14) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1), which gives us the candidates ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14.\n\nTesting these candidates:\n\n- For \\(x = 1\\):\n  \\[\n  1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0\n  \\]\n  So, \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n\n- For \\(x = -2\\):\n  \\[\n  (-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) - 14 = 16 - 40 + 36 + 2 - 14 = 0\n  \\]\n  So, \\(x = -2\\) is a root.\n\nNext, we factor the polynomial by dividing it by \\((x - 1)\\) and \\((x + 2)\\) using synthetic division:\n\n1. Divide the original polynomial by \\((x - 1)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{r|rrrrr}\n   1 & 1 & 5 & 9 & -1 & -14 \\\\\n     &  "
