            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I'm supposed to find all the integer roots. Hmm, integer roots... That probably means I should try plugging in some integer values for x and see if the equation holds true. But since it's a fourth-degree polynomial, there could be up to four roots, right? But maybe not all of them are integers. So, I guess I need to find all integer x such that when I plug them into the equation, it equals zero.\n\nFirst, I remember something called the Rational Root Theorem. Isn't that the theorem that helps find possible rational roots of a polynomial equation? If I recall correctly, the possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots should be factors of -14, which are ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. That makes sense because if the equation had a rational root, it would have to be one of these numbers.\n\nAlright, so I can start by testing these possible integer roots one by one. Let me list them: x = 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14. I'll go through each of these and see if plugging them into the equation results in zero.\n\nStarting with x = 1:\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14\\)\nCalculating step by step:\n1 + 5 is 6,\n6 + 9 is 15,\n15 - 1 is 14,\n14 - 14 is 0.\nOh, wow, x=1 is a root! So, that's one integer root down.\n\nNext, let's try x = -1:\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14\\)\nCalculating each term:\n(-1)^4 is 1,\n5*(-1)^3 is -5,\n9*(-1)^2 is 9,\n-(-1) is +1,\nand then -14.\n"

Since we already found two integer roots, perhaps we can factor the polynomial using these and find the other roots?\n\nLet's try polynomial division. Since x=1 and x=-2 are roots, that means (x-1) and (x+2) are factors.\n\nSo let's try to factor the polynomial.\n\nFirst, we can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nLet me try synthetic division with x=1.\n\nThe coefficients are 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nSo set up synthetic division:\n\n1 | 1   5   9   -1   -14\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 1: 1, add to next coefficient: 5 +1=6.\n\nMultiply 6 by 1=6, add to next coefficient: 9+6=15.\n\nMultiply 15 by1=15, add to -1: -1 +15=14.\n\nMultiply 14 by1=14, add to -14: -14 +14=0.\n\nSo the result is 1   6   15   14   0.\n\nSo the polynomial can be factored as (x-1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic polynomial: x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14.\n\nAgain, let's try possible integer roots. The possible roots are factors of 14: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nWe already have x=-2 as a root, so let's test x=-2 again.\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n-2 | 1   6   15   14\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2= -2. Add to 6: 6-2=4.\n\nMultiply 4 by -2= -8. Add to 15: 15-8=7.\n\nMultiply 7 by -2= -14. Add to 14: 14-14=0.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (x + 2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nTherefore, the original polynomial factors as (x-1)(x+2)(x^2 +4x"

For the equation \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\), the possible integer roots are factors of the constant term (−14) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1).
