This diameter corresponds to the space diagonal of the cube. The space diagonal of a cube can be calculated using the formula \\( s\\sqrt{3} \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length of the cube.\n\nSetting \\( s\\sqrt{3} = 6 \\) and solving for \\( s \\), I find that \\( s = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\) inches.\n\nOnce I have the side length of the cube, I can calculate its volume using the formula \\( s^3 \\). Substituting the value of \\( s \\), the volume of the cube is \\( (2\\sqrt{3})^3 = 8 \\times 3\\sqrt{3} = 24\\sqrt{3} \\) cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cube is \\( 24\\sqrt{3} \\) cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the cube from which a steel sphere is made by removing metal from its corners, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between the Sphere and Cube:**\n   - The sphere has a **3-inch radius**, so its **diameter** is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) inches.\n   - This diameter corresponds to the **space diagonal** of the cube.\n\n2. **Calculate the Space Diagonal of the Cube:**\n   - The space diagonal (\\( d \\)) of a cube with side length (\\( s \\)) is given by:\n     \\[\n     d = s\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n   - Set the space diagonal equal to the sphere's diameter:\n     \\[\n     s\\sqrt{3} = 6\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{3} \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**\n   - The volume (\\( V \\)) of the cube is \\( s^3 \\):\n     \\[\n     V = (2\\sqrt{3"
