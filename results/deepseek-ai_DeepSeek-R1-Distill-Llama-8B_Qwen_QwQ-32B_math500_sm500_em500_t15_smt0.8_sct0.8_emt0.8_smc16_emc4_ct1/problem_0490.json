            "output": "First, I need to determine the original cube's dimensions. The sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is 6 inches. To accommodate this diameter, the cube must have a side length of at least 6 inches to fully contain the sphere.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the cube. The formula for the volume of a cube is side length cubed. If the side length is 6 inches, then the cube's volume is 6 inches \u00d7 6 inches \u00d7 6 inches, which equals 216 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, I'll subtract the volume of the sphere from the cube to find out how much metal is removed. The volume of the sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is 3 inches. Plugging in the value, the sphere's volume is (4/3)\u03c0(3)\u00b3 = 36\u03c0 cubic inches. Subtracting this from the cube's volume, 216 - 36\u03c0 cubic inches, gives the volume of the remaining part of the cube, which is the steel sphere.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube before the metal was removed, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Given Information\n- **Radius of the Steel Sphere**: 3 inches\n- **Shape Before Metal Removal**: A cube with the shortest possible side lengths\n- **Final Shape**: A sphere with the given radius formed by removing metal from the cube\n\n### Step 2: Find the Relationship Between the Cube and the Sphere\n- The sphere must fit within the cube. The smallest cube that can contain the sphere has a side length equal to the diameter of the sphere.\n- **Diameter of the Sphere**: \\( 2 \\times \\text{Radius} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) inches\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Volume of the Cube\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a cube is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cube}} = s^3\n\\]\nwhere \\( s \\) is the side length of the cube.\n\nSubstituting \\( s = 6 \\) inches:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{cube}} = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Calculation\n- **Volume Calculation**:\n\\[\n6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216\n\\]\n"
