My goal is to find the value of \\(x\\) that makes this equation true.\n\nI'll start by calculating \\(2^3\\). \n\n\\(2^3\\) equals 8.\n\nNow, substitute this back into the equation:\n\n\\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8.\n\nSo, dividing both sides by 8 gives:\n\n\\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\).\n\nSimplifying that, \\(72\\) divided by \\(8\\) is \\(9\\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nNow, I need to determine what exponent \\(x\\) makes 3 equal to 9. I know that \\(3^2 = 9\\), because \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(x\\) must be 2.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's solve the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\) step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate \\(2^3\\)**\n\\[\n2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute back into the equation**\n\\[\n8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Isolate \\(3^x\\)**\n\\[\n3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Determine the exponent \\(x\\)**\nWe know that \\(3^2 = 9\\). Therefore,\n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
