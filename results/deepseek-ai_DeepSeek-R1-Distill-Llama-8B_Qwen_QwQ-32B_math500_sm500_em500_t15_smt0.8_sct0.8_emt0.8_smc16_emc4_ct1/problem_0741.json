This simplifies the equation to \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This gives me \\(3^x = 72 / 8\\), which simplifies to \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nSince \\(9\\) is equal to \\(3^2\\), the equation now is \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nFinally, I'll set the exponents equal to each other because the bases are the same. Therefore, \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify \\( 2^3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   So the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate \\( 3^x \\):**\n   Divide both sides of the equation by 8:\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   3^x = 3^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set the exponents equal:**\n   Since the bases are the same and the equation holds true, the exponents must be equal:\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
