Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet and each letter must be different, I can calculate the number of ways to choose the first letter and then multiply it by the number of ways to choose the second letter.\n\nFor the first letter, there are 26 possible choices. Once the first letter is chosen, there are 25 remaining letters for the second position. Therefore, the total number of two-letter combinations is 26 multiplied by 25.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the number of possible two-digit combinations. Each digit can range from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible choices for each digit. However, since the digits must be different, the first digit has 10 choices and the second digit has 9 remaining choices. This results in 10 multiplied by 9 possible two-digit combinations.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I multiply the number of two-letter combinations by the number of two-digit combinations. This gives the total number of possible license plates.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates that can be formed, we'll break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Two different letters (A-Z) followed by**\n2. **Two different one-digit numbers (0-9)**\n\n**Step 1: Calculating the number of possible letter combinations**\n\nThere are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z). Since each letter must be different, the number of ways to choose the first letter is 26. After choosing the first letter, there are 25 letters left for the second position.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of letter combinations} = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculating the number of possible digit combinations**\n\nThere are 10 possible digits (0-9). Similar to the letters, each digit must be different.\n\n- For the first digit: 10 choices\n- For the second digit: 9 choices (since one digit has already been used)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of digit combinations} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the total number of license plates**\n\nSince each letter combination can be paired with each digit combination, multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of license plates} ="
