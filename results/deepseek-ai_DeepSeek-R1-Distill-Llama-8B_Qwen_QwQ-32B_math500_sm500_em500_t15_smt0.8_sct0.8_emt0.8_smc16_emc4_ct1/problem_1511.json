Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and each of the two positions must be different, I'll calculate the number of permutations of 26 letters taken 2 at a time.\n\nNext, I'll consider the number part of the license plate. There are 10 possible numbers (0 through 9), and each of the two number positions must also be different. I'll calculate the number of permutations of 10 numbers taken 2 at a time.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of possible number combinations to get the total number of unique license plates.\n\nSo, the total number of license plates is the product of the permutations for the letters and the numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Number of Possible Letter Combinations\n- **Total letters available:** 26 (A through Z)\n- **Condition:** Each license plate must have **2 different letters**.\n  \nThe number of ways to choose and arrange **2 different letters** out of **26** is given by the permutation formula:\n  \n\\[\nP(26, 2) = 26 \\times 25\n\\]\n  \n\\[\nP(26, 2) = 650 \\text{ possible letter combinations}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Possible Number Combinations\n- **Total digits available:** 10 (0 through 9)\n- **Condition:** Each license plate must have **2 different digits**.\n  \nThe number of ways to choose and arrange **2 different digits** out of **10** is given by the permutation formula:\n  \n\\[\nP(10, 2) = 10 \\times 9\n\\]\n  \n\\[\nP(10, 2) = 90 \\text{ possible number combinations}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of License Plates\nSince the letter and number combinations are independent, we multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of possible number combinations:\n  \n\\[\nTotal\\ license\\ plates = 650 \\times 90\n\\]\n  \n\\[\nTotal\\ license\\ plates = 58,\\!500\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of possible license plates is:\n  \n\\[\n\\boxed{58,\\!500"
