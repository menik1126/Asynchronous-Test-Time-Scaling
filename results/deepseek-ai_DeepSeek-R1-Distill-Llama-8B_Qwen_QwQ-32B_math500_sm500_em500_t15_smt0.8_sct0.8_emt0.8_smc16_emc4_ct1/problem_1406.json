Then, I need to evaluate the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^{1997}}.\n\\]\n\nFirst off, I know that \u03c9 satisfying \u03c9^1997 = 1 means that \u03c9 is a 1997th root of unity, but it's not equal to 1. So, \u03c9 is a primitive 1997th root of unity. That gives me some properties to work with, like the fact that \u03c9^1997 = 1 and that the order of \u03c9 is 1997.\n\nNow, the sum I need to evaluate is a series of terms from k = 1 to k = 1997 of 1/(1 + \u03c9^k). So, it's the sum over all the non-trivial 1997th roots of unity of 1/(1 + \u03c9^k). Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nI remember that for roots of unity, there are some useful identities and techniques that can help evaluate sums like these. Maybe I can use some symmetry or properties of these roots to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me think about the expression 1/(1 + \u03c9^k). Maybe I can manipulate this term somehow. One trick I remember is that sometimes, multiplying numerator and denominator by something can help. Let's try multiplying numerator and denominator by 1 - \u03c9^k. Let's see what happens:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} \\times \\frac{1 - \\omega^k}{1 - \\omega^k} = \\frac{1 - \\omega^k}{(1 + \\omega^k)(1 - \\omega^k)}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the denominator, which is a difference of squares:\n\n\\[\n(1 + \\omega^k)(1 - \\omega^k) = 1 - (\\omega^k)^2 = 1 - \\omega^{2k}.\n\\]\n\nSo, the term becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - \\omega^k}{1 - \\omega^{2k}}.\n\\]\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps immediately."

Therefore, the exponents cycle every 1997. Also, roots of unity have the property that 1 + \u03c9 + \u03c9^2 + ... + \u03c9^{1996} = 0.\n\nThat seems useful. Let me write that down:\n\n\\[\n1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 + \\dots + \\omega^{1996} = 0.\n\\]\n\nThat might be helpful later.\n\nNow, let's think about the sum I'm supposed to compute:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^{1997} \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k}.\n\\]\n\nBut since \u03c9^1997 = 1, each term is 1/(1 + \u03c9^k) where k goes from 1 to 1996, and then \u03c9^1997 is just \u03c9^0 = 1. So, actually, the last term is 1/(1 + 1) which is 1/2.\n\nSo, S can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{k=1}^{1996} \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} + \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, if I can compute the sum from k=1 to 1996 of 1/(1 + \u03c9^k), then adding 1/2 will give me the total S.\n\nSo, let me focus on the sum:\n\n\\[\nT = \\sum_{k=1}^{1996} \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k}.\n\\]\n\nNow, maybe I can pair each term with another one. Since the roots come in pairs: for each k, there's a corresponding 1997 - k. Let me test that idea.\n\nCompute the sum for k and 1997 - k:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^{1997 - k}}.\n\\]\n\nBut since \u03c9^{1997} = 1, so \u03c9^{1997 - k} = \u03c9^{-k}. Therefore, the sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^k} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^{-k"

So, each pair sums to 1. Therefore, if I pair each term k with term 1997 - k, each pair contributes 1 to the sum T.\n\nNow, how many such pairs are there?\n\nSince we're going from k = 1 to 1996, which is an even number of terms (1996 terms). So, the number of pairs is 1996 / 2 = 998 pairs. Each pair sums to 1, so the total T would be 998 * 1 = 998.\n\nTherefore, T = 998.\n\nThen, going back to S, which is T + 1/2 = 998 + 1/2 = 998.5, which is 1997/2.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 1996 terms divided by 2 gives 998 pairs, so T = 998. Then adding the last term, which is 1/(1 + \u03c9^{1997}) = 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2. So total S = 998 + 1/2 = 998.5. But 998.5 is equal to 1997/2, since 1997 divided by 2 is 998.5. So, S = 1997/2.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me confirm that the pairing works for all terms. Let me check with a small example. Let's take a smaller case where n is an odd prime, say n = 3. Let me see if the same logic applies.\n\nSuppose n = 3, so \u03c9^3 ="

But \u03c9^3 = 1, so 1/(1 + \u03c9^3) = 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2.\n\nSo, S = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^2) + 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, n = 3, so T = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^2).\n\nCompute T:\n\nSimilarly, pair k=1 and k=2.\n\n1/(1 + \u03c9) + 1/(1 + \u03c9^{-1}) = 1/(1 + \u03c9) + \u03c9/(1 + \u03c9) = 1.\n\nSo, T = 1, then S = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2, which is n/2.\n\nSimilarly, in n=3 case, S= 3/2.\n\nSo, in our original problem, 1997 is prime, so the same logic applies, and S = 1997/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1997 over 2, or 1997/2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n is prime here. In the original problem, n is 1997, which is prime. But does the pairing still work if n is composite? Hmm, in this problem, n is prime, so the pairing is perfect, each k and 1997 -k are distinct for k from 1 to 1996. But if n is composite, some exponents may coincide, so pairing might not work as nicely. But in this case, n is prime, so 1997 is prime, so each exponent from 1 to 1996 pairs with a unique 1997 - k, so each pair is unique and contributes 1 to T.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, S = 1997/2.\n\nHence, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1997}{2}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1997}{2}}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\(\\omega^{1997} = 1\\) and \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\), we"
