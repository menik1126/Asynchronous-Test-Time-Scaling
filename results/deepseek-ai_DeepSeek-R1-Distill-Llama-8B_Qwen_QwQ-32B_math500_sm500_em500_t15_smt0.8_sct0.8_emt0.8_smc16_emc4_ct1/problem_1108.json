The problem states that \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), which means \\( y \\) is proportional to \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} \\). This relationship can be expressed as \\( y = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}} \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven that when \\( x = 24 \\), \\( y = 15 \\), I can substitute these values into the equation to find \\( k \\). Plugging in the numbers gives me \\( 15 = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{24}} \\). To solve for \\( k \\), I first calculate \\( \\sqrt{24} \\), which is approximately 4.899. This means \\( 15 = \\frac{k}{4.899} \\), so multiplying both sides by 4.899 yields \\( k = 15 \\times 4.899 \\approx 73.485 \\).\n\nNow that I have the value of \\( k \\), I can use the inverse relationship to find \\( x \\) when \\( y = 3 \\). Substituting \\( y = 3 \\) into the equation \\( y = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}} \\) gives \\( 3 = \\frac{73.485}{\\sqrt{x}} \\). To solve for \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), I multiply both sides by \\( \\sqrt{x} \\) and divide by \\( 3 \\), resulting in \\( \\sqrt{x} = \\frac{73.485}{3} \\approx 24.495 \\).\n\nFinally, to find \\( x \\), I square both sides of the equation, so \\( x = (\\frac{73.485}{3})^2 \\approx (24.495)^2 \\approx 597.24 \\). \n\nAfter performing these calculations, I conclude that the value of \\( x \\) when \\( y = 3 \\) is approximately 597.24.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the relationship between \\( y \\) and \\( x \\):**\n   \n   The problem states that \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\).
