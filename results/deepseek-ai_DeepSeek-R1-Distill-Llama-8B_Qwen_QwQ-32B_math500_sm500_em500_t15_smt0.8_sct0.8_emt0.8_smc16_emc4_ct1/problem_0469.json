They satisfy the following equations:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the equations involve symmetric expressions of x, y, and z. Maybe I can use some symmetric polynomial identities or relationships. I remember that in symmetric equations, sometimes it's useful to consider the elementary symmetric sums. Let's denote:\n\n- \\( p = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( q = xy + yz + zx \\)\n- \\( r = xyz = 4 \\) (from the first equation)\n\nI think that if I can find p, q, and maybe another relation, I can find q, which is exactly what I'm looking for.\n\nNow, I recall that the sum of cubes can be expressed in terms of p, q, and r. The identity is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\)\n\nSo, plugging in the values we have:\n\n\\( 4 = p^3 - 3pq + 3r \\)\n\nBut we know r is 4, so substituting that in:\n\n\\( 4 = p^3 - 3pq + 3(4) \\)\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( 4 = p^3 - 3pq + 12 \\)\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\( p^3 - 3pq = 4 - 12 \\)\n\\( p^3 - 3pq = -8 \\)\nI'll keep that as equation (1) for now.\n\nNext, let's look at the third equation:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I"

Let's group terms with similar variables:\n\n- Terms with x: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z \\)\n- Terms with y: \\( yz^2 + y^2 z \\)\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\( x(y^2 + x y + z^2 + x z) + y(z^2 + y z) \\)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor by grouping in a different way.\n\nWait, another approach: notice that the expression resembles the sum of all possible monomials of degree 3 where two variables are multiplied, and the third is squared. Maybe there's a way to express this in terms of symmetric sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that this is \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y)(y + z)(x + z) - (x + y + z)(xyz) \\). Let me check if that's true.\n\nWait, let me compute \\( (x + y)(y + z)(x + z) \\):\n\nFirst, \\( (x + y)(y + z) = y^2 + y z + x y + x z \\)\nThen multiplying by (x + z):\n\n= (y^2 + y z + x y + x z)(x + z)\n= y^2 x + y^2 z + y z x + y z^2 + x y x + x y z + x z x + x z^2\n= x y^2 + x y z + x^2 y + y z^2 + x^2 z + x y z + x^2 z + x z^2\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n= x y^2 + x^2 y + y z^2 + y^2 z + x^2 z + x z^2 + 2x y z\n\nSo, \\( (x + y)(y + z)(x + z) = x y^2 + x^2 y + y z^2 +"
