Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, I remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric equations like these, especially with three variables, it might be helpful to use symmetric sums or maybe even think about substitutions. Let me recall some identities that might be useful here.\n\nFirst, the sum of cubes can be expressed using the formula:\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) + 3xyz \\)\n\nWe know that \\( xyz = 4 \\) and \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\), so plugging those into the formula gives:\n\\( 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) + 3 \\times 4 \\)\nSimplifying:\n\\( 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) + 12 \\)\nSubtracting 12 from both sides:\n\\( -8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\nHmm, that looks a bit messy. Maybe I should denote some symmetric sums to make this manageable. Let me define:\n\\( S = x + y + z \\),\n\\( P = xy + yz + zx \\),\nand \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\).\n\nI also know that:\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \\).\n\nSo substituting back into the equation from the sum of cubes:\n\\( -8 = S((S^2 - 2P) - P) \\)\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\\( (S^2 - 2P - P) = S^"

Let me see if I can factor terms:\nGroup terms with similar variables:\n- From the first two terms: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) = x y (x + y) \\)\n- Similarly, next two: \\( xz^2 + x^2 z = x z (z + x) \\)\n- Last two: \\( yz^2 + y^2 z = y z (z + y) \\)\n\nSo overall, the third equation becomes:\n\\( x y (x + y) + x z (x + z) + y z (y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nHmm, that's \\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\)\n\nI wonder if I can express this in terms of S, P, and Q. Let me expand each term.\n\nFirst, \\( xy(x + y) = x^2 y + x y^2 \\), which we already have. But how else can we approach this?\n\nWait, I recall that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\). But we've already used that. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the third equation:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nFactor each pair:\n= \\( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \\) as before.\n\nWait, maybe we can write this as:\n= \\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \\)\nBut since"
