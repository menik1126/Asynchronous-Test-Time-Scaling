The problem says that the direction vector of a line is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, I need to determine the value of \\( b \\) based on the Asymptote figure provided.\n\nFirst, I remember that the direction vector of a line can be found using the change in coordinates between two points on the line. The direction vector points in the direction the line is heading. If I can find two points on the line, I can compute the direction vector and thus find \\( b \\).\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, there are points defined as \\( A = (-5,4) \\) and \\( B = (-1,3) \\). These are two points on the line. So, I can calculate the direction vector by subtracting the coordinates of point \\( A \\) from point \\( B \\).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nThe direction vector \\( \\vec{v} \\) is \\( B - A \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 - (-5) \\\\ 3 - 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 + 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nWait, but the direction vector given in the problem is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, that doesn't match what I just found. Maybe I'm not interpreting the direction correctly.\n\nLet me think again. The direction vector could be pointing in the opposite direction as well, right? So, if \\( \\vec{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is the direction from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\), then the direction vector from \\( B \\) to \\( A \\) would be \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nBut neither of these is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Hmm, perhaps the direction vector is scaled? Let's see.\n\nThe direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1"

So, if I multiply by a scalar \\( k \\), it would be \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4k \\\\ -k \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nWe need this to be equal to \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, setting them equal:\n\n\\( 4k = -7 \\) and \\( -k = b \\).\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( k = -\\frac{7}{4} \\). Plugging this into the second equation, \\( b = -(-\\frac{7}{4}) = \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nWait, but let me verify. If the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ \\frac{7}{4} \\end{pmatrix} \\), that's a multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) because \\( (-7) \\times \\frac{4}{7} = -4 \\) and \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = 1 \\). But wait, if scaled by \\( k = -\\frac{7}{4} \\), then:\n\n\\( 4k = 4 \\times (-\\frac{7}{4}) = -7 \\)\n\n\\( -k = -(-\\frac{7}{4}) = \\frac{7}{4} \\)\n\nSo, \\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\). That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is from right to left? The Asymptote code draws the line from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\), which are extensions from points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) to the lines \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\).\n\nWait, let's see. The Asymptote code defines \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) as extensions of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) to the lines \\( x = -8 \\) and \\( x = 8 \\). So, maybe the line crosses the y-axis at some point, but in this case, I need to figure out the direction.\n\nAlternatively, the direction vector can be determined from the slope. Let me compute the slope between points \\( A \\)"

So the slope is \\( -1/4 \\).\n\nThe direction vector can be written as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ m \\end{pmatrix} \\), but actually, the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta x \\\\ \\Delta y \\end{pmatrix} \\). Since the slope is \\( \\Delta y / \\Delta x = -1/4 \\), so for a change in \\( x \\) of 4, the change in \\( y \\) is -1, so direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which matches what I had before.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector is a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The problem states that the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So, this must be a scalar multiple of the original direction vector.\n\nLet me set up the proportion:\n\n\\( \\frac{-7}{4} = \\frac{b}{-1} \\)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\( (-7)(-1) = 4b \\)\n\n\\( 7 = 4b \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nHmm, so that's the same answer as before. So, \\( b = \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think of direction vectors. If the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), then the slope would be \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\). Since the slope of the line is known to be \\( -1/4 \\), then:\n\n\\( \\frac{b}{-7} = -1/4 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( b \\):\n\nMultiply both sides by -7:\n\n\\( b = (-1/4)(-7) = 7/4 \\).\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( b \\) is \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap"
