Dividing 57 by 160 gives 0.35625.\n\nTo verify that this is a terminating decimal, I'll examine the prime factors of the denominator, 160. The prime factorization of 160 is \\(2^5 \\times 5^1\\). Since the denominator has only 2s and 5s as prime factors, the decimal representation will terminate.\n\nWith this knowledge, I can confidently present that \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) converts to the terminating decimal 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express the Fraction as a Decimal:**\n   \n   Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} \\div 1 = 0.35625\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Understand Why the Decimal Terminates:**\n   \n   A fraction in its lowest terms will have a terminating decimal if the denominator, after simplifying, has no prime factors other than 2 and/or 5.\n   \n   - **Prime Factorization of the Denominator (160):**\n     \\[\n     160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n     \\]\n     \n   - Since the denominator only contains the prime factors 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n   \n3. **Final Terminating Decimal:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
