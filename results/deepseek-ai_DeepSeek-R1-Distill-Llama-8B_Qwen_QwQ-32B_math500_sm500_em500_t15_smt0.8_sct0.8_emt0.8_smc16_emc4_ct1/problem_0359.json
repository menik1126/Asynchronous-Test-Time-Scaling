Let\u2019s denote the number of blue marbles as 4x and the number of yellow marbles as 3x based on the given ratio of 4:3.\n\nNext, after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the ratio becomes 7:3. This means the new quantities are 7y blue marbles and 3y yellow marbles.\n\nI'll set up an equation to relate the initial and final quantities. From the changes, we can express the new blue marbles as 4x + 5 and the new yellow marbles as 3x - 3. These should equal 7y and 3y respectively.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n4x + 5 = 7y\n3x - 3 = 3y\n\nFrom the second equation, I can solve for y in terms of x:\n3x - 3 = 3y \u2192 y = x - 1\n\nSubstituting y in the first equation:\n4x + 5 = 7(x - 1)\n4x + 5 = 7x - 7\n\nSolving for x:\n5 + 7 = 7x - 4x \u2192 12 = 3x \u2192 x = 4\n\nNow, finding the initial number of blue marbles:\n4x = 4 * 4 = 16\n\nTherefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before the changes.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let\u2019s denote:**\n- Let \\( x \\) be the common multiplier for the ratio \\( 4:3 \\) (blue to yellow marbles).\n\n**Initial Ratios:**\n- Blue marbles initially: \\( 4x \\)\n- Yellow marbles initially: \\( 3x \\)\n\n**After Adding and Removing:**\n- Add \\( 5 \\) blue marbles: Blue marbles become \\( 4x + 5 \\)\n- Remove \\( 3 \\) yellow marbles: Yellow marbles become \\( 3x - 3 \\)\n\n**New Ratio:**\n- The new ratio is \\( 7:3 \\) (blue to yellow marbles).\n\n**Set Up Equations:**\n\\[\n\\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7"
