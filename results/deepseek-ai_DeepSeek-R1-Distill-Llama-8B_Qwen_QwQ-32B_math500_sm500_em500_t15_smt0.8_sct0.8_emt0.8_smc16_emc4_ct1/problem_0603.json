Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\) is centered at the origin with a radius of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). The parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\) opens to the right, vertex at the origin as well. From the graph provided, it seems like they have two common tangents, which will touch both the circle and the parabola, forming four points of tangency. These four points are going to form a quadrilateral, and I need to find its area.\n\nMy initial thought is that these common tangents would be symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis since both the circle and parabola are symmetric about these axes. So, the four points of tangency should also be symmetric in some way.\n\nTo find the points of tangency, I think I need to find the equations of the common tangents to both the circle and the parabola. Once I have those tangent lines, I can find their points of contact with the circle and the parabola, which will give me the four points of tangency.\n\nSo, how do I find the common tangents? Well, for a circle and a parabola, finding the common tangents can be a bit tricky, but maybe I can use the condition that the distance from the center of the circle to the tangent line is equal to the radius. Alternatively, I can also use the point-form of the tangent to both the circle and the parabola.\n\nLet's recall that for a circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\\), the equation of a tangent line at point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is \\(xx_1 + yy_1 = r^2\\). For a parabola \\(y^2 = 4ax\\), the equation of the tangent at point \\((at^2, 2at)\\) is \\(ty = x + at^2\\). Wait, in our case, the parabola is \\(y^2 = 8"

Hence, the tangent to the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\) at a point \\((2t^2, 4t)\\) would be \\(ty = x + 2t^2\\).\n\nSimilarly, for the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\), the tangent at any point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) on the circle is \\(xx_1 + yy_1 = 2\\), since the radius squared is 2.\n\nSince the tangent lines must be common, the tangent to the parabola must also satisfy the condition of being tangent to the circle. Therefore, the tangent line to the parabola \\(ty = x + 2t^2\\) must also be a tangent to the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\). \n\nLet me write down the equation of the tangent line as \\(x - ty + 2t^2 = 0\\) (rearranged from \\(ty = x + 2t^2\\)).\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should write it in the standard form \\(Ax + By + C = 0\\) so that I can compute the distance from the center (which is the origin here) to this line and set it equal to the radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nAlternatively, the tangent line to the parabola can be written in slope-intercept form.

Wait, maybe that's a way too?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps treating the tangent to both curves, so the tangent line must satisfy both equations. So, maybe for the tangent line in the form y = mx + c, it must satisfy the condition of being tangent to both the parabola and the circle.\n\nI think this might be a good approach.
