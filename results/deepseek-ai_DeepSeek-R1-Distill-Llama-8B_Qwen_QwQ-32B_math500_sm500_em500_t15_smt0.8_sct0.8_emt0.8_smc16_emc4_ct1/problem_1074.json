The sequence starts with 0. The second term is obtained by adding 1 to the first term, resulting in 1. The third term is created by multiplying the second term by 1, which keeps it at 1. \n\nMoving on, the fourth term is formed by adding 2 to the third term, bringing us to 3. The fifth term is then obtained by multiplying the fourth term by 2, giving 6. This pattern continues, alternating between addition and multiplication with incrementing integers.\n\nFollowing this progression, the sixth term is 9, and the seventh term is 27. The next term would involve adding 4 to 27, resulting in 31. Multiplying by 4 gives 124, and then adding 5 brings the term to 129. Finally, multiplying by 5 gives 645, which is the first term exceeding 125.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step to find the first term greater than 125.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Sequence Rules**\n- The sequence starts with **0**.\n- Subsequent terms are generated by **alternately adding and multiplying** by each successive integer starting from **1**.\n- **Operation order**:\n  - Add 1 to the previous term.\n  - Multiply by 2.\n  - Add 3.\n  - Multiply by 4.\n  - And so on.\n\n**Step 2: Generate the Sequence Terms**\n\nLet's compute each term step by step:\n\n1. **Term 1**: 0\n2. **Term 2**: \\(0 + 1 = 1\\)\n3. **Term 3**: \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\)\n4. **Term 4**: \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n5. **Term 5**: \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\)\n6. **Term 6**: \\(20 + 5 = 25\\)\n7. **Term 7**: \\(25 \\times 6 = 150\\)\n8. **Term 8**: \\(150 + 7 = 157\\)\n9. **Term 9**: \\(157 \\times 8 = 1256\\)\n\n**Step 3:"
