I can set up the equation \\( 45\\pi = \\pi r^2 h \\).\n\nNext, I notice that both sides of the equation have \\( \\pi \\), so I can divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\) to simplify the equation, which gives me \\( 45 = r^2 h \\).\n\nThe radius \\( r \\) is provided as 3 cm, so I can substitute that into the equation. This results in \\( 45 = 3^2 \\times h \\), which simplifies to \\( 45 = 9h \\).\n\nFinally, to find the height \\( h \\), I divide both sides of the equation by 9, so \\( h = \\frac{45}{9} = 5 \\) cm.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given the volume of a cylinder \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters and the radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm. We need to find the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder.\n\n1. **Recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder:**\n   \n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute the known values into the formula:**\n   \n   \\[\n   45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   45 = 9h\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9:**\n   \n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
