So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(...)) with four factorial terms. That sounds complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a superfactorial is. I think it's similar to a power tower but with factorials instead of exponents. So for 4$, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). Wait, no, actually, the definition says it's n! with n! on top, so for 4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me make sure I understand the notation correctly.\n\nThe superfactorial n\\$ is defined as a tower of n!s, each one being a factorial of the previous. So for 4\\$ it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). That means the topmost term is 4!, the next is (4!)!, and so on, until there are 4! total terms? Wait, no, actually, the notation might be a bit different. Let me check again. It says n\\$ is underbrace{n!^{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}}} with n! levels. So for n=4, it's a tower of 4 levels, where each level is a factorial. So starting from the top: 4, then (4)!, then ((4!)!)!, then (((4!)!)!)! . Wait, that doesn't make sense because each step is a factorial of the previous term.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me parse the notation carefully. The definition is: n\\$ = n!^{n!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{n!}}}}}, with n! levels. So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). So the topmost term is 4!, then the next term is (4!)!, then the next is ((4!)!)!, and so on, for a total of n! levels. But wait, n! levels for n"

Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}} }_{n!}\". So the underbrace has n! levels. So for n=4, the number of exponents is 24 (since 4! =24). So the tower is 24 levels high, each level being n! (which is 24). Wait, no, actually, the base is n! and each exponent is also n!? Wait, maybe the tower is n!^{n!^{n!^{...}}} with n! terms. So for n=4, it's 24^{24^{24^{...}}} with 24 terms. That's an astronomically large number. But the question is about the units digit. Maybe there's a pattern in the units digit of such towers?\n\nHmm, so the problem is to find the units digit of 4\\$, which is a tower of 24 (since 4! =24) copies of 24, each exponentiated. So 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 levels. But calculating that directly is impossible, so we need to find a pattern in the units digit.\n\nFirst, let's note that the units digit of a tower of exponents can sometimes be determined by looking at the exponent modulo certain numbers. Since we're interested in the units digit, which is the same as modulo 10, we can use Euler's theorem or look for cycles in the exponents.\n\nFirst, let's recall Euler's theorem: if a and n are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ is Euler's totient function. However, 24 and 10 are not coprime (they share factors 2), so Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Hmm, so maybe we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem by splitting modulo 2 and 5, then combine the results?\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with the units digit, perhaps we can look at the pattern of the units digit of powers of 24. Let's see"

So the pattern is 4,6 repeating every 2 exponents. So the units digit of 24^k depends on whether k is odd or even. If k is odd, units digit 4; if even, units digit 6.\n\nTherefore, 24^k mod 10 is 4 if k is odd, 6 if k is even.\n\nNow, the problem is 24^(24^(...)) with 24 levels. So we have a tower where the top exponent is 24, then below that is 24^24, and so on.\n\nBut to compute the exponent at each level, we can look at it modulo φ(10)=4, because for exponents beyond the first, we can use Euler's theorem. Wait, but 24 and 10 are not coprime, so Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly. However, we can still look for patterns.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the exponent modulo φ(10)=4, but since 10=2×5, φ(10)=4. Let's compute the exponent modulo 4, then for the result, compute modulo 10.\n\nWait, but since the base is 24, which is congruent to 4 mod 10. So the units digit depends on 4^k mod 10, which as we saw cycles every 2: 4,6,4,6...\n\nSo first, we need to find k, which is the exponent in 24^k mod 10. But k itself is a tower of 24 exponents. So 24^(24^(...)) with 23 more levels. So to find k, we need to compute the exponent tower modulo φ(10)=4, because the exponent cycles every 2, and φ(4)=2, so we can keep going.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.

Wait, actually, the entire exponent is the tower of 24 terms minus the first term, so 23 terms? Hmm, maybe I need to think recursively.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the units digit of 24^k is 4 if k is odd, 6 if even. Therefore, to find the units digit of E =24^(E'), we need to know whether E' is odd or even.\n\nSo first, let's determine if the exponent E' (which is the tower of 24 terms starting from the second level) is even or odd.\n\nBut 24 is even, so any power of 24 is even. Therefore, E' is 24^(something), which is even. Therefore, E' is even. Therefore, the exponent is even, so the units digit of 24^(even) is 6. Wait, so does that mean the units digit is 6?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. The exponent E' is the tower of 24^(24^...) with 23 terms. Since each term in the tower is 24, which is even, so the entire exponent E' is even. Therefore, 24^(even) has units digit 6. So is the answer 6?\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Let me think again. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me denote the tower as follows:\n\nLet’s define the tower T(n) as a tower of n copies of 24. So T(1) =24, T(2)=24^24, T(3)=24^24^24, etc. So 4\\$ is T(24). We need to find T(24) mod 10.\n\nWe can note that T(n) mod 10 depends on T(n-1) mod φ(10)=4, because of Euler's theorem.

However, we can use the Carmichael theorem or consider the cycles.\n\nAlternatively, since we're interested in the exponent mod 4, because 24^k mod 10 cycles every 2, as observed before. So for the base 24, 24 ≡4 mod 10, and 4^k mod 10 cycles every 2. So to find 4^{E'} mod 10, we need E' mod 2. Because 4^1=4, 4^2=6, 4^3=4, etc. So if E' is odd, 4 mod 10. If E' is even, 6 mod10.\n\nSo first, we need to determine E' mod 2, where E' is T(23)=24^(24^...^24) with 23 terms. Since each term is 24, which is even, any power of 24 is even. Therefore, E' is even, which means 4^even mod10 is 6. So does that mean T(24) mod10 is 6?\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I'm oversimplifying. Let me try to think in more depth.\n\nLet me consider that the exponent E' is the tower T(23). We need E' mod 2. Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so T(23) is even, so E' is even. Therefore, 4^{even} mod10=6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with modulo operations, especially in towers, things can be tricky. Let me see:\n\nThe key is that for the units digit, since the base is 24≡4 mod10, and 4^k cycles every 2. So we need to determine the parity of the exponent, which is E'. Since E' is a tower of 24 terms, each 24, which is even, so E' is even. Therefore, the exponent is even, so 4^even mod10=6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think recursively.\n\nDefine f(n) = 24^f(n-1), with f(1)=24.

Since f(23) is even, as before, so k is even, so 4^even mod10=6.\n\nAlternatively, let me try with smaller towers to see if the pattern holds.\n\nSuppose we have a tower of 1: T(1)=24 mod10=4.\n\nTower of 2: T(2)=24^24 mod10. Since exponent 24 is even, so 4^even mod10=6. So T(2) mod10=6.\n\nTower of 3: T(3)=24^(T(2)) mod10. Since T(2) mod10=6, but actually, we need T(2) mod2 to determine the exponent's parity. Wait, T(2)=24^24, which is even, so exponent is even. So 24^(even) mod10=6. So T(3) mod10=6.\n\nSimilarly, T(4)=24^T(3). Since T(3) is even, exponent is even, so again 6 mod10. So in fact, once the tower has at least two levels, the units digit is 6. Because the exponent is even, so 24^even ends with 6, and any further exponents will still be even, so it stays 6.\n\nTherefore, for any tower with two or more levels, the units digit is 6.

So yes, once you have two levels, it becomes 6 and stays there. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Suppose the tower is T(2)=24^24. The exponent is 24, which is even, so "

Therefore, indeed, from T(2) onwards, the units digit is 6.\n\nSo applying that to the problem, since 4\\$ is T(24), which is way beyond T(2), the units digit is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe units digit of 4\\$ can be determined by analyzing the pattern in the units digits of powers of 24. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Understanding the Superfactorial**: 4\\$ is a tower of 24 levels, each level being 24! (but simplified modulo 10, as we're interested in the units digit).\n\n2. **Simplifying the Base**: 24 mod 10 = 4.

Since 24 is even, any tower of 24 exponents will be even.
