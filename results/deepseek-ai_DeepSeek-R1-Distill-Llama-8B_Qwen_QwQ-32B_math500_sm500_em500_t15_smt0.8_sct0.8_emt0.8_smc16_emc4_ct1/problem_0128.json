            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the units digit of 4\\$, which is the superfactorial of 4. The superfactorial is defined as n\\$ = n!^{{n!^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}} with n! terms. That seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what the superfactorial is. For n=4, it would be 4! raised to the power of itself multiple times, specifically 4! times? Wait, no, actually, the superfactorial is n!^{n!^{n!^{...}}} with n! number of times. So for n=4, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}.\n\nHmm, that's a tower of exponents with 4! = 24 terms. That's a massive exponent. Calculating that directly is impossible because the number is way too big. So I need another approach, probably focusing on the units digit patterns.\n\nI remember that the units digit of powers often cycles in a pattern. So maybe I can find the pattern for the units digit of 24^k and then figure out what k is in this case. But wait, the exponent itself is another superfactorial.\n\nLet me start by calculating the units digit of 24^k. Since we're dealing with units digits, I only need to consider 24 mod 10, which is 4. So 24 is congruent to 4 mod 10. Therefore, 24^k mod 10 is the same as 4^k mod 10.\n\nNow, the units digit of 4^k cycles every 2:\n- 4^1 = 4 → units digit 4\n- 4^2 = 16 → units digit 6\n- 4^3 = 64 → units digit 4\n- 4^4 = 256 → units digit 6\nAnd so on. So the cycle is 4, 6, 4, 6,... with a period of 2.\n\nSo, to find the units digit of 24^k, I just need to know whether k is odd or even. If k is odd, units digit is 4; if even, it's 6.\n\nBut in this case,"

            "output": " the exponent k is actually another tower of exponents. Let me write out the structure of 4\\$:\n\n4\\$ = 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 terms in the exponent tower.\n\nWait, actually, the definition says the number of terms is n! which for n=4 is 24. So the tower has 24 instances of 24. So the exponent is a tower of 24 24s. That's a tower of height 24. So the expression is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 24s.\n\nTherefore, to compute the units digit of this, we can work modulo 10. Since we need the units digit, which is the remainder mod 10. So let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me denote the tower as follows:\n\nLet’s denote the tower of exponents as E = 24^(24^(...^24)) with 23 24s (since the total height is 24, so the exponent of the base 24 is a tower of 23 24s). Then 4\\$ = 24^E.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4\\$ is the same as the units digit of 24^E mod 10. As before, since 24 mod 10 is 4, this reduces to 4^E mod 10.\n\nNow, as established earlier, 4^k mod 10 cycles every 2. So the key is to find E mod 2, because the cycle length is 2. Wait, actually, the exponent's parity (even or odd) will determine the result. Let me confirm:\n\nIf E is even, then 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nIf E is odd, then 4^E mod 10 is 4.\n\nTherefore, I need to determine whether E is even or odd. But E is a tower of 24s of height 23. Let's see:\n\nE = 24^(24^(...^24)) with 23 24s.\n\nBut 24 is even, so any power of 24 is even. Therefore, the exponent of the first 24 in the"

            "output": " tower is even. Then, regardless of what comes after, because it's an exponentiation, the result is even. So E is even.\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, let me think carefully. Since E is a tower, each exponentiation step can affect the exponent's parity.\n\nWait, E is 24^(something). 24 is even, so 24 raised to any positive integer power is even. Therefore, regardless of what the exponent is, 24^anything is even. Therefore, E is even.\n\nTherefore, E is even, so 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Is E necessarily even?\n\nIf E is 24 raised to any tower, is that exponentiation result even?\n\nYes, because 24 is even, and any power of an even number is even. Therefore, E is even.\n\nSo, E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me go through it again because I might have messed up the number of exponents.\n\nWait, 4\\$ has 24 terms. So it's 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 24s. So the topmost exponent is 24, then the next one down is 24^24, and so on, until the base is 24. So the exponent in 24^E is actually a tower with 23 exponents of 24.\n\nWait, so the tower's height is 24, which means the exponent E is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 23 exponents. So, the exponent tower has 23 layers. But 24 is even, so regardless of how many layers, each exponent is even, so the entire tower's result is even.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the number of layers (as long as it's at least one), the exponent E is even.\n\nThus, 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check for a smaller n to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, what is 2\\$? 2\\$ is 2!^{2!} = 2^2 = 4. So units digit is 4.\n\nWait"

Let's see if my method would work here.\n\nFollowing the same steps:\n\nCompute 2\\$ = 2^2. The exponent is 2, which is even. So 2^2 mod 10 is 4, which is correct. Wait, but according to the previous logic, since the exponent is even, 2^even mod 10. Wait, but 2's cycle is different. Wait, maybe I need to check for different bases.\n\nWait, in the case of 2\\$, the base is 2, so the units digit of 2^2 is 4, which is correct. But in the case of 4\\$, the base is 24, which mod 10 is 4, so we use 4's cycle. So that part is okay.\n\nWait, but let me check another example. Let's see 3\\$.\n\n3\\$ is 6^(6^(6^...^6)) with 6 terms. Wait, 3! is 6, so the tower has 6 terms. So the exponent is a tower of 5 6s. Let's see what the units digit would be.\n\nFirst, the base is 6, so 6 mod 10 is 6. The units digit of 6^anything is always 6, because 6*6=36, 6^2 ends with 6, etc. So regardless of the exponent, 6^k mod 10 is 6. Therefore, the units digit of 3\\$ is 6. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nIndeed, 3\\$ is a tower of 6 6s. Since any power of 6 ends with 6, so the entire tower's units digit is 6. So that works.\n\nSo going back to 4\\$, since the base mod 10 is 4, and the exponent is even, so 4^even mod 10 is 6. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the exponent was 1, then 4^1 mod 10 is 4. If exponent is 2, 4"

Therefore, since the exponent is even, units digit is 6.\n\nThus, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see if the exponent E is indeed even.\n\nE is 24^(24^(...^24)) with 23 exponents. Each 24 is even, so 24^anything is even. Therefore, each exponentiation step in the tower results in an even number. Thus, E is even.\n\nWait, but wait, is that necessarily true? Let me think: 24 is even, so any exponent of 24 is even. So yes, regardless of how many times you exponentiate 24, as long as it's 24^something, it's even.\n\nThus, E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nSo, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe units digit of 4\\$, the superfactorial, is determined by analyzing the cyclical pattern of the units digit of powers of 4. \n\n1. **Superfactorial Definition**: 4\\$ = 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 terms.\n2. **Modulo Reduction**: Focus on 24 mod 10 = 4.\n3. **Units Digit Cycle**: The units digit of 4^k cycles every 2 (4, 6, 4, 6...).\n4. **Exponent Parity**: The exponent in 24^k is a tower of 24s, which is definitely even because any power of 24 (even) is even.\n5. **Result**: Since the exponent is even, 4^even mod 10 = 6.\n\nThus, the units digit of 4\\$ is $\\boxed{6}$."
