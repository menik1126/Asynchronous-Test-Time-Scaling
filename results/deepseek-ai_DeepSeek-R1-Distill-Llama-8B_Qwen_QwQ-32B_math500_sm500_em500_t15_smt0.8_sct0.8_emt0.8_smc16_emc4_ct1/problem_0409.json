Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, this translates to approximately 2000 revolutions per second.\n\nThe second gear turns 45 times per minute, so with 60 seconds in a minute, this is 45/60 = 0.75 revolutions per second.\n\nNext, I'll find the LCM of the two rotational periods. Since the first gear's period is 2000 seconds and the second is 0.75 seconds, the LCM of 2000 and 0.75 is 1500 seconds.\n\nAfter 1500 seconds, both gears will have completed an integer number of revolutions and will align their marks pointing north.\n</think>\n\nTo determine after how many seconds both gears will next align their marks pointing due north, we need to find when both gears complete an integer number of revolutions simultaneously.

Let me verify:\n\n**Clarification:**\nActually, the confusion arises from correctly applying the LCM method for two revolution periods when they are fractional.

So period is 1/2000 seconds per revolution.\n\nSecond Gear: 45 RPM = 45 RPS, so period is 1/45 seconds per revolution.\n\nWe need the LCM of 1/2000 and 1/45.\n\nBut LCM of periods is 1 / GCD of RPMs.\n\nWait, another approach: LCM of periods is 1 / GCD(RPM1, RPM2).\n\nBut RPM1 = 100/3 ≈ 33.333, RPM2 = 45.\n\nGCD(100/3, 45).
