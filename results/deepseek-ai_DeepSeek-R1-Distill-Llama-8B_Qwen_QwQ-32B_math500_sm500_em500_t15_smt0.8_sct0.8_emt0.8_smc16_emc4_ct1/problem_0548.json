            "output": "To find the average price of the 70s stamps, I first need to identify how many stamps Juan purchased during that decade and their respective prices.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote figure provided, each position on the grid represents a year within a decade. The positions are labeled from 3 to 17 on the x-axis, corresponding to the years 1950 to 1960, 1960 to 1970, and so on.\n\nI notice that the 70s stamps are represented by the positions labeled 13 on the x-axis, which corresponds to the 1960-1970 decade. Under each country label, the price for the 70s stamps is listed. For Brazil, the price is 12 cents, for France it's 6 cents, for Peru it's 12 cents, and for Spain it's 6 cents.\n\nNext, I need to count how many stamps Juan has in each country for the 70s. The figure shows that each country has a position for each year it issued stamps in that decade. Since there are 10 years in a decade and four countries, it implies there are 10 stamps in total for each country during the 70s.\n\nNow, to calculate the total cost for the 70s stamps, I multiply the number of stamps by their average price. However, since each country has a different price, I need to calculate the total cost for each country separately and then sum them up. \n\nFor Brazil: 10 stamps × 12 cents = 120 cents\nFor France: 10 stamps × 6 cents = 60 cents\nFor Peru: 10 stamps × 12 cents = 120 cents\nFor Spain: 10 stamps × 6 cents = 60 cents\n\nAdding these together: 120 + 60 + 120 + 60 = 360 cents\n\nFinally, to find the average price, I divide the total cost by the total number of stamps. There are 40 stamps in total during the 70s (10 stamps per country × 4 countries).\n\nAverage price = 360 cents ÷ 40 = 9.0 cents\n\nSo, the average price of Juan's 70s stamps is 9.0 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of Stamps and Their Prices:**\n   - **Brazil:** 10 stamps priced"
