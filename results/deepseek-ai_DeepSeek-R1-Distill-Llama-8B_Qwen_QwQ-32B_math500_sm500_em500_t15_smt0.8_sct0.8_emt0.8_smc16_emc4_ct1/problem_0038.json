            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number excluding the number itself.\n\nI'll start by factoring 284. Since 284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. 142 is also even, so dividing by 2 again yields 71. Now, I check if 71 is a prime number. \n\n71 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2^2 * 71^1.\n\nNext, I'll use the formula for the sum of divisors. For a number n = p^a * q^b, the sum of divisors is (1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^a)(1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^b). Applying this to 284:\n\nSum of divisors = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 71) = 7 * 72 = 504.\n\nFinally, the sum of proper divisors is this total minus the number itself: 504 - 284 = 220.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. I'll start by factoring 220.\n\n220 can be divided by 2, giving 110. Dividing by 2 again yields 55. 55 is divisible by 5 and 11. So, its prime factors are 2^2 * 5^1 * 11^1.\n\nUsing the sum of divisors formula again:\n\nSum of divisors = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5)(1 + 11) = 7 * 6 * 12 = 252.\n\nSubtracting the number itself to find the sum of proper divisors: 252 - 220 = 32.\n\nSo, the final answer is 32.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**\n2. **Then, find the sum of the proper divisors of the result obtained in step 1.**\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations.\n\n**Step 1: Sum of Proper Divisors of 284**\n\n- **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n "
