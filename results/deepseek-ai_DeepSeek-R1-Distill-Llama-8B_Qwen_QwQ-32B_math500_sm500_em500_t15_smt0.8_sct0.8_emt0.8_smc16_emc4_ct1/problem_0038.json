Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Proper divisors of a number N are all the positive integers that divide N without leaving a remainder, excluding N itself. So for example, the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which adds up to 16. The problem is asking for two things: first, the sum of the proper divisors of 284, and then the sum of the proper divisors of that result.\n\nOkay, so step one is to find the proper divisors of 284. Let me start by finding all the divisors of 284, including 284 itself, and then subtract 284 to get the proper ones.\n\nBefore that, maybe I can factorize 284 into its prime factors because that might help in finding all the divisors. Let me see, 284 divided by 2 is 142. Then 142 divided by 2 is 71. Is 71 a prime number? Let me check. 71 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11. Let me try dividing 71 by 7: 7 times 10 is 70, so 71 minus 70 is 1, so not divisible by 7. Let me try 11: 11 times 6 is 66, 11 times 7 is 77, which is more than 71. So yes, 71 is prime. So the prime factors of 284 are 2^2 * 71^1.\n\nNow, to find all the divisors, I can use the formula for the number of divisors, which is (exponent of 2 + 1) * (exponent of 71 + 1) = (2+1)*(1+1) = 3*2=6. So there are 6 divisors in total. Let me list them out.\n\nThe exponents for 2 are 0,1,2 and for 71 are 0,1. So multiplying these:\n\n- 2^0 * 71^0 = 1\n- 2^1 * 71^0 ="

            "output": " 2\n- 2^2 * 71^0 = 4\n- 2^0 * 71^1 = 71\n- 2^1 * 71^1 = 142\n- 2^2 * 71^1 = 284\n\nSo the divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and 284. The proper divisors are all except 284, so that's 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142. Now, let me sum these up.\n\nAdding them: 1 + 2 = 3; 3 + 4 = 7; 7 + 71 = 78; 78 + 142 = 220. So the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. Again, I'll need to find all proper divisors of 220 and sum them up.\n\nFirst, let me factorize 220. Let's see: 220 divided by 2 is 110; 110 divided by 2 is 55; 55 divided by 5 is 11. So the prime factors are 2^2 * 5^1 * 11^1.\n\nUsing the same method, the number of divisors is (2+1)*(1+1)*(1+1) = 3*2*2=12. So there are 12 divisors in total.\n\nLet me list them out by combining the exponents:\n\nFor 2: 0,1,2\n\nFor 5: 0,1\n\nFor 11: 0,1\n\nNow, cross-multiplying:\n\n- 2^0 * 5^0 * 11^0 = 1\n- 2^1 = 2, 2^2=4\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to systematically list all the combinations:\n\n1. 2^0 * 5^0 * 11^0 = 1\n2. 2^1 * 5^0 * 11^0 = 2\n3. 2^2 * 5^0 * 11^0 = 4\n4. 2^0 * 5^1 * 11^0 = 5\n5."

The sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284. But 284 is the original number we started with. So, it seems like the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, and then the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, which is a perfect number. I remember there's something called a perfect number, where the sum of proper divisors equals the number itself. So 284 is a perfect number.\n\nBut let me just confirm that I didn't make a mistake in adding all those numbers. Let me try adding them in a different order, perhaps grouping them to make it easier.\n\nFirst, I'll add the smaller numbers: 1, "
