Let me recall how polynomial long division works. It's similar to the long division I did in elementary school, but with polynomials instead of numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to set it up. The dividend is \\( x^6 - 3 \\) and the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\). I remember that the goal is to divide the highest degree term of the dividend by the highest degree term of the divisor to find the first term of the quotient. So, let me write that down.\n\nThe dividend is \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\) because all the terms except \\( x^6 \\) and the constant term are missing. The divisor is \\( x + 1 \\). \n\nSo, the first step is to divide \\( x^6 \\) by \\( x \\), which gives me \\( x^5 \\). That's the first term of the quotient. Now, I need to multiply the entire divisor \\( x + 1 \\) by this term \\( x^5 \\) and subtract the result from the original dividend. \n\nMultiplying \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^5 \\) gives me \\( x^6 + x^5 \\). Subtracting this from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^6 + x^5) \\) equals \\( -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nSo now, the new dividend is \\( -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\). I repeat the process by dividing the leading term \\( -x^5 \\) by \\( x \\), which gives me \\( -x^4 \\). So, the next term in the quotient is \\( -x^4 \\).\n\nMultiplying \\( x + 1"

Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^3 \\) to get \\( x^4 + x^3 \\). Subtracting:\n\n\\( (x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^4 + x^3) \\) gives \\( -x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nNext, divide \\( -x^3 \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( -x^2 \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( -x^2 \\) to get \\( -x^3 - x^2 \\). Subtracting:\n\n\\( (-x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (-x^3 - x^2) \\) results in \\( x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nNow, divide \\( x^2 \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( x \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( x^2 + x \\). Subtracting:\n\n\\( (x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^2 + x) \\) gives \\( -x - 3 \\).\n\nFinally, divide \\( -x \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( -1 \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( -1 \\) to get \\( -x - 1 \\). Subtracting:\n\n\\( (-x - 3) - (-x - 1) \\) equals \\( (-x + x) + (-3 + 1) \\), which simplifies to \\( -2 \\).\n\nSince the remainder is a constant, it's not zero, so the division isn't exact.
