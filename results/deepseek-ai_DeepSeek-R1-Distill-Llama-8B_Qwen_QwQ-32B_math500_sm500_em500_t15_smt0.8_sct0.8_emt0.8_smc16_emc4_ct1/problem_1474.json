            "output": "I need to simplify the given expression: the cube root of the square root of the square root of 1/729. \n\nFirst, I recognize that 729 is equal to 9 cubed, which is 9 × 9 × 9. This makes it easier to handle the exponents involved in simplifying the expression.\n\nNext, I should express the radicals in terms of fractional exponents. The cube root can be written as something raised to the power of 1/3, and the square root as something raised to the power of 1/2. This will make it simpler to combine the exponents later.\n\nApplying this to the original expression, I can rewrite it as: (1/729) raised to the 1/2 power, then raised to the 1/3 power, and finally raised to the 1/2 power again. This gives me: (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2).\n\nNow, I need to calculate the exponents. Multiplying 1/2 by 1/3 gives 1/6, and then multiplying that by another 1/2 results in 1/12. So, the expression becomes (1/729) raised to the power of 1/12.\n\nSince 729 is 9 cubed, which is 3 to the 6th power, it's easier to rewrite 1/729 as 3 to the power of -6. So, the expression now is (3^(-6))^(1/12), which simplifies to 3^(-6/12) or 3^(-1/2).\n\nTo convert this back to a radical with a rational denominator, I recall that 3^(-1/2) is the same as 1 over the square root of 3. Since the problem asks for a rational denominator, I should rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the square root of 3.\n\nMultiplying 1 by the square root of 3 gives √3, and multiplying the denominator by √3 as well gives √3 × √3, which equals 3. So, the expression simplifies to √3 / 3.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of the original expression with a rational denominator is √3 divided by 3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1"
