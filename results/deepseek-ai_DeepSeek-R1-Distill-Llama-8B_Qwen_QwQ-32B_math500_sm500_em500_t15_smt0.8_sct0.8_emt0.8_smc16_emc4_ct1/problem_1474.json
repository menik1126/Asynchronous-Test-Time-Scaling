            "output": "To simplify the expression √(³√(⁴√(1/729))), I start by addressing the innermost radical, the fourth root of 1/729.\n\nFirst, I recognize that 729 is a power of 9, specifically 9 to the sixth power, and since the denominator is 729, which is 9⁶, I can rewrite 1/729 as 1/9⁶.\n\nNext, I take the fourth root of 1/9⁶, which simplifies to 1/9^(6/4) or 1/9^(3/2). This can be rewritten as 1/(9^(3/2)).\n\nNow, I move to the next radical, the cube root of 1/(9^(3/2)). The cube root of something to the 3/2 power is the same as that something to the 1/2 power. Therefore, this becomes 1/9^(1/2), which is 1/3.\n\nFinally, I take the square root of 1/3, which simplifies to the square root of 1 divided by the square root of 3, resulting in 1/√3.\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by √3, giving the final simplified expression as √3/3.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression $$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$ and write it with a rational denominator, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Innermost Radical:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{729}} = \\frac{1}{27}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Move to the Next Radical:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{1}}{\\sqrt[3]{27}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Take the Square Root of the Result:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Rationalize the Denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac"
