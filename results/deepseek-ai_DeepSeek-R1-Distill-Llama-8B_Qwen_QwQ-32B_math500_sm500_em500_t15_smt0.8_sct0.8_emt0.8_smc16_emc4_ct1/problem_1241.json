            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that when there's a square root in an equation, it's usually a good idea to get rid of it by squaring both sides. But before I do that, maybe I should make sure I understand the equation properly. So, the equation is:\n\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, so the variable x is on both sides of the equation, and it's also inside the square root on the right side. That might complicate things a bit, but I think I can handle it.\n\nLet me write it down again for clarity:\n\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nNow, to eliminate the square root, I can isolate it on one side before squaring. So maybe I can subtract 4 from both sides to get the square root by itself.\n\nSo, if I subtract 4 from both sides, I get:\n\nx - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nThat seems better. Now, the square root is by itself on the right, and everything else is on the left. Now, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. Let's do that.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (sqrt(11 - 2x))^2\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nExpanding the left side. I remember that (a - b)^2 is a^2 - 2ab + b^2, so applying that here:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nNow, the equation becomes a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side so that the equation equals zero. To do that, I'll subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides.\n\nSo, subtract 11 and add 2x:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplify the constants and combine like terms. Let's compute:\n\n16 - 11 is 5, and -8x + 2x is -6x. So"

            "output": ", now the equation is:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check my steps. Starting from squaring both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nWhich expands to:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nThen, moving all terms to the left:\n\nx^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nYes, that's correct. So, x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0.\n\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation. Let's see if I can factor it or use the quadratic formula. The equation is:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nLet me try factoring first. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. Since the middle term is -6x, which is negative, and the constant term is positive 5, both numbers should be negative.\n\nSo, -1 and -5: (-1) * (-5) = 5, and (-1) + (-5) = -6. Perfect.\n\nSo, the equation factors as:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives:\n\nx - 1 = 0  =>  x = 1\n\nx - 5 = 0  =>  x = 5\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. However, since the original equation involved a square root, I need to check these solutions in the original equation to make sure they work and also ensure that we didn't introduce any extraneous solutions during the squaring step.\n\nLet's check x = 1 first.\n\nOriginal equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubstituting x = 1:\n\nLeft side: 1\n\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 2*1) + 4 = sqrt(11 - 2) + 4 = sqrt(9) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, 1 = 7? That's not true. Therefore, x = 1 is an extraneous solution and must be rejected.\n\n"

Therefore, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nWait a second, so x = 1 doesn't work, but x = 5 does. That means that when we squared both sides of the equation, we introduced an extraneous solution that doesn't satisfy the original equation. So, only x = 5 is the valid solution.\n\nLet me just recap what I did step by step to make sure I didn't skip anything important.\n\n1. Started with the equation: x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n2. Subtracted 4 from both sides to isolate the square root: x - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n3. Squared both sides to eliminate the square root, resulting in a quadratic equation: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n4. Expanded and simplified the equation to get x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0\n5. Factored the quadratic equation into (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0, giving potential solutions x = 1 and x = 5\n6. Plugged both solutions back into the original equation to check validity, finding that x = 1 doesn't work and x = 5 does.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nI think that's thorough. I can't think of any steps I might have missed, but maybe I should also consider the domain of the original equation to ensure that the solutions I found are within the allowed range. For the square root sqrt(11 - 2x), the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. So:\n\n11 - 2x ≥ 0\n11 ≥ 2x\nx ≤ 11/2\nx ≤ 5.5\n\nOur solutions are x = 1 and x = 5, both of which are less than 5.5, so they are within the domain. But, as we saw, x = 1 doesn't satisfy the original equation"
