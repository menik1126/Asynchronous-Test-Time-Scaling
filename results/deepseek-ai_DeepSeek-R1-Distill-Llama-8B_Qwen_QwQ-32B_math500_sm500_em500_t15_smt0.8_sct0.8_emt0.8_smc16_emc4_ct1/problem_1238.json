Hmm, let me write that down properly so I can see it clearly.\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, I need to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation. Since there's a square root involved, I remember that usually, you have to isolate the square root term and then square both sides to eliminate it. Let me try that approach here.\n\nFirst, maybe I should subtract 4 from both sides to get the square root by itself. That makes sense because it will help me isolate the square root term, which I can then square. So, let's do that.\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nOkay, now the equation looks like x minus 4 equals the square root of (11 minus 2x). That's progress. Now, as I thought earlier, I should square both sides to get rid of the square root. Let me write that down.\n\n(x - 4)² = (√(11 - 2x))²\n\nSimplifying the right side, the square and the square root cancel each other out, so it becomes 11 - 2x. On the left side, I have to expand (x - 4) squared. Let me do that step by step.\n\nExpanding (x - 4)² gives me x squared minus 8x plus 16, right? Because (x - a)² is x² - 2ax + a². Here, a is 4, so 2a is 8 and a² is 16. So, expanding that:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nAlright, so now I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side so I can solve for x. Subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides.\n\nx² - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nSimplify the left side by combining like terms. So, -8x and +2x give -6x, and 16 - 11 is 5. So, the equation becomes:\n\nx² - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nGreat, now I have a quadratic equation. I can try to"

            "output": " factor this. Let me see if I can find two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. Since the middle term is -6x, both numbers should be negative to add up to -6. So, -1 and -5. Let me check:\n\n(x - 1)(x - 5) = x² - 5x - x + 5 = x² - 6x + 5\n\nPerfect, that's exactly the equation I have. So, the factors are (x - 1) and (x - 5). That means the solutions are x = 1 and x = 5. But wait, before I jump to conclusions, I need to make sure that these solutions are valid in the original equation. Because sometimes when you square both sides of an equation, you might introduce extraneous solutions that didn't work in the original equation.\n\nLet me check x = 1 first.\n\nPlugging x = 1 into the original equation:\n\n1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4\n\nCalculate inside the square root: 11 - 2 is 9. So, √9 is 3.\n\nThen, 3 + 4 is 7. But the left side is 1, and 1 ≠ 7. So, that's not a valid solution. Hmm, okay, so x = 1 is an extraneous solution. Let's try x = 5.\n\nPlugging x = 5 into the original equation:\n\n5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4\n\nCalculate inside the square root: 11 - 10 is 1. So, √1 is 1.\n\nThen, 1 + 4 is 5. Now, left side is 5 and right side is 5. That works! So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nBut wait, even though x = 1 didn't work, maybe I made a mistake in my earlier steps? Let me double-check my quadratic equation.\n\nStarting from x - 4 = √(11 - 2x), I squared both sides to get (x - 4)² = 11 - 2x, which expanded to x² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x. Then, moving all terms to the left: x² -"

So that must mean that x = 1 is an extraneous solution. Therefore, only x = 5 is the solution.\n\nWait, but why did I get x = 1 as a solution? Maybe there's a domain consideration I didn't check earlier. Because the square root function √(11 - 2x) must have a non-negative argument. So, 11 - 2x must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\nLet me write that condition down:\n\n11 - 2x ≥ 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-2x ≥ -11\n\nWhen I divide both sides by -2, I need to reverse the inequality sign because I'm dividing by a negative number.\n\nx ≤ 11/2\n\nSo, x must be less than or equal to 5.5. Hmm, since x = 5 is less than 5.5, that's valid. What about x = 1? Well, it's also less than 5.5, but it didn't satisfy the original equation. So, that's why it's called extraneous.\n\nWait another thought: when I check x = 1, the square root becomes √(11 - 2*1) = √9 = 3, which is fine. But then, 3 + 4 is 7, but x is 1. That inconsistency arises because when I squared both sides, I introduced a value that didn't satisfy the original equation.\n\nSo, perhaps the key takeaway here is that I always need to check my solutions in the original equation, especially after squaring both sides, which can sometimes create solutions that didn't exist before.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me go through the process again.\n\nStarting with x = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtract 4: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nSquare both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nExpand left side: x² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nBring all terms to left: x² - 6x +"

Let me try substituting y = √(11 - 2x). Then, the original equation becomes x = y +4. Also, since y = √(11 - 2x), then y must be non-negative (since square roots are non-negative). So, y ≥0.\n\nNow, substituting x = y +4 into the equation for y:\n\ny = √(11 - 2(y +4))\n\nLet me compute inside the square root:\n\n11 -2(y +4) = 11 -2y -8 = 3 -2y\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\ny = √(3 -2y)\n\nNow, let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\ny² = 3 -2y\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\ny² +2y -3 =0\n\nFactor this quadratic equation. Let's see, factors of -3 that add up to 2. Hmm, 3 and -1. So, (y +3)(y -1) =0 → y = -3 or y =1\n\nBut y was defined as the square root, so y must be ≥0. Therefore, y = -3 is invalid. Only y =1 is valid.\n\nTherefore, y =1. Then, since x = y +4, x =1 +4 =5. So, that gives x=5 as the only solution. This method also leads to the same answer, and avoids the extraneous solution because we considered the domain of y early on.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, and it confirms that x=5 is the only solution. Therefore, the answer is 5.\n\nWait, but why did the first method give an extraneous solution? Because when we squared both sides of the equation, we might have introduced a solution that doesn't satisfy the original equation"

            "output": ", since squaring can sometimes create solutions that aren't valid in the original context.\n\nIn this problem, x =1 gave a square root of 9, which is valid, but then when you plug it back in, the equation doesn't hold because x -4 is -3, which squared gives the correct number on the right side, but the original equation requires x to equal that square root plus 4, and in this case, x=1 is not equal to 7.\n\nSo, that's a good reminder that after squaring both sides, it's crucial to plug the solutions back into the original equation to ensure they are valid.\n\nAnother thing I'm thinking about is that sometimes, when dealing with these equations, the domain of the original equation is restricted. In this case, because of the square root, 11 -2x must be ≥0, so x must be ≤5.5. So, x=5 is within that domain, but x=1 is also within that domain. However, the extraneous solution is not just about the domain but about whether the equation holds true when evaluated.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the steps are:\n\n1. Start with the equation x = √(11 -2x) +4.\n\n2. Subtract 4: x -4 = √(11 -2x).\n\n3. Square both sides: (x -4)^2 = 11 -2x.\n\n4. Expand and simplify: x² -6x +5=0.\n\n5. Factor: (x -1)(x -5)=0, leading to solutions x=1 and x=5.\n\n6. Check both solutions in the original equation.\n\n7. x=1 doesn't satisfy the equation, so it's extraneous.\n\n8. x=5 does satisfy the equation, so it's the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, substituting y =√(11 -2x) leads to y=1, hence x=5, which gives the same solution without the extraneous root.\n\nSo, through both methods, the only valid solution is x=5.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified each part. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same answer, with x=5 being the only solution.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\).\n\n1.
