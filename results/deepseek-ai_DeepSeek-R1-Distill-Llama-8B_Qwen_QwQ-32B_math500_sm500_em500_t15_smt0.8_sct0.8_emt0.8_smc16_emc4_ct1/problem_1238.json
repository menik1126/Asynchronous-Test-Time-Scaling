            "output": "Alright, so I've got this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, okay. Let me write that down to visualize it better.\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nCool, so I need to find all the values of x that make this equation true. Since there's a square root involved, I remember that often times you have to square both sides to eliminate the radical. But before I jump into that, maybe I should check the domain of the equation to make sure I'm not dealing with any impossible situations.\n\nSo, the expression inside the square root, 11 - 2x, must be greater than or equal to zero because you can't take the square root of a negative number in real numbers. Let's set that up:\n\n11 - 2x ≥ 0\n\nSolving for x:\n\n11 ≥ 2x\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n11/2 ≥ x\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nx ≤ 5.5\n\nOkay, so x has to be less than or equal to 5.5. That's a good starting point. Now, let's get back to the original equation.\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nI think the next step is to isolate the square root. Let me subtract 4 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on the right.\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nNow, this looks better because the square root is by itself. To eliminate the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. But I remember that squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll have to check my answers at the end.\n\nLet's square both sides:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nOkay, so now I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side to set it equal to zero.\n\nx² - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx² - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nHmm, now I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me try factoring it. Looking for two numbers that"

            "output": " multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, if both are negative, they will multiply to positive 5 and add up to -6.\n\nYes, that works. So, the equation factors as:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives:\n\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5\n\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nSo, I have two potential solutions: x = 5 and x = 1. But wait, earlier I found that x must be ≤ 5.5, which both 5 and 1 satisfy. However, since we squared both sides, it's crucial to plug these back into the original equation to make sure they actually work.\n\nLet me check x = 5 first.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nPlug in x=5:\n\n5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4\n\nCalculate inside the square root:\n\n11 - 10 = 1\n\nSo,\n\n5 = √1 + 4\n\n√1 is 1, so:\n\n5 = 1 + 4 => 5 = 5\n\nThat's true, so x=5 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check x=1.\n\nAgain, plug into the original equation:\n\n1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4\n\nCalculate inside the square root:\n\n11 - 2 = 9\n\nSo,\n\n1 = √9 + 4\n\n√9 is 3, so:\n\n1 = 3 + 4 => 1 = 7\n\nWait, that's not true. 1 does not equal 7. Hmm, so x=1 is an extraneous solution. It doesn't satisfy the original equation, so we have to discard it.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is x=5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about this. When I squared both sides, sometimes the operations can mimic each other, but in this case, x=1 doesn't work. It's interesting because both solutions satisfied the domain condition, but only x=5 worked when plugged back into the original equation.\n\nLet me recap what I did:\n\n1. Checked the domain to make sure the expression inside the square root is non-negative, which"

Tested each solution in the original equation to ensure they didn't result from the squaring step which can introduce invalid solutions.\n\nHence, x=5 is the only solution.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me double-check my algebra to be sure.\n\nStarting with x = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtract 4: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nSquare both sides: (x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nExpand left side: x² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nBring all terms to left: x² - 8x + 16 -11 + 2x = x² - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nFactor: (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSolutions: x=5 and x=1\n\nCheck x=5: 5 = √1 + 4 => 5=5, valid\n\nCheck x=1: 1 = √9 + 4 => 1=7, invalid\n\nYep, everything seems correct.
