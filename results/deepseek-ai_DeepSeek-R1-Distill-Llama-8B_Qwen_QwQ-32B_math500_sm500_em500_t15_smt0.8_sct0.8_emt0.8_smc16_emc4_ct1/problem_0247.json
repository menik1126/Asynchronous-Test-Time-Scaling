The question states that this decimal will be a repeating decimal, and I need to determine how many digits repeat in this repeating part.\n\nNext, I recall that when a fraction has a denominator that is a product of powers of 10 (i.e., 2 and 5), the decimal terminates. However, if the denominator has prime factors other than 2 and 5, the decimal representation will be repeating.\n\nLooking at the denominator \\( 11111 \\), I notice that it doesn't have any factors of 2 or 5. This suggests that the decimal will indeed be repeating. To find the length of the repeating cycle, I can use the concept of the period of a decimal expansion.\n\nThe period of a decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{1}{p} \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number not dividing 10, is equal to the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( 10^k \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\). This means I need to find the smallest \\( k \\) where raising 10 to the power of \\( k \\) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by \\( 11111 \\).\n\nDue to the complexity of finding \\( k \\) directly, I can utilize the prime factorization of \\( 11111 \\). After factoring, I find that \\( 11111 = 41 \\times 271 \\). Both 41 and 271 are prime numbers. \n\nAccording to Euler's theorem, the period \\( k \\) must be a multiple of the order of 10 modulo each prime factor. The order of 10 modulo 41 is 4, and the order of 10 modulo 271 is 5. The least common multiple (LCM) of these orders (4 and 5) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the period \\( k \\) must be 20. This means that the repeating cycle of the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\) will consist of 20 digits repeating indefinitely.\n\nFinally, to confirm this, I can perform the long division of 31 by 11111 and observe the length of the repeating sequence in the decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the repeating decimal of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1"

    "question": "When converting $\\frac{31}{11111}$ to a decimal, the decimal turns out to be a repeating decimal. How many digits repeat in this repeating decimal?\n\nFor example, if you get the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{123},$ then your answer should be $3,$ and if you get $0.436\\overline{7},$ your answer should be $1.$"
