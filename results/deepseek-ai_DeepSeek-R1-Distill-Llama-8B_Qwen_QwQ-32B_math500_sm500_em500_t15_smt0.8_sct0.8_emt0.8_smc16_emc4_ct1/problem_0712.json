So, I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) gives:\n\\[ 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\). To find the number of real solutions, I can analyze the discriminant \\( D \\) of the quadratic equation, which is given by:\n\\[ D = b^2 - 4ac \\]\nwhere \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\[ D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (\\( D = 20 \\)), there are two distinct real solutions for \\( y \\). This means the parabola intersects the y-axis at two points.\n\nTherefore, the graph of the parabola \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has two y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of \\( y \\)-intercepts for the parabola defined by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of a \\( y \\)-intercept**\n\nA \\( y \\)-intercept is a point where the graph intersects the \\( y \\)-axis. At any \\( y \\)-intercept, the value of \\( x \\) is \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation**\n\nSet \\( x = 0 \\) and solve for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation for \\( y \\)**\n\nThe equation is a quadratic in the form \\( ay^2 + by + c = 0 \\), where:\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n- \\( b = -4 \\)\n- \\( c = -1 \\)\n\nUse the quadratic formula"
