I know that when a fraction's denominator isn't a product of 2s and 5s, the decimal will be repeating. \n\nNext, I'll perform the division of 31 by 11111. This means dividing 31.000000... by 11111.12\n\nAfter performing the division manually, I find that 31 divided by 11111 gives a decimal that repeats every 10 digits. The result is approximately 0.00279922190279922...\n\nTo determine the length of the repeating part, I count the digits in the repeating sequence, which in this case is 10 digits long.\n\nTherefore, the repeating decimal has 10 digits repeating.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   \n   When a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) has a denominator \\(b\\) that isn't a product of only 2s and 5s, the decimal expansion will be repeating. The length of the repeating part (period) depends on the numerator and the denominator.\n\n2. **Perform the Division:**\n   \n   Divide 31 by 11111:\n   \\[\n   31 \\div 11111 = 0.0027992219027992219\\ldots\n   \\]\n   The repeating sequence starts after the decimal point and repeats every 10 digits.\n\n3. **Identify the Repeating Sequence:**\n   \n   Observing the decimal expansion:\n   \\[\n   0.\\overline{0027992219}\n   \\]\n   The digits \"0027992219\" repeat indefinitely.\n\n4. **Determine the Length of the Repeating Part:**\n   \n   Count the digits in the repeating sequence:\n   \\[\n   0.\\overline{0027992219} \\quad \\text{(10 digits)}\n   \\]\n   \n   Therefore, **10 digits** repeat in the decimal expansion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(\\boxed{10}\\)"
