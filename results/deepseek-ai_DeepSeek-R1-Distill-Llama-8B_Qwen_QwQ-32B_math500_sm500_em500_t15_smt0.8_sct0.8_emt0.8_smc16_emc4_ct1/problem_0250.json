            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) to a decimal, I will first perform the division of 31 by 11111. This involves determining how many whole times 11111 fits into 31, which is less than once.\n\nNext, I will calculate the decimal part by subtracting the whole number part from 31 and then dividing by 11111. This gives me a decimal that starts with 0.00281...\n\nTo identify the repeating part of the decimal, I'll multiply the initial non-repeating decimal by 10 and subtract it from the original decimal. This process will help me pinpoint the length of the repeating sequence.\n\nAfter applying this method, I find that the repeating decimal is 0.002819437... with a repeating sequence of three digits: 819. Therefore, the number of digits that repeat in the decimal is three.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the repeating decimal of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Decimal Conversion:**\n   When converting a fraction to a decimal, repeated decimals occur when the denominator (after simplifying the fraction) has prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n2. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111}\n   \\]\n   Since 31 is a prime number and does not divide evenly into 11111, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Find the Length of the Repeating Sequence:**\n   The number of repeating digits in the decimal can be found using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of repeating digits} = \\text{Order of 10 modulo } d\n   \\]\n   where \\(d\\) is the co-prime part of the denominator.\n\n4. **Determine \\(d\\):**\n   \\[\n   11111 = 27 \\times 410 + 1\n   \\]\n   Since 11111 is a prime number, \\(d = 11111\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Repeating Length:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Repeating length} = \\text{Order of 10 modulo } 11111\n   \\]\n   This requires finding the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   10^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11111}\n   \\]\n   Through mathematical computation, it"
