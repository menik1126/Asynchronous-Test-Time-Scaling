I know that 256 is a power of 2, specifically \\(2^8\\). So, I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll simplify the right side using the power of a power property, which states that \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). Applying this gives me \\(2^{2x} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow both sides of the equation have the same base, which is 2. Since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal as well. Therefore, \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, resulting in \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a power of 2:**\n   \n   Recognize that \\(256 = 2^8\\). So,\n   \\[\n   256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \n   Now, rewrite the original equation with the simplified right side:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = \\boxed{2}\n   \\]"
