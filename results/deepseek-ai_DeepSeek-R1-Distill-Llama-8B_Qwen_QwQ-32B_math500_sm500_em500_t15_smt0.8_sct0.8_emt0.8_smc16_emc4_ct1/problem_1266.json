I remember that when dealing with exponents, it can be helpful to express both sides with the same base if possible. \n\nFirst, let me look at the right side of the equation, \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\). I know that taking something to the power of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is the same as finding its square root. So, what's the square root of 256? Well, 16 times 16 is 256, so the square root of 256 is 16. Got that, so the equation simplifies to \\(2^{2x} = 16\\).\n\nNow, both sides of the equation have base 2. On the left side, the base is already 2, and the exponent is \\(2x\\). On the right side, I can express 16 as a power of 2. Let me think: 2 to the 4th power is 16 because \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\\). So, 16 is \\(2^4\\). Therefore, the equation now becomes \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n\nSince the bases are equal (both are base 2), the exponents must be equal as well. So, I can set \\(2x = 4\\). Then, to solve for x, I just divide both sides by 2. \n\n\\(2x = 4\\)  \nDividing both sides by 2:  \n\\(x = \\frac{4}{2}\\)  \n\\(x = 2\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I plug x = 2 back into the original equation, does it hold true?\n\nLeft side: \\(2^{2x}\\)  \nIf x=2, then \\(2^{2*2} = 2^4 = 16\\).\n\nRight side: \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{256} = 16\\).\n\nYes, both sides equal 16, so x = 2 is indeed the correct solution. I think that's it. There are no steps I missed, and"
