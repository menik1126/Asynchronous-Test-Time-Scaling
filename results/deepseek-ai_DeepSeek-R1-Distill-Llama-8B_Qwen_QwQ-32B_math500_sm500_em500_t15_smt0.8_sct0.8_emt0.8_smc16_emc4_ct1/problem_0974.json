Denali walks 16 dogs, and Nate walks 12 dogs.\n\nNext, let's express their pay based on the number of dogs they walk. Assume the pay per dog is \\( p \\). Therefore, Denali's pay is \\( 16p \\) and Nate's pay is \\( 12p \\).\n\nUnder the new policy, Denali's dogs are adjusted by \\( 4x \\). This means Denali would walk \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs. At the same time, all of Nate's dogs are kept the same at 12.\n\nFor the second scenario, \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. This means Denali would walk \\( 16 + x \\) dogs, and Nate would walk \\( 12 - x \\) dogs.\n\nSetting up the ratio equations from both scenarios:\n\n1. Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains the same:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16p}{12p} = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{16 + 4x}{12}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 12 = 3 \\times (16 + 4x) \\\\\n   48 = 48 + 12x \\\\\n   12x = 0 \\\\\n   x = 0\n   \\]\n   However, \\( x \\neq 0 \\), so this scenario isn't possible under the first condition.\n\n2. For the second condition:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{16p}{12p} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the ratio:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n   \\]\n   Cross-multiplying gives:\n   \\[\n   4(12 - x) = 3(16 + x) \\\\\n   48 - 4x = 48 + 3x \\\\\n   -7x = 7 \\\\\n   x = -1\n   \\]\n   Since \\( x \\) represents a number of dogs, it should be positive.

So, perhaps I need to set the two ratios equal to each other?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem. The problem says the ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay would be the same in both scenarios. So, the ratio when Denali takes 4x more dogs (and Nate stays at 12) must equal the ratio when x dogs are moved from Nate to Denali.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nAh, that's the key step I missed earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSetting the two ratios equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = 12(16 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n16*12 -16x +48x -4x² = 12*16 +12x\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nLeft side: 192 + 32x -4x²\n\nRight side: 192 +12x\n\nSubtracting right side from both sides:\n\n(192 +32x -4x²) - (192 +12x) =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n20x -4x² =0\n\nFactor:\n\n4x(5 -x)=0\n\nSolutions: x=0 or x=5\n\nSince x≠0, the answer is 5.\n\nWait, so that's different from my previous steps. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me redo the cross-multiplication step carefully.\n\nLeft side after expansion:\n\n(16)(12) + (16)(-x) + (4x)(12) + (4x)(-x) = 192 -16x +48x -4x² = 192 +32x -4x²\n\nRight side: 12*(16 +x) = 192 +12x\n\nSet equal:\n\n192"
