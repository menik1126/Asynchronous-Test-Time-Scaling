In this case, Denali will be walking \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs, and Nate will continue to walk 12 dogs. The ratio of their pays should remain the same as the initial ratio.\n\nNext, let's consider the second scenario where \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. This means Denali will be walking \\( 16 + x \\) dogs, and Nate will be walking \\( 12 - x \\) dogs. Again, the ratio of their pays should remain the same.\n\nBy setting these ratios equal to each other, we can create an equation to solve for \\( x \\).\n\nFinally, solving the equation will give us the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies both scenarios.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Variables**\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of dogs that are reassigned in a group.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Pay Ratio**\n\n- Denali is initially responsible for 16 dogs.\n- Nate is initially responsible for 12 dogs.\n  \nThe ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay is:\n  \n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Denali's Pay}}{\\text{Nate's Pay}} = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: First Scenario - Denali Walks \\( 4x \\) More Dogs**\n\n- Denali walks \\( 16 + 4x \\) dogs.\n- Nate continues to walk 12 dogs.\n  \nThe new ratio of their pay is:\n  \n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Set Up the Equation**\n\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 12 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n"
