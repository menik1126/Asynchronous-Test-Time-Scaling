It has multiple terms on the left side with denominators that are quadratic, and on the right side, it's a linear term minus a constant. I need to find all complex solutions and sum them up. \n\nAlright, let me start by breaking down the equation. Each term on the left has the form \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\), where \\(n\\) is 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe I can rewrite each term in a different way to make it easier to handle. \n\nI remember that partial fractions can sometimes help with expressions like this. Partial fractions involve breaking down complex fractions into simpler ones. Let me try that.\n\nFor each term, I can express it as a sum of two fractions: one with a linear term and one with a constant term. For example, for the first term, \\(\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1}\\), which factors as \\(\\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x + 1)}\\). Using partial fractions, I can write it as \\(\\frac{A}{x - 1} + \\frac{B}{x + 1}\\). \n\nSolving for A and B:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(x - 1)(x + 1)} = \\frac{A}{x - 1} + \\frac{B}{x + 1}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\):\n\n\\[\n1 = A(x + 1) + B(x - 1)\n\\]\n\nTo find A and B, I can plug in suitable x-values. Let me set \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n1 = A(1 + 1) + B(1 - 1) \\Rightarrow 1 = 2A \\Rightarrow A = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, set \\(x = -1\\):\n\n\\[\n1 = A(-1 + 1) +"

Let me try the second term, \\(\\frac{2}{x^2 - 2}\\). \n\nSimilarly, \\(x^2 - 2\\) factors into \\((x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})\\). Let me write it as partial fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{(x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{C}{x - \\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{D}{x + \\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n2 = C(x + \\sqrt{2}) + D(x - \\sqrt{2})\n\\]\n\nSet \\(x = \\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n2 = C(2\\sqrt{2}) + D(0) \\Rightarrow C = \\frac{2}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nSet \\(x = -\\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n2 = C(0) + D(-2\\sqrt{2}) \\Rightarrow D = \\frac{2}{-2\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nSo the second term becomes \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}(x - \\sqrt{2})} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}(x + \\sqrt{2})}\\).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit messy with the square roots. Maybe there's a better approach here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of partial fractions, I can consider substituting \\(y = x^2\\). Let me see. Let me denote \\(y = x^2\\).

So I don't think substituting \\(y = x^2\\) alone helps because x is still present on the RHS. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can combine all the terms on the left into a single fraction.

The denominators are \\(x^2 -1, x^2 -2, x^2 -3, x^2 -4\\).

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the function on the left and see if the right side is some linear function which it might intersect at certain points.\n\nWait, the left-hand side is a sum of functions that each have poles at x = \u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12. So, x cannot be any of these values because they would make the denominators zero.\n\nBut since the problem mentions complex solutions, perhaps that includes these poles as well? Wait, but if x is one of these values, the expression is undefined, so those points are not in the domain. So the equation has solutions only where the function is defined.\n\nBut I need to find all complex solutions.

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that each term is of the form n*(product over (x^2 -k) where k \u2260 n). Wait, actually, each term is n multiplied by the product of (x^2 - m) for m from 1 to 4 except m = n. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, first term is 1*(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). So that's n=1, so excluding 1, so terms 2,3,4. Similarly, second term is 2*(x^2 -1)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4), which is n=2, excluding 2.

So, that doesn't seem to help much.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can factor out P(x):\n\nSo, we have:\n\nP(x) [ \\sum_{n=1}^4 \\frac{n}{x^2 - n} - (2010x -4) ] = 0\n\nTherefore, the solutions are either when P(x) = 0 or when the bracket is zero.\n\nSo, first, let's solve P(x) = 0.\n\nP(x) = (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = \u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, \u00b1\u221a3, \u00b12.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, these are points where the original function is undefined because the denominators become zero. So, these cannot be solutions of the original equation.

But x=1 is excluded because denominator x^2 -1 becomes zero. Similarly, x=2 is excluded.\n\nHow about x= sqrt(5)? Let me see, but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me see the behavior as x approaches infinity. Let me consider x approaching infinity. Then, x^2 is large, so each term in S(x^2) is approximately n/(x^2). So, S(x^2) \u2248 (1 +2 +3 +4)/x^2 = 10/x^2. So, the left side tends to zero. The right side, 2010x -4, tends to infinity. Therefore, as x approaches infinity, the left side is approaching zero, and the right side is approaching infinity, so f(x) approaches negative infinity. Similarly, as x approaches negative infinity, the left side approaches zero, and the right side approaches negative infinity, so f(x) approaches positive infinity. \n\nTherefore, the function f(x) tends to negative infinity as x approaches positive infinity, and positive infinity as x approaches negative infinity.

Therefore, when we multiplied both sides by D, at x=0, the left side becomes -4 + something? Wait, no, at x=0, the original equation is -4 = -4, which is correct, but when we multiplied by D, the LHS becomes the sum of four terms each multiplied by D, but at x=0, it's -4*(D) = -4*24 = -96, and the RHS is (2010*0 -4)*D = (-4)*24 = -96.

The roots of this polynomial are the solutions of the original equation plus the poles. Since the original equation is a rational function equation, its solutions are the roots of the numerator (the polynomial equation) excluding the poles. Therefore, the number of solutions is 9 - 8 =1?
