Let me try to break it down step by step. The equation involves fractions on the left side and a linear term on the right. I need to find all the complex solutions and sum them up. \n\nFirst, I notice that each term on the left has a similar structure: a constant numerator and a denominator that's a quadratic expression. Specifically, each denominator is of the form \\( x^2 - k \\) where \\( k \\) is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Maybe I can rewrite each term in a way that makes it easier to handle. \n\nI remember that partial fractions can sometimes help with equations like this. Let me recall that partial fraction decomposition is a method used to express a complicated rational function as a sum of simpler ones. In this case, each term is already a simple fraction, but perhaps there's a way to combine them or manipulate the equation to simplify it.\n\nLooking closer, each denominator is a difference of squares, so they can be factored. Let me write that out:\n\n- \\( x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1) \\)\n- \\( x^2 - 2 = (x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2}) \\)\n- \\( x^2 - 3 = (x - \\sqrt{3})(x + \\sqrt{3}) \\)\n- \\( x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2) \\)\n\nSo each denominator factors into two linear terms. However, considering that each term has a different denominator, directly combining them seems challenging. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the equation as a whole. The left side is the sum of four rational functions, each with a different denominator. The right side is a linear function of x, specifically \\( 2010x - 4 \\). To solve such an equation, perhaps I can find a common denominator for all the terms on the left and then set the numerator equal to the"

Multiplying both sides by this common denominator would lead to a very high-degree polynomial equation. Let me see how that would work.\n\nLet me denote the left-hand side (LHS) as:\n\n\\[\nLHS = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4}\n\\]\n\nand the right-hand side (RHS) as:\n\n\\[\nRHS = 2010x - 4\n\\]\n\nSo, if I multiply both sides by the common denominator \\( D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \\), then:\n\n\\[\nD \\cdot LHS = D \\cdot RHS\n\\]\n\nThe left side would become:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)\n\\]\n\nAnd the right side would be:\n\n\\[\n(2010x - 4) \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\n\\]\n\nThis looks extremely messy. Expanding all of these terms would result in a polynomial of degree 8 on the left and degree 9 on the right (since the RHS has a linear term multiplied by a degree 8 polynomial).

I remember from algebra that for polynomials, the sum of the roots can be found using Vieta's formula, which relates the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of its roots.\n\nSo, maybe instead of trying to solve for x directly, I can find the polynomial equation that results from bringing everything to one side and then apply Vieta's formula to find the sum of all its roots. \n\nLet me denote the entire equation as:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = (2010x - 4) \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) - \\left[1 \\cdot (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 4) + 4 \\cdot (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)\\right] = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( P(x) = 0 \\) is a ninth-degree polynomial.

The leading term on the RHS when expanded is \\( 2010x \\cdot x^8 = 2010x^9 \\), and on the LHS, the highest degree term is when we expand each term on the right side of the original equation. Each term on the LHS is a product of three quadratic terms, so each is degree 6. When subtracted, the highest degree term would be \\( -1 \\cdot (x^2)^3 = -x^6 \\) for the first term, similarly for the others. So when combined, the overall highest degree should be 9 from the RHS, so when subtracted, the highest degree term would be 9, making the polynomial degree 9.\n\nSo \\( P(x) \\) is a ninth-degree polynomial, and we can use Vieta's formula to find the sum of all its roots.

Let's find the coefficient of \\( x^8 \\) in this term.\n\nFirst, the expansion of \\( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \\) will give a polynomial of degree 8 with coefficients corresponding to symmetric sums. The coefficient of \\( x^8 \\) is 1, as I said earlier.\n\nWait, actually, when I multiply four quadratic terms, the leading term is \\( x^8 \\), and the coefficient is positive 1. Now, when we multiply by \\( 2010x \\), this becomes \\( 2010x \\cdot x^8 = 2010x^9 \\) as before. \n\nBut we need the coefficient of \\( x^8 \\) in the entire first term, which is \\( 2010x \\cdot [x^8 + ...] \\).

Therefore, the polynomial \\( (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4) \\) is an even function, so it only has even powers of x.

Let me recap.\n\nThe original equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by the common denominator \\( D = (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot (x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -4) + 4 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3) = (2010x -4)D.\n\\]\n\nWhich, when moved to one side, gives:\n\n\\[\n(2010x -4)D - [\\text{sum of terms}] = 0.\n\\]\n\nSo, this is a 9th-degree polynomial, as D is degree 8, times (2010x -4), giving degree 9. So, the equation is 9th-degree. However, when we moved everything to the left, the highest degree term comes from the leading term of (2010x -4) multiplied by D's leading term.\n\nBut the equation \\( P(x) = 0 \\) includes all solutions of the original equation, but also the solutions that make D zero, i.e., \\( x = \\pm1, \\pm\\sqrt{2}, \\pm\\sqrt{3}, \\pm2 \\). But at these x-values, the original equation is undefined, so they are not solutions. Therefore, \\( P(x) = 0 \\) has 9 roots, 8 of which are extraneous (the roots of D, which are \\("

Wait, but that would mean the original equation has only one solution? That seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original equation could have multiple solutions, but when multiplied by D, the equation becomes 9th-degree, so there are 9 roots total, but 8 of them are extraneous. Therefore, the original equation has 1 solution. But that seems odd. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply both sides by D, you can introduce extraneous roots, but the number of solutions can vary. The original equation is equivalent to \\( P(x) = 0 \\) except at the points where D is zero. Therefore, the solutions of the original equation are exactly the roots of \\( P(x) = 0 \\) that are not roots of D. Since D has 8 roots, the original equation can have up to 9 - 8 = 1 solution. But that would mean the original equation has only one solution? Hmm, but the equation is a rational equation with denominators of degree 2 each, so when cleared, it's a high-degree equation, but perhaps the right-hand side is linear, so maybe the equation balances out to have only one solution? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake is in the degree of the polynomial. Let me check again.\n\nThe left-hand side, when multiplied by D, gives a sum of four terms each of degree 6 (since each term is (x^2 - ...) multiplied three times, so 3*2=6). Therefore, the left side after multiplying by D is a sum of four degree 6 terms, so the left side is degree 6. The right side is (2010x -4)*D, which is degree 9. Therefore, moving everything to the left gives:\n\n(2010x -4)*D - [sum of degree 6 terms] = 0.\n\nTherefore, the leading term is 2010x * x^8 = 2010x^9, so the equation is indeed 9th-degree. Therefore, there are 9 roots in total. The roots of D (the denominators) are 8 roots, so the remaining root is the solution to the original equation"

So, the original equation has one solution among the roots of P(x)=0, the other 8 roots being extraneous.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions to the original equation is equal to the sum of all roots of P(x) = 0, excluding the 8 roots that make D zero. But earlier, I found that the sum of all roots of P(x)=0 is 2/1005. Also, the sum of the extraneous roots is zero, as each extraneous root is paired with its negative, like x and -x, so their sum is zero. Therefore, the sum of all solutions to the original equation is equal to the sum of all roots of P(x)=0, since the sum of the extraneous roots is zero. \n\nWait, that seems conflicting with the previous conclusion. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when P(x) = 0 has 9 roots. Among these 9 roots, 8 of them are the roots of D, i.e., \\( x = \\pm1, \\pm\\sqrt{2}, \\pm\\sqrt{3}, \\pm2 \\). The sum of these 8 roots is:\n\n\\( 1 + (-1) + \\sqrt{2} + (-\\sqrt{2}) + \\sqrt{3} + (-\\sqrt{3}) + 2 + (-2) = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the remaining root, which is the solution to the original equation, has value S. Then, the sum of all roots of P(x)=0 is S + 0 = S. On the other hand, Vieta's formula tells us that the sum of all roots (9 of them) is 2/1005.\n\nSo, Vieta says sum of roots is 2/1005, which is equal to S + 0, hence S = 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions of the original equation is S = 2/1005.\n\nWait, so that seems to be the answer. But let me see if that makes sense. If the polynomial is of degree 9, but only one of its roots is a solution to the original equation, and that root is 2/1005, but that seems too simple. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that if all the extraneous roots sum to zero, then the desired sum is equal to"

Therefore, the answer is indeed 2/1005. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the coefficients. Let me recheck the coefficients of x^9 and x^8 in P(x).\n\nFirst, the leading term of P(x) is 2010x^9, so coefficient a_9 = 2010.\n\nThe coefficient of x^8 comes from two places:\n\n1. The term from (2010x -4)*D:\n\nThe term from -4*D will contribute to x^8. Since D has a term x^8 with coefficient 1, so -4*1 = -4.\n\nThe term from 2010x multiplied by the coefficient of x^7 in D. But D is a product of four quadratics, so it's a degree 8 polynomial in x^2. Therefore, D has only even exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of x^7 in D is zero. Therefore, the contribution from 2010x * x^7 is zero. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^8 in P(x) is indeed -4.\n\nTherefore, Vieta's formula gives the sum of roots as -(-4)/2010 = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the sum is 0, but I don't see why. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when applying Vieta's formula. Let me recall Vieta's formula:\n\nFor a polynomial \\( P(x) = a_9x^9 + a_8x^8 + ... + a_0 \\), the sum of roots is -a_8/a_9. \n\nIn our case, a_9 = 2010, a_8 = -4. Therefore, sum is -(-4)/2010 = 4/2010 = 2/1005. \n\nTherefore, I think that is correct. \n\nWait, but let me think of an example. Suppose I have an equation like 1/(x - 1) = 1/x. Then multiplying both sides by x(x-1) gives x ="
