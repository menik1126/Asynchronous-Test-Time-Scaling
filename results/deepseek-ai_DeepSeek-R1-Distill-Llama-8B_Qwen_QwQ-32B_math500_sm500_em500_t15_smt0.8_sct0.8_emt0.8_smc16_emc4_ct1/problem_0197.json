Alright, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials, especially lower-degree ones, the Rational Root Theorem can be useful. But this is a quartic, which is degree 4, so it might have more roots, but we\u2019re only looking for integer ones. Maybe I can try factoring it or testing possible integer roots.\n\nWait, the question specifically asks for integer roots, so maybe I don't need to go into synthetic division or anything like that. Let me recall, the possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients are fractions where the numerator is a factor of the constant term and the denominator is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So the possible rational roots are the factors of -14, which are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114. Since we're looking for integer roots, that narrows it down to these values.\n\nSo perhaps I can test each of these possible roots by plugging them into the equation and seeing if the value equals zero. Let me start with the easiest ones.\n\nFirst, test x = 1:\n\n\\(1^4 + 5*1^3 + 9*1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = (1+5) + (9-1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0\\). Oh, wow, that worked! So x = 1 is a root.\n\nSince x = 1 is a root, I can factor out (x - 1) from the polynomial. Let me do polynomial division or use synthetic division to find the other factors.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 1:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant)\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 1: 1, add to next coefficient: 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nMultiply 6 by 1: 6, add to next coefficient: 9 + 6"

Perfect, so the result is:\n\n\\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\). \n\nSo now the original polynomial factors as (x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14). Now I need to factor the cubic polynomial \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\). Let me see if this cubic has any integer roots. Again, using the Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 14 over 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, \u00b114.\n\nLet me test x = -1 first:\n\n(-1)^3 +6*(-1)^2 +15*(-1) +14 = -1 +6*1 + (-15) +14 = -1 +6 -15 +14. Let's compute step by step: (-1 +6)=5, (5 -15)= -10, (-10 +14)=4. Not zero. Hmm.\n\nNext, x = -2:\n\n(-2)^3 +6*(-2)^2 +15*(-2) +14 = -8 +6*4 + (-30) +14 = -8 +24 -30 +14. Let's see: (-8 +24)=16, (16 -30)= -14, (-14 +14)=0. Oh, that works! So x = -2 is another root.\n\nTherefore, we can factor out (x +2) from the cubic. Let's perform synthetic division again on the cubic with root -2.\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^3), 6 (x^2), 15 (x), 14 (constant)\n\nUsing synthetic division with -2:\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -2: -2, add to next coefficient: 6 + (-2)=4.\n\nMultiply 4 by -2: -8, add to next coefficient:15 + (-8)=7.\n\nMultiply 7 by -2:"

Perfect, so the cubic factors as (x +2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n(x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7). \n\nNow, the quadratic factor is \\(x^2 +4x +7\\). Let me check if this has any real roots, because if it does, they might be irrational, but since we need integer roots, maybe they aren't. Let's compute the discriminant: \\(D = b^2 -4ac = 16 - 28 = -12\\). Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots, let alone integer ones. So the only integer roots are x =1 and x= -2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check whether I've considered all possible roots. Did I test all the possible candidates? I tested x=1 and x=-2, but maybe I should test the others just to be sure.\n\nTesting x=2 in the original equation:\n\n2^4 +5*2^3 +9*2^2 -2 -14 =16 +40 +36 -2 -14.
