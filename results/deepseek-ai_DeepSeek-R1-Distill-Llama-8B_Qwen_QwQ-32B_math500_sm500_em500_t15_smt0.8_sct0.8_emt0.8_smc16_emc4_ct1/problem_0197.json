I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem from algebra. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients is of the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, that simplifies things a bit because q, which is a factor of 1, can only be \u00b11. That means any rational root is actually an integer that divides -14.\n\nAlright, so the possible integer roots are the factors of -14. Let me list those out. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, 14, and their negative counterparts: -1, -2, -7, -14. So, the possible integer roots are: 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.\n\nNow, I need to test each of these potential roots by plugging them into the polynomial equation and seeing if it equals zero. Maybe I can start with the smaller numbers first because they are easier to compute.\n\nLet me start with x=1. Plugging that in:\n\n1\u2074 + 5*(1)\u00b3 + 9*(1)\u00b2 -1 -14 = 1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14. Let's compute that step by step.\n\n1 + 5 is 6. 6 + 9 is 15. 15 -1 is 14. 14 -14 is 0. Oh, so x=1 is a root! Great, that's one root found.\n\nNow, since x=1 is a root, I can factor out (x - 1) from the polynomial. But since it's a quartic (degree 4), factoring it might be a bit time-consuming. Maybe there's another root that's also an integer. Let me test the other possible candidates.\n\nNext, let's try x=-1.\n\n(-1)^4 + 5*(-1)^3 + 9*(-1)^2 - (-1) -14 = "

So, let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nAlternatively, I can factor the quartic as (x -1)(x + 2)(quadratic polynomial). Let me try this approach.\n\nLet me set the quartic equal to (x -1)(x + 2)(ax\u00b2 + bx + c). Since the leading term of the quartic is x\u2074, multiplying (x)(x)(ax\u00b2) gives a x\u2074, so a must be 1.\n\nSo, (x -1)(x + 2)(x\u00b2 + bx + c). Let me expand this to match the original polynomial.\n\nFirst, multiply (x -1)(x + 2):\n\n(x -1)(x + 2) = x\u00b2 + 2x -x -2 = x\u00b2 + x -2.\n\nNow, multiply this by (x\u00b2 + bx + c):\n\n(x\u00b2 + x -2)(x\u00b2 + bx + c) = x\u00b2*(x\u00b2 + bx + c) + x*(x\u00b2 + bx + c) -2*(x\u00b2 + bx + c)\n\n= x\u2074 + bx\u00b3 + cx\u00b2 + x\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx -2x\u00b2 -2bx -2c\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nx\u2074 + (b +1)x\u00b3 + (c + b -2)x\u00b2 + (c - 2b)x -2c.\n\nNow, set this equal to the original polynomial: x\u2074 +5x\u00b3 +9x\u00b2 -x -14.\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\n1. x\u2074: 1 = 1 (OK)\n2. x\u00b3: b +1 =5 \u21d2 b=4\n3. x\u00b2: c + b -2 =9.
