            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about triangle ABC where the area is given as a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2, and I need to find tan A. Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that the area of a triangle can be expressed in several ways, one of which is (1/2)*base*height. But since I need to relate this to the sides a, b, and c, maybe I should use another formula for the area, like Heron's formula or perhaps the formula involving sine of an angle.\n\nWait, actually, the area can also be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A, where b and c are two sides, and A is the included angle between them. So, maybe I can set this equal to the given area expression and then solve for sin A and cos A, which will help me find tan A.\n\nAlright, let's write down what I know. The area is given by:\n\nArea = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2\n\nBut I also know that the area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, equating these two expressions:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = a\u00b2 - (b - c)\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to simplify the right-hand side. Let me expand (b - c)\u00b2 first. That would be b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2. So, substituting back:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = a\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2)\n= a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2bc - c\u00b2\n\nHmm, let's rearrange that:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2bc\n\nWait a second, I also remember the Law of Cosines, which says that a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A. Maybe I can substitute a\u00b2 from the Law of Cosines into the equation above. Let me try that.\n\nSubstituting a\u00b2:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A) - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2bc\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*cos A) - b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + 2bc\n= b\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - c\u00b2"

Maybe I can write sin A in terms of cos A and then use the Pythagorean identity sin\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 1 to solve for cos A.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nsin A = 4 - 4*cos A\n\nNow, let's square both sides to eliminate the sine term:\n\nsin\u00b2 A = (4 - 4*cos A)\u00b2\nsin\u00b2 A = 16 - 32*cos A + 16*cos\u00b2 A\n\nNow, we know that sin\u00b2 A = 1 - cos\u00b2 A, so substitute that in:\n\n1 - cos\u00b2 A = 16 - 32*cos A + 16*cos\u00b2 A\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n0 = 16 - 32*cos A + 16*cos\u00b2 A - 1 + cos\u00b2 A\nSimplify:\n\n16 - 1 = 15\n-32*cos A remains as is\n16*cos\u00b2 A + cos\u00b2 A = 17*cos\u00b2 A\n\nSo:\n\n0 = 15 - 32*cos A + 17*cos\u00b2 A\n\nLet's rewrite this as a quadratic equation in cos A:\n\n17*cos\u00b2 A - 32*cos A + 15 = 0\n\nNow, let's solve for cos A using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form a*cos\u00b2 + b*cos + c = 0, so:\n\ncos A = [32 \u00b1 sqrt(32\u00b2 - 4*17*15)] / (2*17)\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\n32\u00b2 = 1024\n4*17*15 = 1020\nSo discriminant = 1024 - 1020 = 4\n\nThus,\n\ncos A = [32 \u00b1"

So we discard that and take cos A = 15/17.\n\nNow, since sin A = 4 - 4*cos A, we can compute sin A as:\n\nsin A = 4 - 4*(15/17) = 4 - (60/17) = (68/17 - 60/17) = 8/17\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\nWait, 4 is 68/17, so 68/17 - 60/17 is indeed 8/17.\n\nSo now, we have sin A = 8/17 and cos A = 15/17. Therefore, tan A = sin A / cos A = (8/17) / (15/17) = 8/15.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if everything makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me think again about how I substituted a\u00b2. From Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A. So when I substituted a\u00b2 in the area formula, I should have:\n\nArea = a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2 = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A) - (b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2)\n= b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A - b\u00b2 + 2bc - c\u00b2\n= (-2bc cos A) + 2bc\n= 2bc (1 - cos A)\n\nYes, that's correct. Then I equated that to (1/2)bc sin A:\n\n2bc (1 - cos A) = (1/2) bc sin A\n\nDivided both sides by bc (assuming bc \u2260 0, which they aren't in a triangle), gives:\n\n2(1 - cos A) = (1/2) sin A\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 4(1 - cos A) = sin A\nSo, sin A = 4(1 - cos"

Then I followed through correctly to find cos A = 15/17, which leads to sin A = 8/17, so tan A = 8/15.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check: area = a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2, so I can check if that makes sense with the area being (1/2) bc sin A.\n\nLet me plug in the values to confirm.\n\nSuppose a, b, c are sides such that cos A = 15/17, so angle A is acute since cos A is positive.\n\nSo, using Law of Cosines, a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(15/17)\nSimilarly, (b - c)^2 = b\u00b2 - 2bc + c^2\n\nThen a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2 = [b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 30bc/17] - [b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2] = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 30bc/17) - b\u00b2 + 2bc - c\u00b2 = (-30bc/17) + 2bc = 2bc - 30bc/17 = (34bc - 30bc)/17 = (4bc)/17\n\nOn the other hand, the area is (1/2) bc sin A. We found sin A = 8/17, so area is (1/2) bc*(8/17) = (4 bc)/17\n\nYes, that matches. So the given area is indeed a\u00b2 - (b - c)^2 = (4 bc)/17, which is equal to the area (1/2) bc sin A, since 4 bc /17 = (1/2) bc*(8/17). So the calculations are consistent.\n\nThus, I can be confident that tan A is 8/15, so the answer is 8/15.\n</think>\n\nThe area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is given by \\(a^2 - (b - c)^2\\).
