            "output": "Alright, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a quadratic polynomial P(x) with real coefficients. The problem states that for all real numbers x, the value of P(x) is sandwiched between two other quadratics: x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3. Additionally, we know that P(11) = 181. We need to find P(16).\n\nFirst, let's write down what we know. P(x) is a quadratic, so it must have the form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. Our goal is to find the coefficients a, b, and c so that we can compute P(16).\n\nWe also know that P(x) is squeezed between two other quadratics for all real x. That means:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nSince both sides are quadratic functions, this inequality must hold for all x. For this to be true, P(x) must be exactly equal to one of these functions or lie between them. But since it's a quadratic sandwiched between two other quadratics, it's likely that P(x) is either the average or a linear combination of both. However, since both x² - 2x + 2 and 2x² - 4x + 3 are quadratics, their difference might be linear or a constant, which could help us find the coefficients.\n\nLet me subtract the lower bound from the upper bound to see what we get:\n\n[2x² - 4x + 3] - [x² - 2x + 2] = x² - 2x + 1\n\nSo, the difference between the upper and lower bound is x² - 2x + 1, which factors as (x - 1)². That's interesting because the square is always non-negative, which makes sense since for each x, the upper bound is above the lower bound.\n\nNow, since P(x) lies between these two quadratics, maybe P(x) is the mid-point between them? Let me see. If we take the average of the two quadratics:\n\nP(x) = (x² - 2x + 2 + 2x² - 4x"

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that P(x) is exactly halfway—it just has to be between them. So maybe there's another approach here.\n\nAlternatively, since both inequalities have to hold for all real x, the difference between P(x) and the lower bound must always be non-negative, and the difference between the upper bound and P(x) must also be non-negative for all x.\n\nLet me denote Q(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) and R(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x). Both Q(x) and R(x) must be non-negative for all real x.\n\nSince Q(x) and R(x) are quadratic polynomials (because P(x) is quadratic and the other terms are quadratic), their coefficients must be such that they are always non-negative. This usually requires that they are perfect squares or have a leading coefficient positive and discriminant non-positive, so that they don't cross zero.\n\nStarting with Q(x):\n\nQ(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = [ax² + bx + c] - [x² - 2x + 2] = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\n\nSimilarly, R(x):\n\nR(x) = (2x² -4x +3) - P(x) = [2x² -4x +3] - [ax² +bx +c] = (2 - a)x² + (-4 -b)x + (3 -c)\n\nBecause both Q(x) and R(x) must be ≥ 0 for all real x, they must be non-negative definite quadratics. For a quadratic Ax² + Bx + C to be non-negative for all real x, we need A > 0 and discriminant D = B² - 4AC ≤ 0.\n\nSo, applying that to Q(x):\n\nFirst, coefficients:\n\nA_Q = (a - 1)\nB_Q = (b + 2)\nC_Q = (c - 2)\n\nConditions:\n\n1. a - 1 > 0 ⇒ a > 1\n2.

B_R² - 4*A_R*C_R ≤ 0\n\nSo from Q(x) and R(x) conditions:\n\nFrom Q: a > 1 and a < 2. So, a ∈ (1, 2).\n\nNow, let's write the discriminant conditions.\n\nFor Q(x):\n\nDiscriminant D_Q = (b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0\n\nFor R(x):\n\nDiscriminant D_R = (-4 - b)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0\n\nSo, we have these two inequalities:\n\n1. (b + 2)^2 - 4(a - 1)(c - 2) ≤ 0\n2. (-4 - b)^2 - 4(2 - a)(3 - c) ≤ 0\n\nAdditionally, we have P(11) = 181, so:\n\na*(11)^2 + b*(11) + c = 181\nWhich simplifies to:\n121a + 11b + c = 181\n\nSo now, we have three equations: the two discriminant inequalities and the equation from P(11)=181.\n\nBut this seems complicated because we have inequalities. Maybe we can think of this differently. Perhaps P(x) must touch both boundaries at some points? Or perhaps P(x) is exactly the average of the two, but earlier when I tried that, I saw that the average is (3x² -6x +5)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute (3x² -6x +5)/2:\n\n= (3/2)x² - 3x + 5/2\n\nLet me check if this satisfies the inequality:\n\nIs x² - 2x + 2 ≤ (3/2)x² - 3x +5/2 ≤ 2x² -4x +3?\n\nLet’s compute the lower bound:\n\nIs (3/2)x² -3x +5/2 ≥ x² -2x +2?\n\nSubtract x² -2x +2 from both sides"

Let's see if this is always non-negative.\n\nCompute discriminant: (-1)^2 - 4*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nSo this quadratic touches the x-axis at its vertex.

So if P(x) is the average, P(11)=151, which isn't the case here. So that suggests P(x) is not the average.\n\nHmm, so that idea doesn't work. So perhaps P(x) is not the average.

The difference between the upper and lower bounds is x² - 2x +1, which is (x-1)^2. So, we can express P(x) as the lower bound plus some multiple of this square.\n\nLet me try:\n\nLet’s assume that P(x) = (x² -2x +2) + t*(x² -2x +1), where t is a constant between 0 and 1.\n\nSo, P(x) = (1 + t)x² + (-2 - 2t)x + (2 + t)\n\nSimilarly, since P(11)=181, we can plug in x=11:\n\n(1 + t)*(121) + (-2 -2t)*11 + (2 + t) = 181\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1 + t)*121 = 121 + 121t\n\n(-2 -2t)*11 = -22 -22t\n\n(2 + t) = 2 + t\n\nAdd them all together:\n\n121 + 121t -22 -22t +2 + t = 121 -22 +2 + (121t -22t + t) = 101 + (100t + t) = 101 + 101t\n\nSet equal to 181:\n\n101 + 101t = 181\n\nSo, 101t = "
