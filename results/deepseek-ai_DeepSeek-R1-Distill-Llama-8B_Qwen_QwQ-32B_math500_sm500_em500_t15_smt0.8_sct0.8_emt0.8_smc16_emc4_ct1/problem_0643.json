            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here about a quadratic polynomial P(x) that's sandwiched between two other quadratic expressions for all real numbers x. The inequalities given are x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3. Additionally, I know that P(11) = 181, and I need to find P(16). \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand what's given and what's being asked. P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, so it has the general form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real coefficients that I need to determine. The inequalities tell me that for every x, P(x) is greater than or equal to x² - 2x + 2 and less than or equal to 2x² - 4x + 3. \n\nSince P(x) is a quadratic that lies between these two quadratics, it probably has the same leading coefficient as the larger of the two, but let me check that. The leading coefficient of the lower bound is 1 (from x²), and of the upper bound is 2 (from 2x²). So 2x² is larger than x² for all x except where the other terms might overtake, but since the upper bound is an upper limit, P(x) can't exceed that, so probably P(x) must have a leading coefficient of 2. That way, as x becomes very large in either the positive or negative direction, P(x) will behave like 2x², which is the upper bound. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Actually, for very large x, the term with the higher leading coefficient will dominate. So between x² and 2x², 2x² grows faster. So if P(x) is bounded above by 2x² - 4x + 3, then for large x, P(x) must approach 2x², right? So that suggests that P(x) is very similar to the upper bound for large x, maybe it's the same quadratic? But I'm told that the coefficients are real, so let's proceed.\n\nLet me denote P(x) = ax² + bx + c. So the inequalities given are:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ ax² + bx +"

Since they are quadratics themselves, their discriminants must be non-positive (so they don't cross the x-axis and stay non-negative). \n\nLet me write that out. Let me first compute P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2):\n\nP(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2).\n\nThis quadratic must be ≥ 0 for all x.

But let's see.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first quadratic: (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2) ≥ 0 for all x.\n\nSo for this quadratic to be non-negative for all x, the leading coefficient (a - 1) must be ≥ 0, and the discriminant must be ≤ 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the second quadratic: (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c) ≥ 0 for all x, so leading coefficient (2 - a) must be ≥ 0, and discriminant ≤ 0.\n\nTherefore, combining these two conditions on the leading coefficients"

So I might need another condition. Since P(x) is quadratic, and the inequalities must hold for all x, perhaps another condition is that the quadratics must touch the bounds at some specific points, but I don't have more points except P(11) = 181.\n\nHmm, P(x) is between two quadratics for all x, and I have a point that P(x) passes through: when x=11, P(11)=181. So maybe I can set up equations using this.\n\nLet me write the expressions for the bounds at x=11.\n\nLower bound: (11)^2 - 2*11 + 2 = 121 - 22 + 2 = 101.\n\nUpper bound: 2*(11)^2 -4*11 +3 = 2*121 -44 +3 = 242 -44 +3 = 201.\n\nTherefore, P(11) is between 101 and 201, and it's given as 181, which is exactly in the middle.

Alternatively, maybe the difference between P(x) and the lower bound is a perfect square, and similarly the difference between the upper bound and P(x) is also a perfect square. Since they are non-negative and have discriminant zero, that would make them perfect squares. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two quadratics (the differences) are both perfect squares, which would mean that their discriminants are zero. That might be the case here. Let me check that possibility.\n\nSuppose that P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) is a perfect square, so it can be written as k(x)^2, where k(x) is a linear function. Similarly, (2x² -4x +3) - P(x) is also a perfect square, say m(x)^2. \n\nIf that's the case, then both quadratics would have discriminant zero, so that would satisfy the discriminant conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are both multiples of squares, but since they are non-negative, perhaps they are squares.

So the sum of two squares equals (x -1)^2. Since squares are non-negative, each of them must be less than or equal to (x -1)^2. But how can two squares add up to another square?

For x=1, the right-hand side becomes zero, so the left-hand side must also be zero. Hence, (d*1 + e)^2 + (f*1 + g)^2 = 0. Since each square is non-negative, each must be zero. Therefore, d + e = 0 and f + g = 0.

Therefore, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is a perfect square, but that seems unlikely because P(x) is between both bounds. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I need to approach this differently. Let's think about the quadratics that are P(x) - (x² -2x +2) and (2x² -4x +3) - P(x). Since P(x) is squeezed between them, both expressions are non-negative for all x. Moreover, since P(x) is a quadratic, perhaps the two expressions have their discriminant zero, so that P(x) touches the bounds at exactly one point each. That would mean that the discriminants D1 and D2 are zero, making the quadratics perfect squares.\n\nWait, that might make sense.
