            "output": "First, I'll start by understanding the given fraction, which is 21 divided by the product of 2 squared and 5 to the seventh power. This means the denominator is 2² multiplied by 5⁷.\n\nNext, I'll calculate 2 squared, which equals 4, and 5 to the seventh power, which is 78,125. Multiplying these together gives the denominator 4 times 78,125, resulting in 312,500.\n\nWith the denominator known, I'll rewrite the fraction as 21 divided by 312,500. To convert this fraction into a decimal, I'll divide 21 by 312,500. This division yields 0.000067.\n\nFinally, to ensure the decimal terminates, I need to express it as a fraction over a power of 10. By multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 10,000,000, I get 670,000 divided by 3,125,000,000. This simplifies to 0.000067, a terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the Denominator:**\n   \\[\n   2^2 = 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5^7 = 78,125\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 4 \\times 78,125 = 312,500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express the Fraction with the Denominator as a Power of 10:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{312,500} = \\frac{21}{312,500}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{312,500} = 0.000067\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Decimal Terminates:**\n   The decimal terminates because the denominator \\(312,500\\) is a product of powers of 2 and 5 (specifically, \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\)), which are factors of 10.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.000067}\n\\]"
