            "output": "First, I'll start by understanding the given fraction: 21 divided by (2 squared times 5 to the seventh power). To convert this into a terminating decimal, I need to eliminate all the factors of 2 and 5 from the denominator.\n\nI notice that the denominator has 2 squared (which is 4) and 5 to the seventh power (which is 78125). The key is to manipulate the fraction so that the denominator becomes a power of 10, since a denominator with only 2s and 5s as prime factors will result in a terminating decimal.\n\nNext, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number to neutralize the factors of 2 and 5 in the denominator. Specifically, I need to multiply by 5 to the seventh power to account for the 5s in the denominator. This will raise 5^7 to 5^(7+1) = 5^8 in the denominator.\n\nAfter applying this multiplication, the denominator becomes 2^2 * 5^8, which simplifies to 10^8, a power of 10. This transformation ensures that the denominator will divide evenly into 100,000,000, making the decimal representation terminate.\n\nFinally, I'll perform the division of 21 by 100,000,000 to convert the fraction into a terminating decimal. This will give me 0.00000021 as the decimal equivalent.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 4 \\cdot 78125 = 312500\\).\n   - To make the denominator a power of 10, we need to eliminate the factors of 2 and 5.\n\n2. **Multiply Numerator and Denominator by \\(5^7\\):**\n   - Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(5^7\\) to neutralize the 5s in the denominator.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\times 5^7}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\times 5^7} = \\frac{21 \\times 5^7}{2^2 \\cdot 5^{14}} = \\frac{21 \\times 5^7}{10"

Since the denominator has \\(2^2\\) and \\(5^7\\), we multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^{5}\\) to get \\(2^7 \\cdot 5^7 = 10^7\\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21 \\times 2^5}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7 \\times 2^5} = \\frac{21 \\times 32}{10^7}\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(2^5 = 32\\), so the numerator becomes \\(21 \\times 32 = 672\\).\n   - The fraction simplifies to \\(\\frac{672}{10^7}\\).\n\n3. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   - Dividing by \\(10^7\\) moves the decimal point 7 places to the left:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{672}{10^7} = 0.0000672\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{0.0000672}\n\nWait, there's a mistake here.
