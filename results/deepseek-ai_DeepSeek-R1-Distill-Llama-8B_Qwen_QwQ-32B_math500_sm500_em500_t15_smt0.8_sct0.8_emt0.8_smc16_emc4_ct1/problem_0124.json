To do this, I'll divide the binary number into groups of three bits starting from the right.\n\nTaking the binary number 10101001110, I'll process it from the least significant bit (rightmost bit) to the left. \n\nStarting with the first three bits, 110, I'll convert this to decimal: 1\u00d72\u00b2 + 1\u00d72\u00b9 + 0\u00d72\u2070 = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6. \n\nNext, the second group of three bits is 101. Converting this to decimal: 1\u00d72\u00b2 + 0\u00d72\u00b9 + 1\u00d72\u2070 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5.\n\nThen, the third group of three bits is 010. Converting this to decimal: 0\u00d72\u00b2 + 1\u00d72\u00b9 + 0\u00d72\u2070 = 0 + 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nFinally, there's one remaining bit on the left, which is 1. I'll convert this to decimal as 1\u00d72\u2070 = 1.\n\nNow, I'll combine all the decimal values according to their place values in base eight: 1\u00d78\u2074 + 5\u00d78\u00b3 + 2\u00d78\u00b2 + 6\u00d78\u00b9 + 0\u00d78\u2070 = 4096 + 3280 + 512 + 48 + 0 = 7936.\n\nTherefore, the binary number 10101001110\u2082 is equal to 7936 in base eight.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide the binary number into groups of three bits from the right:**\n   ```\n   1 01 010 011 10\n   ```\n   - **Note:** If the total number of bits isn't divisible by three, pad the left side with leading zeros to make it so.\n\n2. **Convert each three-bit group to its decimal equivalent:**\n   - \\(110_2 = 6_{10}\\)\n   - \\(101_2 = 5_{10}\\)\n   - \\(010_2 = 2_{10}\\)\n   - \\(011_2 = 3_{10}\\)\n   - \\(10_2 = "

Let me correct it:\n\n**Correct Steps:**\n\n1. **Binary number:** \\(10101001110_2\\)\n2. **Group into three bits from the right:**\n   - \\(10\\ 101\\ 001\\ 110\\)\n   - Pad the leftmost group with a leading zero: \\(010\\ 101\\ 001\\ 110\\)\n3. **Convert each group:**\n   - \\(010_2 = 2_8\\)\n   - \\(101_2 = 5_8\\)\n   - \\(001_2 = 1_8\\)\n   - \\(110_2 = 6_8\\)\n4. **Combine:** \\(2\\ 5\\ 1\\ 6_8\\) \u2192 \\(2516_8\\)\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me re-express properly:\n\n**Final Correct Answer:**\n\nThe binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) is grouped as \\(001\\ 01"
