So, I'll identify each group of two binary digits.\n\nThe binary number can be broken down into the following hexadecimal pairs: 10, 10, 10, 01, 11, 10.\n\nNext, I'll convert each of these binary pairs to their corresponding hexadecimal values:\n\n- 10 in binary is equal to 2 in decimal, which is '2' in hexadecimal.\n- 10 in binary is again 2, so '2'.\n- 10 in binary is 2, so '2'.\n- 01 in binary is 1, so '1'.\n- 11 in binary is 3, so '3'.\n- 10 in binary is 2, so '2'.\n\nCombining all these, the hexadecimal representation of the binary number is 232132 in base eight.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship Between Binary and Octal:**\n   - Each digit in an octal number corresponds to **two bits** in a binary number.\n   - The binary digits are grouped into pairs starting from the right.\n\n2. **Split the Binary Number into Pairs:**\n   ```\n   10 10 10 01 11 10\n   ```\n\n3. **Convert Each Pair from Binary to Octal:**\n   - \\(10_2 = 2_{8}\\)\n   - \\(10_2 = 2_{8}\\)\n   - \\(10_2 = 2_{8}\\)\n   - \\(01_2 = 1_{8}\\)\n   - \\(11_2 = 3_{8}\\)\n   - \\(10_2 = 2_{8}\\)\n\n4. **Combine the Octal Digits:**\n   ```\n   2 3 2 1 3 2\n   ```\n\n5. **Write the Final Octal Number:**\n   ```\n   232132_8\n   ```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{232132_8}\n\\]"
