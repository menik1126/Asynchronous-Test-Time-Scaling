            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O. The rectangle has sides AB and AD, where AB divided by AD is equal to k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, or D. Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the rectangle. Rectangle ABCD has center O, so O is the intersection point of its diagonals. AB is the length of one side, and AD is the length of the adjacent side. The ratio of AB to AD is k, so AB = k * AD. I think I can assign some variables to make this easier. Maybe let AD = x, so AB would be kx. Then the rectangle has sides of length kx and x. That might help with calculations later.\n\nNow, I need to find the region within the rectangle where any point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. So essentially, I'm looking for the set of all points inside ABCD such that the distance from the point to O is less than the distance from the point to A, B, C, or D. The probability will then be the area of this region divided by the area of the entire rectangle.\n\nTo find this region, I should probably consider the inequalities that define it. For any point P inside the rectangle, the distance from P to O must be less than the distance from P to each vertex. Let me write down these inequalities.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates. Let's place the rectangle on a coordinate system with center O at (0, 0). Then, since AB is k times AD, if AD is x, AB is kx. So the rectangle extends from (-kx/2, -x/2) to (kx/2, x/2). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, if AB is the horizontal side and AD is the vertical side, then the rectangle's half-length is kx/2 along the x-axis and half of AD, which is x/2, along the y-axis.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should choose coordinates such that O is at (0, 0). Then, point A is at (-kx/2, x/2), point B at (kx/2, x/2), point C"

Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me set the rectangle with sides of length 2a and 2b, so that the center O is at (0,0), and the vertices are at (a, b), (-a, b), (-a, -b), and (a, -b). Wait, but then the sides would be 2a and 2b. Then the ratio AB/AD would be (2a)/(2b) = a/b. So if AB/AD = k, then a/b = k, so a = k*b. Maybe this is a better way to set it up because it's symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even simpler: Let me let the rectangle have length 2a along the x-axis and 2b along the y-axis, so that the sides are 2a and 2b. Then the center is at (0,0), and the vertices are at (a, b), (-a, b), (-a, -b), (a, -b). Then the ratio AB/AD would be (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So a = k*b. That might be a good way to set it up. Let me go with that.\n\nSo, let me define the rectangle with vertices at (a, b), (-a, b), (-a, -b), (a, -b), with a = k*b. The center is O(0,0). The problem is to find the region of points closer to O than to any vertex, then find the area of that region divided by the area of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, the area of the rectangle is (2a)*(2b) = 4ab. Since a = k*b, then the area is 4*(k*b)*b = 4k*b². But maybe I can just keep it as 4ab for now.\n\nNow, to find the region where the distance to O is less than the distance to each vertex.

But since the rectangle is symmetric, the regions closer to each vertex would be similar, but each inequality will be different. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, each inequality when considering a different vertex will give a different half-plane.

Let me just note that for each vertex, the condition that a point is closer to O than to that vertex will correspond to a linear inequality. So, for each vertex, I can write the inequality as I did before, and then the region where all four inequalities are satisfied simultaneously is the region of points closer to O than to any vertex.\n\nWait, but how can I be sure that all four inequalities must be satisfied? Because the point needs to be closer to O than to each of the four vertices. So for each vertex, the point must lie in the respective region where it's closer to O than to that vertex.\n\nSo, yes, the intersection of all four regions will give the locus of points where the distance to O is less than the distance to each vertex.\n\nHence, I need to find the intersection of four regions, each defined by an inequality.\n\nSo perhaps for each vertex, the region is a half-plane bounded by a line, and the intersection is a polygon.\n\nWait, each of these inequalities represents a half-plane, so the intersection would be a polygon, maybe a quadrilateral or some other shape. Alternatively, maybe it's a circle, but no, because each inequality is linear.\n\nWait, perhaps each inequality is a straight line, and the region where all inequalities hold is a convex polygon, maybe a quadrilateral or a triangle inside the rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a circle or an ellipse. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me test with an example. Let me take the rectangle as a square, which would mean k = 1, since AB/AD = 1. Then, in that case, the region where a point is closer to the center than to any of the four corners would be the interior of a circle centered at O with radius equal to half the distance from O to the corners. Wait, but in a square, O is the center, and each corner is at a distance of (sqrt(a² + b²)) times 2?

The distance to the corner (a,a) is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 ) = same distance. So, the point (a/2, a/2) is equidistant to O and the corner. So the boundary is exactly at that point.
