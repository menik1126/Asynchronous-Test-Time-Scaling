            "output": "First, I'll start by identifying the relationships between the different types of currency in Ink. It's given that 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets.\n\nNext, I'll convert Drinkets to Blinkets using the second relationship. Since 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, I can find the value of 1 Drinket by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which gives 1 Blinket equals approximately 0.4286 Drinkets. Therefore, 1 Drinket is equal to 0.4286 Blinkets.\n\nNow, I'll convert Drinkets to Trinkets by using the first relationship. Since 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets, I can divide the value of 1 Drinket in Blinkets by 4 to find how many Trinkets correspond to 1 Drinket. So, 0.4286 Blinkets divided by 4 equals approximately 0.1071 Trinkets per Drinket.\n\nFinally, to find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, I'll multiply the number of Drinkets by the Trinket equivalent per Drinket. That means 56 Drinkets multiplied by 0.1071 Trinkets per Drinket equals approximately 6 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nSure! Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Relationships**\n\n- **1 Trinket (T) = 4 Blinkets (B)**\n- **3 Blinkets (B) = 7 Drinkets (D)**\n\n### **Step 2: Convert Drinkets to Blinkets**\n\nFirst, we'll find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to 1 Drinket.\n\n\\[\n3\\,B = 7\\,D \\implies 1\\,B = \\frac{7}{3}\\,D\n\\]\n\nSo, **1 Drinket = \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\) Blinkets**.\n\n### **Step 3: Convert Blinkets to Trinkets**\n\nNow, use the first relationship to convert Blinkets to Trinkets.\n\n\\[\n1\\,T = 4\\,B \\implies 1\\,B = \\frac{1}{4}\\,T\n\\]\n\nSo, **1 Blinket = \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) Trinket"
