            "output": "I need to determine how far Bill is from his starting point after walking a certain distance east and south. To do this, I'll break down his movements into east and south components.\n\nFirst, Bill walks 1/2 mile south, which means he moves 1/2 mile south from his starting point. This gives him a southern displacement of 1/2 mile.\n\nNext, he walks 3/4 mile east. This means he is now 3/4 mile east of his starting point. So, his eastern displacement is 3/4 mile.\n\nFinally, he walks another 1/2 mile south, adding to his previous southern displacement. This brings his total southern displacement to 1 mile.\n\nNow, to find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. The straight-line distance forms a right-angled triangle where one leg is the total southern displacement (1 mile) and the other leg is his eastern displacement (3/4 mile).\n\nApplying the Pythagorean theorem:\nDistance = sqrt((3/4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(0.5625 + 1) = sqrt(1.5625) \u2248 1.25 miles.\n\nTherefore, Bill is approximately 1.25 miles away from his starting point.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how far Bill is from his starting point, we'll break down his movements into east and south components and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Southern Displacement**\n- First, Bill walks \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n- Then, he walks an additional \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n- **Total Southern Displacement** = \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Eastern Displacement**\n- Bill walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n- **Eastern Displacement** = \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\n- The straight-line distance from the starting point forms the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.\n- Use the formula:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{East Displacement})^2 + (\\text{South Displacement"
