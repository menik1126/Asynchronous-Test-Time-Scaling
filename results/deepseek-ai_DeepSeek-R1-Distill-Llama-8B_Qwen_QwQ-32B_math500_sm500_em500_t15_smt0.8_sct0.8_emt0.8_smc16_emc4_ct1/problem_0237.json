This affects his vertical position. Next, he moves ¾ mile east, which impacts his horizontal position. Finally, he walks an additional ½ mile south, further changing his vertical position.\n\nI'll calculate his total displacement in both the southward (vertical) and eastward (horizontal) directions. Adding these displacements will give the straight-line distance from his starting point using the Pythagorean theorem.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how far Bill is from his starting point, let's break down his movements into horizontal and vertical components and then apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Bill's Movements**\n\n- **First Movement:** Bill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile **south**.\n- **Second Movement:** He then walks \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile **east**.\n- **Third Movement:** Finally, he walks another \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile **south**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Displacement**\n\n**Vertical (South-North) Displacement:**\n- Total southward movement = \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile + \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile = **1 mile** south.\n\n**Horizontal (East-West) Displacement:**\n- Eastward movement = \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**\n\nThe straight-line distance from Bill's starting point is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where:\n- One leg is the vertical displacement (1 mile).\n- The other leg is the horizontal displacement (\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Vertical Displacement})^2 + (\\text{Horizontal Displacement})^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 0.5625} = \\sqrt{1.5625}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{1.5625} \\approx 1.25\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.25}\n\\]"
