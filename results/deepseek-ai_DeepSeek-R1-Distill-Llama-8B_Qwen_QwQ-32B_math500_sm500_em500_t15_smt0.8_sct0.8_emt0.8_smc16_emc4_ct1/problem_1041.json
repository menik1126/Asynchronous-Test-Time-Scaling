            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial: 2x⁴ + a₃x³ + a₂x² + a₁x + 1 = 0. It has integer coefficients, and I need to find the number of different possible rational roots. Hmm, okay, I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem from my algebra class. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFrom what I remember, the Rational Root Theorem gives us a list of all possible rational numbers that could be roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nSo in this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. That means p can be either 1 or -1 because 1 is the only factor of 1. For q, since the leading coefficient is 2, the possible values for q are 1 and 2. So the possible rational roots are p/q, which would be 1/1, 1/2, -1/1, and -1/2.\n\nLet me list them out: 1, 1/2, -1, and -1/2. That gives me four possible rational roots. Now, are these all distinct? Let me check. 1, 1/2, -1, -1/2—they’re all different from each other. So that means there are four different possible rational roots for this polynomial.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I’m not missing anything, let me go through the theorem again. The theorem says that any rational root, when written in lowest terms, has a numerator that divides the constant term and a denominator that divides the leading coefficient. So in this case, the constant term is 1, so the numerator can only be 1 or -1. The leading coefficient is 2, so the denominator can only be 1 or 2.\n\nPutting these together, the possible roots are 1/1, 1/2, -1/1, and -1/2, which are indeed four distinct numbers. Hmm, is there any chance I misapplied the theorem here? Let me think. The polynomial is of degree 4, but the theorem applies regardless of the degree as long as the coefficients are integers, right? So regardless of whether"

            "output": " the polynomial is quadratic, cubic, quartic, etc., the possible rational roots are still determined by the factors of the constant term over the factors of the leading coefficient.\n\nAnother thing to check: the coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁ are integers. Since the problem states the polynomial has integer coefficients, that's already given. So even though the coefficients between x⁴ and the constant term can vary, the possible rational roots are still constrained by the constant term and leading coefficient. Therefore, the possible rational roots are indeed only those four.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if some of these roots could be the same? For example, if 1/1 and 2/2, but 2/2 is 1, which is already considered. But since the denominator has to divide the leading coefficient, 2/2 would have a denominator of 2, but the numerator would have to divide 1, so that's still 1/2 or -1/2. So no, there's no overlap beyond the four I listed.\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots is 4. Let me just confirm with an example. Suppose the polynomial is 2x⁴ + ... +1. If x=1 is a root, then plugging in gives 2 + a₃ + a₂ + a₁ +1 =0, so the coefficients have to satisfy that equation. Similarly, for x= -1, it would be 2 - a₃ + a₂ - a₁ +1 =0. The coefficients can be adjusted to make any of these roots possible, right? Since the coefficients are integers, but they can be any integers. So each of these four roots is possible depending on the coefficients. Therefore, all four are possible, so the number is 4.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The question says \"different possible rational roots\". Does \"possible\" here mean that each of these four can actually be achieved by some choice of coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁? Let me check for each of them.\n\nTake 1/2 first. Suppose we want 1/2 to be a root. Then plugging into the polynomial: 2*(1/2)^4 + a₃*(1/2)^3 + a₂*(1/2)^2 + a₁*(1/2) +1 =0.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n2"

For example, let's choose a₃= -9, a₂=0, a₁=0. Then -9 + 0 +0 +0 +8 = -1, which isn't zero. Hmm, maybe another choice.\n\nWait, perhaps I can set a₃= -1, a₂= -2, a₁=1. Then:\n\n-1 + (-2)*2 + 1*4 + 8 -9 = -1 -4 +4 +8 -9= (-5) +4 +8 -9= (-1) +8 -9=7 -9= -2. Still not zero.\n\nWait, maybe I should solve for a₁. Let's rearrange: a₃ +2a₂ +4a₁ = -9.\n\nI can choose a₃=1, a₂=0, then 1 +0 +4a₁ = -9. So 4a₁= -10, which gives a₁= -10/4= -5/2, not integer. Hmm.\n\nMaybe a₃= -1, a₂=1, so -1 +2 +4a₁ = -9 => 1 +4a₁= -9 => 4a₁= -10 => a₁= -10/4= -5/2 again, not integer.\n\nAlternatively, a₃=3, a₂= -1, so 3 + (-2) +4a₁= -9 => 1 +4a₁= -9 => 4a₁= -10.

Let me see:\n\nSuppose I set a₃=0, a₂=0, then 0 +0 +4a₁ = -9 => a₁= -9/4, which is not integer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set a₁= -3, then 4*(-3)= -12. So a₃ +2a₂ = -9 +12=3. So a₃ and a₂ can be any integers such that their combination gives 3. For example, a₃=3, a₂=0. Then that works. So a₃=3, a₂=0, a₁= -3. Then the equation becomes 3 +0 +4*(-3)=3-12= -9, so that's correct. So then the coefficients would be integers. So that works. So in this case, with a₃=3, a₂=0, a₁=-3, then 1/2 is a root. So yes, 1/2 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, let's check -1/2.

So that works.\n\nSimilarly, x=1: plugging into the polynomial, 2 +a₃ +a₂ +a₁ +1 =0 → a₃ +a₂ +a₁= -3. For example, set a₃= -3, a₂=0, a₁=0. Then yes, x=1 is a root.\n\nSimilarly, x= -1: 2*(-1)^4 +a₃*(-1)^3 +a₂*(-1)^2 +a₁*(-1) +1= 2 -a₃ +a₂ -a₁ +1=0 → 3 -a₃ +a₂ -a₁=0 → so a₃ -a₂ +a₁=3. Choose a₃=3, a₂=0, a₁=0, then 3 -0 +0=3, which satisfies the equation.
