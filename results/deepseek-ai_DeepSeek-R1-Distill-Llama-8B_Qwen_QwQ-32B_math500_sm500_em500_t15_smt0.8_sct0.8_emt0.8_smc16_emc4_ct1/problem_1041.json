            "output": "Alright, so I need to figure out the number of different possible rational roots for this polynomial: 2x⁴ + a₃x³ + a₂x² + a₁x + 1 = 0. Hmm, okay. I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem, right? It helps find possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients. Let me try to recall how it works.\n\nFirst, the theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as p/q, p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. So in this case, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2.\n\nAlright, so let's break that down. The constant term here is 1, so the possible values for p, which are the factors of 1, are just ±1. That makes sense because 1 only has two factors, 1 and -1.\n\nNow, the leading coefficient is 2, so the possible values for q, which are the factors of 2, are ±1 and ±2. So that gives us possible denominators of 1 and 2.\n\nPutting those together, the possible rational roots would be p/q, where p is ±1 and q is ±1, ±2. Let's list them out:\n\n- For q = 1: p/q = ±1/1 = ±1\n- For q = -1: p/(-1) = ±1/(-1) = ∓1, but since we're considering different roots, it's still just 1 and -1\n- For q = 2: p/2 = ±1/2\n- For q = -2: p/(-2) = ±1/(-2) = ∓1/2, which again are just 1/2 and -1/2\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots. So even though the signs might repeat, each unique value counts once.\n\nSo, listing them out: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That's four different rational numbers. Is that all? Let me make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nThe possible p values are only ±1 since the constant term is 1, and the possible q values are ±1, ±2 because the leading coefficient is 2. So combining them"

            "output": " all, even considering that negative denominators can be absorbed into the numerator, but the combinations only lead to those four possibilities. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the Rational Root Theorem says all possible p/q must have p dividing the constant term and q dividing the leading coefficient, and the fractions are in reduced form. So we have to make sure that in each case, p and q are coprime.\n\nFor example, if we had p =1 and q = 2, which is coprime since gcd(1,2)=1. Similarly, p = -1 and q = 2, gcd still 1. Same with the others. So all four are in reduced form and thus valid. \n\nTherefore, there are 4 different possible rational roots.\n\nBut hold on, the problem mentions \"different possible rational roots of this polynomial\". Since the polynomial can have different coefficients a₃, a₂, a₁, the actual roots would depend on those coefficients, but the question is just asking how many different possible rational roots there could be in general. So any of these four could potentially be roots depending on the coefficients, right?\n\nTherefore, the number of different possible rational roots that this polynomial could have is 4.\n\nHmm, but let me double-check if there's something I missed. Maybe the polynomial is of degree four, so maybe some roots can't be there? But the question is about possible rational roots, not the actual roots. So regardless of the degree, the possible rational roots are still determined by the constant and leading coefficient? Yes, so the degree doesn't restrict the possible candidates.\n\nAnother thought: could there be duplicate roots? Like, for instance, if a rational root is repeated, but the question says \"different\", so they just want the count of distinct possibilities, not counting multiplicity. Since the question is about \"different possible\" which refers to the distinct rationals, not their multiplicity in the equation. Therefore, the answer should indeed be 4.\n\nOkay, so I think I've verified all the possible factors. The possible p over q in simplest terms are ±1 and ±1/2, so four different possibilities. Therefore the answer should be 4. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different possible rational roots is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3"
