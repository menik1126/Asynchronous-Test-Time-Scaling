            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\). Hmm, polynomial division, right? I remember that polynomial long division is similar to the long division I learned in arithmetic, but with polynomials instead of numbers. Let me try to recall the steps.\n\nFirst, I should set up the division. The dividend is \\( x^6 - 3 \\) and the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\). So, I write it like this:\n\n```\n           ______________\nx + 1 ) x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3\n```\n\nWait, why did I write all those zeros? Oh, right, because the original polynomial is \\( x^6 - 3 \\), which means the coefficients for \\( x^5 \\) down to \\( x \\) are zero. That might make it easier to perform the division step by step.\n\nNow, the process starts by dividing the first term of the dividend by the first term of the divisor. The first term of the dividend is \\( x^6 \\) and the first term of the divisor is \\( x \\). So, \\( x^6 ÷ x = x^5 \\). That’s the first term of the quotient.\n\nI write that above the division line:\n\n```\n           x^5\n           _______\nx + 1 ) x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3\n```\n\nNext, I multiply the entire divisor \\( x + 1 \\) by this term \\( x^5 \\), which gives \\( x^6 + x^5 \\). I subtract that from the original polynomial:\n\n```\n          x^5\n          _______\nx + 1 ) x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3\n        - (x^6 + x^5)\n        ---------------\n                  -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3\n```\n\nNow, I bring down the next term, but since there"

So, I proceed with this new polynomial.\n\nNow, I divide the new first term, which is -x^5, by the first term of the divisor, which is x. So, \\( -x^5 ÷ x = -x^4 \\). That's the next term in the quotient.\n\nAdding that to the quotient: \\( x^5 - x^4 \\).\n\nMultiply the divisor by this term: \\( (x + 1)(-x^4) = -x^5 - x^4 \\).

Which simplifies to \\( x^4 - 3 \\). Wait, no, actually, it's \\( x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x -3 \\), but the zero coefficients can be omitted for simplicity, so it's \\( x^4 - 3 \\).\n\nNow, I repeat the process: divide \\( x^4 \\) by x, which gives \\( x^3 \\). So, I add that to the quotient: \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 \\).\n\nMultiply the divisor by \\( x^3 \\): \\( (x + 1)(x^3) = x^4 + x^3 \\). Subtract that:\n\n```\n          x^5 - x^4 + x"

Let me double-check.\n\nAfter the first subtraction, I had \\( -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\). Then I subtracted \\( -x^5 - x^4 \\), which is the same as adding \\( x^5 + x^4 \\). So, the result should be \\( (-x^5 + x^5) + (0x^4 + x^4) + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\). That gives \\( x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\).\n\nThen, I bring down nothing because everything is already in place. Now, I divide \\( x^4 \\) by x, getting \\( x^3 \\). So, the quotient term is now \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 \\).\n\nMultiply \\( (x + 1) \\) by \\( x^3 \\) to get \\( x^4 + x^3 \\). Subtract that from the current polynomial:\n\n```\n          x^5 - x^4 + x^3\n          _______\nx + 1 ) x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3\n        - (x^6 + x^5)\n        ---------------\n                  -x^5 + 0x^4 + x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3\n        - ( -x^5 - x^4 )\n        -------------------\n                          x^"

Now, this is the remainder. Since the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor (which is 1), we can stop here.\n\nSo, compiling the quotient terms: \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 \\). Wait, but let me count how many terms I added. Starting with \\( x^5 \\), then \\( -x^4 \\), then \\( x^3 \\). So, the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 \\).\n\nLet me check that. Another way to approach polynomial division is using synthetic division. Maybe I can verify my result using that method to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSynthetic division is a shortcut for polynomial division when dividing by a linear factor like \\( x + a \\). Here, since the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), a is -1. So, I can set up synthetic division with -1.\n\nThe coefficients of the dividend are: 1 (for \\( x^6 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^5 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^4 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^3 \\)), 0 (for \\( x^2 \\)), 0 (for \\( x \\)), and -3 (constant term).\n\nSo, writing them out: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nSet up synthetic division:\n\n-1 | 1  0  0  0  0  0  -3\n         -1  1  -1  1  -1   1\n      ----------------------\n        1  -1  1  -1  1  -1  -2\n\nWait, let me perform this step by step.

Add to the last term: -3 +1 = -2.\n\nSo the coefficients of the quotient are 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, and the remainder is -2.\n\nWait, but the quotient's degree is one less than the dividend's degree. The dividend is degree 6, so the quotient should be degree 5. The coefficients from synthetic division are 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, which is six coefficients, so that's degree 5. The remainder is -2.\n\nTherefore, the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x -1 \\), and the remainder is -2. Hmm, so that contradicts my previous result where I had only up to \\( x^3 \\). That means I must have made a mistake in my long division earlier.\n\nLet me go back and check my steps again.\n\nStarting over with long division:\n\nDividend: \\( x^6 - 3 \\), written as \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x -3 \\).\n\nDivisor: \\( x"
