Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that to find the points where two curves are tangent to each other, I need to find their common tangent lines. Once I have these tangent lines, I can find the points where each tangent touches both the circle and the parabola. Then, with those four points, I can figure out the shape of the quadrilateral and compute its area.\n\nLet me start by recalling that the equation of a tangent to a circle can be written using the formula for a line tangent to a circle at a point \\( (x_1, y_1) \\). For the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\), the tangent line at \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is \\( xx_1 + yy_1 = r^2 \\). In this case, the circle is \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\), so the tangent line at any point \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) on the circle will be \\( xx_1 + yy_1 = 2 \\).\n\nOn the other hand, the parabola given is \\( y^2 = 8x \\). I remember that the equation of the tangent to this parabola at a point \\( (at^2, 2at) \\) is \\( ty = x + at^2 \\). But here, comparing \\( y^2 = 8x \\) with the standard form \\( y^2 = 4ax \\), I see that \\( 4a = 8 \\) so \\( a = 2 \\). Therefore, the parametric equations for the parabola are \\( x = 2t^2 \\) and \\( y = 4t \\), and the tangent line at this point is \\( ty = x + 2t^2 \\) or rearranged, \\( y = t x + 2t^2 \\).\n\nWait, but I think I might be mixing up something here. Let me double-check. For the parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\),"

Hmm, so substituting \\( a = 2 \\), the tangent line would be \\( y = (1/t)(x - 2t^2) \\), which simplifies to \\( y = (1/t)x - 2t \\). So, yes, the tangent line equation is \\( y = (1/t)x - 2t \\) or rewritten as \\( x - t y - 2t^2 = 0 \\).\n\nSo, the tangent lines to the parabola are \\( x - t y - 2t^2 = 0 \\). Now, these same lines are also tangent to the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\). So, for a line to be tangent to a circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle. The center of the circle is at (0,0), and the radius is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). So, the distance from (0,0) to the line \\( x - t y - 2t^2 = 0 \\) must be \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nThe formula for the distance from a point \\( (x_0, y_0) \\) to the line \\( ax + by + c = 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \\).

Let me find the points for each line.\n\nStarting with the line \\( y = x - 2 \\).\n\nFirst, find where this line intersects the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\).
