The question is asking about the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial.\n\nHmm, okay. I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. Let me try to recall how that works. I think it has to do with possible roots being fractions where the numerator divides the constant term and the denominator divides the leading coefficient.\n\nSo, the polynomial has a leading coefficient of 2 and a constant term of 1. That means any possible rational root, let's say in its reduced form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have \\(p\\) dividing 1 and \\(q\\) dividing 2.\n\nRight, so the possible values for \\(p\\) would be the divisors of 1. Since 1 is a prime number, its divisors are just 1 and -1. Similarly, for \\(q\\), it's the divisors of 2, which are 1, 2, -1, -2. But since we can't have denominators of zero, \\(q\\) can't be zero.\n\nWait, but \\(q\\) is the denominator, so it's separate from the numerator. So actually, \\(p\\) must be a factor of the constant term, which is 1, and \\(q\\) must be a factor of the leading coefficient, which is 2. So the possible values for \\(p\\) are limited to \\(\\pm1\\), and for \\(q\\), it's \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\). But we have to consider reduced fractions, so we can't have any common factors between \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nHold on, let me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = 1\\) → \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\)\n2. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = -1\\) → \\(\\frac{1}{-1} = -1\\)\n3. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = 2\\) → \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n4. \\(p ="

Similarly, \\(p = -1\\) over \\(q=1\\) is -1. The other combinations with negative denominators just flip the numerator's sign. So the unique rational roots would be 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. Therefore, there are four possible rational roots?\n\nWait, but is there any possibility that some of these could not actually be roots depending on the coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_1\\)? \n\nHmm, the question asks for the number of different possible rational roots, so even though the coefficients aren't fixed, the possible rational roots are constrained by the Rational Root Theorem. So even if the coefficients are integers, each of these four fractions are candidates, but maybe there's a case where some of them can't occur? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all four are possible. Let me try testing with some examples.\n\nLet me pick each possible root and see if I can construct a polynomial with integer coefficients where that root is present.\n\nFirst, take 1. Suppose x=1 is a root. Then substituting into the polynomial: 2(1)^4 + a_3(1)^3 + a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) + 1 =0 → 2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 +1 =0 → a_3 +a_2 +a_1 = -3. There are integer solutions for this, like setting a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1"

            "output": "=-3. So yes, 1 can be a root.\n\nNext, x=-1. Substitute: 2(-1)^4 + a_3(-1)^3 + a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) +1= 2(1) -a_3 + a_2 -a_1 +1= 0 → 3 -a_3 + a_2 -a_1=0 → So -a_3 + a_2 -a_1 = -3. There are integer solutions here too, for example, a_3=0, a_2=1, a_1=4, but wait that gives -0 +1 -4 =-3. So yes, it's possible.\n\nNow, x=1/2. Let's see. Suppose x=1/2 is a root. Then substituting:\n\n2*(1/2)^4 + a_3*(1/2)^3 + a_2*(1/2)^2 + a_1*(1/2) +1 =0.\n\nCalculate each term:\n2*(1/16) = 1/8\na_3*(1/8)\na_2*(1/4)\na_1*(1/2)\nPlus 1.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n1/8 + (a_3)/8 + (a_2)/4 + (a_1)/2 +1=0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n1 + a_3 + 2a_2 +4a_1 +8 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to a_3 + 2a_2 +4a_1 = -9.\n\nAre there integer values for a_3, a_2, a_1 that satisfy this? Let's see, certainly, for example, set a_3=1, a_2=1, then 1 + 2 +4a_1= -9 → 3 +4a_1= -9 → 4a_1= -12 → a_1=-3. So coefficients would be a_3=1, a_2=1, a_1=-3.

So the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nI should make sure that there aren't any overlaps or duplicates. For example, is 1/2 equal to any other? No, because 1/2 is distinct from 1, -1, -1/2. Similarly, -1/2 is distinct from the others. So, four different possible rational roots.\n\nYeah, so I"
