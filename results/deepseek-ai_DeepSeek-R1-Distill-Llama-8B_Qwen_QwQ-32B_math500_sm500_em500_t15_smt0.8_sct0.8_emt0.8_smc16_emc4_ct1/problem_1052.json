The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots this polynomial can have. Hmm, I think I need to use the Rational Root Theorem here. \n\nLet me recall what the Rational Root Theorem says. It states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. So, in this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. That should help narrow down the possible rational roots.\n\nFirst, let's identify the factors of the constant term, which is 1. The factors of 1 are just ±1, right? So, p can be either 1 or -1. \n\nNext, the leading coefficient is 2, so the possible values for q are the factors of 2. Factors of 2 are ±1 and ±2. However, since we’re looking for rational roots expressed in lowest terms, q shouldn't have any common factors with p. Since p is either 1 or -1, which are both relatively prime to 2, all possible q values are allowed. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of p/q are:\n- 1/1 = 1\n- 1/(-1) = -1\n- (-1)/1 = -1\n- (-1)/(-1) = 1\n\nWait, but that seems redundant. Actually, the set of possible rational roots is the union of p divided by each q, but we have to make sure each root is in its lowest terms. So, if I list all possible p/q combinations:\n- For p=1: 1/1, 1/(-1)\n- For p=-1: (-1)/1, (-1)/(-1)\n\nBut simplifying each:\n1/1 = 1\n1/(-1) = -1\n(-1)/1 = -1\n(-1)/(-1) = 1\n\nSo the unique possible rational roots are 1 and -1. Therefore, are there only two possible rational roots? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe constant"

            "output": " term is 1, so factors p must be ±1, and the leading coefficient is 2, so denominators q can be ±1 and ±2. Wait a second, hold on! I think I made a mistake here. The factors of the leading coefficient include ±1 and ±2, so the q's should be the divisors (factors) of the leading coefficient, which is 2. That means q could be 1, 2, -1, -2. Therefore, the possible p/q combinations would also include 1/2 and -1/2, right?\n\nOh, right! I forgot about the denominators being 2 or -2. Let me redo that step properly.\n\nPossible numerators (p) are factors of 1: ±1.\n\nPossible denominators (q) are factors of 2: ±1, ±2.\n\nThus, the possible rational roots p/q (when reduced to lowest terms) would be all combinations:\n\n±1/1 (i.e., ±1), and ±1/2 (i.e., ±1/2).\n\nTherefore, the possible distinct rational roots are 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That's four different possibilities. Wait, so why did I initially forget the 1/2 terms? Because I was too quick and only considered the factors of the constant term but didn't properly consider all denominators. So actually, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±1/2. Therefore, that would give 4 different rational roots.\n\nBut hold on, let me confirm once more. The Rational Root Theorem says that any rational root p/q must have p dividing the constant term and q dividing the leading coefficient, with the fraction in lowest terms. Therefore, since q divides 2, which has divisors ±1 and ±2, so possible denominators are 1, 2, -1, -2, but when simplified, the fractions can be written with denominator ±1 or ±2, but positive denominators. So the possible denominators are 1 and 2. Therefore, possible roots are ±1/1, ±1/2. So four possibilities. \n\nSo that's four possible rational roots. The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots, so the answer would be 4. But wait, the problem says \"different possible rational roots\", so even if in some cases the"

            "output": " values might repeat, but here they are all unique.\n\nWait, but for instance, if p=1 and q=2, we get 1/2; p=-1 and q=2, we get -1/2. Similarly, p=1 and q=-1 gives -1, but when simplified, that's the same as p=-1 and q=1. So actually, the unique possible rational roots are 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2, which are four distinct values. So yes, four different possible rational roots. \n\nI think that's correct. So the number is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different possible rational roots is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of different possible rational roots of the polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\), we use the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\n- The constant term is 1, so the possible values for \\(p\\) are \\(\\pm 1\\).\n- The leading coefficient is 2, so the possible values for \\(q\\) are \\(\\pm 1\\) and \\(\\pm 2\\).\n\nWe consider all possible combinations of \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) and simplify them to their lowest terms:\n- For \\(p = 1\\), the possible rational roots are \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{-1} = -1\\).\n- For \\(p = -1\\), the possible rational roots are \\(\\frac{-1}{1} = -1\\) and \\(\\frac{-1}{-1} = 1\\).\n\nAdditionally, considering the denominators \\(\\pm 2\\):\n- For \\(q = 2\\), the possible rational roots are \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{-1}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the unique possible rational roots are \\(1\\), \\(-1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).
