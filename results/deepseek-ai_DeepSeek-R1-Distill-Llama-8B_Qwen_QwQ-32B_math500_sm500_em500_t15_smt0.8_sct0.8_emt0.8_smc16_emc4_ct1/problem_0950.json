The coefficients are 10, 4, and 8, and the variables are r, r^3, r^6, and r^4.\n\nNext, I will multiply the coefficients: 10 multiplied by 4 is 40, and then 40 multiplied by 8 is 320.\n\nThen, I will combine the variables by adding their exponents since the base is the same. For r, the exponents are 1, 3, 6, and 4. Adding these exponents, I get 1 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 14, so the combined variable term is r^14.\n\nFinally, I will place the coefficients and variables together to simplify the expression: 320r^14.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators:**\n   \\[\n   (10r^3)(4r^6) = 10 \\times 4 \\times r^{3+6} = 40r^9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40r^9}{8r^4} = \\frac{40}{8} \\times \\frac{r^9}{r^4} = 5r^{9-4} = 5r^5\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5r^{5}}\n\\]"
