The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 9 is 3, so the square root of 1/9 is 1/3.\n\nFinally, I'll take the square root of 1/3 to rationalize the denominator. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 3 remains as is. Therefore, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is \u221a(1/3).\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\( \\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}} \\) and write the result with a rational denominator, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the innermost radical:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{729}}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( 9^3 = 729 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{9}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Take the square root of the result:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   Because \\( \\sqrt{1} = 1 \\) and \\( \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\).\n\n3. **Take the square root of the final result:**\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n   To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by \\( \\sqrt{3} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}\n\\]"
