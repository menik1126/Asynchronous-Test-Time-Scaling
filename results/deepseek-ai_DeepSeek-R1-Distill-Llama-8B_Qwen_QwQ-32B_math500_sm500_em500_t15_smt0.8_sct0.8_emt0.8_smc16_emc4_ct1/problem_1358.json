Let me recall how polynomial division works. \n\nFirst, I know that when dividing a polynomial by a binomial like \\( x + 1 \\), I can use synthetic division as a shortcut. Maybe that would be easier than doing the full long division. I remember that synthetic division involves using the root associated with the divisor. Since the divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), the root is \\( -1 \\). So, I'll set up the synthetic division with \\( -1 \\) as the value.\n\nLet me write down the coefficients of the dividend. The polynomial is \\( x^6 - 3 \\). I need to express this in standard form, which is from the highest power to the constant term. So, \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\). That gives me the coefficients: 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3.\n\nNow, setting up the synthetic division with these coefficients and the root \\( -1 \\):\n\n-1 | 1   0   0   0   0   0   -3\n  |     -1   1   -1   1   -1   1\n  -------------------------------\n    1  -1   1   -1   1   -1   -2\n\nLet me explain each step. I bring down the first coefficient, which is 1. Then, I multiply 1 by -1, giving -1, and add it to the next coefficient, which is 0. That gives -1. \n\nNext, I take that -1 and multiply by -1, giving 1. I add that to the next coefficient, which is 0, resulting in 1. \n\nContinuing, I take the 1 and multiply by -1, resulting in -1, adding to the next 0, which gives -1. \n\nThen, multiplying -1 by -1 gives 1, adding to the next 0, resulting in 1. \n\nNext, multiplying 1 by -1 gives -1, adding to"

So the remainder is -2, and the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, if I were to do polynomial long division, let's see if I get the same result. \n\nDividing \\( x^6 - 3 \\) by \\( x + 1 \\). \n\nFirst term: \\( x^6 \\) divided by \\( x \\) is \\( x^5 \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^5 \\), giving \\( x^6 + x^5 \\). Subtract that from the original polynomial:\n\n\\( (x^6 - 3) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 - 3 \\).\n\nNext term: \\( -x^5 \\) divided by \\( x \\) is \\( -x^4 \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( -x^4 \\), which is \\( -x^5 - x^4 \\). Subtract that:\n\n\\( (-x^5 - 3) - (-x^5 - x^4"

Subtract:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 3) - (x^2 + x) = -x - 3 \\).\n\nNext term: \\( -x \\) divided by \\( x \\) is \\( -1 \\). Multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( -1 \\) to get \\( -x - 1 \\). Subtract:\n\n\\( (-x - 3) - (-x - 1) = -2 \\).\n\nSo the remainder is -2 and the quotient is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\), same as before. So that confirms my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\) is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 \\) with a remainder of -2. But the question specifically asks for the quotient, so I don't need to include the remainder.\n\nI think that's it. Both methods gave me the same quotient, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\), we can use synthetic division:\n\n1. **Set up synthetic division** with the root \\( -1 \\) and the coefficients of"
