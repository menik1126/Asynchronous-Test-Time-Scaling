And the roots come in complex conjugate pairs because the coefficients of the polynomial are real numbers. The question is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the products of each root with its conjugate. That is, \\(\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r_5}}\\). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is the square of the modulus of \\(r\\). So, \\(\\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}} = \\frac{1}{|r|^2}\\). Therefore, the expression we're supposed to find is the sum of the reciprocals of the squared magnitudes of each pair of complex conjugate roots. That might be easier to think about in terms of Vieta's formulas or maybe some property of the polynomial.\n\nThe given polynomial is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Let me write that as \\((x + (13x - 1))^{10} = 0\\)? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10}\\) is not the same as \\((x + 13x -1)^{10}\\). That would be \\((14x -1)^{10}\\), but that's not the same equation. So, that approach is wrong.\n\nInstead, maybe I should look at the equation as \\(x^{10} = - (13x -1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, we might get \\(x = \\omega ( - (13x -1) )\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of unity. Wait, but roots of unity satisfy \\(\\omega^{10} = "

Let's divide both sides by \\((13x -1)^{10}\\) (assuming \\(13x - 1 \\neq 0\\), which I think is safe because if \\(13x -1 = 0\\), then \\(x = \\frac{1}{13}\\), plugging back into the equation gives \\((\\frac{1}{13})^{10} + (0)^{10} = \\frac{1}{13^{10}} \\neq 0\\), so it's not a root).

So, x = - omega_k / (1 -13 omega_k )\n\nTherefore, the roots are x = - omega_k / (1 -13 omega_k )\n\nTherefore, the modulus squared of x is |x|^2 = | - omega_k / (1 -13 omega_k ) |^2 = |omega_k|^2 / |1 -13 omega_k |^2 = 1 / |1 -13 omega_k |^2, since |omega_k|=1.\n\nTherefore, 1/|x|^2 = |1 -13 omega_k |^2.\n\nTherefore, the sum over all roots of 1/|x|^2 is sum_{k=0}^9 |1 -13 omega_k |^2.\n\nWhich we computed as 1700, so the sum over the five pairs is 850.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850. So, boxed, that would be \\boxed{850}.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to get this result, perhaps through Vieta's formula.\n\nAlternatively, consider the polynomial equation. Let me denote the polynomial as P(x) = x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} =0.\n\nSuppose"
