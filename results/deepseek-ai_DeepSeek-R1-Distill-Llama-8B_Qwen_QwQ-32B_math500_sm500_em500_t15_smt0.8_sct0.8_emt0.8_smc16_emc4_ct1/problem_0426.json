So, the equation given is:\n\n\\[x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\]\n\nAnd we're told that this equation has 10 complex roots, which come in pairs: \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2,\\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The question is asking for the value of the sum:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3\\overline{r}_3} + \\frac{1}{r_4\\overline{r}_4} + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\]\n\nOkay, so first, I think it's helpful to recall some concepts from complex numbers. Specifically, for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to the square of the modulus of \\(r\\). In other words:\n\n\\[r\\overline{r} = |r|^2\\]\n\nSo, each term in the sum is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\), where \\(r_i\\) are the roots. Therefore, the sum we're being asked to find is:\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\]\n\nHmm, okay. So, perhaps if I can find some relationship between the roots \\(r_i\\) and the coefficients of the polynomial, I can find a way to compute this sum.\n\nLooking at the given equation:\n\n\\[x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\]\n\nThis seems like a sum of two 10th powers. Maybe I can factor this somehow or find a substitution that simplifies it.\n\nLet me try a substitution. Let me set \\(y = x\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[y^{10} + (13y - 1)^{10} = 0\\]\n\nHmm, but that doesn't seem to help much. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out something or find a common term.

So, the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[(13x - 1) = \\omega x\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\).

Wait, the original equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10} =0\\). Let me check if the coefficients are real. Yes, expanding \\((13x -1)^{10}\\), all coefficients are real. Therefore, the equation has real coefficients, so complex roots come in conjugate pairs, which explains why the roots are listed as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1,\\) etc. So, the 10 roots are 5 conjugate pairs. Therefore, in the problem's notation, each \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\) are conjugates. But when I was using \\(\\omega_j\\), each \\(\\omega_j\\) is a root of \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), so they come in their own conjugate pairs?\n\nWait, actually, the roots \\(\\omega_j\\) are the 10 roots of \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\). Since -1 is real, the roots are symmetrically placed on the complex plane. So, for every root \\(\\omega_j\\), its complex conjugate is also a root.\n\nTherefore, if we have roots \\(\\omega_j\\) and \\(\\overline{\\omega_j}\\) as part of the 10 roots, but since in the expression \\(x = 1/(13 - \\omega_j)\\), then for each such \\(\\omega_j\\), the other root would be \\(x = 1/(13 - \\overline{\\omega_j})\\), which is the conjugate of \\(1/(13 - \\omega_j)\\). So, indeed, each such pair corresponds to \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r}_i\\).\n\nTherefore, when we compute the sum over all roots, because the roots come in conjugate pairs, the terms for \\(i\\) and \\(\\overline{i}\\) would be the same, since \\(1/(r \\overline{r})\\) is the same for both. Therefore, the sum over all 10 roots would be twice the sum over the 5 distinct terms given in the problem. Wait, the problem's"

So, the total sum is 2 * problem's sum.\n\nTherefore, problem's sum = total sum / 2 = 1700 / 2 = 850.\n\nSo, the value of the given sum is 850.\n\nBut let me just verify this another way.\n\nEach |13 - \\omega_j|^2 = 170 - 26 cos(theta_j).\n\nSumming over j=0 to 9, since cos(theta_j) sum to zero, as we computed, the total sum is 1700.\n\nBut since each root is counted twice in this sum (once as r_j and once as \\overline{r_j}), the problem's sum is half of that, so 1700 / 2 = 850.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 850.\n</think>\n\nSo, to solve the problem, we first recognize that each root \\( r_i \\) satisfies \\( r_i = \\frac{1}{13 - \\omega_i} \\) where \\( \\omega_i \\) are the 10th roots of \\(-1\\). The sum we need is the sum of \\( 1/(r_i \\overline{r_i}) \\) for each pair \\( r_i, \\overline{r_i} \\). This translates to summing \\( |13 - \\omega_i|^2 \\) over all 10 roots. Using the formula for the sum of cosines in an arithmetic progression, we find the cosine terms sum to zero. Thus, the total sum of \\( |13 - \\omega_i|^2 \\) is \\( 10 \\times 170 = 1700 \\). Since we need the sum over only 5 pairs, we divide by 2 to get \\( 850 \\).\n\n\\[\\boxed{850}\\]"
