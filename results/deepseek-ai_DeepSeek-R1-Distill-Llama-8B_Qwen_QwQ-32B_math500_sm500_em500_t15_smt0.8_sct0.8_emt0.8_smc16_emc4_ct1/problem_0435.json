Since the last term is 199, I can use the formula to find the number of terms.\n\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: L = a\u2081 + (n - 1) * d, where L is the last term, a\u2081 is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nPlugging in the values, 199 = 1 + (n - 1) * 2. Solving for n gives n = 100.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the sum of the sequence using the formula S = n/2 * (a\u2081 + L).\n\nSubstituting the known values, S = 100/2 * (1 + 199) = 50 * 200 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I'll perform the division.\n\nDividing 10,000 by 7 gives 1428 with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum of the sequence \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 199\\) is divided by \\(7\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**:\n   - The sequence is an arithmetic sequence of odd numbers.\n   - The first term (\\(a_1\\)) is \\(1\\), and the common difference (\\(d\\)) is \\(2\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Terms**:\n   - The last term (\\(a_n\\)) is \\(199\\).\n   - Use the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\(n\\):\n     \\[\n     199 - 1 = (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n    "
