A is directly north of O, B is directly west of O, C is directly south of O, and D is directly east of O. The distance between C and D is 140 meters. \n\nThere's a hot-air balloon at point H directly above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. The lengths of HC and HD are given as 150 meters and 130 meters, respectively. The problem says that to reduce the total rope length, we can replace HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. The goal is to determine the greatest length of rope that can be saved.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the maximum possible savings by replacing the two ropes with a single one. That means I need to figure out the minimal total length of ropes HC and HD when combined into one rope HP. The saving would be the difference between the sum of HC and HD and the length of HP.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the setup. O is the origin, and H is directly above it, so H has coordinates (0, h), where h is the height. A is north of O, so it's at (0, a), but since H is above O, A is on the ground. Similarly, B is west of O at (-b, 0), C is south of O at (0, -c), and D is east of O at (d, 0).\n\nWait, but from the Asymptote code, it seems like A is (1,1), B is (-1.5, 0.3), C is (-1, -1), D is (1.5, -0.3), and H is (0, 2.5). But that's just a diagram. The actual problem doesn't give coordinates, except for the distance between C and D being 140 meters.\n\nSo, since C is south of O and D is east of O, the coordinates of C are (0, -c) and D are (d, 0). The distance between C and D can be calculated using the distance formula: sqrt[(d - 0)^2 + ("

Since H is above O, the coordinates of H are (0, h). \n\nThe rope HA is from H to A, which is above O, so HA's coordinates would be from (0,h) to (0,a). Wait, but if A is directly north, then actually A is along the positive y-axis. Wait, but in the Asymptote diagram, A is (1,1). Maybe in the actual problem, the Asymptote code is just a schematic? \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to set up coordinates with O at (0,0). Let me formalize this.\n\nLet\u2019s assign coordinates:\n\n- Let O be at (0,0).\n\n- A is directly north of O, so let's say A is at (0, y_A).\n\n- B is directly west, so at (-x_B, 0).\n\n- C is directly south, so at (0, -y_C).\n\n- D is directly east, so at (x_D, 0).\n\n- The balloon H is directly above O, so it has coordinates (0,0, h) if we consider 3D, but since the problem is in a plane, maybe just (0, h), treating the vertical height as the z-axis. Wait, actually in 2D, maybe they're using a plane with O at (0,0), H directly above as (0, h). So the vertical coordinate is the y-axis? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps let's treat it as 3D coordinates but projection on the plane for the field.\n\nWait, perhaps better to think in 3D: H is at (0,0, h). The points A, B, C, D are on the ground (z=0), with coordinates:\n\n- A: (0, a, 0)\n\n- B: (-b, 0, 0)\n\n- C: (0, -c, 0)\n\n- D: (d, 0, 0)\n\nBut the problem mentions that the distance between C and D is 140 m.
