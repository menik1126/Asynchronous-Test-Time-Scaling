            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about five points on a flat field: A, B, C, D, and O. A is north of O, B is west of O, C is south of O, and D is east of O. The distance between C and D is 140 meters. There's a hot-air balloon at point H directly above O. The balloon is held in place by four ropes: HA, HB, HC, and HD. Specifically, HC is 150 meters long, and HD is 130 meters long. \n\nThe problem is asking me to figure out the greatest length of rope that can be saved by replacing ropes HC and HD with a single rope HP, where P is a point on the straight line between C and D. So, instead of having two separate ropes, HC and HD, we can have one rope HP that connects H to some point P along the line CD. The goal is to find the maximum amount of rope we can save this way.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the setup. Let me sketch a rough mental image. O is the origin, with A directly north, B directly west, C directly south, and D directly east. So, if O is at (0,0), then A would be at (0, a), B at (-b, 0), C at (0, -c), and D at (d, 0), where a, b, c, d are positive distances. But wait, actually, in the problem, the only given distance is between C and D. So CD is 140 meters. Since C is directly south of O and D is directly east of O, CD would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs OC and OD. So, OC is the distance from O to C, which is directly south, and OD is the distance from O to D, which is directly east.\n\nWait, but if O is the origin, then C is at (0, -c) and D is at (d, 0). So the distance between C and D would be sqrt(d^2 + (c + 0)^2) since C is at (0, -c) and D is at (d, 0). So CD is sqrt(d^2 + c^2) = 140 m. Hmm, but in the problem statement, it says A is directly north of O, so A is (0,"

Therefore, points C and D are at (0, -c) and (d, 0) respectively. So the distance between C and D is sqrt(d^2 + c^2) = 140 meters. Got it.\n\nNow, the hot-air balloon is at H, directly above O. So H is at (0, h) for some height h. The four ropes are HA, HB, HC, and HD. So HA is the rope from H to A, which is (0, h) to (0, a). Since A is north of O, HA is a vertical rope. Similarly, HB connects H to B, which is (-b, 0). So HB is a diagonal rope from (0, h) to (-b, 0). Similarly, HC connects H to C, which is (0, -c), and HD connects H to D, which is (d, 0).\n\nIn the current setup, HC is 150 meters long, and HD is 130 meters long. So HC is the distance from H to C, which is (0, h) to (0, -c). The distance between these points is |h - (-c)| = h + c, so h + c = 150 m. Similarly, HD is the distance from H to D, which is (0, h) to (d, 0). So the distance is sqrt(d^2 + h^2) = 130 m.\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1. h + c = 150\n2. sqrt(d^2 + h^2) = 130\n\nAnd we also know that sqrt(d^2 + c^2) = 140 (from the distance between C and D). So we have three equations:\n\n1. h + c = 150\n2. sqrt(d^2 + h^2) = 130\n3. sqrt(d^2 + c^2) = 140\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum total length of the two ropes HC and HD, then replace them with a single rope HP, where P is somewhere on CD, to minimize the total length.

We need to maximize the rope saved, so minimize the length of HP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find HP such that the sum of the distances from H to P is minimized, but I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, no. The total rope used before is HC + HD = 150 + 130 = 280 meters. If we replace them with HP, the length of HP would be the distance from H to P, where P is a point on CD. The idea is that the length of HP should be less than or equal to 280, but we can choose P such that HP is as short as possible, thus saving maximum rope.\n\nBut actually, the problem is not just about the distance from H to P, because point P is constrained to lie on CD. So we have to find the minimal length HP such that P is on CD.\n\nWait, but no. Actually, in order to replace HC and HD, P has to be a point on CD such that HP connects H to P, and the combined length of HP is equal to the sum of HC and HD? Or is it that HP is a single rope that replaces both HC and HD? Hmm, the problem says \"replace HC and HD with a single rope HP where P is a point on the straight line between C and D.\" So, presumably, the balloon is still held in place by HP, but it's a single rope instead of two. So perhaps we can consider that HP is a rope that goes from H to P on CD, and the total rope used (HP) must be equal to the sum of the lengths of HC and HD, which is 280 m. Wait, but that might not make sense because HP is a single rope. So maybe the total length of HP is less than or equal to 280 m, but it's a single rope, so the savings would be 280 minus HP.\n\nWait, the problem says \"to reduce the total length of rope used, ropes HC and HD are to be replaced by a single rope HP\". So the idea is that before, we had two ropes, HC and HD, each with lengths 150 m and 130 m, so total 280 m. Now, we can have one rope HP connecting H to a point P on CD, and HP will be somehow equivalent in holding the balloon in place. So, the total length of rope used"

So the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible length of HP where P is on CD, and then the maximum saving is 280 - HP.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find the minimal distance from H to any point P on CD, then subtract that from 280 to get the maximum saving.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal distance from H to the line CD, since the minimal distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. Wait, but is that the case here?\n\nWait, H is a point above O, which is the origin. The line CD is the straight line between points C and D. Since C is (0, -c) and D is (d, 0), the line CD can be parametrized. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let me note that H is at (0, h). Since O is at (0,0), and H is directly above O, so H is (0, h). The coordinates of C are (0, -c), and D are (d, 0). The line CD connects (0, -c) to (d, 0). So, the equation of line CD can be found.\n\nLet me first find the coordinates of C and D.

Then, from equation 1: c = 150 - h = 150 - 66 = 84 meters\n\nFrom equation 2: sqrt(d² + h²) = 130 => sqrt(d² + 66²) = 130\n\nCompute 66²: 4356\n\nSo, sqrt(d² + 4356) = 130 => d² + 4356 = 16900\n\nTherefore, d² = 16900 - 4356 = 12544\n\nSo, d = sqrt(12544). Let me compute that.\n\nWell, 112² is 12544 because 100²=10000, 110²=12100, 112²= (110+2)²=110² + 4*110 +4=12100+440+4=12544. So, d=112 meters.\n\nSo, so far, we have h=66, c=84, d=112.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates are:\n\n- O at (0,0)\n- A at (0, 150 - h)? Wait, no. Wait, A is directly north of O, so from O to A is (0, a), but in this case, since A is at (0, a), and H is at (0, h). Wait, but in the problem statement, A is directly north of O, but it's not specified where A is relative to H. So from the problem, O is the origin, A is north, so (0, a), but how is A related to H?

But in the actual problem, it's a flat field with points A, B, C, D around O.

Wait, actually, in the problem, it says A is directly north of O, but H is above O, so A is on the ground, H is in the air.\n\nSo, in terms of coordinates:\n\n- O is at (0,0)\n- A is at (0, a), some point north of O\n- B is at (-b, 0), west of O\n- C is at (0, -c), south of O\n- D is at (d, 0), east of O\n- H is at (0, h), above O.\n\nSo, points A, B, C, D are all on the ground, O is the origin.\n\nBut in that case, the problem statement doesn't give us any other distances except CD=140 m.

So we need to find the minimal distance from H to CD, because the minimal rope length would be the perpendicular distance. So, since H is at (0, h), and CD is the line from (0, -c) to (d, 0), the minimal distance from H to CD is the perpendicular distance, which can be calculated.\n\nWait, but we need to find the coordinates of C, D, given that CD=140.

HC is the distance from H to C, which is sqrt( (0 - 0)^2 + (h - (-c))^2 ) = sqrt( (h + c)^2 ) = h + c = 150 m. So that gives h + c = 150.\n\nSimilarly, HD is the distance from H to D, which is sqrt( (d - 0)^2 + (0 - h)^2 ) = sqrt(d² + h²) = 130 m.\n\nAnd CD is the distance between C and D, which is sqrt( (d - 0)^2 + (0 - (-c))^2 ) = sqrt(d² + c²) = 140 m.\n\nTherefore, we have three equations:\n\n1. h + c = 150\n\n2. sqrt(d² + h²) = 130\n\n3. sqrt(d² + c²) = 140\n\nSo, as I did before, solving these equations gives h = 66, c = 84, d = 112.

Let me compute the slope.\n\nSlope m = (0 - (-84)) / (112 - 0) = 84 / 112 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, the equation of CD is y - (-84) = (3/4)(x - 0), so y + 84 = (3/4)x, so y = (3/4)x - 84.\n\nAlternatively, in standard form: 3x - 4y - 336 = 0 (since multiplying both sides by 4: 4y = 3x - 336 => 3x -4y -3"

Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about it: is there a point P on CD such that HP is 120?
