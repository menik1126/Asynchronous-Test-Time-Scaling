I need to find the surface area of one of the pieces created when a plane cuts the tetrahedron halfway between edges AB and CD. The plane is parallel to both AB and CD. Hmm, regular tetrahedrons are all edges equal, so each edge is length 2. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a regular tetrahedron looks like. It has four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. All edges are equal, and all the faces are congruent. So, in this case, each face has sides of length 2.\n\nNow, the plane is cutting the tetrahedron halfway between AB and CD. Since AB and CD are edges, I need to figure out where exactly halfway would be. Since the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, the cut must be along a line that's parallel to both. So, maybe this plane is creating a smaller tetrahedron or some kind of frustum shape?\n\nWait, but in a tetrahedron, each pair of opposite edges is skew lines, right? So AB and CD are skew lines. The plane is parallel to both, so it must intersect the tetrahedron in some way. The plane is lying halfway between these two edges, which might mean that it's equidistant in some sense from both AB and CD.\n\nLet me think about the geometry here. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are the same, so the distance between AB and CD is uniform along their length. If the plane is halfway between them, that should be at a distance of 1 unit from each since the edges are length 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not about distance in 3D space but along the length of the edges. Since the edges are 2 units, halfway would be at 1 unit from each end. So, the plane is cutting each edge AB and CD at 1 unit from their respective ends. Wait, but AB and CD are opposite edges, so their directions are opposite. So, if I'm cutting both at their midpoints, the plane would pass through the midpoints of AB and CD and be parallel to both.\n\nWait, actually, the plane is parallel to both edges, so it's not necessarily passing through their midpoints, but lying halfway between them"

Since the plane is parallel to both edges, the cross-section should be a parallelogram? Or maybe a rectangle?\n\nI need to get a better handle on the coordinates here. Maybe assigning coordinates to the tetrahedron would help. Let me try to set up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place the tetrahedron in 3D space. Let me recall that a regular tetrahedron can be embedded with vertices at (1,1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1), (1,-1,-1), scaled appropriately. But maybe that's more complicated.

Then, since it's a regular tetrahedron, the other vertices C and D must be placed such that all edges are length 2. Let me see.\n\nWait, in a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, so the coordinates need to satisfy that.

Therefore, a plane parallel to both must have a direction vector that is parallel to both AB and CD.\n\nWait, but if a plane is parallel to two skew lines, then its normal vector is perpendicular to the direction vectors of both lines.

Since AB is in the z=0 plane (since points A and B have z=0), and CD is in the z=sqrt(2) plane? Wait, point C is (sqrt(2),0,sqrt(2)), D is (0,sqrt(2),sqrt(2)), so CD is in the plane z = sqrt(2). So, the distance between the planes z=0 and z=sqrt(2) is sqrt(2). Therefore, halfway between them would be at z = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, the plane is z = sqrt(2)/2. Since the normal vector is along the z-axis, the plane is horizontal, cutting the tetrahedron at z = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nWait, but in this coordinate system, the tetrahedron has vertices at z=0 (points A and B) and z=sqrt(2) (points C and D).

So, yes, area is 1.\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the lower piece is:\n\n- From original faces: sqrt(3)/2 (ABC) + sqrt(3)/2 (ABD) + sqrt(3)/4 (ACD) + sqrt(3)/4 (BCD) = (sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 = (3/2)*sqrt(3)\n\nPlus the area of the new face EFGH: 1\n\nTotal surface area: (3/2)*sqrt(3) + 1\n\nBut wait, hold on.

But since the problem says \"one of these pieces\", maybe the answer is either of them. But the problem says \"the surface area of one of these pieces\". Since the question is from a regular tetrahedron, maybe the two pieces have the same surface area? But according to this calculation, they don't.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the areas of the original faces.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the contributions from the original faces.\n\nFor face ABC: the area below the plane is triangle ABE, which we computed as (1/2)*sqrt(3). Similarly, face ABD contributes (1/2)*sqrt(3). Faces ACD and BCD each contribute a triangle with area sqrt(3)/4 each. So total from original faces:\n\n(1/2 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4)*sqrt(3) = (2)*sqrt(3). Wait, no:\n\nWait, (1/2 + 1/2) is 1, and (1/4 +1/4) is 0.5, so total is 1.5*sqrt(3). So that's correct.\n\nThen adding the new face area 1, total is 1.5*sqrt(3) +1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"surface area of one of these pieces\". The other piece would have the remaining original face areas plus the new face. The remaining original face areas would be:\n\nTotal original surface area is 4*sqrt(3). Subtract the lower piece's original contributions (1.5*sqrt(3)), so upper piece has 2.5*sqrt(3) from original faces, plus the new face area 1. So total surface area for upper piece is 2.5*sqrt(3) +1.\n\nTherefore, the two pieces have different surface areas. The problem asks for the surface area of one of them. Since the problem says \"the plane lying halfway between them cuts ABCD into two pieces\", maybe the question expects the answer for the lower piece or the upper piece. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe"
