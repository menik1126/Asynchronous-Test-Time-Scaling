            "output": "First, I need to determine how many seats are available around the square table. Since the table has 4 sides and each side has 2 people, the total number of seats is 4 multiplied by 2, which equals 8 seats.\n\nNext, I should consider the circular nature of the table. In circular arrangements, the number of distinct arrangements is usually reduced by the number of seats because rotating the entire group doesn't create a new arrangement.\n\nHowever, this problem specifies that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. Since the table is square and not a regular circle, the rotational symmetry is limited. Specifically, rotating the table by 90 degrees will align each side with its original position.\n\nTo address this, I'll calculate the total number of linear arrangements and then divide by the number of symmetries. The number of linear arrangements is 8 factorial, which is 40320. The number of rotational symmetries for a square is 4 (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°).\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements is 40320 divided by 4, which equals 10080.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer using the specified format.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Table Setup\n- **Number of sides:** 4\n- **People per side:** 2\n- **Total seats:** \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)\n\n### Step 2: Consider Rotational Symmetry\n- **Rotational symmetry for a square:** 4 (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)\n- **Total linear arrangements without considering rotation:** \\(8! = 40320\\)\n\n### Step 3: Account for Rotational Equivalence\n- **Divide by the number of rotational symmetries:** \\(\\frac{40320}{4} = 10080\\)\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{10080}\n\\]"
