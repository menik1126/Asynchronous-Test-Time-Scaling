However, since the table has four sides, I need to consider the reflectional symmetry. This means that seating arrangements that are mirror images of each other should be counted as one unique arrangement.\n\nFinally, by dividing the total number of arrangements by the number of symmetries (8 in this case), I can find the number of distinct seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix a Position to Eliminate Rotational Symmetry:**\n   \n   - Since the table is square and can be rotated, we can fix one person's position to avoid counting rotations as distinct arrangements.\n   \n2. **Arrange the Remaining 7 People:**\n   \n   - After fixing one person's seat, there are 7 remaining people to arrange.\n   - These 7 people can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways around the table.\n\n3. **Consider Reflectional Symmetry:**\n   \n   - A square table also has reflectional symmetry. This means that arrangements that are mirror images of each other should be considered the same.\n   - There are 2 possible reflections (clockwise and counterclockwise), so we divide by \\(2\\) to account for this symmetry.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements:**\n   \n   - Combining the above steps, the total number of distinct arrangements is:\n   \n     \\[\n     \\frac{7!}{2}\n     \\]\n   \n5. **Compute the Numerical Value:**\n   \n   - Calculate \\(7!\\) (factorial of 7):\n     \n     \\[\n     7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\n     \\]\n   \n   - Then divide by \\(2\\):\n     \n     \\[\n     \\frac{5040}{2} = 2520\n     \\]\n   \n   - Therefore, there are **2520** distinct ways to seat the 8 people around the table.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{252"
