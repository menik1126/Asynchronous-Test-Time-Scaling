I'll try to break it down systematically.\n\nFirst, let's list out the information provided:\n\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n\nOur goal is to find out how many treeks equal the weight of one squig.\n\nOkay, let's assign variables to these items to make the relationships clearer. Let me denote:\n\n- Let T represent the weight of one treek.\n- Let S represent the weight of one squig.\n- Let G represent the weight of one goolee.\n\nNow, let's translate the given statements into equations.\n\nFrom the first statement: Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. So,\n\n10T = 3S + G  ...(Equation 1)\n\nFrom the second statement: Two treeks and one goolee are equal to one squig. So,\n\n2T + G = S  ...(Equation 2)\n\nOur goal is to find the number of treeks that equal one squig's weight. That means we need to express S in terms of T. Essentially, we need to find how many Ts make up one S.\n\nSo, let's see. We have two equations with three variables. Since we have two equations, we can solve for two variables in terms of the third. But since we're only interested in S in terms of T, maybe we can express everything in terms of T.\n\nLet's start with Equation 2: 2T + G = S. We can solve for G here:\n\nG = S - 2T  ...(Equation 3)\n\nNow, substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: 10T = 3S + G\n\nSubstitute G:\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n10T = 3S + S - 2T\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\nNow, let's bring all T terms to one side. Let's add 2T to both sides:\n\n10T + 2T = 4S\n12T = 4S\n\nNow, we can simplify this"

            "output": " by dividing both sides by 4:\n\n3T = S\n\nSo, S = 3T.\n\nThis means one squig weighs as much as three treeks. Therefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If S = 3T, then three treeks would equal one squig. But let's verify this with the original equations.\n\nFrom Equation 2: 2T + G = S. If S = 3T, then:\n\n2T + G = 3T\nSubtract 2T from both sides:\nG = T\n\nSo, a goolee is equal in weight to a treek. Interesting.\n\nNow, let's check Equation 1: 10T = 3S + G\n\nSubstitute S = 3T and G = T:\n\n10T = 3*(3T) + T\n10T = 9T + T\n10T = 10T\n\nWhich holds true. So our solution seems correct.\n\nTherefore, one squig weighs as much as three treeks. So, the number of treeks that make up one squig is 3.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question asks, \"The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?\" So, we need the number of treeks that sum up to S.\n\nSince S = 3T, then it's three treeks. But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret anything.\n\nYes, because S = 3T, so three treeks equal one squig. That's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Assign Variables:**\n   - Let \\( T \\) = weight of one treek.\n   - Let \\( S \\) = weight of one squig.\n   - Let \\( G \\) = weight of one goolee.\n\n2. **Translate the Statements into Equations:**\n   - From the first statement: \\( 10T = 3S + G \\) ...(Equation 1)\n   - From the second statement: \\( 2T + G = S \\) ...(Equation 2)\n\n3. **Express \\( G \\) in Terms of \\( S \\) and \\( T \\) Using Equation 2:**\n  "
