This can be written as:\n10T = 3S + G\n\nFrom the second equation, two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This gives us:\n2T + G = S\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of S from the second equation into the first equation. Replacing S in the first equation with (2T + G) gives:\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G\n10T = 6T + 3G + G\n10T = 6T + 4G\n\nNext, we'll solve for T by subtracting 6T from both sides:\n10T - 6T = 4G\n4T = 4G\n\nFinally, we can solve for T by dividing both sides by 4:\nT = G\n\nThis means the weight of one treek is equal to the weight of one goolee.\n\nNow that we know T equals G, we can substitute back into the equation for S:\nS = 2T + G\nSince T equals G, we have:\nS = 2G + G\nS = 3G\n\nTherefore, the weight of one squig is three times the weight of one goolee.\n\nFinally, to find out how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, we can divide the total weight of the squig by the weight of a treek:\nNumber of treeks = S / T\nSince S = 3G and T = G:\nNumber of treeks = 3G / G\nNumber of treeks = 3\n\nSo, three treeks have the same total weight as one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n   \\[\n   2"
