Let me recall those. The first thing that comes to mind is the identity for the sum of cubes:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nGiven that \\( xyz = 4 \\) and \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\), I can plug these into the identity:\n\n\\( 4 - 3 \\times 4 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nCalculating the left side:\n\n\\( 4 - 12 = -8 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( -8 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\)\n\nHmm, so that's equation (4). Let me denote some variables to make this easier. Let me let:\n\n\\( S = x + y + z \\)  \n\\( P = xy + yz + zx \\)  \n\\( Q = xyz = 4 \\)  \n\nI also know another identity related to the sum of squares:\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \\)\n\nSubstituting this into equation (4):\n\n\\( -8 = S(S^2 - 2P - P) \\)\n\\( -8 = S(S^2 - 3P) \\)\n\\( -8 = S"

Notice that each term is a product involving two variables where one is squared.

Let me see if I can express this in terms of S, P, and Q.\n\nFirst, note that \\( x + y + z = S \\), so \\( x + y = S - z \\), \\( x + z = S - y \\), and \\( y + z = S - x \\).\n\nTherefore, substituting these into the expression:\n\n\\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) \\)\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n\\( xyS - xyz + xzS - xyz + yzS - xyz \\)\n\nWait, let me do each term step by step:\n\nFirst term: \\( xy(S - z) = xyS - xyz \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( xz(S - y) = xzS - xyz \\)\n\nThird term: \\( yz(S - x) = yzS - xyz \\)\n\nAdding all three terms together:\n\n\\( xyS - xyz + xzS - xyz + yzS - xyz \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nThe terms with S:\n\n\\( xyS + xzS + yzS = S(xy + xz + yz) = S \\cdot P \\)\n\nThe terms with -xyz:\n\nThere are three terms of -xyz, so total is \\( -3xyz \\)\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\( S \\cdot P - 3xyz \\)\n\nBut we know that \\( xyz = 4 \\), so substituting:\n\n\\( S \\cdot P - 3 \\times 4 = S P - 12 \\)\n\nBut according to the third equation, this equals 12.
