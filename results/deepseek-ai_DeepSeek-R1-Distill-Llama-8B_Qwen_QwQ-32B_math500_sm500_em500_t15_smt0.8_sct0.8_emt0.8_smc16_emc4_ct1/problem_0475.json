The equations given are:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\).\n\nHmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that in algebra, when dealing with symmetric equations, sometimes using symmetric sums can help. Maybe I can relate these equations to the elementary symmetric sums, which are the sum of variables, the sum of their products two at a time, and the product of all three.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\( S = x + y + z \\)\n- \\( P = xy + yz + zx \\) (this is what we need to find)\n- \\( Q = xyz = 4 \\) (given)\n\nI also remember that \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \\) can be expressed in terms of S, P, and Q. The formula is:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \\)\n\nSo plugging in the known value from equation 2:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3SP + 3 \\times 4 \\)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\( 4 = S^3 - 3SP + 12 \\)\n\nLet me rearrange it:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3SP = 4 - 12 \\)\n\n\\( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \\)\n\nSo that gives me one equation involving S and P.\n\nNow, looking at equation 3: \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\).\n\nHmm, I can try to factor this expression. Let's see:\n\nEach term is of the form \\( x y^2, x^2 y, x z^2, x^2 z, y z^2, y^2 z \\).\n\nWait, let's group them differently. Maybe"

So \\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \\).\n\nI wonder if I can express this in terms of S, P, and maybe something else.\n\nWait, let's also note that \\( x + y + z = S \\), so \\( x + y = S - z \\), \\( x + z = S - y \\), \\( y + z = S - x \\).\n\nSo substituting these into the expression:\n\n\\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) = 12 \\)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\n- \\( xy(S - z) = S xy - xyz \\)\n- \\( xz(S - y) = S xz - xyz \\)\n- \\( yz(S - x) = S yz - xyz \\)\n\nAdding all these together:\n\n\\( (S xy + S xz + S yz) - 3xyz = 12 \\)\n\nFactor out S:\n\n\\( S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12 \\)\n\nBut \\( xy + xz + yz \\) is our P, so:\n\n\\( S P - 3 Q = 12 \\)\n\nWe know that Q is 4, so:\n\n\\( S P - 12 = 12 \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( S P = 24 \\)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\)\n2. \\( S P = 24 \\)\n\nLet me substitute \\( S P = 24 \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\( S^3 - 3 \\times 24 = -8 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( S^3 - 72 = -8 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( S^3 = 72 - 8 = 64 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( S = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \\)\n\nOkay"

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from equation 2:\n\n\\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\nExpressed in terms of S, P, Q: \\( S^3 - 3 S P + 3 Q = 4 \\)\nWhich gave me \\( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \\)\n\nFrom equation 3, after substitution, I got \\( S P = 24 \\)\n\nPlugging into equation from 2: \\( S^3 - 72 = -8 \\) so \\( S^3 = 64 \\) so S=4, correct.\n\nThen P=24/4=6, yes.\n\nSo, seems correct.
