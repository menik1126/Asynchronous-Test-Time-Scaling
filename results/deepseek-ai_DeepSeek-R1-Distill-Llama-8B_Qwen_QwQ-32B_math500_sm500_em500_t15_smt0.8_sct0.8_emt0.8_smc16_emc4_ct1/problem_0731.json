I'm going to take it slow because I'm still getting comfortable with logarithms.\n\nFirst, I look at the two equations given. The first one is a sum of two logarithms with base 6, and the second one is a single logarithm with base \\(y\\). It seems like I need to solve for \\(x\\) and probably \\(y\\) as well. But the question only asks for \\(x\\), so maybe I can find \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\) or vice versa.\n\nStarting with the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\). I remember that a property of logarithms allows me to combine the sum of logs into the log of a product. So, using the product rule: \\(\\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (a \\times c)\\). Applying that here, I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the product inside the log is \\(x^2 - y^2\\), because \\((x - y)(x + y)\\) is a difference of squares. So now the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\n\\]\n\nTo get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this equation in exponential form. Remember that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) implies \\(b^c = a\\). So if I have \\(\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\\), that means:\n\n\\[\n6^2 = x^2 - y^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(6^2\\), that's 36. So:\n\n\\[\n36 = x^2 - y^2 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\nAlright, that's one equation involving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Now, moving on to the second equation: \\(\\log_y (5x) = 2"

So \\(\\log_y (5x) = 2\\) implies:\n\n\\[\ny^2 = 5x \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\nGreat, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. \\(36 = x^2 - y^2\\)\n2. \\(y^2 = 5x\\)\n\nHmm, maybe I can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 to solve for \\(x\\). Let me try that.\n\nSubstituting \\(y^2\\) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:\n\n\\[\n36 = x^2 - 5x\n\\]\n\nSo now I have a quadratic equation in terms of \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\n\\]\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation for \\(x\\). Let me try factoring it. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-36\\) and add up to \\(-5\\). Hmm, factors of 36... Let's see: \n\n- 6 and 6: 6 * 6 = 36. If I have one negative and one positive, the product is negative.\n\nLooking for a pair that subtracts to 5. Let's see: 6 and -6: 6 - 6 = 0. Not 5. 9 and -4: 9 - 4 = 5. Perfect! So, the factors would be 9 and -4.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as:\n\n\\[\n(x + 9)(x - 4) = 0\n\\]\n\nHence, the solutions are \\(x = -9\\) or \\(x = 4\\). Hmm, wait a minute. Let's think about this. In the original logarithmic equations, the arguments inside the logs must be positive. \n\nLooking back at the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y)\\) and \\(\\log_6 (x + y)\\), so both \\(x - y > 0\\) and \\(x + y > 0\\). Also, from Equation 2: \\(y^2 = 5x\\). Since \\(y^2\\) is always non-negative, \\(5x\\) must be positive, so \\(x > 0\\). Therefore, \\(x = -9\\) is invalid because that would make \\("

So we can discard \\(x = -9\\).\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\(x = 4\\). \n\nBut let me check this step by step to make sure I didn't skip anything. Let's verify \\(x = 4\\) in both equations.\n\nFirst, let's find \\(y\\) using Equation 2: \\(y^2 = 5x = 5*4 = 20\\). Therefore, \\(y = \\sqrt{20}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{20}\\). But again, in logarithms, the base \\(y\\) must be positive and not equal to 1. Also, in the first equation, the arguments \\(x - y\\) and \\(x + y\\) must be positive. \n\nSo, let's check the possible values of \\(y\\). Since \\(y\\) is the base of a logarithm in the second equation, \\(\\log_y (5x)\\), the base \\(y\\) must satisfy \\(y > 0\\) and \\(y \\neq 1\\). \n\nSo \\(y = \\sqrt{20}\\) is okay, but \\(y = -\\sqrt{20}\\) is negative, so that's invalid. Therefore, \\(y = \\sqrt{20}\\). \n\nNow, let's check the first equation with \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = \\sqrt{20}\\):\n\nFirst, compute \\(x - y = 4 - \\sqrt{20}\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{20} \\approx 4.472\\), so \\(4 - 4.472 \\approx -0.472\\), which is negative. Wait, that's a problem because the logarithm of a negative number is undefined. \n\nOh no! That means even though \\(x = 4\\) solves the quadratic equation, it might not satisfy the original logarithmic equation's domain requirements. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake here. \n\nWait, so if \\(x = 4\\) and \\(y = \\sqrt{20}\\), then \\(x - y\\) is negative, which is invalid. That means my solution is invalid. Hmm, so maybe I missed something here. Let me retrace my steps.\n\nLet me see."

Then, with \\(x = 4\\), I found \\(y = \\sqrt{20}\\), but that leads to \\(x - y\\) being negative. So perhaps \\(x = 4\\) is not a valid solution.

Hmm, perhaps I made a wrong substitution or miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, let's double-check the first equation. When I combined the logs, I had:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\). So \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\). And from Equation 2, \\(y^2 = 5x\\). So substituting \\(y^2 = 5x\\) into Equation 1 gives \\(x^2 -5x = 36\\), so \\(x^2 -5x -36 = 0\\).

But using the quadratic formula, I get x =9 and x = -4. So that's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in factoring earlier.\n\nWait, where did I go wrong? Let me check.\n\nThe quadratic equation is \\(x^2 -5x -36 =0\\). Let me try to factor it correctly.

There we go. So the numbers are 4 and -9. So the factors would be (x +4)(x -9)=0. Wait, that can't be right because 4*(-9)= -36 and 4 + (-9) = -5, which matches. So the correct factoring is (x +4)(x -9)=0, giving roots at x= -4 and x=9.\n\nOh man, I must have messed up the factoring earlier. I think I confused it with another problem. So the correct roots are x = -4 and x=9.\n\nOkay, so now, x= -4 and x=9.\n\nFirst, let's check x= -4. If x = -4, then from Equation 2, y\u00b2 =5x =5*(-4)=-20, which is negative.
