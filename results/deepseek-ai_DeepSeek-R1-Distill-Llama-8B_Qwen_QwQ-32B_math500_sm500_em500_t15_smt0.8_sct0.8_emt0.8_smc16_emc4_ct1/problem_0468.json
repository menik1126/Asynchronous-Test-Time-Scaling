They satisfy three equations:\n\n1. \\( xyz = 4 \\)\n2. \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \\)\n3. \\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nAnd I need to find the value of \\( xy + yz + zx \\). Hmm, that's the target expression. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in algebra, when dealing with symmetric equations involving three variables, sometimes we can use symmetric polynomials or try to relate them to each other using known identities. Let me recall some relevant identities.\n\nI know that:\n\n- The sum of cubes can be expressed as \\( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \\). That's a useful identity.\n\n- Also, the expression given in the third equation has terms like \\( xy^2, x^2 y, xz^2, x^2 z, yz^2, y^2 z \\). Let me see if I can rewrite that in a more manageable way.\n\nLooking at the third equation:\n\n\\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \\)\n\nI notice that each term is of the form \\( x y^2 \\) or \\( x^2 y \\), so it's similar to the expansion of \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) \\). Let me confirm that.\n\nMultiplying \\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) \\) gives:\n\n\\( x(xy) + x(yz) + x(zx) + y(xy) + y(yz) + y(zx) + z(xy) + z(yz) + z(zx) \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( x^2 y + x y z + x z^2 + x y^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 + x^2 z + x y z + z^2 x \\)\n\nWait, that seems"

Let me check again:\n\nNo, actually, in the expansion above, each \\( xyz \\) term occurs three times because each pair multiplication gives one. So yeah, it's:\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 y + x y^2 + x^2 z + x z^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 + 3xyz \\)\n\nTherefore, the third equation is:\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12 \\)\n\nBut from the first equation, we know \\( xyz = 4 \\). So, substituting that:\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3(4) = 12 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12 = 12 \\)\n\nHence,\n\n\\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = 24 \\)\n\nSo that's equation (4), which is derived from the third given equation.\n\nNow, let me note down the"

Let me verify everything because sometimes in these problems, you might have multiple solutions or some hidden constraints.\n\nLet me check the steps again:\n\n1.

Wait, if x=y=z, then x+y+z=3x=4, so x=4/3. Then, xyz=(4/3)^3=64/27\u22482.37, which is not equal to 4. So, not all equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps two variables are equal.
