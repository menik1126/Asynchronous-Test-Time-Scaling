            "output": "To determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, I'll start by calculating the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since a hexagon has six sides and each side is 16 cm, the perimeter is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, since the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, I'll set up the equation for the octagon's perimeter. A regular octagon has eight sides, so 8 times the length of one side of the octagon equals 96 cm. Solving for the length of one side gives me 96 cm divided by 8, which is 12 cm.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Regular Hexagon:**\n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   - **Perimeter of the hexagon** = Number of sides × Side length\n   - **Perimeter** = \\(6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm}\\)\n   - **Perimeter** = \\(96\\, \\text{cm}\\)\n\n2. **Determine the Side Length of the Regular Octagon:**\n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   - The perimeter of the octagon is equal to the perimeter of the hexagon (\\(96\\, \\text{cm}\\)).\n   - **Perimeter of the octagon** = Number of sides × Side length\n   - Let \\(s\\) be the length of one side of the octagon.\n   - \\(8 \\times s = 96\\, \\text{cm}\\)\n   - Solving for \\(s\\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
