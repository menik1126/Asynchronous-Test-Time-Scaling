            "output": "To determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, I'll start by calculating the perimeter of the given regular hexagon.\n\nA regular hexagon has six equal sides, each measuring 16 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, its perimeter is also 96 cm. A regular octagon has eight equal sides. To find the length of one side, I will divide the total perimeter by the number of sides.\n\nSo, each side of the octagon is 96 cm divided by 8, which is 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo find the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon:**\n   - A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is 16 cm.\n   - **Perimeter of hexagon = Number of sides × Side length**\n     \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Set the perimeter of the octagon equal to that of the hexagon:**\n   - **Perimeter of octagon = Perimeter of hexagon = 96\\, \\text{cm}**\n   \n3. **Find the side length of the regular octagon:**\n   - A regular octagon has 8 equal sides.\n   - **Let \\( s \\) be the length of one side of the octagon.**\n   - **Perimeter of octagon = Number of sides × Side length**\n     \\[\n     8s = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n   - **Solve for \\( s \\):**\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n   \\]"
