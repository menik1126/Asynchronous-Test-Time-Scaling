The polynomial is given by:\n\nf(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0\n\nIt's stated that a_n is 2, a_0 is 66, and all the roots are distinct integers. I need to figure out the smallest possible |a_{n-1}|.\n\nFirst, let me recall Vieta's formulas because they relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a polynomial of degree n:\n\nf(x) = a_n(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n)\n\nExpanding this, the coefficient a_{n-1} is related to the sum of the roots. Specifically, a_{n-1} = -a_n(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n). Since a_n is 2, this becomes:\n\na_{n-1} = -2(r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)\n\nSo, |a_{n-1}| = 2|r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n|. To minimize |a_{n-1}|, I need to minimize |r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n|.\n\nAlso, the constant term a_0 is the product of the roots times (-1)^n. Since a_0 is 66, we have:\n\na_0 = (-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n = 66\n\nSo, the product of the roots is 66 if n is odd or -66 if n is even.\n\nBut regardless of n, the important thing is that the product of the roots is 66 or -66. Also, since the roots are distinct integers, I need to factor 66 into distinct integers.\n\nWait, actually, since a_0 is 66 and the leading coefficient is 2, the polynomial can be written as:\n\nf(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n)\n\nExpanding this, the constant term is 2*(-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n = a_"

Wait, no, 66 / 2 is 33. So, the product of the roots is 33 or -33.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Wait, f(x) = 2*(x - r_1)...(x - r_n) so a_0 = 2*(-1)^n r_1 r_2...r_n = 66.\n\nSo, 2*(-1)^n (product of roots) = 66.\n\nTherefore, (-1)^n (product of roots) = 33.\n\nSo the product of the roots is 33*(-1)^n.\n\nSo, whether n is even or odd affects the sign of the product.\n\nSo, whether the product is 33 or -33.\n\nBut 33 has factors 1, 3, 11, 33.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the degree, only that the polynomial has integer coefficients, distinct integer roots, a_n = 2, a_0=66.\n\nBut f(x) must have integer coefficients, so the roots could be integers, but perhaps they are not necessarily all positive.

But since we can also have negative numbers, maybe we can get more factors.\n\nWait, but the roots have to be distinct integers. So, possible factors (including negatives) would be ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33, but also combinations where the product is 33 or -33. Since 33 is 3*11, but also 1*3*11, etc. So, the number of roots can vary.

Hmm, but the question is asking for the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|, so maybe we can choose the number of roots (degree) to minimize the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved with the minimal number of roots?

The sum is 1-3-11= -13, so |a_{n-1}|=26.\n\nWait, but then the constant term would be 2*(product)*(-1)^n. Since product is 33 and n even, so 2*33=66, which is okay. But the polynomial would be 2*(x-1)(x+3)(x+11). Let's check the constant term:\n\n2*(-1)*(3)*(11)=2*(-33)= -66. Wait, again, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, the roots are 1, -3, -11. So, the factors are (x-1)(x+3)(x+11). The constant term is (-1)(3)(11)*2= -66. So, that's invalid.\n\nAh, so that's another mistake. So, the roots must be chosen such that the product of the roots (without the leading coefficient) gives the correct a_0.\n\nWait, so if the roots are 1, -3, -1"
