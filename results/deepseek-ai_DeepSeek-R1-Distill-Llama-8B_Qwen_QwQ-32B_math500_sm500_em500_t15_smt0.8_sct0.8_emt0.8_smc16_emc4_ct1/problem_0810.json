I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and its roots are integers, I remember that the polynomial can be factored as f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), where each r_i is an integer. That makes sense because multiplying out linear factors with integer roots and coefficients should give an integer polynomial.\n\nGiven that a_0 is 66, which is the constant term, and the leading coefficient is 2, I can relate this to the product of the roots. For a monic polynomial, the constant term is the product of the roots, but here the leading coefficient is 2, so it should be 2 times the product of the roots. Wait, actually, the constant term is equal to (-1)^n times the product of the roots times the leading coefficient. Let me recall Vieta's formula.\n\nYes, for a polynomial f(x) = a_nx^n + ... + a_0, the product of the roots is (-1)^n * a_0 / a_n. Since a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66, the product of the roots is (-1)^n * 66 / 2 = (-1)^n * 33. So the product of all roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd.\n\nBut since the roots are integers, I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33. Let's list the integer factors of 33. 33 factors into 1, -1, 3, -3, 11, -11, 33, -33. But since the roots could be positive or negative, I have to consider all combinations.\n\nWait, but the product is 33 or -33. So depending on how many negative roots there are, the product could be positive or negative. For example, if there are an even number of negative roots, the product is positive, and if odd, it's negative.\n\nSo, let's see, 33 can be factored into "

Since we need distinct integers, the roots have to be distinct integers, so we can't repeat numbers.\n\nSo perhaps the roots must be factors of 33 or -33, but arranged in such a way so that their product is either 33 or -33? Wait, but actually, the roots can be any integers, not necessarily factors of 33. Wait no, actually, since the product of roots times 2 gives 66? Wait, let's check that again.\n\nWait, the constant term of the polynomial is 2 times the product of ( - r_i ), since f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n). So the constant term is 2*(-r_1)(-r_2)... (-r_n). The constant term is 66, so 2*(-1)^n (r_1 r_2 ... r_n) = 66. So rearranged, that gives the product of roots, r_1 r_2 ... r_n = 66 / (2*(-1)^n). Wait, but 66 divided by 2 is 33, so r_1...r_n = 33 / (-1)^n. Hmm, so the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n.\n\nWait, so exactly. So if n is even, the product is 33, and if n is odd, it's -33? Because (-1)^n will be negative for odd n, so 33 / (-1)^n would be negative. Wait, actually, let me rephrase:\n\nLet me write it out properly:\n\nf(x) = 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Then expanding this, the constant term a0 is 2*(-r1)(-r2)...(-rn) = 2*(-1)^n (r1r2...rn). So set equal to 66:\n\n2*(-1)^n (r1r2...rn) = 66\n\nTherefore, (r1r2...rn) = 66 / [2*(-1)^n] = 33 / (-1)^n\n\nSo the product of the roots is"

So depending on whether n is even or odd, the product of the roots is 33 or -33.\n\nNow, since the roots are distinct integers, we have to find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33. Moreover, I need to find such a set where the coefficient a_{n-1} is minimized in absolute value.\n\nWait, a_{n-1} is the coefficient of x^{n-1}. In f(x) = 2(x - r1)...(x - rn), when we expand it, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is 2*(-sum of roots). Because in the expansion of (x - r1)...(x - rn), the coefficient of x^{n-1} is -sum(r_i). Then multiplied by 2, it becomes 2*(-sum(r_i)) = -2*sum(r_i). Therefore, a_{n-1} is equal to -2 times the sum of roots.\n\nSo, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, which is | -2*sum(r_i) |, we need to make the absolute value of the sum of the roots as small as possible.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a set of distinct integers r1, r2, ..., rn such that their product is 33 or -33, and the absolute value of their sum is minimized. Then |a_{n-1}| will be twice that, so we can compute that.\n\nSo, my goal is to find such a set where their product is 33 or -33, all distinct integers, and the sum of the numbers is as close to zero as possible. Because we want |sum| to be as small as possible.\n\nSo, let's note that 33 is 3*11, and -33 is (-3)*11 or (-1)*33, etc. So perhaps we can have multiple factorizations.\n\nI need to find all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and among those, find the set with the smallest possible |sum|.\n\nLet me consider both cases: product is 33 and product is -33.\n\nCase 1: Product is 33"

Let's list possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 33.\n\nPossible factors of 33 are 1, 3, 11, 33, and their negatives.

But that's three numbers, so n=3, but n must be even here. Wait, n is even in this case. Hmm, so if n is even, then the number of roots must be even. So for example, if we have three roots, that would be odd, so that's not allowed here. So need to have even number of roots. So maybe split into more factors?\n\nAlternatively, maybe include 1, -1, etc. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps we can have more factors by including 1 and -1. Let's see.\n\nFor example, 33 can be written as 1 * 3 * 11, but that's three factors. To get an even number of factors, maybe split one of the numbers into more factors. For instance, 3 can be written as 3*1, but that would repeat 1. Not allowed. Alternatively, maybe use negative numbers?\n\nWait, but the product has to be positive 33.
