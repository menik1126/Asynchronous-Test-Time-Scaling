Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given. The condition is xyz(x + y + z) = 1, and all variables are positive. The expression I need to minimize is (x + y)(y + z). Hmm, maybe expanding this expression would help? Let me try that.\n\nExpanding (x + y)(y + z), I get:\n(x + y)(y + z) = x*y + x*z + y^2 + y*z.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem too helpful immediately. Maybe there's another approach. Since we have a condition involving x, y, and z, maybe using some inequalities would be better here. Like AM-GM inequality, because we're dealing with positive real numbers and trying to find a minimum or maximum.\n\nLet me recall the AM-GM inequality: For non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So, for example, (a + b)/2 \u2265 \u221a(ab), with equality when a = b.\n\nBut in this problem, we have multiple variables and a product equal to 1. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify things. Let me think: If I let a = x + y + z, then the given condition becomes xyz * a = 1. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe it's better to fix some variables or express them in terms of others. For instance, I could try to express z in terms of x and y from the given condition, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, let me consider symmetry. The expression (x + y)(y + z) seems to involve y more than the others, so maybe y is a key variable here. Maybe I can set y as a variable and express x and z in terms of y?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution variables. Let me think: Let me let a = x + y, b = y + z. Then, the expression I'm trying to minimize is ab. Maybe this substitution can help me relate to the given condition.\n\nBut then, what's x, y, z in terms of"

Hmm, so x + y + z = a + b - y. \n\nThe given condition is xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Let's substitute x, z, and the sum into that equation:\n\nx = a - y,\n\nz = b - y,\n\nx + y + z = a + b - y,\n\nSo, substituting into the condition:\n\n(a - y) * y * (b - y) * (a + b - y) = 1.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't the best approach. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Lagrange multipliers? Since we have a constraint and need to minimize a function. But since this is an Olympiad problem, perhaps there's a more elegant solution with AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz.\n\nLet me try to manipulate the expression (x + y)(y + z). Let's see:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + xz.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me verify:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = x*y + x*z + y^2 + y*z = y(x + y + z) + x*z. Yes, that's correct. So, (x + y)(y + z) = y(a) + xz, where a = x + y + z.\n\nGiven that xyz(a) = 1, so maybe I can express xz in terms of that?\n\nLet me see. Let me denote S = x + y + z. Then, the given condition is xyz*S = 1. So, xyz = 1/S.\n\nSo, the expression (x + y)(y + z) = y*S + x*z.\n\nHmm, so substituting xyz = 1/S, so x*z = (1/S)/(y). Therefore, x*z = 1/(S y).\n\nTherefore, (x + y)(y + z) = y*S + 1/(S y).\n\nHmm, so that's an expression in terms of y and S. But S is"

So, then (x + y)(y + z) becomes (x + t)(t + z) = t(x + z) + x z.\n\nBut from xyz = 1/S, with S = x + t + z, so xyz = 1/S.\n\nBut then x z = 1/(S t). So, plugging back in, we have (x + t)(t + z) = t(x + z) + 1/(S t).\n\nHmm, not sure that's helping.\n\nWait, another thought. Since (x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + x z, and we know xyz(x + y + z) = 1, which can be written as z = 1/(x y (x + y + z)).\n\nHmm, perhaps substituting that into x z.\n\nWait, let me try that.

So, substituting the inequality above:\n\nS \u2265 y + 2/(\u221a(y S)).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit convoluted. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nLet me think again. Let me try to set variables such that symmetry is exploited. Let me see if I can assume some variables are equal. For example, maybe the minimum occurs when x = z? Let me test that.\n\nSuppose x = z. Then, the condition becomes x * y * x (x + y + x) = x\u00b2 y (2x + y) = 1.\n\nThe expression to minimize is (x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)^2.\n\nSo, if x = z, then the problem reduces to minimizing (x + y)^2 under the constraint x\u00b2 y (2x + y) = 1.\n\nHmm, maybe this is manageable. Let me set variables here. Let me let t = x/y. Then, x = t y. Substitute into the constraint:\n\n(t y)^2 * y (2 t y + y) = t\u00b2 y\u00b2 * y ( y (2 t + 1) ) = t\u00b2 y^3 * y (2 t + 1) = t\u00b2 (2 t + 1) y^4 = 1.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute step by step:\n\nOriginal constraint with x = z and x = t y:\n\nx = t y,\n\nso substituting into x\u00b2 y (2x + y):\n\n= (t y)^2 * y * (2 t y + y) = t\u00b2 y\u00b2 * y * y (2 t + 1) = t\u00b2 (2 t + 1) y^4 = 1.\n\nTherefore, y^4 = 1 / [t\u00b2 (2 t + 1)], so y = [1 / (t\u00b2 (2 t + 1))]^{1/4}.\n\nThe expression to minimize is (x + y)^2 = (t y + y)^2 = y\u00b2 (t + 1)^2.\n\nSubstituting y from above:\n\nExpression = [1 / (t\u00b2"

So, the minimal value of (x + y)(y + z) is 2.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this. So, we considered the case when x = z, and through substitution, we found that the minimal value in this case is 2. But is this the global minimum, or is there a possibility that when x \u2260 z, the expression could be smaller?\n\nWait, to ensure that this is indeed the global minimum, I need to confirm whether assuming x = z is valid.\n\nIn optimization problems with symmetry, sometimes the extremum occurs at a symmetric point. Here, the expression (x + y)(y + z) is symmetric in x and z, so it's plausible that the minimum occurs when x = z.\n\nAlternatively, we can argue that any deviation from x = z would lead to a higher value, but since we've found a critical point and the function tends to infinity as variables go to extremes, it's likely that the minimum is achieved at x = z.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of (x + y)(y + z) is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe minimum value of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) is \\boxed{2}\\).\n</think>\n\nGiven \\(x, y,\\) and \\(z\\) are positive real numbers such that \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), we need to"
