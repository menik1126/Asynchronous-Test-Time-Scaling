Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand it. We have three positive variables x, y, z. There's a condition: the product of x, y, z, and the sum of x, y, z is 1. So, xyz(x + y + z) = 1. And we need to find the minimum value of the expression (x + y)(y + z). Got it.\n\nI think I should probably start by trying to manipulate the given condition to express one variable in terms of the others or find some relationship that could help simplify the expression we're trying to minimize. Let's see.\n\nGiven that xyz(x + y + z) = 1, maybe I can solve for one of the variables. But since all variables are positive, maybe symmetry can be used here. Alternatively, perhaps using some inequality like AM-GM might be helpful. Yeah, inequalities are often the way to go in these optimization problems.\n\nLooking at the expression we need to minimize: (x + y)(y + z). Let me expand that to see if it can be expressed in a more manageable form. Let's do that:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = x*y + x*z + y^2 + y*z.\n\nHmm, that gives x*y + x*z + y^2 + y*z. Not sure if that helps directly, but maybe there's a way to relate this to the given condition.\n\nThe given condition is xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Maybe I can write the expression in terms of that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me think. Since the condition involves x, y, z, and their sum, maybe setting variables in terms of each other could help. Or perhaps setting variables in a way that relates to each other.\n\nWait, perhaps homogenization would be useful here. Since the condition is a product of variables times a sum equals 1, and the expression we want to minimize is a product of sums, which is also a degree 2 expression in each variable.\n\nHmm, let me check the degrees. The given condition is"

The expression (x + y)(y + z) is (degree 1)*(degree 1) = degree 2. So the degrees are different, so maybe homogenization would require introducing a scaling factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use substitution to reduce variables. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such that x + y + z = S, so that the condition becomes xyzS = 1. Then, perhaps express (x + y)(y + z) in terms of S and other variables?\n\nLet me try that. Let S = x + y + z. Then, the condition is xyzS = 1. The expression to minimize is (x + y)(y + z). Let's see:\n\n(x + y)(y + z) = (x + y + z + y)(y) ??? Wait, no, let me expand it again properly.\n\nWait, (x + y)(y + z) = x*y + x*z + y^2 + y*z. Alternatively, maybe factor differently. Alternatively, note that (x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + x z. Let me check that:\n\ny(x + y + z) = yx + y^2 + y z, and then adding x z gives yx + y^2 + y z + x z, which is exactly the expansion. So, (x + y)(y + z) = y S + x z, where S = x + y + z.\n\nHmm, that's an interesting expression. So, (x + y)(y + z) = y S + x z. Since S is x + y + z, so maybe we can write this as y S + x z. Hmm, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the condition xyz S = 1. Since S is x + y + z, so maybe we can express x z in terms of that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use AM-GM inequality on the terms of the expression we need to minimize.

Alternatively, maybe think about it as products of variables.\n\nWait, another idea: Since we have the condition involving xyz and S, which is x + y + z, maybe we can use substitution with variables that simplify the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use substitution to set variables in terms of variables that make the condition symmetric. Maybe set a = x, b = y, c = z, but I don't think that helps. Alternatively, can we assume symmetry between variables except y? Because in the expression (x + y)(y + z), y is treated more symmetrically than x and z.\n\nWait, perhaps making substitution: Let me set t = x z. Hmm, maybe that's a way. Let me see, but perhaps that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to express x and z in terms of y, using the condition. Hmm.\n\nWait, given that xyz S = 1, and S = x + y + z, perhaps we can solve for one variable in terms of others. Let me try to express, say, z in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom xyz S = 1, with S = x + y + z, we can write z = (1)/(x y (x + y + z)).\n\nWait, but that still has z on both sides, which might not help. Alternatively, maybe express z as 1/(x y (x + y + z)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use substitution variables. Let me think, perhaps introduce p = x + y + z, q = x y + y z + z x, r = x y z. But I'm not sure if that would help.\n\nWait, let me think: The condition is r p = 1, so r = 1/p. Then, perhaps express (x + y)(y + z) in terms of p, q, r.\n\nWait, from the expansion earlier, (x + y)(y + z) = y p + x z. But x z is q - something? Wait, x y + y z + z x = q, so x z = q - x y - y z = q - y(z + x) = q - y (x + z). But since p = x + y + z, so x + z = p - y. So x z = q - y (p - y).

Let me verify all steps again.\n\nWait, so I assumed x = z, which might not be the only critical point, but given the symmetry in the problem, it makes sense that the minimal value occurs when x = z.\n\nBut let's just confirm using the critical point I found.\n\nWith x = z = 1, y = sqrt{2} -1.\n\nCompute S = 2x + y = 2*1 + (√2 -1) = 1 + √2.\n\nThen, xyz = 1* (√2 -1)*1 = √2 -1.\n\nThen, xyz * S = (√2 -1)(1 + sqrt{2}) = (√2 -1)(√2 +1) )= (2 -1) =1, which satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, this is indeed a feasible point.\n\nThen, compute (x + y)(y + z) = (1 + √2 -1)(√2 -1 +1 )= (√2)(√2) = 2.\n\nSo, yes, the value is 2. And since we used Lagrange multipliers and found a critical point, and given the positive definiteness of the function, it's likely a minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can test another point to see if the value is larger, to confirm that 2 is indeed the minimum.\n\nLet me choose x = y = z. Then, what is xyz(x + y + z)?\n\nIf x = y = z, then x^3*(3x)= 3x^4=1, so x^4=1/3, x=(1/3)^{1/4}.\n\nThen, ("
