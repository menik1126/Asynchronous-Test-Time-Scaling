            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, and I want the smallest possible sum of these integers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably factorize 84 to see what numbers I can work with. Let me start by breaking it down:\n\n84 divided by 2 is 42.\n42 divided by 2 is 21.\n21 divided by 3 is 7.\n7 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7. That means 84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7.\n\nNow, since the integers need to be distinct, I can't just have all the prime factors. I need to combine some of them into larger numbers to keep them unique. The goal is to find the combination that results in the smallest sum.\n\nI remember that to minimize the sum, it's better to have as many small numbers as possible. So, maybe I should try to use the smallest possible integers. Let me start by listing the prime factors again: 2, 2, 3, 7.\n\nBut wait, I can't have duplicate numbers, so having two 2s is not allowed. That means I need to combine at least the two 2s into a single number. Let me try combining them into 4. So, now my factors would be 4, 3, and 7. The product is 4*3*7 = 84, which is correct. Let's see the sum: 4 + 3 + 7 = 14.\n\nIs there a way to get a smaller sum? Maybe by combining different factors. Let me try another approach.\n\nWhat if I combine 2 and 3 first? That would give me 6. Then I have 6 and 7, but I still have another 2. Wait, but the original factors are two 2s, so I can't just have another 2. Hmm, maybe I should see if there's another way to combine them.\n\nAlternatively, what if I take one 2 and combine it with 7 to make 14. Then I'm left with 3 and another 2. So that would give me 14, 3, and 2. But wait, that's the same as before, just reordered."

So that's not better.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If I combine the two 2s into 4, then the numbers are 4, 3, 7. Sum is 14. Alternatively, if I combine one 2 with 3 to make 6, then the remaining factors are 2 and 7. So the numbers would be 6, 2, 7. But those are all distinct, so that's okay. The sum here is 6 + 2 + 7 = 15, which is higher than 14. So that's worse.\n\nHmm, so maybe the first approach is better. But let me see if there's another way. What if I combine all three factors into a single number? Like 2*2*3 = 12, then 12 and 7. The product is 12*7 = 84, but the sum is 12 +7 =19, which is even worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe splitting into more numbers. Since the problem says \"a set of distinct positive integers\", so maybe using more numbers can lead to a smaller sum. Let me think.\n\nThe prime factors are 2,2,3,7. To make more numbers, I can split the factors into smaller numbers but keeping them distinct. Let's see.\n\nSuppose I use 2, 3, and 14. Wait, that's 2*3*14 = 84. The sum is 2+3+14=19 again. Not better.\n\nAlternatively, 2, 6, 7. That's 2*6*7=84. The sum is 15. Still higher than 14.\n\nWait, maybe using four numbers instead of three. Let's see. Let me try to split the factors into four distinct numbers. Since the prime factors are 2,2,3,7, maybe we can split them into 2, 3, 2, 7 but they have duplicates. So that's not allowed. So need to"

For example, I can have 2, 3, 2*7=14, but that's still three numbers, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, can I make 2, 3, 2, 7? No, because they are duplicates.\n\nWait, maybe I can use exponents differently. Let's see.\n\nWait another thought: the minimal sum for given product is achieved when the numbers are as close to each other as possible. But in this case, since 84 is not very large, maybe the minimal sum is achieved by using the largest possible numbers, but that contradicts. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of breaking into more numbers.\n\nWait another idea: to get more numbers, perhaps I can split one of the composite factors into smaller ones. For example, instead of having 4,3,7, maybe break 4 into 2 and 2, but that gives duplicates again. So, that's not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider using 1 as one of the numbers? But 1 is a positive integer, and it's allowed. But adding 1 would mean I have to include it, and then I can split the remaining factors.\n\nLet me try that. So, 1, 2, 3, and 7. Wait, but that's 1*2*3*7=42, which is less than 84. So that's not enough. Alternatively, if I have 1, 2, 3, 14: that's 1*2*3*14=84. So the sum is 1+2+3+14=20, which is higher than 14.\n\nAlternatively, 1, 2, 6, 7: 1+2+6+7=16, still higher than 14.\n\nAlternatively, 1, 4, 3, 7: sum is 1+4+3+7=15, which is still higher than 14.\n\nSo including 1 doesn't seem to help because I have to include 1 and then the other numbers become large.\n\nWhat if I include 1, 2, 3, 7, and another number?

Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way to factor 84 into distinct integers. Let me list all possible sets of distinct integers whose product is 84 and compute their sums.\n\nLet me start with the prime factors and see possible groupings.\n\nFirst, the prime factors are 2, 2, 3, 7. Since they have to be distinct, we can't have two 2s. So we need to combine at least two of them.\n\nOption 1: Combine the two 2s into 4. Then the factors are 4, 3, 7. Sum is 14.\n\nOption 2: Combine a 2 and 3 into 6. Then the remaining factors are 2 and 7. So numbers are 2,6,7. Sum is 15.\n\nOption 3: Combine a 2 and 7 into 14. Then remaining factors are 2 and 3. So numbers are 2,3,14. Sum is 19.\n\nOption 4: Combine all three 2,3, and 7 into one number, but that would be 42, leaving another 2. So 2 and 42. Sum is 44.

To do that, I need to split one of the factors into smaller numbers. For example, take the 4 from option 1 (4,3,7). To split into four numbers, maybe split 4 into 2 and 2, but that duplicates.

So, perhaps a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe using a 1 and then splitting the rest accordingly. Let me try that. If I include 1, then the product of the remaining numbers should be 84. So 1 and then the rest. The remaining product is 84, so possible factors could be 2, 3, 14 or 2,6,7, etc. But as I saw earlier, including 1 doesn't help because the sum increases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to include more numbers by splitting 84 in another way.\n\nWait, 84 can be written as 2*3*2*7, but as distinct factors, that's not allowed because of duplicates. So perhaps the only way is to have three factors, or four by including 1, but that didn't help.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe instead of grouping the two 2s into 4, I can group one 2 with another number.
