Then, using two 2s would give me 2 and another 2, but they need to be distinct. Therefore, I'll use 2 and 4 (since 2 \u00d7 2 = 4). \n\nCombining these, the set of integers is 4, 3, and 7. Their product is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 = 84, and their sum is 4 + 3 + 7 = 14.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize 84 into Its Prime Factors\nFirst, decompose 84 into its prime factors:\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\nSo, the prime factors are 2, 2, 3, and 7.\n\n### Step 2: Ensure Distinct Integers\nSince the integers must be distinct, we need to combine the prime factors into distinct integers. \n\n### Step 3: Maximize the Use of Larger Numbers\nTo minimize the sum, it's better to use larger numbers because smaller numbers would result in a larger number of terms, increasing the sum.\n\n- **Start with the largest prime factor:** 7\n- **Next largest prime factor:** 3\n- **The remaining prime factors are 2 and 2.** Since 2 is already used, combine them to get 4 (i.e., \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)).\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Set of Integers\nNow, the set of integers is:\n\\[\n\\{4, 3, 7\\}\n\\]\n- **Product:** \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\\)\n- **Sum:** \\(4 + 3 + 7 = 14\\)\n\n### Conclusion\nThe least possible sum of these integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{14}\n\\]"
