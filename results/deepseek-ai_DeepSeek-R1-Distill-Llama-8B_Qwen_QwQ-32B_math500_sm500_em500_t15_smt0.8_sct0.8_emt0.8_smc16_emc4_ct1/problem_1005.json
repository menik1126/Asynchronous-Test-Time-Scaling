This fraction can be simplified to 77/100.\n\nNext, for 0.4 repeating, I can write it as 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5.\n\nFinally, 0.2 repeating is equal to 2/10, simplifying to 1/5.\n\nNow, I have the fractions 77/100, 2/5, and 1/5. The next step is to perform the subtraction and addition.\n\nSubtracting 2/5 from 77/100, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 100 and 5 is 100. So, 2/5 becomes 40/100, and the subtraction gives me 77/100 - 40/100 = 37/100.\n\nThen, I add 1/5 to 37/100. Again, the common denominator is 100, so 1/5 becomes 20/100. Adding this to 37/100 results in 57/100.\n\nFinally, I simplify 57/100 to its lowest terms, which is 57/100.\n</think>\n\nTo compute \\( 0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} + 0.\\overline{2} \\) and express the answer as a common fraction, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Convert Repeating Decimals to Fractions\n\n1. **Convert \\( 0.\\overline{7} \\) to a Fraction**\n   \\[\n   0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{77}{100}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Convert \\( 0.\\overline{4} \\) to a Fraction**\n   \\[\n   0.\\overline{4} = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Convert \\( 0.\\overline{2} \\) to a Fraction**\n   \\[\n   0.\\overline{2} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Perform the Arithmetic Operations with Fractions\n\nNow"
