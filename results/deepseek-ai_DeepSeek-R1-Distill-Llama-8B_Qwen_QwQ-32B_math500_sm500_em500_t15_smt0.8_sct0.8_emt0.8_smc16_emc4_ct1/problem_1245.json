            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this equation: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, I should probably write down the equation to make it clearer. So, it's x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, now I need to find all values of x that satisfy this. Since there's a square root, I think squaring both sides might be a good idea because that could help eliminate the square root and make the equation easier to handle. But before I do that, I should make sure that when I square both sides, I don't accidentally introduce any extraneous solutions. So, I should check if there are any restrictions on the values of x.\n\nLet me think about the domain of the square root function. The expression inside the square root, which is 11 - 2x, must be greater than or equal to zero because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, let's write that down:\n\n11 - 2x \u2265 0\n\nSolving for x, I can subtract 11 from both sides:\n\n-2x \u2265 -11\n\nThen, divide both sides by -2. But wait, when I divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, that gives me:\n\nx \u2264 11/2\n\nWhich is the same as x \u2264 5.5. So, any solution I get must be less than or equal to 5.5. That's an important restriction to keep in mind because sometimes squaring both sides can give me solutions that don't actually work in the original equation.\n\nAlright, so now that I have that restriction, let me go ahead and square both sides of the equation. \n\nSo, starting with:\n\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nIf I square both sides, the left side becomes x squared, and the right side becomes (sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4) squared. Let me write that out:\n\nx\u00b2 = (sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4)\u00b2\n\nNow, expanding the right side. Remember, (a + b)\u00b2 is a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So, applying that here:\n\n"

The second term is 8 * sqrt(11 - 2x), and the third term is 16. So putting it all together:\n\nx\u00b2 = (11 - 2x) + 8*sqrt(11 - 2x) + 16\n\nNow, let's combine like terms on the right side. 11 + 16 is 27, so:\n\nx\u00b2 = 27 - 2x + 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have this equation. It still has a square root in it, but maybe I can isolate that term and square again. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me bring the 2x to the left side by subtracting 27 - 2x from both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 - (27 - 2x) = 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\nx\u00b2 - 27 + 2x = 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + 2x - 27 = 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nHmm, that's better. Now, I think the next step is to get rid of the square root. So, let's isolate the square root term. That is, divide both sides by 8:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 2x - 27)/8 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nWait, no, that might complicate things more. Alternatively, maybe I can square both sides directly after moving the 2x and constants. So, alternatively, perhaps it's better to do this:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x - 27 = 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSo, to eliminate the square root, I can square both sides again:\n\n(x\u00b2 + 2x - 27)\u00b2 = (8*sqrt(11 - 2x))\u00b2\n\nCalculating both sides. The left side is (x\u00b2 + 2x - 27) squared, which will be a quartic (fourth degree) equation. The right side"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the quartic factors correctly, and we have all roots, but only x=5 satisfies the original equation.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there another solution? When we plugged in x= -5 +2\u221a5, we saw that the RHS was 2\u221a5 +3, which is approximately 7.472, and x was approximately -0.528. So, unless 2\u221a5 +3 equals -5 +2\u221a5, which would require 3=-5, which is false, it doesn't work.\n\nWait, but algebraically, sqrt(11 -2x)=2\u221a5 -1, so 2\u221a5 -1 +4=2\u221a5 +3. So, x must be equal to 2\u221a5 +3 for that to be a solution. But x is defined as -5 +2\u221a5, which is not equal to 2\u221a5 +3, so that doesn't hold.\n\nWait, so then, what's going on? Did I make a mistake in setting up the equations?\n\nWait, perhaps when I squared both sides, I introduced an equation that didn't actually correspond to the original one.\n\nSo, perhaps the quartic equation has four roots, but only x=5 satisfies the original equation because it's the only one for which the square root and the rest of the equation make sense.\n\nWait, let me see. When I squared both sides, I might have squared an equation that's only valid for certain ranges.\n\nSo, let's recap: The process was to square both sides, leading to a quartic equation. The quartic had four roots, but only"
