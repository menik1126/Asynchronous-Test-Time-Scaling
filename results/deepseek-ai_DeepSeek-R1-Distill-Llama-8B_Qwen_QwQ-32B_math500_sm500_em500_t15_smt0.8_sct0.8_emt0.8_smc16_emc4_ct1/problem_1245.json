            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve the equation x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, let me write that down first to visualize it better. The equation is:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nAlright, square roots can sometimes be tricky because of the domain restrictions and the need to square both sides to eliminate them. So, first, I should figure out the domain of this equation. The expression inside the square root, which is 11 - 2x, must be greater than or equal to zero. That gives me:\n\n11 - 2x ≥ 0\n\nLet me solve that inequality. Subtracting 11 from both sides:\n\n-2x ≥ -11\n\nNow, dividing both sides by -2, but I remember that when I multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So,\n\nx ≤ 11/2\n\nWhich is x ≤ 5.5. So, whatever solution I find, it has to be less than or equal to 5.5. Good, that's a crucial point.\n\nNow, back to the original equation:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nI want to isolate the square root term so that I can square both sides later on. Let me subtract 4 from both sides:\n\nx - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nOkay, so now the equation is x - 4 equals the square root of (11 - 2x). To get rid of the square root, I'll square both sides of the equation. Remember, squaring both sides is a common method to eliminate radicals, but it can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I'll need to check my answers at the end.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n(x - 4)^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nHmm, now I have a quadratic equation. I'll bring all the terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Let's subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides:\n\nx² - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\n\nCombining like terms:\n\nx² - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nAlright, now I have"

            "output": " a quadratic equation: x squared minus 6x plus 5 equals zero. Let me try to factor this. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6.\n\nWell, factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, 1 and 5 add up to 6. Since the middle term is negative and the constant term is positive, both factors should be negative. So, that gives me:\n\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\nx - 5 = 0 => x = 5\n\nx - 1 = 0 => x = 1\n\nSo, I have two potential solutions: x = 5 and x = 1. But wait, I need to plug these back into the original equation to make sure they work because sometimes when we square both sides, we can get solutions that don't actually satisfy the original equation.\n\nLet me check x = 5 first.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nPlugging in x = 5:\n\n5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n11 - 10 = 1\n\nSo,\n\n5 = √1 + 4\n\n√1 is 1, so:\n\n5 = 1 + 4 => 5 = 5\n\nThat's true, so x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check x = 1.\n\nAgain, plug into the original equation:\n\n1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4\n\nSimplify inside:\n\n11 - 2 = 9\n\nSo,\n\n1 = √9 + 4\n\n√9 is 3, so:\n\n1 = 3 + 4 => 1 = 7\n\nWait, that's not true. 1 does not equal 7, so x = 1 is an extraneous solution and should be discarded.\n\nHmm, that means only x = 5 is the valid solution. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go back through my steps.\n\nFirst, I found the domain correctly: x ≤ 5.5, which is necessary because the square root requires 11 - 2x to be non-negative.\n\nThen, I subtracted 4 from both sides, giving x - 4 = √("

Bringing all terms to the left: x² - 6x + 5 = 0. That's correct.\n\nFactored into (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0, so solutions at x = 5 and x = 1. Plugging back in, only x = 5 works. So, seems right.\n\nAlternatively, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in squaring, maybe I can consider the quadratic equation again.\n\nQuadratic equation: x² - 6x + 5 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, x = [6 ± √(36 - 20)] / 2 = [6 ± √16]/2 = [6 ± 4]/2. So, (6+4)/2 = 10/2 = 5, and (6-4)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So, same results. So, both 5 and 1 are roots, but 1 doesn't satisfy original equation.\n\nWait, let me just think about why x=1 doesn't work. If x=1, then √(11 - 2x) is √9=3, so plugging back in, x should be 3 + 4 =7, but x is 1, so that's inconsistent.\n\nSo, yeah, 1 is not a solution. So, x=5 is the only solution.\n\nWait, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe not squaring both sides immediately, but perhaps manipulating the equation differently.\n\nLet me see.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nx = √(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtract 4: x - 4 = √(11 - 2x)\n\nSquare both sides: (x -4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nWhich gives x² -8x +16 = 11 -2x, same as before.\n\nSo, seems same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a function and graph it?\n\nHmm, but perhaps that's overkill.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to test the solutions in the"

The domain was x ≤ 5.5, and x=5 is within that, and x=1 is also within that. So, the extraneous solution comes from the squaring step, which can sometimes introduce solutions that don't satisfy the original equation's constraints, even if they are in the domain.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is x=5.\n\nHmm, so I think that's the answer. Let me just recap all steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Start with equation x = √(11 -2x) +4.\n\n2. Subtract 4: x -4 = √(11 -2x).\n\n3. Square both sides: (x-4)^2 = 11 -2x.\n\n4. Expand left side: x² -8x +16 = 11 -2x.\n\n5. Bring all terms to left: x² -6x +5 =0.\n\n6. Factor: (x-5)(x-1)=0, so x=5 or x=1.\n\n7. Check x=5: 5 = √(11-10)+4 → 5=1+4 → 5=5 ✔️.\n\n8. Check x=1: 1 = √(11-2)+4 → 1=√9 +4 → 1=3+4 → 1=7 ❌.\n\nThus, only x=5 is valid. So, the answer is 5.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes here.
