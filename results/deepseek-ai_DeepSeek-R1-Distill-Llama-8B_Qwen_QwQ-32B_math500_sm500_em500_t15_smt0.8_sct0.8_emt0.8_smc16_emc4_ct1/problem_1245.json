            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this equation: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, I should probably write down the equation to make it clearer. So, it's x = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, now I need to find all values of x that satisfy this. Since there's a square root, I think squaring both sides might be a good idea because that could help eliminate the square root and make the equation easier to handle. But before I do that, I should make sure that when I square both sides, I don't accidentally introduce any extraneous solutions. So, I should check if there are any restrictions on the values of x.\n\nLet me think about the domain of the square root function. The expression inside the square root, which is 11 - 2x, must be greater than or equal to zero because you can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. So, let's write that down:\n\n11 - 2x ≥ 0\n\nSolving for x, I can subtract 11 from both sides:\n\n-2x ≥ -11\n\nThen, divide both sides by -2. But wait, when I divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, that gives me:\n\nx ≤ 11/2\n\nWhich is the same as x ≤ 5.5. So, any solution I get must be less than or equal to 5.5. That's an important restriction to keep in mind because sometimes squaring both sides can give me solutions that don't actually work in the original equation.\n\nAlright, so now that I have that restriction, let me go ahead and square both sides of the equation. \n\nSo, starting with:\n\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nIf I square both sides, the left side becomes x squared, and the right side becomes (sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4) squared. Let me write that out:\n\nx² = (sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4)²\n\nNow, expanding the right side. Remember, (a + b)² is a² + 2ab + b². So, applying that here:\n\n"

The second term is 8 * sqrt(11 - 2x), and the third term is 16. So putting it all together:\n\nx² = (11 - 2x) + 8*sqrt(11 - 2x) + 16\n\nNow, let's combine like terms on the right side. 11 + 16 is 27, so:\n\nx² = 27 - 2x + 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have this equation. It still has a square root in it, but maybe I can isolate that term and square again. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me bring the 2x to the left side by subtracting 27 - 2x from both sides:\n\nx² - (27 - 2x) = 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\nx² - 27 + 2x = 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSo, x² + 2x - 27 = 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nHmm, that's better. Now, I think the next step is to get rid of the square root. So, let's isolate the square root term. That is, divide both sides by 8:\n\n(x² + 2x - 27)/8 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nWait, no, that might complicate things more. Alternatively, maybe I can square both sides directly after moving the 2x and constants. So, alternatively, perhaps it's better to do this:\n\nx² + 2x - 27 = 8*sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSo, to eliminate the square root, I can square both sides again:\n\n(x² + 2x - 27)² = (8*sqrt(11 - 2x))²\n\nCalculating both sides.

So, x=1 is extraneous.\n\nTherefore, only x=5 is a solution.\n\nWait, so why in the first approach, after squaring twice, I ended up with quartic?\n\nBecause perhaps in the first approach, when I squared both sides, I might have lost some information or did a miscalculation.\n\nWait, what's the correct process?\n\nIn the alternative approach, we only needed to square once, ending up with quadratic, which is manageable.\n\nIn the first approach, I tried to square both sides, but perhaps that introduced extraneous solutions because of the way we rearranged the terms.\n\nSo, to be precise, the correct way is the alternative approach: isolate the square root, then square once, getting a quadratic. Thus, only x=5 is the solution.\n\nWait, so seems like in the first approach, I may have miscalculated.
