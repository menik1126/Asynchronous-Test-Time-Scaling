I have a binary number, which is 10101001110, and I need to convert it to base eight.\n\nNext, I should determine the length of the binary number. Counting the digits, it has 11 bits.\n\nKnowing that each binary digit represents a value of 2 raised to the power of its position minus one, I can start converting from the rightmost bit.\n\nI'll group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right. This is because each set of three binary digits will correspond to a single octal digit.\n\nSo, grouping 10101001110 from the right, I have 101, 010, 011, and 1. The last group only has one bit, so I'll pad it with two zeros to make it three bits: 001.\n\nNow, I'll convert each binary triplet to its equivalent octal value:\n- 101 in binary is 5 in octal.\n- 010 in binary is 2 in octal.\n- 011 in binary is 3 in octal.\n- 001 in binary is 1 in octal.\n\nFinally, I'll combine these octal digits to get the final octal number: 12351.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Length of the Binary Number:**\n   - The binary number has **11** digits.\n\n2. **Understand the Relationship Between Binary and Octal:**\n   - Each octal digit corresponds to **3 binary digits**.\n   - If the total number of binary digits isn't divisible by 3, pad the leftmost group with leading zeros to make it a multiple of 3.\n\n3. **Group the Binary Digits into Triplets:**\n   - Start grouping from the right:\n     ```\n     1 01 010 011 10\n     ```\n   - If necessary, pad with leading zeros:\n     ```\n     001 010 011 10\n     ```\n   - Since 11 isn't divisible by 3, pad the leftmost group:\n     ```\n     001 010 011 10 → 001 010 011 10 → 001 010 011 10 → 001 010 011 10\n     ```\n     - **Wait, correction:** Actually, the grouping should start from"
