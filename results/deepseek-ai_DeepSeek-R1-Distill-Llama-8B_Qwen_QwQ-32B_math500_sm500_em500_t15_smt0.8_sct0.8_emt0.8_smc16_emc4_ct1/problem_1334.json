It's a rational equation with multiple terms on the left side and a linear term on the right. My goal is to find the sum of all complex solutions. Hmm, complex solutions, so that means I need to consider both real and complex roots. But complex roots come in pairs, right? So maybe that will help in some way.\n\nFirst, let me think about how to approach this equation. It's a bit intimidating because of the denominators and the different coefficients. Maybe I can find a substitution or manipulate it somehow to make it more manageable.\n\nLooking at the denominators: x\u00b2 - 1, x\u00b2 - 2, x\u00b2 - 3, x\u00b2 - 4. They seem similar; each is a quadratic with a constant term. I notice that each denominator is a difference of squares except for the last one, but wait, x\u00b2 - 4 is also a difference of squares since 4 is 2 squared. So all denominators are of the form x\u00b2 - n, where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. \n\nHmm, maybe I can let y = x\u00b2. That would make the denominators y - n, and the equation would become:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nWait, but then I still have x in the right-hand side. That complicates things because y is x squared, but x is still there. Maybe substitution isn't the way to go. Alternatively, maybe I can clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by the product of all denominators. Let me see.\n\nThe denominators are x\u00b2 - 1, x\u00b2 - 2, x\u00b2 - 3, x\u00b2 - 4. So if I let D = (x\u00b2 - 1)(x\u00b2 - 2)(x"

            "output": "\u00b2 - 3)(x\u00b2 - 4), then multiplying both sides by D would eliminate the denominators. But that would lead to a very high degree polynomial equation. Let me think about the degree.\n\nEach term on the left when multiplied by D would have denominators canceled out, so each term would be D divided by one of the denominators. The right side would be (2010x - 4) multiplied by D. So the left side would be a sum of terms each of degree (8 - 2) = 6? Wait, let me see:\n\nEach denominator is degree 2, so D is degree 8. So when you divide by (x\u00b2 - n), you get degree 6. So each term on the left after multiplying by D would be a degree 6 polynomial. Adding them up would still be degree 6. The right side is (2010x -4) * D, which is degree 9 (since D is degree 8, multiplied by x gives degree 9). So moving everything to one side, the equation would be a degree 9 polynomial. \n\nBut solving a degree 9 polynomial is going to be really hard. Maybe there's a smarter way here. The question asks for the sum of all complex solutions. In polynomial equations, the sum of roots is related to the coefficients via Vieta's formula. If I can write the equation as a polynomial equation, then the sum of all roots would be the negative coefficient of x^8 divided by the coefficient of x^9. But since the equation is of degree 9, the sum would be that. \n\nHowever, the problem is that when we clear denominators, we might introduce extraneous roots from the denominators (i.e., the roots of the denominators x\u00b2 - n = 0, which are x = \u00b1\u221an for n=1,2,3,4). So those would be excluded from the solutions, but when we multiply both sides by D, those points would be roots of the equation but actually not solutions of the original equation. Therefore, the polynomial equation will have those roots plus the actual solutions. Therefore, the sum of all roots of the polynomial would be the sum of the actual solutions plus the sum of the excluded roots. \n\nTherefore, if I can compute the sum of roots of the polynomial equation, and subtract the sum of the excluded roots, that would give me"

            "output": " the sum of the solutions to the original equation. \n\nBut that seems a bit involved. Maybe I can find another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the sum of the roots is equal to (sum over all complex solutions), so even if the equation is of higher degree, Vieta might still work if I can find the polynomial and compute the sum of its roots, but then I would have to subtract the ones that are extraneous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can avoid this by using symmetry or another substitution.\n\nWait, another thought: the equation is symmetric around something? Let me see. On the left side, each term is of the form k/(x\u00b2 - k), for k=1,2,3,4. So if I make a substitution, maybe t = x - something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that in the equation, if I let x = -x, does anything happen? Let me check:\n\nIf I replace x by -x, then x\u00b2 remains the same, so each term on the left would remain the same, since denominators are even functions, and numerators are constants. So the left side is symmetric in x. The right side is 2010x -4. If I replace x by -x, the right side becomes -2010x -4.\n\nTherefore, if x is a solution, then -x is related to another equation: replacing x with -x gives a different equation. But unless the equation is even or odd, that might not help. Wait, the equation isn't even because the right side changes sign. So it's not symmetric under x \u2192 -x.\n\nHmm, but considering the fact that for each root x, -x might not necessarily be a root, unless forced by the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I can write the equation in a way that the left-hand side is a function, and the right-hand side is linear. The left side is a function that is even (since x\u00b2 is even, so each term is even), but the right side is odd (since 2010x is odd). So that complicates things? Maybe not directly.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe if I can write the equation as:\n\nLeft side (even function) = Right side (odd function).\n\nSo, if x is a solution, then maybe -x isn't necessarily a solution because Left side is even, but Right side becomes -2010"

So x=0 is a solution, and indeed, -x =0 is the same point. So that's the only solution that is even?\n\nHmm, so maybe x=0 is a solution, but other solutions come in pairs? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be manipulated to a function f(x) = 2010x -4, where f(x) is the left side. Since f(x) is even, and the right side is linear, so the equation is f(x) - (2010x -4) =0. The function f(x) - (2010x -4) is neither even nor odd, so roots can be anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the left side is a function that tends to 0 as x approaches infinity, since each term 1/(x\u00b2 -k) tends to 0. The right side, 2010x -4, tends to infinity. So for large x, the right side is much larger than the left, so the equation can't hold. Similarly, as x approaches negative infinity, the right side tends to negative infinity, so again, the equation can't hold. So maybe the solutions are all bounded? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the equation is equivalent to:\n\nSum_{k=1}^4 [k/(x\u00b2 -k)] = 2010x -4.\n\nLet me see if I can combine the terms on the left."

Let me check:\n\n-2010x^9: yes.\n\n4x^8: 4 is not a multiple of 2010.\n\nSo, maybe no.

Wait, actually, the 9th-degree equation includes all roots of the original equation plus the excluded roots.

So, the sum of all complex solutions to the original equation is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in considering the Vieta's formula.\n\nThe key point is that when we multiplied both sides by D, we got a polynomial of degree 9, which included all roots of the original equation, plus the roots of D=0. However, the roots of D=0 are precisely the excluded roots. Therefore, the 9th-degree polynomial's roots include both the actual solutions and the excluded ones. Therefore, the sum of all roots of the 9th-degree polynomial is equal to sum of actual solutions + sum of excluded roots.\n\nHence, to find the sum of actual solutions, I subtract sum of excluded roots from sum of all roots.\n\nBut since sum of excluded roots is 0, as computed, the sum of actual solutions is 2"

Let me check:\n\nAt x=0, denominators are 0\u00b2 -1 = -1, 0\u00b2 -2 = -2, etc. So denominators are non-zero, so x=0 is a valid solution. Therefore, x=0 is part of the actual solutions.

The excluded roots are the 8 roots from denominators, which are \u00b11, \u00b1\u221a2, etc., which sum to zero. Therefore, the total sum of actual solutions is indeed 2/1005.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any multiplicities. For example, could any of the excluded roots also be solutions? For instance, if x=1 were a solution, then plugging into the original equation would cause division by zero, so it can't be a solution. So all excluded roots are not solutions, so they are extraneous. Therefore, the actual solutions are exactly the roots of the 9th-degree equation except the excluded roots.
