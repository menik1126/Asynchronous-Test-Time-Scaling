I mean, it's a complex equation with multiple fractions on the left side and a linear term on the right. Hmm, okay, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I notice that each term on the left side is of the form \\(\\frac{n}{x^2 - n}\\), where \\(n\\) is 1, 2, 3, or 4. That’s interesting. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit.\n\nI remember that equations like this sometimes involve substituting \\(y = x^2\\), but before I jump into substitutions, maybe I should consider the denominators. Each denominator is a quadratic expression, so perhaps I can express these fractions in partial fractions? Hmm, that might complicate things, though. Partial fractions usually help when integrating, but I don't know if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's useful to consider that \\(x^2 - n\\) can be factored, but wait, that would only be helpful if \\(x^2 - n\\) factors, which it does for some n. Specifically, \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\), \\(x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)\\), but \\(x^2 - 2\\) and \\(x^2 - 3\\) don't factor nicely over integers. Hmm, so partial fractions might not be straightforward here.\n\nLet me think about another approach. Maybe I can manipulate the equation to make it more manageable. Since the right side is linear, 2010x - 4, perhaps I can find a substitution that will turn the left side into something similar.\n\nWait, another idea: sometimes when dealing with equations involving multiple fractions, it's helpful to consider multiplying both sides by the least common denominator to eliminate the denominators. But with four denominators, each different, the least common denominator would be the product of all four denominators, which is going to be a huge expression"

Let me see if that's feasible.\n\nLet me write down the left-hand side (LHS):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4}\n\\]\n\nTo combine these, I need a common denominator. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). Since they are all different and irreducible (except for the first and last ones, which factor), the common denominator would indeed be the product of all four denominators. That's going to be a degree 8 polynomial, which is going to be a mess. Hmm, maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider substituting \\(y = x^2\\), so that each term becomes \\(\\frac{n}{y - n}\\). Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet \\(y = x^2\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4\n\\]\n\nHmm, but the right side still has an \\(x\\) term, which complicates things because \\(y = x^2\\), so \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{y}\\). That might not be helpful because the right side is linear in \\(x\\), but the left side is in terms of \\(y\\). Maybe this substitution isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider moving all terms to one side and then analyze the equation. Let me try that.\n\nBring everything to the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} - 2010x + 4 = "

Alternatively, think about possible values of \\(x\\) that would make each term contribute nicely.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I can consider the equation as a function and analyze its behavior. Let me consider the left side as a function \\(f(x)\\) and the right side as \\(g(x) = 2010x - 4\\). Then, the equation becomes \\(f(x) = g(x)\\).\n\nSo, \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4}\\). Let me analyze the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\).\n\nFirst, note that \\(x = 0\\) would make each denominator negative, so \\(f(0)\\) would be negative, but \\(g(0) = -4\\). So maybe there's an intersection near zero? Hmm, but I don't know. Let me think about specific values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a particular substitution or value of \\(x\\) that simplifies the equation.\n\nWait a minute, the coefficients on the left side are 1, 2, 3, 4, and the denominators are \\(x^2 - n\\), where \\(n\\) is 1,2,3,4. That seems like a structured pattern. Maybe there's a way to let \\(x^2 = t + something\\), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution where I set each term equal to a multiple of a term on the right. But that seems a bit vague.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think about it in terms of partial fractions, but with a single variable. Let me think: each term on the left can be expressed as \\(n/(x^2 - n)\\), which is similar to \\(n/((x - sqrt(n))(x + sqrt(n)))\\). So maybe partial fractions can be used, but that would involve four terms for each fraction, making it quite complex. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider each term as a function and see if there's a telescoping behavior or a clever substitution.\n\n"

Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the sum of all complex solutions. In polynomial equations, the sum of roots can be found using Vieta's formula, which relates the coefficients. However, this equation is not a polynomial equation yet because of the denominators.

For a polynomial of the form:\n\na_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 = 0,\n\nthe sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n.\n\nIn this case, the polynomial is:\n\n-2010x^9 +4x^8 +20100x^7 -50x^6 -70350x^5 +210x^4 +100500x^3 -350x^2 -48240x +192 = 0.\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^9 is -2010, and the coefficient of x^8 is +4.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all roots (including complex ones) is -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005 = 2/1005.\n\nWait, but hold on—is that correct? Vieta's formula counts all roots, but in the original equation, some roots would make the denominators zero, which are x = ±1, ±2. So, in the original equation, x cannot be 1, -1, 2, -2. But in our polynomial equation, these points are roots? Let me check.\n\nWait, the original equation is undefined at x = ±1, ±2, so these are not part of the domain. Therefore, the solutions to the polynomial must exclude these four points. But Vieta's formula counts all roots, including these, but in reality, the original equation does not have x = 1, -1, 2, -2 as solutions because at these points the function is undefined. So, are these roots of the polynomial equation, but not solutions to the original equation?\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions to the original equation is equal to the sum of all roots of the polynomial minus the sum of the excluded roots (x = 1, -1, 2, -2).\n\nWait, but hold on, the roots x = 1, -1, 2, -2 are actually roots of the polynomial we obtained, right? Because D = (x² -1)(x² -2)(x² -3)(x² -4), so when x² -1 = 0, x = ±1, which are excluded. Similarly, x² -2 = "

Wait, actually, the denominators are x² -1, x² -2, x² -3, x² -4, so the excluded x are those where any denominator is zero, so x = ±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2. Wait, hold on, actually, the denominators are x² -1, so x = ±1; x² -2, so x = ±√2; x² -3, so x = ±√3; and x² -4, so x = ±2. Therefore, the excluded values are x = ±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2. So, 8 points. But in the polynomial equation, when we multiplied both sides by D, which is the product of all denominators, so the polynomial equation includes all roots of the original equation plus the roots of D = 0 (the excluded points). Therefore, the roots of the polynomial are the solutions to the original equation plus the excluded points. Therefore, to get the sum of the solutions of the original equation, we need to subtract the sum of the excluded roots from the total sum given by Vieta.\n\nTherefore, the total sum of roots of the polynomial is S_total = - (coefficient of x^8)/(coefficient of x^9) = -4 / (-2010) = 4/2010 = 2/1005.\n\nThen, the sum of the excluded roots is the sum of x = ±1, ±√2, ±√3, ±2.\n\nLet me compute that sum:\n\nSum_excluded = (1 + (-1) + √2 + (-√2) + √3 + (-√3) + 2 + (-2)).\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n1 -1 = 0,\n\n√2 -√2 = 0,\n\n√3 -√3 = 0,\n\n2 -2 = 0.\n\nTherefore, Sum_excluded = 0.\n\nWait, that's interesting.

            "output": ", which is 2/1005.\n\nWait, so is that the final answer? Let me double-check.\n\nYes, because the excluded roots sum to zero, so the sum of the solutions is just the sum from Vieta, which is 2/1005.\n\nBut let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in considering whether the excluded roots contribute to the sum or not.\n\nIn the polynomial equation after multiplication, all roots are accounted for, including the excluded x-values. But since the original equation is undefined at these points, they are not solutions, but in the polynomial equation, they are roots. Therefore, when calculating the sum of the original equation's solutions, we must exclude these roots.\n\nHowever, if the excluded roots add up to zero, then the sum of solutions is just the sum of all roots of the polynomial equation (from Vieta). That is, the sum of the original equation's solutions is equal to (sum of all polynomial roots) minus (sum of excluded roots). But if the excluded roots sum to zero, then the sum is just Vieta's sum.\n\nSo, Vieta gave S_total as 2/1005, which is 2 divided by 1005. Simplifying 2/1005, numerator and denominator share a GCD of 1, so it's already in simplest terms.\n\nWait, 2 and 1005: 1005 ÷ 5 = 201, and 201 ÷ 3 = 67, so 1005 = 5×201=5×3×67. 2 is prime, so no common factors. So yes, 2/1005 is the reduced form.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all complex solutions is 2/1005.\n\nSo, that's the answer. Let me recap:\n\n1. I recognized that the equation needed to be converted into a polynomial form to use Vieta's formula.\n\n2. Multiplied both sides by the common denominator to get a polynomial equation.\n\n3. Expanded and computed the coefficients, leading to a 9th-degree polynomial.\n\n4. Applied Vieta's formula to find the sum of all roots (including excluded ones).\n\n5. Noted that the excluded roots come in pairs that sum to zero.\n\n6. Concluded that the sum of the original equation's solutions is just 2/1005.\n\nThis seems solid.
