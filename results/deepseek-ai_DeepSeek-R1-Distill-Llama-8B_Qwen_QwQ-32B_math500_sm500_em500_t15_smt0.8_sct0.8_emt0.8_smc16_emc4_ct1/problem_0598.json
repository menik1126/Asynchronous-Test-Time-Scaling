I need to find the area of the quadrilateral formed by these four points. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the situation. The circle is given by the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\). That's a circle centered at the origin with a radius of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). The parabola is given by \\(y^2 = 8x\\), which opens to the right. I know that the standard form of a parabola that opens to the right is \\(y^2 = 4px\\), where \\(p\\) is the focal length. Comparing, \\(4p = 8\\) so \\(p = 2\\). That means the focus of the parabola is at (2, 0).\n\nNow, the problem mentions that there are two common tangents between the circle and the parabola. These tangents will touch both the circle and the parabola at exactly one point each, resulting in four points of tangency. The quadrilateral formed by connecting these four points is what I need to find the area of.\n\nSo, my plan is as follows:\n1. Find the equations of the common tangents to both the circle and the parabola.\n2. Determine the points where these tangents touch the circle and the parabola.\n3. Use these four points to figure out the coordinates of the vertices of the quadrilateral.\n4. With the coordinates, compute the area of the quadrilateral.\n\nLet me start by finding the equations of the common tangents. A common tangent to both the circle and the parabola will satisfy both conditions: it's tangent to the circle and tangent to the parabola. So, the tangent line must satisfy two conditions. Maybe I can find the slope of these tangents first.\n\nLet me denote a general line as \\(y = mx + c\\). Since it's a tangent to both the circle and the parabola, it must satisfy the tangency conditions for both.\n\nFor the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\), the condition for a line \\(y = mx + c\\) to be tangent is that the distance from the center (which is the origin) to the line is equal to the radius"

The condition for a line \\(y = mx + c\\) to be tangent is that it touches the parabola at exactly one point. The condition for tangency can be found by substituting \\(y = mx + c\\) into the parabola's equation and ensuring the discriminant is zero.\n\nSo, substituting, we have \\( (mx + c)^2 = 8x \\) → \\( m^2x^2 + 2mcx + c^2 - 8x = 0 \\). This is a quadratic in \\(x\\). For it to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero.\n\nDiscriminant \\(D = (2mc - 8)^2 - 4 \\cdot m^2 \\cdot (c^2 - 8)\\).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\(D = (2mc - 8)^2 - 4m^2(c^2 - 8)\\)\n\nExpanding \\( (2mc - 8)^2 = 4m^2c^2 - 32mc + 64 \\).\n\nSo, \\(D = 4m^2c^2 - 32mc + 64 - 4m^2c^2 + 32m^2 \\).\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 4m²c²\n\nSecond term: -32mc\n\nThird term: +64\n\nThen subtract 4m²(c² - 8):\n\nSo, subtract 4m²c² and add 32m².\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n4m²c² -32mc +64 -4m²c² +32m².\n\nSo, simplifying:\n\n4m²c² -4m²c² cancels out.\n\nThen we have -32mc +64 +32m².\n\nSo, \\(D ="

So,\n\nz = 1 + sqrt(5) or z = 1 - sqrt(5).\n\nWait, 1 - sqrt(5) is approximately 1 - 2.236 = -1.236, which is negative. So, m² can't be negative. So, only z = 1 + sqrt(5) is acceptable.\n\nSo, m² = 1 + sqrt(5). Therefore, m = sqrt(1 + sqrt(5)) or m = -sqrt(1 + sqrt(5)). But considering the parabola opens to the right, and the circle is centered at the origin, the tangents are likely to have both positive and negative slopes. But we'll check that later.\n\nWait, but hold on: equation (2) gave us c = (m² + 2)/m. So if m is positive, c is positive. If m is negative, c is negative. So maybe the two slopes are positive and negative, giving the two common tangents.\n\nSo, m = sqrt(1 + sqrt(5)) and m = -sqrt(1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nLet me compute 1 + sqrt(5). Since sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so 1 + sqrt(5) ≈ 3.236. So m = sqrt(3.236) ≈ 1.799.\n\nHmm, but let me keep it exact.

Alternatively, maybe it's not necessary yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I can avoid computing c numerically because we can use the parametric form for the tangent points on the circle and parabola.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe using parametric equations for the circle and parabola.\n\nFor the circle, a tangent point can be written as (sqrt(2) cos θ, sqrt(2) sin θ). Because the circle is radius sqrt(2), centered at origin.\n\nThe equation of the tangent at this point is given by x cos θ + y sin θ = sqrt(2).\n\nSimilarly, for the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\), a parametric form is (2t², 4t). The equation of the tangent at point t is ty = x + 2t².\n\nWait, let me verify that. The derivative of parabola y²=8x is 2y dy/dx=8 → dy/dx=4/y. So, the tangent line at a point where y = 4t (since y=4t for x=2t²), so dy/dx=4/(4t) )= 1/t.\n\nSo, the tangent line equation at t is:\n\ny - 4t = (1/t)(x - 2t²)\n\nMultiplying both sides by t:\n\nty - 4t² = x - 2t² → x - ty + 4t² - 2t² = 0 → x - ty + 2t² = 0.\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nLet me think.

So, that's the tangent line equation for the parabola at parameter t.\n\nNow, since the tangent line is common to both the circle and the parabola, the tangent line equation must satisfy both the tangent condition for the circle and the parabola.

So sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414 > 1. So, invalid.\n\nSecond, u = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.707. So, cos θ = -sqrt(2)/2, which is valid because it's between -1 and 1.\n\nSo, cos θ = -sqrt(2)/2, which implies that θ is in the second or third quadrant.
