Hmm, alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given and what's needed. The condition is xyz(x + y + z) = 1, and I need to minimize the product (x + y)(y + z). Hmm, both expressions involve y, so maybe I can express something in terms of y or find a substitution that simplifies the problem.\n\nLet me try expanding (x + y)(y + z) to see if that helps. So, that's x*y + x*z + y*y + y*z, which simplifies to xy + xz + y² + yz. Hmm, okay, so that's the expression I need to minimize.\n\nNow, the condition is xyz(x + y + z) = 1. Let me denote S = x + y + z. So, the condition becomes xyzS = 1. Hmm, so maybe I can relate S to the expression I'm trying to minimize.\n\nI wonder if symmetry can help here. The expression (x + y)(y + z) seems to have some symmetry in x and z, but y is in the middle. Maybe if I assume x = z, I can simplify the problem? Let me try that.\n\nLet’s suppose that x = z. Then, the condition becomes x * y * x * (x + y + x) = 1, which simplifies to x²y(2x + y) = 1. So, 2x³y + x²y² = 1.\n\nNow, the expression to minimize becomes (x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)² since x = z. Expanding that gives x² + 2xy + y².\n\nHmm, so now I have a function in terms of x and y, with the constraint 2x³y + x²y² = 1. Maybe I can find a relationship between x and y from the constraint.\n\nLet me denote t = y / x. Then, y = t x. Let's substitute that into the constraint equation.\n\nSubstituting y = t x into 2x³y + x²y² ="
