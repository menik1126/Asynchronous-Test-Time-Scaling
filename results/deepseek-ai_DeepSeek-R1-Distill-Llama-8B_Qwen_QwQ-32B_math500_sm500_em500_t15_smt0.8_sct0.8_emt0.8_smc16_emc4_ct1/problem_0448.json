Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down what is given and what is needed. We have \\(x, y, z > 0\\) and \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). We need to find the minimum of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Hmm. So, it's an optimization problem with a constraint. That makes me think of using methods like Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a way to approach it without calculus. Maybe using inequalities like AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz?\n\nLet me write down the expression we need to minimize: \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). If I expand this, it becomes \\(y^2 + xy + yz + xz\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I should look for a way to relate this expression to the given constraint.\n\nThe constraint is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). Let me think about how to express \\(x + y + z\\) or \\(x + y\\) in terms of the variables. Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution or homogenization.\n\nWait, another thought: if I set \\(a = x + y\\) and \\(b = y + z\\), then the expression we need to minimize is \\(ab\\). But how does that relate to the constraint? Let's see.\n\nLet me also note that \\(x + y + z\\) can be written as \\((x + y) + z = a + z\\). So, the constraint becomes \\(xyz(a + z) = 1\\). Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \\(z\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Let me try that. From \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), maybe solving for \\(z\\).

Hmm, maybe this is a path, but I don't know yet if this assumption is valid. Maybe the minimum occurs when \\(x = z\\), but I need to verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal value occurs when \\(x = z\\), so perhaps that's a good starting point. Let me try that approach first.\n\nLet me denote \\(x = z\\). Then, as above, the constraint is \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\), and the expression to minimize is \\((x + y)^2\\).
