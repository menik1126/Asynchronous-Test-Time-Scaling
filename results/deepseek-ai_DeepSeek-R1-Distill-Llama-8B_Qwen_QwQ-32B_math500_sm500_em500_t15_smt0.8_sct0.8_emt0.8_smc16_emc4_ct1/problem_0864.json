            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to express the expression \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I have to find a + b + c. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I'm going to look at each part of the expression separately. The expression has four terms: \u221a2, 1/\u221a2, \u221a3, and 1/\u221a3. I notice that \u221a2 and \u221a3 are both irrational numbers, as is their reciprocals. So, maybe I can combine the terms with \u221a2 together and the terms with \u221a3 together. That makes sense because they have different radicals, and combining them might simplify the expression.\n\nLet's start with the \u221a2 terms: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2. To combine these, I should rationalize the denominator of the fractional term. Rationalizing 1/\u221a2 means multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \u221a2:\n\n1/\u221a2 * \u221a2/\u221a2 = \u221a2/2.\n\nSo now, the \u221a2 terms become \u221a2 + \u221a2/2. To add these together, I can factor out \u221a2:\n\n\u221a2(1 + 1/2) = \u221a2*(3/2) = (3\u221a2)/2.\n\nAlright, so the \u221a2 part simplifies to (3\u221a2)/2.\n\nNext, let's look at the \u221a3 terms: \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. Similar to the \u221a2 case, I need to rationalize the denominator of 1/\u221a3:\n\n1/\u221a3 * \u221a3/\u221a3 = \u221a3/3.\n\nSo now, the \u221a3 terms become \u221a3 + \u221a3/3. Factoring out \u221a3 gives:\n\n\u221a3(1 + 1/3) = \u221a3*(4/3) = (4\u221a3)/3.\n\nSo, the \u221a3 part simplifies to (4\u221a3)/3.\n\nNow, putting both simplified parts back into the original expression, we have:\n\n(3\u221a2)/2 + (4\u221a3)/3.\n\nHmm, so now I need to combine these two fractions. However, since they have different denominators (2 and 3),"

            "output": " I need a common denominator to add them together. The least common denominator (LCD) of 2 and 3 is 6. So, let's convert each fraction to have 6 as the denominator.\n\nStarting with (3\u221a2)/2, we can multiply numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n(3\u221a2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = (9\u221a2)/6.\n\nAnd for (4\u221a3)/3, multiply numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n(4\u221a3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = (8\u221a3)/6.\n\nNow, adding these two together:\n\n(9\u221a2)/6 + (8\u221a3)/6 = (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6.\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I combined the \u221a2 terms correctly: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 became \u221a2 + \u221a2/2, which adds up to (3\u221a2)/2. Then, for \u221a3: \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 became \u221a3 + \u221a3/3, which is (4\u221a3)/3. Then, finding a common denominator for 2 and 3 gives 6, so I converted both fractions accordingly. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's see if we can simplify this fraction any further. The numerator is 9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3, and the denominator is 6. Since 9 and 8 don't share any common factors with the denominator 6 except 1, I don't think we can reduce the fraction any more. So, the form (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6 is the simplest.\n\nGiven that, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. So, adding them together: 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me confirm the addition: 9 + 8 is 17, and 17 + 6 is 23. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll recount:\n\nFrom the \u221a2 terms: 3 and 2. Wait, no\u2014the coefficients are 3 and 2 in the fractions, but when we converted to denominator 6, we ended up with 9\u221a2 and"

Okay, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if there's a different way to combine the terms that might lead to a smaller denominator. Let me see.\n\nSuppose instead of combining the terms first, I tried to write all terms over a common denominator from the start. Let's see:\n\nOriginal expression: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 + \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3.\n\nFirst, rationalize all denominators:\n\n\u221a2 is already fine, 1/\u221a2 is \u221a2/2, \u221a3 is fine, and 1/\u221a3 is \u221a3/3. So, the expression becomes:\n\n\u221a2 + (\u221a2)/2 + \u221a3 + (\u221a3)/3.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. So, that's the same as before. So, combining terms gives (3\u221a2)/2 + (4\u221a3)/3, leading to the same result. So, I think that's the correct path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different common denominator? Let me see. The denominators after rationalizing are 1 (for \u221a2 and \u221a3) and 2 and 3. Wait, actually, the terms \u221a2 and \u221a3 can be considered as having denominators of 1. So, when adding all four terms, the denominators are 1, 2, 1, and 3. The LCD of 1, 2, 3 is 6. So, if I were to write all terms over 6, that would be:\n\n\u221a2 = (\u221a2 * 6)/6,\n\n1/\u221a2 = (\u221a2)/2 = (3\u221a2)/6,\n\n\u221a3 = (\u221a3 * 6)/6,\n\n1/\u221a3 = (\u221a3)/3 = (2\u221a3)/6.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Let me try:\n\nExpressing each term over 6:\n\n\u221a2 = (6\u221a2)/6,\n\n1/\u221a2 = (\u221a2)/2 = (3\u221a2)/6,\n\n\u221a3 = (6\u221a3)/6,\n\n1/\u221a3 = (\u221a3)/3 = ("

So, regardless of the approach, we end up with the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the minimal form is (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6, so a = 9, b = 8, c = 6. Therefore, a + b + c = 9 + 8 + 6.\n\nCalculating that: 9 + 8 is 17, plus 6 is 23.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple approaches lead to the same conclusion. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(a + b + c\\) is \\boxed{23}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo express the given expression \\(\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) in the form \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3}}{c}\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are positive integers and \\(c\\) is as small as possible, we proceed as follows:\n\n1.
