Then, I have to find a + b + c. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression clearly: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3. I notice that there are two terms with √2 and two terms with √3. Maybe I can combine them separately first.\n\nStarting with the √2 terms: √2 + 1/√2. To add these, I should probably get a common denominator. The denominators here are 1 and √2, so the common denominator would be √2. Let me rewrite √2 as (√2 * √2)/√2 to get the same denominator. Wait, √2 * √2 is 2, so that becomes 2/√2. So, √2 + 1/√2 is 2/√2 + 1/√2 = (2 + 1)/√2 = 3/√2. Hmm, is that right? Wait, let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should rationalize the denominators first to make combining easier. Let me try that. For 1/√2, multiplying numerator and denominator by √2 gives √2/2. Similarly, 1/√3 becomes √3/3. So, substituting back into the original expression:\n\n√2 + √2/2 + √3 + √3/3.\n\nNow, let's combine the √2 terms and the √3 terms separately.\n\nFor √2: √2 + √2/2. Since √2 is the same as 2√2/2, adding √2/2 gives (2√2 + √2)/2 = (3√2)/2.\n\nFor √3: √3 + √3/3. Here, √3 is 3√3/3, so adding √3/3 gives (3√3 + √3)/3 = (4√3)/3.\n\nSo, now the expression becomes (3√2)/2 + (4√3)/3.\n\nHmm, okay. Now I"

            "output": " have two fractions with different denominators: 2 and 3. To combine them into a single fraction, I need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. So, I can rewrite each fraction with denominator 6.\n\nFor (3√2)/2: Multiply numerator and denominator by 3 to get (9√2)/6.\n\nFor (4√3)/3: Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to get (8√3)/6.\n\nNow, adding them together: (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nSo, the expression √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3 simplifies to (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Now, let's check if this can be simplified further. The numerator has terms with √2 and √3, and the denominator is 6, which is the least common multiple of 2 and 3. Since 9, 8, 6 are all integers and there are no common factors between 9, 8, and 6 besides 1, I think this is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, a = 9, b = 8, c = 6. Adding them together: 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier. Let me verify each step.\n\nStarting from the beginning: √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3.\n\nI converted 1/√2 to √2/2 and 1/√3 to √3/3, which seems correct. Then I added √2 + √2/2, which is indeed 3√2/2, and √3 + √3/3, which is 4√3/3. That part seems right.\n\nThen, combining the two fractions: 3√2/2 + 4√3/3. The common denominator is 6, so multiplying the first fraction by 3/3 gives 9√2/6, and the second by 2/2 gives 8√3/6. Adding them gives (9√2 + 8√3)/6, which looks correct.\n\nI also checked that 9 and 8 don't have any common factors with 6, which they don't. So, I think the final form is"
