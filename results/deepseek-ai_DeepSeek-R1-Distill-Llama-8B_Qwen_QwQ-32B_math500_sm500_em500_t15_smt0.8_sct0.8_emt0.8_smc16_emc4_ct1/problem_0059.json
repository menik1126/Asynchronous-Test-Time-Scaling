            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here that involves a table with the percentage of bus riders among Central H.S. students. The table breaks down the data by grade and gender, showing both male and female percentages. The question is asking: For which grade is the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders?\n\nAlright, let me try to digest this. So, first, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have four grades: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. For each grade, there are two percentages: one for males and one for females. The problem is asking which grade has the number of male riders closest to 135% of the female riders. So, essentially, for each grade, we need to calculate the number of male riders and see if it's approximately 1.35 times the number of female riders. The grade where this ratio is closest to 1.35 is the answer.\n\nBut wait, to do this, I think we need actual numbers, not percentages. Because we can't directly compare percentages unless we have a common base. Since the table doesn't give the total number of bus riders, but mentions that 300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed, that's a crucial piece of information. So, each grade has 300 males and 300 females surveyed. Therefore, the number of male bus riders is the percentage given for each grade times 300, and same for females.\n\nOkay, so for each grade, we can compute the number of male and female bus riders by multiplying the percentages by 300. Then, we can calculate the ratio of males to females for each grade and see which one is closest to 135%. Alternatively, since 135% is 1.35 times, we can compute the ratio for each grade and find which one is closest to that.\n\nLet me write out the plan step by step:\n\n1. For each grade, calculate the number of male bus riders by multiplying the male percentage by 300.\n2. Similarly, calculate the number of female bus riders by multiplying the female percentage by 300.\n3. Compute the ratio of male to female for each grade (i.e., males / females).\n4. Compare each ratio to 1.35 and determine which one is closest.\n5. The grade with the closest ratio is the answer.\n\nAlright, let's get started"

Let me compute that. 41.1% is 0.411, so 0.411 * 300. Let me do that calculation. 0.4 * 300 is 120, and 0.011 * 300 is 3.3, so total is 123.3. Wait, actually, 0.411 * 300. Let me compute it properly:\n\n0.411 * 300 = (0.4 * 300) + (0.011 * 300) = 120 + 3.3 = 123.3. Hmm, okay.\n\nFemale percentage: 39.4%, so 0.394 * 300. Let's see, 0.394 * 300. 0.3*300 is 90, 0.09*300 is 27, 0.004*300 is 1.2. So adding those: 90 + 27 = 117, plus 1.2 is 118.2. Wait, but 0.394 is 0.3 + 0.09 + 0.004, so that's correct. Alternatively, 39.4% of 300 is 300 * 0.394. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\n300 * 0.394 = 300*(0.4 - 0.006) = 300*0.4 = 120 minus 300*0.006 = 1.8, so 120 - 1.8 = 118.2. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, male riders: 123.3, female riders: 118.2. The ratio is 123.3 / 118.2."

Maybe approximate.\n\n118.2 * 1.04 = 118.2 + 4.764 = 122.964, which is close to 123.3. So, 118.2 * 1.04 ≈ 122.964, which is just a bit less than 123.3. So, 1.04 is approximate for 123.3 / 118.2. But maybe I can compute it more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, let me just use the calculator approach.\n\n123.3 / 118.2 = ?\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 41.1 / 39.4. Wait, that's the question, 41.1/39.4 is the ratio. So, 41.1 divided by 39.4. Let's compute that.\n\n39.4 goes into 41.1 once, with a remainder of 1.7. So, 41.1 / 39.4 = 1 + 1.7 / 39.4. 1.7 / 39.4 is approximately 0.043.\n\nSo, approximately 1.043. So, the ratio is about 1.043. 1.043 is the ratio of males to females in 9th grade. Now, we need to see how close this is to 1.35.\n\n1.043 is much less than 1.35. Let's note that.\n\nMoving on to 10th grade:\n\nMale percentage: 34.4%, so number of males = 34.4% of 300. 0.344 * 300.\n\n0.344 * 300: 0.3*300=90, 0.04*300=12, 0.004*300=1.2. So total 90+12=102, +1.2=103.2.\n\nFemale percentage: 33.1%, so 0.331 * 300. 0.331 * 300.\n\n0.3*300=90, 0.03*300=9, 0.001*300=0.3. So 90 +9=99, +0.3=99.3.\n\nSo, male riders: 103.2, female riders"

So, 10th grade is slightly better than 9th grade in terms of being close to 1.35, but still, 1.04 is nowhere near 1.35.\n\nNow, 11th grade:\n\nMale percentage: 20.6%, so number of males = 0.206 * 300 = 61.8.\n\nFemale percentage: 13.8%, so 0.138 * 300 = 41.4.\n\nSo, ratio is 61.8 / 41.4 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 41.4 * 1.5 = 61.1, right? Because 41.4 * 1 =41.4, 41.4 * 0.5=20.7, so total 62.1. Wait, no, 41.4*1.5=62.1, but we have 61.8, so it's a bit less than 1.5.\n\nWait, but 41.4 * 1.5 is 62.1, but our male number is 61.8, which is 0.3 less. So, 61.8 is 62.1 minus 0.3, so 61.8 = 62.1 - 0.3, so 61.8 = 41.4 * 1.5 - 0.3. So, 41.4*1.5 is 62.1, and 62.1 - 0.3 is 61.8, so the ratio is 1.5 - (0.3 /41.4) ≈ 1.5 - 0.00727 ≈ 1.4927.\n\nSo, approximately 1.4927, which is approximately 1.49.\n\nNow, 1.49 is much closer to 1.35 than the previous ones, but still, 1.49 is higher than 1.35.\n\nWait, so 1.49 is 49% higher than 1. So, the male riders are 49% higher than female riders, which is a higher ratio than 1."
