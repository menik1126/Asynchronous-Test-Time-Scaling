It means males should be 1.35 times the number of females.\n\nFor each grade, I'll calculate the ratio of males to females and see if it's close to 1.35.\n\nStarting with the 9th grade: 41.1% males and 39.4% females. So males are 41.1 / 39.4 \u2248 1.044 or 4.4% higher than females, which is quite low compared to 135%.\n\nNext, the 10th grade: 34.4% males and 33.1% females. So males are 34.4 / 33.1 \u2248 1.039 or 3.9% higher. Still far from a 35% increase.\n\nLooking at the 11th grade: 20.6% males and 13.8% females. The ratio is 20.6 / 13.8 \u2248 1.49 or 49% higher. This is closer, but not quite 135%.\n\nFinally, the 12th grade: 11.6% males and 8.6% females. The ratio is 11.6 / 8.6 \u2248 1.35 or 35% higher. This matches the 135% requirement exactly.\n\nSo, the 12th grade is the closest to having male bus riders equal to 135% of female bus riders.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders, we need to compare the ratio of males to females in each grade and see which one is closest to 1.35.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Percentage:**\n   - We're looking for the ratio of males to females that is **1.35** (or 135%).\n\n2. **Calculate the Ratio for Each Grade:**\n   - For each grade, divide the male percentage by the female percentage.\n   - Compare this ratio to 1.35 to see how close it is.\n\n3. **Calculate Ratios:**\n   - **9th Grade:** \\( \\frac{41.1}{39.4} \\approx 1.044 \\) (4."
