I'll multiply \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^5 \\) to get \\( x^6 + x^5 \\). Then, I'll subtract this from the original polynomial, resulting in \\( -x^5 - 3 \\).\n\nNext, I'll divide \\( -x^5 \\) by \\( x \\) to get \\( -x^4 \\). Multiplying \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( -x^4 \\) gives \\( -x^5 - x^4 \\). Subtracting this from the current polynomial yields \\( x^4 - 3 \\).\n\nRepeating this process, I'll continue dividing each term by \\( x \\) and subtracting the appropriate multiple of \\( x + 1 \\). This will eventually reduce the polynomial step by step until I reach a degree less than the divisor's degree.\n\nAfter performing all the divisions and subtractions, I'll arrive at the final quotient polynomial, which is \\( x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x + 1 \\).\n</think>\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Divide } x^6 - 3 \\text{ by } x + 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\boxed{x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x + 1}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]"
