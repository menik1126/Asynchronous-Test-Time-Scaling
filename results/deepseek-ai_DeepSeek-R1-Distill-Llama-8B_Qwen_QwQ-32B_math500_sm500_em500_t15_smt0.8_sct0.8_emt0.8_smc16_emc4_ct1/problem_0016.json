This means I can first find the modulus of \\(1 - i\\) and then raise it to the 8th power.\n\nCalculating the modulus of \\(1 - i\\) is done by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts: \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nNow, raising this modulus to the 8th power: \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\).\n\nSimplifying this, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) squared is 2, so \\((\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2)^4 = 16\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\) is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\), we can use the property of complex numbers that states \\( |z^n| = |z|^n \\). \n\n1. **Find the modulus of \\(1 - i\\):**\n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Raise the modulus to the 8th power:**\n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2)^{4} = 16\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
