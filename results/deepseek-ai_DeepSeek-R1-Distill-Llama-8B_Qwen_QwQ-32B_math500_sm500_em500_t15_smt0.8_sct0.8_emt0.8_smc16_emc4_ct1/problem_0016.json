The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is given by the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So, |1 - i| is sqrt(1\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = sqrt(2).\n\nNext, I recognize that raising a complex number to a power involves both its magnitude and its angle (argument). Raising the magnitude to that power gives |1 - i|^8 = (sqrt(2))^8 = 2^4 = 16.\n\nTherefore, |(1 - i)^8| equals 16.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\( |(1 - i)^8| \\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Absolute Value of a Complex Number\nThe absolute value (or modulus) of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) is given by:\n\\[\n|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\nIn this case, the complex number is \\( 1 - i \\), so:\n\\[\n|1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply De Moivre's Theorem\nDe Moivre's Theorem states that for any complex number \\( z = r(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta) \\) and integer \\( n \\):\n\\[\nz^n = r^n (\\cos(n\\theta) + i\\sin(n\\theta))\n\\]\nThe modulus of \\( z^n \\) is:\n\\[\n|z^n| = r^n\n\\]\nHere, \\( 1 - i \\) can be expressed in polar form. The modulus \\( r \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) (from Step 1), and the angle \\( \\theta \\) (argument) is \\( -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Modulus of \\( (1 - i)^8 \\)\nUsing De Moivre's Theorem:\n\\[\n|(1 - i)^8| = |\\sqrt{2}^8 (\\cos(8 \\times -\\frac{\\pi}{4"
