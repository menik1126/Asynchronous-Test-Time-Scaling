            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, let me break this down. \n\nFirst, I see the table has four columns: Grade, Males, and Females. For each grade, it shows the percentage of students who are male and female bus riders. The problem mentions that 300 males and 300 females in each grade were surveyed. I think that means there are 300 boys and 300 girls in each grade, so each total is 600 students per grade? Or wait, maybe 300 males and 300 females in total across all grades? No, the wording says \"in each grade,\" so each grade has 300 males and 300 females surveyed. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, for each grade, the number of male bus riders would be 300 multiplied by the percentage of males, and similarly for females. Then, I need to find for which grade the number of males is closest to 135% of the number of females.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\nFor each grade, compute:\n- Male bus riders = 300 * Male percentage\n- Female bus riders = 300 * Female percentage\nThen, check if Male ≈ 1.35 * Female.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute Male / Female and see if it's close to 1.35. That might be easier.\n\nLet me create a plan:\n\n1. For each grade, compute the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders.\n2. Compare each ratio to 1.35 and see which one is closest.\n\nSo, let's do this step by step for each grade.\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n- Males: 41.1%\n- Females: 39.4%\nCompute ratio: 41.1 / 39.4 ≈ 1.043\n\nHmm, 1.043 is less than 1.35. So, 9th grade is not the one.\n\nNext, 10th grade:\n- Males: 34.4%\n- Females: 33.1%\nRatio: 34.4 / 33.1 ≈ 1.038\n\nAgain, less than 1.35.\n\n11th grade:\n- Males: 20.6%\n- Females: 13.8%\nRatio: 20.6 / 13.8 ≈ 1."

So, the difference is 0.142.\n\n12th grade:\n- Males: 11.6%\n- Females: 8.6%\nRatio: 11.6 / 8.6 ≈ 1.348\n\nWait, that's 1.348, which is very close to 1.35. Let me check that again. 11.6 divided by 8.6. Let me compute that more precisely.\n\n11.6 divided by 8.6. Let's see:\n\n8.6 * 1.35 = 8.6 * 1 + 8.6 * 0.35 = 8.6 + 3.01 = 11.61. Oh! Wait a second, 8.6 multiplied by 1.35 is exactly 11.61. But the male percentage is 11.6, which is just slightly less than 11.61. So the ratio is 11.6 / 8.6 ≈ 1.3488, which is approximately 1.3488. So that's 1.3488, which is just 0.0012 less than 1.35. That's really close.\n\nComparing the 11th grade ratio of ~1.492 (difference of +0.142) and 12th grade ratio of ~1.3488 (difference of -0.0012). The 12th grade is way closer. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculations again because that seems a big difference between 11th and 12th. Let me check each step again.\n\nStarting with 11th grade:\n\nMale percentage is 20.6%, so male riders are 20.6% of 300, which is 0.206 * 300 = 61.8 riders.\n\nFemale riders: 13.8% of 300 is 0.138 * "

Let me write it as 348/258 if I multiply numerator and denominator by 10.\n\n348 ÷ 258. Let's divide both by 6: 348/6=58, 258/6=43. So, 58/43 ≈ 1.3488.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 12th grade has a ratio of ~1.3488, which is 1.35 - 1.3488 = 0.0012 less than 1.35.\n\nComparing to 11th grade's ratio of ~1.492, which is 0.142 higher than 1.35.\n\nThus, the 12th grade is much closer to 1.35, while 11th grade is further away. \n\nWait, but earlier in my initial computation, I thought 12th grade was about 1.3488, which is very close to 1.35, while 11th grade is 1.492, which is further away. So 12th is closer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 12th grade's ratio is 1.3488, which is 1.35 - 1.3488 = 0.0012 difference, so almost exactly 1.35, but just slightly less.\n\nSo, the closest is 12th grade, because 1.3488 is only 0.0012 away, whereas 11th grade's ratio is 1.492, which is 0.142 away.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says \"the number of its male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders.\" So, for each grade, they want males ≈ 1.35 * females.\n\nSo, for 12th grade, males are 11.6% and females are "

So the male riders are 34.8, and 135% of female riders is 34.83. So the difference is just 0.03. That's really, really close.\n\nWait, so that's a difference of 0.03 riders. That's practically the same. So that's the closest possible.\n\nWait, but let me check 11th grade again. Let's compute 135% of female riders and see how far the male riders are from that.\n\n11th grade:\n\nFemales: 13.8% of 300 = 41.4\n\n135% of that is 1.35 * 41.4 = let's compute that:\n\n41.4 * 1.35.
