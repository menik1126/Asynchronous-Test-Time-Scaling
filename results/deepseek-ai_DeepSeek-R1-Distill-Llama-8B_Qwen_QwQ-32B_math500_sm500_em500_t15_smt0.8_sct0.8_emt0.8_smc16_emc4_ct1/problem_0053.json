Since the survey includes 300 males and 300 females in each grade, I can assume a sample size of 300 for both males and females in each grade.\n\nFor each grade, I'll calculate 135% of the female bus riders and compare it to the number of male bus riders. The difference between these two values will help me identify which grade is closest to the 135% ratio.\n\nStarting with the 9th grade:\n- Females: 39.4% of 300 = 11.82\n- 135% of females = 1.35 * 11.82 = 15.873\n- Males: 41.1% of 300 = 12.33\n- Difference: |15.873 - 12.33| = 3.543\n\nNext, the 10th grade:\n- Females: 33.1% of 300 = 9.93\n- 135% of females = 1.35 * 9.93 = 13.3585\n- Males: 34.4% of 300 = 10.32\n- Difference: |13.3585 - 10.32| = 3.0385\n\nFor the 11th grade:\n- Females: 13.8% of 300 = 4.14\n- 135% of females = 1.35 * 4.14 = 5.593\n- Males: 20.6% of 300 = 6.18\n- Difference: |5.593 - 6.18| = 0.587\n\nFinally, the 12th grade:\n- Females: 8.6% of 300 = 2.58\n- 135% of females = 1.35 * 2.58 = 3.483\n- Males: 11.6% of 300 = 3.48\n- Difference: |3.483 - 3.48| = 0.003\n\nAfter calculating the differences, the 12th grade has the smallest difference of 0.003, making it the closest to the 135% ratio.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to **135%** of the"
