            "output": "First, I need to determine how many ways Mr. Brennan can select 3 boys out of the 7 available. This is a combination problem because the order of selection doesn't matter.\n\nI'll use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, for the boys, C(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!) = 35 possible ways.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of the 4 available. Again, using the combination formula, C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!2!) = 6 possible ways.\n\nThen, to find the total number of ways to form the group, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls. That is, 35 * 6 = 210.\n\nTherefore, there are 210 different ways Mr. Brennan can select 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nMr. Brennan wants to select 3 boys and 2 girls from his statistics class. We'll use combinations to determine the number of ways this can be done.\n\n1. **Number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   The combination formula is:\n   \\[\n   C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \n   Using the combination formula again:\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total number of ways to form the group:**\n   \n   Multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls:\n   \\[\n   35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
