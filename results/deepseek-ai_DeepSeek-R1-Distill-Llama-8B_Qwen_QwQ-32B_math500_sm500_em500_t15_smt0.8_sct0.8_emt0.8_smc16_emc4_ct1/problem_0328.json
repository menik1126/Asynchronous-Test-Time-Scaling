In how many ways can he pick 3 boys and 2 girls to give a group presentation tomorrow? (The order in which the boys and girls are chosen does not matter.)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the total number of boys and girls:**\n   - **Boys:** 7\n   - **Girls:** 4\n\n2. **Determine how many boys to choose:**\n   - We need to choose **3 boys** out of **7**.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose the boys:**\n   - This is a combination problem because the order doesn't matter.\n   - The formula for combinations is:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the numbers:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}\n     \\]\n   - Calculating the factorial:\n     \\[\n     7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{5040}{"
