            "output": "To determine how many possible license plates can be formed, I'll start by analyzing the structure of the license plate.\n\nEach license plate consists of 2 different letters followed by 2 different one-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of possible combinations for the letters. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and since the letters must be different, the number of ways to choose the first letter is 26. For the second letter, there are 25 remaining options.\n\nSo, the total number of letter combinations is 26 multiplied by 25, which equals 650.\n\nNext, I'll consider the number part of the license plate. Each digit can be any number from 0 to 9, giving 10 possible choices for each digit. Since the digits must also be different, the first digit has 10 options, and the second digit has 9 remaining options.\n\nTherefore, the total number of number combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations. That means 650 multiplied by 90, resulting in 58,500.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Calculating the Number of Letter Combinations:**\n   - **First Letter:** There are 26 possible choices (A-Z).\n   - **Second Letter:** Since it must be different from the first, there are 25 remaining choices.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Letter Combinations} = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Digit Combinations:**\n   - **First Digit:** There are 10 possible choices (0-9).\n   - **Second Digit:** It must be different from the first, so there are 9 remaining choices.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Digit Combinations} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Number of License Plates:**\n   - Multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total License Plates} = 650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n   \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
