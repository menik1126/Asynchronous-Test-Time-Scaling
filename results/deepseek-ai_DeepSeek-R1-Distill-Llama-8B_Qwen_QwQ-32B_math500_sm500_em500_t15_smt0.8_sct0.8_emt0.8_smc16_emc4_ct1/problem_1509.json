Each license plate has two different letters followed by two different one-digit numbers.\n\nFor the letters, there are 26 possible letters in the English alphabet. Since each letter position can be any letter from A to Z, the number of combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 26.\n\nNext, for the numbers, there are 10 possible digits (0 through 9). Each digit position can be any of these 10 digits, so the number of combinations for the numbers is 10 multiplied by 10.\n\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, I multiply the combinations of letters by the combinations of numbers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of license plates is 26 multiplied by 26 multiplied by 10 multiplied by 10, which equals 676,000.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Number of Possible Letters\n- **Total letters available:** 26 (from A to Z)\n- **Number of letters per license plate:** 2\n- **Since the letters must be different, the number of possible combinations for the letters is:**\n  \n  \\[\n  26 \\times 26 = 676\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Possible Numbers\n- **Total digits available:** 10 (from 0 to 9)\n- **Number of digits per license plate:** 2\n- **Since the digits must be different, the number of possible combinations for the numbers is:**\n  \n  \\[\n  10 \\times 10 = 100\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine the Letter and Number Combinations\n- **Total number of license plates = (Number of letter combinations) × (Number of number combinations):**\n  \n  \\[\n  676 \\times 100 = 67,600\n  \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{67600}\n\\]"
