Let's see:\n\nGrouping \\(4 + 5 + 6\\) as a negative? Wait, but the original expression has a minus before 4. So if I group \\(4 + 5 + 6\\), but the minus is only before 4. So actually, the expression is \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4) + 5 + 6\\). To subtract a larger group, I need to have the minus apply to a larger term. For example, if I can make it \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\\), but the original expression has a plus after the 4. Let me check:\n\nOriginal expression: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. The minus is only before the 4. So to subtract a larger group, I need to have parentheses that make the subtraction apply to a group starting at 4 and including some terms after. For instance, if I do \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6\\), which we did earlier, that gives 3. Alternatively, \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\\). Let's see if that's allowed.\n\nWait, the original expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. To subtract (4 +5 +6), the parentheses would have to be placed such that the minus applies to all three terms. Let me see:\n\nThe expression would be 1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6). Let's compute that:\n\n1+2+3 =6, 4+5+6=15, so 6 -15 = -9. But is that a valid placement?\n\nWait, the original expression has a minus before 4, followed by +5 and +6. To make the minus apply to the entire 4+5+6, we need to group 4+5+6 and subtract that.
