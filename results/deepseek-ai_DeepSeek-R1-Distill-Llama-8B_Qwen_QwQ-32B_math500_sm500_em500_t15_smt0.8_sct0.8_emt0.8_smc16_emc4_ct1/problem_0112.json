This involves calculating the value of each bit based on its position, where each position represents a power of two.\n\nNext, I'll group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right. Each set of three digits will correspond to a single octal digit.\n\nAfter grouping, I'll convert each binary triplet to its decimal equivalent, which will then be translated into the corresponding octal digit.\n\nFinally, by combining all the octal digits, I will obtain the complete base eight representation of the original binary number.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\( 10101001110_2 \\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Binary to Octal Conversion:**\n   - **Binary** is base-2, and **Octal** is base-8.\n   - Since \\( 2^3 = 8 \\), we'll group the binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right. Each set of three binary digits will correspond to one octal digit.\n\n2. **Group the Binary Number into Triplets:**\n   - Break the binary number \\( 10101001110 \\) into groups of three starting from the right:\n     ```\n     1 01 010 011 10\n     ```\n   - However, since the total number of digits is 10, which isn't a multiple of three, we'll need to add a leading zero to make it 11 digits:\n     ```\n     0 101 010 011 10\n     ```\n\n3. **Convert Each Binary Triplet to Octal:**\n   - Each triplet of binary digits corresponds to a value in octal. Convert each triplet as follows:\n     - **101**: \\( 1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5_8 \\)\n     - **010**: \\( 0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0 = 0 + 2 + 0 = 2_8 \\)\n     - **011**: \\( 0 \\times 2^"

Let me recheck the grouping.\n\n   **Correct Grouping:**\n   - Original binary number: \\( 10101001110 \\)\n   - Adding a leading zero to make it 11 digits: \\( 010\\ 101\\ 001\\ 110 \\)\n   - Wait, let me count again:\n     - The original number is 10 digits: 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0? Wait, actually, let me count the digits properly.\n\n   **Wait, let me count the digits in the original number:**\n   - The binary number is \\( 10101001110_2 \\). Let's count each digit:\n     1 (1), 0 (2), 1 (3), 0 (4), 1 (5), 0 (6), 0 (7), 1 (8), 1 (9), 1 (10), 0 (11). Wait, actually, it's 11 digits. So no need to add a leading zero. Let me group from the right:\n\n   Starting from the right (the last digit), group into threes:\n   - The number is: 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0\n   - From right to left:\n     - First triplet: 1 1 0 (positions 9-11)\n     - Next triplet: 0 1 1 (positions 6-8)\n     - Next triplet: 0 1 0 (positions 3-5)\n     - Next triplet: 1 0 1 (positions 1-2 and then leading zero? Wait, maybe I need to re-express.\n\n   Wait, perhaps better to write the number as:\n\n   Original"
