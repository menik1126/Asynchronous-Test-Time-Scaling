The hexagon has a side length of 16 cm.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the perimeter of the hexagon. Since a hexagon has 6 sides, I can multiply the side length by 6.\n\nNext, I'll determine the perimeter of the octagon by dividing the total perimeter of the hexagon by the number of sides in the octagon, which is 8.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the resulting perimeter by 8 to find the length of one side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\nTo find the length of each side of the regular octagon, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16 \\, \\text{cm} = 96 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of sides of the octagon.**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n\n3. **Calculate the perimeter of the octagon using the perimeter of the hexagon.**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of hexagon}}{\\text{Number of sides}} = \\frac{96 \\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the length of one side of the octagon.**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of one side of octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{\\text{Number of sides}} = \\frac{12 \\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 1.5 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{1.5}\\) cm"
