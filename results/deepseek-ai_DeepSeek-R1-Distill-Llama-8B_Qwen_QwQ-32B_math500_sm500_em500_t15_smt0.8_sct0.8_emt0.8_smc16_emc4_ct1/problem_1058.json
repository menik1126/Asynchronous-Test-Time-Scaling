            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since all sides of a regular hexagon are equal, I can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 6.\n\nNext, the problem states that the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon. To find the side length of the octagon, I'll divide the total perimeter by the number of sides, which is 8.\n\nBy calculating the side length of the octagon and ensuring all steps are mathematically sound, I can determine the correct length of each side.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Perimeter of the Regular Hexagon**\n\nA regular hexagon has 6 equal sides. Given that each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, the perimeter of the hexagon can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times \\text{side length} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Perimeter of the Regular Octagon**\n\nThe problem states that the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon. Since an octagon has 8 equal sides:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{octagon}} = \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{hexagon}} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Side Length of the Regular Octagon**\n\nTo find the length of one side of the octagon, divide the total perimeter by the number of sides:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length}_{\\text{octagon}} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{octagon}}}{8} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nEach side of the regular octagon is \\(\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\\) long."
