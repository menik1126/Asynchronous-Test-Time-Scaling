            "output": "To find the number of trailing zeros in 42 factorial, I need to determine how many times the number 10 is a factor in 42! This is because each trailing zero is produced by a multiplication of 2 and 5.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!. Starting from the number 5, every fifth number contributes at least one 5. So, I'll divide 42 by 5 to find how many multiples of 5 there are.\n\n42 divided by 5 equals 8.4, but I'll take the floor of this value, which is 8. This means there are 8 multiples of 5 in 42!.\n\nNext, I'll look for higher powers of 5. Multiples of 25 contribute an additional 5. Dividing 42 by 25 gives 1.68, and taking the floor gives 1. So, there is 1 multiple of 25 in 42!.\n\nThere are no higher powers of 5 (like 125) that are factors of 42! because 125 is greater than 42.\n\nNow, I'll sum the number of 5s from each step. There are 8 from the multiples of 5 and 1 from the multiples of 25, totaling 9 fives.\n\nSince there are always more multiples of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of 2s will be sufficient to pair with the 9 fives, resulting in 9 trailing zeros in 42!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of trailing zeros in \\( 42! \\), we need to count how many times the number 10 is a factor in \\( 42! \\). Since \\( 10 = 2 \\times 5 \\), each trailing zero is produced by a pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factors of \\( 42! \\). \n\nThere will always be more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, so the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.\n\nHere's how to calculate it:\n\n1. **Count the multiples of 5:**\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n   \\]\n   There are 8 multiples of 5 in 42!.\n\n2. **"
