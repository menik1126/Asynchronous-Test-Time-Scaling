            "output": "To determine how many zeros are at the end of 42!, I need to count the number of times the factor 10 is a factor in 42!.\n\nA 10 is composed of 2 and 5, so I need to find how many pairs of 2 and 5 are in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. \n\nI can do this by dividing 42 by 5, which gives 8.4. Taking the floor of this result, I get 8. This means that 5 is a factor of the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of times 2 appears as a factor in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nDividing 42 by 2 gives 21, so there are 21 multiples of 2. Dividing by 4 gives 10.5, so there are 10 multiples of 4. Dividing by 8 gives 5.25, so there are 5 multiples of 8. Dividing by 16 gives 2.625, so there are 2 multiples of 16. Dividing by 32 gives 1.3125, so there is 1 multiple of 32. Adding these up, we get 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39.\n\nSince there are 8 fives and 39 twos in the prime factors of 42!, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the smaller count, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, 42! ends with 8 zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeros are at the end of \\(42!\\), we need to count the number of times \\(10\\) appears as a factor in the prime factorization of \\(42!\\). Since \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), we can count the number of pairs of \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) in the prime factors of \\(42!\\). The number of trailing zeros is determined by the smaller count of these pairs.\n\n**Step 1: Count the number of \\(5\\)s in the prime factors of \\(42!\\)**\n- Divide \\(42\\) by \\(5\\): \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5"
