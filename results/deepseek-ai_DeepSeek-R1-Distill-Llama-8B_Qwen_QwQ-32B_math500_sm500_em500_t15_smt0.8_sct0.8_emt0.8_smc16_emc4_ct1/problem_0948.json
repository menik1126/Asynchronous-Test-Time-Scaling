            "output": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem to simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\). Hmm, let me break it down step by step. First, I remember that when simplifying fractions with exponents, I can combine the coefficients and subtract the exponents of the same base in the numerator and the denominator. \n\nLet me write down the numerator and the denominator separately. The numerator is \\(10r^3\\) multiplied by \\(4r^6\\), and the denominator is \\(8r^4\\). So, starting with the numerator, I can multiply the coefficients first. That means 10 times 4. Hmm, 10 times 4 is 40. So, the coefficient part of the numerator simplifies to 40.\n\nNext, for the variables, I have \\(r^3\\) times \\(r^6\\). Since the bases are the same, I can add the exponents. So, 3 plus 6 is 9. Therefore, the numerator simplifies to \\(40r^9\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the denominator, it's just \\(8r^4\\). The coefficient is 8, and the variable part is \\(r^4\\). \n\nSo now, the entire expression is \\(\\frac{40r^9}{8r^4}\\). I think I can simplify this by dividing both the coefficients and subtracting the exponents of the variables. Let's start with the coefficients. 40 divided by 8 is 5. That's straightforward.\n\nFor the variables, I have \\(r^9\\) divided by \\(r^4\\). When dividing exponents with the same base, I subtract the exponents. So, 9 minus 4 is 5. Therefore, the variable part simplifies to \\(r^5\\).\n\nPutting it all together, after simplifying the coefficients and the exponents, I have 5 times \\(r^5\\), which is just \\(5r^5\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the numerator, 10 times 4 is definitely 40, and \\(r^3 \\times r^6 = r^{3+6} = r^9\\). The denominator is just \\(8r^4\\). Then, dividing 40 by 8 gives 5,"

I think I did it right.\n\nHmm, maybe I should also consider if there are any like terms or if I missed any rules. No, I think it's just about combining the coefficients and subtracting exponents. There's no addition here because it's division, not multiplication. So, yeah, \\(5r^5\\) should be the correct simplification.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the coefficients in the numerator**: \\(10 \\times 4 = 40\\).\n2. **Add the exponents of \\(r\\) in the numerator**: \\(r^3 \\times r^6 = r^{3+6} = r^9\\).\n3. The expression becomes \\(\\frac{40r^9}{8r^4}\\).\n4. **Divide the coefficients**: \\(\\frac{40}{8} = 5\\).\n5. **Subtract the exponents of \\(r\\)**: \\(\\frac{r^9}{r^4} = r^{9-4} = r^5\\).\n6. Combine the results: \\(5r^5\\).\n\nFinal simplified form: \\(\\boxed{5r^5}\\)."
