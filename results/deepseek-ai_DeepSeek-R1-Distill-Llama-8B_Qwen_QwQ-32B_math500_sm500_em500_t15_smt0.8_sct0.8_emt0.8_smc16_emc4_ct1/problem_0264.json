            "output": "First, I need to find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets. I know that 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, which means 1 Drinket is equal to 3/7 of a Blinket.\n\nNext, I'll convert 56 Drinkets into Blinkets by multiplying 56 by 3/7. This gives me 24 Blinkets.\n\nThen, I'll convert Blinkets into Trinkets by dividing 24 Blinkets by 4, since 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets. This results in 6 Trinkets.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are equal to 6 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, let's follow the given exchange rates step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- 1 Trinket (T) = 4 Blinkets (B)\n- 3 Blinkets (B) = 7 Drinkets (D)\n\n**Step 1: Find the relationship between Drinkets and Blinkets.**\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[\n3B = 7D \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 1B = \\frac{7}{3}D\n\\]\nSo, 1 Blinket is equal to \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\) Drinkets.\n\n**Step 2: Convert Drinkets to Blinkets.**\nWe need to find the value of 56 Drinkets in Blinkets:\n\\[\n56D \\times \\frac{1B}{1D} \\times \\frac{1D}{\\frac{7}{3}D} = 56D \\times \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{1}{1} = 24B\n\\]\nThus, 56 Drinkets equal 24 Blinkets.\n\n**Step 3: Convert Blinkets to Trinkets.**\nUsing the first equation:\n\\[\n24B \\div 4B/T = 6T\n\\]\nTherefore, 24 Blinkets equal 6 Trinkets.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"
