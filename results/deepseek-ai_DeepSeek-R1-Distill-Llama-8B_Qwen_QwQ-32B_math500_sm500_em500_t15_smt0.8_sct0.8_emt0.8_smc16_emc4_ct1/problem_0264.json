The problem states that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, which can be written as T = 4B.\n\nNext, I need to find the connection between Blinkets and Drinkets (D). It's given that 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, so 3B = 7D.\n\nMy goal is to find the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets. To do this, I'll start by solving for 1 Drinket in terms of Blinkets. From 3B = 7D, dividing both sides by 7 gives B = (3/7)D. This means 1 Drinket is equal to 7/3 Blinkets or approximately 2.333 Blinkets.\n\nNow, I'll express 56 Drinkets in Blinkets by multiplying 1D by 56: 56D = 56 * (3/7)B = 24B. So, 56 Drinkets equal 24 Blinkets.\n\nFinally, I'll convert Blinkets to Trinkets using the initial equation T = 4B. Since 24B = 56D, substituting gives 24B = 56D. Therefore, 56 Drinkets are equal to 56 * (1/4)T = 14T. This means 56 Drinkets are worth 14 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - **Trinkets (T) and Blinkets (B):**  \n     \\(1\\,T = 4\\,B\\)  \n     This means 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets.\n   \n   - **Blinkets (B) and Drinkets (D):**  \n     \\(3\\,B = 7\\,D\\)  \n     This means 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets.\n\n2. **Find the Conversion Rate Between Trinkets and Drinkets:**\n   \n   - **Convert Blinkets to Drinkets:**  \n     From \\(3\\,B = 7\\,D\\), we get:  \n     \\(1\\,B = \\frac{7}{3}\\,D\\)  \n     Or, \\(1\\,D = \\frac{"
