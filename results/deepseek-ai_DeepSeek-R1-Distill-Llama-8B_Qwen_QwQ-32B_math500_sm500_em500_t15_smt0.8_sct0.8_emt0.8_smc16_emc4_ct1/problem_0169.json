Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that cube roots can be tricky, but I also recall that if you have something like the cube root of a number equals another number, you can get rid of the cube root by cubing both sides. So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me write down the equation again to make it clearer: cube root of (x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16. To get rid of the cube root, I'll cube both sides. That should simplify things.\n\nSo, if I cube the left side, it'll just become x\u00b2 - 4x + 4, because the cube and the cube root cancel each other out. And on the right side, I'll have 16 cubed. I need to compute 16\u00b3. Let's see, 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Hmm, 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 plus 1536 equals 4096. So, 16\u00b3 is 4096.\n\nNow my equation is simplified to x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096. Alright, next step is to move everything to one side so that I can solve for x. Let's subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplify that, 4 minus 4096 is -4092. So, now the equation is x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nHmm, okay, now I have a quadratic equation. I need to solve for x. The standard quadratic formula is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of (b\u00b2 minus 4ac) all over 2a. In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Let me plug those in.\n\nSo, a = 1, b = -4, c = -4092. Plugging into the quadratic formula: x = ["

Then inside the square root, we have (-4)^2, which is 16. Then, subtract 4*1*(-4092). So that's 16 - (4*(-4092)). Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I do the signs correctly. It's b squared minus 4ac, so 16 - 4*1*(-4092). So, that becomes 16 + 4*4092.\n\nWait, yeah, because 4*1*(-4092) is -16168, and subtracting that is like adding the positive. So, 16 + 16168. Let me compute that. 16 plus 16168 is 16184.\n\nSo now, the square root of 16184. Hmm, I need to find sqrt(16184). I'm not sure what that is off the top of my head. Let me try to estimate. I know that 127 squared is 16129 because 120\u00b2 is 14400, 130\u00b2 is 16900, so 127\u00b2 is 16129. So 127 squared is 16129, and we have 16184, which is 55 more than that. So sqrt(16184) is a little more than 127. Let me see if 127.5 squared is closer. 127.5\u00b2 = (127 + 0.5)^2 = 127\u00b2 + 2*127*0.5 + 0.5\u00b2 = 16129 + 127 + 0.25 = 16256.25. Hmm, that's higher than 16184. So it's somewhere between 127 and 127.5.\n\nLet me try 127.2\u00b2: 127*127 = 16129, 0.2*0.2=0.04, and cross terms 2*127*0.2=50.8. So total is 16129 + 50.8 + 0.04 = 16179.84. Still less than 16184. 127.2 squared is 16179.84.\n\n127.3 squared: adding another 0.1. So, "

So somewhere between 127.2 and 127.3. Let me try linear approximation.\n\nThe difference between 127.2\u00b2 and 127.3\u00b2 is 16205.29 - 16179.84 = 25.45. We need to find how much more than 127.2 gives us 16184.\n\nFrom 127.2\u00b2 = 16179.84, so 16184 - 16179.84 = 4.16. So, we need 4.16 out of 25.45. So, approximately 4.16 / 25.45 \u2248 0.1638. So, sqrt(16184) \u2248 127.2 + 0.1638 \u2248 127.3638.\n\nSo, approximately 127.364.\n\nSo, going back to the quadratic formula, sqrt(16184) \u2248127.364. So, plugging back into the equation:\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 127.364]/2.\n\nSo, two solutions: one with plus and one with minus.\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 127.364)/2 = 131.364/2 \u2248 65.682.\n\nSecond solution: (4 - 127.364)/2 = (-123.364)/2 \u2248 -61.682.\n\nBut the question asks for the positive value of x. So, 65.682 is approximately positive 65.682.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct because approximating square roots can sometimes lead to inaccuracies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the quadratic or see if 16184 is a perfect square. Wait, let me see. Earlier I thought that 127^2 is 16129, which is 127 squared. 127*127=16129, 128*128=16384. So, 127^2=16129, 128\u00b2=16384. So 16184 is between them. So, not a perfect square.

So, sqrt(16184)=sqrt(16*1014)=4*sqrt(1014).\n\nSo, sqrt(16184)=4*sqrt(1014). So, maybe that's a better way to express it.\n\nSo, going back, the quadratic formula gives x = [4 \u00b1 4*sqrt(1014)] / 2.\n\nWait, wait. Let's compute that again.\n\nEarlier, I had sqrt(16184) = sqrt(16*1014) = 4*sqrt(1014). So, plugging back in:\n\nx = [4 \u00b1 4*sqrt(1014)] / 2. Hmm, okay, so factor out the 4:\n\nx = [4(1 \u00b1 sqrt(1014))]/2. Which simplifies to 2[1 \u00b1 sqrt(1014)].\n\nSo, x = 2 + 2*sqrt(1014) or x = 2 - 2*sqrt(1014). Since sqrt(1014) is approximately sqrt(1024)=32, so sqrt(1014) is about 31.86. So, 2*sqrt(1014)=63.72.\n\nSo, x \u2248 2 + 63.72 \u2248 65.72, or x \u2248 2 - 63.72 \u2248 -61.72.\n\nSo, the positive solution is approximately 65.72, which matches our earlier approximation.\n\nBut let me verify the solution by plugging back into the original equation to make sure.\n\nOriginal equation: cube root of (x\u00b2 -4x +4) =16.\n\nCompute x\u00b2 -4x +4 for x \u224865.72.\n\nx \u224865.72, so x\u00b2 is about (65.72)^2.

The derivative of x\u00b3 is 3x\u00b2. So, the change in x needed to get a change in y is approximately delta_x \u2248 delta_y / (3x\u00b2).\n\nHere, delta_y is 2.5184, and x is approximately 15.95.

So, 2890 +1156=4046.\n\nThus, x\u00b2=4 +68\u221a14 +4046=4050 +68\u221a14.\n\nCompute 4x:\n\n4*(2 +17\u221a14)=8 +68\u221a14.\n\nThus, x\u00b2 -4x=(4050 +68\u221a14) - (8 +68\u221a14)=4042 +0=4042.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 -4x +4=4042 +4=4046.\n\nWait, that's not 4096. So, x\u00b2 -4x +4=4046, not 4096.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because we set x\u00b2 -4x +4=4096. So, this must mean that there's some error in the process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value is correct, but due to the decimal approximation, I thought it was.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the calculator I'm using is in degrees or something, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I can use exact values.\n\nWait, but  x=2 +17\u221a14.\n\nCompute x\u00b2 -4x +4= (2 +17\u221a14)^2 -4*(2 +17\u221a14) +4.\n\n= (4 + 68\u221a14 + (17\u221a14)^2) -8 -68\u221a14 +4.\n\n=4 +68\u221a14 + (289*14) -8 -68\u221a14 +4.\n\nCompute 289*14=4046.\n\nSo, 4 +68\u221a14 +4046 -8 -68\u221a14 +4.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4 +4046 -8 +4= (4 +4046)=4050; 4050 -"
