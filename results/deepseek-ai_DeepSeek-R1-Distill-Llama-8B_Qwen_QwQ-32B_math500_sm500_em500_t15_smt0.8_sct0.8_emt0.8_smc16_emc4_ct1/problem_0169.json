Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation is \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\). I remember that when dealing with cube roots, one way to eliminate them is by cubing both sides of the equation. That should help me get rid of the radical and make the equation easier to handle.\n\nSo, if I cube both sides, it should look like this:\n\n\\( (\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3 \\)\n\nNow, I need to calculate \\( 16^3 \\). Let me do that. 16 multiplied by itself three times. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Hmm, let me break that down. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. So, adding those together, 2560 + 1536 equals 4096. So, \\( 16^3 = 4096 \\).\n\nNow, substituting that back into the equation, I have:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \\)\n\nOkay, so the next step is to bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0 \\)\n\nSimplifying the constants, 4 minus 4096 is -4092. So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\). To solve for \\( x \\), I can use the quadratic formula, which is:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\)\n\nIn this equation, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), and \\( c = -4092 \\"

            "output": "). Let me plug these values into the quadratic formula.\n\nFirst, compute the discriminant \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\):\n\n\\( D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092) \\)\n\\( D = 16 + 16368 \\)\n\\( D = 16384 \\)\n\nHmm, 16384 seems like a power of 2. Let me verify: 2^14 is 16384, yes. So, the square root of 16384 is 128, because 128*128 is 16384.\n\nSo, plugging back into the formula:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm 128}{2(1)} \\)\n\\( x = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2} \\)\n\nThis gives two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66 \\)\n2. \\( x = \\frac{4 - 128}{2} = \\frac{-124}{2} = -62 \\)\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the positive value of \\( x \\), so \\( x = 66 \\) is the solution.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. I started with the cube root equation and cubed both sides correctly to remove the radical.\n2. Calculated \\( 16^3 \\) as 4096, which is correct.\n3. Formed the quadratic equation correctly: \\( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \\) becomes \\( x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0 \\). Yes, because 4096 - 4 is 4092, and the middle term is -4.\n4. Applied the quadratic formula with \\( a=1 \\), \\( b=-4 \\), \\( c=-4092 \\). Correct.\n5. Calculated the discriminant as 16 + 16368 = 16384, which is correct. Square root of that is 128.\n6. Plugged into quadratic formula: \\( (4 + 128)/2 = 66 \\) and \\( (4 - 128)/2 = -62 \\). Correct.\n\nTherefore, the positive value is 66. I think this is solid.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is solved by cubing both sides to eliminate the"
