Plugging in the radius of 3 inches, the sphere's volume is (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic inches.\n\nNext, I'll find the volume of the cube. Since the sphere is formed by removing metal from the cube's corners, the cube's edge length is the key to solving this. Each corner of the cube is a right-angled corner, and removing a sphere from each corner creates a smaller cube inside the original cube.\n\nEach corner truncation removes a small cube from the original cube. The volume removed from each corner is equal to the volume of one-eighth of a sphere, which is (1/8)(4/3)πr³. Since there are 8 corners in a cube, the total volume removed is 8*(1/8)(4/3)πr³ = (4/3)πr³. \n\nTo find the edge length of the original cube, I'll set up the equation: V_cube - (4/3)πr³ = V_smallsphere. Simplifying, V_cube = V_smallsphere + (4/3)πr³. Plugging in the known volume of the sphere, V_cube = 36π + 36π = 72π cubic inches.\n\nFinally, solving for the edge length of the cube, I find that the edge length is 6 inches. Therefore, the volume of the cube is 6³ = 216 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the sphere**:\n   \n   The sphere has a radius of 3 inches. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging in the radius:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (27) = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n   \\]\n\n"
