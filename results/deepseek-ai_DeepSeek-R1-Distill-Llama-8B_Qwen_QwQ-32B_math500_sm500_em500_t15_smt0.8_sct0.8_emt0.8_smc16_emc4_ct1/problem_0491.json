            "output": "To determine the volume of the original cube, I start by understanding that the steel sphere is created by cutting off the corners of the cube. This process removes a portion of the cube's volume to form the sphere.\n\nThe sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is twice that, which is 6 inches. This diameter is related to the cube's side length because when you cut off a corner to create a sphere, the sphere's diameter equals the cube's side length.\n\nTherefore, the original cube must have a side length of 6 inches. Calculating the volume of the cube involves squaring the side length and then multiplying by the cube's area. So, the volume is \\(6^3 = 216\\) cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, let's analyze the relationship between the sphere and the cube step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Sphere and Cube Relationship:**\n   \n   - **Sphere Diameter:** The sphere has a radius of 3 inches. Therefore, its diameter is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Diameter} = 2 \\times \\text{Radius} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Cube's Side Length:** When you cut off a corner of a cube to form a sphere, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. This is because the corner that's removed is a right-angled triangle, and the sphere fits perfectly into that space.\n\n2. **Calculating the Cube's Volume:**\n   \n   - **Side Length of the Cube:** As determined, the side length of the cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Side length of cube} = 6 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Volume of the Cube:** The volume \\( V \\) of a cube is calculated by:\n     \\[\n     V = \\text{Side}^3\n     \\]\n     Substituting the side length:\n     \\[\n     V = 6^3 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe volume of the original cube is \\(\\boxed{216}\\) cubic inches."
