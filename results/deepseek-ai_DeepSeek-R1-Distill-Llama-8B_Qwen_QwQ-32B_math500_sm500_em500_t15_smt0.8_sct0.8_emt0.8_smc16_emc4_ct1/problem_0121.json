Starting from the rightmost bit, the positions represent 2⁰, 2¹, 2², and so on.\n\nNext, I'll multiply each binary digit by the corresponding power of two. For example, the rightmost bit is multiplied by 2⁰, the next one by 2¹, and so on.\n\nAfter calculating the products, I'll add them all together to get the total value in binary form.\n\nFinally, I'll convert this decimal value to base eight by dividing it by 8 and finding the quotient and remainder at each step. Repeating this process until the quotient is zero will give me the base eight representation.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** The binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) is equal to what number in base eight?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Binary to Octal Conversion:**\n   - Binary numbers are base 2, and octal numbers are base 8.\n   - The conversion involves grouping the binary digits into sets of three starting from the right (least significant bit).\n\n2. **Group Binary Digits into Sets of Three:**\n   - Start from the right, group the bits into sets of three. If there are fewer than three bits left, pad with leading zeros.\n\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   10101001110_{2} \\\\\n   &= 1\\ 01\\ 010\\ 011\\ 10_{2} \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n   \n   However, to make the leftmost group also have three bits, add a leading zero:\n\n   \\[\n   010\\ 101\\ 001\\ 110_{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert Each Binary Group to Octal:**\n   - Each group of three binary digits corresponds to a single octal digit.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   010_{2} &= 2_{8} \\\\\n   101_{2} &= 5_{8} \\\\\n   001_{2} &= 1_{8} \\\\\n   110_{2} &= 6_{8} \\\\\n  "
