Similarly, 110 converts to 6.\n\nFor the group with two digits, 10, it converts to 2.\n\nFinally, I'll combine all the hexadecimal values together to form the final base eight number, which is 52A2_8.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conversion Process:**\n   - Binary to Octal conversion is done by grouping binary digits into sets of three, starting from the right.\n   - Each set of three binary digits corresponds to a single octal digit.\n   - If there are fewer than three binary digits on the left, a leading zero is added to make complete groups.\n\n2. **Group the Binary Digits:**\n   - The binary number is \\(10101001110_2\\).\n   - Starting from the right, group the digits into sets of three:\n     ```\n     10 101 0 110\n     ```\n     - Note: Add a leading zero to make the first group complete.\n     - The groups become:\n       ```\n       010 10 101 110\n       ```\n\n3. **Convert Each Binary Group to Octal:**\n   - Each group of three binary digits corresponds to an octal (base 8) digit.\n   - Use the conversion table for binary to octal:\n     ```\n     000 = 0\n     001 = 1\n     010 = 2\n     011 = 3\n     100 = 4\n     101 = 5\n     110 = 6\n     111 = 7\n     ```\n   - Convert each group:\n     - \\(010_2 = 2_8\\)\n     - \\(10_2 = 2_8\\) (Note: Since this group has only two digits,"
