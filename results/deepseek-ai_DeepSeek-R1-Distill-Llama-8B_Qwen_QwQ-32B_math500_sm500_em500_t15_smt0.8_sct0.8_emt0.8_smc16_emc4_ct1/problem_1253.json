This will give me the quotient and remainder, which are essential for the conversion.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient from the first division and divide it by 6 again to continue the process. Repeating this step will eventually reduce the quotient to zero.\n\nOnce I have all the remainders from each division, I'll arrange them in reverse order to obtain the final base six number.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of \\(999_{10}\\), we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide the decimal number by 6 and record the remainder.**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **First digit (rightmost):** 3\n\n2. **Continue dividing the quotient by 6.**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Second digit:** 4\n\n3. **Divide the new quotient by 6 again.**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Third digit:** 3\n\n4. **Finally, divide the last quotient by 6.**\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Fourth digit:** 4\n\n5. **Arrange the remainders in reverse order to get the final base six number.**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Base six equivalent} = 4 \\times 6^3 + 3 \\times 6^2 + 4 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 4 \\times 216 + 3 \\times 36 + 4 \\times 6 + 3 \\times 1 = 864 + 108 + 24 + 3 = 999\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the base six equivalent of \\(999_{10}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1344_6}\n\\]"
