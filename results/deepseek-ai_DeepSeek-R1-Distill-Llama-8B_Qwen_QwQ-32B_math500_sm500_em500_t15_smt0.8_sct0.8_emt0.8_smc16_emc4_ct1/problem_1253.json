I remember that converting numbers from base ten to another base involves dividing the number by the new base and keeping track of the remainders. But let me try to recall the exact steps.\n\nFirst, I think the process is called \"divmod\" because you divide and then find the modulus (remainder). So, for each step, I divide the number by 6 and then write down the remainder, then use the quotient for the next step. I need to keep doing this until the quotient is zero. Then, the base six number is the remainders read from bottom to top.\n\nAlright, let me start with 999 divided by 6. Hmm, 6 goes into 999 how many times? Let me calculate: 6 times 166 is 996. So, 166 times 6 is 996. That leaves a remainder of 999 minus 996, which is 3. So, the first remainder is 3.\n\nNow, take the quotient 166 and divide that by 6. 6 times 27 is 162. That means 166 minus 162 is 4. So, the remainder is 4.\n\nNext, take the new quotient, 27, and divide by 6. 6 times 4 is 24. So, 27 minus 24 is 3. Remainder is 3 again.\n\nThen, take the quotient 4 and divide by 6. 6 goes into 4 zero times, so the quotient is 0 and the remainder is 4.\n\nSince the quotient is now zero, I can stop here. Now, I need to write the remainders from the last division to the first. So, the remainders in order are 4, 3, 3, and then 4? Wait, let me list them step by step:\n\n1. 999 \u00f7 6 = 166 remainder 3\n2. 166 \u00f7 6 = 27 remainder 4\n3. 27 \u00f7 6 = 4 remainder 3\n4. 4 \u00f7 6 = 0 remainder 4\n\nSo, the remainders are 3, 4, 3, 4. But when read from last to first, it should be 4, 3, 4, 3"

            "output": "? Wait, no, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think again. The first remainder is the least significant digit, right? So when you write them in reverse order, starting from the last division. Let me see:\n\nThe first division gives remainder 3 (the least significant digit in base 6). The next division gives 4 (next digit), then 3, then the last division gives 4 (most significant digit). So the digits are 4 (from last division), then 3, then 4, then 3. So putting them together, it's 4 3 4 3? Wait, that would be 4343 in base 6?\n\nWait, let me check again step by step:\n\nFirst step: 999 divided by 6 is 166 with remainder 3. So the first digit (rightmost) is 3.\n\nSecond step: 166 divided by 6 is 27 with remainder 4. Next digit to the left is 4.\n\nThird step: 27 divided by 6 is 4 with remainder 3. Next digit is 3.\n\nFourth step: 4 divided by 6 is 0 with remainder 4. The next digit is 4. Since the quotient is now 0, we stop.\n\nSo the remainders, from last to first, are 4 (from the fourth step), 3 (third step), 4 (second step), and 3 (first step). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the order is the last remainder is the first digit. Let me think of it as a stack. Each remainder is pushed onto the stack, and then you pop them off in reverse order.\n\nWait, let me list the remainders in the order they were obtained:\n\n1. 3 (from first division)\n2. 4 (second division)\n3. 3 (third division)\n4. 4 (fourth division)\n\nSo when you reverse the order, the digits are 4, 3, 4, 3. So the number is 4343 base 6?\n\nHmm, but let me verify this. Let me compute 4343 in base 6 back to decimal to see if it equals 999.\n\nCalculating 4*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6 + "

Yes, that works!\n\nSo the base six equivalent of 999 in base 10 is 4343 in base 6.\n\nWait, is there a faster way? I remember sometimes people use exponents to compute it. Let me try another method to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, 999 divided by 6 is 166.5, but since we're dealing with integer division, 166 with remainder 3. Then 166 divided by 6 is 27.666, so 27 with remainder 4. 27 divided by 6 is 4.5, so 4 with remainder 3. 4 divided by 6 is 0.666, so 0 with remainder 4. So the remainders are 3,4,3,4 as above.\n\nAnother way: maybe using logarithms? But that might complicate things for exact division. I think the step-by-step division method is the standard way.\n\nYes, I'm confident now. So the answer is 4343 base 6.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\(999_{10}\\) to base six, we repeatedly divide by 6 and record the remainders.\n\n1. \\(999 \\div 6 = 166\\) with a remainder of 3.\n2. \\(166 \\div 6 = 27\\) with a remainder of 4.\n3. \\(27 \\div 6 = 4\\) with a remainder of 3.\n4. \\(4 \\div 6 = 0\\) with a remainder of 4.\n\nReading the remainders from last to first, the base six equivalent is \\(4343_6\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4343_6}\n\\]"
