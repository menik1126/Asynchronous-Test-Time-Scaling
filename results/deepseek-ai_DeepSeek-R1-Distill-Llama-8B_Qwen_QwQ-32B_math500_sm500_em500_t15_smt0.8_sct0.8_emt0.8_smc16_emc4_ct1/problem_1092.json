Hmm, let me start by understanding the function step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f is defined recursively with three cases. Let me write them down clearly:\n\n1. For i = 0 and j between 0 and 4 inclusive, f(0, j) is mod_5(j + 1). So that means f(0, 0) is 1, f(0,1) is 2, f(0,2) is 3, f(0,3) is 4, and f(0,4) is 0 because 5 mod 5 is 0.\n\n2. For i >= 1 and j = 0, f(i, 0) is f(i - 1, 1). That seems like a base case that steps down to i - 1 and j = 1.\n\n3. For i >= 1 and 1 <= j <= 4, f(i, j) is f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). So this is a recursive case where to compute f(i, j), I need to compute f(i, j - 1), then use that result as the new j value for f(i - 1, ...).\n\nOkay, so starting from f(0, j), everything else builds on that. Since we're dealing with f(2015, 2), which is a large i but small j, maybe the function cycles after a certain point. Let's try to see the pattern for small i first.\n\nLet me compute f(i, j) for small i and j to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n- f(0, 0) = 1\n- f(0, 1) = 2\n- f(0, 2) = 3\n- f(0, 3) = 4\n- f(0, 4) = 0\n\nNow, for i = 1, j = 0:\n- f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2\n\nFor i = 1, j = 1:\n- f(1, 1) = f(0, f(1, 0)) = f(0,"

Interesting.
