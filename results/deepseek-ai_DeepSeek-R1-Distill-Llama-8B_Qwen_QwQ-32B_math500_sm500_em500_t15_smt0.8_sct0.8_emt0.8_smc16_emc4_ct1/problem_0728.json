            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here with logarithms, and I need to find the value of x. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says: If log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then find x. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe if I take it one part at a time, it will make more sense.\n\nLet me start with the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can multiply their arguments. So, using the logarithm addition rule, log_b(A) + log_b(B) = log_b(AB). Applying that here, this equation should become log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nMultiplying (x - y) and (x + y) gives me a difference of squares, which is x² - y². So now the equation simplifies to log₆(x² - y²) = 2. \n\nNow, how do I get from the logarithmic equation to solving for x or y? Well, I know that if log_b(C) = D, then C = b^D. So applying that here, log₆(x² - y²) = 2 implies that x² - y² = 6², which is 36. So that's our first equation: x² - y² = 36. Let me write that down as equation (1).\n\nMoving on to the second part of the problem: log_y(5x) = 2. I need to figure out what this tells me about y and x. Again, using the definition of logarithms, if log_y(A) = B, then A = y^B. So here, 5x = y² because B is 2. So 5x = y², which means x = y² / 5. Let me call this equation (2): x = y² / 5.\n\nNow, I have two equations: equation (1) is x² - y² = 36 and equation (2) is x = y² / 5. It looks like I can substitute equation (2"

            "output": ") into equation (1) to solve for y first, and then find x.\n\nSubstituting x in equation (1) with y² / 5, let's do that step by step:\n\nx² = (y² / 5)² = y⁴ / 25\ny² is just y²\n\nSo, equation (1) becomes:\n(y⁴ / 25) - y² = 36\n\nHmm, that's a quartic equation, but maybe I can simplify it by multiplying both sides by 25 to eliminate the denominator. Let's try that:\n\n25*(y⁴ / 25) - 25*y² = 36*25\nWhich simplifies to:\ny⁴ - 25y² = 900\n\nHmm, that's a quartic equation, but I notice that it's a quadratic in terms of y². So maybe I can let z = y² and rewrite the equation as:\n\nz² - 25z - 900 = 0\n\nThat's a quadratic equation in z. Let's try to solve for z using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is z² -25z -900 = 0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is z = [25 ± sqrt(25² + 4*900)] / 2 because the equation is of the form az² + bz + c = 0, so a=1, b=-25, c=-900.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, the discriminant is b² - 4ac. Here, a=1, b=-25, c=-900.\n\nSo discriminant = (-25)² - 4*1*(-900) = 625 + 3600 = 4225\n\nsqrt(4225) is 65 because 65² is 4225.\n\nSo, z = [25 ± 65]/2\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n\nz = (25 + 65)/2 = 90/2 = 45\n\nz = (25 - 65)/2 = (-40)/2 = -20\n\nBut z = y², and y² can't be negative because any real number squared is non-negative. So z = -20 is not possible. Therefore, z = 45.\n\nSince z = y², then y² = 45. So y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But sqrt(45) is 3*"

Since y² is 45, x = 45 / 5 = 9.\n\nWait, so x is 9 regardless of whether y is positive or negative because y² is always positive. So the value of x is 9.\n\nLet me just check if this makes sense.\n\nGiven x = 9, then from equation (2), y² = 5x = 5*9 = 45, so y = ±3√5.\n\nNow, plugging into equation (1), x² - y² = 81 - 45 = 36, which matches the first equation.
