            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. \n\nThe problem is: If log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then I need to find x. Hmm, okay. That seems a bit tricky, but let's take it apart.\n\nFirst, I remember that logarithms have some properties, especially when they're added together. I think that if you have log_b A + log_b B, that can be combined into log_b (A*B). So maybe I can use that here.\n\nLooking at the first equation: log6(x - y) + log6(x + y) = 2. Applying the product rule, that should be log6[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. Now, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, which simplifies to x² - y². So the equation becomes log6(x² - y²) = 2.\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that log_b C = D means b^D = C. So if log6(x² - y²) = 2, then 6² = x² - y². That simplifies to 36 = x² - y². Okay, so equation one is x² - y² = 36.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Again, I can convert this logarithmic equation to exponential form. That means y² = 5x. So equation two is 5x = y², or rearranged, y² = 5x.\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1. x² - y² = 36\n2. y² = 5x\n\nHmm, since equation two gives me y² in terms of x, I can substitute that into equation one. Let me do that.\n\nSubstituting y² = 5x into equation one: x² - (5x) = 36. So that simplifies to x² - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation in terms of x: x² - 5x - "

            "output": "36 = 0. I need to solve for x. Let me try factoring. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Let me think... Hmm, the factors of 36 are 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nLooking for a pair that adds to -5. Let's see, if I take 4 and -9: 4 * (-9) = -36, and 4 + (-9) = -5. Perfect! So the equation factors as (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\nx + 4 = 0 => x = -4\nx - 9 = 0 => x = 9\n\nSo, the possible solutions are x = -4 and x = 9. But I need to check if these are valid solutions because sometimes when dealing with logarithms, you can get extraneous solutions.\n\nFirst, let's check x = -4. From equation two, y² = 5x. If x is -4, then y² = 5*(-4) = -20. But y squared can't be negative, since any real number squared is non-negative. So y² = -20 is impossible, meaning x = -4 is not a valid solution.\n\nNext, check x = 9. Then y² = 5*9 = 45. So y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But let's see if the first equation holds.\n\nFrom equation one: x² - y² = 36. If x=9, then x² = 81. So 81 - y² = 36, which gives y² = 81 - 36 = 45. Which matches what we found earlier, so that's good.\n\nAlso, we need to check the original logarithmic expressions to make sure the arguments are positive. For log6(x - y) and log6(x + y) to be defined, (x - y) > 0 and (x + y) > 0.\n\nSince x = 9 and y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45), let's consider each case.\n\nFirst, y = sqrt(45) ≈ 6.708. So x - y"

So that's fine.\n\nNow, if y = -sqrt(45) ≈ -6.708, then x - y = 9 - (-6.708) ≈ 15.708, still positive. x + y = 9 + (-6.708) ≈ 2.292, which is positive as well. So both possibilities for y work.\n\nSo x = 9 is a valid solution. Therefore, the value of x is 9.\n\nLet me recap my steps to ensure I didn't miss anything. I used logarithm properties to combine the two log terms in the first equation, converted them to exponential form, substituted y² from the second equation into the resulting quadratic, solved the quadratic, checked for extraneous solutions by plugging back into the original logarithmic expressions, and verified the domains. Everything seems to check out, so I'm confident that x = 9 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given equations, we start by applying logarithmic properties and then substituting to form a quadratic equation.\n\n1. From the first equation, combine the logarithms:\n   \\[\n   \\log_6((x - y)(x + y)) = 2 \\implies x² - y² = 36\n   \\]\n2. From the second equation, convert the logarithm to exponential form:\n   \\[\n   \\log_y(5x) = 2 \\implies y² = 5x\n   \\]\n3. Substitute \\( y² = 5x \\) into \\( x² - y² = 36 \\):\n   \\[\n   x² - 5x = 36 \\implies x² - 5x - 36 = 0\n   \\]\n4. Factor the quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0 \\implies x = -4 \\text{ or } x = 9\n   \\]\n5. Check for valid solutions:\n   - \\( x = -4 \\) leads to \\( y² = -20 \\), which is invalid.\n   - \\( x = 9 \\) leads to \\( y² = 45 \\), which is valid.\n\nThus, the value of \\( x \\"
