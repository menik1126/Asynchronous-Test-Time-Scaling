            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the product of these integers is fixed at 84, so I need to break down 84 into its prime factors to see which numbers to use. Let me start by factoring 84.\n\n84 can be divided by 2, so 84 = 2 × 42. Then, 42 can be divided by 2 again, giving 42 = 2 × 21. Next, 21 is 3 × 7. So putting it all together, the prime factors of 84 are 2² × 3 × 7. \n\nAlright, so now I have 2², 3, and 7. But I need to represent 84 as a product of distinct positive integers. Since they have to be distinct, I can't just use 1s or repeat any numbers.\n\nI remember that when trying to minimize the sum of numbers with a fixed product, it's better to use smaller numbers, including 1s, but since the integers have to be distinct, I can only use each number once. So, I should try to split the factors into the smallest possible distinct integers.\n\nLet me list the factors of 84: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84. Now, since 1 is a multiplicative identity, including 1 could help reduce the sum, but I need to balance it with other numbers.\n\nIf I start by including 1, then I need the product of the rest of the numbers to be 84. Let me see: 1 × a × b × c = 84, so a × b × c = 84. But since I'm looking for the least sum, maybe using 1 isn't the best because it adds 1 to the sum, but allows me to use smaller numbers elsewhere. Let me try that.\n\nSo, using 1, I need three other distinct positive integers whose product is 84. Let me find such triplets. Let's see, starting with the smallest possible numbers:\n\n1, 2, and... Well, 1×2×42=84. Sum would be 1+2+42=45"

That's better. Wait, but can I get even smaller?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using more numbers. Let's see, if I use four numbers instead of three. Let's try 1, 2, 3, and 14. Their product is 1×2×3×14=84. The sum is 1+2+3+14=20. Same as before. Hmm, same total. \n\nWait, maybe another combination. Let's see, 1, 2, 6, 7. Product is 1×2×6×7=84. Sum is 1+2+6+7=16. Oh, that's better! Wait, that's a better sum. Let me check that again. 1×2×6×7 is indeed 84. The numbers are all distinct. So the sum is 16. That's better than 20. \n\nIs there a way to get even lower? Let's see. Let's try with more numbers. Let's see, maybe 1, 2, 3, and then 14, but that's the same as before. Alternatively, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7? Let's check the product: 1×2×3×4×7 = 168, which is double of 84. So that's too much. Hmm, maybe 1, 2, 3, 7, and 2? But 2 is repeated, so that's not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 1, 3, 4, 7. Let's see: 1×3×4×7 = 84. The sum is 1+3+4+7=15. Wait, that's even better! Is that right?"

Let me see: 1, 2, 3, 4, and... Hmm, if I take 1×2×3×4×... what? Let's compute the product so far: 1×2=2, ×3=6, ×4=24. So to get 84, we need 84/24 = 3.5. But 3.5 is not an integer, so that doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Let's compute the product: 1×2=2, ×3=6, ×6=36, ×7=252. That's way too much. So that's not 84.

So that's not good.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach. Let me factor 84 as 2×2×3×7. So I have four prime factors, but with 2 repeated. To make them distinct, I can combine the two 2s into 4. So, I can use 4, 3, 7, and then include 1. So, 1,3,4,7 as before. That gives a product of 84 and a sum of 15. \n\nIs there a way to get a lower sum? Let me think. Maybe if I don't include 1, but use more numbers. Wait, but I think including 1 can help because it allows other numbers to be smaller. Let's try without 1. Let's see: What sets of distinct integers greater than 1 multiply to 84?\n\nFor example, 2×3×14=84, sum 2+3+14=19. That's worse than "
