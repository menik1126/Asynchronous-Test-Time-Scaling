Next, I'll factor 21 into 3 and 7. Therefore, the prime factorization of 84 is \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\).\n\nNow, I need to combine these prime factors into distinct positive integers such that their product remains 84. I'll begin by listing all possible sets of distinct integers:\n\n1. **Set 1:** 2, 2, 3, 7. However, the number 2 appears twice, so this set is invalid.\n2. **Set 2:** 2, 3, 7, and 2. Again, 2 is repeated, making this set invalid.\n\nNext, I'll explore sets with fewer numbers:\n\n3. **Set 3:** 2, 3, 14. The product is \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 14 = 84\\), and all numbers are distinct. The sum is \\(2 + 3 + 14 = 19\\).\n4. **Set 4:** 3, 4, 7. The product is \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 7 = 84\\), and all numbers are distinct. The sum is \\(3 + 4 + 7 = 14\\).\n\nAmong these sets, the combination of 3, 4, and 7 provides the smallest sum of 14.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 84\nFirst, factorize 84 into its prime components:\n\\[\n84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\nThis can be written as:\n\\[\n84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Generate Sets of Distinct Integers\nWe need to combine these prime factors into distinct positive integers such that their product is 84. Let's explore possible sets:\n\n1. **Set A:** \\(2, 2, 3, 7\\)\n   - Product: \\(2 \\times 2 \\times"
