Since 15 students don't take any, the number of students taking at least one subject is 360 - 15 = 345.\n\nGiven that 15 students are taking all three subjects, I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of students taking two or more subjects.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\nTotal in at least one subject = C + P + Ch - (CP + CCh + PhCh) + CPCh\n\nPlugging in the known numbers:\n\n345 = 180 + P + Ch - (30 + 75 + 75) + 15\n\nSimplifying this equation will help solve for P, the number of students taking physics.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students in the school: 360\n- Students not taking any of Calculus (C), Physics (Ph), or Chemistry (Ch): 15\n- Students taking all three subjects (C, Ph, Ch): 15\n- Students taking Calculus (C): 180\n- Relationship between students taking Chemistry and Physics: \\( \\text{Ch} = 2 \\times \\text{Ph} \\)\n- Students taking both Calculus and Chemistry (C ∩ Ch): 75\n- Students taking both Physics and Chemistry (Ph ∩ Ch): 75\n- Students taking both Calculus and Physics (C ∩ Ph): 30\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Number of Students Taking At Least One Subject**\n\nSince 15 students don't take any of the three subjects:\n\\[\n\\text{Students taking at least one subject} = 360 - 15 = 345\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:"
