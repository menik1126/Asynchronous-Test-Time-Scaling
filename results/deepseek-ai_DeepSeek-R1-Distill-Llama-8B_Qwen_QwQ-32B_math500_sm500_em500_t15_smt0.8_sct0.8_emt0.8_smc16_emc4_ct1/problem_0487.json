            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of the original cube before any metal is removed. The cube has a side length of \\( s \\) inches, so the volume is \\( s^3 \\) cubic inches.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the metal removed from the corners. Each corner of a cube is a right-angled tetrahedron. The radius of the sphere is 3 inches, so the edge length \\( a \\) of the tetrahedron is related by \\( a = \\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2} = 3\\sqrt{3} \\) inches.\n\nThe volume of one tetrahedron is \\( \\frac{a^3}{6} \\). Since a cube has 8 corners, the total volume removed is \\( 8 \\times \\frac{a^3}{6} = \\frac{4a^3}{3} \\).\n\nFinally, the volume of the steel sphere is the original cube's volume minus the removed volume: \\( s^3 - \\frac{4a^3}{3} \\). Setting this equal to \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\) and solving for \\( s \\) will give the shortest possible side length.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA steel sphere with a 3-inch radius is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube with the shortest possible side lengths. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the cube?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Shape and Dimensions:**\n   - **Original Shape:** A cube with side length \\( s \\) inches.\n   - **Final Shape:** A cube with metal removed from all 8 corners, resulting in a steel sphere.\n   - **Sphere Radius:** 3 inches.\n\n2. **Relate Sphere Radius to Cube Dimensions:**\n   - When metal is removed from each corner of the cube to form a sphere, each corner is effectively cut off to form a right-angled tetrahedron.\n   - The radius of the sphere is related to the cube's side length by the edge length \\( a \\) of the tetrahedron:\n     \\[\n     a = \\sqrt{r^2 + r^2 + r^2} = r\\sqrt{3}\n     \\]\n     Given \\( r = 3 \\) inches"
