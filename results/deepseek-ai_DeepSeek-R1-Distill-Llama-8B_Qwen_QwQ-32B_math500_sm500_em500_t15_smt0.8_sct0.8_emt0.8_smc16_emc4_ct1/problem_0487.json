            "output": "First, I need to understand the problem. We have a cube with the shortest possible side length, and from this cube, metal is removed from its corners to form a steel sphere with a 3-inch radius.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the steel sphere using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, where r is the radius. Plugging in the given radius of 3 inches, the volume of the sphere becomes (4/3)\u03c0(3)\u00b3 = 36\u03c0 cubic inches.\n\nSince the sphere is formed by removing metal from the cube, the volume of the cube must be equal to the volume of the sphere plus the volume of the removed material. However, the problem doesn't provide information about the volume of the removed material, so I assume it's negligible or doesn't affect the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the cube is equal to the volume of the sphere, which is 36\u03c0 cubic inches.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of the original cube, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Shape Transformation:**\n   - We start with a cube.\n   - A steel sphere is formed by removing material from the cube's corners.\n   \n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Sphere:**\n   - **Formula for Volume of a Sphere:**  \n     \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\)\n   - **Given:** Radius \\( r = 3 \\) inches.\n   - **Calculation:**  \n     \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = 36\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n   \n3. **Relate Cube Volume to Sphere Volume:**\n   - The volume of the cube is **equal** to the volume of the sphere because only material is removed, not added.\n   \n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - \\( V_{\\text{cube}} = V_{\\text{sphere}} = 36\\pi \\) cubic inches.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36\\pi}\n\\]"
