            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). Then, I have to express this distance in the form \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Finally, I need to find \\( a + b \\).\n\nHmm, okay, let me start by recalling that the distance between two points \\( (x, y) \\) and the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) can be found using the distance formula. So, the distance \\( D \\) would be \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n\nSince the point \\( (x, y) \\) lies on the graph of the given function, \\( y \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( x \\). Substituting the given equation into the distance formula should give me a function in terms of \\( x \\) only, which I can then minimize to find the smallest distance.\n\nSo, let me write out the distance squared to make it easier. Minimizing the square of the distance will also give me the minimum distance since the square root is a monotonic function.\n\nTherefore, the distance squared \\( D^2 \\) is:\n\\[\nx^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the \\( y \\) term:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)(x^2 - 3)^2\n\\]\nSo, the distance squared becomes:\n\\[\nD^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2\n\\]\n\nLet me expand \\( (x^2 - 3)^2 \\):\n\\[\n(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9\n\\]\nSo, substituting that back in:\n\\[\nD^2 = x"

I can do this by taking the derivative of \\( D^2 \\) with respect to \\( x \\), setting it equal to zero, and solving for \\( x \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( f(x) = \\frac{x^4}{2} - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\). Then,\n\\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left( \\frac{x^4}{2} - 2x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\right)\n\\]\nCalculating term by term:\n- The derivative of \\( \\frac{x^4}{2} \\) is \\( \\frac{4x^3}{2} = 2x^3 \\)\n- The derivative of \\( -2x^2 \\) is \\( -4x \\)\n- The derivative of the constant \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) is 0\n\nSo, \\( f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \\)\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\\[\n2x^3 - 4x = 0\n\\]\nFactor out \\( 2x \\):\n\\[\n2x(x^2 - 2) = 0\n\\]\nSo, the solutions are:\n1. \\( 2x = 0 \\) => \\( x = 0 \\)\n2. \\( x^2 - 2 ="

Let me double-check that calculation because sometimes when I take derivatives or expand terms, I might make an error.\n\nWait, \\( f(\\sqrt{2}) \\) computation again:\n- \\( \\frac{(\\sqrt{2})^4}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 \\)\n- \\( -2 (\\sqrt{2})^2 = -2 * 2 = -4 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\)\nAdding them together: 2 - 4 + 4.5 = 2.5, which is \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\).
