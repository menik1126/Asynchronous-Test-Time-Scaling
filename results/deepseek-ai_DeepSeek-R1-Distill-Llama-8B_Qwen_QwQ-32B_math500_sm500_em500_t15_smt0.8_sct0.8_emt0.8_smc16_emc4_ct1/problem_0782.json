The answer should be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, with \\( a \\) square-free, and then find \\( a + b \\). Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst off, the distance between two points in a plane is given by the distance formula. If I have a point \\( (x, y) \\) on the graph, the distance \\( D \\) from the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) to this point would be:\n\n\\[\nD = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\nSo, my goal is to minimize this distance \\( D \\). Since the square root function is a monotonic function, minimizing \\( D \\) is equivalent to minimizing \\( D^2 \\). That might make the calculations a bit easier because I can work with \\( D^2 \\) instead of \\( D \\).\n\nGiven the equation of the graph, I can substitute \\( y \\) with \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). So, let me write that out:\n\n\\[\nD^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated, but I think I can expand and simplify it.\n\nFirst, let me square the \\( y \\) term:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\cdot (x^2 - 3)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging that back into the expression for \\( D^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nD^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 -"
