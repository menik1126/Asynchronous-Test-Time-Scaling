I'll look for combinations that multiply to 84 without repeating any number.\n\nLet me consider different groupings:\n\n1. 1 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 6 = 84, but this uses more numbers, which likely increases the sum.\n\n2. 1 × 2 × 4 × 3 × 7 = 84, but this also includes more numbers than necessary.\n\n3. A better approach is to use smaller numbers as much as possible to minimize the sum. So, I'll try using 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nMultiplying 1 × 2 × 3 × 6 = 36, which is less than 84. To reach the product of 84, I need to include 7.\n\nThus, the complete set is 1 × 2 × 3 × 6 × 7 = 84. Calculating the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7 = 19.\n\nI should check if there's a more optimal combination. If I replace 6 with 4, the product becomes 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 7 = 168, which is more than 84. That doesn't work.\n\nAnother option is to try using smaller numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7, but their product is 168, which exceeds 84. Therefore, the initial set of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 seems to be the optimal choice with the least sum of 19.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84**:  \n   \\( 84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\)\n\n2. **Identify Possible Sets**:  \n   We need to combine these prime factors into distinct integers.  \n   - **Option 1:** \\( 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 \\)  \n     \\( "
