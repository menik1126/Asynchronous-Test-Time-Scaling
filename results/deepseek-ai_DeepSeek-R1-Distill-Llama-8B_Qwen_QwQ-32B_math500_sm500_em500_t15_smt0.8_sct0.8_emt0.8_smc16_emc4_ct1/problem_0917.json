            "output": "To find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime components.\n\nFirst, 84 is divisible by 2, so dividing by 2 gives 42. Next, 42 can be divided by 2 again to get 21. Then, 21 is divisible by 3, resulting in 7. Finally, 7 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 84 is 2² × 3 × 7.\n\nWith the prime factors identified, I'll consider different groupings of these prime factors to form distinct positive integers. To minimize the sum, the integers should be as close to each other as possible.\n\nOne possible grouping is 2 × 3 × 7 = 42. But since the product is 84, I need to include another factor. Dividing 84 by 42 gives me 2, so the integers are 2 and 42. Adding these together results in a sum of 44.\n\nAnother grouping could be 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 84. Here, the integers are 2, 2, 3, and 7. However, the integers must be distinct, so I can't include two 2s. Instead, I can combine the two 2s to form 4, resulting in the integers 4 and 21. Their sum is 4 + 21 = 25, which is less than 44.\n\nTo ensure this is the minimal sum, I'll check if there are smaller integers possible. If I try to use 1 as one of the integers, the product would remain 84. However, including 1 doesn't reduce the sum because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product but adds to the sum. Therefore, excluding 1 and using 2 and 21 gives the minimal sum of 23.\n\nAfter evaluating different groupings and ensuring all integers are distinct, the least possible sum of these integers is 23.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:\n   - Start by factoring 84 into its prime components.\n   - \\(84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\\)\n\n2. **Grouping the Factors**:\n   - We need to group these prime factors into distinct integers"

However, this includes duplicates (two 2s), which are not allowed.\n   - **Option 2**: Combine the two 2s into a single factor: \\(4, 3, 7\\). This gives distinct integers with product \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 84\\). The sum is \\(4 + 3 + 7 = 14\\).\n   - **Option 3**: Further split the factors to check for smaller sums:\n     - \\(2, 3, 14\\) (product \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 14 = 84\\), sum \\(2 + 3 + 14 = 19\\)).\n     - \\(2, 6, 7\\) (product \\(2 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 84\\), sum \\(2 + 6 + 7 = 15\\)).\n     - \\(1, 2, 3, 14\\) (includes 1, which doesn't help reduce the sum further).\n\n4. **Optimal Grouping**:\n   - The grouping \\(2, 3, 14\\) gives a sum of 19, but \\(2, 6, 7\\) gives a smaller sum of 15. However, the smallest sum comes from the grouping \\(3, 4, 7\\), which sums to \\(3 + 4 + 7 = 14\\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure all integers are distinct and their product is 84. The grouping \\(3, 4, 7\\) satisfies both conditions.\n\nThus, the least possible sum of these integers is \\(\\boxed{14}\\)."
