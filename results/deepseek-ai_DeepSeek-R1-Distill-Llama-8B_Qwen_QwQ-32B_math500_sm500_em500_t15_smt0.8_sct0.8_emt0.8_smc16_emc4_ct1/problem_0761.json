The sequence is defined as \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots \\), and it has some specific properties related to geometric and arithmetic subsequences. The goal is to find \\( a_1 \\) given that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\).\n\nLet me try to break down the problem step by step. The problem says that for every positive integer \\( k \\), the subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric, and the subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is arithmetic. Hmm, okay. So, for each \\( k \\), these two subsequences have specific properties.\n\nFirst, let me recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are. A geometric sequence has each term after the first being a multiple of the previous term by a common ratio \\( r \\). So, for the geometric subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\), that means \\( a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \\times r \\) and \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} \\times r = a_{2k-1} \\times r^2 \\).\n\nOn the other hand, an arithmetic sequence has each term after the first being the previous term plus a common difference \\( d \\). So, for the arithmetic subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\), that means \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d \\) and \\( a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d = a_{2k} + 2d \\).\n\nSo, for each \\( k \\), these two conditions hold. Since the entire sequence is strictly increasing, all the terms are positive integers, and each term is larger than the previous one.\n\nGiven that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\), and we need to find \\( a_1 \\). Let's note that 13 is an odd index, specifically \\( 2k - 1 \\) when \\( k = 7 \\), because \\( 2*"

That means the 13th term is the end of a geometric subsequence starting at \\( a_{11} \\) (since \\( 2k - 1 = 13 \\) implies \\( k=7 \\), so the geometric subsequence is \\( a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15} \\) is that right? Wait, no. Wait, for \\( k=7 \\), the geometric subsequence is \\( a_{2*7 - 1}, a_{2*7}, a_{2*7 + 1} \\) which is \\( a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15} \\). So, \\( a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15} \\) is a geometric sequence.\n\nSimilarly, the arithmetic subsequence for \\( k=7 \\) is \\( a_{14}, a_{15}, a_{16} \\), so that's an arithmetic sequence.\n\nBut our problem is that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\). So, the 13th term is 2016, which is part of a geometric sequence \\( a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15} \\).\n\nI think I need to figure out the structure of these sequences step by step, perhaps starting from \\( a_1 \\) and building up until \\( a_{13} \\). Since the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms must be positive integers, so each ratio in the geometric sequences must be a positive rational number, but given the integer constraints, maybe the ratios are integers?\n\nWait, but it's not necessarily required for the ratio to be an integer, but the terms must be integers, so the ratio must be a rational number such that each term is an integer multiple of the previous one. Hmm. But since the sequence is strictly increasing, the ratios must be greater than 1.\n\nWait, but for geometric sequences, the ratio is constant, right? So, if \\( a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \\times r \\), and \\( a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} \\times r \\), so both \\( a_{2k} \\) and \\( a_{2k+1} \\) must be integer multiples of \\( a_{2k-1} \\).
