It's strictly increasing, so each term is bigger than the one before it. That's good to know because it tells me the differences between consecutive terms are positive.\n\nNow, the sequence has a particular property. For every positive integer k, two things are true:\n\n1. The subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric.\n2. The subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic.\n\nAdditionally, I'm told that a_{13} is 2016, and I need to find a1.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\nA geometric sequence has each term after the first being multiplied by a common ratio. So, if I have three terms in a geometric sequence, say b, c, d, then c/b = d/c, which implies c² = b*d.\n\nAn arithmetic sequence has each term after the first being added by a common difference. So, three terms x, y, z in an arithmetic sequence mean y - x = z - y, which simplifies to 2y = x + z.\n\nApplying this to the problem.\n\nFor each k, the first property gives me that a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, and a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic sequence. So, for each k, we have:\n\n2*a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}\n\nSimilarly, the second property says that a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} form a geometric sequence. So, for each k, we have:\n\na_{2k}² = a_{2k-1} * a_{2k+1}\n\nI need to see if I can find a pattern or a relationship between the terms.\n\nSince the sequence is strictly increasing, all terms are positive integers, so the common differences and ratios will also be positive integers.\n\nGiven that a_{13} = 2016, which is term number 13, and I need to find a1.
