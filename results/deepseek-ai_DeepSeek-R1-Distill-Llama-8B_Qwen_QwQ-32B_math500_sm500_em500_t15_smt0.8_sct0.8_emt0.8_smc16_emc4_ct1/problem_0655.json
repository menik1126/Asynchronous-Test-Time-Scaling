            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a quadratic polynomial P(x). The problem says that P(x) satisfies the inequality x² - 2x + 2 ≤ P(x) ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3 for all real numbers x. Also, they tell me that P(11) = 181, and I need to find P(16). Hmm, okay, let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, it must have the form P(x) = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. My goal is to find the coefficients a, b, and c, using the given conditions.\n\nThe problem gives me two inequalities: P(x) is bounded below by x² - 2x + 2 and bounded above by 2x² - 4x + 3. That means for every x, P(x) is between these two quadratics. So, I can write:\n\nx² - 2x + 2 ≤ ax² + bx + c ≤ 2x² - 4x + 3\n\nThis must hold true for all real x. Therefore, if I subtract the lower bound from P(x), I should get a non-negative quadratic, right? Similarly, subtracting P(x) from the upper bound should also give a non-negative quadratic. But wait, actually, since the inequalities must hold for all x, those differences must be non-negative for all x, meaning the resulting quadratics must be always non-negative.\n\nSo, let's define two new functions:\n\n1. Q1(x) = P(x) - (x² - 2x + 2) = ax² + bx + c - x² + 2x - 2 = (a - 1)x² + (b + 2)x + (c - 2)\n\n2. Q2(x) = (2x² - 4x + 3) - P(x) = 2x² - 4x + 3 - ax² - bx - c = (2 - a)x² + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c)\n\nSince Q1(x) ≥ 0 and Q2(x) ≥ 0 for all real x, both Q1 and Q2 must be non-negative quadratics. For a quadratic to be non-negative for all"

Leading coefficient: 2 - a > 0 ⇒ a < 2\n\n2. Discriminant: [(-4 - b)]² - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0\n\nSo, from Q1 and Q2, we have that a must satisfy 1 < a < 2.\n\nThat's a useful piece of information. Now, let's write down the discriminant conditions.\n\nFor Q1:\n\nDiscriminant D1 = (b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) ≤ 0\n\nFor Q2:\n\nDiscriminant D2 = (-4 - b)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) ≤ 0\n\nSo, we have four inequalities:\n\n1. a > 1\n\n2. a < 2\n\n3.

But actually, since P(x) is between them, both Q1 and Q2 must be non-negative, which we already considered.\n\nSo, maybe the only way for P(x) to lie strictly between two quadratics for all x is if P(x) coincides with the upper bound or the lower bound at some points.\n\nBut wait, unless the quadratics are tangent to each other, but that might not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, if P(x) is equal to the average of the two quadratics, but again, not necessarily.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that both Q1 and Q2 are perfect squares, i.e., they have discriminant zero, because if Q1 or Q2 are always non-negative, but not necessarily positive everywhere, perhaps only touching at one point.\n\nBut that's an assumption. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe P(x) is the same as the upper bound or the lower bound, but then P(11) would be either 2*(11)^2 -4*11 +3 or 11² -2*11 +2, let's compute those.\n\nCompute upper bound at x=11:\n\n2*(121) -44 +3 = 242 -44 +3 = 201\n\nLower bound at x=11:\n\n121 -22 +2 = 101\n\nBut P(11)=181, which is between 101 and 201, so P(x) is not equal to either bound.\n\nSo, that tells me that P(x) is a quadratic strictly between the two given quadratics for all x.\n\nTherefore, both Q1(x) and Q2(x) must be non-negative for all x, which as I said earlier, implies that their leading coefficients are positive and their discriminants are non-positive.\n\nAdditionally, since P(x) is given at x"

That's interesting. The difference between the upper and lower bounds is (x -1)^2, which is always non-negative, as expected. So, the upper bound is always above the lower bound, and the difference is exactly (x -1)^2. Therefore, the gap between them is smallest at x=1, where it's zero. Wait, but (x -1)^2 is zero at x=1, so that means at x=1, the upper and lower bounds are equal?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nAt x=1, L(1) = 1 -2 +2 =1\n\nU(1)= 2 -4 +3=1. Yes, exactly. So, the two quadratics touch at x=1. So, the minimum gap between them is zero at x=1, and they are equal there. So, that's a point where both inequalities become equalities.\n\nTherefore, since P(x) is sandwiched between them for all x, then at x=1, P(1) must equal both L(1) and U(1), so P(1)=1.\n\nTherefore, P(1)=1. That's an important point. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, P(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c =1.\n\nSo, that's another equation: a + b + c =1.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. 121a +11b +c =181 (from P(11)=181)\n\n2. a + b + c =1 (from P(1)=1)\n\n3. ?\n\nWait, but we need more equations.

Because at points of contact, the quadratic P(x) will touch either the upper bound or the lower bound, so the discriminant of Q1 or Q2 will be zero.\n\nTherefore, perhaps P(x) is tangent to either the upper or lower bound at some points. Since P(x) is between them everywhere else, perhaps only at x=1, where they touch, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's tangent to one at x=1 and the other at some other point.\n\nBut wait, at x=1, P(x)=1, which is the same as both bounds, so perhaps that is a point of contact.\n\nHmm, perhaps this suggests that P(x) is equal to the lower bound at x=1 and to the upper bound at some other point, or vice versa. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nSince both Q1 and Q2 must be non-negative for all x, their discriminants must be ≤0. So, maybe P(x) is such that both Q1(x) and Q2(x) are perfect squares, i.e., their discriminants are zero, meaning that P(x) is the exact lower or upper bound at exactly one point each. But perhaps that's an overcomplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is (x−1)^2, so U(x) = L(x) + (x−1)^2.\n\nSince P(x) is in between them, perhaps P(x) can be written as L(x) + k(x)*(x−1)^2, where k(x) is between 0 and 1 for all x. Because if k(x) is 0, P(x) is L(x); if k(x) is 1, P(x) is U(x).\n\nBut since P(x) is a quadratic, let's see what happens. Let me try this.\n\nLet me suppose that P(x) = L(x) + k(x)*(x−1)^2.\n\nSince L(x) is a quadratic, and (x−1)^2 is a quadratic, then P(x) would be a quadratic as long as k(x) is a constant.
