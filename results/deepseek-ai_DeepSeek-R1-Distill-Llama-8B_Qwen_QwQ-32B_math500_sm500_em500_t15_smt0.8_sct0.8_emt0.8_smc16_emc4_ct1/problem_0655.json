The problem says that for all real numbers x, P(x) is sandwiched between two other quadratic expressions: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3. Also, they tell me that P(11) = 181, and I need to find P(16). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, I can write it in the general form: P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real coefficients that I need to determine. The problem gives me inequalities that P(x) must satisfy for all real x, so I can use these inequalities to set up some constraints on a, b, and c.\n\nThe inequalities given are:\n1. x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 for all real x.\n\nSo, to satisfy these inequalities, the quadratic P(x) must lie between these two quadratics everywhere on the real line. That makes me think that P(x) must be exactly the average of the two given quadratics, because that's the only way a quadratic can lie between two other quadratics (assuming the two are not identical). Wait, but is that always the case? Let me think.\n\nIf we have two quadratics, say Q1(x) and Q2(x), then a quadratic P(x) that lies between them for all x must satisfy Q1(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 Q2(x) and P(x) can't be outside this range. However, for quadratics, it's possible that P(x) is exactly the average of Q1 and Q2 if they are symmetric in some way. So, maybe P(x) is the average of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's compute the average of the two quadratics:\n\nAverage = [ (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) + (2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3) ] / 2\n= (3x\u00b2 - 6x + 5) / 2\nSo, P(x) would be (3x\u00b2 - 6"

Let me check if this works.\n\nFirst, check if this P(x) satisfies the inequalities:\n\nCompare with lower bound: \nP(x) - Q1(x) = [ (3x\u00b2 - 6x + 5)/2 ] - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2)\n= (3x\u00b2 -6x +5 - 2x\u00b2 +4x -4)/2\n= (x\u00b2 -2x +1)/2\nWhich simplifies to (x\u00b2 -2x +1)/2 = (x-1)\u00b2 / 2. Since squares are non-negative, this is always \u22650. So P(x) \u2265 Q1(x).\n\nSimilarly, upper bound:\nQ2(x) - P(x) = (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - [ (3x\u00b2 -6x +5)/2 ]\n= (4x\u00b2 -8x +6 -3x\u00b2 +6x -5)/2\n= (x\u00b2 -2x +1)/2 = (x -1)^2 /2 \u22650.\nSo that works too. So P(x) is exactly the average of the two quadratics. But wait, the problem states that P(x) is a quadratic polynomial satisfying those inequalities, so this is a possible candidate. But maybe the problem allows for other quadratics that lie between them?\n\nHmm. Let me think again. If there are quadratics between Q1 and Q2, they must satisfy Q1(x) \u2264 P(x) \u2264 Q2(x) for all x. Since Q1 and Q2 are two quadratics, perhaps opening upwards (since their leading coefficients are positive), the region between them is between two parabolas. For a quadratic to lie entirely between them, it must be between them at all points. Since both inequalities must hold, perhaps the difference between P(x) and Q1 is a non-negative quadratic, and the difference between Q2 and P(x) is also non-negative.\n\nLet me write down the inequalities as:\nP(x) - (x\u00b2 -2x +2) \u2265 0 for all x,\nand (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - P(x) \u22650 for all x.\n\nSo, both of these expressions must be non-negative for all real x. So, these differences must be non-negative definite quadratics.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet D1"

D1 discriminant D1 = [ (b+2) ]\u00b2 -4*(a-1)*(c -2) \u22640\n\nSimilarly for D2:\n1. 2 -a \u22650 \u21d2 a \u22642\n2.

But the problem says \"quadratic polynomial with real coefficients satisfying the inequalities for all real numbers x\". So that average is one such polynomial, but maybe there are others?\n\nWait, but the problem also gives an additional condition: P(11) = 181. Let me check what the average quadratic gives at x=11.\n\nCompute P(11) for the average quadratic:\n\n(3*(11)^2 -6*(11) +5)/2 = (3*121 -66 +5)/2 = (363 -66 +5)/2 = (302)/2 = 151. Hmm, but the problem states that P(11)=181, which is higher. So that average quadratic gives 151, but we need 181. Therefore, the average quadratic is not the one we need. So my initial thought was wrong. There must be another quadratic between the two given quadratics that also satisfies P(11)=181.\n\nHmm, so I need to think differently.

Because if they had positive discriminant, the quadratic would take negative values somewhere, which would violate the inequalities. So, maybe to have both D1 and D2 be perfect squares (i.e., discriminant zero). Then, that would give exact conditions on the coefficients.\n\nLet me assume that D1 and D2 have zero discriminant, so that P(x) touches Q1 and Q2 exactly at x=1, as in the average case. But in that case, P(11) would be 151, as I saw before, but problem requires P(11)=181.\n\nSo, if I have both D1 and D2 as perfect squares, then P(x) is fixed, but since that gives P(11)=151, which doesn't match, that suggests that either my assumption is wrong, or perhaps P(x) is not the average, even"

Hmm, but how can I find such a quadratic?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal and maximal quadratics are Q1 and Q2, so that P(x) must be between them, so the difference between P(x) and Q1 is a non-negative quadratic, and the difference between Q2 and P(x) is also a non-negative quadratic. Therefore, both D1 and D2 are non-negative quadratics. Wait, but D2 is (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - P(x), so to be non-negative, that requires that (2 -a)x\u00b2 + (-4 -b)x + (3 -c) \u22650? Wait, no, the problem says P(x) \u2264 Q2(x), so Q2(x) - P(x) \u22650, so D2 must be non-negative. Wait, but in my previous notation, D2 was (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - P(x), so that is non-negative.

Wait, that can't be right because I think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, 1.8*256: Let me compute it correctly.\n\n256*2=512,\n\n256*0.8=204.8,\n\nSo 512 +204.8=716.8.\n\nThen, 3.6*16=57.6,\n\nSo 716.8 -57.6=659.2.\n\nThen, adding 2.8 gives 659.2 +2.8=662.\n\nWait, that's not matching my previous result. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute more carefully:\n\nP(x)=1.8x\u00b2 -3.6x +2.8.\n\nAt x=16:\n\n1.8*(16)^2 =1.8*256.\n\nCompute 1.8 * 256:\n\n1.8 * 200 = 360,\n\n1.8 * 56 = 100.8,\n\nSo 360 +100.8=460.8.\n\n3.6*16=57.6,\n\nSo 460.8 -57.6=403.2.\n\nAdd 2.8: 403.2 +2.8=406.\n\nWait, that's correct. So P(16)=406.\n\nWait, let me double-check with fractions to avoid decimal errors.\n\nAlternative approach: Express P(x) as (9/5)x\u00b2 - (18/5)x +14/5.\n\nSo, at x=16:\n\n(9/5)*(16)^2 = (9/5)*256 = (9*256)/5 = 2304/"

Because I thought 1.8*256 is 716.8, but that's wrong. Wait, 1.8*256:\n\nWait, 1.8 is 9/5, so 9/5 *256 = (9*256)/5 = 2304/5 = 460.8. So that's correct. So my first calculation was correct, the second was a miscalculation.\n\nTherefore, P(16)=406.\n\nBut let me check if this P(x) indeed satisfies the original inequalities for all x.\n\nTake P(x)=1.8x\u00b2 -3.6x +2.8.\n\nCompute D1 = P(x) - (x\u00b2 -2x +2) = (1.8x\u00b2 -3.6x +2.8) - (x\u00b2 -2x +2) = 0.8x\u00b2 -1.6x +0.8 =0.8(x\u00b2 -2x +1)=0.8(x-1)^2 \u22650, which is okay.\n\nD2 = (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - P(x) = (2x\u00b2 -4x +3) - (1.8x\u00b2 -3.6x +2.8) =0.2x\u00b2 -0.4x +0.2 =0.2(x\u00b2 -2x +1)=0.2(x-1)^2 \u22650, which is also okay.\n\nSo both D1 and D2 are non-negative for all x, so the inequalities hold. And P(11)=181 as required. So this seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 406. So I should put \\boxed{406}.\n\nWait, but let me check once again if there are other possible quadratics that satisfy the conditions. Suppose there is another quadratic with different a,"
