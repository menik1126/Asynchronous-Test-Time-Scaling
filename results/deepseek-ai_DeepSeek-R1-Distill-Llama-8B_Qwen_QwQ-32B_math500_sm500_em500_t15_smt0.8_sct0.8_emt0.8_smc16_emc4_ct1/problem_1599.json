Hmm, it's a cubic equation, which can be tricky, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I notice that on the left side, there are two terms, each raised to the third power. On the right side, there's a single term raised to the third power. Maybe there's a way to simplify this or factor it somehow. Let me write it down again to get a better look:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, I wonder if I can expand both sides or maybe find a substitution that makes this easier. Let me think about the right side first. The right side is \\((2x - 10)^3\\). I can factor out a 2 from inside the parentheses to make it \\(2(x - 5)\\), so the right side becomes \\([2(x - 5)]^3\\), which is \\(8(x - 5)^3\\). Maybe that helps.\n\nSo rewriting the equation:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3\n\\]\n\nNow, looking at the left side, I have two cubic terms. I recall that for some equations, especially symmetric ones, there might be a substitution or identity that can be used. Wait, maybe I can think of this as a sum of cubes or something similar. The formula for the sum of cubes is \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\), but I'm not sure if that directly applies here. Alternatively, maybe I can set \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x -7\\) and see what happens.\n\nLet me try that. Let \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x -7\\). Then the left side becomes \\(a^3 + b^3\\), and the right side is \\(8(x -5)^3\\). Let's see if we can express \\(x -5\\) in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSince \\(a = x -3\\), then"

That's a useful relation.\n\nNow, back to the equation: \\(a^3 + b^3 = 8(x -5)^3\\). Let's express \\(x -5\\) in terms of \\(a\\). Since \\(x = a + 3\\), then \\(x -5 = a + 3 -5 = a -2\\). So, the right side becomes \\(8(a - 2)^3\\).\n\nSo the equation is now:\n\n\\[\na^3 + b^3 = 8(a - 2)^3\n\\]\n\nBut we know that \\(a = b + 4\\), so we can substitute \\(a\\) in terms of \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\n(b + 4)^3 + b^3 = 8((b + 4) - 2)^3\n\\]\nSimplify inside the parentheses on the right:\n\n\\[\n(b + 4 - 2)^3 = (b + 2)^3\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(b + 4)^3 + b^3 = 8(b + 2)^3\n\\]\n\nNow, let's expand both sides.

Maybe when I divided by something or substituted, but in this case, I don't think we divided by anything.
