Hmm, it's a cubic equation, which can be a bit tricky, but let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with equations like this, especially ones involving cubes, it might be helpful to see if there's a way to simplify or factor them. Maybe I can expand each term and then bring everything to one side to solve for x. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can make this equation easier.\n\nLooking at the right side, (2x - 10)^3, I notice that 2x - 10 can be factored as 2(x - 5). That's interesting because 2(x - 5) cubed would be 8(x - 5)^3. So, maybe if I rewrite the right side, it becomes 8(x - 5)^3. That seems useful because now both sides have similar structures—something cubed.\n\nNow, let's look at the left side: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3. I wonder if there's a relationship or identity that applies here. I recall that a^3 + b^3 can be factored as (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe applying that here could help.\n\nLet me try that. Let a = x - 3 and b = x - 7. Then, a + b would be (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10. Wait a minute, that's exactly the same as the base of the right side! So, the left side becomes (2x - 10)( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 ). \n\nSo, now the equation is:\n\n(2x - 10)[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2] = 8(x - 5)^3\n\nHmm, I can factor out (2x - 10) on the left, but on the right, we have 8(x - 5)^3. Maybe I can divide both sides by ("

Let me note that 2x - 10 = 0 when x = 5, so x = 5 is a potential solution, but I'll have to check later if it actually satisfies the original equation.\n\nSo, assuming 2x - 10 ≠ 0, I can divide both sides by (2x - 10), resulting in:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 = [8(x - 5)^3] / (2x - 10)\n\nNow, let me compute the right-hand side. The denominator, 2x - 10, can be written as 2(x - 5). So, 8(x - 5)^3 divided by 2(x - 5) simplifies to 4(x - 5)^2. Because 8 divided by 2 is 4, and (x - 5)^3 divided by (x - 5) is (x - 5)^2. So, the right-hand side becomes 4(x - 5)^2.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 = 4(x - 5)^2\n\nAlright, now I need to expand and simplify both sides. Let's start with the left side.\n\nFirst, expand (x - 3)^2:\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\n\nNext, expand (x - 7)^2:\n(x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49\n\nNow, expand (x - 3)(x - 7):\n(x - 3)(x - 7) = x^2 - 10x + 21\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nLeft side = (x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49)\n\nLet me compute this term by term:\n\nFirst term: x^2 - 6x + 9\n\nSubtracting the second term: -x^2 + 10x - 21\n\nAdding the third term:"

So, altogether, there are three roots: 3,5,7.\n\nBut let me check whether x=5 is a root. Wait, when I divided both sides by (2x -10), I assumed 2x -10 ≠0. So, x=5 is a case where the coefficient is zero, which might lead to an identity or not, depending on the equation.\n\nAs we saw, plugging in x=5 gives 0=0, so it's valid.\n\nTherefore, the roots are 3,5,7. Wait, let me make sure there are no more roots.\n\nBut the original equation is a cubic, so there should be three roots (counting multiplicities).
