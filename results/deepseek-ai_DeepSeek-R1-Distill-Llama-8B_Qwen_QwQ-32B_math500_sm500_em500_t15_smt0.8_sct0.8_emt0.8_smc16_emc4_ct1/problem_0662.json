            "output": "I need to find out how many treeks equal the weight of one squig based on the given relationships.\n\nFirst, I'll assign variables to each item: let T represent the weight of a treek, S for a squig, and G for a goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement: Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives me the equation 10T = 3S + G.\n\nFrom the second statement: Two treeks and one goolee are equal to one squig. This translates to 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I'll substitute the second equation into the first. Since S equals 2T + G, I can replace S in the first equation with 2T + G, resulting in 10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding the equation: 10T = 6T + 3G + G, which simplifies to 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides gives 4T = 4G, and dividing both sides by 4 results in T = G.\n\nThis means one treek weighs the same as one goolee.\n\nFrom the second equation, since T = G, substituting back gives 2T + T = S, so 3T = S.\n\nTherefore, one squig weighs three treeks. To find out how many treeks equal one squig, the answer is three.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute the expression for \\( S \\) from the second equation into the first equation.\n\\[\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 6T + 3G + G\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 6T + 4G\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Subtract \\( 6T \\) from both sides to isolate terms with \\( T \\) and \\( G \\).\n\\[\n10T"
