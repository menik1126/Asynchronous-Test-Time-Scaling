Let's denote the weight of one treek as T, one squig as S, and one goolee as G.\n\nNext, I'll translate the given information into equations. The first statement says that ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives me the equation 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement states that two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This translates to 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations:\n1. 10T = 3S + G\n2. 2T + G = S\n\nTo solve for T in terms of S, I'll subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n10T - (2T + G) = 3S + G - S\nThis simplifies to 8T - G = 2S.\n\nFrom equation 2, I can express G as G = S - 2T.\n\nSubstituting G back into the previous equation:\n8T - (S - 2T) = 2S\nThis simplifies to 8T - S + 2T = 2S\nCombining like terms gives 10T - S = 2S\nThen, 10T = 3S.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of ten treeks equals the weight of three squigs.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. **Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.**\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. **Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.**\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1: Express \\( G \\) from the second equation.**\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute \\( G \\) into the first equation.**\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( T \\) in terms of \\( S \\).**\n\\[\n10T + 2T ="
