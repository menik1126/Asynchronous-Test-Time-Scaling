The superfactorial of \\( n \\) is denoted as \\( n\\$, \\) which involves repeatedly taking the factorial of \\( n \\) a total of \\( n \\) times.\n\nFirst, for \\( n = 4 \\), I'll list the factorials:\n- \\( 4! = 24 \\)\n- \\( 3! = 6 \\)\n- \\( 2! = 2 \\)\n- \\( 1! = 1 \\)\n\nNext, I'll apply the superfactorial process step by step:\n1. Start with \\( 4! = 24 \\).\n2. Multiply by \\( 3! \\): \\( 24 \\times 6 = 144 \\).\n3. Multiply by \\( 2! \\): \\( 144 \\times 2 = 288 \\).\n4.
