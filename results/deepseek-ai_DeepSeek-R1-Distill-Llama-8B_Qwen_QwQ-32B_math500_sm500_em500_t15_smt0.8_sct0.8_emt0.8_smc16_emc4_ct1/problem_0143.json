So, 4$$ would be 4!^4!^4!^4!. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute 4!. I know that 4! means 4 factorial, which is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1. That should be 24. So, 4! is 24. That makes 4$$ equal to 24^24^24^24. But wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify this by figuring out the units digit without computing the entire number.\n\nI remember that to find the units digit of a number, I only need to consider the units digit of its components. So, maybe I can find a pattern or use modular arithmetic to find the units digit of 24 raised to various powers.\n\nLet's start from the top of the tower and work our way down, since each term is an exponent of the previous one. So, let's see:\n\nFirst, the innermost term of the superfactorial is 4!, which is 24. Then, moving up, each level is 24 raised to the power of the previous term.\n\nBut wait, actually, the superfactorial is defined as n! iterated n times, right? So for n=4, it's 4!^4!^4!^4!. So, starting from the top, it's 4!^4!^4!^4!. Wait, that would mean starting with 4! and raising it to the 4!th power, then that result raised to the 4!th power, and so on, four times in total.\n\nHmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me parse it again. So, 4$$ = 4!^4!^4!^4!. So, let's compute each step:\n\n1. Start with the top exponent: 4! = 24\n2. Then, the next level down is 4!^24, because the previous term was 24, and we're raising it to the power of 4! (which is 24).\n3. Then, the next level is (4!^24)^24, which is "

Like a^b^c is a^(b^c), not (a^b)^c. So, the superfactorial here would be 24^(24^(24^24)), since each subsequent exponent is placed on top. Wait, but the problem says it's n factorial written n! times. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe question says: \"the superfactorial n$ is defined as n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}\", which means the number of terms in the tower is n!.\n\nWait a second, the subscript n! indicates the number of factors in the tower. Wait, actually, maybe the number of exponent levels is n!.\n\nWait, the problem says \"underbrace{ ... }_{n!}\", which I think means that the number of copies of n! in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nSince n = 4, then the number of layers in the tower is 4! = 24, each layer being 24. Therefore, 4$$ is a tower of 24 copies of 24? So, 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 instances? That's massive!\n\nBut we just need the units digit. Hmm, perhaps there's a pattern in the units digit of powers of 24, considering that the exponents are themselves large numbers.\n\nLet me recall that when dealing with units digits, we can use modulo 10. Since the units digit of a number N mod 10 is the same as N mod 10. However, exponents can be tricky, so Euler's theorem might be helpful here. Euler's theorem states that if two numbers are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n. \u03c6(n) is Euler's totient function. Since we're working mod 10 here, let's see.\n\nFirst, note that 24 and 10 are not coprime, since 2 divides both. Therefore,"

            "output": " Euler's theorem doesn't directly apply. Hmm, that complicates things a bit. Perhaps we can break it down differently.\n\nWait, maybe we can first consider that 24 mod 10 is 4. So, 24 \u2261 4 mod 10. Then, any power of 24 will have a units digit equal to 4 raised to that power mod 10. Therefore, 24^k \u2261 4^k mod 10.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding 4^k mod 10, where k is itself a very large exponent. Since 4 and 10 are coprime (because 4 and 10 share a common factor of 2, so they are not coprime), wait, no, 4 and 10's GCD is 2. Therefore, Euler's theorem might not apply directly here either. Alternatively, maybe we can find the pattern in the units digit of powers of 4.\n\nLet me compute the units digits of powers of 4:\n\n4^1 = 4 \u2192 units digit 4\n4^2 = 16 \u2192 units digit 6\n4^3 = 64 \u2192 units digit 4\n4^4 = 256 \u2192 units digit 6\n... and so on.\n\nI notice a pattern here: the units digit alternates between 4 and 6 every other exponent. So, for exponents 1,3,5,... (odd exponents), the units digit is 4; for even exponents, the units digit is 6.\n\nTherefore, if we can determine whether the exponent is even or odd, we can find the units digit.\n\nBut in this case, the exponent is itself a tower of 24s. So, the key is to determine whether the exponent is even or odd.\n\nWait, but any even number raised to any power remains even. So, 24 is even, so any tower starting with 24 as the top exponent will result in an even number. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have a tower of exponents where the top exponent is even (24), then the next exponent is 24^24, which is even, because 24 is even and any power of an even number is even. So, 24^24 is even. Then, the next exponent is 24^(24^24), which is 24 raised to an even number. Wait, but 24 is even,"

Therefore, the units digit would be 6?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The exponent is the entire tower above the base. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nThe superfactorial 4$$ is equal to 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24 in the tower. Let me denote this as T, where T = 24$$ (but actually, it's 24 with 24 exponents). Wait, but perhaps I can think of it as follows:\n\nLet me denote the tower as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define the tower from the top down. Let\u2019s let E_1 = 24 (the top exponent). Then E_2 = 24^E_1, E_3 = 24^E_2, and so on, up to E_{24} = 24^{E_{23}}. Then, the superfactorial is E_{24}?\n\nWait, actually, the tower has 24 levels, so the total expression is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 24s. So, the exponent of the base 24 is another tower of 23 24s. Let me denote the exponent as E = 24^(24^...^24) with 23 24s. So, the entire expression is 24^E. Since we need the units digit of this, which is equivalent to (24 mod 10)^E mod 10, which is 4^E mod 10.\n\nAs before, since 4 has a cycle of 2 in its units digit (4,6,4,6...), the key is to find E mod 2. Because if E is even, then 4^E mod 10 is 6; if E is odd, it's 4.\n\nTherefore, we need to determine whether E is even or odd. But E is a tower of 23 24s.

Yes, because 24 is even, and any power of an even number remains even. So, 24^24 is even.\n\nNow, let's go one level up. Suppose we have 24^(24^24). Well, 24^24 is even, so the exponent is even. So, 24 raised to an even power. But 24 is even, so again, the result is even. So, 24^(even) is even.\n\nWait a second, but even raised to any power is still even, right? So, no matter how high the tower is, as long as all the exponents are 24 (even), each level of the tower will result in an even number.\n\nTherefore, when we compute E = 24^(24^...^24) with 23 exponents, which is an even number. Then, when we compute 4^E, which is 24^E, the units digit would be 4^E mod 10. Since E is even, 4^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nWait, so putting it all together, 4$$ = 24^(24^(...^24)) with 24 copies of 24, which is 24^E, with E being even because all exponents in the tower are even. Therefore, 24^E mod 10 is 4^E mod 10, and since E is even, that's 6. Therefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. Let me check if my reasoning holds for a smaller number. Let's take n=1, which would be 1!^{} which is just 1. But that's trivial. What about n=2? 2$$ would be 2!^2! which is 2!^2! = 2!^2 = 2^2 = 4, so units digit is 4.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier reasoning, let's see: for n=2, the tower has 2! = 2 layers. So, it would be 2!^2! = 2^2, which is 4, units digit 4.\n\nIf I apply my previous"

Let's see the units digit here. Let's compute the units digit of 6^(6^6). Well, 6 raised to any power always ends with 6. So, 6^anything is 6 mod 10. So, the units digit is 6. Let me see if my method would get that.\n\nFirst, 3! is 6. The tower has 6 layers? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number of layers is n! which for n=3 is 6. Wait, so 3$$ is a tower of 6 copies of 6. So, 6^(6^(6^6^6^6^6)). But regardless of how big that exponent is, since 6 raised to any power is 6 mod 10, so the units digit is 6. So that works.\n\nWait, so for n=3, the units digit is 6, which is correct. So, my method would have worked here as well.\n\nWait, but let's see for n=4. Let me see if my reasoning holds. Let me try to see if the exponent E is even. Since all exponents in the tower are 24, which is even, so the exponent E is even, so 4^E mod 10 is 6. So, the units digit is 6.

Wait, but since we already noticed the pattern in the units digit of 4^k, which cycles every 2, then perhaps it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me think again. Since 4^1 mod 10 =4, 4^2 mod10=6, 4^3 mod10=4, etc. So, the cycle length is 2. Therefore, to find 4^E mod10, we just need E mod2.\n\nIf E is even"

So, E is even because 24 is even, and any tower starting with an even number will result in an even number at each level.\n\nWait, 24 is even, so 24^anything is even, because 24 is a multiple of 2. So, 24^k is even for any k>=1. Thus, the exponent E is even, as each layer of the tower is 24, which is even, so each computation will result in an even number. Therefore, E is even, so 4^E mod10=6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4$$ is 6.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's see the exponent E is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 layers. Now, let me see if E is even. Since 24 is even, 24 raised to any power remains even. So, 24^k is even. Therefore, E is 24 raised to an even number.
