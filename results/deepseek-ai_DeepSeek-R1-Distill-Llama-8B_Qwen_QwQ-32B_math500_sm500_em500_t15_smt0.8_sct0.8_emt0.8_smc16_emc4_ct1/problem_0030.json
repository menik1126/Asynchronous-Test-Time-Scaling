The complex number given is \\(1 - i\\).\n\nNext, I recall that the modulus of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is calculated using the formula \\(|a + bi| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\). This helps me find the modulus of \\(1 - i\\).\n\nCalculating the modulus of \\(1 - i\\), I substitute \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = -1\\) into the formula: \\(|1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nSince the modulus of a complex number raised to a power is the modulus raised to that power, I can simplify the problem by raising \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to the 8th power: \\((\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16\\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\[|(1 - i)^8| is 16.\n</think>\n\nRiproarin' Ringo needs to calculate \\[ |(1 - i)^8| \\].
