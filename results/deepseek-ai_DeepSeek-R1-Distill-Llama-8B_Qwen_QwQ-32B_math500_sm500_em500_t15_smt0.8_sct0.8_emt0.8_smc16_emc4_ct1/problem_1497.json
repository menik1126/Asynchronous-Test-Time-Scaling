These are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I'll consider the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, which includes numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and so on.\n\nTo find the intersection, I'll look for numbers that are both prime and odd. From the list of primes less than 30, I notice that 2 is the only even prime. All other primes are odd.\n\nTherefore, the intersection consists of all the prime numbers less than 30 except for 2. This gives us the numbers 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nCounting these, there are 9 numbers in total.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are tasked with finding the number of elements in the intersection of two sets:\n1. The set of all prime numbers less than 30.\n2. The set of all odd numbers greater than zero.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Prime Numbers Less Than 30**\nPrime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n\\[ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero**\nOdd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. The set of all odd numbers greater than zero is:\n\\[ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, \\ldots \\]\n\n**Step 3: Find the Intersection of Both Sets**\nThe intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd. From the list of prime numbers less than 30, we notice that **2** is the only even prime. All other primes are odd. Therefore, the intersection is:\n\\[ 3, 5,"
