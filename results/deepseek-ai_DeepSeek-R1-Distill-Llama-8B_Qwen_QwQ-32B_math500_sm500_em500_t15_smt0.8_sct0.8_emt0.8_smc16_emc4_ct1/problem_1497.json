Starting from 2, I'll check each number up to 29 to see if it's prime.\n\nNext, I'll list out the prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNow, I need to consider all the odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. They start from 1 and go on as 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and so on.\n\nThe intersection of the two sets will include all prime numbers that are also odd numbers greater than zero. From the list of prime numbers less than 30, all primes except for 2 are odd. Therefore, the primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29 are included in both sets.\n\nCounting these, there are 9 prime numbers that are odd and greater than zero.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero, we'll follow these steps:\n\n<step 1>\n**Identify the Set of Prime Numbers Less Than 30:**\nPrime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n</step>\n\n<step 2>\n**Identify the Set of Odd Numbers Greater Than Zero:**\nOdd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2. The sequence of odd numbers starts at 1 and continues as 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, etc.\n</step>\n\n<step 3>\n**Find the Intersection of Both Sets:**\nThe intersection consists of numbers that are both prime and odd and greater than zero. From the set of primes less than 30, the only even prime is 2. Since we are considering odd numbers, we exclude 2.\n</step>\n\n<step 4"
