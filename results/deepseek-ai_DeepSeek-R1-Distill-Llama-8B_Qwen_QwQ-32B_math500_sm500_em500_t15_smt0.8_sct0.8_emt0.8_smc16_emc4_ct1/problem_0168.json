Hmm, okay, let me write that down to visualize it better.\n\nSo, it's ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. I remember that when dealing with cube roots, one way to get rid of them is by cubing both sides of the equation. That should help me eliminate the radical and make the equation more manageable. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll cube both sides. So, the cube of the left side is just x² - 4x + 4 because the cube and the cube root cancel each other out. On the right side, 16 cubed is... let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... hmm, 256*10 is 2560, 256*6 is 1536, so adding those together gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, I get:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nOkay, that's a quadratic equation now. I need to solve for x. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides to set it to zero:\n\nx² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\nSimplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, so:\n\nx² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a standard quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0. Here, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. To solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula, which is:\n\nx = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nb² is (-4)² which is 16.\n\nThen, 4ac is 4*1*(-4092) which is 4*(-4092). Let me calculate that. 4*4000 is 16000, and 4*(-92) is -368, so 16000 - 368 is 15632. But wait, since c is negative, it's actually -15632.\n\nSo, the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac, is "

            "output": "16 - (-15632). Subtracting a negative is like adding the positive, so that becomes 16 + 15632, which is 15648.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\nx = [4 ± √15648] / 2\n\nHmm, √15648. That seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify that. Maybe factor 15648 into a product of a perfect square and another number.\n\nFirst, let me see if 15648 is divisible by some small squares. Let's try 16, since 16 is a perfect square. 15648 divided by 16 is:\n\n16 times 900 is 14400, subtract that from 15648: 15648 - 14400 = 1248.\n\n16 times 78 is 1248. So, 16*900=14400 and 16*78=1248, so 16*(900+78) = 16*978 = 15648.\n\nSo, √15648 = √(16*978) = √16 * √978 = 4√978.\n\nHmm, now 978 is still not a perfect square. Let's check if 978 has any square factors. 978 divided by 2 is 489, which is not divisible by 2 again. Let me check 489: 4+8+9=21, which is divisible by 3, so 489 ÷ 3 = 163. 163 is a prime number because it's not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13... Let me check: 13*12 is 156, 13*13 is 169, which is more than 163. So, yes, 163 is prime.\n\nSo, 978 factors into 2*3*163. Since none of these are perfect squares, √978 is the simplest radical form. So, √15648 = 4√978.\n\nPutting that back into the equation:\n\nx = [4 ± 4√978] / 2\n\nNow, I can factor out a 4 in the numerator:\n\nx = [4(1 ± √978)] / 2\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:\n\nx = 2(1 ± √978)\n\nSo, that gives me two possible solutions:\n\nx = 2(1 + √978) and x = 2(1 - √"

            "output": "978)\n\nBut the problem asks for the positive value of x, so I need to check which of these is positive.\n\nFirst, let's see √978. Since 978 is between 31²=961 and 32²=1024, √978 is between 31 and 32. Let's approximate it: 31.5² is 992.25, which is higher than 978, so √978 is approximately 31.5 - (992.25 - 978)/(31.5*2). Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute 31²=961, 31.5²=992.25, so 978 - 961=17. So, √978≈31 + 17/(2*31)≈31 + 17/62≈31 + 0.274≈31.274.\n\nWait, actually, a better approximation is needed for √978.\n\nWait, another method: let me do a linear approximation.\n\nWe know that 31²=961 and 31.3²= (31 + 0.3)^2=31² + 2*31*0.3 + 0.3²=961 + 18.6 + 0.09=979.69. Oh, that's really close to 978. So, 31.3²≈979.69, which is just 1.69 more than 978. So, let's use that. So, we can approximate √978≈31.3 - (1.69)/(2*31.3). Since the derivative of x² is 2x, the linear approximation is f(x+Δx)≈f(x) + Δx*f’(x).\n\nSo, Δx is -1.69, and f’(x)=2*31.3=62.6. So, √(31.3² - 1.69)≈31.3 - 1.69/62.6≈31.3 - 0.027≈31.273.\n\nSo, √978≈31.273.\n\nTherefore, 1 + √978≈32.273, so 2*(1 + √978)≈64.546.\n\nOn the other hand, 1 - √978≈1 - 31.273≈-30.273, and 2*(-30"

But let's see if we can write the exact form or if there is an exact solution.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake earlier in simplifying. Let me go back and check.\n\nWe had x² - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nWait, x² -4x +4 is a perfect square. Let's see: (x - 2)^2 = x² -4x +4. So, yes, the equation becomes (x - 2)^2 = 4096.\n\nTaking square roots on both sides, we get x - 2 = ±√4096.\n\n√4096 is 64 because 64²=4096. So, x - 2 = ±64.\n\nSo, solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 2 ±64.\n\nTherefore, the two solutions are x = 2 + 64 = 66 and x=2 -64 = -62.\n\nWait, wait, that's different from what I got earlier when I used the quadratic formula. So, I must have messed up the quadratic formula approach earlier.\n\nWait, why? Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nAh, I see. Earlier, after getting x² -4x -4092=0, I used the quadratic formula, but maybe instead, I should have completed the square because the quadratic can be written as (x - 2)^2 - 4096 = 0.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nx² -4x +4 = (x - 2)^2. So, setting (x - 2)^2 = 4096.\n\nTherefore, x -2 = ±√4096=±64. So, x=2±64, giving x=66 or x=-62.\n\nSo, that's much simpler. I think I confused myself earlier by incorrectly applying the quadratic formula, or maybe miscalculating the discriminant.\n\nSo, the correct solutions are x=66 and x=-62. Since the problem asks for the positive value, it's x=66.\n\nWait, so why did my quadratic formula approach give me different answers? Let me check that again to find where I went wrong.\n\nIn the quadratic formula, I had:\n\nx"

I think I messed up the discriminant calculation earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nYes, that's the mistake. Earlier, I thought that 4ac was 4*1*(-4092) which is -16368, so the discriminant is 16 - (4ac) which would be 16 - (-16368) = 16 +16368 = 16384. But in my first calculation, I had written 16 - (-15632) = 15648, which is wrong. Wait, where did 15632 come from?\n\nAh, here's the error. Let me recalculate:\n\n4ac = 4 * a * c = 4 *1*(-4092) = -16368. Therefore, the discriminant is b² -4ac = 16 - (4ac) = 16 - (-16368) = 16 +16368 = 16384.\n\nAh, so I must have miscalculated 4ac earlier. I think I did 4*4092 as 15632 instead of 16368. Let me check 4*4092:\n\n4092 *4: 4000*4=16000, 92*4=368, so total is 16000+368=16368. So, yes, that's correct. So, the discriminant is 16384, not 15648. That was my mistake earlier.\n\nSo, sqrt(16384). Let's see, 128 squared is 1"

So, yes, sqrt(16384)=128.\n\nTherefore, x = [4 ±128]/2.\n\nSo, 4 +128=132, divided by 2 gives x=66.\n\n4 -128= -124, divided by 2 gives x=-62.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before, x=66 or x=-62. So, the positive solution is x=66.\n\nTherefore, the initial mistake was miscalculating the discriminant when I used the quadratic formula, leading to an incorrect intermediate step, but upon realizing that, both methods agree.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start with ∛(x² -4x +4)=16.\n\n2. Cube both sides: x² -4x +4=4096.\n\n3. Recognize that x² -4x +4 is (x-2)^2, so (x-2)^2=4096.\n\n4. Take square roots: x-2=±64.\n\n5. Solve for x: x=2±64.\n\n6. Select the positive solution: x=66.\n\nAlternatively, using quadratic formula:\n\n1. Bring equation to standard form: x² -4x -4092=0.\n\n2. Compute discriminant: D= (-4)^2 -4*1*(-4092)=16 +16368=16384.\n\n3. Square root discriminant: sqrt(16384)=128.\n\n4. Solutions: x=(4±128)/2, which gives x=(132)/2=66 and x=(-124)/2=-62.\n\nEither way, the positive solution is x=66.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16, follow these steps:\n\n1. Cube both sides to eliminate the cube root:\n   \\[\n   x² - 4x + 4 = 16³ = 4096\n   \\]\n\n2. Recognize that \\(x² - 4x + 4\\) is a perfect square:\n   \\[\n   (x - 2)² = 4096\n   \\]\n\n3.
