There are 7 boys in total, and he needs to select 3. This can be done in 7 choose 3 ways.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the girls. There are 4 girls, and he needs to select 2. This can be done in 4 choose 2 ways.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to form the group, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll use the concept of **combinations**. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k! \\times (n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items.\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose.\n- \\( ! \\) denotes factorial.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times (7 - 3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3! \\times 4!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times (4 - 2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls to get the total number of ways to form the group.**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = C"
