There are 7 boys, and he needs to select 3. This can be done using the combination formula: C(7,3).\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the girls. There are 4 girls, and he needs to select 2. This can be done using the combination formula: C(4,2).\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to pick both the boys and the girls, I'll multiply the results of the two combinations: C(7,3) * C(4,2).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll use combinations since the order in which the students are chosen does not matter.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the two results to find the total number of ways to choose both the boys and the girls.**\n\\[\n\\text{Total ways} = C(7, 3) \\times C(4, 2) = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
