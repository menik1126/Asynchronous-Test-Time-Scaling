            "output": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a complex number ω such that ω³ = 1. We need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nFirst, since ω³ = 1, ω is a cube root of unity. I remember that the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, we can consider ω and ω² as the non-trivial cube roots.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\). Maybe it's helpful to find a common denominator or to combine these fractions.\n\nLet me denote S as the sum:\n\n\\( S = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} \\)\n\nTo add these two fractions, I can find a common denominator. The common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). So,\n\n\\( S = \\frac{1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega^2) + 1 \\cdot (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} \\)\n\nLet me compute the numerator first:\n\nNumerator = (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω²\n\nNow, let's compute the denominator:\n\nDenominator = (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω²\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n= 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut wait, since ω³ = 1, this becomes:\n\n= 1 + ω² + ω + 1\n\n= 2 + ω + ω²\n\nInteresting, so both the numerator and the denominator have the same expression: 2 + ω + ω².\n\nSo, S = (2 + ω + ω²) / (2 + ω + ω²) = 1\n\nHmm, so is S equal to 1? That seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, but if ω = 1, then we have a different case because then ω³ = 1, but if ω = 1, the original"

So regardless of which cube root of unity we take (whether ω = 1, ω, or ω²), the expression S equals 1.\n\nWait, but in the case when ω is not 1, it's a bit different, but after computation, we still get 1. So maybe the value is always 1?\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps there's a formula or identity related to roots of unity that can be applied here.\n\nI recall that for cube roots of unity, the relations ω² + ω + 1 = 0 holds because 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Is that right? Let me verify.\n\nIndeed, since ω³ = 1, we can write ω³ - 1 = 0, which factors as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. Since ω ≠ 1, it must satisfy ω² + ω + 1 = 0. So, ω² + ω = -1.\n\nSo, going back to the numerator: 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, the denominator was 2 + ω + ω² = 1.\n\nSo, S = (1)/(1) = 1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the value of ω (whether 1, ω, or ω²), the expression S is equal to 1.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific numbers to confirm.\n\nTake ω = e^(2πi/3) which is a primitive cube root of unity. Let me compute S.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nFirst, 1 + ω = 1 + e^(2πi/3) = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + e^(4πi/3) = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 -"

So that works too.\n\nTherefore, the expression is always equal to 1, regardless of which cube root of unity we choose. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, but the question says \"find all possible values\". Since ω can be 1, ω, or ω², but in all cases the expression is 1, so the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nHmm, but let me check another approach just to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using substitution. Let me suppose that ω ≠ 1, so ω is a primitive root. Then, since ω² = ω^{-1}, so maybe we can write the expression in terms of ω and its inverse.\n\nAlternatively, note that 1 + ω = 1 + ω, and 1 + ω² = 1 + ω"
