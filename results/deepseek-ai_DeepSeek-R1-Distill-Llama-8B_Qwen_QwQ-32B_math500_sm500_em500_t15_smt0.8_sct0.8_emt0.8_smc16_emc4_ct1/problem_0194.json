I remember from school that the Rational Root Theorem can be useful for problems like this. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nThe Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients is of the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this equation, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. So, that means any possible rational root is just a factor of -14. Since we're looking for integer roots specifically, \\(q\\) would be 1, so the possible integer roots are just the factors of -14. \n\nWhat are the factors of -14? Well, the factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14, and since it's negative, the integer roots could be ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14. I should test each of these to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet me start with the smaller numbers because they might be easier to compute. Let's try x = 1 first.\n\nPlugging x = 1 into the equation: \\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14\\). Calculating each term: 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 -14. Let's add them up: 1 +5 is 6, plus 9 is 15, minus 1 is 14, minus 14 is 0. Oh, so 1 is a root! Nice, so (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial.\n\nNow, let's try x = -1. Sometimes negative numbers can also be roots, so let's check.\n\nPlugging x = -1: \\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) -14\\). Calculating each term: 1 + (-5) + 9 +1 -14. Adding them up: 1 -5 is -4, plus 9 is 5, plus 1 is "

Let's add them: 16 +40 is 56, plus 36 is 92, minus 2 is 90, minus 14 is 76. Not zero. So, 2 is not a root.\n\nHow about x = -2? Let me see.\n\n\\((-2)^4 +5(-2)^3 +9(-2)^2 -(-2) -14\\). That's 16 + (-40) + 36 +2 -14. Adding up: 16 -40 is -24, plus 36 is 12, plus 2 is 14, minus 14 is 0. Oh, so -2 is also a root! Great, so (x + 2) is another factor.\n\nNow, let's check x = 7. This might take a bit longer.\n\nPlugging in x =7: \\(7^4 +5(7)^3 +9(7)^2 -7 -14\\). Calculating each term:\n\n7^4 is 7*7*7*7. Let me compute that step by step:\n\n7*7 = 49, 49*7=343, 343*7=2401.\n\n5*7^3: 7^3 is 343, so 5*343 is 1715.\n\n9*7^2: 7^2 is 49, so 9*49 is 441.\n\nThen, -7 and -14.\n\nSo adding all together: 2401 + 1715 + 441 -7 -14.\n\nLet me add 2401 and 1715 first: 2401+1715=4116.\n\nThen add 441: 4116 +441=4557.\n\nSubtract 7: 4557-7=4550.\n\nSubtract 14: 4550-14=4536.

Not zero, so -14 isn't a root.\n\nSo, from the possible integer roots, the ones that worked were x=1 and x=-2.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm if there are more roots. Because it's a quartic equation, it can have up to four roots, and we've found two. Maybe I should factor the polynomial using these roots and see if there are any more.\n\nSince we have (x - 1) and (x + 2) as factors, let's perform polynomial division to factor them out.\n\nFirst, let's divide the original polynomial by (x - 1). Let me set up the long division.\n\nDividing \\(x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14\\) by (x - 1):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nSet up coefficients: 1 (x^4), 5 (x^3), 9 (x^2), -1 (x), -14 (constant).\n\nUsing x=1:\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1*1=1, add to next coefficient:5+1=6.\n\nMultiply 6*1=6, add to next coefficient:9+6=15.\n\nMultiply 15*1=15, add to next coefficient:-1 +15=14.\n\nMultiply 14*1=14, add to last coefficient: -14 +14=0. Perfect, so the result is 1x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14.\n\nSo, the polynomial becomes (x -1)(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14).\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic polynomial \\(x^3 +6x^2 +15x +14\\). Let's try the possible roots again, using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 14: ±1, ±2, ±7, ±14.\n\nTesting x = -2 again, because we already have (x + 2) as a factor.\n\nPlugging x=-"

So, (x +2) is a factor.\n\nNow, perform synthetic division on the cubic with x=-2.\n\nCoefficients:1 (x^3),6 (x^2),15 (x),14.\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply 1*(-2)= -2. Add to next coefficient:6 + (-2)=4.\n\nMultiply 4*(-2)= -8. Add to next coefficient:15 + (-8)=7.\n\nMultiply 7*(-2)= -14. Add to last coefficient:14 + (-14)=0. Perfect.\n\nSo, now we have (x +2)(x^2 +4x +7). So, the polynomial factors to (x -1)(x +2)(x^2 +4x +7).\n\nNow, the quadratic factor is x^2 +4x +7. Let's see if this factors or if it has real roots. The discriminant is \\(b^2 -4ac =16 - 28 = -12\\). Since the discriminant is negative, it doesn't have real roots, which means the remaining roots are complex numbers, not integers.\n\nTherefore, the only integer roots of the original equation are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nWait, but the question says \"find all integer roots\", so those are the only two. So, x=1 and x=-2 are the integer roots.\n</think>\n\nThe integer roots of the equation are found by testing possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing shows that x=1 and x=-2 satisfy the equation. Factoring the polynomial using these roots reveals that the remaining quadratic factor does not have real roots, confirming only 1 and -2 as integer solutions.\n\n**Answer:** The integer roots are \\boxed{1} and \\boxed{-2}."
