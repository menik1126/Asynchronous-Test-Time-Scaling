Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials, the Rational Root Theorem can be useful in finding possible rational roots. The theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms p/q, p is a factor of the constant term, and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nLooking at the equation, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible rational roots are the factors of -14 divided by 1, which means the possible integer roots are just the factors of -14. \n\nThe factors of -14 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b17, and \u00b114. So, the integer roots, if any, must be one of these numbers. \n\nNow, let me test each of these candidates by substituting them into the polynomial and seeing if the result is zero.\n\nStarting with x = 1:\n\\(1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0\\). Wait, that adds up to 0! So, x = 1 is a root.\n\nGreat, one root down. Let's try x = -1:\n\\((-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3 + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14 = -8\\). Not zero, so x = -1 isn't a root.\n\nNext, x = 2:\n\\(2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14 = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14 = 76\\). Definitely not zero. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me recount:\n\n16 + 40 = 56; 56 + 36 = 92; 92 - 2 = 90; 90 - 14 = 76. Yep, that's correct. So x=2 isn't a root.\n\nHow about x = -2:\n\\((-2)^4 + 5(-"

Oh! x = -2 is also a root.\n\nAlright, that's two roots: 1 and -2. Let's proceed.\n\nTesting x = 7:\n\\(7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14\\). Calculating each term:\n\n7^4 is 2401; 5*7^3 is 5*343 = 1715; 9*7^2 is 9*49 = 441; then -7 and -14.\n\nAdding up: 2401 + 1715 = 4116; 4116 + 441 = 4557; 4557 - 7 = 4550; 4550 - 14 = 4536. Definitely not zero. So x=7 isn't a root.\n\nx = -7:\n\\((-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) - 14\\). Compute each term:\n\n(-7)^4 is 2401; 5*(-7)^3 is 5*(-343) = -1715; 9*(-7)^2 is 9*49 = 441; then +7 and -14.\n\nAdding up: 2401 - 1715 = 686; 686 + 441 = 1127; 1127 + 7 = 1134; 1134 -14=1120. Not zero. So x=-7 isn't a root.\n\nMoving on to x = 14:\n\\(14^4 + 5(14)^3 + 9(14)^2 - 14 - 14\\). That's going to be a huge number. Let me calculate:\n\n14^4: 14*14=196; 196*14=2744; 2744*14=38416.

Since the polynomial is quartic (degree 4), it can have up to four real roots, but the problem is only asking for integer roots.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in testing another root? Let me double-check x=2.\n\nWait, when I calculated x=2, I got 76, which is not zero. Hmm. Maybe another approach is needed, such as factoring.\n\nSince we've found that x=1 and x=-2 are roots, we can factor (x -1)(x +2) out of the polynomial.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor it out.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the polynomial as (x-1)(x+2)(quadratic). Let me try that.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n(x -1)(x +2)(ax^2 + bx + c) = x^4 +5x^3 +9x^2 -x -14.\n\nMultiplying (x -1)(x +2): First, multiply x*(x +2) = x^2 +2x, then -1*(x +2)= -x -2. So together, x^2 +2x -x -2 = x^2 +x -2.\n\nSo, (x^2 +x -2)(ax^2"

Coefficient of x^4: a =1.\n\n2. Coefficient of x^3: b +a =5. Since a=1, so b=4.\n\n3. Coefficient of x^2: c + b -2a =9. Plugging in b=4 and a=1: c +4 -2 =9 \u2192 c +2=9 \u2192 c=7.\n\n4. Coefficient of x: c -2b = -1. Plugging in c=7 and b=4: 7 -8 = -1. That works.\n\n5. Constant term: -2c = -14. Since c=7, -2*7 = -14.
