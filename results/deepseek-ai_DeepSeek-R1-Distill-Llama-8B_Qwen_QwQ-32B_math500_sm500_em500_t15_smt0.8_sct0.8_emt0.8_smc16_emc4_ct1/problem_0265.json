            "output": "First, I need to understand the relationships between Trinkets, Blinkets, and Drinkets.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets. So, if I have 1 Trinket, it's the same as having 4 Blinkets.\n\nNext, I'm told that 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets. That means every time I have 3 Blinkets, it can be exchanged for 7 Drinkets.\n\nNow, I want to find out how many Trinkets 56 Drinkets are worth. Starting with 56 Drinkets, I'll convert them to Blinkets first. Since 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets, I'll divide 56 by 3 to get the number of Blinkets:\n\n56 ÷ 3 = 18 with a remainder of 2. So, 56 Drinkets equal 18 Blinkets plus 2 extra Drinkets.\n\nBut since Drinkets can't be broken down further, I'll consider the 2 extra Drinkets as part of the total Blinkets.\n\nNow, I know that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets. To find out how many Trinkets 18 Blinkets equal, I'll divide 18 by 4:\n\n18 ÷ 4 = 4 with a remainder of 2. So, 18 Blinkets equal 4 Trinkets plus 2 Blinkets.\n\nAgain, the 2 Blinkets can't be converted into a full Trinket, so I'll include them in the total.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are equal to 18 Blinkets, which can be converted into 4 Trinkets plus 2 Blinkets. Since those 2 Blinkets are still part of the system, the total value in Trinkets is 4 Trinkets and 2 Blinkets.\n\nCalculating the total, 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, so 4 Trinkets is equal to 16 Blinkets. Adding the remaining 2 Blinkets gives a total of 18 Blinkets, which is the original equivalent value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets.\n\nSo, 56 Drinkets are worth 18 Blinkets, which is equivalent to 4 Trinkets and 2 Blinkets. Converting everything back to Trinkets, 56 Drinkets equal 4.5 Trinkets.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense"

Since 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets, then 1 Drincket = 3/7 Blinkets.\n\nSo, 56 Drinkets * (3 Blinkets / 7 Drinkets) = (56 * 3)/7 Blinkets = (56/7)*3 = 8*3 = 24 Blinkets.\n\nAh, that's better. I made a mistake earlier in division. 56 divided by 7 is 8, so 8 times 3 is 24 Blinkets.\n\nNow, converting Blinkets to Trinkets. Since 1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets, then 1 Blincket = 1/4 Trinket.\n\nSo, 24 Blinkets * (1 Trinket /4 Blinkets) = 24/4 = 6 Trinkets.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets equal 6 Trinkets.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me verify again.\n\nFirst step: 56 Drinkets to Blinkets:\n\n3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets → 1 Drincket = 3/7 Blinkets.\n\n56 * (3/7) = (56/7)*3 = 8*3 =24 Blinkets.\n\nSecond step: 24 Blinkets to Trinkets:\n\n1 Trinket =4 Blinkets → 1 Blincket =1/4 Trinket.\n\n24 * (1/4) =6 Trinkets.\n\nYes, that's correct. The initial mistake was in dividing 56 by 3 instead of multiplying by the correct conversion factor. So the correct answer is 6 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nFirst, convert Drinkets to Blinkets using the given exchange rate. Since 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, we have:\n\\[\n56 \\text{ Drinkets} \\times \\frac{3 \\text{ Blinkets}}{7 \\text{ Drinkets}} = \\frac{56 \\times 3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets} = 24 \\text{ Blinkets}.\n\\]\n\nNext, convert Blinkets to Trinkets.
