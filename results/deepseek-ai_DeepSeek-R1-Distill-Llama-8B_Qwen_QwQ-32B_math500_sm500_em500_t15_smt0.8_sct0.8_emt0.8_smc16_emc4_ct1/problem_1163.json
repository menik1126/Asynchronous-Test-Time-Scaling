This means I can rewrite the equation as \\( 3^{6k} = 3^6 \\).\n\nSince the bases on both sides of the equation are the same (both are 3), I can set the exponents equal to each other. This gives me \\( 6k = 6 \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 6, resulting in \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( k \\) that satisfies the equation is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\({(3^k)}^6 = 3^6\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nk = \\boxed{1}\n\\]"
