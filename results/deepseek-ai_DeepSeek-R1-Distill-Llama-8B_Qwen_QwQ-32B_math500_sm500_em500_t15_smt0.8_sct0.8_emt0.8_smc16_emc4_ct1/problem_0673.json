Therefore, the number of players x must satisfy the equation x × y = 54.\n\nSince each player must receive at least 5 cards, y is at least 5. Additionally, there must be at least 2 players, so x is at least 2.\n\nI'll list all the factors of 54 to identify possible values of x:\n54 factors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54.\n\nConsidering the constraints:\n- x ≥ 2.\n- y = 54 / x ≥ 5.\n\nI'll evaluate each possible x:\n- x = 2: y = 27 (satisfies y ≥ 5).\n- x = 3: y = 18 (satisfies y ≥ 5).\n- x = 6: y = 9 (satisfies y ≥ 5).\n- x = 9: y = 6 (satisfies y ≥ 5).\n- x = 18: y = 3 (doesn't satisfy y ≥ 5).\n- x = 27: y = 2 (doesn't satisfy y ≥ 5).\n- x = 54: y = 1 (doesn't satisfy y ≥ 5).\n\nFrom this, the valid values of x are 2, 3, 6, and 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many possible values of \\( x \\) there are, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Total number of cards = 54\n   - Each player gets \\( y \\) cards, where \\( y \\geq 5 \\)\n   - Number of players = \\( x \\), with \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( x \\times y = 54 \\)\n\n2. **Identify the Factors of 54:**\n   - 54 can be factored into its prime components: \\( 54 = 2 \\times 3^3 \\)\n   - The factors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54\n\n3. **Apply the Constraints to Possible Values of \\( x \\):**\n   - \\( x \\) must be at least 2.\n  "
