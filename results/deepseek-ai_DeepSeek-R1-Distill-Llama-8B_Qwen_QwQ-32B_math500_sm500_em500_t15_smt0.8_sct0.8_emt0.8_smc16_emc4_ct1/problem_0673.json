This means that each player gets y cards, so the minimum number of cards per player is 5.\n\nTo find the possible values of x, we can express y as y = total cards divided by x. Specifically, y = 54 / x.\n\nSince y must be at least 5, set up the inequality 54 / x >= 5. Solving this gives x <= 54 / 5, which is x <= 10.8. Since x must be an integer, x can be at most 10.\n\nAdditionally, x must be at least 2, so x ranges from 2 to 10 inclusive.\n\nThe possible values of x are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, which totals 9 possible values.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nYou have a deck of **54** cards. You deal all the cards to **x** players, with each player receiving **y** cards. Given that \\( x \\) is at least **2** and \\( y \\) is at least **5**, determine how many possible values of \\( x \\) there are.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Constraints**\n- **Total number of cards (\\( C \\))**: 54\n- **Number of players (\\( x \\))**: \\( x \\geq 2 \\)\n- **Cards per player (\\( y \\))**: \\( y \\geq 5 \\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Express \\( y \\) in Terms of \\( x \\)**\nSince the total number of cards is distributed equally among \\( x \\) players, we have:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{C}{x} = \\frac{54}{x}\n\\]\nGiven that \\( y \\geq 5 \\), we can set up the inequality:\n\\[\n\\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Solve the Inequality for \\( x \\)**\n\\[\n\\frac{54}{x} \\geq 5 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow 54 \\geq 5"
