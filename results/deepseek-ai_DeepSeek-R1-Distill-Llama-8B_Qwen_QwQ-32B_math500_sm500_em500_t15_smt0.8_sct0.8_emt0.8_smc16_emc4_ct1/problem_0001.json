Hmm, okay, monic polynomial means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So, \\( P(x) \\) should look something like \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nThe problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), it has a remainder \\( R(x) \\). And when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we're given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\). Okay, let's jot that down.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a polynomial is divided by another polynomial, say \\( D(x) \\), the remainder has a degree less than \\( D(x) \\). So, since \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) is a quadratic (degree 2), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) must be linear, right? So, \\( R(x) \\) should look like \\( mx + n \\) for some constants \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), which is also quadratic, the remainder \\( 2R(x) \\) is also linear. So, that's consistent. So, \\( R(x) \\) is a linear polynomial, either \\( ax + b \\) or something like that. Wait, but \\( R(x) \\) is the same for both divisions? Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nLet me think. So, \\( P(x) = Q_1(x)(x - 1)(x - 4) + R(x) \\) and \\( P(x) = Q_2(x)(x - 2)(x - 3) + 2R(x) \\), where \\( Q_1(x) \\) and \\( Q_2(x) \\) are the quotients. Since both expressions equal \\( P(x) \\), they must be equal to each other. So, setting them equal:\n\n\\("

Maybe I can use the Remainder Theorem or something with the given points.\n\nWait, since \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), that means that \\( P(1) = R(1) \\) and \\( P(4) = R(4) \\). Similarly, because when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\), so \\( P(2) = 2R(2) \\) and \\( P(3) = 2R(3) \\). Okay, that's a useful piece of information.\n\nAlso, since \\( P(x) \\) is cubic, and \\( R(x) \\) is linear, I can express \\( P(x) \\) as \\( (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \\), where \\( Q_1(x) \\) is linear, since \\( P(x) \\) is degree 3 and \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\) is degree 2, so \\( Q_1(x) \\) must be degree 1. Similarly, since \\( P(x) \\) can be expressed as \\( (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\), and \\( Q_2(x) \\) must also be linear.\n\nSo, if I let \\( Q_1(x) = ax + b \\) and \\( Q_2(x) = cx + d \\), then I can write:\n\n\\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)(ax + b) + R(x) \\)\nand\n\\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)(cx + d) + 2R(x) \\)\n\nSince both expressions equal \\("

So, perhaps R(x) is of the form k(x - a)(x - b). No, since R(x) is linear. Alternatively, perhaps R(x) is a constant? Wait, but no, because when you divide by (x -2)(x -3), the remainder is 2 R(x), which is still linear.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of setting up two separate expressions, maybe I should consider the relationship between the two expressions.\n\nSo, since both expressions equal P(x):\n\n\\( (x -1)(x -4)(p x + q) + R(x) = (x -2)(x -3)(r x + s) + 2 R(x) \\)\n\nBut since both have p and r as 1, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, substituting p = r =1, s = q,\n\n\\( (x -1)(x -4)(x + q) + R(x) = (x -2)(x -3)(x + q) + 2 R(x) \\)\n\nSo, bring R(x) to the right:\n\n\\( (x -1)(x -4)(x + q) = (x -2)(x -3)(x + q) + R(x) \\)\n\nHmm, that's an equation we can evaluate at specific x values to find q and R(x).\n\nWait, let's evaluate at x =1: Left side becomes 0, right side is (1 -2)(1 -3)(1 + q) + R(1). But (1 -2)(1 -3) = (-1)(-2) = 2. So,\n\nLeft side: 0\nRight side: 2(1 + q) + R(1)\n\nTherefore, 2(1 + q) + R(1) = 0.\n\nBut P(1) = R(1).
