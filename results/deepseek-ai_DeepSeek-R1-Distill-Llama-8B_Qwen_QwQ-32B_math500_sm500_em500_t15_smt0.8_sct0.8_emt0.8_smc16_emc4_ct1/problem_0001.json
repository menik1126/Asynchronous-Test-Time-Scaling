            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here about a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, right? So it should look something like \\( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\). \n\nThe problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). And when it's divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we're given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So let's break this down. Since it's a cubic polynomial, when we divide it by a quadratic, the remainder should be linear, right? So \\( R(x) \\) is a linear polynomial, which I can write as \\( R(x) = mx + n \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants I need to find.\n\nSo when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which is \\( x^2 - 5x + 4 \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). That means \\( P(x) = (x^2 - 5x + 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \\) for some polynomial \\( Q_1(x) \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), which is \\( x^2 - 5x + 6 \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). So \\( P(x) = (x^2 - 5x + 6)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\) for some polynomial \\( Q_2(x) \\).\n\nSince both \\( Q_1(x) \\) and \\( Q_2(x) \\) are polynomials, and we have expressions for \\( P(x) \\) in terms of them, maybe I can set up some equations or use the Remainder Theorem to find \\( R(x) \\) or \\( P(x) \\).\n\nWait, the Remainder Theorem says that the remainder of a polynomial \\( P"

So, since \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), that means \\( R(1) = P(1) \\) and \\( R(4) = P(4) \\). Similarly, \\( 2R(x) \\) is the remainder when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), so \\( 2R(2) = P(2) \\) and \\( 2R(3) = P(3) \\).\n\nSo, we have a system of equations here. Let me note that.\n\nFrom the first division:\n1. \\( P(1) = R(1) = m(1) + n = m + n \\)\n2. \\( P(4) = R(4) = m(4) + n = 4m + n \\)\n\nFrom the second division:\n3. \\( P(2) = 2R(2) = 2(m(2) + n) = 4m + 2n \\)\n4. \\( P(3) = 2R(3) = 2(m(3) + n) = 6m + 2n \\)\n\nAlso, since \\( P(x) \\) is a monic cubic, it can be written as \\( x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c \\). We are given \\( P(0) = c = 5 \\). So we know that \\( c = 5 \\). So the constant term is 5.\n\nBut I need to find \\( P(5) \\). Let me see if I can find expressions for \\( P(1) \\), \\( P(2) \\), \\( P(3) \\), and \\( P(4) \\) to relate them to \\( R(x) \\).\n\nSo, \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). Also, if I can write \\( P(x) \\) in terms of \\( R(x) \\) and the divisors, maybe I can relate \\( P(x) \\) to \\( R(x) \\).\n\nAlternatively, since \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x -"

So:\n\n\\( (x^2 - 5x + 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) = (x^2 - 5x + 6)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\)\n\nSimplify: \\( (x^2 - 5x + 4)Q_1(x) - (x^2 - 5x + 6)Q_2(x) = R(x) \\)\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another approach.\n\nAnother thought: since \\( R(x) \\) is the remainder when divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), then \\( R(1) = P(1) \\) and \\( R(4) = P(4) \\). Similarly, \\( R(2) = \\frac{P(2)}{2} \\) and \\( R(3) = \\frac{P(3)}{2} \\).\n\nSo, let's write down these equations.\n\nFirst, \\( R(1) = P(1) = m + n \\).\n\n\\( R(4) = P(4) = 4m + n \\).\n\nAlso, from the second division, \\( R(2) = \\frac{P(2)}{2} \\) and \\( R(3) = \\frac{P(3)}{2} \\).\n\nSo, \\( R(2) = 2m + n = \\frac{P(2)}{2"
