Yann has 10 choices, and for each of Yann's choices, Camille also has 10 possible dishes. So, multiplying these gives 10 multiplied by 10, which equals 100 total combinations.\n\nHowever, the problem states that both Yann and Camille refuse to order the same dish. This means we need to subtract the scenarios where both have chosen the same dish. There are 10 such scenarios, one for each dish.\n\nBy subtracting these duplicate scenarios from the total, we get 100 minus 10, which equals 90 unique meal combinations where Yann and Camille do not order the same dish.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nYann and Camille go to a restaurant. If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Total Possible Combinations Without Restrictions:**  \n   - Yann has 10 choices of dishes.  \n   - For each of Yann's 10 choices, Camille also has 10 choices.  \n   - Therefore, the total number of possible combinations is \\( 10 \\times 10 = 100 \\).\n\n2. **Subtract the Combinations Where Both Ordered the Same Dish:**  \n   - There are 10 dishes on the menu.  \n   - If both Yann and Camille order the same dish, there are 10 such scenarios (one for each dish).  \n   - Therefore, we need to subtract these 10 duplicate combinations from the total.  \n   - So, \\( 100 - 10 = 90 \\).\n\n3. **Final Answer:**  \n   - There are **90** different combinations of meals they can order without both choosing the same dish.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"
