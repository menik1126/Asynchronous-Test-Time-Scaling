After Yann has chosen his meal, Camille cannot select the same dish, so she only has 9 remaining options.\n\nTo find the total number of unique combinations, I'll multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has, which is 10 multiplied by 9, resulting in 90 different combinations.\n\nTherefore, Yann and Camille can order from 90 different meal combinations without both choosing the same dish.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of possible meal combinations Yann and Camille can order under the given conditions.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n- **Total Dishes Available:** 10\n- **Condition:** They refuse to order the **same** dish.\n- **Important:** The order matters (Yann choosing dish A and Camille choosing dish B is different from Yann choosing dish B and Camille choosing dish A).\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Possible Combinations**\n1. **First, consider Yann's choice:**\n   - Yann has **10** options to choose from.\n\n2. **Second, consider Camille's choice:**\n   - After Yann has chosen a dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish.\n   - Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining options.\n\n3. **Multiply the choices:**\n   - Total combinations = Yann's choices × Camille's choices\n   - Total combinations = 10 × 9 = **90**\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThere are \\(\\boxed{90}\\) different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order without both choosing the same dish."

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
