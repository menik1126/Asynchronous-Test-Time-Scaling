            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the modulus of a complex number w, which is given in terms of another complex number z. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that z is equal to 1 + i. I remember that i is the imaginary unit, where i\u00b2 = -1. So, z is a complex number with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of 1.\n\nNext, w is given by the expression (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). So, w = (3z + 1)/(5z + 7). My goal is to find the modulus of w, denoted as |w|.\n\nI recall that the modulus of a complex number a + bi is calculated as the square root of (a squared plus b squared). So, |a + bi| = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). That formula should help me once I have w in a more manageable form.\n\nBut before I can find |w|, I need to simplify the expression for w. Since both the numerator and the denominator are complex expressions involving z, I should probably substitute z = 1 + i into that expression and simplify.\n\nLet me write out the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: 3z + 1. Since z = 1 + i, substituting that in gives 3*(1 + i) + 1. Let me compute that:\n\n3*(1) + 3*(i) + 1 = 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i.\n\nDenominator: 5z + 7. Again, substitute z = 1 + i:\n\n5*(1) + 5*(i) + 7 = 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i.\n\nSo, now w is equal to (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). Hmm, that's a complex fraction. I think I need to rationalize the denominator to make this expression easier to work with, especially when taking the modulus.\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. The complex conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i. So, let's do that.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (12 -"

            "output": " 5i):\n\nw = [(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i)] / [(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)].\n\nAlright, now I need to carry out these multiplications. Let me start with the numerator.\n\nFirst, the numerator: (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i). I can expand this using the distributive property, or the FOIL method for binomials.\n\nFOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last.\n\nFirst: 4*12 = 48.\n\nOuter: 4*(-5i) = -20i.\n\nInner: 3i*12 = 36i.\n\nLast: 3i*(-5i) = -15i\u00b2.\n\nSo, combining these, the numerator becomes:\n\n48 - 20i + 36i -15i\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms.\n\nThe real parts are 48 and -15i\u00b2. Wait, i\u00b2 is -1, so -15i\u00b2 is actually +15.\n\nSo, the real part is 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nThe imaginary parts are -20i + 36i = 16i.\n\nTherefore, the numerator simplifies to 63 + 16i.\n\nNow, onto the denominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i). This is a product of a binomial and its conjugate, so it should be a difference of squares.\n\nUsing the formula (a + b)(a - b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, so here, a is 12 and b is 5i.\n\nSo, 12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2 = 144 - 25i\u00b2.\n\nAgain, i\u00b2 = -1, so this becomes 144 - 25*(-1) = 144 + 25 = 169.\n\nSo, the denominator is 169, which is a real number.\n\nPutting it all together, w = (63 + 16i)/169.\n\nNow, to find |w|, which is the modulus of this complex number. The modulus is the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.\n\nSo, the real part is 63/169, and the imaginary part is 16/169.\n\nThus, |w| = \u221a[(63/169)\u00b2 + (16/169)\u00b2].\n\nLet me compute each term inside the square root.\n\n"

So, (63/169)\u00b2 = 3969/(169\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, 16 squared is 256, so (16/169)\u00b2 = 256/(169\u00b2).\n\nAdding these together: 3969 + 256 = 4225. Therefore, the sum becomes 4225/(169\u00b2).\n\nSo, |w| = \u221a[4225/(169\u00b2)].\n\nNow, 4225 is 65 squared because 65*65 = 4225. And 169 is 13 squared, so 169\u00b2 is (13\u00b2)\u00b2 = 13\u2074.\n\nWait, let me check: 169\u00b2 is 28561, and 4225 is 65\u00b2, which is correct.\n\nSo, \u221a[4225/(169\u00b2)] = \u221a4225 / \u221a(169\u00b2) = 65 / 169.\n\nNow, 65 and 169 can both be divided by 13. Let's see: 65 \u00f713 = 5, and 169 \u00f713 = 13. So, 65/169 simplifies to 5/13.\n\nTherefore, |w| is 5/13.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting from the beginning: z = 1 + i. So, 3z +1 is 3*(1 + i) +1 = 3 + 3i +1 = 4 +3i. That seems correct.\n\n5z +7 is 5*(1 + i) +7 = 5 +5i +7 =12 +5i. That also looks right.\n\nThen, w = (4 +3i)/(12 +5i). Multiply numerator and denominator by 12 -5i.\n\nNumerator: (4)(12) + 4*(-5i) + 3i*12 + 3i*(-5i) =48 -20i +36i -15i\u00b2.\n\nSimplifying: 48 +15 (since -15i\u00b2 is +15) and -20i +36i =16i. So numerator is 63 +16i. That's correct.\n\nDenominator: (12 +5i)(12 -5i) =12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2 =144 -25i\u00b2 =144"
