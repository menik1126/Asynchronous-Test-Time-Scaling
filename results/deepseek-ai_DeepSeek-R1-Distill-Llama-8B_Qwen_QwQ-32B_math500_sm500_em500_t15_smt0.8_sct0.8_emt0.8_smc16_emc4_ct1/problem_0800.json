            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a polynomial with integer coefficients. Let me try to parse it step by step. The polynomial is given by:\n\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\n\nThey mention that it has integer coefficients, and all its roots are distinct integers. Also, we're told that the leading coefficient \\( a_n = 2 \\), and the constant term \\( a_0 = 66 \\). The question is asking for the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So this is a monic polynomial if we consider \\( a_n = 2 \\), which actually means it's not monic but has a leading coefficient of 2. Since all roots are distinct integers, we can express the polynomial as a product of linear factors with integer roots. Let's write that down.\n\nIf all roots are distinct integers, let's say the roots are \\( r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\), each an integer, and all different. Then the polynomial can be written as:\n\n$$f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n)$$\n\nExpanding this, the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is equal to \\( 2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n \\). We are told that \\( a_0 = 66 \\), so:\n\n$$2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 66$$\n\nWhich means:\n\n$$(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 33$$\n\nSo, the product of the roots times \\( (-1)^n \\) is 33. Since 33 factors into prime numbers as \\( 3 \\times 11 \\). So, the roots must be factors of 33. But considering that the roots are distinct integers, both positive and negative.\n\nOur goal is to choose roots such that their product is 33 (or -33, depending on \\( n \\)), and then when we expand the polynomial, \\( a_{n-1} \\) will be related to the sum of the roots. In the expansion, \\( a_{n-"

Wait, let's recall Vieta's formula.\n\nVieta's formula tells us that for a polynomial:\n\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0$$\n\nThe coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) is equal to \\( (-1)^{1} a_n \\) times the sum of the roots. So:\n\n$$a_{n-1} = -a_n (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n)$$\n\nSince \\( a_n = 2 \\), this simplifies to:\n\n$$a_{n-1} = -2(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n)$$\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of \\( a_{n-1} \\) is:\n\n$$|a_{n-1}| = 2|r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n|$$\n\nSo, our task reduces to finding a set of distinct integers whose product is 33 (or -33, depending on the number of roots) and whose sum is as close to zero as possible, so that the absolute value of that sum is minimized. Because then, when we multiply by 2, we get the smallest possible |a_{n-1}|.\n\nSo, first, let's consider the possible factorizations of 33 into distinct integers.\n\n33 factors into prime factors as \\( 3 \\times 11 \\). So, the possible integer roots must be divisors of 33, both positive and negative. So, possible roots are \\( \\pm1, \\pm3, \\pm11, \\pm33 \\).\n\nBut since we're looking for distinct roots, we can't repeat any of these. So, we need to factor 33 into distinct integers, possibly including negative numbers because \\( (-1)^n \\times \\) (product of roots) is 33. So, depending on the number of roots, the product could be 33 or -33. Let's see.\n\nWait, but 33 can be written as a product of integers in different ways, for example, 1×3×11, or 1×(-1)×(-3)×11, etc. So, we"

The key is that the product of the roots (times (-1)^n) must be 33, so the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. Hmm, but actually, the equation is:\n\n\\( (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 33 \\)\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots is \\( (-1)^n \\times 33 \\). So, if n is even, then the product of the roots is 33, and if n is odd, it's -33. But since the roots can be positive or negative, maybe we can adjust the signs to get the product to be either 33 or -33. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the product of the roots (without considering the sign from Vieta's formula) as 33 or -33, but since the roots can be negative, we can choose the signs to get the desired product.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of the product of the roots (without the leading coefficient) as 33 or -33, but since the leading coefficient is 2, the actual product of the roots is (a0 / leading coefficient) * (-1)^n. Wait, let me check Vieta again.\n\nWait, Vieta's formula for monic polynomials: the product of the roots is (-1)^n * a0. But here, the polynomial is not monic, it's 2 times a monic polynomial. So, the product of the roots is (a0 / a_n) * (-1)^n. Wait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose the polynomial is written as 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Then expanding this, the constant term is 2*(-r1)*(-r2)*...*(-rn) = 2*(-1)^n (r1 r2 ... rn). So, the constant term a0 is equal to 2*(-1)^n (product of roots). Therefore, the product of the roots is (a0)/(2*(-1)^n). Since a0 is 66, so:\n\nproduct of roots = 66 / (2*(-1)^n) = 33 / (-1)^n.\n\nTherefore, the"

So, the actual product is either 33 or -33. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, the product is 33 or -33, respectively.\n\nBut, since the roots can be positive or negative, we can choose the roots accordingly.\n\nSo, for example, if n is even, then the product of the roots is 33, so the roots have to be all positive or an even number of them negative. Similarly, if n is odd, then the product is -33, so the roots have to be an odd number of negative numbers.\n\nBut perhaps I should instead not worry about n, because we can choose the number of roots, n. Hmm, but wait, n is determined by how many distinct integer roots we can get from the factors of 33. So, 33 has prime factors 3 and 11, so the minimal n is 2 (since 3*11=33, so two roots, 3 and 11).

The other pairs would have product -33, which would require n being odd, but n=2 is even, so those are invalid for n=2.\n\nWait, but actually, the product of roots is 33 or -33 depending on n. So, if n is even, product is 33, so the pairs with product 33 are valid. If n is odd, then product is -33, so pairs with product -33 would be valid. But since n is the number of roots, so for n=2, even, product must be 33. For n=3, odd, product must be -33, etc.\n\nTherefore, for each possible n, we can have different factorizations. Since the problem doesn't specify n, we can choose n as needed to minimize |a_{n-1}|. So, perhaps the minimal |a_{n-1}| is achieved with a higher n, so that the roots can be spread out more, leading to a smaller sum?\n\nWait, but the more roots we have, the more terms in the sum, so maybe the sum can be smaller?
