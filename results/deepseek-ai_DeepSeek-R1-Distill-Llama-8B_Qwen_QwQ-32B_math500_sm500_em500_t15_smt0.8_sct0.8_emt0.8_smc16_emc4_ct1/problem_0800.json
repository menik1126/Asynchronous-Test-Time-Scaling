            "output": "Okay, so I have this polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients. It's given that the leading coefficient a_n is 2 and the constant term a_0 is 66. The roots of this polynomial are distinct integers. I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and integer roots, by the Integer Root Theorem, the possible roots are divisors of the constant term, which is 66. The divisors of 66 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, and ±66. So, the roots must be among these integers.\n\nNow, since the polynomial is of degree n, it will have n roots (some possibly repeated, but in this case, they are distinct). The polynomial can be written in factored form as:\n$$f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n)$$\nwhere each r_i is a distinct integer from the list of divisors of 66.\n\nThe expansion of this polynomial will give me the coefficients. Specifically, the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to -2 times the sum of the roots. This comes from the fact that the coefficient of x^{n-1} in the expansion is - (sum of roots) multiplied by the leading coefficient.\n\nSo, to find a_{n-1}, I need to calculate:\n$$a_{n-1} = -2(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n)$$\nTherefore, I need to choose n distinct divisors of 66 such that when I sum them and multiply by -2, the absolute value |a_{n-1}| is minimized.\n\nMy goal is to minimize |a_{n-1}|, which is the same as minimizing |sum of roots|. Since a_{n-1} is multiplied by -2, the sign can vary, but the magnitude depends on the sum.\n\nSo, I need to find a set of n distinct divisors of 66 whose sum is as close to zero as possible. Because the closer the sum is to zero, the smaller |a_{n-1}| will be.\n\nWait, but which n are we talking about? The problem doesn't specify the degree n of the polynomial. Hmm, maybe"

Because the polynomial is monic (leading coefficient 2), but not necessarily monic because it's not specified as monic. Wait, actually, the leading coefficient is 2, so it's not monic. The roots would then be such that when you factor out, the leading coefficient is 2. So, perhaps f(x) can be written as 2 times a monic polynomial with integer roots? Because if the roots are integers, you can factor out a 2.\n\nWait, that might not necessarily be the case. For example, if 2 is a root, then (x - 2) is a factor, but if not, it might require the constant term to be even because all the roots would have to multiply to 66, which is even, so at least one root is even. Therefore, 2 has to be involved somehow in the factors.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think about the polynomial as 2 times a monic polynomial with integer roots. So, let's denote g(x) = f(x)/2, so g(x) is a monic polynomial with integer roots. Then, the roots of g(x) are r_1/2, r_2/2, ..., r_n/2, but since the roots of f(x) are integers, the roots of g(x) must be half-integers or integers. But since g(x) has integer coefficients, the roots must be either integers or half-integers. Wait, but actually, if f(x) has integer roots, then f(x) factors into integer factors, so each root is an integer. Therefore, g(x) must also have integer roots. Because if you divide f(x) by 2, which is an integer, and f(x) has integer roots, then g(x) would have roots at those same integer points. So, actually, g(x) must have integer roots as well. Therefore, the integer roots of f(x) must divide 66, as before.\n\nWait, but if g(x) is monic with integer roots, then g(x) = (x - s_1)(x - s_2)...(x - s_n), where each s_i is an integer. Therefore, f(x) = 2g(x) = 2(x - s_1)(x - s_2)...("

Therefore, the product of the roots s_1 s_2 ... s_n must be ±33. Wait, but 33 is 3*11, so the product of the roots must be 33 or -33. Hmm, but 33 is a factor here. Wait, but the roots are integers, so their product must be ±33. But 33 factors into primes as 3 and 11, so the roots must multiply to 33 or -33. But the roots are distinct integers, so we need to choose distinct integers whose product is ±33.

So, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33.\n\nSo, the product of the roots is 33 or -33, and the roots are distinct integers. So, I need to pick n distinct integers whose product is ±33, and their sum should be as close to zero as possible to minimize |a_{n-1}|, which is 2 times the negative of their sum.\n\nWait, because earlier, I thought that a_{n-1} is -2 times the sum of the roots. So, if I can make the sum of the roots as close to zero as possible, that would minimize |a_{n-1}|.\n\nSo, the strategy is: choose n distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33, and make their sum as close to zero as possible.\n\nSince 33 has a small number of factors, maybe it's better to try with the minimal possible n, starting from n=1 upwards, but n has to be at least 1, but n can't be too large because the product is limited to 33 or -33.\n\nWait, but the number of roots n has to be such that when multiplied together, they give 33 or -33. So, let's consider possible factorizations of 33 into distinct integers.\n\n33 factors as 1×3×11. So, the minimal number of roots is 3, but since the roots have to be distinct, 3 is the minimal degree.\n\nWait, but wait, 33 can be written as (-1) × (-3) × 11, or other combinations.
