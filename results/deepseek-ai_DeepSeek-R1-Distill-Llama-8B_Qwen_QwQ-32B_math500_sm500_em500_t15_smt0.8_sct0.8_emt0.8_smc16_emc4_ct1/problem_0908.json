            "output": "First, I recognize that to convert the fraction to a terminating decimal, I need to determine its prime factorization. The denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\), which is already in its prime form.\n\nNext, I'll express the fraction as \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\). To make the denominator a power of 10, I'll balance the powers of 2 and 5 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^{(7 - 2)} = 2^5\\). This gives me \\(\\frac{21 \\cdot 2^5}{10^7}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(21 \\cdot 2^5\\) results in 672. Therefore, the fraction becomes \\(\\frac{672}{10^7}\\).\n\nFinally, I'll divide 672 by \\(10^7\\) to find the decimal representation. This yields a terminating decimal of 0.0000672.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of the Denominator**:\n   The denominator is already in its prime factorized form:\n   \\[\n   2^2 \\cdot 5^7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Balancing the Powers of 2 and 5**:\n   To convert the denominator to a power of 10 (\\(10^n = 2^n \\cdot 5^n\\)), we need to balance the powers of 2 and 5. Here, the power of 2 is 2 and the power of 5 is 7. Therefore, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^{(7-2)} = 2^5\\) to balance the powers:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} \\times \\frac{2^5}{2^5} = \\frac{21 \\cdot 2^5}{10^7}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate \\(21 \\cdot 2^5\\)**:\n   \\[\n   21 \\cdot 2^5 = 21 \\cdot 32 = 672\n   \\]\n   So, the fraction becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{672}{10^7}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to Decimal**"
