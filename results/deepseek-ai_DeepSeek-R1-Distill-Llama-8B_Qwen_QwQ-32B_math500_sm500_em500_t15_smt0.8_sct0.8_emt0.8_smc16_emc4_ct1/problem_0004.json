            "output": "Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a monic polynomial P(x) of degree 3. The problem states that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). And when it's divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Also, we know that P(0) = 5. The goal is to find P(5).\n\nFirst, let's break down what we know. P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3, so it should look like P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants we need to find. But maybe there's a smarter way than just plugging in values.\n\nSince P(x) has a remainder R(x) when divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), that means R(x) is the value of P(x) evaluated at x = 1 and x = 4. Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x), so 2R(x) must be the value of P(x) evaluated at x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nLet me write that down more formally. \n\nWhen P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So, by the Remainder Theorem, R(1) = P(1) and R(4) = P(4).\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So, by the Remainder Theorem again, 2R(2) = P(2) and 2R(3) = P(3).\n\nSo, we have R(1) = P(1), R(4) = P(4), R(2) = P(2)/2, and R(3) = P(3)/2.\n\nNow, R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4). Since P(x) is a cubic polynomial and (x - 1)(x - 4) is quadratic, the remainder R(x) must be linear, right? So R(x)"

So, 2R(x) must be linear too, and since 2R(x) is twice a linear function, it's still linear. Let me check: if R(x) is mx + n, then 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n, which is also linear. So that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's note the equations we can set up.\n\nFirst, since R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), we have:\n\nP(1) = R(1)\nP(4) = R(4)\n\nBut R(1) = m*1 + n = m + n\n\nSimilarly, R(4) = m*4 + n = 4m + n\n\nSo, equations:\n\n1) P(1) = m + n\n2) P(4) = 4m + n\n\nSimilarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So:\n\nP(2) = 2R(2)\nP(3) = 2R(3)\n\nAnd R(2) = 2m + n\n\nR(3) = 3m + n\n\nThus:\n\n3) P(2) = 2*(2m + n) = 4m + 2n\n4) P(3) = 2*(3m + n) = 6m + 2n\n\nAlso, we know that P(0) = 5. Since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, it can be written as P(x) = x³ + a x² + b x + c. Therefore, P(0) = c = 5. So c = 5.\n\nSo, now, let's write down the equations.\n\nWe have four equations from above:\n\n1) P(1) = m + n\n2) P(4) = 4m + n\n3) P(2) = 4m + 2n\n4) P(3) = 6m + 2n\n\nAdditionally, we"
