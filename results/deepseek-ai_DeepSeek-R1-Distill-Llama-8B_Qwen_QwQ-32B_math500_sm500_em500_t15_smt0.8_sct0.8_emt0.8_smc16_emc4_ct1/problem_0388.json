            "output": "First, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = πr²h. The problem states that the volume is 45π cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll plug in the known values into the formula. I know that the volume V is 45π cm³, and the radius r provided is 3 cm. \n\nBy substituting these values into the volume formula, I get 45π = π(3)²h. Simplifying π(3)² gives me 9π, so the equation becomes 45π = 9πh.\n\nTo solve for h, I'll divide both sides of the equation by π. This simplifies the equation to 45 = 9h.\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides by 9 to isolate h, which gives me h = 5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the height (\\( h \\)) of the cylinder given its volume and radius, we'll use the **Volume formula for a cylinder**:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius,\n- \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n**Given:**\n- Volume (\\( V \\)) = \\( 45\\pi \\) cm³\n- Radius (\\( r \\)) = 3 cm\n\n**Step 1:** Plug the known values into the volume formula.\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation by calculating \\( 3^2 \\).\n\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi \\times 9 \\times h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\pi \\) to cancel it out.\n\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
