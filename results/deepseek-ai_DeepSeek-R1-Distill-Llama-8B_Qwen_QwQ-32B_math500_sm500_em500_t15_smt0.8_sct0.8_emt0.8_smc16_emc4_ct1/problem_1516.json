            "output": "To determine the number of possible license plates, I'll break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the letter part of the license plate. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and each license plate requires two different letters. Since the order of the letters matters and they must be distinct, I'll use permutations for the first position and then arrange the remaining letters for the second position.\n\nNext, I'll address the numerical part of the license plate. Each digit can be any number from 0 to 9, making 10 possible choices for each digit. However, the problem states that the two digits must be different. Therefore, I'll calculate the number of arrangements by choosing one digit out of ten and then selecting the next distinct digit from the remaining nine.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of possible license plates, I'll multiply the number of combinations for the letters by the number of combinations for the digits. This will give the complete count of unique license plates that can be formed under the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of combinations for the letters:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.\n   - Since the two letters must be different and the order matters, we use permutations.\n   - The number of ways to choose and arrange 2 different letters is:\n     \\[\n     P(26, 2) = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of combinations for the digits:**\n   - There are 10 possible digits (0 through 9).\n   - The two digits must be different and the order matters, so we also use permutations.\n   - The number of ways to choose and arrange 2 different digits is:\n     \\[\n     P(10, 2) = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of license plates:**\n   - Multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations:\n     \\[\n     650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
