            "output": "To determine the number of possible license plates, we'll start by analyzing the structure of the license plate, which consists of two different letters followed by two different one-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, for the letters, there are 26 possible choices for each letter, and since the two letters must be different, we'll use the multiplication principle. This means the total number of combinations for the letters is 26 multiplied by 25, which equals 650.\n\nNext, for the numbers, there are 10 possible choices for each digit, and similar to the letters, the two digits must be different. Applying the multiplication principle again, the total number of combinations for the numbers is 10 multiplied by 9, resulting in 90.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of possible license plates, we'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations. Multiplying 650 by 90 gives us 58,500 possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, follow these step-by-step calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of possible combinations for the letters:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet (A-Z).\n   - Since the two letters must be different, the number of ways to choose the first letter is 26, and for the second letter, there are 25 remaining choices.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total letter combinations} = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of possible combinations for the digits:**\n   - There are 10 digits (0-9).\n   - The two digits must be different, so the first digit has 10 possible choices, and the second digit has 9 remaining choices.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total digit combinations} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of possible license plates:**\n   - Multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total license plates} = 650 \\times 90 = 58,\\!500\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{58500}\n\\]"
