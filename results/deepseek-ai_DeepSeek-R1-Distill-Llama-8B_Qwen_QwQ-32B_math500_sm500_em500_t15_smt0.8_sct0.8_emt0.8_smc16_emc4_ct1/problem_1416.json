Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = πr²h, I can calculate the volume by plugging in the given values.\n\nNext, I need to find the volume of the spherical tank. The tank has a radius of 6 cm. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. By substituting the radius into this formula, I can calculate the total volume of the spherical tank.\n\nAfter determining the volume of both the cylindrical beakers and the spherical tank, I will divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker to find out how many beakers are needed to fill it completely. This will give me the number of beakers required to fill the tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n   Given:\n   - Height (\\( h \\)) = 8 cm\n   - Radius (\\( r \\)) = 3 cm\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Given:\n   - Radius (\\( R \\)) = 6 cm\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Beakers Needed**\n   \n   To find how many beakers are needed to fill the"
