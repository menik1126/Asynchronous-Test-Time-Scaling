With a radius of 6 cm, the volume becomes:\n(4/3)π(6)³ = (4/3)π(216) = 288π cm³.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h. Given the beaker's height of 8 cm and radius of 3 cm, the volume is:\nπ(3)²(8) = 72π cm³.\n\nFinally, to find out how many beakers are needed, I'll divide the total volume of the sphere by the volume of one cylinder:\n288π / 72π = 4.\n\nTherefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers of water to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine how many cylindrical beakers, each with a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm, are required to fill a spherical tank with a radius of 6 cm.\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank:**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\n   \\]\n   Given the radius \\( r = 6 \\) cm,\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\ \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker:**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Given the radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm and height \\( h = 8 \\) cm,\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\ \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Beakers Needed:**\n\n  "
