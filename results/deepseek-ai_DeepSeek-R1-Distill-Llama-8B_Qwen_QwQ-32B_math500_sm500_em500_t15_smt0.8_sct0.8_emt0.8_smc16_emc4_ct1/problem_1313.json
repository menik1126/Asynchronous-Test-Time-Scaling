We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \\(O\\) than to any of the four vertices.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the rectangle. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, and all angles are right angles. The center \\(O\\) is the intersection point of the diagonals. The ratio \\(AB/AD = k\\) tells us that the rectangle is longer in one direction than the other. If \\(k > 1\\), then \\(AB\\) is longer than \\(AD\\), making it a longer rectangle. If \\(k = 1\\), it's a square, and if \\(k < 1\\), it's a shorter rectangle.\n\nThe problem is about finding the region within the rectangle where any point is closer to \\(O\\) than to any vertex. To do this, I think I need to consider the set of points equidistant from \\(O\\) and each vertex and then find the intersection of the regions closer to \\(O\\) than to each vertex. Essentially, this would form a shape, and the area of this shape divided by the area of the rectangle will give the probability.\n\nLet me recall that the set of points equidistant from two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting them. So, for each vertex, I can draw the perpendicular bisector between \\(O\\) and that vertex. The region closer to \\(O\\) than to the vertex would lie on one side of this bisector.\n\nSince there are four vertices, there will be four such bisectors. The intersection of all the regions closer to \\(O\\) than to any vertex will give the area where the point is closer to \\(O\\) than to any of the four vertices.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates to make it easier. Let's place the center \\(O\\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\). Since it's a rectangle, let me define the lengths. Let’s assume \\(AB = 2a\\) and \\(AD = 2b\\). So, the coordinates of the vertices will be:\n\n- \\(A = (-a, b)\\)\n- \\(B = (a, b)\\)\n- \\(C = (a, -b)\\)\n- \\(D ="

Since \\(a = k \\cdot b\\), substituting gives \\(4kb^2\\). So, the area of the rectangle is \\(4kb^2\\).\n\nNext, let's find the equation of the perpendicular bisector between \\(O\\) and one of the vertices, say \\(A = (-a, b)\\). The perpendicular bisector will consist of all points equidistant from \\(O\\) and \\(A\\). For any point \\((x,y)\\) on this bisector, the distance to \\(O\\) must equal the distance to \\(A\\).
