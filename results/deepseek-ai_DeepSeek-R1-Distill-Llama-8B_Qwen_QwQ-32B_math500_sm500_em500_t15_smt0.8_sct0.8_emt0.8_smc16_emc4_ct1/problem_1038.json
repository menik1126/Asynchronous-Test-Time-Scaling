Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that factoring higher-degree polynomials can sometimes be approached by looking for patterns or substitutions that simplify the expression. The given polynomial is an eighth-degree polynomial, which seems a bit intimidating, but maybe I can rewrite it in a way that makes factoring easier.\n\nLooking at the polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\), I notice that all the exponents of \\( x \\) are even numbers. This makes me think that a substitution might work here. Specifically, if I let \\( y = x^4 \\), then the equation becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). That's a quadratic in terms of \\( y \\), which is easier to handle.\n\nSo, substituting \\( y = x^4 \\), we get:\n\\[ y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, I can try to factor this quadratic equation. Let me think about two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Hmm, 4 and -1 come to mind because \\( 4 \\times (-1) = -4 \\) and \\( 4 + (-1) = 3 \\). So, the quadratic factors as:\n\\[ (y + 4)(y - 1) = 0 \\]\n\nSubstituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), this gives:\n\\[ (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = 0 \\]\n\nWait, but the original equation is \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\), which is equal to zero. So, does this mean that \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) = 0 \\) is the factorization? Well, almost, but I need to check.\n\nWait a second, let me verify. Multiplying \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\) should give me \\( x^8 - x^4 + 4x^4 - 4 \\), which simplifies to \\( x^8 +"

            "output": " 3x^4 - 4 \\). Yes, that's correct! So, the factorization is correct as \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nBut now, the problem states that each non-constant polynomial \\( p_i(x) \\) is monic with integer coefficients and cannot be factored further over the integers. So, I need to factor \\( x^4 - 1 \\) and \\( x^4 + 4 \\) further if possible.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\), I remember that it's a difference of squares. So, it can be factored as:\n\\[ x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - (1)^2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) \\]\n\nThen, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) is another difference of squares, so it factors further:\n\\[ x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1) \\]\n\nPutting it all together, \\( x^4 - 1 \\) factors as:\n\\[ (x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\]\n\nSo, now the factorization of the original polynomial becomes:\n\\[ (x^4 + 4)(x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\]\n\nNow, I need to check if \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored further. Hmm, \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is known as a biquadratic polynomial. I recall that such polynomials can sometimes be factored using special identities. In particular, \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored as a product of two quadratics.\n\nLet me try to factor \\( x^4 + 4 \\). Let's assume it factors as:\n\\[ (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) \\]\nwhere \\( a, b, c, d \\) are integers. Multiplying them out, we get:\n\\[ x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd \\]\n\nComparing coefficients with \\( x^4 + 4 \\), we have:\n1. The coefficient of \\( x^3 \\) is 0"

The constant term is 4, so \\( bd = 4 \\).\n\nSince \\( a + c = 0 \\), then \\( c = -a \\).

Since \\( bd = 4 \\), we'd need two numbers that multiply to 4 and add to 0. The only possibilities are 2 and -2, but 2 * (-2) = -4, not 4. So, this doesn't work. Therefore, \\( a \\) cannot be 0, so \\( d = b \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( d = b \\). Then, from equation 2:\n\\[ b + b = a^2 \\]\n\\[ 2b = a^2 \\]\n\nAnd from equation 4:\n\\[ b * b = 4 \\]\n\\[ b^2 = 4 \\]\nSo, \\( b = 2 \\) or \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nLet me test \\( b = 2 \\).
