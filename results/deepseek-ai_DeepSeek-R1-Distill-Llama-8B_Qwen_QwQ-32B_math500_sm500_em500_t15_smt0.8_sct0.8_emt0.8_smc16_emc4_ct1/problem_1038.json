Then, I have to find the sum of \\(p_i(1)\\) for each of these factors.\n\nFirst, let me write down the polynomial again: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). Hmm, I notice that it's a degree 8 polynomial. That might be a bit tricky, but maybe I can factor it into smaller polynomials. Since it's monic, any factors we get will also be monic. Let me see.\n\nI remember that sometimes higher-degree polynomials can be factored by recognizing patterns or by substituting a variable. Let me try a substitution. If I let \\(y = x^4\\), then the equation becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\\). Is that factorable? Let me check the discriminant: \\(b^2 - 4ac = 9 + 16 = 25\\). So, the roots are \\([-3 \\pm 5]/2\\), which gives 1 and -4. So, that factors as \\(y - 1\\)(y + 4). So, substituting back, \\(y - 1 = x^4 - 1\\), and \\(y + 4 = x^4 + 4\\). So, the original polynomial factors into (x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4). Wait, but the original polynomial is degree 8, and each of those is degree 4, so that's a start.\n\nNow, can I factor \\(x^4 - 1\\) and \\(x^4 + 4\\) further?\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\), which is a difference of squares because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\). So, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Then, each of those can be factored further. \\(x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\\), which are linear factors, so they can't be factored"

So, \\(x^4 - 1\\) factors into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\).\n\nNow, the other factor is \\(x^4 + 4\\). Hmm, that looks like a sum of squares, but \\(x^4\\) is a square of \\(x^2\\), so \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2)^2 + 2^2\\). Wait, but the sum of squares doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over integers? Wait, actually, there's a formula for \\(a^2 + b^2\\) when combined with cross terms. Alternatively, maybe it can be factored as a biquadratic?\n\nAlternatively, I recall that \\(x^4 + 4\\) is a special case called a \"sum of squares\" but actually, it can be factored using the Sophie Germain identity. Let me recall that formula. The identity states that \\(a^4 + 4b^4\\) factors as \\((a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2)\\). Let me check that. Let me set \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = 1\\), so \\(x^4 + 4(1)^4 = (x^2 + 2x*1 + 2*1^2)(x^2 - 2x*1 + 2*1^2)\\). That would be \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Let me multiply those out to check:\n\nFirst, \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\):\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\n\\(x^2 * x^2 = x^4\\)\n\n\\(x^2*(-2x) = -2x^3\\)\n\n\\(x^2*2 = 2x^2\\)\n\n2x * x^2 = 2x^3\n\n2x*(-2x) = -4x^"

Let me think about the substitution again.\n\nI set \\(y =x^4\\), so the equation becomes \\(y^2 +3y -4 =0\\), which has roots at y=1 and y=-4. So, x^4=1 and x^4=-4. Wait a minute, x^4=-4 would result in complex roots, but over the integers, that means that polynomial is irreducible, so that's why \\(x^4 +4\\) can't be factored into quadratics with integer coefficients. So, yeah, that's why we used Sophie Germain's identity to factor it.\n\nAlternatively, another approach might be to factor the original equation as a product of quadratics. Let me try that for thoroughness.\n\nAssume that \\(x^8 +3x^4 -4\\) factors as a product of four quadratics:\n\n\\[(x^2 +a x + b)(x^2 +c x + d)(x^2 +e x + f)(x^2 +g x + h)\\].

Then, \\(x^4 +4\\) into the two quadratics, correct.\n\nThus, the total factors are as I listed. So, each evaluated at x=1 gives the numbers as computed.

This substitution gives us the quadratic equation \\(y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\\), which factors as \\((y - 1)(y + 4)\\). Substituting back, we get \\(x^4 - 1\\)"
