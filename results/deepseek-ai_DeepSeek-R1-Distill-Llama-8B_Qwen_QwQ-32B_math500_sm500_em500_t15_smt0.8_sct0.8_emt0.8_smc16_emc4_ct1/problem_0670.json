            "output": "First, I'll define variables to represent the weights of each item based on the given relationships.\n\nLet T represent the weight of a treek, S for a squig, and G for a goolee.\n\nFrom the first statement, I know that 10 treeks weigh as much as 3 squigs and 1 goolee. So, 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says that 2 treeks and 1 goolee equal the weight of 1 squig: 2T + G = S.\n\nWith these equations, I can set up a system to solve for T, S, and G.\n\nFirst, I'll substitute S from the second equation into the first equation to eliminate S. This gives me 10T = 3(2T + G) + G, which simplifies to 10T = 6T + 3G + G, and further to 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nNext, I'll isolate G by subtracting 6T from both sides: 4T = 4G, so G = T.\n\nNow that I know G equals T, I'll substitute back into the second equation to find S: 2T + T = S, so S = 3T.\n\nFinally, to find how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, I'll divide S by T: S = 3T means 1 squig equals 3 treeks.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( T \\) represent the weight of **one treek**.\n   - Let \\( S \\) represent the weight of **one squig**.\n   - Let \\( G \\) represent the weight of **one goolee**.\n\n2. **Translate the Statements into Equations:**\n   \n   - **First Statement:**  \n     Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.  \n     \\[\n     10T = 3S + G\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Second Statement:**  \n     Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.  \n     \\[\n     2T + G = S\n     \\]\n\n3. **Express \\( S \\) in Terms of \\( T \\) and \\( G \\):**  \n  "
