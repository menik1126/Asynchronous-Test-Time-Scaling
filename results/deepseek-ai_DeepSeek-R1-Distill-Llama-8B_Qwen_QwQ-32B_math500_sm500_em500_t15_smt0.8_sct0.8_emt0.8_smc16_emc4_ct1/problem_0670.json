            "output": "First, I'll define the variables for clarity. Let\u2019s denote the weight of a treek as T, a squig as S, and a goolee as G.\n\nThe first statement says that ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. So, I can write the equation as:\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement tells me that two treeks and one goolee are equal to the weight of one squig. This gives me a second equation:\n2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I can substitute the expression for S from the second equation into the first equation. Replacing S with (2T + G) in the first equation:\n10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nNext, I'll expand and simplify this equation:\n10T = 6T + 3G + G,\n10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides:\n4T = 4G.\n\nDividing both sides by 4 gives:\nT = G.\n\nThis means that one treek weighs the same as one goolee.\n\nNow, using the second equation again, 2T + G = S, and since T = G:\n2T + T = S,\n3T = S.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig. So, three treeks would equal one squig in weight.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1.
