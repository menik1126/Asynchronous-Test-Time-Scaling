Since the table is square, rotations of the seating are considered equivalent, which means I need to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nFirst, if there were no rotational symmetry considerations, the number of ways to seat 8 people around the table would be the number of permutations of 8 distinct objects, which is 8! (8 factorial). However, because rotations that result in the same seating arrangement are considered identical, I must adjust for this overcounting.\n\nNext, I'll recognize that a square table has rotational symmetry of order 4, meaning there are 4 distinct orientations of the table (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°). This implies that each unique seating arrangement is counted 4 times in the total permutations.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of distinct seating arrangements, I'll divide the total permutations by 4. This approach ensures that we're not overcounting configurations that can be rotated into each other.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we need to account for rotational symmetry.\n\n1. **Understand the Table's Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - A square table has 4 sides, so it has rotational symmetry of order 4. This means that rotating the table by 90°, 180°, 270°, or 360° results in the same configuration.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Permutations Without Considering Symmetry:**\n   - If there were no rotational symmetry, the number of ways to seat 8 people around the table would be:\n     \\[\n     8! = 40320\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Adjust for Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - Since each unique seating arrangement is counted 4 times (once for each rotational position), we divide the total permutations by 4 to account for this overcounting.\n     \\[\n     \\frac{8!}{4} = \\frac{40320}{4} = 10080\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{10080}\n\\]"
