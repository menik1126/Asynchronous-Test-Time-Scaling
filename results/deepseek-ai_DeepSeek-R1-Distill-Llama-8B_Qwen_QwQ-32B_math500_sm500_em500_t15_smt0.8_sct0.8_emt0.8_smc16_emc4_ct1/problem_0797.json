I'll denote the first term as \\( a \\) and the common difference as \\( d \\).\n\nThe fourth term of the sequence can be expressed as:\n\\( a_4 = a + 3d = 200 \\).\n\nSimilarly, the eighth term is:\n\\( a_8 = a + 7d = 500 \\).\n\nNext, I'll set up a system of equations using these two expressions:\n1. \\( a + 3d = 200 \\)\n2. \\( a + 7d = 500 \\)\n\nTo find the value of \\( d \\), I'll subtract the first equation from the second:\n\\( (a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200 \\)\nThis simplifies to:\n\\( 4d = 300 \\), so \\( d = 75 \\).\n\nNow that I have the common difference, I'll solve for \\( a \\) using the first equation:\n\\( a + 3(75) = 200 \\)\n\\( a + 225 = 200 \\)\n\\( a = 200 - 225 \\)\n\\( a = -25 \\).\n\nWith both \\( a \\) and \\( d \\) known, I can now find the sixth term:\n\\( a_6 = a + 5d = -25 + 5(75) \\)\n\\( a_6 = -25 + 375 \\)\n\\( a_6 = 350 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence is 350.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Terms:**\n   - Let \\( a \\) be the first term.\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the common difference.\n\n2. **Express the Given Terms:**\n   - Fourth term: \\( a_4 = a + 3d = 200 \\)\n   - Eighth term: \\( a_8 = a + 7d = 500 \\)\n\n3. **Set Up the Equations:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   a + 3d = 200 \\quad \\text{(1)} \\\\\n   a + 7d = 500 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract"
