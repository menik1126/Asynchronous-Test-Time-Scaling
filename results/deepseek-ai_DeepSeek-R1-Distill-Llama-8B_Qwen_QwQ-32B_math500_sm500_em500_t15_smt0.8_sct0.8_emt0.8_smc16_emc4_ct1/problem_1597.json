Let me try to figure out how to approach it.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with cubic equations, sometimes expanding them can help simplify the problem. Other times, there might be a clever substitution or factoring trick. Let me see if I can spot anything here.\n\nLooking at the right side, I notice that \\(2x - 10\\) can be factored as \\(2(x - 5)\\). That might be useful later on. I wonder if there's a relationship between the left-hand side and the right side that can be exploited.\n\nMaybe if I set each term on the left equal to some multiple of the term on the right? Or perhaps there's a way to factor the entire equation. Let me try expanding both sides and see what happens.\n\nStarting with the left side: \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3\\). I recall that \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\), so perhaps I can use that identity here. Let me set \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\).\n\nSo, \\(a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\\). Interesting, that's exactly the term on the right side. So, the left side can be factored as \\((2x - 10)((x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2)\\).\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n(2x - 10)\\left[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2\\right] = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, I can factor out \\(2x - 10\\) on both sides. Let me subtract the right side from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\\[\n(2x - 10)\\left[(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7"

This means either \\(2x - 10 = 0\\) or the other factor equals zero.\n\nFirst, let's solve \\(2x - 10 = 0\\):\n\\[\n2x = 10 \\implies x = 5\n\\]\nSo, \\(x = 5\\) is one root. Good.\n\nNow, we need to solve the remaining equation:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 - (2x - 10)^2 = 0\n\\]\nLet me expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((x - 3)^2\\):\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\n\\]\nNext, expand \\((x - 3)(x - 7)\\):\n\\[\n(x - 3)(x - 7) = x^2 - 10x + 21\n\\]\nThen, expand \\((x - 7)^2\\):\n\\[\n(x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49\n\\]\nAnd finally, expand \\((2x - 10)^2\\):\n\\[\n(2x - 10)^2 = 4x^2 - 40x + 100\n\\]\nNow, plugging these back into the equation:\n\\[\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49) - (4x^2 - 40x + 100) = 0\n\\]\nLet me distribute the negative signs:\n\\[\nx^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 10x - 21 + x^2 - 14x + 49 - 4x^2 + 40"

Let me factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it factors.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 21 and add up to -10. Hmm, factors of 21: 1 and 21, 3 and 7. Since the middle term is -10x, and the constant term is positive, both numbers should be negative. So, -3 and -7: (-3) * (-7) = 21 and (-3) + (-7) = -10. Perfect.\n\nSo, the equation factors as:\n\\[\n(x - 3)(x - 7) = 0\n\\]\nTherefore, the solutions are \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = 7\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify if these solutions actually satisfy the original equation, because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially after factoring and simplifying, we might introduce extraneous solutions or sometimes the steps can be reversible.\n\nLet's check \\(x = 5\\) first:\nLeft side: \\((5 - 3)^3 + (5 - 7)^3 = 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0\\)\nRight side: \\((2*5 - 10)^3 = (10 - 10)^3 = 0^3 = 0\\)\nSo, both sides are equal, \\(x = 5"

Wait, for \\(x = 3\\): left side is \\(-64\\), right side is \\(-64\\). So, that's correct.

I thought the equation was set to \\((2x -10)^3\\), so the right side is a cube, which can sometimes have only one real root, but since we ended up with three real roots, that makes sense because the equation was manipulated and also we factored it correctly.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the roots are \\(3\\), \\(5\\), and \\(7\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe roots are \\boxed{3}, \\boxed{5}, and \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the roots of the equation \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\), we start by recognizing that \\(2x - 10\\) can be factored as \\(2(x - 5)\\). \n\n"
