Let me try to rewrite it step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that both sides have a similar structure. The left side has two cubes being added, and the right side is a single cube. Maybe there's a way to factor this or substitute something in. Wait, let me look at the terms. The terms on the left are (x - 3) and (x - 7). If I add those together, (x - 3) + (x - 7) equals 2x - 10. Oh, that's interesting because the right side is (2x - 10)^3. So, the sum of (x - 3) and (x - 7) is equal to 2x - 10. \n\nHmm, I remember that there's an identity for the sum of cubes: a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe I can apply that here. So, let me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 7). Then, the left side becomes a^3 + b^3, which factors to (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). \n\nWe already saw that a + b is 2x - 10, which is exactly the right side of the equation. So, replacing that, we have (2x - 10)(( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 )) = (2x - 10)^3. \n\nNow, I can subtract (2x - 10)^3 from both sides to set the equation to zero: (2x - 10)(( (x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 ) - (2x - 10)^2 ) = 0. \n\nThis gives us two possibilities: either 2x - 10 = 0 or the other factor equals zero. Let's first solve 2x - 10 = 0. Adding 10"

Hmm, maybe I can multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier: 3x^2 -20x +63 = 0.\n\nNow, I can try to factor this quadratic, or use the quadratic formula. Let me see if it factors. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 3*63=189 and add up to -20. Hmm, factors of 189: 1 and 189, 3 and 63, 7 and 27, 9 and 21.\n\nLet's see: 9 and 21. 9 +21=30, which is not 20. Hmm, 7 and 27: 7+27=34. Not 20. 3 and 63: 3+63=66. Hmm, 1 and 189: 1+189=190. Not helpful. Maybe it doesn't factor nicely, so I should use the quadratic formula.\n\nQuadratic formula: x = [20 ± sqrt( (-20)^2 -4*3*63 ) ]/(2*3).\n\nCalculating discriminant: D = 400 - 756 = -356.\n\nWait, that's negative. So sqrt of negative number, which would give complex roots. But the original equation is a cubic, so there should be three roots. We already have x=5 from the first factor. So the other two roots are complex.\n\nBut the problem says \"roots\", which can include complex ones, unless specified otherwise. So, perhaps I should include them.\n\nSo, the other roots are x = [20 ± sqrt(-356)] /6 = [20 ± i*sqrt(356)] /6.\n\nSimplify sqrt(356). Let's factor 356: 4*89, so sqrt(356)=2*sqrt(89). Thus, the roots are (20 ± 2i√89)/6, which simplifies to (10 ± i√89)/3.\n\nSo, the three roots are x=5, x=(10 + i√89)/3, and x=(10 - i√89)/3.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my steps"

Let \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\), so \\(a + b = 2x - 10\\), which is the right side without the cube. \n\nUsing the identity \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\), the left side becomes:\n\\[\n(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\n\\]\nThe equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\nSubtracting \\((2x - 10)^3\\) from both sides and factoring out \\((2x - 10)\\):\n\\[\n(2x - 10)\\left[a^2 - ab + b^2 - (2x - 10)^2\\right] = 0\n\\]\nThis gives two cases:\n1. \\(2x - 10 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 5\\).\n2. \\(a^2 - ab + b^2 - (2x - 10)^2 = 0\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 = (2x - 10)^2\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying both sides:\n\\[\nx^2 - 10x + 37 = 4x^2 - 40x + 100\n\\]\nRearranging terms:\n\\[\n-3x^2 + 30x - 63 = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0\n\\]\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\\[\n(x - 3)(x - 7) = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 3 \\text{ or } x = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the roots of the equation are \\(\\boxed{3}\\),"
