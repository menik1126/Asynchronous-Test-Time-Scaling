            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2}. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that the domain of a function includes all the real numbers x for which the function is defined. Since this function has a square root, the expression inside the square root, which is (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2, must be greater than or equal to zero. Otherwise, we'd be taking the square root of a negative number, which isn't a real number.\n\nSo, I need to solve the inequality:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 ≥ 0\n\nAlright, let me expand both squares to simplify this expression. I think expanding them will make it easier to handle.\n\nFirst, expanding (x - 3)^2:\n\n(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9\n\nNow, expanding (x - 8)^2:\n\n(x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64\n\nSo, subtracting the second expansion from the first:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) ≥ 0\n\nWait, subtraction is distributive, so let me distribute the negative sign inside:\n\nx^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 16x - 64 ≥ 0\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. The x^2 terms: x^2 - x^2 cancels out, that's 0.\n\nNext, the x terms: -6x + 16x is 10x.\n\nThen the constants: 9 - 64 is -55.\n\nSo, the inequality simplifies to:\n\n10x - 55 ≥ 0\n\nHmm, that looks more manageable. Let's solve for x.\n\n10x - 55 ≥ 0\n\nAdding 55 to both sides:\n\n10x ≥ 55\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\nx ≥ 55/10\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx ≥ 5.5\n\nWait, so the expression inside the square root is non-negative when x is greater than or equal to 5.5. Therefore, the domain of g(x) is [5.5,"

            "output": " ∞).\n\nBut the question asks for the smallest real number x in the domain. Since the domain starts at 5.5 and goes to infinity, the smallest x is 5.5.\n\nI should probably write 5.5 as a fraction to be precise. 5.5 is equal to 11/2. So, x = 11/2 is the smallest real number in the domain of g(x).\n\nLet me verify if I did everything correctly. Starting with the inequality:\n\n(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 ≥ 0\n\nExpanding both squares:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 16x + 64) ≥ 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^2 -6x +9 -x^2 +16x -64 ≥ 0\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n10x -55 ≥ 0\n\nYes, that looks right. Then solving 10x -55 ≥ 0, I add 55 to both sides to get 10x ≥ 55, then divide by 10 to get x ≥ 5.5, which is 11/2. So, x must be at least 11/2 for the expression inside the square root to be non-negative. \n\nTherefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 11/2. There's no mistake here because if x were smaller than 11/2, the expression inside the square root would be negative, making g(x) undefined.\n\nJust to double-check, let me plug in x = 5 into the original expression:\n\n(x -3)^2 - (x -8)^2 = (5 - 3)^2 - (5 -8)^2 = 4 - 9 = -5, which is negative. So, sqrt(-5) is undefined, which confirms that x=5 is not in the domain.\n\nIf I plug in x=6:\n\n(6 -3)^2 - (6 -8)^2 = 9 - 4 = 5, which is positive, so sqrt(5) is defined. Thus, x=6 is in the domain, but since 5.5 is smaller, it's the smallest x.\n\nSo, all steps check out. I think I'm confident that 11/2 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x"
