The number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7 is calculated as 7 choose 3, which is 35.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to pick 2 girls out of 4. Using the combination formula again, 4 choose 2 equals 6.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls. Multiplying 35 by 6 gives 210.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can select 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, we'll use combinations. Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls to get the total number of ways:**\n   \\[\n   35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
