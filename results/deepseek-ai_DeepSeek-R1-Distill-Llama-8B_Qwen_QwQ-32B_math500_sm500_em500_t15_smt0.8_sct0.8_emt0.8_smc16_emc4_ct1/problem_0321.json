            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of boys and girls in Mr. Brennan's class. There are 7 boys and 4 girls. The goal is to select 3 boys and 2 girls to form a group presentation. Since the order doesn't matter, this is a combination problem.\n\nTo choose 3 boys out of 7, I'll use the combination formula C(7,3). This gives me the number of ways to select 3 boys from the 7 available.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4 using the combination formula C(4,2).\n\nAfter obtaining both values, I'll multiply them together to find the total number of ways to form the group. This is because for each way of choosing the boys, there are multiple ways to choose the girls.\n\nFinally, the total number of ways is the product of C(7,3) and C(4,2).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll use combinations since the order of selection doesn't matter. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7:**\n   \n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4:**\n   \n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two results to find the total number of ways to form the group:**\n   \n   \\[\n   35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\nSo, there are \\(\\boxed{210}\\) ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation."
