            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the distance between two points (x, y) and the origin (0,0) can be found using the distance formula. The formula is distance = √(x² + y²). So, if I can express y in terms of x, then I can substitute and find the distance as a function of x. Then, I need to find the minimum value of that distance function.\n\nGiven y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), I can substitute this into the distance formula. Let me write that out:\n\nDistance D = √(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² )\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe it's easier to work with the square of the distance to avoid dealing with the square root. So, let's define a function f(x) = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² and then find its minimum value. That makes sense because minimizing f(x) will also minimize D(x), since the square root is a monotonically increasing function.\n\nAlright, let's expand f(x):\n\nf(x) = x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²  \nFirst, square the second term:  \n[(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² = (1/2)(x² - 3)²  \nSo, expanding that:  \n(1/2)(x⁴ - 6x² + 9)  \nWhich is (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + 9/2\n\nNow, plug that back into f(x):  \nf(x) = x² + (1/2)x⁴ - 3x² + 9/2  \nLet's combine like terms:  \nx² - 3x² = -2x²  \nSo, f(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2\n\nHmm, so now I have f(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2. To find the minima, I need to take the derivative of f"

            "output": "(x) with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.\n\nSo, let's compute f'(x):\n\nf'(x) = d/dx [ (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2 ]  \n= (1/2)*4x³ - 4x + 0  \n= 2x³ - 4x\n\nSet f'(x) = 0:  \n2x³ - 4x = 0  \nFactor out 2x:  \n2x(x² - 2) = 0\n\nSo, the critical points are when 2x = 0 or x² - 2 = 0.  \nThat gives x = 0 or x² = 2, hence x = √2 or x = -√2\n\nNow, I need to check which of these points gives the minimum distance. Since the distance function is even (symmetric about the y-axis), the distance from the origin will be the same for x = √2 and x = -√2. So, I can just compute f(x) at x = √2 and see.\n\nLet's compute f(√2):\n\nFirst, x = √2, so x² = 2, and x⁴ = (√2)^4 = (2)^2 = 4.\n\nPlug into f(x):\n\nf(√2) = (1/2)(4) - 2*(2) + 9/2  \n= 2 - 4 + 4.5  \n= 2.5 or 5/2\n\nWait, let me make sure I did the calculations correctly.\n\nWait, (1/2)(4) is 2, right? Then -2*(2) is -4, so 2 -4 is -2, then +9/2 is 4.5. So, -2 +4.5 is 2.5, which is 5/2. So, f(√2) = 5/2.\n\nHmm, is that the minimum? Wait, I should also check the value at x = 0.\n\nAt x = 0, f(0) = 0 + [(1/√2)(0 - 3)]² = [(1/√2)(-3)]² = (9/2) = 4.5, which is 9/2 or"

Therefore, the minimal distance D is sqrt(5/2).\n\nBut the problem says to express it as sqrt(a)/b, where a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Let me see.\n\nsqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(10)/2, because sqrt(5/2) is equal to sqrt(10)/2.\n\nWait, because 5/2 is 10/4, so sqrt(10)/2.\n\nYes, sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nSo, in the form sqrt(a)/b, that's sqrt(10)/2.\n\nSo, a is 10 and b is 2.\n\nNow, check if 10 is square-free. 10 is 2*5, neither of which is square, so yes, it's square-free.\n\nTherefore, a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing f(x) at x = √2.\n\nf(x) = (1/2)x⁴ - 2x² + 9/2  \nAt x = √2, x²=2, x⁴=4.  \nSo, f(√2) = (1/2)(4) - 2*(2) + 9/2  \n= 2 - 4 + 4.5  \n= 2.5, yes.\n\nIs there a possibility of another minimum?

Thus, it is indeed a local minimum.\n\nSince this is the only other critical point besides x =0, and f(√2) is less than f(0), that must be the global minimum.\n\nSo, minimal distance squared is 5/2, so distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10"

The problem says \"the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of y = ...\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution?\n\nWait, let me re-derive f(x):\n\nOriginal distance squared is x² + y². Since y = (1/√2)(x² -3), so y² = (1/2)(x² -3)^2.\n\nTherefore, f(x) = x² + (1/2)(x² -3)^2.\n\nExpanding (x² -3)^2: x^4 -6x² +9. So, (1/2)(x^4 -6x² +9) = (1/2)x^4 -3x² + 9/2.\n\nAdding x² gives: (1/2)x^4 -3x² +9/2 +x² = (1/2)x^4 -2x² +9/2. That's correct.\n\nSo, the derivative is indeed 2x^3 -4x. So critical points at x=0, x= sqrt(2), x=-sqrt(2). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal distance squared is 5/2, so sqrt(5/2). To write sqrt(5/2) as sqrt(a)/b, we can rationalize the denominator:\n\nsqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = sqrt(10)/2. So yes, that's sqrt(10)/2. So a is 10, b is 2, so 10+2=12.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Wait, is there a possibility that the minimal distance occurs at another point?\n\nSuppose I consider the function f(x) = (1/2)x^4 -2x^2 +9/2. Let me see if there are any other critical points. The derivative was 2x^3 -4x, so only three critical points. Since the function is a quartic with positive leading coefficient, it tends to infinity as x approaches ±infinity, so the minimal value is indeed at x"
