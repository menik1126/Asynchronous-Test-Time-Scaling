Then, express that distance as √a/b, where a and b are positive integers, with a square-free, meaning a isn't divisible by any square number bigger than one. Finally, I need to find a + b. \n\nHmm, let's think about how to approach this. The distance from a point (x, y) to the origin (0,0) is given by the distance formula: √(x² + y²). Since the point is on the graph y = (1/√2)(x² - 3), I can substitute that into the distance formula. So, the distance D becomes √[x² + (1/√2)(x² - 3)]². Wait, actually, since y is already squared inside the distance formula, maybe I should simplify that first.\n\nLet me write it out: D = √(x² + [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]²). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify the expression inside the square root. Let's compute [(1/√2)(x² - 3)]² first. That would be (1/2)(x² - 3)². So the distance squared, which is easier to work with, is x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nOkay, so if I let D² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)², then to find the minimum distance, I need to find the minimum of D², which is the same as minimizing D, since the square root is a monotonically increasing function.\n\nSo, let's set up D² = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)². Let me expand that (x² - 3)² term. It should be x^4 - 6x² + 9. So plugging that back in, D² becomes x² + (1/2)(x^4 - 6x² + 9). Let me distribute the 1/2: that's (1/2)x^4 - 3x² + (9/2).\n\nSo now D² = ("

So, let's compute d(D²)/dx.\n\nThe derivative of (1/2)x^4 is 2x^3, right? Because 4*(1/2)x³ is 2x³. Then, the derivative of -3x² is -6x, and the derivative of 9/2 is zero. So, putting it all together, d(D²)/dx = 2x³ - 6x.\n\nSet this equal to zero for critical points: 2x³ - 6x = 0. Let's factor this equation: 2x(x² - 3) = 0. So, either x = 0 or x² = 3, which means x = √3 or x = -√3. \n\nNow, these are the critical points where the function D² could have minima or maxima. Since we are looking for the smallest distance, we need to evaluate D² at these critical points and see which one gives the smallest value.\n\nLet's calculate D² for each x:\n\n1. When x = 0:\n   D² = (1/2)(0)^4 - 3(0)^2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2 = 4.5.\n\n2.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: 9/2 - 9 + 9/2. So 9/2 + 9/2 is 9, minus 9 is 0.\n\nWait, that seems odd. So D² is zero when x = √3? That can't be, because y = (1/√2)("

So D would be √3, which is approximately 1.732.\n\nWait, but if D² is zero that would imply the point is at the origin, but (√3, 0) is not the origin. So maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, let's recalculate D² at x = √3:\n\nx² = 3, so x^4 = (3)^2 = 9.\n\nSo D² = (1/2)(9) - 3*(3) + 9/2.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1/2)(9) is 4.5.\n\n-3*(3) is -9.\n\n+ 9/2 is +4.5.\n\nSo 4.5 -9 +4.5 = (4.5 +4.5) -9 = 9 -9 = 0. Hmm, that's still zero. But that can't be, because the point is (√3, 0), whose distance squared is ( (√3)^2 + 0^2 ) = 3 + 0 = 3, so D² would be 3. Wait, I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the substitution. Let me check:\n\nThe function for D squared is x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)^2. So when x² = 3, then (x² - 3) is zero, so D squared is 3 + (1/2)(0)^2 = 3 + 0 = 3. So D would be √3, which is correct. But in my earlier calculation, I ended up with zero, which must be wrong. So I must have made a mistake in substituting the expression.\n\nWait, when I expanded D² as (1/2)x^4 - 3x² + 9/2, that's correct. So when x² = 3, then x^4 is 9, so (1/2)(9"

Let me re-express D squared again. The original D squared is x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)^2. Let me compute that again when x² = 3:\n\nx² = 3, so (x² -3)^2 = 0, so D squared is 3 + 0 = 3. But when I expanded the expression, I had (1/2)x^4 -3x² + 9/2. Let me plug x² = 3 into that:\n\n(1/2)(3)^2 - 3*(3) + 9/2. Wait, hold on, x^4 is (x²)^2, so if x² is 3, then x^4 is 9. So (1/2)(9) = 4.5, then -3*(3) = -9, and +9/2 = 4.5. So 4.5 -9 +4.5 = 0. But that contradicts the direct substitution. So there must be an error in the expansion.\n\nWait, let me check the expansion again. The original D squared is x² + (1/2)(x² -3)^2. Let me expand (x² -3)^2 first:\n\n(x² -3)^2 = x^4 -6x² +9. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives (1/2)x^4 -3x² + 9/2. Then adding the x² term:\n\nx² + (1/2)x^4 -3x² +9/2 = (1/2)x^4 + (x² -3x²) +9/2 = (1/2)x^4 -2x² +9/2. Wait a second! I think I made a mistake here earlier. The original expansion was wrong. \n\nWait, so the correct expansion is:\n\nD squared = x² + (1/2)(x^4 -6x² +9) = x² + (1/2)x^4 -"

So that was a big mistake. That's why when substituting, I got inconsistent results.\n\nSo the correct expression for D squared is (1/2)x^4 - 2x² +9/2. \n\nNow, let's compute D squared at x = √3, which gives x² = 3, and x^4 = 9. So:\n\n(1/2)(9) -2*(3) +9/2 = 4.5 -6 +4.5 = (4.5 +4.5) -6 = 9 -6 = 3. Which matches the direct substitution, since D squared is 3, so D is √3. So that was a crucial mistake in expansion. Glad I caught that.\n\nNow, so let's go back. The correct derivative is d(D²)/dx = derivative of (1/2)x^4 -2x² +9/2. So that's (2x^3) -4x. So 2x^3 -4x. So setting that to zero: 2x^3 -4x = 0. Factor out 2x: 2x(x² -2) = 0. So x = 0 or x² =2, which gives x = √2 and x = -√2.\n\nSo the critical points are at x = 0, x = √2, x = -√2.\n\nNow, we can compute D squared at each of these to find which gives the minimum.\n\n1. x =0:\n\nD squared = (1/2)(0)^4 -2*(0)^2 +9/2 = 9/2 = 4.5.\n\n2. x = √2:\n\nCompute x² = 2, x^4 = (√2)^4 = (2)^2 =4.\n\nSo D squared = (1/2)(4) -2*(2) +9/2 = 2 -4 +4.5 = (2 -4) +4.5 ="

So D squared is 5/2.\n\nSo comparing the three critical points:\n\nAt x=0, D squared is 9/2 (4.5), at x=±√2, it's 5/2 (2.5). So the minimum is at x=±√2, with D squared =5/2. Therefore, the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2). \n\nWait, but the problem says the minimal distance can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b. Let me see sqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(5)/sqrt(2). But rationalizing the denominator, that would be sqrt(10)/2. Wait, but sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) is equivalent to sqrt(10)/2? Let me check:\n\nsqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(2)/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) = sqrt(10)/2. Yes, so sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. \n\nAlternatively, sqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(10)/2. So in the form sqrt(a)/b, then a is 10 and b is 2. Since 10 is square-free (its prime factors are 2 and 5, neither squared), so a=10 and b=2. Therefore, a + b = 12.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the distance squared is D² = x² + (1/2)(x² -3)^2. Then expanding that gives (1/2)x^4 -2x² +9/2. Taking derivative: 2x³ -4x. Setting to zero gives 2x(x² -2)=0, so critical points at x=0, x=±√2. \n\nAt x=√2, D squared is (1/2)(4) -2*(2) +9/2 = 2 -4 +4.5 = 2.5, which is 5/2."

            "output": " So D is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. So a=10, b=2, a+b=12.\n\nWait, but let me verify if that's correct. Alternatively, when I made the earlier mistake, I thought at x=√3, D squared was zero, which was wrong. But after correcting that mistake, I saw that at x=√2, D squared is 5/2, so D is sqrt(5/2). So that seems correct.\n\nWait, is there another approach to this problem? Maybe using geometry or optimization techniques without calculus?\n\nAnother way could be to recognize that the minimal distance from the origin to the curve y = (1/√2)(x² -3) is the minimal value of sqrt(x² + y²) where y = (1/√2)(x² -3). So substituting, we have y = (1/√2)x² - (3)/√2. So substituting into the distance squared, D² = x² + [(1/√2)x² - 3/√2]^2.\n\nBut that might not be simpler, so maybe sticking with the calculus approach is better.\n\nWait, perhaps using vectors or parametric equations. Hmm, but I think the calculus approach is the most straightforward.\n\nWait, so I think my conclusion is correct. The minimal distance squared is 5/2, so distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2, so a=10, b=2, a+b=12.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check the calculations again.\n\nCompute D squared at x=√2:\n\nx² = 2, so (x² -3) = -1, so y = (1/√2)(-1) = -1/√2. So the point is (√2, -1/√2). The distance squared is (√2)^2 + (-1/√2)^2 = 2 + (1/2) = 2.5, which is 5/2. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, as sqrt(5/2), which is sqrt(10)/2.\n\nHence, a=10, b=2, so a + b =12. Therefore, the answer is 12.\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \\( y = \\frac"
