Specifically, it wants \\(\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r_2}} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r_5}}\\).\n\nFirst, I should recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real number. Also, if \\(r\\) is a root, then its conjugate \\(\\overline{r}\\) is also a root because the coefficients of the polynomial are real. That makes sense since the given equation only has real coefficients.\n\nNext, I think about the equation itself. It's a 10th-degree polynomial, so it should have 10 roots, which are already given as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). That means we can pair each root with its conjugate, so there are 5 pairs in total.\n\nThe expression we need to compute is the sum of the reciprocals of \\(|r_i|^2\\) for \\(i = 1\\) to \\(5\\). So, essentially, I need to find \\(\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\).\n\nHmm, how can I relate this to the polynomial equation? I remember that for reciprocal roots or something like that, but I need to figure out how to tie this into the coefficients.\n\nI recall Vieta's formulas, which relate the sum and products of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial. But here, we have the reciprocals of the magnitudes squared, which aren't directly given by Vieta. Maybe I can manipulate the equation somehow to get expressions involving \\(|r_i|^2\\).\n\nLet me consider the equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Let's expand \\((13x - 1"

Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, let me rearrange the equation to get \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th roots of both sides, but considering complex roots:\n\n\\[\nx = \\omega \\cdot (-(13x - 1))\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\omega^{10} = 1\\). The 10th roots of -1 are \\(e^{i\\pi(2k + 1)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\). Wait, actually, the equation can be written as \\(x^{10} = (-1) \\times (13x -1)^{10}\\), so each root \\(x\\) must satisfy \\(x = \\omega \\cdot (13x -1)\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\). Hmm, but since \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), that's slightly different from roots of unity. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation as:\n\nLet me denote \\( \\omega^{10} = -1 \\), so that \\( x = \\omega (13x - 1) \\).\n\nBut there are 10 roots \\(\\omega\\) here. For each \\(\\omega\\) such that \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), we have the equation \\(x = \\omega (13 x -1)\\). So, rearranged:\n\n\\(x = 13 \\omega x - \\omega\\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\(x - 13 \\omega x = - \\omega\\)\n\n\\(x (1 - 13 \\omega) = - \\omega\\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{ - \\omega }{1 -13 \\omega }\\)\n\nHmm, so each root is given by this expression for each 10th root of -1, which would be the roots \\(\\omega\\) such that \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this as \\(x = \\frac{ \\omega }{13 \\omega -1 }\\), by multiplying numerator and denominator by -1.\n\nYes, so \\(x = \\frac"

Wait, Vieta's formula for the product of roots. The product of all roots of the polynomial \\(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}\\) is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient, up to a sign. Let me check.\n\nThe polynomial is \\(x^{10} + (13x -1)^{10}\\). Let me expand the second term:\n\n\\((13x -1)^{10}\\) will have leading term \\((13x)^{10}\\), so the entire polynomial is \\(x^{10} + (13x)^{10} + \\text{lower degree terms}\\). Therefore, the leading term is \\(1 + 13^{10}\\) times \\(x^{10}\\). Wait, actually, no. Wait, the first term is \\(x^{10}\\), and the second term is \\((13x)^{10} + \\text{lower terms}\\). So the leading term is \\(x^{10} + (13x)^{10}\\), so the leading coefficient is \\(1 + 13^{10}\\). \n\nThe constant term of the polynomial is the constant term of \\(x^{10}\\) (which is 0) plus the constant term of \\((13x -1)^{10}\\), which is \\((-1)^{10} = 1\\). So the constant term is 1. \n\nTherefore, the product of all roots is \\(\\frac{(-1)^{10} \\times \\text{constant term}}{\\text{leading coefficient}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 13^{10}}\\). Wait, Vieta's formula says that the product of the roots is \\(\\frac{(-1)^{10} \\times \\text{constant term}}{\\text{leading coefficient}}\\). Since the polynomial is degree 10, so yes, that would be \\(\\frac"

This had to be correct because:\n\nThe sum was expressed as 10 *170 -26 * sum(omega + overline{omega}), and the sum over (omega + overline{omega}) equals 2 * real part terms, but since the sum over omega is zero, the sum over (omega + overline{omega}) is zero?\n\nWait, but in reality the sum over omega is zero, so the sum over omega + overline{omega} is 2 sum Re(omega) but sum Re(omega) is the real part of the sum of omega, which is zero. So yes, sum omega + overline{omega}=2 Re( sum omega ) =0.\n\nTherefore, the calculation leading to 1700 must"
