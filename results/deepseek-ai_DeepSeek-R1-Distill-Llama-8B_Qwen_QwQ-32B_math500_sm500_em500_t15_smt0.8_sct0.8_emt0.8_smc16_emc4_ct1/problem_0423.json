Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that for any complex number \\( r \\), the product \\( r \\overline{r} \\) is equal to \\( |r|^2 \\), which is the square of the modulus of \\( r \\). So \\( \\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}} \\) is essentially \\( \\frac{1}{|r|^2} \\). That means the sum I'm asked to find is the sum of the reciprocals of the squared magnitudes of each pair of complex conjugate roots.\n\nSince the equation is a polynomial of degree 10, there are 10 roots in total, and they come in 5 pairs of complex conjugates. That makes sense because non-real roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs. So, if \\( r \\) is a root, so is \\( \\overline{r} \\), and similarly for the others.\n\nNow, let me write down the given equation again: \\( x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0 \\). I can try expanding \\( (13x - 1)^{10} \\) but that seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nI remember that if we have a polynomial equation, the roots satisfy certain properties related to the coefficients. For instance, Vieta's formulas relate the sums and products of roots to the coefficients. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here because this equation isn't in a standard form like \\( a(x) - b = 0 \\). It's \\( x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0 \\). Maybe I can factor or manipulate this equation differently.\n\nLet me think about substitution. If I let \\( y = 13x - 1 \\), then the equation becomes \\( x^{10} + y^{10} = 0 \\). Oh"

Alternatively, maybe set \\( z = \\frac{x}{13x - 1} \\), but that might complicate things further.\n\nWait, another thought: the equation \\( x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10} \\). Taking the 10th roots of both sides, we can write \\( x = \\omega \\cdot ( -1 )^{1/10} \\cdot (13x - 1) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a 10th root of unity.

Therefore, each root can be written as \\( x = \\omega \\cdot (13x - 1) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a 10th root of -1, which is the same as a 10th root of unity multiplied by \\( e^{i\\pi/10} \\).

That seems correct because |13 - z|^2 = 170 -26 cosθ, and |1 -13 z|^4 = (170 -26 cosθ)^2, so 1/|1 -13 z|^4 is (170 -26 cosθ)^-2, but wait, but in my calculation, I thought it was |r|^2 = |13 - z|^2 / |1 -13 z|^4 = (170 -26 cosθ)/(170 -26 cosθ)^2 = 1/(170 -26 cosθ). So 1/(r \\overline{r}) is 170 -26 cosθ. Hmm, so that computation is correct.\n\nThen, the next step, the total sum of 1/(r_j \\overline"

So the final answer is 850.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). This equation can be rewritten as \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\), which implies that each root \\(x\\) satisfies \\(x = \\omega \\cdot (-1)^{1/10} \\cdot (13x - 1)\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of unity. \n\nRewriting this, we find that each root can be expressed as:\n\\[ x = \\frac{13 - z}{|1 - 13z|^2} \\]\nwhere \\(z = e^{i\\theta}\\) and \\(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi + 2\\pi k}{10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\).\n\nNext, we calculate \\(r_j \\overline{r_j}\\) for each root \\(r_j\\), which simplifies to:\n\\[ r_j \\overline{r_j} = \\frac{1}{170 - 26 \\cos\\theta_j} \\]\nThus, the reciprocal is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{r_j \\overline{r_j}} = 170 - 26 \\cos\\theta_j \\]\n\nWe then sum these reciprocals over the five unique pairs of complex conjugate roots. The angles \\(\\theta_j\\) for each pair are \\(\\pi/10, 3\\pi/10, \\pi/2, 7\\pi/10,\\) and \\(9\\pi/10\\). Notably, the"
