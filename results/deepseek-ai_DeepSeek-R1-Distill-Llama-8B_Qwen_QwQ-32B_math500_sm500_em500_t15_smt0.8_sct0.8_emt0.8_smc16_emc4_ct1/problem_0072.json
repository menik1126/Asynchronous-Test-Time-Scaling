Hmm, okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the greatest common divisor of \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, if I can figure out what divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\), that should help me find the gcd.\n\nLet me denote \\( d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\). That means \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). So, \\( d \\) must also divide any linear combination of these two numbers. Maybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here, which is a method to find the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying division.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm says that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b) \\). So, let me set \\( a = 2n + 1 \\) and \\( b = n + 7 \\). Then, I can compute \\( a \\mod b \\).\n\nWait, but to compute \\( 2n + 1 \\) mod \\( n + 7 \\), I need to express \\( 2n + 1 \\) in terms of \\( n + 7 \\). Let me try:\n\n\\( 2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13 \\). Let me check:\n\n\\( 2(n + 7) = 2n + 14 \\). So, \\( 2n + 1 = (2n + 14) - 13 = 2(n + 7) - 13 \\). Yep, that works.\n\nSo, \\( 2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13 \\). That means when I divide \\( 2n + 1 \\) by \\( n + 7 \\), the quotient is 2 and the remainder is -13. But, in the Euclidean algorithm, the remainder"

            "output": " should be positive. Hmm, so maybe I should write the remainder as \\( | -13 | = 13 \\), but actually, the sign doesn't matter because the gcd is always positive.\n\nWait, actually, when using the Euclidean algorithm, I can subtract multiples instead of dealing with negative numbers. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have \\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) \\), then I can express this as \\( \\gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7)) \\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\( (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\). So, the gcd becomes \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\).\n\nHmm, interesting. So, the gcd simplifies to \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\). That means that the gcd is equal to the gcd of \\( n + 7 \\) and 13. Since 13 is a prime number, the possible values for the gcd can only be 1 or 13.\n\nOkay, so the greatest possible value of the gcd is 13. Now, I need to check if 13 is achievable. That is, does there exist a positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 13 \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\)?\n\nLet me find such an \\( n \\). If \\( 13 \\) divides \\( n + 7 \\), then \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\). So, \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\). Since \\( -7 \\) mod 13 is 6 (because 13 - 7 = 6), that means \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\). So, let me set \\( n = 13k + 6 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\nNow, let's plug this into \\( 2n + 1 \\):\n\n\\( 2n + 1 = 2(13k + 6) + 1 = 26k + 12 + 1 = 26k + 13 = 13(2k + 1) \\). So, \\( 2n + 1 \\) is clearly"

Therefore, when \\( n = 13k + 6 \\), both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13, which means that the gcd is indeed 13.\n\nSo, since 13 is achievable and it's a prime number, it can't be any larger. Therefore, 13 is the greatest possible value.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me test this with \\( n = 6 \\) (when \\( k = 0 \\)):\n\nCompute \\( n + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \\).\nCompute \\( 2n + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \\).\nSo, \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\). Yep, that works.\n\nWhat about another \\( n \\), say \\( n = 19 \\) (which is 13*1 + 6):\n\n\\( 19 + 7 = 26 \\), which is 13*2.\n\\( 2*19 + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39 \\), which is 13*3.\nSo, \\( \\gcd(26, 39) = 13 \\). Perfect.\n\nNow, just to make sure that 13 is indeed the maximum, can the gcd ever be larger than 13? Since we've already reduced the gcd to 13 using the Euclidean algorithm, and 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, 13 is the maximum.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible value is \\boxed{13}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) for a positive integer \\( n \\), we start by denoting \\( d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\). This means \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm, we express the gcd as follows:\n\\[\n\\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = \\gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) - 2(n +"
