I need to find the maximum value of the greatest common divisor of these two expressions. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the gcd of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find a number that divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\), and then figure out the largest such number possible for any positive integer \\( n \\).\n\nMaybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here. I remember that the Euclidean algorithm is a method to compute the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying division and taking remainders. Let me try applying it to these expressions.\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). The Euclidean algorithm tells us that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b) \\). So, I should compute \\( a \\mod b \\) first.\n\nTo find \\( a \\mod b \\), I can express \\( a \\) as a multiple of \\( b \\) plus the remainder. But since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are expressions involving \\( n \\), maybe I can manipulate them to find a relationship.\n\nLet me write down \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). If I multiply \\( a \\) by 2, I get \\( 2a = 2n + 14 \\). Now, if I subtract \\( b \\) from \\( 2a \\), I get \\( 2a - b = (2n + 14) - (2n + 1) = 13 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 2a - b = 13 \\). That means \\( 2(n + 7) - (2n + 1) = 13 \\). Which simplifies to \\( 13 \\) being equal to that difference. Therefore, \\( 13 \\) is equal to \\( 2a - b \\), so \\( 13 \\) is a linear combination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). \n\nSince 13 is a linear combination of \\("

Therefore, the greatest common divisor \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\) can only be either 1 or 13.\n\nSo, the maximum possible value of this gcd is 13. Now, I need to check if there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) such that both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13. If such an \\( n \\) exists, then 13 is achievable, and hence the greatest possible value is 13. If not, then the gcd must always be 1, but I suspect 13 is achievable.\n\nLet me try to find such an \\( n \\). If \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13 \\), then:\n\n1. \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\)\n2. \\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\)\n\nFrom the first congruence, \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\), which is the same as \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\) because \\( -7 + 13 = 6 \\).\n\nNow, plugging this into the second congruence: \\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\). Substitute \\( n = 6 \\mod 13 \\):\n\n\\( 2(6) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\). Perfect, it works.\n\nSo, \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\) satisfies both conditions. Therefore, if we choose \\( n = 6 \\), \\( n + 7 = 13 \\), and \\( 2n + 1 = 13 \\), and indeed \\( \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\). Another example: \\( n = 6 + 13 = 19 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 26 \\), and \\( 2n + 1 = 39 \\). \\( \\gcd(26, 39) = 13 \\) as well. So, it works for multiple \\("

I applied the Euclidean algorithm, found that the gcd reduces to 13, and confirmed with specific values. So, I'm confident that 13 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks for the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) where \\( n \\) is a positive integer. \n\nTo solve this, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). We want to find \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\).\n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm:\n1. Compute \\( a \\mod b \\). \n2.

To check if 13 is achievable, solve:\n1. \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\) leads to \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\).\n2. \\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\) also holds when \\( n = 6 \\mod 13 \\).\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is \\( \\boxed{13} \\)."
