Adding those together gives a total of 1 mile south.\n\nNext, his eastward movement is straightforward. He walks 3/4 mile east.\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. The southward distance of 1 mile is the opposite side of the right-angled triangle, while the eastward distance is the adjacent side. Using the formula \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = \\frac{3}{4} \\), the distance is \\( \\sqrt{1^2 + (\\frac{3}{4})^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9}{16}} \\).\n\nCalculating further, \\( \\frac{9}{16} = 0.5625 \\), so \\( 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625 \\). Taking the square root of 1.5625 gives 1.25 miles.\n\nFinally, rounding to the nearest hundredth, the straight-line distance is 1.25 miles.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how far Bill is from his starting point in a straight line, we'll break down his movements and apply the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Southward Movement**\n\\[\n\\text{Total South} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile} = 1 \\text{ mile}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine Eastward Movement**\n\\[\n\\text{East} = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**\nThe straight-line distance \\( d \\) can be found using:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{(\\text{South})^2 + (\\text{East})^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\"
