Bill walks 1/2 mile south twice, so the total southward distance is 1 mile.\n\nThen, I'll determine the eastward displacement. He walks 3/4 mile east, which means his net eastward position is 3/4 mile.\n\nNow, I'll convert these displacements into decimal form for easier calculation. The southward distance is 1 mile, and the eastward distance is 0.75 miles.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, I'll calculate the direct-line distance from the starting point. The formula is the square root of (eastward distance squared plus southward distance squared).\n\nFinally, I'll round the result to the nearest hundredth to get the final answer.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down Bill's journey step-by-step to determine how far he is from his starting point in a straight line.\n\n1. **Starting Point:**\n   - Bill begins at the origin point, which we'll consider as \\((0, 0)\\).\n\n2. **First Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile **south**.\n   - Since south is typically considered the negative \\(y\\)-direction:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n   - Current position: \\((0, -\\frac{1}{2})\\)\n\n3. **Second Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile **east**.\n   - East is the positive \\(x\\)-direction:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta x = +\\frac{3}{4} \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n   - Current position: \\((\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{1}{2})\\)\n\n4. **Third Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks another \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile **south**.\n   - This adds to his current southward position:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n     (Total southward distance: \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\) mile)\n   - **Total Displacement in South Direction"
