Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it will make more sense.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right: √(∛(√(1/729))). So, it's the square root of the cube root of the square root of 1/729. I think I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out.\n\nStarting with √(1/729). I know that the square root of a fraction is the same as the square root of the numerator divided by the square root of the denominator, so let's calculate that. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729 is... hmm, what's the square root of 729? I remember that 27 squared is 729 because 27 * 27 is 729. So, √729 is 27. Therefore, √(1/729) is 1/27.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The square root of 1 is indeed 1, and the square root of 729 is 27, so yes, √(1/729) equals 1/27.\n\nNow, the next step is to take the cube root of that result. So, we have ∛(1/27). The cube root of 1 is 1, and what is the cube root of 27? Hmm, 3 cubed is 27 because 3*3*3 = 27. So, ∛27 is 3, which means ∛(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nAlright, now we have the cube root of the square root of 1/729 simplified to 1/3. Next, we need to take the square root of that result. So, √(1/3). Again, I can break this down into the square root of the numerator over the square root of the denominator. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 3 is… well, square root of 3 is irrational, but as long as we leave it as √3 in the denominator, that's fine.\n\nSo, √(1/3) is √1 / √3,"

            "output": " which simplifies to 1/√3. But the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator. Oh right, so I need to rationalize the denominator here. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by √3. That way, the denominator becomes √3 * √3 = 3, and the numerator becomes √3. So, 1/√3 becomes √3/3.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have 1 over √3, multiplying numerator and denominator by √3 gives (1 * √3)/(√3 * √3) = √3 / 3. Yep, that's correct. So the final simplified expression with a rational denominator is √3 over 3.\n\nBut let me go back through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the original expression:\n\n√(∛(√(1/729)))\n\nFirst step: √(1/729) = 1/27. Correct, since sqrt(729) is 27.\n\nSecond step: ∛(1/27) = 1/3. Correct, since cube root of 27 is 3.\n\nThird step: √(1/3) = 1/√3, then rationalizing gives √3/3. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express all the roots as exponents and simplify using exponent rules? Let me try that approach to verify.\n\nStarting with the original expression:\n\n√(∛(√(1/729))) can be written using exponents. Remember that the nth root is the same as raising to the 1/n power.\n\nSo, starting from the inside:\n\n√(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2).\n\nThen, the cube root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n\nThen, taking the square root of that result: [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nHmm, so the entire expression"

            "output": " simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12). Now, I need to compute (1/729)^(1/12). Maybe expressing 729 as a power of a number will help. 729 is 9^3 because 9*9*9 = 729, right? But 9 is 3^2, so 729 is (3^2)^3 = 3^(2*3) = 3^6.\n\nAh, so 729 = 3^6, so 1/729 is 1/3^6, which is (1/3)^6.\n\nTherefore, (1/729)^(1/12) is [(1/3)^6]^(1/12) = (1/3)^(6*(1/12)) = (1/3)^(1/2) = 1/√3. Which is the same as before, so again rationalize the denominator: √3/3.\n\nSo, same answer. Hmm, so that method worked too. So both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nWait, maybe I can also express it as exponents of exponents step by step, just to make sure.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n√(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2).\n\nThen, ∛ of that: [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n\nThen, √ of that: [ (1/729)^(1/6) ]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/(6*2)) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nAs before, since 729 is 3^6, then 1/729 is 3^(-6).\n\nSo, (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/(3^(1/2)) = 1/√3 = √3/3.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nHmm, so both ways, I end up with √3/3 as the simplified form with a rational denominator.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe using logarithms? Well, that seems overkill, but let me try.\n\nWait, perhaps not necessary. But in any case, the first two methods"

Let's compute the original expression numerically and see if it matches √3/3.\n\nFirst, compute 1/729. That's approximately 0.001371742.\n\nTake the square root of that: sqrt(0.001371742). Let's see, sqrt(0.0016) is 0.04, so sqrt(0.00137) should be a bit less. Let me compute it:\n\nsqrt(0.001371742) ≈ 0.037. Let me check with calculator steps:\n\n0.037 squared is 0.001369, which is close to 0.001371742. So approximately 0.0370.\n\nThen, take the cube root of that. So cube root of 0.037. Let's see, 0.037 is approximately 0.037. The cube root of 0.064 is 0.4, since 0.4^3 = 0.064. So cube root of 0.037 is a bit less than 0.3. Let me compute 0.3^3 = 0.027, so 0.037 is between 0.3^3 and 0.4^3. Let me see, 0.33^3 = 0.035937, which is close to 0.037. So cube root of 0.037 is approximately 0.333.\n\nThen, take the square root of that. sqrt(0.333) is approximately 0.577. Now, √3 is approximately 1.732, so √3 divided by 3 is 1.732 / 3 ≈ 0.577. So that matches. So the numerical approximation also gives the same result. So that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is √3 over 3. So, written with a rational denominator, that's √3/3"

Which is 1/√3, and rationalizing gives √3/3. Correct.\n\nYes, that all adds up.\n\nAlternatively, I could express all these roots using exponents of exponents:\n\n√(∛(√(1/729))) = ( ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) )^(1/2)\n\nWhich simplifies as:\n\n1/729^(1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2) = 1/729^(1/12)\n\nSince 729 = 3^6,\n\nSo 1/3^6^(1/12) = 1/3^(6*(1/12)) = 1/3^(1/2) = 1/√3 = √3/3.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nWait another thought: Could I express everything in terms of 3s since 729 is 3^6, as I saw before.\n\nSo, 729 = 3^6.\n\nThus, 1/729 = 3^(-6).\n\nThen, √(3^(-6)) = 3^(-3).\n\nThen, ∛(3^(-3)) = 3^(-1).\n\nThen, √(3^(-1)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/3^(1/2) = √3/3.\n\nWow, that's another way to think about it, breaking it down step by step using exponents of 3.\n\nStarting with 1/729 = 3^-6.\n\n√(3^-6) = (3^-6)^(1/2) = 3^(-3) = 1/3^3 = 1/27.\n\nThen, ∛(1/27) = (1/27)^(1/3) = 3^(-1) = 1/"
