Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all the roots involved, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write it out again to make sure I have it right: \u221a(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))). So, it's a square root of a cube root of a square root of 1/729. I need to simplify this expression and get rid of any radicals in the denominator if possible. But wait, the denominator is rational already since 1/729 is a fraction. Maybe I just need to simplify all the roots into a single exponent and then rationalize if necessary.\n\nI remember that roots can be written as exponents, right? So, the square root is the same as raising to the 1/2 power, cube root is raising to the 1/3 power, and so on. Let me rewrite each part:\n\nStart from the inside: \u221a(1/729). That's the square root of 1/729. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729... Hmm, what's the square root of 729? Let me think. I know that 27 squared is 729 because 27*27 is 729. So, \u221a729 is 27. Therefore, \u221a(1/729) is 1/27. \n\nSo, now the expression becomes \u221a(\u221b(1/27)). Okay, moving one layer out. Now, the cube root of 1/27. What's the cube root of 27? Well, 3 cubed is 27, right? So, \u221b27 is 3. Therefore, \u221b(1/27) is 1/3.\n\nNow, the expression is simplified to \u221a(1/3). So, the square root of 1/3. Let me write that as \u221a1 / \u221a3, which is 1 / \u221a3. But the problem says to write it with a rational denominator. I remember that to rationalize the denominator, I can multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a3.\n\nSo, 1 / \u221a3 becomes (\u221a3 / \u221a3) / ( (\u221a3)(\u221a3) ) = \u221a3 / 3. Therefore, the simplified form is \u221a3 /"

Since 729 is 9^3 (9*9=81, 81*9=729), but also 27^2 is 729. So, square root of 1/729 is indeed 1/27. Then, the cube root of 1/27: since 3^3 is 27, so cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then the square root of 1/3 is 1/\u221a3, which rationalizes to \u221a3/3. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this using exponents all the way through. Let me try that method to confirm.\n\nStarting with the original expression: \u221a(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))). Let me express each root as an exponent:\n\nFirst, the innermost radical is the square root of (1/729), which is (1/729)^(1/2).\n\nThen, the cube root of that result would be [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3).\n\nThen, the square root of that would be [ ( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) ]^(1/2).\n\nMultiplying the exponents: Let's see, starting from the inside:\n\nFirst exponent: (1/729)^(1/2)\n\nSecond exponent: (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6)\n\nThird exponent: (1/729)^(1/6 * 1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12)\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12). \n\nHmm, so maybe I can write 1/729 as 729^(-1), so then (729^(-1))^(1/12) = 729^(-1/12). \n\nAlternatively, 729 is 9^3, so 7"

            "output": "^(3) is not, but 9 is 3^2. So, 729 is (3^2)^3 = 3^(2*3) = 3^6. So, 729 = 3^6.\n\nTherefore, 729^(-1/12) = (3^6)^(-1/12) = 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/\u221a3. \n\nWhich again, rationalizes to \u221a3/3. \n\nSo, either way, whether breaking it down step by step or expressing all as exponents, I end up with \u221a3/3. So that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me double-check 729 being 3^6. Because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, yes that's correct. So, 3^6 is 729. So, that makes 729^(-1/12) equal to 3^(-6*(1/12)) which is 3^(-1/2) or 1/\u221a3. So that's another way to get the same result.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each step numerically to ensure that I haven't missed anything.\n\nCompute \u221a(1/729):\n\n1/729 is approximately 0.001371742. Square root of that is approximately 0.037037. 1/27 is approximately 0.037037, so that matches.\n\nThen, cube root of 0.037037: let me compute that. The cube root of 1/27 is 1/3, which is approximately 0.333333... So, that's correct.\n\nThen, square root of 1/3: 1/3 is approximately 0.333333. The square root of that is approximately 0.57735, which is about \u221a3/3 because \u221a3 is approximately 1.732, so 1.732/3 is approximately 0.57735. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, all the numerical approximations confirm that \u221a(\u221b(\u221a(1/729))) is equal to \u221a3 divided by 3, written as \u221a3/3.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Perhaps.\n\nI could express all the roots as exponents and multiply the exponents together.\n\nStarting with the innermost radical: \u221a(1/729"

So, all methods lead to the same conclusion. \n\nTherefore, the simplified form with a rational denominator is \u221a3 over 3. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me just check if there's any step where I might have made a mistake. \n\nWait, when I converted the exponents, I had to multiply them each time. Let me confirm that:\n\nStarting with the first exponent: \u221a(something) is exponent 1/2. Then, the cube root is exponent 1/3, so the total exponent after two steps is (1/2)*(1/3) = 1/6. Then, the outer square root is exponent 1/2, so total exponent is (1/6)*(1/2) = 1/12. So, the exponent on 1/729 is 1/12. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 1/12 exponent is the 12th root. So, the 12th root of 1/729. Since 729 is 3^6, so 1/729 is 3^-6. The 12th root of 3^-6 is 3^(-6/12) = 3^(-1/2"
