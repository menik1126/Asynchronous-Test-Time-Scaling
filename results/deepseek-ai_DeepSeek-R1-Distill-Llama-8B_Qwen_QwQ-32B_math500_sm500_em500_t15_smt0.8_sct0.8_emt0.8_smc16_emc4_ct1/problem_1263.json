            "output": "To find the base six equivalent of 999 in base ten, I first need to determine how many times 6 to the power of 3 fits into 999.\n\nI'll start by calculating 6 raised to the third power, which is 216. Dividing 999 by 216 gives me 4 with a remainder.\n\nNext, I'll divide the remainder by 6 squared (36). The remainder from the first division is 999 minus 4 times 216, which equals 27. Dividing 27 by 36 gives me 0 with a remainder of 27.\n\nThen, I'll divide the new remainder by 6 to the first power (6). The remainder is 27 divided by 6, which equals 4 with a remainder of 3.\n\nFinally, I'll record the coefficients in reverse order based on how many times each power of 6 fit into the number, resulting in 4 0 4 in base six.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide by \\( 6^3 \\) (216):**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 216 = 4 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 999 - 4 \\times 216 = 27\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Divide the remainder by \\( 6^2 \\) (36):**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 36 = 0 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 27\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Divide the new remainder by \\( 6^1 \\) (6):**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Record the coefficients in reverse order:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6^2 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 4 \\times 6^0 = 440_6\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{440_6}\n\\]"
