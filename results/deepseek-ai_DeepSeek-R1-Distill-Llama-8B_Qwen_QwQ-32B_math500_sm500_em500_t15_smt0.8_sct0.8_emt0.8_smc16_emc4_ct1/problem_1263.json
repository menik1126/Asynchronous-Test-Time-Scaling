This involves dividing the number by 6 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 999 by 6. The quotient is 166 and the remainder is 3. I'll note down the remainder 3.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6 again. This gives a quotient of 27 and a remainder of 4.\n\nThen, I'll divide 27 by 6, resulting in a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3.\n\nFinally, I'll divide 4 by 6, which gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4.\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top, the base six equivalent of \\( 999_{10} \\) is \\( 1443_6 \\).\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of \\( 999_{10} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6:**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 3\n\n2. **Divide 166 by 6:**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 4\n\n3. **Divide 27 by 6:**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 3\n\n4. **Divide 4 by 6:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Remainder:** 4\n\n5. **Read the remainders from last to first:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\quad 3 \\quad 4 \\quad 3\n   \\]\n   - **Base six equivalent:** \\( 1443_6 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1443_6}\n\\]"
