Looking at the chart, the 70s include Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain.\n\nNext, I'll list the prices for each country during that decade:\n- Brazil: $6$ cents\n- France: $4$ cents\n- Peru: $12$ cents\n- Spain: $6$ cents\n\nSince there are no entries for any country in the 70s, the total number of stamps from that decade is zero.\n\nFinally, to find the average price, I'll divide the total cost by the number of stamps. However, since there are no stamps in the 70s, this results in an undefined average. Therefore, there is no average price for Juan's 70s stamps.\n</think>\n\n**Question: What was the average price, in cents, of Juan's 70's stamps?**\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Stamps from the 70s:**\n   - From the chart, there are entries for Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain in the 70s. However, upon closer examination:\n     - **Brazil (70s):** 6 cents\n     - **France (70s):** 4 cents\n     - **Peru (70s):** 12 cents\n     - **Spain (70s):** 6 cents\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of 70s Stamps:**\n   - Brazil: 1 stamp\n   - France: 1 stamp\n   - Peru: 1 stamp\n   - Spain: 1 stamp\n   - **Total number of 70s stamps = 4 stamps**\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost of 70s Stamps:**\n   - Brazil: 6 cents\n   - France: 4 cents\n   - Peru: 12 cents\n   - Spain: 6 cents\n   - **Total cost = 6 + 4 + 12 + 6 = 28 cents**\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Price per 70s Stamp:**\n   - **Average price = Total cost ÷ Total number of 70s stamps**\n   - **Average price = 28 cents ÷ 4 stamps = 7 cents**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{7}"
