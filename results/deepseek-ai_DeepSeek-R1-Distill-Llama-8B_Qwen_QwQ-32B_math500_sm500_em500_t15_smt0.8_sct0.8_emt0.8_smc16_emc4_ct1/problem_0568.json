            "output": "To solve the problem, I first need to determine the number of ways the Democrats can be seated. Since there are 5 Democrats, they can be arranged in 5! ways around the table.\n\nNext, I'll consider the Republicans. With 5 Republicans, they can also be arranged in 5! different ways.\n\nFinally, the Independent will have only 1 seat, so there's only 1 way to seat them.\n\nSince the parties must all sit together, I'll multiply the number of arrangements for each party: 5! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 1!.\n\nHowever, because the table is circular, arrangements that are rotations of each other are considered the same. To account for this, I'll divide the total number of arrangements by the number of seats, which is 6. So, the final number of distinct seatings is (5! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 1!) / 6.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seatings, we'll break the problem into steps:\n\n1. **Arrange the Democrats:**\n   - There are 5 Democrats who can be seated in \\(5!\\) ways around the table.\n\n2. **Arrange the Republicans:**\n   - There are 5 Republicans who can be seated in \\(5!\\) ways around the table.\n\n3. **Arrange the Independent:**\n   - There is only 1 Independent, so there's only 1 way to seat them.\n\n4. **Total Arrangements Without Considering Rotation:**\n   - Since the parties must sit together, multiply the arrangements of each group:\n     \\[\n     5! \\times 5! \\times 1! = 120 \\times 120 \\times 1 = 14,\\!400\n     \\]\n\n5. **Adjust for Circular Arrangements:**\n   - In circular permutations, rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new arrangement. Therefore, we divide by the number of seats (6):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{14,\\!400}{6} = 2,\\!400\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2400}\n\\]"
