            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of seating arrangements possible under the given constraints. The committee consists of 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, making a total of 11 members. Since they are sitting around a circular table, the number of linear arrangements is initially 10! (because one position can be fixed to account for rotational symmetry).\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that all members of each party must sit next to each other. This means the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent will form three distinct blocks. The number of ways to arrange these blocks around the table is 3! (since one position can be fixed).\n\nNext, I need to consider the internal arrangements within each block. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange themselves, and similarly, the Republicans have 5! ways. The Independent, being a single person, has only 1 way to arrange themselves.\n\nTo find the total number of valid seating arrangements, I multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of internal arrangements for each block and then multiply by the number of ways to arrange the blocks themselves. This gives the formula: 3! × 5! × 5!.\n\nFinally, I calculate the numerical value by computing the factorial expressions:\n3! = 6,\n5! = 120,\nMultiplying these together: 6 × 120 × 120 = 8640.\n\nSo, there are 8,640 different ways for the committee members to be seated under the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of valid seating arrangements, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Circular Arrangement:**\n   - Since the table is circular, we can fix one person's position to eliminate rotations as distinct arrangements.\n   \n2. **Form Blocks:**\n   - All Democrats must sit together, all Republicans must sit together, and the Independent will form a single-person block.\n   \n3. **Arrange the Blocks:**\n   - There are 3 blocks (D, R, I). The number of ways to arrange these blocks around the table is \\( (3-1)! = 2! \\) because one position is fixed.\n   \n4. **Arrange Within Each Block:**\n   - Democrats can be arranged among themselves in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n   - Republicans can be arranged among themselves in \\( 5! \\) ways.\n   - The Independent has only 1 way to arrange"

There's a mistake here. Let me re-examine the steps.\n\n**Revised Steps:**\n\n1. **Circular Arrangement Fix:**\n   - Fix one block's position instead of a single person to account for rotations. This reduces the problem to arranging the remaining blocks linearly.\n   \n2. **Arrange the Blocks:**\n   - With one block fixed, the remaining 2 blocks can be arranged in \\( 2! \\) ways.\n   \n3. **Internal Arrangements:**\n   - Each block's internal arrangements remain \\( 5! \\), \\( 5! \\), and \\( 1 \\).\n   \n4. **Total Arrangements:**\n   - \\( 2! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1 \\)\n   \n   - \\( 2! = 2 \\)\n   - \\( 5! = 120 \\)\n   - Total: \\( 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 = 28,800 \\)\n\nWait, but the problem states there are 11 people. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. Total 11. When arranging blocks around a circular table, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is indeed \\( (3-1)! = 2! \\). Then multiply by the internal permutations of each block. So the calculation is correct. But the answer here is 28,800. But I think I made a mistake in the first step.\n\nWait, actually, the standard formula for circular permutations with blocks is:\n\nFirst, treat each party as a single \"block\". The number of ways to arrange the blocks around a circular table is \\( (k-1)! \\), where \\( k \\) is the number of"

Wait, no, because once we fix the circular arrangement, the independent can be placed in one specific spot relative to the other blocks.\n\nWait, no. The issue is that when we fix one block, say the Democrats, then the Republicans can be arranged in \\(2!\\) ways relative to the Democrats, and the independent is fixed as well. So actually, the correct calculation is indeed \\(2! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1 = 28,800\\). However, the answer I initially thought is 8640, which is 2! times 120 times 120 is 28,800, which is correct.\n\nWait, no, wait.

The independent is a single member, so they form a block of size 1. So the blocks are D, R, I. So the number of ways to arrange the blocks around the table is (3-1)! = 2!.\n\nThen, within each block, the D can be arranged in 5!, R in 5!, and I in 1!.\n\nThus, total is 2! *5! *5! = 2*120*120 = 28,800.\n\nBut the user's initial thought process had 3! instead of 2!.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the user thought that the independent is not a block, but that's not the case. The problem says \"all the members of each party all sit next to each other\". Since the independent is a single member, they trivially satisfy the condition (since there's only themselves). So they form a block of size 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 2! *5! *5!.\n\nBut let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose there are three blocks: A, B, C. The number of circular arrangements is (3-1)! = 2!.\n\nEach block can be arranged internally. So total is 2! * (size of A)! * (size of B)! * (size of C)!.\n\nYes, so in this case, the sizes are 5,5,1. So 2! *5! *5! *1!.\n\nThus, the answer is 28,800.\n\nWait, but the user's first answer was 8640, which is 3! *5! *5!.\n\nAh, so the user made a mistake in the first step by using 3! instead of 2!.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 28,800.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.\"\n\nTherefore, in circular permutations, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! for n people.

Since all Democrats must sit together, etc., the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to arrange the blocks plus the internal permutations.\n\nBut in circular permutations, when grouping, the formula is (k-1)! where k is the number of groups.\n\nHere, k=3, so (3-1)! = 2!.\n\nThen, each group can be arranged internally: 5! for D, 5! for R, and 1! for I.\n\nMultiply all together: 2! *5! *5! *1! = 2*120*120 = 28,800.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 28,800.\n\nBut wait, in the initial problem, the user asked for the number of ways, and the final answer was given as 8640, which is 3! *5! *5!.\n\nWait, so the user's initial answer was wrong because they used 3! instead of 2!.\n\nSo, to correctly answer, we have to use 2! *5! *5! = 28,800.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 28,800.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check with another method.\n\nImagine fixing one Democrat's position. Since it's a circular table, we can fix one person to remove rotational symmetry.\n\nOnce one Democrat is fixed, the other Democrats must sit next to them either clockwise or counter"

Wait, but actually, if we fix one Democrat, the entire block of Democrats is fixed in position, but the order of the Democrats can still be arranged.\n\nWait, perhaps this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach:\n\nFirst, consider the three blocks: D, R, I.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these blocks around the table is (3-1)! = 2!.\n\nThen, within each block:\n\n- The D block can be arranged in 5! ways.\n\n- The R block can be arranged in 5! ways.\n\n- The I block has only 1 way.\n\nThus, total arrangements: 2! × 5! × 5! = 2 × 120 × 120 = 28,800.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 28,800.\n\nHowever, the user's initial thought process had 3! ×5! ×5!.\n\nThis is incorrect because in circular permutations, the number of arrangements of k objects is (k-1)!.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 28,800.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example.\n\nSuppose there are two parties: 1 Democrat and 1 Republican, and 1 Independent.

Number of arrangements: (2-1)! =1!.\n\nInternal arrangements: 2! for D, 1 for R.\n\nTotal: 1×2×1=2.\n\nIndeed, fixing the D block, the R can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise, but since it's circular, only one arrangement.
