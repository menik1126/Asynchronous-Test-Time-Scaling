            "output": "First, I need to determine how many ways Mr. Brennan can choose 3 boys out of 7. This can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 boys is C(7, 3). Calculating that, I get 35 possible combinations.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4. Using the same combination formula, C(4, 2) equals 6.\n\nSince the choices of boys and girls are independent, the total number of ways to choose the group is the product of the two combinations. Therefore, the total number of ways is 35 multiplied by 6, which equals 210.\n\nSo, there are 210 different ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls from his statistics class, we'll use combinations. The order in which the students are chosen does not matter.\n\n**Step 1: Choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the number of ways to choose boys by the number of ways to choose girls.**\n\\[\n35 \\times 6 = 210\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Brennan can form the group in \\(\\boxed{210}\\) different ways."
