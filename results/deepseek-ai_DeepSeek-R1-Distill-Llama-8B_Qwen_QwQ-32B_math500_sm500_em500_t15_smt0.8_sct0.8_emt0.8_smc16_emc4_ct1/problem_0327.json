Since the order of selection doesn't matter, I should use combinations for both the boys and the girls.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7 using the combination formula:\nC(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!) = 35.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4:\nC(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4-2)!) = 6.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to select both 3 boys and 2 girls, I'll multiply the two combinations:\nTotal ways = C(7, 3) * C(4, 2) = 35 * 6 = 210.\n\nTherefore, there are 210 different ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls for the group presentation.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can select 3 boys and 2 girls from his class, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7:**\n   \\[\n   C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4:**\n   \\[\n   C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the total number of ways to choose both groups:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total ways} = C(7, 3) \\times C(4, 2) = 35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
