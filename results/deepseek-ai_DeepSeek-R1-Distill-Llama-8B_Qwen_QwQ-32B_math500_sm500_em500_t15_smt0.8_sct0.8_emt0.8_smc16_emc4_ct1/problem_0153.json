            "output": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2.5^2 - 0.7^2}}{2.7 - 2.5}\\). Hmm, let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the numerator. It has a square root, and inside that square root, there's a subtraction of two squares: \\(2.5^2\\) and \\(0.7^2\\). I remember that \\(a^2 - b^2\\) can be factored into \\((a - b)(a + b)\\). So maybe I can use that identity here instead of just calculating each square and subtracting.\n\nLet me compute \\(2.5^2\\) and \\(0.7^2\\) first. \n\nCalculating \\(2.5^2\\): 2.5 times 2.5 is 6.25.\n\nCalculating \\(0.7^2\\): 0.7 times 0.7 is 0.49.\n\nSo now, the numerator becomes \\(\\sqrt{6.25 - 0.49}\\). Let's subtract those: 6.25 minus 0.49. \n\nWait, 6.25 - 0.49. Let me do this carefully. \n\n6.25 minus 0.49 is the same as 6.25 - 0.50 + 0.01, right? Because 0.49 is one cent less than 0.50. So that would be 6.25 - 0.50 = 5.75, then add back 0.01, giving me 5.76.\n\nSo now the numerator is \\(\\sqrt{5.76}\\). Hmm, what's the square root of 5.76? Let me think. I know that 2.4 squared is 5.76 because 2.4 times 2.4 is 5.76. So the square root of 5.76 is 2.4.\n\nAlright, so the numerator simplifies to 2.4.\n\nNow, the denominator is \\(2.7 - 2.5\\). Let me subtract those: 2.7 minus 2.5 is 0.2.\n\nSo now the expression simplifies to \\(\\frac{2.4}{0.2}\\).\n\nCalculating that division: 2.4"

            "output": " divided by 0.2. Well, 0.2 goes into 2.4 twelve times because 0.2 times 12 is 2.4.\n\nWait, let me check that: 0.2 times 10 is 2, and 0.2 times 2 is 0.4, so 10 + 2 is 12, and 2 + 0.4 is 2.4. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator was 2.4 and the denominator was 0.2, so the whole expression simplifies to 12.\n\nBut wait, let me go back and see if there's another way to approach the numerator using the difference of squares to make it maybe easier or to confirm my answer.\n\nI had \\(2.5^2 - 0.7^2\\), which factors into \\((2.5 - 0.7)(2.5 + 0.7)\\). Let me compute those.\n\n\\(2.5 - 0.7 = 1.8\\).\n\n\\(2.5 + 0.7 = 3.2\\).\n\nSo then, \\(2.5^2 - 0.7^2 = 1.8 \\times 3.2\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: 1.8 times 3.2.\n\n1.8 times 3 is 5.4.\n\n1.8 times 0.2 is 0.36.\n\nAdding them together: 5.4 + 0.36 = 5.76.\n\nSo, the square root of 5.76 is still 2.4, as I had before. So that method gives me the same numerator.\n\nSo then, I still end up with the same simplified expression: 2.4 divided by 0.2, which is 12.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can represent 2.5 and 0.7 as fractions to see if that helps.\n\n2.5 is the same as 5/2.\n\n0.7 is the same as 7/10.\n\nSo then, \\(2.5^2 - 0.7^2\\) becomes \\((5/2)^2 - (7/10)^2\\).\n\nCalculating those squares: \n\n\\((5/2)^2 = 25/4\\).\n\n\\((7/10)^"

Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, 576 divided by 100 is 5.76, which makes sense because earlier I had 5.76. But as a fraction, 576/100 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: 576 ÷4 =144, 100 ÷4=25. So it's 144/25.\n\nSo the numerator under the square root is 144/25, so the square root is sqrt(144/25) = 12/5, which is 2.4. So that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, that gives me numerator as 12/5, denominator as 0.2, which is the same as 1/5. So 12/5 divided by 1/5 is (12/5) * (5/1) = 12. So that's again 12.\n\nSo, regardless of the approach, the answer comes out to 12.\n\nI think that's solid. So the simplified expression is 12.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the given expression, we start by evaluating the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nFirst, calculate the squares in the numerator:\n\n\\[\n2.5^2 = 6.25\n\\]\n\\[\n0.7^2 = 0.49\n\\]\n\nSubtracting these:\n\n\\[\n6.25 - 0.49 = 5.76\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{5.76} = 2.4\n\\]\n\nNext, compute the denominator:\n\n\\[\n2.7 - 2.5 = 0.2\n\\]\n\nNow, divide the simplified numerator by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2.4}{0.2} = 12\n\\]\n\nThus, the simplified expression is \\(\\boxed{12}\\)."
