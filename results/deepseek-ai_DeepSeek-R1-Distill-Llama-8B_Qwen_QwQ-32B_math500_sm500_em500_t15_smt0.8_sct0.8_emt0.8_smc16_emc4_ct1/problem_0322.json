Since the order doesn't matter, I'll use the combination formula for choosing boys.\n\nUsing the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nFor the boys, that's C(7, 3) = 7! / (3!4!) = 35 ways.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from the 4 available, again using the combination formula.\n\nFor the girls, that's C(4, 2) = 4! / (2!2!) = 6 ways.\n\nTo find the total number of ways to pick the group, I'll multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls.\n\nSo, total ways = 35 * 6 = 210.\n\nTherefore, there are 210 different ways Mr. Brennan can select 3 boys and 2 girls for the presentation.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of selecting 3 boys and 2 girls from Mr. Brennan's class, we'll use combinations since the order of selection doesn't matter.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Multiply the number of ways to choose boys by the number of ways to choose girls to get the total number of groups:**\n   \\[\n   35 \\times 6 = 210\n   \\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{210}\n\\]"
