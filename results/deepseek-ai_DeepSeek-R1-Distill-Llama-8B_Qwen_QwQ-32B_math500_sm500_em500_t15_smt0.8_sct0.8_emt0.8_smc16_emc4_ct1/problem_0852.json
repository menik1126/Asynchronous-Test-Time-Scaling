To find the value of \\(x\\), I'll set up an equation based on this information.\n\nI'll start by calculating half of \\(3x - 9\\). Dividing by 2 gives me \\(\\frac{3x - 9}{2}\\). According to the problem, this is equal to \\(x + 37\\).\n\nNext, I'll set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 9}{2} = x + 37\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\\]\n\nNow, I'll move all the \\(x\\)-terms to one side and the constants to the other side. Subtracting \\(2x\\) from both sides gives:\n\\[\nx - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\nFinally, I'll isolate \\(x\\) by adding 9 to both sides:\n\\[\nx = 83\n\\]\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n\\[\n\\text{Half the value of } 3x - 9 = x + 37\n\\]\n\n**Step 1:** Write the equation as:\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 9}{2} = x + 37\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to gather like terms:\n\\[\n3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\nx = 74 + 9\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 83\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{83}\n\\]"
