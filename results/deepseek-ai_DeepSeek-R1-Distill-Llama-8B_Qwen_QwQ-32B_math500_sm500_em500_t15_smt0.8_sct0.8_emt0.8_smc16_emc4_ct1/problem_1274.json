This observation simplifies the problem since both terms are powers of 2.\n\nI recall that 256 is equal to \\(2^8\\). By rewriting the equation with this information, it becomes \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{1/2}\\).\n\nApplying the exponent rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\), the right side simplifies to \\(2^{4}\\).\n\nNow, the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^{4}\\). Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.
