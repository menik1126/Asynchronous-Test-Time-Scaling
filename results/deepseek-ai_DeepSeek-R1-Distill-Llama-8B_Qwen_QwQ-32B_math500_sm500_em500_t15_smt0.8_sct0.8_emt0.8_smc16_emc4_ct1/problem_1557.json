Since the table is square, rotations of the seating arrangement are considered identical. This means that fixing one person's position can help eliminate equivalent configurations due to rotational symmetry.\n\nNext, I'll fix one person's seat to serve as a reference point. By doing this, I can avoid counting rotational duplicates. With one person seated, there are 7 remaining people to arrange around the table.\n\nThe square table has 4 sides, and each side must have 2 people. Therefore, each side will have one additional person besides the fixed position. This means I have 4 specific seats available (one on each side) for the remaining 7 people.\n\nHowever, since there are 7 people and only 4 seats available, this implies that one of the seats will have 2 people sitting next to each other. This is an important consideration because it affects the number of distinct seating arrangements.\n\nI will then calculate the number of ways to distribute these 7 people into the 4 seats. This can be done using the combinations formula, where I choose 4 people out of 7 to sit in the specific seats, and the remaining 3 will be paired together.\n\nFinally, for each way of distributing the people into the seats, I'll consider the permutations of the remaining people to account for the different possible arrangements within each seat. Multiplying the number of combinations by the number of permutations will give me the total number of distinct seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotational symmetry, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix one person's position** to eliminate rotational duplicates.

Since each side must have 2 people, and we've already fixed one seat, we need to place the remaining 7 people into the remaining 7 seats (2 on 3 sides and 1 on the fourth side).\n\n3. **Calculate the number of ways** to distribute these 7 people into the 4 sides:\n   - Choose 4 people to sit on the single-person seats (one on each side).\n   - The remaining 3 people will sit together on a single side.\n\n4. **Compute the combinations**:\n   - Number"

Since we fixed one person's position, the side with 3 people is already determined relative to the fixed position, so no further division is needed.\n\nWait, correction: The initial approach has an error. Let's re-express:\n\n**Correct Approach**:\n- Fix one person's seat. The remaining 7 people must be arranged in the remaining 7 seats (each side has 2 seats, but one seat is already occupied by the fixed person).\n- The table has 4 sides, each with 2 seats. After fixing one seat, the remaining seats are 7 (since one seat is fixed). However, each side has one remaining seat except the side opposite the fixed person, which has two seats left. Wait, no:\n\nWait, actually, fixing one seat on a side leaves the other seat on that side still available. Let me clarify:\n\nEach side has two seats. Fixing one person in one seat of a side leaves 7 seats: the other seat on that side, and two seats on each of the other three sides. Wait, no:\n\nWait, a square table has 4 sides, each with two seats. Total seats: 8. Fixing one seat leaves 7 seats. The side where the fixed seat is has one remaining seat, and the other three sides each have two seats. Wait, no:\n\nWait, each side has two seats. If one seat is fixed, then the side with the fixed seat still has one seat remaining. The other three sides each have two seats.

Let me think.\n\nWait, no. Let's consider:\n\nTotal seats: 8 (4 sides, 2 each).\nFix one seat (say, seat 1 on side A). Then the remaining 7 seats are: seat 2 on side A, seat 1 on side B, seat 2 on side B, seat 1 on side C, seat 2 on side C, seat 1 on side D, seat 2 on side D.\n\nWait, no, each side has two seats. So after fixing seat 1 on side A, the remaining seats are seat 2 on side A, and all seats on sides B, C, D (each has two seats). So total remaining seats: 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7, as previously.\n\nNow, we need to seat 7 people in these 7 seats. But we need to consider rotational symmetry. However, since we've fixed one seat, rotations are already accounted for. Therefore, the number of arrangements is the number of ways to arrange 7 people in 7 seats, which is 7! But that can't be right because people are distinct, and the problem is symmetrical.\n\nWait, but the initial problem was not about arranging in a circular table but around a square table with sides, so perhaps linear arrangements per side. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nBut actually, when you fix one seat, the others are relative to that fixed seat. Therefore, the number of ways should be 7! However, the problem states that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another, but since we've fixed one seat, rotational configurations are no longer considered equivalent.\n\nWait, but no, in the problem statement, it's stated that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. So fixing one seat ensures that we are not overcounting due to rotation. So if we fix one seat, then the number of distinct arrangements is indeed 7! / 1 = 5040. But wait, no, because each side has a specific position.\n\nWait, perhaps not 7! because the arrangement on each side may matter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that after fixing one seat, the other seats can be considered as a"

The key is that the seats are arranged in a square, so the positions are fixed relative to each other. Once we fix one person's seat, the rest can be arranged in the remaining seats, but the sides are distinguishable by their positions relative to the fixed seat.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrangements is indeed 7!.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"two people on a side\". So each side must have exactly two people. Wait, but if we fix one seat, then the side with the fixed seat already has one person, so the other seat on that side must be filled by one of the remaining 7. The other sides each have two seats, so they can be filled with two people each.\n\nWait, so the total number of people to seat is 7, and the remaining seats are:\n\n- 1 seat on the fixed side (needs 1 person)\n- 2 seats on each of the other three sides (each needs 2 people)\n\nWait, no, the total remaining seats are 1 (on fixed side) + 2+2+2 (on the other three sides) = 7 seats. The remaining 7 people must be assigned to these seats. Each seat is distinct because they are on different sides or different positions on the same side.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways is simply 7! (since each seat is distinct once we've fixed the first person's seat). However, the problem states that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. Since we fixed one seat, rotations are already accounted for, so the total number is 7!.\n\nBut 7! is 5040. However, the problem might have a different answer because sometimes in circular arrangements, we divide by the number of rotations, but here we fixed one seat, so it's linear.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says \"seated around a square table with 2 people on a side\". The key is that the table is square, so rotations are considered the same. By fixing one person's seat, we've eliminated rotational symmetry, so the remaining 7 can be arranged freely. Since each seat is a distinct position (due to the square's sides), the total is indeed 7!.\n\nHowever, another perspective: sometimes when arranging around"

Let me check the problem again: \"In how many ways can 8 people be seated around a square table with 2 people on a side? (Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.)\"\n\nAh, so it's not fixed seats; it's about circular arrangements where rotations are considered the same. Therefore, the formula for circular arrangements is typically (n-1)! for seating around a table. But here, it's a square table with 4 sides, each having 2 seats.\n\nWait, for a circular table with n seats, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! / 2 if considering rotations and reflections. But in this case, it's a square table, which is a specific type of circular table with 4 sides.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"around a square table with 2 people on a side\". So each side has 2 seats, making 8 seats in total. However, when considering rotational symmetry, the number of distinct seating arrangements is (8-1)! / 8 = 7! / 8 = 5040 / 8 = 630. But this might not be accurate because the table is square, and the symmetries include rotations and reflections.\n\nWait, no, typically for a circular table with n seats, the number of distinct seating arrangements is (n-1)! / 2 if considering rotations and reflections. But for a square table, which is a specific type of circular table with rotational and reflectional symmetries.\n\nIn our case, n=8 seats (since 4 sides × 2 seats = 8 seats). However, the problem mentions seating 8 people, so each seat is occupied. The number of distinct seating arrangements around a square table, considering rotations and reflections, is (8-1)! / (2 × 4) = 7! / 8 = 5040 / 8 = 630. But this is only if both rotations and reflections are considered equivalent. However, the problem states that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another, so reflections are considered different.\n\nWait, the problem says:"

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is (8-1)! / 4 = 7! / 4 = 5040 / 4 = 1260. But this is if we consider rotations only.\n\nWait, but actually, when arranging people around a circular table with rotational symmetry, the formula is (n-1)! because fixing one person and arranging the rest. Since the problem says rotations are considered the same, so fixing one person's seat, the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways. Therefore, the answer is 7!.\n\nWait, but the table is square, so the rotational symmetry is only 4-fold (rotations by 90°, 180°, 270°, and 0°). Therefore, the number of rotational symmetries is 4. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is total arrangements divided by 4. Total arrangements without considering rotation is 8!.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be 8! / 4 = 40320 / 4 = 10080. But this contradicts the previous thought.\n\nWait, confusion arises between circular tables and square tables. Let me clarify:\n\nFor a circular table with n seats, the number of distinct seating arrangements is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. For a square table, which has rotational symmetry of order 4 (rotations by 90°, 180°, etc.), the number of rotational symmetries is 4. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is 8! / 4 = 40320 / 4 = 10080.\n\nHowever, the problem states that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. Therefore, the formula is indeed total arrangements divided by the number of rotations (4). But the problem is that when arranging people around a square table, the seats are distinguishable by their positions (e.g., each side is a distinct position). However, if rotations are considered the same, then we divide by the number of rotations.\n\nAlternatively, fixing one person's seat to account for rotational symmetry, then arranging the remaining 7 people freely. Fixing one seat removes the rotational symmetry, so the number is 7!.\n\nTherefore, the answer"
