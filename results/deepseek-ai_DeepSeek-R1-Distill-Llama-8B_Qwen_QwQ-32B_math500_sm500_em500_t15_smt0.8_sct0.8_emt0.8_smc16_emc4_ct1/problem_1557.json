Since rotations of the table are considered equivalent, I'll use the concept of circular permutations but adjusted for the square structure.\n\nI'll start by fixing one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry. This leaves 7 people to be arranged around the table.\n\nNext, I'll consider the arrangements of these 7 people. In circular permutations, the number of ways to arrange n people is (n-1)! So, for 7 people, there are 6! = 720 ways.\n\nHowever, since the table is square and has equal sides, I need to account for reflections. If I hadn't fixed a position initially, reflections would also be considered equivalent. Therefore, I should divide the total number of arrangements by 2 to eliminate these symmetries.\n\nThus, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is 6! / 2 = 720 / 2 = 360.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Symmetries**\n\n- The table is **square**, meaning it has rotational and reflectional symmetries.\n- Two configurations are considered **equivalent** if one can be rotated or reflected to obtain the other.\n\n**Step 2: Use Circular Permutations**\n\n- Since the table is circular, we can use **circular permutations** to account for rotations.\n- However, because the table is square, we must also account for reflections.\n\n**Step 3: Fix a Person's Position**\n\n- To eliminate rotational symmetry, **fix one person's position** around the table.\n- This leaves 7 people to be arranged.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Permutations**\n\n- The number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) people in a circle is \\( (n-1)! \\).\n- Here, \\( n = 7 \\), so the number of arrangements is \\( 6! = 720 \\).\n\n**Step 5: Account for Reflections**\n\n- Because the table is square, we also need to account for reflections.\n- If not fixed, each arrangement could be mirrored, leading to overcounting.\n- Therefore, we divide by \\( 2 \\) to eliminate reflections.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n\\[\n\\"
