Let\u2019s denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B.\n\nThe total number of students is 35, so I can write the equation G + B = 35.\n\nIt's also given that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. So, G can be 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since there are only 35 students in total, G can only be 13 or 26 because 39 would exceed the total number of students.\n\nAdditionally, there are more girls than boys at the meeting, which means G > B. This gives me two possibilities:\n\n1. If G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. But 13 is not greater than 22, so this doesn't satisfy the condition.\n2. If G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. Here, 26 is greater than 9, which meets the requirement.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys attending the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Given:**\n1. Total number of students = 35\n2. \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13.\n3. \\( G > B \\)\n\n**Step 1: Express the total number of students as the sum of girls and boys.**\n\\[\nG + B = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the possible values for \\( G \\) that are multiples of 13 and less than or equal to 35.**\n\\[\nG = 13, 26, 39, \\ldots\n\\]\nSince \\( G \\leq 35 \\), the possible values are \\( G = 13 \\) and \\( G = 26 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Use the condition \\( G > B \\) to find the valid number of girls.**\n\n- **If \\( G = 13 \\):**\n  \\[\n  B = 35 - 13 = 22\n  \\]\n  However, \\( 13 > 22 \\) is false. Therefore, \\( G \\neq 13 \\).\n\n- **If \\( G = 26 \\):**\n  \\[\n  B = "
