            "output": "I need to determine the number of boys attending the math club meeting. There are 35 students in total, and the number of girls is a multiple of 13. Additionally, there are more girls than boys.\n\nFirst, let me denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. \nSo, G is a multiple of 13, and G > B.\n\nSince the total number of students is 35, I can write the equation:\nG + B = 35\n\nI need to find integer values of G and B that satisfy this equation, with G being a multiple of 13 and G > B.\n\nThe multiples of 13 are 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since the total number of students is 35, G can only be 13 or 26 because 39 is greater than 35.\n\nIf G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. But this contradicts the condition that G > B since 13 < 22.\n\nTherefore, G must be 26. Then, B = 35 - 26 = 9. This satisfies the condition because 26 > 9.\n\nSo, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys (B).\n\n**Let’s set up the equation:**\n\\[ G + B = 35 \\]\n\nSince \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13, possible values for \\( G \\) are 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since the total number of students is 35, \\( G \\) can only be 13 or 26 (because 39 > 35).\n\n**Case 1:** If \\( G = 13 \\),\n\\[ B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\]\nBut this contradicts \\( G > B \\) because 13 < 22.\n\n**Case 2:** If \\( G = 26 \\),\n\\[ B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\]\nThis satisfies \\( G > B \\) because 26 > 9.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
