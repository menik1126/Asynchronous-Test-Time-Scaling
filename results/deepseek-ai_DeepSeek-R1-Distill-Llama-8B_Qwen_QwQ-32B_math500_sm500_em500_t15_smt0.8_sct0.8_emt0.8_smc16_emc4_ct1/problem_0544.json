            "output": "First, I need to determine the average price of the stamps from the 1970s in Juan's collection. To do this, I'll identify how many stamps Juan owns from each country during the 70s and then calculate the total cost for that period.\n\nLooking at the chart, the 70s decade includes four rows, each representing a country with its corresponding price. Brazil is priced at 6 cents, France at 12 cents, Peru at 12 cents, and Spain at 6 cents.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of stamps for each country:\n- Brazil: 6 stamps × 6 cents = 36 cents\n- France: 12 stamps × 12 cents = 144 cents\n- Peru: 12 stamps × 12 cents = 144 cents\n- Spain: 6 stamps × 6 cents = 36 cents\n\nNow, I'll sum up the total number of stamps in the 70s:\n6 (Brazil) + 12 (France) + 12 (Peru) + 6 (Spain) = 36 stamps\n\nFinally, I'll compute the total cost for the 70s stamps:\n36 cents (Brazil) + 144 cents (France) + 144 cents (Peru) + 36 cents (Spain) = 360 cents\n\nTo find the average price per 70s stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the number of stamps:\n360 cents ÷ 36 stamps = 10 cents per stamp\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth of a cent, the average price is 10.0 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices for Each Country During the 70s:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\$6 \\text{ cents each}\n   - **France:** \\$12 \\text{ cents each}\n   - **Peru:** \\$12 \\text{ cents each}\n   - **Spain:** \\$6 \\text{ cents each}\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Stamps for Each Country in the 70s:**\n   - **Brazil:** \n     \\[\n     6 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents} = 36 \\text{ cents}\n     \\]\n   - **France:** \n     \\[\n     12 \\text{ stamps} \\times 12 \\text{ cents} ="

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
