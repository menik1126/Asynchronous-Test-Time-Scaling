Looking at the chart, Brazil has 12 stamps, France has 12 stamps, Peru has 12 stamps, and Spain has 13 stamps from the 70s. This means there are a total of 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 = 49 stamps from the 70s.\n\nNext, I'll determine the total cost of these 70s stamps. Brazil and France stamps cost $6$ cents each, so that's 6 * 12 = 72 cents for Brazil and 6 * 12 = 72 cents for France. Peru stamps cost $4$ cents each, which amounts to 4 * 12 = 48 cents. Spain stamps cost $5$ cents each, so that's 5 * 13 = 65 cents. Adding these together, the total cost is 72 + 72 + 48 + 65 = 257 cents.\n\nFinally, to find the average price per 70s stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the number of 70s stamps. So, 257 cents divided by 49 stamps equals approximately 5.24 cents per stamp. Rounding this to the nearest tenth gives 5.2 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s stamps**, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Number of 70s Stamps by Country:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 stamps\n   - **France:** 12 stamps\n   - **Peru:** 12 stamps\n   - **Spain:** 13 stamps\n   - **Total 70s stamps = 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 = 49 stamps**\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost of 70s Stamps:**\n   - **Brazil (6 cents each):** \\(6 \\times 12 = 72\\) cents\n   - **France (6 cents each):** \\(6 \\times 12 = 72\\) cents\n   - **Peru (4 cents each):** \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) cents\n   - **Spain (5 cents each):** \\(5 \\times 13 = 65\\) cents\n   - **Total 70s cost = 72 + 72 + 48 + 65 = 257\\) cents\n\n3. **Calculate the"
