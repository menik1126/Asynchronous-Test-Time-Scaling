When dealing these cards to \\( x \\) players, each player receives \\( y \\) cards. Therefore, the equation \\( x \\times y = 54 \\) must hold true.\n\nNext, I consider the constraints: \\( x \\) must be at least 2, and \\( y \\) must be at least 5. This means I'm only interested in the divisors of 54 that satisfy these conditions.\n\nTo find the possible values of \\( x \\), I'll list all the divisors of 54 and then eliminate those that don't meet the minimum requirements for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nStarting with the smallest possible \\( x \\), which is 2, I calculate \\( y \\) as \\( 54 \\div 2 = 27 \\). Since 27 is greater than or equal to 5, this is a valid solution.\n\nContinuing this process, I check the next divisor, 3, which gives \\( y = 18 \\). This also meets the requirement.\n\nNext, divisor 6 yields \\( y = 9 \\), which is still valid as it's above 5.\n\nDivisor 9 results in \\( y = 6 \\), which is acceptable.\n\nMoving to divisor 18, \\( y = 3 \\). However, 3 is less than 5, so this does not satisfy the conditions and is therefore excluded.\n\nFinally, divisor 27 leads to \\( y = 2 \\), which also doesn't meet the minimum requirement for \\( y \\), so it's eliminated.\n\nAfter evaluating all divisors, the valid values of \\( x \\) are 2, 3, 6, and 9. Counting these, there are 4 possible values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\) given the constraints, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationship:**\n   - Total cards: \\( 54 \\)\n   - Each player gets \\( y \\) cards.\n   - Number of players: \\( x \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( x \\times y = 54 \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Constraints:**\n   - \\( x \\) must be at least \\( 2 \\) (\\"
