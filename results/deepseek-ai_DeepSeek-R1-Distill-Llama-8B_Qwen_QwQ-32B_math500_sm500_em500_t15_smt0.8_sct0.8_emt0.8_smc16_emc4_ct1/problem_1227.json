            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7, given that n is congruent to 2 modulo 7. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with congruences, if n \u2261 a mod m, then expressions involving n can be simplified by substituting a in place of n and then reducing modulo m. So in this case, since n \u2261 2 mod 7, I can replace n with 2 in the expression (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) before doing any multiplication.\n\nLet me write that out: if n \u2261 2 mod 7, then n + 2 \u2261 2 + 2 \u2261 4 mod 7. Similarly, n + 4 \u2261 2 + 4 \u2261 6 mod 7, and n + 6 \u2261 2 + 6 \u2261 8 mod 7. Wait, 8 mod 7 is just 1, right? So, that simplifies each term.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes (4)(6)(1) mod 7. Let me compute that step by step. First, multiply 4 and 6. 4 times 6 is 24. Then, multiply that by 1, which is still 24. So, 24 mod 7.\n\nHmm, what's 24 divided by 7? Well, 7 times 3 is 21, and 24 minus 21 is 3. So, 24 mod 7 is 3. Therefore, the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7 is 3.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my substitution. Did I substitute correctly? Since n \u2261 2 mod 7, adding 2, 4, 6 each time does give 4, 6, and 1, respectively. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it as evaluating the polynomial (x + 2)(x + 4)(x + 6) at x = 2. So, substituting x = 2, that would be (4)(6)(8). But 8 is 1 mod 7, so again"

            "output": " 4*6*1 = 24, which mod 7 is 3. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expanding the expression first before substituting? Let me try that approach to confirm.\n\nLet me expand (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). First, multiply the first two factors: (n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 6n + 8. Then, multiply that by (n + 6):\n\n(n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) = n^3 + 6n^2 + 8n + 6n^2 + 36n + 48.\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Let me do it step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply n^2 by (n + 6): n^3 + 6n^2.\n\nThen, 6n times (n + 6): 6n^2 + 36n.\n\nThen, 8 times (n + 6): 8n + 48.\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n\nn^3 + 6n^2 + 6n^2 + 36n + 8n + 48.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn^3 + (6n^2 + 6n^2) = n^3 + 12n^2,\n\nthen (36n + 8n) = 44n,\n\nand the constant term is 48.\n\nSo the expanded form is n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48.\n\nHmm, but since we are working modulo 7, maybe I can reduce each coefficient modulo 7 first?\n\nLet me see:\n\n12 mod 7 is 5 (since 7*1=7, 12-7=5),\n\n44 mod 7: 7*6=42, so 44-42=2,\n\n48 mod 7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6, so 48 mod7 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial modulo 7 is:\n\nn^3 + 5n^2 + 2n + 6 mod7.\n\nNow, substitute n \u22612 mod7 into this polynomial.\n\nCompute each"
