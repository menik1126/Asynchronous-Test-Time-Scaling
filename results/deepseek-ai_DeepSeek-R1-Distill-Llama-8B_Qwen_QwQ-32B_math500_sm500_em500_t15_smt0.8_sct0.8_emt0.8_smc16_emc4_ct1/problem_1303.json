            "output": "First, I need to solve the equation \\(\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x-5}\\). To eliminate the fractions, I'll cross-multiply.\n\nMultiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of the other gives me \\(2(x - 5)\\) on one side and \\(3 \\times 4\\) on the other.\n\nExpanding the left side, I get \\(2x - 10\\), and the right side becomes 12.\n\nNext, I'll subtract 12 from both sides to set the equation to zero: \\(2x - 10 - 12 = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(2x - 22 = 0\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by adding 22 to both sides, resulting in \\(2x = 22\\). Dividing both sides by 2 gives me \\(x = 11\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{x-5}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cross-Multiply** to eliminate the fractions:\n   \\[\n   2(x - 5) = 3 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distribute** the 2 on the left side:\n   \\[\n   2x - 10 = 12\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate the variable term** by adding 10 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x = 22\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\)** by dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"
