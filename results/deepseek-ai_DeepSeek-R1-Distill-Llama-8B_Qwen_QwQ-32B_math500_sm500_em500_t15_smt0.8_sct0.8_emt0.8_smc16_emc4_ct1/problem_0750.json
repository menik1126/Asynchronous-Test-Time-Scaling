            "output": "First, I will simplify the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\) by calculating \\(2^3\\). This gives me 8.\n\nNext, I will divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate \\(3^x\\). So, \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\), which simplifies to \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nThen, I will express 9 as a power of 3. Since \\(3^2 = 9\\), the equation becomes \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nFinally, I will solve for \\(x\\) by setting the exponents equal to each other.
