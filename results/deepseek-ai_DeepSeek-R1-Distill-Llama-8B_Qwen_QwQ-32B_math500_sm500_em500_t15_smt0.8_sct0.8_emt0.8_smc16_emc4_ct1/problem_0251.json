            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) to a decimal, I first need to determine the length of the period of its decimal expansion when it becomes a repeating decimal.\n\nI know that the maximum possible period for a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) in its simplest form is \\(b - 1\\). In this case, since 31 and 11111 are both prime numbers, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible period is \\(11111 - 1 = 11110\\) digits. This means that the repeating sequence in the decimal expansion could be as long as 11110 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the repeating decimal of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), we can analyze the denominator.\n\n1. **Understand the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111}\n   \\]\n   Here, the denominator is \\(11111\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Period of Repeating Decimal:**\n   - The maximum possible length of the repeating sequence (period) for a decimal expansion of a fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is \\(b - 1\\), provided that the fraction is in its simplest form.\n   - Since \\(11111\\) is a prime number and \\(31\\) is also a prime number, the fraction \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Calculate the Maximum Possible Period:**\n   \\[\n   11111 - 1 = 11110\n   \\]\n   This means the decimal will repeat every \\(11110\\) digits.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The repeating decimal of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) has a period of \\(11110\\) digits.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11110}\n\\]"
