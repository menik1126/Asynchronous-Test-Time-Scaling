            "output": "To determine the number of digits that repeat in the decimal representation of 31/11111, I first need to understand the nature of the denominator.\n\nThe fraction is 31 divided by 11111. To find out if it results in a repeating decimal, I recall that a fraction will have a terminating decimal only if the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. Since 11111 is not of the form 2^n * 5^n, the decimal will indeed be repeating.\n\nNext, I need to find the length of the repeating cycle. The length of the repeating part of a fraction 1/n is related to the order of 10 modulo n. This means I need to determine the smallest positive integer k such that 10^k ≡ 1 mod 11111.\n\nCalculating this directly is challenging, so I'll factorize 11111 to simplify the problem. 11111 can be factored into 101 and 109, both of which are prime numbers. Therefore, the length of the repeating cycle will be the least common multiple of 101 and 109.\n\nThe least common multiple of 101 and 109 is 101 * 109 = 11009. This means the repeating cycle will have 11009 digits. However, this is quite large, and it's impractical to list them all out. To find the actual repeating sequence, I can perform long division of 31 by 11111, noting when the division starts to repeat.\n\nUpon performing the division, I observe that the quotient begins to repeat after a certain number of decimal places. Specifically, the repeating sequence is 0.002800278002800278..., where \"0028\" repeats indefinitely. Therefore, the repeating part of the decimal has 4 digits.\n\nSo, the repeating decimal form of 31/11111 is 0.002800278..., with \"0028\" repeating every 4 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Denominator\nThe denominator is \\(11111\\), which is not of the form \\(2^n \\times 5^n\\). This means that the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{31}{11111}\\) will be a **repeating decimal**.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Length of the Repeating Cycle\nThe length of the repeating"
