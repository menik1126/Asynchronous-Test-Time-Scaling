            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but I think I can break it down step by step. Let me write it down again to visualize it better: \u221b(x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) = 16.\n\nAlright, the equation involves a cube root, which I remember is the inverse operation of cubing something. So, if I have the cube root of something equals 16, then to get rid of the cube root, I should cube both sides of the equation. That makes sense because cubing the cube root should cancel it out, leaving me with the original expression on one side.\n\nSo, let me start by cubing both sides. On the left side, the cube root of (x\u00b2 - 4x + 4) cubed should just give me x\u00b2 - 4x + 4. And on the right side, 16 cubed is... hmm, 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Let me calculate that. 256 multiplied by 10 is 2560, and 256 multiplied by 6 is 1536, so adding those together is 2560 + 1536, which totals 4096. Okay, so after cubing both sides, the equation becomes x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 = 4096.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. So, I should move 4096 to the left side by subtracting it from both sides, which gives me x\u00b2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, so the equation is x\u00b2 - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation in the form of ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. To solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). Plugging in the values, that becomes x = [4 \u00b1 \u221a((-4)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-4092))]/(2*1).\n\nCalculating the discriminant inside"

            "output": " the square root first: (-4) squared is 16, and then 4 times 1 times -4092 is -16368. So, the discriminant is 16 - (-16368), which is the same as 16 + 16368, giving me 16384. Okay, so the square root of 16384. Hmm, I remember that 128 squared is 16384 because 128*128 is 16384. Let me check that: 100*100 is 10,000, 20*20 is 400, 8*8 is 64; but wait, 128*128 is actually (130 - 2)^2, which expands to 130\u00b2 - 2*130*2 + 2\u00b2. 130\u00b2 is 16900, 2*130*2 is 520, so 16900 - 520 is 16380, plus 4 is 16384. Yep, that's correct. So, the square root of 16384 is 128.\n\nSo, plugging back into the quadratic formula: x = [4 \u00b1 128]/2. That gives me two possible solutions: one where I add 4 and 128, and another where I subtract them. Let me calculate both.\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66.\n\nSecond solution: (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62.\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 66 and x = -62. But wait, the original equation had a cube root, which is an odd root, so negative numbers inside are okay, but let me just make sure both solutions satisfy the original equation because sometimes when we manipulate equations, especially squaring or cubing, we can introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nLet me check x = 66 first. Plugging it into the original equation: cube root of (66\u00b2 - 4*66 + 4). Let's compute 66\u00b2, which is 4356. Then, 4*66 is 264. So, 4356 - 264 is 4092, and then adding 4 gives 4096. So, cube root of 4096. Since 16\u00b3 is 4096, as I calculated earlier, that equals 16. So, that works.\n\nNow, checking x = -62: cube root of ((-62"

So, that works too.\n\nWait, so both solutions satisfy the original equation. But the question asks for the positive value of x. So, x = 66 is positive, and x = -62 is negative. So, the positive value is 66.\n\nI think that's it. So, I followed the steps: cubed both sides to eliminate the cube root, simplified the equation to a quadratic, applied the quadratic formula, found the two roots, and then verified both in the original equation to ensure they work. Since both do, and we're asked for the positive one, 66 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe equation is solved by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root, resulting in a quadratic equation. The quadratic formula is then applied, yielding two solutions. Both solutions are verified, and the positive one is selected.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1.
