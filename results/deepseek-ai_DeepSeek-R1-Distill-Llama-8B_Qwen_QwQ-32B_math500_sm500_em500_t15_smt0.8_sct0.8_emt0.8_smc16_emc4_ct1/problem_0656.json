This gives me the equation:\n\n10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says that two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This provides the second equation:\n\n2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I have two equations with three variables. To find the relationship between the weights, I can try to eliminate one variable.\n\nI'll use the second equation to express G in terms of T and S:\n\nG = S - 2T.\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for G into the first equation:\n\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T).\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n10T = 4S - 2T.\n\nAdding 2T to both sides gives:\n\n12T = 4S.\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\n3T = S.\n\nSo, one squig weighs the same as three treeks.\n\nTherefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n1. **Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.**\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G\n   \\]\n2. **Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.**\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S\n   \\]\n\n**Step 1:** From the second equation, express \\( G \\) in terms of \\( S \\) and \\( T \\):\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Substitute \\( G \\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Add \\( 2T \\) to both sides to gather like terms:\n\\[\n12T = 4S\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Divide both sides by 4 to simplify:\n\\"
