This gives me the equation:\n\n\\( 10T = 3S + G \\)\n\nNext, it's stated that two treeks and one goolee equal the weight of one squig:\n\n\\( 2T + G = S \\)\n\nI can substitute the second equation into the first to eliminate \\( G \\). Replacing \\( G \\) with \\( S - 2T \\) in the first equation:\n\n\\( 10T = 3S + (S - 2T) \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( 10T = 4S - 2T \\)\n\nCombining like terms by adding \\( 2T \\) to both sides:\n\n\\( 12T = 4S \\)\n\nDividing both sides by 4 gives:\n\n\\( 3T = S \\)\n\nTherefore, three treeks equal the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nWe need to determine how many treeks equal the weight of one squig.
