When multiplying like bases, you add the exponents. So, \\(r^3 \\times r^6 = r^{3+6} = r^9\\).\n\nNow, the numerator becomes \\(40r^9\\).\n\nFor the denominator, \\(8r^4\\) remains as it is since there's no multiplication needed.\n\nThe expression now is \\(\\frac{40r^9}{8r^4}\\).\n\nI can simplify the constants by dividing \\(40\\) by \\(8\\), which equals \\(5\\).\n\nWhen dividing variables with exponents, I subtract the exponents. So, \\(r^9 \\div r^4 = r^{9-4} = r^5\\).\n\nCombining these results, the simplified expression is \\(5r^5\\).\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators and denominators:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10r^3 \\times 4r^6}{8r^4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply the constants:**\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 4 = 40\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the variables with exponents:**\n   \\[\n   r^3 \\times r^6 = r^{3+6} = r^9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Rewrite the expression with the combined values:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40r^9}{8r^4}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the constants by dividing:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40}{8} = 5\n   \\]\n\n6. **Combine the variables by subtracting exponents:**\n   \\[\n   r^9 \\div r^4 = r^{9-4} = r^5\n   \\]\n\n7. **Combine the simplified constants and variables:**\n   \\[\n   5r^5\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5r^5}\n\\"
