The matrix M is given by its action on two vectors: it takes (2, -1) to (9, 3) and (1, -3) to (7, -1). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when a matrix acts on a vector, it transforms each component according to the matrix's columns. So if M is a 2x2 matrix, then M * (x, y) gives the new vector. To find M, maybe I should set up some equations based on the given transformations.\n\nLet me denote M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nSo when M acts on the vector (2, -1), it gives (9, 3). That means:\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, when M acts on (1, -3), it gives (7, -1). So:\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nAlright, so I have a system of four equations here:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. 2c - d = 3\n3. a - 3b = 7\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nNow I need to solve this system to find a, b, c, d. Let's see. Maybe solve for a and c first, and then b and d.\n\nStarting with equations 1 and 3, which both involve a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for b:\n\n2a - b = 9 => b = 2a - 9\n\nNow plug this into equation 3:\n\na - 3*(2a - 9) = 7\n\nSimplify:\n\na - 6a + 27 = 7\n-5a + 27 = 7\n-5a = 7 - 27\n-5a = -20\na = (-20)/(-5)"

Now, substitute back into b = 2a - 9:\n\nb = 2*4 - 9 = 8 - 9 = -1\n\nSo b is -1.\n\nNow moving to equations 2 and 4, which involve c and d.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2c - d = 3\nFrom equation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nLet's solve equation 2 for d:\n\n2c - d = 3 => d = 2c - 3\n\nSubstitute into equation 4:\n\nc - 3*(2c - 3) = -1\n\nSimplify:\n\nc - 6c + 9 = -1\n-5c + 9 = -1\n-5c = -10\nc = (-10)/(-5) = 2\n\nSo c is 2. Now substitute back into d = 2c - 3:\n\nd = 2*2 - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1\n\nSo d is 1.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the matrix M is:\n\nM = [4  -1]\n        [2   1]\n\nCool, so I found M. Now, what's next? The question is about finding the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. Hmm. So I need to transform the line y = 2x + 1 using matrix M.\n\nWait, how do I find the image of a line under a linear transformation represented by a matrix? I think I need to apply M to the line. But the line is a set of points, so maybe I can parametrize the line and then apply M to each point.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a linear transformation, the image of the line will be another line, specifically either the image of a point on the line plus the direction vector transformed by M. That might be a more efficient way.\n\nLet me recall that if you have a line defined by a point (x0, y0) and a direction vector (v1, v2), then the image of the line under M will be the line through M*(x0, y0) and M*(v1, v2), right?\n\nSo, first, I should find a point on the original line y = 2x + 1.

So, the direction vector is (1, 2).\n\nNow, I can apply matrix M to both the point (0, 1) and the direction vector (1, 2) to find the image of the point and the direction vector of the image line.\n\nLet me compute M*(0, 1) first.\n\nMultiplying M = [[4, -1], [2, 1]] with the vector (0, 1):\n\n= [4*0 + (-1)*1, 2*0 + 1*1]\n= [-1, 1]\n\nSo the point (0, 1) is mapped to (-1, 1).\n\nNext, apply M to the direction vector (1, 2):\n\n= [4*1 + (-1)*2, 2*1 + 1*2]\n= [4 - 2, 2 + 2]\n= [2, 4]\n\nSo the direction vector (1, 2) is mapped to (2, 4).\n\nNow, to find the image line, we can use the point (-1, 1) and direction vector (2, 4) to write the equation of the line.\n\nFirst, find the slope. The direction vector is (2, 4), so the slope is 4/2 = 2. So the new line has slope 2.\n\nNow, using the point (-1, 1), which is on the image line, we can write the equation using point-slope form:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\ny - 1 = 2(x - (-1))\ny - 1 = 2(x + 1)\ny - 1 = 2x + 2\ny = 2x + 3\n\nSo is that it? Wait, let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the parametric equations. Suppose the image line can be represented parametrically. Let t be a parameter.\n\nStarting at (-1, 1), and adding the direction vector (2, 4)t. So any point on the image line is (-1 + 2t, "

To convert this to Cartesian form, solve for t in terms of x:\n\nx = -1 + 2t => t = (x + 1)/2\n\nThen substitute into y:\n\ny = 1 + 4t = 1 + 4*( (x +1)/2 ) = 1 + 2(x +1) = 1 + 2x + 2 = 2x + 3\n\nSame result. So that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original line is y = 2x +1, which is affine, not a subspace, so the transformation is linear, but the line is affine. So the image should also be an affine line. But since linear transformations preserve lines, that's okay.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the general approach of applying the transformation to the equation of the line.\n\nAlternatively, another method: Let me consider that any point (x, y) on the original line satisfies y = 2x +1. The image of this point under M is (4x - y, 2x + y). Because M is [[4, -1], [2, 1]], so:\n\nM*(x, y) = (4x - y, 2x + y)\n\nSo, substituting y = 2x +1 into this, the image point (X, Y) is:\n\nX = 4x - y = 4x - (2x +1) = 4x -2x -1 = 2x -1\n\nY = 2x + y = 2x + (2x +1) = 4x +1\n\nSo now, we have X = 2x -1 and Y = 4x +1. Now, we can express Y in terms of X.\n\nFrom X = 2x -1, solve for x:\n\nX = 2x -1 => 2x = X +1 => x = (X +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into Y:\n\nY = 4*( (X +1)/2 ) +1 = 2*(X +1) +1 = 2X +2 +1 = 2X +3\n\nTherefore, Y = 2X +3, so in terms of the original variables, the image line is y = 2x"

            "output": " +3.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before! So that's consistent.\n\nSo that's my final answer: y = 2x +3.\n\nI think that's right, but just to double-check, maybe I should verify with a different point.\n\nLet me take another point on the original line y = 2x +1. Let's choose x=1: y=3, so (1,3). Let's apply M to this point.\n\nM*(1,3) = [4*1 + (-1)*3, 2*1 +1*3] = [4 -3, 2 +3] = (1,5)\n\nSo the point (1,3) is mapped to (1,5). Now, let's see if this point is on the line y =2x +3.\n\nPlugging in x=1: y=2*1 +3 =5. Yep, it works. So that point is on the image line.\n\nAnother point, say x=2: y=5. So point (2,5). Apply M:\n\nM*(2,5)= [4*2 + (-1)*5, 2*2 +1*5] = [8 -5, 4 +5] = (3,9). Does this lie on y=2x +3? y=2*3 +3=9. Yes.\n\nPerfect, both points lie on the image line y=2x +3. So that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the image of the line y =2x +1 under M is y=2x +3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe image of the line is \\boxed{y = 2x + 3}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the image of the line \\( y = 2x + 1 \\) under the matrix \\( \\mathbf{M} \\), we first determine the matrix \\( \\mathbf{M} \\) using the given transformations.
