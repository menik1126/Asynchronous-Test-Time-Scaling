            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem about linear transformations, specifically matrix transformations. It seems like I need to find the image of a line under a given matrix. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that matrix M transforms the vector [2, -1] to [9, 3] and [1, -3] to [7, -1]. So, M is a 2x2 matrix that takes these two vectors to their respective images. Since M is a linear transformation, it will transform any vector in the domain to a vector in the codomain.\n\nMy goal is to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. That means I need to find what happens to every point (x, y) on the line y = 2x + 1 when we apply the transformation M. In other words, if I plug (x, y) into M, what does y become in terms of x after the transformation?\n\nTo do this, I should first figure out what matrix M is. Once I have M, I can apply it to any point on the line y = 2x + 1, which will give me a new point (x', y'), and I can then express y' in terms of x' to get the equation of the image line.\n\nSo, how do I find matrix M? Well, since M maps [2, -1] to [9, 3] and [1, -3] to [7, -1], I can set up equations based on the definition of matrix multiplication.\n\nLet me denote the columns of M as [a, b] and [c, d]. So, the matrix M looks like:\n\nM = [a b]\n    [c d]\n\nThen, multiplying M by the vector [2, -1] gives [9, 3], which can be written as:\n\n[a  b] [2]   = [9]\n[c  d] [-1]    [3]\n\nSimilarly, multiplying M by [1, -3] gives [7, -1], so:\n\n[a  b] [1]   = [7]\n[c  d] [-3]    [-1]\n\nSo, this gives me a system of equations:\n\n1. a*2 + b*(-1) = 9\n2. c*2 + d*(-1) = 3\n3. a"

Let's try elimination.\n\nMultiply the first equation by 3 to make the coefficients of b opposites:\n\nFirst equation multiplied by 3: 6a - 3b = 27\n\nSecond equation: a - 3b = 7\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(6a - 3b) - (a - 3b) = 27 - 7\n\n6a - 3b - a + 3b = 20\n\n5a = 20 => a = 4\n\nNow plug a = 4 into equation 1: 2*4 - b = 9 => 8 - b = 9 => -b = 1 => b = -1\n\nSo, a = 4, b = -1.\n\nNow, moving on to equations 2 and 4 for c and d.\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d = 3\n\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nAgain, let's use elimination.\n\nLet me multiply equation 2 by 3 to get:\n\n6c - 3d = 9\n\nEquation 4 is c - 3d = -1\n\nSubtract equation 4 from the multiplied equation:\n\n(6c - 3d) - (c - 3d) = 9 - (-1)\n\n6c - 3d - c + 3d = 10\n\n5c = 10 => c = 2\n\nNow plug c = 2 into equation 2: 2*2 - d = 3 => 4 -"
