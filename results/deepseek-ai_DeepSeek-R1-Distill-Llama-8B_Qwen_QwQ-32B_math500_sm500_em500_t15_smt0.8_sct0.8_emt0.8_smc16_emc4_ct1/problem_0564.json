            "output": "To solve the problem, I'll start by considering the circular arrangement of the Senate committee. Since the table is circular, rotational arrangements are considered equivalent.\n\nNext, I'll determine the number of ways to arrange the blocks of party members around the table. There are three parties: Democrats, Republicans, and Independent. This means there are three distinct blocks to arrange.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these blocks around a circular table is (3-1)! which equals 2! So, there are 2 ways to arrange the blocks.\n\nFinally, for each arrangement of the blocks, I'll calculate the number of ways to arrange the members within each party. There are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. The number of ways to arrange the Democrats is 5!, the Republicans is also 5!, and the Independent has only 1 way to arrange. Multiplying these together gives 5! × 5! × 1! = 120 × 120 × 1 = 14,400.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is the number of block arrangements multiplied by the number of internal arrangements, which is 2 × 14,400 = 28,800.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA Senate committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if all the members of each party all sit next to each other? (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understanding Circular Arrangements:**\n   - Since the table is circular, rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new unique seating.\n   - Therefore, we can fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\n2. **Forming Blocks of Each Party:**\n   - All Democrats must sit together as a block.\n   - All Republicans must sit together as a block.\n   - The Independent sits alone as another block.\n   - This results in three blocks: **D** (Democrats), **R** (Republicans), and **I** (Independent).\n\n3. **Arranging the Blocks Around the Table:**\n   - Fix one block's position to account for circular rotations (e.g., fix the Independent's position).\n   - Now, arrange the remaining two blocks (**D** and **R**) around the table.\n   -"
