There are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. \n\nFirst, I'll consider the circular arrangement, which typically has (n-1)! possible arrangements for n people. However, since the parties must sit together, the problem simplifies by treating each party as a single unit or \"block.\"\n\nThe three blocks are:\n1. Democrats (D)\n2. Republicans (R)\n3. Independent (I)\n\nThese blocks can be arranged around the table in different orders. Since it's a circular arrangement, there are (3-1)! = 2! ways to arrange the blocks, which is 2 ways: either D-R-I or R-D-I.\n\nNext, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. The Democrats can be arranged in 5! ways, the Republicans in 5! ways, and the Independent has only 1 way since it's a single person.\n\nTo find the total number of seating arrangements, I'll multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the people within each block: 2! * 5! * 5!.\n\nTherefore, the total number of seating arrangements is 2 * 120 * 120 = 28,800.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table with the condition that all members of each party sit next to each other, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Treat Each Party as a Single Unit\nSince all members of each party must sit together, we can think of each party as a single \"block.\" There are three blocks:\n- **Democrats (D)**\n- **Republicans (R)**\n- **Independent (I)**\n\n### Step 2: Arrange the Blocks Around the Table\nSince the table is circular, the number of ways to arrange **n** blocks is **(n-1)!**. Here, we have **3** blocks, so the number of ways to arrange them is:\n\\[\n(3-1)! = 2! = 2 \\text{ ways} \\quad (\\text{either D-R-I or R-D-I})\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Arrange the Members Within Each Block\n- **Democrats:** There are **5** Democrats, so they"
