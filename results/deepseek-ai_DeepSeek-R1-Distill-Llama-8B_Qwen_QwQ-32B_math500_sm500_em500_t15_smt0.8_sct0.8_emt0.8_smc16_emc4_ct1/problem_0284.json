The series alternates between subtraction and addition of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to 100.\n\nNext, I'll group the terms in pairs to simplify the calculation:\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + ... + (99 - 100).\n\nEach pair of terms simplifies to -1:\n-1 + (-1) + (-1) + ... + (-1).\n\nThere are 50 such pairs in total, so the series simplifies to:\n-1 multiplied by 50, which equals -50.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the series is -50.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the series \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Series:**\n   \\[\n   1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100\n   \\]\n   This is an alternating series where each positive integer is followed by a negative integer.\n\n2. **Group the Terms:**\n   For easier calculation, group the terms in pairs:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify Each Pair:**\n   Each pair simplifies to \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   -1 + (-1) + (-1) + \\dots + (-1)\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Determine the Number of Pairs:**\n   Since there are 100 terms in total and each pair consists of 2 terms, there are:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ pairs}\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Calculate the Total:**\n   Summing 50 instances of \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   50 \\times (-1) = -50\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
