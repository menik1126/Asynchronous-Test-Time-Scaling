            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem about arranging a Senate committee around a circular table. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The committee has 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent. The condition is that all members of each party must sit next to each other. Also, two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.\n\nFirst, I remember that when arranging people around a circular table, the number of arrangements is usually (n-1)! because rotations are considered equivalent. But here, it's more complicated because we have groups that need to sit together.\n\nSo, let's think about this. The committee has three groups: Democrats, Republicans, and an Independent. The problem says each party's members must sit next to each other. That sounds like each group has to form a single block or segment around the table.\n\nSince it's a circular table, these blocks can be arranged in different ways, but we have to account for rotations. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, how many ways can we arrange the three blocks around the table? If we treat each party group as a single unit, we have three units: D (Democrats), R (Republicans), and I (Independent). Normally, the number of ways to arrange n units around a circular table is (n-1)! So, for 3 units, it would be (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways. But wait, is that all?\n\nHmm, not quite. Because each party has multiple members, the order within each block matters. So, within the Democrat block, there are 5 members, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways, and the Independent is just one person, so only 1! way.\n\nSo, the total number of arrangements would be the number of ways to arrange the blocks multiplied by the number of ways to arrange each block internally.\n\nPutting it all together: (number of block arrangements) \u00d7 (internal arrangements) = 2! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 1!.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check. Is the number of block arrangements really 2? Because in a circular arrangement, sometimes you have to consider reflections or other symmetries, but the problem doesn't mention that. It only mentions rotations as equivalent, so reflections would be different. So,"

            "output": " the number of ways to arrange the three blocks around the table is indeed (3-1)! = 2!.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose the three blocks are D, R, I. The circular arrangements would be considered the same if rotated. So, fixing one block's position to account for rotation, then arranging the other two. For example, fix the Independent's block at a certain position, then arrange the D and R blocks next to them. Wait, but the Independent is a single person, so maybe that complicates things?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Independent is just a single block, so the three blocks are D, R, I. Since the table is circular, arranging three blocks around it would be (3-1)! = 2 ways. So that part is okay.\n\nTherefore, the total arrangements would be 2 \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 1!.\n\nWait, but hold on another thought. The Independent is a single person, so their block is just themselves. So when arranging the blocks, the Independent's position is fixed? Or can they be placed anywhere?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the blocks as three entities: D, R, and I. Since the Independent is a single person, their block is just one seat. But when arranging the blocks around the table, each block takes up a certain number of seats. The Democrats take 5 seats, Republicans 5, and Independent 1. So the total number of seats is 5+5+1=11. But since it's a circular table, the arrangement is considered up to rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way to approach this is to first consider the blocks as units, then multiply by the internal arrangements.\n\nSo, first, arrange the three blocks around the table. Since it's circular, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is (3-1)! = 2!.\n\nThen, within each block, arrange the members. For Democrats: 5!, Republicans: 5!, and Independent: 1!.\n\nTherefore, total arrangements would be 2! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5!.\n\nWait, but the Independent is a single person, so their internal arrangement is 1!.\n\nSo that gives 2 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 120 = 2 \u00d7 14400 = 28800? That seems high, but maybe that's correct?\n\nWait, but let me think again."

            "output": " Is the number of ways to arrange the blocks around the table (n-1)! or not? Let me see. If we have three blocks, each block is a sequence of people. So, when arranging around the table, the number of distinct arrangements is indeed (3-1)! because we can fix one block and arrange the other two relative to it. So that would give 2 ways.\n\nBut another way to think about it is, if the blocks are distinguishable (which they are: D, R, I), then the number of circular arrangements is (number of linear arrangements)/number of seats. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nAlternatively, think of the blocks as three items to be placed around the table, which can be done in (3-1)! ways because circular permutations.\n\nSo yes, (3-1)! = 2.\n\nThen, each block can be internally arranged, so D has 5! ways, R has 5! ways, and I has 1! way.\n\nThus, total arrangements would be 2 \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5! = 2 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 120 = 2 \u00d7 14400 = 28,800.\n\nHmm, but wait. Let me make sure that in fixing the position, I'm not undercounting or overcounting.\n\nAnother approach: the number of ways to arrange these blocks is similar to arranging three people around a table, where each person has a different number of seats. The formula for circular arrangements with blocks is (k-1)! where k is the number of blocks, so here k=3, so (3-1)! = 2.\n\nThus, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes when we have blocks, the formula is (number of blocks -1)! times the product of internal permutations. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, yeah, 2! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5! = 28,800. That seems like the answer. But wait, let me think again.\n\nAnother perspective: Maybe if I fix the position of one of the blocks to eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\nSuppose I fix the Democrat block at a certain position. Then, the remaining two blocks, Republicans and Independent, can be arranged in 2! ways around the table.\n\nThen, within the Democrat block, arrange the 5 members: 5! ways.\n\nWithin the Republican block: 5! ways.\n\nWithin the Independent: 1"

So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I fix the Independent's position, since they are a single person, maybe that's another way to think. Let me see.\n\nSuppose we fix the Independent in a specific seat to account for the rotation. Then, the remaining 10 seats are divided into two blocks: Democrats and Republicans, each of 5 seats. The two blocks can be arranged in 2! ways (either D to the left of I and R to the right, or R to the left and D to the right). Then, within each block, arrange the members: 5! each. So total arrangements would be 2 \u00d7 5! \u00d75!.\n\nSame result again. So that's 2\u00d7120\u00d7120 = 28,800. So that seems to confirm it.\n\nWait, but in this case, when we fix the Independent's seat, the two blocks (D and R) can be arranged in 2! ways. So that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the Independent is fixed, then the two party blocks can be arranged in 2 ways, and then each block's internal arrangements. So that gives the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 2\u00d75!\u00d75!.\n\nCalculating that: 5! is 120, so 120\u00d7120 = 14,400, times 2 is 28,800. So 28,800 ways.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a mistake here. For example, is the Independent considered a block? Since they are alone, their block is just themselves, so they can be placed anywhere, but since we have to have all party members together, the Independent is just a single block. So the three blocks are D, R, and I. So the initial reasoning holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Independent can be placed between the two parties, but since they are a single person, their block is just one seat. So the arrangement of the three blocks (D, R, I) around the table would have to account for their positions. Since it's circular, the number of arrangements"

            "output": " is (3-1)! = 2.\n\nSo yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. If all three blocks have to sit together, is there a possibility that the order of the blocks affects the total? For example, does the arrangement D-R-I count separately from R-I-D? But in our calculation, we have 2! which covers those two possibilities.\n\nSo, yeah, that's already accounted for.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of arrangements is 2\u00d75!\u00d75! = 28,800.\n</think>\n\nThe Senate committee consists of three blocks: Democrats, Republicans, and an Independent. To account for circular arrangements, we fix the position of one block, then arrange the remaining two. The number of ways to arrange the blocks is (3-1)! = 2!. Each block can internally be arranged in 5!, 5!, and 1! ways respectively. Thus, the total number of arrangements is 2! \u00d7 5! \u00d7 5! = 28,800.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{28800}"
