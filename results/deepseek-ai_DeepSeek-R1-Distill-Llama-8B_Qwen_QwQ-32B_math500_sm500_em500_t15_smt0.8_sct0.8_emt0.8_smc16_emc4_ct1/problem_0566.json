            "output": "First, I need to determine how the members are grouped. There are three parties: Democrats, Republicans, and one Independent. Each party's members must sit together, so this forms three distinct groups.\n\nNext, since the seating is around a circular table, I should fix the position of one group to eliminate rotational symmetry. Fixing the Independent's position simplifies the problem because rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.\n\nNow, I can arrange the three groups around the table. With the Independent fixed, there are 2 possible ways to arrange the remaining two parties: either Democrats first and Republicans next, or Republicans first and Democrats next.\n\nFor each of these arrangements, the members within each party can be arranged among themselves. Each party has 5 members, so for Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange them, and similarly 5! ways for Republicans.\n\nFinally, I multiply the number of ways to arrange the parties by the number of ways to arrange the members within each party to get the total number of distinct seatings.\n\nSo, the calculations are as follows: 2 (arrangements of parties) multiplied by 5! (Democrats) multiplied by 5! (Republicans), which gives 2 × 120 × 120 = 28,800.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways the Senate committee can be seated around a circular table with all members of each party sitting together, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Groups**:\n   - **Democrats**: 5 members\n   - **Republicans**: 5 members\n   - **Independent**: 1 member\n\n2. **Arrange the Groups Around the Table**:\n   - Since the table is circular, we can fix the position of one group to eliminate rotational symmetry. Let's fix the Independent's seat.\n   \n3. **Determine the Order of the Groups**:\n   - There are 2 possible ways to arrange the remaining two groups (Democrats and Republicans) around the table:\n     - Democrats first, followed by Republicans.\n     - Republicans first, followed by Democrats.\n\n4. **Arrange the Members Within Each Group**:\n   - For each arrangement of the groups, the members within each party can be arranged among themselves:\n     - Democrats: \\(5!\\) ways\n     - Republicans: \\(5!\\) ways\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of Seatings**:\n   - Multiply the number of ways to arrange the groups by the number of ways"
