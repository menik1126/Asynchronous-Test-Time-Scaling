Therefore, I should fix the position of one person to eliminate equivalent rotations.\n\nNext, I'll consider the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent as three separate blocks. Each block must maintain the order of its members because they all sit next to each other.\n\nFor the Democrats, there are 5 seats, so they can be arranged in 5! ways. Similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways, and the Independent can be arranged in just 1 way since there's only one person.\n\nNow, I need to determine the number of ways to arrange these three blocks around the table. Since the table is circular and one block is already fixed, there are 2 remaining \"blocks\" to arrange. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the blocks is 2!.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply all these possibilities together to get the total number of distinct seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem Constraints**\n- **Circular Table:** Arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered identical.\n- **Groupings:** All Democrats must sit together, all Republicans must sit together, and the Independent must sit alone.\n\n**Step 2: Fix a Position to Eliminate Rotational Symmetry**\n- Since the table is circular, fixing one person's position helps avoid counting rotations as distinct.\n- Let's fix the Independent's seat.\n\n**Step 3: Arrange the Groups Around the Fixed Independent**\n- Now, we need to arrange the two groups (Democrats and Republicans) around the fixed Independent.\n- The number of ways to arrange two groups around a fixed person is \\(2!\\).\n\n**Step 4: Arrange Members Within Each Group**\n- **Democrats:** Can be arranged in \\(5!\\) ways.\n- **Republicans:** Can be arranged in \\(5!\\) ways.\n- **Independent:** Only 1 way.\n\n**Step 5: Multiply the Possibilities**\n- Total number of arrangements = (Number of ways to arrange groups) × (Number of ways to arrange Democrats) × (Number of ways to arrange Republicans).\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\\[\n2! \\times"
