            "output": "To solve the problem, I start by recognizing that the group is arranged around a circular table, which means rotations of the same seating are considered identical.\n\nNext, I consider the requirement that all members of each party must sit together. This suggests treating each party as a single unit or \"block\" when planning the seating arrangement.\n\nThere are three such blocks: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Since the table is circular, the number of ways to arrange these blocks around the table is (3-1)! = 2! = 2 ways.\n\nAfter arranging the blocks, I need to consider the internal arrangement within each block. Each block has 5 members, so the number of ways to arrange them is 5! for each party.\n\nFinally, I multiply the number of arrangements for the blocks by the internal arrangements of each block to get the total number of distinct seating arrangements.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is 2! × (5!) × (5!) × (5!). Simplifying this gives the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for the Senate committee around a circular table, where each party's members must sit together, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Treat Each Party as a Single Unit:**\n   - Since all members of each party must sit together, we can consider each party as a single \"block\" or unit.\n   - There are 3 parties: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.\n   - Arranging \\( n \\) blocks around a circular table is \\((n-1)!\\). Here, \\( n = 3 \\), so the number of ways to arrange the blocks is \\( (3-1)! = 2! = 2 \\) ways.\n\n2. **Arrange Members Within Each Party:**\n   - Each party block has 5 members.\n   - The number of ways to arrange 5 members within a single block is \\( 5! \\).\n   - Since there are 3 parties, the total number of internal arrangements is \\( 5! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Arrangements:**\n   - Multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of internal arrangements:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Arrangements} = 2! \\times (5!) \\times (5!) \\times (5!)\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the factorials"
