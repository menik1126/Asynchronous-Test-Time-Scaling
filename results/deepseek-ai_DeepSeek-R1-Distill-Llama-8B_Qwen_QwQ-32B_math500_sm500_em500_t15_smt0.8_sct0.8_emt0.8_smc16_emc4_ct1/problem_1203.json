The direction vector is given as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\). The line is parameterized, and from the Asymptote code provided, it seems like we're dealing with a line that's drawn on a grid with points A, B, L, and R. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The Asymptote code is drawing a grid from -8 to 8 on both the x and y axes. Points A and B are given as (-5,4) and (-1,3) respectively. Then, points L and R are the intersections of the line AB with the vertical lines x = -8 and x = 8. The line LR is drawn in red, which I assume is the line whose direction vector we're interested in.\n\nSo, the line LR is the line extending from x = -8 to x = 8, and it's the same line as AB. Therefore, the direction vector of LR should be the same as the direction vector of AB. But the problem says the direction vector is of the form \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\). Hmm, that's interesting because the change in x from A to B is (-1 - (-5)) = 4, so if the direction vector is given as (-7, b), that suggests that the line might have a slope, but the x-component is scaled by -7. Maybe it's related to the line's slope or something else.\n\nWait, let me think again. The direction vector is given as (-7, b), so that would mean for every 1 unit increase in x, the y changes by b, but scaled by -7 in x. Hmm, that might not directly give the slope because the slope is usually (delta y)/(delta x). If the direction vector is (-7, b), then the slope would be b/(-7) or -b/7.\n\nBut wait, the actual slope of line AB is (3 - 4)/( -1 - (-5)) = (-1)/4 = -1/4. So the slope should be -1/4. Therefore, if the direction vector is (-7, b), then the slope would be b / (-7)"

Wait, let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction vector is calculated from points A and B. The direction vector from A to B is (B - A) = (-1 - (-5), 3 - 4) = (4, -1). That's a direction vector of (4, -1). But the problem states that the direction vector should be (-7, b). But direction vectors can be scalar multiples of each other. So maybe we need to find a scalar multiple such that the direction vector (4, -1) is proportional to (-7, b). \n\nSo if there's a scalar k such that (4, -1) = k*(-7, b). But that would mean 4 = -7k, so k = -4/7, and then the second component would be -1 = k*b => -1 = (-4/7)*b => b = (-1)*(-7/4) = 7/4. \n\nBut the question says the direction vector is of the form (-7, b). So maybe they just need the value of b such that the direction vector is a scalar multiple of the original direction vector from points A to B. So since the direction vector (4, -1) can be scaled to (-7, b), the scaling factor needs to be negative. Wait, 4 divided by -7 would be the scaling factor for the x-component. But let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction vector is written in such a way that the x-component is -7, so we need to find the corresponding y-component. Since direction vectors can be scaled, we can take the original direction vector (4, -1) and find the multiple that would make the x-component -7. \n\nThe original direction vector is (4, -1). If we scale this by a factor t, then the new direction vector would be (4t, -1t). We want 4t = -7, so t = -7/4. Then the y-component would be -1 * (-7/4) = 7/4. Therefore, b is 7/4. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting the direction vector of the line LR. Since the line passes through points"

But the direction vector given is (-7, b), so perhaps this vector is a scalar multiple of (16, y2 - y1). \n\nWait, if that's the case, then 16 and y2 - y1 should be proportional to -7 and b. So (16)/(-7) should be equal to (y2 - y1)/b, so they have the same ratio. But I don't know y2 and y1. Maybe I can find them using the equation of the line AB.\n\nGiven points A(-5,4) and B(-1,3), the equation of the line AB can be found. First, let's find the slope m: (3 - 4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4. So the slope is -1/4. Then, the equation is y - 4 = (-1/4)(x - (-5)) \u2192 y - 4 = (-1/4)(x +5). So y = (-1/4)x -5/4 +4 \u2192 y = (-1/4)x + 11/4. \n\nTherefore, the equation of the line AB is y = (-1/4)x + 11/4. So, to find points L and R, which are the intersections of this line with x = -8 and x =8. \n\nSo plug in x = -8: y = (-1/4)*(-8) + 11/4 = 2 + 11/4 = 15/4. So point L is (-8, 15/4).\n\nSimilarly, plug in x =8: y = (-1/4)*(8) +11/4 = -2 + 11/4 = ( -8/4 +11/4 )= 3/4. So point R is (8, 3/4).\n\nTherefore, the direction vector of LR is R - L = (8 - (-8), 3/4 - 15/4) = (16, -12). So direction vector is (16, -12).

Then from the second, b = (-12)/k = (-12)/(-16/7) = (12 *7)/16 = 84/16 = 21/4. So b would be 21/4. But that contradicts the earlier result.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So earlier when considering the direction vector from A to B, we found b was 7/4, but when considering the direction vector from L to R, we get b as 21/4.\n\nBut the problem says \"the line is parameterized, so that its direction vector is of the form \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\\).\" So depending on which direction we take, the direction vector can be either (4, -1) scaled to (-7, 7/4) or (16, -12) scaled to (-7, 21/4). But perhaps in the problem, the direction vector is considered as a vector that is the difference between A and B or L and R. But Asymptote code says \"draw(L--R, red);\" so the line is LR, so the direction vector is R - L = (16, -12). So maybe we should scale that to get the direction vector with x-component -7. So direction vector (16, -12) can be scaled by k = (-7)/16. So then the x-component is 16*(-7/16) = -7, y-component is -12*(-7/16) = 12*(7)/16 = 84/16 = 21/4. Therefore, b is 21/4.\n\nBut earlier, when taking direction vector from A to B, scaling gave us b =7/4, but from L to R, it's 21/4. So perhaps the problem is specifically referring to the direction from L to R? Or maybe it's a different direction.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, the line is drawn from L to R, so that's from (-8, 15/4) to (8,"

If we take L to R as (16, -12), then the direction vector in the opposite direction would be (-16, 12). So if we want a direction vector with x-component -7, then scaling factor would be (-7)/-16 = 7/16? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction vector is given as (-7, b), so we can set up the direction vector (16, -12) proportional to (-7, b). So 16 / (-7) = (-12)/b \u2192 cross multiplying, 16b = (-7)(-12) \u2192 16b = 84 \u2192 b = 84/16 = 21/4. So that's the same as before.

Then t is -7/4, so b = (-1)*(-7/4) = 7/4. \n\nBut the problem says \"the following line is parameterized, so that its direction vector is of the form...\". The line in the figure is the red one, connecting L and R, so the parameterization is from L to R. So the direction vector is R - L, which is (16, -12). Therefore, the scaling factor is (-7)/16, leading to b =21/4.\n\nBut wait, 21/4 is 5.25, whereas 7/4 is 1.75. Which one is correct? Maybe I should check the figure.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, the line is drawn from L to R, red. So the direction is from L(-8,15/4) to R(8,3/4). The direction vector is (16, -12). The problem says the direction vector is (-7, b), so (16, -12) must be a multiple of (-7, b). \n\nSo 16 = (-7)*k and -12 = b*k.\n\nFrom 16 = (-7)k \u2192 k = -16/7.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation: -12 = b*(-16/7) \u2192 -12 = (-16b)/7 \u2192 Multiply both sides by 7: -84 = -16b \u2192 Divide both sides by -16: b = 84/16 = 21/4.\n\nSo that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if the direction vector was from R to L, it would be (-16,12).

Since the line LR goes from x=-8 to x=8, so the direction from L to R is towards positive x, but the direction vector given has a negative x-component. So maybe the direction vector is pointing from R to L? Because the x-component is -7. So if the direction vector is from R to L, then the direction vector is (-16,12). So scaling that to get x-component -7, then the scaling factor is (-7)/(-16)=7/16, so y-component is 12*(7/16)=21/4. So that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the direction vector in any direction, so as long as it's a direction vector for the line, so the direction vector can be in either direction. So the slope is -12/16 = -3/4, so the direction vector (16, -12) has a slope of -3/4. The given direction vector (-7, b) must have the same slope. So slope is b / (-7) = -3/4 \u2192 b = (-7)*(-3/4) = 21/4. \n\nAh, that's a simpler way. Since the direction vector's slope must equal the line's slope. The line's slope is (from points A and B) (3-4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/4 = -1/4. Wait, hold on, that contradicts the previous calculation.

So the slope is (3 - 4)/[ -1 - (-5) ] = (-1)/(4) = -1/4. \n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the equation of the line, I got y = (-1/4)x + 11/4, which is correct.

So delta y is 3/4 -15/4 = (-12)/4 = -3. Delta x is 8 - (-8)=16. So slope is -3/16. Wait, but the slope of AB was -1/4. So that would mean that the slope from L to R is different? That can't be because they are the same line.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, the line AB when extended to x=-8 and x=8, which are vertical lines, so L and R are points on AB. Therefore, the slope between L and R should be the same as the slope of AB. So let me recalculate the slope.\n\nSlope is (3/4 -15/4) divided by (8 - (-8)) = (-12/4)/16 = (-3)/16.
