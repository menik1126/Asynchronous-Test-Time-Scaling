            "output": "First, I recognize that to convert a decimal number to base six, I need to express it as a sum of powers of six.\n\nI'll start by determining the highest power of six that is less than or equal to 999.\n\nCalculating 6^0 is 1, 6^1 is 6, 6^2 is 36, 6^3 is 216, and 6^4 is 1296. Since 1296 is greater than 999, I'll use 6^3, which is 216.\n\nNext, I'll find how many times 216 fits into 999. Dividing 999 by 216 gives approximately 4.629. Taking the integer part, I get 4. So, the coefficient for 6^3 is 4.\n\nNow, I'll subtract 4 times 216 from 999 to get the remainder. That is, 999 minus 864 equals 135.\n\nMoving on to the next lower power, which is 6^2 = 36, I'll divide 135 by 36 to find the next coefficient. This gives approximately 3.75, and taking the integer, I get 3. So, the coefficient for 6^2 is 3.\n\nSubtracting 3 times 36 from 135 gives 135 minus 108, which is 27.\n\nNext, I'll use 6^1 = 6. Dividing 27 by 6 yields exactly 4.5, so the integer part is 4. Therefore, the coefficient for 6^1 is 4.\n\nSubtracting 4 times 6 from 27 results in 27 minus 24, which equals 3.\n\nFinally, for 6^0 = 1, the coefficient is simply 3 because there's a remainder of 3.\n\nCombining all these coefficients, the base six representation of 999 in decimal is 4*6^3 + 3*6^2 + 4*6^1 + 3*6^0, which translates to 4 3 4 3 in base six.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six (\\( 6_{\\text{base}} \\)), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the largest power of six that fits into 999:**\n   - Compute successive powers of six:\n     -"
