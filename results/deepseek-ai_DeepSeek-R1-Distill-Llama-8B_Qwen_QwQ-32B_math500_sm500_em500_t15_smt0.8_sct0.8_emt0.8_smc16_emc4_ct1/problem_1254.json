            "output": "First, I need to convert the decimal number 999 into base six. To do this, I'll divide 999 by 6 repeatedly and keep track of the remainders.\n\nStarting with 999 divided by 6, I get 166 with a remainder of 3. Then, I'll divide 166 by 6, which gives 27 with a remainder of 4. Next, I divide 27 by 6 to obtain 4 remainder 3.\n\nContinuing, I'll divide 4 by 6 and get 0 with a remainder of 4. Since the quotient is now zero, the division process stops here. Now, I'll write the remainders in reverse order to obtain the base six representation of 999 in decimal. So, the base six equivalent of 999₁₀ is 344₃₆.\n</think>\n\nTo find the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\(999_{10}\\), we can use the process of division to convert the decimal number to base six. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6:**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **First digit (rightmost):** 3\n\n2. **Divide the quotient by 6:**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Second digit:** 4\n\n3. **Divide the new quotient by 6:**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - **Third digit:** 3\n\n4. **Divide the final quotient by 6:**\n   \\[\n   4 \\div 6 = 0 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - **Fourth digit (leftmost):** 4\n\n5. **Reading the remainders in reverse order gives the base six number:**\n   \\[\n   344_6\n   \\]\n\nSo, the base six equivalent of \\(999_{10}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{344_6}\n\\]"
