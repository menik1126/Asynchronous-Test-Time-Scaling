            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: \"How many y-intercepts does the graph of the parabola x = y² - 4y - 1 have?\" Hmm, I'm a bit confused about y-intercepts. I remember that for functions, the y-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. But wait, is this a function of x in terms of y? Let me think.\n\nThe equation given is x = y² - 4y - 1. So, this is a quadratic equation, but it's not in the standard form of a function like y = f(x). Instead, it's solving for x in terms of y. That makes me realize that this parabola opens either to the right or to the left. \n\nWait, y-intercept is usually when x=0, right? So, if I want to find the y-intercept(s), I should set x to 0 and solve for y. That makes sense because the y-intercept happens where the graph crosses the y-axis where x=0.\n\nSo, let me write that down. If x = 0, then:\n\n0 = y² - 4y - 1\n\nHmm, okay, that's a quadratic equation in terms of y. To solve for y, I can use the quadratic formula. But first, let me rearrange the equation:\n\ny² - 4y - 1 = 0\n\nYes, that's a standard quadratic equation where the variable is y. So, applying the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [4 ± √(16 + 4)] / 2\n\nWait, where did that come from? Let me recall the quadratic formula: for ax² + bx + c = 0, the solutions are (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a). So in this case, a=1, b=-4, and c=-1.\n\nWait, hold on, b is actually -4? Let me double-check that. The quadratic equation is y² - 4y - 1 = 0. So yes, a=1, b=-4, c=-1.\n\nSo plugging into the quadratic formula:\n\ny = [-(-4) ± √((-4)² - 4*1*(-1))] / (2*1)\ny = [4 ± √(16 + 4)] / 2\ny = ["

            "output": "4 ± √20] / 2\n\nSimplify √20. √20 is √(4*5) = 2√5. So:\n\ny = [4 ± 2√5] / 2\n\nDivide numerator terms by 2:\n\ny = 2 ± √5\n\nSo that gives two solutions: y = 2 + √5 and y = 2 - √5. Since √5 is approximately 2.236, then 2 + √5 is about 4.236 and 2 - √5 is about -0.236. Both are real numbers, so that means there are two y-intercepts?\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many y-intercepts the graph has. Since we found two real solutions for y when x=0, that would mean two points where the graph crosses the y-axis. So the answer should be 2?\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up x and y intercepts. Let me recall: the y-intercept is where the graph crosses the y-axis, which is at x=0. So yes, setting x=0 and solving for y is correct. If there are two real solutions, that's two points, so two y-intercepts. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes people might confuse this with x-intercepts, which are where y=0. Let me check that quickly just to be thorough. If I set y=0 in the equation, then x = (0)^2 -4*(0) -1 = -1. So that's an x-intercept at ( -1, 0 ). But the question is about y-intercepts, so that's not needed here.\n\nWait, but maybe I should also consider the direction the parabola opens. Since the equation is x = y² + ... , the parabola opens either to the right or left. The coefficient of y² is positive, so it opens to the right. But does that affect the number of y-intercepts? Hmm, not directly. The direction just tells me the shape, but the y-intercepts are determined by solving when x=0. Since the quadratic equation had two real roots, there are two points where it crosses the y-axis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that since it's a parabola opening to the right, it can only cross the"

            "output": " y-axis once? But that's not the case. The standard parabola that opens to the right is x = a(y - k)^2 + h, which can have two y-intercepts if the vertex is above or below the x-axis. Wait, in this case, the vertex is at y = 2 (since the vertex of y² -4y is y=2), and when y=2, x = (2)^2 -4*(2) -1 = 4 -8 -1 = -5. So the vertex is at (-5, 2). So the parabola opens to the right from the vertex (-5,2).\n\nBut since the vertex is above the x-axis (since y=2 is positive), the parabola will cross the y-axis at two points: one above the vertex and one below? Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, let me try to imagine the graph. It's opening to the right, vertex at (-5, 2). So, when y increases and decreases from 2, the corresponding x increases.\n\nSo, when y=2 + √5 ≈4.236, x=0, which is to the right of the vertex. Similarly, when y=2 - √5≈-0.236, x=0, which is also to the right of the vertex because x depends on y². So, yes, both y-intercepts are to the right of the vertex, but both exist because the parabola continues on both sides. So, there are two points where the graph crosses the y-axis at (0, 2+√5) and (0, 2-√5). Therefore, two y-intercepts.\n\nI think that's correct. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any case when setting x=0 might not yield two solutions. For a quadratic equation, it can have two real roots, one real root, or no real roots. In this case, since the discriminant is b² -4ac = 16 +4 = 20 >0, so there are two distinct real roots, meaning two y-intercepts.\n\nSo, yeah, the answer should be two. But I wonder if someone could get confused with x-intercepts, which would only have one. But again, the question is about y-intercepts, so two is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number"
