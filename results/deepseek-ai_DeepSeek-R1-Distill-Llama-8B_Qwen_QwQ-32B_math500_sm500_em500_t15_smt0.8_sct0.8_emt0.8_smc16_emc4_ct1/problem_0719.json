            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many y-intercepts the graph of the parabola given by the equation x = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1 has. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a y-intercept is. A y-intercept is a point where the graph crosses the y-axis, right? And at any point on the y-axis, the x-coordinate is 0. So, to find the y-intercepts, I should set x equal to 0 and solve for y. That makes sense.\n\nAlright, so I'll substitute x with 0 in the equation:\n\n0 = y\u00b2 - 4y - 1\n\nNow I have a quadratic equation in terms of y. Quadratic equations are usually in the form ay\u00b2 + by + c = 0, so let me rearrange my equation:\n\ny\u00b2 - 4y - 1 = 0\n\nComparing this to the standard quadratic form, I can see that a = 1, b = -4, and c = -1. Since the equation is quadratic, I can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for y. The quadratic formula is y = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a). Plugging in the values I have:\n\ny = (-(-4) \u00b1 \u221a((-4)\u00b2 - 4*1*(-1))) / (2*1)\ny = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 + 4)) / 2\ny = (4 \u00b1 \u221a20) / 2\n\nWait, \u221a20 can be simplified. Since 20 is 4*5, \u221a20 is \u221a4 * \u221a5, which is 2\u221a5. So substituting that back in:\n\ny = (4 \u00b1 2\u221a5) / 2\n\nI can simplify this further by dividing both terms in the numerator by 2:\n\ny = 2 \u00b1 \u221a5\n\nSo, the solutions are y = 2 + \u221a5 and y = 2 - \u221a5. Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with substituting x = 0, then identifying a, b, c correctly. Then applying the quadratic formula, which seems right. Calculating the discriminant, 16 - 4*(1)*(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20. That's correct. Then simplifying \u221a20 to 2"

            "output": "\u221a5, and then dividing numerator terms by 2. Hmm, yes, that all seems correct.\n\nSo, the y-intercepts occur at the points (0, 2 + \u221a5) and (0, 2 - \u221a5). Since there are two solutions for y, there are two y-intercepts. Wait, let me think again. Could there be more than two? Well, a quadratic equation can have at most two real solutions, so since we have two real values for y, that means there are two points where the graph crosses the y-axis. So, the number of y-intercepts is two.\n\nWait another thought: Is this parabola opening in a direction that might affect the number of intercepts? The original equation is x = y\u00b2 - 4y -1. So if I solve for y in terms of x, it's a parabola that opens to the right because the coefficient of y\u00b2 is positive. So it's a sideways parabola. That means as y increases or decreases, x increases. So, it doesn't open up or down, but to the right. So, when we set x to 0, we're finding points where the parabola meets the y-axis, which is going to give us two points, one above the vertex and one below, right? So yeah, that would result in two y-intercepts.\n\nI might be overcomplicating, but just to be thorough. Let me sketch the graph mentally. Since it's a right-opening parabola, it has a vertex. Let me find the vertex to get a better idea. The vertex form of a parabola that opens to the right is x = a(y - k)\u00b2 + h, where (h, k) is the vertex. To find the vertex of x = y\u00b2 -4y -1, I can complete the square for the y terms.\n\nStarting with x = y\u00b2 -4y -1. Let's complete the square for y\u00b2 -4y:\n\ny\u00b2 -4y = (y - 2)\u00b2 - (2)\u00b2 = (y - 2)\u00b2 -4\n\nSo substituting back into the equation:\n\nx = (y - 2)\u00b2 -4 -1\nx = (y - 2)\u00b2 -5\n\nSo the vertex is at ( -5, 2 ). That means the parabola opens to the"

Since the vertex is at x = -5, which is to the left of the y-axis (which is at x=0), and since the parabola opens to the right, it should cross the y-axis twice. That matches with the two solutions we found earlier. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of y-intercepts is two. I think that's solid. Let me just check if maybe there's a case where the discriminant is zero or negative. The discriminant was 20, which is positive, so two real roots. So yes, two intercepts.
