Then, I need to compute the sum of each of these factors evaluated at 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, the polynomial is \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\). It looks like a degree 8 polynomial, which is even. I notice that the exponents are 8, 4, and 0 (since the constant term is -4). Maybe I can make a substitution to make it look simpler. Let me try setting \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the polynomial becomes \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). That's a quadratic in terms of y. \n\nAlright, now I just need to factor the quadratic \\( y^2 + 3y - 4 \\). To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Let's see, 4 and -1 work because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. So, the quadratic factors as \\( (y + 4)(y - 1) \\). \n\nSubstituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), the factors become \\( (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1) \\). So now, the original polynomial is factored into two polynomials: \\( (x^4 + 4) \\) and \\( (x^4 - 1) \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem says each polynomial \\( p_i(x) \\) must be monic with integer coefficients and cannot be factored further over the integers. Let me check if \\( x^4 + 4 \\) and \\( x^4 - 1 \\) can be factored further.\n\nStarting with \\( x^4 - 1 \\). That's a difference of squares because \\( x^4 = (x^2)^2 \\) and 1 is \\( 1^2 \\). So, \\( x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) \\). Then, \\( x^2 - 1 \\) can be factored further into \\( (x"

Because \\( x^4 = (x^2)^2 \\) and 4 is \\( 2^2 \\). I remember that the sum of squares can sometimes be factored using complex numbers, but over integers, it might not factor. Wait, but maybe there's a special factorization.\n\nOh, I think \\( x^4 + 4 \\) can be factored as a product of two quadratics. Let me recall the identity: \\( x^4 + 4y^4 = (x^2 + 2xy + 2y^2)(x^2 - 2xy + 2y^2) \\). In our case, since it's just \\( x^4 + 4 \\), let me see if that works. If I set \\( y = 1 \\), then the identity becomes \\( x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\). Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4 \\) factors as:\n- \\( (x^4 + 4) = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) \\)\n- \\( (x^4 - 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\)\n\nSo, altogether, the factors are four polynomials: \\( (x - 1) \\), \\( (x + 1) \\), \\( (x^2 + 1) \\), \\( (x^2 + 2x + 2) \\), and \\( (x^2 - 2x + 2) \\).\n\nNow, I need to check if each of these is monic, irreducible over integers, and can't be factored further.\n\n- \\( x - 1 \\) is monic.\n- \\( x + 1 \\) is monic.\n- \\( x^2 + "

Let me check its discriminant: \\( b^2 - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4 \\). Negative discriminant, so it has no real roots, and thus can't be factored over integers.\n- \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\). Discriminant: \\( 4 - 8 = -4 \\). Same as above, can't be factored over integers.\n\nGreat, so all these factors are irreducible over integers and monic.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) + \\dots + p_k(1) \\). Since we have k = 5 factors, we'll compute each of them at x=1 and sum.\n\nLet's compute each polynomial at x=1:\n\n1. \\( p_1(x) = x - 1 \\). So, p1(1) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n2. \\( p_2(x) = x + 1 \\). So, p2(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n3. \\( p_3(x) = x^2 + 1 \\). So, p3(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n4. \\( p_4(x) = x^2 + 2x + 2 \\). So, p4(1) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n5. \\( p_5(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\).
