The given equation is a 10th-degree polynomial, so it has 10 roots, which are grouped into five conjugate pairs. \n\nI think that Vieta's formulas might be useful here because they relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Maybe I can relate the sum of reciprocals of the squared magnitudes to the coefficients.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can rewrite the equation to make it easier to analyze. Let me set \\( y = 13x - 1 \\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\\[x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\]\nBut since \\( y = 13x - 1 \\), we can think of this as a polynomial in terms of x or y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can factor the equation or find a substitution that simplifies it.
