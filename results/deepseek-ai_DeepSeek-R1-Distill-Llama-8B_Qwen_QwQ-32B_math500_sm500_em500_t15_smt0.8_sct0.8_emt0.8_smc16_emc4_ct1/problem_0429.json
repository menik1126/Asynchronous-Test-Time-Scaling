It's a complex equation, so I know it's going to have 10 complex roots, which are paired as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). The problem is asking me to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I should recall that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real number and specifically the square of the modulus of \\(r\\). So \\(\\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}}\\) would just be \\(\\frac{1}{|r|^2}\\), which is also a real number. That might come in handy.\n\nNow, the equation given is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). I can try to rearrange this equation to see if I can express it in a more manageable form. Let's see, moving the second term to the other side:\n\n\\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\).\n\nHmm, that looks like \\(x^{10} = (-1) \\cdot (13x - 1)^{10}\\). Taking the 10th root on both sides, but wait, since it's a complex equation, the 10th root is going to give multiple solutions, which is why we have 10 roots. But perhaps there's another way to approach this.\n\nI remember that when dealing with polynomials, the sum of reciprocals of the products of roots (like \\(r_i \\overline{r}_i\\)) can often be related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Specifically, if I can express the sum I'm looking for in terms of the coefficients, that might work.\n\nLet me think about Vieta's formulas. For a polynomial, the"

But since we have complex roots and they are paired with their conjugates, maybe there's a symmetric way to compute this sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering substitution can help simplify the equation. Let me let \\(y = 13x - 1\\), but not sure if that's helpful. Wait, maybe a substitution to make the equation look like \\(A^{10} + B^{10} = 0\\), so \\(A = -B \\cdot e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\) for some k?\n\nLet me try to write the equation as:\n\n\\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\).\n\nTaking both sides as complex numbers, we can write:\n\n\\(x / (13x - 1) = e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\).\n\nWait, because raising both sides to the 1/10 power gives \\(x/(13x - 1)\\) as the 10th roots of -1. The 10th roots of -1 are \\(e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\) for k from 0 to 9. Hmm, that might be a good approach.\n\nSo, for each root \\(x\\) of the equation, we can write:\n\n\\(x = (13x - 1) \\cdot e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\) for some k.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for x.

Since the equation has real coefficients, the roots are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. But in this case, the equation is of degree 10 with real coefficients, so we can have up to 5 pairs of complex conjugate roots.\n\nWait, so how are the roots arranged? Let me check, given that the equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Let me evaluate for real x: if I plug in a real x, both terms \\(x^{10}\\) and \\((13x -1)^{10}\\) are non-negative, so their sum can't be zero unless both are zero. So, real roots would require \\(x = 0\\) and \\(13x - 1 = 0\\), but \\(x = 0\\) gives the first term as 0 and the second term as \\(1^{10}\\), which is 1, so not zero. Similarly, \\(x = 1/13\\) would make the second term zero but the first term \\((1/13)^{10}\\), which is not zero. So there are no real roots, hence all roots must come in complex conjugate pairs.\n\nBut wait, earlier substitution gave me that each \\(x = r_j\\) can be expressed in terms of \\(\\omega_j\\), so maybe all roots are expressed via those \\(\\omega_j\\), which are 10 points on the unit circle at angles \\(\\pi/10, 3\\pi/10, ..., 19\\pi/10\\).\n\nWait, perhaps for each root \\(r_j\\), its conjugate is also a root, so when I take \\( \\overline{r}_j \\), it should correspond to another root \\(r_{j'}\\) which is the conjugate.\n\nBut maybe I can express \\(r_j\\) in terms of \\(\\"

But in the problem, the roots are grouped into 5 conjugate pairs, so each term is counted once for each pair. Therefore, perhaps we need to sum |13 ω_j - 1|^2 over all 10 roots, and then since each pair contributes the same value, so the sum would be 5 times each value. Wait, but let me check.\n\nWait, actually, since the roots come in conjugate pairs, so for each ω_j, we have a corresponding ω_{j'}, which is its conjugate, because the 10th roots of -1 are symmetrically placed on the unit circle, so each ω_j and its conjugate ω_{j'} (which would be ω_{(j+5) mod 10}) would give the same |13 ω_j - 1|^2, because |13 ω_j - 1|^2 is the same for ω_j and its conjugate.\n\nWait, no"

Therefore, each pair contributes twice the same value, so the total over all 10 roots would be 2 times the sum over the 5 distinct terms. Therefore, the sum over all 10 roots of |13 ω -1|^2 is equal to 2 times the desired sum (since the problem's sum is over 5 terms, each being |13 ω -1|^2 for each pair). Wait, actually, the problem's sum is exactly the sum over each pair once, so the total over all roots would be twice the problem's sum. Therefore, if I can compute the sum over all 10 roots of |13 ω -1|^2, then divide by 2, I get the desired value.\n\nTherefore, let me compute S = sum_{j=0}^9 |13 ω_j -1|^2, then the answer is S/2.\n\nSo, let's compute S.\n\nFirst, note that S = sum_{j=0}^9 |13 ω_j -1|^2.\n\nAs above, expanding each term:\n\n|13 ω_j -1|^2 = (13 ω_j -1)(13 \\overline{ω_j} -1) = 169 |ω_j|^2 -13 ω_j -13 \\overline{ω_j} +1.\n\nSince |ω_j|^2 =1, so this simplifies to 169 -13("

Therefore, the problem's sum is 850.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion of |13 ω -1|^2.\n\nLet me recheck that.\n\nLet me compute |a - b|^2 where a and b are complex numbers. It's (a - b)(\\overline{a} - \\overline{b}) = |a|^2 + |b|^2 - a \\overline{b} - \\overline{a} b.\n\nWait, in our case, it's |13 ω -1|^2 = (13 ω -1)(13 \\overline{ω} -1).\n\nExpanding this:\n\n13 ω *13 \\overline{ω} + 13 ω*(-1) + (-1)*13 \\overline{ω} + (-1)(-1)\n\n= 169 |ω|^2 -13 ω -13 \\overline{ω} +1.\n\nSince |ω|^2 =1, so 169*1 -13(ω + \\overline{ω}) +1 = 170 -13*(ω + \\overline{ω}).\n\nBut ω + \\overline{ω} = 2 Re(ω). So that gives 170 -26 Re(ω). So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the expansion is correct.\n\nThen, the sum over all roots:\n\nsum_{j=0}^9 [170 -26 Re(ω_j)] = 10*170 -26 sum Re(ω_j).\n\nWe found that sum Re(ω_j) over j=0 to 9 is zero, so S=1700.\n\nTherefore, the problem's answer is 850.\n\nHmm, but let me think again why the sum of Re(ω_j) is zero.\n\nThe roots ω_j are the 10th roots of -1, which are equally spaced around the unit circle, but starting at angle π/10, so they are symmetrically placed.

Therefore, sum Re(ω_j) = Re(sum ω_j) = Re(0) =0, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the sum over Re(ω_j) is zero, so S=1700.\n\nThus, the answer is 850.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{850}\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). We need to find the value of the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1 \\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2 \\overline{r}_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3 \\overline{r}_3} + \\frac{1}{r_4 \\overline{r}_4} + \\frac{1}{r_5 \\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nFirst, we recognize that the roots \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\ldots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\) come from the equation \\(x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\\). This implies that for each root \\(x\\), we can write \\(x = \\frac{\\omega}{13 \\omega - 1}\\) where \\(\\omega\\) are the 10th roots of \\(-1\\).\n\nEach root \\(r_j\\) can be expressed as \\(r_j = \\frac{\\omega_j}{13 \\omega_j - 1}\\) where \\(\\omega_j = e^{i\\pi(2j+1)/10}\\) for \\(j = 0, 1, \\ldots, 9\\).\n\nWe need to find the sum of \\(|r_j \\overline{r}_j|\\) for each pair. Since \\(|r_j|^2 = \\left| \\frac{\\omega_j}{13 \\omega_j - 1} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{|13 \\omega_j -"
