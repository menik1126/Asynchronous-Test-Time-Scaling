It says: Let (a₁, a₂, …, aₙ) be a sequence of positive real numbers such that the sum of them is 96, the sum of their squares is 144, and the sum of their cubes is 216. I need to find the sum of all possible values of n. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me try to write down the given information:\n\n1. Sum of the numbers: Σa_i = 96\n2. Sum of their squares: Σa_i² = 144\n3. Sum of their cubes: Σa_i³ = 216\n\nI need to find all possible n and sum them up. So, n is the number of terms in this sequence.\n\nFirst thought: Maybe I can use some sort of inequalities or identities that relate these sums. I know that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can relate sums and sums of squares, but I'm not sure how to use it here directly. Maybe also consider the Power Mean inequality, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about moments. The first moment is the sum, second moment is the sum of squares, third moment is the sum of cubes. For a set of numbers, knowing their moments can sometimes help in determining things about them. Also, perhaps looking into the case where all the a_i are equal? Because if they are equal, the sums might be easier to relate.\n\nLet me check that. Suppose all a_i are equal. Then each a_i would be 96/n, right? So then the sum of squares would be n*(96/n)² = 96²/n. Similarly, the sum of cubes would be n*(96/n)³ = 96³/n².\n\nSo let's write that down.\n\nIf all a_i = 96/n, then:\n\nSum of squares: n*(96/n)² = (96²)/n = 144\n\nSo, 96² / n = 144 => n = 96² / 144\n\nCompute 96²: 96*96 is 9216.\n\nSo n = 9216 / 144. Let me divide that: 144*64 = 9216, so n = 64.\n\nSimilarly, check the sum of cubes:\n\nSum of cubes: n*(96/n)^3 = (96^3)/n² = 216\n\nSo, 96"

Hmm:\n\n9216*100 = 921,600; subtract 9216*4 = 36,864. So 921,600 - 36,864 = 884,736. Therefore 96³ = 884,736.\n\nThen n² = 64² = 4096.\n\n884,736 divided by 4096: Let's see:\n\n4096 * 200 = 819,200\n\n884,736 - 819,200 = 65,536\n\n4096 * 16 = 65,536. So total is 200 + 16 = 216. Exactly. So that checks out.\n\nSo when all a_i are equal, n must be 64. Therefore n=64 is a possible value. But the problem says \"the sum of all possible values of n,\" so there might be more?\n\nHmm. Maybe there are some cases where not all a_i are equal, but the sums still satisfy the equations. So, perhaps n can be smaller?\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, maybe some of the terms can be different but still satisfy the given sums. Let me think.\n\nSuppose that some of the terms are larger and some are smaller. But since they are all positive real numbers, I need to see if there's another integer n where such a sequence exists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this with variables. Let me consider variables a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. Σa_i = 96\n\n2. Σa_i² = 144\n\n3. Σa_i³ = 216\n\nWe need to find possible"

So perhaps I can use Cauchy-Schwarz or other inequalities to find constraints on n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the sum of a_i and sum of a_i squared.\n\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality says that (Σa_i)^2 ≤ n * Σa_i².\n\nSo, (96)^2 ≤ n * 144.\n\nCompute 96²: 9216.\n\nSo 9216 ≤ 144n => n ≥ 9216 / 144 = 64.\n\nSo n has to be at least 64.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So n must be ≥64. But earlier, when we assumed all a_i equal, we got n=64, and that worked. So is 64 the minimum possible n, and no n less than 64 can satisfy these inequalities?\n\nWait, let's think again. If n is larger than 64, is that possible?\n\nBut can n be larger than 64? Because if n is larger, then what happens?\n\nWait, but the sum of a_i is 96, so n has to be such that the average is 96/n. So if n is bigger, the average is smaller. But if some of the a_i are zero, but no, the problem specifies positive real numbers. So they can't be zero. So all a_i are positive.\n\nSo the minimal possible n is when all a_i are equal, which gives n=64, but could we have a case where n is bigger than 64, with some a_i being different? But if n is bigger than 64, the average is less than 1, because 96/n <1.\n\nBut let's see if it's possible.\n\nWait, let me also use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for the sum of a_i and a_i squared.\n\nWe have Σa_i² ≥ (Σa_i)^2 / n.\n\nWhich is exactly what I used before, which gives n ≥ 64.\n\nSo that gives a lower bound on n, but does it provide an upper bound? Or can n be any integer greater than or equal to 64?\n\nWait, perhaps not necessarily, because if n is larger, the sum of the squares must be at least (Σa_i)^2 /n, which is 96²/n. But for n larger than 64, 96²/n becomes smaller than "

So the inequality allows the sum of squares to be larger than that.

Because when I thought about n=65, having 65 terms, each of which is positive, but with the sum 96.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of variance.\n\nVariance is E[X²] - (E[X])², but in this case, since we have sum of a_i, sum of a_i squared, etc.\n\nSo, variance σ² = (Σa_i²)/n - (Σa_i /n )²\n\nSimilarly, I can compute the variance given n.\n\nBut wait, let me compute the variance:\n\nσ² = 144/n - (96/n)².\n\nSo for n=64, variance is 144/64 - (96/64)^2 = 2.25 - (1.5)^2 = 2.25 - 2.25 = 0.\n\nSo all terms are equal, variance is 0.\n\nFor n >64, variance is 144/n - (96/n)^2.\n\nCompute 144/n - (9216/n²)\n\nWhich is (144n - 9216)/n².\n\nSo for n>64, the variance is positive, meaning the terms are not all equal.\n\nBut for n=65, 144/65 - (96/65)^2.
