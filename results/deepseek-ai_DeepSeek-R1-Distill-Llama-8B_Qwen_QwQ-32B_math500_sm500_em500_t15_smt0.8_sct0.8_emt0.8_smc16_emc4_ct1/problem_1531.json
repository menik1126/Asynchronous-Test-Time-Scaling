The problem gives me three sums: the sum of the first n terms, the sum of their squares, and the sum of their cubes. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me write down what's given. We have a sequence of positive real numbers (a1, a2, ..., an). The sums are:\n\nSum of ai from i=1 to n = 96,\n\nSum of ai squared from i=1 to n = 144,\n\nSum of ai cubed from i=1 to n = 216.\n\nI need to find all possible values of n and then sum them up.\n\nHmm, okay, so we have three equations:\n\n1. S1 = a1 + a2 + ... + an = 96,\n\n2. S2 = a1² + a2² + ... + an² = 144,\n\n3. S3 = a1³ + a2³ + ... + an³ = 216.\n\nI remember that in problems involving sums of powers, sometimes we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go here.\n\nAnother thought: If all the ai are equal, then we can find n easily, but since the problem says \"sum of all possible values of n,\" perhaps there are multiple n's that satisfy these conditions.\n\nWait, if all ai are equal, let's test that case first. If all ai are equal, let's say ai = k for all i, then:\n\nn * k = 96 ⇒ k = 96/n,\n\nn * k² = 144 ⇒ k = sqrt(144/n) = 12/sqrt(n),\n\nn * k³ = 216 ⇒ k = cube root(216/n) = 6/(n^(1/3)).\n\nSo, setting these equal:\n\n96/n = 12/sqrt(n) = 6/(n^(1/3)).\n\nLet me set 96/n = 12/sqrt(n):\n\n96/n = 12/n^(1/2)\n\nMultiply both sides by n^(1/2):\n\n96 * n^(-1/2) = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 12:\n\n8 * n^(-1/2) = 1\n\nSo,\n\nn^(-1/2) ="

Perfect, that's correct.\n\nSo, n=64 is a possible value when all ai are equal.\n\nBut the question asks for the sum of all possible values of n, so there might be other sequences where n is different, but the sums still hold.\n\nHmm, so maybe n can be another number, perhaps smaller or larger?\n\nWait, maybe if the ai are not all equal, n can be different. Let me think. Let me consider the case where n is smaller, say n=24. Why 24? Because 96 is divisible by 24, 144 is divisible by 24, but 216 divided by 24 is 9, which is a perfect cube. Hmm, that might be a coincidence.\n\nWait, let's see: If n=24, then each ai would be 4, because 24*4=96. Then ai squared would be 16, so 24*16=384, which is not 144. So, n=24 is not possible.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me recast that.\n\nWait, if n=24, then the sum of squares would have to be 144, so each ai squared would be 144/24 = 6. So ai would be sqrt(6), which is approximately 2.45. Then, the sum of cubes would be 24*(sqrt(6))³. Let's compute that: (sqrt(6))^3 = 6*sqrt(6) ≈ 14.7, so 24*14.7 ≈ 352.8, which is way higher than 216. So n=24 isn't a solution.\n\nWait, so maybe n=24 is too small. Let's try n=32. 32*3=96, so each ai=3. Then, ai squared=9, so sum is 32*9=288≠144. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider that for a set of positive numbers, we can use the Cauchy-S"

Wait, but the problem says \"sum of all possible values of n,\" so maybe n can be 64 or higher?\n\nWait, but if n is higher than 64, then the minimal n is 64, so n can be 64 or more? But how can n be more than 64?\n\nWait, let me think again. The Cauchy-Schwarz gives a lower bound on n. So n must be at least 64. So the minimal possible n is 64, but can n be larger?\n\nWait, but if n is larger, then the terms ai would have to be smaller on average, but their squares and cubes would also have to add up to 144 and 216. Let me see.\n\nSuppose n is 65. Let me see if that's possible. Let me try to construct such a sequence.\n\nSuppose we have 64 terms of 1.5 (since 64*1.5=96, 64*(1.5)^2=64*2.25=144, and 64*(1.5)^3=64*3.375=216). So that's the case where all terms are equal. Now, if we want to have n=65, we can take one of the terms and split it into two terms such that the total sum remains the same, but the squares and cubes also remain the same.

Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I increase some terms beyond 1.5 and decrease others below 1.5 to compensate. But how does that affect the sums of squares and cubes?\n\nWait, let me consider that for a positive number, if I have two numbers a and b, then the sum of squares is minimized when a = b, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Similarly, the sum of cubes is minimized when all numbers are equal if we have a fixed sum. So, perhaps the given sums correspond to the minimal sums of squares and cubes for the given sum. So, if n is larger than 64, then we would have more terms, but the sums of squares and cubes would have to stay the same, which is more constrained, so maybe n can't be larger than 64.\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose n=65, then n >=64 is required by Cauchy-Schwarz, but can we have n=65?\n\nWait, suppose that n=65 and we have 65 numbers. Let me think about how the sums would behave.\n\nWait, if I have 65 numbers, their average would be 96/65 ≈1.4769.\n\nThe minimal sum of squares for 65 positive numbers with sum 96 would be if all numbers are equal, which would be (96/65)^2 *65 = 96^2 /65 ≈9216/65 ≈141.8, which is less than 144. But our sum of squares is 144, which is higher than the minimal possible. So that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, the minimal sum of cubes for 65 numbers would be if all numbers are equal to 96/65, and that's cube would be (96/65)^3 *65 = 96^3 /65^2. Let me compute that: 96^3 = 884,736; 65^2=4225; so 884736/4225 ≈ 209.3, which is less than 216. So the sum of cubes would be higher if the numbers"

Therefore, there is no such x and y that are positive and satisfy these equations. Therefore, splitting a term into two positive numbers while keeping the sum of squares and cubes the same is impossible.\n\nHmm, so that approach doesn't work. So, perhaps n=64 is the only possible value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe splitting more than one term?\n\nSuppose I split two terms. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I split two terms of 1.5 into four terms, such that the total sum remains the same, but the squares and cubes also stay the same. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of splitting, we can have some terms higher and some lower.\n\nSuppose we have one term higher than 1.5 and another term lower, keeping the sum the same.\n\nLet me suppose that we have two terms: one is 1.5 + d and another is 1.5 - d, keeping their sum as 3.0, so the total sum remains the same.\n\nLet me see how this affects the sum of squares and cubes.\n\nLet me compute the change in S2:\n\nOriginal contribution from two terms: 2*(1.5"

So, cannot change without affecting S2.\n\nSimilarly, for the sum of cubes, let me compute:\n\nOriginal contribution: 2*(1.5)^3=2*3.375=6.75.\n\nAfter change: (1.5 + d)^3 + (1.5 -d)^3.\n\nCompute this:\n\n= [3.375 + 3*(1.5)^2*d + 3*(1.5)*d² + d³] + [3.375 - 3*(1.5)^2*d + 3*(1.5)*d² - d³]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 3.375 + 3*(2.25)*d + 3*(1.5)*d² + d³ + 3.375 - 3*(2.25)*d + 3*(1.5)*d² - d³\n\n= 6.75 + [3*2.25*d -3*2.25*d] + [3*1.5*d² +3*1.5*d²] + [d³ - d³]\n\n=6.75 + 0 + 9d² +0 = 6.75 +9d².\n\nThus, the change in S3 is 6.75 +9d² -6.75=9d².\n\nAgain, for S3 to remain the same, we need 9d²=0 ⇒d=0.\n\nSo, any deviation from d=0 would require an increase in S2 and S3, which we can't have because they are fixed at 144 and 216.\n\nSo, this suggests that n=64 is the only possible value, as moving any"
