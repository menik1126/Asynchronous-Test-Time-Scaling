            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: \n\nIf log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then I need to find x. \n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. I remember that logarithms have some properties, so maybe I can use those to simplify these equations.\n\nFirst, looking at the first equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) = 2. I think when you add two logarithms with the same base, you can combine them by multiplying the arguments. So, log₆[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. That makes sense because log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(ac).\n\nNow, inside the log, (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, which simplifies to x² - y². So, the equation becomes log₆(x² - y²) = 2. \n\nTo get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that log_b(N) = M means that b^M = N. So, 6^2 = x² - y². Calculating 6 squared, that's 36. So, 36 = x² - y². \n\nAlright, I'll note that down as equation (1): x² - y² = 36.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2. Similar to before, this can be rewritten in exponential form. So, y^2 = 5x. That's straightforward. So, equation (2) is 5x = y² or x = y² / 5.\n\nWait, really? So, x is expressed in terms of y. That might be useful. Let me rewrite that as x = y² / 5. Got it.\n\nSo, now I have x in terms of y, which I can substitute back into equation (1) to solve for y, and then find x.\n\nSubstituting x = y² / 5 into equation (1): (y² / 5)² - y² = 36.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, (y² / 5) squared is (y^4) /"

            "output": " 25. Then subtract y², so the equation becomes (y^4)/25 - y² = 36.\n\nHmm, that looks like a quartic equation, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate the denominator. \n\nMultiplying each term by 25: y^4 - 25y² = 900.\n\nHmm, so y^4 -25y² -900 = 0. \n\nThis is a quadratic in terms of y². Let me set z = y². Then the equation becomes z² -25z -900 = 0.\n\nNow, solving for z using quadratic formula. The quadratic is z² -25z -900 =0. \n\nQuadratic formula is z = [25 ± sqrt(25² + 4*1*900)] / 2.\n\nCalculating discriminant: 25 squared is 625, and 4*1*900 is 3600. So sqrt(625 + 3600) = sqrt(4225). \n\nHmm, sqrt(4225) is 65, because 65*65 is 4225. \n\nSo, z = [25 ±65]/2. \n\nSo two solutions:\n\nFirst solution: (25 +65)/2 = 90/2 =45.\n\nSecond solution: (25 -65)/2 = (-40)/2 = -20.\n\nBut z = y², so z can't be negative. So, z =45 is the only valid solution here. \n\nTherefore, y² =45. \n\nSo, y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But since y is the base of a logarithm in the original problem (log_y(5x)), the base must be positive and not equal to 1. \n\nTherefore, y must be positive. So, y = sqrt(45). \n\nSimplify sqrt(45): sqrt(9*5)=3*sqrt(5). So, y = 3√5. \n\nNow, going back to equation (2): x = y² /5. Since y² is 45, then x =4"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nLet me verify the original equations with x=9 and y=3√5.\n\nFirst equation: log₆(x - y) + log₆(x + y) =2.\n\nCompute x - y =9 -3√5, and x + y=9 +3√5.\n\nMultiply them: (9 -3√5)(9 +3√5) =9² - (3√5)^2=81 -9*5=81-45=36.\n\nSo, log₆(36)= log₆(6²)=2.
