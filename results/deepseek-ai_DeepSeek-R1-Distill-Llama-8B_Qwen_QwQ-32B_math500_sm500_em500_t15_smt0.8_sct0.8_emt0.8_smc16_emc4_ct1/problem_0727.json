I remember that logarithms have some properties that can help simplify these kinds of equations. Let me take it one piece at a time.\n\nFirst, looking at the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\). I recall that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So, maybe I can combine these two logs into one using that property.\n\nSo, applying that property, the left side becomes \\(\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)]\\). That simplifies things a bit. Now, inside the logarithm, I see that \\((x - y)(x + y)\\) is a difference of squares, which equals \\(x^2 - y^2\\). So, now the equation is \\(\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, if \\(\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\\), that means that \\(x^2 - y^2 = 6^2\\), because if \\(\\log_b a = c\\), then \\(a = b^c\\). So, \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\). I'll write that down as equation (1): \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\). This one has a base that's not 6, so I'll have to think about how to handle that. Maybe I can convert it to a more familiar base or solve for \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\).\n\nI remember that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) is equivalent to \\(b^c = a\\). Applying that here, with base \\(y\\), we get \\(y^2 = 5x\\). So, \\(y^2 = 5x\\). That's equation (2):"

Let me try that.\n\nFrom equation (2), \\(y^2 = 5x\\), so plugging that into equation (1), we get:\n\n\\(x^2 - 5x = 36\\).\n\nSo, \\(x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\\). Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of \\(x\\). Let me try to solve for \\(x\\) using the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic is \\(x^2 -5x -36 = 0\\). So, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\), \\(c = -36\\).\n\nQuadratic formula: \\(x = [-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}]/(2a)\\). Plugging in the values:\n\n\\(x = [5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-36)}]/(2 * 1)\\)\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\\(25 - 4 * 1 * (-36) = 25 + 144 = 169\\)\nSo, sqrt(169) is 13.\n\nThus, \\(x = [5 + 13]/2\\) or \\(x = [5 -13]/2\\).\n\nCalculating the possible solutions:\n\n1. \\(x = (5 + 13)/2 = 18/2 = 9\\)\n2. \\(x = (5 -13)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4\\)\n\nHmm, so \\(x = 9\\) or \\(x = -4\\). But wait, since \\(x\\) is inside a logarithm in the original equation, \\(x\\) must be positive because logarithms of negative numbers are undefined. So, \\(x = -4\\) would make \\(x - y\\) or \\(x + y\\) negative, which is not allowed. Therefore, we can discard \\(x = -4\\) as a solution.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is \\(x = 9\\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1.

Solved the quadratic correctly, resulting in \\(x = 9\\) or \\(x = -4\\).\n6. Discarded \\(x = -4\\) because it's negative and can't be inside a logarithm.\n\nI think all steps check out. So, the solution is \\(x = 9\\).\n\nLet me just confirm by plugging these values back into the original equations to see if they hold.\n\nFirst, for \\(x = 9\\). Let's find \\(y^2 = 5x = 5*9 = 45\\). So, \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\).\n\nNow, \\(x^2 - y^2 = 9^2 - 45 = 81 - 45 = 36\\), which matches the first equation.\n\nNow, for the second equation, \\(\\log_y (5x) = 2\\). With \\(x=9\\) and \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\), \\(5x = 45\\). So, \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{45}} 45 = 2\\).\n\nSince \\((\\sqrt{45})^2 = 45\\), this holds true because \\(45 = (\\sqrt{45})^2\\), so the logarithm equals 2.\n\nSimilarly, if \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\), then \\(5x = 45\\). But, since \\(y\\) is negative, and the base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1, \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\) wouldn't work because logarithm bases can't be negative. So, we must have \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\).\n\nTherefore, everything checks out. \\(x = 9\\) is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given equations, we start by simplifying each equation using logarithmic properties and substitution.\n\n1. **Simplify the first equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\log_6"
