It's written as n\\$$ = n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}} with n! at the bottom, which has n! levels. So for 4\\$$, it's 4!^{{4!^{{4!^{{4!}}}}}}. Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the unit digit of a number is. It's the last digit of that number. So, I don't need to compute the entire superfactorial, just the last digit. That should simplify things because the last digit of powers often follows a pattern.\n\nStarting with 4\\$$, which is 4!^{{4!^{{4!^{{4!}}}}}}. Let me compute each level step by step, starting from the top and working my way down. Maybe breaking it down into smaller parts will help.\n\nLet me define it as follows:\n- Let\u2019s denote the innermost part first: 4! = 24. So, the innermost exponent is 24.\n- Then, moving one level up, it's 4!^24, which is 24^24.\n- The next level is 4!^{24^24}, which is 24^{24^24}.\n- Finally, the entire 4\\$$ is 4!^{24^{24^24}} = 24^{24^{24^24}}.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the units digit of 24^{24^{24^24}}. Now, 24 raised to any power, what's the pattern of its units digit?\n\nI remember that for units digits, we only need to consider the last digit of the base, which here is 4 (since 24 ends with 4). So, the problem simplifies to finding the units digit of 4^{24^{24^24}}.\n\nNow, let's recall the cycle of units digits for powers of 4:\n- 4^1 = 4\n- 4^2 = 16\n- 4^3 = 64\n- 4^4 = 256\n- And so on.\n\nI notice that"

Therefore, to find the units digit of 4^k, we need to find the exponent k mod 2.\n\nIf the exponent is even, the units digit is 6.\nIf the exponent is odd, the units digit is 4.\n\nTherefore, to compute 4^{24^{24^24}} mod 10 (which gives the units digit), we need to see whether the exponent 24^{24^24} is even or odd.\n\nLooking at the exponent: 24^{24^24}. Since 24 is even and any positive power of an even number is even, so 24^{any positive integer} is even. Therefore, the exponent is even. Hence, the exponent is even, so 4^{even} has a units digit of 6.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems too straightforward. Let me check if I missed any steps here.\n\nWait, perhaps I oversimplified. The key point is that the exponent is 24^{24^24}, which is 24 raised to some power. Since 24^anything is even, so exponent is even, so the exponent mod 2 is 0, so the exponent part is even, so 4^(even) has a units digit of 6. Therefore, the units digit should be 6?\n\nBut let me think again step by step to be thorough. Let me confirm each step.\n\nFirst, the superfactorial 4\\$ is indeed 24^(24^(24^24)). Now, the base is 24, whose last digit is 4. So, to compute the last digit of 24^(...), we can focus on 4^(...).\n\nThe key then is the exponent: 24^(24^24). Let me denote the exponent as E = 24^(24^24). So, the problem reduces to 4^E mod 10.\n\nSince the cycle length for 4's units digit is 2, we need E mod 2.\n\nE is 24^(24^24). Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even. Therefore, 24^anything is even"

Let's see:\n\nSince 24 is even, 24^anything is even, because multiplying even numbers together always gives an even number. So, 24^k is even for any k >= 1.\n\nTherefore, E = 24^(24^24) is even, so E mod 2 = 0.\n\nThus, 4^E mod 10 = 4^(0 mod 2) = 4^2 = 16, whose units digit is 6.\n\nWait, no. That's not quite right. Because the cycle is of length 2, so 4^1=4, 4^2=6, 4^3=4, 4^4=6, etc. So, if the exponent is even, 4^k mod 10 is 6. If the exponent is odd, it's 4.\n\nSo, when E is even, the units digit is 6.\n\nSo, yes, E is even, so 4^E has units digit 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4\\$$ is 6.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 4\\$$ is 24^(24^(24^24)). Let's think about the exponent 24^(24^24). Since 24 is even, 24^k is even for any k. So, the exponent is even.\n\nTherefore, 24^(even) has units digit 6, as explained before.\n\nWait, but when I compute 24^k mod 10, it's the same as 4^k mod 10, which cycles every 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nSo, again, if the exponent E is even, then 4^E mod 10 is 6. Therefore, 24^(even) mod 10 is 6.\n\nThus, the units digit of 4\\$$ is 6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake in understanding the superfactorial definition. The superfactorial is defined as n\\$(n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!"

The problem says \"underbrace{n!^{n!^{...}}}_{n!}\" meaning that the number of exponents is n!.\n\nWait, so for n=4, the number of levels is 4! =24. So the tower is 24 levels high?\n\nWait, that's different from my initial thought. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}} }_{n!}\".\n\nSo the underbrace indicates that the number of n! terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nTherefore, for n=4, the tower has 4! =24 levels. Each level is 24, so the tower is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24.\n\nWait, that's a tower of 24 copies of 24. So the height is 24, not 3 as I thought earlier. That complicates things.\n\nOh no, I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 4 levels, but actually, the number of levels is n! which is 24 for n=4. So the tower is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies. That's a massive tower. So my previous reasoning was incorrect because I considered only 3 levels. So I need to redo the analysis.\n\nOkay, so let me start over with the correct understanding.\n\nThe superfactorial 4\\$ is a tower of 24 copies of 24. So, the expression is:\n\n24^(24^(24^(...^24))) with 24 levels.\n\nWe need to find the units digit of this tower.\n\nTo find the units digit of such a tower, we can use modular arithmetic, specifically mod 10. Since we're interested in the last digit, mod 10 is sufficient.\n\nHowever, because the tower is so tall, we can use Euler's theorem or look for patterns in the exponents.\n\nFirst, let's recall that to compute a^b mod m, if a and m are coprime,"

Hmm, that complicates things a bit.\n\nBut maybe we can break it down. Let's think about the exponents mod \u03c6(10)=4, but again, since 10 is not prime, and 24 is even, perhaps we can apply the concept of totient but in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the exponent modulo 4, then modulo higher powers as needed.\n\nWait, let's try to compute the units digit step by step, starting from the top of the tower.\n\nLet me denote the tower as E = 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 levels.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, it's:\n\nE = 24^(24^(24^(...^24))) with 24 exponents.

So the base is 24, and the exponent is a tower of 23 levels of 24s.\n\nTherefore, to compute 4^k mod 5, where k is the tower of 23 levels of 24s.\n\nTo compute 4^k mod 5, we can use Euler's theorem here because 4 and 5 are coprime. \u03c6(5)=4, so 4^4 \u2261 1 mod 5. Therefore, 4^k \u2261 4^{k mod 4} mod 5.\n\nTherefore, we need to compute k mod 4, where k is the tower of 23 levels of 24s.\n\nSo, let me denote k = 24^(24^(...^24)) with 23 levels.\n\nWe need to compute k mod 4.\n\nFirst, 24 mod 4 = 0. So 24 \u2261 0 mod 4. Therefore, any tower of 24s with at least two levels will be 24^(something). Since 24 is divisible by 4, so 24^anything \u22651 is divisible by 4. Therefore, the exponent tower with 23 levels (which is at least two levels) will be 24^(...) \u2261 0 mod 4.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me see:\n\nThe exponent k is 24^(24^(...^24)) with 23 levels. Let's see:\n\nThe top of the exponent tower (the last exponent) is 24, then the next one down is 24^24, then 24^(24^24), etc. Since all the exponents are multiples of 24, which is divisible by 4, so each exponent in the tower is a multiple of 4.

If there are two levels, it's 24^24, which is (0 mod 4)^24, which is 0 mod 4. So regardless of the number of levels \u22651, the exponent tower is 0 mod 4.\n\nWait, but since our exponent k is a tower of 23 levels, which is certainly \u22652, so k \u2261 0 mod 4.\n\nTherefore, going back, 4^k mod 5 = 4^{0 mod 4} mod 5.\n\nBut 4^4 \u2261 1 mod 5, so 4^{4*m} \u2261 1 mod 5 for any integer m. Therefore, 4^{0 mod 4} = (4^4)^0 \u2261 1^0 = 1 mod 5.\n\nWait, but 4^k where k \u22610 mod 4.\n\nYes, 4^{4*m} = (4^4)^m \u2261 1^m \u22611 mod5.\n\nTherefore, E mod5 = 1.\n\nSo, E \u22610 mod2 and E\u22611 mod5.\n\nNow, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find E mod10.\n\nWe need to find a number x such that:\n\nx \u22610 mod2\n\nx\u22611 mod5\n\nSo, x is even, and x \u22611 mod5.\n\nLet\u2019s list the numbers \u22611 mod5: 1,6,11,16,21,26,31,...\n\nAmong these, the even ones are 6,16,26,36,...\n\nThe smallest is 6, so x=6 mod10.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 6.\n\nWait a second, this contradicts my earlier initial conclusion when I thought the tower had only 3 levels.
