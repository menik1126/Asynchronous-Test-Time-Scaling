This simplifies the equation to \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This gives me \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\), which simplifies to \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nSince 9 is the same as \\(3^2\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(3^x = 3^2\\).\n\nFinally, I'll set the exponents equal to each other because the bases are the same, leading to \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n\\[\n2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Calculate \\(2^3\\)**\n\\[\n2^3 = 8\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Isolate \\(3^x\\)**\nDivide both sides of the equation by 8:\n\\[\n3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n3^x = 9\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Express 9 as a Power of 3**\nWe know that:\n\\[\n9 = 3^2\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n3^x = 3^2\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Set the Exponents Equal**\nSince the bases are the same and the equation holds true, the exponents must be equal:\n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
