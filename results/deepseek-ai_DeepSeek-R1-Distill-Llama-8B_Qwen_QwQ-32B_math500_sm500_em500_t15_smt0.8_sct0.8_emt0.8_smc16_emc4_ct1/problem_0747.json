That simplifies the equation to \\(8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\).\n\nNext, I'll isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This gives me \\(3^x = \\frac{72}{8}\\), which simplifies to \\(3^x = 9\\).\n\nNow, I recognize that 9 is a power of 3 since \\(3^2 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\) in the equation \\(2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Substitute back into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Isolate \\(3^x\\):**\n   \\[\n   3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n   \\[\n   9 = 3^2\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \\[\n   x = 2\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{2}\\)"
