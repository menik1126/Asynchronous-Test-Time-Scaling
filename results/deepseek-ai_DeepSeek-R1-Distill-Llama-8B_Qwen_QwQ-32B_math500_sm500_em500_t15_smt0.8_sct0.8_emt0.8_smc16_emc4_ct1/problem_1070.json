Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon, the perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm. A regular octagon has 8 equal sides, so to find the length of each side of the octagon, I'll divide the total perimeter by 8.\n\nThis means each side of the octagon is 96 cm divided by 8, which equals 12 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo find the length of each side of the regular octagon, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Regular Hexagon:**\n\n   A regular hexagon has 6 sides. Each side is given as **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Perimeter of the Regular Octagon:**\n\n   The problem states that both shapes have the same perimeter. Therefore, the perimeter of the octagon is also **96 cm**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of Each Side of the Octagon:**\n\n   A regular octagon has 8 equal sides. To find the length of one side, divide the perimeter by the number of sides.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of each side of octagon} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n\\]"
