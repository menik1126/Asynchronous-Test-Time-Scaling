            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, I can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the number of sides by the length of one side.\n\nA regular hexagon has 6 sides, so the perimeter is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nNext, the problem states that the regular octagon has the same perimeter as the hexagon. Therefore, the perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon is regular, all its sides are of equal length. To find the length of one side of the octagon, I divide the total perimeter by the number of sides, which is 8.\n\nDividing 96 cm by 8 gives the length of each side of the octagon as 12 cm.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine the Perimeter of the Hexagon**\n\n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of hexagon} = \\text{Number of sides} \\times \\text{Side length} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Perimeter of the Octagon Equal to the Hexagon's Perimeter**\n\n   - The regular octagon has the **same perimeter** as the hexagon.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of octagon} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of One Side of the Octagon**\n\n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of one side of octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of octagon}}{\\text{Number of sides}} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\\)"
