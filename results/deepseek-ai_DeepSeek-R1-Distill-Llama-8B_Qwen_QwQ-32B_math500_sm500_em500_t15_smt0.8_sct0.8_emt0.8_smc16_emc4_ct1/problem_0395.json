Substituting this value into the equation gives \\( 45 = 3^2 h \\), which simplifies to \\( 45 = 9h \\).\n\nFinally, to find the height \\( h \\), I divide both sides by 9, resulting in \\( h = 5 \\) centimeters.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Volume of the cylinder (\\( V \\)) = \\( 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n- Radius (\\( r \\)) = 3 centimeters.\n\n**Formula for the Volume of a Cylinder:**\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Substitute the known values into the formula.**\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\).**\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.**\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
