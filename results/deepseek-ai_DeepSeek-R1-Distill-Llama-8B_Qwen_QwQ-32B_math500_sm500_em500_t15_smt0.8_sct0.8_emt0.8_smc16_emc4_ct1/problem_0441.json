            "output": "First, I need to determine which terms in the sequence are odd numbers. The given sequence starts at 1 and increases by 2 each time, so all terms are odd.\n\nNext, I'll find the total number of terms in the sequence. Since the terms are consecutive odd numbers, the number of terms can be calculated by dividing the last term by 2 and adding 1.\n\nAfter calculating the number of terms, I'll use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is known to be \\( n^2 \\).\n\nThen, I'll square the number of terms to find the total sum.\n\nFinally, I'll compute the modulo 7 of this sum to find the remainder when divided by 7.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum of the sequence \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\) is divided by \\(7\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Sequence\nThe given sequence is a series of consecutive odd numbers starting from \\(1\\) and ending at \\(199\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Terms\nThe \\(n\\)-th odd number can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = 2n - 1\n\\]\nGiven \\(a_n = 199\\):\n\\[\n199 = 2n - 1 \\implies 2n = 200 \\implies n = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are \\(100\\) terms in the sequence.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the First 100 Odd Numbers\nThe sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is given by:\n\\[\nS_n = n^2\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(n = 100\\):\n\\[\nS_{100} = 100^2 = 10,\\!000\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Compute \\(10,\\!000 \\mod 7\\)\nTo find the remainder when \\(10,\\!000\\) is divided by \\(7\\), perform the division:\n\\[\n10,\\!000 \\div 7 = 1,\\!428 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[\n10,\\!000 \\mod 7 = 4\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
