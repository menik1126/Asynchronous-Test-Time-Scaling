This means there are (199 - 1)/2 + 1 = 100 terms in total.\n\nSince the sequence of odd numbers is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2, the sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 * (first term + last term).\n\nApplying this, S = 100/2 * (1 + 199) = 50 * 200 = 10,000.\n\nNext, I'll find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7. Dividing 10,000 by 7 gives a quotient of 1428 and a remainder of 4, because 1428 * 7 = 9,996, and 10,000 - 9,996 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the modulo 7 remainder of the sum is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Sequence\nThe sequence consists of all odd numbers from \\(1\\) to \\(199\\). This is an arithmetic progression with:\n- **First term (\\(a\\))**: \\(1\\)\n- **Common difference (\\(d\\))**: \\(2\\)\n- **Last term (\\(l\\))**: \\(199\\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Terms (\\(n\\))\nThe formula to find the number of terms in an arithmetic progression is:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{199 - 1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{198}{2} + 1 = 99 + 1 = 100\n\\]\nSo, there are **100** terms in the sequence.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Sequence\nThe sum (\\(S\\)) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic progression is given by:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a + l)\n\\]\nSubstit"
