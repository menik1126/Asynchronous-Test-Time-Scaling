I remember from algebra that when dealing with optimization problems under certain constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers or using inequalities like AM-GM might be helpful. Since all variables are positive, AM-GM could work here.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know:\n\nWe have positive real numbers \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), and the condition is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). The function to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\).\n\nI need to find the minimum of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Let me expand that expression:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = x y + x z + y^2 + y z\n\\]\n\nHmm, not sure if expanding is the best approach. Maybe there's another way. Since we have symmetric variables, perhaps symmetry can be used. Let me assume that at the minimum, the variables might be equal or have some symmetric relation. But wait, since the function isn't symmetric in all three variables, just in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) because both are multiplied by \\(y\\) in the first term. Maybe \\(x = z\\) at the minimum?\n\nLet me assume \\(x = z\\). Then, the condition becomes \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot x \\cdot (x + y + x) = 1\\), which simplifies to \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\). And the function to minimize becomes \\((x + y)(y + x)\\) since \\(z = x\\), so \\((x + y)^2\\).\n\nWait, is that right? If \\(x = z\\), then \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) becomes \\((x + y)(y + x)\\), which is indeed \\((x + y)^2\\). So, in that case, we need to minimize \\((x + y)^2\\).\n\nBut is this assumption correct? Maybe not necessarily. Maybe \\(x\\) doesn't have to equal \\(z\\), but perhaps another relation exists. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution to reduce the number of"

Wait, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps set \\(s = x + y + z\\), so the condition becomes \\(xyz s = 1\\). Hmm, but how does that help with the expression \\((x + y)(y + z)\\)?\n\nLet me note that \\((x + y)(y + z) = y(x + y + z) + x z\\). Let me verify that:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = x y + x z + y^2 + y z = y(x + y + z) + x z\n\\]\n\nAh! That's a good step. So the product \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) can be rewritten as \\(y \\cdot s + x z\\), where \\(s = x + y + z\\). Since \\(s\\) is part of the constraint, maybe that can be useful. Let me note that down:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = y s + x z\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(xyz s = 1\\), so \\(x z s = \\frac{1}{y}\\). Therefore, \\(x z = \\frac{1}{y s}\\).

Wait, but is that the case here?\n\nWait, hold on. But \\(t = y s = y(x + y + z)\\). However, the problem is that \\(t\\) is not independent of the variables. So even though the function \\(t + 1/t\\) has a minimum at t=1, we need to ensure that there exist positive real numbers x, y, z such"

The inequality holds between the roots, but since the other root is negative, the solution is \\(y \\in ( -1 - \\sqrt{2}, -1 + \\sqrt{2} )\\). But since \\(y > 0\\), the valid interval is \\(0 < y \\leq -1 + \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the right-hand side \\(\\frac{1}{y} - y\\) must be at least 2, so equality occurs when \\(k + 1/k = 2\\), which requires \\(k = 1\\). So, if \\(k = 1\\), then \\(x = z = 1\\), and then:\n\n\\(1 + y + 1 = 1/y\\)\n\nSo, \\(2 + y = 1/y\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(y\\):\n\n\\(2 y"
