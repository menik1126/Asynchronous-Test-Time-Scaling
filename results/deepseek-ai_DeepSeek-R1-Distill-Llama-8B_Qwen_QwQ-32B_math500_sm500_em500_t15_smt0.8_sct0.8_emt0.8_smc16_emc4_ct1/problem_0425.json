Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to the modulus squared of \\(r\\), right? So, \\(r \\overline{r} = |r|^2\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{r \\overline{r}}\\) is just \\(\\frac{1}{|r|^2}\\). So, the problem is asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the squared magnitudes of each root.\n\nSince the equation is a polynomial, I can use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Vieta's formulas are useful here because they can give me the sum of the roots, product of the roots, etc., without having to find each root individually.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). I notice that both terms are raised to the 10th power. Maybe I can factor this or find a substitution that simplifies it. Let me try letting \\(y = x^{10}\\) or perhaps another substitution.\n\nWait, actually, maybe expand the second term. Let me see:\n\n\\[\n(13x - 1)^{10} = \\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{k} (13x)^k (-1)^{10 - k}\n\\]\n\nBut expanding this might be too time-consuming and messy. Is there a smarter substitution?\n\nLet me let \\(t = x\\), so the equation becomes \\(t^{10} + (13t - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor out something. Let me see:\n\n\\[\nx^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}\n\\]\n\nSince both sides are raised to the 10th power, I can take the 10th root of both sides, but since complex roots can be tricky, I need to be careful.

Let me write that:\n\nLet me denote \\( \\frac{x}{13x - 1} = \\omega \\), where \\( \\omega^{10} = -1 \\). Since \\( -1 = e^{i\\pi(2k + 1)} \\), so the 10th roots of -1 are \\( e^{i\\pi(2k + 1)/10} \\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\). So, each root corresponds to one of these roots of unity multiplied by some factor.\n\nTherefore, for each 10th root of -1, say \\( \\omega_k \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{13x - 1} = \\omega_k\n\\]\n\nSolving for x:\n\n\\[\nx = \\omega_k (13x - 1) \\\\\nx = 13 \\omega_k x - \\omega_k \\\\\nx - 13 \\omega_k x = - \\omega_k \\\\\nx(1 - 13 \\omega_k) = - \\omega_k \\\\\nx = \\frac{ - \\omega_k }{1 - 13 \\omega_k }\n\\]\n\nSo each root \\( r_j \\) can be written as \\( \\frac{ - \\omega_k }{1 - 13 \\omega_k } \\), where \\( \\omega_k^{10} = -1 \\).\n\nTherefore, all roots are of this form for each 10th root of -1. Since there are 10 roots, each corresponding to a different \\( \\omega_k \\).\n\nNow, the roots come in complex conjugate pairs because the coefficients of the original equation are real. So, for each root \\( r \\), its conjugate \\( \\overline{r} \\) is also a root. Therefore, the roots are grouped as \\("

So, for each ω_k, there is a ω_{10 -k} which is its conjugate. Therefore, the terms |1 -13 ω_k|² and |1 -13 ω_{conj}|² would be equal?\n\nWait, let me see. Let me suppose that ω is a root, then its conjugate is \\overline{ω} = ω^{-1} because |ω|=1. Since ω^{10} = -1, so ω^{-1} = \\overline{ω}.\n\nTherefore, if ω is a root, then \\overline{ω} = ω^{-1} is also a root, since (ω^{-1})^{10} = (ω^{10})^{-1} = (-1)^{-1} = -1.\n\nTherefore, the terms for ω and ω^{-1} would be:\n\nFor ω: |1 -13 ω|²,\n\nFor ω^{-1}: |1 -13 ω^{-1}|².\n\nBut since |1 -13 ω^{-1}|² = |1 -13 \\overline{ω}|² = | \\overline{1 -13 ω} |² = |1 -13 ω|², because modulus squared is the same as its conjugate.\n\nTherefore, each pair contributes twice the same value. Therefore, the total sum over all 10 roots is indeed twice the sum over 5 terms, but since the total sum is 1700, then the sum over each pair would be 1700 / 2 = 850?

Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the original substitution gave each root r_j as (- ω_k )/(1 -13 ω_k ). When considering all 10 roots, each corresponds to a different ω_k, and since ω_k and ω_{-k} (its conjugate) will give different r_j, but their contributions to the sum of 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) would be the same because |1 -13 ω_k|² is the same as |1 -13 ω_{-k}|².\n\nTherefore, in the sum over all 10 roots, each pair (ω_k and ω_{-k}) contributes the same term. So, essentially, we have 5 pairs, each contributing |1 -13 ω_k|², so the total sum is 5 times the sum over one unique pair.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the sum over all 10 roots, it came out to be 1700. Therefore, if that's the case, the sum over 10 roots is 1700, so each pair must contribute 1700 / 10 = 170.\n\nWait, no, that can't be, because each pair is represented twice? No, because each pair is counted once in the roots. Wait, no. The roots are 10 in total, each pair consists of two roots, so 10 roots / 2 = 5 pairs.\n\nWait, so if the sum over all 10 roots is 1700, that already accounts for all 10 terms, each term being |1 -13 ω_k|².\n\nBut in the problem, it asks for the sum over 5 terms, each of which is 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |1 -13 ω_k|².
