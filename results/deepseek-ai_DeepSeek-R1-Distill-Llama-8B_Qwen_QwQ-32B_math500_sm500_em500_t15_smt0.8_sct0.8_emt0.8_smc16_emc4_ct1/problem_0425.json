The question is asking me to find the value of the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, first off, I know that for complex conjugate roots \\(r\\) and \\(\\overline{r}\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to the square of the modulus of \\(r\\), which is also the same as \\(|r|^2\\). That's because if \\(r = a + bi\\), then \\(\\overline{r} = a - bi\\), so their product is \\(a^2 + b^2\\). So, in this problem, each term in the sum is essentially \\(1/|r_i|^2\\), where \\(r_i\\) is one of the roots.\n\nTherefore, the sum we're asked to compute is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\).\n\nNow, how can I relate this to the given equation? It looks like a polynomial equation of degree 10. Maybe I can use Vieta's formulas, which relate the sums and products of roots to the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nVieta's formula for a polynomial tells us that the sum of the roots is equal to \\(-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\\), where \\(a_n\\) is the leading coefficient and \\(a_{n-1}\\) is the coefficient of \\(x^{n-1}\\). But in this case, we're not directly dealing with the roots themselves, but rather the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the moduli of the roots. Hmm, that's a bit more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can express \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) in terms of something related"

Taking modulus on both sides, we get \\(|r_i|^{10} + |13r_i - 1|^{10} = 0\\). But wait, modulus is always non-negative, so the sum of two non-negative numbers equal to zero only if each is zero. So, this would imply that \\(|r_i|^{10} = 0\\) and \\(|13r_i - 1|^{10} = 0\\), which would mean \\(r_i = 0\\) and \\(13r_i - 1 = 0\\). But that would imply \\(r_i = 0\\) and \\(r_i = 1/13\\), which is a contradiction unless \\(r_i\\) is both 0 and 1/13, which isn't possible. Hmm, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\). If I substitute \\(x = r_i\\), then \\(r_i^{10} = - (13r_i - 1)^{10}\\). Taking modulus, I get \\(|r_i|^{10} = |13r_i - 1|^{10}\\). So, \\(|r_i|^{10} = |13r_i - 1|^{10}\\).\n\nTaking the 10th root on both sides, we have \\(|r_i| = |13r_i - 1|\\).

However, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of trying to work with individual roots, I can consider the polynomial equation and use Vieta's formula in some way.\n\nThe given equation is \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\).

The given equation is a 10th-degree polynomial, so maybe the sum we need is related to the sum of reciprocals of squares of roots, which can be found using Vieta's formula.\n\nBut I need to think: the sum of \\(1/|r_i|^2\\) is equivalent to the sum of \\(1/(r_i \\overline{r_i})\\).

But since \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r_i}\\) are roots, their product is \\(|r_i|^2\\), so each term in the sum is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). Since the roots come in conjugate pairs, each pair contributes two terms, but since they are conjugates, their \\(|r_i|^2\\) is the same, so each pair contributes twice \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). Wait, but in the problem statement, the roots are listed as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2\\), etc., so each pair is counted once as \\(r_i\\) and once as \\(\\overline{r}_i\\). However, since \\(|r_i|^2 = |\\overline{r}_i|^2\\), each pair contributes \\(1/|r_i|^2 + 1/|\\overline{r}_i|^2 = 2/|r_i|^2\\). But in the problem, the sum is over five terms, each being \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r}_j)\\), so each term is just \\(1/|r_j|^2\\), so the total sum is the sum over all five distinct pairs, each contributing once. So, the total sum is exactly the sum over all five distinct roots (each from a conjugate pair) of \\(1/|r_j|^2\\). Therefore, the problem is asking for the sum over all five distinct roots (since each pair is counted once) of \\(1/|r_j|^2\\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, perhaps I can consider the polynomial equation and find an expression for \\(1/|r_j|^2\\), then sum over all roots. Alternatively, maybe there's a clever substitution or transformation that can be applied here.\n\nLet me think again about the original equation: \\(x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0\\).
