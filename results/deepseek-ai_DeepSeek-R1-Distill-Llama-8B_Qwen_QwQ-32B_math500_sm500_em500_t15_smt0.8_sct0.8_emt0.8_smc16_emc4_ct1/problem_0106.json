I remember that when you have fractions like this, you can combine them by finding a common denominator. The denominators here are (x - 3) and (x + 8). The common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). That makes sense.\n\nSo, first step: combine the left side over the common denominator. Let me write that out. \n\nThe left side becomes: \\(\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\). Yeah, because I'm multiplying the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the other denominator.\n\nNow, the right side is already over the same denominator because \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\) factors into (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me check that. (x - 3)(x + 8) is x^2 + 5x - 24, right? Yep, because 8 - 3 is 5 and the constants multiply to -24. So the right side is \\(\\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\\).\n\nSince the denominators are equal, the numerators must be equal too. So:\n\n\\(C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\\)\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nCx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, since this equation must hold for all x except x = 3 and x = -8, the coefficients of the corresponding powers of x must be equal. So:\n\nCoefficient of x: C + D = 4\n\nConstant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations:\n\n1) C + D = 4\n\n2) 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need"

From equation 1, D = 4 - C.\n\nPlug D = 4 - C into equation 2:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nExpand that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8C + 3C) - 12 = -23\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, substitute back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Now, the product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs somewhere.\n\nStarting with the numerator after combining: C(x + 8) + D(x - 3). Plugging in C = -1 and D = 5:\n\n(-1)(x + 8) + 5(x - 3) = (-x -8) + (5x -15) = ( -x + 5x ) + (-8 -15 ) = 4x -23. Yep, that matches the right side. So my values are correct.\n\nSo, CD is indeed -5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), we first combine the left side over the common denominator and equate it to the right side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nExpanding and combining like terms:\n\n\\[\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nEquating coefficients:\n\n1. \\( C + D = 4 \\)\n2. \\( 8C - 3D = -23 \\)\n\nSolving the system:\n\nFrom equation 1, \\( D = 4 - C \\).
