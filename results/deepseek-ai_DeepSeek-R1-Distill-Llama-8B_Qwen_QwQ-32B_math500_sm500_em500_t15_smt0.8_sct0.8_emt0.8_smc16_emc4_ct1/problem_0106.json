            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of two integers, C and D, given that when I add the two fractions C/(x-3) and D/(x+8), it equals (4x - 23)/(x² + 5x -24) for all real x except -8 and 3. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you add two fractions, you need a common denominator. The denominators here are (x - 3) and (x + 8), so the common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me write that down.\n\nSo, the left side becomes C/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = [C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)]. That makes sense because when you add fractions, you multiply numerator and denominator appropriately.\n\nNow, the right side is given as (4x - 23)/(x² + 5x -24). Wait, I should factor the denominator on the right. Let me see, x² + 5x -24. Let me try factoring it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3, because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So, that factors into (x + 8)(x - 3). Perfect, so the denominator on the right is the same as the denominator on the left after combining the fractions.\n\nSo now, the equation simplifies to [C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)] = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]. Since the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal. So:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23.\n\nNow, I need to solve for C and D. Let me expand the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = (C + D)x + (8C - 3D).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) ="

            "output": " 4x - 23.\n\nNow, this equation must hold true for all real x except -8 and 3, so the coefficients of like terms must be equal. That means the coefficients of x on both sides must be equal, and the constant terms must be equal as well.\n\nSo, setting the coefficients equal:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4.\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23.\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4.\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23.\n\nI need to solve this system for C and D. Let me use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is better here. Let me try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's see:\n\nFrom Equation 1, D = 4 - C.\n\nSubstitute D into Equation 2:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23.\n\nExpand that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(8C + 3C) - 12 = -23.\n\n11C - 12 = -23.\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -11.\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1.\n\nNow, substitute C = -1 into Equation 1: D = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Therefore, the product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the original equation when combining the fractions gives the numerator as 4x - 23. Then, expanding C(x + 8) + D(x - 3) leads to (C + D)x + (8C - 3D). So the system of equations is correct.\n\nSolve for C = -1 and D = 5, which gives CD = -5. I think that's correct. Let me plug back into the original equation to test:\n\nC/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (-1)/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8).\n\nFind a common denominator: (x - 3)(x + 8).\n\nSo"
