            "output": "To determine after how many seconds both gears will next point north, I need to analyze their rotational speeds and the alignment condition.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the rotational speed of each gear per minute. The first gear turns \\( 33 \\frac{1}{3} \\) times per minute, which can be expressed as \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\) revolutions per minute. The second gear turns \\( 45 \\) times per minute, or \\( \\frac{45}{1} \\) revolutions per minute.\n\nNext, I'll determine their rotational speeds in revolutions per second by dividing their per-minute revolutions by 60. This gives the first gear \\( \\frac{100}{180} = \\frac{5}{9} \\) revolutions per second and the second gear \\( \\frac{45}{60} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) revolutions per second.\n\nNow, I'll identify the time intervals at which each gear completes a whole number of revolutions. The first gear completes an integer number of revolutions every \\( \\frac{180}{5} = 36 \\) seconds, while the second gear does so every \\( \\frac{80}{3} \\approx 26.\\overline{6} \\) seconds.\n\nFinally, to find when both gears align again pointing north, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of 36 and \\( \\frac{80}{3} \\). Calculating the LCM of these intervals will provide the next time both gears are in their initial position.\n</think>\n\nTo determine after how many seconds both gears will next point north, we need to analyze their rotational speeds and find the time when their marks align again.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Rotational Speeds**\n\n- **Gear 1** turns \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) times per minute.\n  \n  \\[\n  33\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\text{ revolutions per minute (rpm)}\n  \\]\n\n  To find revolutions per second (rps):\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{RPS}_1 = \\frac{100}{3} \\div 60 = \\frac{5}{9} \\text{ rev/s}\n  \\]\n\n- **Gear 2** turns \\( 45 \\) times per minute.\n  \n  \\[\n  \\text{RPS}_2 = \\frac{45}{60} = \\"
