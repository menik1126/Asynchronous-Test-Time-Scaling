The first gear turns at 33 1⁄3 rotations per minute, and the second gear turns at 45 rotations per minute. To make calculations easier, I'll convert these rotations into revolutions per second.\n\nNext, I'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods to determine when both gears will align their marks.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the time in seconds when this alignment occurs and convert minutes to seconds.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe have two gears:\n\n1. **Gear A** makes **33 \\frac{1}{3}** rotations per minute.\n2. **Gear B** makes **45** rotations per minute.\n\nInitially, both gears have a mark pointing **due north**. We need to find the time in seconds when both marks will align again pointing **due north**.\n\n### **Step 2: Convert Gear Speeds to Common Units**\n\nFirst, let's convert their rotation rates into **rotations per second (RPS)** to calculate the exact time when they align.\n\n1. **Gear A:**\n   - **33 \\frac{1}{3}** rotations per minute = **33.\\overline{3}** rotations per minute.\n   - Since 1 minute = 60 seconds,\n   - RPS = \\( 33.\\overline{3} \\div 60 \\approx 0.5556 \\) rotations per second.\n\n2. **Gear B:**\n   - **45** rotations per minute.\n   - RPS = \\( 45 \\div 60 = 0.75 \\) rotations per second.\n\n### **Step 3: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of Their Rotation Periods**\n\nTo find when both gears align again, we need to find the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of their rotation periods in seconds.\n\nHowever, since the rotation rates are **not** whole numbers, we'll convert them into whole numbers by multiplying to eliminate the decimal.\n\n- Let’s denote:\n  - \\( R_A = 0.5556 \\) rotations per second.\n  - \\( R_B = 0.75 \\) rotations per second.\n\n- To eliminate decimals:\n  - Multiply \\( R_A \\) by \\("

To find LCM of their periods, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)}\n\\]\n\nBut first, we need to find the **periods** (time for one full rotation) of each gear.\n\n- **Gear A's period (T_A)**:\n  - Period = \\( \\frac{1}{\\text{rotations per minute}} \\times 60 \\) seconds.\n  - \\( T_A = \\frac{1}{\\frac{100}{3}} \\times 60 = \\frac{3}{100} \\times 60 = 1.8 \\) seconds per rotation.\n\n- **Gear B's period (T_B)**:\n  - \\( T_B = \\frac{1}{45} \\times 60 = \\frac{60}{45} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.3333 \\) seconds per rotation.\n\n### **Step 6: Find LCM of Periods**\n\nNow, we need the LCM of **1.8 seconds** and **1.3333 seconds**. However, working with decimals complicates LCM calculation. Let's convert periods to fractions:\n\n- **Gear A's period**: \\( 1.8 = \\frac{9}{5} \\) seconds.\n- **Gear B's period**: \\( 1.3333 = \\frac{4}{3} \\) seconds.\n\nNow, find LCM of \\( \\frac{9}{5} \\) and"
