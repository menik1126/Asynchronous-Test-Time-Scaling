Since it's a fourth-degree equation, there are four roots, so it's a quadrilateral.\n\nBut what kind of quadrilateral? Maybe a square, rectangle, or something else.\n\nBut because the roots of \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\) are equally spaced around a circle with radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), shifting each point by subtracting \\( i \\) (which is equivalent to translating the entire figure downward by 1 unit) would result in a quadrilateral that's a translated version of a regular quadrilateral, but perhaps not a square.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the complex plane, if you have four points equally spaced on a circle, they form a regular quadrilateral, i.e., a square, but when you shift them, it might not be a square. However, if the shift is a translation, it's still a convex quadrilateral but might not be regular.\n\nWait, but the reason is that each root is on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), equally spaced every \\( \\pi/2 \\) radians (since for each \\( k \\), the angle increases by \\( \\pi/2 \\)). So, the four roots before translation are at angles \\( \\pi/16, 9\\pi/16, 17\\pi/16, 25\\pi/16 \\).\n\nTherefore, after translation by \\( -i \\), the points \\( z_k \\) will be located at a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), shifted down by 1 along the imaginary axis.\n\nBut the original shape before translation is a square rotated by some angle, because the four roots are spaced at 90 degrees apart.

However, this is only if the square is centered at (0, -1) and rotated, but when we translate the square down by 1 unit, does that affect the area? No, translation doesn't change the area. So the area should be the same as the original square before translation, which is \\( (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nWait, but hold on, the original roots are on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), so the distance from the center (origin) to each vertex is \\( 2^{1"

Because \\( 2^{5/4} = (2^{1/4})^5 = (16^{1/4})^5 \\) Hmm, actually \\( 2^{5/4} = (2^{1/4})^5 \\), but that might not be helpful.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the area can be expressed as \\( p^{a/b} \\), with \\( p \\) prime. Let me check if 2 is prime, which it is. So, \\( 2^{5/4} = 2^{5/4} \\), so \\( p = 2 \\), \\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 4 \\). So \\( a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \\).\n\nWait, but I should verify whether the polygon is indeed a square. The four roots are equally spaced around a circle, so they form a regular quadrilateral (a square), even after translation. So the area should be \\( (2^{5/8})^2 = 2^{5/4} \\), which is correct.

When you take the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), you get four points equally spaced on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\). So if you connect them, they form a square. Then, subtracting \\( i \\) from each root is a translation, which doesn't change the shape or size. So, yes, it's still a square with the same area.
