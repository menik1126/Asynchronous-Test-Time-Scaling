So, we have the equation \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\), and the solutions to this equation form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane. We need to find the area of this polygon and express it in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime. Then, compute \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nFirst, I notice that this equation is a quartic, which is a fourth-degree polynomial. Solving a quartic can be quite involved, but I remember that sometimes these can be factored into quadratics or even linear terms. The coefficients here involve complex numbers, specifically \\( i \\), which might hint at some pattern or substitution that can simplify the equation.\n\nLooking closer, the coefficients \\( 4z^3i \\) and \\( -4zi \\) make me think of the expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\). Let me recall the binomial expansion for \\( (z + w)^n \\). For the fourth power, it would be:\n\n\\( (z + w)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3w + 6z^2w^2 + 4zw^3 + w^4 \\).\n\nComparing this to our given equation:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, if I set \\( w = -i \\), what happens? Let's try that.\n\nWait, in the given equation, the coefficient of \\( z^4 \\) is 1, which matches. The coefficient of \\( z^3 \\) is \\( 4i \\), which would correspond to \\( 4w \\) if \\( w = i \\). However, in our equation, it's \\( +4z^3i \\), so that fits as \\( 4w \\) if \\( w = i \\). Then, the next term is \\( -6z^2 \\), which in the expansion would be \\( 6w^2 \\). So, if \\( w = i \\), \\( w^2 = -1 \\), so \\( 6w^2 = -6 \\), which"

If \\( w = i \\), then \\( w^3 = i^3 = -i \\), so \\( 4zw^3 = -4zi \\), which matches the term \\( -4zi \\) in the equation. Finally, the constant term would be \\( w^4 \\). Since \\( w = i \\), \\( w^4 = (i)^4 = 1 \\). But in the given equation, the constant term is \\( -i \\), not 1. \n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy here. The constant term in the expansion would be \\( w^4 = 1 \\), but in the equation it's \\( -i \\). So, that suggests that maybe the equation is similar to \\( (z + i)^4 \\) but with a different constant term. Let me write that out:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 -4zi + 1 \\).\n\nComparing to the given equation:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i = 0 \\).\n\nSo, the difference between the two is the constant term: in the expansion, it's +1, but in the equation, it's -i. Therefore, if we subtract \\( (1 + i) \\) from the expansion, we get the equation:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) = 0 \\).\n\nLet me check that:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) = z^4 +4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi +1 - (1 + i) = z^4 +4z^3i -6z^2 -4zi -i \\).\n\nYes! That works. So the original equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).\n\nAh, so this simplifies the problem a lot. Instead of dealing with the quartic equation directly, we can write it as \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\). Therefore, the solutions are the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\), shifted by \\( -i \\).\n\nSo, first,"

Then shifting each vertex by a fixed vector \\( -i \\) would move the entire square down by 1 unit.\n\nBut I need to confirm whether the resulting figure is still a regular polygon or not. Wait, because the shift is the same for each vertex, the distances between consecutive vertices remain the same, but the angles between the sides might change? Hmm, actually, no, the angles between the sides would remain the same because each vertex is shifted by the same amount, so the shape is just translated, not rotated or scaled.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Translating a polygon (shifting all vertices by the same vector) doesn't change the shape or the angles between the sides, it just moves it around in the plane. So the area remains the same as the original square.\n\nTherefore, the area of the polygon in the \\( z \\)-plane is the same as the area of the square in the \\( w \\)-plane.\n\nSo, if we can find the area of this square in the \\( w \\)-plane, that will be the area of the polygon in the \\( z \\)-plane"

The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is \\( 2r \\). The diagonal of a square is \\( s \\sqrt{2} \\), where \\( s \\) is the side length. Therefore, \\( s \\sqrt{2} = 2r \\implies s = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} r \\). Then, the area is \\( s^2 = 2 r^2 \\).\n\nAlternatively, the area can be calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{diagonal}^2 \\), which would be \\( \\frac{1}{2} (2r)^2 = 2 r^2 \\). Either way, the area is \\( 2 r^2 \\).\n\nIn our case, the radius \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\). Therefore, the area is \\( 2 \\times (2^{1/8})^2 = 2 \\times 2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check the radius again. The fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\) have magnitude equal to the fourth root of the modulus of \\( 1 + i \\). The modulus of \\( 1 + i \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), so the modulus of each root is \\( (\\sqrt{2})^{1/4} = (2^{1/2})^{1/4} = 2^{1/8} \\). So that's correct.

Since 5 is prime and doesn't divide 4, they are indeed coprime. So, the area is \\( 2^{5/4} \\), hence \\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), \\( p = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( a + b + p = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is the area really just the area of a square with side length \\( \\sqrt{2} r \\)? Or is there something wrong with that?\n\nWait, in the \\( w \\)-plane, the four roots are located on a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), each separated by an angle of \\( \\pi/2 \\) radians (since they are equally spaced fourth roots). So, in the \\( w \\)-plane, they form a square.\n\nWhen you shift each vertex by the same vector \\( -i \\), you get a translated square. So, the shape is a square, just moved, but not rotated. So, the side lengths remain the same, so the area is preserved.\n\nBut wait, let me visualize this in the complex plane. If all points are shifted downward by 1 unit, does that affect the area? No, because translation doesn't affect distances or angles, only position. So, yes, the area remains the same as the original square.\n\nSo, the area is \\( 2 \\times (2^{1/8})^2 = 2^{5/4} \\), as I computed earlier. Hmm, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent.\n\n\\( (2^{1/8})^2 = 2^{2/8} = 2^{1/4} \\). Then, \\( 2 \\times 2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4} \\).
