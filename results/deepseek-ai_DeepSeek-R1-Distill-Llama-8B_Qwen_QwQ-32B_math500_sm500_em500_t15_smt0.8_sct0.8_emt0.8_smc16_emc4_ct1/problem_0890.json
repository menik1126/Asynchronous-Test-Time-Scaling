            "output": "I need to convert the fraction 57/160 into a terminating decimal. I remember that a fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5 after simplifying.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize the denominator. 160 can be divided by 2, giving 80, and then by 2 again to get 40. Dividing by 2 once more results in 20, and once more by 2, which gives 10. Finally, dividing by 2 once more yields 5. So, 160 factors into 2⁵ × 5¹.\n\nSince the denominator only has prime factors of 2 and 5, I can now convert the fraction to a decimal by placing the denominator as a factor of 10. I'll do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to make the denominator 320, which is 32 × 10. \n\nNext, I'll divide 57 by 160 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 320. This simplifies to 57/320. To find the decimal, I'll divide 57 by 320. \n\nPerforming the division, 57 ÷ 320 equals 0.178125. To ensure the decimal terminates, I'll check that all prime factors in the denominator are 2s and 5s. Since 320 is 2⁶ × 5¹, the decimal terminates after the sixth decimal place.\n\nFinally, I'll round the result to six decimal places, which is 0.178125.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction $\\frac{57}{160}$ into a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Condition for Terminating Decimals:**\n   - A fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ will have a terminating decimal if the denominator $b$, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n2. **Factorize the Denominator:**\n   - Factorize 160:\n     \\[\n     160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n     \\]\n   - Since the denominator only has prime factors 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n\n3. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   - To convert $\\frac{57}{160}$ to a decimal, make the denominator a power of 10 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n     \\"

Instead, perform direct division:\n     \\[\n     57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\n     \\]\n   - Wait, this is incorrect. Let me recalculate:\n     - Divide 57 by 160:\n       - 160 goes into 570 (57.0) 3 times (3×160 = 480), subtract to get 90.\n       - Bring down a 0: 900. 160 goes into 900 5 times (5×160 = 800), subtract to get 100.\n       - Bring down a 0: 1000. 160 goes into 1000 6 times (6×160 = 960), subtract to get 40.\n       - Bring down a 0: 400. 160 goes into 400 2 times (2×160 = 320), subtract to get 80.\n       - Bring down a 0: 800. 160 goes into 800 5 times (5×160 = 800), subtract to get 0.\n     - The result is $0.35625$.\n\n4. **Verify the Decimal Terminates:**\n   - The division terminates at the fifth decimal place, confirming it is a terminating decimal.\n\n\\boxed{0.35625}"
