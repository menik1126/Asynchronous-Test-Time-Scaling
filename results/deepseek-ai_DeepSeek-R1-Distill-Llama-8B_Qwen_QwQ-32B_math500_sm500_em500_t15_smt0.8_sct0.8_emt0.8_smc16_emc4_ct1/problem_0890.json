            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, I first need to determine whether it has a prime factor of 2 or 5. This is because only fractions with prime factors of 2 or 5 will result in terminating decimals when converted. \n\nLooking at the denominator, 160, I notice that it can be factored into \\(2^5 \\times 5\\). This means the fraction has both 2 and 5 as prime factors.\n\nNext, since the denominator has only 2 and 5 as its prime factors, the decimal representation of \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) will terminate. \n\nTo find the decimal, I'll divide the numerator by the denominator. So, I'll divide 57 by 160.\n\nPerforming the division, 57 divided by 160 is 0.35625.\n\nThus, the terminating decimal representation of \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) is 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Prime Factors:**\n   - The denominator is 160.\n   - Factorize 160 into prime factors: \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5\\).\n   - For a fraction to convert into a terminating decimal, the denominator must only have prime factors of 2 and/or 5.\n\n2. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal:**\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = 57 \\div 160\n     \\]\n   - Perform the division:\n     \\[\n     57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{0.35625}\n   \\]"
