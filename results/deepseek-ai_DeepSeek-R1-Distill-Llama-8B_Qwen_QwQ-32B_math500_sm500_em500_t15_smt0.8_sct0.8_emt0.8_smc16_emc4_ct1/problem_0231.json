Starting at the origin (0,0), moving south decreases the y-coordinate.\n\nAfter walking 1/2 mile south, his position is at (0, -1/2).\n\nNext, moving 3/4 mile east increases the x-coordinate by 3/4, bringing him to (3/4, -1/2).\n\nFinally, moving another 1/2 mile south places him at (3/4, -1).\n\nTo find the straight-line distance from the starting point (0,0) to his final position (3/4, -1), I'll use the distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\n\nPlugging in the values, the distance is sqrt((3/4)^2 + (-1)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.75 + 1) ≈ sqrt(1.75) ≈ 1.322.\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, the distance is approximately 1.32 miles.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step to determine how far Bill is from his starting point in a straight line.\n\n### **Step 1: Represent Bill's Movements on a Coordinate System**\nWe'll use a coordinate system where:\n- The starting point is at the origin: \\( (0, 0) \\).\n- Moving **south** decreases the **y-coordinate**.\n- Moving **east** increases the **x-coordinate**.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Bill's Final Position**\nLet's track Bill's movements:\n\n1. **First Movement:**  \n   Bill walks \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile **south**.  \n   - **New Position:** \\( (0, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\).\n\n2. **Second Movement:**  \n   Bill walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile **east**.  \n   - **New Position:** \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{1}{2}) \\).\n\n3. **Third Movement:**  \n   Bill walks another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile **south**.  \n   - **Final Position:** \\( (\\frac{3}{4}, -1) \\).\n\n### **Step 3: Use the Distance Formula**\nTo find the straight-line distance from Bill's final position \\( (\\frac{"
