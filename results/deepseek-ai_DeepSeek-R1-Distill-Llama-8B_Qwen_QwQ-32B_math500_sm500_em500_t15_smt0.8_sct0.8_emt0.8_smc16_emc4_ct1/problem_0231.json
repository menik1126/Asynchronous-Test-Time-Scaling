Finally, he walks another 0.5 miles south, adding to his southern distance.\n\nCalculating the total distance walked doesn't give the straight-line distance directly. Instead, I need to form a right triangle. The legs of the triangle represent the east and south distances, and the hypotenuse will be the straight-line distance from the starting point.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(0.75)^2 + (1.0)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5625 + 1.0} \\approx \\sqrt{1.5625} \\approx 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nSo, Bill is approximately 1.25 miles away from his starting point.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find the straight-line distance between Bill's starting point and his final position.\n\n1. **Determine the total distance Bill walks south:**\n   - First, he walks \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - Then, he walks another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n   - **Total southward distance:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile.\n\n2. **Calculate the eastward distance:**\n   - Bill walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n\n3. **Visualize the path as a right triangle:**\n   - The southward and eastward distances form the two legs of a right triangle.\n   - The straight-line distance from the starting point to Bill's final position is the hypotenuse of this triangle.\n\n4. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{East distance})^2 + (\\text{South distance})^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + (1)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n   \\"
