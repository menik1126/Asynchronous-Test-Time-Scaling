I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's make sense of the rectangle. AB is the length, and AD is the width. The ratio AB/AD is given as k, which means that AB is k times AD. Maybe it would help to assign some actual lengths to AB and AD to make it more concrete. Let's say AD = x, then AB would be kx. So, the sides of the rectangle are kx and x. \n\nSince the rectangle is centered at O, the coordinates of the center would be the midpoint of both AB and AD. If I consider a coordinate system where O is at (0,0), then the rectangle would extend from (-kx/2, -x/2) to (kx/2, x/2). That way, the center is at (0,0), and the sides are symmetric about both axes.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Probability is typically the area of the region where the condition holds divided by the total area. So I need to find the area where the distance from the point to O is less than the distance to any of the four vertices.\n\nLet me think about the distance from a point to O and to the vertices. If P is any point inside the rectangle with coordinates (a, b), then the distance from P to O is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). The distance from P to each vertex can be found using the distance formula as well.\n\nThe four vertices are A, B, C, D. Let me write down their coordinates. If the rectangle goes from (-kx/2, -x/2) to (kx/2, x/2), then:\n\n- A is (-kx/2, x/2)\n- B is (kx/2, x/2)\n- C is (kx/2, -x/2)\n- D is (-kx/2, -x/2)\n\nSo, for a point P = (a, b), the distances to each vertex would be:\n\n- To A"

That means for every point in this region, the distance to O must be less than the distance to A, B, C, and D individually. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think of regions where the point is closer to O than to any vertex. The set of points closer to O than to a vertex would be the region inside the rectangle where the distance to O is less than the distance to that vertex. The intersection of all these regions (closer to O than A, than B, than C, than D) is the region we need.\n\nAlternatively, since all four vertices are symmetrical in the rectangle, maybe the regions where points are closer to O than each vertex can be found by constructing perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex. The intersection of all these regions would form the area where the point is closer to O than any vertex.\n\nLet me recall that the set of points equidistant to two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting those two points. So, for each vertex V (A, B, C, D), the points equidistant to O and V lie on the perpendicular bisector between O and V. The region where points are closer to O than to V would be on the O side of this bisector. The intersection of all four such regions (closer to O than A, B, C, D) would then be the area where the distances satisfy all four conditions.\n\nTherefore, to find the desired region, we need to find the intersection of all four half-planes (each bounded by the perpendicular bisector between O and each vertex, on the side of O). The area of this intersection divided by the area of the rectangle will be the probability.\n\nSo let's try to find the equations for these perpendicular bisectors.\n\nStarting with vertex A. Let's use coordinates. Let me choose coordinates so that the rectangle has center at (0,"

Wait, AD is x, and AB is kx, so maybe let me set AD = 1, so x = 1, making AB = k. Then the rectangle goes from (-k/2, -1/2) to (k/2, 1/2). So points would be:\n\n- A: (-k/2, 1/2)\n- B: (k/2, 1/2)\n- C: (k/2, -1/2)\n- D: (-k/2, -1/2)\n\nSo the center O is (0,0). Now, the distance from a point (a, b) to O is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), as before. The distance from (a, b) to A is sqrt[(a + k/2)\u00b2 + (b - 1/2)\u00b2]. The perpendicular bisector between O and A is the set of points equidistant to O and A.
