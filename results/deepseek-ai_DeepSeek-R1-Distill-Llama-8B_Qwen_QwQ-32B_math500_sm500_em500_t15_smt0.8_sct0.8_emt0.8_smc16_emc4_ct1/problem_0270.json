            "output": "I need to determine the value of 56 Drinkets in terms of Trinkets in the land of Ink.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the given exchange rates. One Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, and 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets.\n\nNext, I'll find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to one Trinket by dividing the number of Drinkets by the number of Blinkets per Drinket. So, 7 Drinkets equal 3 Blinkets, which means 1 Drinket equals 3/7 Blinkets.\n\nThen, I'll convert Drinkets to Blinkets by multiplying the number of Drinkets by the equivalent Blinkets per Drinket. For 56 Drinkets, that's 56 × (3/7) = 24 Blinkets.\n\nFinally, I'll convert Blinkets to Trinkets by dividing the number of Blinkets by the Trinkets per Blinket. So, 24 Blinkets divided by 4 Blinkets per Trinket equals 6 Trinkets.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are worth 6 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conversion Factors:**\n   - **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**\n   - **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**\n\n2. **Find the Relationship Between Drinkets and Trinkets:**\n   - From the second conversion, we know that 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets. Therefore:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ Drinket} = \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets}\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Convert 56 Drinkets to Blinkets:**\n   - Multiply the number of Drinkets by the equivalent in Blinkets:\n     \\[\n     56 \\text{ Drinkets} \\times \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets per Drinket} = 24 \\text{ Blinkets}\n     \\]\n   \n4. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:**\n   - Since 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets:\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ Blinkets} \\div 4 \\text{ Blinkets per Trinket} = 6 \\text{ Trinkets}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"
