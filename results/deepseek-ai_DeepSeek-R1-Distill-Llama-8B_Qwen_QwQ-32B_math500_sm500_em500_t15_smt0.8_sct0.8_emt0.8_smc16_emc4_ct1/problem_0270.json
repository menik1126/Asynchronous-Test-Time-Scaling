            "output": "First, I need to understand the relationships between the different types of currency in the land of Ink.\n\nI know that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets. This means that Trinkets are more valuable than Blinkets. \n\nNext, the problem states that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. From this, I can determine how many Drinkets make up a Blinket by dividing both sides of the equation by 3. This gives me the ratio of 1 Blinket to approximately 2.333 Drinkets.\n\nNow, I want to find out how much 56 Drinkets are worth in Trinkets. Since 3 Blinkets equal 7 Drinkets, I can calculate the number of Blinkets in 56 Drinkets by multiplying 56 by (3/7). This gives me 24 Blinkets.\n\nFinally, since 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, I can find out how many Trinkets 24 Blinkets are worth by dividing 24 by 4. This means 24 Blinkets equal 6 Trinkets.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are worth 6 Trinkets in the land of Ink.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step using the relationships provided:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - **Trinkets to Blinkets:** \\(1 \\text{ Trinket} = 4 \\text{ Blinkets}\\)\n   - **Blinkets to Drinkets:** \\(3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets}\\)\n\n2. **Find the Value of 1 Blinket in Drinkets:**\n   - From \\(3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets}\\), we can find how many Drinkets are in 1 Blinket:\n     \\[\n     1 \\text{ Blinket} = \\frac{7}{3} \\text{ Drinkets} \\approx 2.333 \\text{ Drinkets}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert 56 Drinkets to Blinkets:**\n   - Since \\(1 \\text{ Blinket} = \\frac{7}{3} \\text{ Drinkets}\\), the number of Blinkets in 56 Drinkets is:\n     \\[\n     56 \\text{ Drinkets} \\div \\frac{7}{3} = 56 \\times \\frac{3}{7} ="
