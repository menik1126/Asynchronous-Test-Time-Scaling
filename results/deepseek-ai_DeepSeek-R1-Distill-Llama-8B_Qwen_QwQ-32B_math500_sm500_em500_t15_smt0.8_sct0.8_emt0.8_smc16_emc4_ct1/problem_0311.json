            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem about the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 - 5x -14). The question is asking for the sum of the vertical asymptotes a and b, plus the horizontal asymptote c, so a + b + c. Hmm, okay. I need to figure out where the vertical and horizontal asymptotes are for this function.\n\nFirst, let me recall what vertical and horizontal asymptotes are. Vertical asymptotes happen where the denominator of the function equals zero, provided that the numerator isn't zero there as well. So, to find vertical asymptotes, I need to factor the denominator and see where it's zero. For horizontal asymptotes, the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity or negative infinity will determine the value it approaches, which is the horizontal asymptote.\n\nLet me start by factoring the denominator. The denominator is x\u00b2 - 5x -14. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Let me think... Hmm, factors of -14 are 1 and -14, 2 and -7. Okay, 2 and -7 add up to -5? Yes, 2 + (-7) equals -5. So that factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). Let me double-check that:\n\n(x + 2)(x - 7) = x\u00b2 - 7x + 2x -14 = x\u00b2 -5x -14. Perfect, that's correct.\n\nSo the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So a = -2 and b = 7. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, for the horizontal asymptote, I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The function is f(x) = 2x / (x\u00b2 -5x -14). The numerator is a linear term (degree 1) and the denominator is quadratic (degree 2). I remember that if the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients. If the numerator is higher, there isn't a horizontal asymptote but maybe an oblique one.\n\nIn this case, since the"

            "output": " numerator is degree 1 and denominator is degree 2, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So c = 0.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So as x approaches infinity, the function f(x) = (2x)/(x\u00b2 -5x -14). Dividing numerator and denominator by x\u00b2, we get:\n\n(2/x) / (1 - 5/x -14/x\u00b2). As x approaches infinity, 5/x and 14/x\u00b2 approach 0, so the function approaches (2/x)/1, which is 0. Yep, so horizontal asymptote is y=0. So c=0.\n\nTherefore, a = -2, b=7, c=0. So a + b + c is (-2) +7 +0. That's 5. So the sum is 5.\n\nBut hold on, wait. The problem says vertical asymptotes at x = a and x = b. But in my factoring, I had (x + 2)(x -7), so the roots are at x = -2 and x = 7, so vertical asymptotes there. So a and b are -2 and 7. So their sum is (-2) +7=5, plus c=0, so 5+0=5. So the answer is 5.\n\nIs there a chance I made a mistake in factoring the denominator? Let me check again. x\u00b2 -5x -14. If I factor it as (x + a)(x + b) = x\u00b2 + (a + b)x + ab. So, I need ab = -14 and a + b= -5. Wait, earlier I thought it was 2 and -7, but 2*(-7)= -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. That's correct. So factors are (x +2)(x -7). So vertical asymptotes at -2 and 7, yes.\n\nAlternatively, if I had tried different factors, like -2 and 7, same thing. So signs are correct. So vertical asymptotes at x=-2 and x=7.\n\nSo a + b = (-2) +7=5, and c=0. So total is 5.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be 5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first factor the denominator of the function"
