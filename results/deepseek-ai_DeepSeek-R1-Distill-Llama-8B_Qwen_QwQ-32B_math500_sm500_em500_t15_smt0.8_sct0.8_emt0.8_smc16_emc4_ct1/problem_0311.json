            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x -14). I need to find the sum of the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote. Hmm, vertical asymptotes and horizontal asymptotes... I remember they have to do with the behavior of the function as x approaches infinity or some specific values. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, for vertical asymptotes, I know they occur where the denominator is zero but the numerator isn't zero at those points. So, I should factor the denominator to find those x-values where it equals zero. The denominator is x² -5x -14. Let me try factoring that.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 are... 2 and -7, because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. Oh, perfect! So, the denominator factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). So, the denominator is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x - 7 = 0, which means x = -2 and x = 7. \n\nNow, I need to check if the numerator is zero at these points. The numerator is 2x. If x = -2, then 2*(-2) = -4, which isn't zero. If x = 7, 2*7 = 14, which is also not zero. So, both x = -2 and x = 7 are vertical asymptotes. That means a = -2 and b = 7.\n\nNow, moving on to the horizontal asymptote. I remember that the rules for horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator here is 1 (since it's linear, 2x) and the degree of the denominator is 2 (since it's quadratic, x² -5x -14). \n\nWhen the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. But wait, let me make sure. Let me recall... Yes, if the degree of the numerator is less, it's y = 0. If they are equal, it's the ratio of leading coefficients. If the numerator's degree is higher, it's y approaching infinity or"

So c = 0.\n\nTherefore, a is -2, b is 7, and c is 0. Adding them together: -2 + 7 + 0 = 5. Wait, but let me double-check everything to be sure.\n\nFirst, vertical asymptotes: denominator factors to (x+2)(x-7), so x = -2 and 7. Correct. The numerator isn't zero there, so yes, vertical asymptotes at those points. \n\nHorizontal asymptote: since the denominator's degree is higher, the horizontal asymptote is indeed y=0. \n\nSo adding them: -2 +7 is 5, plus 0 is 5. Hmm, but wait, the question says \"vertical asymptotes x=a and x=b\". So a and b are the two roots, but does the order matter? Like, a is the smaller one? The problem doesn't specify, but since they are just two numbers, their sum is the same regardless. So -2 +7 is 5, plus 0 gives 5. \n\nWait, but let me check the horizontal asymptote again. Maybe I made a mistake there. Let me think of the function as (2x)/(x² -5x -14). As x approaches infinity, the highest degree terms dominate, so the numerator behaves like 2x and the denominator like x². So the function behaves like (2x)/(x²) = 2/x. As x approaches infinity, 2/x approaches 0. So yes, horizontal asymptote at y=0. So c is indeed 0. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5. \n\nWait, but let me check if I factored the denominator correctly. x² -5x -14. Let me expand (x+2)(x-7): x*x = x², x*(-7) + 2*x = -7x +2x = -5x, and 2*(-7) = -14. Yes, that's correct. So the roots are indeed -2 and 7. \n\nHmm, seems like everything checks out. So a + b + c = (-2) +7 +0 =5. \n\nI think that's it. I don't"
