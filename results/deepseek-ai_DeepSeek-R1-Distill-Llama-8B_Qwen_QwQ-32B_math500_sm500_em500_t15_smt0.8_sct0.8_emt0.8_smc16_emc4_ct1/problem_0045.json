So, 2 is a divisor.\n\n142 divided by 2 equals 71. Therefore, 2 and 71 are prime factors of 284.\n\nNow, listing all divisors: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and 284.\n\nSince we're only interested in proper divisors, I exclude 284.\n\nThe proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142.\n\nAdding these together gives a total of 220.\n\nFinally, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220.\n\nI'll repeat the process for 220, finding its proper divisors and summing them.\n\nThe proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, and 220. Excluding 220.\n\nAdding these together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110.\n\nCalculating the sum gives 372.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 372.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n   \n   - **Step 1:** Factorize 284.\n     \\[\n     284 = 2 \\times 142 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 71 = 2^2 \\times 71\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Step 2:** List all divisors of 284.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Divisors of } 284 = 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, 284\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Step 3:** Exclude 284 to find proper divisors.\n"
