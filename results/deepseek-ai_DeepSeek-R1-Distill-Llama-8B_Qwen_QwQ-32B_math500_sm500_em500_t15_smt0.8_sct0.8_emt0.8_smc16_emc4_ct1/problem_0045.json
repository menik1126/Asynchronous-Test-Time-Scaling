            "output": "To determine the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284, I'll start by finding all the proper divisors of 284.\n\nFirst, I'll perform prime factorization on 284. Breaking it down, 284 can be expressed as 4 multiplied by 71, and since 4 is \\(2^2\\), the prime factors of 284 are 2, 2, and 71.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \\((1 + p + p^2 + \\dots + p^k)\\) for each prime \\(p\\) raised to the power \\(k\\) in the factorization, I'll calculate the total sum of all divisors of 284. This gives me \\(1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 + 284 = 504\\).\n\nNext, I'll subtract 284 from this total to find the sum of the proper divisors: \\(504 - 284 = 220\\).\n\nNow, I'll find the proper divisors of 220. The prime factors of 220 are 2, 2, 5, and 11. Applying the sum of divisors formula again, I calculate the total sum of all divisors, which is \\(1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 + 220 = 504\\).\n\nTo get the sum of the proper divisors of 220, I'll subtract 220 from 504, resulting in \\(504 - 220 = 284\\).\n\nFinally, I'll determine the sum of the proper divisors of 284, which we found earlier to be 220. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284:**\n   \n   - **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n     \\[\n     284 = 4 \\times 71 = 2^2 \\times 71\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Sum of all divisors (including 284):**\n     \\[\n     (1 + 2 + 4) \\times (1 + 71) = 7 \\times 72 = 504\n     \\]\n   \n   -"
