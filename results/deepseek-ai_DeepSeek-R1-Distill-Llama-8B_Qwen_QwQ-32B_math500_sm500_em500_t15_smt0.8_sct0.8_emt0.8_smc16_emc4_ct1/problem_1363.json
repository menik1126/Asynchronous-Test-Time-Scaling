There are 35 students in total, and the number of girls is a multiple of 13. Let's denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B.\n\nSo, G is a multiple of 13, which means G can be 13, 26, etc. Since there are more girls than boys, I know that G is greater than B. This gives me two equations:\n\nG + B = 35\n\nG > B\n\nI'll start by checking the lowest possible value for G, which is 13. If G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. But this contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys because 13 is not greater than 22.\n\nNext, I'll check the next multiple of 13, which is 26. If G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. This satisfies the condition since 26 is greater than 9.\n\nTo ensure there are no more valid multiples, I'll check G = 39. However, 39 exceeds the total number of students, so this is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is when there are 26 girls and 9 boys attending the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13.\n- There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Let's denote:**\n- Number of girls = G\n- Number of boys = B\n\n**From the problem, we have the following equation:**\n\\[ G + B = 35 \\]\n\n**Since G is a multiple of 13, possible values for G are:**\n1. \\( G = 13 \\)\n2. \\( G = 26 \\)\n3. \\( G = 39 \\) (but 39 is more than 35, so not possible)\n\n**Now, we'll check each possible value of G:**\n\n1. **If \\( G = 13 \\):**\n   \\[ B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\]\n   - But this contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys (since \\( 13 > 22 \\) is false).\n\n2. **If \\( G = 26 \\):**\n  "
