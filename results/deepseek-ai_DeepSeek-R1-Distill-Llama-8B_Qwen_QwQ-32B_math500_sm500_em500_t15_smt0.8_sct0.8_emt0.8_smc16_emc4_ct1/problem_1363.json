Let's define variables to represent the unknowns.\n\nLet \\( g \\) represent the number of girls and \\( b \\) represent the number of boys. According to the problem, the total number of students is 35.\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\\[\ng + b = 35\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, the problem states that the number of girls is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys.\n\nFrom the first condition, \\( g = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nFrom the second condition, \\( g > b \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( g \\) in the total equation:\n\\[\n13k + b = 35\n\\]\nThis can be rearranged to:\n\\[\nb = 35 - 13k\n\\]\n\nSince the number of boys cannot be negative or more than the total number of students, we can set up inequalities:\n\\[\n0 < 35 - 13k \\leq 35\n\\]\nThis implies that \\( k \\) must be less than 3.\n\nTesting \\( k = 1 \\):\n\\[\ng = 13 \\times 1 = 13 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = 35 - 13 = 22\n\\]\nHowever, this results in \\( g = 13 \\) and \\( b = 22 \\), which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nTesting \\( k = 2 \\):\n\\[\ng = 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = 35 - 26 = 9\n\\]\nHere, \\( g = 26 \\) and \\( b = 9 \\), which satisfies both conditions.\n\nTesting \\( k = 3 \\):\n\\[\ng = 13 \\times 3 = 39 \\quad \\text{which exceeds the total number of students}\n\\]\nThus, the only valid solution is when \\( k = 2 \\), leading to 9 boys.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( g \\) be the number of girls.\n   - Let \\( b \\) be the number of boys.\n   - Total number of students: \\( g + b = 35 \\).\n\n2. **Given Conditions:**\n  "
