Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably try to understand the constraint given: \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). That seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate it somehow. Since all variables are positive, I don't have to worry about division by zero or negative numbers, which is good.\n\nNow, the expression I need to minimize is \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Expanding this might help, so let's do that. If I multiply it out, I get:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. So it's a combination of products of the variables. Maybe there's a way to relate this to the given constraint.\n\nI wonder if I can use some inequality here. The AM-GM inequality is often useful for optimization problems with positive variables. Let me recall that the AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.\n\nBut before I jump into applying inequalities, perhaps I should try substituting variables or expressing some variables in terms of others. Let me see.\n\nThe constraint is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). So, if I define S = x + y + z, then the constraint becomes \\(xyzS = 1\\).\n\nI need to find the minimum of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\). Hmm, maybe I can express S in terms of something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe set some variables equal to each other to simplify. In optimization problems with symmetric expressions, sometimes assuming variables are equal gives the extremum. Although, here the expression isn't symmetric in all three variables, only in x and z because of the (x + y)(y + z). Hmm, perhaps setting x = z? Let me try that assumption.\n\nLet\u2019s assume x = z. Then, the constraint becomes \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot x \\cdot (x + y + x) = 1\\), which simplifies to \\(x^2 y (2"

So, that simplifies to \\((x + y)^2\\). \n\nSo, if I can minimize \\((x + y)^2 given that \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\), perhaps that's easier. \n\nHmm, maybe that's a path. Let me let t = x/y. So, substituting x = t y. Then, the constraint becomes \\( (t y)^2 y (2 t y + y ) = t^2 y^2 \\cdot y \\cdot y(2t +1) ) = t^2 y^3 \\cdot y (2t +1) \\). Wait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let me do that again. If x = t y, then substituting into the constraint:\n\n\\( x^2 y (2x + y) = (t y)^2 * y * (2 t y + y) = t\u00b2 y\u00b2 * y * y(2t + 1) = t\u00b2 y^4 (2t + 1) = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( y^4 = 1 / (t\u00b2 (2t + 1)) \\), so y = [1 / (t\u00b2 (2t + 1))]^{1/4}.\n\nThen, the expression to minimize is (x + y)^2 = (t y + y)^2 = y\u00b2 (t + 1)^2.\n\nSubstituting y from above,\n\nExpression = [ (t +1)^2 / (t\u00b2 (2t +1))^{1/2} } ].\n\nHmm, so Expression = (t +1)^2 / [ t^{1} (2t +1)^{1/2} ) ].\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can set f(t) = (t +1)^2 / [ t (2t +1)^{1/2} } ] and find its minimum for t > 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better substitution or another method. Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption that x = z is incorrect? Let me check the problem again. The expression (x + y)(y + z) might be symmetric if x and z are equal, so that might"

But perhaps instead of assuming that, I should use Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum.\n\nWait, Lagrange multipliers might be a good approach here. Let me recall how that works. For a function f(x, y, z) with a constraint g(x, y, z) = 0, the extremum occurs where the gradient of f is proportional to the gradient of g. So, here, f(x, y, z) = (x + y)(y + z) and g(x, y, z) = xyz(x + y + z) -1 = 0.\n\nSo, I can set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL = (x + y)(y + z) - \u03bb [xyz(x + y + z) -1]\n\nTaking partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, z, and \u03bb, and setting them equal to zero.\n\nLet me compute the partial derivatives:\n\nFirst, \u2202L/\u2202x: derivative of (x + y)(y + z) with respect to x is (1)(y + z).\n\nDerivative of the constraint term: -\u03bb [ yz(x + y + z) + xyz(1) ] = -\u03bb [ yz(x + y + z) + xyz ].\n\nSo, partial derivative is:\n\n( y + z ) - \u03bb [ yz(x + y + z) + xyz ] = 0.\n\nSimilarly, \u2202L/\u2202y: derivative of (x + y)(y + z) is (1)(y + z) + (x + y)(1) = (y + z) + (x + y) = x + 2y + z.\n\nDerivative of the constraint term: -\u03bb [ xz(x + y + z) + xyz(1) ] = -\u03bb [ xz(x + y + z) + xyz ].\n\nSo, partial derivative is:\n\nx + 2y + z - \u03bb [ xz(x + y + z) + xyz ] = 0.\n\n\u2202L/\u2202z: derivative of (x + y)(y + z) with respect to z is (x + y)(1) = x + y.\n\nDerivative of constraint term: -\u03bb [ xy(x + y + z) + xyz(1) ] = -\u03bb [ xy(x + y + z) + xyz ].\n\nSo,"
