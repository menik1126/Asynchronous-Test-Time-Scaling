Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's given. We have three variables: \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), all positive. The condition is that their product times their sum equals 1. So, \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). And I need to find the minimum of the product \\((x + y)(y + z)\\).\n\nI remember from algebra that when dealing with minimization or maximization problems under certain constraints, Lagrange multipliers can be useful. But I also recall that sometimes AM-GM inequality can help in such cases. Let me think about whether AM-GM can be applied here.\n\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, with equality when all numbers are equal. Maybe I can use AM-GM on the terms in the given condition or the expression I need to minimize.\n\nLet me try to express \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) in a different way to see if I can find a relation to the given condition. Expanding the product gives:\n\n\\[\n(x + y)(y + z) = xy + y^2 + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nHmm, that doesn't immediately look helpful. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Since the problem involves products and sums, perhaps introducing new variables or normalizing the variables could help.\n\nLet me consider setting \\(a = x\\), \\(b = y\\), and \\(c = z\\), just to make it easier to write. So, we have:\n\n\\[\nabc(a + b + c) = 1\n\\]\nand we need to minimize \\((a + b)(b + c)\\).\n\nI wonder if there's a substitution or a substitution that can link these two expressions. Alternatively, maybe expressing the problem in terms of symmetric variables or using symmetry.\n\nWait, since the product \\(abc(a + b + c) = 1\\), maybe I can express one variable in terms"

Alternatively, perhaps assuming some symmetry between variables?\n\nLooking at the expression to minimize, \\((x + y)(y + z)\\), it's symmetric in \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) with respect to \\(y\\). Maybe setting \\(x = z\\) could lead to a simpler problem? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose \\(x = z\\). Then, the condition becomes \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot x (x + y + x) = x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\). The expression to minimize becomes \\((x + y)(y + x) = (x + y)^2\\). Wait, that's interesting. If \\(x = z\\), then \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) simplifies to \\((x + y)^2\\). So, maybe the minimum occurs when \\(x = z\\)? Let me check if that's a valid assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal value occurs when \\(x = z\\), so I can proceed under that assumption and see if it leads to a solution. If it does, then maybe that's the case. Let's try that approach.\n\nLet me set \\(x = z\\). Then, the problem reduces to two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The constraint becomes \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\), and the expression to minimize is \\((x + y)^2\\).\n\nSo, now I can try to minimize \\((x + y)^2\\) subject to \\(x^2 y (2x + y) = 1\\).
