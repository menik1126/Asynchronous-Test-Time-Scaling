            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O. The rectangle's sides have a ratio AB/AD = k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, that sounds like a geometry probability problem. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nFirst, I should probably sketch the rectangle and the center O. The rectangle has four vertices: A, B, C, D. Since O is the center, it's the intersection point of the diagonals. The ratio AB/AD = k tells me that the length of side AB is k times the length of side AD. So, if I let AD = x, then AB = kx. Maybe it's easier to assign specific lengths to make calculations simpler. Let me assume that the rectangle is centered at the origin (0,0) for simplicity, so O is at (0,0).\n\nSo, if the rectangle is centered at the origin and has sides AB and AD, then the coordinates of the vertices would be: A at (-AB/2, AD/2), B at (AB/2, AD/2), C at (AB/2, -AD/2), and D at (-AB/2, -AD/2). Wait, maybe I should define AB as the horizontal side and AD as the vertical side. Let me make sure: in a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths unless it's a square. So, AB is the length of the top side from A to B, and AD is the length from A to D, which would be the vertical side.\n\nTherefore, the rectangle has width AB = k*AD. Let me denote AD = y, so AB = ky. Then, the rectangle extends from (-AB/2, AD/2) to (AB/2, AD/2) in the x-direction and from (-AD/2, -AD/2) to (AD/2, AD/2) in the y-direction. Wait, no, that's not quite right. If AD is the vertical side, then the rectangle would extend from y = -AD/2 to y = AD/2 and from x = -AB/2 to x = AB/2. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the vertices would be:\n- A: (-AB/2, AD/2)\n-"

Then AB would be 2k, so the horizontal half-length is k. That way, the rectangle extends from x = -k to x = k and y = -1 to y = 1. That might make calculations easier because the coordinates will be symmetric around the origin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to let AD = 1, so AB = k. Then the rectangle would have width AB = k and height AD = 1. Then the coordinates would be from x = -k/2 to k/2 and y = -0.5 to 0.5. Hmm, but maybe even better to set AD = 2 and AB = 2k so that the coordinates are integers? Not sure. Maybe scaling won't matter because we can use variables. Let me try to keep it general.\n\nLet me denote the rectangle with length AB = 2a and AD = 2b, so that the center O is at (0,0), and the rectangle extends from (-a, -b) to (a, b). Then the ratio AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, a = k*b. Therefore, the rectangle has dimensions 2a by 2b, with a = k*b. So, in terms of b, the rectangle is 2k*b by 2b. But maybe it's better to set b = 1, so that a = k. Then the rectangle is from x = -k to k and y = -1 to 1. That might be simpler. Let me do that.\n\nSo, let me set AD = 2 (so half of AD is 1), so the vertical sides are from y = -1 to y = 1. Then AB = 2k, so the horizontal sides are from x = -k to x = k. Therefore, the rectangle has width 2k and height 2. The center is at (0,0). The vertices are at (-k,1), (k,"

So, the probability will be the area where the point is closer to O than to A, B, C, or D, divided by the total area of the rectangle.\n\nSo, the total area of the rectangle is (2k)*(2) = 4k. So, the denominator will be 4k. The numerator is the area where the distance from (x,y) to O is less than the distance from (x,y) to any of the four vertices.\n\nSo, mathematically, for a point (x,y) in the rectangle, the condition is:\ndistance to O < distance to A,\ndistance to O < distance to B,\ndistance to O < distance to C,\ndistance to O < distance to D.\n\nSo, let me write the distance conditions.\n\nDistance from (x,y) to O: sqrt(x^2 + y^2). \n\nDistance to A: distance from (x,y) to (-k,1):\n\nsqrt((x + k)^2 + (y - 1)^2).\n\nSimilarly, distance to B: sqrt((x - k)^2 + (y - 1)^2).\n\nDistance to C: sqrt((x - k)^2 + (y + 1)^2).\n\nDistance to D: sqrt((x + k)^2 + (y + 1)^2).\n\nSo, the condition is that sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt((x + k)^2 + (y - 1)^2),\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt((x - k)^2 + (y - 1)^2),\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt((x - k)^2 + (y + 1)^2),\n\nsqrt(x^2 + y^2) < sqrt((x + k)^2 + (y + 1)^2).\n\nSince both sides are positive, we can square both sides of the inequality without changing the inequality signs.\n\nSo, let me square each inequality to get rid of the square roots.\n\nFirst inequality:\n\nx^2 + y^2 < (x + k)^2 + (y - 1)^2.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(x^2 + 2k x + k^"
