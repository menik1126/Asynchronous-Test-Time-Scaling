Since \\(2^8 = 256\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the exponentiation rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\) to simplify the right side: \\(2^{2x} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, both sides of the equation have the same base, 2. Since the bases are equal and \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\), the exponents must be equal as well.\n\nTherefore, I can set \\(2x = 4\\) and solve for \\(x\\). Dividing both sides by 2, I find that \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Express 256 as a Power of 2**\n\nFirst, recognize that 256 is a power of 2:\n\\[\n256 = 2^8\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Right Side**\n\nApply the exponentiation rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\):\n\\[\n(2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n\\]\nNow, the equation is:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = 2^4\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Set the Exponents Equal**\n\nSince the bases on both sides are the same (\\(2\\)), set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[\n2x = 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\)**\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
