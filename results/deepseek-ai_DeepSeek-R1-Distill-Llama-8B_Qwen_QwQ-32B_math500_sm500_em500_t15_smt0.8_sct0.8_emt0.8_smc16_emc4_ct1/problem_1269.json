So, I can rewrite the right-hand side as \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the exponent of a power rule, which states that \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). This simplifies the right-hand side to \\(2^4\\).\n\nNow, the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other, resulting in \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, which gives me \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nSure, let's solve the equation step by step.\n\n**Given Equation:**\n\\[\n2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Express 256 as a Power of 2**\nWe know that \\(256\\) is a power of \\(2\\):\n\\[\n256 = 2^8\n\\]\nSo, substitute \\(256\\) with \\(2^8\\) in the equation:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Right Side**\nApply the exponent of a power rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\):\n\\[\n(2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n\\]\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = 2^4\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Set the Exponents Equal**\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n\\[\n2x = 4\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\)**\nDivide both sides by \\(2\\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\nx = \\boxed{2}\n\\]"
