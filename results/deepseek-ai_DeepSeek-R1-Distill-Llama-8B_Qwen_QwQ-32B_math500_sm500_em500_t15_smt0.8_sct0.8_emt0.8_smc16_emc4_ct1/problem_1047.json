The coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) are integers, and I need to find the number of different possible rational roots for this polynomial. Hmm, I remember there's something called the Rational Root Theorem that might help here. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nAlright, so the Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, when written in its lowest terms \\(P(x)/Q(x) = 0\\), is of the form a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient. So, in this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2.\n\nLet me write that down. The constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, the possible rational roots would be factors of 1 divided by factors of 2. The factors of 1 are just ±1, and the factors of 2 are ±1, ±2. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm applying the theorem correctly. The theorem says factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient, right? So, if the constant term is 1, its factors are 1 and -1. The leading coefficient is 2, so its factors are 1, 2, -1, -2. Therefore, all possible rational roots are the combination of these. That gives us 1/1, 1/2, -1/1, -1/2. So, simplifying, that's 1, 1/2, -1, and -1/2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots. So, let's count them: 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. That makes four possible rational roots.\n\nHold on, is that all? Let me think again. Maybe I should consider if the polynomial factors in such a way or if there are any multiplicities or something. But wait, the question is just asking for the number of different possible rational roots, regardless of whether they"

            "output": " actually are roots for some coefficients. Since the coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) can be any integers, the question is about all possible rational roots that could exist for any such polynomial. So, the possible candidates are those four, but maybe some of them can't actually be roots for any integer coefficients?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to check if each of these candidates can actually be a root for some choice of \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_1\\). Let me test each one.\n\nStarting with 1: Let's suppose 1 is a root. Then plugging into the polynomial: \\(2(1)^4 + a_3(1)^3 + a_2(1)^2 + a_1(1) + 1 = 0\\). That simplifies to 2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_1 + 1 = 0, so a_3 + a_2 + a_1 = -3. Since \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_1\\) are integers, this equation is possible. For example, set \\(a_3 = 0\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = -3\\). So yes, 1 can be a root.\n\nSimilarly, let's check -1: Plugging in -1: \\(2(-1)^4 + a_3(-1)^3 + a_2(-1)^2 + a_1(-1) + 1 = 0\\). That becomes 2 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 + 1 = 0. So, -a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = -3. Again, integers can satisfy this. For instance, set \\(a_3 = 0\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), \\(a_1 = 3\\). Then, -0 + 0 -3 = -3, so that works. So -1 is possible.\n\nNow, 1/2: Let's plug in 1/2. The polynomial becomes \\(2*(1/2)^4 + a_3*(1/2)^3 + a_2*(1/2)^2 + a_1*(1/2) + 1 = 0\\"

            "output": ").\n\nCalculating each term:\n- \\(2*(1/16) = 1/8\\)\n- \\(a_3*(1/8)\\)\n- \\(a_2*(1/4)\\)\n- \\(a_1*(1/2)\\)\n- 1\n\nSo, adding them up: 1/8 + \\(a_3/8 + a_2/4 + a_1/2\\) + 1 = 0.\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by 8 to eliminate denominators: 1 + \\(a_3 + 2a_2 + 4a_1\\) + 8 = 0.\n\nSimplify: \\(a_3 + 2a_2 + 4a_1 = -9\\). Is this possible? Well, since \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\) are integers, we can find integers that satisfy this equation. For example, set \\(a_3 = 0\\), then \\(2a_2 + 4a_1 = -9\\). Let me choose \\(a_2 = 1\\), then \\(4a_1 = -9 - 2*1 = -11\\), so \\(a_1 = -11/4\\), which is not integer. Hmm, maybe another choice. Let me try \\(a_3 = 1\\), then \\(1 + 2a_2 + 4a_1 = -9\\), so \\(2a_2 + 4a_1 = -10\\). Then, divide through by 2: \\(a_2 + 2a_1 = -5\\). Let me set \\(a_2 = 1\\), then \\(2a_1 = -6\\), so \\(a_1 = -3\\). So, \\(a_3 = 1\\), \\(a_2 = 1\\), \\(a_1 = -3\\). Plugging back into the equation: 1 + 2*1 + 4*(-3) = 1 + 2 -12 = -9, which works. So 1/2 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, let's check -1/2. Plugging in -1/2: the polynomial becomes \\(2*(-1/2)^4 + a_3*(-1/2)^3 + a_2"

Let's see if integers can satisfy this. Let me choose \\(a_3 = 1\\), then \\( -2a_2 + 4a_1 = 8\\). Let me set \\(a_2 = 0\\), then \\(4a_1 = 8\\), so \\(a_1 = 2\\). So with \\(a_3 =1\\), \\(a_2 =0\\), \\(a_1=2\\), the equation becomes \\(1 -0 +0=1\\). Wait, no: \\(a_3 -2a_2 +4a_1 =1 -0 +8=9\\), which works. So, -1/2 is also possible.\n\nTherefore, all four possible rational roots (1, -1, 1/2, -1/2) can be roots of the polynomial for some choice of \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), and \\(a_1\\). So, the number of different possible rational roots is four.\n\nWait, hold on a second. The question says \"different possible rational roots\". So, even though in some cases, multiple roots might coincide, but in this case, all four are distinct. So, the answer is four.\n\nBut let me just make sure there isn't a case where two of these are the same. For example, 1/2 is not equal to -1/2, nor is"
