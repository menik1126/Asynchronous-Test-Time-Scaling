I need to find the number of different possible rational roots this polynomial can have. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember something about the Rational Root Theorem. I think it helps determine the possible rational roots of a polynomial. Let me recall what the theorem says. From what I remember, the Rational Root Theorem states that any rational solution \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients must have a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nSo, in this polynomial, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2. That means the possible rational roots should be of the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of 1 and \\(q\\) is a factor of 2.\n\nFirst, let me list the factors of the constant term, which is 1. The factors of 1 are just \\(\\pm1\\). Now, the factors of the leading coefficient, which is 2, are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\).\n\nSo, the possible values for \\(p\\) are 1 and -1, and the possible values for \\(q\\) are 1, -1, 2, and -2. Now, taking each combination of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), the possible rational roots would be:\n\n1. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = 1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\)\n2. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = -1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{-1} = -1\\)\n3. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = 2\\): \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n4. \\(p = 1\\), \\(q = -2\\): \\(\\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n5. \\(p = -1\\), \\(q = 1\\): \\(\\frac{-1}{1} = -"

From the above, the possible rational roots are: 1, -1, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), -\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), \\(\\frac{-1}{2}\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Wait, but some of these are repeats.\n\nLooking specifically, 1 appears twice (from p=1, q=1 and p=-1, q=-1), and -1 appears twice (from p=1, q=-1 and p=-1, q=1). Similarly, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) appears twice (from p=1, q=2 and p=-1, q=-2), and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) appears twice (from p=1, q=-2 and p=-1, q=2). But since we're looking for different possible rational roots, we should only count each distinct value once.\n\nSo, the distinct possible rational roots are: 1, -1, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). That makes four different possible rational roots.\n\nLet me double-check if I considered all factors correctly. The constant term is 1, so the numerator p can only be 1 or -1. The leading coefficient is 2, so the denominator q can be 1, -1, 2, or -2. Multiplying all combinations, yes, that gives four unique possibilities for \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1\\) has integer coefficients. Using the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are of the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\("
