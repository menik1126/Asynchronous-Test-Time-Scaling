Let me try to break this down step by step because recursion can sometimes be tricky, especially with multiple layers. \n\nFirst, let me understand the function f(i, j). It's defined recursively, so I might need to compute some smaller values first before I can tackle f(2015, 2). The function has three cases:\n\n1. When i = 0 and j is between 0 and 4, f(0, j) is just mod_5(j + 1). That seems straightforward.\n2. If i is at least 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) is f(i - 1, 1). So, this case is like reducing the problem by one level when the second argument is 0.\n3. For i >= 1 and j between 1 and 4, f(i, j) is f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). This seems more complex because it's a nested recursion.\n\nSince I'm being asked for f(2015, 2), let's see how I can approach this without having to compute every single f(i, j) from 0 upwards, though that might be necessary if there's a pattern or a cycle.\n\nBefore diving into f(2015, 2), maybe I should compute f(i, j) for small values of i and j to see if there's a pattern or cycle that repeats, especially because the modulus is 5, so values wrap around every 5.\n\nLet me start by tabulating f(i, j) for i from 0 up to, say, 5, and j from 0 to 4. Maybe that will reveal a pattern or a cycle.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n- f(0, 0) = mod_5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0, 1) = mod_5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0, 2) = mod_5(2 + 1) = 3\n- f(0, 3) = mod_5(3 + 1) = 4\n- f(0, 4) = mod_5(4 + 1) = "

Therefore, for any i >=5, f(i, j) =1 for all j=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nThat's a crucial observation! So for i >=5, f(i,j)=1 regardless of j.\n\nSo, let's test i=5,6,7, etc., as above to confirm.\n\nBut wait, let me also check i=4, j=4: it was 3. So, i=4 is [3,1,3,1,3]. So, yes, when i=4, it's a cycle of 3,1,3,1,3.\n\nSimilarly, for i=3, it's [0,3,4,1,0], which is a cycle of 0,3,4,1,0.\n\nBut then at i=5, it's fixed at 1. So that's the key point. So for i >=5, the function is always 1, regardless of j.\n\nTherefore, to compute f(2015,2), since 2015 is much larger than 5, we can immediately say that f(2015,2)=1.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nSo, according to the pattern, for i=0: [1,2,3,4,0]\ni=1: [2,3,4,0,1]\ni=2: [3,0,2,4,1]\ni=3: [0,3,4,1,0]\ni=4: [3,1,3,1,3]\ni=5: [1,1,1,1,1]\ni=6: [1,1,1,1,1]\nAnd so on.\n\nSo indeed, once i reaches 5, it's always 1.\n\nThus, for any i >=5, f(i,j)=1 for all j.\n\nSo, f(2015,2)=1.\n\nWait"

So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1. But let me think again. Wait, the problem says \"for every positive integer n\", but the function is defined on {0,1,2,...} \u00d7 {0,1,2,3,4}. So the first argument starts at 0. So 2015 is a valid first argument.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for i=5? Let me recheck:\n\nFor i=5, j=0: f(5,0)=f(4,1). From i=4, j=1 is 1. So f(4,1)=1. So f(5,0)=1.\n\nThen f(5,1)=f(4, f(5,0)) = f(4,1)=1.\n\nSimilarly, f(5,2)=f(4, f(5,1))=f(4,1)=1, and so on. So yes, all are 1.\n\nTherefore, once i reaches 5, it's all 1s. So for any i >=5, f(i,j)=1. Therefore, f(2015,2)=1.\n\nWait, but let me check for i=5, j=4. f(5,4)=f(4, f(5,3)). Since f(5,3)=1, so f(4,1)=1. So yes, that's 1. So all entries are 1. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1. Hmm, but let me see if there's another way to think about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this function is related to the Ackermann function or some other recursive function that eventually stabilizes. Since the modulus is 5, and the recursion is such that each step reduces the first argument, but the second argument is being processed recursively. However, once it reaches i=5, it's stuck at 1. So, the conclusion is that for any i >=5, f"
