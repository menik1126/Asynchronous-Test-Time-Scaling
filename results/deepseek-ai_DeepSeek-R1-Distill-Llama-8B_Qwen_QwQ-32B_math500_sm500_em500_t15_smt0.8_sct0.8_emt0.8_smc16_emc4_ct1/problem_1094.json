Let me try to understand how this function works step by step.\n\nFirst, let me restate the definition to make sure I get it. The function f(i, j) is defined with three cases:\n\n1. If i = 0 and j is between 0 and 4 inclusive, then f(0, j) is just j + 1 mod 5. So, for example, f(0, 0) would be 1, f(0, 1)=2, up to f(0,4)=0.\n2. If i is at least 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) is equal to f(i - 1, 1). So, it's like we're moving to the previous i and the next j.\n3. If i is at least 1 and j is between 1 and 4, then f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). This seems more complex, as it's recursive.\n\nThe problem asks for f(2015, 2). So, starting from i=2015 and j=2, I need to compute this. Given that 2015 is a large number, doing this step by step directly isn't feasible. Instead, maybe there's a pattern or cycle that repeats, which we can exploit.\n\nLet me try to compute f(i, j) for small values of i and j to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nWe know the base case: f(0, j) = j + 1 mod 5 for j=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo,\n\nf(0,0) = 1\n\nf(0,1) = 2\n\nf(0,2) = 3\n\nf(0,3) = 4\n\nf(0,4) = 0\n\nNow, let's compute f(1, j) using the recursive definitions.\n\nStarting with j=0:\n\nf(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2\n\nFor j=1:\n\nf(1,1) = f(0, f(1,0)) = f(0, 2) = 3\n\nFor j=2:\n\nf"

So for i=5, regardless of j, f(5,j)=1.\n\nMoving on, let's compute f(6, j):\n\nf(6,0) = f(5,1)=1\n\nf(6,1) = f(5, f(6,0)) = f(5,1)=1\n\nSimilarly, all f(6,j) will be 1, because f(5, anything)=1, so f(6,0)=1, then each f(6,j)=f(5,1)=1.\n\nWait, this seems to be a pattern. Once i reaches 5, all f(5,j)=1, and then for i >=5, f(i,j)=1 for all j.\n\nSo, in general, for i >=5, f(i,j)=1 for any j.\n\nTherefore, f(2015,2)=1. Because 2015 is much larger than 5, so f(2015,2)=1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this with i=5,6, etc., to make sure I haven't missed something.\n\nFor i=5:\n\nf(5,0)=f(4,1)=1\n\nf(5,1)=f(4,1)=1\n\nf(5,2)=f(4,1)=1, and so on.\n\nYes, so all are 1s. For i=6, same logic applies because when you compute f(6,0)=f(5,1)=1, and then any f(6,j)=f(5, f(6,j-1))=f(5,1)=1. So, regardless of how far i goes beyond 5, it stays at 1.\n\nTherefore, f(2015,2)=1.\n</think>\n\nTo determine \\( f(2015, 2) \\), we analyze the behavior of the function \\( f(i, j) \\) for increasing values of \\( i \\). By computing the function for small values, we observe a pattern that stabilizes after \\( i = 5 \\). Specifically, for \\( i \\"
