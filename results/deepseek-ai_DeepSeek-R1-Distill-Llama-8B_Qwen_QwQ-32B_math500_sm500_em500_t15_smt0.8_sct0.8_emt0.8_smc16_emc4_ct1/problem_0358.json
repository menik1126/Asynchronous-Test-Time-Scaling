            "output": "First, I'll define the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let \\( B \\) represent the number of blue marbles and \\( Y \\) represent the number of yellow marbles.\n\nGiven that the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3, I can set up the proportion \\( \\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\), which means \\( B = \\frac{4}{3}Y \\).\n\nNext, after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3. This gives me the equation \\( \\frac{B + 5}{Y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3} \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( Y \\), I'll cross-multiply to get \\( 3(B + 5) = 7(Y - 3) \\), which simplifies to \\( 3B + 15 = 7Y - 21 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( B = \\frac{4}{3}Y \\) into the equation, I have \\( 3(\\frac{4}{3}Y) + 15 = 7Y - 21 \\), leading to \\( 4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21 \\).\n\nSolving for \\( Y \\), I get \\( 15 + 21 = 7Y - 4Y \\), which simplifies to \\( 36 = 3Y \\), so \\( Y = 12 \\).\n\nFinally, substituting \\( Y = 12 \\) back into \\( B = \\frac{4}{3}Y \\), I find that \\( B = 16 \\).
