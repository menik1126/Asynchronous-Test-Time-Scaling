            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find P(5) for a monic cubic polynomial P(x). Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says P(x) is monic and of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1. So I can write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\nWhere a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nNext, it's given that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Hmm, okay, so R(x) is the remainder when P(x) is divided by a quadratic polynomial. Since P(x) is cubic, the division will give a linear quotient and a quadratic remainder, but wait, the divisor is quadratic, so the remainder should be of lower degree than the divisor, which is quadratic. But wait, (x - 1)(x - 4) is quadratic, so R(x) must be a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) is linear.\n\nSimilarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), which is also quadratic, the remainder is 2R(x). So 2R(x) must be a linear polynomial as well.\n\nWait, so R(x) is linear, and 2R(x) is also linear. That makes sense.\n\nSince P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), we can express P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), we have:\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nWhere Q1(x) and Q2(x) are linear polynomials because when you divide a cubic by a quadratic, the quotient is linear.\n\nBut I don't know Q1 or Q2. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps I can use the Remainder Theorem here. Because when you divide by a quadratic, the remainder is linear, so at the roots of the divisor, the remainder can be evaluated"

Similarly, plugging in x = 2 and x = 3 into P(x), the terms with Q2(x) will vanish, so P(2) = 2R(2) and P(3) = 2R(3).\n\nSo that gives me four equations:\n\n1. P(1) = R(1)\n2. P(4) = R(4)\n3. P(2) = 2R(2)\n4. P(3) = 2R(3)\n\nSince R(x) is linear, let me denote R(x) = mx + n, where m and n are constants. Then 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n.\n\nSo substituting into the equations:\n\n1. P(1) = m(1) + n = m + n\n2. P(4) = m(4) + n = 4m + n\n3. P(2) = 2m(2) + 2n = 4m + 2n\n4. P(3) = 2m(3) + 2n = 6m + 2n\n\nBut also, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, I can compute P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) using its expression:\n\nP(x) = x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c\n\nTherefore:\n\nP(1) = 1 + a + b + c\n\nP(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + c\n\nP(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + c\n\nP(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + c\n\nSo substituting into the equations from the remainders:\n\n1. 1 + a + b + c = m + n\n\n2. 64 + 16a + 4b + c = 4m + n\n\n3. 8 + 4a + 2b + c = 4m + 2n\n\n4. 27 + 9a +"
