I'm a bit nervous because polynomial division can get tricky, but I'll take it one step at a time.\n\nFirst, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.\n\nWe have a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so the polynomial looks like \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \\) for some coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\).\n\nThe problem says that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\). When \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). Also, we're given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\), and we need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nHmm. So, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, since \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which is a quadratic polynomial, the remainder \\( R(x) \\) should be of a lower degree, so it's a linear polynomial. Similarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder \\( 2R(x) \\) is also linear.\n\nLet me denote \\( R(x) = mx + n \\) for some constants \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). Then \\( 2R(x) = 2mx + 2n \\).\n\nNow, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), we can write:\n\n\\( P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q_1(x) + R(x) \\)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\):\n\n\\( P(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q_2(x) + 2R(x) \\)\n\nHere, \\( Q_1(x) \\) and \\( Q_2(x) \\) are the quotient polynomials.

Maybe there's another approach.\n\nI remember the Remainder Theorem, which says that if a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - a) \\), the remainder is \\( P(a) \\). But in this case, the divisors are quadratic, so perhaps I can use the generalization of the Remainder Theorem.\n\nIn general, if we divide by a polynomial \\( D(x) \\) of degree \\( d \\), the remainder will be of degree less than \\( d \\). So, for \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), which is quadratic, the remainder is linear, which is consistent with \\( R(x) \\) being linear.\n\nMoreover, I recall that if \\( D(x) = (x - a)(x - b) \\), then \\( P(x) \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\( P(x) = D(x)Q(x) + (cx + d) \\)\n\nAnd evaluating \\( P \\) at \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) gives:\n\n\\( P(a) = cx + d \\) evaluated at \\( x = a \\) → \\( c a + d \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( P(b) = c b + d \\)\n\nSo, if \\( R(x) = cx + d \\), then \\( c = m \\) and \\( d = n \\), so \\( R(1) = m(1) + n = c(1) + d \\)\n\nWait, perhaps more precise. Let me note that:\n\nWhen \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder \\( R(x) \\) can be found by evaluating \\( P(1) \\) and \\( P(4) \\). Specifically, \\( R(1) = P(1) \\) and \\( R(4) = P(4) \\). Since \\( R(x) \\) is linear, knowing two points should allow me to determine \\( R(x) \\).\n\nSimilarly, when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\),"

Correct.\n\nAll remainders check out, so the values of m, n, a, b, c are correct, leading to P(5)=15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{15}\n</think>\n\nGiven a monic polynomial \\( P(x) \\) of degree 3, we know that when \\( P(x) \\) is divided by \\( (x - 1)(x - 4) \\), the remainder is \\( R(x) \\), and when divided by \\( (x - 2)(x - 3) \\), the remainder is \\( 2R(x) \\). We are also given that \\( P(0) = 5 \\) and need to find \\( P(5) \\).\n\nFirst, we express \\( R(x) \\) as a linear polynomial \\( R(x) = mx + n \\). Using the given conditions, we set up the following equations based on the remainders and the polynomial evaluations:\n\n1. \\( R(1) = P(1) \\)\n2. \\( R(4) = P(4) \\)\n3. \\( 2R(2) = P(2) \\)\n4. \\( 2R(3) = P(3) \\)\n\nGiven \\( P(0) = 5 \\), we know the constant term of \\( P(x) \\) is 5. Thus, \\( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 5 \\).\n\nWe evaluate \\( P(x) \\) at the points 1, 2, 3, and 4:\n\n- \\( P(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 \\)\n- \\( P(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 \\)\n- \\( P(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 \\)\n- \\( P(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 \\)\n\nUsing the remainders, we set up the following equations:\n\n1. \\( m +"
