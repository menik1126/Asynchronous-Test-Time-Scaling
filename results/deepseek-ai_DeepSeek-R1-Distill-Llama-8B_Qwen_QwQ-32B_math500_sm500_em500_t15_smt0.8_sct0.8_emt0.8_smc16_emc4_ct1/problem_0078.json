I need to find the maximum value of the greatest common divisor of these two expressions. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find a number \\( d \\) such that \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). And I need to find the largest possible \\( d \\).\n\nI also recall that one useful method for finding the gcd of two numbers is the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me try to set it up.\n\nLet me denote \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). Then, I need to compute \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\). According to the Euclidean algorithm, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a) \\) if \\( a > b \\), but I can also express it in terms of their linear combinations.\n\nWait, actually, the Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then taking the remainder and repeating the process. Maybe I can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\).\n\nLet me see: \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). Since \\( a = n + 7 \\), I can solve for \\( n \\) in terms of \\( a \\). From \\( a = n + 7 \\), subtracting 7 gives \\( n = a - 7 \\).\n\nSubstituting that into \\( b \\), we get \\( b = 2(a - 7) + 1 = 2a - 14 + 1 = 2a - 13 \\). So, \\( b = 2a - 13 \\).\n\nNow, I can write \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, 2a - 13) \\). Using the Euclidean algorithm, this is the same as \\( \\gcd(a, 2a - 13 - 2 \\times a) \\), which simplifies to \\( \\gcd(a, -13) \\). But"

            "output": " since the gcd is always non-negative, it's the same as \\( \\gcd(a, 13) \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(a, 13) \\), where \\( a = n + 7 \\). Therefore, the gcd is equal to the divisor of 13 that divides \\( a \\). Since 13 is a prime number, the possible divisors are 1 and 13.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd is 13, provided that 13 divides \\( a = n + 7 \\). So, we need \\( n + 7 \\) to be a multiple of 13. That is, \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\), which implies \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\). Since we're dealing with positive integers, \\( n \\) must be congruent to 6 modulo 13 (because \\( -7 \\) is congruent to 6 modulo 13). So, \\( n = 13k + 6 \\) for some integer \\( k \\geq 0 \\).\n\nLet me test this with an example to make sure. Let's choose \\( k = 0 \\), so \\( n = 6 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 13 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 13 \\). The gcd of 13 and 13 is 13, which is good. Now, another example: \\( k = 1 \\), so \\( n = 19 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 26 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 39 \\). The gcd of 26 and 39 is 13, which is the same as before.\n\nWait, another way to think about this: since the gcd is 13, then both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) must be divisible by 13. So, \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\). Let me check if these two congruences are consistent.\n\nFrom \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\), we have \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\), which is \\( n \\equiv 6"

Therefore, the value 13 is achievable, so 13 is indeed the greatest possible gcd.\n\nIs there a possibility of a higher gcd? Since we proved that \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\), and 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13. So, 13 is the maximum.\n\nWait, another thought: let me try \\( k = 2 \\), so \\( n = 6 + 13 \\times 2 = 26 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 33 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 53 \\). The gcd of 33 and 53 is 1, since 53 is prime and doesn't divide 33. Hmm, so in this case, the gcd drops back down to 1. So, it seems that when \\( k \\) increases by 1, sometimes the gcd remains 13, sometimes it goes back to 1? Wait, why does that happen?\n\nWait, no, let's compute \\( n = 26 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 33 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 53 \\). 33 is 3 \u00d7 11, and 53 is prime, so their gcd is indeed 1. But when \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = 19 \\), \\( n + 7 = 26 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 = 39 \\), which is 13 \u00d7 3, so gcd(26, 39) is 13. Similarly, if I take \\( k = 3 \\), \\( n = 6 + 13 \\times 3 = 45 \\). Then, \\( n + 7 = 52 \\), \\( 2n + 1 = 91 \\). The gcd of 52 and 91 is 13, since 52 is 13 \u00d7 4 and 91 is 13 \u00d7 7. So, it's 13 again.\n\nWait, so every time \\( n \\) is congruent to 6 modulo 13,"

So, the answer should be 13.\n\nBut let me check another case where maybe the gcd could be higher. Suppose there is a divisor greater than 13. Since 13 is prime, the only way for the gcd to be higher is if it's a multiple of 13, but since 13 is prime, the gcd can only be 1 or 13. Therefore, 13 is the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to approach this problem using another method to confirm.\n\nSuppose \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). Then, \\( d \\) divides any linear combination of these two numbers. For instance, \\( d \\) divides \\( 2(n + 7) - (2n + 1) \\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\( 2(n + 7) - (2n + 1) = 2n + 14 - 2n -1 = 13 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( d \\) divides 13. Since 13 is prime, the possible divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the greatest possible gcd is 13. So, this confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the maximum gcd is 13, and it's achievable when \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\), as we saw in the examples. So, the answer is 13.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just check with another example where n is 6, which gives gcd(13,13)=13, and n=19 gives gcd(26,39)=13, and n=45 gives gcd(52,91)=13. So, that's consistent. So, yeah, 13 is the maximum possible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{13}\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) for a positive integer \\(n\\), we start by denoting \\(a = n + 7\\) and \\(b = 2n + 1\\). We need to compute \\(\\gcd(a, b)\\).\n\n"
