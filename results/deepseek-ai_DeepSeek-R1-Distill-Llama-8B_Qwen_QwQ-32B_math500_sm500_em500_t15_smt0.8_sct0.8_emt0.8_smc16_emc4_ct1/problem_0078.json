            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers: n + 7 and 2n + 1, where n is a positive integer. Hmm, gcd problems often involve using the Euclidean algorithm or some properties of numbers. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference. So maybe I can subtract some multiple of one number from the other to simplify. Let me write down the two expressions:\n\ngcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\n\nI can express 2n + 1 in terms of n + 7. Let me see:\n\n2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13\n\nLet me check that:\n\n2(n + 7) = 2n + 14\n\nSubtracting 13 gives 2n + 14 - 13 = 2n + 1. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, substituting back, we have:\n\ngcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1 - 2(n + 7))\n\nBut wait, I think I can express this as:\n\ngcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7))\n\nCalculating the second part:\n\n(2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13\n\nSo, the gcd simplifies to:\n\ngcd(n + 7, -13)\n\nBut since gcd is always a positive number, it's the same as gcd(n + 7, 13)\n\nAlright, so the gcd of n + 7 and 13. Now, 13 is a prime number, so the possible divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the greatest possible gcd would be 13. But for that to happen, n + 7 must be a multiple of 13.\n\nSo, let me set up the equation:\n\nn + 7 ≡ 0 mod 13\n\nWhich means n ≡ -7 mod 13. Since -7 mod 13 is the same as 6 (because 13 - 7 = 6), so n ≡ 6"

So gcd(13,13) = 13. That's correct.\n\nAnother example, n = 19 (since 13*1 + 6 = 19):\n\nn + 7 = 26, and 2n + 1 = 39.\n\ngcd(26, 39). Let's compute that:\n\n39 ÷ 26 = 1 with remainder 13\n\n26 ÷ 13 = 2 with remainder 0\n\nSo, gcd is 13. That's correct.\n\nWait, but if n = 6, then 2n + 1 is 13, which is the same as n + 7. So their gcd is 13. That makes sense.\n\nWhat if n is 6 + 13 = 19? Then n + 7 is 26, and 2n + 1 is 39. Gcd(26, 39) is 13, as I saw before.\n\nSimilarly, n = 6 + 2*13 = 32: n + 7 = 39, 2n +1 = 65.\n\ngcd(39, 65). Let's see:\n\n65 ÷ 39 = 1 with remainder 26\n\n39 ÷ 26 = 1 with remainder 13\n\n26 ÷ 13 = 2 with remainder 0. So, gcd is 13 again.\n\nOkay, so it seems that whenever n is congruent to 6 mod 13, the gcd is 13. So the maximum possible value of the gcd is 13.\n\nWait, but can the gcd be higher? 13 is a prime, so the next possible higher gcd would have to be 26, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nSuppose gcd(n + 7, 2n +1) = 26. Then 26 would divide both n + 7 and 2n + 1.\n\nBut 26 divides n +7, so n ≡ -7 mod 26.\n\nThen, 2n +1 ≡ 2*(-7) + 1 �"

But since 26 divides n +7, then n is congruent to -7 mod 26, so n = 26k -7.\n\nPlugging into 2n +1: 2*(26k -7) +1 = 52k -14 +1 = 52k -13 = 13*(4k -1). So 13 divides it, but 26 divides it only if 4k -1 is even. 4k is even, so 4k -1 is odd. Therefore, 4k -1 is odd, so 13*(odd) is not divisible by 26. Therefore, 26 cannot divide 2n +1. Therefore, gcd cannot be 26. So the maximum possible is 13.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value is 13.\n\nWait, but let me check another case where maybe the gcd is higher. Let me see if there's a case where the gcd is higher than 13. Let me try n = 6, which gives gcd 13. What if n = 6 -13 = -7? But n has to be a positive integer, so that's invalid. The next one is n=6, 19, 32, etc. All give gcd 13. So I think 13 is the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose d divides both n +7 and 2n +1. Then d divides (2n +1) - 2*(n +7) = 2n +1 -2n -14 = -13. So d divides 13. Since 13 is prime, the possible divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the gcd can only be 1 or 13. Therefore, the maximum possible is 13. So that's the answer.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value is 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible value"
