The possible values for \\( G \\) are 13, 26, and 39. However, since the total number of students is 35, \\( G \\) can't be 39. This leaves \\( G \\) as either 13 or 26.\n\nIf \\( G = 13 \\), then substituting into the total students equation gives \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\).\n\nIf \\( G = 26 \\), then \\( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\).\n\nHowever, the problem states there are more girls than boys. This means \\( G > B \\). Comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- When \\( G = 13 \\) and \\( B = 22 \\), \\( G \\) is not greater than \\( B \\).\n- When \\( G = 26 \\) and \\( B = 9 \\), \\( G \\) is greater than \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let \\( G \\) represent the number of girls attending the meeting.\n- Let \\( B \\) represent the number of boys attending the meeting.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**\n- The total number of students is 35.\n- Therefore, \\( G + B = 35 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Given Conditions**\n- The number of girls is a multiple of 13.\n  - Possible values for \\( G \\): 13, 26, 39, ...\n  - However, since \\( G + B = 35 \\), \\( G \\) cannot exceed 35. Thus, \\( G \\) can be 13 or 26.\n- There are more girls than boys:\n  - \\( G > B \\).\n\n**Step 4: Find Possible Values for \\( G \\) and \\( B \\)**\n1. If \\( G = 13 \\):\n   - \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\)\n"
