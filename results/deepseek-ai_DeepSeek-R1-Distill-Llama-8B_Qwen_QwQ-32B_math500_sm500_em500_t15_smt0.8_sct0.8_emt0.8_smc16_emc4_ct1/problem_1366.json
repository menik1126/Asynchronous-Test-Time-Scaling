Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys and \\( g \\) represent the number of girls attending the math club meeting.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that the total number of students is 35, so we can write the equation:\n\\( b + g = 35 \\)\n\nNext, the problem states that the number of girls is a multiple of 13. Therefore, \\( g \\) can be 13, 26, or 39. However, since the total number of students is 35, \\( g \\) can't be 39 because that would exceed the total number of students. So the possible values for \\( g \\) are 13 or 26.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that there are more girls than boys. This means that \\( g > b \\).\n\nStarting with \\( g = 13 \\):\n- If \\( g = 13 \\), then substituting into the total equation:\n  \\( b + 13 = 35 \\) which gives \\( b = 22 \\).\n- Checking the condition \\( g > b \\), we have \\( 13 > 22 \\), which is false.\n\nNext, let's try \\( g = 26 \\):\n- If \\( g = 26 \\), substituting into the total equation:\n  \\( b + 26 = 35 \\) which gives \\( b = 9 \\).\n- Checking the condition \\( g > b \\), we have \\( 26 > 9 \\), which is true.\n\nFinally, \\( g = 39 \\) is not possible because it exceeds the total number of students.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\( g = 26 \\) and \\( b = 9 \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is more than the number of boys.\n\n**Step 1:** Express the total number of students as the sum of boys and girls.\n\\[ b + g = 35 \\]\nwhere \\( b \\) is the number of boys.\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the possible values for \\( g \\).\nSince \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13 and less than or equal to 35, the possible values are:\n\\[ g = 13 \\times 1 = 13 \\]\n\\["
