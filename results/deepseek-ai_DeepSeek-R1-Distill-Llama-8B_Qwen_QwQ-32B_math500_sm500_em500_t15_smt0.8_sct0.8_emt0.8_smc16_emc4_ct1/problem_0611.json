Dividing by 2 gives 98.\n\nNext, I factor 98, which is also even, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing by 2 yields 49.\n\nNow, I check if 49 is a prime number. Since 49 is 7 multiplied by 7, its prime factorization is 7 squared.\n\nTo find the total number of divisors, I add one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and multiply those results. This means I add 1 to each exponent (2 and 2) and then multiply the sum, which is (1+2)*(1+2) = 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of **196**, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 196\nA divisor is a number that divides another number without leaving a remainder. To find all the divisors of **196**, we first need to express it as a product of prime numbers.\n\n1. **196 ÷ 2 = 98**  \n   - 2 is a prime number.\n   - Now, we have: \\( 196 = 2 \\times 98 \\)\n\n2. **98 ÷ 2 = 49**  \n   - 2 is also a prime number.\n   - Now, we have: \\( 196 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 49 \\)\n\n3. **49 ÷ 7 = 7**  \n   - 7 is a prime number.\n   - Now, we have: \\( 196 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\)\n\n4. **7 ÷ 7 = 1**  \n   - 7 is a prime number.\n   - **Prime Factorization Complete**: \\( 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\)\n\n### Step 2: Use the Formula for the Number of Divisors\nIf a number \\( N \\) is expressed as a product of prime factors of the form \\( N = p_1^{a_1} \\times p_2^{a_2} \\times \\"
