Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. Since 98 is also even, I can divide it by 2 again to get 49.\n\nNext, I check if 49 is divisible by 2. It's not, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. However, 49 divided by 3 is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor.\n\nThen, I try dividing 49 by 5, but it doesn't divide evenly either. The next prime number is 7. Dividing 49 by 7 gives me 7, which is a whole number, so 7 is a factor.\n\nNow, I recognize that 7 is a prime number, and 49 divided by 7 equals 7. This means that 7 is a repeated prime factor in 49. Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nTo find the number of positive divisors, I add 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply them together. So, for \\(2^2\\), I add 1 to get 3, and for \\(7^2\\), I also add 1 to get 3. Multiplying these together, \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 196\n\n1. **Start with 2**:\n   - 196 ÷ 2 = 98\n   - 98 ÷ 2 = 49\n\n   So, 196 = 2 × 2 × 49.\n\n2. **Factor 49**:\n   - 49 ÷ 7 = 7\n   - 7 ÷ 7 = 1\n\n   So, 49 = 7 × 7.\n\n3. **Combine the factors**:\n   - 196 = 2 × 2 × 7 × 7\n\n   In exponent form with the same base: \\(2^2 × 7^"
