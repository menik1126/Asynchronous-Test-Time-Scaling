            "output": "First, I'll assign variables to represent each item's weight. Let's denote the weight of a treek as T, a squig as S, and a goolee as G.\n\nFrom the first statement, I know that ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives me the equation 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says that two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This translates to the equation 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I'll use the second equation to express G in terms of T. Subtracting 2T from both sides gives G = S - 2T.\n\nNext, I'll substitute this expression for G into the first equation. Replacing G with S - 2T, the equation becomes 10T = 3S + (S - 2T), which simplifies to 10T = 4S - 2T.\n\nTo solve for T, I'll add 2T to both sides of the equation, resulting in 12T = 4S. Dividing both sides by 4 gives T = S.\n\nFinally, since one treek equals the weight of one squig, the combined weight of ten treeks equals the weight of one squig.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**\n- Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n- Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n- The combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let **\\( T \\)** represent the weight of one treek.\n   - Let **\\( S \\)** represent the weight of one squig.\n   - Let **\\( G \\)** represent the weight of one goolee.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Problem:**\n\n   - **First Statement:**\n     \\[\n     10T = 3S + G\n     \\]\n   \n   - **Second Statement:**\n     \\[\n     2T + G = S\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Second Equation for \\( G \\):**\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\\\\n   G = S - 2T\n   \\]\n\n4."
