            "output": "First, I need to assign variables to each item based on their weights relative to each other.\n\nLet’s denote the weight of a treek as T, a squig as S, and a goolee as G.\n\nFrom the first statement, ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives the equation: 10T = 3S + G.\n\nThe second statement says two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This translates to: 2T + G = S.\n\nNow, I can substitute the value of S from the second equation into the first one. So, replacing S with (2T + G), the first equation becomes: 10T = 3(2T + G) + G.\n\nExpanding the right side: 10T = 6T + 3G + G, which simplifies to 10T = 6T + 4G.\n\nSubtracting 6T from both sides gives: 4T = 4G. Dividing both sides by 4 results in T = G.\n\nSince T equals G, I can substitute T for G in the second equation. So, 2T + T = S, which simplifies to 3T = S.\n\nTherefore, the weight of one squig is three times the weight of a treek. This means three treeks weigh the same as one squig.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let \\( T \\) represent the weight of one treek.\n- Let \\( S \\) represent the weight of one squig.\n- Let \\( G \\) represent the weight of one goolee.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Given Information into Equations**\n1. **First Statement:**\n   - Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n2. **Second Statement:**\n   - Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.\n   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1**\nFrom Equation 2, we can"
