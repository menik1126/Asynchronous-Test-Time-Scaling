            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where the area of triangle ABC is given by the formula a² - (b - c)², and I need to find tan A. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using several formulas. The most common one is (1/2)*base*height, but another formula I recall is using two sides and the sine of the included angle. Yeah, that's right: Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So maybe I can use that here.\n\nGiven that the area is a² - (b - c)², let me write that down:\n\nArea = a² - (b - c)²\n\nBut I also know from the formula I mentioned earlier that the area should be (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So I can set those equal to each other:\n\na² - (b - c)² = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nNow, I need to solve for tan A, which is sin A over cos A. Maybe I can express sin A from this equation and then find cos A to get tan A.\n\nFirst, let me expand the left-hand side:\n\na² - (b - c)² = a² - (b² - 2bc + c²) = a² - b² + 2bc - c²\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\na² - b² + 2bc - c² = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. I remember that in a triangle, the Law of Cosines relates the sides with the cosine of an angle. The Law of Cosines states that:\n\na² = b² + c² - 2bc*cos A\n\nSo maybe I can solve for cos A from here, which will help me later when dealing with tan A.\n\nLet me rearrange that equation:\n\ncos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)\n\nOkay, so now I have expressions for both sin A and cos A in terms of the sides. Let me see if I can plug these into the area equation.\n\nWe have:\n\na² - b² + 2bc - c² = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nBut from the Law of Cosines, a² = b² + c"

So let me substitute that into the left-hand side:\n\n(b² + c² - 2bc*cos A) - b² + 2bc - c² = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\nb² + c² - 2bc*cos A - b² + 2bc - c² = (-2bc*cos A) + 2bc\n\nSo that becomes:\n\n-2bc*cos A + 2bc = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nFactor out 2bc on the left:\n\n2bc*(-cos A + 1) = (1/2)*b*c*sin A\n\nHmm, I can divide both sides by bc since b and c are sides of a triangle and can't be zero.\n\nSo:\n\n2*(-cos A + 1) = (1/2)*sin A\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n2*(1 - cos A) = (1/2)*sin A\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction on the right:\n\n4*(1 - cos A) = sin A\n\nSo now we have:\n\n4 - 4cos A = sin A\n\nHmm, now I have an equation involving sin A and cos A. I can try to express this in terms of tan A by dividing both sides by cos A.\n\nBut before that, maybe I can square both sides to utilize the Pythagorean identity.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n(4 - 4cos A)² = sin² A\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n16 - 32cos A + 16cos² A = sin² A\n\nNow, recall that sin² A = 1 - cos² A\n\nSubstitute that in:\n\n16 - 32cos A + 16cos² A = 1 - cos² A\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n16 - 32cos A + 16cos² A - 1 + cos² A = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n15 - 32cos A + 17cos² A = 0\n\nSo that's a quadratic in terms of cos A. Let's write it as:\n\n17cos² A - 32cos A + 15 = 0\n\nLet me denote x = cos A for simplicity:\n\n17x² - 32x + 15 = 0\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation.\n\nUsing the quadratic"

So we discard that.\n\nThus, cos A = 15/17\n\nSo now, we need tan A, which is sin A / cos A.\n\nFrom earlier, we have 4 - 4cos A = sin A\n\nSo let's plug in cos A = 15/17:\n\nsin A = 4 - 4*(15/17) = 4 - 60/17\n\nCompute 4 as 68/17:\n\n68/17 - 60/17 = 8/17\n\nSo sin A = 8/17\n\nThus, tan A = sin A / cos A = (8/17)/(15/17) = 8/15\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nEarlier, I had the equation 4 - 4cos A = sin A, and cos A = 15/17, so 4 - 4*(15/17) = 4 - 60/17 = (68 - 60)/17 = 8/17, which is sin A. Then tan A is 8/15, yes.\n\nAlternatively, from the quadratic equation, we had two solutions for cos A: 1 and 15/17. We dismissed 1, so cos A is 15/17 and sin A is 8/17, so tan A is 8/15.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me go back through the steps.\n\nWe started with the area given by a² - (b - c)², which expanded to a² - b² + 2bc - c². Then we set that"
