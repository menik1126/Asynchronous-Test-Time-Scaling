            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here about a triangle ABC where the area is given by \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). I need to find \\( \\tan A \\). Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be expressed in several ways. One common formula is \\( \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are two sides, and \\( C \\) is the included angle between them. But in this case, the area is given in terms of all three sides: \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). So, maybe I need another formula.\n\nAnother formula I recall is Heron's formula, which uses the semi-perimeter \\( s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\) and gives the area as \\( \\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \\). But I'm not sure if that's the way to go here since it might complicate things with square roots. Let me see if there's another approach.\n\nWait, the area is given as \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). Let me expand that expression to see if it can be rewritten in a more familiar form. \n\nSo, expanding \\( (b - c)^2 \\) gives \\( b^2 - 2bc + c^2 \\). Therefore, the area becomes:\n\\[\na^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\nSimplify that:\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc\n\\]\nHmm, that's interesting. It doesn't look like a standard area formula I know. Maybe I can relate this to the Law of Cosines?\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that \\( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A \\). Let me write that down:\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A\n\\]\nIf I substitute this into the area expression, maybe things will cancel out or become manageable. Let's try that.\n\nFrom the area:\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 - c^2"

So, we have two expressions for the area:\n1. \\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A \\)\n\nLet me set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n2bc(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A\n\\]\nFirst, I can divide both sides by \\( bc \\) to simplify, assuming \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are non-zero (which they must be since they are sides of a triangle):\n\\[\n2(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin A\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[\n4(1 - \\cos A) = \\sin A\n\\]\nSo, now we have:\n\\[\n4 - 4\\cos A = \\sin A\n\\]\nHmm, I have an equation involving \\( \\sin A \\) and \\( \\cos A \\). Maybe I can express this in terms of a single trigonometric function or use a substitution.\n\nLet me recall that \\( \\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1 \\).

So, substituting into the equation:\n\n\\( 4 - 4x = \\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\)\n\nWait, but this will have a square root, which might complicate things a bit. Alternatively, I could square both sides to eliminate the square root, but I have to be cautious because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nLet me try squaring both sides:\n\n\\( (4 - 4x)^2 = ( \\sqrt{1 - x^2} )^2 \\)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\( 16 - 32x + 16x^2 = 1 - x^2 \\)\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( 16 - 32x + 16x^2 - 1 + x^2 = 0 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( (16x^2 + x^2) + (-32x) + (16 - 1) = 0 \\)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n\\( 17x^2 - 32x + 15 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, we have a quadratic in terms of \\( x = \\cos A \\).

So, \\( \\sin A = 0 \\). But in a triangle, angle \\( A \\) has to be between 0 and 180 degrees, so \\( \\sin A \\) can't be zero unless \\( A \\) is 0 or 180, which isn't possible. Therefore, \\( x = 1 \\) is an extraneous solution. We discard it.\n\nNext, \\( x = \\frac{15}{17} \\). Plugging into the original equation:\nLeft-hand side: \\( 4 - 4 \\times \\frac{15}{17} = 4 - \\frac{60}{17} = \\frac{68}{17} - \\frac{60}{17} = \\frac{8}{17} \\)\n\nRight-hand side: \\( \\sin A \\). Since \\( x = \\cos A = \\frac{15}{17} \\), then \\( \\sin A = \\sqrt{1 - (\\frac{15}{17})^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{289 - 225}{289}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{289}} = \\frac{8}{17} \\)\n\nSo, LHS = RHS = \\( \\frac{8}{17} \\). This works, so \\( x = \\frac{15}{17} \\) is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, \\( \\cos A = \\frac{15}{17} \\). Now, the question asks for \\( \\tan A \\).
