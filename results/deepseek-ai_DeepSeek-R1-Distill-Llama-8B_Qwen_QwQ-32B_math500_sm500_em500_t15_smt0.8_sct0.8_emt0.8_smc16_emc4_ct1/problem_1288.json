            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the value of this expression: (16 * cube root of a squared) raised to the power of 1/3, and I know that a is 8. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down what each part of the expression is. The expression is (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3). So, let me start by figuring out what a squared is. Since a is 8, a squared would be 8 times 8, which is 64. So, ∛(a²) is the cube root of 64.\n\nNow, what's the cube root of 64? I remember that the cube of 4 is 64 because 4 * 4 * 4 = 64. So, ∛64 is 4. That simplifies the expression inside the parentheses to 16 * 4.\n\nNext, I need to multiply 16 and 4. 16 times 4 is... let's see, 10*4 is 40 and 6*4 is 24, so 40 + 24 is 64. So, the expression becomes (64)^(1/3).\n\nWait, so now I have 64 raised to the power of 1/3. I know that raising a number to the 1/3 power is the same as taking its cube root. So, 64^(1/3) is the cube root of 64, which we already determined is 4. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies down to 4.\n\nHmm, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with a=8, I squared it to get 64. Then I took the cube root of 64, which is 4. Then I multiplied that by 16, which gives 64. Finally, raising 64 to the 1/3 power gives me 4 again. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait a second, maybe I can approach this another way to confirm. Let's consider the entire expression: (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3). Since a=8, maybe I can express everything in terms of exponents with base 2, since 8 is 2³.\n\nSo, a = 8 = 2³. Therefore, a squared is (2³)"

            "output": "² = 2^(6). The cube root of a² would be ∛(2^6) = 2^(6/3) = 2² = 4. That matches what I had before. Then, 16 is 2^4. So, 16 * 4 is 2^4 * 2^2 = 2^(4+2) = 2^6. Then, raising that to the 1/3 power: (2^6)^(1/3) = 2^(6*(1/3)) = 2^2 = 4. Yep, same result. So that's good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can combine all the exponents first before plugging in the value of a. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is (16 * ∛(a²))^(1/3). Let's rewrite each part with exponents. 16 is 2^4. The cube root of a squared is a^(2/3). So, the expression inside the parentheses is 2^4 * a^(2/3). Then, raising that to the 1/3 power gives (2^4)^(1/3) * (a^(2/3))^(1/3). \n\nSimplifying exponents: 2^(4/3) * a^(2/9). Wait, hold on, that seems different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, when you have (2^4 * a^(2/3))^(1/3), you can distribute the exponent 1/3 over the product, so it becomes (2^4)^(1/3) * (a^(2/3))^(1/3). \n\nCalculating each part: (2^4)^(1/3) is 2^(4/3). Then, (a^(2/3))^(1/3) is a^(2/3 * 1/3) = a^(2/9). Hmm, so combining those, the expression is 2^(4/3) * a^(2/9). \n\nBut if I substitute a = 8 here, which is 2^3, then a^(2/9) is (2^3)^(2/9) = 2^(6/9) = 2"

            "turn": 1,

            "output": "^(2/3). So, then the expression becomes 2^(4/3) * 2^(2/3) = 2^(4/3 + 2/3) = 2^(6/3) = 2^2 = 4. So, again, the same answer, 4.\n\nWait, so that's another way to do it, by breaking down the exponents first and then combining. But regardless of the method, I still end up with 4. So that's reassuring that the answer is correct.\n\nI guess that's it then. The value of the expression is 4.\n</think>\n\nFirst, substitute \\( a = 8 \\) into the expression.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{a^2} = \\sqrt[3]{8^2} = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\n\\]\n\nThen, multiply by 16:\n\n\\[\n16 \\times 4 = 64\n\\]\n\nFinally, take the cube root of 64:\n\n\\[\n64^{1/3} = 4\n\\]\n\nThe value is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."
