They mentioned that the smallest distance can be expressed as \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive integers, and \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then I have to find \\( a + b \\). Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. If I have a point \\( (x, y) \\), the distance \\( D \\) from the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) is given by:\n\\[ D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\]\nSince we're dealing with the graph of \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), I can substitute \\( y \\) in the distance formula with that expression. So substituting, I get:\n\\[ D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\]\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it step by step.\n\nLet me square both sides to make it easier to handle. Since the square of the distance is just the square of the distance, I can work with \\( D^2 \\) instead:\n\\[ D^2 = x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2 \\]\nNow, let's compute that second term. Squaring \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\) gives me:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 \\times (x^2 - 3)^2 \\]\nSince \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \\]\nSo, plugging that back"

That would be:\n\\[ (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \\]\nSo substituting back in, I get:\n\\[ D^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \\]\nLet me distribute the \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) across the terms inside the parentheses:\n\\[ D^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \\frac{9}{2} \\]\nNow, let's combine like terms.

To find the minimum distance, I know that the minimal distance occurs where the derivative of \\( D^2 \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is zero. That makes sense because the minimal distance squared will have a critical point there, which should be a minimum.\n\nSo let me compute the derivative of \\( D^2 \\).

I should check the second derivative or evaluate the function \\( f(x) = D^2 \\) at these points to see which one is the minimum.\n\nLet me compute the second derivative \\( f''(x) \\) to test the concavity at these points. \n\nFirst, from the first derivative \\( f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \\), the second derivative is:\n\\[ f''(x) = 6x^2 - 4 \\]\n\nLet's evaluate \\( f''(x) \\) at each critical point:\n\n1. At \\( x = 0 \\):\n\\[ f''(0) = 6(0)^2 - 4 = -4 \\]\nSince this is negative, the function is concave down at \\( x = 0 \\), which means it's a local maximum. So, the distance squared is maximized here, which we don't want.\n\n2. At \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\):\nFirst, \\( x = \\sqrt{2} \\), so \\( x^2 = 2 \\).\nThus, \\( f''(\\sqrt{2}) = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \\)\nPositive, so the function is concave up here, meaning it's a local minimum.
