            "output": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of y equals (1 divided by the square root of 2) times (x squared minus 3). Then, express that distance as sqrt(a) over b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is square-free. Finally, find a plus b.\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the problem. The graph is a function y in terms of x, which is a parabola. The origin is (0, 0). I need to find the point on this parabola that's closest to the origin. The distance from the origin to any point (x, y) on the graph can be represented by the distance formula, which is sqrt(x squared plus y squared). But since the square root can complicate things, it's often easier to minimize the square of the distance instead. So, maybe I can set up a function for the squared distance and then find its minimum.\n\nAlright, let's write that down.\n\nGiven y = (1/√2)(x² - 3). So first, I can square both sides to get y squared, which would be [ (1/√2)(x² - 3) ] squared. That would be (1/2)(x² - 3)². So, the squared distance from the origin to any point (x, y) on the graph is x squared plus y squared, which is x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nSo, the function I need to minimize is f(x) = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nTo find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. Then, plug that x value back into f(x) to find the minimum squared distance, and take the square root at the end to get the actual distance.\n\nLet me compute f(x):\n\nf(x) = x² + (1/2)(x² - 3)².\n\nFirst, let me expand the (x² - 3)² term:\n\n(x² - 3)² = x⁴ - 6x² + 9.\n\nSo, f(x) becomes:\n\nf(x) = x² + (1/2)(x�"

So, squared distance is 5/2, so the distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that again:\n\nf(sqrt(2)) = (1/2)( (sqrt(2))^4 ) - 2*(sqrt(2))^2 + 9/2\n\n(sqrt(2))^4 = (2)^2 = 4,\n\nso, (1/2)(4) = 2,\n\n(sqrt(2))^2 = 2, so 2*(2) is 4. Wait, no, in f(x), it's -2x², so it's -2*(2) = -4.\n\nSo, 2 - 4 + 4.5 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for x = -sqrt(2), the result should be the same because f(x) is even in x:\n\nf(-sqrt(2)) = same as f(sqrt(2)) = 5/2.\n\nSo, the squared distances at critical points are:\n\nAt x=0: 9/2,\n\nAt x=±sqrt(2): 5/2.\n\nSo, 5/2 is less than 9/2, so the minimum occurs at x = ±sqrt(2).\n\nTherefore, the minimal squared distance is 5/2, so the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2).\n\nSimplify sqrt(5/2): sqrt(5)/sqrt(2). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2):\n\nsqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2, which can be written as sqrt(10)/2.\n\nIn the problem statement, it says that the distance can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a is square-free. So, in this case, a is 10 and b is 2.\n\nCheck if a is square-free: 10 factors into 2*5, neither of which is a square,"

Then set to zero, 2x³ -4x =0, which factors to 2x(x² - 2) = 0, so x=0, x= sqrt(2), x=-sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nCompute f(0): 0 + (1/2)(0 -3)^2 = (1/2)(9) = 9/2, yes.\n\nf(sqrt(2)): (sqrt(2))^4 is 4, so (1/2)(4) = 2, (sqrt(2))^2 is 2, so -2*(2) = -4, then +9/2. So 2 -4 +4.5 is 2.5, which is 5/2, correct.\n\nSo, squared distance is 5/2, so distance is sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2.\n\nExpressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a=10, b=2, which are positive integers, and a is square-free.\n\nHence, a + b =10 + 2 =12.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider that maybe the minimal distance is at x=0? But in that case, the point would be (0, y), where y = (1/√2)(0 -3) = -3/√2, so the point is (0, -3/√2). The distance from origin is 3/√2, which is about 2.121.\n\nBut when x is sqrt(2), the point is (sqrt(2), y). Let me compute y at x = sqrt(2):\n\ny = (1/√2)( (sqrt(2))^2 -3 ) = (1/√2)(2 -3) = (-1)/√2. So, the point is (sqrt(2), -1/√2). The distance is sqrt( (sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/√2)^2 ) = sqrt(2 + 1/"

So, a=10, b=2, so a+b=12.\n\nAnother way to think about it: using vectors or geometry. The minimal distance from the origin to the parabola is along the line perpendicular to the tangent at that point. So, the derivative at that point should be the slope of the tangent, and the line connecting the origin to that point should have a slope that's the negative reciprocal of the tangent slope. But this method would lead to the same result as the calculus approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parameterize the point on the parabola as (x, (1/√2)(x² -3)), and then the distance squared is x^2 + ( (1/√2)(x² -3) )^2, same as f(x) above.\n\nAnother sanity check: when I did the derivative, was that correct?\n\nf(x) = x² + (1/2)(x² -3)^2.\n\nf'(x) = 2x + (1/2)*2*(x² -3)*(2x) ?\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have messed up my differentiation earlier.\n\nWait, (x² -3)^2 derivative is 2*(x² -3)*(2x) = 4x*(x² -3).\n\nWait, but I have f(x) = x² + (1/2)(x^4 -6x² +9).\n\nSo, f(x) = x² + (1/2)x^4 - 3x² + 9/2.\n\nSo f'(x) = derivative of x² is 2x,\n\nderivative of (1/2)x^4 is 2x^3,\n\nderivative of -3x² is -6x,\n\nderivative of 9/2 is 0.\n\nSo, f'(x) = 2x + 2x³ -6x.\n\nCombine like terms: 2x³ -4x.\n\nYes, correct, so that's what I had before.\n\nThus, my earlier calculations hold.\n\nSo, I think my answer is correct.
