            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find f(2015, 2). The function f is defined recursively, and it involves modulo 5 operations. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definition of the function f. The function f is defined on two variables, i and j, both non-negative integers. The function is recursive, so it has different cases depending on the values of i and j.\n\nThe function f is defined as follows:\n\n1. When i = 0 and j is between 0 and 4 (inclusive), f(i, j) is the remainder when j + 1 is divided by 5. So, f(0, j) = mod_5(j + 1). That part seems straightforward.\n\n2. When i is at least 1 and j = 0, f(i, 0) is f(i - 1, 1). So, if I'm at a certain i but the second argument is 0, I need to look back at f with i - 1 and j = 1.\n\n3. For i at least 1 and j between 1 and 4, f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). So, this is a nested recursion. It depends on f(i, j - 1), which is then used as the new j in f(i - 1, something).\n\nI need to find f(2015, 2). That's way out there. So, maybe there's a pattern or a cycle in the function values that I can exploit instead of computing it directly, because computing f(2015, 2) step by step would be computationally intensive.\n\nLet me try to compute some small values of f(i, j) to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n- f(0, 0) = mod_5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0, 1) = mod_5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0, 2) = mod_5(2 + 1) = 3\n- f(0, 3) = mod_5(3 + 1) = 4\n- f(0, 4) = mod_5"

Let's see if there's a pattern here. The i=1 row is the same as the i=0 row shifted by one? Let me check:\n\nOriginal i=0: [1,2,3,4,0]\ni=1: [2,3,4,0,1]\nYes, exactly. Each subsequent j in i=1 is the next element in the i=0 sequence, with the last element wrapping around to the first. So, it's like a cyclic shift.\n\nNow let's compute i=2.\n\nStarting with j=0:\n- f(2,0) = f(1,1) = 3 (from i=1, j=1)\n\nj=1:\n- f(2,1) = f(1, f(2,0)) = f(1,3) = 0 (since f(2,0)=3, so f(1,3)=0)\n\nWait, hold on.
