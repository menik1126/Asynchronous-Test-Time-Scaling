It's defined recursively, which can sometimes be a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The function f is defined on two variables, i and j, both of which are non-negative integers. For i, it can be 0, 1, 2, and so on, but for j, it's only 0 through 4 because the second set in the function's domain is {0,1,2,3,4}. The function f also maps back to the set {0,1,2,3,4}, so the output is always one of those five numbers.\n\nThe function is defined recursively in three cases:\n\n1. Base case: When i is 0, f(0, j) is just mod_5(j + 1). So for j = 0, it's mod_5(1) = 1; for j = 1, mod_5(2) = 2; and so on up to j = 4, which would be mod_5(5) = 0.\n\n2. Another base case: When i is at least 1 and j is 0, f(i, 0) is f(i - 1, 1). This seems to be a recursive step that reduces the problem to a lower value of i and a higher j.\n\n3. The recursive case: When i is at least 1 and j is between 1 and 4, f(i, j) is equal to f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). So each time, we're reducing j by 1 and then using that result as the new j in the function call for i - 1.\n\nWe need to find f(2015, 2). That seems pretty far out, but maybe there's a pattern or cycle that repeats so we don't have to compute all the way up to 2015.\n\nLet me try to compute some small values of f(i, j) to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst, when i = 0:\n\nf(0, 0) = mod_5(1) = 1\n\nf(0, 1) = mod_5(2"

Let me check that again. For j=4, since it's the last term, the formula is f(i-1, f(i, j-1)). So for i=1, j=4, it's f(0, f(1,3)). Since f(1,3) is 0, so f(0,0) is 1.
