So, the problem is:\n\nIf \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\) and \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\), then find \\(x\\).\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to find the value of \\(x\\) given these two logarithmic equations. Hmm, okay, let's take it one equation at a time.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\).\n\nI remember that one of the logarithm properties allows us to combine two logarithms with the same base by adding their arguments. Specifically, \\(\\log_b a + \\log_b c = \\log_b (a \\times c)\\). So, applying that here, I can combine the two logarithms on the left side.\n\nSo, applying the property, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\\).\n\nAlright, that simplifies things a bit. Now, let's compute the argument inside the logarithm. The product \\((x - y)(x + y)\\) is a difference of squares, so it equals \\(x^2 - y^2\\). So, substituting that in, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(\\log_6 (x^2 - y^2) = 2\\).\n\nNow, to get rid of the logarithm, I can convert this equation into its exponential form. Remember that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) is equivalent to \\(b^c = a\\). So, in this case, the base is 6, the exponent is 2, and the argument is \\(x^2 - y^2\\). Therefore:\n\n\\(6^2 = x^2 - y^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(6^2\\) gives 36, so the equation becomes:\n\n\\(36 = x^2 - y^2\\).\n\nOkay, that's the first equation simplified. Now, let me note that down: \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\). I'll keep that in mind for later.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\).\n\nAgain, this is"

            "output": " a logarithmic equation, and I need to convert it into its exponential form to see if I can find a relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\).\n\nSo, using the definition of logarithms, \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\) means that \\(y^2 = 5x\\).\n\nAlright, so \\(y^2 = 5x\\). That's another equation relating \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So, now I have two equations:\n\n1. \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\)\n2. \\(y^2 = 5x\\)\n\nHmm, okay, perfect. Now, I can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for \\(x\\). Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 2, \\(y^2 = 5x\\), so I can substitute \\(5x\\) in place of \\(y^2\\) in equation 1.\n\nSo, substituting into equation 1:\n\n\\(x^2 - 5x = 36\\).\n\nGreat, now I have a quadratic equation in terms of \\(x\\). Let me write that down:\n\n\\(x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0\\).\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for \\(x\\). I can use the quadratic formula, which is \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\), and \\(c = -36\\).\n\nLet me compute the discriminant first: \\(b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(-36) = 25 + 144 = 169\\).\n\nSo, the discriminant is 169, which is a perfect square (13^2). Therefore, the square root of 169 is 13.\n\nNow, plugging back into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\(x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm 13}{2(1)} = \\frac{5 \\pm 13}{2}\\).\n\nSo, this gives us two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\(x = \\frac{5 + 13}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9\\)\n2. \\(x = \\frac{5 - 13}{2} = \\frac{-8}{2} = -4\\)\n\nHmm,"

But wait, we need to check if these solutions are valid because we're dealing with logarithms, and logarithms have domain restrictions.\n\nLooking back at the first equation: \\(\\log_6 (x - y)\\) and \\(\\log_6 (x + y)\\). For the logarithm to be defined, the arguments must be positive.\n\nSo, that gives us two conditions:\n\n1. \\(x - y > 0\\)\n2. \\(x + y > 0\\)\n\nAlso, from the second equation, \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\), which implies that \\(y\\) must be positive and not equal to 1 (since it's a logarithm base). So, \\(y > 0\\) and \\(y \\neq 1\\).\n\nLet me check each value of \\(x\\) and see if they satisfy these conditions.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\(x = 9\\).\n\nFrom equation 2: \\(y^2 = 5x = 5(9) = 45\\). So, \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\). But, since \\(y\\) must be positive (as the base of a logarithm and greater than 1), we take the positive root: \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\).\n\nNow, let's check the conditions:\n\n1. \\(x - y = 9 - \\sqrt{45}\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{45}\\) is approximately 6.708, so 9 - 6.708 ≈ 2.292, which is positive. So, \\(x - y > 0\\).\n\n2. \\(x + y = 9 + \\sqrt{45}\\), which is definitely positive because both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive. So, \\(x + y > 0\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(x = 9\\) is a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's consider the other value \\(x = -4\\).\n\nAgain, using equation 2: \\(y^2 = 5x = 5(-4) = -20\\).\n\nWait a second, \\(y^2 = -20\\). But the square of a real number cannot be negative. So, \\(y^2 = -20\\) would imply that \\(y\\) is imaginary,"
