So, the question is:\n\nIf log base 6 of (x - y) plus log base 6 of (x + y) equals 2, and log base y of 5x equals 2, then find x.\n\nHmm, alright. Let's break this down. There are two logarithmic equations here, both involving x and y. I need to find the value of x, so I probably need to express y in terms of x or vice versa and then substitute.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2.\n\nI remember that when you add two logarithms with the same base, it's equivalent to the logarithm of the product of their arguments. So, log\u2086(A) + log\u2086(B) = log\u2086(A*B). Applying that here:\n\nlog\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2.\n\nSimplifying the inside of the logarithm: (x - y)(x + y) is a difference of squares, so that becomes x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nlog\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2.\n\nNow, to convert this logarithmic equation to its exponential form, I can rewrite it as:\n\n6\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\nBecause if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a. So, 6\u00b2 is 36. Thus:\n\n36 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\nLet me label this as equation (1) for reference.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log_y(5x) = 2.\n\nAgain, converting the logarithmic equation to exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So here, y\u00b2 = 5x.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\ny\u00b2 = 5x.\n\nI can label this as equation (2).\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) 36 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\n2) y\u00b2 = 5x.\n\nI can substitute equation (2) into equation (1). Since y\u00b2 is equal to 5x, plug that into equation (1):\n\n36 = x\u00b2 - 5x.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation"

            "output": " for x. Let's see, can I factor it?\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add to -5. Let's think:\n\nPossible factors of 36: 1 & 36, 2 & 18, 3 & 12, 4 & 9, 6 & 6.\n\nLooking for a pair that adds up to -5. Hmm, 4 and -9: 4 * (-9) = -36, and 4 + (-9) = -5. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, we can factor the quadratic as:\n\n(x + 4)(x - 9) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives:\n\nx + 4 = 0 => x = -4,\n\nx - 9 = 0 => x = 9.\n\nSo, the solutions are x = -4 and x = 9.\n\nBut wait, we need to check these solutions in the original logarithmic equations because logarithms have domain restrictions. Specifically, the arguments must be positive.\n\nFirst, for x = -4.\n\nLooking at the first equation: log\u2086(x - y) and log\u2086(x + y) must be defined. Therefore:\n\nx - y > 0,\n\nx + y > 0.\n\nIf x = -4, let's see if y can satisfy these conditions.\n\nFrom equation (2): y\u00b2 = 5x. If x = -4, y\u00b2 = 5*(-4) = -20.\n\nBut y\u00b2 can't be negative because the square of a real number is always non-negative. So, y\u00b2 = -20 has no real solution. Therefore, x = -4 is not a valid solution.\n\nNow, checking x = 9.\n\nFrom equation (2): y\u00b2 = 5*9 = 45. So, y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). Simplifying sqrt(45) is 3*sqrt(5), so y = \u00b13\u221a5.\n\nNow, checking the domain for the first equation.\n\nFirst, x + y > 0 and x - y > 0.\n\nSince x = 9, we have:\n\n9 + y > 0 and 9 - y > 0.\n\nLet's consider y = 3\u221a5. 3\u221a5 is approximately 3*2.236 = 6.708.\n\nSo, 9 + 6."

Therefore, x = 9 is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 9.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Converted the sum of logs to the log of a product, leading to 36 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2.\n\n2. Solved the second logarithmic equation to find y\u00b2 = 5x.\n\n3. Substituted and got a quadratic equation, which factored into (x + 4)(x - 9) = 0, so x = -4 or 9.\n\n4. Checked both solutions: x = -4 invalid because y\u00b2 would be negative. x = 9 is valid since y\u00b2 = 45, and both positive and negative y keep the arguments positive.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, x is definitely 9.\n</think>\n\nThe solution involves combining the logarithmic equations into algebraic form, substituting, solving a quadratic, and verifying the solutions. After checking, x = 9 is the valid solution.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{9}"
