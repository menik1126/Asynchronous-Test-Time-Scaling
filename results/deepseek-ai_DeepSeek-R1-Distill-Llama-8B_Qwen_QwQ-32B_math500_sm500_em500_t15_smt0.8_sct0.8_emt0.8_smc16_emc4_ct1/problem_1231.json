Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that when working with modular arithmetic, especially with congruences, it's often helpful to substitute the equivalent value. Since \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), that means when I divide \\( n \\) by 7, the remainder is 2. So, maybe I can replace \\( n \\) with 2 in the expression and see what happens.\n\nLet me write down the expression: \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\). If I substitute \\( n = 2 \\), it becomes \\( (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \\). Let me compute each part:\n\n- \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 4 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 2 + 6 = 8 \\)\n\nSo now the expression is \\( 4 \\times 6 \\times 8 \\). Let me calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply 4 and 6: \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\). Then, multiply 24 by 8: \\( 24 \\times 8 = 192 \\).\n\nNow, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 7. So, I need to find \\( 192 \\div 7 \\) and see what the remainder is. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without dealing with large numbers.\n\nWait, but 192 is a big number. Let me think if I can break it down using modulo properties. Since I know \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), all the terms \\( (n + 2), (n + 4), (n + 6) \\) can also be simplified modulo 7.\n\nLet me calculate each term modulo 7:\n\n- \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n"

            "output": "- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 = 8 \\pmod{7} \\). But 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so this is \\( 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\nSo now, the expression modulo 7 becomes \\( 4 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\nLet's compute that step by step. First, multiply 4 and 6:\n\n\\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\), and 24 modulo 7. Hmm, 7 times 3 is 21, so 24 - 21 = 3. So, \\( 24 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\). \n\nThen, multiply that result by 1: \\( 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\). \n\nSo, \\( 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\pmod{7} \\). \n\nTherefore, the entire expression \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is congruent to 3 modulo 7. So, when it's divided by 7, the remainder is 3.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my substitution approach earlier. When I substituted \\( n = 2 \\), I got the product as 192, which is 7*27=189. So, 192 - 189 = 3. Yep, remainder 3. That matches my modular approach. So both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about each term's contribution. Let me consider each factor:\n\n\\( n + 2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\n\\( n + 4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\n\\( n + 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\) because 2 + 6 is 8, which is 1 more than 7.\n\nSo, multiplying these together: 4*6=24, which is 3 mod7, as before. Then 3*1=3, so the total is 3 mod7.\n\nJust to ensure I haven't missed anything, let me try another approach. Maybe expand the entire expression first before substituting.\n\nLet me expand \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\"

Let's do that:\n\n\\( n(n + 4) + 2(n + 4) = n^2 + 4n + 2n + 8 = n^2 + 6n + 8 \\).\n\nNow, multiply this by \\( (n + 6) \\):\n\n\\( (n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) \\).\n\nExpanding term by term:\n\n- \\( n^2 \\times n = n^3 \\)\n- \\( n^2 \\times 6 = 6n^2 \\)\n- \\( 6n \\times n = 6n^2 \\)\n- \\( 6n \\times 6 = 36n \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times n = 8n \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\)\n\nSo, combining all these:\n\n\\( n^3 + 6n^2 + 6n^2 + 36n + 8n + 48 \\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\( n^3 \\)\n- \\( 6n^2 + 6n^2 = 12n^2 \\)\n- \\( 36n + 8n = 44n \\)\n- \\( 48 \\)\n\nSo, the expanded form is \\( n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48 \\).\n\nNow, substitute \\( n = 2 \\) (since \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod7 \\)) into this polynomial:\n\n\\( 2^3 + 12(2)^2 + 44(2) + 48 \\).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- \\( 2^3 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 12(2)^2 = 12*4 = 48 \\)\n- \\( 44(2) = 88 \\)\n- \\( 48 = 48 \\)\n\nAdd them up:\n\n8 + 48 = 56\n\n56 + 88 = 144\n\n144 + 48 = 192\n\nSo, again, we get 192, which as before gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. So all methods confirm that the remainder is 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of modular arithmetic properties without substituting.\n\nSince \\( n"
