Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with congruences, it's often helpful to substitute the given value into the expression. Since n \u2261 2 mod 7, that means n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. But I'm not sure if I need to compute the entire expression or if there's a smarter way to handle this.\n\nWait, maybe I can simplify the expression modulo 7 first before plugging in. Let me think: (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Maybe I can compute each term modulo 7 separately.\n\nSo, n \u2261 2 mod 7. Then:\n\nn + 2 \u2261 2 + 2 \u2261 4 mod 7\n\nn + 4 \u2261 2 + 4 \u2261 6 mod 7\n\nn + 6 \u2261 2 + 6 \u2261 8 mod 7, but 8 mod 7 is 1. So n + 6 \u2261 1 mod 7.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7.\n\nMultiplying these together: 4 * 6 = 24, and 24 * 1 = 24. Now, 24 mod 7. Let's see, 7*3=21, so 24 -21=3. Therefore, 24 mod7=3.\n\nWait, so is the remainder 3? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I could expand the entire product and then take modulo 7. Let's try that. (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). First, multiply (n + 2)(n + 4):\n\n(n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 6n + 8.\n\nThen, multiply by (n + 6):\n\n(n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) = n^3 + 6n^2 + 8n"

So the expanded polynomial is n^3 +12n^2 +44n +48.\n\nNow, since n \u2261 2 mod7, let's compute each term modulo 7.\n\nFirst, compute n mod7, which is 2.\n\nn^3 \u2261 2^3 = 8 \u22611 mod7.\n\n12n^2: 12 mod7 is 5, and n^2=4, so 5*4=20 \u22616 mod7.\n\n44n: 44 mod7. Let's divide 44 by7: 7*6=42, so 44-42=2. So 44n \u22612n mod7. n=2, so 2*2=4 mod7.\n\n48: 48 divided by7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6. So 48\u22616 mod7.\n\nNow, sum all these: 1 (from n^3) +6 (from12n^2) +4 (from44n) +6 (from48). Total is 1+6=7, 7+4=11, 11+6=17.\n\n17 mod7: 7*2=14, 17-14=3. So 17\u22613 mod7. Therefore, the remainder is 3.\n\nWait, that confirms my earlier result. So regardless of whether I compute each term mod7 before multiplying or expand and then compute each term mod7, I get 3. So I think that's the correct remainder.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try plugging in an actual number for n. Since n \u22612 mod7, let me choose n=2, which is the smallest positive integer in that congruence class.\n\nCompute (2 +2)(2 +4)(2 +6) = (4)(6)(8). Compute it: 4*6=24, 24*8=192.\n\nNow, divide 192 by7. 7*27=189, 192-189=3. So the remainder is3, which"

Then (9+2)(9+4)(9+6) =11*13*15.\n\nCalculate 11*13=143, then 143*15=2145.\n\nNow, divide 2145 by7. Let's see, 7*300=2100, 2145-2100=45. 45 divided by7 is6 with remainder3, because7*6=42, 45-42=3. So 2145 mod7=3 again. So that works too.\n\nTherefore, through multiple methods, I'm confident that the remainder is3 when (n + 2)(n +4)(n +6) is divided by7, given thatn \u22612 mod7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nGiven \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), we need to find the remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7.\n\nFirst, we substitute \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 7 \\) into each term of the product:\n\n- \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nNow, we compute the product modulo 7:\n\\[\n(4)(6)(1) = 24 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nTo verify, we expand the polynomial \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\):\n\\[\n(n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 6n + 8\n\\]\n\\[\n(n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) = n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( n \\equiv 2 \\mod 7 \\):\n- \\( n^3 \\equiv 8 \\equiv 1"
