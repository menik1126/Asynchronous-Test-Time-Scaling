Hmm, I remember that rotating a point in the complex plane can be done by translating the point so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, applying the rotation, and then translating back. Let me try to recall the exact steps.\n\nFirst, let me write down the given complex numbers. \\( z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\) and \\( c = 2 - 3i \\). So, \\( z \\) is a complex number with real part \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\) and imaginary part \\( -3 - 3\\sqrt{2} \\). \\( c \\) is another complex number with real part 2 and imaginary part -3.\n\nTo rotate \\( z \\) around \\( c \\), I think I need to translate \\( z \\) so that \\( c \\) becomes the origin. That means subtracting \\( c \\) from \\( z \\). So, let me compute \\( z - c \\).\n\nCalculating \\( z - c \\):\n- Real part: \\( (2 + \\sqrt{2}) - 2 = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n- Imaginary part: \\( (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2}) - (-3) = (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2}) + 3 = -3\\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nSo, \\( z - c = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\). Now, this is the point relative to the origin after translating \\( c \\) to the origin.\n\nNext step is to rotate this translated point by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) counter-clockwise. The rotation of a complex number \\( a + bi \\) by an angle \\( \\theta \\) is given by multiplying by \\( \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta \\). For \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\). Therefore, the rotation factor is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac"

I'll do this step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, let me write down the multiplication:\n\\( (\\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i)(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i) \\)\n\nI can distribute this multiplication:\nFirst term: \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\)\nSecond term: \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i = \\frac{2}{2}i = i \\)\nThird term: \\( -3\\sqrt{2}i \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}/2 \\times i = -3 \\times 2 / 2 i = -3i \\)\nFourth term: \\( -3\\sqrt{2}i \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i = (-3\\sqrt{2}) \\times (\\sqrt{2}/2) \\times i^2 = (-3 \\times 2 / 2) \\times (-1) = (-3) \\times (-1) = 3 \\)\n\nWait, hold on.

That's correct.\n\nSecond term: \\( \\sqrt{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} i = \\frac{2}{2}i = i \\). Correct.\n\nThird term: \\( -3\\sqrt{2}i \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = (-3 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2}) / 2 i = (-3 \\times 2)/2 i = (-6)/2"

So, adding these:\n\nReal part: \\( 4 + 2 = 6 \\)\nImaginary part: \\( -2i + (-3i) = -5i \\)\n\nWait, no. Wait, hold on. Wait, \\( 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = (4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i) = 6 - 5i \\).

That's correct.\n\nThen, rotation gives \\( 4 - 2i \\), then adding back \\( c = 2 - 3i \\), so \\( (4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i) = 6 -5i \\). Hmm, but let me check the Asymptote code's coordinates.
