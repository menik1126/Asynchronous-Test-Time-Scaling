Hmm, I remember that rotating a complex number can be done using some kind of formula. Let me recall.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. The complex number \\( z \\) is given as \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\), and \\( c \\) is \\( 2 - 3i \\). I need to rotate \\( z \\) around \\( c \\) by \\( 45^\\circ \\) or \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) radians. \n\nSo, to rotate a point around another point in the complex plane, I think the general formula is: \\( w = c + (z - c) \\cdot e^{i\\theta} \\). Here, \\( \\theta \\) is the angle of rotation, which is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) in this case. \n\nLet me make sure I remember correctly. The idea is to translate the complex plane so that \\( c \\) is at the origin, rotate \\( z \\) by the angle, and then translate back. So yes, that formula seems right.\n\nSo, let's calculate \\( z - c \\) first. \\( z \\) is \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i \\) and \\( c \\) is \\( 2 - 3i \\). Subtracting \\( c \\) from \\( z \\) should give me \\( (2 + \\sqrt{2} - 2) + (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2} + 3)i \\). Wait, that simplifies to \\( \\sqrt{2} + (-3\\sqrt{2})i \\). Let me check that:\n\n\\( z - c = (2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) \\)\n= \\( (2 + \\sqrt{2} - 2) + (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2} + 3)i \\)\n= \\( \\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\)\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, \\( z - c"

Wait, in complex numbers, the coordinates are (real part, imaginary part). So, the complex number z is 2 + sqrt(2) for the real part, and the imaginary part is -3 -3*sqrt(2). Wait, but in the problem statement, z is written as 2 + sqrt(2) - (3 + 3 sqrt(2))i. Which would mean the imaginary part is -(3 + 3 sqrt(2)), so that's -3 -3 sqrt(2). So that matches the Asymptote code. So that's correct.\n\nThen, c is (2, -3), so 2 -3i, which matches the problem statement.\n\nThe Asymptote code draws Z--C--W, and the angle is labeled at C with pi/4. So, the rotation is around point C.\n\nHmm, so according to my calculation, the result is 6 -5i. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the rotation direction? The problem says counter-clockwise, which is the standard direction for complex multiplication. Since multiplying by e^{i theta} is a counter-clockwise rotation. So that should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check with coordinates.\n\nLet me think of z as a point in the plane. Let me compute coordinates:\n\nz has real part 2 + sqrt(2), and imaginary part is - (3 + 3 sqrt(2)), so the coordinates are (2 + sqrt(2), -3 -3 sqrt(2)).\n\nc is (2, -3).\n\nSo, the vector from c to z is ( (2 + sqrt(2) - 2), (-3 -3 sqrt(2) - (-3)) ) = (sqrt(2), -3 sqrt(2)). So that's the vector from c to z, which is the same as the complex number sqrt(2) - 3 sqrt(2) i, which matches what I had before.\n\nNow, rotating this vector by 45 degrees counter-clockwise.
