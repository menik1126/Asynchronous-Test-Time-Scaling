Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me see if I can figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the expression looks like. The numerator is (x - y), which is a linear expression, and the denominator is x\u2074 + y\u2074 + 6. Both x and y are real numbers, so they can be positive or negative. I need to find the maximum value of this fraction.\n\nI remember that when dealing with expressions that have variables in both the numerator and denominator, one approach is to use calculus, specifically partial derivatives, to find critical points. That might work here, but before jumping into calculus, maybe there's a smarter way to simplify or bound the expression.\n\nLet me think about the denominator. It's x\u2074 + y\u2074 + 6. Since x\u2074 and y\u2074 are always non-negative for real numbers, the smallest the denominator can be is 6. So the denominator is always at least 6, which means the maximum value of the entire fraction would be at most 1/6, right? But wait, is that actually achievable? Maybe not, because the numerator could vary depending on x and y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express this fraction in terms that make it easier to analyze. For example, maybe I can set u = x - y or something like that. Let's try that.\n\nLet me let u = x - y. Then, perhaps I can express y in terms of x and u: y = x - u. Substituting this into the original expression might help.\n\nSo, substituting y = x - u into the denominator gives:\n\nx\u2074 + (x - u)\u2074 + 6.\n\nHmm, that might complicate things because the denominator becomes a function of both x and u. Not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe instead of u = x - y, I can consider the ratio of x and y. Let's denote t = y/x, assuming x \u2260 0 for now. Then y = t x. Let me try substituting this into the expression.\n\nSo the numerator becomes x - y = x - t x = x(1 - t).\n\nThe denominator becomes"

Maybe I can set z = x^4, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can fix t and then optimize over x?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such that x and y are related in some symmetric way. Wait, the expression isn't symmetric, but maybe there's a substitution that can make it symmetric?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider polar coordinates? Since x and y are real numbers, maybe converting to polar coordinates where x = r cos\u03b8 and y = r sin\u03b8. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set x = r cos\u03b8 and y = r sin\u03b8. Then, the numerator becomes r cos\u03b8 - r sin\u03b8 = r (cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8).\n\nThe denominator becomes (r^4 cos\u2074\u03b8 + r^4 sin\u2074\u03b8) + 6 = r^4 (cos\u2074\u03b8 + sin\u2074\u03b8) + 6.\n\nSo the expression becomes [r (cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8)] / [r^4 (cos\u2074\u03b8 + sin\u2074\u03b8) + 6].\n\nHmm, so now the expression is in terms of r and \u03b8. To maximize this, perhaps for each \u03b8, we can find the optimal r, then maximize over \u03b8?\n\nYes, that might work. Let me fix \u03b8 and consider the function f(r) = [r (cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8)] / [r^4 (cos\u2074\u03b8 + sin\u2074\u03b8) + 6].\n\nWe can treat this as a function of r for fixed \u03b8, and find its maximum. Then, after finding the maximum over r for each \u03b8, we can then maximize over \u03b8.\n\nFirst, let me note that if cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 = 0, then the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero. So the maximum must occur when cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 \u2260 0. Let's assume cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 \u2260 0 for now.\n\nLet me denote A = cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 and B = cos\u2074\u03b8 + sin\u2074\u03b8. Then, the expression becomes f(r) = (A r)/(B r"

The function is defined for all real numbers. So maybe the issue is that when we set y =kx, we found a critical point along that line, but the Lagrange multiplier method requires the gradient condition in the entire plane, so the point (1, -1) is a local maximum along the line y = -x but not a critical point in the plane.\n\nTherefore, the maximum over all real numbers might actually be 1/4, but we need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a higher value.\n\nWait, let me try some other points.\n\nSuppose x = 2, y = -1.\n\nThen numerator is 2 - (-1)=3.\n\nDenominator is 16 +1 +6=23.\n\n3/23\u22480.13 <1/4.\n\nx=1.5, y=-1.5:\n\nNumerator: 3.\n\nDenominator: (1.5)^4 + (1.5)^4 +6 = 2*(5.0625) +6\u224810.12"

The expression becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x(1 - k)}{x^4(1 + k^4) + 6}\n     \\]\n   - Let \\(f(x) = \\frac{x(1 - k)}{x^4(1 + k^4) + 6}\\). To maximize \\(f(x)\\), take the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) and set it to zero:\n     \\[\n     f'(x) = \\frac{(1 - k)(-3x^4(1 + k^4) + 6)}{(x^4(1 + k^4) + 6)^2} = 0\n     \\]\n   - Solving \\(-3x^4(1 + k^4) + 6 = 0\\) gives \\(x^4 = \\frac{2}{1 + k^4}\\). Substituting back, the maximum value for each \\(k\\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(1 - k) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{1 + k^4}\\right)^{1/4}}{8}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we find the critical point at \\(k = -1\\), leading to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Verification with Lagrange Multipliers**:\n   - Setting \\(y = -x\\), the expression simplifies to \\(\\frac{2x}{2x^4 + 6}\\). Maximizing this gives the same result \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) at \\(x = 1\\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The maximum value of the expression is achieved at \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = -1\\), yielding the value \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\n\\]"
