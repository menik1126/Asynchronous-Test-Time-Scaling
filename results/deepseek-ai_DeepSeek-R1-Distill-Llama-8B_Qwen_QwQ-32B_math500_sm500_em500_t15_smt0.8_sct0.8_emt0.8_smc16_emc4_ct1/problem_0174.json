            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. I need to find the positive value of x that satisfies this. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that cube roots can be tricky, but maybe if I get rid of the cube root, the equation will become easier to handle. So, to do that, I should probably cube both sides of the equation. That should help me eliminate the cube root.\n\nSo, starting with the original equation:\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\n\\]\nIf I cube both sides, the cube root on the left should disappear. Let me write that out step by step.\n\nCubing the left side gives me just x squared minus 4x plus 4 because the cube and the cube root cancel each other out. On the right side, I have 16 cubed. Okay, so now my equation is:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3\n\\]\nI need to figure out what 16 cubed is. Let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16. Hmm, let's do that step by step. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 is... 4096. Okay, so 16 cubed is 4096.\n\nSo now my equation is:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\n\\]\nHmm, this looks like a quadratic equation. I should try to rearrange it so it's in standard form, which is ax squared plus bx plus c equals 0. To do that, I'll subtract 4096 from both sides:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0\n\\]\nSimplifying that, 4 minus 4096 is -4092. So the equation becomes:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\n\\]\nAlright, now I have a quadratic equation. I need to solve for x. There are a couple of methods: factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula."

            "output": " Given how large the numbers are, factoring might not be straightforward. Maybe the quadratic formula is the way to go.\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nIn my equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Plugging those into the formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\nSimplify the numerator first. The negative of negative 4 is 4. Inside the square root, (-4)^2 is 16, and then minus 4 times 1 times -4092 is +16368. So:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}\n\\]\nAdding those numbers: 16 plus 16368 is 16384. So now:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16384}}{2}\n\\]\nI need to figure out what the square root of 16384 is. Hmm, I don't remember exactly, but I can try to calculate it. Let me think: 128 squared is 16384 because 128 times 128 is 16384. Wait, let me double-check that. 120 squared is 14400, and 128 is 8 more than 120. So (120 + 8)^2 is 120^2 + 2*120*8 + 8^2, which is 14400 + 1920 + 64. That's 14400 + 1920 is 16320, plus 64 is 16384. Yes, so sqrt(16384) is 128.\n\nSo plugging that back in:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm 128}{2}\n\\]\nSo there are two possible solutions here. Let's calculate both.\n\nFirst, with the plus sign:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 + 128}{2} = \\frac{132}{2} = 66\n\\]\nSecond, with the minus sign:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 - 128}{2} = \\frac{-124}{2} = -62\n\\]\nSo the two solutions are x = 66"

However, the question specifically asks for the positive value of x, so the answer is 66.\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the original equation:\nCube both sides: (x\u00b2 -4x +4) = 16\u00b3 = 4096. Then moving everything to one side: x\u00b2 -4x +4 -4096 = x\u00b2 -4x -4092 = 0.\n\nQuadratic formula: x = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 16368)] / 2. 16 + 16368 is 16384, whose sqrt is 128. So x = (4 \u00b1128)/2. So 132/2 =66; -124/2 = -62. Positive solution is 66. That seems correct.\n\nWait a second, let me check to make sure plugging x=66 back into the original equation works.\n\nOriginal equation: cube root of (x\u00b2 -4x +4). So for x=66:\n\nx\u00b2 = 66\u00b2 = 4356\n\n-4x = -264\n\nSo 4356 -264 +4 = 4356 -264 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096.\n\nCube root of 4096 is 16 because 16\u00b3 is 4096. So yes, that works.\n\nJust to make sure, let's plug in x=-62:\n\nx\u00b2 = (-62)^2 = 3844\n\n-4x = 248\n\nSo 3844 +248 +4 = 3844 + 248 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096.\n\nCube root of 4096 is still 16, so that's correct too. But since the question asks for positive x, 66 is the answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for the positive value of \\( x \\) in the equation \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\):\n\n1. **Cube both sides** to eliminate the cube root:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3\n   \\]\n2. **Calculate \\( 16^3 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   16^3 = 4096\n   \\]\n3. **Set up the quadratic equation** by subtracting"
