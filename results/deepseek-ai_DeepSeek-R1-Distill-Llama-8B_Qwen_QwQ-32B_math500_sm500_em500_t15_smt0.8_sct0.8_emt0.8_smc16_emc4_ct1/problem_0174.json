            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve the equation where the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let's write that down: ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. Alright, cube roots can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that to get rid of a cube root, you can cube both sides of the equation. That should help simplify things.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the equation for clarity. So, the cube root of (x² - 4x + 4) is 16. To eliminate the cube root, I'll cube both sides. That gives me (x² - 4x + 4) = 16 cubed. Hmm, what is 16 cubed? Let me calculate that. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... wait, 256 * 10 is 2560, 256 * 6 is 1536, so adding those together gives 2560 + 1536 = 4096. So, 16 cubed is 4096.\n\nNow the equation is x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. Okay, so now I have a quadratic equation. To solve for x, I should set it equal to zero. So, subtract 4096 from both sides: x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplify that, and I get x² - 4x - 4092 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic equation in standard form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -4, and c = -4092. I can solve this using the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Let's plug in the values.\n\nFirst, compute the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac. So, b² is (-4) squared, which is 16. Then, 4ac is 4 * 1 * (-4092), which is 4 * (-4092) = -16368. So, the discriminant is 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding, so that becomes 16 + 16368 = 16384.\n\nWait, 16384 seems"

            "output": " like a perfect square? I think so. Because 128 squared is 16384. Let me check: 128 * 128. 100*100=10000, 100*28=2800, 28*100=2800, and 28*28=784. So, (100 + 28)^2 = 10000 + 2*2800 + 784 = 10000 + 5600 + 784 = 16384. Yes, so the square root of 16384 is 128.\n\nSo now, plugging back into the quadratic formula: x = [-(-4) ± 128]/(2*1). That simplifies to x = (4 ± 128)/2. So, there are two solutions here.\n\nFirst solution: (4 + 128)/2. That's 132 divided by 2, which equals 66. Second solution: (4 - 128)/2. That's (-124)/2, which is -62.\n\nBut the question asks for the positive value of x, so 66 is the answer. Wait, I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from the beginning: cube both sides correctly? Yes, 16 cubed is definitely 4096. Then, moving 4096 to the left side gives x² - 4x + 4 - 4096, which simplifies to x² - 4x - 4092. Correct. Then quadratic formula with a=1, b=-4, c=-4092. Calculated discriminant correctly: 16 + 16368 = 16384, which is 128 squared. So, sqrt(16384)=128. Then x=(4+128)/2=66 and x=(4-128)/2=-62. Yes, that all checks out.\n\nSo, the positive solution is 66. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for the positive value of \\( x \\) in the equation \\( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cube both sides** to eliminate the cube root:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} \\right)^3 = 16^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^"
