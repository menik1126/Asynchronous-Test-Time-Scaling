He first walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile and then an additional \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile, so the total southward distance is \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\) mile.\n\nNext, I'll determine Bill's eastward displacement. He walks \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east.\n\nFinally, to find the straight-line distance from his starting point, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem. The displacement south is the vertical side (1 mile), and the displacement east is the horizontal side (\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile). Plugging these values into the formula gives the straight-line distance as \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2}\\).\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate Total Southward Distance:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile south} + \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ mile south} = 1 \\text{ mile south}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine Eastward Displacement:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ mile east}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Southward Distance})^2 + (\\text{Eastward Distance})^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 0.5625} = \\sqrt{1.5625} \\approx 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.25}\n\\]"
