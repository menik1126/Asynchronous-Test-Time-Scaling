            "output": "First, identify the total displacement in the southern direction. Bill walks \u00bd mile south twice, so the total southward distance is 1 mile.\n\nNext, determine the eastward displacement. Bill walks \u00be mile east, which means he has a net displacement of \u00be mile to the east.\n\nNow, calculate the straight-line distance from the starting point using the Pythagorean theorem. The displacement forms a right-angled triangle where the legs are 1 mile and \u00be mile.\n\nFinally, compute the distance using the formula \u221a(1\u00b2 + (\u00be)\u00b2) and convert it to a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's break down Bill's movements step by step and calculate his straight-line distance from the starting point using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n1. **Southern Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks **\u00bd mile** south.\n   - Then, he walks another **\u00bd mile** south.\n   - **Total Southern Displacement:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile south.\n\n2. **Eastern Displacement:**\n   - Bill walks **\u00be mile** east.\n   - **Net Eastern Displacement:** \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n\n3. **Calculating the Straight-Line Distance:**\n   - Bill's displacement forms a right-angled triangle with legs of 1 mile (south) and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile (east).\n   - Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{South Displacement})^2 + (\\text{East Displacement})^2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{1^2 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{9}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{16}} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{1.25}"
