This results in \\(x - 9 = 74\\).\n\nFinally, I'll add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\), which gives me \\(x = 83\\).\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( x \\) step by step.\n\n1. **Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:**\n\n\\[\n2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\times (x + 37)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\\]\n\n2. **Subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides to isolate \\( x \\) terms:**\n\n\\[\n3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx - 9 = 74\n\\]\n\n3. **Add 9 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\):**\n\n\\[\nx = 74 + 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 83\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{83}\\)"
