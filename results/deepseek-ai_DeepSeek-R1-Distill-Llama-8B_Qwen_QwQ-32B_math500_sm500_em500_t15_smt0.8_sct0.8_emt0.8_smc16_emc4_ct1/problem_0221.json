            "output": "First, I need to identify the areas of the three regions labeled X, Y, and Z based on the diagram of three concentric circles with radii 4, 6, and 7.\n\nI'll start by calculating the area of the largest circle, which has a radius of 7. Using the formula for the area of a circle, A = \u03c0r\u00b2, so the area is \u03c0*(7)\u00b2 = 49\u03c0.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the area of the middle circle with a radius of 6. Applying the same formula, the area is \u03c0*(6)\u00b2 = 36\u03c0.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the area of the smallest circle with a radius of 4. The area is \u03c0*(4)\u00b2 = 16\u03c0.\n\nNow, I'll determine the areas of the regions X, Y, and Z. Region Y is the area between the largest and middle circles, so its area is 49\u03c0 - 36\u03c0 = 13\u03c0. Region X is the area between the middle and smallest circles, so its area is 36\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = 20\u03c0. Region Z is the area of the smallest circle, which is 16\u03c0.\n\nComparing the areas of the regions, the largest area is 20\u03c0 (Region X) and the smallest area is 16\u03c0 (Region Z). The difference between these areas is 20\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = 4\u03c0.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll analyze each region step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Areas of the Circles\nGiven the radii of the three concentric circles:\n- **Circle with radius 7**: Area = \\( \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi \\)\n- **Circle with radius 6**: Area = \\( \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi \\)\n- **Circle with radius 4**: Area = \\( \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Areas of the Regions\n1. **Region X**: This is the area between the largest circle (radius 7) and the middle circle (radius 6).  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of Region X} = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi\n   \\]\n\n2. **Region Y**: This is the area between the middle circle"
