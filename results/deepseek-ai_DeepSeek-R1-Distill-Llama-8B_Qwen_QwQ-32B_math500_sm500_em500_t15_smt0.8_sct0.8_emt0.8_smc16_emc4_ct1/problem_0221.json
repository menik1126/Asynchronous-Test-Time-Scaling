            "output": "To determine the area differences between regions X, Y, and Z, I first need to find the areas of each labeled region based on the radii provided.\n\nStarting with the largest circle, which has a radius of 7, the area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr². Plugging in the radius, the area is π*(7)² = 49π.\n\nNext, the middle circle has a radius of 6, so its area is π*(6)² = 36π.\n\nThe smallest circle has a radius of 4, giving it an area of π*(4)² = 16π.\n\nNow, I need to identify the areas of regions X, Y, and Z based on these calculations.\n\nAssuming region X is the area between the largest and middle circles, its area would be 49π - 36π = 13π.\n\nRegion Y, located between the middle and smallest circles, would have an area of 36π - 16π = 20π.\n\nFinally, region Z is the area of the smallest circle, which remains 16π.\n\nComparing these areas:\n- Region Y has the largest area at 20π.\n- Region X has an area of 13π.\n- Region Z has the smallest area at 16π.\n\nTo find the difference between the largest and smallest areas, I subtract the smallest area from the largest: 20π - 16π = 4π.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the difference between the areas of the regions, let's analyze each region step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the Areas of the Circles:**\n   - **Circle with radius 7 (Largest Circle):** \n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{largest}} = \\pi \\times (7)^2 = 49\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 6 (Middle Circle):** \n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{middle}} = \\pi \\times (6)^2 = 36\\pi\n     \\]\n   - **Circle with radius 4 (Smallest Circle):** \n     \\[\n     A_{\\text{smallest}} = \\pi \\times (4)^2 = 16\\pi\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Areas of Regions \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\):**\n   - **Region"
