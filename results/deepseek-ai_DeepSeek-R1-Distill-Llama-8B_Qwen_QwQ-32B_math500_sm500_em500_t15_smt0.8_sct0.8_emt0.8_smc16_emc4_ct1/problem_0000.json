            "output": "Okay, I have this problem about polynomials, and I need to figure out how to solve it step by step. Let me try to unpack the problem first.\n\nSo, the problem says: Let P(x) be a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so P(x) looks like x³ + ax² + bx + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find.\n\nIt also says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), it has a remainder R(x). And when it's divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Additionally, we know that P(0) = 5. We need to find P(5).\n\nAlright, so my plan is to use the Remainder Theorem or Polynomial Remainder Theorem because when you divide by a polynomial, the remainder has a degree less than the divisor. Here, the divisors are quadratic, so the remainders should be linear, meaning they are of the form mx + n.\n\nSo, let me denote the remainders:\n\n1. When P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). So, R(x) is linear, say R(x) = rx + s.\n\n2. When P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). So, that would also be linear because 2R(x) is just scaling R(x) by 2, so 2rx + 2s.\n\nNow, since P(x) is a cubic polynomial, let me write it as:\n\nP(x) = (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x)\n\nSimilarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), we can write:\n\nP(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x)\n\nWhere Q1(x) and Q2(x) are the quotients, which are polynomials of degree 1 each because P(x) is degree 3 and we're dividing by degree 2.\n\nBut maybe instead of dealing with Q1 and Q2, I can use the Remainder Theorem more directly.\n\nFrom the first division, since the divisor"

P(1) = R(1) = r*1 + s = r + s\n\n2. P(4) = R(4) = r*4 + s = 4r + s\n\n3. P(2) = 2R(2) = 2*(2r + s) = 4r + 2s\n\n4. P(3) = 2R(3) = 2*(3r + s) = 6r + 2s\n\nAlso, since P(x) is a cubic monic polynomial, let me write it as:\n\nP(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + c\n\nWe also know that P(0) = 5, so plugging in x = 0:\n\nP(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + c = c = 5. So c = 5.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = x³ + ax² + bx + 5.\n\nNow, I can write equations for P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4) using this expression.\n\nLet me compute each of these:\n\nP(1) = 1 + a + b + 5 = (1 + a + b + 5) = a + b + 6\n\nSimilarly,\n\nP(2) = 8 + 4a + 2b + 5 = 4a + 2b + 13\n\nP(3) = 27 + 9a + 3b + 5 = 9a + 3b + 32\n\nP(4) = 64 + 16a + 4b + 5 = 16a + 4b + 69\n\nNow, according to the earlier equations:\n\n1.
