            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem about polynomials, and I need to find P(5) given some conditions. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that P(x) is a monic polynomial of degree 3. Monic means that the leading coefficient is 1, so it looks like x³ + something x² + something x + constant. Cool, so I know the general form of P(x) is x³ + a x² + b x + c, where a, b, c are constants I need to find or relate somehow.\n\nNext, it says that when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x). Similarly, when P(x) is divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x). Hmm, okay. So let me recall the Remainder Theorem. When you divide a polynomial P(x) by a quadratic polynomial like (x - m)(x - n), the remainder will be a linear polynomial, right? So R(x) must be of the form r1 x + r0.\n\nSo, when P(x) is divided by (x - 1)(x - 4), the remainder is R(x) = r1 x + r0. Similarly, when divided by (x - 2)(x - 3), the remainder is 2R(x) = 2r1 x + 2r0.\n\nNow, since both divisions leave remainders related to R(x), maybe I can express P(x) in terms of these divisors and remainders. Like, P(x) can be written as (x - 1)(x - 4)Q1(x) + R(x), and also as (x - 2)(x - 3)Q2(x) + 2R(x), where Q1 and Q2 are the quotient polynomials.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's useful yet. Maybe I can use the fact that P(1) and P(4) will give me information about R(x). Because when I plug in x=1 into P(x), the term with (x - 1) will vanish, leaving just R(1). Similarly, P(4) will give R(4).\n\nSame thing for the other divisor: plugging in x=2 and x=3 into"

Since R(x) is linear, let me denote R(x) = ax + b. Then R(1) = a + b, R(4) = 4a + b, R(2) = 2a + b, R(3) = 3a + b.\n\nTherefore, substituting into the equations above:\n\n1. P(1) = a + b\n2.

But I also know that P(x) is a cubic polynomial. Since it's monic, let me write P(x) = x³ + c x² + d x + e. Wait, actually, the problem says monic, so leading coefficient is 1, so yes, that's correct. Wait, the problem also says P(0) = 5, so the constant term e is 5. So P(0) = 0 + 0 + 0 + e = e = 5. So e = 5. So P(x) = x³ + a x² + b x + 5. Wait, but I already used a and b for R(x). Hmm, maybe I should use different letters for the coefficients of P(x). Let me correct that.\n\nLet me denote P(x) = x³ + p x² + q x + r. Since it's monic, the leading coefficient is 1. Then, given that P(0) = 5, so r = 5. So P(x) = x³ + p x² + q x + 5.\n\nSo now, I can write equations for P(1), P"

P(3) =2*(3m +n).\n\nWait, but P(x) is a cubic, so in principle, four points should determine it, but in this case, the points are related through R(x). So maybe instead, express P(x) as R(x) plus multiples of (x -1)(x -4) and (x -2)(x -3).\n\nAlternatively, think of P(x) = R(x) + (x -1)(x -4)A(x) + (x -2)(x -3)B(x), but since P(x) is cubic, A(x) and B(x) must be constants, because (x -1)(x -4) and (x -2)(x -3) are quadratic. So P(x) = R(x) + a(x -1)(x -4) + b(x -2)(x -3), where a and b are constants.\n\nYes, this seems promising.\n\nSo, let me write P(x) = R(x) + a(x -1)(x -4) + b(x -2)(x -3).\n\nSince R(x) is linear, and a(x-...)(x-...) are quadratics, the total degree is 3, so this makes sense.\n\nSo, P(x) = (m x + n) + a(x² -5x +4) + b(x² -5x +6).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nP(x) = [m x + n] + a x² -5"

Wait, that's a problem. Wait, because I assumed P(x) is expressed as R(x) plus two quadratics multiplied by constants, so the highest degree would be x², but P(x) is a cubic. So my mistake here is that I need to include a cubic term. Since P(x) is cubic, and the other terms are quadratic, the coefficients a and b must be linear terms? Wait, no, perhaps I need to include a cubic term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write P(x) as:\n\nP(x) = (x -1)(x -4)(x - c) + R(x), but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression I had before is missing the cubic term. Since P(x) is cubic, and R(x) is linear, then the other terms must include a cubic term. So perhaps I need to write P(x) = (x -1)(x -4)(x - k) + R(x), but then when divided by (x -1)(x -4), the remainder is R(x). But then when divided by (x -2)(x -3), the remainder would be P(2) and P(3), but that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial approach was better, even though it involved fractions. Since I already found P(5)=15, and verified it, maybe that's the answer. But let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, since P"
