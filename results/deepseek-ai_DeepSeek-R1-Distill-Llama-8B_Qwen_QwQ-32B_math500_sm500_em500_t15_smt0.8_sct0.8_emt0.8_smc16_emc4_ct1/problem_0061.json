            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here about bus riders in different grades at Central High School. They surveyed 300 males and 300 females in each grade, and the table shows the percentage of bus riders for each grade. The question is asking, for which grade is the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the numbers represent. Each grade, like 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, has 300 males and 300 females surveyed. The percentages given (like 41.1% for males in 9th grade) must represent how many of those students use the bus. So, for each grade, I can calculate the actual number of male and female bus riders by applying these percentages to the total number surveyed.\n\nWait, but actually, since it's a percentage, I can use the formula: Number of bus riders = (Percentage / 100) * Total surveyed. Since the total surveyed for each grade is 300 for males and 300 for females, right? So, for each grade, I can compute:\n\n- Male bus riders = (Percentage of males / 100) * 300\n- Female bus riders = (Percentage of females / 100) * 300\n\nThen, the question is about when the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. So, essentially, I need to find the grade where:\n\nNumber of male bus riders = 135% * Number of female bus riders.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of ratios or proportions, but the 135% part suggests that male riders are more than female riders by a certain percentage.\n\nSince I need to compute actual numbers, let me create a plan:\n\n1. For each grade, compute the number of male bus riders and female bus riders using the given percentages.\n2. For each grade, calculate 135% of the number of female bus riders.\n3. Find out which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to that 135% of female bus riders.\n\nThat makes sense. So, let me start with the first grade, 9th grade.\n\nFor 9th grade:\n- Male percentage = 41.1%\n- Female percentage = 39.4%\nSo, number of male bus riders = 41.1% *"

Let me do it properly:\n\n0.411 * 300 = (0.4 * 300) + (0.011 * 300) = 120 + 3.3 = 123.3. Okay.\n\nFemale bus riders: 39.4% of 300. Let's see, 0.394 * 300. 0.3*300=90, 0.09*300=27, 0.004*300=1.2. So adding those: 90 +27=117, plus 1.2 is 118.2. So 118.2 female bus riders.\n\nNow, 135% of female bus riders would be 1.35 * 118.2. Let me compute that. 1.35 * 100 is 135, so 1.35 * 118.2. Let's break it down:\n\n1.35 * 100 = 135\n\n1.35 * 18.2 = ?\n\nWait, maybe better to do 118.2 * 1.35:\n\nFirst, 100 *1.35 = 135\n\n18.2 *1.35: 10*1.35=13.5, 8.2*1.35=11.07, so total 13.5+11.07=24.57. So total 135 +24.57=159.57.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, actually, 118.2 *1.35:\n\nAlternatively, 118.2 *1 = "

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 135% of female bus riders is 159.57.\n\nCompare that to male bus riders which is 123.3. So, 123.3 is less than 159.57. The difference is 159.57 -123.3 =36.27. So, in 9th grade, the male bus riders are 36.27 less than 135% of female bus riders.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's move to 10th grade.\n\n10th grade:\n\nMale percentage = 34.4%\n\nFemale percentage = 33.1%\n\nCompute number of male bus riders: 0.344*300=103.2\n\nFemale bus riders: 0.331*300=99.3\n\nSo, 135% of female bus riders: 1.35*99.3.\n\nLet's compute that. 100*1.35=135, so 99.3 is 0.7 less than 100, so 135 - (0.7*1.35)=135 -0.945=134.055.\n\nSo, 1.35*99.3=134.055.\n\nCompare to male bus riders which is 103.2. So, 103.2 versus 134.055. Difference is 134.055 -103.2=30.855.\n\nSo in 10th grade, the difference is about 30.86.\n\nSo, 9th grade difference was about 36.27, 10th grade is about 30.86. Hmm, getting closer.\n\nWait, maybe 11th grade will be even closer?\n\n11th grade:\n\nMale percentage = 20.6%\n\nFemale percentage =13.8%\n\nSo, male bus riders: 0.206*300=61.8\n\nFemale bus riders:0.138*300=41.4\n\n135% of female bus riders:1.35*41.4.\n\nCalculate that. 40*1.35=54, 1.4*1.35=1.89, so total 54+1.89=55.89.\n\nSo, male bus riders"

So, 11th grade, the male bus riders are only about 5.91 above 135% of female riders.\n\nHmm, okay, 12th grade:\n\nMale percentage=11.6%, female=8.6%\n\nCompute male bus riders:0.116*300=34.8\n\nFemale bus riders:0.086*300=25.8\n\n135% of female bus riders:1.35*25.8=34.77.\n\nSo, male bus riders are 34.8, which is very close to 34.77.\n\nDifference is 34.8 -34.77=0.03.\n\nWow, that's really close. So, in 12th grade, the number of male bus riders is 34.8, and 135% of female is 34.77. So, only a difference of 0.03.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nFor each grade:\n\n- 9th: male=123.3, female=118.2, 135% female=159.57, difference=36.27\n- 10th: male=103.2, female=99.3, 135% female=134.055, difference=30.855\n- 11th: male=61.8, female=41.4, 135% female=55.89, difference=5.91\n- 12th: male=34.8, female=25.8, 135% female=34.77, difference=0.03\n\nSo, the differences are 36.27, 30.855, 5.91, and 0.03. Looking at these, 12th grade has the smallest difference, only 0.03, which is almost negligible. Then 11th grade is next, with a difference of about 5.91, then 10th, then 9th.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for which grade is the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. So, the closest one would be the one with the smallest difference.\n\nSo, 12th grade has the smallest difference,"
