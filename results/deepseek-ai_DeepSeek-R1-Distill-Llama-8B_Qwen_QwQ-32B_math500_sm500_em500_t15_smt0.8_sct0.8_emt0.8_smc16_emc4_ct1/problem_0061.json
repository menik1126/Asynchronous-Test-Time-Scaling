            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about Central H.S. students' bus riders surveyed by gender and grade. The question is asking which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have four grades: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. For each grade, we have the percentage of males and females who are bus riders. So, for example, in 9th grade, 41.1% of males are bus riders, and 39.4% of females are bus riders. The survey included 300 males and 300 females in each grade, so each grade has a total of 600 students surveyed.\n\nThe question is asking for the grade where the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. That means, for each grade, I need to calculate the number of male bus riders, the number of female bus riders, and then see what percentage the male number is of the female number. Or, more specifically, whether the male number is 135% of the female number.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should calculate the ratio of males to females and see which grade is closest to 1.35 (since 135% is 1.35 times). Alternatively, I can compute the percentage and see which is closest to 135%. Maybe both approaches work, but let's think through it step by step.\n\nLet me consider each grade one by one.\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n- Males: 41.1%\n- Females: 39.4%\n\nSo, the number of males is 41.1% of 300, which is 0.411 * 300 = let's calculate that. 0.411 * 300: 0.4 * 300 = 120, 0.011 * 300 = 3.3, so total 123.3 males.\n\nFemales: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300. 0.3 * 300 = 90, 0.09 * 300 = 27, 0.004 * 300 = 1.2. So 90 + 27 + 1.2 = 118.2 females"

            "output": ".\n\nWait, wait, that's not correct. 39.4% is 39.4 per 100, so 0.394 in decimal. So 0.394 * 300 is just 0.394 * 300. Let me compute that:\n\n300 * 0.394: 300 * 0.3 = 90, 300 * 0.09 = 27, 300 * 0.004 = 1.2. So 90 + 27 = 117, plus 1.2 is 118.2. So, females: 118.2.\n\nMales: 123.3.\n\nSo, the number of male bus riders is 123.3, and females are 118.2.\n\nNow, to find how many times more males are than females, we can compute 123.3 / 118.2. Let me compute that.\n\n123.3 divided by 118.2. Let me approximate this:\n\n118.2 goes into 123.3 once, with some remainder. So, 118.2 * 1 = 118.2. 123.3 - 118.2 = 5.1. So, 5.1 / 118.2 ≈ 0.0431.\n\nSo, approximately 1.0431, which is about 1.043 times.\n\nSo, the ratio is about 1.043, which is 104.3%. The problem says we need the number of male bus riders to be closest to 135% of females. So 135% would be 1.35 times. 1.043 is much lower than 1.35, so 9th grade isn't the one.\n\nNext, 10th grade:\n- Males: 34.4%\n- Females: 33.1%\n\nCalculate males: 34.4% of 300. 0.344 * 300. Let me compute that: 0.3*300=90, 0.04*300=12, 0.004*300=1.2. So 90 +12=102, +1.2=103.2 males.\n\nFemales: 33.1% of 300 = 0.331 * 300. 0.3*300=90, 0.03*300=9, 0.001*300="

So, 103.2 is about 1.033 times, or 103.3%.\n\nStill less than 135%.\n\nMoving on to 11th grade:\n- Males: 20.6%\n- Females: 13.8%\n\nCalculate males: 20.6% of 300 = 0.206 * 300. 0.2*300=60, 0.006*300=1.8, so total 61.8.\n\nFemales: 13.8% of 300 = 0.138 * 300. 0.1*300=30, 0.03*300=9, 0.008*300=2.4.

So, 149.5% is approximately 150%, which is way higher than 135%.\n\nWait, 135% is less than 150%.

So total 3.726 +0.207=3.933.\n\nSo adding up: 41.4 +16.56=57.96, plus 3.933=61.893, which is approximately 61.893, which is a bit more than 61.8. So the ratio is about 1.495, which is 149.5%.\n\nSo that's actually higher than 135%, so not the one. So, 11th grade is further away.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 41.4 * 1.495: 41.4*1=41.4, 41.4*0.4=16.56, 41.4*0.095= as above 3.933, so total 41.4 +16.56 +3.933=61.893, which is about 61.893, which is greater than 61.8 by 0.093. So, perhaps 61.8 /41.4 = 1.495 approximately.\n\nWait, so 1.495 is roughly 1.5, which is 150%, so 11th grade is at 150%, which is 15% higher than 135%. So 11th grade is over 150%, so not exactly 135%, but maybe not the closest.

So that's perfect, but let me check.\n\nWait, 25.8 *1.35: 25.8*1=25.8, 25.8*0.35=9.03, so total 34.83, which is very close to 34.8. So 34.8 /25.8 =34.8 ÷25.8=1.35.\n\nSo, exactly 135%, which is 1.35 times. So that's spot on.\n\nWait, so which grade is closest to 135%? It's 12th grade, exactly 135%. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me just recap for each grade:\n\n9th: ~104.3% (males to females)\n10th: ~103.3%\n11th: ~149.5%\n12th: 135%\n\nSo, the 12th grade is exactly 135%, which is the target. Therefore, the answer is 12th grade.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in 11th grade.\n\nWait, so 11th grade males are 20.6%, so 0.206*300=61.8. Females are 13.8%, so 0.138*300=41.4. 61.8 /41.4=1.495, which is 149.5% males, which is 14.5% higher than 135%, so it's closer to 150% than 135%.\n\nBut 12th grade is exactly 135%, which is as close as it gets. So 12th grade is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to compute the ratio of male to female and see which is closest to 1.35.\n\nWait, but for thoroughness, let me check the other grades again.\n\n9th: male is 123.3, female is 118.2, so 123.3/118.2=1.0431, which is approximately 104.3% of female.

So the answer is 12th grade.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the number of its male bus riders closest to 135% of the number of its female bus riders\". So, the ratio of male to female is 135%, so exactly 1.35. Since 12th grade is exactly that, that's the answer. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 12th grade calculation again. 11.6% of 300 males: 0.116*300. 0.1*300=30, 0.016*300=4.8, so total 34.8. Females:8.6% of 300 is 0.086*300. 0.08*300=24, 0.006*300=1.8, so 24+1.8=25.8. 34.8 divided by 25.8 is indeed 1.35. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12th grade. So the box should be \\boxed{12^{\\text{th}} grade}\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other grade that might be closer. For example, maybe 11th grade is 149.5%, which is 14.5% over, and 12th is exactly on. So 12th is better. The next closest would be 11th, but it's 14.5% away, while 12th is 0. So yeah, 12th is the"
