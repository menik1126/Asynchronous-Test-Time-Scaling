            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where z is given as 1 + i, and w is equal to (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). I need to find the modulus of w, which is |w|. Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for complex numbers, the modulus is like the distance from the origin on the complex plane. So, for a complex number a + bi, the modulus |a + bi| is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, looking at w, it's a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are complex expressions involving z. Since z is also a complex number, I probably need to substitute z = 1 + i into both the numerator and the denominator before I can find w. Then, once I have w, I can compute its modulus.\n\nAlright, let me write down z first: z = 1 + i.\n\nSo, let's compute the numerator first: 3z + 1. Since z is 1 + i, multiplying by 3 would be 3*(1 + i) = 3*1 + 3*i = 3 + 3i. Then, adding 1 gives 3 + 3i + 1, which is 4 + 3i. So, the numerator is 4 + 3i.\n\nNext, the denominator: 5z + 7. Again, z is 1 + i, so 5*(1 + i) = 5*1 + 5*i = 5 + 5i. Adding 7 gives 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i. Therefore, the denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nSo, now w is (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). Hmm, dividing complex numbers can be tricky, but I remember that to simplify this, I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i because I just change the sign of the imaginary part.\n\nLet me write that down: w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i) * (12 - 5i)/(12 - 5i). This way, the denominator becomes a real number, which is easier to handle"

I can use the distributive property (FOIL) here.\n\nFirst, 4*12 = 48.\n\nThen, 4*(-5i) = -20i.\n\nNext, 3i*12 = 36i.\n\nLastly, 3i*(-5i) = -15i\u00b2. Wait, but i\u00b2 is -1, so this becomes -15*(-1) = 15.\n\nNow, adding all these together: 48 - 20i + 36i + 15. Let's combine like terms. The real parts are 48 and 15, so 48 + 15 = 63. The imaginary parts are -20i and 36i, which add up to 16i. So, the numerator becomes 63 + 16i.\n\nNow, the denominator: (12 + 5i)*(12 - 5i). This is a difference of squares, so it's 12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2. 12\u00b2 is 144, and (5i)\u00b2 is 25i\u00b2, which is 25*(-1) = -25. So, denominator is 144 - (-25) = 144 + 25 = 169.\n\nSo, after simplifying, w = (63 + 16i)/169. Since both the numerator and denominator are real numbers now, w can be expressed as a complex number in the form a + bi. Here, a is 63/169 and b is 16/169.\n\nNow, to find the modulus of w, which is |w|. As I remembered earlier, for a complex number a + bi, the modulus is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, plugging in the values:\n\n|w| = sqrt( (63/169)\u00b2 + (16/169)\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, (63/169)\u00b2: 63 squared is 3969, and 169 squared is 28561. So, that term is 3969/28561.\n\nSecond, (16/169)\u00b2: 16 squared is 256, so that term is 256/28561.\n\nAdding these together: (3969 + 256)/28561 = 4225/28561.\n\nNow, sqrt(4225/28561). The"

            "output": " square root of 4225 is... Hmm, 4225 divided by 25 is 169, so sqrt(4225) is 65. Similarly, sqrt(28561) is 169 because 169 squared is 28561.\n\nSo, sqrt(4225/28561) = 65/169.\n\nWait, can this fraction be simplified? Let me check. 65 and 169. 65 is 5*13, and 169 is 13\u00b2. So, we have a common factor of 13.\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 13: 65 \u00f713 = 5, 169 \u00f713 = 13.\n\nSo, |w| simplifies to 5/13.\n\nWait, hold on, 65/169 reduces to 5/13 because 65 divided by 13 is 5, and 169 divided by 13 is 13. So yes, |w| is 5/13.\n\nBut let me double-check each step because sometimes when doing complex number operations, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 3z +1: z is 1 + i, so 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i, then +1 makes it 4 + 3i. That seems right.\n\nDenominator: 5z +7, which is 5*(1+i) = 5 + 5i, plus 7 is 12 +5i. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate 12 -5i.\n\nNumerator:\n\n(4 +3i)(12 -5i):\n\nFirst, 4*12 = 48\n\n4*(-5i) = -20i\n\n3i*12 = 36i\n\n3i*(-5i) = -15i\u00b2 = +15 because i\u00b2 is -1.\n\nAdding: 48 +15 =63, -20i +36i =16i. So numerator is 63 +16i. Correct.\n\nDenominator:\n\n(12 +5i)(12 -5i)=12\u00b2 - (5i)^2=144 -25i\u00b2=144+25=169. Correct.\n\nThus, w= (63 +16i)/169.

Let's see if it gives the same result.\n\nCompute |numerator| = |4 +3i| = sqrt(4\u00b2 +3\u00b2)=5\n\nCompute |denominator|=|12 +5i|=sqrt(12\u00b2 +5\u00b2)=13\n\nThen, |w|=|numerator| / |denominator|=5/13.\n\nWhoa! That's a much quicker method. I didn't think about that initially.\n\nBut both methods lead to the same result, 5/13. So that's reassuring.\n\nSo, I think I got it right.
