Hmm, okay, so I know that for a square root function, the expression inside the square root, which is the radicand, must be greater than or equal to zero because you can't have a negative number under a square root in the realm of real numbers. That makes sense.\n\nFirst, I should probably simplify the expression inside the square root. Let me write it out: (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Hmm, that looks like a difference of squares. Remember, the difference of squares formula is a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). So, maybe I can apply that here to simplify the expression.\n\nLet me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 8). Then, the expression becomes a^2 - b^2, which factors into (a - b)(a + b). So, substituting back in, that would be ( (x - 3) - (x - 8) ) multiplied by ( (x - 3) + (x - 8) ). Let me compute each part separately to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst part: (x - 3) - (x - 8). Distribute the negative sign: x - 3 - x + 8. The x terms cancel out: x - x is 0, and then -3 + 8 is 5. So, the first part is 5.\n\nSecond part: (x - 3) + (x - 8). That's straightforward: x + x is 2x, and -3 - 8 is -11. So, the second part is 2x - 11.\n\nPutting it together, the expression inside the square root simplifies to (5)(2x - 11). So, g(x) = sqrt[5(2x - 11)]. Since we have a square root, the radicand must be \u2265 0. So, 5(2x - 11) \u2265 0.\n\nNow, 5 is a positive constant, so the inequality simplifies to 2x - 11 \u2265 0."

            "output": " Solving for x: 2x \u2265 11 => x \u2265 11/2, which is 5.5 or 5.5. So, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x such that x is greater than or equal to 11/2.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the smallest real number x in the domain. Since x must be \u2265 11/2, the smallest x is 11/2. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nStarting from the original expression: (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. Let me compute this without simplifying first to double-check. Let's expand both squares.\n\nFirst, (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9.\n\nSecond, (x - 8)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64.\n\nSo, subtracting the second from the first: (x^2 -6x +9) - (x^2 -16x +64) = x^2 -6x +9 -x^2 +16x -64.\n\nSimplify term by term: x^2 - x^2 cancels out, -6x +16x is 10x, and 9 -64 is -55. So, the expression inside the square root is 10x - 55. Wait, that's 10x - 55. Hmm, earlier I simplified it to 5*(2x - 11). Let me see: 10x -55 factors into 5*(2x -11). So, that's the same as before. So, my earlier steps are correct.\n\nSo, the radicand is 10x -55, which must be \u2265 0. So, 10x -55 \u2265 0 => 10x \u226555 => x \u226555/10 => x\u22655.5. So, same result. Therefore, the domain is x\u22655.5, and the smallest x is 5.5.\n\nBut wait, I think maybe I made a mistake in the sign when subtracting the squares. Let me go back. The original expression is (x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2. I expanded both as (x^2 -6x +9) - (x^2 -16x +64). When"

So, same as before.\n\nSo, yeah, the radicand is 10x -55, which is \u22650, so x\u22655.5. So, the smallest real number x in the domain is 5.5. I can express that as a fraction, which is 11/2, or as a decimal, 5.5.\n\nLet me just think again: is there any other condition I might have missed? The function is defined as sqrt[...], so only the radicand must be non-negative. I don't see any other constraints, like denominators or anything, so yes, that's the only condition.\n\nSo, the smallest x is 11/2, which is 5.5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2} \\), we first simplify the expression inside the square root.\n\nUsing the difference of squares formula:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 = [(x - 3) - (x - 8)][(x - 3) + (x - 8)]\n\\]\nSimplifying each term:\n\\[\n(x - 3) - (x - 8) = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (x - 3) + (x - 8) = 2x - 11\n\\]\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\\[\n5(2x - 11)\n\\]\nFor \\( g(x) \\) to be real, the radicand must be non-negative:\n\\[\n5(2x - 11) \\geq 0 \\implies 2x - 11 \\geq 0 \\implies x \\geq \\frac{11}{2}\n\\]\nThe smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain is \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n\n**Answer:** The smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{2}}."
