            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression to simplify into a fraction: \u221a[(5/\u221a80 + \u221a845/9 + \u221a45)/\u221a5]. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it step by step. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify each square root in the numerator and the denominator. Starting with \u221a80. I know that 80 can be broken down into 16 * 5, and 16 is a perfect square. So, \u221a80 = \u221a(16*5) = \u221a16 * \u221a5 = 4\u221a5. That takes care of the first term in the numerator: 5/\u221a80 becomes 5/(4\u221a5).\n\nWait, but 5/(4\u221a5) can be rationalized, right? If I multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a5, that should get rid of the square root in the denominator. So, 5/(4\u221a5) * \u221a5/\u221a5 = (5\u221a5)/(4*5) = \u221a5/4. Oh, that's simpler.\n\nNext, I have \u221a845. Hmm, 845, let me see if that has any square factors. 845 divided by 5 is 169, and 169 is 13 squared. So, 845 = 5 * 13\u00b2. Therefore, \u221a845 = \u221a(5*13\u00b2) = 13\u221a5. Okay, so the second term in the numerator is \u221a845/9, which is (13\u221a5)/9.\n\nLastly, \u221a45. 45 is 9*5, and 9 is a perfect square. So, \u221a45 = \u221a(9*5) = 3\u221a5. That means the third term in the numerator is 3\u221a5.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the entire numerator with these simplified forms:\n\nNumerator: \u221a5/4 + (13\u221a5)/9 + 3\u221a5.\n\nHmm, so all these terms have a \u221a5 in them. Maybe I can factor that out to make it easier. Let's factor \u221a5:\n\nNumerator: \u221a5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nNow, I need to compute the sum inside the parentheses. Let's find a common denominator for 1/4, 13/9, and 3.\n\nThe denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (for the"

So, 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator becomes \u221a5 * (169/36) = (169\u221a5)/36.\n\nSo now, the entire expression is the square root of that numerator divided by \u221a5:\n\n\u221a[(169\u221a5)/36] / \u221a5.\n\nLet me simplify this step by step. First, let's take the square root of the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\n\u221a[(169\u221a5)/36] = \u221a169 / \u221a36 * \u221a(\u221a5) = 13/6 * (5)^(1/4).\n\nWait, hold on. 169 is 13 squared, and 36 is 6 squared. So, \u221a169 = 13, \u221a36 = 6. But then we have \u221a(\u221a5), which is the fourth root of 5. Hmm, that might complicate things. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression under the square root as:\n\n(169\u221a5)/36 = (169/36) * \u221a5.\n\nThen, \u221a[(169/36) * \u221a5] = \u221a(169/36) * \u221a(\u221a5) = (13/6) * (5)^(1/4).\n\nHmm, but that still leaves me with a fourth root. Maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe instead of breaking it down that way, I can express \u221a(\u221a5) as 5^(1/4), yes. But is there a way to combine these terms differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have simplified the entire numerator first before dealing with the denominator.\n\nWait, the expression is \u221a[(169\u221a5)/36] / \u221a5.\n\nWhich is the same as \u221a[(169\u221a5)/36] * 1/\u221a5.\n\nSo, \u221a(169\u221a5)/\u221a36 * 1/\u221a5.\n\nWait, \u221a(169\u221a5) is \u221a169 * \u221a(\u221a5) = 13 * 5^(1/4).\n\n\u221a36 is 6. So, that gives 13 * 5^(1/4)"

Maybe I made a mistake in the numerator?\n\nWait, let me go back to the numerator calculation again. Let me check each step again.\n\nOriginal numerator terms after simplifying each term:\n\nFirst term: 5/\u221a80 became \u221a5/4. That's correct because 5/(4\u221a5) rationalized is \u221a5/4.\n\nSecond term: \u221a845 is 13\u221a5, so divided by 9 gives (13\u221a5)/9. That's correct.\n\nThird term: \u221a45 is 3\u221a5. Correct.\n\nSo adding them: \u221a5/4 + 13\u221a5/9 + 3\u221a5.\n\nYes, so factoring out \u221a5 gives \u221a5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Let me check the fractions again.\n\n1/4 is 0.25, 13/9 is approximately 1.444..., and 3 is 3. Adding them: 0.25 + 1.444 + 3 \u2248 4.694. Let me see if 169/36 is that. 169 divided by 36 is approximately 4.694, so that's correct.\n\nSo numerator is (169\u221a5)/36. Then the entire expression is sqrt of that over sqrt5.\n\nWait, the original expression is sqrt of [ (numerator) / sqrt5 ].\n\nWait, hold on! Wait a second, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is sqrt [ ( (5/sqrt80) + (sqrt845)/9 + sqrt45 ) / sqrt5 ]\n\nAh! Oh no, I think I misread the denominator. The entire numerator (the sum of those three terms) is divided by sqrt5, and then we take the square root of that whole thing. So my mistake"

I think I messed up earlier by not simplifying the division by sqrt5 properly.\n\nSo, let me recap:\n\nAfter simplifying the numerator terms, the numerator of the big fraction is (169 sqrt5)/36. Then, dividing that by sqrt5 gives (169 sqrt5)/36 divided by sqrt5 = 169/36. Then taking the square root of that gives sqrt(169/36) = 13/6. So the final answer is 13/6.\n\nWait, that makes sense now. I think my mistake earlier was that I thought the sqrt5 was still in there, but actually, when you divide by sqrt5, it cancels the sqrt5 in the numerator. So that's why it simplifies to 169/36, whose square root is 13/6. That seems right.\n\nLet me verify each step again to be sure.\n\nFirst term: 5/sqrt80. sqrt80 is 4sqrt5, so 5/(4sqrt5). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt5: (5 sqrt5)/(4*5) = sqrt5/4. Correct.\n\nSecond term: sqrt845. 845 divided by 169 is 5, so sqrt(13\u00b2 *5) =13sqrt5. Divided by 9 gives 13sqrt5/9. Correct.\n\nThird term: sqrt45 is 3sqrt5. Correct.\n\nAdding them: sqrt5/4 +13sqrt5/9 +3sqrt5. Factor sqrt5:\n\nsqrt5*(1/4 +13/9 +3). Converting to 36 denominator:\n\n1/4 =9/36, 13/9=52/36, 3=108/36.
