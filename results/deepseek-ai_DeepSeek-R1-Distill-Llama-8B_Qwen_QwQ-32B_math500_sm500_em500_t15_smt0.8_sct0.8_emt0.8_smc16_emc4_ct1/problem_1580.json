Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to simplify each square root in the numerator and the denominator. Starting with √80. I know that 80 can be broken down into 16 * 5, and 16 is a perfect square. So, √80 = √(16*5) = √16 * √5 = 4√5. That takes care of the first term in the numerator: 5/√80 becomes 5/(4√5).\n\nWait, but 5/(4√5) can be rationalized, right? If I multiply numerator and denominator by √5, that should get rid of the square root in the denominator. So, 5/(4√5) * √5/√5 = (5√5)/(4*5) = √5/4. Oh, that's simpler.\n\nNext, I have √845. Hmm, 845, let me see if that has any square factors. 845 divided by 5 is 169, and 169 is 13 squared. So, 845 = 5 * 13². Therefore, √845 = √(5*13²) = 13√5. Okay, so the second term in the numerator is √845/9, which is (13√5)/9.\n\nLastly, √45. 45 is 9*5, and 9 is a perfect square. So, √45 = √(9*5) = 3√5. That means the third term in the numerator is 3√5.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the entire numerator with these simplified forms:\n\nNumerator: √5/4 + (13√5)/9 + 3√5.\n\nHmm, so all these terms have a √5 in them. Maybe I can factor that out to make it easier. Let's factor √5:\n\nNumerator: √5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3).\n\nNow, I need to compute the sum inside the parentheses. Let's find a common denominator for 1/4, 13/9, and 3.\n\nThe denominators are 4, 9, and 1 (for the"

So, 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator becomes √5 * (169/36) = (169√5)/36.\n\nSo now, the entire expression is the square root of that numerator divided by √5:\n\n√[(169√5)/36] / √5.\n\nLet me simplify this step by step. First, let's take the square root of the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\n√[(169√5)/36] = √169 / √36 * √(√5) = 13/6 * (5)^(1/4).\n\nWait, hold on. 169 is 13 squared, and 36 is 6 squared. So, √169 = 13, √36 = 6. But then we have √(√5), which is the fourth root of 5. Hmm, that might complicate things. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression under the square root as:\n\n(169√5)/36 = (169/36) * √5.\n\nThen, √[(169/36) * √5] = √(169/36) * √(√5) = (13/6) * (5)^(1/4).\n\nHmm, but that still leaves me with a fourth root. Maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe instead of breaking it down that way, I can express √(√5) as 5^(1/4), yes. But is there a way to combine these terms differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have simplified the entire numerator first before dealing with the denominator.\n\nWait, the expression is √[(169√5)/36] / √5.\n\nWhich is the same as √[(169√5)/36] * 1/√5.\n\nSo, √(169√5)/√36 * 1/√5.\n\nWait, √(169√5) is √169 * √(√5) = 13 * 5^(1/4).\n\n√36 is 6. So, that gives 13 * 5^(1/4)"

Maybe I made a mistake in the numerator?\n\nWait, let me go back to the numerator calculation again. Let me check each step again.\n\nOriginal numerator terms after simplifying each term:\n\nFirst term: 5/√80 became √5/4. That's correct because 5/(4√5) rationalized is √5/4.\n\nSecond term: √845 is 13√5, so divided by 9 gives (13√5)/9. That's correct.\n\nThird term: √45 is 3√5. Correct.\n\nSo adding them: √5/4 + 13√5/9 + 3√5.\n\nYes, so factoring out √5 gives √5*(1/4 + 13/9 + 3). Let me check the fractions again.\n\n1/4 is 0.25, 13/9 is approximately 1.444..., and 3 is 3. Adding them: 0.25 + 1.444 + 3 ≈ 4.694. Let me see if 169/36 is that. 169 divided by 36 is approximately 4.694, so that's correct.\n\nSo numerator is (169√5)/36. Then the entire expression is sqrt of that over sqrt5.\n\nWait, the original expression is sqrt of [ (numerator) / sqrt5 ].\n\nWait, hold on! Wait a second, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is sqrt [ ( (5/sqrt80) + (sqrt845)/9 + sqrt45 ) / sqrt5 ]\n\nAh! Oh no, I think I misread the denominator. The entire numerator (the sum of those three terms) is divided by sqrt5, and then we take the square root of that whole thing. So my mistake"

I think I messed up earlier by not simplifying the division by sqrt5 properly.\n\nSo, let me recap:\n\nAfter simplifying the numerator terms, the numerator of the big fraction is (169 sqrt5)/36. Then, dividing that by sqrt5 gives (169 sqrt5)/36 divided by sqrt5 = 169/36. Then taking the square root of that gives sqrt(169/36) = 13/6. So the final answer is 13/6.\n\nWait, that makes sense now. I think my mistake earlier was that I thought the sqrt5 was still in there, but actually, when you divide by sqrt5, it cancels the sqrt5 in the numerator. So that's why it simplifies to 169/36, whose square root is 13/6. That seems right.\n\nLet me verify each step again to be sure.\n\nFirst term: 5/sqrt80. sqrt80 is 4sqrt5, so 5/(4sqrt5). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt5: (5 sqrt5)/(4*5) = sqrt5/4. Correct.\n\nSecond term: sqrt845. 845 divided by 169 is 5, so sqrt(13² *5) =13sqrt5. Divided by 9 gives 13sqrt5/9. Correct.\n\nThird term: sqrt45 is 3sqrt5. Correct.\n\nAdding them: sqrt5/4 +13sqrt5/9 +3sqrt5. Factor sqrt5:\n\nsqrt5*(1/4 +13/9 +3). Converting to 36 denominator:\n\n1/4 =9/36, 13/9=52/36, 3=108/36.
