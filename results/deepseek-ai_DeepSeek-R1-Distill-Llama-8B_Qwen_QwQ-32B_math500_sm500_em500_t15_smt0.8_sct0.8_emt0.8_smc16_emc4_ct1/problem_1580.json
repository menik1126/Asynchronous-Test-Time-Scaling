            "output": "Okay, so I have this expression I need to simplify into a fraction. Let me write it down first to make sure I understand it correctly:\n\n√[( (5 / √80) + (√845 / 9) + √45 ) / √5]\n\nWow, that looks complicated, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense. Let me start by simplifying each part individually.\n\nStarting with the numerator inside the square root: 5 / √80. Hmm, I remember that to simplify fractions with square roots in the denominator, I can rationalize the denominator. So, √80 can be simplified, right? Let me factor 80 to see what's inside. 80 is 16 times 5, and 16 is a perfect square. So, √80 = √(16*5) = √16 * √5 = 4√5. That means 5 / √80 is the same as 5 / (4√5). Now, I can rationalize this by multiplying numerator and denominator by √5:\n\n(5 * √5) / (4 * √5 * √5) = (5√5) / (4 * 5) = (5√5) / 20. Simplifying that, I can divide numerator and denominator by 5: √5 / 4.\n\nOkay, so the first term, 5 / √80, simplifies to √5 / 4.\n\nNext up is √845 / 9. Let me see if I can simplify √845. 845 divided by 5 is 169, and 169 is 13 squared. So, 845 = 5 * 13². Therefore, √845 = √(13² * 5) = 13√5. So, √845 / 9 becomes (13√5) / 9.\n\nThe third term is √45. Let's simplify that. 45 is 9*5, and 9 is a perfect square. So, √45 = √(9*5) = 3√5.\n\nSo now, the numerator inside the square root is: (√5 / 4) + (13√5 / 9) + 3√5.\n\nHmm, I need to add these three terms. It might help to have a common denominator. Let me see. The denominators are 4, 9, and 1."

            "output": " The least common denominator (LCD) would be 36 because 4*9=36.\n\nSo, let me convert each term to have 36 as the denominator.\n\nFirst term: √5 / 4 = (9√5) / 36.\n\nSecond term: 13√5 / 9 = (13√5 * 4) / (9*4) = 52√5 / 36.\n\nThird term: 3√5 = (3√5 * 36) / 36 = 108√5 / 36.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. To convert 3√5 to 36ths, I multiply numerator and denominator by 36, but actually, since 3√5 is the same as 3√5/1, to get denominator 36, I multiply both numerator and denominator by 36: (3√5 * 36)/36. Wait, that's not correct because that would make the numerator 3*36√5, which is way too big. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nActually, to convert each term to have denominator 36, I should adjust the numerators accordingly. Let me do it step by step.\n\nFirst term: √5 / 4. Multiply numerator and denominator by 9 to get denominator 36: (9√5) / 36.\n\nSecond term: 13√5 / 9. Multiply numerator and denominator by 4: (13√5 * 4) / (9*4) = 52√5 / 36.\n\nThird term: 3√5. Multiply numerator and denominator by 36: (3√5 * 36) / 36, which would be 108√5 / 36. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because 3√5 is a whole number, and if I write it as 108√5 / 36, that's correct because 108 divided by 36 is 3. So, it's 3√5.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to keep the third term as is for now and add it after converting the others. Let me see.\n\nSo, the converted terms are:\n\n√5 / 4 = 9√5 / 36.\n\n13√5 / 9 = 52√5 / 36.\n\n3√5 = 108√5 / 36.\n\n"

So, total is 169√5 / 36.\n\nTherefore, the numerator inside the big square root simplifies to 169√5 / 36.\n\nNow, the entire expression is the square root of [ (169√5 / 36) divided by √5 ].\n\nLet me write that as:\n\n√[ (169√5 / 36) / √5 ]\n\nDividing by √5 is the same as multiplying by 1/√5, so:\n\n√[ (169√5 / 36) * (1/√5) ]\n\nMultiplying those terms inside the square root:\n\nThe √5 in the numerator and the √5 in the denominator will cancel each other out. Let me see:\n\n√5 divided by √5 is 1, so that simplifies to 169 / 36.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n(169√5 / 36) * (1/√5) = (169 / 36) * (√5 / √5) = (169 / 36) * 1 = 169/36.\n\nSo, the expression inside the square root simplifies to 169/36.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is √(169/36).\n\nTaking the square root of numerator and denominator separately:\n\n√169 = 13, and √36 = 6. So, √(169/36) = 13/6.\n\nWait, so that's the simplified fraction? Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the numerator terms:\n\nFirst term: 5/√80. Simplified to √5/4. That seems right because 5 divided by 4√5, then multiplied by √5/√5 gives 5√5/("

Simplified to 13√5/9, because 845 is 5*13², so square root is 13√5, and that divided by 9.\n\nThird term: √45 = 3√5.\n\nAdding these: √5/4 + 13√5/9 + 3√5.\n\nConverted to common denominator 36, it becomes 9√5/36 + 52√5/36 + 108√5/36, which adds up to 169√5/36.\n\nThen, when dividing by √5, it's 169√5/36 divided by √5, which becomes 169/36.\n\nSquare root of that is 13/6.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check each step.\n\nWait, when I converted 3√5 to 36 denominator, I wrote 108√5/36, which is correct because 3√5 = 3√5 * (36/36) = (108√5)/36. So that part's fine.\n\nAdding up all the numerators: 9 + 52 + 108. 9 +52 is 61, plus 108 is 169. That adds up.\n\nSo, 169√5 /36. When we divide that by √5, it's like (169√5) / (√5 * 36). √5 cancels, leaving 169/36.\n\nTaking the square root of 169/36, which is 13/6.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to think, 13 and 6 don't have any common factors, so 13/6 is the simplified fraction.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.
