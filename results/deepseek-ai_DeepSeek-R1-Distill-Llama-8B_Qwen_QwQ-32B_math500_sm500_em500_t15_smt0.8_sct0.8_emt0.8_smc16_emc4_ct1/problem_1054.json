The question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots of this polynomial. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember there's something called the Rational Root Theorem, which can help find the possible rational roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients. I think it's been a while since I used it, but I believe it's quite useful for problems like this. Let me try to recall how it works.\n\nFrom what I remember, the Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root, expressed in its lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. In this polynomial, the constant term is 1, and the leading coefficient is 2. So, applying the theorem, \\(p\\) should divide 1, and \\(q\\) should divide 2.\n\nLet me break that down. The constant term here is 1. The factors of 1 are just \\(\\pm1\\). The leading coefficient is 2, so the factors of 2 are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\). Therefore, the possible values for \\(p\\) are \\(\\pm1\\), and the possible values for \\(q\\) are \\(\\pm1\\), \\(\\pm2\\). \n\nBut wait, I think when considering the Rational Root Theorem, we usually take \\(q\\) as a positive integer because the sign can be considered separately. So, maybe I should just consider \\(q\\) as 1 and 2, without including the negatives because that can lead to duplication. So, \\(q = 1\\) and \\(q = 2\\).\n\nNow, for each combination of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), we can form a possible rational root by \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\). So, let's list them out.\n\nFirst, for \\(q = 1\\): The possible roots are \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\) and \\(\\frac{-1}{1} ="

But the question is asking for the number of different possible rational roots. Since all these four are distinct, does that mean the answer is 4?\n\nHold on a second. But the problem states \"different possible rational roots of this polynomial\". However, can all of these roots actually be roots for some choice of integer coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_1\\)?\n\nHmm, the question is asking how many different rational numbers could be roots depending on what the coefficients \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_1\\) are. Since the coefficients can be any integers, right? So, maybe each of these possible roots could be achieved by some polynomial of the given form.\n\nWait, let me think again. The Rational Root Theorem gives possible candidates for rational roots, but whether each of them is actually achievable depends on whether there exist coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) such that the polynomial has that root.\n\nFor example, if I set a particular rational number as a root, then the polynomial can be factored as (something)(x - root)... and the other factors can be adjusted with integer coefficients?\n\nAlternatively, since the polynomial has integer coefficients, if \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) is a root, then the minimal polynomial of that root must divide the given polynomial. But maybe that's complicating things?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can construct for each of these four possible roots a specific polynomial with coefficients integers that has that root. If we can do that for all four, then they are all possible, hence making the answer 4. If not, maybe some roots can't be achieved, so the answer would be fewer.\n\nLet me check each one.\n\nStarting with 1: Let's see if 1 can be a root. If x=1 is a root, then substituting into the polynomial, we get 2(1)^4 + a3(1)^3 + a2(1)^2 + a1(1) +1 = 0\n\nWhich"

For example, set a3 = 0, a2 = 0, then a1 = -3. So, 0 + 0 + (-3) = -3, which works. Therefore, 1 is a possible root.\n\nSimilarly, testing -1: Substitute x=-1 into the polynomial: 2(-1)^4 + a3(-1)^3 + a2(-1)^2 + a1(-1) +1.\n\nCalculates to 2(1) + a3(-1) + a2(1) + a1(-1) +1 = 2 -a3 + a2 -a1 +1 = 3 -a3 + a2 -a1 = 0.\n\nSo, 3 -a3 + a2 -a1 = 0 => -a3 + a2 -a1 = -3.\n\nWe can find integers a3, a2, a1 that satisfy this. For example, set a3=0, a2=0, then -0 +0 -a1 = -3 => a1=3. So, coefficients would be a3=0, a2=0, a1=3. Then, the polynomial becomes 2x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 +3x +1, which when x=-1: 2(1) +0 +0 -3 +1 = 0.

Let me try another set.\n\nWait, perhaps setting a3= -9, a2=0, a1=0. Then:\n\n-9 + 0 + 0 = -9, which works. So, the polynomial would be 2x^4 -9x^3 + 0x^2 +0x +1.
