            "output": "Alright, so I have this polynomial equation: \\(2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0\\). It's a quartic polynomial with integer coefficients, and I need to find the number of different possible rational roots. Hmm, okay, I remember there's something called the Rational Root Theorem that might help here.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the Rational Root Theorem states. If a polynomial has integer coefficients, then any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. That makes sense. So in this case, the constant term is 1 and the leading coefficient is 2.\n\nSo, breaking it down, \\(p\\) can be any factor of 1, and \\(q\\) can be any factor of 2. What are the factors of 1? Well, only 1 and -1. And the factors of 2 are 1, -1, 2, and -2. Now, according to the theorem, the possible rational roots are all combinations of these \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nLet me list them out. For \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 1\\), the possible root is \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\). For \\(p = 1\\) and \\(q = 2\\), it's \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Similarly, for \\(p = -1\\) and \\(q = 1\\), it's \\(-1\\), and for \\(p = -1\\) and \\(q = 2\\), it's \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). \n\nWait, but hold on. Are there any other factors? Since 1 only has 1 and -1 as its factors, and 2 has 1, -1, 2, -2, that's all the possibilities. So the possible rational roots are 1, -1, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\). \n\nLet me count them. That's four different possible rational roots. Is there a chance I missed any? Let me double-check. The constant term is 1, so possible values of \\(p"

So combining them, all possible fractions are ±1/1, ±1/2, ±1/-1 (which simplifies to ±1), and ±1/-2 (which simplifies to ∓1/2). So actually, this gives me 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2. \n\nSo, are there any duplicates here? 1 and 1/1 are the same, -1 is unique, 1/2 and -1/2 are unique. So, in total, four distinct possible rational roots.\n\nI think that's it. So, the number of different possible rational roots is 4.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. The polynomial is quartic, which can have up to four roots, but the question is only about possible rational roots, not how many there actually are. So regardless of the actual roots, the possible ones are limited by the Rational Root Theorem. Yep, so my initial reasoning holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4 different possible rational roots.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial has integer coefficients, with a constant term of 1 and leading coefficient of 2. Applying the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are ±1 and ±1/2. These yield four distinct possible rational roots.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
