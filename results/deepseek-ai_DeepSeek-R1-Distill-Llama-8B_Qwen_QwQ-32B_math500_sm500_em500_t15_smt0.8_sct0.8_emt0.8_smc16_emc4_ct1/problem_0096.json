The equation given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, alright. I remember from algebra that when you have a rational expression on the left side, you can combine them by finding a common denominator. The right side already has that denominator, so that must be the common denominator too. Let me check: the denominator on the right is \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\). I should factor that to see if it matches the denominators on the left.\n\nTo factor \\(x^2 + 5x - 24\\), I need two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to +5. Let's see... 8 and -3: 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. Yes, that works. So the denominator factors to (x + 8)(x - 3). That matches the denominators on the left side. Good.\n\nSo, the left side is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8}\n\\]\n\nTo add these two fractions, we'll get a common denominator, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). So, we can write the left side as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nSo, expanding the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nSo, setting up two equations by equating the coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: "

Maybe elimination is better here.\n\nLet me multiply equation (1) by 3 to make the coefficients of D opposites:\n\n3C + 3D = 12 ...(1a)\n\nNow, equation (2) is:\n\n8C - 3D = -23 ...(2)\n\nAdd (1a) and (2):\n\n3C + 3D + 8C - 3D = 12 + (-23)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n11C = -11\n\nSo, C = -1\n\nNow, substitute C = -1 into equation (1):\n\n-1 + D = 4 => D = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Then, the product CD is (-1)(5) = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nSubstitute C = -1 and D = 5 back into the original fractions:\n\nLeft side:\n\n-1/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8)\n\nCombine them: [ -1(x + 8) + 5(x - 3) ] / (x - 3)(x + 8)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n-1*x - 8 + 5x - 15 = (-x + 5x) + (-8 -15) = 4x - 23\n\nWhich matches the right side numerator.
