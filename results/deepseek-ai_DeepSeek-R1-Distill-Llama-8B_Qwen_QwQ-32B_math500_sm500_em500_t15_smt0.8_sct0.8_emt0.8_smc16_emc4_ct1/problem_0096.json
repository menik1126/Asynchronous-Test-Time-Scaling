            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product CD of two integers C and D. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n(C)/(x - 3) + (D)/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/(x\u00b2 + 5x - 24)\n\nIt says this is true for all real values of x except -8 and 3, which makes sense because those would make the denominators zero. Hmm, I think I need to use partial fractions here because the left side has two fractions with linear denominators, and the right side is a single fraction with a quadratic denominator.\n\nFirst, I should factor the denominator on the right side to make sure I can work with partial fractions properly. Let me try factoring x\u00b2 + 5x - 24. \n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add to 5. Let me think, 8 and -3: 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. Yes, perfect. So, the quadratic factors into (x + 8)(x - 3). That matches the denominators on the left side, which is good.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nC/(x - 3) + D/(x + 8) = (4x - 23)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nSince the denominators are the same on both sides, I can equate the numerators:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, I need to find constants C and D such that this equation holds for all x except -8 and 3. To do this, I can expand the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = 4x - 23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, I can set up a system of equations by equating the coefficients of like terms on both sides.\n\nSo, for the x term:\nC + D = 4\n\nAnd for the constant term:\n8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) C + D = 4\n2) 8C - 3D = -23\n\nI need to solve this system for C and"

Then substitute into equation 2:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, substitute C = -1 back into D = 4 - C:\n\nD = 4 - (-1) = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Now, the problem asks for the product CD, which is (-1)*5 = -5.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me plug C and D back into the left side:\n\n(-1)/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8)\n\nLet me combine these fractions:\n\n[(-1)(x + 8) + 5(x - 3)] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)]\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\n-1*x -1*8 +5*x -5*3 = (-x -8 +5x -15) = (4x -23)\n\nWhich matches the numerator on the right side. So that's correct. Therefore, the product CD is indeed -5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for integers \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) in the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x - 3} + \\frac{D}{x + 8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\nwe first equate the numerators:\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\nExpanding and combining like terms:\n\\[\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23\n\\]\nSetting coefficients equal:\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nC + D = 4 \\\\\n8C - 3D = -23\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nSolving the system, we find \\( C = -1 \\) and \\( D = 5 \\)."
