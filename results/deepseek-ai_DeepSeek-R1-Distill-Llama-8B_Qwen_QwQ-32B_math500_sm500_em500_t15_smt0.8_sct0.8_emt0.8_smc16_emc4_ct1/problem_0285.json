Every pair of terms can be grouped together to simplify the calculation.\n\nSo, I'll pair the terms like this: (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + ... + (99 - 100).\n\nEach pair simplifies to -1, as seen with the first pair: 1 - 2 equals -1.\n\nNow, I need to determine how many such pairs there are in the series. Since there are 100 terms in total and each pair consists of 2 terms, there are 100 / 2 = 50 pairs.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the result of one pair by the number of pairs: -1 * 50 equals -50.\n\nThe final answer is -50.\n</think>\n\nLet's compute the series \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100\\) step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Write Down the Series\n\\[\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Group the Terms in Pairs\nNotice that the series alternates between addition and subtraction. We can group the terms in pairs to simplify the computation:\n\\[\n(1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute Each Pair\nEach pair simplifies as follows:\n\\[\n1 - 2 = -1\n\\]\n\\[\n3 - 4 = -1\n\\]\n\\[\n5 - 6 = -1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\vdots\n\\]\n\\[\n99 - 100 = -1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Pairs\nThere are 100 terms in total. Since each pair consists of 2 terms, there are:\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ pairs}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Multiply by the Number of Pairs\nSince each pair equals \\(-1\\), the total sum is:\n\\[\n"
