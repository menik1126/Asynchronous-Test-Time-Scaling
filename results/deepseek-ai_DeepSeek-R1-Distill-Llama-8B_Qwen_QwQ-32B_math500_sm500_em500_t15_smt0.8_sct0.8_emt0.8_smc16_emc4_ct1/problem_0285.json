            "output": "First, I need to understand the pattern in the series: 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \u2026 + 99 - 100. I notice that the series alternates between addition and subtraction, starting with a positive term.\n\nNext, I'll group the terms in pairs to simplify the calculation. Each pair consists of a positive odd number and the subsequent negative even number. So, the series can be rewritten as (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \u2026 + (99 - 100).\n\nCalculating each pair gives me: (1 - 2) = -1, (3 - 4) = -1, (5 - 6) = -1, and so on, up to (99 - 100) = -1. Since there are 50 such pairs, the total sum is -1 multiplied by 50, which equals -50.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the series is -50.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Series Pattern:**\n   The given series is:\n   \\[\n   S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100\n   \\]\n   Notice that the series alternates between addition and subtraction of consecutive integers.\n\n2. **Group the Terms:**\n   Pair the terms to simplify the calculation:\n   \\[\n   S = (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n   Each pair is of the form:\n   \\[\n   (2k - 1) - 2k = -1 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad k = 1, 2, \\dots, 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Each Pair:**\n   Each pair simplifies to \\(-1\\). There are 50 such pairs because there are 100 terms in total.\n\n4. **Sum All Pairs:**\n   \\[\n   S = 50 \\times (-1) = -50\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
