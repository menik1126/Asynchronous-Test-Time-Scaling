            "output": "Alright, so I need to solve this equation: (3)5\u00b2 - 4(5 - a)\u00b2 \u00f7 3 = 63. Hmm, let me break it down step by step. First, I should probably write it down clearly to make sure I understand it correctly. \n\nWait, the equation is written as (3)5\u00b2 - 4(5 - a)\u00b2 \u00f7 3 = 63. Hmm, okay, so is that 3 times 5 squared? Or is it 35 squared? Because the way it's written, (3)5\u00b2 could be interpreted as 3\u00d75\u00b2 or as (35)\u00b2. I need to clarify that. Let me check. In the original problem, it's written as (3)5\u00b2 - 4(5 - a)\u00b2 \u00f7 3 = 63. So, I think each term is separate. So, it's 3\u00d75\u00b2 minus 4\u00d7(5 - a)\u00b2 divided by 3 equals 63. Yeah, that makes more sense because otherwise, if it were 35 squared, it would probably be written as 35\u00b2 or (5\u00d73)^2 or something.\n\nOkay, so let me rewrite the equation to avoid confusion:\n\n3 \u00d7 5\u00b2 - [4 \u00d7 (5 - a)\u00b2] \u00f7 3 = 63.\n\nNow, let's compute the constants first. 5 squared is 25, and 3 \u00d7 25 is 75. So, the first term is 75.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n75 - (4 \u00d7 (5 - a)\u00b2) / 3 = 63.\n\nHmm, to make this easier, maybe I can subtract 75 from both sides to isolate the term with a. Let's try that.\n\n75 - 63 = (4 \u00d7 (5 - a)\u00b2) / 3.\n\nSo, 12 = (4 \u00d7 (5 - a)\u00b2) / 3.\n\nNow, to get rid of the division by 3, I can multiply both sides by 3.\n\n12 \u00d7 3 = 4 \u00d7 (5 - a)\u00b2.\n\nSo, 36 = 4 \u00d7 (5 - a)\u00b2.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4 to solve for (5 - a)\u00b2.\n\n36 / 4 = (5 - a)\u00b2.\n\n9 = (5 - a"

            "output": ")\u00b2.\n\nOkay, so now we have (5 - a) squared equals 9. To solve for (5 - a), we take the square root of both sides. Remember, square roots can be positive or negative.\n\nSo, 5 - a = \u00b1\u221a9.\n\n\u221a9 is 3, so:\n\n5 - a = 3 or 5 - a = -3.\n\nNow, solving for a in both cases.\n\nFirst case: 5 - a = 3.\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides: -a = 3 - 5 \u2192 -a = -2.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: a = 2.\n\nSecond case: 5 - a = -3.\n\nSubtract 5 from both sides: -a = -3 -5 \u2192 -a = -8.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: a = 8.\n\nSo, the solutions are a = 2 and a = 8. The question asks for the sum of the values of a that satisfy the equation. So, 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through again.\n\nOriginal equation: 3\u00d75\u00b2 - [4\u00d7(5 - a)\u00b2]/3 = 63.\n\nCompute 3\u00d725 = 75. So, 75 - [4\u00d7(5 - a)^2]/3 = 63.\n\nSubtract 63 from both sides: 75 - 63 = 12, so 12 = [4\u00d7(5 - a)^2]/3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3: 36 = 4\u00d7(5 - a)^2.\n\nDivide by 4: 9 = (5 - a)^2.\n\nSquare roots: 5 - a = \u00b13, leading to a = 2 or 8. Sum is 10. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should plug the values back into the original equation to verify.\n\nFirst, a = 2:\n\nCompute (5 - a)^2 = (5 - 2)^2 = 3\u00b2 = 9.\n\nThen, 4\u00d79 = 36. Divide by 3: 12.\n\nSo, the equation becomes 75 - 12 = 63. 75 -12"

Therefore, the sum is 2+8=10.\n\nYeah, I think that's solid. No mistakes noticed this time.\n</think>\n\nThe equation simplifies to 75 - (4(5 - a)\u00b2)/3 = 63. Solving step-by-step, we find that a can be 2 or 8, and their sum is 10.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. Start with the given equation:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5^2 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute \\(3 \\times 5^2\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 25 = 75\n   \\]\n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   75 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract 63 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   75 - 63 = \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12 = \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:\n   \\[\n   36 = 4(5 - a)^2\n   \\]\n\n5. Divide both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   9 = (5 - a)^2\n   \\]\n\n6. Take the square root of both sides, remembering to consider both positive and negative roots:\n   \\[\n   5 - a = \\pm3\n   \\]\n\n7. Solve for \\(a\\) in each case:\n   - If \\(5 - a = 3\\):\n     \\[\n     -a = -2 \\implies a = 2\n     \\]\n   - If \\(5 - a = -3\\):\n     \\[\n     -a = -8 \\implies a = 8\n     \\]\n\n8. Sum the solutions:\n   \\[\n   2 + 8 = 10\n   \\]\n\n**Answer"
