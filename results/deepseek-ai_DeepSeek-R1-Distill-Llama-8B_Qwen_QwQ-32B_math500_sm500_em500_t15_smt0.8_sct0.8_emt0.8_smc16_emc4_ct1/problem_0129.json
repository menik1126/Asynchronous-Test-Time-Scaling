            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about the superfactorial, and I need to find the units digit of 4\\$. Hmm, let me try to understand what 4\\$ means here. The problem says that the superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n! raised to the power of itself n! times. So, for 4\\$, it's 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of... actually, it's repeated n! times, right? So for 4\\$, it's 4!^{{4!^{{4!^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^{4!}}}}}}}} with the exponent being 4! repeated 4 times? Wait, let me make sure I got that right.\n\nThe definition is n\\$ = n!^{{n!^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}} with the exponent being n! repeated n times. So, for 4\\$, it's 4!^{{4!^{{4!^{{4!^{{4!}}}}}}}}}}, right? Because n is 4, so it's n! raised to the power of n! repeated n times. So, in this case, 4! is 24, and so we have 24 raised to the power of 24, then 24 raised again, four times total.\n\nBut directly computing this seems impossible because the exponent tower is way too high. I mean, even 24^24 is a massive number, and then the next exponents on top of that are going to make it even more enormous. So, there must be a smarter way to figure out the units digit without computing the entire number.\n\nI remember that to find the units digit of a number, we can use modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 10, because the units digit is the remainder when divided by 10. So, if I can find 4\\$ modulo 10, that will give me the units digit.\n\nSo, let's start by simplifying step by step. First, 4! is 24, right? So, 4\\$ is 24^(24^(24^(24^24))). That is, 24 raised to the power of 24, then 24 again, and so on, four times in total. Hmm, maybe I can reduce the exponent modulo something to make"

Since we're dealing with mod 10 of the base, perhaps using Euler's theorem or something similar.\n\nEuler's theorem states that if two numbers are coprime, then a^φ(n) ≡ 1 mod n, where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. But here, 24 and 10 are not coprime because they share a common divisor of 2. Oh, so Euler's theorem in its basic form might not apply directly here. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the modulus for each prime power in 10, which is 2 and 5, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the units digit cycles in some pattern. Since 10 factors into 2 and 5, maybe I can compute modulo 4 and modulo 5 separately and combine them? Wait, but 10 is 2×5, so Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) requires that. Alternatively, if I can find the exponent modulo φ(10), φ(10) is φ(2×5)=1×4=4. But since 24 and 10 aren't coprime, maybe that complicates things again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe approach it directly for modulo 10. Let me think. Let's define the problem again: the units digit is the last digit. Let's see, perhaps first compute 24 mod 10 = 4. But the expression is 24^(24^(...)), so the base is 24, which mod 10 is 4. But the exponent is huge. So, perhaps think of 4^exponent mod 10. Wait, but the base is 24, so actually, the base mod 10 is 4, so the entire expression is 4^(something) mod 10. So first, the base is mod 10, and the exponent can be reduced modulo φ(10) if they are coprime. Since 4 and 10 are not coprime (they share 2), φ(10)=4, so maybe we have to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, since the base mod 10 is 4, perhaps we can find the pattern of 4's powers mod 10.

So, the cycle length is 2.\n\nTherefore, to find 4^k mod 10, we only need to know whether k is odd or even. If k is odd, it's 4; if k is even, it's 6.\n\nSo, in our case, k is 24^{{24^{{24^{24}}}}} mod φ(10)=4? Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps instead of that, let's think about the exponent.\n\nWe have 24^(24^(24^(24^24))). Let me consider the exponent first. Let's denote E =24^{{24^{{24^{24}}}}} and F=24^(E), then 4\\$/=24^F, but perhaps that is not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should handle the exponent step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost exponent: a =24\n\nThen, b=24^a\n\nc=24^b\n\nd=24^c\n\nSo, 4\\$/=24^d\n\nSo, 4\\$/=24^d, so to find 24^d mod 10, which is same as 4^d mod10, which depends on whether d is odd or even.\n\nSo, if I can find the parity (odd or even) of d=24^c, then I can determine if the exponent is odd or even.\n\nSo, first, what's c?\n\nc=24^b\n\nBut b=24^{24}, so compute b=24^24\n\nSo, 24^24.

So, let's correct my initial mistake.\n\nSo, 4\\$ = 24^{24^{24^{...}}} with 24 levels of exponents, each being 24.\n\nSo, for example, the innermost is 24, then 24^24, then 24^(24^24), and so on, up to 24 levels.
