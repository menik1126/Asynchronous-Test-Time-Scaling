            "output": "First, I need to simplify the given equation step by step. The original equation is:\n\n$$\n(3)5^2 - 4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63\n$$\n\nI notice that there are two mathematical operations that need to be addressed first: multiplication and division. According to the order of operations, I should perform Division and Multiplication from left to right before performing Addition and Subtraction.\n\nStarting with the division:\n\n$$\n4(5 - a)^2 \\div 3\n$$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3}\n$$\n\nNext, I will rewrite the original equation with the simplified division:\n\n$$\n3 \\times 5^2 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n$$\n\nCalculating $3 \\times 5^2$:\n\n$$\n3 \\times 25 = 75\n$$\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n$$\n75 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n$$\n\nNow, I will move the term with \\( a \\) to one side and the constant term to the other side. Subtract 75 from both sides:\n\n$$\n- \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63 - 75\n$$\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\n$$\n- \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = -12\n$$\n\nSince both sides are negative, I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the equation positive:\n\n$$\n\\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 12\n$$\n\nNow, I will eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:\n\n$$\n4(5 - a)^2 = 36\n$$\n\nNext, I will isolate \\( (5 - a)^2 \\) by dividing both sides by 4:\n\n$$\n(5 - a)^2 = 9\n$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides to solve for \\( (5 - a) \\):\n\n$$\n5 - a = \\pm 3\n$$\n\nThis gives me two possible equations:\n\n1. \\( 5 - a = 3 \\)\n   \n   Solving for \\( a \\):\n   \n   $$\n   -a = 3 - 5\n   $$\n   $$\n   -"
