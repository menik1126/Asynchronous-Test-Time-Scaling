            "output": "First, I need to determine how many trailing zeros are in the number 42!.\n\nTrailing zeros are created by multiplying 10s in the factorial. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, each pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factors of 42! contributes to a trailing zero.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 5s in the prime factors. This is necessary because there are usually more 2s than 5s in the factorial product.\n\nTo find the number of 5s, I'll divide 42 by 5, which gives me 8.4, and take the floor to get 8. Then, I'll divide 42 by 25 and take the floor, which gives me 1. Adding these together, there are 9 fives in the prime factors of 42!.\n\nSince there are definitely more than 9 twos in the prime factors, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is determined by the number of 5s, which is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many trailing zeros are in \\(42!\\) (42 factorial), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - A trailing zero is produced by multiplying 10, which is \\(2 \\times 5\\).\n   - In the factorial product, there are typically more factors of 2 than 5, so the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 appears in the prime factors.\n\n2. **Count the Number of 5s:**\n   - Divide 42 by 5: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\rfloor = 8 \\). This accounts for multiples of 5.\n   - Divide 42 by 25: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\rfloor = 1 \\). This accounts for multiples of 25 (since each contributes an additional 5).\n   - Add these together: \\(8 + 1 = 9\\).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are **9** trailing zeros in \\(42!\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
