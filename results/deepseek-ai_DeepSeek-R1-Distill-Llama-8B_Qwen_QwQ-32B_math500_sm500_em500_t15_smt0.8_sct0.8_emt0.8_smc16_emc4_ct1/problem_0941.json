Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 42!.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!. I do this by dividing 42 by 5 and taking the floor of the result. So, 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, and taking the floor gives me 8 fives.\n\nThen, I'll count the number of 2s in the prime factors of 42!. I divide 42 by 2, which gives 21, and since 21 is a whole number, there are 21 twos.\n\nFinally, the number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the number of fives and the number of twos. Here, there are 8 fives and 21 twos, so the limiting factor is the number of fives. Therefore, 42! ends with 8 trailing zeros.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeroes are at the end of **42!** (42 factorial), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**:\n   - **42!** means the product of all positive integers from 1 to 42.\n   - A trailing zero is created by multiplying 2 and 5 (since 2 × 5 = 10).\n   - The number of trailing zeros depends on the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factors of **42!**.\n\n2. **Count the Number of 5s**:\n   - Divide 42 by 5: **42 ÷ 5 = 8.4**.\n   - Take the **floor** of this division to get the number of 5s: **8**.\n   - **\\( \\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\rfloor = 8 \\)**\n   - *Explanation:* This accounts for all multiples of 5 in the factorial.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 2s**:\n   - Divide 42 by 2: **42 ÷ 2 = 21**.\n   - Take the **floor** of this division to get the number of 2s: **"
