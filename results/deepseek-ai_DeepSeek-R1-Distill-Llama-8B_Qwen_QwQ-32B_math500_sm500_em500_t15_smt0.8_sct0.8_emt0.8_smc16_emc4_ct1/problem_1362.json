Let G represent the number of girls and B represent the number of boys attending the math club meeting.\n\nNext, I know that there are a total of 35 students. So, I can write the equation:\nG + B = 35\n\nAdditionally, the number of girls, G, is a multiple of 13. The multiples of 13 up to 35 are 13 and 26. Since there must be more girls than boys, G cannot be 13 because that would mean there are 22 boys, which is not possible as there can't be more boys than girls in that case.\n\nThis leaves G as 26. Substituting this into the total equation:\n26 + B = 35\n\nSolving for B gives:\nB = 35 - 26\nB = 9\n\nTherefore, there are 9 boys attending the math club meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( G \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- There are more girls than boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\n**Step 1:** Write the equation for the total number of students.\n\n\\[\nG + B = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Since \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys, let's find the possible values for \\( G \\).\n\nThe multiples of 13 up to 35 are:\n- 13\n- 26\n\nSince there are more girls than boys, \\( G \\) cannot be 13 because that would imply more boys than girls (since \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\)), which contradicts the given condition.\n\nTherefore, \\( G = 26 \\).\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute \\( G = 26 \\) into the total equation to find \\( B \\).\n\n\\[\n26 + B = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Solve for \\( B \\).\n\n\\[\nB = 35 - 26 = 9\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
