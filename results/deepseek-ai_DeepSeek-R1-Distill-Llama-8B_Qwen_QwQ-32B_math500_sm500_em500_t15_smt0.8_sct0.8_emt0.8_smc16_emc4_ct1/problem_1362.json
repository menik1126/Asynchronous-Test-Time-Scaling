            "output": "I need to find the number of boys at the math club meeting. There are 35 students in total, with the number of girls being a multiple of 13.\n\nSince there are more girls than boys, the number of girls must be greater than half of the total number of students.\n\nI'll start by listing the multiples of 13 up to 35: 13, 26, and 39. But since 39 is more than 35, the possible number of girls is either 13 or 26.\n\nIf there are 13 girls, then the number of boys would be 35 - 13 = 22. However, this would mean there are equal numbers of boys and girls, which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nTherefore, the only valid option is that there are 26 girls. Subtracting this from the total number of students gives the number of boys: 35 - 26 = 9.\n\nSo, there are 9 boys attending the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints.**\nSince the number of girls is a multiple of 13 and there are more girls than boys, let’s denote:\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n\nWe know that:\n1. \\( G + B = 35 \\)  (Total number of students)\n2. \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13.\n3. \\( G > B \\)\n\n**Step 2: Determine possible values for \\( G \\).**\nSince \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13 and \\( G > B \\), let's find the possible values of \\( G \\) less than 35.\n\nMultiples of 13 within range:\n- 13, 26, 39 (but 39 is more than 35, so only 13 and 26 are possible.)\n\n**Step 3: Test each possible value of \\( G \\).**\n\n1. **If \\( G = 13 \\):**\n   - \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\)\n   - But \\( G = 13 \\) and \\( B = 22 \\), so \\( G < B \\), which contradicts the condition"
