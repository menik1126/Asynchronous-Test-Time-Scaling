To find the possible values of x, I need to determine how many factors of 54 satisfy the condition that y is at least 5.\n\nNext, I'll find all the factors of 54. The prime factors of 54 are 2 and 3, so the factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\nSince each player must receive at least 5 cards, I'll exclude the factors that are less than 5. This leaves me with 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that x is at least 2. I'll consider these remaining factors to determine how many of them can be divided evenly into groups where each group has at least 2 players.\n\nFor each valid factor:\n- 6 can be divided into 2 players, so x = 2.\n- 9 can be divided into 3 players, so x = 3.\n- 18 can be divided into 2 or 9 players, so x = 2 or 9.\n- 27 can be divided into 3 or 9 players, so x = 3 or 9.\n- 54 can be divided into 2, 3, 9, 18, 27, or 54 players, but since x must be at least 2 and we've already considered the minimal cases, the unique values are x = 2, 3, 9.\n\nFinally, compiling all the possible x values, I find that there are 5 unique values: 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\) when dealing 54 cards among \\( x \\) players with each player receiving at least 5 cards, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Total cards: 54\n   - Each player gets \\( y \\) cards.\n   - \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( y \\geq 5 \\).\n\n2. **Find Possible Values of \\( y \\):**\n   - Since \\( y \\) must be at least 5, we need to find divisors of 54 that are \\( \\geq"
