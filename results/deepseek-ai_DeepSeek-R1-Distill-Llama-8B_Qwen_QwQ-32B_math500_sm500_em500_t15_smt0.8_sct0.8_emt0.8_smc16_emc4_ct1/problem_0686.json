This leads me to consider the maximum number of players, which is constrained by the minimum number of cards each player can receive without violating the 5-card requirement. \n\nFirst, I calculate the minimum number of players by dividing the total number of cards by the minimum number of cards per player: \\( 54 \\div 5 = 10.8 \\). Since the number of players must be an integer, I round up to the next whole number, which is 11. This means the minimum number of players is 11.\n\nNext, I need to determine the maximum number of players. With each player receiving at least 5 cards, the maximum number of players is when each player receives exactly 5 cards, and one player receives the remaining 4 cards. Therefore, the maximum number of players is 11.\n\nFinally, I list the possible number of players starting from 11 down to the minimum feasible number. However, since 11 is the only possible value when each player must receive at least 5 cards, there is only one possible value for \\( x \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\) when dealing 54 cards to \\( x \\) players with each receiving at least 5 cards, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Constraints\n- **Total Cards:** 54\n- **Minimum Cards per Player:** \\( y = 5 \\)\n- **Number of Players:** \\( x \\)\n- **Condition:** Each player must receive at least 5 cards.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Possible Range for \\( x \\)\nThe number of players \\( x \\) must satisfy the inequality:\n\\[\n5x \\leq 54\n\\]\nTo find the maximum possible value of \\( x \\), divide the total number of cards by the minimum number of cards per player:\n\\[\nx_{\\text{max}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{54}{5} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 10.8 \\right\\rfloor = 10\n\\]\nHowever, since each player must receive at least 5 cards, the"

            "output": " total cards must be exactly divisible by \\( x \\) when considering integer values. Wait, this is incorrect. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, the inequality \\( 5x \\leq 54 \\) gives the maximum \\( x \\) as 10.8, so the maximum integer \\( x \\) is 10. But since each player must receive at least 5 cards, the minimum number of players is when each gets exactly 5 cards, but 54 divided by 5 is 10.8, so you can\u2019t have 10 players each with 5 cards (since 10\u00d75=50, leaving 4 cards, which can\u2019t form another player with at least 5). Therefore, the maximum number of players is actually 10, but this would leave 4 cards unassigned, which violates the requirement. Hence, the maximum \\( x \\) must be such that \\( 5x \\leq 54 \\), but also that the remaining cards can be distributed without violating the minimum. Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that all cards are dealt to the players, so each player must get exactly \\( y \\) cards, but the problem says \"each player getting \\( y \\) cards\". Wait, the question says \"deal all of the cards to \\( x \\) players, with each player getting \\( y \\) cards\". So, this implies that \\( x \\times y = 54 \\), and \\( y \\geq 5 \\), \\( x \\geq 2 \\).\n\nAh, this is a key point. The problem states that all cards are dealt, so \\( x \\times y = 54 \\), with \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( y \\geq 5 \\). Therefore, \\( x \\) must be a divisor of 54, and \\( y = 54/x \\) must be an integer greater than or equal to 5. So, the problem reduces to finding all divisors \\( x \\) of 54 such that \\( x \\geq 2 \\) and \\( 54/x \\geq 5 \\).\n\nLet me correct my approach:\n\n### Step 1: Find all divisors of 54.\nThe divisors of 54 are: 1, 2, 3,"
