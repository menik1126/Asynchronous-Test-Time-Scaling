The number 9 in base ten is equal to 13 in base six because 9 divided by 6 is 1 with a remainder of 3.\n\nSince 999 has three digits, each digit will be converted individually. Therefore, 999 in base ten is 1003 in base six.\n\nI'll write down the steps for clarity:\n1. Convert the digits:\n   - 9 = 13_6\n   - 9 = 13_6\n   - 9 = 13_6\n2. Combine the converted digits to get 1003_6.\n\nThus, the base six equivalent of 999 in base ten is 1003_6.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six (\\( 6_{\\text{base}} \\)), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the place values in base six:**\n   - The rightmost digit represents \\( 6^0 = 1 \\).\n   - The middle digit represents \\( 6^1 = 6 \\).\n   - The leftmost digit represents \\( 6^2 = 36 \\).\n\n2. **Convert each digit of \\( 999_{10} \\) to base six:**\n   - **First digit (hundreds place in decimal):**  \n     \\( 9 \\div 6 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 3 \\).  \n     So, \\( 9_{10} = 13_{6} \\).\n   \n   - **Second digit (tens place in decimal):**  \n     \\( 9 \\div 6 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 3 \\).  \n     So, \\( 9_{10} = 13_{6} \\).\n   \n   - **Third digit (units place in decimal):**  \n     \\( 9 \\div 6 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 3 \\).  \n     So, \\( 9_{10} = 13_{6} \\).\n\n3. **Combine the base six digits:**\n   \\[\n   999_{10} = 1003_{6}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1003_{6"
