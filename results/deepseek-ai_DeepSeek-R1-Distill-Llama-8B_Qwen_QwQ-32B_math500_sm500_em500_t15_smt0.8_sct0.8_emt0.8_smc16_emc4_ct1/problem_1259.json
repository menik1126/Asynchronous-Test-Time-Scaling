This means 6 multiplied by 166 equals 996, and 999 minus 996 leaves a remainder of 3.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6, resulting in 27 with a remainder of 4. Therefore, 6 times 27 equals 162, and 166 minus 162 leaves a remainder of 4.\n\nContinuing, I'll divide the new quotient 27 by 6, which gives 4 with a remainder of 3. So, 6 times 4 equals 24, and 27 minus 24 leaves a remainder of 3.\n\nFinally, I'll divide 4 by 6, which gives 0 with a remainder of 4. This means 6 multiplied by 0 equals 0, and 4 minus 0 leaves a remainder of 4.\n\nNow, I'll list the remainders from last to first: 4, 3, 4, and 3. Combining these, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 4343 base six.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the base six equivalent of the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\), we can perform a series of division steps by 6 and record the remainders. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **First Division:**\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - This means \\( 6 \\times 166 = 996 \\) and \\( 999 - 996 = 3 \\).\n   - The first digit (rightmost) in base six is **3**.\n\n2. **Second Division:**\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 4\n   \\]\n   - Here, \\( 6 \\times 27 = 162 \\) and \\( 166 - 162 = 4 \\).\n   - The next digit is **4**.\n\n3. **Third Division:**\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   - Calculating"
