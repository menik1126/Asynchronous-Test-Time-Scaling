            "output": "First, I recognize that the equation \\((3^k)^6 = 3^6\\) involves exponents. To simplify the left side, I'll apply the power of a power property which states that \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\).\n\nApplying this property, \\((3^k)^6\\) becomes \\(3^{6k}\\). This transforms the original equation into \\(3^{6k} = 3^6\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. Therefore, \\(6k = 6\\).\n\nFinally, solving for \\(k\\) by dividing both sides by 6, I find that \\(k = 1\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\) in the equation \\( (3^k)^6 = 3^6 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   Since the bases are the same (\\( 3 \\) in both cases), the exponents must be equal.\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
