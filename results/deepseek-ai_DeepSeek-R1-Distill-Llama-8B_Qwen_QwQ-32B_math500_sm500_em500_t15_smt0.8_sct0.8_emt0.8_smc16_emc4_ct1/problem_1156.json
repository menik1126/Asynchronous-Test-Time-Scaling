Applying this to the left side of the equation gives me \\( 3^{6k} \\).\n\nNow, the equation becomes \\( 3^{6k} = 3^6 \\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\( 6k = 6 \\).\n\nFinally, solving for \\( k \\) by dividing both sides by 6 yields \\( k = 1 \\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( k \\) in the equation \\( (3^k)^6 = 3^6 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the Exponents Equal to Each Other**:\n   Since the bases are the same (\\( 3 \\)), the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold true. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
