            "output": "To determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, I will first calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon. The hexagon has six sides, each measuring 16 cm. Therefore, the total perimeter of the hexagon is 6 multiplied by 16 cm, which equals 96 cm.\n\nSince the octagon and the hexagon have the same perimeter, the perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm. A regular octagon has eight sides, so to find the length of each side of the octagon, I will divide the total perimeter by the number of sides. This means dividing 96 cm by 8, which results in each side of the octagon being 12 cm long.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Regular Hexagon**\n\n   The hexagon has 6 sides, each with a length of 16 cm.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of Hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Sides of the Regular Octagon**\n\n   A regular octagon has 8 sides.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of sides of Octagon} = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the Length of Each Side of the Octagon**\n\n   Since the perimeters of both shapes are equal, set the perimeters equal to each other and solve for the length of one side of the octagon.\n\n   \\[\n   8 \\times \\text{Side length of Octagon} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Side length of Octagon} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nEach side of the regular octagon is \\(\\boxed{12}\\) centimeters long."
