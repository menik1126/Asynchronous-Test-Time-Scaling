            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon, which is given a side length of 16 cm.\n\nA regular hexagon has six sides of equal length, so the perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length by 6.\n\nCalculating the perimeter: 6 cm × 16 cm = 96 cm.\n\nSince the regular octagon has the same perimeter, it must also have a perimeter of 96 cm.\n\nA regular octagon consists of eight sides of equal length. To find the length of one side of the octagon, I divide the total perimeter by the number of sides.\n\nCalculating the side length of the octagon: 96 cm ÷ 8 = 12 cm.\n</think>\n\n**Question:**  \nA regular octagon has the same perimeter as the regular hexagon shown here with side length 16 cm. How long is each side of the octagon?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Understand the Given Information:**\n   - We have a regular hexagon with a side length of **16 cm**.\n   - A regular octagon has the same perimeter as this hexagon.\n\n2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   - A regular hexagon has **6** equal sides.\n   - **Perimeter of Hexagon** = Number of sides × Side length\n     \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{hexagon}} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Perimeter of the Octagon:**\n   - Since both shapes have the same perimeter:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{octagon}} = \\text{Perimeter}_{\\text{hexagon}} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Side Length of the Octagon:**\n   - A regular octagon has **8** equal sides.\n   - **Side length of Octagon** = Total Perimeter ÷ Number of sides\n     \\[\n     \\text{Side length}_{\\text{octagon}} = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{12\\, \\text{cm}}\n   \\]"
