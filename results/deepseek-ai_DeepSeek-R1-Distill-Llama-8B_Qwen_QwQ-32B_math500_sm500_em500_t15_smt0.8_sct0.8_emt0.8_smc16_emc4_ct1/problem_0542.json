Since there are 10 items, Yann has 10 possible choices for his meal.\n\nAfter Yann has chosen, Camille must select a different dish than Yann. This means Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\nTherefore, the total number of different combinations of meals they can order is 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of choices Yann has.**\n- There are 10 distinct dishes on the menu.\n- Yann can choose any one of these 10 dishes.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of choices Camille has after Yann has chosen.**\n- Since Yann and Camille refuse to order the same dish, Camille must choose from the remaining 9 dishes.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of combinations.**\n- For each of Yann's choices, Camille has 9 options.\n- Therefore, the total number of combinations is \\(10 \\times 9 = 90\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
