Plugging in the radius, the area becomes \\( \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi \\).\n\nNext, the circle with radius 6 has an area of \\( \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi \\). Similarly, the circle with radius 4 has an area of \\( \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\).\n\nNow, region X is the largest annulus, bounded by the radii 7 and 6. Its area is the difference between the areas of the largest and the middle circle: \\( 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi \\).\n\nRegion Y is the middle annulus, bounded by the radii 6 and 4. Its area is \\( 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi \\).\n\nLastly, region Z is the smallest annulus, bounded by the radii 4 and the center. Its area is \\( 16\\pi - 0 = 16\\pi \\).\n\nComparing the areas of X, Y, and Z, the largest area is \\( 13\\pi \\) and the smallest is \\( 16\\pi \\). The difference between them is \\( 13\\pi - 16\\pi = -3\\pi \\). Since the question asks for the positive difference, the final answer is \\( 3\\pi \\).\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Radii of the three concentric circles: 4, 6, and 7.\n- Regions labeled as \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), or \\(Z\\) are formed between these circles.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Area of Each Circle**\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(r\\) is the radius of the circle.\n\n**Circle with radius 7:**\n\\[\nA_{7} = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n\\]\n\n"
