So, the area of the largest circle is \\( \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi \\).\n\nNext, I consider the region labeled Z, which is the area between the circle with radius 7 and the circle with radius 6. The area of this annular region is the area of the largest circle minus the area of the circle with radius 6. This gives \\( 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi \\).\n\nThen, the area of region Y, which is between the circles with radii 6 and 4, is calculated by subtracting the area of the circle with radius 4 from the area of the circle with radius 6. This results in \\( 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi \\).\n\nFinally, the area of region X is the area of the smallest circle, which is \\( \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\).\n\nComparing the areas of the three regions:\n- Region Z has the greatest area at \\( 13\\pi \\).\n- Region X has the smallest area at \\( 16\\pi \\).\n\nTo find the difference between the greatest and smallest areas, I subtract the smallest area from the largest area: \\( 13\\pi - 16\\pi = -3\\pi \\). However, since the problem asks for the difference as a positive value, I take the absolute value, which is \\( 3\\pi \\).\n\nThus, the difference between the areas of the greatest and smallest regions is \\( 3\\pi \\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine the difference between the greatest and smallest areas among the labeled regions \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\), we'll analyze each region step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Area of the Largest Circle\nThe largest circle has a radius of \\(7\\).
