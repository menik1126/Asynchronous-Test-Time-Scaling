            "output": "Alright, so I came across this polynomial factorization problem and I thought I'd try to work through it step by step. The problem is to factor the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) into a product of monic polynomials with integer coefficients, each of which can't be factored further over the integers. Then, we need to compute the sum of the values of these polynomials at \\(x = 1\\).\n\nFirst off, I remember that often when dealing with polynomials of this form, especially ones that are symmetric or can be seen as biquadratic, substitution might help. Since the exponents are all multiples of 4, substituting \\(y = x^4\\) seems like a good idea. That would transform the original polynomial into \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). That should make it easier to handle.\n\nSo, let me define \\(y = x^4\\). Then the polynomial becomes:\n\n\\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\)\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in terms of \\(y\\). Maybe I can factor this quadratic to see if it breaks down into simpler terms. Let's try factoring:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to \\(-4\\) and add up to \\(3\\). Well, 4 and -1 come to mind because \\(4 * (-1) = -4\\) and \\(4 + (-1) = 3\\). So, we can factor it as:\n\n\\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\)\n\nSo substituting back in terms of \\(x\\), since \\(y = x^4\\), we have:\n\n\\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\)\n\nOkay, so now we have two quartic polynomials: \\(x^4 + 4\\) and \\(x^4 - 1\\). The problem is whether these quartic polynomials can be factored further into polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\), I recall that this is a difference of squares. Because \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and \\(1 = 1^2\\), so:\n\n\\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\)\n\nWait, but hold on,"

The linear terms \\(x - 1\\) and \\(x + 1\\) are irreducible, and \\(x^2 + 1\\) doesn't factor over the reals, let alone integers. So that's good.\n\nNow, moving on to the other quartic polynomial \\(x^4 + 4\\). Hmm, this looks similar to a sum of squares, but actually, it's a sum of a fourth power and a square. Wait, I remember there's a formula for factoring \\(x^4 + 4\\). Let me think. \n\nI recall that \\(x^4 + 4\\) is a special case of the sum of squares, but actually, it can be factored as a product of quadratics. Let me try to see if that's possible. Let me suppose that it factors into two quadratics with integer coefficients. Let's assume:\n\n\\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)\\)\n\nMultiplying out the right side:\n\n\\(x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd\\)\n\nComparing coefficients with \\(x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 4\\), we get the following equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(x^3\\): \\(a + c = 0\\)\n2. Coefficient of \\(x^2\\): \\(ac + b + d = 0\\)\n3. Coefficient of \\(x\\): \\(ad + bc = 0\\)\n4. Constant term: \\(bd = 4\\)\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(c = -a\\)\n\nPlugging \\(c = -a\\) into equation 3:\n\n\\(ad + b(-a) = 0 \\implies a(d - b) = "

            "output": "0\\)\n\nSimilarly, equation 2 becomes:\n\n\\(a(-a) + b + d = 0 \\implies -a^2 + b + d = 0\\)\n\nEquation 4: \\(bd = 4\\). So, possible integer pairs (b, d) can be (1,4), (2,2), (4,1), (-1,-4), (-2,-2), (-4,-1), considering both positive and negative factors since 4 is positive.\n\nLet me test these possible pairs.\n\nLet's first try with (b, d) = (2,2). Then equation 4 is satisfied. Then plug into equation 2:\n\n\\(-a^2 + 2 + 2 = 0 \\implies -a^2 +4 = 0 \\implies a^2=4 \\implies a=2 or a=-2\\).\n\nSo if a=2, then c=-2. Then check equation 3:\n\n\\(a(d - b) =2(2 -2)=0\\). So it works. Similarly, a=-2, c=2: same result.\n\nThus, the factorization is:\n\n\\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\)\n\nCheck:\n\nMultiplying them:  \n\\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 -4x^2 +4x + 2x^2 -4x +4\\)  \nCombine like terms:  \nx^4 + (-2x^3 + 2x^3) + (2x^2 -4x^2 +2x^2) + (4x -4x) +4  \nSimplify: x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 +0x +4 = x^4 +4.\n\nPerfect, that works.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\(x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 + 2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x-1)(x+1)(x^2 +1)\\"

Let's count:\n\nFrom \\(x^4 -1\\): \\(x -1, x +1, x^2 +1\\).\n\nFrom \\(x^4 +4\\): \\(x^2 + 2x +2, x^2 -2x +2\\).\n\nSo that makes 5 factors in total.\n\nWait, but the original substitution gave me two quartic factors, which in turn split into 1 quadratic and 2 linears, then another quartic into 2 quadratics, so 2 + 2 + 1? Wait, no, counting correctly:\n\nOriginal expression: \\(x^8 +3x^4 -4\\). After substituting \\(y = x^4\\), it becomes \\(y^2 + 3y -4 = (y +4)(y -1)\\), which translates to \\((x^4 +4)(x^4 -1)\\). So, two factors. \\(x^4 +4\\) factors into 2 quadratics, and \\(x^4 -1\\) factors into 2 * 2 linear terms and 1 quadratic? Wait, no, \\(x^4 -1\\) is \\((x^2 -1)(x^2 +1)\\), which is \\((x-1)(x+1)(x^2 +1)\\). So that's three factors from \\(x^4 -1\\): two linear and one quadratic. \n\nThen, the other quartic, \\(x^4 +4\\), factors into two quadratics: \\((x^2 +2x +2)\\) and \\((x^2 -2x +2)\\).

So:\n\nTotal factors are:\n\nFrom \\(x^4 +4\\): two quadratics.\n\nFrom \\(x^4 -1\\): three factors (two linear, one quadratic).\n\nSo total factors: 2 + 3 = 5.

Let me confirm that each of these can't be factored further.\n\nFirst, the linear terms \\(x -1\\) and \\(x +1\\) are obviously irreducible.\n\nThe quadratic \\(x^2 +1\\) can't be factored over integers because it has no real roots (discriminant is -4), so it's irreducible over integers.\n\nThe other two quadratics: \\(x^2 +2x +2\\) and \\(x^2 -2x +2\\). Let's check their discriminants. For \\(x^2 +2x +2\\), discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), so no real roots, so irreducible over reals, hence over integers.

So both quadratics are irreducible over integers. \n\nTherefore, the factorization is complete into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients. \n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of each \\(p_i(1)\\).
