            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to factor the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) into a product of monic, irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients. Then, I have to compute the sum of each polynomial evaluated at 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the polynomial again: \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\). It looks like an eighth-degree polynomial, so factoring it might be challenging. The problem mentions that each factor is monic, meaning their leading coefficients are 1, and they can't be factored further over the integers. So, they are irreducible.\n\nI remember that sometimes polynomials can be factored by substitution. Let me see if that's possible here. If I let \\(y = x^4\\), then the polynomial becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of y. Maybe I can factor that?\n\nLet me try to factor \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). I need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add up to 3. Let me see... 4 and -1? Because 4 * (-1) = -4 and 4 + (-1) = 3. Yes, that works! So, \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\) factors as \\((y + 4)(y - 1)\\). \n\nWait, substituting back, that's \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). So, the original polynomial factors into \\((x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\). Now, I need to see if these quartic polynomials can be factored further.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\), I know that's a difference of squares: \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - (1)^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Then, \\(x^2 - 1\\) can be factored further into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\). So, that breaks down into linear factors. Therefore, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x - 1"

Because \\(x^4\\) is \\((x^2)^2\\) and 4 is \\(2^2\\). So, maybe I can use the sum of squares formula or something else. I remember that sometimes sum of squares can be factored as \\((x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b)\\) or something similar. Let me try that.\n\nAssume \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b)\\). Multiplying these out: \n\n\\[\n(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + b) = x^4 + (2b - a^2)x^2 + b^2\n\\]\n\nComparing this to \\(x^4 + 4\\), which has no \\(x^3\\) term and no \\(x^2\\) term except for 0. So, setting up the equation:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(x^4\\) is 1, which matches.\n2. Coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is \\(2b - a^2\\), which should equal 0.\n3. Constant term is \\(b^2\\), which should equal 4.\n\nSo, let's solve for b and a. From the constant term, \\(b^2 = 4\\) gives \\(b = 2\\) or \\(b = -2\\). Let's try \\(b = 2\\) first.\n\nFrom the \\(x^2\\) term: \\(2*2 - a^2 = 0\\) implies \\(4 - a^2 = 0\\), so \\(a^2 = 4\\), therefore \\(a = 2\\) or \\(a = -2\\). So, we can write:\n\n\\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\)\n\nLet me check if that's correct. Multiply \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\):\n\nFirst, \\(x^2 * x^2 = x^4\\).\n\n"

Let me use the FOIL method for quadratics:\n\nMultiply each term: \n\n\\((x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\)\n\n= \\(x^2(x^2 - 2x + 2) + 2x(x^2 - 2x + 2) + 2(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\)\n\n= \\(x^4 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 4x + 2x^2 - 4x + 4\\)\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n- \\(x^4\\)\n- \\(-2x^3 + 2x^3 = 0\\)\n- \\(2x^2 - 4x^2 + 2x^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(4x - 4x = 0\\)\n- Constant term: 4\n\nSo, indeed, it simplifies to \\(x^4 + 4\\).

Let me double-check that. Earlier, we had \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\), and then \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). So, altogether, the factors are: \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)\\), \\((x^2"

Then, \\(x^4 -1 = (x^2 -1)(x^2 +1)\\), and \\(x^4 +4 = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)\\). So, yes, that's five factors in total, all monic, irreducible. So, no factors are missed.\n\nWait, but sometimes higher-degree polynomials can have more factors. Did I factor it completely? Since each factor is irreducible, I think that's the complete factorization.\n\nSo, yeah, it looks like the sum is 10. But just to be thorough, let me make sure none of the factors are further reducible. As I checked earlier, each quadratic has negative discriminant, hence irreducible. The linear factors are monic and can't be factored more. So, all is good.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 10.\n</think>\n\nTo factor the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\), we start by substituting \\(y = x^4\\), transforming the polynomial into a quadratic \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\)."
