I'll start by removing the parentheses since there are no operations that require them to stay in place.\n\nNext, I'll combine the like terms. The terms \\(-k\\) and \\(3k\\) are like terms, as well as the constant terms 4 and \\(-2\\). Combining \\(-k + 3k\\) gives me \\(2k\\). Combining 4 and \\(-2\\) results in \\(2\\).\n\nNow, the simplified expression is \\(2k + 2\\). This is the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\((-k + 4) + (-2 + 3k)\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Remove the parentheses** (since there are no operations that require them):\n   \n   \\[\n   -k + 4 - 2 + 3k\n   \\]\n\n2. **Combine like terms**:\n   \n   - Combine the terms with \\(k\\):\n     \\[\n     -k + 3k = 2k\n     \\]\n   \n   - Combine the constant terms:\n     \\[\n     4 - 2 = 2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Write the simplified expression**:\n   \n   \\[\n   2k + 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2k + 2}\n\\]"
