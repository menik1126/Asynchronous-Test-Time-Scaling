            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the expression \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\). The goal is to write it in the form \\(A(1+\\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C}+\\sqrt{D})\\), where \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are positive integers. Then, I have to find the sum \\(A + B + C + D\\). \n\nOkay, let me start by thinking about rationalizing the denominator. Usually, when there's a denominator with a square root, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the square root. The conjugate of \\(2 + \\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\). So, I'll try multiplying both the numerator and denominator by this conjugate.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})}{(2)^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the denominator first because that seems straightforward. The denominator will be \\(2^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2\\), which is \\(4 - 3 = 1\\). So, the denominator becomes 1, which makes things easier.\n\nNow, let's focus on the numerator. I'll need to expand the product \\((1 + \\sqrt{2})(2 - \\sqrt{3})\\). Using the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials:\n\nFirst, multiply 1 by 2, which is 2.\n\nThen, 1 multiplied by \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) multiplied by 2 is \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nLastly, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) multiplied by \\(-\\sqrt{3}\\) is \\(-\\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the numerator simplifies to \\(2 - \\"

Let me see if I can rearrange the terms I have to match that form.\n\nLooking at my numerator: \\(2 + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{6}\\).\n\nHmm, I can factor out a 2 from the first two terms, which are \\(2\\) and \\(2\\sqrt{2}\\). Let's try that:\n\n\\[\n2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\n\\]\n\nPerfect! That's exactly the form they're asking for. So, comparing this to the desired form \\(A(1 + \\sqrt{B}) - (\\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{D})\\), I can see that:\n\n- \\(A = 2\\)\n- \\(B = 2\\)\n- \\(C = 3\\)\n- \\(D = 6\\)\n\nNow, to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, I'll double-check my steps:\n\n1. Rationalized the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate \\(2 - \\sqrt{3}\\).\n2. Expanded the numerator correctly to get \\(2 - \\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}\\).\n3. Recognized that the expression can be factored into \\(2(1 + \\sqrt{2}) - (\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6})\\).\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, the values are \\(A=2\\), \\(B=2\\), \\(C=3\\), \\(D=6\\). Now, adding them together:\n\n\\(2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13\\).\n\nSo, the final answer should be 13.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying by the conjugate:\n\n\\[\n"
