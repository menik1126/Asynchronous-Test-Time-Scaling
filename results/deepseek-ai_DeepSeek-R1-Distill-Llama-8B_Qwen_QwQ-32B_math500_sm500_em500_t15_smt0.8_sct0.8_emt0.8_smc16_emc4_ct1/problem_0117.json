Each group of three bits will correspond to a single octal digit.\n\nThe binary number has eight digits, which can be divided into two groups of three bits: the first group is 101 and the second group is 010.\n\nNext, I'll convert each three-bit group to its equivalent octal value:\n- The binary 101 corresponds to the decimal number 5.\n- The binary 010 corresponds to the decimal number 2.\n\nCombining these octal digits, the binary number 10101001110 in base eight is 52.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Conversion Process**:\n   - Binary to Octal: Each octal digit corresponds to three binary digits.\n   - We'll divide the binary number into groups of three bits from the right.\n\n2. **Divide the Binary Number into Threes**:\n   ```\n   101 010 011 10\n   ```\n   - **First Group (from the right):** `110` corresponds to 6 in octal.\n   - **Second Group:** `010` corresponds to 2 in octal.\n   - **Third Group:** `101` corresponds to 5 in octal.\n   - **Fourth Group:** `010` corresponds to 2 in octal.\n\n3. **Combine the Octal Digits**:\n   ```\n   2 5 2 6\n   ```\n   Combining these, the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) is equivalent to \\(5256_{8}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5256_{8}}\n\\]"
