To do this, each digit in the binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit which is \\(2^0\\).\n\nNext, I'll write out the place values for each bit in the binary number. This will help me keep track of the corresponding power of 2 for each digit.\n\nAfter determining the place values, I'll multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2. This will give me the value of each bit in decimal form.\n\nFinally, I'll add up all the values obtained from the previous step to get the final decimal number. This will be the binary number converted into base eight.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Binary to Decimal Conversion**:\n   - Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit which is \\(2^0\\).\n\n2. **Write Out the Place Values**:\n   - The binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) has 11 digits. The places from right to left correspond to \\(2^0\\) to \\(2^{10}\\).\n\n3. **Assign Decimal Values**:\n   - Multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2.\n   - Add all the values together to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n4. **Calculate the Decimal Value**:\n   - \\[\n     1 \\times 2^{10} + 0 \\times 2^{9} + 1 \\times 2^{8} + 0 \\times 2^{7} + 1 \\times 2^{6} + 0 \\times 2^{5} + 0 \\times 2^{4} + 1 \\times 2^{3} + 1 \\times 2^{2} + 1 \\times 2^{1} + 0 \\times 2^{0}\n     \\]\n   - \\[\n     = 1024 + 0 + 256 + 0 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 1358\n     \\]\n\n5. **Convert to Base Eight**:\n   - Since \\(8 = 2^3\\), we divide the decimal number by "
