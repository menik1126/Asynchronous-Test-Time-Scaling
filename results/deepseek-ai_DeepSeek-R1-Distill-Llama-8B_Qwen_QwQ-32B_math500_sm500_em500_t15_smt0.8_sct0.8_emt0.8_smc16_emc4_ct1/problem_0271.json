I know that 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets.\n\nNext, I need to connect Blinkets to Drinkets. The problem states that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. To find how many Blinkets are in 1 Drinket, I can set up a proportion.\n\nOnce I have that, I can determine how many Trinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets by using the initial conversion rate from Trinkets to Blinkets and then from Blinkets to Drinkets.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- \\(1\\) Trinket \\(= 4\\) Blinkets\n- \\(3\\) Blinkets \\(= 7\\) Drinkets\n\n**Objective:** Find the value of \\(56\\) Drinkets in Trinkets.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Find the Equivalent of 1 Drinket in Blinkets\n\nFirst, determine how many Blinkets are in \\(1\\) Drinket.\n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ Blinkets} = 7 \\text{ Drinkets}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ Drinket} = \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Convert Blinkets to Trinkets\n\nWe know that \\(1\\) Trinket is equivalent to \\(4\\) Blinkets. Therefore, to find out how many Trinkets \\(56\\) Drinkets are worth, we first convert Drinkets to Blinkets and then Blinkets to Trinkets.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Blinkets in 56 Drinkets} = 56 \\times \\frac{3}{7} \n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Blinkets} = 56 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\text{ Blinkets}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Trinkets} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6 \\text{ Trinkets}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"
