This means that a Trinket can be exchanged for 4 Blinkets.\n\nNext, the problem states that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets. This tells me that 3 Blinkets can be traded for 7 Drinkets.\n\nTo find out the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, I'll start by determining how many Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets.\n\nSince 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets, I can set up a ratio to find the number of Blinkets in 56 Drinkets. \n\nBy dividing 56 Drinkets by 7, I get 8 Blinkets.\n\nNow that I know 56 Drinkets are equal to 8 Blinkets, I need to convert Blinkets to Trinkets.\n\nGiven that 1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets, I can find out how many Trinkets are equivalent to 8 Blinkets by dividing 8 by 4, which gives me 2 Trinkets.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are worth 2 Trinkets in the land of Ink.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationships:**\n   - **1 Trinket = 4 Blinkets**\n   - **3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets**\n\n2. **Convert Drinkets to Blinkets:**\n   - Since 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets, we can find how many Blinkets are in 1 Drinket.\n   - \\( \\frac{3 \\text{ Blinkets}}{7 \\text{ Drinkets}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ Blinket}}{\\frac{7}{3} \\text{ Drinkets}} \\)\n   - Therefore, 1 Drinket = \\( \\frac{3}{7} \\) Blinkets.\n\n3. **Calculate Blinkets for 56 Drinkets:**\n   - \\( 56 \\text{ Drinkets} \\times \\frac{3}{7} \\text{ Blinkets/Drinket} = 24 \\text{ Blinkets} \\)\n\n4. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:**\n   - Since 1 Trinket = 4 Blink"
