            "output": "To determine the length of the hallway, I need to find out how far the robot travels in 90 seconds.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the given information. The robot moves at a constant speed and covers 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. Converting 2.5 hours to seconds gives me 9000 seconds.\n\nThis means the robot's speed is 1 kilometer per 9000 seconds, or 1/9000 kilometers per second.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the distance the robot travels in 90 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time: (1/9000) km/s * 90 s = 0.01 kilometers.\n\nFinally, I'll convert 0.01 kilometers to meters since 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters. This gives me 10 meters as the length of the hallway.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given that a robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours and needs to find out how many meters long a hallway is when the robot takes 90 seconds to travel its length at the same constant speed.\n\n1. **Convert 2.5 hours to seconds:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 9000 \\text{ seconds}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Determine the speed of the robot:**\n   \n   Speed = Distance / Time\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{1 \\text{ km}}{9000 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{1}{9000} \\text{ km/s}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the length of the hallway:**\n   \n   Length = Speed \u00d7 Time\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length} = \\frac{1}{9000} \\text{ km/s} \\times 90 \\text{ seconds} = \\frac{90}{9000} \\text{ km} = 0.01 \\text{ km}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Convert kilometers to meters:**\n   \n   \\[\n   0.01 \\text{ km} \\times 1000 \\text{ meters/km} = 10 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n   \n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe hallway is \\boxed{10} meters long."
