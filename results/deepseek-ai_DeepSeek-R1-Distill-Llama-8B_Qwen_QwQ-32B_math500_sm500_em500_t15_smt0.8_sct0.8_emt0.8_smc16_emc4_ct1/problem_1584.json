Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably try to simplify both sides of the equation as much as possible. Let me look at each part separately. Starting with the left side: (x - 3)^3 and (x - 7)^3. Maybe there's a way to combine them or find a pattern. I remember that sometimes when you have similar terms cubed, you can use some formula or identity to make it easier.\n\nWait, I also notice that on the right side, it's (2x - 10)^3. Maybe I can factor that expression. Let me see, 2x - 10 is equal to 2*(x - 5), right? So, (2x - 10)^3 is the same as [2*(x - 5)]^3. That would be 2^3*(x - 5)^3, which is 8*(x - 5)^3. So, I can write the equation as:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8*(x - 5)^3.\n\nHmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, let me think about the left side. Maybe I can expand both (x - 3)^3 and (x - 7)^3 and then add them together. But expanding cubed terms can be tedious. Alternatively, I remember that a^3 + b^3 can be factored as (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe that could help?\n\nLet me try that approach. Let a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 7). Then,\n\na^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2).\n\nSo, substituting that into the equation:\n\n(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = 8*(x - 5)^3.\n\nLet me compute a + b and a^2 - ab + b^2.\n\nFirst, a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10. Oh, interesting, that"

Hmm, so the left side is (2x - 10)(x^2 - 10x + 37) and the right side is [2*(x - 5)]^3, which is 8*(x - 5)^3.\n\nWait a second, so (2x - 10) is 2*(x - 5).

Therefore, the solutions are x=7 and x=3.\n\nWait, but earlier I assumed that x ≠5 to divide by (x-5). So, I should check if x=5 is also a solution.\n\nLet me plug x=5 back into the original equation:\n\n(5 -3)^3 + (5 -7)^3 = (2*5 -10)^3.\n\nCompute left side: (2)^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0.\n\nRight side: (10 -10)^3 = 0^3 = 0.\n\nSo, 0=0, which is true.

So, that's why we have three solutions: 3,5,7.\n\nLet me double-check each solution in the original equation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, x=3:\n\nLeft side: (3-3)^3 + (3-7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 + (-64) = -64.\n\nRight side: (2*3 -10)^3 = (6-10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64.\n\nSo, it works.\n\nNext, x=5:\n\nLeft side: (5-3)^3 + (5-7)^3 = 2^3 + (-2)^3 = 8 + (-8) = 0.\n\nRight side: (10 -10)^3 = 0^3 = 0.\n\nSo, that works.\n\nx=7:\n\nLeft side: (7-3)^3 + (7-7)^3 = 4^3 + 0 = 64 + 0 = 64.\n\nRight side: (14 -10)^3 = 4^3 = 64.\n\nThat's correct as well.\n\nWait, so the roots are 3,5,7. But let me check the original equation again. Did I make a mistake in the steps?\n\nWait, in the process, I factored a^3 + b^3, then divided both sides by (x-5), which gave me a quadratic with roots 3 and7, and then I checked x=5 separately and it worked.\n\nSo, all three roots are 3,5,7.\n\nBut let me think again: when I did the substitution a = x-3, b =x-7, then a + b =2x -10. Then, a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 -ab +b^2). So, that's equal to (2x -10)(x^2 -10x +37). Then, since (2x -10) is 2(x -5), so left side becomes 2(x -5)(x²"

So, setting each factor to zero:\n\nEither x-5=0 (so x=5), or -3x² +30x -63=0, which simplifies to x² -10x +21=0, leading to x=3 and x=7. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the roots are 3,5,7. So, the answer should be those three numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the original equation is a cubic equation. Let me check the degree of the equation to see if there are more roots.\n\nWait, expanding the original equation:\n\nLeft side: (x-3)^3 + (x-7)^3. Each of those is a cubic, so adding them gives a cubic. The right side is (2x -10)^3, which is also a cubic. So, when we move everything to one side, the equation becomes a cubic equation, which can have up to three real roots. Since we found three roots, that's all of them. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let me see.\n\nAnother approach: Let me set y = x -5. Maybe substituting variables to simplify.\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let y = x -5. Then, x = y +5.\n\nSo, substituting into the original equation:\n\n(x -3)^3 + (x -7)^3 = (2x -10)^3.\n\nReplace x with y +5:\n\n(y +5 -3)^3 + (y +5 -7)^3 = (2(y +5) -10)^3.\n\nS"
