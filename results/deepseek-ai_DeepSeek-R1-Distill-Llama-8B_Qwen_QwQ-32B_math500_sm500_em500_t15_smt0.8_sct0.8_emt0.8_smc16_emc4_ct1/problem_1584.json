Hmm, at first glance, it looks a bit intimidating because of the cubes, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes when you have an equation involving cubes on both sides, it might help to expand them. So maybe I should expand each term and see if things cancel out or simplify.\n\nLet me write down each cube separately:\n\n1. \\((x - 3)^3\\): I can expand this using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\((a - b)^3\\) is \\(a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3\\). So applying that here:\n\n\\((x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\\).\n\n2. Similarly, \\((x - 7)^3\\):\n\nExpanding \\((x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\\).\n\n3. On the right side, \\((2x - 10)^3\\):\n\nLet me compute that as well. The expansion is \\((2x)^3 - 3*(2x)^2*(10) + 3*(2x)*(10)^2 - (10)^3\\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\((2x)^3 = 8x^3\\)\n- \\(3*(2x)^2*(10) = 3*4x^2*10 = 120x^2\\)\n- \\(3*(2x)*(10)^2 = 3*2x*100 = 600x\\)\n- \\((10)^3 = 1000\\)\n\nPutting it all together: \\(8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\\).\n\nNow, let me add the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) separately.\n\nFirst, LHS: \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3\\)\n\nAdding the expanded forms:\n\n\\( [x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27] + [x^"

It might be easier to work with if I factor out a common factor. Let me see if I can factor out a -6 or something. Let me check each coefficient:\n\n-6, 90, -426, 630.\n\nThey are all divisible by 6, perhaps.\n\nDivide each term by 6:\n\n\\(-6x^3 /6 = -x^3\\)\n\n90"

Let me try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (105) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1). So possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, ±21, ±35, ±105.\n\nLet me test these possible roots, starting with the smaller ones.\n\nTesting x=1:\n\n1 -15 +71 -105 = 1 -15 = -14; -14 +71=57; 57-105=-48 ≠0.\n\nx=3:\n\n27 -225 +213 -105.\n\n27-225= -198; -198+213=15; 15-105=-90 ≠0.\n\nx=5:\n\n125 - 375 +355 -105.\n\n125-375=-250; -250+355=105; 105-105=0.\n\nOkay, so x=5 is a root! That means (x-5) is a factor of the cubic polynomial.\n\nNow, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x-5).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -15 | 71 | -105\n\nDivide by (x -5), so we use 5.\n\nBring down the 1.\n\n1\n\nMultiply 1 by 5: 5, add to -15: -10.\n\nMultiply -10 by5: -50, add to 71: 21.\n\nMultiply 21 by5:105, add to -105:0.\n\nSo the cubic factors into (x -5)(x^2 -10x +21).\n\nNow, factor the quadratic: x^2 -10x +21.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to"

That makes sense because when you expand and simplify the equation, sometimes the roots remain the same. So the answer is x=3, x=5, x=7.\n\nWait, but I thought it was a cubic equation, so three roots. But in the original problem, I can see that if you set \\(y = x -5\\), maybe there's a substitution that can make this equation look like something else. Alternatively, perhaps the original equation can be thought of as \\( (a)^3 + (b)^3 = (a + b)^3\\), but I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nWait, let me think again about the original equation: \\((x -3)^3 + (x -7)^3=(2x -10)^3\\).\n\nAlternatively, notice that \\(2x -10 = 2(x -5)\\), so maybe 2 times (x-5).\n\nWait, let's try to see if there's a substitution here. Let me let y = x -5, maybe to center the equation around zero.\n\nThen, x = y +5.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nx -3 = y +5 -3 = y +2\n\nx -7 = y +5 -7 = y -2\n\n2x -10 = 2(y +5) -10 = 2y +10 -10 =2y.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(y +2)^3 + (y -2)^3 = (2y)^3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(y +2)^3 = y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8\n\n(y -2)^3 = y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8\n\nSum: (y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8) + (y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8) = 2y^3 +24y.\n\nSo equation becomes 2y^3 +24y = (2y)^3 =8y^3.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n2y^3 +24y -8y^3 = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n-6y^3"

The cubic equation had three roots, and substitution also gives three roots, so that's all.\n\nTherefore, the roots are 3,5,7. So I need to present them boxed.
