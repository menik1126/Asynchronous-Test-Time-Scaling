But maybe I can simplify it somehow. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that sometimes when you have sums of cubes, there might be a way to factor them or maybe find a substitution that makes the equation easier. Let me write down the equation again to see it clearly:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3.\n\nHmm, I notice that on the right side, the expression inside the cube is (2x - 10). Wait a second, (2x - 10) is just 2 times (x - 5), right? Because 2*(x - 5) = 2x - 10. So maybe that's useful. Let me write that:\n\n(2x - 10)^3 = [2(x - 5)]^3 = 8(x - 5)^3.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = 8(x - 5)^3.\n\nHmm, that might be helpful. Now, looking at the left side, I have two cubes being added. I wonder if they can be expanded and then combined. Let me try expanding each term one by one.\n\nFirst, expanding (x - 3)^3. I remember the formula for (a - b)^3 is a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3. So applying that:\n\n(x - 3)^3 = x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27.\n\nNext, expanding (x - 7)^3. Similarly, that's (a - b)^3 where a = x and b = 7:\n\n(x - 7)^3 = x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343.\n\nNow, adding these two together:\n\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343).\n\n"

Let me expand that as well.\n\nExpanding (x - 5)^3: x^3 - 15x^2 + 75x - 125.\n\nMultiplying by 8:\n\n8(x - 5)^3 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.\n\nSo putting it all together, the equation now is:\n\n2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000.\n\nHmm, okay, let's bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero. Subtract the left side from both sides:\n\n0 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000 - (2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370).\n\nSimplify the subtraction:\n\n8x^3 - 2x^3 = 6x^3.\n\n-120x^2 - (-30x^2) = -90x^2.\n\n600x - 174x = 426x.\n\n-1000 - (-370) = -630.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n6x^3 - 90x^2 + 426x - 630 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a cubic equation. Maybe I can factor out a common factor. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the coefficients 6, 90, 426, 630. They all seem divisible by 6, 3, or maybe 2. Let's try 6.\n\nDividing each term by 6:\n\n6x^3/6 = x^3.\n\n-90x^2/6 = -15x^2.\n\n426x/6 = 71x.\n\n-630/6 = -105.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\nx^3 - 15x^2 + 71"

The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (105) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1). So possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, etc.\n\nLet me test x=3 first:\n\n3^3 - 15*3^2 + 71*3 - 105 = 27 - 135 + 213 - 105.\n\nCalculating: 27 - 135 = -108; -108 + 213 = 105; 105 - 105 = 0.\n\nOh, x=3 is a root! Great, so (x - 3) is a factor.\n\nNow, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 3) from the cubic equation.\n\nLet me use synthetic division:\n\nDivide x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 by (x - 3).\n\nSet up the coefficients: 1 | -15 | 71 | -105.\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 3: 3. Add to -15: -12.\n\nMultiply -12 by 3: -36. Add to 71: 35.\n\nMultiply 35 by 3: 105. Add to -105: 0.\n\nSo, the quotient polynomial is x^2 - 12x + 35.\n\nThus, the cubic factors as (x - 3)(x^2 - 12x + 35) = 0.\n\nNow, I can factor the quadratic: x^2 - 12x + 35.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12. Those numbers are -5 and -7.\n\nSo, x^2 - 12x + 35 = (x - 5)(x - 7).\n\nTherefore, the equation factors completely as (x - 3)(x - 5)(x - 7) = 0.\n\nThus, the roots are x = 3, x = 5, and x = 7.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check if these roots satisfy the original equation.
