Hmm, that's a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that expanding cubes can be a bit tedious, but maybe there's a smarter way. I recall something called the formula for the sum of cubes, but wait, that's usually for two cubes. The equation here has three cubes, so that might not directly apply. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to find a substitution that simplifies the equation.\n\nLooking at the terms, I notice that (x - 3) and (x - 7) are both linear expressions. Also, on the right side, we have (2x - 10). Hmm, 2x - 10 looks like it might be related to the sum or difference of (x - 3) and (x - 7). Let me check:\n\nLet's compute (x - 3) + (x - 7). That gives 2x - 10. Oh, interesting! So, (x - 3) + (x - 7) equals 2x - 10, which is exactly the term on the right side of the equation. That seems like a useful connection.\n\nNow, I remember that there's an identity for the sum of two cubes: a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). If I can rewrite the left side of the equation using this identity, maybe it will simplify things.\n\nSo, let me set a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 7). Then, the left side becomes a^3 + b^3, which is equal to (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). We already know that a + b = 2x - 10, so the left side is (2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2). The equation becomes:\n\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3\n\nHmm, so if I move everything to one side, I get:\n\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) - (2x -"
