These are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\nNext, I'll identify which of these prime numbers are odd. Since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd, I can include all primes except 2 in the intersection.\n\nFinally, I'll count the number of these odd primes to determine how many elements are in the intersection.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine the number of elements in the intersection of the set of all prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all odd numbers greater than zero.\n\n### Step 1: List of Prime Numbers Less Than 30\n\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime numbers less than 30 are:\n\n\\[ 2, \\, 3, \\, 5, \\, 7, \\, 11, \\, 13, \\, 17, \\, 19, \\, 23, \\, 29 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify Odd Numbers in the Prime List\n\nAlmost all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd because even numbers greater than 2 are divisible by 2 and hence not prime. The only even prime number is 2.\n\nSo, the prime numbers less than 30 that are odd are:\n\n\\[ 3, \\, 5, \\, 7, \\, 11, \\, 13, \\, 17, \\, 19, \\, 23, \\, 29 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of Odd Primes Less Than 30\n\nCounting the listed odd primes:\n\n- 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n\nThere are **9** prime numbers less than 30 that are odd.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
