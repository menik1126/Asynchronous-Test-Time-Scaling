Each of them wants to order one dish, but they don't want to order the same item. Additionally, it matters who orders what, meaning the order matters.\n\nSo, I need to find out how many different meal combinations they can have under these conditions.\n\nI'll start by considering all possible ways they can order without any restrictions. If there are 10 menu items and two people, Yann can choose any of the 10 items. Once Yann has chosen, Camille can choose any of the remaining 9 items. Therefore, the total number of unrestricted combinations is 10 multiplied by 9, which is 90.\n\nHowever, the problem states that they refuse to order the same dish. This means we need to subtract the scenarios where both Yann and Camille order the same dish. If we consider the case where both choose the same item, there are 10 such possibilities (both choosing dish 1, both choosing dish 2, and so on). Therefore, we subtract these 10 identical combinations from the total.\n\nSo, the total number of valid combinations where they order different dishes is 90 minus 10, which equals 80.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me double-check my reasoning. If Yann has 10 choices, and for each of Yann's choices, Camille has 9 remaining choices to avoid duplication, then indeed 10 × 9 should be 90. Subtracting the 10 cases where they choose the same dish gives us 80. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using permutations since the order matters. The number of permutations of 10 items taken 2 at a time is calculated as 10 × 9, which is 90. But since we need them to order different dishes, we subtract the 10 cases where both choose the same item, leaving us with 80 valid combinations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 80 different meal combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order without selecting the same dish, we can use the concept of permutations.\n\n1. **Total permutations without restriction**: There are 10 menu items, and each person can choose any item. Since the order matters (Yann and Camille are distinct), the total number of possible orders is"

Thus, the number of invalid combinations is:\n   \\[\n   10\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Valid combinations**: Subtract the invalid cases from the total permutations:\n   \\[\n   100 - 10 = 90\n   \\]\n   \nHowever, this approach overcounts. A more straightforward method is to consider that once Yann chooses a dish (10 options), Camille must choose a different one (9 options). Thus:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 9 = 90\n   \\]\n   \nThis directly gives the valid combinations without needing subtraction. The confusion in the first approach arises from misapplying the subtraction step. The correct answer is indeed 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
