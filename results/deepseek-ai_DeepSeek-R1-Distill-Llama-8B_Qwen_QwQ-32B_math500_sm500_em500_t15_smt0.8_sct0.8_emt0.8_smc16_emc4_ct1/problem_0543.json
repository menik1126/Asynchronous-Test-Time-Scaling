Yann and Camille order different dishes.\n2. Yann and Camille order the same dish.\n\nFor the first scenario, Yann has 10 choices, and for each of Yann's choices, Camille has 9 remaining choices. This results in 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90 possible combinations.\n\nFor the second scenario, there is only 1 combination where both order the exact same dish.\n\nAdding both scenarios together, the total number of unique combinations is 90 plus 1, totaling 91.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Total Dishes on the Menu:** 10\n\n**Conditions:**\n1. Yann and Camille each order one dish.\n2. They refuse to order the same dish.\n3. The order matters (i.e., Yann ordering Chicken and Camille ordering Fish is different from Yann ordering Fish and Camille ordering Chicken).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of possible choices for Yann.**\n- Yann has **10** choices since there are 10 dishes available.\n\n**Step 2: For each of Yann's choices, determine Camille's possible choices.**\n- After Yann has chosen a dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish. Therefore, Camille has **9** remaining choices.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of ordered combinations.**\n- Since Yann and Camille's choices are independent, multiply Yann's choices by Camille's choices:\n  \n  \\[\n  10 \\text{ choices for Yann} \\times 9 \\text{ choices for Camille} = 90 \\text{ combinations}\n  \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
