I need to find \\(\\tan A\\). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be expressed using the formula involving sine of one of its angles. Specifically, the area is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A\\). That seems familiar. So, maybe I can set that equal to the expression given in the problem.\n\nThe problem states that the area is \\(a^2 - (b - c)^2\\). Let me write that down:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = a^2 - (b - c)^2\n\\]\n\nOn the other hand, from the standard area formula, I have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A\n\\]\n\nSince both expressions represent the area of the same triangle, I can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = a^2 - (b - c)^2\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I need to simplify the right side of this equation. Let me expand \\((b - c)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(b - c)^2 = b^2 - 2bc + c^2\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting that back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\n\nHmm, let's rearrange the terms on the right side. I notice that \\(a^2\\) is part of the expression, and I also remember the Law of Cosines, which states that:\n\n\\[\na^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A\n\\]\n\nMaybe I can substitute this into the equation. Let me try that:\n\nSo, replacing \\(a^2\\) with \\(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{"

The right side is \\(a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\\), so substituting \\(a^2\\):\n\n\\[\na^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\n\nNow, simplifying this:\n\nFirst, distribute the negative sign into the parentheses:\n\n\\[\nb^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n- \\(b^2 - b^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(c^2 - c^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(-2bc \\cos A\\) remains\n- \\(2bc\\) is the remaining term.\n\nSo, the entire right side simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-2bc \\cos A + 2bc\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2bc(1 - \\cos A)\n\\]\n\nSo now, going back to the earlier equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = 2bc(1 - \\cos A)\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. Let me see. I can divide both sides by \\(bc\\) since \\(bc \\neq 0\\) (they are sides of a triangle). So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sin A = 2(1 - \\cos A)\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = 4(1 - \\cos A)\n\\]\n\nHmm, so:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = 4 - 4\\cos A\n\\]\n\nI need to find \\(\\tan A\\), which is \\(\\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A}\\). So, maybe I can express this equation in terms of \\(\\tan A\\).\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A + 4\\cos A = 4\n\\]\n\nHmm, this looks similar to the form \\(A \\sin x + B \\cos x"

But I'm not sure if that's the best way to go here.\n\nAlternatively, I can square both sides to utilize the Pythagorean identity. But wait, squaring both sides might introduce extraneous solutions, so I have to be careful later.\n\nLet me try squaring both sides:\n\nLeft side squared:\n\n\\[\n(\\sin A + 4\\cos A)^2 = \\sin^2 A + 8\\sin A \\cos A + 16\\cos^2 A\n\\]\n\nRight side squared:\n\n\\[\n4^2 = 16\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 A + 8\\sin A \\cos A + 16\\cos^2 A = 16\n\\]\n\nNow, using the identity \\(\\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1\\), we can substitute:\n\n\\[\n(1) + 8\\sin A \\cos A + 15\\cos^2 A = 16\n\\]\nWait, is that right?

Since I need to find \\(\\tan A\\), let me denote \\(t = \\tan A\\). Then, \\(\\sin A = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1 + t^2}}\\) and \\(\\cos A = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + t^2}}\\).

Let me do that:\n\nLeft side: \\((t + 4)^2 = t^2 + 8t + 16\\)\n\nRight side: \\((4\\sqrt{1 + t^2})^2 = 16(1 + t^2) = 16 + 16t^2\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nt^2 + 8t + 16 = 16 + 16t^2\n\\]\n\nSubtract 16 from both sides:\n\n\\[\nt^2 + 8t = 16t^2\n\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n0 = 16t^2 - t^2 - 8t\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = 15t^2 - 8t\n\\]\n\nFactor out a t:\n\n\\[\n0 = t(15t - 8)\n\\]\n\nSo, the solutions are t = 0 or t = 8/15.\n\nBut t = \\tan A, and in a triangle, angle A cannot be 0 or 180 degrees, so t cannot be 0. Therefore, the solution is t = 8/15.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to verify if this solution satisfies the original equation because we squared both sides earlier, which can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nSo, let's plug t = 8/15 back into the equation:\n\nFrom earlier, we had:\n\n\\[\nt + 4 = 4\\sqrt{"

Let me think again. I started with the area being \\(a^2 - (b - c)^2\\). Let me verify if this can actually happen. Because the area is also given by Heron's formula, which might complicate things, but perhaps it's better to check if the given area is positive.\n\nSo, \\(a^2 - (b - c)^2\\) must be positive because the area can't be negative.\n\nCompute \\(a^2 - (b - c)^2\\):\n\n\\[\na^2 - (b - c)^2 = a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines, \\(a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A\\), so substituting that:\n\n\\[\n(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 = -2bc \\cos A + 2bc\n\\]\n\nWhich is \\(2bc(1 - \\cos A)\\), which is positive if \\(1 - \\cos A > 0\\), which is true as long as angle A is not 0 or 180 degrees, which is the case.\n\nSo, the area as given is positive, which makes sense.\n\nHence, the solution \\(\\tan A = 8/15\\) seems valid.\n\nAlternatively, is there another way to approach this problem? Let me think.\n\nStarting from \\(\\sin A = 4(1 - \\cos A)\\), I can express this as:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A + 4\\cos A = 4\n\\]\n\nAnd then maybe use the identity \\(R \\sin(A +"
