            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where the area of triangle ABC is given by the formula a² - (b - c)², and I need to find tan A. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the area of a triangle can also be expressed in terms of two sides and the sine of the included angle. So, the standard formula is (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Maybe I can set that equal to the given area and solve for sin A first.\n\nAlright, so let me write that down. The area is a² - (b - c)², and it's also equal to (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So,\n\na² - (b - c)² = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nNow, I can expand the left side. Let me do that step by step to avoid mistakes. The expression a² - (b - c)² is a difference of squares, so it should factor into (a - (b - c))(a + (b - c)). Let me compute that:\n\n(a - (b - c))(a + (b - c)) = (a - b + c)(a + b - c).\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe there's another way to expand (b - c)². Let me just expand it directly:\n\n(b - c)² = b² - 2b*c + c².\n\nSo, a² - (b² - 2b*c + c²) = a² - b² + 2b*c - c².\n\nSo, the area is a² - b² + 2b*c - c². Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think about Heron's formula or maybe the law of cosines. Since we're dealing with tan A, which involves the sides of the triangle and the angle, the law of cosines could be helpful.\n\nYes, the law of cosines says that a² = b² + c² - 2b*c*cos A. Maybe I can use that to relate a² with b and c. Let me write that down:\n\na² = b² + c² - 2b*c*cos A.\n\nSo, substituting this into the area expression, which is a² - (b - c)², we get:\n\n(b² + c² - 2"

First, expand (b - c)^2 again:\n\n(b - c)^2 = b² - 2b*c + c².\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\n(b² + c² - 2b*c*cos A) - (b² - 2b*c + c²) = [b² + c² - 2b*c*cos A] - b² + 2b*c - c².\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nb² - b² cancels out, c² - c² cancels out. So we have:\n\n-2b*c*cos A + 2b*c.\n\nSo, the area becomes 2b*c*(1 - cos A).\n\nTherefore, the area is 2b*c*(1 - cos A). But we also know the area is equal to (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, setting them equal:\n\n2b*c*(1 - cos A) = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nHmm, okay, so let's see. Let me divide both sides by b*c (assuming b and c are not zero, which they can't be in a triangle). So:\n\n2*(1 - cos A) = (1/2)*sin A.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4*(1 - cos A) = sin A.\n\nSo, 4 - 4cos A = sin A.\n\nHmm, now I need to solve for A here. Let me think. Maybe express everything in terms of sin and cos, and then use some trigonometric identities. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\nsin A + 4cos A = 4.\n\nHmm, this looks like an equation of the form sin A + k cos A = m. Maybe I can write this as a single sine function. The formula is that sin A + k cos A = sqrt(1 + k²) sin(A + φ), where φ is some phase shift. Alternatively, maybe square both sides? Although that might introduce extraneous solutions, but let's try.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote tan A = t, so that sin A = t / sqrt(1 + t²) and cos A = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²). Wait, but maybe that's a bit involved. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me rearr"

Let me see if I can express this in terms of tan A.\n\nLet me divide the entire equation by cos²A (assuming cos A ≠ 0, which it can't be in a triangle since A is between 0 and 180, so cos A isn't zero).\n\nSo,\n\n15 + 8 tan A = 15 / cos²A.\n\nBut 1/cos²A is sec²A, which is 1 + tan²A.\n\nSo,\n\n15 + 8 tan A = 15*(1 + tan²A).\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n15 + 8 tan A = 15 + 15 tan²A.\n\nSubtract 15 from both sides:\n\n8 tan A = 15 tan²A.\n\nBring everything to one side:\n\n15 tan²A - 8 tan A = 0.\n\nFactor:\n\ntan A (15 tan A - 8) = 0.\n\nSo, tan A = 0 or 15 tan A - 8 = 0.\n\nBut tan A = 0 would imply A = 0 or 180 degrees, which is impossible for a triangle. So, we discard tan A = 0.\n\nThus, 15 tan A - 8 = 0 => tan A = 8 / 15.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me"

Then sin A + 4 cos A = 4.\n\nSquared both sides: sin²A + 8 sin A cos A + 16 cos²A = 16.\n\nSince sin²A = 1 - cos²A, substituted:\n\n1 - cos²A + 8 sin A cos A + 16 cos²A = 16.\n\nWhich simplifies to 1 + 15 cos²A + 8 sin A cos A = 16.\n\nThen 15 cos²A + 8 sin A cos A = 15.\n\nDivided by cos²A: 15 + 8 tan A = 15 /.

Discarded tan A = 0, so tan A = 8/15.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Let me just check if substituting tan A = 8/15 into the original equation works.\n\nSo, tan A = 8/15, so sin A = 8 / sqrt(8² + 15²) = 8 / sqrt(64 + 225) = 8 / sqrt(289) = 8 / 17.\n\nSimilarly, cos A = 15 / 17.\n\nSo, let's compute sin A + 4 cos A.\n\nThat would be 8/17 + 4*(15/17) = 8/17 + 60/17 = 68/17 = 4.
