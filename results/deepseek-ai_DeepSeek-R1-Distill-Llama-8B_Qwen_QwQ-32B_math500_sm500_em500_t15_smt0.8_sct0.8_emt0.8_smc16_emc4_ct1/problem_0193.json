I remember that for finding integer roots, the Rational Root Theorem is useful. It says that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms \\(p/q\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient. \n\nLooking at the equation, the constant term is -14, and the leading coefficient is 1. So, the possible values for \\(p\\) are the factors of -14, which are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\). Since \\(q\\) is 1, the possible rational roots are just these numbers themselves. So, the potential integer roots are 1, -1, 2, -2, 7, -7, 14, -14.\n\nNow, I need to test these values one by one to see if they satisfy the equation. Let's start with the smaller absolute values because they're easier to calculate and might be roots.\n\nFirst, let me test \\(x = 1\\):\n\\(1^4 + 5*1^3 + 9*1^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 -14 = 1 + 5 is 6, 6 + 9 is 15, 15 -1 is 14, 14 -14 is 0. Oh, so 1 is a root!\n\nGreat, so (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. Now, I can perform polynomial division to factor it out. Let me do that.\n\nI'll use synthetic division with root 1.\n\nSet up the coefficients: 1 (for \\(x^4\\)), 5 (for \\(x^3\\)), 9 (for \\(x^2\\)), -1 (for \\(x\\)), and -14 (constant term).\n\nBring down the 1. Multiply by 1: 1. Add to next coefficient: 5 + 1 = 6. Multiply by 1: 6. Add to next coefficient: 9 + 6 = 15. Multiply by 1: 15. Add to next coefficient: -1 +"

Perfect, so no remainder.\n\nSo, after factoring out (x - 1), the polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\).\n\nNow, I need to factor this cubic polynomial. Let's again use the Rational Root Theorem on it. The constant term is 14, leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \\(\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14\\).\n\nTest x=1: \\(1 + 6 + 15 +14 = 1+6=7, 7+15=22, 22+14=36. Not zero.\n\nTest x=-1: \\(-1 + 6*(-1)^2 + 15*(-1) +14 = -1 + 6 -15 +14 = (-1 +6)=5, (5 -15)=-10, (-10 +14)=4. Not zero.\n\nTest x=2: \\(8 + 24 + 30 +14 = 8+24=32, 32+30=62, 62+14=76. Not zero.\n\nTest x=-2: \\(-8 + 24 -30 +14 = (-8 +24)=16, (16 -30)=-14, (-14 +14)=0. Oh, so x = -2 is a root!\n\nSo, another factor is (x + 2). Let's perform synthetic division on the cubic polynomial with root -2.\n\nCoefficients: 1, 6, 15, 14.\n\nBring down the 1. Multiply by -2: 1*(-2)= -2. Add to next coefficient: 6 + (-2)=4. Multiply by -2: 4*(-2)= -8. Add to next coefficient:15 + (-8)=7. Multiply by -2:7*(-2)= -14. Add to last coefficient:14 + (-14)=0. Perfect.\n\nSo, after factoring out (x + 2), the quadratic polynomial is \\(x^2 + 4x + 7\\).\n\nNow, I need to factor this quadratic or use the quadratic formula. Let's check the discriminant: \\(b^2 -4ac = 16 - 28 = -"

Therefore, this quadratic doesn't factor into real numbers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as \\((x - 1)(x + 2)(x^2 + 4x + 7)\\).
