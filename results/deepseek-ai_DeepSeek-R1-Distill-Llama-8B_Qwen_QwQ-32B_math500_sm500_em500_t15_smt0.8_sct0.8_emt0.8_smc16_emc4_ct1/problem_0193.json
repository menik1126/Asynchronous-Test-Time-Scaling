            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: \\(x^4 + 5x^3 + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0\\). I need to find all the integer roots. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about the Rational Root Theorem, which might help here. \n\nThe Rational Root Theorem says that any possible rational root of the polynomial equation \\(a_nx^n + \\dots + a_0 = 0\\) is of the form \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) is a factor of the constant term \\(a_0\\) and \\(q\\) is a factor of the leading coefficient \\(a_n\\). In this case, my equation is a quartic (degree 4), and the leading coefficient is 1. That means \\(q\\) is 1, so all possible rational roots are integers that divide the constant term, which is -14. \n\nSo, let's list the integer factors of -14. They are the factors of 14, both positive and negative. The factors of 14 are 1, 2, 7, and 14. So the possible integer roots could be \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14 \\). I can also check if zero is a root, but plugging in zero gives 0 + 0 - 0 - 0 -14 = -14 \u2260 0, so zero isn't a root.\n\nNow, I should test each of these possible roots by substituting them into the equation and seeing if the result is zero. Let me start with the easier ones. Let's try \\(x = 1\\):\n\nPlugging in 1: \\(1^4 + 5*1^3 + 9*1^2 - 1 -14 = 1 + 5 + 9 -1 -14 = (1 +5) + (9 -1) -14 = 6 + 8 -14 = 14 -14 = 0\\). Oh, so 1 is a root! That's good. That means (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. \n\nNow, I can perform polynomial division or synthetic division to factor out (x - 1) from the quartic. Let me try synthetic division because it's usually faster. So, set up synthetic division"

Multiply 15 by 1: 15. Add to -1: 14. Multiply 14 by 1:14. Add to -14:0. So, the result is \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14\\). So, now I have:\n\n\\[(x - 1)(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14) = 0\\]\n\nNext, I need to find the roots of the cubic: \\(x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 14 = 0\\). Let me apply the Rational Root Theorem again on this cubic. The constant term is 14, and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14 \\).\n\nTesting x = -1: \\((-1)^3 + 6*(-1)^2 + 15*(-1) + 14 = -1 + 6 -15 +14 = (-1 +6) + (-15 +14) = 5 -1 =4 \u22600\\). Not a root.\n\nTesting x = -2: \\((-2)^3 +6*(-2)^2 +15*(-2) +14 = -8 + 24 -30 +14 = (-8 +24) + (-30 +14) =16 -16=0. Oh, so x=-2 is a root. That means (x + 2) is a factor.\n\nNow, I can perform synthetic division again on the cubic with root -2:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (x^3), 6 (x^2), 15 (x), 14 (constant).\n\nBring down 1. Multiply by -2: -2. Add to 6:4. Multiply by -2: -8. Add to 15:7. Multiply by -2: -14. Add to 14:0.\n\nSo the result is \\(x^2 + 4x"

We've found x=1 and x=-2 are roots. The other two roots come from \\(x^2 +4x +7 =0\\). Let's solve this quadratic equation.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: \\(x = [-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 -4ac}]/(2a)\\). Here, a=1, b=4, c=7.\n\nSo discriminant is \\(16 -28 = -12\\). The discriminant is negative, so the roots are complex: \\((-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-12})/2 = -2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}i\\). But since we are only looking for integer roots, these complex roots don't count. So, the only integer roots are x=1 and x=-2.\n\nLet me double-check by plugging x=-2 into the original equation to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nPlugging in x=-2: \\[(-2)^4 +5*(-2)^3 +9*(-2)^2 -(-2) -14 =16 +5*(-8)+9*4 +2 -14\\]\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n16 + (-40) + 36 +2 -14.\n\n16-40 = -24; -24 +36=12; 12+2=14; 14-14=0. Yes, it works.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't miss any other integer roots, let me test another possible value, say x=2.\n\nPlug in x=2: \\(2^4 +5*2^3 +9*2^2 -2 -14=16 +40 +36 -2 -14\\).\n\nAdd up: 16+40=56; 56+36=92; 92-2=90; 90-14=76\u22600. So x=2 isn't a root.\n\nHow about x= -1? Let's try.\n\nPlugging in x=-1: \\[(-1)^4 +5*(-1)^3 +9*(-1)^2 -(-1) -14 = 1 -"
