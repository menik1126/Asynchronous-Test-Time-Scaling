            "output": "I need to determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196.\n\nFirst, I'll perform prime factorization on 196. Dividing by 2, I get 98. Dividing 98 by 2 again, I get 49. Since 49 is 7 squared, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared and 7 squared.\n\nNext, I'll use the exponent rule for divisors, which involves adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying these results. So, (2 + 1) multiplied by (2 + 1) equals 3 times 3, which is 9.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 196:**\n   \n   To find the number of divisors of a number, we first perform its prime factorization.\n\n   \\[\n   196 \\div 2 = 98 \\\\\n   98 \\div 2 = 49 \\\\\n   49 \\div 7 = 7 \\\\\n   7 \\div 7 = 1\n   \\]\n\n   So, the prime factors of 196 are:\n   \n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Using the Exponent Rule for Divisors:**\n   \n   If a number \\( N \\) has the prime factorization \\( N = p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^{k} \\), the total number of positive divisors is given by:\n   \n   \\[\n   (a + 1)(b + 1)\\ldots(k + 1)\n   \\]\n   \n   Applying this to our prime factorization:\n   \n   \\[\n   (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   Therefore, 196 has **9** positive whole-number divisors.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{9}"
