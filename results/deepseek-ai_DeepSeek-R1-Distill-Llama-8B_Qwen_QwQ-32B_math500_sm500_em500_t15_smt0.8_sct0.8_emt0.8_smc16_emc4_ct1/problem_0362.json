            "output": "To solve the problem, I'll start by defining the initial quantities of blue and yellow marbles.\n\nLet’s assume there are \\( b \\) blue marbles and \\( y \\) yellow marbles in the bag before any changes.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that:\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{y} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\nFrom this equation, I can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[\nb = \\frac{4}{3}y\n\\]\nNext, the problem states that if 5 blue marbles are added and 3 yellow marbles are removed, the new ratio becomes 7:3. After these changes, the number of blue marbles is \\( b + 5 \\) and the number of yellow marbles is \\( y - 3 \\). Therefore:\n\\[\n\\frac{b + 5}{y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fractions, I'll cross-multiply:\n\\[\n3(b + 5) = 7(y - 3)\n\\]\nExpanding both sides:\n\\[\n3b + 15 = 7y - 21\n\\]\nNow, I'll substitute \\( b = \\frac{4}{3}y \\) into the equation:\n\\[\n3\\left(\\frac{4}{3}y\\right) + 15 = 7y - 21\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n4y + 15 = 7y - 21\n\\]\nTo isolate \\( y \\), I'll subtract \\( 4y \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n15 = 3y - 21\n\\]\nThen, add 21 to both sides:\n\\[\n36 = 3y\n\\]\nFinally, divide by 3 to find \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = 12\n\\]\nWith \\( y = 12 \\), I can find \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 12 = 16\n\\]\nTherefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before any changes were made.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's denote:\n- Initial number of blue marbles as \\( b \\)\n- Initial number of yellow marbles as \\( y \\)\n\n1."
