            "output": "First, I'll define variables for the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let B represent the blue marbles and Y represent the yellow marbles.\n\nGiven that the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3, I can set up the equation B/Y = 4/3, which means 3B = 4Y.\n\nNext, after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3. This gives the equation (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3, leading to 3(B + 5) = 7(Y - 3).\n\nNow, I'll solve these two equations simultaneously. From the first equation, B = (4/3)Y. Substituting this into the second equation, I get 3((4/3)Y + 5) = 7(Y - 3). Simplifying this, 4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21, which results in Y = 12.\n\nFinally, substituting Y = 12 back into B = (4/3)Y, I find that B = 16. So, there were initially 16 blue marbles in the bag.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = initial number of blue marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = initial number of yellow marbles\n\n**Given:**\n1.
