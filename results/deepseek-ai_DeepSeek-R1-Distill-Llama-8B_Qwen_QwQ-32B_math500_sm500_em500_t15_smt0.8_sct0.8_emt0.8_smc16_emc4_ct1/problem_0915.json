            "output": "To find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime factors.\n\n84 can be expressed as 2 multiplied by 42. Breaking down 42 further, I get 2 × 3 × 7. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, and 7.\n\nNext, I'll combine these prime factors into distinct integers. I need to create numbers that multiply together to give 84 without repeating any number. One effective way is to use 2 × 7, which equals 14, and keep the other factors as they are: 2, 3, and 14. This gives me the numbers 2, 3, and 14.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the sum of these integers: 2 + 3 + 14 = 19. This is the smallest possible sum of distinct positive integers that have a product of 84.\n</think>\n\nTo find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize 84 into its prime factors.\n\\[ 84 = 2 \\times 42 \\]\n\\[ 42 = 2 \\times 21 \\]\n\\[ 21 = 3 \\times 7 \\]\nSo, the prime factorization of 84 is:\n\\[ 84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Combine the prime factors into distinct integers.\nTo minimize the sum, we want to create the largest possible factors while keeping the number of distinct integers as few as possible. \n\n- Combine 2 and 7 to form 14.\n- Keep the remaining factors as they are: 2 and 3.\n\nSo, the distinct integers are:\n\\[ 2, 3, 14 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the sum of these integers.\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 14 = 19\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe least possible sum of these integers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{19}\n\\]"
