            "output": "To find the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, I'll start by factoring 84 into its prime components.\n\nFirst, 84 can be divided by 2, giving me 42. Dividing 42 by 2 again results in 21. Next, I'll break down 21 into 3 and 7, both of which are prime numbers. So, the prime factorization of 84 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nNow, to form distinct positive integers from these prime factors, I'll aim to create the largest possible numbers while minimizing their count. \n\nStarting with the largest prime, I'll multiply 7 by 3 to get 21. Then, I'll use the remaining 2\u00b2 to form 2 and 4 (since 2 \u00d7 2 = 4). However, having 2, 4, and 21 might not give the smallest sum. \n\nAlternatively, I'll try a different combination by using 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 and keeping 7 as is. This gives me the numbers 6 and 7, and I'll use the remaining 2 as a single number. So, the integers would be 2, 6, and 7. \n\nCalculating the sum: 2 + 6 + 7 equals 15. To ensure this is the smallest possible sum, I'll compare it with other potential sets of numbers derived from the prime factors. For example, if I use 2, 3, 4, and 7, the sum would be 16, which is higher than 15. \n\nTherefore, the minimum sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84 is 15, achieved by the set {2, 6, 7}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84 into its prime components:**\n   \\[\n   84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the prime factors and determine possible integers:**\n   - We need to form distinct integers from these prime factors.\n   - Aim to use larger factors to minimize the number of integers.\n\n3. **Construct the integers:**\n   - **Option 1:** \\( 21 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2, "
