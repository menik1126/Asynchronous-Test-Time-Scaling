            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where the area of triangle ABC is given by the formula a² - (b - c)², and I need to compute tan A. Hmm, let me start by recalling some basic formulas related to triangles.\n\nFirst off, the area of a triangle can be expressed in several ways. The most common one is (1/2)*base*height, but I also remember that if you know two sides and the included angle, the area can be written using the formula (1/2)*b*c*sin A, where A is the angle between sides b and c. Maybe that's useful here.\n\nAnother formula I know for the area is Heron's formula, which uses the semi-perimeter. But I don't know if that will be helpful immediately. Let me write down what I have:\n\nArea = a² - (b - c)².\n\nI need to relate this to the known area formulas. Hmm, maybe if I expand the right-hand side, it will simplify somehow.\n\nExpanding (b - c)² gives me b² - 2bc + c², so the area becomes:\n\nArea = a² - (b² - 2bc + c²) = a² - b² + 2bc - c².\n\nSo, Area = a² - b² - c² + 2bc.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. Now, the area is expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle. I wonder if I can relate this to the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines says that a² = b² + c² - 2bc*cos A. Let me write that down:\n\na² = b² + c² - 2bc*cos A.\n\nIf I substitute this into the area expression, maybe something will cancel out or become more manageable.\n\nSo substituting a² into Area:\n\nArea = (b² + c² - 2bc*cos A) - b² - c² + 2bc.\n\nSimplifying this:\n\nArea = b² + c² - 2bc*cos A - b² - c² + 2bc.\n\nNow, the b² and c² terms cancel out:\n\nArea = -2bc*cos A + 2bc.\n\nFactor out the 2bc:\n\nArea = 2bc*(1 - cos A).\n\nHmm, okay. So the area is also equal to 2bc*(1"

Let me set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 2bc*(1 - cos A).\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me write that equation again:\n\n(1/2) b c sin A = 2 b c (1 - cos A)\n\nFirst, I can divide both sides by b c, assuming b and c are not zero, which they can't be in a triangle.\n\nSo:\n\n(1/2) sin A = 2 (1 - cos A)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\nsin A = 4 (1 - cos A)\n\nHmm, so now I have an equation involving sin A and cos A. I need to find tan A, which is sin A / cos A. Let me see how to manipulate this equation to get tan A.\n\nLet me recall that sin A = 2 sin (A/2) cos (A/2) and 1 - cos A = 2 sin²(A/2). Maybe using these identities can help.\n\nLet me try substituting those in:\n\nsin A = 4*(1 - cos A)\n\n=> 2 sin (A/2) cos (A/2) = 4*(2 sin²(A/2))\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. 1 - cos A is 2 sin²(A/2), so substituting that in:\n\nsin A = 4*(2 sin²(A/2))\n\nSo that's:\n\n2 sin (A/2) cos (A/2) = 8 sin²(A/2)\n\nHmm, okay. Let's divide both sides by 2 sin (A/2), assuming sin (A/2) ≠ 0, which it isn't for a triangle angle between 0 and 180 degrees.\n\nSo:\n\ncos (A/2) = 4 sin (A/2)\n\nDivide both sides by sin (A/2):\n\ncot (A/2) = 4\n\nWhich means tan (A/2) = 1/4.\n\nHmm, so tan (A/2) is 1/4. But I need tan A. Let me recall the double-angle formula for tangent:\n\ntan A = 2 tan (A/2) / ("

            "output": "1 - tan² (A/2))\n\nSince tan (A/2) is 1/4, let's plug that in:\n\ntan A = 2*(1/4) / (1 - (1/4)²) = (1/2) / (1 - 1/16)\n\nSimplify the denominator: 1 - 1/16 = 15/16\n\nSo tan A = (1/2) / (15/16) = (1/2)*(16/15) = 8/15.\n\nWait, so tan A is 8/15. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should solve the original equation without using half-angle identities to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from:\n\nsin A = 4 (1 - cos A)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots if any, but wait, actually, I can write this as:\n\nsin A = 4 - 4 cos A\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\nsin A + 4 cos A - 4 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, I can express sin A in terms of cos A and substitute.\n\nI know that sin² A + cos² A = 1. So from sin A = 4(1 - cos A), let me write:\n\nsin A = 4 - 4 cos A\n\nThen, square both sides:\n\nsin² A = 16 (1 - cos A)^2\n\nSo:\n\n(1 - cos² A) = 16 (1 - 2 cos A + cos² A)\n\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\n1 - cos² A = 16 - 32 cos A + 16 cos² A\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n1 - cos² A - 16 + 32 cos A - 16 cos² A = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1 - 16) + (-cos² A - 16 cos² A) + 32 cos A = 0\n\nThat's:\n\n-15 - 17 cos² A + 32 cos A = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it a bit cleaner:\n\n15 + 17 cos² A - 32 cos A = 0\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation in terms of cos A.

So cos A = 15/17.\n\nHmm, so cos A = 15/17. Then, to find sin A, since sin² A + cos² A = 1, sin A = sqrt(1 - (225/289)) = sqrt(64/289) = 8/17.\n\nTherefore, tan A = sin A / cos A = (8/17)/(15/17) = 8/15.\n\nSo that's consistent with what I got earlier.
