From the definition given, n$$ is a tower of n!s, n! times n! times ..., with a total of n! levels. So for 4$$, it's 4!^4!^...^4!, with four levels of 4!.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The notation is a bit confusing. It says n$$ is equal to a tower where the number of levels is n!, and each level is n!. So for n=4, it would be 4!^4!^4!^4! right? Because n! is 24, so 4! is 24, and the tower has 24 levels? Or wait, no, the tower has n! levels, each of which is n!. So 4! is 24, so the tower has 24 levels, each being 24^24^...^24, with 24 levels. That seems like a massive number, way beyond anything I can compute directly. But since the question only asks for the units digit, maybe I don't need to compute the entire number. Units digits often repeat in cycles, so perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nFirst, let's compute 4!. 4! is 24. Now, 24^anything will have a certain pattern in its units digit. But here, it's not just 24^24; it's 24^24^24^... with 24 levels. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Wait, the superfactorial definition is a tower where the number of levels is n! and each level is n!. So for n=4, it's a tower of 24 levels, each being 4! which is 24. So 4$$ is 24^24^24^...^24, with 24 levels. So essentially, it's 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 exponents.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me parse the definition again. It says n\\$ = \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}. So the number"

So the expression is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24. That's an astronomically large number, but we just need the units digit.\n\nHmm, okay. To find the units digit of such a tower, we can use properties of modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 10, since the units digit is the remainder when divided by 10. But exponent towers can be tricky because of the modulus cycles. Let me recall Euler's theorem, which says that if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n, where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. However, since 24 and 10 are not coprime (they share a common divisor of 2), Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the units digit of powers of 24. Let's see, 24 mod 10 is 4, so the units digit of 24 is 4. So actually, the base of the tower is 24, which has a units digit of 4, but when we take exponents, the units digit of the result depends on the exponent's value mod 4, because the units digit cycles every 4 for powers of 4. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the units digit of 24^k is the same as the units digit of 4^k, since 24 mod 10 is 4. So, the units digit of 24^k is equal to the units digit of 4^k. So, to find the units digit of 24^(something), we can instead compute 4^(something mod 4) mod 10, but only if the exponent is sufficiently large. Wait, let me recall the cycle for 4's powers:\n\n4^1 = 4 \u2192 units digit 4\n\n4^2 = 16 \u2192 units digit 6\n\n4^3 = 64 \u2192 units digit 4\n\n4^4 = 2"

But in this case, the exponent itself is another tower of 24s. So, the exponent of 4 is itself a tower of 24s, with 24 - 1 levels, because the original tower had 24 levels, and we're taking the exponent from the second level up.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify: The tower is 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 levels. So the overall exponent is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 levels. So to compute 24^exponent, we can consider it as 4^exponent mod 10. Since 24 mod 10 is 4, and the base is 4.\n\nSo, 4^exponent mod 10 depends on the exponent mod 2, because 4 has a cycle of 2 for its units digit. Therefore, if exponent is even, units digit is 6; if odd, units digit is 4.\n\nSo, the key is to determine whether exponent is even or odd. The exponent is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 levels. So that's 24^(some huge number). Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even. So, 24^(anything) is even, meaning the exponent is even. Therefore, the exponent is even, so 4^exponent mod 10 is 6.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure. So, the exponent is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 levels. Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so the exponent is even. Therefore, in 4^exponent, the exponent is even, so units digit of 4^exponent is 6. Therefore, the units digit of 24^exponent is 6. Hence, the units digit of 4$$ is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me go through this more carefully, as I might have oversimplified.\n\nWait, the tower is 24^(24^(...)) with 24 levels.

Since we only care about the units digit, mod 10.\n\nFirst, as before, since 24 mod 10 = 4, so T(24,24) mod 10 is equivalent to 4^{T(23,24)} mod 10, where T(23,24) is the tower of 23 24s.\n\nNow, to compute 4^E mod 10, where E = T(23,24). Since 4 has a cycle of 2 mod 10, as I saw earlier, so 4^1=4, 4^2=6 mod 10, 4^3=4, etc. So, if E is even, the result is 6; if odd, 4.\n\nTherefore, we need to determine if E is even or odd. Since E is T(23,24). Let's see, T(23,24) is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 levels. Since 24 is even, any tower of 24s with height \u22651 will be even. Therefore, E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6.

Since each term in T(23) is 24, which is even, any tower of 24s with height \u22651 is even. Therefore, the exponent is even.\n\nTherefore, 4^even \u2261 6 mod 10. So the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, does this hold for any tower height? Because if the exponent is even, regardless of how big it is, as long as it's even, 4^even mod 10 is 6. Yes, because 4^2=16\u22616, 4^4=256\u22616, etc. So any even exponent of 4 will end with 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4$$ is 6.\n\nBut let me test this with smaller cases to make sure.\n\nFor example, let's compute 1$$, which is 1!^1! =1^1=1, units digit 1.\n\n2$$: 2!^2! =2^2=4, units digit 4.\n\n3$$:3!^3!^3!^3! but wait, no.

So yes, units digit 6.\n\nTherefore, for 4$$, the same logic applies? Wait, but 24 is not 6. Wait, 24 mod 10 is 4, so the base is 4, not 6. So the previous reasoning is different.\n\nWait, so in the case of 3$$, the base is 6, so any exponent gives 6. But in 4$$, the base is 24 mod 10 =4, so the exponent's parity matters. So in that case, the exponent is even, so 4^even is 6 mod 10. So that's why the answer is 6.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's a case where the exponent could be odd. Suppose the tower had an odd exponent. But since all the exponents are 24, which is even, so the tower of 24s with any height \u22651 is even. So the exponent is even, so 4^even is 6 mod 10.

However, in this case, since we're only looking at the units digit, and 4's powers mod 10 cycle every 2, we can just look at the exponent's parity.
