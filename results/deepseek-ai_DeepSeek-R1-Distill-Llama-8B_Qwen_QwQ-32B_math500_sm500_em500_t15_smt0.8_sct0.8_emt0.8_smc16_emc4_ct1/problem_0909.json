We'll adjust the fraction by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by a factor that makes the denominator a power of 10.\n\nSince \\(312500 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^7 = 4 \\cdot 5^7\\), to make it a power of 10, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^5\\) (because \\(10 = 2 \\cdot 5\\), and we have an extra \\(2^2\\) in the denominator):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\times 2^5}{312500 \\times 2^5} = \\frac{21 \\times 32}{1000000} = \\frac{672}{1000000}\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Fraction**\n\nDivide both the numerator and the denominator by 8 to simplify:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{672 \\div 8}{1000000 \\div 8} = \\frac{84}{125000}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Convert to Decimal**\n\nFinally, divide the numerator by the denominator:\n\n\\[\n0.021\n\\"

Let me re-express the fraction directly as a decimal without simplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{672}{1000000} = 0.000672\n\\]\n\nWait, this is inconsistent. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the original fraction is \\(\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7}\\). To convert this to a decimal, we can rewrite the denominator as \\(10^7\\) divided by \\(2^5\\), since \\(10^7 = 2^7 \\cdot 5^7\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21}{2^2 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{21}{10^7 / 2^5} = \\frac{21 \\times 2^5}{10^7} = \\frac{21 \\times 32}{10^7} = \\frac{672}{10^7}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(672 \\div 10^7\\):\n\n\\[\n672 \\div 10^7 = 0.0000672\n\\]\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my previous steps. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculations. Let me start over.\n\nThe denominator is \\(2^2 \\cdot 5^7\\). To make the denominator a power of 10, we need to have equal exponents of 2 and 5. The exponent of 5 is 7, so we need to multiply numerator and denominator by \\(2^{5}\\) (since 7 - 2 = 5):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{21 \\times 2^5}{(2^2 \\cdot 5^7) \\times 2^5} = \\frac{21 \\times 32}{2^7 \\cdot 5^7} = \\frac{672}{10^7}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\(10^7 = 10,000,000\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{672}{10,000,000} = 0.0000"

Let me actually do the division.\n\nDivide 672 by 10,000,000:\n\n672 ÷ 10,000,000 = 0.0000672\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final decimal is 0.0000672.\n\nBut earlier I had another approach where I thought it was 0.021, but clearly, that's incorrect.\n\nSo the correct terminating decimal is 0.0000672.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{0.0000672}\\)."

Since the denominator is a product of 2s and 5s, it will terminate. The number of decimal places is the maximum of the exponents of 2 and 5. Here, exponent of 5 is 7, exponent of 2 is 2, so the decimal will terminate at 7 places.\n\nIndeed, 0.0000672 has 7 decimal places (the first four zeros, then 6,7,2). Let's count:\n\n0.0000672 is 0.0000672, which is 0.0000672000..., so the terminating decimal is 0.0000672.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{0.0000672}\n\nWait, but in my first approach I thought of 21/(2^2*5^7) = 21/(4*78125) = 21/312500.
