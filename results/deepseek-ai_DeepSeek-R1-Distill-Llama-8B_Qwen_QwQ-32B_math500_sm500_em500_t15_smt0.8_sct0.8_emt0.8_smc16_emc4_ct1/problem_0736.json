            "output": "I start by setting the equation equal to 72, so 2 cubed times 3 to the power of x equals 72. \\n\\nNext, I calculate 2 cubed, which is 8. This simplifies the equation to 8 times 3 to the power of x equals 72. \\n\\nThen, I divide both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate 3 to the power of x. This gives me 3 to the power of x equals 72 divided by 8, which is 9. \\n\\nNow, I recognize that 9 is 3 squared. Therefore, I can rewrite the equation as 3 squared equals 3 to the power of x. \\n\\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. This means that x must be 2.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step-by-step:\n\nGiven the equation:\n\\[\n2^3 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n\\]\n\n1. **Calculate \\(2^3\\):**\n\\[\n2^3 = 8\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n8 \\cdot 3^x = 72\n\\]\n\n2. **Isolate \\(3^x\\) by dividing both sides by 8:**\n\\[\n3^x = \\frac{72}{8} = 9\n\\]\n\n3. **Express 9 as a power of 3:**\n\\[\n9 = 3^2\n\\]\nSo, the equation now is:\n\\[\n3^x = 3^2\n\\]\n\n4. **Since the bases are equal, set the exponents equal:**\n\\[\nx = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
