            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation to solve: x equals the square root of (11 minus 2x) plus 4. Hmm, let me write it down clearly so I can see what I'm dealing with. It's x = √(11 - 2x) + 4. Alright, I need to find all the values of x that satisfy this equation.\n\nFirst, since there's a square root in the equation, I remember that often the first step is to isolate the square root and then square both sides to eliminate it. But I should also be careful because squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions, so I need to check any solutions I get at the end.\n\nLet me start by getting rid of the square root. So, I can subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the square root. That gives me x - 4 = √(11 - 2x). Now, the equation is a bit simpler: x - 4 equals the square root of (11 - 2x). \n\nNext, to get rid of the square root, I can square both sides of the equation. Squaring the left side, (x - 4)^2, and squaring the right side, which would be (√(11 - 2x))², which simplifies to 11 - 2x. So, expanding the left side, I get (x - 4)^2 = x² - 8x + 16. So, the equation now is x² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x.\n\nOkay, now I need to bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. So, I'll subtract 11 and add 2x to both sides to eliminate the constants and linear terms on the right. That gives me x² - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0. Simplifying that, x² - 6x + 5 = 0.\n\nNow, I have a quadratic equation: x² - 6x + 5 = 0. To solve this, I can factor it. Let me see, I need two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. Hmm, the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are x = 1"

            "output": " and x = 5. \n\nBut wait, I remember that sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions. So, I need to plug these values back into the original equation to make sure they work.\n\nFirst, test x = 1. Plugging into the original equation: 1 = √(11 - 2*1) + 4. Calculating inside the square root: 11 - 2 = 9. So, √9 is 3. Then, 3 + 4 is 7. So, 1 = 7? That's not true. So, x = 1 is an extraneous solution and can't be a valid answer. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, test x = 5. Plugging into the original equation: 5 = √(11 - 2*5) + 4. Calculating inside the square root: 11 - 10 = 1. So, √1 is 1. Then, 1 + 4 is 5. So, 5 = 5, which is true. So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nWait, so even though both x = 1 and x = 5 solved the quadratic, only x = 5 works in the original equation. So, that's important. Therefore, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check my steps. I started by isolating the square root, squared both sides correctly, expanded and simplified the quadratic, factored it, found the roots, and then checked each one in the original equation. It all seems to check out.\n\nI think I covered everything. So, the problem had a square root which made me square both sides, leading to a quadratic, which gave two solutions, but only one was valid. So, the answer is x = 5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the square root** by subtracting 4 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Square both sides** to eliminate the square root:\n   \\[\n   (x - 4)^2 = (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n"
