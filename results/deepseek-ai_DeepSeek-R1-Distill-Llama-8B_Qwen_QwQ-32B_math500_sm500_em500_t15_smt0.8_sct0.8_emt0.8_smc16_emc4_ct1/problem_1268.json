Since \\(256\\) is a power of \\(2\\) (\\(256 = 2^8\\)), I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll apply the exponent rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\) to simplify the right side further. This gives me \\(2^{2x} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(2\\), resulting in \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express Both Sides with the Same Base:**\n   \n   Notice that both sides of the equation involve powers of 2. Rewrite 256 as a power of 2.\n   \n   \\[\n   256 = 2^8\n   \\]\n   \n   Now, substitute this back into the equation:\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the Right Side Using Exponent Rules:**\n   \n   Use the exponent rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\):\n   \n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation becomes:\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the Exponents Equal to Each Other:**\n   \n   Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal:\n   \n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   Divide both sides by 2:\n   \n   \\[\n   x = \\"
