Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys and \\( g \\) represent the number of girls.\n\nGiven that there are 35 students in total, the sum of boys and girls is:\n\\[\nb + g = 35\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, the number of girls is a multiple of 13, so \\( g \\) can be 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since there are more girls than boys, \\( g \\) must be greater than \\( b \\). This means \\( g \\) cannot be too large; otherwise, \\( b \\) would be less than \\( g \\) and the total would exceed 35 students.\n\nTesting possible values for \\( g \\):\n- If \\( g = 13 \\), then \\( b = 35 - 13 = 22 \\). But since \\( g = 13 \\) is not greater than \\( b = 22 \\), this doesn't satisfy the condition.\n- If \\( g = 26 \\), then \\( b = 35 - 26 = 9 \\). Here, \\( g = 26 \\) is greater than \\( b = 9 \\), which meets the condition.\n\nChecking higher multiples of 13 would result in more girls than the total number of students, so \\( g = 26 \\) is the only valid option.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( b \\) = number of boys\n- \\( g \\) = number of girls\n\n**Given:**\n1. Total students = 35\n2. Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n3. There are more girls than boys (\\( g > b \\)).\n\n**Step 1:** Express the total number of students as the sum of boys and girls.\n\\[\nb + g = 35 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Since the number of girls is a multiple of 13, possible values for \\( g \\) are 13, 26, 39, etc. However, considering \\( g > b \\) and \\( b + g = 35 \\), we test possible values.\n\n- **If \\( g = 13 \\):**\n  \\[\n "
