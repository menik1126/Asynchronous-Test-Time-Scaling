This is the sum of the number of girls and boys at the meeting. \n\nNext, the number of girls is a multiple of 13. Let's denote the number of girls as \\( g \\) and the number of boys as \\( b \\). Therefore, \\( g \\) must satisfy \\( g = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nSince there are more girls than boys, \\( g \\) must be greater than \\( b \\).\n\nGiven that \\( g + b = 35 \\), substituting \\( g = 13k \\) into the equation gives \\( 13k + b = 35 \\).\n\nTo find possible values of \\( k \\), I'll solve for \\( b \\): \\( b = 35 - 13k \\).\n\nBecause the number of boys must be a positive integer, \\( 35 - 13k > 0 \\), which implies \\( k < \\frac{35}{13} \\approx 2.69 \\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \\( k \\) are 1 and 2.\n\nIf \\( k = 2 \\):\n- Number of girls \\( g = 26 \\)\n- Number of boys \\( b = 35 - 26 = 9 \\)\n\nIf \\( k = 1 \\):\n- Number of girls \\( g = 13 \\)\n- Number of boys \\( b = 35 - 13 = 22 \\)\n\nHowever, since there must be more girls than boys, the only valid solution is when \\( k = 2 \\) and there are 9 boys.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is greater than the number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( g \\) = number of girls\n- \\( b \\) = number of boys\n\n**We know:**\n1. \\( g + b = 35 \\)   (Equation 1)\n2. \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13 ⇒ \\( g = 13k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n3. \\( g > b \\)   (Equation "
