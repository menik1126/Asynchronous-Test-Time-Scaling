First, I should probably look at the equation and see if I can simplify it or factor it somehow. Both sides have cubes, so maybe expanding them could help, but that might get messy. Alternatively, I recall that there’s a formula for the sum of cubes: \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me denote \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). Then, the left side becomes \\(a^3 + b^3\\), which can be factored using the sum of cubes formula. So, applying that, I get:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\n\\]\n\nLet me compute \\(a + b\\) first. \\(a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\\). Oh, interesting! That’s exactly the same as the right side of the equation, which is \\((2x - 10)^3\\). So, substituting back in, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, so both sides have a factor of \\((2x - 10)\\). Let me move everything to one side to see what happens:\n\n\\[\n(2x - 10)(a^2 - ab + b^2) - (2x - 10)^3 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\((2x - 10)\\):\n\n\\[\n(2x - 10)\\left[(a^2 - ab + b^2) - (2x - 10)^2\\right] = 0\n\\]\n\nSo now, the product is zero, which means either factor could be zero. So, set each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. \\(2x - 10 = 0\\)\n2. \\(a^2 - ab + b^2"

Got one root already: \\(x = 5\\).\n\nNow, let’s work on the second equation. Remember that \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\). Let me substitute those back in. So, \\(a^2\\) is \\((x - 3)^2\\), \\(ab\\) is \\((x - 3)(x - 7)\\), and \\(b^2\\) is \\((x - 7)^2\\). So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7) + (x - 7)^2 - (2x - 10)^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.

Let me simplify it by dividing all terms by -3:\n\n\\(x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0\\)\n\nNow, I can factor this quadratic:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 21 and add to -10.

So,\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)(x - 7) = 0\n\\]\n\nWhich gives the roots \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = 7\\).\n\nWait, but I should check if these are valid solutions because sometimes substitution can introduce extraneous roots. Let me plug each value back into the original equation to verify.\n\nFirst, check \\(x = 3\\):\n\nLeft side: \\((3 - 3)^3 + (3 - 7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = 0 - 64 = -64\\)\n\nRight side: \\((2*3 - 10)^3 = (6 - 10)^3 = (-4)^3 = -64\\)\n\nSo, both sides equal -64.

Wait, but hold on: the original equation is a cubic, so we should expect up to three roots, which we have. So, that should be all of them.\n\nWait, but earlier when I factored, I had \\((2x - 10)(...)\\), which gave me \\(x = 5\\) and then the quadratic which gave \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x =7\\). So, total three roots, which makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the roots are 3,5,7.\n\nBut let me think again – sometimes, when we factor equations, we might lose some information. Let me check if I missed any steps.\n\nWait, initially, I factored the sum of cubes and got the equation as \\((2x -10)(something) = (2x -10)^3\\). Then, I moved everything to one side and factored out \\((2x -10)\\). So, that's correct.\n\nThen, in the second factor, I correctly substituted \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Then, expanded each term, which I think I did correctly. Combined like terms properly. Got a quadratic equation, which factored into (x-3)(x-7). So, that's correct.\n\nAnd then, verified the solutions, which worked.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's all. So, the roots are x = 3, x =5, x=7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe roots are \\boxed{3}, \\boxed{5}, and \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the equation \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\), we start by recognizing that both sides involve cubic terms. We use the sum of cubes formula \\(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\) with \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\).\n\nFirst, we factor the left side:\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)((x - 3)^2 - (x - 3)(x - 7"
