I remember that sometimes when you have sums of cubes on one side, there might be a way to simplify it. Maybe I can use some algebraic identities here.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to have it clear: \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\\). Hmm, I notice that both sides have a cube, so perhaps if I can manipulate the equation to set it equal to zero, I can factor it or find a common term.\n\nLet me subtract the right-hand side from both sides to set the equation to zero: \\((x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 - (2x - 10)^3 = 0\\). Now, I have a difference of two cubes, but here it's a sum of two cubes minus another cube. Maybe I can use the identity for the difference of cubes, which is \\(a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\\). But I have a sum of two cubes minus another, so perhaps I can group them differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can expand each term and see if something cancels out or simplifies. That might take some time, but let's try it.\n\nFirst, let me expand \\((x - 3)^3\\). Using the binomial expansion, \\((a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3\\). So expanding \\((x - 3)^3\\):\n\n\\(x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27\\).\n\nSimilarly, expanding \\((x - 7)^3\\):\n\n\\(x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343\\).\n\nNow, adding these two together: \\((x^3 - 9x^2 + 27x - 27) + (x^3 - 21x^2 + 147x - 343)\\).\n\nLet's combine like terms:\n\n- \\(x^3 + x^3 = 2x^3\\)\n- \\(-9x^"

Again, using the binomial expansion:\n\n\\((2x)^3 - 3*(2x)^2*10 + 3*(2x)*(10)^2 - (10)^3\\).\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\((2x)^3 = 8x^3\\)\n- \\(3*(2x)^2*10 = 3*4x^2*10 = 120x^2\\)\n- \\(3*(2x)*(10)^2 = 3*2x*100 = 600x\\)\n- \\((10)^3 = 1000\\)\n\nSo, \\((2x - 10)^3 = 8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\\).\n\nNow, let's set the equation equal to this:\n\nLeft-hand side: \\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370\\)\n\nRight-hand side: \\(8x^3 - 120x^2 + 600x - 1000\\)\n\nSubtracting the right-hand side from both sides to bring everything to the left:\n\n\\(2x^3 - 30x^2 + 174x - 370 - 8x^3 + 120x^2 - 600x + 1000 = 0\\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(2x^3 - 8x^3 = -6x^3\\)\n- \\(-30x^2 + 120x^2 = 90x^2\\)\n- \\(174x - 600x = -426x\\)\n- \\(-370 + 1000 = 630\\)\n\nSo the equation simplifies to: \\(-6x^3 + 90x^2 - 426x + 630 = 0\\).\n\nHmm, that's a cubic equation.

Wait, -6, 90, 426, 630: let's check if they have a common factor.\n\nDivide each term by -6: \n\n- \\(-6x^3 / -6 = x^3\\)\n- \\(90x^2 / -6 = -15x^2\\)\n- \\(-426x / -6 = 71x\\)\n- \\(630 / -6 = -105\\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes: \\(x^3 - 15x^2 + 71x - 105 = 0\\).\n\nHmm, now we have a cubic equation \\(x^3 -15x^2 +71x -105 =0\\). I need to find its roots. Maybe I can try rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient. So, possible roots are ±1, ±3, ±5, ±7, ±15, etc., over 1, so integers.\n\nLet me test x=3: plug in 3, 27 - 135 + 213 - 105 = (27-135) + (213-105) = (-108) + 108 = 0. Oh, x=3 is a root!\n\nSo, (x - 3) is a factor. Now, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 3:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -15 | 71 | -105\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 3: 3. Add to -15: -12.\n\nMultiply -12 by 3: -36. Add to 71: 35.\n\nMultiply 35 by 3: 105. Add to -105: 0. Perfect.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x - 3)(x^2 -12x +35) = 0.\n\nNow, factor the quadratic: \\(x^2 -12x +35\\). Looking for two numbers that multiply to 35 and add to -12. Hmm, -5 and -7: (-5)*(-7)=35, -5+(-7)=-12. So, factors as (x -5)(x -7).\n\nSo, the entire factorization is (x -3)(x -5)(x -7)=0.\n\nTherefore, the"

So, works.\n\nTherefore, all three roots are valid.\n\nWait, but I started with a cubic equation, which can have up to three real roots, which I have found. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could have been noticing that \\(2x -10\\) is 2*(x -5). Hmm, perhaps that can lead to a substitution.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me set \\(y = x -5\\). Then, \\(2x -10 = 2(y +5) -10 = 2y +10 -10 = 2y.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\((y + 2)^3 + (y -2)^3 = (2y)^3\\).\n\nExpand each term:\n\n\\((y +2)^3 = y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8\\).\n\n\\((y -2)^3 = y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8\\).\n\nAdding them together: (y^3 +6y^2 +12y +8) + (y^3 -6y^2 +12y -8) = 2y^3 +24y.\n\nRight-hand side: (2y)^3=8y^3.\n\nSo the equation becomes: 2y^3 +24y =8y^3.\n\nBring all terms to the left: 2y^3 +24y -8y^3 = -6y^3 +24y =0.\n\nFactor out -6y: -6y(y^2 -4)=0.\n\nSo,"
