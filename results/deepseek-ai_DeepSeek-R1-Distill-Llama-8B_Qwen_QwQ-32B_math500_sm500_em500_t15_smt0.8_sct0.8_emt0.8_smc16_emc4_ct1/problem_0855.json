            "output": "First, I'll set up the equation based on the problem statement.\n\nI know that half of (3x - 9) is equal to (x + 37). So, I can write this relationship as:\n\n(1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37\n\nNext, I'll simplify the left side of the equation by distributing the 1/2.\n\nMultiplying 1/2 by both terms inside the parentheses gives:\n\n(3x/2) - (9/2) = x + 37\n\nNow, I'll eliminate the fractions to make the equation easier to work with. I'll multiply every term by 2.\n\nMultiplying each term by 2 results in:\n\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n\nFinally, I'll solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.\n\nFirst, subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx - 9 = 74\n\nThen, add 9 to both sides to find the value of x:\n\nx = 83\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37 \\]\n\n1. **Distribute the \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) on the left side:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3x}{2} - \\frac{9}{2} = x + 37\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply every term by 2 to eliminate the fractions:**\n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to isolate \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \\[\n   x = 74 + 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 83\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{83}\\)"
