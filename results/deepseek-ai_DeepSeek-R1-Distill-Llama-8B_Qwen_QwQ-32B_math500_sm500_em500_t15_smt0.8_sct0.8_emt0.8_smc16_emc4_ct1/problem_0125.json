            "output": "First, I need to convert the binary number 10101001110 to base eight. I know that each digit in the binary number represents a power of two, starting from 2^0, and each group of three binary digits corresponds to a single octal digit.\n\nTo begin, I'll break the binary number into groups of three, starting from the right. This will ensure that each group aligns correctly with the powers of two.\n\nOnce the binary number is divided into groups of three, I'll convert each binary triplet into its corresponding octal value. For example, the binary triplet \"101\" is equal to 5 in octal, and \"010\" is equal to 2 in octal.\n\nAfter converting all the binary triplets, I'll combine the octal digits to form the final base eight number. This process will give me the equivalent of the given binary number in base eight.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) to base eight (octal), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Break the binary number into groups of three starting from the right**:\n   \n   ```\n   1 01 010 011 10\n   ```\n   \n   However, since we have 11 digits, the leftmost group will have one more digit:\n\n   ```\n   1 010 010 011 10\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert each binary group to its corresponding octal value**:\n   \n   - \\(1_{2} = 1_{8}\\)\n   - \\(010_{2} = 2_{8}\\)\n   - \\(010_{2} = 2_{8}\\)\n   - \\(011_{2} = 3_{8}\\)\n   - \\(10_{2} = 2_{8}\\)\n   \n   Combining these, we get:\n\n   ```\n   1 2 2 3 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Write the final base eight number**:\n   \n   ```\n   1 2 2 3 2\n   ```\n\n   Therefore, the binary number \\(10101001110_{2}\\) is equal to \\(12232_{8}\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{12232_{8}}\n\\]"
