The binary number provided is 10101001110\u2082, and I need to convert it to its equivalent value in base eight.\n\nNext, I'll recall the process for binary to octal conversion. Since octal is base 8 and binary is base 2, I can achieve the conversion by dividing the binary number into groups of three digits each, starting from the right. Each group of three binary digits will then be converted to a single octal digit.\n\nTo start, I'll write down the binary number: 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0.\n\nNow, I'll begin grouping the digits from the right. The last three digits are 1 1 0, which is 110\u2082. Converting 110\u2082 to octal gives me 6, since 64 is 1000000\u2082, and 110\u2082 is 6 in decimal.\n\nMoving to the next group from the right, the digits are 0 1 1, which is 011\u2082. Converting 011\u2082 to octal results in 3, because 4 is 100\u2082, and 011\u2082 is 3 in decimal.\n\nThe next group is 0 1 0, which is 010\u2082. Converting 010\u2082 to octal gives me 2, as 2 is 10\u2082 and 010\u2082 is 2 in decimal.\n\nContinuing, the next group is 1 0 1, which is 101\u2082. Converting 101\u2082 to octal results in 5, since 101\u2082 equals 5 in decimal.\n\nThe last group is 1 0 0, which is 100\u2082. Converting 100\u2082 to octal gives me 4, as 100\u2082 is 4 in decimal.\n\nNow, I'll combine all the octal digits from the groups: 6, 3, 2, 5, and 4. Reading them together, the binary number 10101001110\u2082 converts to 43256\u2088.\n\nI'll double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy. Each group of three binary digits correctly converts to the corresponding octal digits, and when combined, they form the octal number 43256.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the binary number \\( 10101001110_2 \\) to its equivalent in base eight (oct"
