Proper divisors are numbers less than 284 that divide it without leaving a remainder.\n\nI'll check for divisibility starting from 1 and continue until I find all factors.\n\nUpon checking, the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nNext, I'll sum these proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220.\n\nNow, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220.\n\nI'll list all the proper divisors of 220. They are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110.\n\nAdding these together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 283.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 283.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**  \nFind the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284.\n\n**Step 1:** Find the proper divisors of 284.\n\nA proper divisor of a number is a positive divisor less than the number itself.\n\n- 284 is an even number, so 2 is a divisor.\n- 284 \u00f7 2 = 142.\n- Check if 142 is divisible by smaller numbers:\n  - 142 \u00f7 2 = 71.\n  - 71 is a prime number.\n\nThus, the proper divisors of 284 are:\n\\[ 1, 2, 4, 71, 142 \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220 \\]\n\n**Step 3:** Find the proper divisors of 220.\n\n- 220 can be factored into: \\( 220 = 2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11 \\).\n- The divisors of 220 are: 1, 2, 4, 5,"
