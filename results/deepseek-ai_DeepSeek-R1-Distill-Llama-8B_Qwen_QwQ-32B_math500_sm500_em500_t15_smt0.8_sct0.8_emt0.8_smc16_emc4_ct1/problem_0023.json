The complex number given is \\(1 - i\\).\n\nI recall that for complex numbers, the modulus \\(|(a + bi)|\\) is calculated as \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).Applying this to \\(1 - i\\), the modulus is \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nNext, I need to raise \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to the eighth power.Using the power rule, \\((\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{4} = 16\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\) is 16.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\(|(1 - i)^8|\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the modulus of \\(1 - i\\):**  \n   The modulus of a complex number \\(a + bi\\) is calculated as \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\).  \n   \\[\n   |1 - i| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Raise the modulus to the 8th power:**  \n   \\[\n   |(1 - i)^8| = |1 - i|^8 = (\\sqrt{2})^8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify \\((\\sqrt{2})^8\\):**  \n   \\[\n   (\\sqrt{2})^8 = (2^{1/2})^8 = 2^{(1/2) \\times 8} = 2^4 = 16\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{16}\n\\]"
