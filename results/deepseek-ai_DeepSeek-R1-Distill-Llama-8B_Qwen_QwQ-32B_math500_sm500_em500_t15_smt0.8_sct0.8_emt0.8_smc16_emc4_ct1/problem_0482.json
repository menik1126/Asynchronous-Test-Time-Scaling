The sphere is formed by cutting off the corners of the cube, which means each corner is replaced with a quarter-cylinder.\n\nNext, I'll visualize the cube. The cube has equal sides, and each corner is a right angle. When the corners are removed to form the sphere, a quarter-cylinder is cut from each corner.\n\nI should calculate the volume of one of these quarter-cylinders and then multiply by the total number of corners. A cube has 8 corners, and each corner contributes a quarter-cylinder, so altogether, this forms a full cylinder.\n\nThe radius of the sphere is given as 3 inches. Since the sphere is formed by the quarter-cylinders from the cube, the radius of each cylinder is also 3 inches.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the volume of one quarter-cylinder. The volume formula for a cylinder is πr²h. However, since we're dealing with a quarter-cylinder, I'll multiply by 1/4.\n\nSo, the volume of one quarter-cylinder is (1/4) * π * (3)² * h. I'm missing the value of h, the height of the cylinder. To find h, I notice that the height of the cylinder is the same as the edge length of the cube because the cylinder is formed by cutting along the edges.\n\nSince the sphere is the shortest possible, the height h of the cylinder must be equal to the side length of the cube. This means h equals the side length of the cube.\n\nLet the side length of the cube be 's'. Then, the volume of one quarter-cylinder is (1/4) * π * 9 * s = (9/4)πs.\n\nSince there are 8 corners, the total volume removed from the cube is 8 * (9/4)πs = 18πs.\n\nThe original volume of the cube is s³. After removing the volumes of the cylinders, the volume of the sphere is s³ - 18πs.\n\nBut the problem states that the sphere has a 3-inch radius. Therefore, the volume of the sphere is (4/3)πr³, which is (4/3)π*(3)³ = 36π cubic inches.\n\nSetting the two expressions for the sphere's volume equal to each other: s³ - 18πs"

Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the sphere is inscribed within the cube? If the sphere is inscribed, its diameter would equal the side length of the cube. The sphere's radius is 3 inches, so diameter is 6 inches. Therefore, the cube's side length would be 6 inches. But the problem says the cube has the shortest possible side lengths. If the sphere is inscribed, then the cube's side length is exactly twice the radius, so 6 inches. But the question mentions removing metal from the corners, so maybe it's not just an inscribed sphere?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is formed by rounding the edges of the cube, so the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces. Wait, but the problem says removing metal from the corners. So perhaps the sphere is formed by cutting the corners such that the sphere is entirely within the cube, and the corners are cut in a way that the sphere's surface is tangent to the original cube's edges?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is the largest possible sphere that can fit inside the cube after removing the corners. To minimize the cube's side length, the sphere must be as large as possible. The sphere's radius is given as 3 inches, so the sphere must fit within the cube. If the sphere is inscribed, then the cube's side length is 6 inches. But if we remove the corners, perhaps the sphere can be larger? Wait, but the problem states that the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so maybe the cube's side length is indeed 6 inches. But then why mention removing metal from the corners?\n\nHmm, perhaps the sphere is formed by truncating the cube's corners such that the sphere is the inscribed sphere of the resulting shape. Maybe the cube is modified so that the sphere touches the centers of the original cube's faces, but the corners are cut off. In that case, the sphere's diameter would still be equal to the cube's edge length. Wait, but if you cut off the corners, the distance from the center to the face remains the same as the original cube's half-edge length. Therefore, the sphere's radius would still be half the cube"

If the cube's edge length were longer than 6 inches, then removing the corners could create a sphere with radius 3 inches. However, the problem says the sphere has the shortest possible side length. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terminology. The cube's side lengths are being minimized, not the sphere's.\n\nWait, perhaps the cube's side lengths are being minimized such that it can form a sphere of radius 3 inches by removing the corners. So the cube must be large enough to enclose the sphere after truncation. To minimize the cube's side length, the sphere must be tangent to the cube at the midpoints of the cube's edges.\n\nIn this case, the cube's edge length would be equal to the sphere's diameter, which is 6 inches. Therefore, the cube's side length is 6 inches, and the sphere's volume is (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic inches.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the volume of the cube is 6³ = 216 cubic inches. But the problem says the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube. So the volume of the sphere is 36π, and the cube's volume is 216 cubic inches.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"a steel sphere... is made by removing metal from the corners of a cube that has the shortest possible side lengths.\" So the cube is being made as small as possible to create the sphere. So if the sphere is to have a radius of 3 inches, then the cube's edge length must be at least twice the radius, so 6 inches. But if you remove the corners, does the cube's edge length need to be longer? Or can it be exactly 6 inches?\n\nWait, if the cube's edge length is 6 inches, and the sphere is formed by cutting off each corner so that the sphere touches the midpoints of the cube's edges, then the corners can be removed to create the sphere.

But let me confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sphere is formed by rounding the corners such that the sphere's radius is 3 inches. The corners are cut such that each corner is replaced by a quarter-octant of a sphere with radius 3 inches. In that case, the original cube must have edges of length equal to the sphere's diameter plus twice the radius? Wait, no.\n\nWait, if you have a cube and you cut off each corner with a spherical quarter-octant (like a corner cut with a radius), then the original cube's edge length must be such that the sphere of radius 3 inches fits into the corner. The distance from the corner to the center of the cube is (s√3)/2. But the sphere's radius is 3 inches, so maybe the sphere is centered at the cube's center, and the distance from the center to any face is s/2. The sphere must not extend beyond the cube, so s/2 must be at least the sphere's radius. Therefore, s/2 ≥ 3 ⇒ s ≥ 6. To minimize s, set s=6. Then the sphere touches the centers of the cube's faces, and the corners are cut off such that the sphere is entirely within the cube. But in this case, the volume of the cube is 6³=216, and the sphere's volume is 36π. The problem states that the sphere is made by removing metal from the cube's corners, so the cube's volume is indeed 216.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere is formed by the cube with its corners cut such that the sphere is the inscribed sphere of the resulting shape. The inscribed sphere must touch all the faces and the newly cut faces. In that case, the original cube's edge length would need to be calculated based on the sphere's radius.\n\nSuppose the cube has edge length s. When you cut off each corner, you create new triangular faces. The inscribed sphere must be tangent to both the original faces and the new ones. The distance from the center of the cube to the original face is s/2, and the distance to the new face (from cutting the corner) would be s/2 minus the distance from the corner to the cut.

This forms a new triangular face where the corner used to be. The sphere is inscribed in the cube, so it must be tangent to both the original face and the new triangular face.\n\nThe distance from the center of the cube to the original face is s/2. The distance from the center to the new triangular face must also be equal to the sphere's radius, which is 3 inches.\n\nThe new triangular face is located at a distance d from the original corner. The distance from the center of the cube to this new face can be found using the formula for the distance from a point to a plane. Let's set up coordinates, with the center of the cube at (0,0,0). The original corner is at (s/2, s/2, s/2). The plane cuts each axis at (s/2 - d, 0, 0), (0, s/2 - d, 0), etc. The equation of the plane can be written as x + y + z = s/2. Wait, actually, the plane equation would be x + y + z = k, where k is a constant. Plugging in the points where the plane intersects the edges: (d, 0, 0), (0, d, 0), (0, 0, d). So x + y + z = d. The distance from the center (0,0,0) to this plane is |0 + 0 + 0 - d| / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1²) = d / sqrt(3).\n\nThis distance must equal the sphere's radius, which is 3 inches. Therefore, d / sqrt(3) = 3 ⇒ d = 3√3.\n\nSo the plane cuts each edge at a distance of d = 3√3 inches from the corner. Now, since the original corner is at (s/2, s/2, s/2), the distance from the corner to the cut is d = 3√3 inches. Therefore, the length from the corner to the cut is 3√3 inches.\n\nBut the edge length s must accommodate this cut. The cube's edge length is s, and each edge is cut twice (once at each"

The original edge length is s, so the remaining length of the edge after cutting is s - 2d. However, the edge is now between two cuts, each at distance d from the original corner. Therefore, the remaining edge length is s - 2d. But in the modified shape, the edges are now the edges of the triangular faces. Wait, actually, the edges between the cuts become the edges of the new shape. The original edge is split into a middle part of length s - 2d, but the new edges are the edges of the triangular faces. Each triangular face has edges of length d√2 (since they are the edges between two cuts on adjacent edges). Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the edge length of the original cube must be such that the distance from the corner to the cut is d = 3√3. Since the original edge length is s, the distance from the corner to the cut along each edge is d. Therefore, the remaining length of each edge after cutting is s - 2d. However, the sphere's radius is 3 inches, which is the distance from the center to the new face. \n\nWait, but the sphere is inscribed in the truncated cube, so its radius is the distance from the center to any face. The original faces are now at a distance of s/2 from the center, and the new triangular faces are at a distance of d / sqrt(3) = 3 inches. Therefore, the distance to the original faces must also be equal to the sphere's radius. Therefore, s/2 must equal 3 inches. Therefore, s = 6 inches. But then, if s = 6 inches, then d = 3√3 ≈ 5.196 inches, but the original edge length is only 6 inches. Therefore, the distance from the corner to the cut is d = 3√3 ≈5.196, so the remaining edge length would be s - 2d ≈6 - 10.392 ≈-4.392, which is impossible. That can't be.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests an error in my reasoning. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if the sphere is inscribed in"

Therefore, the distance from the center to the original face is s/2, and the distance to the new triangular face is d / sqrt(3). Since both must equal the sphere's radius, we have s/2 = d / sqrt(3) = 3.\n\nTherefore, s = 6 inches, and d = 3√3 inches. But if the original cube's edge length is 6 inches, then cutting each corner at a distance of 3√3 inches from the corner would require that 2d ≤ s. So 2d = 6√3 ≈10.392 inches, which is greater than s =6 inches. This is impossible because you can't cut more than the edge length.\n\nTherefore, this approach is incorrect. Perhaps the sphere is not inscribed in the truncated cube but rather is the actual sphere formed by the truncation. Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's radius is related to the cube's edge length differently.\n\nLet me think again. When you cut off a corner of a cube to make a sphere, the sphere's radius is equal to the distance from the corner to the cut along each edge. So, if the sphere has a radius of 3 inches, then each corner is cut such that each edge is cut 3 inches from the corner. Therefore, the edge length of the cube must be at least 2*3 = 6 inches to accommodate the cuts at both ends.
