            "output": "First, I need to determine the side length of the cube. The steel sphere has a radius of 3 inches, so its diameter is 6 inches. Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere is equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the side length of the cube is 6 inches.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the cube. The formula for the volume of a cube is V = s³, where s is the side length. Plugging in the value, the volume is 6³ = 216 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, I'll find the volume of the steel sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr³. With a radius of 3 inches, the volume is (4/3)π(3)³ = 36π cubic inches.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine the Side Length of the Cube:**\n   \n   - The steel sphere has a 3-inch radius, so its diameter is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) inches.\n   - Since the sphere is inscribed inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere equals the side length of the cube.\n   - Therefore, the side length \\(s\\) of the cube is \\(6\\) inches.\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**\n   \n   - The formula for the volume \\(V\\) of a cube is:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cube}} = s^3\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the value:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{cube}} = 6^3 = 216 \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Volume of the Steel Sphere:**\n   \n   - The formula for the volume \\(V\\) of a sphere is:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the radius \\(r = 3\\) inches:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (3)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 27 = 36\\pi \\text{ cubic inches}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   The volume of the cube is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed"
