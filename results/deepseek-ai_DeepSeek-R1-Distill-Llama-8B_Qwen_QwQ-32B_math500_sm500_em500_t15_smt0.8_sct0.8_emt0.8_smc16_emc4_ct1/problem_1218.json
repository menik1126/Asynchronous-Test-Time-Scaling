            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: If n is congruent to 2 modulo 7, I need to find the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with modular arithmetic, substituting values can sometimes make things simpler. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, maybe I can replace n with 2 in the expression and then compute it modulo 7.\n\nAlright, let me write that out. So, if n ≡ 2 mod 7, then n can be expressed as 7k + 2 for some integer k. But maybe I don't need to get into the k part. I can just substitute 2 into each place where n appears. Let me try that.\n\nSo, substituting n with 2, the expression becomes (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6). Let me compute each part step by step. First, 2 + 2 is 4. Next, 2 + 4 is 6. And then, 2 + 6 is 8. So now, the expression is 4 * 6 * 8.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should compute each term modulo 7 first before multiplying. That might be easier because 4, 6, and 8 can be reduced modulo 7 as well. Let's try that approach.\n\nSo, 4 mod 7 is just 4 because 4 is less than 7. 6 mod 7 is also 6. What about 8 mod 7? That's 1 because 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1. So, now the expression becomes 4 * 6 * 1.\n\nOkay, so 4 * 6 is 24. Then, 24 * 1 is 24. Now, I need to find 24 mod 7. Let me do that division: 7 * 3 is 21, and 24 - 21 is 3. So, 24 mod 7 is 3. Therefore, the remainder should be 3.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check by another method just to be thorough. Maybe I can compute it step by step without simplifying first"

Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, each term can be considered modulo 7.\n\nFirst, compute each term modulo 7:\n\nn + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 mod 7,\n\nn + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 = 6 mod 7,\n\nn + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7.\n\nSo, multiplying them together: 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7. That's the same as before, so 4*6 is 24, 24 mod7 is 3, then 3*1 is 3 mod7. So that still gives 3. Okay, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expanding the expression first before plugging in n=2. Let's try that approach. Let me expand (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Hmm, expanding three terms might be a bit tedious, but let's see.\n\nFirst, multiply the first two factors: (n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 4n + 2n + 8 = n^2 + 6n + 8.\n\nThen, multiply that by (n + 6):\n\n(n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) = n^3 + 6n^2 + 8n + 6n^2 + 36n + 48.\n\nWait, let me do that step by step properly. Let me distribute each term:\n\nFirst term: n^2 * n = n^3,\n\nn^2 * 6 = 6n^2,\n\n6n * n = 6n^2,\n\n6n * 6 = 36n,\n\n8 * n = 8n,\n\n8 * 6 = 48.\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nn^3 + 6n^2 + 6n^2 + 36n + 8n + 48.\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nn^3 + (6n^2 + 6n^2) = n^3 + 12n^2,\n\n36n + 8n = 44n,\n\n"

            "output": "and the constant term is 48.\n\nSo the expanded form is n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48.\n\nNow, since n ≡ 2 mod7, let's compute each term mod7.\n\nFirst, compute n^3: 2^3 = 8 ≡1 mod7.\n\nThen, 12n^2: 12 mod7 is 5, and n^2 is 4, so 5*4=20. 20 mod7 is 6, because 7*2=14, 20-14=6.\n\nNext, 44n: 44 mod7. Let's see, 7*6=42, so 44-42=2. So 2n, n=2, so 2*2=4.\n\nThen, the constant term 48: 48 mod7. 7*6=42, so 48-42=6.\n\nNow, add all these together: 1 (from n^3) + 6 (from 12n^2) + 4 (from 44n) + 6 (constant term). So 1+6=7, 7+4=11, 11+6=17.\n\nNow, 17 mod7. Since 7*2=14, 17-14=3. So the remainder is 3.\n\nOkay, so both methods gave me 3. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about using properties of congruences to simplify before expanding. So, if n ≡2 mod7, then n + 2 ≡4, n +4≡6, n +6≡8≡1 mod7.\n\nSo, the product is 4*6*1 mod7. 4*6 is 24, which is 3 mod7 because 24-21=3. Then 3*1=3 mod7. Yep, same answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it as using the substitution method more abstractly. Since n ≡2 mod7, then (n +2k) ≡2 +2k mod7. But wait, actually, n + k is just another number, but not necessarily related to the modulus. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nWait, no, if I have n ≡2 mod7, then for any integer k,"

I think the answer is 3. But let me make sure that in expanding, I didn't make any mistake. Let me check again the expansion approach:\n\nOriginal expansion steps:\n\nFirst, (n + 2)(n +4) = n² +6n +8. Then, multiplying by (n +6):\n\nMultiply n² by (n +6): n³ +6n²,\n\nMultiply 6n by (n +6): 6n² +36n,\n\nMultiply 8 by (n +6): 8n +48.\n\nAdding all together: n³ +6n² +6n² +36n +8n +48. So combining terms:\n\nn³ + (6+6)n² + (36+8)n +48 = n³ +12n² +44n +48. That's correct.\n\nThen substituting n=2 mod7. Wait, but actually, when substituting n ≡2 mod7, we can compute each term modulo7:\n\nn^3 mod7: 2^3=8 mod7=1,\n\n12n² mod7: 12 mod7 is 5, so 5*(2)^2=5*4=20 mod7=6,\n\n44n mod7: 44 mod7 is 2 (since 7*6=42, 44-42=2), so 2*2=4,\n\n48 mod7: 48-42=6.\n\nAdding them: 1+6=7, 7 mod7=0, then 0+4=4, 4+6=10 mod7=3. Wait, hold on, that's different? Wait, no, 1+6 is 7, which is 0 mod7, then 0 +4 is 4, then 4+6 is 10, which is 3 mod7. So that's correct. So that gives 3 again. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm"

I think I can be confident that the remainder is 3 when (n+2)(n+4)(n+6) is divided by 7, given that n≡2 mod7.\n\nJust to recap, the problem gives me n≡2 mod7 and asks for the remainder when (n+2)(n+4)(n+6) is divided by7. I substituted n=2, simplified each term modulo7, multiplied them, and found the result mod7 again. All approaches led to the same answer, so I think 3 is correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that if \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\), then \\( n \\) can be replaced with 2 modulo 7 in the given expression. Substituting 2 into each term:\n\n- \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod"
