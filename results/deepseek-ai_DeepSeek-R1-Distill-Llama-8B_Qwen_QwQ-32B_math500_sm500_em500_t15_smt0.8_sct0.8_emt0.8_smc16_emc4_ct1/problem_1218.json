I need to figure out the remainder when that expression is divided by 7. Since n is congruent to 2 modulo 7, I can substitute 2 in place of n wherever I see it, right? That should simplify things.\n\nLet me write down what each part becomes. If \\( n = 2 + 7k \\), where k is some integer, then:\n\n- \\( n + 2 = 2 + 7k + 2 = 4 + 7k \\)\n- \\( n + 4 = 2 + 7k + 4 = 6 + 7k \\)\n- \\( n + 6 = 2 + 7k + 6 = 8 + 7k \\)\n\nBut wait, since we're working modulo 7, adding 7k won't affect the remainder because 7k is a multiple of 7, right? So, I can just take each term modulo 7 to simplify.\n\nSo let's compute each term modulo 7:\n\n- \\( n + 2 \\equiv 2 + 2 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 4 \\equiv 2 + 4 = 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( n + 6 \\equiv 2 + 6 = 8 \\pmod{7} \\). Oh, but 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so 8 \u2261 1 mod7. So that term is 1.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes \\( 4 \\times 6 \\times 1 \\) modulo 7. Let me compute that: 4 * 6 is 24. Then 24 * 1 is 24. So 24 modulo 7. Hmm, let's see, 7 * 3 is 21, so 24 - 21 is 3. Therefore, the remainder should be 3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again.\n\nGiven \\( n \u2261 2 mod7 \\),"

That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. Let's expand the original expression to see if that gives me the same result.\n\n\\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\)\n\nLet me first multiply two terms and then the third.\n\nMultiply (n + 2)(n + 4):\n\n= \\( n^2 + 6n + 8 \\)\n\nThen multiply that by (n + 6):\n\n= \\( (n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6) \\)\n= \\( n^3 + 6n^2 + 8n + 6n^2 + 36n + 48 \\)\n= \\( n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48 \\)\n\nNow, plug in \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n= \\( 2^3 + 12(2)^2 + 44(2) + 48 \\)\n= 8 + 12*4 + 88 + 48\n= 8 + 48 + 88 + 48\nLet's add them up: 8 + 48 is 56, 56 +88 is 144, 144 +48 is 192.\n\nSo, the value is 192. Now, what is 192 mod7? Let me compute 7*27=189, so 192 -189=3. So 192\u22613 mod7, same as before.\n\nSo that's a confirmation that the remainder is indeed 3.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I can use properties of congruences without expanding. Since each term is congruent to 4,6,1 mod7, their product is 4*6*1=24\u22613 mod7. Yep, same result.\n\nIs there another way to check? Maybe pick a specific n that is"

So yes, 3.\n\nTry another n, say n=9 (since 9\u22612 mod7).\n\nCompute (9+2)=11, (9+4)=13, (9+6)=15. Then 11*13*15. Hmm, that's a bigger number. Let's compute it:\n\n11*13=143, then 143*15=2145. Now compute 2145 mod7.\n\nWell, 7*300=2100, so 2145-2100=45. 45 mod7: 7*6=42, so 45-42=3. So again, remainder 3.\n\nSo whether I use n=2, n=9, or n=16, I get the same result. So I think I can confidently say the remainder is 3.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each approach\u2014direct substitution, expanding the polynomial, and testing specific values\u2014leads to the same conclusion.
