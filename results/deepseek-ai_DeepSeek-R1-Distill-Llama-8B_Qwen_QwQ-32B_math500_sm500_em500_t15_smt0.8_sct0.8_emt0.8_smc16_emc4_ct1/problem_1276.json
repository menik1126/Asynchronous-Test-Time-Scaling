Since \\(2^8 = 256\\), I can rewrite the equation as \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nNext, I'll simplify the right side of the equation. Applying the power of a power property, \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) becomes \\(2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\). Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, which gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a power of 2:**\n   \n   \\[\n   256 = 2^8\n   \\]\n   \n   So,\n   \n   \\[\n   256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the right side using the power of a power property (\\(a^{m^n} = a^{m \\cdot n}\\)):**\n   \n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rewrite the original equation with the simplified right side:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
