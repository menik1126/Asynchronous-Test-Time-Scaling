            "output": "First, I recognize that both sides of the equation involve exponents, so I can address the problem using properties of exponents.\n\nI know that 256 is a power of 2. Specifically, 256 equals 2 raised to the 8th power.\n\nBy substituting 256 with 2⁸, the equation becomes 2^(2x) = (2⁸)^(1/2).\n\nNext, I'll apply the power of a power property to simplify the right side of the equation. This means I'll multiply the exponents: 2^(2x) = 2^(8 * 1/2).\n\nCalculating 8 times 1/2 gives me 4, so the equation is now 2^(2x) = 2⁴.\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other. Therefore, 2x must equal 4.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, which results in x = 2.\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is x = 2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( 2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a Power of 2**:\n   \\[\n   256 = 2^8\n   \\]\n   So, substitute back into the equation:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**:\n   The property states that \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n} \\).\n   \\[\n   (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n   Now, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the Exponents Equal to Each Other**:\n   Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\"
