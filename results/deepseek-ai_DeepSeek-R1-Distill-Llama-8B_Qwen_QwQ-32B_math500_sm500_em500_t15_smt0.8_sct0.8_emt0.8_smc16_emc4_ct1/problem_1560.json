            "output": "First, I need to determine the total number of people to arrange, which is 8.\n\nSince the table is square, it has 4 sides, and each side needs to have 2 people. This means there are 4 groups of 2 people each that need to be seated around the table.\n\nNext, I should calculate the number of ways to divide the 8 people into these 4 groups. This is a combination problem where I choose 2 people out of 8, then 2 out of the remaining 6, and so on.\n\nThe formula for dividing n items into groups of k is given by the multinomial coefficient. So, the number of ways to form these groups is:\n\n8! / (2! × 2! × 2! × 2!) = 2520 / 16 = 157.5\n\nSince we can't have half a way, this approach isn't valid. Therefore, I need to consider that the seats at each side are distinguishable, so I should use a different method.\n\nNow, I'll consider the circular nature of the table. In circular permutations, we fix one person's position to eliminate rotations. However, since the table is square and symmetrical, fixing one position still allows for reflectional symmetry, which reduces the number of unique configurations.\n\nAfter fixing one person, there are 7 remaining people to arrange. But due to the square's symmetry, some arrangements will be equivalent under rotation or reflection. To avoid overcounting, I should divide by the number of symmetries, which is 8 (rotations) and 4 (reflections), totaling 16 symmetries.\n\nFinally, applying Burnside's lemma, I calculate the number of distinct arrangements by averaging the number of fixed points under each symmetry. This involves considering how many arrangements remain unchanged when the table is rotated or reflected.\n\nAfter performing all calculations, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is found to be 8.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering rotational symmetry, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Fix One Person's Position**:\n   - Since the table is square, we can fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. This reduces the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people around the table.\n\n2. **Arrange the Remaining 7 People**:\n   - After fixing one person, there"

            "output": " are 7 remaining people to arrange. The total number of linear arrangements is \\(7!\\).\n\n3. **Adjust for Rotational Symmetry**:\n   - A square table has rotational symmetry of order 4 (rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°). Since we already fixed one person's position, we don't need to divide by the number of rotations. However, the remaining arrangement must account for the fixed position.\n\n4. **Consider Reflectional Symmetry**:\n   - If reflections are considered equivalent, we would divide by 2. However, the problem specifies that configurations are equivalent only if they are rotations of each other, not reflections. Thus, reflections are treated as distinct.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The number of distinct arrangements is \\(7!\\) divided by the rotational symmetry already accounted for by fixing one position. Since fixing one position already removes rotational symmetry, the result is simply \\(7!\\).\n\nHowever, this approach overcounts because the problem requires exactly 2 people per side. The correct method involves arranging the 8 people in a circular permutation divided into 4 sides of 2 each:\n\n1. **Circular Permutation Adjustment**:\n   - For circular arrangements, the formula is \\((n-1)!\\). Here, \\(n = 8\\), so \\((8-1)! = 7!\\). But since each side has 2 people, we must divide by \\(2^4\\) to account for the indistinguishability of the two people on each side.\n\n2. **Correct Formula**:\n   - The total number of distinct arrangements is \\(\\frac{(8-1)!}{2^4} = \\frac{5040}{16} = 315\\).\n\nHowever, this is incorrect because fixing the table's rotational symmetry and dividing by \\(2^4\\) is not the right approach. The correct method is:\n\n1. **Fix One Person**:\n   - Fix one person at a specific seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. The remaining 7 people can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways.\n\n2. **Divide by 2 for Reflections**:\n   - Since reflections are considered distinct, we do not divide by 2. Thus, the total is \\(7! = 5040\\).\n\nBut this still doesn't account for the side groupings. The correct approach"
