Since the table is square, it has rotational symmetry, meaning that rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new distinct configuration.\n\nTo account for this symmetry, I can use the concept of circular permutations but adjusted for the square shape. Normally, for circular arrangements, we fix one person's position to eliminate rotational duplicates. However, since the table has four sides, fixing one position still allows for rotations within each side.\n\nNext, I divide the problem into two parts: arranging the people around the table and then considering the distinct seating configurations. By fixing one person's seat, I reduce the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people. Since each side must have exactly 2 people, I need to distribute these 7 individuals across the four sides, which introduces additional constraints.\n\nFinally, I calculate the number of valid distributions and then determine the permutations for each distribution. This involves applying the formula for circular permutations, considering the rotational symmetry and the requirement of two people per side.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe have 8 people who need to be seated around a square table. There are 2 people on each side of the table. Rotational duplicates are considered the same configuration.\n\n**Step 2: Handle Rotational Symmetry**\n\nSince the table is square, rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new unique configuration. To eliminate rotational symmetry, we can fix one person's position.\n\n**Step 3: Arrange the Remaining 7 People**\n\nWith one person fixed, the remaining 7 people need to be seated around the table. However, each side must have exactly 2 people.\n\n**Step 4: Distribute the Remaining 7 People Across the 4 Sides**\n\nWe need to distribute 7 people across 4 sides, with each side having at least 1 person (since one seat is already occupied by the fixed person). This can be represented as:\n\\[ (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) = 7 \\]\nwhere \\( a_i \\geq 1 \\) and each \\( a_i \\) represents the number of people on each side.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Circular Permutation Formula**\n\nAfter distributing the people, we can calculate the number of distinct seating arrangements by considering the rotational symmetry.\n\n"

Let me re-examine.\n\n**Revised Step 3: Fixing One Person**\n\nFixing one person's position removes rotational symmetry. The remaining 7 people can be arranged freely. Since each side must have exactly 2 people, the fixed person occupies one seat on a side, leaving 1 seat on that side and 2 seats on each of the other three sides.

The square has 4 sides, so total seats: 4\u00d72 = 8, which matches the number of people. \n\nTo account for rotational symmetry, fix one person at a specific seat. This breaks rotational symmetry. Now, the remaining 7 people must be arranged in the remaining 7 seats. \n\nHowever, the seats are divided into 4 sides with 2 seats each. Fixing one seat leaves the other seats in a linear arrangement around the table. \n\nThe number of ways to arrange the remaining 7 people is 7!.\n\nBut since the table is square, after fixing one seat, rotations are already accounted for. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is 7!.\n\nWait, but the problem states that rotations are considered the same. By fixing one person's seat, we've already eliminated rotational duplicates.

But the formula suggests 1260.\n\nBut in this problem, each side must have exactly 2 people. Therefore, the initial approach of fixing one person and arranging the rest might be incorrect because it doesn't enforce the 2 people per side condition.\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\nLet me see. Since each side must have exactly 2 people and rotational symmetry is considered, the number of ways can be computed as:\n\n1. Fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry. This leaves 7 people to be arranged around the remaining 7 seats.\n\n2. But since each side must have exactly 2 people, fixing one seat on a side means that side now has 1 seat occupied, so we need to place 1 more person on that side.\n\n3. The distribution becomes: one side has 2 people (fixed person + 1 more), and the other three sides each have 2 people.\n\n4. The number of ways to choose the remaining 7 people into these seats:\n\n   - Choose 1 person to sit with the fixed person: \\( \\binom{7}{1} = 7 \\).\n   - Arrange the remaining 6 people in the 6 seats (2 on each of the other three sides): \\( 6! \\).\n\n5.

Therefore, the total number of seating arrangements without considering rotation is 8! / (2!^4) \u00d7 4! ?\n\nWait, no.

Then, arranging each group on the sides.\n\nBut if the sides are fixed in their positions (due to rotational symmetry being considered), assigning the groups to the sides is unnecessary because the table's rotational symmetry has already been accounted for by dividing by 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is:\n\nNumber of ways = \\( \\frac{8!}{(2!)^4 \\cdot 4} \\) = \\( \\frac{40320}{16 \\cdot 4} \\) = \\( \\frac{40320}{64} \\) = 630.\n\nBut this seems conflicting with earlier results.\n\nWait, maybe I should follow the standard formula for circular arrangements with constraints.\n\nAlternatively, after fixing one seat, as earlier, the number of arrangements is 7! = 5040.
