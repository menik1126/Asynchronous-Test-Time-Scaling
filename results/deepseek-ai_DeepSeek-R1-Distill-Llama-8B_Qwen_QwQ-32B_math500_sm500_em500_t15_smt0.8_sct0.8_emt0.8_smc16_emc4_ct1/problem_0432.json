This means the common difference (d) is 2.\n\nNext, I need to determine the total number of terms in the sequence to calculate the sum. The first term (a\u2081) is 1, and the last term (a\u2099) is 199. Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\na\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n - 1)d\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n199 = 1 + (n - 1) \u00d7 2\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn = 100\n\nNow, with 100 terms and a common difference of 2, I can calculate the sum (S\u2099) of the first n terms using the formula:\n\nS\u2099 = n/2 \u00d7 (a\u2081 + a\u2099)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS\u2081\u2080\u2080 = 100/2 \u00d7 (1 + 199) = 50 \u00d7 200 = 10,000\n\nFinally, to find the modulo 7 remainder of 10,000, I need to divide 10,000 by 7 and find the remainder.
