            "output": "First, I need to determine the number of terms in the sequence. The sequence starts at 1 and each term increases by 2, so it's an arithmetic sequence. The last term is 199.\n\nUsing the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)d, where a₁ is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\n\nPlugging in the values: 199 = 1 + (n - 1)×2. Solving for n gives n = 100.\n\nSo, there are 100 terms in the sequence.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of the sequence. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by: Sₙ = (n/2)(a₁ + aₙ).\n\nSubstituting the known values: S₁₀₀ = (100/2)(1 + 199) = 50 × 200 = 10,000.\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7, I'll divide 10,000 by 7 and find the remainder.\n\nDividing 10,000 by 7 gives 1,428 with a remainder of 4 since 7 × 1,428 = 9,996 and 10,000 - 9,996 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 4 when the sum 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + 199 is divided by 7.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\( 7 \\) remainder of the sum \\( 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199 \\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Sequence and Number of Terms\nThe sequence is an **arithmetic sequence** where each term increases by \\( 2 \\):\n- **First term (\\( a_1 \\))**: \\( 1 \\)\n- **Common difference (\\( d \\))**: \\( 2 \\)\n- **Last term (\\( a_n \\))**: \\( 199 \\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Terms (\\( n \\))\nUse the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\nPlugging in the known values:\n\\[\n"
