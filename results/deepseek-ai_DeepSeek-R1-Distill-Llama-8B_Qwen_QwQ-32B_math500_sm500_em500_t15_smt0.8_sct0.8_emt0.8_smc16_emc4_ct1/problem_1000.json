            "output": "Alright, so I need to compute this expression: 0.777... minus 0.444... plus 0.222..., and then express the answer as a common fraction. Hmm, okay. I remember that repeating decimals can be converted into fractions by using some algebra tricks. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, let me take the first term, which is 0.\\overline{7}. So that's 0.7777... repeating forever. I think the way to convert this into a fraction is to set it equal to some variable, say x, and then multiply both sides by 10 to shift the decimal point so that the repeating part lines up. Let me write that down.\n\nLet x = 0.\\overline{7}. Then, multiplying both sides by 10 gives me 10x = 7.7777... Now, if I subtract the original x from this equation, the repeating decimals should cancel out. So, 10x - x is 9x, and on the right side, 7.7777... minus 0.7777... is 7. So, 9x = 7. Therefore, x = 7/9.\n\nOkay, so 0.\\overline{7} is equal to 7/9. That wasn't too bad.\n\nNext, let's handle the second term: 0.\\overline{4}. That's 0.4444... repeating. I think the same approach applies here. Let me call this y. So, y = 0.\\overline{4}. If I multiply both sides by 10, I get 10y = 4.4444... Subtracting the original y from this equation: 10y - y = 9y, and 4.4444... - 0.4444... is 4. So, 9y = 4, which means y = 4/9.\n\nGot it. So, 0.\\overline{4} is 4/9. Now, moving on to the third term: 0.\\overline{2}. That's 0.2222... repeating. Let me call this z. So, z = 0.\\overline{2}. Multiplying both sides by 10 gives 10z = 2.2222... Subtracting z from this: 10z - z = 9z"

            "output": ", and 2.2222... - 0.2222... is 2. So, 9z = 2, meaning z = 2/9.\n\nAlright, so now I have all three decimals as fractions:\n- 0.\\overline{7} = 7/9\n- 0.\\overline{4} = 4/9\n- 0.\\overline{2} = 2/9\n\nNow the original expression is 0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} + 0.\\overline{2}, which in fractions is 7/9 - 4/9 + 2/9.\n\nHmm, let me compute this step by step. First, subtract 4/9 from 7/9. That would be 7/9 - 4/9 = (7 - 4)/9 = 3/9, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nThen, add 2/9 to that result. So, 1/3 + 2/9. To add these, I need a common denominator, which is 9. Converting 1/3 to 3/9, so 3/9 + 2/9 = 5/9.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations. 7/9 minus 4/9 is indeed 3/9, which is 1/3. Then adding 2/9: 1/3 is 3/9, so 3/9 + 2/9 is 5/9. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} + 0.\\overline{2} equals 5/9.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting with 0.\\overline{7} as 7/9: 7 divided by 9 is 0.777..., which checks out. Then 0.\\overline{4} is indeed 4/9, because 4 divided by 9 is 0.444... Correct. And 0.\\overline{2} is 2/9 because 2 divided by 9 is 0.222... Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, performing the"

Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute all three terms as decimals and perform the arithmetic in decimals to see if it matches 5/9.\n\nSo, 0.777... is approximately 0.777777..., 0.444... is 0.444444..., and 0.222... is 0.222222...\n\nCalculating 0.777777... minus 0.444444...: Let's do 0.777777 - 0.444444. Subtracting digit by digit:\n\n777777...\n-444444...\n-------------\n333333...\n\nSo, 0.333333... which is 1/3.\n\nThen, adding 0.222222... to 0.333333...: 333333...\n+222222...\n-------------\n555555...\n\nSo, 0.555555... which is approximately 0.555555...\n\nNow, if 5/9 is equal to 0.555555..., let me check that. 5 divided by 9: 9 goes into 5 zero, then 50 divided by 9 is 5, 5*9=45, remainder 5. Bring down a zero: 50 again. So, it's 0.555555... repeating. Yes, that matches. Therefore, 0.555555... is indeed 5/9.\n\nSo, all the steps check out when converting to decimals as well. So, it's 5/9 as a common fraction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5/9.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing the expression \\(0.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{4} + 0.\\overline{2}\\) and expressing the result as a common fraction.\n\n1.
