            "output": "Alright, so I need to find the smallest real number x in the domain of the function g(x) = sqrt[(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2]. Hmm, okay. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since it's a square root function, the expression inside the square root, which is (x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2, must be greater than or equal to zero. So, I need to solve the inequality:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2 >= 0\n\nI remember that a^2 - b^2 can be factored into (a - b)(a + b). Maybe I can apply that here. Let me set a = x - 3 and b = x - 8. So, the expression becomes:\n\n[(x - 3) - (x - 8)] * [(x - 3) + (x - 8)] >= 0\n\nLet me simplify each part. First, (x - 3) - (x - 8):\n\n(x - 3) - (x - 8) = x - 3 - x + 8 = (x - x) + (-3 + 8) = 0 + 5 = 5\n\nOkay, so the first factor is just 5, which is positive. Now, the second factor is (x - 3) + (x - 8):\n\n(x - 3) + (x - 8) = x - 3 + x - 8 = 2x - 11\n\nSo, putting it all together, the inequality becomes:\n\n5 * (2x - 11) >= 0\n\nSince 5 is positive, I can divide both sides by 5 without changing the inequality sign:\n\n2x - 11 >= 0\n\nNow, solving for x:\n\n2x >= 11\n\nx >= 11/2\n\n11 divided by 2 is 5.5, so x is greater than or equal to 5.5. Therefore, the domain of g(x) is all real numbers x where x >= 5.5.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest real number x in the domain. Well, the smallest value in the domain would be the lower bound, which is 5.5 or 11/2.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't"

            "output": " make any mistakes. Starting with the expression inside the square root:\n\n(x - 3)^2 - (x - 8)^2\n\nFactoring it as a difference of squares gives (a - b)(a + b), where a = x - 3 and b = x - 8. Calculating each part:\n\na - b = (x - 3) - (x - 8) = 5, which is correct.\n\na + b = (x - 3) + (x - 8) = 2x - 11, which also looks right.\n\nSo, the inequality is 5*(2x - 11) >= 0. Since 5 is positive, the inequality reduces to 2x - 11 >= 0, leading to x >= 11/2.\n\nEverything checks out. Therefore, the smallest real number x in the domain is 11/2, which is 5.5.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest real number \\( x \\) in the domain of \\( g(x) \\) is found by solving the inequality inside the square root being non-negative.
