            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where y varies inversely as the square root of x. Hmm, I remember that inverse variation means that as one thing increases, the other decreases proportionally. Let me try to recall the formula for inverse variation.\n\nInverse variation is usually written as y = k/x, where k is the constant of proportionality. But in this case, it's not just y varying directly with x; it's varying inversely with the square root of x. So, I think the formula would be y = k divided by the square root of x, or y = k / √x.\n\nYeah, that makes sense because if y varies inversely with √x, then as √x increases, y decreases, keeping the product k constant. So the relationship can be written as y = k / √x.\n\nAlright, the problem gives me a specific case: when x is 24, y is 15. I can use this to find the constant k. Let me plug these values into the equation.\n\nSo, substituting x = 24 and y = 15:\n\n15 = k / √24.\n\nNow, I need to solve for k. First, let me find √24. The square root of 24 is... well, 24 is 4 times 6, so √24 = √(4*6) = √4 * √6 = 2√6. So, √24 is 2√6.\n\nSo, now the equation becomes:\n\n15 = k / (2√6).\n\nTo solve for k, I'll multiply both sides by 2√6:\n\nk = 15 * 2√6.\n\nMultiplying 15 by 2 gives 30, so k = 30√6.\n\nGot it, so the constant of proportionality is 30√6.\n\nNow, the question asks for x when y is 3. So, I need to find the value of x when y = 3. Let's use the inverse variation formula again, which is y = k / √x. We know k is 30√6, and y is 3. So plugging in these values:\n\n3 = (30√6) / √x.\n\nI need to solve for x. Let me rearrange this equation to solve for √x first.\n\nMultiply both sides by √x:\n\n3√x = 30√6.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\n√"

So,\n\n√x = 10√6.\n\nNow, to find x, I need to square both sides:\n\nx = (10√6)^2.\n\nCalculating that, 10 squared is 100, and (√6)^2 is 6. So,\n\nx = 100 * 6 = 600.\n\nTherefore, when y is 3, x is 600.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Start with inverse variation: y = k / √x.\n2. Given x=24, y=15: 15 = k / √24.\n3. Correctly compute √24 as 2√6.\n4. So, 15 = k / (2√6).\n5. Multiply both sides by 2√6: k = 15 * 2√6 = 30√6.\n6. Then, when y=3: 3 = 30√6 / √x.\n7. Multiply both sides by √x: 3√x = 30√6.\n8. Divide by 3: √x = 10√6.\n9. Square both sides: x = (10√6)^2 = 100*6=600.\n\nYes, all steps seem to check out. I don't see any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that x is 600 when y is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) when \\( y = 3 \\) is \\boxed{600}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( y \\) varies inversely as \\( \\sqrt{x} \\), we can express this relationship as:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{k}{\\sqrt{x}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the constant of proportionality.
