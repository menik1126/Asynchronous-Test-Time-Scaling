Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys and \\( g \\) represent the number of girls.\n\nGiven that the total number of students is 35, I can write the equation:\n\\[ b + g = 35 \\]\n\nIt's also stated that the number of girls is a multiple of 13, so \\( g \\) can be 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since there are more girls than boys, \\( g \\) must be greater than \\( b \\).\n\nTesting \\( g = 26 \\):\n\\[ b + 26 = 35 \\]\n\\[ b = 9 \\]\nHere, there are 9 boys and 26 girls, satisfying both conditions.\n\nTesting \\( g = 13 \\):\n\\[ b + 13 = 35 \\]\n\\[ b = 22 \\]\nIn this case, there are 22 boys, which contradicts the \"more girls than boys\" condition.\n\nSince \\( g = 26 \\) is the only viable option, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let \\( b \\) represent the number of boys.\n- Let \\( g \\) represent the number of girls.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**\nWe know the total number of students is 35:\n\\[ b + g = 35 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Given Conditions**\n- The number of girls \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13.\n- There are more girls than boys, so \\( g > b \\).\n\n**Step 4: Determine Possible Values for \\( g \\)**\nSince \\( g \\) is a multiple of 13 and less than 35 (because \\( g > b \\) and \\( b \\geq 1 \\)):\n- The possible value for \\( g \\) is **26**.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Number of Boys**\nSubstitute \\( g = 26 \\) into the equation:\n\\[ b + 26 = 35 \\]\n\\[ b = 35 - 26 \\]\n\\[ b = 9 \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of boys at the meeting is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."
