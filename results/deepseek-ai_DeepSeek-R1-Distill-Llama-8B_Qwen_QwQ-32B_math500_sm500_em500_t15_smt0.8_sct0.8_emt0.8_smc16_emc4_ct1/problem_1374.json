            "output": "To solve the problem, I'll start by defining the variables. Let B represent the number of boys and G represent the number of girls in the math club meeting.\n\nI know that the total number of students is 35, so I can write the equation:\nG + B = 35\n\nAdditionally, the number of girls is a multiple of 13, which means G = 13k, where k is an integer.\n\nThe problem states that there are more girls than boys, so G > B. Substituting G with 13k, this inequality becomes:\n13k > B\n\nSince both G and B are positive integers and their sum is 35, I'll test the possible multiples of 13 to find a valid solution.\n\nFirst, consider k = 1:\nG = 13 * 1 = 13\nThen, B = 35 - 13 = 22\nHowever, 13 is not greater than 22, which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\nNext, consider k = 2:\nG = 13 * 2 = 26\nThen, B = 35 - 26 = 9\nHere, 26 is greater than 9, which satisfies the condition.\n\nSince k = 3 would result in G = 39, which exceeds the total number of students, the only valid solution is when k = 2.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys at the meeting is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nLet:\n- \\( B \\) = Number of boys\n- \\( G \\) = Number of girls\n\n**Step 2: Set Up Equations**\n\nWe know:\n1. The total number of students is 35:\n   \\[\n   G + B = 35\n   \\]\n2. The number of girls is a multiple of 13:\n   \\[\n   G = 13k \\quad \\text{where } k \\text{ is an integer}\n   \\]\n3. There are more girls than boys:\n   \\[\n   G > B\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Substitute \\( G \\) in the Total Equation**\n\nSubstitute \\( G = 13k \\) into \\( G + B = 35 \\):\n\\[\n13k + B = 35\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\nB = 35 - 13k\n\\]\n\n**"
