So, I can set up the equation \\( 45\\pi = \\pi r^2 h \\).\n\nNext, I observe from the Asymptote figure that the radius \\( r \\) is given as 3 centimeters. Substituting this value into the equation, it becomes \\( 45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h \\).\n\nSimplifying the equation, I calculate \\( 3^2 = 9 \\), so the equation is now \\( 45\\pi = 9\\pi h \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( h \\), I divide both sides of the equation by \\( 9\\pi \\), which gives \\( h = \\frac{45}{9} = 5 \\) centimeters.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given the volume of a cylinder and need to find its height.
