Since the last term is 100, and each pair consists of 2 numbers, there are 100 / 2 = 50 pairs.\n\nFinally, I'll multiply the number of pairs by the value of each pair:\n\n50 pairs * (-1) per pair = -50.\n\nSo, the sum of the series is -50.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** Compute: \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\).\n\n---\n\nLet's compute the given series step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   \n   The series alternates between subtraction and addition of consecutive integers:\n   \\[\n   1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + \\dots + 99 - 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Group the Terms:**\n   \n   To simplify, group the terms in pairs:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify Each Pair:**\n   \n   Each pair simplifies to \\(-1\\):\n   \\[\n   1 - 2 = -1 \\\\\n   3 - 4 = -1 \\\\\n   \\vdots \\\\\n   99 - 100 = -1\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Count the Number of Pairs:**\n   \n   Since there are 100 terms in total and each pair consists of 2 terms, there are:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ pairs}\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Compute the Total Sum:**\n   \n   Multiply the number of"
