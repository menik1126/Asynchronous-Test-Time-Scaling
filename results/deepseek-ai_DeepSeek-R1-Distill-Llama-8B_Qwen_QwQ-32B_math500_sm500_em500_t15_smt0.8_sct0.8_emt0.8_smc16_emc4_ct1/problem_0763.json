The problem states that for every positive integer k, two conditions hold:\n\n1. The subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric.\n2. The subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic.\n\nAdditionally, we know that a₁₃ is 2016, and we need to find a₁.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. Let's start by recalling what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\nA geometric sequence has each term after the first being a multiple of the previous term, so the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. On the other hand, an arithmetic sequence has each term after the first being obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. So, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n\nGiven that, for every k, the triple a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, which means that the ratio between a_{2k} and a_{2k-1} is the same as the ratio between a_{2k+1} and a_{2k}. Let me denote the common ratio as r_k. So,\n\na_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r_k\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k = a_{2k-1} * (r_k)^2\n\nSimilarly, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic, so the difference between a_{2k+1} and a_{2k} should be equal to the difference between a_{2k+2} and a_{2k+1}. Let me denote the common difference as d_k. So,\n\na_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = d_k\n\na_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1} = d_k\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d_k = a_{"

So, we can write:\n\nFrom the geometric sequence:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r_k\n\nFrom the arithmetic sequence:\n\na_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d_k\n\nTherefore, equating the two expressions for a_{2k+1}:\n\na_{2k} * r_k = a_{2k} + d_k\n\nSo, let's rearrange this:\n\nd_k = a_{2k} * (r_k - 1)\n\nThat's an interesting relationship. So, the common difference d_k is a multiple of a_{2k}, specifically (r_k - 1) times a_{2k}.\n\nNow, let's go one step further. Let's express a_{2k+2} in terms of a_{2k}. From the arithmetic sequence condition:\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k} + 2d_k\n\nBut we already have d_k in terms of a_{2k} and r_k, so let's substitute that in:\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k} + 2*(a_{2k} * (r_k - 1)) = a_{2k} + 2a_{2k}(r_k - 1)\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_{2k+2} = a_{2k} + 2a_{2k}r_k - 2a_{2k}\n\n= 2a_{2k}r_k - a_{2k}\n\n= a_{2k}(2r_k - 1)\n\nSo, a_{2k+2} = a_{2k}*(2r_k - 1)\n\nBut also, from the geometric sequence condition, for the next k, that is, for the same term a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, etc., we might need to relate these ratios.\n\nWait, let me consider k+1.

Thus, a_{12}=36x +6x=42x.\n\nAlternatively, a_{12}=a_{10}*(2r₅ -1)=30x*(2*(6/5)-1)=30x*(12/5 -5/5)=30x*(7/5)=42x. Correct.\n\nNext, k=6:\n\nr₆=(2r₅ -1)/r₅=(2*(6/5)-1)/(6/5)= (12/5 -5/5)/(6/5)= (7/5)/(6/5)=7/6.\n\nThus, a_{13}=a_{12}*r₆=42x*(7/6)=49x.\n\nBut we know that a_{13}=2016. Therefore,\n\n49x=2016 ⇒ x=2016/49=41.142857...\n\nWait, that's not an integer. But a₁ is a positive integer, so x must be an integer. So this suggests that our assumption that r₁=2 leads to a contradiction because a₁=2016/49 is not an integer.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps r₁=2 is not the correct initial ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires a different r₁. Let me see whether I can adjust this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe r₁ is a different value.\n\nWait, so from the computations above, if we have r₁=2, the ratio for a_{13} is 49x, and 49x=2016 ⇒ x=2016/49=41.14285..., which is not an integer. Therefore, this suggests that r₁ cannot be 2, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate that.\n\n49x=2016 ⇒ x=2016 ÷ 49.\n\nLet me compute 49×41=2009, so 2016-2009=7. So 2016=49×41 +7. So 2016=49×41 +7 ⇒ 2016=49×41 +7 ⇒ 2016=49×41.142857...\n\nSo, yes, x="
