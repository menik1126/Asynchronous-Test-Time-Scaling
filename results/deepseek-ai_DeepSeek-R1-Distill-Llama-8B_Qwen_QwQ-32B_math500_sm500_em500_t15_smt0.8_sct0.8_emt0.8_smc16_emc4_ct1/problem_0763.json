The problem states two main properties about this sequence:\n\n1. For every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. That means each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term.\n2. For every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. That means each term is obtained by adding a common difference.\n\nAdditionally, we're given that a₁₃ is 2016, and we need to find a₁.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, the sequence is built in such a way that every odd-indexed trio forms a geometric progression, and every even-indexed trio forms an arithmetic progression. That seems pretty structured, so maybe there's a pattern or formula that can describe the sequence.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand what it means for a trio of numbers to be both geometric and arithmetic in different contexts. Wait, no, not both at the same time. For the geometric part, it's a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, which is a geometric sequence, so the ratio between terms is constant. For the arithmetic part, it's a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, which is an arithmetic sequence, meaning the difference between terms is constant.\n\nSo, for each k, we have:\n\n- Geometric: a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k}\n- Arithmetic: a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}\n\nLet me write this down:\n\n1.

Or perhaps find a general formula for a_n in terms of a₁?\n\nLet me try to see if there's a recursive relationship here.
