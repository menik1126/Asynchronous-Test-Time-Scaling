The problem states two main properties about this sequence:\n\n1. For every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. That means each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term.\n2. For every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. That means each term is obtained by adding a common difference.\n\nAdditionally, we're given that a\u2081\u2083 is 2016, and we need to find a\u2081.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. So, the sequence is built in such a way that every odd-indexed trio forms a geometric progression, and every even-indexed trio forms an arithmetic progression. That seems pretty structured, so maybe there's a pattern or formula that can describe the sequence.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand what it means for a trio of numbers to be both geometric and arithmetic in different contexts. Wait, no, not both at the same time. For the geometric part, it's a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, which is a geometric sequence, so the ratio between terms is constant. For the arithmetic part, it's a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2}, which is an arithmetic sequence, meaning the difference between terms is constant.\n\nSo, for each k, we have:\n\n- Geometric: a_{2k} / a_{2k-1} = a_{2k+1} / a_{2k}\n- Arithmetic: a_{2k+1} - a_{2k} = a_{2k+2} - a_{2k+1}\n\nLet me write this down:\n\n1. From the geometric sequence: (a_{2k})\u00b2 = a_{2k-1} * a_{2k+1}  [since the square of the middle term equals the product of the first and the third]\n2. From the arithmetic sequence: 2*a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + a_{2k+2}  [since the middle term is"

So, all the ratios and differences must be positive integers as well.\n\nGiven that a\u2081\u2083 is 2016, which is an odd index (13 is odd), so maybe we can work backwards from there? Or perhaps find a general formula for a_n in terms of a\u2081?\n\nLet me try to see if there's a recursive relationship here. Let's start by writing out the first few terms in terms of a\u2081 and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet me denote the terms as follows:\n\nLet me start with a\u2081. Then, since the sequence is strictly increasing, a\u2082 must be greater than a\u2081, a\u2083 greater than a\u2082, etc.\n\nFirst, let's consider k=1:\n\nFor the geometric sequence starting at a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083:\n\nSo, (a\u2082)\u00b2 = a\u2081 * a\u2083.

Maybe we can express each term in terms of the previous ones?\n\nLet me try to express terms step by step.\n\nStarting with a\u2081. Let me call a\u2081 = x (to make it easier).
