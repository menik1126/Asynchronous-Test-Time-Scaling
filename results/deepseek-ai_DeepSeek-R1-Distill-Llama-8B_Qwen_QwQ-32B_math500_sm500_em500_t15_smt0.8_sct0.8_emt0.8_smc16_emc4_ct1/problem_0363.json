            "output": "First, let's define the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles.\n\nGiven the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3, we can set up the equation B/Y = 4/3. This implies that B = (4/3)Y.\n\nNext, after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 7:3. This gives us another equation: (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3.\n\nWe can substitute B from the first equation into the second equation. So, (4/3 Y + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3.\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 3(Y - 3):\n\n4Y + 15 = 7(Y - 3)\n\nExpanding the right side: 4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21\n\nNow, subtract 4Y from both sides: 15 = 3Y - 21\n\nFinally, add 21 to both sides to solve for Y: 36 = 3Y, so Y = 12.\n\nUsing the value of Y, we can find B: B = (4/3)(12) = 16.\n\nTherefore, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before any additional marbles were added.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = Initial number of blue marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = Initial number of yellow marbles\n\n**Given:**\n1.
