            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under the matrix M. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the image of a line under a linear transformation (which is what a matrix represents here) will generally be another line, unless the transformation is not invertible, in which case it might collapse to a point or something. But since M is transforming two different vectors given, I guess it's invertible? Or maybe I don't need to worry about that right now.\n\nWait, actually, to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1, I can approach this in a couple of ways. One way is to find the image of two points on the line, and then determine the equation of the line passing through those two images. Alternatively, I could try to find the general transformation rule for the line and then express it in terms of y = mx + b.\n\nLet me try the first method because it seems straightforward. I know two points on the original line: let's choose x = 0 and x = 1, because that will give me two points that are easy to compute.\n\nWhen x = 0, y = 2(0) + 1 = 1. So the point is (0, 1).\n\nWhen x = 1, y = 2(1) + 1 = 3. So the point is (1, 3).\n\nNow, I need to apply matrix M to these two points and see where they end up. Then, with those two new points, I can find the equation of the line connecting them.\n\nThe original points are (0,1) and (1,3). Let me represent them as vectors. So, vector a = [0; 1] and vector b = [1; 3].\n\nApplying matrix M to these vectors should give me the corresponding points after transformation. Let's denote the transformed points as a' = [a1; a2] and b' = [b1; b2].\n\nGiven the problem, I know that when M is applied to [2; -1], it gives [9; 3], and when applied to [1; -3], it gives [7; -1]. Wait a second, but I don't have the specific matrix M. So I"

Since M is a 2x2 matrix, let's denote it as:\n\nM = [ [m11, m12],\n       [m21, m22] ]\n\nThen, applying M to the vector [2; -1] gives:\n\nm11*2 + m12*(-1) = 9\n\nm21*2 + m22*(-1) = 3\n\nSimilarly, applying M to [1; -3] gives:\n\nm11*1 + m12*(-3) = 7\n\nm21*1 + m22*(-3) = -1\n\nSo now I have two systems of equations for the first row and second row of the matrix.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\nFor the first row (the top row of M):\n\n2m11 - m12 = 9\n\n1m11 - 3m12 = 7\n\nSimilarly, for the second row (the bottom row of M):\n\n2m21 - m22 = 3\n\n1m21 - 3m22 = -1\n\nSo I need to solve these two systems to find m11, m12, m21, m22.\n\nLet me start with the first system for the top row:\n\nEquation 1: 2m11 - m12 = 9\n\nEquation 2: m11 - 3m12 = 7\n\nLet me solve for m11 and m12. Let's use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 2 to get:\n\n2m11 - 6m12 = 14\n\nThen subtract equation 1 from this:\n\n(2m11 -6m12) - (2m11 - m12) = 14 - 9\n\n2m11 -6m12 -2m11 + m12 = 5\n\n(-5m12) = 5\n\nSo m12 = -1\n\nThen plug back into equation 2:\n\nm11 - 3*(-1) = 7 => m11 +3 =7 => m11 =4\n\nSo the first row of M is ["

Perhaps using the general formula for the image of a line under a matrix?\n\nI remember that if you have a line defined by ax + by +c=0, then under the transformation M, the image can be found by solving Mx = y.\n\nWait, but maybe it's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the image line is given by M*(line in R^2).\n\nBut maybe it's the same result as finding two points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the line y=2x+1 in parametric form. Let's see.\n\nLet me write the line as:\n\nx = t\n\ny = 2t +1\n\nSo any point on the line can be written as [t; 2t+1], where t is a real number.\n\nThen, applying the transformation M to this point:\n\nM*[t;2t+1] = [4t - (2t+1); 2t + (2t+1)] = [4t -2t -1; 2t +2t +1] = [2t -1;4t +1]\n\nSo the transformed point is (2t -1, 4t +1).

Since linear transformations can sometimes shift the line, but wait, actually, matrices in linear algebra are linear transformations, which include scaling, rotation, shearing, etc., but they also include translations? Wait, no! Wait, matrices multiplied by vectors are linear transformations, which do not include translations. Wait, but the line y=2x+1 is an affine line, not through the origin.
