            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where a matrix M transforms one vector to another and another vector to another. I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that applying a matrix to a vector is a linear transformation. So, if I can express the line in terms of vectors, maybe I can apply M to each point on the line and see what happens. But the line is an infinite set of points, so that approach might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parametrize the line and then apply the transformation. Let me try that.\n\nThe line is y = 2x + 1. I can represent any point on this line as (x, 2x + 1). So, if I let x be a parameter, say t, then the point can be written as (t, 2t + 1). Let me denote this vector as **v(t)** = [t, 2t + 1]^T.\n\nNow, applying the transformation M to **v(t)** should give me the corresponding point on the image of the line. That is, M**v(t)** = [something with t]. I need to express this in terms of t and then see if I can write it as y = mx + b.\n\nBut wait, I don't know what M actually is. The problem gives me two specific transformations: it takes [2, -1] to [9, 3] and [1, -3] to [7, -1]. So, I can use these two points to construct the matrix M, assuming M is a 2x2 matrix.\n\nLet me denote M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n      [c  d]\n\nSo, applying M to [2, -1] gives [a*2 + b*(-1), c*2 + d*(-1)] = [9, 3]. Similarly, applying M to [1, -3] gives [a*1 + b*(-3), c*1 + d*(-3)] = [7, -1].\n\nSo, I can set up two equations from the first transformation:\n\n2a - b = 9   ...(1)\n2c - d = 3   ...(2)\n\nAnd two more equations from the second transformation:\n\na - 3b = 7   ...("

The second transformation:\n\nFor the first component of the result (equation related to a and b):\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7\n\nSimilarly, second component (c and d):\n\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1\n\nYes, that's correct. So equations (3) is a - 3b =7 and (4) is c - 3d = -1.\n\nNow, we have two separate systems of equations for the a,b part and the c,d part. Let me solve for a and b first.\n\nFrom equations (1) and (3):\n\nEquation (1): 2a - b = 9\n\nEquation (3): a - 3b =7\n\nI need to solve these two equations for a and b. Let me write the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\n\nEquation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for b:\n\nFrom (1): b = 2a - 9\n\nThen substitute into equation 3:\n\na - 3*(2a - 9) =7\n\na -6a +27 =7\n\n-5a +27 =7\n\n-5a =7-27 = -20\n\nSo a = (-20)/(-5) = 4\n\nThen substitute a =4 into b = 2a -9:\n\nb = 2*4 -9=8-9 = -1\n\nSo a=4, b=-1.\n\nNow let's check equations (1) and (3):\n\nEquation1: 2*4 - (-1)=8 +1 =9, correct.\n\nEquation3:4 -3*(-1)=4 +3=7, correct. Good.\n\nNow, moving on to equations (2) and (4):\n\nEquation (2): 2c - d =3\n\nEquation (4):c -3d = -1\n\nSolve these for c and d.\n\nLet me write equations again:\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d =3\n\nEquation4: c -3d = -1\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for d: d=2c -3\n\nSubstitute into"

Now, I can express this as:\n\nLet me denote the image point as (x, y). So:\n\nx =2t -1\n\ny=4t +1\n\nI need to eliminate t from these equations.\n\nFrom x=2t -1, solve for t: t=(x +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into y="

We can express it as y -2x =1.\n\nUnder a linear transformation, the image line can be found by solving for the pre-images or using the transformation rules.\n\nBut I think the parametrization approach is solid here.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we take two points on the original line, apply M, and then find the line through the transformed points.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nPick t=0: (0,1). Transform under M: M*[0;1]= [0*4 + (-1)*1= -1, 2*0 +1*1=1]. So (-1,1).\n\nPick t=1: (1,3). Transform under M: [4*1 + (-1)*3=4 -3=1, 2*1 +1*3=2 +3=5]. So (1,5).\n\nSo two points on the image line are (-1,1) and (1,5).\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the line through these two points.\n\nCompute the slope m:"
