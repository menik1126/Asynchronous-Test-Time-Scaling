The question is about cutting the tetrahedron with a plane that's parallel to edges AB and CD and lying halfway between them. Then, we need to find the surface area of one of the resulting pieces. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the regular tetrahedron. A regular tetrahedron has four triangular faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. Each edge is of equal length, which in this case is 2. So, edges AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, and CD are all 2 units long. Cool, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem mentions a plane that's parallel to edges AB and CD. Hmm, planes being parallel to lines. I think when a plane is parallel to two edges that are skew lines, the plane will intersect the tetrahedron in some quadrilateral or triangular shape. Wait, are AB and CD skew lines? In a tetrahedron, any two edges that don't intersect and aren't parallel are skew lines. So yes, AB and CD are skew lines.\n\nSince the plane is parallel to both AB and CD, it must be cutting through the tetrahedron in such a way that the intersection is parallel to both these edges. So, the plane is going to slice through the tetrahedron somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe plane is lying halfway between AB and CD. Hmm, so how do we define halfway in three dimensions? I suppose it means that the distance between the plane and each of these edges is the same. But since AB and CD are opposite edges, maybe the halfway point is equidistant from both in terms of some parameter.\n\nWait, let me think. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are symmetric, so halfway between AB and CD would be along the line that goes through the midpoints of AB and CD. But wait, in a tetrahedron, the midpoints of AB and CD are actually endpoints of a space diagonal. So, the plane is cutting through this space diagonal at its midpoint? That might make sense.\n\nBut wait, no, because the plane is parallel to AB and CD. So, if the plane is halfway between AB and CD, maybe it's cutting through the middle of the tetrahedron in some"

Let me choose coordinates for the tetrahedron such that calculations are easier. Let me recall that in a regular tetrahedron, one way to assign coordinates is to place the vertices at (1,1,1), (-1,-1,1), (-1,1,-1), and (1,-1,-1), scaled appropriately. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps place one vertex at the origin, and others in a way that edges can be calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to set coordinates so that edge AB is along the x-axis, and CD is in some other direction. Let me try to set coordinates for the tetrahedron.\n\nLet me consider vertex A at (0,0,0), vertex B at (2,0,0), so AB is along the x-axis. Now, since it's a regular tetrahedron, the other vertices C and D must be placed such that all edges are length 2. Let me recall that in a regular tetrahedron, the coordinates can be set with vertices at (0,0,0), (2,0,0), (1, sqrt(3),0), and (1, sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(6)/sqrt(3)).

Now, the other two vertices C and D must be placed such that all edges from A and B to C and D are length 2, and edges between C and D are also length 2.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of C as (x1, y1, z1) and D as (x2, y2, z2). Since AC = 2, so sqrt(x1² + y1² + z1²) = 2. Similarly, BC = 2, so sqrt((x1 - 2)^2 + y1² + z1²) = 2. Similarly for AD and BD.\n\nLet me first find coordinates for"

So, the intersection of these two spheres is a circle. Let me compute coordinates of C.\n\nThe intersection of two spheres:\n\nSphere A: x² + y² + z² = 4\n\nSphere B: (x - 2)^2 + y² + z² = 4\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 2)^2 - x² = 0 => x² -4x +4 - x² = -4x +4 = 0 => -4x +4 =0 => x = 1.\n\nSo, x = 1.\n\nThen, substituting back into Sphere A: 1² + y² + z² = 4 => y² + z² = 3.\n\nSo, the coordinates of C are (1, y, z) where y² + z² = 3.\n\nSimilarly, since it's a regular tetrahedron, the distances between C and D should also be 2.

Since it's parallel to two opposite edges, the intersection would be a quadrilateral.\n\nNow, since it's halfway between AB and CD, the plane is equidistant from AB and CD.
