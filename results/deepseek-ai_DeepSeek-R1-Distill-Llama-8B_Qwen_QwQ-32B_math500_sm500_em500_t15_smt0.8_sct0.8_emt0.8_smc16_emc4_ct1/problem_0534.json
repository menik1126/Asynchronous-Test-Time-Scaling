For each choice of Yann, Camille must choose from the remaining 9 dishes to avoid duplication.\n\nFinally, calculate the total number of combinations by multiplying Yann's choices by Camille's choices, which gives 10 multiplied by 9, resulting in 90 different combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different combinations of meals Yann and Camille can order, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - **Total Dishes Available:** 10\n   - **Restriction:** Yann and Camille cannot order the same dish.\n   - **Order Matters:** Yann ordering Chicken and Camille ordering Fish is different from Yann ordering Fish and Camille ordering Chicken.\n\n2. **Calculate the Combinations:**\n   - **First, choose a dish for Yann:** There are 10 possible dishes.\n   - **Second, choose a dish for Camille:** After Yann's choice, there are 9 remaining dishes.\n\n3. **Multiply the Choices:**\n   - Since each choice is independent, multiply the number of options for Yann by the number of options for Camille.\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ (for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (for Camille)} = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)",
