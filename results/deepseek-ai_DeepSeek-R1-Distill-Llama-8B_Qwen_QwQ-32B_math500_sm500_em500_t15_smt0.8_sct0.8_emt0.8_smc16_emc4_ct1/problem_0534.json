He has 10 choices since he can select any of the 10 dishes.\n\nAfter Yann has made his selection, Camille cannot choose the same dish as Yann. Therefore, Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\nTo find the total number of unique combinations, I'll multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has: 10 \u00d7 9 = 90.\n\nFinally, since the order of selection matters (Yann and Camille ordering different dishes is different from Camille and Yann ordering different dishes), I don't need to divide by any factorial to account for permutations.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to find the number of different meal combinations Yann and Camille can order if they refuse to order the same dish, considering that the order matters (i.e., Yann ordering dish A and Camille ordering dish B is different from Camille ordering dish A and Yann ordering dish B).\n\n1. **Total Number of Dishes:**  \n   There are 10 distinct dishes available on the menu.\n\n2. **Choosing for Yann:**  \n   Yann has 10 choices (since he can select any of the 10 dishes).\n\n3. **Choosing for Camille:**  \n   After Yann has chosen a dish, Camille cannot choose the same dish. Therefore, Camille has 9 remaining choices.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Combinations:**  \n   Since the order matters, we multiply the number of choices for both Yann and Camille:\n   \\[\n   10 \\text{ (choices for Yann)} \\times 9 \\text{ (choices for Camille)} = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
