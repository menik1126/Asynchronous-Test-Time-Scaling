            "output": "First, I need to determine the prime factorization of 196. I know that 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2.\n\nDividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. Since 98 is also even, I divide it by 2 to get 49.\n\nNext, I check if 49 is divisible by 2. It isn't, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. However, 49 divided by 3 doesn't result in a whole number.\n\nContinuing to the next prime number, 5, I find that 49 divided by 5 isn't a whole number either.\n\nI then try 7. Dividing 49 by 7 gives me 7. This means 49 is 7 multiplied by 7.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is 2 squared multiplied by 7 squared.\n\nNow, to find the number of positive whole-number divisors, I can use the formula for calculating the number of divisors. The formula is to add one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiply those results.\n\nApplying this, I add one to each exponent: 2 becomes 3, and 7 squared becomes 8.\n\nFinally, multiplying these together: 3 times 8 equals 24.\n\nTherefore, 196 has 24 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of 196.**\n   \n   - **Step 1:** Start by dividing 196 by the smallest prime number, 2.\n     \\[\n     196 \\div 2 = 98\n     \\]\n   - **Step 2:** Continue dividing by 2.\n     \\[\n     98 \\div 2 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Step 3:** Now, 49 is not divisible by 2. Check the next prime number, which is 3. However, \\(49 \\div 3\\) is not a whole number.\n   - **Step 4:** Next, try dividing by 5. Similarly, \\(49 \\div 5\\) does not result in a whole number.\n   - **Step 5:** Finally, divide by 7.\n     \\[\n     49 \\div 7 = 7\n     \\]\n   - **"

Let's correct this:\n\n   The correct number of divisors for \\(196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n   \n   But wait, this doesn't seem right because 196 is a larger number and typically has more divisors. Let's re-examine:\n   \n   Actually, for \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\), the exponents are both 2, so:\n   \\[\n   (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\n   \\]\n   \n   This means 196 has **9 positive whole-number divisors**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
