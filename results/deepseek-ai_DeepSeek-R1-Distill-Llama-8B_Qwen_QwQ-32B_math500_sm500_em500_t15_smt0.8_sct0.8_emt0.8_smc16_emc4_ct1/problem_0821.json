I need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this. First, since ω³ = 1, ω is a cube root of unity. I remember that cube roots of unity satisfy the equation ω³ = 1, which can be factored as (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. So, the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1.\n\nNow, I need to consider the possible values of ω. There are two non-real cube roots of unity, ω and ω². They are complex conjugates of each other. So, maybe I can consider both cases: ω ≠ 1 and ω² ≠ 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem just says ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. So, ω could be 1, ω, or ω². Let me check what happens when ω = 1.\n\nIf ω = 1, then the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1^2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, when ω = 1, the sum is 1.\n\nNow, what about when ω is the non-real cube root, say ω = e^(2πi/3)? Similarly, ω² = e^(4πi/3). Both are complex numbers, and they satisfy ω² + ω + 1 = 0.\n\nBut I need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nSince ω and ω² are roots of ω² + ω + 1 = 0, maybe I can use that identity to simplify the denominators.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a common denominator for the two fractions.\n\nLet me denote the expression as S:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega"

Let me compute that:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*(1 + ω²) + ω*(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so this becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = (1 + 1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (ω + ω²)\n\nFrom the identity, ω² + ω + 1 = 0, so ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, the denominator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting! So the denominator simplifies to 1.\n\nSo, let's compute S:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} \\left( (1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega) \\right )\n\\]\n\nBut since the denominator is 1, S is just (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω². Again, from ω² + ω = -1, so S = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nWait, that's the same as when ω = 1. So, regardless of whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², the sum S is 1.\n\nBut that seems odd because 1 is a value when ω is 1, but I thought that for non-real cube roots, the expression might have different values. But according to this, it's still 1.\n\nWait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the denominator.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nCompute (1 + ω)(1 + ω²):\n\n1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.\n\nBut ω³ = 1, so it's 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + (ω + ω²).\n\nGiven ω² + ω = -1 (from ω² + ω + 1 = 0), so this is 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo, denominator is indeed 1. Then numerator is:\n\n("

But the problem says \"find all possible values\", so maybe 1 is the only value.\n\nBut let me test with actual numbers. Let me take ω = e^(2πi/3) which is equal to -1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nCompute 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω²: ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, compute 1/(1 + ω):\n\n1 / (1/2 + i√3/2) = (1)/( (1 + i√3)/2 ) = 2/(1 + i√3) = Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i√3):\n\n2*(1 - i√3)/ (1 + 3) ) = (2 - 2i√3)/4 = (1 - i√3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute 1/(1 + ω²):\n\n1 / (1/2 - i√3/2) = 2/(1 - i√3) = Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i√3):\n\n2*(1 + i√3)/(1 + 3) = (2 + 2i√3)/4 = (1 + i√3)/2.\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n(1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = [1 + 1]/2 + [-i√3 + i√3]/2 = 2/2 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo that checks out. Similarly, for ω = ω², the same calculation would hold, and for ω = 1, it's also 1.\n\nSo, regardless of ω, S"
