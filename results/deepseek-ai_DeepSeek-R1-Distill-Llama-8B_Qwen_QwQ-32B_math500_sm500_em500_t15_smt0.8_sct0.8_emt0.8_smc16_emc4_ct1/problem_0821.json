            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where \u03c9 is a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nHmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this. First, since \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, \u03c9 is a cube root of unity. I remember that cube roots of unity satisfy the equation \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, which can be factored as (\u03c9 - 1)(\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1) = 0. So, the cube roots of unity are 1, \u03c9, and \u03c9\u00b2, where \u03c9 \u2260 1 and \u03c9\u00b2 \u2260 1.\n\nNow, I need to consider the possible values of \u03c9. There are two non-real cube roots of unity, \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2. They are complex conjugates of each other. So, maybe I can consider both cases: \u03c9 \u2260 1 and \u03c9\u00b2 \u2260 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem just says \u03c9 is a complex number such that \u03c9\u00b3 = 1. So, \u03c9 could be 1, \u03c9, or \u03c9\u00b2. Let me check what happens when \u03c9 = 1.\n\nIf \u03c9 = 1, then the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1^2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, when \u03c9 = 1, the sum is 1.\n\nNow, what about when \u03c9 is the non-real cube root, say \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3)? Similarly, \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3). Both are complex numbers, and they satisfy \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0.\n\nBut I need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\n\\]\n\nSince \u03c9 and \u03c9\u00b2 are roots of \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0, maybe I can use that identity to simplify the denominators.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a common denominator for the two fractions.\n\nLet me denote the expression as S:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega"

            "model": "small",
            "output": "^2}\n\\]\n\nTo combine these, I need to find a common denominator, which would be (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2). Let me compute that:\n\n(1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1*(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) + \u03c9*(1 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3\n\nBut \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so this becomes 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = (1 + 1) + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2) = 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2)\n\nFrom the identity, \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0, so \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, the denominator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting! So the denominator simplifies to 1.\n\nSo, let's compute S:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} \\left( (1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega) \\right )\n\\]\n\nBut since the denominator is 1, S is just (1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + 1 + \u03c9) = 2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2. Again, from \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 = -1, so S = 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nWait, that's the same as when \u03c9 = 1. So, regardless of whether \u03c9 is 1, \u03c9, or \u03c9\u00b2, the sum S is 1.\n\nBut that seems odd because 1 is a value when \u03c9 is 1, but I thought that for non-real cube roots, the expression might have different values. But according to this, it's still 1.\n\nWait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the denominator.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nCompute (1 + \u03c9)(1 + \u03c9\u00b2):\n\n1*1 + 1*\u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9*1 + \u03c9*\u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b3.\n\nBut \u03c9\u00b3 = 1, so it's 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 2 + (\u03c9 + \u03c9\u00b2).\n\nGiven \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 = -1 (from \u03c9\u00b2 + \u03c9 + 1 = 0), so this is 2 + (-1) = 1.\n\nSo, denominator is indeed 1. Then numerator is:\n\n("

But the problem says \"find all possible values\", so maybe 1 is the only value.\n\nBut let me test with actual numbers. Let me take \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3) which is equal to -1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nCompute 1 + \u03c9 = 1 + (-1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 + i\u221a3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + \u03c9\u00b2: \u03c9\u00b2 = e^(4\u03c0i/3) = -1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo 1 + \u03c9\u00b2 = 1 + (-1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = 1/2 - i\u221a3/2.\n\nSo, compute 1/(1 + \u03c9):\n\n1 / (1/2 + i\u221a3/2) = (1)/( (1 + i\u221a3)/2 ) = 2/(1 + i\u221a3) = Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - i\u221a3):\n\n2*(1 - i\u221a3)/ (1 + 3) ) = (2 - 2i\u221a3)/4 = (1 - i\u221a3)/2.\n\nSimilarly, compute 1/(1 + \u03c9\u00b2):\n\n1 / (1/2 - i\u221a3/2) = 2/(1 - i\u221a3) = Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + i\u221a3):\n\n2*(1 + i\u221a3)/(1 + 3) = (2 + 2i\u221a3)/4 = (1 + i\u221a3)/2.\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n(1 - i\u221a3)/2 + (1 + i\u221a3)/2 = [1 + 1]/2 + [-i\u221a3 + i\u221a3]/2 = 2/2 + 0 = 1.\n\nSo that checks out. Similarly, for \u03c9 = \u03c9\u00b2, the same calculation would hold, and for \u03c9 = 1, it's also 1.\n\nSo, regardless of \u03c9, S"
