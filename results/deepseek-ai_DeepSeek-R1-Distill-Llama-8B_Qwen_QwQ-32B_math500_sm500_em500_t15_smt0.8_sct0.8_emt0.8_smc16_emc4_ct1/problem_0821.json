Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\) means that \\(\\omega\\) is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, and two complex numbers. Let me denote them as \\(\\omega\\), \\(\\omega^2\\), and \\(1\\). These satisfy the equation \\(x^3 - 1 = 0\\), which factors into \\((x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\\). So, the non-real roots are the solutions to \\(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\\). \n\nTherefore, \\(\\omega\\) can be either \\( \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\). These are complex conjugates of each other. So, I can consider both cases.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to compute the expression for each \\(\\omega\\), so I need to compute it for each of the three cube roots. However, let's see if it's symmetric.\n\nIf I take \\(\\omega = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\(\\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + 1}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\). But let me also check the other roots.\n\nLet’s take \\(\\omega = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\). Let me compute \\(1 + \\omega\\) and \\(1 + \\omega^2\\) separately.\n\nFirst, \\(1 + \\omega = 1 + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2} = \\frac{2 - 1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\(1 + \\omega^2 = 1 + \\left( \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{2"

Hmm, but when I took \\(\\omega = 1\\), I also got 1. So does that mean that regardless of which cube root of unity \\(\\omega\\) is, this expression is always equal to 1?\n\nBut that seems odd because sometimes expressions can have different values depending on the root. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, when I plug in \\(\\omega = 1\\), everything is straightforward, so the expression is 1.

For the complex roots, I rationalized the denominators and found the sum was 1. For \\(\\omega = 1\\), it's 1 as well. So maybe the expression always equals 1, regardless of \\(\\omega\\). Hmm, is there another way to see this without computing each case?\n\nLet me consider the identity that for cube roots of unity, \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\).\n\nThis is a key identity. So, \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), so \\(1 + \\omega = -\\omega^2\\) and \\(1 + \\omega^2 = -\\omega\\).\n\nTherefore, substituting into the expression:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{- \\omega^2} + \\frac{1}{- \\omega} = -\\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega^2} + \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\right)\\).\n\nNow, let me compute \\(\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{\\omega^2}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\omega^3 = 1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{\\omega} = \\omega^2\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{\\omega^2} = \\omega\\).\n\nSo, substituting these:\n\n\\(-\\left( \\omega^2 + \\omega \\right)\\).\n\nBut from the identity \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), we know that \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\).

So the only possible value is 1.\n\nBut wait, just to confirm, let's compute the expression for another root, say \\(\\omega = \\omega^2\\).

Therefore, each term is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\), so the expression becomes \\(2 \\times \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2}\\).\n\nWait, but we know from the identity that \\(1 + \\omega^2 = -\\omega\\). So \\(2 \\times \\frac{1}{- \\omega}\\). But \\(\\frac{1}{\\omega} = \\omega^2\\), so it becomes \\(2 \\times (-\\omega^2)\\).

But wait, maybe I shouldn't have substituted \\(\\omega^2\\) for \\(\\omega\\), because \\(\\omega\\) is a specific root, maybe this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps not, because all roots are similar.\n\nWait, I think the first method, using the identity \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), gives a general proof that the expression is always 1, regardless of \\(\\omega\\). So perhaps my alternative approach was a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's simpler to consider all three cube roots and compute the expression for each, but since I already did that and both complex roots gave 1, and so does the real root, perhaps 1 is the only value.\n\nBut just to ensure, let me think if there's any other approach.\n\nAnother idea: Let me set \\( \\omega \\neq 1 \\), and manipulate the expression.\n\nLet me denote \\( S = \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\omega^2} \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( (1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2) \\).\n\nSince \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), \\(1 + \\omega = -\\omega^2\\) and \\(1 + \\omega^2 = -"

Therefore, the expression S can be written as:\n\n\\( S = \\frac{1 + \\omega^2 + 1 + \\omega}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} \\).\n\nWait, no, actually, when adding fractions, the numerator is \\( (1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega) \\), and the denominator is the product.\n\nWait, yes, that's right. So:\n\n\\( S = \\frac{(1 + \\omega^2) + (1 + \\omega)}{(1 + \\omega)(1 + \\omega^2)} \\).\n\nThe numerator is \\(2 + \\omega + \\omega^2\\). But since \\(1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0\\), then \\(\\omega + \\omega^2 = -1\\). Therefore, numerator is \\(2 + (-1) = 1\\). The denominator is 1, so S = 1/1 = 1.\n\nTherefore, this shows that regardless of which cube root of unity (other than 1, but even when \\(\\omega =1\\), let's check that case again):\n\nWait, if \\(\\omega =1\\), then \\(1 + \\omega = 2\\), \\(1 + \\omega^2 = 2\\), so the expression is \\(1/2 + 1/2 =1\\). So indeed, even when \\(\\omega =1\\), it's 1. Therefore, the expression is always 1, so the only possible value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1}.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all possible values\". Since \\(\\omega^3 =1\\), there are three roots, but in all cases, the expression evaluates to 1, so the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nHmm, but let me check once more with another approach. Let me suppose \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive cube root of unity, so \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\). Let me compute numerically.\n\nLet me take \\(\\omega = e^{2\\pi i /3} ="
