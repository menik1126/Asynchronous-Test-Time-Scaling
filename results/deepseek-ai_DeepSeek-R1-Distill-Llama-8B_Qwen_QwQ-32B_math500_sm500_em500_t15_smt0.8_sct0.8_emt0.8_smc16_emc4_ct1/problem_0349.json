            "output": "First, I'll write down the original expression: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. Without any parentheses, the value is 13.\n\nNext, I need to explore different ways to add parentheses to minimize the value. I'll start by grouping larger numbers together.\n\nFor example, grouping 2 + 3 first: (1 + (2 + 3)) - 4 + 5 + 6. This simplifies to 1 + 5 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13.\n\nThen, I'll try grouping 1 + 2 + 3: ((1 + 2) + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6. This equals 6 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13.\n\nNow, I'll consider grouping multiple numbers, like (1 + 2 + 3 - 4). This gives 0 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13.\n\nI'll also try grouping 5 + 6: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + (5 + 6) = 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 11 = 13.\n\nNext, grouping 3 - 4: 1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6. This equals 1 + 2 - 1 + 5 + 6 = 13.\n\nI'll explore combining more terms, such as 1 + 2: (1 + 2) + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 13.\n\nThen, grouping 2 + 3 - 4: 1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6 = 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 = 13.\n\nAfter trying several groupings, I realize that changing the order doesn't affect the result. All groupings yield the same value of 13.\n\nFinally, I'll consider the initial assumption that adding parentheses doesn't change the order of terms. Since all possible groupings don't alter the sum, the minimum possible value remains 13.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum possible value of the expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\) by adding parentheses without changing the order"

    "question": "The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)\n\nEnter your answer as a single value.",
