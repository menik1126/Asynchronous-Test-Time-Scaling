            "output": "To determine how far Bill is from his starting point, I'll start by analyzing his movements.\n\nFirst, Bill walks half a mile south. Then, he goes three quarters of a mile east. Finally, he walks another half a mile south.\n\nTo simplify his path, I'll combine the southward distances, which adds up to one mile. Eastward, he moves three quarters of a mile.\n\nWith these totals, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the straight-line distance from his starting point. The formula is the square root of (east distance squared plus south distance squared).\n\nPlugging in his distances, the calculation becomes the square root of (0.75 squared plus 1 squared), which equals the square root of 1.5625. This simplifies to 1.25 miles.\n\nTherefore, Bill is 1.25 miles directly from his starting point.\n</think>\n\nTo find out how many miles Bill is from his starting point, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate Total South Distance:**\n   - First south direction: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile\n   - Second south direction: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile\n   - **Total South Distance:** \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile\n\n2. **Calculate East Distance:**\n   - East direction: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile\n\n3. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - The straight-line distance (hypotenuse) is calculated using:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{East Distance})^2 + (\\text{South Distance})^2}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + (1)^2} = \\sqrt{0.5625 + 1} = \\sqrt{1.5625} = 1.25 \\text{ miles}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{1.25}\n   \\]"
