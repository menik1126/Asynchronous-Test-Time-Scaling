            "output": "Bill starts by walking 1/2 mile south, which moves him 0.5 miles south on the coordinate plane. \n\nNext, he walks 3/4 mile east, taking him 0.75 miles east from his current position. \n\nFinally, he walks an additional 1/2 mile south, moving 0.5 miles further south, resulting in a total of 1 mile south. \n\nCombining these movements, Bill is 1 mile south and 0.75 miles east of his starting point. To find the straight-line distance from his starting point, we use the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nDistance = sqrt((1)^2 + (0.75)^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.5625) = sqrt(1.5625) \u2248 1.25 miles.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**1. Initial Position:**  \nBill starts at the origin point \\( (0, 0) \\).\n\n**2. First Movement:**  \nBill walks \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.  \nMovement on the y-axis (south direction):\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{2} = -0.5 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nNew position: \\( (0, -0.5) \\)\n\n**3. Second Movement:**  \nBill walks \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.  \nMovement on the x-axis (east direction):\n\\[\nx = +\\frac{3}{4} = +0.75 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\nNew position: \\( (0.75, -0.5) \\)\n\n**4. Third Movement:**  \nBill walks another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.  \nMovement on the y-axis (south direction):\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = -1 \\text{ mile}\n\\]\nNew position: \\( (0.75, -1) \\)\n\n**5. Calculate the Straight-Line Distance:**  \nTo find the straight-line distance from the starting point \\( (0, 0) \\) to the final position \\( (0.75, -1) \\), we use the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1"
