Let's denote the number of boys as \\( b \\) and the number of girls as \\( g \\).\n\nWe know that the number of girls is a multiple of 13, so \\( g = 13k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nAlso, there are more girls than boys, which means \\( g > b \\).\n\nThe total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, so \\( b + g = 35 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( g \\) with \\( 13k \\), we get \\( b + 13k = 35 \\).\n\nSince the number of boys must be a whole number, \\( 35 - 13k \\) must be a positive integer and represent the number of boys.\n\nI'll test possible values of \\( k \\) to find valid solutions.\n\nIf \\( k = 1 \\), then \\( b = 35 - 13(1) = 22 \\). This means there are 22 boys and 13 girls, satisfying \\( g > b \\).\n\nIf \\( k = 2 \\), then \\( b = 35 - 13(2) = 9 \\). This means there are 9 boys and 26 girls, also satisfying \\( g > b \\).\n\nIf \\( k = 3 \\), then \\( b = 35 - 13(3) = -4 \\). A negative number of boys isn't possible, so \\( k = 3 \\) is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the valid values for \\( k \\) are 1 and 2, corresponding to 22 boys and 9 boys, respectively.\n\nBetween these options, the number of boys must be 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls > Number of boys.\n\n**Let’s define:**\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of boys.\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of girls.\n\n**We know:**\n1. \\( g = 13k \\) where \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n2. \\( g > b \\) ⇒ \\( 13k > b \\).\n3. \\( b + g = 35 \\).\n\n**Substitute \\( g \\) in the third"
