But this means there are more boys than girls, which contradicts the condition.\n- When \\( g = 26 \\), substituting gives \\( b = 35 - 26 = 9 \\). Here, there are more girls than boys, which satisfies the condition.\n\nSince the next multiple of 13 (39) exceeds the total number of students, the only valid solution is \\( g = 26 \\) and \\( b = 9 \\).\n\nTherefore, there are 9 boys attending the meeting.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (\\( g \\)) is a multiple of 13.\n- Number of girls is more than the number of boys.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( b \\) = number of boys\n- \\( g \\) = number of girls\n\n**Step 1:** Write the equation for the total number of students.\n\n\\[\nb + g = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Since the number of girls is a multiple of 13, let's consider the possible values for \\( g \\).\n\nPossible values for \\( g \\):\n\\[\ng = 13, 26, 39, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the total number of students is 35, \\( g \\) must be less than or equal to 35.\n\nSo, possible values for \\( g \\) are:\n\\[\ng = 13 \\text{ or } 26\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Apply the condition that there are more girls than boys (\\( g > b \\))"
