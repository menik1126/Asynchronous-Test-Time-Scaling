            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to simplify this nested radical expression and write it with a rational denominator. The expression is the square root of the cube root of the square root of 1/729. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should handle the innermost part of the expression. That would be the square root of 1/729. I know that taking the square root of a fraction is the same as taking the square root of the numerator divided by the square root of the denominator. So, let me compute that.\n\nThe square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729... Hmm, I remember that 27 squared is 729 because 27 times 27 is 729. So, the square root of 729 is 27. Therefore, the square root of 1/729 is 1/27. Okay, so now the expression becomes the cube root of 1/27.\n\nNow, the next part is the cube root of 1/27. I think the cube root of a fraction is just the cube root of the numerator divided by the cube root of the denominator. So, the cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 27 is 3 because 3 times 3 times 3 is 27. So, the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. \n\nSo now, the entire expression simplifies down to the square root of 1/3. Wait, but the original expression is the square root of all that, so now I have sqrt(sqrt[3]{sqrt(1/729)}) = sqrt(1/3). \n\nHmm, I need to simplify sqrt(1/3). I think that's the same as 1 over the square root of 3, right? So, sqrt(1/3) = 1/sqrt(3). But the question says to write it with a rational denominator. Rational denominator means no square roots in the denominator, I think. So, how do I rationalize the denominator here?\n\nI remember that to rationalize the denominator, I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the square root of 3. So, 1/sqrt(3) times sqrt(3)/sqrt(3) would give me sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(3))."

            "output": " Since sqrt(3) times sqrt(3) is 3, that simplifies to sqrt(3)/3. \n\nSo, putting it all together: sqrt(sqrt[3]{sqrt(1/729)}) simplifies to sqrt(1/3), which is equal to 1/sqrt(3), and then rationalizing the denominator gives sqrt(3)/3.\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the inside: sqrt(1/729) is indeed 1/27. Then the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then the square root of 1/3 is 1/sqrt(3), which becomes sqrt(3)/3 after rationalizing. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll go through the exponents again. The original expression is a square root of a cube root of a square root. So, that's like taking the 1/2 power of the 1/3 power of the 1/2 power of 1/729. Let me compute the exponents as numbers.\n\nSo, sqrt is 1/2, cube root is 1/3, and the next sqrt is 1/2. So, the exponents multiply: 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2 = (1/2)^2 * 1/3 = 1/4 * 1/3 = 1/12. So, the entire expression is (1/729)^(1/12). Let me compute 1/729 to the 1/12 power.\n\nWait, 729 is 9^3 or 3^6, right? Because 3^6 is 729. So, 1/729 is 3^(-6). Therefore, (3^(-6))^(1/12) is 3^(-6*(1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/sqrt(3). So, that's another way to see it. So, same result, 1/sqrt(3), which becomes sqrt(3)/3. Yeah, that confirms it.\n\nI think that's consistent. So, all my steps check out. So, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is sqrt(3)/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified expression with a rational denominator is \\boxed{\\"
