            "output": "First, I need to identify the innermost expression, which is the cube root of 1/729. I know that 729 is 9 to the power of 3, so the cube root of 1/729 simplifies to 1/9.\n\nNext, I take the square root of 1/9. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 9 is 3, so the square root of 1/9 is 1/3.\n\nFinally, I take the square root of 1/3 to rationalize the denominator. The square root of 1 is still 1, and the square root of 3 remains \u221a3. Therefore, the final simplified expression is \u221a3/3.\n</think>\n\nLet's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate the innermost cube root.**\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{729}} = \\frac{1}{9}\n\\]\nSince \\(729 = 9^3\\), the cube root of 729 is 9.\n\n**Step 2: Take the square root of the result from Step 1.**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nThe square root of 9 is 3.\n\n**Step 3: Take the square root of the result from Step 2.**\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}\n\\]"
