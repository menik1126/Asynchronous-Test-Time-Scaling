            "output": "I see that I need to find the average price of Juan's 70s stamps. \n\nFirst, I should identify which countries had stamps issued in the 70s. Looking at the chart, Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain all have entries for the 70s.\n\nNext, I need to determine how many stamps Juan bought in each country during that decade. \n\nFor Brazil, there are 12 stamps from the 70s. For France, there are 12 stamps as well. Peru has 6 stamps, and Spain has 13 stamps in the 70s.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the total cost for each country's 70s stamps. Brazil's total is 12 stamps × 6 cents each = 72 cents. France's total is 12 × 6 = 72 cents. Peru's total is 6 × 4 = 24 cents, and Spain's total is 13 × 5 = 65 cents.\n\nAdding up all the total costs: 72 + 72 + 24 + 65 equals 233 cents.\n\nTo find the total number of 70s stamps, I'll add them up: 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 equals 43 stamps.\n\nFinally, the average price is the total cost divided by the number of stamps: 233 ÷ 43 equals approximately 5.44 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Countries and Decade\n- **Countries in the 70s**: Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain.\n- **Prices**:\n  - Brazil: 6 cents\n  - France: 6 cents\n  - Peru: 4 cents\n  - Spain: 5 cents\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Stamps in the 70s\n- **Brazil**: 12 stamps\n- **France**: 12 stamps\n- **Peru**: 6 stamps\n- **Spain**: 13 stamps\n\n**Total number of 70s stamps**:\n\\[ 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \\text{ stamps} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost of 70s Stamps\n- **Brazil**: \\( 12 \\times 6 = 72 \\) cents\n- **France**: \\( 12 \\times 6 = 72 \\"
