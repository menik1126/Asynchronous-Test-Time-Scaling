Looking at the chart, Brazil and France stamps cost 12 cents each, Peru stamps cost 12 cents each, and Spain stamps cost 6 cents each.\n\nNext, I'll determine the number of stamps for each country in the 70s. Brazil has 12 stamps, France has 9 stamps, Peru has 10 stamps, and Spain has 6 stamps.\n\nThen, I'll calculate the total cost for each country by multiplying the number of stamps by their respective prices. Brazil's total cost is 12 * 12 = 144 cents, France's total cost is 9 * 7 = 63 cents, Peru's total cost is 10 * 4 = 40 cents, and Spain's total cost is 6 * 6 = 36 cents.\n\nAfter that, I'll sum all the total costs to find the overall total cost for the 70s stamps: 144 + 63 + 40 + 36 = 283 cents.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the total cost by the number of stamps in the 70s to find the average price per stamp: 283 ÷ 24 ≈ 11.8 cents. Rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent, the average price is 11.8 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's 70's stamps, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices and Number of Stamps in the 70's:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 stamps at 12 cents each.\n   - **France:** 9 stamps at 12 cents each.\n   - **Peru:** 10 stamps at 7 cents each.\n   - **Spain:** 6 stamps at 6 cents each.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost for Each Country:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\( 12 \\text{ stamps} \\times 12 \\text{ cents} = 144 \\text{ cents} \\)\n   - **France:** \\( 9 \\text{ stamps} \\times 12 \\text{ cents} = 108 \\text{ cents} \\)\n   - **Peru:** \\( 10 \\text{ stamps} \\times 4 \\text{ cents} = 40 \\text{ cents} \\)\n   - **Spain:** \\( 6 \\text{ stamps} \\times 6 \\text{ cents} ="
