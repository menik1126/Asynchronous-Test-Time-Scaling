Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have fractions like this, you can combine them by finding a common denominator. The denominators here are (x - 3) and (x + 8). The common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). So, if I multiply both sides of the equation by this common denominator, I can eliminate the denominators and solve for C and D.\n\nLet me write that out. Multiply both sides by (x - 3)(x + 8):\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = (4x - 23).\n\nWait, let me check that. On the right side, the original denominator is x\u00b2 + 5x - 24. Let me factor that to see if it's indeed (x - 3)(x + 8). Factoring: 24 is 3*8, and 3 + 8 = 11, but wait, 3 + 8 is 11, but the middle term is 5x. Hmm, actually, (x - 3)(x + 8) would expand to x\u00b2 + 5x -24, right? Because 8*(-3) is -24, and 1*5x is 5x. So yes, the denominator factors correctly.\n\nOkay, so after multiplying both sides by (x - 3)(x + 8), the equation becomes:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23.\n\nNow, I need to collect like terms. Let me expand the left side:\n\nC*x + 8C + D*x - 3D = 4x - 23.\n\nCombine the x terms and the constant terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23.\n\nSince this equation must hold for all real x except x = 3 and x = -8, the coefficients of the corresponding terms must be equal. That means:\n\nC + D = 4 (coefficient of x)\n8C - "

Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nFrom equation 1: C = 4 - D.\n\nSubstitute C into equation 2:\n\n8*(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nCalculate 8*4 = 32, and 8*(-D) = -8D:\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nNow, subtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5.\n\nSo D is 5. Now, from equation 1:\n\nC = 4 - D = 4 - 5 = -1.\n\nTherefore, C is -1 and D is 5. The product CD is (-1)*(5) = -5.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Plug C = -1 and D = 5 back into the left side of the equation after multiplying by the common denominator:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = (-1)(x + 8) + 5(x - 3) = -x -8 + 5x -15 = ( -x + 5x ) + ( -8 -15 ) = 4x -23.\n\nWhich is exactly the right side. So that checks out.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using partial fractions or some other method, but I think the way I did it is correct. The crucial step was multiplying both sides by the common denominator to eliminate the denominators, leading to a linear equation in x. Then equating coefficients gives a system to solve for C and D. Yep, that seems solid.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that CD is indeed -5.\n</think>\n\nTo find the product \\( CD \\) of the integers \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), we start with the given equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3"
