            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the product CD where C and D are integers. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\]\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have two fractions on the left side, you can combine them by finding a common denominator. The denominators here are (x - 3) and (x + 8). So, the common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). That makes sense because they have different factors and can't be simplified further.\n\nLet me write down the left side combined:\n\n\\[\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\]\n\nWait, the denominator on the right side is x\u00b2 + 5x - 24. Maybe I should factor that to see if it's the same as (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me try:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to 5. Hmm, 8 and -3: 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. Yes! So,\n\nx\u00b2 + 5x - 24 = (x - 3)(x + 8)\n\nThat matches the common denominator I found. Good, so the denominators are the same on both sides, which means the numerators must be equal for all x (except where the original denominators were zero, which are x = 3 and x = -8).\n\nSo, the numerators are equal:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, I need to solve for C and D. Since this equation holds for all real x except 3 and -8, the coefficients of corresponding powers of x on both sides must be equal. That is, the coefficients for x and the constant terms must each be equal on both sides.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D\n\nCombine"

Let's use substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.\n\nFrom equation 1: C = 4 - D\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n8(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nCompute that:\n\n32 - 8D - 3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 - 11D = -23\n\nSubtract 32 from both sides:\n\n-11D = -23 - 32\n\n-11D = -55\n\nDivide both sides by -11:\n\nD = (-55)/(-11) = 5\n\nSo, D = 5. Now, substitute back into C = 4 - D:\n\nC = 4 - 5 = -1\n\nSo, C = -1 and D = 5.\n\nNow, the product CD is (-1) * 5 = -5.\n\nWait, just to double-check, I should plug these back into the equations to make sure I didn't make any mistake.\n\nFirst equation: C + D = -1 + 5 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSecond equation: 8C - 3D = 8*(-1) - 3*5 = -8 - 15 = -23, which is correct.\n\nAlright, that seems right. So, the product of C and D is -5.\n</think>\n\nThe product CD is found by solving the system of equations derived from equating the numerators of both sides. The solution gives C = -1 and D = 5, leading to the product CD = (-1)(5) = -5.\n\n\\[\\boxed{-5}\\]"
