            "output": "Alright, so I have this equation to solve: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I notice that both terms on the left side involve exponents. The left side has 3^{2x} and a constant 19, while the right side is 10^x. I wonder if there's a way to rewrite this equation to make it easier to solve. \n\nI remember that 3^{2x} is the same as (3^2)^x, which simplifies to 9^x. So, if I rewrite the equation, it becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That looks a bit cleaner.\n\nNow, the equation is 9^x + 19 = 10^x. I want to get all the terms on one side so I can maybe factor or find a substitution. Let me subtract 9^x from both sides:\n\n19 = 10^x - 9^x.\n\nHmm, okay, so 19 equals the difference between 10^x and 9^x. Maybe I can factor something out here. Let me think... Well, 10^x is (9+1)^x. Maybe I can expand that using the binomial theorem, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, I can think about writing 10^x as 9^x * (10/9)^x. Let me try that.\n\nSo, 10^x = (9/9)^x * 10^x = 9^x * (10/9)^x. Wait, that seems a bit circular. Maybe it's better to consider the ratio 10^x / 9^x. Let me denote y = 10^x. Then 9^x = (9/10)^x * 10^x, which would be (9/10)^x * y. \n\nAlternatively, let me set t = 10^x, so 9^x would be (9/10)^x * t. Hmm, maybe that could work. Let's try substituting.\n\nIf I let t = 10^x, then 9^x = (9/10)^x * t. So substituting back into the equation:\n\n19 = t - (9/10)^x * t.\n\nHmm,"

Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take logarithms? But since there are two exponential terms, that might not be straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trying to test integer values of x to see if they satisfy the equation. Let me try x=1: 9^1 +19 = 9 +19 =28, and 10^1=10. 28≠10. Not equal.\n\nx=2: 9^2 +19 =81+19=100, and 10^2=100. Oh! Wait, that works. 100=100. So x=2 is a solution. \n\nHmm, so maybe x=2 is a solution. Let me check x=3: 9^3 +19=729+19=748, and 10^3=1000. Not equal. \n\nWhat about x=0? 9^0 +19=1+19=20, and 10^0=1. Not equal. \n\nx=1.5? Let me see. 9^1.5 is sqrt(9^3)=sqrt(729)=27, so 27 +19=46. 10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)=~31.62. Not equal. \n\nHmm, so x=2 works. But maybe there's another solution? Let me check between x=0 and x=2. Let's try x=1 again, which didn't work. How about x=1. Let me see, maybe x= something less than 2?\n\nWait, let's see the behavior of the functions. Let me consider the function f(x) = 10^x - 9^x -19. We want to find x where f(x)=0.\n\nAt x=2, f(2)=100 -81 -1"

Yes, so x=2 is a root.\n\nAt x=1.5, f(1.5)=31.62 -27 -19≈-14.38. So f(1.5) is negative. \n\nAt x=0, f(0)=1 -1 -19=-19. So f(0)=-19.\n\nAt x=2, f(2)=0.\n\nWhat about x=3: f(3)=1000 -729 -19=252, which is positive.\n\nSo, f(x) crosses zero at x=2. Let me see if it's the only solution.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps between x=2 and x=3, f(x) stays positive because 10^x grows faster than 9^x.\n\nBut what about for x>2? Let me check x=4: 10^4=10000, 9^4=6561, so f(4)=10000 -6561 -19=3420. Also positive.\n\nWait, but could there be another solution for x>2? Let me see, since 10^x grows faster than 9^x, f(x)=10^x -9^x -19 will keep increasing for x>2, so f(x) stays positive. So no, only x=2 is the solution. \n\nWait, but wait, what about for x between 0 and 2? Let's see, for x=1: f(1)=10 -9 -19=-18. Negative. For x=1.5: f(1.5)=~31.62 -27 -19≈-14.38. Hmm, it's still negative. Wait, but at x=2, it becomes zero. Wait, does it cross from negative to positive only once?\n\nWait, but it's possible to have two solutions if the function does something funny. Let me check more carefully. Maybe plotting f(x)=10^x -9^x -19.\n\nWhen x approaches negative infinity:"

Let me check the derivative to see if it's always increasing.\n\nThe derivative f’(x)=10^x ln(10) -9^x ln(9). Since 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so for x sufficiently large, the derivative is positive. But for smaller x?\n\nAt x=0, f’(0)=ln(10) - ln(9) ≈ 2.3026 - 2.1972 ≈ 0.1054, which is positive. So the function is increasing at x=0. Wait, but if the function is increasing everywhere, then it can only cross zero once. Since at x=2 it's zero, and before that it was negative, and after that positive, so only one solution at x=2.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the derivative. Let me compute f’(x)=10^x ln10 -9^x ln9. Since 10^x grows faster than 9^x, so for all x, 10^x ln10 will eventually dominate. But even at x=1, f’(1)=10 ln10 -9 ln9 ≈10*2.3026 -9*2.1972≈23.026 -19.775≈3.251, which is positive. So the derivative is always positive. Therefore, the function is strictly increasing. Therefore, there is only one solution at x=2.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2. \n\nWait, but let me check x=2 again. Plugging back into original equation: 3^{2*2} +19 = 3^4 +19 =81 +19=100."
