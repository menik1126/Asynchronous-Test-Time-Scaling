            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where a matrix M transforms one vector to another and another vector to yet another. I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this matrix M. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a matrix transforms a vector, it's like applying the matrix to the vector's coordinates. So if I can figure out what M is, I can then apply it to the line y = 2x + 1. But wait, do I need to find the matrix M first? Because if I know M, I can just apply it to any point on the line, right?\n\nThe problem gives me two vectors and their images. So, vector v1 = [2, -1] is taken to v1' = [9, 3], and vector v2 = [1, -3] is taken to v2' = [7, -1]. So, with these, I can set up equations to solve for the matrix M.\n\nSince M is a 2x2 matrix, let's denote it as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n        [c  d]\n\nWhen M is multiplied by a vector [x, y], it gives [a*x + b*y, c*x + d*y]. So, applying this to v1 and v2, I can create two systems of equations.\n\nFor v1: [9, 3] = M*[2, -1] = [2a - b, 2c - d]\n\nSo, we have:\n2a - b = 9 ...(1)\n2c - d = 3 ...(2)\n\nFor v2: [7, -1] = M*[1, -3] = [a - 3b, c - 3d]\n\nSo, we have:\na - 3b = 7 ...(3)\nc - 3d = -1 ...(4)\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. 2c - d = 3\n3. a - 3b = 7\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nI need to solve this system to find a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me start with equations 1 and 3 to find a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a -"

            "output": " b = 9 => I can express b as b = 2a - 9.\n\nSubstitute into equation 3: a - 3*(2a - 9) = 7\n\nLet me compute that:\n\na - 6a + 27 = 7\n-5a + 27 = 7\n-5a = 7 - 27\n-5a = -20\na = (-20)/(-5) = 4\n\nThen, b = 2a - 9 = 2*4 -9 = 8 - 9 = -1.\n\nOkay, so a = 4, b = -1.\n\nNow, moving on to equations 2 and 4 to find c and d.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2c - d = 3 => d = 2c - 3.\n\nSubstitute into equation 4: c - 3*(2c -3) = -1\n\nCompute that:\n\nc -6c +9 = -1\n-5c + 9 = -1\n-5c = -1 -9\n-5c = -10\nc = (-10)/(-5) = 2\n\nThen, d = 2c - 3 = 2*2 -3 = 4 -3 = 1.\n\nSo now, the matrix M is:\n\nM = [4  -1]\n        [2   1]\n\nLet me double-check the multiplications to make sure.\n\nFor v1: [4, -1] * [2; -1] = 4*2 + (-1)*(-1) = 8 + 1 =9; 2*2 +1*(-1) =4 -1=3. That's correct.\n\nFor v2: [4, -1] * [1; -3] =4*1 + (-1)*(-3)=4 +3=7; 2*1 +1*(-3)=2 -3=-1. Also correct. Okay, so M is correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the image of the line y=2x +1 under M. Hmm. So, the image of a line under a linear transformation is another line. So, I need to find what happens when M is applied to any point (x, y) on y=2x +1.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of parametrizing"

Let's denote the point as (t, 2t +1), where t is a parameter.\n\nSo, applying M to this point:\n\nM*(t, 2t +1) = [4*t + (-1)*(2t +1), 2*t +1*(2t +1)]\n\nLet me compute each component:\n\nFirst component: 4t - (2t +1) =4t -2t -1 = 2t -1.\n\nSecond component: 2t + (2t +1) =2t +2t +1=4t +1.\n\nSo, the transformed point is (2t -1, 4t +1). Let me denote the new coordinates as (X, Y).\n\nSo,\n\nX =2t -1\n\nY=4t +1\n\nNow, I can solve for t in terms of X and substitute into Y to find Y as a function of X.\n\nFrom X=2t -1,\n\nAdd 1 to both sides: X +1 =2t => t=(X +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into Y:\n\nY=4*( (X +1)/2 ) +1 =2*(X +1) +1=2X +2 +1=2X +3.\n\nSo, Y=2X +3.\n\nTherefore, the image of the line y=2x +1 under M is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify if I did everything correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the image of a line under a linear transformation is another line, obtained by plugging the transformation into the original equation.\n\nSo, let me express the transformation as:\n\nIf (x, y) is on the original line, then (X, Y) = M*(x, y) = (4x - y, 2x + y). So, X=4x - y, Y=2x + y.\n\nBut since (x, y) lies on y =2x +1, so y=2x +1.\n\nSo substitute y=2x +1 into X and Y.\n\nCompute X:\n\nX=4x - (2x +1)=4x -2x -1=2x -1.\n\nCompute Y:\n\nY=2"
