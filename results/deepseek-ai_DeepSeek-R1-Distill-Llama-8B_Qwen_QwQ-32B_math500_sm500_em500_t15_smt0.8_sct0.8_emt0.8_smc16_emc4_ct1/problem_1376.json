            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where a matrix M transforms one vector to another and another vector to another. I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this transformation. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a matrix transforms a vector, it essentially applies a linear transformation. So, if I can express the line y = 2x + 1 in terms of vectors, I might be able to apply the matrix M to each point on the line and find its image.\n\nBut wait, the line y = 2x + 1 is a set of points, right? So, to find the image of the entire line, I need to see what happens to every point on that line when M is applied. That sounds a bit complicated because there are infinitely many points on a line. Maybe there's a smarter way to handle this without checking each point individually.\n\nI think about how linear transformations affect lines. If a line is transformed by a linear transformation, the image is either another line, a single point (if the transformation is not invertible), or it might not be a line at all if it's affine. But since M is a matrix, which is linear, the transformation should map lines to lines or single points if they lie on the kernel of M.\n\nWait, not necessarily. Since M is applied to vectors, if the original line isn't parallel to the kernel of M, the image should be a line. If it is parallel, then it might collapse to a single point or another line. I need to figure out how M affects the direction vector of the line.\n\nThe given line is y = 2x + 1. Its slope is 2, so the direction vector can be written as (1, 2). That's because for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units. So, the direction vector is (1, 2). Now, to find the image of this line under M, I can apply M to this direction vector and see what the new direction is, and also find where the point (0,1) on the line is mapped because that will give me the y-intercept.\n\nSo, let's test this idea.\n\nFirst, find where M sends the direction vector (1, 2). But wait, I don't have M directly. I only have how it transforms two specific"

Maybe I can find the matrix M by using these two vectors as the columns of M, but that's only if those vectors are the standard basis vectors. Since they aren't the standard basis, I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of M as a linear transformation and set up equations to find its entries. Let me denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n      [c  d]\n\nThen, applying M to the vector (2, -1) gives:\n\nM*(2, -1)^T = (2a - b, 2c - d)^T = (9, 3)^T.\n\nSimilarly, applying M to (1, -3) gives:\n\nM*(1, -3)^T = (a -3b, c -3d)^T = (7, -1)^T.\n\nTherefore, I can set up the following system of equations:\n\nFrom the first vector transformation:\n2a - b = 9       (1)\n2c - d = 3       (2)\n\nFrom the second vector transformation:\na - 3b = 7       (3)\nc - 3d = -1      (4)\n\nNow I have two separate systems for the a,b and c,d components. Let me solve for a and b first from equations (1) and (3):\n\nEquation (1): 2a - b = 9  \nEquation (3): a - 3b = 7\n\nLet me write equation (1) as: b = 2a - 9. Substitute this into equation (3):\n\na - 3*(2a - 9) = 7  \na -6a +27 = 7  \n-5a +27 =7  \n-5a = -20  \na = 4  \n\nThen plug back a =4 into equation (1): 2*(4) -b =9  \n8 - b=9  \n-b=1  \nb = -1\n\nAlright, so a is 4, b is -1.\n\nNow do the same for equations (2) and (4):\n\nEquation (2): 2c - d = 3  \nEquation (4): c - 3d = -1\n\nLet me solve equation"

Applying M:\n\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1) =8 +1=9  \n2*2 +1*(-1)=4 -1=3  \nYes, that matches (9,3). Good.\n\nSecond vector: (1, -3). Applying M:\n\n4*1 + (-1)*(-3)=4 +3=7  \n2*1 +1*(-3)=2 -3=-1  \nThat matches (7,-1). Perfect.\n\nSo, M is correctly found. Now, back to the original problem.\n\nI need to find the image of the line y=2x+1 under M. As I thought before, I can find where M sends a direction vector of the line and the image of a specific point on the line, then determine the equation of the image line.\n\nThe direction vector of the original line is (1,2), as determined earlier. Let's apply M to this direction vector.\n\nSo, M*(1,2)^T.\n\nCompute:\n\n4*1 + (-1)*2 =4 -2=2  \n2*1 +1*2=2 +2=4  \n\nSo, the image of (1,2) is (2,4). This gives the direction vector of the image line.\n\nNow, to find the image of the point on the original line. Let's pick a point on the line y=2x+1. A simple choice is when x=0: (0,1). Let's apply M to (0,1):\n\n4*0 + (-1)*1 =0 -1=-1  \n2*0 +1*1=0 +1="

So, the image line has slope 2. Now, we can use the point (-1,1) to find the equation.\n\nUsing point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nSo, y -1 =2*(x - (-1))  \ny -1= 2*(x +1)  \ny -1=2x +2  \ny=2x +3\n\nSo, image of the line y=2x+1 under M is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, let me double-check this. If I take another point on the original line, say (1,3), and apply M:\n\nM*(1,3)^T.\n\nCompute:\n\n4*1 + (-1)*3=4 -3=1  \n2*1 +1*3=2 +3=5  \n\nSo, image point is (1,5). Now, does (1,5) lie on the image line y=2x+3? Let's see: 2*1 +3=5. Yes, it works.\n\nAnother point: (2,5). Applying M:\n\n4*2 + (-1)*5=8 -5=3  \n2*2 +1*5=4 +5=9  \n\nImage point is (3,9). Check if it lies on y=2x+3: 2*3 +3=9. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, both points check out.

The direction vector (1, 2) transforms to (2, 4), giving a slope of 2 for the image line. Applying the transformation to a point on the original line, such as (0,1), gives the image point (-1,1).
