In base ten, each digit represents a power of ten, and in base six, each digit represents a power of six.\n\nSince 999 is a three-digit number in base ten, it can be expressed as 9 times 100 plus 9 times 10 plus 9. To convert this to base six, I need to find the appropriate powers of six that, when summed, equal 999.\n\nI will start by determining the highest power of six that is less than 999. Calculating the powers of six:\n6^0 = 1\n6^1 = 6\n6^2 = 36\n6^3 = 216\n6^4 = 1296\n\nSince 6^4 is 1296, which is larger than 999, the highest power I can use is 6^3, which is 216.\n\nNext, I will divide the number 999 by 216 to see how many times 216 fits into 999. Dividing 999 by 216 gives approximately 4.63, so I take the integer part, which is 4.\n\nNow, I'll subtract 4 times 216 from 999 to find the remainder. Calculating 4 times 216 gives 864. Subtracting this from 999 leaves 135.\n\nI'll then divide the new remainder, 135, by the next lower power of six, which is 36 (6^2). Dividing 135 by 36 gives approximately 3.75, so I take the integer part, which is 3.\n\nSubtracting 3 times 36 from 135 gives me 27.\n\nFinally, I'll divide 27 by the next power of six, which is 6 (6^1). Dividing 27 by 6 gives exactly 4 with no remainder.\n\nTo complete the conversion, I'll add 1 to the coefficient of 6^0 to make it a valid base six number.\n\nCombining all these coefficients, the base six equivalent of 999 in base ten is 4433.\n</think>\n\nTo convert \\( 999_{10} \\) to its base six equivalent, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 999 in powers of 10:**\n   \\[\n   999 = 9"
