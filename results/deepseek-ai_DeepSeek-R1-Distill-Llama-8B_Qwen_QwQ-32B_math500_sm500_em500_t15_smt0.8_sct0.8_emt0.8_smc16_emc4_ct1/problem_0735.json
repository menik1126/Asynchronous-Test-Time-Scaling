First, I need to remember some logarithm properties because these equations involve logs. \n\nStarting with the first equation: log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2. I remember that when you add two logs with the same base, it's equivalent to the log of the product of the arguments. So, I can combine these two logs into a single logarithm. \n\nSo, log\u2086[(x - y)(x + y)] = 2. \n\nLet me compute (x - y)(x + y). That's a difference of squares, so it simplifies to x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. So now, the equation becomes log\u2086(x\u00b2 - y\u00b2) = 2.\n\nTo get rid of the logarithm, I can rewrite this in exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, in this case, base 6 raised to the power of 2 equals x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. \n\nSo, 6\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2, which is 36 = x\u00b2 - y\u00b2. That gives me my first equation: x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36. I'll keep that aside for now.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: log base y of 5x equals 2. So, log_y(5x) = 2. \n\nAgain, converting the logarithmic equation to exponential form: y\u00b2 = 5x. Because log_y(a) = b means y^b = a. So here, y\u00b2 = 5x. \n\nSo now, I have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36\n2. y\u00b2 = 5x\n\nSince the second equation gives me y\u00b2 in terms of x, I can substitute y\u00b2 into the first equation. Let me do that.\n\nSubstituting y\u00b2 = 5x into the first equation: x\u00b2 - 5x = 36. \n\nSo now, I have a quadratic equation in terms of x: x\u00b2 - 5x - "

            "output": "36 = 0.\n\nI need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me try factoring it. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -36 and add up to -5. Hmm, let's see. The factors of 36 are 1 and 36, 2 and 18, 3 and 12, 4 and 9, 6 and 6. \n\nLooking for a pair that adds up to -5. Let me think: -9 and 4. Because -9 * 4 = -36 and -9 + 4 = -5. Perfect, so I can factor the quadratic as (x - 9)(x + 4) = 0.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives possible solutions:\n\nx - 9 = 0 \u21d2 x = 9\nx + 4 = 0 \u21d2 x = -4\n\nNow, I have two potential solutions for x: 9 and -4. But wait, I need to check if these solutions are valid because logarithms have domains that require their arguments to be positive.\n\nLooking back at the original equations:\n\n1. log\u2086(x - y) + log\u2086(x + y) = 2\n2. log_y(5x) = 2\n\nFor the first equation, the arguments of the logarithms must be positive. So, x - y > 0 and x + y > 0. \n\nFor the second equation, two conditions must hold: the base y must be positive and not equal to 1 (since logarithm base must satisfy y > 0 and y \u2260 1), and the argument 5x must be positive (so 5x > 0 \u21d2 x > 0).\n\nSo, let's check each possible solution.\n\nFirst, x = 9:\n\nFrom the second equation, y\u00b2 = 5x. If x = 9, then y\u00b2 = 5*9 = 45. So y = sqrt(45) or y = -sqrt(45). But the base y of a logarithm must be positive, so y = sqrt(45) \u2248 6.708. Now, we have to check if the arguments in the first equation are positive.\n\nx - y = 9 - sqrt(45). Let me compute sqrt(45): it's about 6.708. So 9 - 6.708 \u2248 2.292, which is"

Wait, y squared equals a negative number? That's impossible because the square of a real number can't be negative. So, y\u00b2 = -20 is not possible in real numbers. Therefore, x = -4 is not a valid solution.\n\nThus, the only valid solution is x = 9.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Combined the logs in the first equation to get x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 36.\n2. Converted the second equation to y\u00b2 = 5x.\n3. Substituted y\u00b2 into the first equation to get a quadratic in x: x\u00b2 - 5x - 36 = 0.\n4. Factored and found x = 9 and x = -4.\n5. Checked validity by ensuring y is positive and that arguments of logs are positive.\n6. Found x = 9 valid and x = -4 invalid.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x = 9.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given logarithmic equations and use logarithm properties to simplify them.\n\n1.
