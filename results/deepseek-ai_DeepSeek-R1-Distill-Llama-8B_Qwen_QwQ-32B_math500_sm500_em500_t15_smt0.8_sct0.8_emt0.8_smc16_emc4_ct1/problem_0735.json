It says:\n\nIf \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\) and \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\), then find \\(x\\).\n\nHmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember some logarithm properties. The sum of two logs with the same base can be combined into the log of the product. So, for the first equation, \\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y)\\) should be equal to \\(\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)]\\). That simplifies the equation a bit.\n\nSo, the first equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n\\]\n\nI can rewrite this in exponential form to get rid of the logarithm. Remember that \\(\\log_b a = c\\) implies \\(b^c = a\\). So, applying that here, we have:\n\\[\n6^2 = (x - y)(x + y)\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n36 = (x - y)(x + y)\n\\]\nWait, that looks like a difference of squares. So, \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\). Got that.\n\nNow, moving on to the second equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\). Again, I can convert this logarithmic equation to its exponential form. That gives:\n\\[\ny^2 = 5x\n\\]\nSo, \\(y^2 = 5x\\) or \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{5}\\). That's helpful because now I can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\), and then substitute back into the first equation.\n\nLet me write that substitution down. Since \\(x = \\frac{y^2}{5}\\), I can plug this into \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\).\n\nSo, substituting, we get:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{y^2}{5}\\right)^2 - y^2 = 36\n\\]\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, square \\(\\frac{y^2}{5}\\):\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{y^2}{5}\\"

Let's try that.\n\nLet \\(u = y^2\\), then the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{u^2}{25} - u = 36\n\\]\nTo eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 25:\n\\[\nu^2 - 25u = 900\n\\]\nBring all terms to one side:\n\\[\nu^2 - 25u - 900 = 0\n\\]\nNow, this is a quadratic in \\(u\\). Let me solve for \\(u\\) using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is \\(u^2 -25u -900=0\\).\n\nThe quadratic formula is \\(u = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a=1\\), \\(b=-25\\), \\(c=-900\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\\[\nu = \\frac{-(-25) \\pm \\sqrt{(-25)^2 - 4*1*(-900)}}{2*1}\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nu = \\frac{25 \\pm \\sqrt{625 + 3600}}{2}\n\\]\nCompute the square root:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{625 + 3600} = \\sqrt{4225} = 65\n\\]\nSo, we have:\n\\[\nu = \\frac{25 \\pm 65}{2}\n\\]\nNow, two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\(u = \\frac{25 + 65}{2} = \\frac{90}{2} = 45\\)\n2. \\(u = \\frac{25 - 65}{2} = \\frac{-40}{2} = -20\\)\n\nBut \\(u = y^2\\), and since a square cannot be negative, \\(u\\) must be 45. So, \\(y^2 = 45\\), which implies \\(y = \\sqrt{45}\\) or \\(y = -\\sqrt{45}\\).\n\nSimplify \\(\\sqrt{45}\\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{45} = \\sqrt"

It's important to verify each step.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\(\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\\)\n\nWe combined the logs: \\(\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\\)\n\nWhich becomes \\(6^2 = (x - y)(x + y)\\) → \\(36 = x^2 - y^2\\). That seems correct.\n\nSecond equation: \\(\\log_y 5x = 2\\) → \\(y^2 = 5x\\) → \\(x = y^2/5\\). That's right.\n\nSubstituting into \\(x^2 - y^2 = 36\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{y^2}{5}\\right)^2 - y^2 = 36\n\\]\nWhich is \\(\\frac{y^4}{25} - y^2 = 36\\). Multiplying by 25: \\(y^4 -25y^2 -900 =0\\). Letting \\(u = y^2\\), we get \\(u^2 -25u -900 =0\\).\n\nQuadratic formula: \\(u = [25 ± sqrt(625 + 3600)]/2 = [25 ±65]/2\\). So, 90/2=45 and -40/"

Seems correct.\n\nI can also plug \\(x=9\\) back into the original equations to check.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nCompute \\(\\log_6 (9 - y) + \\log_6 (9 + y) = 2\\). Let's see what \\(y\\) is.\n\nFrom above, \\(y = ±3√5\\), so let me compute \\(9 - y\\) and \\(9 + y\\).\n\nFirst, compute \\(y = 3√5 ≈ 3*2.236 ≈6.708\\), so 9 - y ≈2.292 and 9 + y≈15.708.\n\nCompute the sum: \\(\\log_6 (2.292) + \\log_6 (15.708)\\).\n\nHmm, let's compute each log:\n\n\\(\\log_6 (2.292)\\): Since 6^0.5≈2.45, which is a bit higher than 2.292, so this log is less than 0.5. Let's approximate it as around 0.44.\n\n\\(\\log_6 (15.708)\\): 6^2=36, which is higher than 15.708. So, it's between 1 and 2. Let me compute 6^1.5 = sqrt(6^3)=sqrt(216)=~14.7, which is just under 15.708. So, 6^1.5 ≈14.7, so log6(15.708) ≈1.5 + a little bit because 14.7 is 6^1.5. Let's say about 1.52.\n\nAdding the two logs: 0.44 +1.52 ≈1.96, which is approximately 2. Close enough, considering the approximations.\n\nNow, the other case, \\(y = -3√5 ≈-6.708\\). So, 9 - (-6.708)≈15.708 and 9 + (-6.708)=2.292. So, same as before, just swapping the two terms, so the"

So, \\(\\log_{3√5} 45 =2\\). Let's see if that's true.\n\nConvert to exponential form: (3√5)^2 =45?\n\nCompute (3√5)^2 =9*5=45. Yes! Perfect. So that works.\n\nSimilarly, if y is negative, like y=-3√5, then the base of the logarithm would be negative, which is not allowed because logarithm bases must be positive and not equal to 1. Wait, hold on! That's a problem.\n\nWait, in the second equation, \\(\\log_y 5x =2\\), the base y must be positive and not equal to 1. So, if y is negative, that's invalid. Therefore, y cannot be negative. So, we have to discard the negative solution for y.\n\nTherefore, only y=3√5 is valid, so x=9 is the only solution.\n\nAh, right! I almost forgot that logarithm bases must be positive. So, y must be positive. Therefore, y=-3√5 is invalid because the base of a logarithm can't be negative. So, only y=3√5 is acceptable, leading to x=9. That's important.\n\nTherefore, the answer is x=9.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything else.\n\nFirst equation led to x² - y²=36, second equation led to y²=5x. Substituted, solved for y²=45, so y=3√5 (discarding negative), then x=9. Checked both equations, and also considered the validity of the logarithm bases. All seems good.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{9}\n</think>\n\nFirst, we use the property of logarithms to combine the logs in the first equation:\n\\[\n\\log_6 (x - y) + \\log_6 (x + y) = 2\n\\]\nThis becomes:\n\\[\n\\log_6 [(x - y)(x + y)] = 2\n"
