The subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nAlso, we're given that a₁₃ = 2016, and we need to find a₁.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, let me recall what geometric and arithmetic sequences are.\n\nAn arithmetic sequence has a common difference between consecutive terms. So, if a, b, c are in arithmetic sequence, then b - a = c - b, which simplifies to 2b = a + c.\n\nA geometric sequence has a common ratio. So, if a, b, c are in geometric sequence, then b/a = c/b, which simplifies to b² = a*c.\n\nGiven that, let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nWe know that for every k, starting from k=1, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric. So, for each k, that trio is a geometric progression.\n\nSimilarly, the same a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is an arithmetic progression.\n\nSo, for each k, we have these two properties.\n\nGiven that, maybe we can express a_{2k+1} in terms of a_{2k-1} and a_{2k} since it's a geometric sequence.\n\nIn a geometric progression, each term is multiplied by a common ratio r. So, a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} * r, and a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} * r = a_{2k-1} * r².\n\nSimilarly, the arithmetic progression a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} has a common difference d. So, a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d, and a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} +"

Also, a_{2k} is equal to a_{2k-1} * r. \n\nSo, maybe we can express a_{2k+2} in terms of a_{2k} and d, which is a_{2k+1} + d. But a_{2k+1} is equal to a_{2k-1} * r², so a_{2k+2} = a_{2k-1} * r² + d.\n\nWait, but also, a_{2k+1} is equal to a_{2k} + d, which is a_{2k-1} * r + d. Therefore, we can set these equal:\n\na_{2k} + d = a_{2k-1} * r²\n\nBut a_{2k} is a_{2k-1} * r, so substituting:\n\na_{2k-1} * r + d = a_{2k-1} * r²\n\nSo, rearranging, we get:\n\na_{2k-1} * (r² - r) = d\n\nSo, d is equal to a_{2k-1} * (r² - r) for each k.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, for each k, the common difference d is equal to a_{2k-1} multiplied by r squared minus r.\n\nBut wait, since this holds for every k, this suggests that d is proportional to a_{2k-1}, scaled by (r² - r). That's an important relation.\n\nNow, let's see if we can express a_{2k+2} in terms of previous terms.\n\nFrom the arithmetic progression, a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d = a_{2k} + 2d.\n\nBut from the geometric progression, a_{2k+2} can also be expressed in terms of a_{2k+1} and a_{2k}.\n\nWait, but actually, since the geometric progression is a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, then the next geometric triplet"

So, this suggests that the only solution is r=1, which we can't have. Therefore, perhaps my approach is wrong, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem arises because I assumed that the same ratio r applies for every k. Maybe the ratio changes with each k? But the problem doesn't specify that; it just says for every k, the geometric and arithmetic conditions hold. So, perhaps the ratio r is constant for the entire sequence?\n\nBut in that case, the problem arises as I saw before, because for k=1, d1 = a₁ r (r - 1), and for k=2, d2 = a₃ r (r - 1) = a₁ r² (r - 1). Since the sequence is strictly increasing, the common differences can't be negative, so r>1.\n\nBut when I tried to set d1 = d2, that forced r=1, which is invalid. So, perhaps the differences are not the same for each k, even though each triplet's arithmetic progression has the same difference as a function of k. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no.

So, my mistake was assuming that the difference d is the same for all k. That's not the case. The problem doesn't say the differences are the same, just that each triplet is arithmetic. So, each arithmetic triplet can have its own difference.\n\nAh! That's a crucial mistake I made earlier. So, the difference d is not a constant, but depends on k. So, for each k, the arithmetic triplet a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} has its own common difference, which I can denote as d_k.

It doesn't specify that the ratio is the same for all k. So, each geometric triplet can have its own ratio.
