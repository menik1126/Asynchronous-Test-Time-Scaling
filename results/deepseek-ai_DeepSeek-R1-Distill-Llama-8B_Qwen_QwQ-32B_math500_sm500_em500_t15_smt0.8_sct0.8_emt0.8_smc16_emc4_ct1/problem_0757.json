            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. The sequence is defined in a specific way: for every positive integer k, the subsequence a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} is geometric, and the subsequence a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} is arithmetic. They also told me that a_{13} is 2016, and I need to find a_1. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, just to make sure I understand, a geometric sequence is one where each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So if I have three terms, a, b, c in a geometric sequence, then b/a = c/b, which simplifies to b squared equals a times c, or b\u00b2 = ac. On the other hand, an arithmetic sequence has a common difference between consecutive terms. So if I have three terms a, b, c in an arithmetic sequence, then b - a = c - b, which simplifies to 2b = a + c.\n\nSo, applying that to the problem, for each k, the terms a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} form a geometric sequence, and the terms a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nLet me try to write down the relationships for the first few k values, maybe starting with k=1. That should give me the relationships between the first few terms of the sequence.\n\nStarting with k=1:\n- The geometric sequence is a1, a2, a3. So according to the geometric property, a2\u00b2 = a1 * a3.\n- The arithmetic sequence is a2, a3, a4. So 2a3 = a2 + a4, which implies a4 = 2a3 - a2.\n\nMoving on to k=2:\n- The geometric sequence is a3, a4, a5. So a4\u00b2 = a3 * a5.\n- The arithmetic sequence is a4, a5, a6. So 2a5 = a4 + a6, hence a6 = 2a5 - a4.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3:\n- The geometric sequence"

Each time, for the geometric part, the middle term squared equals the product of its neighbors. For the arithmetic part, the middle term is the average of its neighbors, so the next term is twice the middle term minus the previous term.\n\nLet me try to tabulate the terms with variables to see if I can find a recursive relationship or perhaps a pattern.\n\nLet's denote the terms as a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13.\n\nFrom k=1:\n- a2\u00b2 = a1 * a3  [Geometric]\n- a4 = 2a3 - a2   [Arithmetic]\n\nFrom k=2:\n- a4\u00b2 = a3 * a5   [Geometric]\n- a6 = 2a5 - a4   [Arithmetic]\n\nFrom k=3:\n- a6\u00b2 = a5 * a7   [Geometric]\n- a8 = 2a7 - a6   [Arithmetic]\n\nFrom k=4:\n- a8\u00b2 = a7 * a9   [Geometric]\n- a10 = 2a9 - a8   [Arithmetic]\n\nFrom k=5:\n- a10\u00b2 = a9 * a11  [Geometric]\n- a12 = 2a11 - a10 [Arithmetic]\n\nFrom k=6:\n- a12\u00b2 = a11 * a13 [Geometric]\n- a14 = 2a13 - a12 [Arithmetic]\n\nBut we know that a13 is 2016.
