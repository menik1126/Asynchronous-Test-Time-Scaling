            "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to combine these square roots and their reciprocals into a single fraction. The expression is √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify each part separately and then combine them.\n\nLet me start with √2 + 1/√2. I remember that to combine these, I can get a common denominator. So, √2 is the same as √2/1, right? So to add √2 and 1/√2, I can write √2 as (√2 * √2)/√2, which is 2/√2. So now, √2 + 1/√2 becomes 2/√2 + 1/√2, which is 3/√2. But wait, 3/√2 isn't simplified because we usually don't like having square roots in the denominator. To rationalize it, I can multiply numerator and denominator by √2. So, 3/√2 * √2/√2 = 3√2 / 2. Okay, so that part simplifies to (3√2)/2.\n\nNow, let's do the same for √3 + 1/√3. I'll try to combine these as well. √3 is √3/1, and 1/√3 is 1/√3. To add them, I can again find a common denominator. So, √3 can be written as (√3 * √3)/√3, which is 3/√3. So, √3 + 1/√3 becomes 3/√3 + 1/√3, which is 4/√3. Again, I don't like having a square root in the denominator, so I'll rationalize it. Multiplying numerator and denominator by √3 gives 4√3 / 3. So, that part simplifies to (4√3)/3.\n\nNow, the entire original expression simplifies to (3√2)/2 + (4√3)/3. So, now I have two fractions with different denominators. To add these together, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 3, so the least common multiple is 6. That means I can rewrite each fraction with denominator 6.\n\nFor (3"

            "output": "√2)/2, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by 3: (3√2 * 3)/(2 * 3) = 9√2 / 6. For (4√3)/3, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by 2: (4√3 * 2)/(3 * 2) = 8√3 / 6. Now, both fractions have the same denominator, so I can add them together: 9√2/6 + 8√3/6 = (9√2 + 8√3)/6.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to (9√2 + 8√3)/6. Let me check if the denominators can be simplified further or if there's a common factor in the numerator. The numerator has coefficients 9 and 8, and the denominator is 6. I don't think 9 and 8 have any common factors with 6 beyond what's already there, so I think this is the simplest form.\n\nTherefore, a = 9, b = 8, and c = 6. Adding them together: 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let's double-check my steps. I combined √2 +1/√2 to 3√2/2 and √3 +1/√3 to 4√3/3. Then I found a common denominator for these fractions, which is 6, and converted each fraction accordingly. Adding them together gives (9√2 +8√3)/6. Yes, that seems right. So a=9, b=8, c=6, so a+b+c=23.\n\nI don't see any mistakes here, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression √2 + 1/√2 + √3 + 1/√3 can be simplified step-by-step as follows:\n\n1. Combine √2 + 1/√2:\n   - Rewrite √2 as 2/√2.\n   - Add: 2/√2 + 1/√2 = 3/√2.\n   - Rationalize: (3√2)/2.\n\n2. Combine √3 + 1/√3:\n   - Rewrite √3 as 3/√3.\n   - Add: 3/√3 + 1/√3"
