Since the members must be seated around a circular table, arrangements that are rotations of each other are considered equivalent. Additionally, all members of each party must sit together, meaning the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent will form three distinct blocks.\n\nNext, I'll treat each party as a single entity or \"block.\" This reduces the problem to arranging three blocks around a circular table. Because the arrangement is circular, the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) distinct objects is \\( (n-1)! \\). Here, \\( n = 3 \\), so the Democrats, Republicans, and Independent can be arranged in \\( 2! \\) ways.\n\nNow, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5 members, so they can be arranged in \\( 5! \\) ways. Similarly, the Republicans can be arranged in \\( 5! \\) ways, and the Independent has only one member, so there's just 1 way to arrange them.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of distinct seating arrangements, I'll multiply the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the number of ways to arrange the members within each block: \\( 2! \\times 5! \\times 5! \\times 1! \\).\n\nThis calculation gives the final answer of \\( 2 \\times 120 \\times 120 = 28,800 \\) different seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table with the given conditions, let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Constraints**\n- **Circular Arrangement:** Arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same.\n- **Party Blocks:** All Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent must sit together as a single block each.\n\n**Step 2: Treat Each Party as a Block**\nSince the members of each party must sit together, we can consider the three parties as three separate \"blocks\":\n1. **Democrats Block**\n2. **Republicans Block**\n3. **Independent Block**\n\n**Step 3: Arrange the Blocks Around the Table**\nWhen arranging \\( n \\) blocks around a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is \\( (n-1)! \\).
