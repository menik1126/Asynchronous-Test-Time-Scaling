            "output": "To solve the problem of finding the number of ways the Senate committee can sit around a circular table with the given conditions, I'll start by analyzing the constraints.\n\nFirst, there are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, making a total of 11 members. Since the seating is around a circular table, the number of distinct seating arrangements is affected by rotations being considered equivalent. This means that fixing one person's position can simplify the calculations.\n\nNext, the condition states that all members of each party must sit next to each other. This implies that the Democratic group, Republican group, and the Independent will each form a single \"block\" or segment around the table.\n\nConsidering the circular nature, fixing the position of the Independent can help eliminate rotational symmetry. Once the Independent's position is fixed, the two political blocks (Democrats and Republicans) can be arranged relative to the Independent.\n\nThere are two main blocks to arrange: the Democrats and the Republicans. Since these are two distinct groups, there are 2 possible ways to arrange them around the table.\n\nEach party's internal members can be arranged among themselves. For the Democrats, there are 5! ways to arrange the 5 members, and similarly, there are 5! ways to arrange the Republicans.\n\nFinally, considering that the table is circular and the Independent's position has been fixed, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is calculated by multiplying the number of ways to arrange the blocks by the internal arrangements of each block.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the total number of members:**\n   - Democrats: 5\n   - Republicans: 5\n   - Independent: 1\n   - **Total members:** 5 + 5 + 1 = 11\n\n2. **Understand the circular arrangement:**\n   - Since the seating is around a **circular table**, arrangements that can be rotated into each other are considered the same.\n   - Therefore, we can fix the position of one person to eliminate rotational symmetry.\n\n3. **Apply the condition that each party sits together:**\n   - The Democrats, Republicans, and Independent will each form a single **block** or segment around the table.\n   - These blocks will be arranged relative to each other.\n\n4. **Fix the position of the Independent:**\n   - To account for the circular arrangement, fix the Independent's position. This eliminates the need to consider"
