So, \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, which gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nSure!

Specifically,\n\\[\n256 = 2^8\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Power of a Power Property**\nNext, we use the property of exponents \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\):\n\\[\n(2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n\\]\nNow, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = 2^4\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Set the Exponents Equal**\nSince the bases are the same (\\(2 = 2\\)), we can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[\n2x = 4\n\\]\n\n### **Step 4: Solve for \\( x \\)**\nTo find"
