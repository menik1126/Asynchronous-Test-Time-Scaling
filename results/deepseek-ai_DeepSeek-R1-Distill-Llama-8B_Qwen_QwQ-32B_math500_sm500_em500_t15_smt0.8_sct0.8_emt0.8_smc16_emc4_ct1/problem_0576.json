            "output": "First, I need to simplify the equation by expanding all the terms. The equation given is \\(3 \\times 5^2 - 4 \\times (5 - a)^2 \\div 3 = 63\\).\n\nStarting with \\(5^2\\), which equals 25. Multiplying this by 3 gives 75. Next, I'll look at the term \\(4 \\times (5 - a)^2\\) divided by 3. To simplify this, I'll divide 4 by 3 first, resulting in \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\).\n\nNow, the equation becomes \\(75 - \\frac{4}{3}(5 - a)^2 = 63\\). To make the equation easier to solve, I'll subtract 75 from both sides, which gives \\(-\\frac{4}{3}(5 - a)^2 = -12\\).\n\nNext, I'll multiply both sides by -1 to eliminate the negative signs, leading to \\(\\frac{4}{3}(5 - a)^2 = 12\\). To isolate \\((5 - a)^2\\), I'll multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), resulting in \\((5 - a)^2 = 9\\).\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, I find that \\(5 - a = \\pm 3\\). This gives me two possible equations: \\(5 - a = 3\\) and \\(5 - a = -3\\).\n\nSolving the first equation, \\(5 - a = 3\\), I subtract 5 from both sides to get \\(-a = -2\\), and then multiply by -1 to find \\(a = 2\\). \n\nFor the second equation, \\(5 - a = -3\\), I subtract 5 from both sides to get \\(-a = -8\\), and then multiply by -1 to find \\(a = 8\\).\n\nFinally, I'll add the two values of \\(a\\) to get the sum: \\(2 + 8 = 10\\).\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the equation step-by-step.\n\n\\[\n3 \\cdot 5^2 - \\frac{4(5 - a)^2}{3} = 63\n\\]\n\n1. **Simplify \\(5^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   5^2 = 25\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot"
