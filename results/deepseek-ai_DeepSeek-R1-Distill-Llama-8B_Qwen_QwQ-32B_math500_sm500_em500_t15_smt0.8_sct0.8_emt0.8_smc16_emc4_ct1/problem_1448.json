I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, sometimes substitution can help simplify things. \n\nWait, \\(3^{2x}\\) can be rewritten as \\((3^2)^x\\) because of the exponent rule \\(a^{bc} = (a^b)^c\\). So, \\(3^{2x}\\) is the same as \\(9^x\\). That might make the equation look a bit better. So, substituting that in, the equation becomes \\(9^x + 19 = 10^x\\).\n\nHmm, now I have \\(9^x\\) and \\(10^x\\) on both sides. Maybe I can let \\(y = 9^x\\), which would also make \\(10^x\\) related to y somehow. But wait, 10 is not a power of 9, so maybe that substitution alone won't help much. Alternatively, maybe I can express both sides in terms of a common base or something else.\n\nAnother thought: since both sides are exponential functions, perhaps I can analyze the behavior of the functions \\(f(x) = 9^x + 19\\) and \\(g(x) = 10^x\\) and see where they intersect. The solution to the equation will be the x where these two graphs cross each other.\n\nLet me consider the difference between the two functions: \\(10^x - 9^x = 19\\). Hmm, maybe I can define \\(h(x) = 10^x - 9^x\\) and find where \\(h(x)\\) equals 19. \n\nI know that \\(10^x\\) grows faster than \\(9^x\\) as x increases because 10 is larger than 9. So, as x becomes very large, \\(10^x\\) will dominate, making \\(h(x)\\) positive and growing. When x is 0, \\(10^0 - 9^0 = 1 - 1 = 0\\). So at x=0, the difference is 0.\n\nI wonder if there's a solution between x=0 and x=1. Let me try plugging in some values to get an idea.\n\nWhen x=1: \\(10^1 - 9^1 = 10 -"

            "output": " 9 = 1\\). So h(1)=1, which is less than 19. Hmm, so at x=1, the difference is still only 1. \n\nWait, but the original equation is \\(9^x +19 =10^x\\), so rearranged, it's \\(10^x -9^x =19\\). So at x=1, the left side is 1, which is way less than 19. So maybe the solution is at a higher x?\n\nWait, but when x increases further, let's try x=2: \\(10^2 -9^2 = 100 -81 =19\\). Oh! Wait a second, that's exactly 19. So at x=2, the difference is 19. So that would mean that x=2 is a solution?\n\nLet me check that again. Plugging x=2 into the original equation: \\(3^{2*2} +19 = 3^4 +19 =81 +19 =100\\). And \\(10^2 =100\\). So yes, 100=100. So x=2 is a solution. \n\nBut is there another solution? Let me think. Since \\(10^x\\) grows faster than \\(9^x\\), the difference \\(10^x -9^x\\) will eventually grow without bound as x increases. But what about for negative x?\n\nLet me check x=0 again. At x=0, the original equation becomes \\(3^0 +19 =1 +19=20\\), and \\(10^0=1\\). So 20 vs 1, so 20≠1. So that's not a solution. \n\nWhat about x= -1? Then \\(3^{-2} +19 = (1/9) +19 ≈19.111\\), and \\(10^{-1}=0.1\\). So 19.111 vs 0.1, not equal. \n\nHmm, so maybe x=2 is the only solution? Let me see if there's another point where \\(10^x -9^x =19\\). Let's check x=3: \\(10^3 -"

            "output": "9^3 =1000 -729=271\\), which is way bigger than 19. So, the function h(x)=10^x -9^x crosses 19 only once? Or is there another crossing?\n\nWait, let's consider the behavior of h(x)=10^x -9^x. When x approaches negative infinity, 10^x approaches 0, and 9^x also approaches 0, but 10^x approaches zero faster? Or wait, actually, as x approaches negative infinity, 10^x approaches 0 from the positive side, and same for 9^x. So h(x) as x approaches negative infinity is 0 - 0 = 0. At x=0, h(x)=0. \n\nWait, but for negative x, let's plug in x= -2: \\(10^{-2} -9^{-2} =0.01 -1/81≈0.01 -0.0123≈-0.0023\\). So h(-2) is negative. So h(x) goes from 0 at x=0 to negative for x negative. Hmm, so h(x) is decreasing when x is negative?\n\nWait, let me plot h(x) in my mind. For x increasing from negative infinity to infinity, h(x) starts near 0, becomes negative for negative x, then at x=0 is 0, then increases to 1 at x=1, then increases to 19 at x=2, and then keeps increasing. So the function h(x) is 0 at x=0, negative for x <0, and increases to infinity as x approaches infinity. So it's monotonic increasing? Or does it have any turning points?\n\nWait, is h(x) =10^x -9^x a monotonic function? Let me compute its derivative. The derivative of h(x) is ln(10) *10^x - ln(9)*9^x. Since ln(10) > ln(9), and both 10^x and 9^x are positive for all real x, the derivative is positive because ln(10)*10^x term dominates. So h(x) is strictly increasing. Therefore, h(x) =19 will have exactly one solution.\n\nSo, since h(x) is strictly increasing, there is only one value of x where h(x)=19,"

Let's see, 10^1.5 is sqrt(10^3)=sqrt(1000)≈31.62, and 9^1.5= sqrt(9^3)=sqrt(729)=27. So h(1.5)=31.62 -27≈4.62, which is less than 19. So between x=1.5 and x=2, the function goes from ~4.62 to 19, so it's increasing. Since it's strictly increasing, only crosses 19 once at x=2. \n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2. \n\nWait, but let me check another point between x=2 and x=3, just to see. At x=2.5, 10^2.5 is sqrt(10^5)=sqrt(100000)=~316.23, and 9^2.5= sqrt(9^5)=sqrt(59049)=~243. So h(2.5)=316.23 -243≈73.23, which is more than 19, so it's increasing past 19. \n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=2. \n\nI think that's it. So the answer is 2. Let me just make sure there's no other solution for x less than 2. Since h(x) is strictly increasing, once it passes 19 at x=2, it can't come back down. And before x=2, it was less than 19. So yes, only x=2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we start by rewriting \\(3^{2x}\\) as \\(9^x\\). This transforms the equation into:\n\n\\[\n9^x + 19 = 10^x\n\\]\n\nWe define the function \\(h(x) = 10^x - 9^x\\) and need to find"
