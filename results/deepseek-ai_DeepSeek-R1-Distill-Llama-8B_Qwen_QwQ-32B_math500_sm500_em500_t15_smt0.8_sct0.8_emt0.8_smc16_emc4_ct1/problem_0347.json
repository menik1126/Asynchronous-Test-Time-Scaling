            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the minimum possible value of the expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\) by adding parentheses in various places. The original expression evaluates to 13, but by strategically placing parentheses, I can change that result. The example given shows that adding parentheses in certain spots can decrease the value, like in \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6\\), which equals 3. My task is to figure out the smallest possible value I can get without changing the order of the terms, only by adding parentheses.\n\nFirst, I want to understand how parentheses affect the operations in the expression. Parentheses change the order of operations, allowing certain operations to be performed first. In this case, since all operations are addition and subtraction, the order in which these are grouped can significantly affect the result. Subtraction is a non-associative operation, meaning that the way we group terms can drastically change the outcome.\n\nSo, the expression is \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\). Let me list all the possible ways to place parentheses without changing the order of the terms. Since we have six terms, the number of ways to add parentheses is equivalent to the number of ways to insert grouping operations between them. Each insertion of parentheses can change the grouping, so I need to explore these possibilities systematically.\n\nLet me start by identifying possible groupings where I can produce larger negative numbers, which when subtracted later can reduce the overall value. For example, in the given example, \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6\\), the parentheses grouped 4 and 5 to make -9, which when subtracted from the earlier sum of 6 reduces the total.\n\nAnother approach could be grouping more terms together to create a larger positive or negative number. Since all the operations are additions and subtractions, the challenge is to create a larger negative number that's being subtracted, thus decreasing the total sum.\n\nLet me list all possible groupings:\n\n1. Grouping the first two terms: \\((1 + 2) + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\). But this seems to only add parentheses around 1 and 2, which doesn't change much, just making it 3, so the expression becomes \\("

Maybe grouping terms after the first few. Let's see:\n\nWhat if I group the 4 and 5? Let's see: \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 +5) +6\\). That's the example given, which gives 3. That's better.

Since the original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6, all operations are additions except for the single subtraction of 4.\n\nIf I group terms after the subtraction, I can create a larger negative.

If I group the -4+5+6, that's allowed, but that gives 7, which when added to 1+2+3=6 gives 13. But that's the same as before. However, if I group 4+5+6, that would mean changing the sign of those operations.\n\nWait, no. Because in the original expression, it's 1 +2 +3 - (4 +5 +6). So that would be 6 -15 = -9.

As before, that gives 1 + (12)=13.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another thought: can I group the 1 +2 +3 -4 as a group, then subtract the rest?\n\nWait, the rest would be +5 +6. So, (1+2+3-4) - (5+6)=2 -11= -9. Wait, but that would require changing the order of operations. The original expression is 1+2+3-4+5+6. If I group (1+2+3-4) - (5+6), that would be equivalent to 2 -11 = -9, but in the original expression, the +5 and +6 are after the -4, so they are added, not subtracted. To subtract them, I need to group them with the 4.\n\nWait, let me parse that again. If I group (1+2+3-4) - (5+6), that would require inserting parentheses around 5+6 and then subtracting that group. But in the original expression, after the -4, it's +5 +6. So, to subtract (5+6), I need to have a minus"

So, I can't subtract (5+6) unless I group it with the 4.\n\nWait, the only way to subtract those is by grouping 4 +5 +6, which would make it (4+5+6)=15, and then subtract that. So, 1+2+3 -15= -9.\n\nSo, in that case, grouping (4+5+6) and subtracting it gives -9.\n\nSo, is -9 the minimum possible?\n\nLet me verify again.\n\nYes, because any other groupings either don't subtract enough or just give higher results. For example, grouping 4+5 gives -9, but not more. Grouping 4+5+6 gives -15, which subtracts more.\n\nSo, I think -9 is the minimum possible value.\n\nI should also make sure that there isn't a way to group more terms before the 4 in a way that subtracts more.\n\nBut before the 4, all operations are additions, so grouping them won't subtract them. The only subtraction is at the 4, so to make the most impact, I need to include as many terms after the 4 in the subtraction.\n\nThus, grouping 4+5+6 is the way to go.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value is -9.\n</think>\n\nThe expression \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\) can be manipulated by adding parentheses to change the order of operations. By strategically grouping the terms after the subtraction, we can create a larger negative number, thus minimizing the overall result. The optimal grouping is \\((4 + 5 + 6)\\), which subtracts 15 from the sum of the preceding terms. This results in the minimum value of the expression being \\(-9\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{-9}\\)"
