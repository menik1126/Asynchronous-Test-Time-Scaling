Specifically, \\(256 = 2^8\\).\n\nSubstituting this into the equation gives \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\nSimplifying the right side, I raise 2 to the power of \\(8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\), which is \\(2^4\\).\n\nSo now the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Express 256 as a Power of 2\nWe know that:\n\\[\n256 = 2^8\n\\]\nSo, substitute this into the equation:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = \\left(2^8\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Right Side\nApply the exponent rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}\\):\n\\[\n\\left(2^8\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n\\]\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n2^{2x} = 2^4\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set the Exponents Equal\nSince the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:\n\\[\n2x = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\)\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
