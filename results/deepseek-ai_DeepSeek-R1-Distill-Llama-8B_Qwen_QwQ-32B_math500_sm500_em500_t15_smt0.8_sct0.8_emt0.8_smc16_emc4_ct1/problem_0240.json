Since 31 is less than 11111, I'll add a decimal point and zeros to the numerator to make it 31.000000...\n\nNext, I'll perform the long division step by step, dividing 31 by 11111. Each division step will give me a digit of the decimal.\n\nAs I continue the division, I notice that the remainders begin to repeat after a certain number of steps. This repetition indicates that the decimal is repeating.\n\nThe length of the repeating sequence is determined by how many digits repeat before a remainder starts to cycle. In this case, the repeating digits are 06, so the repeating block has 2 digits.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many digits repeat in the decimal expansion of \\( \\frac{31}{11111} \\), let's perform the division step by step.\n\n1. **Set Up the Division:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{31}{11111} = 0.???????\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Long Division Process:**\n   - **Step 1:** \\( 31 \\div 11111 = 0 \\) with a remainder of \\( 31 \\).\n   - **Step 2:** Multiply the remainder by \\( 10 \\) to get \\( 310 \\).\n   - **Step 3:** \\( 310 \\div 11111 = 0 \\) with a remainder of \\( 310 \\).\n   - **Step 4:** Multiply the remainder by \\( 10 \\) to get \\( 3100 \\).\n   - **Step 5:** \\( 3100 \\div 11111 = 0 \\) with a remainder of \\( 3100 \\).\n   - **Step 6:** Multiply the remainder by \\( 10 \\) to get \\( 31000 \\).\n   - **Step 7:** \\( 31000 \\div 11111 = 2 \\) with a remainder of \\( 31000 - 22222 = 8778 \\).\n   - **Step 8:** Multiply the remainder by \\( 10 \\) to get \\( 87780 \\).\n   - **Step 9:** \\( 87780 \\div 11111 = 7 \\) with a remainder of \\( 87780 - 77777 = 10003 \\).\n   - **Step"
