            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about triangle ABC. The area of the triangle is given as \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\), and I need to find \\( \\tan A \\). Hmm, okay. Let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using various formulas. The most common ones are the base times height divided by two, or maybe using Heron's formula. But I also recall another formula that involves the sine of an angle, which is \\( \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are two sides, and \\( C \\) is the included angle. Since the problem is asking about \\( \\tan A \\), maybe this sine formula will come in handy.\n\nSo, in triangle ABC, sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively. That means side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, and side c is opposite angle C. Got it.\n\nThe area is given as \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). Let me write that down: Area = \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). Let me compute that expression a bit to see if I can simplify it.\n\nExpanding \\( (b - c)^2 \\), I get \\( b^2 - 2bc + c^2 \\). So, substituting that into the area, we have:\n\nArea = \\( a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \\).\n\nHmm, so that's \\( a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc \\). I wonder if this can be related to another formula for the area. Let's think about the other formula I mentioned earlier: \\( \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A \\). Since the problem is about finding \\( \\tan A \\), maybe I can relate this to that.\n\nWait, area is also given by \\( \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A \\). So, I can set that equal to the expression we just found:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A = a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + 2"

Let's bring everything to one side:\n\n\\( a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc - \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I should think about another formula involving the sides of the triangle. Oh, right! The Law of Cosines. It states that \\( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A \\). Maybe I can substitute this into the area equation.\n\nLet me do that. Substitute \\( a^2 \\) from the Law of Cosines into the area expression:\n\nArea = \\( (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A) - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc \\).\n\nSimplifying this, let's see:\n\n\\( (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\\cos A) - b^2 - c^2 + 2bc = (-2bc\\cos A) + 2bc \\).\n\nFactor out 2bc:\n\n= \\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\).\n\nSo, Area = \\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\).\n\nBut we also have the area expressed as \\( \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A \\), right? So, we can set these two expressions for the area equal to each other:\n\n\\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A \\).\n\nAlright, let's write that down:\n\n\\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A \\).\n\nFirst, let's note that \\( bc \\) is a common factor on both sides, and since in a triangle, sides can't be zero, we can divide both sides by \\( bc \\):\n\n\\( 2(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin A \\).\n\nNow, let me rewrite this equation for clarity:\n\n\\( 2(1 - \\cos A) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin A \\).\n\nTo make it easier, let's eliminate the fractions by multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 4(1 - \\cos A) = \\sin A \\).\n\nSo"

So, substituting that in:\n\n\\( 1 - \\cos^2 A = 16 - 32\\cos A + 16\\cos^2 A \\).\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( 1 - \\cos^2 A -16 +32\\cos A -16\\cos^2 A = 0 \\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- The constant terms: 1 -16 = -15.\n\n- The \\( \\cos A \\) term: +32\\cos A.\n\n- The \\( \\cos^2 A \\) terms: -1\\cos^2 A -16\\cos^2 A = -17\\cos^2 A.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-17\\cos^2 A +32\\cos A -15 = 0.\n\nHmm, that's a quadratic in terms of \\( \\cos A \\). Let's denote \\( x = \\cos A \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n-17x² +32x -15 = 0.\n\nI can multiply both sides by -1 to make it a bit nicer:\n\n17x² -32x +15 = 0.\n\nNow, let's solve this quadratic equation. The quadratic formula tells us that:\n\nx = [32 ± sqrt(32² -4*17*15)] / (2*17).\n\nCompute discriminant"

Hmm, but let's check if this is correct because when I squared both sides earlier, I might have introduced an extraneous solution, so I should verify with the original equation.\n\nLet me substitute \\( \\cos A =15/17 \\) into \\( 4(1 - \\cos A) = \\sin A \\).\n\nCompute left side: 4*(1 -15/17) = 4*(2/17)=8/17.\n\nCompute right side: \\( \\sin A = \\sqrt{1 - (225/289)}=8/17 \\).\n\nSo, 8/17 =8/17.
