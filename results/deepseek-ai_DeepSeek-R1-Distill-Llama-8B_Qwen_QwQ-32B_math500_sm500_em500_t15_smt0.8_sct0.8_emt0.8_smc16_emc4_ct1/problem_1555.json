Since the table is square, rotations of the same configuration should be considered identical.\n\nI'll start by fixing one person's position to eliminate equivalent rotations. Fixing one person removes the rotational symmetry, leaving the problem to be solved in a linear arrangement.\n\nWith one person fixed, there are 7 remaining people to arrange. These 7 people can be seated in 7! different ways around the table.\n\nHowever, the arrangement isn't completely linear because the table is circular. In circular permutations, the number of arrangements is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. So, for our fixed position, the number of unique circular arrangements would be (7-1)! = 6!.\n\nFinally, considering that each side of the table has 2 people, I need to account for the reflection symmetry. If we fix one person, the reflection symmetry is also eliminated, so I don't need to divide by 2 for reflections.\n\nMultiplying the number of ways to arrange the remaining people by the fixed position, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is 6!.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct seating arrangements for 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we'll consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Fixing a Position to Eliminate Rotational Symmetry:**\n   - Since the table is square, rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new unique configuration. To account for this, we'll fix one person's position.\n\n2. **Arranging the Remaining People:**\n   - With one person fixed, there are 7 people left to arrange around the table.\n   - These 7 people can be arranged in \\(7!\\) ways.\n\n3. **Circular Permutation Consideration:**\n   - The problem is essentially a circular permutation problem because the table has no distinct starting point.\n   - In a circular permutation, the number of arrangements is \\((n-1)!\\) for \\(n\\) people. Here, \\(n = 7\\), so the number of arrangements is \\(6!\\).\n\n4. **Accounting for Reflection Symmetry:**\n   - The table is square, which introduces reflection symmetry. However, since we've already fixed one person's position, the reflection symmetry doesn't create additional equivalent configurations.\n   - Therefore, no further division is needed"
