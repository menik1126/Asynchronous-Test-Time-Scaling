After fixing, there are 7 remaining people to arrange.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to arrange these 7 people around the table, which is 7 factorial (7!).\n\nFinally, I'll consider that each side of the table has 2 people. I'll divide the number of people by the number of people per side, which is 2, giving me 3.5. However, since the number of people must be an integer, I'll need to adjust this.\n\nAfter fixing the first person, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. Then, each pair of adjacent people can be arranged in 2 ways, and there are 4 sides at the table, so I'll multiply by 2^4.\n\nBut since rotations are considered equivalent, I'll divide by the number of possible rotations, which is 4, to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nCombining all these steps, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is 7! multiplied by 2^4, then divided by 4.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, where two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Fix a Person's Position:**\n   - To eliminate rotational symmetry, fix one person's seat. This leaves us with 7 people to arrange around the table.\n\n2. **Arrange the Remaining 7 People:**\n   - The number of ways to arrange 7 people in a circle is given by the formula for circular permutations:\n     \\[\n     (7-1)! = 6! = 720\n     \\]\n   \n3. **Account for Arrangements on Each Side:**\n   - Since each side must have exactly 2 people, we need to consider the internal arrangements of each pair.\n   - For each side (there are 4 sides), the 2 people can be arranged in \\(2\\) ways (e.g., person A on the left and person B on the right, or vice versa).\n   - Therefore, the total number of arrangements"

The correct method is:\n\n- **Correct Approach:**\n  - Fix one person to remove rotational symmetry.

            "output": " number of distinct arrangements is \\(7! \\times 2^4\\), but since we've already fixed one seat, is this the right approach?\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me look up the formula for circular permutations with positions.\n\n**Correct Formula:**\n\nFor a circular table with \\(n\\) seats, the number of distinct arrangements is \\((n-1)!\\). However, when each side must have exactly \\(k\\) people, it's different.\n\nIn this case, it's a square table (\\(4\\) sides) with \\(2\\) people per side, totaling \\(8\\) people. Since the table is square, it's a circular table with rotational symmetry, but the sides are distinguishable based on their positions.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. **Fix one person** to eliminate rotational symmetry. Then, arrange the remaining \\(7\\) people around the table. The number of ways: \\(7!\\).\n\n2. **Assign the people to the sides**: Each side has \\(2\\) people. After fixing one person, the next seats are determined, but the arrangement on each side can be swapped. The number of ways to assign the remaining \\(7\\) people to the \\(4\\) sides (\\(2\\) per side) is \\( \\frac{7!}{4! \\times (2!^4)} \\times 4! \\) (since order of sides doesn't matter) Wait no\u2014because the table's sides are fixed, the order does matter.\n\nWait, actually, when we fix one seat, we can treat the table as linear in the remaining seats. So, after fixing one person, the next 7 seats are in a line. Each pair of adjacent seats corresponds to a side. So, for the remaining 7 seats:\n\n- The first pair (side 1) can have the next two people arranged in 2 ways.\n- The second pair (side 2) similarly can have 2 ways.\n- This continues for all 4 sides, but since we've fixed one person, the total number of side arrangements is \\(2^4\\).\n\nBut in reality, the sides are fixed in their positions relative to each other. So, after fixing one seat, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways, and for each of the 4 sides (which have already been determined by the fixed seat), the two people on each side can be swapped, giving \\(2^4\\).\n\n"

So the total is \\(7! \\times 2^4\\).\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose there are 4 people around a square table with 1 per side. Fix one person, then the remaining 3 can be arranged in 3! ways. So that's correct. If each side had 2 people, then for each side, the two can be swapped, so 2^4. So for 8 people, fixing one, the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways, and each of the 4 sides can have their two people swapped, so multiply by 2^4. So total is 7! * 2^4.\n\nWait, but that would be 5040 * 16 = 80640. But that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when arranging the remaining 7 people, the sides are already determined by their positions. For example, after fixing one person, the next seat is part of the first side, then the next seat is the second side, etc. Wait, no. Let me think of the table as fixed with one person at a specific seat. The seats are arranged in a square, so the next seat clockwise is part of the first side, then the next seat is the second side, etc. Wait, actually, each side has two seats. So after fixing one seat, the next seat is the second seat on the first side, then the next two seats form the second side, etc. Wait, perhaps the arrangement is as follows:\n\nImagine the square table with four sides. Fix one person at a specific seat. The seat clockwise next to them is the second seat on the same side. Then the next two seats form the second side, and so on. So the total number of seats is 8, with two per side. Fixing one seat, the remaining 7 seats are in a linear order (since the table is circular but fixed at one point).

Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, when arranging the remaining 7 people, the sides are already determined by their positions. For example, after fixing one seat, the next seat is part of the same side, so the first side has two seats: the fixed person and the next seat. The next two seats form the second side, etc. Wait, no. Let me think of the table as follows:\n\nImagine the square table with four sides. Each side has two seats. Let's fix person A at seat 1. Then seat 2 is the second seat on the first side. Seats 3 and 4 form the second side, seats 5 and 6 the third side, and seats 7 and 8 the fourth side.

So perhaps the sides are:\n\nSide 1: seats 1 and 2,\n\nSide 2: seats 3 and 4,\n\nSide 3: seats 5 and 6,\n\nSide 4: seats 7 and 8,\n\nBut seat 8 is adjacent to seat 1, so the sides are arranged in order around the table. Therefore, after fixing seat 1, the remaining seats are in order 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. But seat 8 is part of side 4, which is adjacent to seat 1.\n\nTherefore, when arranging the remaining 7 people, the order of the seats is fixed as 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these seats belongs to a specific side. For each side, the two seats can be swapped. For example, side 1 has seats 1 and 2. Since seat 1 is fixed, seat 2 can be any of the remaining people, but the arrangement of seat 2 and seat 1's side can be swapped. Wait, seat 1 is fixed, so the person in seat 2 can be swapped with"
