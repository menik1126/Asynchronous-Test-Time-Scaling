            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here: Let ω be a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{1 + ω} + \\frac{1}{1 + ω^2}\\). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that if ω³ = 1, then ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity, right? One of them is 1 itself, and the other two are complex numbers. These are usually denoted as ω and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, ω and ω² are the non-real cube roots of unity.\n\nNow, I recall that for cube roots of unity, the sum ω + ω² + 1 = 0. That might come in handy later. Also, another important property is that ω³ = 1, so ω³ - 1 = 0, which factors into (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0. Since ω ≠ 1, it must be that ω² + ω + 1 = 0. So, ω² = -ω - 1.\n\nLet me write that down: ω² = -ω - 1. That equation might help simplify the expression I need to compute.\n\nThe expression is S = \\(\\frac{1}{1 + ω} + \\frac{1}{1 + ω²}\\). Let me work on each term separately.\n\nFirst, let's compute 1 + ω². Since ω² = -ω -1, then 1 + ω² = 1 + (-ω -1) = -ω. So, 1 + ω² = -ω. That simplifies the second fraction: 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute 1 + ω. Since ω² = -ω -1, maybe we can express ω in terms of ω², but not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can express 1 + ω in terms of ω².\n\nWait, let's consider both terms:\n\n1 + ω and 1 + ω². If I can find a relation between them, maybe I can add the fractions.\n\nWe have already found that 1 + ω² = -ω. So, the expression"

Now, let me find a common denominator or manipulate these terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute S as it is, by adding the two fractions. Let me try that.\n\nS = [1/(1 + ω)] + [1/(1 + ω²)]. We know that 1 + ω² = -ω, so:\n\nS = [1/(1 + ω)] + [1/(-ω)] = [1/(1 + ω)] - [1/ω].\n\nHmm, so now S is [1/(1 + ω)] - [1/ω]. Let me try to combine these two terms.\n\nTo combine them, I can find a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω) * ω.\n\nSo, S = [ω - (1 + ω)] / [ω(1 + ω)].\n\nLet me compute the numerator: ω - (1 + ω) = ω -1 - ω = -1. So, the numerator is -1.\n\nSo, S = (-1) / [ω(1 + ω)].\n\nNow, the denominator is ω(1 + ω). Let me compute this. We have 1 + ω as it is, and ω is ω.\n\nBut perhaps I can express 1 + ω in terms of ω² or 1.\n\nWait, earlier I had that 1 + ω + ω² = 0. So, 1 + ω = -ω².\n\nThat's a useful substitution. So, 1 + ω = -ω².\n\nLet's substitute that into the denominator:\n\nω(1 + ω) = ω(-ω²) = -ω³.\n\nBut wait, ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, -ω³ = -1.\n\nSo, the denominator is -1.\n\nTherefore, S = (-1)/(-1) = 1.\n\nWait, so is that the case for all ω? Because ω can be either of the two non-real cube roots, ω and ω², but does S evaluate to the same value regardless of which one we take?\n\nLet me check with specific values.

So, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2).

But in this case, ω is replaced by ω², but since ω² is another root, this should give the same value.\n\nWait, actually, if I let ω = ω², but ω and ω² are different roots, but the expression is symmetric in ω and ω². So, it's not clear whether S would be the same. But from the above, when I plug in ω, I get S = 1. Let me try plugging in ω².\n\nCompute 1 + ω²: if ω² = -1/2 - i√3/2, then 1 + ω² = 1 - 1/2 - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2. Which is the same as before. So, 1/(1 + ω²) is 1/(1/2 - i√3/2), which is 1/2 + i√3/2, same as before.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω: if ω = ω², which is -1/2 - i√3/2, so 1 + ω = 1 - 1/2 - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2.

So, even when ω is 1, the expression is 1. Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression is always 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.\n\nWait, so the problem says \"find all possible values\", but since for all cube roots of unity (1, ω, ω²), the expression evaluates to 1, so the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nBut let me confirm once again through algebraic manipulation to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over, let me consider the expression S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).\n\nWe can use the fact that ω² + ω + 1 = 0, so ω² = -ω -1.\n\nLet me substitute ω² into the second term:\n\n1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1 + (-ω -1)) = 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.\n\nTherefore, S = 1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω.\n\nNow, let's combine these two terms:\n\nLet me write them with a common denominator.
