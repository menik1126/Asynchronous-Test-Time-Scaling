            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression (1/(1 + ω)) + (1/(1 + ω²)). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, since ω³ = 1, ω must be a cube root of unity. I remember that the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, ω satisfies the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0. That's a useful identity I can use later on.\n\nNow, the expression I need to evaluate is (1)/(1 + ω) + (1)/(1 + ω²). I think it might help to combine these two fractions into a single fraction to simplify the expression. To do that, I'll find a common denominator, which would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). \n\nSo, let's write it out:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]\n\nSimplifying the numerator: (1 + ω² + 1 + ω) = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nIn the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand this:\n\n(1)(1) + (1)(ω²) + (ω)(1) + (ω)(ω²)\n= 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\nBut wait, ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. So, the last term is 1. Therefore, the denominator becomes:\n\n1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².\n\nWait a minute! So both the numerator and the denominator are 2 + ω + ω². So the expression simplifies to (2 + ω + ω²)/(2 + ω + ω²) = 1. Is that so? That seems too straightforward, but let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in expanding the denominator. Let me double-check:\n\n(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω²\n= 1 + ω² + ω + ω³\n\n"

            "output": "But ω³ = 1, so it's 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω². Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the numerator is 2 + ω + ω², the denominator is also 2 + ω + ω². So, their ratio is indeed 1. Therefore, the expression equals 1.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. The cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω². Are all these roots valid? If ω = 1, then plugging into the original expression, we get (1/(1 + 1)) + (1/(1 + 1²)) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 as well. So whether ω is a primitive cube root of unity or ω = 1, the expression equals 1.\n\nHmm, so does that mean the only possible value is 1? That seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to rationalize the denominators. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with:\n\n1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²)\n\nI can multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + ω) and (1 - ω²), respectively, to rationalize.\n\nWait, maybe that complicates things. Let me think. Since ω² is the conjugate of ω if we consider them in the complex plane. But actually, ω² is the complex conjugate of ω only if ω is a primitive root. Since ω and ω² are complex conjugates, maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, using the identity ω² + ω + 1 = 0, which I mentioned earlier. So 1 + ω = -ω², and 1 + ω² = -ω. So let's substitute that into the expression.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(-ω²) = -1/ω²\n\nSimilarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(-ω) = -1/ω\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n-1/ω² - 1/ω\n\nLet's combine these two terms:\n\n= - (1/ω + 1/ω²)\n\nAgain, let me find a common denominator for 1/ω and 1/ω². The common denominator is ω².\n\nSo, 1/ω = ω/ω² and 1"

            "output": "/ω² is 1/ω². So adding them gives (ω + 1)/ω²\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes - (ω + 1)/ω²\n\nBut from the identity ω² + ω + 1 = 0, we can solve for ω + 1 = -ω². So substituting that in:\n\n- ( -ω² ) / ω² = (ω²)/ω² = 1\n\nSo that also gives 1. So that confirms the previous result.\n\nHmm, so both methods give 1. Therefore, the expression is always 1, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is? Wait, but if ω is 1, then let's check again:\n\nIf ω = 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So that works. If ω is a primitive root, like e^(2πi/3), then the expression is also 1. So the only possible value is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nBut the question says \"find all possible values\". Since ω^3 = 1, there are three roots, but when we plug in each root, do we get different values?\n\nWait, let me check for each root:\n\nCase 1: ω = 1. Then the expression is 1/(2) + 1/(2) = 1.\n\nCase 2: ω = ω (primitive root). Let's compute the expression. Let me take ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2, and ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nCompute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²):\n\nFirst, compute 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSimilarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.\n\nSo, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2).

Multiply by the conjugate:\n\n[1*(1/2 + i√3/2)] / [ (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ] = (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.\n\nSo adding these two: (1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1.\n\nCase 3: ω = ω². So, same as Case 2, because ω² is the conjugate of ω, but when we compute the expression, it will give the same result as Case 2 because addition is commutative. Therefore, 1/(1 + ω²) + 1/(1 + ω) is still 1.\n\nSo, in all three cases, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression evaluates to 1. Thus, the only possible value is 1.\n\nI think that's solid. Both methods, whether substituting with the identity or rationalizing, give the same result, and testing each case individually confirms that. So, the answer must be 1.\n</think>\n\nThe expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity ω. \n\n\\boxed{1}"
