            "output": "First, I need to determine the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the beaker has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, plugging in these values gives V = \u03c0 * (3 cm)\u00b2 * 8 cm = 72\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nNext, I should calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)\u03c0R\u00b3, where R is the radius. With a radius of 6 cm, the volume becomes V = (4/3)\u03c0 * (6 cm)\u00b3 = 288\u03c0 cm\u00b3.\n\nTo find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the total volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker. So, 288\u03c0 cm\u00b3 divided by 72\u03c0 cm\u00b3 equals 4. Therefore, it will take 4 such cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Given:\n   - Radius of the cylinder (\\( r \\)) = 3 cm\n   - Height of the cylinder (\\( h \\)) = 8 cm\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3\\, \\text{cm})^2 (8\\, \\text{cm}) = \\pi \\times 9\\, \\text{cm}^2 \\times 8\\, \\text{cm} = 72\\pi\\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   Given:\n   - Radius of the sphere (\\( R \\)) = 6 cm\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n"
