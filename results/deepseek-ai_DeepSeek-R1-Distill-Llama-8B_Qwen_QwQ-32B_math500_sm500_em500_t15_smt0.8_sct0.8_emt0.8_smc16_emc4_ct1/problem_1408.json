            "output": "I need to determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are required to fill a spherical tank. First, I'll calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the beaker has a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, plugging in these values gives V = π * (3)² * 8 = 72π cm³.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³, where R is the radius of the sphere. With a radius of 6 cm, the volume is V = (4/3)π * (6)³ = (4/3)π * 216 = 288π cm³.\n\nFinally, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, I'll divide the volume of the sphere by the volume of one cylindrical beaker. So, 288π cm³ divided by 72π cm³ equals 4. Therefore, it will take 4 such cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of the Cylindrical Beaker**\n\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( r \\) is the radius\n   - \\( h \\) is the height\n\n   Given:\n   - Radius (\\( r \\)) = 3 cm\n   - Height (\\( h \\)) = 8 cm\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{beaker}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\ \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\n   The volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( R \\) is the radius\n\n   Given:\n   - Radius (\\( R \\)) = 6 cm\n\n   Plugging in the values"
