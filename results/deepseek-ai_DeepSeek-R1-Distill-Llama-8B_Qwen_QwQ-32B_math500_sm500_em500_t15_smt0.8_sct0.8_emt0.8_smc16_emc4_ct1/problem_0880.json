            "output": "To convert the fraction 57/160 into a terminating decimal, I first need to understand the condition under which a fraction results in a terminating decimal. A fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 or 5.\n\nNext, I'll check if the fraction can be simplified. The numerator is 57, and the denominator is 160. 57 factors into 3 and 19, while 160 breaks down into 2^5 multiplied by 5. Since there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nNow, I'll convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 57 by 160. Performing the division, I find that 57 divided by 160 equals 0.35625.\n\nSince the denominator 160 is a product of only 2s and 5s, the decimal will terminate after a finite number of places without any recurring digits.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Condition for a Terminating Decimal:**\n   - A fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) will result in a terminating decimal if the denominator \\(b\\), after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms, has no prime factors other than 2 or 5.\n\n2. **Simplify \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\):**\n   - The numerator is 57, and the denominator is 160.\n   - Check if 57 and 160 have any common factors besides 1:\n     - 57 factors into \\(3 \\times 19\\).\n     - 160 factors into \\(2^5 \\times 5\\).\n   - Since there are no common factors, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Convert to Decimal by Division:**\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Terminating Nature:**\n   - The simplified denominator (160) only has prime factors 2 and 5 (\\(2^5 \\times 5\\)), so the decimal terminates after the division.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
