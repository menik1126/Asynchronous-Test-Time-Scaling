            "output": "I need to convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) into a terminating decimal.\n\nFirst, I'll check if the denominator has any prime factors other than 2 or 5. The denominator is 160, which can be factored into \\(2^5 \\times 5\\). Since all prime factors of the denominator are either 2 or 5, the decimal will terminate.\n\nNext, I'll express the fraction with a denominator that is a multiple of 10. I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to get \\(\\frac{285}{800}\\).\n\nThen, I'll simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. This results in \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\), confirming it's in its simplest form.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the numerator by the denominator to find the decimal equivalent. Dividing 57 by 160 gives 0.35625.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator:**\n   - The denominator is 160. Factor it into prime factors:\n     \\[\n     160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n     \\]\n   - Since the denominator has only the prime factors 2 and 5, the decimal will terminate.\n\n2. **Make the Denominator a Power of 10:**\n   - To convert the denominator to a power of 10, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57 \\times 5}{160 \\times 5} = \\frac{285}{800}\n     \\]\n   - The new denominator is \\(800 = 10^2 \\times 8\\), but we can multiply numerator and denominator by another 10 to make it a power of 10:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{285}{800} = \\frac{285 \\times 10}{800 \\times 10} = \\frac{2850}{8000}\n     \\]\n   - Now, the denominator is \\(8000 = 10^3\\).\n\n3. **Divide Numerator by Denominator:**\n   - Perform the division:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2850}{8000} = 0.35625\n     \\"
