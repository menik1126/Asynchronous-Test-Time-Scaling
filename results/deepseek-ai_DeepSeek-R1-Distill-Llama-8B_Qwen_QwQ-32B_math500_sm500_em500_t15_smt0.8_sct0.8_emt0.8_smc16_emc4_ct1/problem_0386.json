            "output": "To find the height of the cylinder, I'll start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nFrom the problem, the volume is given as 45\u03c0 cubic centimeters. I'll substitute this value into the formula to find h.\n\nSo, 45\u03c0 = \u03c0r\u00b2h.\n\nNext, I'll divide both sides of the equation by \u03c0 to simplify it, resulting in 45 = r\u00b2h.\n\nI know that the radius r is provided as 3 cm. I'll substitute 3 for r in the equation, leading to 45 = (3\u00b2)h.\n\nCalculating 3 squared gives me 9. So now, the equation is 45 = 9h.\n\nFinally, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for h. This gives h = 5 cm.\n\nTherefore, the height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius,\n- \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n**Given:**\n- \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters,\n- \\( r = 3 \\) centimeters.\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute the known values into the formula.\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\( \\pi \\).\n\\[\n45 = 9h\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9.\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\nThe height of the cylinder is \\(\\boxed{5}\\) centimeters."
