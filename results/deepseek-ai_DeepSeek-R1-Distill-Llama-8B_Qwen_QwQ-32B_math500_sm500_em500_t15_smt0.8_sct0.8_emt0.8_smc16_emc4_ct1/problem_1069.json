Given that each side of the hexagon is 16 cm, the perimeter can be calculated by multiplying the number of sides by the length of one side.\n\nOnce I have the hexagon's perimeter, I'll set it equal to the perimeter of the regular octagon. A regular octagon has eight equal sides, so I'll divide the total perimeter by eight to find the length of one side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Hexagon:**\n   \n   A regular hexagon has **6 equal sides**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of Hexagon} = 6 \\times \\text{Side length of Hexagon}\n   \\]\n   \n   Given that each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of Hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\,\\text{cm} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Perimeter of the Octagon:**\n   \n   The problem states that the regular octagon has the **same perimeter** as the hexagon.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of Octagon} = 96\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Length of Each Side of the Octagon:**\n   \n   A regular octagon has **8 equal sides**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Side length of Octagon} = \\frac{\\text{Perimeter of Octagon}}{\\text{Number of sides of Octagon}} = \\frac{96\\,\\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\,\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe length of each side of the regular octagon is \\(\\boxed{12\\ \\text{cm}}\\)."
