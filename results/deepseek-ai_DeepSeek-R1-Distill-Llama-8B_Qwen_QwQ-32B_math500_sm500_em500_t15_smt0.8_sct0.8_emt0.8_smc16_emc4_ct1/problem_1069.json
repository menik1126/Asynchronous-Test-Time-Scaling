            "output": "First, I need to determine the perimeter of the regular hexagon. Since it's a regular hexagon, all its sides are equal, and the length of each side is given as 16 cm. I can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the number of sides by the length of one side. There are 6 sides in a regular hexagon.\n\nNext, I need to find the perimeter of the regular octagon. The problem states that the perimeters of both shapes are equal. Therefore, I can set the perimeter of the hexagon equal to the perimeter of the octagon.\n\nFor the octagon, I also know that it has 8 sides, and since it's regular, all sides are equal. Let's denote the length of one side of the octagon as \\( x \\) cm. The perimeter of the octagon will then be 8 times \\( x \\).\n\nSince the perimeters are equal, I can set up the equation: 6 times the side length of the hexagon equals 8 times the side length of the octagon. Plugging in the known value of the hexagon's side length, the equation becomes 6 * 16 = 8 * x.\n\nFinally, I can solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. This will give me the length of each side of the octagon.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of each side of the regular octagon, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the perimeter of the regular hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular hexagon has **6 sides**.\n   - Each side of the hexagon is **16 cm**.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter of Hexagon} = 6 \\times 16\\, \\text{cm} = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the perimeter of the octagon equal to the perimeter of the hexagon.**\n   \n   - A regular octagon has **8 sides**.\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the length of each side of the octagon.\n   \n   \\[\n   8x = 96\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\).**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{96\\, \\text{cm}}{8} = 12\\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**"
