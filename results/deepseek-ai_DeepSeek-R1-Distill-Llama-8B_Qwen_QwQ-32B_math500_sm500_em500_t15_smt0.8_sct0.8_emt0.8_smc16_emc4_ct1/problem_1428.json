This gives \\(k = 2^{24/n}\\).\n\nSince k must be an integer, \\(24/n\\) must be an integer. Therefore, n must be a divisor of 24.\n\nNext, I'll list all the positive divisors of 24 greater than 1. These divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\n\nSo, there are 7 positive integers n > 1 for which \\(2^{24}\\) is a perfect nth power.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) the expression \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**:\n   A number \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( k \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   2^{24} = k^n\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express \\( k \\) in Terms of \\( n \\)**:\n   Taking the \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) root of both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   k = 2^{24/n}\n   \\]\n   For \\( k \\) to be an integer, \\( 24/n \\) must be an integer. Therefore, \\( n \\) must be a divisor of 24.\n\n3. **Find the Divisors of 24**:\n   The positive divisors of 24 are:\n   \\[\n   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n   \\]\n   Since \\( n > 1 \\), we exclude 1 from the list.\n\n4. **Count the Valid Divisors**:\n   The valid divisors greater than 1 are:\n   \\[\n   2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n   \\]\n   There are **7** such divisors.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]"
