This implies that the exponent in the prime factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\).

Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) for which \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power.\n</think>\n\nTo determine for how many positive integers \\( n > 1 \\) it's true that \\( 2^{24} \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding Perfect Powers:**\n   A number \\( k \\) is a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power if there exists an integer \\( m \\) such that \\( k = m^n \\). This implies that the prime factorization of \\( k \\) must have exponents that are all divisible by \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of \\( 2^{24} \\):**\n   The number \\( 2^{24} \\) has a prime factorization consisting only of the prime number 2 raised to the 24th power:\n   \\[\n   2^{24}\n   \\]\n   Here, the exponent is 24.\n\n3. **Determining Divisors of the Exponent:**\n   For \\( 2^{24} \\) to be a perfect \\( n^{\\text{th}} \\) power, the exponent \\( 24 \\) must be divisible by \\( n \\). This means that \\( n \\) must be a **divisor** of 24.\n\n4. **Finding All Divisors of 24:**\n   The positive divisors of 24 are:\n   \\[\n   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Excluding \\( n = 1 \\):**\n   The problem specifies \\( n > 1 \\), so we exclude 1 from the list:\n   \\[\n   2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Counting the Valid \\( n \\) Values:**\n   There are 7 values in the list above.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]"
