Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a matrix transforms a vector, it essentially applies a linear transformation. So, if I can figure out what this matrix M looks like, maybe I can then apply it to the entire line y = 2x + 1.\n\nThe problem gives me two specific transformations:\n1. M takes the vector [2; -1] to [9; 3].\n2. M takes the vector [1; -3] to [7; -1].\n\nSo, if I can write M as a matrix, I can then represent the transformation for any vector.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\\[ M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nWhen M is multiplied by a vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\\), it gives:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a x + b y \\\\ c x + d y \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nGiven the first transformation, [2; -1] maps to [9; 3]. So:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nWhich gives the equations:\n1. \\( 2a + (-1)b = 9 \\) → \\( 2a - b = 9 \\)\n2. \\( 2c + (-1)d = 3 \\) → \\( 2c - d = 3 \\)\n\nSimilarly, the second transformation, [1; -3] maps to [7; -1], so:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix"

Great, so the matrix seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under the transformation M.\n\nI remember that the image of a line under a linear transformation is another line. So, to find the equation of this image line, I can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let me parameterize the line y = 2x + 1. Let x = t, then y = 2t + 1. So, the parametric equations are:\n   x = t\n   y = 2t + 1\n\n2. Now, apply the transformation M to this parameterization.\n\n   So, if I have a point (t, 2t + "

Wait, M is applied to the vector (t, 2t + 1). So, the vector is:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} t \\\\ 2t + 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nSo, multiplying by M:\nFirst component: 4*t + (-1)*(2t + 1) = 4t - 2t -1 = 2t -1\nSecond component: 2*t + 1*(2t + 1) = 2t + 2t +1 = 4t +1\n\nSo, the transformed vector is:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 2t - 1 \\\\ 4t + 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nTherefore, the image of the parameter t is (2t -1, 4t +1). Now, I need to eliminate the parameter t to find the relation between x and y.\n\nFrom the parametric equations:\nx = 2t -1\ny = 4t +1\n\nI can solve for t in terms of x:\nx = 2t -1 → 2t = x +1 → t = (x +1)/2\n\nNow, plug this into y:\ny = 4*((x +1)/2) +1 = 2(x +1) +1 = 2x + 2 +1 = 2x + 3\n\nSo, the equation of the image line is y = 2x + 3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward.

The result is y = 2x +3.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to think of M as a linear transformation and then find its effect on the line.\n\nBut let me verify this result by another approach to ensure it"

            "output": "'s correct.\n\nAnother approach: The line y = 2x +1 can be written as all points (x, y) such that y = 2x +1. To find the image under M, we can consider that the image of any point (x, y) on the line is M*(x, y). Since the line is affine (not a subspace), the transformation is affine as well, but since M is linear, the image will be an affine line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express the line in terms of vectors. Let me think.\n\nThe line can be expressed as a point plus a direction vector. Let me see.\n\nFirst, the line y = 2x +1 can be written parametrically as:\n\nLet’s take a point on the line. For example, when x = 0, y =1, so the point (0,1) is on the line. The direction vector of the line is (1, 2), since the slope is 2.\n\nTherefore, the line can be written as (0,1) + t*(1,2), where t is a parameter.\n\nTherefore, any point on the line is (t, 2t +1), which is the same as the parameterization I used earlier.\n\nTherefore, applying M to this parametric form gives the same result as before.\n\nSo, the image of the line is the set of points M*( (0,1) + t*(1,2) ) = M*(0,1) + t*M*(1,2).\n\nTherefore, the image line is the image of the point (0,1) plus t times the image of the direction vector (1,2).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute M*(0,1):\n\nM*(0,1) = [4*0 + (-1)*1, 2*0 +1*1]^T = [ -1, 1 ]^T.\n\nThen, compute M*(1,2):\n\nM*(1,2) = [4*1 + (-1)*2, 2*1 +1*2]^T = [4 -2, 2 +2]^T = [2,4]^T.\n\nTherefore, the image line is the point (-1,1) plus t*(2,4). So parametric equations:\n\nx = -1 + 2t\n\ny = 1 +4t\n\n"

So that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the image line is y = 2x +3.\n\nI think that's solid. Alternatively, another method could involve solving for the inverse, but since we're dealing with a linear transformation, perhaps not necessary.\n\nWait, actually, I'm a bit concerned because the original line has a slope of 2, and the transformed line also has a slope of 2. Is that always the case?\n\nWait, maybe not. The slope under linear transformation depends on determinant of M. Wait, so let me check the determinant of M.\n\nDeterminant of M is (4)(1) - (-1)(2) =4 +2 =6.\n\nWhich is non-zero, so M is invertible.\n\nBut the image of the line under M would be another line if the original line is not a subspace. Hmm, but actually, unless the line is invariant under M, which it's not necessarily.\n\nBut in this case, the slope after transformation is 2, same as original. Wait, that's interesting. So, even though the slope remains the same, the intercept has changed from 1 to 3.\n\nI think that makes sense because the transformation can scale or shear the line, but the slope depends on the angle. But in this case, the slope remains the same, so the lines are parallel, but offset.\n\nBut in this problem, the image is another line, which in this case is y=2x+3.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is y=2x+3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe image of the line \\( y = 2x + 1 \\) under \\( \\mathbf{M} \\) is \\boxed{y = 2x + 3}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) that transforms the vectors \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) to \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix"
