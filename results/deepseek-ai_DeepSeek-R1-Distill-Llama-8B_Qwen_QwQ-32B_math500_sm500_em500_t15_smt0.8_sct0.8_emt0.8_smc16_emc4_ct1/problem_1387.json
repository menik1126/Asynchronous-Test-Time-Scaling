            "output": "Alright, so I need to figure out how the matrix M transforms the line y = 2x + 1. Hmm, okay, let me start by recalling what I know about matrices and linear transformations.\n\nFirst off, a matrix M can take a vector in the plane and map it to another vector. The problem gives me two specific transformations: M takes the vector [2, -1] to [9, 3], and it takes [1, -3] to [7, -1]. So, if I can figure out what M is, then I can apply it to any point on the line y = 2x + 1.\n\nWait, but how do I find the matrix M from the given information? I think I need at least two vectors to determine a matrix, but here I have two transformations. Maybe I can set up a system of equations or something.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\\[ M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nThen, according to the problem:\n- M * [2, -1]^T = [9, 3]^T\n- M * [1, -3]^T = [7, -1]^T\n\nLet me write these as equations.\n\nFirst transformation:\n- \\( a*2 + b*(-1) = 9 \\) => 2a - b = 9\n- \\( c*2 + d*(-1) = 3 \\) => 2c - d = 3\n\nSecond transformation:\n- \\( a*1 + b*(-3) = 7 \\) => a - 3b = 7\n- \\( c*1 + d*(-3) = -1 \\) => c - 3d = -1\n\nSo, now I have four equations:\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. 2c - d = 3\n3. a - 3b = 7\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c, d. That should give me the matrix M. Let me try to solve these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with equations 1 and 3 for a and b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9\nFrom equation 3: a - 3b = 7\n\nI can use substitution"

Let me use elimination.\n\nLet me multiply equation 3 by 2 to make the coefficient of a equal to 2a:\n\nEquation 3 multiplied by 2: 2a - 6b = 14\n\nSubtract equation 1: (2a - 6b) - (2a - b) = 14 - 9\nSo, 2a -6b -2a + b = 5\nSimplify: (-5b) = 5 => b = -1\n\nNow, plug b = -1 into equation 1: 2a - (-1) = 9 => 2a +1 =9 => 2a=8 => a=4\n\nSo, a=4, b=-1.\n\nNow, moving on to c and d using equations 2 and 4.\n\nEquation 2: 2c - d = 3\nEquation 4: c - 3d = -1\n\nLet me solve these two equations.\n\nFrom equation 4: c = 3d -1\n\nPlug this into equation 2: 2*(3d -1) - d = 3 => 6d - 2 - d = 3 => 5d -2 =3 => 5d=5 => d=1\n\nThen, c=3*1 -1 = 2.\n\nSo, c=2, d=1.\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n\\[ M = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -1 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nAlright, now that I have M, I need to find the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M.\n\nHmm, so I need to apply M to every point (x, y) on the line y=2x+1 and see what the transformation looks like. But since M is linear, the image of the line should also be a line. So, I can pick two points on the line, apply M to them, and then find the equation of the line connecting those transformed points.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Since the line is affine (it includes all points (x, 2x+1)), the transformation M would map it to another affine line, which can be found by transforming two points on the original line and then finding the equation.\n\nAlternatively,"

So, point A is (0,1).\n\nWhen x=1, y=3. So, point B is (1,3).\n\nNow, let's apply M to these points.\n\nFor point A: [0,1]^T.\n\nM * [0,1] = [4*0 + (-1)*1, 2*0 +1*1] = [-1, 1].\n\nFor point B: [1,3]^T.\n\nM * [1,3] = [4*1 + (-1)*3, 2*1 +1*3] = [4 -3, 2 +3] = [1, 5].\n\nSo, the transformed points are (-1,1) and (1,5).\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation.\n\nWait, for point A: 0,1.\n\nM is [4 -1; 2 1]. So, 4*0 + (-1)*1 = -1, 2*0 +1*1=1. So yes, (-1,1).\n\nFor point B: 1,3.\n\n4*1 + (-1)*3=4-3=1, 2*1 +1*3=2+3=5. So yes, (1,5).\n\nNow, I can find the equation of the line connecting (-1,1) and (1,5).\n\nLet me find the slope first.\n\nSlope m = (5 -1)/(1 - (-1)) = 4 / 2 = 2.\n\nSo, the slope is 2. Now, using point-slope form with point (-1,1):\n\ny -1 = 2(x +1)\n\nSimplify: y -1 = 2x +2 => y = 2x +3.\n\nSo, the image of the line under M is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me confirm using another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternative approach: express y=2x+1 as a general vector [x, 2x"

Let me express this as a parametric equation.\n\nLet me denote t as x, so:\n\nx' = 2t -1\n\ny' =4t +1\n\nNow, I can eliminate t to find the relation between x' and y'.\n\nFrom x' = 2t -1 => t = (x' +1)/2\n\nPlug into y' =4t +1:\n\ny' =4*(x' +1)/2 +1 = 2(x' +1) +1 = 2x' +2 +1 = 2x' +3.\n\nSo, y' =2x' +3.\n\nSame result! So, that's reassuring.\n\nSo, the image of the line y=2x +1 under M is y=2x +3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors in the matrix M. Maybe I should double-check.\n\nGiven that M is [4 -1; 2 1], let's verify the transformations:\n\nFor [2, -1]^T:\n\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1)=8 +1=9, which matches the first component.\n\n2*2 +1*(-1)=4 -1=3, which matches the second component. So that's correct.\n\nFor [1, -3]^T:\n\n4*1 + (-1)*(-3)=4 +3=7, which is correct.\n\n2*1 +1*(-3)=2 -3=-1, which is correct. So M is correctly determined.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The transformation is linear, so the image of the line y=2x+1 is another line. Since y=2x+1 is a straight line, applying a linear transformation would result in another straight line, possibly"

But I think I did that already.\n\nWait, perhaps I can also find the image by considering that the matrix M can be expressed in terms of its columns, which represent the images of the standard basis vectors.\n\nSince M = [4 -1; 2 1], the columns are [4,2] and [-1,1].\n\nGiven that, if I think of the original line as a combination of points, then the image would be a combination of the images of the basis vectors scaled by the coordinates of the original points.\n\nAlternatively, for any point (x, y) on y=2x +1, the image point is (4x - y, 2x + y).\n\nWait, because M * [x; y] = [4x - y; 2x + y]. Since y =2x +1, substituting that in:\n\nx' =4x - (2x +1)=2x -1\n\ny'=2x + (2x +1)=4x +1\n\nWhich is the same as above.
