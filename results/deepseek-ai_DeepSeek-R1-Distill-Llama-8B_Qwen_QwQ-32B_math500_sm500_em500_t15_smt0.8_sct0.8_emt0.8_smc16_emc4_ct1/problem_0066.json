I need to find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of these two numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) and figure out what the maximum value of that can be. \n\nI think the Euclidean algorithm might be useful here. It’s a method for finding the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying division and taking remainders. Let me recall how it works. So, if I have two numbers, say \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), with \\( a > b \\), then \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b) \\). I can keep doing this until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the gcd.\n\nLet me apply this to the given problem. Let \\( a = 2n + 1 \\) and \\( b = n + 7 \\). Since \\( 2n + 1 \\) is definitely larger than \\( n + 7 \\) for positive integers \\( n \\), I can write:\n\n\\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = \\gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) \\mod (n + 7)) \\).\n\nNow, I need to compute \\( (2n + 1) \\mod (n + 7) \\). That is, the remainder when \\( 2n + 1 \\) is divided by \\( n + 7 \\). Let me perform the division:\n\nDivide \\( 2n + 1 \\) by \\( n + 7 \\). \n\nHow many times does \\( n + 7 \\) go into \\( 2n + 1 \\)? Well, \\( n + 7 \\) goes twice into \\( 2n + 1 \\) because \\( 2 \\times (n + 7) = 2n + 14 \\). \n\nSo, subtracting \\( 2n + 14 \\) from \\( "

So, taking modulo, the remainder is \\( -13 \\mod (n + 7) \\). But since we're dealing with positive integers, I can add \\( n + 7 \\) to \\( -13 \\) to get a positive remainder. However, actually, in the Euclidean algorithm, the remainder is always non-negative and less than the divisor. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I should express \\( 2n + 1 \\) in terms of \\( n + 7 \\). Let's see:\n\nLet me write \\( 2n + 1 = q(n + 7) + r \\), where \\( q \\) is the quotient and \\( r \\) is the remainder. So, I need to find \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq r < n + 7 \\).\n\nDividing \\( 2n + 1 \\) by \\( n + 7 \\), how?\n\nLet me think of \\( 2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13 \\). Because \\( 2(n + 7) = 2n + 14 \\), so \\( 2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13 \\). That makes sense because \\( 2n + 14 - 13 = 2n + 1 \\). So, \\( q = 2 \\) and \\( r = -13 \\). But since the remainder can't be negative, I can add \\( n + 7 \\) to \\( -13 \\) to make it positive.\n\nWait, that might not be straightforward. Let me instead perform the division step-by-step. \n\nLet me denote:\n\n\\( 2n + 1 = k(n + 7) + r \\), where \\( k \\) is the quotient and \\( r \\) is the remainder.\n\nWe can find \\( k \\) by dividing \\( n + 7 \\) into \\( 2n + 1 \\). \n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n\\( 2n + 1 = (n + "

But since the remainder must be non-negative and less than \\( n + 7 \\), this suggests that perhaps I need to adjust. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the remainder as \\( (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = -13 \\), so the remainder is actually \\( (n + 7) - 13 \\) if I add \\( n + 7 \\) to the negative remainder? Wait, no, that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remainder is just the absolute value? Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the property that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a - kb) \\) for any integer \\( k \\). So, let me subtract \\( 2 \\times (n + 7) \\) from \\( 2n + 1 \\):\n\n\\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = \\gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7)) \\).\n\nCalculating the second term:\n\n\\( (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, -13) \\). But gcd is always non-negative, so it's \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\).\n\nAh! That's a key step. So, the gcd simplifies to \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\). \n\nTherefore, the gcd of \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) is equal to the gcd of \\( n + 7 \\) and 13. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\), where \\( n \\) is a positive integer. \n\nNow, since 13 is a prime number, the gcd can only be 1 or 13. Because the divisors of 13 are 1 and 13. Therefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd is "

So, \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, we can write \\( n = 13k - 7 \\) for some integer \\( k \\) such that \\( n > 0 \\). \n\nLet me check: If \\( n = 13k - 7 \\), then \\( n + 7 = 13k \\), which is indeed a multiple of 13. Therefore, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) = 13 \\), and so \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13 \\).\n\nIs there any way the gcd could be higher than 13? Well, since 13 is a prime, the only possible divisors are 1 and 13, so 13 is the maximum possible. \n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd is 13. \n\nBut wait, just to double-check, let me pick an \\( n \\) such that \\( n + 7 = 13 \\times 1 = 13 \\). Then, \\( n = 6 \\). Let's compute \\( \\gcd(6 + 7, 2 \\times 6 + 1) = \\gcd(13, 13) = 13 \\).

Let's see, when \\( k = 1 \\), \\( n = 6 \\), which is positive. For \\( k = 0 \\), \\( n = -7 \\), which is invalid since \\( n \\) must be positive. So, \\( k \\) must be at least 1 for \\( n \\) to be positive.\n\nIs there a case where the gcd could be higher than 13? Suppose \\( n + 7 \\) is a multiple of 13 squared, i.e., 169. Then \\( n = 169 - 7 = 162 \\). Compute \\( 2n + 1 = 324 + 1 = 325 \\). Then, \\( \\gcd(169, 325) \\). 169 is 13², 325 is 5²×13. So, gcd is 13² = 169? Wait, no. Wait, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(169, 325) \\). Let me compute it:\n\n325 divided by 169 is 1 with remainder 156. Then, gcd(169, 156). 169 divided by 156 is 1 with remainder 13. Then, gcd(156,13). 156 divided by 13 is 12 with remainder 0. So, gcd is 13. So, even if \\( n + 7 \\) is a higher multiple of 13, the gcd remains 13. So, the gcd cannot be higher than 13 because 2n + 1 is only 1 more than 2n, which isn't a multiple of 13 beyond the initial division.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of the gcd is indeed 13.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is 13.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm:**\n   Let’s denote \\( a = 2n + 1 \\) and \\( b = n + 7 \\"
