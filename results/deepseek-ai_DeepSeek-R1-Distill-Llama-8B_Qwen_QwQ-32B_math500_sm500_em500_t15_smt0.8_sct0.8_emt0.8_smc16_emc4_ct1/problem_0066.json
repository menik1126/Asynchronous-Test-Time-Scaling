Hmm, gcds can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that one common method to find the gcd of two numbers is the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me write down the two expressions: n + 7 and 2n + 1. I think the Euclidean algorithm involves subtracting multiples of the smaller number from the larger one, or something like that. Maybe I can subtract a multiple of one from the other to simplify.\n\nLet me denote a = n + 7 and b = 2n + 1. I need to find gcd(a, b). According to the Euclidean algorithm, gcd(a, b) is equal to gcd(b, a mod b). So, I need to find a mod b, which is the remainder when a is divided by b.\n\nBut before that, let me see if I can express a in terms of b or vice versa. Let me try subtracting some multiple of b from a. Let's see:\n\na = n + 7\nb = 2n + 1\n\nSo, if I multiply a by 2, I get 2a = 2n + 14. If I subtract b from 2a, I get:\n\n2a - b = (2n + 14) - (2n + 1) = 13.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, 2a - b = 13, which implies that b = 2a - 13.\n\nWait, but I think I need to do this in reverse. Let me think again.\n\nActually, in the Euclidean algorithm, I can subtract any multiple of b from a. Let me try to express a in terms of b.\n\na = n + 7\nb = 2n + 1\n\nLet me solve for n in terms of a: a = n + 7 => n = a - 7.\n\nSubstitute n into b: b = 2(a - 7) + 1 = 2a - 14 + 1 = 2a - 13.\n\nSo, b = 2a - 13.\n\nTherefore, I can write a = (b + 13"

            "output": ")/2. Hmm, but maybe this isn't the most straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the Euclidean algorithm step:\n\ngcd(2n + 1, n + 7). Since 2n + 1 is larger than n + 7 when n is positive, we can compute gcd(2n + 1, n + 7).\n\nThe first step in the Euclidean algorithm would be to subtract 2 times the smaller number from the larger one. Let me see:\n\ngcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7))\n\nCalculating the second part: (2n +1) - 2*(n +7) = 2n +1 -2n -14 = -13.\n\nSo, gcd(n +7, -13). Since gcd is always positive, this is gcd(n +7, 13).\n\nTherefore, the gcd simplifies to gcd(n +7, 13). So the gcd is either 1 or 13, depending on whether 13 divides n +7.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd is 13, provided that n +7 is a multiple of 13. So, if n +7 is divisible by 13, then the gcd is 13, otherwise, it's 1. Therefore, the maximum possible gcd is 13.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check this again. Because when I did the step:\n\ngcd(2n +1, n +7) = gcd(n +7, (2n +1 - 2*(n +7))) = gcd(n +7, -13). Since gcd is always non-negative, that's gcd(n +7,13). So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the gcd can be 13 if 13 divides n +7, otherwise it's 13's divisor, which is 1 or 13. Since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the maximum possible gcd is 13. So the answer should be 13.\n\nBut let me test with an example to make sure. Let me pick n such that n +7 is divisible by 13. Let's say n +7"

            "output": " =13, so n=6. Then, n +7=13, and 2n +1=13. So the gcd(13,13)=13. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: n =13*2 -7=26-7=19. Then n +7=26, and 2n+1=39. Then gcd(26,39). Well, 26 divides into 39 once with a remainder of 13. Then, gcd(26,13)=13. So that also gives 13.\n\nAnother example: n=13*3 -7=39-7=32. Then, n+7=39, 2n+1=65. gcd(39,65). 39 divides into 65 once with remainder 26. Then, gcd(39,26). 26 divides into 39 once with remainder 13. Then, gcd(26,13)=13.\n\nSeems consistent. What if n+7 isn't a multiple of 13? Let's take n=1. Then, n +7=8, 2n +1=3. gcd(8,3)=1. Another one: n=2. Then, n +7=9, 2n +1=5. gcd(9,5)=1. n=3: n +7=10, 2n +1=7. gcd(10,7)=1. n=4: 11 and 9, gcd 1. n=5:12 and 11, gcd1. n=6:13 and13, gcd13.\n\nWait, n=6 is the case we considered earlier. So seems like 13 is achievable.\n\nIs there a case where the gcd can be higher than 13? For that, 13 would have to be a common divisor, but it's the maximum possible because 13 is a prime. So, indeed, the maximum gcd is 13.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value is 13.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest possible value of gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) is 13. This occurs when n + 7 is a multiple of 13, as shown through the Euclidean algorithm and examples.\n\n\\boxed{13}"
