The answer should be in the form \\( \\sqrt{a}/b \\), where \\( a \\) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one, and then find \\( a + b \\).\n\nFirst, I remember that the distance from a point \\( (x, y) \\) to the origin \\( (0, 0) \\) is given by the formula \\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\). Since we're looking for the minimum distance, we can set up an equation where we minimize \\( D \\).\n\nGiven \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\), I can substitute this into the distance formula to get an equation in terms of \\( x \\) only. So, substituting \\( y \\):\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\right)^2} \\)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n\\( D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left( \\frac{x^2 - 3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2} \\)\n\nCalculating the squared term:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{x^2 - 3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\)\n\nSo, the distance squared \\( D^2 \\) is:\n\n\\( D^2 = x^2 + \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\)\n\nTo make it easier, let's call \\( f(x) = D^2 \\) so we can work with \\( f(x) \\) instead:\n\n\\( f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}{2} \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFirst, expand the numerator:\n\n\\( x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \\)\n\nSo, \\( f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{x^4 - 6x^2 + 9}{2} \\)\n\nTo combine the terms, let's write \\( x^2 \\) as \\("

Therefore, the minimal distance is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{2} \\).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph\". So, based on this, the minimal distance is \\( \\sqrt{10}/2 \\), so \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\). But 10 isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, since 10 factors into 2*5, neither of which are perfect squares.\n\nSo, \\( a = 10 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\), so \\( a + b = 12 \\).\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Did I compute \\( f(\\sqrt{2}) \\) correctly?\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n\\( f(\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\\sqrt{2})^2 + 9}{2} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 9}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} \\), yes that's correct.\n\nSo, yeah, it seems correct.

Because sometimes, when you have a graph, the minimal distance could be somewhere else. Let me visualize the graph.\n\nThe given function is \\( y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \\). So it's a parabola opening upwards, shifted down by \\( \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), and scaled vertically by \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nThe vertex of the parabola is at \\( (0, -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\). So, the point (0, y) is at \\( y = -\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\), which is quite low. But the origin is at (0,0). So, the closest point might not necessarily be the vertex.\n\nWait, if the vertex is the lowest point, then the distance from (0,0) to (0, -3/sqrt(2)) is 3/sqrt(2), which is about 2.121, which is larger than the distance we found at x = sqrt(2), which is about 1.581. So, indeed, sqrt(10)/2 is smaller.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other minima or maybe I made a mistake in calculating f(x). Wait, let's double-check.\n\nWait, when I derived \\( f(x) \\), I had:\n\n\\( f(x) = x^2 + \\frac{(x^2 - 3)^2}{2} \\)\n\nWhich expands to:\n\n\\( x^2 + \\frac{x^4 - 6x^2 + 9}{2} = \\frac{2x^2 + x^4 -6x^2 +9}{2} = \\frac{x^4 -4x^2 +9}{2} \\). Yes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, when taking the derivative, I correctly applied the chain rule, so \\( f'(x) = (4x^3 - 8x)/2 = 2x^3 -4x \\). Correct.\n\nSetting to zero: "

But sqrt(5/2) can be written as sqrt(10)/2, since sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/2 = sqrt(10)/2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using calculus of variations or parametrization, but I think the method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using geometry: the minimal distance from a point to a curve is along the line perpendicular to the tangent of the curve at that point. So, perhaps setting the line from the origin to the point (x,y) on the curve to be perpendicular to the tangent of the curve at (x,y).\n\nLet me try that approach to confirm.\n\nFirst, the curve is y = (x² -3)/sqrt(2). The derivative dy/dx = (2x)/sqrt(2) = x*sqrt(2).\n\nThe slope of the tangent line at any point (x,y) is m = x*sqrt(2).\n\nThe slope of the line connecting the origin (0,0) to (x,y) is (y - 0)/(x -0) = y/x = [(x² -3)/sqrt(2)] / x = (x² -3)/(x sqrt(2)).\n\nFor these two lines to be perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to -1.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[ x*sqrt(2) ] * [ (x² -3)/(x sqrt(2)) ] = -1\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe x cancels, sqrt(2) cancels, so:\n\n(x² -3) = -1\n\nTherefore:\n\nx² -3 = -1\n\nx² = 2\n\nx = ±√2\n\nWhich matches the critical points we found earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the minimal distance occurs at x = ±√2, so the minimal distance is sqrt(10)/2, so a + b = 12.\n\nTherefore, I"
