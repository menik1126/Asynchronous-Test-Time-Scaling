            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function y equals (1 over root 2) times (x squared minus 3). And then express that distance as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I need to find the sum of a and b.\n\nAlright, first step, I think I should recall how to find the distance from a point to another point. The distance formula between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Since we're dealing with the origin (0,0) and a point (x, y) on the graph, the distance D would be sqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2], which simplifies to sqrt(x^2 + y^2).\n\nBut since y is given in terms of x, I can substitute that into the distance formula. So, let's let y be (1/sqrt(2))(x^2 - 3). Then, the distance squared (since the square root can complicate things) would be x^2 + [ (1/sqrt(2))(x^2 - 3) ]^2. That way, we can work with the square of the distance to make it easier, find its minimum, and then take the square root at the end.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nD^2 = x^2 + [ (1/sqrt(2))(x^2 - 3) ]^2.\n\nNow, let's compute that. The square of (1/sqrt(2)) is 1/2, so that term becomes (1/2)(x^2 - 3)^2. So, D squared is x^2 + (1/2)(x^2 - 3)^2.\n\nExpanding that, (x^2 - 3)^2 is x^4 - 6x^2 + 9. Multiplying by 1/2, that becomes (1/2)x^4 - 3x^2 + 9/2.\n\nSo, adding the x^2 term from the first part, D squared becomes:\n\nx^2 + ("

Let's denote f(x) = (1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + 9/2.\n\nTo find the minimum, I can take the derivative of f with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.\n\nSo, f'(x) is the derivative:\n\nd/dx [ (1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + 9/2 ] = 2x^3 - 4x.\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n2x^3 - 4x = 0.\n\nFactor out 2x:\n\n2x(x^2 - 2) = 0.\n\nSo, the critical points are when 2x = 0 or x^2 - 2 = 0, which gives x = 0 or x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2).\n\nNow, since we're dealing with distance, the origin is at (0,0), and the function y is (1/sqrt(2))(x^2 - 3). Let's consider the possible x values where the point on the graph is.\n\nBut let me think, x can be any real number, but we're looking for the minimum distance. So, let's evaluate f(x) at these critical points.\n\nFirst, at x = 0:\n\nf(0) = (1/2)(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + 9/2 = 0 - 0 + 9/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo D squared is 9/2, so D is sqrt(9/2) = 3/sqrt(2). But let's see if this is a minimum or a maximum.\n\nThen, at x = sqrt(2):\n\nf(sqrt(2)) = (1/2)(sqrt(2))^4 - 2(sqrt(2))^2 + 9/2.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(sqrt(2))^4 is (2)^2 = 4. So ("

Wait sqrt(5/2). Hmm, sqrt(5/2) is equal to sqrt(10)/2, because sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2. Because sqrt(a/b) = sqrt(ab)/b.\n\nWait, let me confirm that: sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = (sqrt(5)*sqrt(2))/ (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) = sqrt(10)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, D = sqrt(10)/2. Therefore, in the expression sqrt(a)/b, a is 10 and b is 2. Now, we have to make sure that a is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one.\n\n10 factors into 2 * 5, neither of which is a square greater than one, so 10 is square-free. So, a = 10, b = 2, so a + b is 12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my work. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with D squared:\n\nD^2 = x^2 + y^2. Since y = (1/sqrt(2))(x^2 - 3), y^2 = (1/"

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using calculus or geometry.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is a parabola scaled and shifted, the point on the parabola closest to the origin can be found using the formula for the distance from a point to a parabola, but that might not be necessary here.\n\nWait, but is there another way? Maybe completing the square.\n\nWait, f(x) is D squared, which is (1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + 9/2.\n\nLet me write this as f(x) = (1/2)(x^4 - 4x^2) + 9/2.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.

Here, a = 1/2, b = -2.\n\nSo, t = -(-2)/(2*(1/2)) = 2 / 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimum occurs at t = 2, so x^2 = 2 → x = sqrt(2) or -sqrt(2), which matches the critical points found earlier.\n\nThen, plugging back t = 2 into f(t):\n\nf(2) = (1/2)(4) - 2*(2) + 9/2 = 2 - 4 + 4.5 = (2 - 4) is -2, plus 4.5 is 2.5, which is 5/2. So same result.\n\nTherefore, that's consistent. So, the minimal distance squared is 5/2, so sqrt(5/2) is the minimal distance, which is sqrt(10)/2. So, a is 10, b is 2, so 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nHmm, so I think that's correct.

Wait, let me confirm that again.\n\nOriginal f(x) = (1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + 9/2.\n\nThe derivative of (1/2)x^4 is 2x^3, right? Because (1/2)*4x^3 = 2x^3.\n\nThen, derivative of -2x^2 is -4x, and derivative of 9/2 is 0. So yes, f'(x) = 2x^3 -4x. Correct.\n\nSetting to zero gives 2x^3 -4x =0, so 2x(x^2 -2)=0, so x=0 or x= sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nSo, the critical points are"
