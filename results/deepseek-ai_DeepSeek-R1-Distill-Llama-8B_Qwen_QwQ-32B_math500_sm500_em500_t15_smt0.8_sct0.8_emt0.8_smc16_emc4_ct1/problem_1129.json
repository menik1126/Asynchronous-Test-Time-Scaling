Then, it takes 90 seconds to travel the length of the hallway. I have to find out how many meters long the hallway is.\n\nI should start by determining the robot's speed. Since speed is equal to distance divided by time, I can calculate the speed in kilometers per hour. Using the given information, the robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n\nNext, I'll convert the time taken to travel the hallway from seconds to hours to keep the units consistent. 90 seconds is equal to 1.5 minutes, and since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 90 seconds is 0.015 hours.\n\nNow, I can find the speed by dividing the distance of the hallway by the time taken. If the hallway is 'd' kilometers long and it takes 0.015 hours to travel, then the speed is d / 0.015 kilometers per hour.\n\nSince the robot's speed is constant, this speed should be the same as the one calculated from the initial information. Therefore, I can set up the equation 1 / 2.5 = d / 0.015.\n\nFinally, I'll solve for 'd' by cross-multiplying. This will give me the length of the hallway in kilometers. To convert it to meters, I'll multiply by 1000.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of the hallway, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the robot's speed.**\n   \n   The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. Therefore, its speed is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1\\ \\text{km}}{2.5\\ \\text{hours}} = 0.4\\ \\text{km/h}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the hallway time to hours.**\n   \n   The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 3600 seconds in an hour:\n   \\[\n   90\\ \\text{seconds} \\div 60 = 1.5\\ \\text{minutes}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1.5\\ \\text{minutes} \\div 60"
