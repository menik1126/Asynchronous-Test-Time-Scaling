            "output": "First, I need to determine the robot's speed based on the information provided. The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. \n\nTo find the speed in meters per second, I'll convert the distance from kilometers to meters and the time from hours to seconds.\n\nSince 1 kilometer is 1000 meters and 2.5 hours is 2.5 × 3600 seconds, the speed is 1000 meters divided by 2.5 × 3600 seconds, which equals 0.444... meters per second.\n\nNow, I'll use this speed to calculate the length of the hallway. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway's length at a speed of 0.444... meters per second. \n\nMultiplying the speed by the time will give the hallway's length: 0.444... meters/second × 90 seconds equals 40 meters.\n\nTherefore, the hallway is 40 meters long.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of the hallway, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Robot's Speed:**\n   \n   The robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1\\,\\text{km}}{2.5\\,\\text{hours}} = \\frac{1000\\,\\text{meters}}{2.5 \\times 3600\\,\\text{seconds}} = 0.444\\,\\text{m/s}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Length of the Hallway:**\n   \n   The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway at the same speed.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Length of Hallway} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 0.444\\,\\text{m/s} \\times 90\\,\\text{seconds} = 40\\,\\text{meters}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]"
