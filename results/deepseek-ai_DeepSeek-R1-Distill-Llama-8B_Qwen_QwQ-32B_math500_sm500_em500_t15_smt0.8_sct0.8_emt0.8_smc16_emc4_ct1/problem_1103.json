It's defined recursively, which can sometimes be a bit tricky, but let's take it step by step. \n\nFirst, let me understand the function f(i, j). It's defined for non-negative integers i and j, where j is between 0 and 4 inclusive. The function has three cases:\n\n1. If i is 0 and j is between 0 and 4, then f(0, j) is just the modulus of (j + 1) with 5. So that's straightforward. For example, f(0,0) would be 1, f(0,1) would be 2, and so on up to f(0,4) which is 5 mod 5 = 0.\n\n2. If i is greater than or equal to 1 and j is 0, then f(i, 0) is equal to f(i - 1, 1). So this is like reducing the problem one step back in i and increasing j by 1.\n\n3. If i is greater than or equal to 1 and j is between 1 and 4, then f(i, j) is equal to f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). This seems complicated because it's referring back to f(i, j - 1), which itself is another recursive call.\n\nAlright, I need to compute f(2015, 2). Hmm, 2015 is a large number, so I don't think I can compute this directly. Maybe there's a pattern or cycle that repeats every certain number of steps, so that I can find a periodicity and use it to compute f(2015, 2) without going through all the steps.\n\nLet me start by computing some small values of f(i, j) to see if I can spot a pattern. Maybe that will help.\n\nStarting with i=0:\n\nf(0,0) = mod5(0 + 1) = 1\nf(0,1) = mod5(1 + 1) = 2\nf(0,2) = mod5(2 + 1) = 3\nf(0,3) = mod5(3 + 1) = 4\nf(0,4) = mod5"

Because sometimes in recursion, the functions can cycle in different ways, but in this case, the fact that f(5, j)=1 seems to propagate onwards because every time you have to refer back to f(i-1, something)=1, and since f(i-1, something)=1, it's just 1.\n\nWait, but let me think of another approach. Maybe this function is related to the Ackermann function, which is known for producing rapid growth. However, in this case, the function f is defined in a way that for i >=5, it stabilizes to 1. That's a bit surprising, but given the recursive steps, perhaps that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that for i >=5, f(i, j)=1 for all j, so f(i,j) doesn't depend on j anymore.
