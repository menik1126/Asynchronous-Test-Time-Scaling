Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the function f is defined for non-negative integers i and j, where j can be from 0 to 4. The function has three cases:\n\n1. When i = 0 and j is between 0 and 4, f(0, j) is just mod5(j + 1). Since mod5(n) gives the remainder when n is divided by 5, this means f(0, j) will cycle through 1, 2, 3, 4, 0 for j = 0 to 4 respectively.\n\n2. If i is at least 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) is f(i - 1, 1). So, this is a recursive call where we reduce j by 1 (but since j was 0, it's now 1 in the next step).\n\n3. For i >= 1 and j between 1 and 4, f(i, j) is f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). Here, we're recursively computing f for the same i but smaller j, and then using that result as the new j in another call to f for i - 1.\n\nThis setup reminds me of the Ackermann function, which is known for being recursive and not primitive recursive. The Ackermann function is a classic example of a recursive function that grows very quickly, even for relatively small inputs. However, in this case, the function f is defined modulo 5, so perhaps the values cycle or repeat in some pattern.\n\nOur goal is to compute f(2015, 2). Let's try to find a pattern or some periodicity in the function f.\n\nLet me start by computing f(i, j) for small values of i and j, maybe this can reveal a pattern.\n\nStarting with i = 0:\n\n- f(0, 0) = mod5(0 + 1) = 1\n- f(0, 1) = mod5(1 + 1) = 2\n- f(0, 2) = mod5(2 + 1) = 3\n- f(0, 3) = mod5(3 + 1) = "

So the function's definition is such that for each i, j, it's defined recursively, and the key point is that once i=5, f(5,0)=1, then all j's for i=5 become 1, because for any j, you have to compute f(5, j) = f(4, f(5, j-1)). But for i=4, j=1, 2, 3, 4, you have f(4,1)=1, f(4,2)=3, etc., but wait, actually, for i=5, f(5, j) = f(4, f(5, j-1)). But when we compute f(5,1), it's f(4, f(5,0))=f(4,1)=1. Similarly, for f(5,2)=f(4, f(5,1))=f(4,1)=1 again. Similarly, all f(5,j) will use f(4,1)=1, so each step for i=5, j any value, will evaluate to 1.\n\nSimilarly, for i=6, f(6,0)=f(5,1)=1, and then for any j, f(6,j)=f(5, f(6,j-1))=f(5,1)=1, since j-1 will be 0,1,...,4, but f(6, j-1) will always be 1, because for i=6, all j's are 1. Thus, f(6,j) = f(5,1)=1. Therefore, yes, for any i>=5, f(i,j)=1.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( f(2015, 2) \\), we observe that for \\( i \\geq 5 \\), \\( f(i, j) = 1 \\) for all \\( j \\) from 0 to 4.
