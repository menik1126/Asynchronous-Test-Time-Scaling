Since the table is square, it has rotational symmetry, which means that configurations that can be rotated into each other are considered the same.\n\nNext, I'll consider fixing one person's position to eliminate the rotational duplicates. By fixing one person, I effectively reduce the problem to arranging the remaining 7 people around the table.\n\nNow, I need to account for reflections, which are configurations that are mirror images of each other. To handle this, I'll calculate the total number of distinct arrangements without considering reflections and then determine how many of these are unique when considering reflections.\n\nFinally, I'll apply the formula for circular permutations and adjust for reflections to find the final number of unique seating arrangements.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Symmetry of the Table:**\n   - A square table has rotational symmetry of order 4. This means that rotating the table by 90°, 180°, 270°, or 360° results in the same configuration.\n   - Additionally, the table has reflectional symmetry, meaning mirror images of seating arrangements are considered identical.\n\n2. **Fix One Person's Position:**\n   - To account for rotational symmetry, fix one person in a specific seat. This eliminates the rotational duplicates, leaving us with 7 people to arrange around the table.\n\n3. **Arrange the Remaining People:**\n   - With one person fixed, we have 7 seats left (since the table has 8 seats).\n   - Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the remaining 7 people is \\(7!\\) (which is 5040).\n\n4. **Account for Reflections:**\n   - Since the table can be reflected, each unique arrangement is counted twice in the \\(7!\\) calculation.\n   - To correct for this, divide the total number of arrangements by 2: \\( \\frac{7!}{2} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Number of Arrangements:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7!}{2} = \\frac{5040}{2} = 2520\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{2520}\\)"
