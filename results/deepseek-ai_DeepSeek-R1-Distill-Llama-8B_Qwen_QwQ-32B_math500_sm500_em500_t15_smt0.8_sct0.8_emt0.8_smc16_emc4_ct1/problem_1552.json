And since rotations of the same arrangement are considered equivalent, I have to account for that to avoid overcounting. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, if there were no restrictions, like considering rotations as different arrangements, the number of ways to seat 8 people around a square table would be the same as seating them around a circular table. For circular permutations, the number of ways is (n-1)! because rotating the entire arrangement doesn't create a new permutation. So for 8 people, that would be 7! = 5040 ways. But wait, the problem specifies a square table, so maybe this isn't directly applicable. I need to clarify if the square adds any specific constraints.\n\nWait, the square has four sides, each needing 2 people. So each side will have exactly 2 people. Since it's a square, the arrangement is fixed in terms of the positions relative to each other; rotating the entire table would just shift the positions but not change the arrangement relative to the table's structure.\n\nSo, if I fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry, how does that affect the count? Let me see. If I fix one person at a specific seat, then the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. But wait, is that correct when dealing with a square table?\n\nWait, in a circular table, fixing one person gives (n-1)! arrangements, but in a square, perhaps fixing a position isn't the only approach because of the square's symmetry. Maybe I should think about it differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of distinct arrangements is less because some symmetries might make different arrangements equivalent even if we don't rotate the entire table. But in this problem, it's mentioned that two configurations are equivalent if one is a rotation of another. So, perhaps reflection isn't considered equivalent unless it's a rotation. So, perhaps I only need to fix the position to account for rotations, not reflections.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Two configurations are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of another.\" So reflections would be different because they can't be achieved by rotation. So, in that case, perhaps the approach is similar to circular permutations, where we fix one person's seat to eliminate rotational symmetry, thus giving (8-"

So maybe the structure of the square requires a different approach?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider the square's rotational symmetry. A square can be rotated by 90, 180, 270, or 360 degrees. Since rotating by 360 brings it back to the original position, so the rotational symmetries are of order 4. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements would be the total number of linear arrangements divided by the number of rotations, which is 4. Wait, but how does this apply here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is similar to arranging people around a circular table, but with the added structure of sides. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a square table with four sides, each with two seats. Let's label the seats as follows: each side has two seats, so there are 8 seats total. Let me imagine the square with positions labeled clockwise as follows: positions 1 and 2 on the first side, 3 and 4 on the next, 5 and 6, then 7 and 8. But since it's a table, rotating the entire table by 90 degrees would shift all the positions. So, if we consider rotations as equivalent, then the number of distinct arrangements is the total number of seating arrangements divided by the number of rotational symmetries (which is 4, since a square can be rotated 4 ways to map onto itself).\n\nTherefore, the total number of seating arrangements without considering rotation is 8! (since there are 8 seats). But since rotations are considered the same, we divide by 4. So the total would be 8! / 4. Let me check that.\n\nWait, but in circular tables, the formula is (n-1)! because fixing one person's position accounts for rotational symmetry. Here, maybe the same idea applies but with the square's rotational symmetry. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, if I fix one person's position to eliminate rotational symmetry, then the remaining 7 people can be arranged in 7! ways. But in this case, since the table is square, fixing a person's position would fix the orientation of the table. For example, if I fix person A at seat 1, then the rest can be"

So perhaps the number of rotational symmetries is not 8 but 4 because rotating the square by 90 degrees maps the table onto itself. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements would be the total number of seatings without considering rotation divided by 4.\n\nWait, but if I fix one person's seat, that's equivalent to accounting for the rotation. So, if I fix one person, the number of arrangements is 7!, as in circular permutations. So that would give 5040 as the answer. But I'm confused now because I'm getting conflicting intuitions.\n\nLet me consider a smaller example to test. Suppose instead of 8 people, we have 4 people around a square table, with 1 person per side. Then, without considering rotations, there would be 4! = 24 ways. But considering rotations as equivalent, since a square has 4 rotational symmetries, the number of distinct arrangements would be 24 / 4 = 6. But actually, for circular arrangements (n=4), the formula is (4-1)! = 6, which matches. So that would suggest that the formula (n-1)! applies even for square tables.\n\nSimilarly, for n=8, it would be 7! = 5040. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 5040.\n\nBut wait, in that 4-person example, the square's structure allows rotational symmetries that reduce the count by a factor of 4, but using the circular permutation approach (fixing one person) gives the same result. So perhaps both approaches are consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps in the problem, the number of distinct seating arrangements is 7! = 5040.\n\nWait, let me try to reason again. When considering rotations as equivalent, we can fix one person's seat to remove the rotational symmetry. Once fixed, the remaining 7 can be arranged in 7! ways. So yes, that would give 5040.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the number of rotations (4) and total arrangements (8!), then 8! /4 = 40320 /4 = 10080, which is higher. So which is correct?\n\nWait, no, that seems conflicting. The problem is whether the number of symmetries is"

So total arrangements without considering rotation is 4!.\n\nDivided by 4 gives 6, which matches (4-1)!.\n\nSo in the original problem, with 8 seats, the rotational symmetries are still 4 (since rotating by 90 degrees each time). So the number of rotational symmetries is 4, so the total arrangements would be 8! /4.\n\nWait, but in the 4-person example, that would be 4! /4 = 6, which is correct. So why does the circular permutation formula (n-1)! also give the same result?\n\nAh, because (n-1)! = 3! = 6, which is the same as 4!/4. So in general, for a circular table with n seats, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! because you divide by n rotational symmetries. So in that case, the formula is n! /n = (n-1)!.\n\nTherefore, applying that to the square table with 8 seats, the number of rotational symmetries is 4 (since rotating by 90 degrees four times brings you back). Wait, but the number of rotational symmetries for a square is indeed 4 (rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). So the group of rotations has order 4.

But the table has 8 seats arranged in 4 sides with 2 seats each. So, when you rotate the table by 90°, each side's seats are rotated to the next side. So, for example, seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 would be rotated to seats 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1, and so on. So each rotation by 90 degrees cycles the seats in a certain way.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is that the table has 4-fold symmetry, so the rotational group is of order 4. Therefore, the number of distinct seating arrangements, considering rotations as equivalent, is 8! divided by 4, which is 40320 /4 = 10080.\n\nBut wait, in the 4-person example, where we had 4 seats, a square, with 1 person per side, the total arrangements without considering rotation is 4! =24. Divided by 4 (the rotational symmetry) gives 6, which matches the circular permutation formula (n-1)! So that's consistent.\n\nWait, but why does the formula differ when we have more seats?\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the 4-person example, the number of rotational symmetries is 4, and 4! /4 = (4-1)! So in that case, the same formula applies.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 seats, number of rotational symmetries is 4, so total arrangements would be 8! /4.\n\nBut wait, that seems inconsistent with the circular permutation approach, where fixing one seat would give (n-1)! = 7! = 5040.\n\nWait, so what's the difference?\n\nAh, perhaps the key is whether the table's rotational symmetry group includes the same size as the number of seats or not. In a circular table, the size of the rotational symmetry group is equal to the number of seats, so you divide by n.

So the seats are arranged in a square, but each side has two seats. So the total number of seats is 8, but the table's symmetry is still square, so rotations by 90 degrees.\n\nWait, but when you rotate the table by 90 degrees, each seat moves to the position of the next side. Since each side has two seats, rotating 90 degrees would move each seat to the next side's position. So, for example, the first side's two seats become the second side's seats after rotation, etc.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry group is still of order 4, so dividing by 4 is correct.\n\nBut then why in the 4-person example with 1 per side, the formula works as (n-1)! where n is the number of seats? Wait, in that case, n=4, so (4-1)! =6, which is 4! /4 = 24/4=6. So that works.

Let me try that approach again.\n\nSuppose we fix one person in a specific seat. Since rotations are considered the same, we can fix one person's position. Let's say we fix person A at seat 1. Then, the remaining 7 people can be arranged in the remaining 7 seats. However, in a square table, fixing one seat's position effectively removes the rotational symmetry.

Since the table's symmetry is 4, but we've fixed one seat, perhaps the remaining symmetries are still in play.\n\nWait, no. Once we fix one seat, we eliminate rotational symmetry because rotating the table can't keep that seat fixed unless it's rotated by 0 degrees, so the only rotational symmetry left is the identity. Therefore, by fixing one seat, we're accounting for the rotational symmetries, so the number of distinct arrangements is (8-1)! =7! =5040.\n\nBut this conflicts with the previous approach where I considered dividing by 4. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rotational symmetries. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the 4-person example, with 1 person per side, fixing one seat would fix the position, and the rest 3 can be arranged in 3! ways, giving 6, which is correct. In that case, by fixing one seat, we don't consider rotations anymore, so 3! =6.\n\nSimilarly, in the problem with 8 seats, if we fix one seat, then the rest can be arranged in 7! ways, giving 5040.\n\nBut earlier, by considering the rotational symmetries as a group of order 4, I arrived at 8! /4 =10080.\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. I need to resolve which approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is whether the group of rotations is acting on the entire arrangement or not. In the 4-person case, the rotational group is of order 4, so dividing by 4 is correct. But in the 8-seat case, perhaps the group still has order 4, so dividing by 4 would be correct. However, when we fix a seat, we're effectively choosing a representative from each orbit, so the number of distinct arrangements is equal to the total number of arrangements divided by the size of the group, which is 4.\n\nWait, but in the 4-person example, fixing a seat gives (n-1)! =6, but the group size is 4, which is not equal to n.

If I fix one seat, say seat 1, then seat 2 must stay in its position relative to seat 1. But wait, in a rotation, seat 1 moves to seat 3's position, which is on a different side.

To be fixed under 180° rotation, seat1 must have the same person as seat3, and seat2 same as seat4. So you need to have seat1=A, seat3=A, but since all are distinct, that's impossible. Therefore, fixed arrangements under 180° are 0. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier result where dividing by 4 gives 6, which is correct.\n\nWait, so Burnside's lemma would give (24 +0 +0 +0)/4 =6, which is correct. Wait, but in this case, the rotation by 180° also has 0 fixed arrangements?\n\nWait, no, actually, if you have four people, the rotation by 180° swaps seat1 with seat3 and seat2 with seat4.
