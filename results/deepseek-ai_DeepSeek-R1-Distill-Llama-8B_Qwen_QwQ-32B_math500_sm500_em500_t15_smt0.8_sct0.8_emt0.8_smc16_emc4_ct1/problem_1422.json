            "output": "First, I need to calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h. Given the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, plugging these values into the formula gives V = π * (3)² * 8 = 72π cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. With a radius of 6 cm, the volume is V = (4/3)π * (6)³ = (4/3)π * 216 = 288π cubic centimeters.\n\nNow, to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, I'll divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker. That is, 288π / 72π = 4. Therefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to completely fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n   Given:\n   - Radius (\\(r\\)) = 3 cm\n   - Height (\\(h\\)) = 8 cm\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.**\n   \n   The formula for the volume of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Given:\n   - Radius (\\(R\\)) = 6 cm\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (216) = 288\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine how many beakers are needed to fill the tank"
