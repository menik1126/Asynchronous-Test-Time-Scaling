            "output": "First, I will determine the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Plugging in the given values, the volume of one beaker is π × 3² × 8 = 72π cm³.\n\nNext, I will calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πR³. With a radius of 6 cm, the volume is (4/3)π × 6³ = (4/3)π × 216 = 288π cm³.\n\nFinally, to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I will divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker: 288π / 72π = 4. So, it will take 4 beakers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{cylinder}} \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   \n   Given:\n   - Radius \\( r_{\\text{beaker}} = 3 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   - Height \\( h_{\\text{beaker}} = 8 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V_{\\text{sphere}} \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   \n   Given:\n   - Radius \\( R_{\\text{tank}} = 6 \\, \\text{cm} \\)\n   \n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\"
