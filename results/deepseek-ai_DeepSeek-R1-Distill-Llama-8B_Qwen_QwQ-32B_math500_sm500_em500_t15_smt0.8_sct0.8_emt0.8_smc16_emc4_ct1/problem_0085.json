Hmm, let me write that down to make sure I understand it.\n\nIt's like, ceil((3.6)^2) minus (ceil(3.6))^2. Okay, so first I need to compute (3.6)^2, take the ceiling of that result, then compute the ceiling of 3.6, square that, and subtract the two. \n\nLet me start by calculating (3.6)^2. I remember that squaring a number means multiplying it by itself. So 3.6 times 3.6. Let me do that step by step. 3 times 3 is 9, 3 times 0.6 is 1.8, 0.6 times 3 is another 1.8, and 0.6 times 0.6 is 0.36. So adding all those up: 9 + 1.8 + 1.8 + 0.36. Let me add 1.8 and 1.8 first, that's 3.6. Then 9 plus 3.6 is 12.6. Then add 0.36 to get 12.96. So (3.6)^2 is 12.96. \n\nNow, I need to take the ceiling of 12.96. The ceiling function, if I recall correctly, rounds a number up to the nearest integer. So since 12.96 is already just a bit less than 13, the ceiling would be 13. Because even though 12.96 is close to 13, anything above 12 but less than 13 would still have a ceiling of 13. So ceil(12.96) is 13.\n\nNext, I need to compute the ceiling of 3.6. Again, the ceiling function rounds a number up to the nearest integer. So 3.6 is between 3 and 4. Since it's less than 4, the ceiling would round it up to 4. So ceil(3.6) is 4.\n\nNow, I need to square that ceiling value. So that's 4 squared, which is 16. \n\nPutting it all together: ceil((3.6)^2) is 13, and (ceil("

            "output": "3.6))^2 is 16. So 13 minus 16 is... hmm, that would be -3. \n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. Maybe I should double-check my calculations.\n\nCalculating (3.6)^2 again: 3.6 times 3.6 is indeed 12.96. Ceiling of that is definitely 13. And 3.6's ceiling is 4, squared is 16. 13 minus 16 is negative 3. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by looking at the difference between the ceiling of a square and the square of the ceiling. I wonder if there's a general formula or property for that. Hmm, but for now, the way I did it seems straightforward.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations. 3.6 squared is 12.96, ceiling is 13. Ceiling of 3.6 is 4, square is 16. 13 minus 16 is -3. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe value of the expression is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Compute \\( (3.6)^2 \\): \\( 3.6 \\times 3.6 = 12.96 \\).\n2. Take the ceiling of 12.96: \\( \\lceil 12.96 \\rceil = 13 \\).\n3. Compute the ceiling of 3.6: \\( \\lceil 3.6 \\rceil = 4 \\).\n4. Square the result from step 3: \\( 4^2 = 16 \\).\n5. Subtract the results from steps 2 and 4: \\( 13 - 16 = -3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{-3}\\)."
