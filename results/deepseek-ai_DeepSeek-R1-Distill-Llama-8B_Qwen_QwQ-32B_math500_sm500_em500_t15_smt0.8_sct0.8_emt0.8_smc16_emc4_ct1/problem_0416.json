These roots are given in pairs as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\) and so on up to \\(r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\). I need to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r}_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r}_2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r}_5}\\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some concepts. When dealing with polynomial equations with complex roots, especially when roots come in conjugate pairs, it's often useful to use Vieta's formulas or properties related to complex conjugates. Also, since the equation is a sum of two 10th powers, maybe I can factor it or simplify it somehow.\n\nFirst, let's note that for any complex number \\(r\\), the product \\(r\\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real, non-negative number. So each term in the sum I'm interested in is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\).\n\nGiven that, I can rewrite the sum as \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{|r_i|^2}\\). So, if I can find the magnitudes of each root \\(r_i\\), or perhaps find a way to express this sum in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial, that would solve the problem.\n\nI also remember that for a polynomial, the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the magnitudes of the roots can be related to the coefficients, but I'm not exactly sure of the formula. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the original equation to express it in terms of \\(y = x^{10}\\), but I don't know if that's helpful.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me denote \\(y = 13x - 1\\). Then, the equation becomes \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\), where \\(y = 13x - 1\\). So, \\("

The solutions for \\(\\omega\\) would be \\(e^{i\\pi(2k+1)/10}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., 9\\). Wait, actually, since \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), then \\(\\omega^{20} = 1\\), so they are 20th roots of unity, but only the ones where the exponent is an odd multiple of \\(\\pi\\). Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of roots of unity here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substituting \\(y = 13x -1\\) into the equation \\(x^{10} + y^{10} = 0\\) gives me a way to express \\(x\\) in terms of roots of unity. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set \\(y = \\omega x\\), where \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\).

Since \\(\\omega\\) is a 20th root of unity (since \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), so \\(\\omega^{20} = 1\\)), there are 10 such roots (since the equation \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\) has 10 distinct solutions).

Let me think. For the equation \\(\\omega_i^{10} = -1\\), which is a real number, so the complex roots come in conjugate pairs. So, if \\(\\omega_i\\) is a root, then its conjugate \\(\\overline{\\omega_i}\\) is also a root. Moreover, if \\(\\omega_i\\) is on the unit circle, then \\(|\\omega_i| = 1\\), so \\(\\overline{\\omega_i} = \\omega_i^{-1}\\). Is that the case here?\n\nWait, if \\(\\omega_i^{10} = -1\\), then \\(|\\omega_i|^{10} = | -1 | = 1\\), so \\(|\\omega_i| = 1\\). Therefore, all \\(\\omega_i\\) lie on the unit circle, so indeed \\(\\overline{\\omega_i} = \\omega_i^{-1}\\).\n\nTherefore, the denominator simplifies to:\n\n\\(|\\omega_i|^2 -13\\omega_i -13\\overline{\\omega_i} + 169 ="

Since the roots of the original equation are paired as \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r_i}\\), which correspond to \\(\\omega_i\\) and \\(\\overline{\\omega_i}\\). But when I consider the conjugate pair \\(r_i, \\overline{r_i}\\), their terms in the sum \\(\\frac{1}{|r_i|^2} + \\frac{1}{|\\overline{r_i}|^2} \\) would be equal because \\(|r_i|^2 = |\\overline{r_i}|^2\\), so each pair contributes twice the same value.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating cyclotomic polynomials. The equation \\(\\omega^{20}=1\\) has 20 roots, which are divided into different cyclotomic polynomials. The primitive 20th roots are given by \\(\\Phi_{20}(x) = x^8 -x^6 + x^4 -x^2 +1\\), which has 8 roots. But our equation is \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\), which is a degree 10 equation.

No, that's not correct because 10 is less than 20.\n\nWait, no, 20th roots of unity can be classified into their orders.

No, because if \\(\\omega^{10}= -1\\), then \\(\\omega^{20}=1\\), so they must be primitive 20th roots. Wait, but \u03c6(20) is 8, so perhaps 10 is not the number of primitive 20th roots. Therefore, I must have made an error in understanding the roots.\n\nWait, let me compute again. The equation \\(\\omega^{10} = -1\\) is a polynomial equation of degree 10, so it should have 10 roots.
