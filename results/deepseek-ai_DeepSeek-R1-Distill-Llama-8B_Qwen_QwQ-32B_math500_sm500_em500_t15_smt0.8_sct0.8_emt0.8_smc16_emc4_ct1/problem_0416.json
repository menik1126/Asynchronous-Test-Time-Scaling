It's a polynomial equation of degree 10, so it has 10 roots (counting multiplicity). The roots are given as \\(r_1, \\overline{r}_1, r_2, \\overline{r}_2, \\ldots, r_5, \\overline{r}_5\\), which makes sense because non-real roots come in complex conjugate pairs. \n\nThe question asks me to find the sum \\(\\frac{1}{r_1\\overline{r_1}} + \\frac{1}{r_2\\overline{r_2}} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{r_5\\overline{r_5}}\\). Each term here is the reciprocal of the product of a root and its complex conjugate. I remember that for complex numbers, the product \\(r \\overline{r}\\) is equal to \\(|r|^2\\), which is a real number. So each term is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\), which is also real.\n\nSince the equation is of degree 10, there are 10 roots. Each \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r_i}\\) will correspond to two roots. So, essentially, I have 5 pairs of complex conjugate roots. Therefore, I need to compute the sum \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{r_i \\overline{r_i}} \\).\n\nI think this can be related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Specifically, Vieta's formulas relate the sums and products of roots to the coefficients. But I'm not exactly sure how to apply Vieta here because each term is \\(1/(r_i \\overline{r_i})\\), which is \\(1/|r_i|^2\\). Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the equation in terms of substitution. Let me let \\(y = x\\). Then the equation becomes \\(y^{10} + (13y - 1)^{10} = 0\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps immediately.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the equation differently. Let's rearrange it: \\(x^{10} = -"

Let me write that as:\n\n\\(x = -\\omega (13x - 1)\\)\n\nLet me solve for x here.

Since each pair consists of \\(r_i\\) and \\(\\overline{r_i}\\), but since the roots come in conjugate pairs, perhaps each term in the sum corresponds to a pair? Wait, actually, the question is written as 5 terms, each being \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j})\\), so each term is for a single root and its conjugate.

Because if \\(\\omega\\) is a 10th root of unity, then \\(\\overline{\\omega}\\) is also a root. So perhaps each pair \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\overline{\\omega}\\) leads to roots \\(r_j\\) and \\(\\overline{r_j}\\), and each contributes the same term \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j})\\). But since \\(r_j\\) and \\(\\overline{r_j}\\) would be different, but their products would be the same? Wait, no, \\(r_j \\overline{r_j}\\) is |r_j|^2, which is the same for r_j and its conjugate. So each pair contributes the same term? But in the problem, each term is for a single r_j and its conjugate.

Wait, no, because for the sum, we have 5 terms, each being 1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}), so for each pair, we have one term. Therefore, the sum is the sum of |1 + 13ω|² over all the 10th roots of unity ω, but considering that for each conjugate pair, we only take one term. Wait, this might not be correct because the equation's roots are all 10th roots of unity solutions, but are the ω's in the substitution covering all 10 roots? Wait, no, the substitution gives all 10 roots because each ω gives a distinct x. But the problem states that roots come in 5 conjugate pairs, each pair contributing one term. So in total, the sum is summing 5 terms, each corresponding to one pair.\n\nBut perhaps for each pair (ω, \\(\\overline{\\omega}\\)), the term \\( |1 + 13\\omega|^2 \\) is same as \\( |1 + 13\\overline{\\omega}|^2 \\).

Therefore, if I sum this over all 10 roots, I would get 2 times the sum over the 5 unique pairs. Therefore, the sum we need, which is the sum over 5 terms, is equal to half of the sum over all 10 roots. But actually, no, because each term is distinct. Let's think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. Each pair (ω, \\(\\overline{\\omega}\\)) corresponds to two roots, but each of these roots contributes the same term \\(1/(r_j \\overline{r_j}) = |1 +13\\omega|²\\). So, each pair contributes twice the same term to the sum. But in the problem, we have 5 such pairs, each contributing one term. Wait, no, the problem is written as 10 roots, grouped into 5 pairs, each pair contributing one term to the sum.\n\nWait, if each pair contributes one term, then the sum is simply the sum of |1 +13ω|² over the 5 distinct pairs, but this is not necessarily correct because each pair is counted once.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is equal to the sum over all 10 roots, divided by 2, because each term in the original sum (the 10 roots) is |1 + 13ω|², but each pair contributes the same term, so if I sum over all 10 roots, each term in the pair is same, so the total sum would be 2 times the desired sum, which is 5 terms.
