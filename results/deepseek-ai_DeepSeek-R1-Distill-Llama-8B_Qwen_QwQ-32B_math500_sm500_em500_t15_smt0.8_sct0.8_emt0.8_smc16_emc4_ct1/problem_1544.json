Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember from my classes that optimization problems with constraints often use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but I'm not too sure how that applies here. Maybe there's another way since all variables are positive and we're dealing with a product, perhaps the AM-GM inequality can be useful. Yeah, AM-GM is usually helpful for products and sums.\n\nLet me recall the AM-GM inequality. For non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Specifically, for positive real numbers \\( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n}\n\\]\n\nAnd equality holds when all the numbers are equal. So, how can I apply this here? Well, in the problem, I have four variables \\( a, b, c, d \\) and their sum is 10. I need to maximize \\( ab^2c^3d^4 \\). \n\nHmm, the exponents in the product complicate things a bit. The variables aren't all raised to the first power, so I can't directly apply AM-GM as I remember it. Maybe I need to adjust the weights or something. Wait, there's a weighted AM-GM inequality, right? Let me try to remember how that works.\n\nThe weighted AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers and positive weights that sum to 1, the weighted arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the weighted geometric mean. More precisely, if \\( w_1, w_2, ..., w_n \\) are weights such that \\( w_1 + w_2 + ... + w_n = 1 \\), then:\n\n\\[\nw_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + ... + w_n x_n \\geq x_1^{w_1} x_2^{w_2} \\cdots x_n^{w_n}\n\\]\n\nSo, perhaps I can assign weights based on"

Since the product is \\( ab^2c^3d^4 \\), maybe I should distribute weights accordingly.\n\nWait, actually, in the AM-GM inequality, the exponents in the product correspond to the weights in the weighted AM-GM. So, each variable contributes its exponent to the total weight. So, for example, \\( b \\) has an exponent of 2, which could correspond to a weight of \\( \\frac{2}{1+2+3+4} \\) or something like that. Let me work this out.\n\nThe total of the exponents is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. So, if I take the weights as \\( \\frac{1}{10}, \\frac{2}{10}, \\frac{3}{10}, \\frac{4}{10} \\) respectively, that might work. So, each weight corresponds to the exponent of each variable. Then, the weighted AM-GM inequality would state that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10} \\cdot a + \\frac{2}{10} \\cdot b + \\frac{3}{10} \\cdot c + \\frac{4}{10} \\cdot d \\geq a^{1/10} b^{2/10} c^{3/10} d^{4/10}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, that doesn't quite seem right. Because in the weighted AM-GM, the weights should be fractions such that their sum is 1, which they are here: \\( \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{2}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{4}{10} = 1 \\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the left side of the inequality is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{10}a + \\frac{2}{10}b + \\frac{3}{10}c + \\frac{4}{10}d\n\\]\n\nAnd the right side is:\n\n\\[\na^{1/10} b^{2/10} c^{3/10} d^{4/10}\n\\]\n\nBut I need to relate this to the"
