This simplifies the problem to calculating (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) mod 7.\n\nCalculating each term:\n- 2 + 2 = 4\n- 2 + 4 = 6\n- 2 + 6 = 8\n\nSo the expression becomes 4 × 6 × 8.\n\nNext, I'll compute the product step by step:\n- 4 × 6 = 24\n- 24 × 8 = 192\n\nNow, I need to find 192 mod 7. Dividing 192 by 7 gives 27 with a remainder. 27 × 7 = 189, so the remainder is 192 - 189 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7 is 3.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**  \n\\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\n**We need to find:**  \nThe remainder when \\( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \\) is divided by 7.\n\n**Step 1:** Substitute \\( n \\) with 2 (since \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\)).  \nThe expression becomes:\n\\[\n(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6)\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Calculate each term inside the parentheses.  \n\\[\n(2 + 2) = 4 \\\\\n(2 + 4) = 6 \\\\\n(2 + 6) = 8\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Multiply the results.  \n\\[\n4 \\times 6 = 24 \\\\\n24 \\times 8 = 192\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Find \\( 192 \\mod 7 \\).  \nDivide 192 by 7:\n\\[\n192 \\div 7 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\n192 \\equiv"
