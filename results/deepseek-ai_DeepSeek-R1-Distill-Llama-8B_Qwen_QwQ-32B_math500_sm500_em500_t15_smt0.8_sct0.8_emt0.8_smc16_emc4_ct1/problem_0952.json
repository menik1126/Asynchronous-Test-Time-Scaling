So, the numerator becomes 40r⁹.\n\nThen, I'll divide by the denominator, which is 8r⁴. Dividing 40 by 8 gives me 5, and r⁹ divided by r⁴ is r⁵.\n\nCombining these results, the simplified expression is 5r⁵.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators:**\n   \\[\n   (10r^3)(4r^6) = 10 \\times 4 \\times r^{3+6} = 40r^9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{40r^9}{8r^4} = \\frac{40}{8} \\times \\frac{r^9}{r^4} = 5r^{9-4} = 5r^5\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5r^5}\n\\]"
