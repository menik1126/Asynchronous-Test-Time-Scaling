This means that 1 Drinket is worth 3/7 of a Blinket.\n\nNext, since 1 Trinket equals 4 Blinkets, I can find out how many Blinkets are equivalent to 56 Drinkets by multiplying 56 by 3/7. This gives me 24 Blinkets.\n\nFinally, I'll convert the 24 Blinkets to Trinkets by dividing by 4, resulting in 6 Trinkets.\n\nTherefore, 56 Drinkets are equal to 6 Trinkets.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of 56 Drinkets in Trinkets, let's follow the conversion steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Relationships:**\n   - **1 Trinket (T) = 4 Blinkets (B)**  \n     This means that 1 Trinket is equal to 4 Blinkets.\n   \n   - **3 Blinkets (B) = 7 Drinkets (D)**  \n     This means that 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets.\n\n2. **Express Drinkets in Terms of Blinkets:**\n   - From the second relationship:\n     \\[\n     3\\,\\text{B} = 7\\,\\text{D} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 1\\,\\text{D} = \\frac{3}{7}\\,\\text{B}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, 56 Drinkets equal:\n     \\[\n     56\\,\\text{D} = 56 \\times \\frac{3}{7}\\,\\text{B} = 24\\,\\text{B}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert Blinkets to Trinkets:**\n   - From the first relationship:\n     \\[\n     1\\,\\text{T} = 4\\,\\text{B} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 1\\,\\text{B} = \\frac{1}{4}\\,\\text{T}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, 24 Blinkets equal:\n     \\[\n     24\\,\\text{B} = 24 \\times \\frac{1}{4}\\,\\text{T} = 6\\,\\text{T}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final"
