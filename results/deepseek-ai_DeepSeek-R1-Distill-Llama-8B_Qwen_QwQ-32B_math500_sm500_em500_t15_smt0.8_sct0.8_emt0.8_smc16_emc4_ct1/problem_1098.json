Let me try to understand the function step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the function definition:\n\nFor i and j where i is a non-negative integer and j is between 0 and 4, inclusive, f(i, j) is defined recursively.\n\nCase 1: If i = 0 and 0 \u2264 j \u2264 4, then f(0, j) = mod_5(j + 1). So that's just taking j, adding 1, and then taking the remainder when divided by 5. So for j=0, f(0,0)=1; j=1, f(0,1)=2; j=2, f(0,2)=3; j=3, f(0,3)=4; j=4, f(0,4)=0 (because 4+1=5, which mod 5 is 0).\n\nCase 2: If i \u2265 1 and j = 0, then f(i, 0) = f(i - 1, 1). So for any i \u2265 1, when j is 0, we need to look at f(i - 1, 1).\n\nCase 3: If i \u2265 1 and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 4, then f(i, j) = f(i - 1, f(i, j - 1)). That seems a bit more complicated, since f(i, j) depends on f(i, j - 1), which in turn depends on i - 1 and some other value.\n\nThe goal is to find f(2015, 2). That's a pretty large i and a small j. Since both i and j can be quite large, recursing directly is not feasible. So I need to find a pattern or some periodicity in the function f(i, j) that can allow me to compute it without going through all the recursive steps.\n\nLet me try to compute some small values of f(i, j) to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst, let's build a table for small i and j. Let's start with i from 0 to, say, 5, and j from 0 to 4.\n\nFor i = 0:\n- f(0, 0) = "
