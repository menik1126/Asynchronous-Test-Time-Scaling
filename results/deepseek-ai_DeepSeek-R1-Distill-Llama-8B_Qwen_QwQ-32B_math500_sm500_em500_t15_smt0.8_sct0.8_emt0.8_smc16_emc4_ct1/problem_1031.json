            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem to solve: I need to factor the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) into a product of monic polynomials with integer coefficients, each of which can't be factored further over the integers. Then, I have to compute the sum of these polynomials evaluated at \\(x = 1\\).\n\nFirst, let me write down the polynomial clearly:\n\\[x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\]\n\nI notice that it's a degree 8 polynomial with leading coefficient 1, which is monic. The constant term is -4, which is interesting because it might factor into smaller polynomials.\n\nSince it's a quartic in terms of \\(x^4\\), maybe I can make a substitution to make it look simpler. Let me set \\(y = x^4\\), so the equation becomes:\n\\[y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0\\]\n\nHmm, if I solve this quadratic equation for \\(y\\), maybe I can factor the original polynomial. Let me try solving for \\(y\\):\n\\[y = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2}\\]\n\nSo, \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = -2\\). That means \\(x^4 = 1\\) or \\(x^4 = -2\\). Now, let's consider each case.\n\nFor \\(x^4 = 1\\), the real solutions are \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -1\\), but over the integers, these are the only solutions. However, since we are factoring over the integers, we might need to consider complex factors, but since the problem specifies integer coefficients, we can't use complex roots directly. Instead, maybe we can factor it into quadratics or higher-degree polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\nFor \\(x^4 = -2\\), this would give complex roots, but again, we need to factor into polynomials with integer coefficients, so perhaps we can use the fact that \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) can be expressed as a product of two quadratics or something similar.\n\nWait, maybe the polynomial can be factored as a product of two quartic polynomials. Let me try to factor it that way.\n\nLet me suppose:\n\\[("

            "output": "x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)(x^4 + ex^3 + fx^2 + gx + h)\\]\n\nMultiplying these out, the leading term is \\(x^8\\), so that's good. The next term would be \\( (a + e)x^7 \\). Since the original polynomial has no \\(x^7\\) term, \\(a + e = 0\\). Let me set \\(e = -a\\).\n\nSimilarly, the \\(x^6\\) term would be \\( (ae + b + f)x^6 \\). Since there's no \\(x^6\\) term, this must be zero. Since \\(e = -a\\), then \\(a(-a) + b + f = -a^2 + b + f = 0\\). Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the polynomial is palindromic? Let me check. A palindromic polynomial has coefficients that read the same forwards and backwards. The given polynomial is \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4\\). The coefficients are 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, -4. Reversed, it would be -4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1. Not the same, so not palindromic. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a biquadratic, so substituting \\(y = x^4\\) gives a quadratic in y, which factors as (y - 1)(y + 4), since 1 * (-4) = -4 and 1 + (-4) = -3? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the quadratic equation was \\(y^2 + 3y -4 = 0\\), so factoring that, we need two numbers that multiply to -4 and add to 3. Let's see: 4 and -1? 4 * (-1) = -4, and 4 + (-1) = 3. Yes! So, the quadratic factors as (y + 4)(y - 1). Therefore, substituting back \\(y = x^4\\), we have:\n\n\\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4 = (x^"

            "model": "small",
            "output": "4 + 4)(x^4 - 1)\\)\n\nSo now, I have it factored into two quartic polynomials. But the problem says to factor into monic polynomials with integer coefficients, each of which cannot be factored further. So I need to check if \\(x^4 + 4\\) and \\(x^4 - 1\\) can be further factored.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\), this is a difference of squares: \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2)^2 - 1^2 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Further, \\(x^2 -1\\) factors into (x -1)(x +1). So:\n\n\\(x^4 -1 = (x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1)\\)\n\nNow, checking if these can be factored further: (x -1) and (x +1) are linear and can't be factored. \\(x^2 +1\\) can't be factored over integers because it has complex roots. So \\(x^4 -1\\) factors into four linear terms, but since over integers, the irreducible factors are (x -1), (x +1), and (x^2 +1).\n\nNow, what about \\(x^4 +4\\)? Hmm, perhaps it can be factored further. Let me think.\n\nI remember that \\(x^4 +4\\) can be factored as a sum of squares, but over integers, it factors into two quadratics. Let me recall the identity:\n\n\\(x^4 +4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\)\n\nYes, that's correct because multiplying them out:\n\n\\[(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^4 - (2x)^2 + (2x)(2) + (x^2)(2) + ... Wait, maybe it's better to multiply it step by step.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n\\[(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, \\(x^2 * x^2 = x^4\\)\n\nThen, \\(x^2 * (-2"

So \\(x^4 +4 = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)\\). Both of these quadratics have discriminant \\(4 -8 = -4\\), so they can't be factored further over integers.\n\nSo now, putting it all together, the original polynomial factors as:\n\n\\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4 = (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1) = (x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1)\\)\n\nWait, hold on, is that all? Let me check. Originally, it was:\n\n\\(x^8 +3x^4 -4 = (x^4 +4)(x^4 -1)\\), and then \\(x^4 -1\\) factors into (x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1). So together, the full factorization is:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 +2x +2)(x^2 -2x +2)(x -1)(x +1)(x^2 +1)\n\\]\n\nEach of these factors is monic with integer coefficients, and"

For example, is (x^2 +1) further factorable over integers? No, because it has no real roots, so it can't be factored into linear terms with integer coefficients.\n\nSimilarly, the other quadratics have discriminant negative, so they can't be factored further.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 5 +1 +0 +2 +2 =10.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my substitution step.\n\nOriginal polynomial: \\(x^8 +3x^4 -4\\). After substitution y =x^4, it's y^2 +3y -4, which factors into (y+4)(y-1). So yes, that gives (x^4 +"

So all factors are accounted for.\n\nTherefore, the factors are indeed the five polynomials listed. Their evaluations at 1 are as above. Adding them up gives 5+1+0+2+2=10.\n\nHmm, but let me check if I made a mistake in evaluating (x-1) at 1. That's 0, which is correct. But the problem says \"non-constant polynomial\". Wait, the problem states \"each non-constant polynomial p_i(x) is monic with integer coefficients, and cannot be factored further over the integers.\"\n\nSo all the factors are non-constant except maybe constants? But since they are monic, the constant term is 1 or -1? Wait, no, monic just means leading coefficient 1, but the constant term can be anything. However, in the factorization, the constants would have to multiply to the original constant term, which is -4. Let me check the constants of each factor:\n\n(x^2 +2x +2): constant term 2\n\n(x^2 -2x +2): constant term 2\n\n(x -1): constant term -1\n\n(x +1): constant term 1\n\n(x^2 +1): constant term 1\n\nMultiplying all constants: 2 * 2 * (-1) *1 *1 = -4, which matches the original constant term. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the factorization is correct. The sum is indeed 5 +1 +0 +2 +2 =10.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem says \"each non-constant polynomial\". Wait, all the factors here are non-constant except if there is a constant factor. But since the original polynomial is monic, and all factors are monic, the only way to have a constant factor is if it's 1, but since the product of the constants is -4, which is not 1, so the factors must include all the necessary constants. Therefore, all the factors listed are non-constant except perhaps if there was a -1, but since they are monic,"
