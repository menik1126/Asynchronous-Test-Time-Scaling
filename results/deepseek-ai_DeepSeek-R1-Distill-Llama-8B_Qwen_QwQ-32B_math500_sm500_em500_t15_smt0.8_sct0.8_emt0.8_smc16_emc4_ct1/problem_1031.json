            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to factor the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) into a product of monic, irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients. Then, after factoring it completely, I need to compute the sum of all these factors evaluated at \\(x=1\\). Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, looking at the polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\), it seems like a quartic in terms of \\(x^4\\). Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it. Let me set \\(y = x^4\\). Then the polynomial becomes \\(y^2 + 3y - 4\\). Hmm, that quadratic might factor nicely. Let me check the discriminant to see if it has real roots. The discriminant \\(D = 9 + 16 = 25\\), which is a perfect square. So, the roots are \\(y = \\frac{-3 \\pm 5}{2}\\), which gives \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = -4\\). Therefore, the quadratic factors as \\((y - 1)(y + 4)\\). Substituting back, that becomes \\((x^4 - 1)(x^4 + 4)\\).\n\nOkay, so now the original polynomial is factored into two parts: \\(x^4 - 1\\) and \\(x^4 + 4\\). But wait, both of these can be factored further over the integers because they're both difference of squares or sums of squares. Let me handle them one by one.\n\nStarting with \\(x^4 - 1\\), that's a difference of squares since \\(x^4 = (x^2)^2\\) and 1 is \\(1^2\\). So, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). Then, \\(x^2 - 1\\) is also a difference of squares, so it factors further into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)\\). Therefore, \\(x^4 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)\\). \n\nNext, looking at \\(x^4 + 4\\), which is a sum of squares"

            "output": ". I remember that there's a formula called the Sophie Germain identity, which allows factoring a sum of squares into two quadratics. The identity is: \\(a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2ab + 2b^2)(a^2 - 2ab + 2b^2)\\). In this case, \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = 1\\), so applying that gives \\(x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). So now, the original polynomial is factored into four parts: \\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\).\n\nBut wait, I need to check if all these factors are irreducible over the integers. Let's see:\n\n1. \\((x - 1)\\) and \\((x + 1)\\) are linear factors, so they cannot be factored further.\n2. \\((x^2 + 1)\\) is a quadratic; discriminant is \\(0 - 4 = -4 < 0\\), so it doesn't factor over real numbers, hence certainly not over integers.\n3. Similarly, \\((x^2 + 2x + 2)\\) discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4 < 0\\), so it's irreducible.\n4. \\((x^2 - 2x + 2)\\) discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4 < 0\\), so also irreducible.\n\nSo, all the factors are irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients and are monic. That means we're done factoring the original polynomial as much as possible.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the sum of each polynomial evaluated at \\(x = 1\\). So, let's evaluate each factor at \\(x = 1\\):\n\n1. \\(p_1(x) = x - 1\\): \\(p_1(1) = 1 - 1 = 0\\)\n2. \\(p_2(x) = x + 1\\): \\(p_2(1) = 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n3. \\(p_3"

So, the total sum is 10.\n\nWait, hold on, the original polynomial is factored into five polynomials? Because I thought that \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4\\) factored into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). So yes, that's five factors. So each of these five factors adds their value at x=1, which are 0, 2, 2, 5, 1. So 0+2+2+5+1 equals 10. \n\nIs there any chance I missed a factor or made an error in the factorization? Let me go back.\n\nOriginal polynomial is \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4\\). Substit"

So, that's 1+1+1+1+1, 5 factors, correct. \n\nWait another thought: when I factor \\(x^4 +4\\), is there another factorization? Like, sometimes there are more than one way to factor a quartic. But according to Sophie Germain identity, it's factored into those two quadratics, which are irreducible, so that's the only way. So, yes, I think the factorization is complete.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 0 + 2 + 2 + 5 +1=10. Hmm, 10 seems correct.\n\nWait, but I remember that sometimes when you factor higher-degree polynomials, sometimes the factors can combine in different ways, but in this case, since each step was a factorization into irreducibles, and all steps were straightforward, I don't think there's any alternative factorization. \n\nJust to be thorough, suppose I check if \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4\\) can be factored in a different way, but considering the substitution step and the application of Sophie Germain identity, I don't think so. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that \\(x^8 + 3x^4 -4 = (x^4)^2 + 3x^4 -4\\), which we already did. So, yes, same as before.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. So, the sum is 10.\n</think>\n\nThe polynomial \\(x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\\) factors into \\((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)\\). Evaluating each factor at \\(x = 1\\) gives values 0, "
