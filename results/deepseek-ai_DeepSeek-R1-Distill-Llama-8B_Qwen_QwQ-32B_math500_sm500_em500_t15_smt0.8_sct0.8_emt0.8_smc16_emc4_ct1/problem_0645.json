So, we have a quadratic polynomial P(x) with real coefficients, and it's bounded between two other quadratics: x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 and 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3. Also, we know that P(11) = 181, and we need to find P(16). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since P(x) is a quadratic polynomial, it must have the general form P(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. Our goal is to find the coefficients a, b, and c, using the given information, and then evaluate P(16).\n\nBut the problem also tells us that P(x) is sandwiched between two other quadratics for all real x. That is, for every x, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 P(x) \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3. So, these inequalities must hold true for all x. Let me write this down:\n\nFor all x, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 \u2264 ax\u00b2 + bx + c \u2264 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3.\n\nHmm, okay. Since these inequalities hold for all real x, it might be useful to consider the difference between P(x) and each of these bounding quadratics. Let me define two new functions:\n\n1. Let Q(x) = P(x) - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Then Q(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c - (x\u00b2 - 2x + 2) = (a - 1)x\u00b2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2).\n\n2. Let R(x) = (2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3) - P(x). Then R(x) = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 - (ax\u00b2 + bx + c) = (2 - a)x\u00b2 + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c).\n\nGiven that P(x) is between the two quadratics, both Q(x) and R(x) must be non-negative for all real x. Since quadratics that are non-negative for all x must have a positive leading coefficient and a discriminant less than or equal to zero, we can set up"

The discriminant of Q(x) must be \u2264 0.\n\nSimilarly, for R(x) to be non-negative for all x:\n\n1. 2 - a > 0 \u21d2 a < 2.\n\n2. The discriminant of R(x) must be \u2264 0.\n\nSo, putting these together, a must satisfy 1 < a < 2.\n\nNow, let's compute the discriminants for Q(x) and R(x).\n\nFor Q(x) = (a - 1)x\u00b2 + (b + 2)x + (c - 2):\n\nDiscriminant \u0394_Q = (b + 2)^2 - 4*(a - 1)*(c - 2) \u2264 0.\n\nSimilarly, for R(x) = (2 - a)x\u00b2 + (-4 - b)x + (3 - c):\n\nDiscriminant \u0394_R = (-4 - b)^2 - 4*(2 - a)*(3 - c) \u2264 0.\n\nSo now, we have two inequalities from the discriminants and the bounds on a:\n\n1. 1 < a < 2.\n\n2. \u0394_Q \u2264 0.\n\n3. \u0394_R \u2264 0.\n\nHmm, so we have three inequalities involving a, b, and c. Also, we have the additional information that P(11) = 181. Let's write that down.\n\nP(11) = a*(11)^2 + b*(11) + c = 121a + 11b + c = 181.\n\nSo that's equation (4): 121a + 11b + c = 181.\n\nSo, now we have two discriminant inequalities, and one equation from P(11). We need another equation. Wait, but P(x) is between two quadratics for all x, which also gives us that Q(x) and R(x) are both non-negative for all x. So, maybe we can write equality cases? Like, maybe there exists some x where P(x) equals both lower and upper quadratics? Or perhaps, more usefully, we can find a point where Q(x) = 0 and R(x) = 0 simultaneously, meaning P(x) touches both quadratics at"

But since Q and R are both non-negative, if they both touch zero at the same point, that would be a point where P(x) is exactly equal to both the lower and upper bounds, so that must be a point where the lower and upper bounds are equal. Let me check if the lower and upper bounds ever intersect.\n\nLet me set the lower bound equal to the upper bound:\n\nx\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 \u21d2 0 = x\u00b2 - 2x + 1 \u21d2 (x - 1)^2 = 0 \u21d2 x = 1.\n\nAh! So the two quadratics only touch at x = 1. That means that at x = 1, both inequalities become equalities. Therefore, P(1) must equal both the lower and upper bounds at x = 1. Let me compute that.\n\nLower bound at x =1: 1 - 2 + 2 = 1.\n\nUpper bound at x =1: 2 -4 +3 =1.\n\nSo, P(1) must equal 1. Therefore, P(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c =1. That's another equation (equation 5): a + b + c =1.\n\nSo now, we have equations:\n\nEquation 4: 121a + 11b + c = 181.\n\nEquation 5: a + b + c =1.\n\nSo, subtract equation 5 from equation 4:\n\n(121a + 11b + c) - (a + b + c) = 181 -1 \u21d2 120a +10b = 180 \u21d2 divide both sides by 10: 12a + b = 18 \u21d2 equation 6: b = 18 -12a.\n\nSo, now we can express b in terms of a. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's also note that since Q(x) and R(x) are both non-negative for all x, and they both have discriminant \u22640, so their discriminants must be zero? Wait, not necessarily. The discriminant can be less than or equal to zero. But if they are tangent to the x-axis, then discriminant"

Hmm, but if Q(x) and R(x) have discriminant < 0, they never touch the x-axis. But if discriminant = 0, they touch at one point.\n\nBut in our case, since Q(x) and R(x) are non-negative for all x, and also, the two bounding quadratics only touch at x=1. So maybe Q(x) and R(x) only touch at x=1? Or, more accurately, since the bounding quadratics touch at x=1, that is the only point where P(x) coincides with both bounds.\n\nWait, perhaps if Q(x) and R(x) both have discriminant zero, then they each have a double root. Since Q(x) = (a -1)x\u00b2 + (b + 2)x + (c -2). If discriminant is zero, then Q(x) = k(x - r)^2, where k is positive because the quadratic is non-negative. Similarly for R(x).\n\nBut for Q(x), leading coefficient is (a - 1), which is positive since a >1. Similarly, for R(x), leading coefficient is (2 - a), which is also positive since a <2. So both Q(x) and R(x) are upward opening parabolas. So, if their discriminants are zero, they each touch the x-axis at exactly one point. But also, since the bounding quadratics touch at x=1, perhaps that is the point where both Q(x) and R(x) touch zero. So, perhaps Q(1)=0 and R(1)=0. Because if we plug x=1 into Q(x), it should be zero, since P(1)=1 and the lower bound is 1. Similarly, R(1)=0 because upper bound at x=1 is 1, and P(1)=1.\n\nTherefore, Q(1)=0 and R(1)=0.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nFor Q(x):\n\nAt x=1: Q(1) = (a -1)(1)^2 + (b +2)(1) + (c -2) = (a -1) + (b +2) + (c -2) = a -1 + b +2 + c -2 = a + b + c -1.\n\n"

Similarly, R(1) = (2 -a)(1)^2 + (-4 -b)(1) + (3 -c) = (2 -a) + (-4 -b) + (3 -c) = 2 -a -4 -b +3 -c = (2 -4 +3) + (-a -b -c) =1 - (a + b + c). Again, since a + b + c =1, this is 1 -1 =0. So that's good. So, both Q(1) and R(1) are zero, so that's the point where they touch the x-axis. Therefore, since Q(x) and R(x) are non-negative and have a root at x=1, and they are quadratics opening upwards (for Q(x)) and upwards (for R(x)), then they must have their minimum at x=1, so the vertex is at x=1. Therefore, the vertex of Q(x) is at x=1, so the derivative of Q(x) at x=1 is zero. Similarly for R(x).\n\nAlternatively, since the discriminant is zero, the quadratic has a double root at x=1. Therefore, Q(x) must be a multiple of (x -1)^2. Let me see.\n\nLet me write Q(x) as (a -1)x\u00b2 + (b +2)x + (c -2). Since it has a double root at x=1, then Q(x) = k(x -1)^2, where k = a -1 (the leading coefficient). Let me check:\n\nIf Q(x) = (a -1)(x -1)^2, then expanding that gives (a -1)(x\u00b2 - 2x +1) = (a -1)x\u00b2 - 2(a -1)x + (a -1). Comparing this to the original expression for Q(x):\n\nOriginal Q(x): (a -1)x\u00b2 + (b +2)x + (c -2).\n\nTherefore, equate coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of x\u00b2: same, (a -1).\n\nCoefficient of x: -2(a -1) must equal (b +2).\n\nConstant term: (a -1) must equal"
