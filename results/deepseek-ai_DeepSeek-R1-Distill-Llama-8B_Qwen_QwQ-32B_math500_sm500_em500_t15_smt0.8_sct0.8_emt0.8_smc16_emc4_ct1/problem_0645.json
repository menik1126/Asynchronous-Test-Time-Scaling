Let me try to understand what it's asking and figure out how to approach it.\n\nThe problem says: Let \\( P(x) \\) be a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients satisfying \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\le P(x) \\le 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\). Also, we know that \\( P(11) = 181 \\). We need to find \\( P(16) \\).\n\nFirst, I know that a quadratic polynomial has the general form \\( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are real coefficients. Since it's quadratic, its graph is a parabola.\n\nThe problem gives two inequalities that bound \\( P(x) \\) between two other quadratics. These inequalities must hold for all real \\( x \\). So, for every real number \\( x \\), the value of \\( P(x) \\) is sandwiched between \\( x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) and \\( 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\).\n\nLet me denote the lower bound as \\( L(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\) and the upper bound as \\( U(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\). So, \\( L(x) \\le P(x) \\le U(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nI think the first step is to figure out how these two quadratics relate to each other and how they constrain the possible forms of \\( P(x) \\).\n\nLet me write down both quadratics:\n\n\\( L(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\)\n\n\\( U(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 3 \\)\n\nI can compute the difference between them to see how much \\( P(x) \\) can vary.\n\nCompute \\( U(x) - L(x) \\):\n\n\\( (2x^2 - 4x + 3) - (x^2 - 2x + 2) = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( U(x) - L(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^"

This makes sense because the upper bound is above the lower bound for all \\( x \\).\n\nSo, \\( U(x) - L(x) \\ge 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), and equality holds when \\( (x - 1)^2 = 0 \\) i.e., at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( P(x) \\) is squeezed between \\( L(x) \\) and \\( U(x) \\), so \\( P(x) \\) must lie in this band for all \\( x \\). Additionally, \\( P(x) \\) is quadratic, so it's a parabola. Since \\( P(x) \\) is between these two quadratics, maybe \\( P(x) \\) is exactly equal to one of them? Or perhaps it's a weighted average or something else. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, both \\( L(x) \\) and \\( U(x) \\) are quadratics, so perhaps \\( P(x) \\) is a linear combination of them. Since \\( P(x) \\) is also quadratic, maybe it's a combination of \\( L(x) \\) and \\( U(x) \\) with coefficients that sum appropriately.\n\nWait, another approach: since both \\( L(x) \\) and \\( U(x) \\) are quadratic, maybe they intersect each other, and \\( P(x) \\) is the average or something in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \\( P(x) \\) is exactly equal to \\( L(x) + k(x)U(x) \\), where \\( k(x) \\) is some function between 0 and 1. But since \\( P(x) \\) is a quadratic, \\( k(x) \\) must be a constant to maintain the quadratic nature.\n\nLet me think: If \\( P(x) = \\lambda L(x) + (1 - \\lambda) U(x) \\) for some \\( \\lambda \\) between 0 and 1, then \\( P(x) \\) would satisfy \\( L(x) \\le P(x) \\le U(x) \\).

But then again, \\( k \\) would have to be a constant, not a function of x, to keep P(x) quadratic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference between P(x) and L(x) is a multiple of (x - 1)^2, but such that it doesn't exceed the upper bound. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me suppose that \\( P(x) = L(x) + k(x - 1)^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a non-negative constant. Then, since \\( U(x) - L(x) = (x - 1)^2 \\), then if \\( k \\le 1 \\), then \\( P(x) \\le L(x) + (x - 1)^2 = U(x) \\), so that would satisfy the upper bound. Similarly, if \\( k \\ge 0 \\), then \\( P(x) \\ge L(x) \\). So this seems like a possible form.\n\nTherefore, perhaps \\( P(x) = L(x) + k(x - 1)^2 \\), where \\( 0 \\le k \\le 1 \\). Then, since \\( P(x) \\) is quadratic, this would work. Let me check.\n\nLet me compute \\( L(x) + k(x - 1)^2 \\):\n\n\\( L(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \\)\n\n\\( k(x - 1)^2 = k(x^2 - 2x + 1) \\)\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\( (1 + k)x^2 - 2(1 + k)x + (2 + k) \\)\n\nSo, \\( P(x) = (1 + k)x^2 - 2(1 + k)x + (2 + k) \\)\n\nHmm, so that's a quadratic with coefficients depending on k. Since \\( 0 \\le k \\le 1 \\), the coefficients would vary accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is the right approach. Let me see if this works.\n\n"

Wait, but the problem states that the inequalities hold for all real x, so perhaps P(x) touches both L(x) and U(x) at some points?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal and maximal possible quadratics between L and U would be L and U themselves, but since P(x) is a quadratic in between, perhaps it's a combination?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic P(x) must coincide with both L(x) and U(x) at certain points, but since they are quadratics, maybe they intersect at some points?\n\nWait, let me check if L(x) and U(x) intersect.
