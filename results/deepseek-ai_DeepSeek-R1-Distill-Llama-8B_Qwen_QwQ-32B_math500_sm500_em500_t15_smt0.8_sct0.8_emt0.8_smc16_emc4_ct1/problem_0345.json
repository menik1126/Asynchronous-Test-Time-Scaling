That gives:\n\\(2 + 3 -4 +5 = 6\\)\nTotal: 1 +6 +6 =13.\n\nHmm. Maybe trying to make a larger negative group. Let's see:\n\n\\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\\). Wait, but the original expression is 1+2+3-4+5+6. If I group 4+5+6, but the minus is only before 4. So actually, the expression would be 1+2+3 - (4+5+6). Let me check:\n\nOriginal terms: 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. To group 4+5+6, the minus before 4 would apply to the entire group. So that would be 1+2+3 - (4+5+6) = 6 -15 = -9. Wait, that's a big negative. But is that allowed?\n\nWait, the problem says we can't rearrange the order of the terms. So the original sequence is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. To group 4+5+6, the parentheses would have to be placed after the -4, but the +5 and +6 are after. So the expression would be 1+2+3 - (4 +5 +6). Since the minus is before the 4, grouping 4+5+6 would indeed make that term subtract the sum of those three. Let me compute that:\n\n1+2+3 =6, 4+5+6=15, so 6 -15 = -9, then there are no terms left. Wait, but the original expression has +5 and +6 after the -4. So if I group (4 +5 +6), the entire expression becomes 1+2+3 - (4+5+6). That's valid because parentheses can be added without rearranging terms. So that gives -9, which is lower than 3.\n\nWait, why didn't I think of that earlier?

Since we cannot rearrange terms, but adding parentheses is allowed, and this is a valid placement without changing the order.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6. So to group 4,5,6 as a single term, I have to put parentheses around 4 +5 +6. Since the -4 is followed by +5 and +6, is that considered as - (4 +5 +6)? It would be because the minus is only before 4, but we can add parentheses to include 5 and 6 in the subtraction. So that would indeed change the value from 13 to -9.\n\nIs that correct? Let me double-check:\n\n1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.\n\nIf I group 4 +5 +6, that's 15. So it becomes 1 +2 +3 -15. 1+2+3=6, 6-15=-9. Yes.\n\nSo that's a valid grouping and gives a lower value than the previous example.\n\nIs there a way to make it even lower? Let's see. What if I group 2 +3 -4 +5, that would be 2+3-4+5=6. Then the expression would be 1 +6 +6=13.\n\nAlternatively, grouping 3 -4 +5: that's 4. Then 1+2+4 +6=13.\n\nNot lower.\n\nAnother possibility: group 1+2+3-4, which is 2. Then the expression becomes 2 +5 +6=13.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nWait, so the only way to get a lower value is to group the 4+5+6. Because that turns the positive 4,5,6 into a negative, thus reducing the total.\n\nIs there another way? Let me think.\n\nWhat if I group 5 and 6: 5 +6=11. Then the expression becomes 1 +2 +3 -4 +11=13.\n\nStill 13.\n\nWhat if I group 1+2: 3. Then expression: 3 +3"

Then 1+2 + (-12) +6= (1+2) + (-12 +6)=3 -6= -3. Wait, but that's not correct because the original expression is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.

Let me see:\n\nOriginal sequence: 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6.\n\nIf I want to group 3 - (4+5+6), that would require inserting parentheses around 4+5+6, but the minus is between 3 and 4.

Wait, but the original sequence is 1 +2 +3 -4 +5 +6. If I group 1+2 first, then the rest is 3 -4 +5 +6. But if I want to group 4+5+6, I can do that as before.\n\nAlternatively, group 1 + (2 +3 - (4 +5) +6). Let's see:\n\nInside the parentheses: 2+3=5, then - (4+5)= -9, so 5 -9 +6=2.

That's 1 + (2 -1 +5) +6=1+6+6=13.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: group the 5+6 into a positive term, but maybe group something else. Wait, but to minimize, we need to subtract as much as possible. So the best is to subtract the largest possible sum. The largest possible sum after the minus is 4+5+6=15, so subtracting that gives the lowest.\n\nAlternatively, can we subtract a larger sum? Let's see.\n\nThe minus is only before the 4. So the only way to subtract a larger sum is to include more terms after the minus. Since the minus is before 4, we can group 4 with the following terms, so that the entire group is subtracted. So grouping 4+5+6 gives the maximum possible subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, if we can group terms before the minus, but that would require parentheses before the minus, but that would not help in reducing the total.\n\nWait, for example, if we group (1+2+3-4) +5+6, that gives 2 +11"
