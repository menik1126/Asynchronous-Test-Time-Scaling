The equation provided is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. So, I remember that when you have fractions like this, you can combine them by finding a common denominator. The denominators here are (x - 3) and (x + 8). So, the common denominator would be (x - 3)(x + 8). That makes sense because multiplying each fraction by the other's denominator will eliminate the variables in the numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me try that. So, I'll rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} + \\frac{D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check the denominator on the right side. The equation given is (x^2 + 5x - 24). I should factor that to see if it's the same as (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me try:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to -24 and add up to +5. That would be 8 and -3 because 8 * (-3) = -24 and 8 + (-3) = 5. So yes, x^2 + 5x -24 factors into (x + 8)(x - 3). Perfect, so the denominators match.\n\nNow, I can combine the left side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)}{(x - 3)(x + 8)} = \\frac{4x - 23}{(x - 3)(x + 8)}\n\\]\n\nSince the denominators are the same, the numerators must be equal:\n\n\\[\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find C and D such that this equation holds for all real x except -8 and 3."

            "output": " Since this is a linear equation in x, the coefficients of x and the constant term must be equal on both sides.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x -23\n\nNow, since this is an identity (meaning it's true for all x), the coefficients of x and the constant terms must be equal. So, set up the equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two variables, C and D. I need to solve this system.\n\nFrom equation 1: C + D = 4, which I can express as D = 4 - C.\n\nSubstituting D into equation 2:\n\n8C - 3(4 - C) = -23\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n8C - 12 + 3C = -23\n\nWait, that's because 3 times (4 - C) is 12 - 3C. So, 8C - (12 - 3C) would be 8C -12 +3C.\n\nSo, 8C - 12 + 3C = (8C + 3C) -12 = 11C -12\n\nSo:\n\n11C - 12 = -23\n\nNow, add 12 to both sides:\n\n11C = -23 + 12\n\n11C = -11\n\nDivide both sides by 11:\n\nC = -1\n\nNow, from equation 1: C + D = 4, so:\n\n-1 + D = 4\n\nTherefore, D = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, C is -1 and D is 5. Now, the question asks for the product CD:\n\nCD = (-1) * 5 = -5\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nPlugging C = -1 and D = 5 back into the initial equation:\n\nLeft side: (-1)/(x - 3) + 5/(x + 8)\n\nCombine:\n\n[ - (x + 8) + 5(x -"
