            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm supposed to find the product CD where C and D are integers. The equation given is a rational expression:\n\n\\[\\frac{C}{x-3} + \\frac{D}{x+8} = \\frac{4x - 23}{x^2 + 5x - 24}\\]\n\nHmm, first off, I remember that when you have fractions like this, you can combine them on one side and then express them as a single fraction. The right-hand side is already a single fraction, so maybe I can bring the left side to one side and set it equal to zero. That might help me find a common denominator or something.\n\nWait, let me think. Since the left side equals the right side for all real x except -8 and 3, the denominators can't be zero. So, x can't be 3 or -8, which makes sense because those would make the denominators on the left side zero.\n\nOkay, so to combine the two fractions on the left, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (x - 3) and (x + 8), so the common denominator would be their product, which is (x - 3)(x + 8). That makes sense because that's the least common denominator since they are both linear and distinct.\n\nSo, if I rewrite each fraction with the common denominator, I can then combine them. Let's do that step by step. The first fraction is C/(x - 3), so when we multiply numerator and denominator by (x + 8), it becomes C(x + 8)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)]. Similarly, the second fraction D/(x + 8) becomes D(x - 3)/[(x - 3)(x + 8)].\n\nNow, adding these two fractions together, I get:\n\n[C(x + 8) + D(x - 3)] / [(x - 3)(x + 8)] = (4x - 23)/(x^2 + 5x - 24)\n\nWait, the right-hand side denominator is x² + 5x - 24. Let me check if that factors into (x - 3)(x + 8). Let me multiply (x - 3)(x + 8):\n\nx * x = x²\n\nx * 8 ="

            "output": " 8x\n\n-3 * x = -3x\n\n-3 * 8 = -24\n\nSo adding those terms: x² + 8x - 3x -24 = x² +5x -24. Yes, that's exactly the denominator on the right side. So the denominators are the same. Therefore, the numerators must be equal for the equation to hold for all x except -8 and 3.\n\nTherefore, we can set the numerators equal to each other:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = 4x - 23\n\nNow, this equation must hold for all x except -8 and 3, but since polynomials are equal everywhere they are defined, except those points, but since the equation is true for all x except those two, the polynomials must be identical. Therefore, the coefficients of corresponding terms must be equal.\n\nSo, let's expand the left side:\n\nC(x + 8) + D(x - 3) = Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(C + D)x + (8C - 3D)\n\nThis must equal the right side, which is 4x -23. Therefore, the coefficients of x and the constant terms must be equal. So, we can set up a system of equations:\n\n1. Coefficient of x: C + D = 4\n\n2. Constant term: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nNow, we need to solve this system of equations for C and D. Let me write them down again:\n\nEquation 1: C + D = 4\n\nEquation 2: 8C - 3D = -23\n\nHmm, okay, so maybe solve for one variable in terms of the other from the first equation and substitute into the second. Let's solve Equation 1 for C:\n\nC = 4 - D\n\nThen substitute this into Equation 2:\n\n8*(4 - D) - 3D = -23\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, expand the 8*(4 - D):\n\n8*4 = 32, 8*(-D) = -8D, so 32 -8D -3D = -23\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n32 -11D = -23\n\nNow,"

Perfect, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, C is -1 and D is 5.\n\nThe problem asks for the product CD, so CD = (-1)*5 = -5.\n\nWait, that's negative five. Hmm, so the product is -5.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe started by equating the left side to the right side, found the common denominator, set the numerators equal, and expanded to form a system of equations.\n\nSolved for C and D, found C=-1 and D=5, then their product is -5.\n\nThat seems correct.
