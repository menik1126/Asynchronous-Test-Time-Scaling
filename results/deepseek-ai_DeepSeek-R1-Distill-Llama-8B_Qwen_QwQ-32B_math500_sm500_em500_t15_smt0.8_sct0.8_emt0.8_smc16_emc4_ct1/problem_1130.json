            "output": "First, I'll determine the robot's speed based on the first scenario. It travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours. Converting kilometers to meters gives 1000 meters, and hours to seconds is 9000 seconds. So, the speed is 1000 meters divided by 9000 seconds, which equals 0.1111 meters per second.\n\nNext, I'll use this speed to find out how long the hallway is. The robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway length at 0.1111 meters per second. Dividing 90 seconds by 0.1111 gives approximately 810 meters.\n\nFinally, I'll present the hallway length in meters as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the length of the hallway, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Robot's Speed\nThe robot travels 1 kilometer in 2.5 hours.  \n- **Convert 1 kilometer to meters:**  \n  \\(1 \\text{ km} = 1000 \\text{ m}\\)\n  \n- **Convert 2.5 hours to seconds:**  \n  \\(2.5 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \\text{ minutes}\\)  \n  \\(150 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 9000 \\text{ seconds}\\)\n\n- **Calculate the speed:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ m}}{9000 \\text{ s}} = 0.1111 \\text{ m/s}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Hallway Length\nThe robot takes 90 seconds to travel the hallway length at the same speed.  \n- **Use the speed to find the distance:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} = 0.1111 \\text{ m/s} \\times 90 \\text{ s} \\approx 10 \\text{ m}\n  \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe hallway is approximately \\(\\boxed{10}\\) meters long."
