The primes less than 30 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nNext, I should determine the set of all odd numbers greater than zero. Odd numbers are numbers that are not divisible by 2, meaning they have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. The sequence of odd numbers starts from 1 and continues as 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on.\n\nNow, to find the intersection of these two sets, I need to identify the common elements. Since all prime numbers except for 2 are odd, the primes less than 30 that are also odd are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.\n\nCounting these, there are 9 prime numbers that are also odd and less than 30.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** How many elements are in the intersection of the set of all the prime numbers less than 30 and the set of all the odd numbers greater than zero?\n\n---\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the set of all prime numbers less than 30.\n\nThe prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
