Given the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, I'll plug these values into the formula to find the volume of one beaker.\n\nNext, I'll determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. The radius of the tank is 6 cm, so I'll substitute this into the formula to find out how much space the tank can hold.\n\nAfter calculating both volumes, I'll divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank completely.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n**1.
