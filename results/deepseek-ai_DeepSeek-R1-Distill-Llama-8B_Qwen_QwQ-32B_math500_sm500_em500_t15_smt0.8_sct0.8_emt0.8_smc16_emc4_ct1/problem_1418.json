Plugging in the values, the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. The radius of the spherical tank is given as 6 cm, so I'll substitute that into the formula to find out how much water it can hold.\n\nAfter determining both volumes, I'll divide the total volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker to find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank completely.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Cylindrical Beaker Dimensions:**\n  - Radius (\\( r_{beaker} \\)) = 3 cm\n  - Height (\\( h_{beaker} \\)) = 8 cm\n- **Spherical Tank Dimensions:**\n  - Radius (\\( r_{tank} \\)) = 6 cm\n\n**Objective:**\nFind the number of cylindrical beakers needed to fill a spherical tank completely.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Volume of a Cylindrical Beaker**\n\nThe volume (\\( V_{beaker} \\)) of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV_{beaker} = \\pi r_{beaker}^2 h_{beaker}\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nV_{beaker} = \\pi \\times (3 \\, \\text{cm})^2 \\times 8 \\, \\text{cm} = \\pi \\times 9 \\, \\text{cm}^2 \\times 8 \\, \\text{cm} = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\nThe volume (\\( V_{tank} \\)) of a sphere is given by the formula:\n\\[\nV_{tank} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{tank}^3\n\\]\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nV_{tank} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times (6 \\, \\text{cm})^"
