            "output": "First, I need to calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Given that the radius is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, plugging in the values gives V = π * 3² * 8 = 72π cm³.\n\nNext, I need to determine the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πR³. The radius of the spherical tank is 6 cm, so the volume is V = (4/3)π * 6³ = (4/3)π * 216 = 288π cm³.\n\nNow, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, I divide the volume of the sphere by the volume of one beaker. That is, 288π cm³ divided by 72π cm³, which simplifies to 4. Therefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers to fill the spherical tank. \n\nI should double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy. The volume of the cylinder is indeed 72π cm³, and the volume of the sphere is 288π cm³. Dividing 288π by 72π gives exactly 4, confirming that 4 beakers are needed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers of water are needed to fill a spherical tank, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker:**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi r^2 h\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - Radius (\\( r \\)) = 3 cm\n   - Height (\\( h \\)) = 8 cm\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{cylinder}} = \\pi (3)^2 (8) = 72\\pi \\, \\text{cm}^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank:**\n   \n   The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   -"
