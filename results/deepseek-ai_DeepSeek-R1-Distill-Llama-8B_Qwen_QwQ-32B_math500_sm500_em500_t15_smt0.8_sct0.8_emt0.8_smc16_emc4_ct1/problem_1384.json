            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under a matrix M. The matrix M takes the vector [2, -1] to [9, 3] and [1, -3] to [7, -1]. Hmm, okay, so M is a linear transformation, right? And to find the image of a line under this transformation, I probably need to figure out what happens to the line when we apply M.\n\nFirst, let me recall how linear transformations affect lines. If I have a line in the original space, applying M will transform it into another line in the new space. The image will be a line, and I need to find its equation. To do that, maybe I should find the images of two points on the original line y = 2x + 1, and then determine the equation of the line connecting these two transformed points.\n\nBut wait, I don't know the actual matrix M. I only know two specific vectors and their images. Maybe I can figure out what M is by using the given information. If I can find M, then I can apply it to any point on the original line.\n\nOkay, so let me denote M as a 2x2 matrix:\n\nM = [ [a, b],\n       [c, d] ]\n\nWhen M is applied to a vector [x, y], it results in [a*x + b*y, c*x + d*y]. \n\nGiven that M takes [2, -1] to [9, 3], so:\n\n9 = a*2 + b*(-1)\n3 = c*2 + d*(-1)\n\nSimilarly, M takes [1, -3] to [7, -1], so:\n\n7 = a*1 + b*(-3)\n-1 = c*1 + d*(-3)\n\nNow I have a system of equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nSo I have four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d. Let me try to solve this.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 3, which both involve a and b.\n\nEquation 1: 2a - b = 9\nEquation 3: a - 3"

Perfect, so the matrix is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the image of the line y =2x +1 under M.\n\nHmm, how do I do that? Well, the line can be parametrized. Let me think.

Alternatively, I can choose arbitrary points, say x=0 and x=1, which are simple.\n\nBut actually, another thought: perhaps it's better to parametrize the line with a parameter t. Let me set x = t, then y=2t +1. So the parametric equations are x = t, y =2t +1.

So the image is y=2x +3. Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this, maybe through the line equation directly.\n\nAlternatively, since the transformation is linear, except that the original line is affine (since it's y=2x+1, not through the origin). So perhaps the image will also be an affine line, but the linear part can be found by the transformation of the direction vector, and then the translation part?\n\nWait, but linear transformations don't preserve translation, unless we use affine transformations.

So to find the image, maybe the image line can be found by transforming the direction vector and the point, then find the new line.\n\nWait, let me think. The original line y=2x +1 can be written in parametric form as (t, 2t +1). So to find the image, we have to apply M to each point on this line.\n\nAlternatively, think of the line as a set of vectors, so each vector on the line is (x, y) = [x; y], where y =2x +1.\n\nBut wait, y is expressed in terms of x, so technically, it's a one-dimensional affine subspace. But if I consider y as a function of x, maybe I can express M as acting on x and y, but since M is linear, it will act on the vector [x; y].\n\nBut since y is dependent on x, perhaps it's better to use parametric equations.\n\nWait, earlier approach worked, so maybe the image is y=2x +3.\n\nBut wait, let me consider another method. Let's suppose that the image of the line y=2x +1 is another line, say y = m x + b. To find m and b, we can use the fact that the image line is the set of all M(v) where v is on the original line.\n\nSo let me suppose that v = [x, y], where y =2x +1.

So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of direction vectors and points.\n\nThe original line has a direction vector. Since the line is y=2x +1, its direction vector is [1, 2], because for every 1 unit in x, y increases by 2. The point (0,1) is on the line.\n\nSo the direction vector [1,2] is transformed by M. Let's compute M*[1;2]:\n\nM*[1;2] = [4*1 -1*2, 2*1 +1*2] = [4 -2, 2 +2] = [2,4]. So the direction vector becomes [2,4], which is equivalent to [1,2] scaled by 2. So the direction of the image line is along [2,4], which simplifies to the direction vector [1,2], so the slope is 4/2 =2, which matches the slope we found earlier.\n\nNow, the point (0,1) on the original line is transformed to M*[0;1] = [4*0 -1*1, 2*0 +1*1] = [-1,1]. So the image line passes through (-1,1) and has direction vector [2,4], so the slope is 2. Therefore, the equation is y -1 =2(x +1), which simplifies to y=2x +2 +1=2x +3. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, all methods lead to the equation y=2x +3. So I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check once more with another point. Let's take x = -1 on the original line. Then y =2*(-1)+1 =-2 +1 =-1. So the point (-1, -1). Applying M:\n\nx' =4*(-1) - (-1) =-4 +1 =-3\n\ny' =2*(-1) + (-1) =-2 -1 =-3\n\nWait, so the image point is (-3, -3).
