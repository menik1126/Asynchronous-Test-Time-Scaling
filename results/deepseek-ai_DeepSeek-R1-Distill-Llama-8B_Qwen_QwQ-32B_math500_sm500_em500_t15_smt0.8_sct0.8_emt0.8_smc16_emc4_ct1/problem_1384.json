I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this matrix M. Hmm, alright. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what it means for a matrix to transform a vector. If M is a 2x2 matrix, then multiplying it by a vector [x; y] should give the transformed vector. So, if M takes [2; -1] to [9; 3], then M * [2; -1] = [9; 3]. Similarly, M * [1; -3] = [7; -1].\n\nSo, maybe I can set up equations to find the matrix M. Let me denote M as:\n\nM = [a, b;\n     c, d]\n\nThen, M * [2; -1] = [9; 3] gives us the system:\n2a - b = 9\n-2c + d = 3\n\nAnd M * [1; -3] = [7; -1] gives another system:\na - 3b = 7\n-3c + d = -1\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) -2c + d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) -3c + d = -1\n\nI can solve this system for a, b, c, d. Let me do that.\n\nFrom equations 1 and 3, both have a and b. Let me subtract equation 3 from equation 1:\n\n(2a - b) - (a - 3b) = 9 - 7\n\nWhich simplifies to 2a - b - a + 3b = 2\n\nSo, (2a - a) + (-b + 3b) = 2 => a + 2b = 2. Let's call this equation 5.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a - b = 9. Let me use equation 5 here. From equation 5: a = 2 - 2b.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1: 2*(2 - 2b) - b = 9.\n\nCalculate: 4 - 4b - b"

            "output": " = 9 → 4 -5b = 9 → -5b = 5 → b = -1.\n\nThen, from equation 5: a = 2 - 2*(-1) = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nSo, a = 4, b = -1.\n\nNow, let's move to equations 2 and 4, which involve c and d.\n\nEquation 2: -2c + d = 3\n\nEquation 4: -3c + d = -1\n\nLet me subtract equation 4 from equation 2:\n\n(-2c + d) - (-3c + d) = 3 - (-1)\n\nWhich becomes: (-2c + d +3c - d) = 4 → c = 4.\n\nNow, plug c =4 into equation 2: -2*(4) + d = 3 → -8 + d = 3 → d = 11.\n\nSo, d = 11.\n\nSo, the matrix M is:\n\n[4, -1;\n4, 11]\n\nOkay, so that's M.\n\nNow, I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this transformation.\n\nThe image of a line under a linear transformation is another line. To find it, I can transform two points from the original line and then find the equation of the line passing through those transformed points.\n\nSo, let's pick two points from the original line y = 2x +1. Let me choose x = 0 and x =1, because that's simple.\n\nWhen x=0: y = 2*0 +1 =1, so point (0,1)\n\nWhen x=1: y = 2*1 +1 =3, so point (1,3)\n\nSo, the two points are (0,1) and (1,3). Now, I need to apply matrix M to both points.\n\nFirst, transform (0,1):\n\nM * [0;1] = [4*0 + (-1)*1; 4*0 +11*1] = [-1; 11]\n\nSo, that gives (-1, 11)\n\nSecond, transform (1,3):\n\nM * [1;3] = [4*1 + (-1)*3; 4*1 +11*3] = [4 -3; "

Let's use point (-1,11):\n\ny -11 =13(x - (-1)) → y -11 =13(x +1) → y =13x +13 +11 → y=13x +24\n\nWait, let me check that. 13*(x +1) is 13x +13. Then, y = 13x +13 +11 → 13x +24.\n\nAlternatively, let's check with point (1,37):\n\ny -37 =13*(x -1) → y =13x -13 +37 → y=13x +24. Same result.\n\nSo, the equation is y=13x +24.\n\nWait, that seems like a steep slope. Let me just double-check my calculations in case I messed up.\n\nWait, matrix M is [4, -1;4,11]. So, let's check M * [0;1] again:\n\n4*0 + (-1)*1 = -1, and 4*0 +11*1=11. So, that's (-1,11). Correct.\n\nM * [1;3] is 4*1 + (-1)*3=4-3=1, and 4*1 +11*3=4+33=37. So, (1,37). Correct.\n\nSlope from (-1,11) to (1,37): (37-11)/(1 - (-1))=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nThen using point (-1,11): y -11=13(x +1) → y=13x +13 +11=13x +24.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the image of the line y=2x+1 under M is y=13x +24.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first determined the matrix \\( \\mathbf{M} \\) by solving a system of equations derived from the given transformations"
