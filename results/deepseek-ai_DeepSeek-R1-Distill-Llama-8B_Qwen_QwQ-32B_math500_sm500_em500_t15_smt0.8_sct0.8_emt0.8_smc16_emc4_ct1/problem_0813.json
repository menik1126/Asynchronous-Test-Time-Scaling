The leading coefficient \\( a_n \\) is 2, and the constant term \\( a_0 \\) is 66. The roots of this polynomial are distinct integers, and I need to find the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\).\n\nHmm, let me think about this. Since all the coefficients are integers and the roots are integers, this polynomial should factor into linear terms with integer roots. That makes sense because if a polynomial has integer coefficients and an integer root, then the root is a divisor of the constant term. But since the roots are distinct, each root must divide 66, and they can't repeat.\n\nFirst, let me factorize 66 to find all possible integer roots. 66 can be factored into primes as \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 11 \\). So the possible integer roots are \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66 \\). But we need distinct roots, so I can't repeat any of these.\n\nNow, since \\( a_n = 2 \\), the polynomial can be written as \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_k) \\), where each \\( r_i \\) is an integer root, and they are all distinct.\n\nOur goal is to choose a set of distinct integer roots such that the resulting polynomial has the smallest possible \\( |a_{n-1}| \\). \\( a_{n-1} \\) is the coefficient of \\( x^{n-1} \\), which, in the expanded polynomial, is equal to \\( -2(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_k) \\). So, to minimize \\( |a_{n-1}| \\), we need to minimize \\( | -(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_k) | \\), which is equivalent to minimizing \\( |r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_k| \\).\n\nTherefore, we need to find a set of distinct integer divisors"

Because the smaller the absolute value of their sum, the smaller \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) will be.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the subset of distinct divisors of 66 (from the list \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66 \\)) whose sum is zero or as close to zero as possible.\n\nWait, can we actually get a sum of zero? Let me check.\n\nLet's try to find a subset of these divisors that adds up to zero. Since we have both positive and negative numbers, maybe combining them can lead to cancellation.\n\nFor example, if I take a positive number and its negative counterpart, they sum to zero. So the ideal case would be if we can pair all the roots such that each pair sums to zero, then the total sum would be zero, which would give \\( |a_{n-1}| = 0 \\).\n\nBut is that possible? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the list of divisors, if I pair 1 and -1, 2 and -2, 3 and -3, etc., but wait, only the divisors of 66, so for example, do we have all these pairs? Let's see:\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n1 and -1,\n\n2 and -2,\n\n3 and -3,\n\n6 and -6,\n\n11 and -11,\n\n22 and -22,\n\n33 and -33,\n\n66 and -66.\n\nBut the problem is that the roots have to be distinct. So for each positive number, we can have its negative counterpart as another root. If we include both, they would sum to zero for each pair.\n\nBut hold on, how many roots can I have? The polynomial's degree n is the number of roots, so n is the number of distinct roots.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the degree. So we can choose any number of roots, as long as they are distinct and divide 66.\n\nBut our goal is to pick as many pairs as possible such that their sum cancels out. Each pair (k, -k) contributes 0 to the total sum, so including as many such pairs as possible would bring the total sum closer to zero.\n\nBut 66 is 2 × 3 × 11, so the divisors"

To get the sum as close to zero as possible, we can pair them up. But the problem is that the roots must be distinct, so we can't have duplicates. So if I take both 1 and -1, that's allowed as they are distinct. Similarly for other pairs.\n\nHowever, the total number of roots must be even if we pair them all, but maybe we can have an odd number of roots if we leave one unpaired. But since we want the sum as close to zero as possible, perhaps an even number is better.\n\nWait, but the minimal |sum| would be zero if possible, so let's see if that's achievable.\n\nSuppose we take all the divisors in pairs (k, -k). Let's see how many such pairs we can have.\n\nEach pair (k, -k) contributes 0 to the sum. The more pairs we have, the better. But the problem is that the product of all roots (times 2) must be equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient? Wait, actually, the constant term is the product of the roots multiplied by the leading coefficient (with a sign depending on the degree). Let me recall Vieta's formula.\n\nVieta's formula says that for a monic polynomial (leading coefficient 1), the product of the roots is (-1)^n times the constant term. But here, the leading coefficient is 2, so the product of the roots is (a_0)/a_n multiplied by (-1)^n. Wait, let me get this straight.\n\nLet me write the polynomial as \\( f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n) \\). Then expanding this, the constant term is \\( 2(-r_1)(-r_2)...(-r_n) = 2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n \\). The problem states that the constant term \\( a_0 = 6"

So the product of the roots times 2 is 66, because \\( f(0) = a_0 = 66 = 2(-1)^n r_1 r_2 ... r_n \\). So \\( r_1 r_2 ... r_n = 33 \\times (-1)^n \\).\n\nBut the product of roots is 33 times (-1)^n. So, in any case, 33 is positive or negative depending on n. But 33 is 3 × 11, which is the same as 66 divided by 2.\n\nSo, 33 is a key factor here.\n\nGiven that, the product of the roots is 33 times (-1)^n, so whether n is even or odd, the product is either 33 or -33.\n\nSo the product of all roots must be either 33 or -33.\n\nGiven that, we need to choose distinct integer roots, whose product is 33 or -33, and whose sum is as close to zero as possible.\n\nAlso, considering the roots, they must be divisors of 66, so each root is in the set \\( \\{\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66\\} \\).\n\nSo, the possible roots can be ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, ±66.\n\nBut we have to choose a subset of these such that their product is ±33 (depending on n), and the sum is minimized in absolute value.\n\nSo, first, let's consider that the product of roots must be ±33. Let's first consider positive 33, so the product is 33, with n even (since 33 is positive, and \\( r_1 r_2 ... r_n = (-1)^n \\times 33 \\). So"

But since we need distinct integers, and all factors must be divisors of 66.\n\nAlternatively, 33 can be written as 3 × 11, or 3 × 11 × 1 × (-1) but that would change the product. Wait, but if we need the product to be exactly 33, then we can't have any extra factors. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of all possible subsets of the divisors (excluding zero, since roots are integers and 0 isn't a root here because the constant term is 66, so 0 isn't a root) whose product is 33 or -33.\n\nLet me first consider the case where the product is 33.

Thus, the least possible value is 14.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the polynomial with integer coefficients, leading coefficient 2, and constant term 66, such that all roots are distinct integers, and the absolute value of the coefficient of \\( x^{n-1} \\) is minimized.\n\n1. **Identify Possible Roots**: The roots must be distinct divisors of 66. The divisors are \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm3, \\pm6, \\pm11, \\pm22, \\pm33, \\pm66 \\).\n\n2. **Vieta's Formula**: The product of the roots is \\( \\pm33 \\) depending on the degree \\( n \\) (even: +33; odd: -33). We need to find a set of distinct roots whose product is \\( \\pm33 \\) and whose sum is minimized.\n\n3. **Minimizing the Sum of Roots**:\n   - For a set of three roots, the product must be -33 (since 3 is odd). Possible combinations include \\( (3, -11, 1) \\) with a sum of \\( -7 \\).\n   - The coefficient \\( a_{n-1} \\) is \\( -2 \\times \\) the sum of the roots. Thus, \\( |a_{n-1}| = 2 \\times | \\text{sum of roots} | \\).\n\n4. **Evaluate Different Combinations**:\n   - The combination \\( (3, -11, 1) \\) yields a sum of \\( -7 \\) and \\( |a_{n-1}| = 14 \\).\n   - Other combinations either yield higher sums or do not satisfy the product requirement.\n\nThus, the least possible value of \\( |a_{n-1}| \\) is 14.\n\n\\boxed{14}"
