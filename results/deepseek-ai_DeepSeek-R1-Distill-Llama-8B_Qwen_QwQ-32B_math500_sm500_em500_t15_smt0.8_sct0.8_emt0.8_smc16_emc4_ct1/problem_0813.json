            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about a polynomial with integer coefficients, and I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}|. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the polynomial is given by:\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\nwith integer coefficients, and the roots are distinct integers. We know that $a_n = 2$ and $a_0 = 66$. The goal is to find the minimal possible |a_{n-1}|.\n\nHmm, since all coefficients are integers and the roots are integers, I recall that the polynomial can be factored as:\n$$f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n)$$\nwhere each $r_i$ is an integer root.\n\nExpanding this, the constant term $a_0$ is equal to $2 \\times (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n$. We know that $a_0 = 66$, so:\n$$2 \\times (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 66$$\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n$$(-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 33$$\nSo, the product of the roots $r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n$ is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n.\n\nNext, I need to factor 33 (and possibly -33) into distinct integers to find possible roots. The integer factors of 33 are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b111, \u00b133.\n\nBut since we have distinct roots, each root must be different. So, the possible sets of roots are limited to these factors without repetition.\n\nI think it would help to factor 33 into its prime factors: 33 = 3 \u00d7 11. But since we need to get the product as 33 or -33, we can distribute the factors among the roots.\n\nWait, since the roots can be positive or negative, but must be integers, let me consider both positive and negative factors. Also, the number of roots, n, is equal to the degree of the"

Since the problem doesn't specify the degree, we can choose the degree as needed to minimize |a_{n-1}|.\n\nThe coefficient $a_{n-1}$ is the coefficient of the x^{n-1} term. In the expanded form, this coefficient is equal to $-2 \\times (r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n)$ multiplied by the leading coefficient. Wait, actually, let me recall Vieta's formula.\n\nVieta's formula says that for a monic polynomial (leading coefficient 1), the coefficient of x^{n-1} is the negative of the sum of the roots. But here, the leading coefficient is 2, so the polynomial is 2*(monic polynomial). Therefore, the coefficient of x^{n-1} would be 2*(-sum of roots). Wait, let me check that again.\n\nSuppose the polynomial is written as 2(x - r1)(x - r2)...(x - rn). Then expanding this, the leading term is 2x^n, and the next term is 2*(- (r1 + r2 + ... + rn))x^{n-1}. Therefore, the coefficient a_{n-1} is -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. So, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: find a set of distinct integers r1, r2, ..., rn such that their product (times (-1)^n) is 33, and the absolute value of their sum is as small as possible. Then, multiply that by 2 to get |a_{n-1}|, and find the minimal such value.\n\nSo, the key is to find such a set of integers with product \u00b133, distinct, and with the smallest possible absolute sum.\n\nFirst, let's note that the product of the roots (times (-1)^n) is 33. Since the roots are integers, their product must be either 33 or -33. Let me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: The product of the roots is 33. Then, (-1)^n must be positive, so n is even.\n\nCase 2: The product of the roots"

For example, -1, -3, -11, -33. Their sum is -48. |sum|=48. Same as above.\n\nAlternatively, can I include 1, -1, 3, -11? Product is (1)(-1)(3)(-11)=33. Sum is 1 -1 +3 -11= -8. |sum|=8. That's much better.\n\nWait, so if n=4, with roots 1, -1, 3, -11, their product is 1*(-1)*3*(-11)=33. Sum is 1 -1 + 3 -11= -8. So |sum|=8, hence |a_{n-1}|=2"

Hmm, that's a big improvement.\n\nWait a second, so by choosing some positive and negative roots, the product can still be positive (since even number of negatives) and the sum can be minimized. That's a good approach.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations.\n\nLet me check if that works.\n\nFor product 33, let's see.\n\nSuppose we take roots: 1, -1, 3, -11. Their product is (1)(-1)(3)(-11) = ( -1*-11)*3*1 = 11*3 = 33. Correct. The sum is (1 -1 + 3 -11)= (0) + (-8) = -8. So absolute value is 8.
