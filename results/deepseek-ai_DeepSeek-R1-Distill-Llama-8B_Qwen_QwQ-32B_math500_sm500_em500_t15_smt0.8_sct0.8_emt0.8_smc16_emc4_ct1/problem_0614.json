Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. Since 98 is also even, I divide by 2 again to get 49.\n\nNext, I need to factorize 49. I recall that 49 is a perfect square and equals 7 multiplied by itself. Therefore, the prime factors of 196 are \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nNow, to find the number of divisors, I will use the formula for the number of divisors based on the exponents of the prime factors. If a number's prime factorization is \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the total number of divisors is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\).\n\nApplying this to 196, the exponents are 2 for both 2 and 7. Adding 1 to each exponent and then multiplying, I get \\((2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\).\n\nTherefore, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors \\(196\\) has, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Prime Factorization of \\(196\\)\n\n1. **Divide by 2**:\n   \\[\n   196 \\div 2 = 98 \\quad \\text{(Even number)}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Divide the result by 2 again**:\n   \\[\n   98 \\div 2 = 49 \\quad \\text{(Still even)}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Factorize \\(49\\)**:\n   \\[\n   49 = 7 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   \nSo, the prime factors of \\(196\\) are:\n\\[\n196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the Formula for Number of Divisors\n\nIf a number \\(N\\) has a prime factorization of the form \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), the total number of positive divisors is given by:\n\\[\n(a + 1) \\times (b + 1)\n\\]\nWhere:\n- \\(a\\) is the exponent of"
