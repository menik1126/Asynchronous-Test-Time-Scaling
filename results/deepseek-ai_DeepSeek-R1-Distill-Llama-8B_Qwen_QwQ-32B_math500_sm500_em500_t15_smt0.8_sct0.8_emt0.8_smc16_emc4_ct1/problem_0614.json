Dividing 196 by 2 gives me 98. \\n\\n\nNext, I'll factorize 98. It's also divisible by 2, so dividing by 2 provides me with 49. \\n\\n\nNow, I'll move on to 49. Recognizing that 49 is a perfect square, I know that 7 multiplied by 7 equals 49. \\n\\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\). \\n\\n\nUsing the formula for finding the number of divisors, which is \\((e_1 + 1) \\times (e_2 + 1) \\times \\ldots \\times (e_n + 1)\\) for each prime factor \\(p_i^{e_i}\\), I can calculate the total number of divisors. \\n\\n\nApplying this to 196, the exponents are 2 for both 2 and 7. Therefore, the number of divisors is \\((2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9\\). \\n\\n\nThus, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the prime factorization of 196.**\n   \n   - 196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2.\n   - \\( 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\)\n   - 98 is also even, so divide by 2 again.\n   - \\( 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\)\n   - 49 is a perfect square. It's \\(7 \\times 7\\).\n\n   So, the prime factors of 196 are:\n   \\[\n   196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Use the formula to find the number of divisors.**\n   \n   The formula for the number of divisors of a number \\(n = p_1^{e_1} \\times p_2^{e_2} \\times \\ldots \\times p_k^{e_k"
