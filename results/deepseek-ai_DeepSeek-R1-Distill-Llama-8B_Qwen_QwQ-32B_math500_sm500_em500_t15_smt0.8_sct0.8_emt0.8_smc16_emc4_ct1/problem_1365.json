            "output": "I need to determine the number of boys attending the math club meeting. There are 35 students in total, and the number of girls is a multiple of 13, with more girls than boys.\n\nFirst, I'll represent the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. So, G + B = 35.\n\nNext, since G is a multiple of 13, possible values for G are 13, 26, or 39. However, since the total number of students is 35, G can't be 39 because that would exceed the total number.\n\nNow, I'll test these possible values:\n\n1. If G = 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. But this would mean there are more boys (22) than girls (13), which contradicts the condition that there are more girls than boys.\n\n2. If G = 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. This satisfies the condition because there are more girls (26) than boys (9).\n\n3. If G = 39, then B would be negative, which isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is when the number of girls is 26 and the number of boys is 9.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students = 35\n- Number of girls (G) is a multiple of 13\n- Number of girls > Number of boys\n\n**Let’s denote:**\n- Number of girls = G\n- Number of boys = B\n\n**We know:**\n1. \\( G + B = 35 \\)\n2. \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13.\n\n**Possible values for \\( G \\):**\nSince \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13, possible values are 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since the total number of students is 35, \\( G \\) can’t be more than 35.\n\n**Testing possible values of \\( G \\):**\n\n1. **If \\( G = 13 \\):**\n   - \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\)\n   - **But this is invalid because girls are not more than boys.**\n\n2. **If \\( G = 26 \\):**\n   - \\( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\)\n   - **This is valid because"
