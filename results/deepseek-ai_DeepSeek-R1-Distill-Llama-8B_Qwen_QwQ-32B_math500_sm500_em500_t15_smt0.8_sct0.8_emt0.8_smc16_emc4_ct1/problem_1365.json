            "output": "I need to find the number of boys at the math club meeting. There are 35 students in total, and the number of girls is a multiple of 13, with more girls than boys.\n\nFirst, I'll denote the number of girls as G and the number of boys as B. Given that G + B = 35 and G > B, I can express B as 35 - G.\n\nSince G is a multiple of 13, the possible values for G are 13, 26, 39, etc. However, since there are only 35 students, G can only be 13 or 26 because 39 is greater than 35.\n\nIf G is 13, then B = 35 - 13 = 22. However, this doesn't satisfy G > B because 13 is not greater than 22.\n\nNext, if G is 26, then B = 35 - 26 = 9. In this case, 26 is greater than 9, so this satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, there are 9 boys at the meeting.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's break down the given information and use algebraic reasoning.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( G \\) represent the number of girls.\n   - Let \\( B \\) represent the number of boys.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - The total number of students is 35.\n   - Therefore, \\( G + B = 35 \\).\n\n3. **Apply the Given Conditions:**\n   - The number of girls \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13.\n   - There are more girls than boys, so \\( G > B \\).\n\n4. **Express Boys in Terms of Girls:**\n   - From the total number of students, we can express \\( B \\) as:\n     \\[\n     B = 35 - G\n     \\]\n   \n5. **Determine Possible Values for \\( G \\):**\n   - Since \\( G \\) is a multiple of 13 and \\( G > B \\), let's find possible values:\n     - If \\( G = 13 \\), then \\( B = 35 - 13 = 22 \\). But \\( 13 > 22 \\) is not true, so this is not valid.\n     - If \\( G = 26 \\), then \\( B = 35 - 26 = 9 \\)."
