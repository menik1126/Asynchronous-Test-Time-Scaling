            "output": "I need to determine the number of possible license plates that can be formed under the given conditions. Each license plate consists of 2 different letters followed by 2 different digits.\n\nFirst, I will consider the letters part of the license plate. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and each letter can be used only once on the license plate. For the first letter, there are 26 possible choices. After choosing the first letter, there are 25 remaining letters to choose from for the second position.\n\nNext, I'll focus on the numbers part of the license plate. There are 10 digits (0 through 9), and each digit must be different from the other. For the first digit, there are 10 possible choices. After selecting the first digit, there are 9 remaining digits to choose for the second position.\n\nTo find the total number of possible license plates, I'll multiply the number of choices for the letters by the number of choices for the digits. This means multiplying 26 (for the first letter) by 25 (for the second letter) and then multiplying 10 (for the first digit) by 9 (for the second digit).\n\nFinally, I'll multiply these two results together to get the total number of possible license plates.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of possible combinations for the letters.**\n- There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.\n- Since we need **2 different letters**, the number of ways to choose the first letter is **26**.\n- After choosing the first letter, there are **25** letters left for the second position.\n  \nSo, the total number of combinations for the letters is:\n\\[ 26 \\times 25 = 650 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of possible combinations for the digits.**\n- There are 10 digits (0 through 9).\n- Since we need **2 different digits**, the number of ways to choose the first digit is **10**.\n- After choosing the first digit, there are **9** digits left for the second position.\n  \nSo, the total number of combinations for the digits is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of possible license plates.**\n- Multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n  \n\\[\n\\"
