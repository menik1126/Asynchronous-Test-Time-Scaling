Each license plate consists of 2 different letters followed by 2 different digits.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of possible combinations for the letters. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and since the order doesn't matter for the letters, I'll use combinations: C(26, 2).\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of possible combinations for the digits. There are 10 digits (0-9), and again, since the order doesn't matter, I'll use combinations: C(10, 2).\n\nFinally, to find the total number of license plates, I'll multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll consider each part of the license plate separately and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 different letters from 26.**\n\nSince the order of the letters doesn't matter, we'll use combinations:\n\\[\nC(26, 2) = \\frac{26!}{2!(26-2)!} = \\frac{26 \\times 25}{2} = 325\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 different digits from 10.**\n\nSimilarly, we'll use combinations for the digits:\n\\[\nC(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations to find the total number of license plates.**\n\\[\n325 \\times 45 = 14625\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{14625}\n\\]"
