            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where a matrix M transforms one vector to another and another vector to another. I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under matrix M. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that applying a matrix to a vector is like a linear transformation. So, if I can figure out what the matrix M looks like, I can then apply it to the entire line y = 2x + 1. But wait, how do I find the matrix M from the given transformations?\n\nI think I can set up equations based on the column space of M. Let me denote the transformation of a vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}\\) as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a x + b y \\\\ c x + d y \\end{pmatrix}\\). So, M would be \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nGiven that M takes \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) to \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\), that gives us the equations:\n- \\(9 = 2a - b\\)\n- \\(3 = 2c - d\\)\n\nSimilarly, M takes \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) to \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\), so:\n- \\(7 = a - 3b\\)\n- \\(-1 = c - 3d\\)\n\nNow I have four equations:\n1. \\(2a - b = 9\\)\n2. \\(2c - d = 3\\)\n3. \\(a - 3b = 7\\)\n4. \\(c - 3d = -1\\)\n\nI can solve for a and b using equations 1 and 3. Let's do that first.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\(2a - b = 9\\). Let's solve for b: \\(b = 2a - 9\\).\n\nFrom equation 3: \\(a - 3b = 7\\). Substitute b from equation 1 into equation 3:\n\n\\(a - 3(2a - 9) = 7"

Therefore, the first column of M is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)... wait, no. Wait, a and b are the coefficients in the transformation, so the first column is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ ? \\end{pmatrix}\\). Hmm, actually, wait. Let me correct that.\n\nEarlier, I set the transformation as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a x + b y \\\\ c x + d y \\end{pmatrix}\\). So the columns of M are \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\begin{pmatrix} b \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}\\). So, with a = 4, b = -1, but I still need to find c and d.\n\nLooking back at equations 2 and 4:\n\nFrom equation 2: \\(2c - d = 3\\). Solve for d: \\(d = 2c - 3\\).\n\nFrom equation 4: \\(c - 3d = -1\\). Substitute d from equation 2 into equation 4:\n\n\\(c - 3(2c - 3) = -1\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(c - 6c + 9 = -1\\)\n\n\\(-5c + 9 = -1\\)\n\n\\(-5c = -10\\)\n\n\\(c = 2\\)\n\nNow, plug c = 2 into equation 2 to find d:\n\n\\(2(2) - d = 3\\)\n\n\\(4 - d = 3\\)\n\n\\(-d = -1\\)\n\n\\(d = 1\\)\n\nSo, c = 2 and d = 1. So the second column is \\(\\begin{pmatrix"

If I apply M to the first vector (2, -1):\n\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1) = 8 + 1 = 9, which matches.\n\n4*2 + (-1)*(-1) = 9, and 2*2 + 1*(-1) = 4 -1 = 3. Correct.\n\nFor the second vector (1, -3):\n\n4*1 + (-1)*(-3) = 4 + 3 = 7, which is correct.\n\n2*1 + 1*(-3) = 2 - 3 = -1. Correct.\n\nGood, so M is correctly found.\n\nNow, to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under M. So, I need to find all points (x, y) that satisfy y = 2x + 1, then apply M to them, and see what the resulting y is.\n\nBut instead of doing it for each point, which isn't practical, I can parametrize the line and apply the transformation.\n\nLet me express the line in parametric form. Let x = t, then y = 2t + 1. So, any point on the line can be written as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} t \\\\ 2t + 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nApply M to this point:\n\nM * \\(\\begin{pmatrix} t \\\\ 2t + 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) = \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 4t + (-1)(2t + 1) \\\\ 2t + (1)(2t + 1) \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: 4t - 2t - 1 = 2t - 1\n\nSecond component: 2t + 2t + 1 = 4t + 1\n\nSo, the transformed point is \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 2t - 1 \\\\ 4t + 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\nSo, in terms"

Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the image is a line, so Y in terms of X is a linear equation, which makes sense because M is linear and the original line is linear.\n\nLet me verify with a specific point.
