Hmm, I'm not entirely sure how to approach this, but I remember that when a matrix transforms a point, it can also transform lines. So maybe I can figure out where the line maps by looking at how M affects points on the line.\n\nFirst, let me recall that if I have a line y = mx + b, then applying a matrix transformation should result in another line. But how exactly does that work? I think I can represent the line as a set of points and then apply the matrix to each point, but since it's a line, maybe I can find a transformation of the line itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the image of two points on the line y = 2x + 1 and then find the equation of the line passing through those images. That might be simpler because I know how the matrix transforms specific points. Let me try that.\n\nThe given line is y = 2x + 1. So I can choose two points on this line. Let me pick x = 0 and x = 1 for simplicity. \n\nWhen x = 0, y = 2*0 + 1 = 1. So the point is (0, 1).\n\nWhen x = 1, y = 2*1 + 1 = 3. So the point is (1, 3).\n\nOkay, so now I have the points (0,1) and (1,3). I need to apply the matrix M to both of these points to get their images.\n\nBut wait, how do I apply the matrix M? The problem statement says that M takes a specific vector to another vector. It's not given explicitly, so maybe I need to find M.\n\nWait, maybe I don't need to find M itself, but instead can use the action of M on the given vectors to create equations and solve for M. Then, once I have M, I can apply it to the points on the line.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [a  b]\n      [c  d]\n\nSo, M multiplied by a vector [x; y] gives [a*x + b*y; c*x + d*y].\n\nGiven that M takes the vector [2; -1] to [9; 3]. So:\n\na*2 + b*(-1"

Let's do the same.\n\nFirst equation from first vector:\n\n2c - d = 3 --- (3)\n\nSecond equation from the second vector:\n\nc - 3d = -1 --- (4)\n\nSolve for c and d.\n\nLet me solve equation (3) for d:\n\n2c -3 = d\n\nSo d = 2c - 3\n\nSubstitute into equation (4):\n\nc -3*(2c -3) = -1\n\nExpand:\n\nc -6c +9 = -1\n\nCombine terms:\n\n-5c +9 = -1\n\nSubtract 9:\n\n-5c = -10\n\nDivide by -5:\n\nc=2\n\nThen d= 2*2 -3 =4-3=1\n\nSo c=2 and d=1\n\nTherefore, the matrix M is:\n\n[4   -1]\n[2    1]\n\nLet me check"

Now I need to find the image of the line y=2x+1 under M.\n\nI can do this by applying M to two points on the line y=2x+1, then finding the equation of the line connecting the images.\n\nEarlier, I chose the points (0,1) and (1,3). Let's apply M to these.\n\nFirst, point (0,1):\n\nM * [0;1] = [4*0 + (-1)*1; 2*0 +1*1] = [ -1;1 ]\n\nSecond, point (1,3):\n\nM * [1;3] = [4*1 + (-1)*3; 2*1 +1*3] = [4-3=1; 2+3=5]\n\nSo, images are (-1,1) and (1,5).\n\nNow, I can find the equation of the line passing through (-1,1) and (1,5).\n\nFirst, compute the slope m:\n\nm = (5 -1)/(1 - (-1)) = (4)/(2) = 2\n\nSo the slope is 2.\n\nNow, using point-slope form. Let's use point (-1,1):\n\ny -1 = 2(x - (-1)) => y -1 = 2(x +1)\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = 2x +2 +1 => y=2x+3\n\nWait, let me verify with the other point (1,5):\n\ny =2*1 +3=5, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the image of the line y=2x+1 under M is y=2x+3.\n\nWait, but is that the only way? Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of transformation of the equation itself.\n\nSo, another method: suppose I have a line y=2x+1. Let me apply the transformation M to the variables"

Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nBut perhaps, more carefully, the transformation takes (x, y) to (x', y') = M*(x; y).\n\nSo, if I have a line y = mx + b, then after transformation, the image line will satisfy y' = m' x' + b', where m' and b' can be found based on M.\n\nBut since M is a linear transformation, perhaps I can find the inverse of M and then substitute?\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nIf I have the equation y = 2x +1, and I want to find y' in terms of x'.\n\nSince y' = M*y and x' = M*x, because M is a linear transformation. But wait, M is not diagonal, so that's not quite correct.\n\nWait, no, the variables are transformed as (x', y') = M*(x, y)^T.\n\nSo, to express y' in terms of x', we can maybe solve for y' from the transformation.\n\nBut this could get tricky because M is not necessarily invertible? Wait, but in this case, since M is a 2x2 matrix, is it invertible? Let's check its determinant.\n\ndet(M) = (4)(1) - (-1)(2)=4 +2=6\u22600. So it's invertible.\n\nSo, since M is invertible, we can express y' in terms of x'.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider the linear transformation on variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nx' = 4x - y\n\ny' = 2x + y\n\nSo, from the original variables x and y, the transformed variables x' and y' are given by these equations.\n\nBut we have the original line y = 2x +1.\n\nI can try to express x and y in terms of x' and y', and then substitute into the original equation.\n\nSo, let's solve for x and y:\n\nFrom y' = 2x + y => y = y' - 2x.\n\nSubstitute into x' =4x - y:\n\nx' =4x - (y' -2x) =4x - y' +2x=6x - y'\n\nSo,\n\nx"
