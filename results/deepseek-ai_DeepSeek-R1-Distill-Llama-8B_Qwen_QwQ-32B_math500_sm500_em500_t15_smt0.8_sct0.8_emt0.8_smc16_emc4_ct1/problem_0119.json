            "output": "To convert the binary number 10101001110 to base eight, I first need to determine how many digits the result will have. Since 8 is 2 cubed, a binary number with n digits will require up to 3 bits to represent it in octal.\n\nNext, I'll divide the binary number into groups of three bits starting from the right. The given binary number is 10101001110, which has 11 digits. Dividing into threes, I get:\n- 101\n- 010\n- 011\n- 10\n\nThe last group has only two bits, so I'll need to pad it with a leading zero to make it three bits: 010.\n\nNow, I'll convert each binary triplet to its corresponding octal value:\n- 101\u2082 = 5\u2088\n- 010\u2082 = 2\u2088\n- 011\u2082 = 3\u2088\n- 010\u2082 = 2\u2088\n\nFinally, I'll combine these octal digits to get the final base eight representation: 5322\u2088.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\( 10101001110_2 \\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Groups:**\n   - Since \\( 8 = 2^3 \\), divide the binary number into groups of three bits from the right.\n   - \\( 10101001110_2 \\) has 11 bits. Dividing into groups of three:\n     ```\n     101 010 011 10\n     ```\n   - Pad the last group with a leading zero to make it three bits:\n     ```\n     101 010 011 010\n     ```\n\n2. **Convert Each Group to Octal:**\n   - \\( 101_2 = 5_8 \\)\n   - \\( 010_2 = 2_8 \\)\n   - \\( 011_2 = 3_8 \\)\n   - \\( 010_2 = 2_8 \\)\n\n3. **Combine the Octal Digits:**\n   - Concatenate the converted values:\n     ```\n     5\\,2\\,3\\,2_8\n     ```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5322_8}\n\\]"
