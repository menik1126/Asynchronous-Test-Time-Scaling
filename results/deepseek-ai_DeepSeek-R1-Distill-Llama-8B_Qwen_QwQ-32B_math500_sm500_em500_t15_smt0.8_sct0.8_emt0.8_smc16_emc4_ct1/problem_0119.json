            "output": "To convert the binary number 10101001110 to base eight, I first need to determine the number of digits in the binary number. There are 11 digits in total.\n\nNext, I divide the binary number into groups of three bits starting from the right. The binary number split into groups is 101, 010, 011, and 10. However, the last group 10 has fewer than three bits, so I pad it with two zeros making it 010.\n\nAfter grouping, I convert each three-bit group into its decimal equivalent:\n- 101 in binary is 5 in decimal.\n- 010 in binary is 2 in decimal.\n- 011 in binary is 3 in decimal.\n- 010 in binary is 2 in decimal.\n\nFinally, I combine these decimal values: 5, 2, 3, and 2. This gives the base eight representation as 53 2. Therefore, the binary number 10101001110 in base two is equal to 532 in base eight.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo convert the binary number \\(10101001110_2\\) to base eight, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Bits in Binary:**\n   - The binary number has **11** bits.\n\n2. **Split the Binary Number into Groups of Three Bits:**\n   - Starting from the right, split the binary number into groups of three bits each.\n   - \\(101 \\, 010 \\, 011 \\, 10\\)\n\n3. **Pad the Last Group with Leading Zeros to Make It Three Bits:**\n   - The last group has only two bits. Pad it with one leading zero to make it three bits.\n   - \\(101 \\, 010 \\, 011 \\, 010\\)\n\n4. **Convert Each Binary Group to Decimal:**\n   - \\(101_2 = 5_{10}\\)\n   - \\(010_2 = 2_{10}\\)\n   - \\(011_2 = 3_{10}\\)\n   - \\(010_2 = 2_{10}\\)\n\n5. **Combine the Decimal Values to Get the Octal Equivalent:**\n   - Combine the decimal equivalents of each three-bit group:\n   - \\(5 \\, 2 \\, 3 \\, 2\\)\n\n6. **Write the Final Octal Number:**\n   - Concatenate the decimal values to form the oct"
