            "output": "To determine how far Bill is from his starting point, I'll start by analyzing the movements in each direction separately.\n\nBill first walks 1/2 mile south. Since south is the downward direction, this will increase his southern distance.\n\nNext, he walks 3/4 mile east. East is the rightward direction, so this adds to his eastern distance.\n\nThen, he walks another 1/2 mile south. I'll add this to the existing southern distance.\n\nAfter calculating the total distance walked in each direction, I'll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from the starting point. The formula is the square root of the sum of the squares of the east and south distances.\n\nFinally, I'll convert the result into a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\n</think>\n\nSure, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem:**\nBill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south, then \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east, and finally \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south. How many miles is he, in a direct line, from his starting point? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine the Total Southward Distance:**\n   - Bill walks \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south.\n   - Then, he walks another \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) mile south.\n   - **Total Southward Distance:** \\(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1\\) mile.\n\n2. **Determine the Eastward Distance:**\n   - Bill walks \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile east.\n   - **Total Eastward Distance:** \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) mile.\n\n3. **Calculate the Straight-Line Distance Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   - The straight-line distance from the starting point can be found using the right triangle formed by the eastward and southward distances.\n   - **Formula:** \\( \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Eastward Distance})^2 + (\\text{Southward Distance})^2} \\)\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 + (1)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{"
