            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem: I need to combine these four terms\u2014\u221a2, 1/\u221a2, \u221a3, and 1/\u221a3\u2014into a single fraction in the form (a\u221a2 + b\u221a3)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and c is as small as possible. Then, I have to find the sum of a, b, and c. \n\nHmm, let me think. First, I remember that expressions with square roots can sometimes be combined by finding a common denominator. Since we have denominators with \u221a2 and \u221a3, maybe I can combine the terms with similar radicals first.\n\nLet me break it down. There are two terms with \u221a2: \u221a2 and 1/\u221a2. Similarly, there are two terms with \u221a3: \u221a3 and 1/\u221a3. So, I can combine the \u221a2 terms and the \u221a3 terms separately.\n\nStarting with the \u221a2 terms: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2. To add these, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 1 and \u221a2. The common denominator would be \u221a2. So, I'll convert \u221a2 to \u221a2/1, and then add the two fractions:\n\n\u221a2/1 = (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/\u221a2 = 2/\u221a2. Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe I should represent \u221a2 as \u221a2/1 and 1/\u221a2 as is, then add them together.\n\nSo, \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 = (\u221a2 * \u221a2 + 1) / \u221a2. Because \u221a2 * \u221a2 is 2, so that would be (2 + 1)/\u221a2 = 3/\u221a2.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check again. \u221a2 is equal to \u221a2/1, and 1/\u221a2 is already over \u221a2. So, to add them, I can write \u221a2 as (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/\u221a2, which is 2/\u221a2. Then, adding 1/\u221a2 gives (2 + 1)/\u221a2 = 3/\u221a2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the \u221a3 terms: \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3. Applying the same method, I can write \u221a3 as \u221a3/1 and 1/\u221a3 as is."

            "output": " So, to add them, express \u221a3 as (\u221a3 * \u221a3)/\u221a3 = 3/\u221a3. Then, adding 1/\u221a3 gives (3 + 1)/\u221a3 = 4/\u221a3.\n\nAlright, so now the original expression simplifies to 3/\u221a2 + 4/\u221a3. But this is still two fractions with square roots in the denominator. I need to combine them into a single fraction.\n\nTo do that, I need a common denominator for \u221a2 and \u221a3. The denominators are \u221a2 and \u221a3, which are irrational and not multiples of each other. The least common denominator (LCD) for \u221a2 and \u221a3 would be \u221a2 * \u221a3, which is \u221a6. So, I can rewrite both fractions with the denominator \u221a6.\n\nFirst, for 3/\u221a2: To convert the denominator to \u221a6, I multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a3. So, 3/\u221a2 becomes (3\u221a3)/(\u221a2 * \u221a3) = 3\u221a3/\u221a6.\n\nSimilarly, 4/\u221a3 becomes (4\u221a2)/(\u221a3 * \u221a2) = 4\u221a2/\u221a6.\n\nNow, adding these together: 3\u221a3/\u221a6 + 4\u221a2/\u221a6 = (3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2)/\u221a6.\n\nHmm, that's progress. But the problem wants the denominator to be as small as possible, which is a rational number. So, I need to rationalize the denominator here. Currently, the denominator is \u221a6, which is irrational. To rationalize, I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by \u221a6.\n\nSo, multiplying numerator: (3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2) * \u221a6. Let's compute that:\n\nFirst, 3\u221a3 * \u221a6 = 3 * \u221a(3*6) = 3 * \u221a18 = 3 * (3\u221a2) = 9\u221a2.\n\nSecond, 4\u221a2 * \u221a6 = 4 * \u221a(2*6) = 4 * \u221a12 = 4 * (2\u221a3) = 8\u221a3.\n\nAdding those together: 9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3.\n\nNow, the denominator: \u221a6 * \u221a6 = 6.\n\nSo, after rationalizing, the entire expression becomes (9\u221a2 + 8"

            "output": "\u221a3)/6.\n\nLet me double-check my steps:\n\n1. Combined \u221a2 terms: \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 = 3/\u221a2.\n2. Combined \u221a3 terms: \u221a3 + 1/\u221a3 = 4/\u221a3.\n3. Converted both fractions to have denominator \u221a6:\n   - 3/\u221a2 = 3\u221a3/\u221a6\n   - 4/\u221a3 = 4\u221a2/\u221a6\n4. Added them: (3\u221a3 + 4\u221a2)/\u221a6\n5. Rationalized the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \u221a6:\n   - Numerator: 3\u221a3 * \u221a6 = 9\u221a2, 4\u221a2 * \u221a6 = 8\u221a3\n   - Denominator: \u221a6 * \u221a6 = 6\n6. Result: (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6\n\nIs there a way to have a smaller c? Let me see. The denominator after the first combination was \u221a6, and after rationalizing, it's 6. I don't think it can be simplified further because 6 is a rational number, and \u221a6 is irrational. So, 6 is the smallest possible c.\n\nTherefore, the expression is (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6. So, a is 9, b is 8, and c is 6. Adding them together: 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.\n\nWait, but let me just verify if I did all the multiplications correctly when I multiplied by \u221a6.\n\nStarting with 3\u221a3 * \u221a6: \u221a3 * \u221a6 is \u221a18, which is 3\u221a2. So, 3\u221a3 * \u221a6 = 3 * 3\u221a2 = 9\u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, 4\u221a2 * \u221a6: \u221a2 * \u221a6 is \u221a12, which is 2\u221a3. So, 4\u221a2 * \u221a6 = 4 * 2\u221a3 = 8\u221a3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnd 9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3 is the numerator, and the denominator is 6.\n\nSo, final expression is (9\u221a2 + 8\u221a3)/6. So, a=9, b=8, c=6. Sum is 23.\n\nI don't think I made"
