Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that both the circle and the parabola are equations in the coordinate plane, so visualizing them might help. The circle is centered at the origin with a radius of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), right? Because the equation is \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\), so yeah, radius squared is 2, so radius is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nNow, the parabola is given by \\( y^2 = 8x \\). I remember that the standard form of a parabola that opens to the right is \\( y^2 = 4px \\), where \\( p \\) is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Comparing that to our equation, \\( 4p = 8 \\), so \\( p = 2 \\). That means the vertex of the parabola is at the origin (0,0), and it opens to the right with the focus at (2,0). Okay, so far so good.\n\nThe problem states that there are two common tangents, which form four points of tangency. These points form a quadrilateral, and I need to find its area. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the coordinates of these four points where the tangents touch both the circle and the parabola.\n\nI think the strategy here is to find the equations of the common tangents first. Once I have the equations of these tangents, I can find their points of intersection with both the circle and the parabola. Then, with those four points, I can plot them or figure out their coordinates and then calculate the area of the quadrilateral.\n\nSo, let me recall how to find the common tangents to two curves. Since both the circle and the parabola are given, I can try to find the equations of the lines that are tangent to both.\n\nLet me denote the equation of a line as \\( y = mx + c \\). Since it's a tangent to both the circle and the parabola, it must satisfy the condition of"

Differentiating both sides with respect to x:\n\n2y dy/dx = 8 => dy/dx = 4/y. \n\nSo, the slope of the tangent at any point (x,y) on the parabola is 4/y. For a horizontal tangent, the slope must be zero, so 4/y = 0, which implies y approaches infinity, which is impossible. Therefore, the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\) does not have any horizontal tangents.
