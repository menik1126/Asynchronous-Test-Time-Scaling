The problem mentions that there are two common tangents, forming four points of tangency. I need to figure out where these points are and then calculate the area of the quadrilateral they form.\n\nFirst, I remember that common tangents to two curves are lines that touch both curves at exactly one point each. Since there are two common tangents, each tangent will touch the circle once and the parabola once, resulting in four points of tangency in total.\n\nI need a systematic way to find these tangent lines. One approach is to find the equations of the common tangents to both the circle and the parabola. Once I have the equations of these lines, I can find their points of tangency on both curves.\n\nLet me start with the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\). The equation of a tangent line to a circle at a point \\((x_1, y_1)\\) on the circle is \\( xx_1 + yy_1 = r^2 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius. Here, the radius is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), so the tangent equation becomes \\( xx_1 + yy_1 = 2 \\).\n\nNow, for the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\), I recall that the general equation of a tangent line at a point \\((at^2, 2at)\\) is \\( ty = x + at^2 \\). But here, the parabola is \\( y^2 = 8x \\), so comparing to the standard form \\( y^2 = 4ax \\), we have \\( 4a = 8 \\), so \\( a = 2 \\). Therefore, the tangent line at point \\((2t^2, 4t)\\) is \\( ty = x + 2t^2 \\).\n\nSo, the tangent line to the parabola can be written as \\( ty = x + 2t^2 \\).\n\nNow, since we are looking for common tangents, the tangent lines to both the circle and the parabola must coincide. So, the equation of the tangent"

Hmm, seems like my points are different. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The Asymptote code shows points A=(-1,1), B=(2,4), C=(-1,-1), D=(2,-4). So, these are four points, but the tangents from the circle are at (-1,1) and (-1,-1), and from the parabola, maybe (2,4) and (2,-4). Hmm, that makes sense because the parabola is symmetric about the x-axis, so the points (2,4) and (2,-4) are symmetric.\n\nSo, perhaps I was only finding the upper half, but let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, from the parabola, the tangent points would be at (2t^2, 4t). So, when y is positive, t is positive, and when y is negative, t is negative.\n\nSo, in my previous approach, I found that the tangent points on the circle are (-1,1) and (-1,-1). Let me confirm if this is consistent with the Asymptote code. Yes, the code has points (-1,1), (-1,-1), (2,4),"

Wait, actually, each common tangent touches both the circle and the parabola, so each tangent has two points of tangency, one on each curve. Since there are two common tangents, that gives four points total. So, the four points are two on the circle and two on the parabola, but each tangent line has one on each.\n\nTherefore, the quadrilateral is formed by connecting these four points. The Asymptote code draws lines between A and B, C and D, and also between A and C, B and D, forming a quadrilateral. The points are (-1,1), (2,4), (-1,-1), (2,-4). So, connecting these points would form a quadrilateral.\n\nBut let me get back to the problem. The user wants me to find the area of the quadrilateral formed by these four points. So, perhaps I can just use the coordinates given in the Asymptote code? But maybe I should verify them through calculation.\n\nWait, the Asymptote code is just an illustration, but the problem might not exactly use those coordinates. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed step by step to find the four points of tangency.\n\nLet me try again. Let me consider the common tangent lines. Let me denote a general tangent line to the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\). The equation of a tangent to this parabola can be written as \\( y = mx + 2/m \\), since for a parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\), the tangent is \\( y = mx + a/m \\). Here, a = 2, so it's \\( y = mx + 2/m \\).\n\nWait, that might be a better way. Let me recall that for the parabola \\( y^2 = 4ax \\), the tangent in slope form is \\( y = mx + a/m \\). So here, since it's \\( y^2 = 8x \\), which is \\( y^2 = 4*2x \\), so a = 2, so the tangent is \\( y = mx + 2/m \\).\n\nSimilarly, the tangent to the circle"

The condition for a line to be tangent to a circle is that the distance from the center to the line equals the radius.\n\nThe circle has center at (0,0) and radius \\( \\sqrt{2} \\). The distance from (0,0) to the line \\( y = mx + c \\) is |0 - 0 + c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) ) = |c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = sqrt(2). Therefore, |c| = sqrt(2) * sqrt(m^2 + 1). So, c = ± sqrt(2(m^2 + 1)).\n\nBut since the tangent line must also be equal to the tangent line to the parabola, which is \\( y = mx + 2/m \\), so c must equal 2/m.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n2/m = sqrt(2(m^2 + 1))\n\nLet me square both sides to remove the square root:\n\n(2/m)^2 = 2(m^2 + 1)\n\n4/m^2 = 2m^2 + 2\n\nMultiply both sides by m^2:\n\n4 = 2m^4 + 2m^2\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n2 = m^4 + m^2\n\nSo, the equation is m^4 + m^2 - 2 = 0.\n\nLet me set u = m^2, so:\n\nu^2 + u - 2 = 0\n\nSolving for u:\n\nu = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [-1 ± 3]/2\n\nSo, u = 1 or u = -2.\n\nSince u = m^2 must be non-negative, u = 1.
