            "output": "I need to determine how far Bill is from his starting point after his walk. First, I'll calculate the total distance he walked south and east separately.\n\nBill walked 1/2 mile south and then another 1/2 mile south, making a total of 1 mile south. He also walked 3/4 mile east.\n\nSince his movements are in a plane, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the straight-line distance from his starting point. The eastward distance (3/4 mile) is one leg of the right triangle, and the southward distance (1 mile) is the other leg.\n\nApplying the formula:\ndistance = √(eastward² + southward²)\ndistance = √((3/4)² + (1)²)\ndistance = √(9/16 + 16/16)\ndistance = √(25/16)\ndistance = 5/4 miles\nConverting 5/4 to a decimal gives 1.25 miles.\n\nSo, Bill is 1.25 miles away from his starting point.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find out how far Bill is from his starting point in a direct line.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Total Distance Walked South\nBill walks:\n- \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n- Then another \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) mile south.\n- Total southward distance = \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\) mile.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Eastward Distance\nBill walks:\n- \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) mile east.\n\n### Step 3: Use Pythagorean Theorem to Find Direct Line Distance\nThe straight-line distance from the starting point can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Here, the eastward distance is one leg (\\( a \\)) and the southward distance is the other leg (\\( b \\)).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 + (1)^2} \n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{16} + 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{\\frac"
