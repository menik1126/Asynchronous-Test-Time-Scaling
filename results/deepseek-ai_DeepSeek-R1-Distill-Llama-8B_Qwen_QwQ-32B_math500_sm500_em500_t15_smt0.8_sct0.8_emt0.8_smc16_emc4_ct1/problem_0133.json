            "output": "Okay, so I need to find the units digit of 4$$, where the superfactorial is defined as a tower of factorials. That is, n$$ = n!^(n!^...^n!) with n factorials. So for 4$$, it's 4!! = 4!^(4!^4!). Hmm, that sounds complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a factorial is. 4! is 4\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71, which is 24. So the innermost part of the superfactorial is 4!, which is 24. So 4$$ starts with 24. Now, the next part is exponentiation. So we have 24 raised to the power of something. Wait, no, actually, in the superfactorial definition, it's n! raised to the power of another superfactorial. So for 4$$, it's 4!^(4!^4!). Let me write that out: 4! is 24, then 4!^4! is 24^24, and then 4!! is 24^(24^24). So the units digit of 4!! is the units digit of 24^(24^24). \n\nBut exponentiating a number to a power often follows cycles in the units digit. For example, powers of 24 cycle every certain number. Let me think: 24^1 is 24, units digit 4. 24^2 is 576, units digit 6. 24^3 is 24\u00d724\u00d724, which is 13824, units digit 4 again. So the units digit cycles every 2: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc.\n\nSo if I can find the exponent modulo 2, I can find where it lands. But wait, the exponent here is (24^24). Hmm, so 24^24 is a huge number, but I need to find the exponent modulo the cycle length, which is 2. So let's find (24^24) mod 2.\n\nBut 24 is divisible by 2, so 24 mod 2 is 0. Then 24^24 mod 2 is also 0, because any number ending with 0 raised to any power remains ending with 0. Wait, but that's"

            "output": " mod 2. So 24^24 mod 2 is 0. \n\nWait, but the cycle length for the units digit of 24^k is 2. So the exponent's parity (even or odd) will determine the units digit. Since the exponent is 24^24, which is even, so exponent mod 2 is 0. Since the cycle is 2, then exponent mod 2 is 0, so we take the second term in the cycle. The cycle is 4,6,4,6... so when exponent is even (since exponent is 24^24 which is even), then exponent mod 2 is 0, so the units digit would be the second term, which is 6?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me think of the exponent as k = 24^24. The units digit of 24^k depends on k mod 2 because the cycle length is 2. Since 24 is even, any exponent of it is even, so k is even. Therefore, k mod 2 is 0. Since the cycle is 2, when the exponent is even, the units digit is 6. So the units digit of 24^(even number) is 6. \n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4$$ is 6? Hmm, but wait, maybe I need to check more carefully. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the exponent modulo \u03c6(10), where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function, since we're dealing with units digit (mod 10). Wait, maybe I should approach this using modular arithmetic more formally.\n\nThe units digit is equivalent to the number mod 10. So we need to compute 24^(24^24) mod 10. \n\nEuler's theorem says that if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n. But 24 and 10 are not coprime, since they share a common factor of 2. So Euler's theorem doesn't apply here. Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with mod 10, we can split it into mod 2 and mod 5 and use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively,"

So 24^(anything) mod 10 is equivalent to 4^(anything) mod 10.\n\nSo the problem simplifies to finding 4^(24^24) mod 10.\n\nNow, let's analyze 4^k mod 10. The units digit of 4^k cycles every 2: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc. So the cycle length is 2. So to find where k falls in this cycle, we need k mod 2.\n\nSince 4 and 10 are not coprime, Euler's theorem doesn't directly apply, but we can see that 4^1 mod 10 = 4, 4^2 mod 10 =6, 4^3 mod10=4, etc. So 4^k mod10 is 4 when k is odd, 6 when k is even.\n\nTherefore, the units digit depends on whether k is even or odd, where k is 24^24.\n\nNow, 24 is even, so 24^24 is even. Any power of an even number is even, so k is even. So k mod 2 is 0. Thus, 4^(even) mod10=6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4$$ is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. The exponent in 4^(24^24) is a huge number, but because the cycle length is 2, we only need to know if it's even or odd. Since 24 is even, 24^24 is even, so exponent is even, units digit is 6.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the units digit of \\(4\\$\\$, we start by simplifying the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Simplify the Superfactorial**:\n   - \\(4\\$\\$ = 4!^{4!^{4!}}\\).\n   - Calculate \\(4! = 24\\).\n\n2. **Innermost Exponent**:\n   - The innermost exponent is \\(4!^{4!} = 24^{24}\\).\n\n3. **Simplify \\(24^{24}\\) Modulo 2**:\n   - Since \\(24\\) is even, any power of \\(24\\) is also even"
