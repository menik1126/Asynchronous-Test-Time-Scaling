I know that \\(256\\) is \\(2^8\\), so \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) becomes \\(2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n\nNow, the equation simplifies to \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: \\(2x = 4\\).\n\nFinally, I'll solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides by 2, which gives \\(x = 2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express both sides with the same base**:\n   \n   Notice that \\(256\\) can be written as a power of \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   256 = 2^8\n   \\]\n   \n   Therefore, \\(256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   256^{\\frac{1}{2}} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4 = 16\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the equation now is:\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 16\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Set the exponents equal to each other**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same (\\(2\\) in both cases), you can set the exponents equal to solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Solve for \\(x\\)**:\n   \n   Divide both sides of the equation by \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Final Answer**:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{2}\n   \\]"
