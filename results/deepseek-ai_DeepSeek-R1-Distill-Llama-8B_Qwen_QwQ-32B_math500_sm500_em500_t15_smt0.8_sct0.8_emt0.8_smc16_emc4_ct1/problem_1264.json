            "output": "I need to solve the equation 2^{2x} = 256^{1/2} for x.\n\nFirst, I recognize that both sides of the equation are powers of 2, which makes it easier to compare the exponents directly.\n\nNext, I'll express 256 as a power of 2. Since 2^8 = 256, I can rewrite the equation as 2^{2x} = (2^8)^{1/2}.\n\nApplying the power of a power property, (2^8)^{1/2} becomes 2^{8*(1/2)}, which simplifies to 2^4.\n\nNow the equation is 2^{2x} = 2^4. Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, 2x = 4.\n\nFinally, solving for x by dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express 256 as a power of 2:**\n   \n   \\(256 = 2^8\\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the equation using this power:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = \\left(2^8\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the power of a power property \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"
