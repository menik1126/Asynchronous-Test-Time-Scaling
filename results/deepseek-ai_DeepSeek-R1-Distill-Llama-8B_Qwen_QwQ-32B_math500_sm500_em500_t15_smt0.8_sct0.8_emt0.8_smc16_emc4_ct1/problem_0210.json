The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nFor the smallest circle with a radius of 4:\nA\u2081 = \u03c0 \u00d7 4\u00b2 = 16\u03c0.\n\nFor the medium circle with a radius of 6:\nA\u2082 = \u03c0 \u00d7 6\u00b2 = 36\u03c0.\n\nFor the largest circle with a radius of 7:\nA\u2083 = \u03c0 \u00d7 7\u00b2 = 49\u03c0.\n\nNext, I'll identify the regions X, Y, and Z based on the diagram. Region X appears to be the area inside the smallest circle, so its area is A\u2081 = 16\u03c0.\n\nRegion Y is between the smallest and medium circles, so its area is A\u2082 - A\u2081 = 36\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = 20\u03c0.\n\nRegion Z is between the medium and largest circles, so its area is A\u2083 - A\u2082 = 49\u03c0 - 36\u03c0 = 13\u03c0.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the difference between the largest and smallest areas. The largest area is A\u2083 = 49\u03c0, and the smallest area is A\u2081 = 16\u03c0.\nDifference = 49\u03c0 - 16\u03c0 = 33\u03c0.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll calculate the areas of the three regions based on the given radii and then determine the difference between the largest and smallest areas.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the areas of the circles.**\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n- **Smallest Circle (Radius = 4):**\n  \\[\n  A_X = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\n  \\]\n  \n- **Medium Circle (Radius = 6):**\n  \\[\n  A_Y = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\n  \\]\n  \n- **Largest Circle (Radius = 7):**\n  \\[\n  A_Z = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the areas of regions \\( X \\), \\( Y \\), and \\( Z \\).**\n\n- **Region \\( X \\):** This is the area inside the smallest circle.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of"
