The areas between these circles form three distinct regions labeled \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\). We need to determine the difference between the area of the region with the greatest area and the area of the region with the smallest area.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Areas of the Circles\nThe area of a circle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\n- **Innermost Circle (Region Z):**\n  \\[\n  A_Z = \\pi \\times (4)^2 = 16\\pi\n  \\]\n- **Middle"
