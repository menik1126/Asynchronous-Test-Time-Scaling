The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr².\n\nFor the smallest circle with a radius of 4:\nA₁ = π × 4² = 16π.\n\nFor the medium circle with a radius of 6:\nA₂ = π × 6² = 36π.\n\nFor the largest circle with a radius of 7:\nA₃ = π × 7² = 49π.\n\nNext, I'll identify the regions X, Y, and Z based on the diagram. Region X appears to be the area inside the smallest circle, so its area is A₁ = 16π.\n\nRegion Y is between the smallest and medium circles, so its area is A₂ - A₁ = 36π - 16π = 20π.\n\nRegion Z is between the medium and largest circles, so its area is A₃ - A₂ = 49π - 36π = 13π.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the difference between the largest and smallest areas. The largest area is A₃ = 49π, and the smallest area is A₁ = 16π.\nDifference = 49π - 16π = 33π.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we'll calculate the areas of the three regions based on the given radii and then determine the difference between the largest and smallest areas.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the areas of the circles.**\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\pi r^2\n\\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius.\n\n- **Smallest Circle (Radius = 4):**\n  \\[\n  A_X = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi\n  \\]\n  \n- **Medium Circle (Radius = 6):**\n  \\[\n  A_Y = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi\n  \\]\n  \n- **Largest Circle (Radius = 7):**\n  \\[\n  A_Z = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine the areas of regions \\( X \\), \\( Y \\), and \\( Z \\).**\n\n- **Region \\( X \\):** This is the area inside the smallest circle.\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of"
