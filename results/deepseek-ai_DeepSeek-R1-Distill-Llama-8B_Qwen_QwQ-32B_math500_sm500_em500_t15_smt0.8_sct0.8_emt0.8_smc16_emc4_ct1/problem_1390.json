Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that applying a matrix to a vector is a linear transformation. So, when we apply M to a line, the image should also be a line because linear transformations map lines to lines. Cool, so the image will be another straight line, which I need to express in the form y = mx + b.\n\nBut how do I find that line? I have some specific points before and after transformation, but the line given isn't necessarily transformed point by point. Maybe I can figure out more about the matrix M?\n\nWait, the problem gives me two specific transformations:\n- M takes [2; -1] to [9; 3]\n- M takes [1; -3] to [7; -1]\n\nHmm, so if I can write down these transformations as equations, maybe I can solve for M or at least find some properties of M that will help me transform the line.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\nM = [a  b;\n     c  d]\n\nSo, applying M to [2; -1] gives [9; 3], which gives the system:\n2a + (-1)b = 9\n2c + (-1)d = 3\n\nSimilarly, applying M to [1; -3] gives [7; -1], so:\n1a + (-3)b = 7\n1c + (-3)d = -1\n\nSo now I have four equations:\n1. 2a - b = 9\n2. -2c - d = 3 (Wait, 2c + (-1)d = 3, so 2c - d = 3)\n3. a - 3b = 7\n4. c - 3d = -1\n\nHmm, okay, so I can solve this system to find a, b, c, d.\n\nLet me write them cleaner:\nEquation (1): 2a - b = 9\nEquation (3): a - 3b = 7\n\nAnd for c and d:\nEquation (2): 2c - d = 3\nEquation (4): c - 3d ="

So now I have the matrix M.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the image of the line y = 2x +1 under M.\n\nHmm, how do I do that? Well, the line can be parametrized as all points (x, y) where y = 2x +1. So, any point on the line can be written as (t, 2t +1) where t is a parameter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the line in terms of vectors.

Let me denote a general point on the line as (x, y) = (x, 2x +1). So, expressing this as a vector [x; y] = [x; 2x +1].\n\nBut to apply M, I need a vector, so let me write it as:\n\nLet me write the point as [x; y] = [x; 2x +1] = [x; 2*(x) +1]\n\nI can think of this as [x; 2x +1] = [1*x + 0; 2*x + 1]\n\nSo, in matrix form, this is [x; 2x +1] = [1 0; 2 1] * [x; 1].

Let me check:\n\n[1 0; 2 1] * [x; 1] = [x; 2x +1]. Yes, exactly. So, that's a way to write the line as a product of a matrix and a vector. Interesting.\n\nBut how does that help in applying M? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can represent the line as a vector equation, and then see how M acts on it. Let me consider that.\n\nWait, the image of the line under M will be the set of all M*v where v is on the line. So, mathematically, Image(M) ∩ Line = { M*v | v ∈ Line }.\n\nSo, if I can find two points on the line, apply M to them, and then find the equation of the line connecting those images, that should work.\n\nBut the problem with this approach is that I don't"

Since the original line is not a subspace (because it's not through the origin), the image will be a line or a point. But since the transformation is linear, the image of a line not through the origin will be a line or a point. But since the transformation is invertible? Wait, is M invertible?\n\nLet me check the determinant of M. The determinant is (4)(1) - (-1)(2) = 4 +2 =6 ≠0. So M is invertible, so it maps lines to lines.\n\nTherefore, the image will be a line. So, if I can find two points on the original line, apply M to them, then find the equation of the line through those two points, that should be the image.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more algebraic way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the line, apply M to the parametrization, then eliminate the parameter to get the equation.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me parametrize the line y = 2x +1. Let me let x = t, so y = 2t +1. So the parametrization is:\n\nv(t) = [t; 2t +1]\n\nThen, the image under M is M*v(t) = [4 -1; 2 1] * [t; 2t +1]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst component: 4*t + (-1)*(2t +1) = 4t -2t -1 = 2t -1\n\nSecond component: 2*t +1*(2t +1) = 2t +2t +1 =4t +1\n\nSo the image point is [2t -1; 4t +1]\n\nSo, if I let the image coordinates be (X, Y), then:\n\nX = 2t -1\n\nY =4t +1\n\nNow, to find the equation relating X and Y, I can eliminate the parameter t.\n\nFrom the first equation, X = 2t -1 => 2t = X +1 => t = (X +1)/2\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\nY =4*( (X +1)/2 ) +1 = 2*(X +"

Let me check with specific points.\n\nSo, take a point on the original line, say when t=0: (0,1). Apply M:\n\nM*[0;1] = [0*4 +1*(-1); 0*2 +1*1] = [-1;1]\n\nWait, but according to the image, when t=0, X =2*0 -1 = -1, Y =4*0 +1=1. So that point is (-1,1), which is on y=2x +3: 1=2*(-1) +3 =>1=-2 +3 =>1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother point: t=1. (1,3). Apply M:\n\nM*[1;3] =4*1 + (-1)*3=4 -3=1; 2*1 +1*3=2 +3=5. So (1,5). According to image line, when t=1, X=2*1 -1=1, Y=4*1 +1=5. So (1,5). Which is on y=2x +3? 2*1 +3=5. Yes.\n\nAnd another point: t=2. (2,5). M*[2;5] =4*2 + (-1)*5=8 -5=3; 2*2 +1*5=4 +5=9. So (3,9).

So, the image line is y=2x +3.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me try another point from the parametrization, maybe t= -1.\n\nOriginal point: (-1, -1).

Which is on y=2x +3: 2*(-3) +3= -6 +3= -3. Correct.\n\nSo all the points I have checked so far lie on y=2x +3.\n\nTherefore, even though I didn't know the exact matrix beforehand, by parametrizing the line and applying M, I could find the image.\n\nAlternatively, another method is: since M is applied to the entire line, the image will be the line spanned by M*v, where v is a direction vector of the original line.\n\nWait, original line y=2x +1 has direction vector (1,2). So, compute M*(1,2):\n\nM*[1;2] = [4*1 + (-1)*2; 2*1 +1*2] = [4 -2; 2 +2] = [2;4]\n\nSo, direction vector is [2;4], which can be simplified to [1;2] by dividing by 2.\n\nSo, the image line has direction vector [1;2], which is same as the original direction vector, just scaled.\n\nWait, but the point mapped from a point on the original line: let's say we take the point (0,1). As before, it maps to (-1,1). So line passes through (-1,1) and has direction vector [1;2].\n\nSo, to write the equation, let me use point-slope form.\n\nThe line through (-1,1) with slope 2:\n\ny -1 =2(x +1)\n\ny=2x +2 +1\n\ny=2x +3.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to do it: compute the direction vector, compute the image of a point on the original line, then find the equation.\n\nEither way, I get the same line y=2x +3.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe image of the line under the transformation is \\"
