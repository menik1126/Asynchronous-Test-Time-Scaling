            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about matrix transformations. A matrix M transforms the vector (2, -1) to (9, 3) and (1, -3) to (7, -1). I need to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under this transformation. Hmm, not too bad, but I need to figure out how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a matrix transformation can be represented as M times a vector. So, if I can find the matrix M, I can apply it to any vector, including those on the line y = 2x + 1. But wait, the problem doesn't give me M directly. It gives me two specific transformations. So, I need to determine M from the given information.\n\nLet me denote the matrix M as:\n\nM = [ [a, b],\n       [c, d] ]\n\nSo, M is a 2x2 matrix with entries a, b, c, d. When I multiply M by the vector (2, -1), I get (9, 3). Similarly, multiplying M by (1, -3) gives (7, -1). So, I can set up two equations based on these transformations.\n\nFirst transformation:\nM * [2; -1] = [9; 3]\n\nSo,\n\na*2 + b*(-1) = 9 --> 2a - b = 9\nc*2 + d*(-1) = 3 --> 2c - d = 3\n\nSecond transformation:\nM * [1; -3] = [7; -1]\n\nSo,\n\na*1 + b*(-3) = 7 --> a - 3b = 7\nc*1 + d*(-3) = -1 --> c - 3d = -1\n\nNow, I have four equations:\n\n1) 2a - b = 9\n2) 2c - d = 3\n3) a - 3b = 7\n4) c - 3d = -1\n\nI need to solve this system of equations for a, b, c, d. Let me solve for a and b first, then for c and d.\n\nStarting with equations 1 and 3:\n\nFrom equation 3: a = 7 + 3b\n\nPlug this into equation 1:\n\n2*(7"

That's correct.\n\nSecond transformation:\n\nM * [1; -3] = 4*1 + (-1)*(-3) = 4 + 3 = 7, and 2*1 + 1*(-3) = 2 - 3 = -1. That's also correct. Okay, so M is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the image of the line y = 2x + 1 under the transformation M. Hmm. So, I need to find all points (x, y) on the line y = 2x + 1 such that when they are transformed by M, they land somewhere in the plane. But I think the image of the line under M would be another line, unless the line is mapped to a point or something, but since M is linear, it should map"

So, it's going to be another line, probably y = mx + b.\n\nTo find the image, I can parametrize the original line and apply M to each point, then find the equation of the transformed points.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to find the image of two points on the line, then find the equation of the line passing through those images.\n\nSo, let me try this approach.\n\nFirst, pick two points on the line y = 2x + 1.\n\nLet me choose x = 0: y = 2*0 + 1 = 1.

Yes, it is.\n\nAnother point: x = -1, y = 2*(-1)+1 = -2 +1 = -1. Point (-1, -1).\n\nApply M:\n\n4*(-1) - (-1) = -4 +1 = -3\n2*(-1) + (-1) = -2 -1 = -3\n\nSo, M*(-1, -1) = (-3, -3)\n\nCheck if (-3, -3) is on y = 2x +3.\n\nLeft side: y = -3\n\nRight side: 2*(-3) +3 = -6 +3 = -3\n\nYes, it is.\n\nSo, all these points check out, which makes me confident that y = 2x +3 is the correct image of the line y=2x +1 under M.\n\nAlternatively, another way to do this is by using the formula for the image of a line under a linear transformation.

So, the answer is y =2x +3.\n\nWait, but let me check again with another method just to be thorough. Maybe using the direction vector of the line and the point.\n\nThe original line is y =2x +1. Its direction vector is (1, 2), since the slope is 2. The direction vector can be represented as a vector along the line, so for each step in x, y increases by 2.\n\nThe transformation matrix M will transform the direction vector (1,2) into M*(1,2). Let me compute that:\n\nM*(1,2) = [4*1 -2, 2*1 +2] = (4 -2, 2 +2) = (2,4). So, the direction vector after transformation is (2,4), which simplifies to (1,2). Wait, so the direction"
