The area is expressed in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime. Then, I have to find \\( a + b + p \\).\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by thinking about how to approach this equation. It's a quartic equation, which can be challenging, but maybe I can factor it or recognize a pattern.\n\nLooking at the equation: \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). Hmm, the coefficients involve \\( i \\), which suggests that maybe substituting \\( z \\) with some expression involving \\( i \\) might help. Since the coefficients are symmetric in a way, but not entirely.\n\nWait, maybe this is a quadratic in disguise. If I let \\( w = z + a \\), where \\( a \\) is some constant, perhaps I can transform the equation into a quadratic form. Let me try that.\n\nLet me try substituting \\( w = z + c \\), where \\( c \\) is a constant to be determined. Then, \\( z = w - c \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( z = w - c \\) into the equation:\n\n\\( (w - c)^4 + 4(w - c)^3 i - 6(w - c)^2 - 4(w - c)i - i = 0 \\)\n\nThat seems complicated, but maybe if I choose \\( c \\) such that the coefficients of \\( w^4 \\) and other terms disappear or become manageable.\n\nAlternatively, another method: maybe factor by grouping. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the equation \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\), perhaps I can arrange the terms as follows:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\)\n\nLet me group the first two terms and the last three terms:\n\n\\( (z^4 +"

The expansion of \\( (z + i)^4 \\) has a constant term of 1, but the given equation has a constant term of -i. So, if I subtract \\( (1 + i) \\) from \\( (z + i)^4 \\), would that give me the equation?\n\nLet me check:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 - (1 + i) = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z +1 -1 -i = z^4 +4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i \\)\n\nYes! That's exactly the given equation. So the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\)\n\nOh, that's a big simplification! So the equation is \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\).

Therefore, \\( z = -i + \\sqrt[4]{1 + i} \\).\n\nSo, to find the solutions, I need to find the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\).\n\nTo compute the fourth roots, let me express \\( 1 + i \\) in polar form.\n\n\\( 1 + i \\) is in the first quadrant, with magnitude \\( \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\) and angle \\( \\pi/4 \\) radians.\n\nThus, \\( 1 + i = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4} + i \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) \\).\n\nSo, the fourth roots will have magnitude \\( (\\sqrt{2})^{1/4} = (2^{1/2})^{1/4} = 2^{1/8} \\), and angles \\( \\frac{\\pi/4 + 2k\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\), where \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the fourth roots are:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{2}^{1/8} \\left[ \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\right) + i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\right) \\right] \\), for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\).\n\nBut wait, that was for the fourth roots of \\( 1 + i \\). Since \\( (z + i)^4 = 1 + i \\), so \\( z + i = \\) each of these fourth roots, so \\( z = -i + \\) each fourth root.\n\nThus, the solutions \\( z \\) are:\n\n\\( z_k = -i + \\sqrt{2}^{1/8} \\left[ \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\right) + i \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\right) \\right] \\"

Since each of these is a fourth root, they should form a rectangle or a square in the complex plane. Wait, because the fourth roots would be equally spaced around a circle, but shifted by \\( -i \\).\n\nWait, if I consider all the fourth roots as points on a circle with radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\), centered at the origin, but each is rotated by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\). So, these four points are equally spaced around the circle, but starting at an angle of \\( \\pi/16 \\) instead of 0.\n\nTherefore, when I subtract \\( i \\) (which is equivalent to adding \\( -i \\)), each point is shifted downward by \\( i \\). But since all the roots are points on a circle, shifting them by \\( -i \\) is like translating the entire figure down by 1 unit in the complex plane.\n\nSo, in the complex plane, the four solutions form a square rotated by \\( \\pi/16 \\) with respect to the origin, whose center is at \\( -i \\). Hmm, no, wait. The center was at the origin before shifting, but after shifting each point by \\( -i \\), the center becomes \\( -i \\). So, the center is at \\( (0, -1) \\) in the complex plane.\n\nWait, actually, before shifting, the four roots are at angles \\( \\pi/16, 5\\pi/16, 9\\pi/16, 13\\pi/16 \\), each with radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\). So, they form a square inscribed in a circle of radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\). When we subtract \\( i \\), each point is moved down by 1 unit. Therefore, the figure is a square, but centered at \\( (0, -1) \\), with each vertex located at a distance \\( 2^{1/8} \\) from the center.\n\nWait, no. The shift is a translation; the shape remains congruent, just moved.\n\nSo, the four points form a square with side length \\( s \\), and the radius (distance from center to each vertex) is \\("

Then, the area is \\( s^2 = 2 r^2 \\). So, if the distance from center to vertex is \\( r \\), then area is \\( 2r^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, in this case, the radius is \\( 2^{1/8} \\), so area would be \\( 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2*(2^{1/4}) = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4} \\). But wait, but this is before the shift. However, shifting the square doesn't change its area, so the area remains the same. Therefore, the area would be \\( 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The original roots (before shifting by -i) form a square centered at the origin with radius \\( 2^{1/8} \\). Then, shifting all points by -i (i.e., moving the center to (0, -1)) doesn't change the area. So the area is indeed \\( 2*(2^{1/8})^2 = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nBut let me check the calculation again.

Is the shape a square?\n\nYes, because the four roots are equally spaced around the circle, each at 90-degree intervals, so when connected, they form a square. So shifting them by a constant vector doesn't change the square's shape; it just translates it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the area by another method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinates of the points.\n\nLet me compute each root \\( z_k \\).\n\nGiven that \\( z_k = -i + \\sqrt{2}^{1/8} e^{i(\\pi/16 + k\\pi/2)} \\), for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\).\n\nSo, each \\( z_k \\) is:\n\n\\( z_k = -i + 2^{1/8} \\left( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right) + i \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) \\).\n\nSo, in terms of coordinates, each \\( z_k = x_k + i y_k \\), where:\n\n\\( x_k = 2^{1/8} \\cos\\left(\\theta_k\\right) \\),\n\n\\( y_k = 2^{1/8} \\sin\\left(\\theta_k\\right) - 1 \\).\n\nHere, \\( \\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{16} + \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\).\n\nSo, for each \\( k \\):\n\n- \\( k = 0 \\): \\( \\theta_0 = \\pi/16 \\)\n- \\( k = 1 \\): \\( \\theta_1 = \\pi/16 + \\pi/2 = 9\\pi/16 \\)\n- \\( k = 2 \\): \\( \\theta_2 = \\pi/16 + \\pi = 17\\pi/16 \\)\n- \\( k = 3 \\): \\( \\theta_3 = \\pi/16 + "
