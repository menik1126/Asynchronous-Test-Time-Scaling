Hmm, the problem says the solutions form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon, which can be expressed in a certain form. Then, I have to find \\(a + b + p\\). Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the equation: it's a quartic equation in \\( z \\). Quartic equations can be tough, but sometimes they can be factored into quadratics or even linear terms. The coefficients are complex, which might make it tricky, but maybe there's a pattern or substitution that can simplify things.\n\nLet me write down the equation again:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \\).\n\nHmm, I notice that the coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. That kind of reminds me of the expansion of a binomial, maybe something like \\( (z + a)^4 \\), but with complex coefficients. Wait, actually, the coefficients 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i are similar to the coefficients of \\( (iz -1)^4 \\) or something like that. Let me check.\n\nIf I let \\( w = iz \\), then \\( z = -iw \\). Let me substitute that in. Then, \\( z^4 = (-iw)^4 = w^4 \\). Similarly, \\( z^3 = (-iw)^3 = -i^3 w^3 = -i w^3 \\). Wait, \\( i^3 = -i \\), so it's \\( -(-i)w^3 = i w^3 \\). Let me compute each term:\n\n1. \\( z^4 = (-iw)^4 = (i^4)(w^4) = (1)w^4 = w^4 \\).\n2. \\( 4i z^3 = 4i (-iw)^3 = 4i (-i^3 w^3) \\). Since \\( i^3 = -i \\), this becomes \\(4i (i w^3) = 4i^2 w^3 = 4(-"

The constant term is \\( -i \\).\n\nSo putting all together, substituting into the original equation:\n\n\\( w^4 -4w^3 +6w^2 -4w -i =0 \\).\n\nHmm, so \\( w^4 -4w^3 +6w^2 -4w -i = 0 \\).\n\nWait, the first four terms look like \\( (w - 1)^4 \\) because the coefficients 1, -4, 6, -4 are the binomial coefficients for expanding \\( (w -1)^4 \\). But \\( (w -1)^4 = w^4 -4w^3 +6w^2 -4w +1 \\). Comparing, the original equation after substitution is \\( (w -1)^4 -1 -i =0 \\). Wait:\n\n\\( (w -1)^4 = (w^4 -4w^3 +6w^2 -4w +1) \\). Therefore, if I subtract 1 from that, I get the first four terms, but here we have minus i. So:\n\n\\( (w -1)^4 -1 -i =0 \\implies (w -1)^4 = 1 + i \\).\n\nAh! That's a good step! So substituting \\( w = iz \\), we transformed the equation into \\( (w -1)^4 = 1 +i \\). So then, solving for \\( w \\), we have:\n\n\\( w -1 = \\sqrt[4]{1 +i} \\cdot \\zeta_4^{k} \\), where \\( \\zeta_4 \\) is a 4th root of unity, and k = 0,1,2,3.\n\nBut first, we need to compute the fourth roots of \\(1 +i \\).

Then, when transformed back to z via \\( z = -i w \\), which is a rotation and scaling, so the polygon should also be a regular polygon? Wait, but the center is shifted.\n\nWait, let me think again. The roots \\( w \\) are located at points \\( 1 + r e^{i \\theta_k} \\), where \\( \\theta_k = \\pi/16 + \\pi k /2 \\). So the center of the circle is at 1 (in the w-plane), and the four points are on a circle of radius \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\), each separated by 90 degrees (since \\( \\theta_{k+1} - \\theta_k = \\pi/2 \\)), but starting at an angle of \\( \\pi/16 \\).\n\nTherefore, in the w-plane, the four points form a square rotated by \\( \\pi/16 \\) from the axes, centered at (1,0) in the w-plane. Then, when we transform to z via \\( z = -i w \\), which is a rotation by \\( -\\pi/2 \\) (since multiplying by -i is equivalent to rotating by -90 degrees) and scaling? Wait, no scaling, since it's just a multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1.\n\nWait, multiplying by -i is a rotation by -90 degrees. So the entire figure in the w-plane is rotated by -90 degrees to get to the z-plane. The center at w =1 (which is (1,0) in the w-plane) becomes z = -i *1 = (0, -1)"

Since rotation doesn't change the shape, just the orientation, so the four points still form a square.\n\nWait, so if the w-plane has four points forming a square, then after rotating them by -90 degrees, they still form a square, just rotated by an additional -3\u03c0/16. So in the z-plane, the polygon is a square, with side length depending on the distance between points.\n\nBut is the square in the w-plane centered at (1,0) with radius 2^{1/8}, so the distance between consecutive points is the length of the chord corresponding to angle \u03c0/2 on a circle of radius 2^{1/8}.

If the four points form a square, then the distance between each adjacent pair is the same, which we saw is r\u221a2.\n\nBut wait, in 2D geometry, if the four points form a square, the distance between each adjacent pair is equal, the diagonals are equal, and angles are right angles. So yes, if in the w-plane the points form a square, then in the z-plane, since we rotated them, they still form a square with the same side lengths.\n\nThus, the area of the square is (side length)^2 = (r\u221a2 )\u00b2 = 2 r\u00b2.\n\nGiven that r = 2^{1/8}, so r\u00b2 = 2^{1/4} = \u221a[4]{2}.\n\nThus, area = 2 * 2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4} = 2^{5/4}.\n\nBut wait, 2^{5/4} can be written as \\( 2^{5/4} = \\sqrt[4]{32} \\). But 32 is 16*2, which is 2^5. So 2^{5/4} = (2^{1/4})^5, but perhaps more importantly, express it as \\( p^{a/b} \\). Here, 2 is prime, so p=2, a=5, b=4. Thus, a and b are relatively prime.\n\nTherefore, the area is \\( 2^{5/4} \\), so a=5, b=4, p=2, so a + b + p= 5 +4 +2=11.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me just make sure.\n\nWait, actually"

            "output": ", hold on. Wait, the area of a square is side length squared. The side length here is r\u221a2, so squared is (r\u221a2)^2 = 2 r\u00b2. Since r = 2^{1/8}, so r\u00b2 = 2^{1/4}, so 2 * 2^{1/4} = 2^{1 + 1/4} = 2^{5/4}, which is indeed 2^(5/4). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^(5/4), so expressed as p^{a/b} with p=2, a=5, b=4, so a+b+p=11.\n\nBut let me check again if the polygon is indeed a square. Since in the w-plane, the four points are equally spaced on a circle, separated by 90 degrees, so they form a square. Then, when rotated by -90 degrees (multiplying by -i), the square is rotated but remains a square. The center is shifted, but the shape remains a square. So the area is preserved under rotation and translation, so the area is indeed the same as in the w-plane.\n\nWait, but actually, the center is shifted, but the square's side length is the same, so area is same. So yes, the area is 2^{5/4}, so the answer is 5+4+2=11.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Wait, in the w-plane, the square is centered at (1,0), but when transformed to z-plane, the center is at (0, -1). The square is rotated, but the side length is preserved. So the area is indeed the same as in the w-plane. So the area is 2^{5/4}, so the answer is 11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the side length calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nIn the w-plane, the distance between two adjacent vertices is |w\u2081 - w\u2080| = r * sqrt(2). Wait, how did I get that?\n\nWait, when I calculated the difference between e^{i9\u03c0/16} and e^{i\u03c0/16}, I found that the magnitude was sqrt(2). So the distance between w\u2080 and w\u2081 is r * sqrt(2). Therefore, the side length is r*sqrt"

With r=2^{1/8}, so 2*(2^{1/8})\u00b2 = 2*(2^{1/4}) = 2^{1 +1/4}=2^{5/4}.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the area is 2^{5/4}, so the answer is 5 +4 +2=11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). The solutions to this equation form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane. We need to find the area of this polygon.\n\nFirst, we recognize that the equation can be transformed by substituting \\( w = iz \\), leading to the equation \\( (w - 1)^4 = 1 + i \\). Converting \\( 1 + i \\) to polar form, we find it has a modulus of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and an argument of \\( \\pi/4 \\). The fourth roots of this complex number are given by \\( 2^{1/8} e^{i (\\pi/16 + \\pi k/2)} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\).\n\nEach root \\( w \\) is then converted back to \\( z \\) using \\( z = -iw \\). This transformation rotates and translates the roots in the complex plane. The roots form a square in the \\( w \\)-plane, which is then rotated by -90 degrees in the \\( z \\)-plane.\n\nThe side length of the square in the \\( w \\)-plane is \\( r \\sqrt{2} \\), where \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\). The area of the square is therefore \\( (r \\sqrt{2})^2 = 2r^2 \\). Substituting \\( r = 2^{1/8} \\), we find the area is \\( 2 (2^{1/8})^2 = 2 \\cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{5/4} \\).\n\nExpressing the area in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), we identify \\( p = 2 \\),"
