This ratio will help me determine how close each grade is to the target of 135%.\n\nAfter calculating the ratios, I'll compare them to 135% to see which one is the closest.\n\nFinally, the grade with the ratio closest to 135% will be the answer.\n</think>\n\nLet's determine which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to \\(135\\%\\) of the number of female bus riders.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe need to find the grade \\(g\\) where:\n\\[\n\\text{Male\\_percentage}_g \\approx 1.35 \\times \\text{Female\\_percentage}_g\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate for Each Grade\nWe'll compute \\( \\text{Male\\_percentage}_g / \\text{Female\\_percentage}_g \\) for each grade and see how close it is to \\(1.35\\).\n\n#### 9th Grade\n\\[\n\\frac{41.1}{39.4} \\approx 1.043\n\\]\n\\(1.043\\) is closest to \\(1.35\\).\n\n#### 10th Grade\n\\[\n\\frac{34.4}{33.1} \\approx 1.038\n\\]\n\\(1.038\\) is closest to \\(1.35\\).\n\n#### 11th Grade\n\\[\n\\frac{20.6}{13.8} \\approx 1.492\n\\]\n\\(1.492\\) is closer to \\(1.35\\) than the other ratios.\n\n#### 12th Grade\n\\[\n\\frac{11.6}{8.6} \\approx 1.348\n\\]\n\\(1.348\\) is closest to \\(1.35\\).\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nThe \\(12^{\\text{th}}\\) grade has the percentage of male bus riders closest to \\(135\\%\\) of the female bus riders.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12^{\\text{th}} \\text{ grade}}\n\\]"
