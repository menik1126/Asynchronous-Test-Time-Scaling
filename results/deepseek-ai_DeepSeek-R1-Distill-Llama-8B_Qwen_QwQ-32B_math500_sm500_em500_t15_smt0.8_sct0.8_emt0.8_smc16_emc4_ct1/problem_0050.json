Find the grade where this percentage is closest to the male bus riders count.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate 135% of Female Bus Riders\nFor each grade, calculate 135% of the female bus riders (\\(1.35 \\times F\\)) and compare it to the males (\\(M\\)).\n\n\\[\n\\text{Target Male Percentage} = 1.35 \\times F\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute for Each Grade\n\n#### **1. 9th Grade**\n- \\(F = 39.4\\%\\)\n- **Target"
