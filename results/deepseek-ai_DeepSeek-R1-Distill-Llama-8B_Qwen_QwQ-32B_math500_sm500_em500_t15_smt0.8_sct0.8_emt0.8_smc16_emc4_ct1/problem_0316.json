            "output": "Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the sum of a vertical asymptote, another vertical asymptote, and a horizontal asymptote for the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x -14). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't zero there too. So, I should probably factor the denominator to find those points. The denominator is x² - 5x -14. Let me try factoring that. Hmm, I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Let's see,  -7 and 2? Yeah, because -7 * 2 = -14 and -7 + 2 = -5. So, the denominator factors into (x - 7)(x + 2). \n\nSo, the function becomes f(x) = (2x)/[(x - 7)(x + 2)]. Now, vertical asymptotes are at the zeros of the denominator, so x = 7 and x = -2. That means a = 7 and b = -2. Wait, but the problem says vertical asymptotes x = a and x = b, so a and b are 7 and -2. I'll note that down: a = 7, b = -2.\n\nNext up is the horizontal asymptote. I think horizontal asymptotes depend on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. Since this is a rational function, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the higher degree of the numerator or the denominator. \n\nLooking at the function, the numerator is degree 1 (2x) and the denominator is degree 2 (x² - 5x -14). Since the degree of the denominator is higher, I think the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. But wait, am I remembering that right? Yeah, when the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c should be 0.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I were to divide both numerator and denominator by the highest power of x in the denominator, which is x², then:\n\nf(x) = (2x)/(x²(1 - 5/x -14/x²)) = (2/x)/(1 - 5/x"

            "output": " -14/x²). As x approaches infinity or negative infinity, the terms with x in the denominator go to zero, so f(x) approaches 0. So, yeah, y = 0 is the horizontal asymptote.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, sometimes when the degrees are equal, we use the ratio of leading coefficients. Here, since the degree of the denominator is higher, it doesn't matter; we still get y = 0. So, I'm confident that c = 0.\n\nNow, adding them up: a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0. Let's calculate that: 7 - 2 is 5, and 5 + 0 is 5. So, the sum should be 5. Is that all? I don't think I've missed anything.\n\nWait a second, vertical asymptotes—should I check the values in the numerator at x =7 and x = -2? For x=7, numerator is 2*7=14, which isn't zero, so x=7 is indeed a vertical asymptote. Similarly, at x=-2, numerator is 2*(-2)=-4, which is also not zero. So, both are vertical asymptotes. So, a and b are correctly identified.\n\nAnd for the horizontal asymptote, as x approaches infinity, let's test with some big numbers. If x is 1000, then f(x) is approximately 2*1000/(1000^2) = 2000/1000000 = 0.002, which is close to zero. Similarly, x = -1000: f(x) is about -2000/(1000000) = -0.002, also approaching zero. So, the horizontal asymptote makes sense.\n\nI think that's all. So, a=7, b=-2, c=0, and their sum is 5. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \\) has vertical asymptotes where the denominator is zero, which are \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\), and a horizontal asymptote at \\( y = 0 \\). Thus, \\( a = 7 \\), \\( b = -2 \\), and \\( c = 0 \\). Summing these"
