            "output": "To convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, I first need to determine its prime factors.\n\nI start by factoring both the numerator and the denominator. The number 57 can be broken down into 3 and 19, while 160 can be factored into \\(2^5 \\times 5\\).\n\nThis gives the fraction in its simplest form: \\(\\frac{3 \\times 19}{2^5 \\times 5}\\).\n\nNext, I check the prime factors to see if they have distinct prime factors other than 2 or 5. In this case, both 3 and 19 are primes, so they are distinct from 2 and 5.\n\nSince there are other prime factors (3 and 19), the decimal representation will not terminate. This is because a terminating decimal only occurs when the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5 after simplifying the fraction.\n\nTherefore, the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) cannot be converted into a terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) can be expressed as a terminating decimal, we need to examine its prime factors.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the Numerator and Denominator**\n\\[\n57 = 3 \\times 19\n\\]\n\\[\n160 = 2^5 \\times 5\n\\]\nSo, the fraction can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n\\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{3 \\times 19}{2^5 \\times 5}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Prime Factors**\nThe denominator consists of the prime factors \\(2\\) and \\(5\\), while the numerator introduces additional prime factors \\(3\\) and \\(19\\).\n\n**Step 3: Determine Terminating Decimal Conditions**\nA fraction will result in a terminating decimal if, after simplifying, the denominator has no prime factors other than \\(2\\) and \\(5\\).\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nSince the numerator introduces prime factors \\(3\\) and \\(19\\), which are not \\(2\\) or \\(5\\), the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) cannot be simplified to have a denominator with only \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) as prime factors. Therefore, the decimal representation will not terminate.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{57}{160} \\text{ cannot be expressed as a terminating decimal"
