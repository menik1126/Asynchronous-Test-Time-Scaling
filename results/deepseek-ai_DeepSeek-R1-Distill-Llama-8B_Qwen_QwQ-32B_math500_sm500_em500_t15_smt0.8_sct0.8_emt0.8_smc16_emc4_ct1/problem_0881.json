            "output": "First, I need to determine if the denominator of the fraction, which is 160, has prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\nBreaking down 160,\\n160 = 2 × 80,\\n80 = 2 × 40,\\n40 = 2 × 20,\\n20 = 2 × 10,\\n10 = 2 × 5.\n\nSo, 160 can be expressed as 2⁵ × 5¹.\n\nNext, I'll adjust the fraction by making the denominator a power of 10. To do this, I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same factor that will convert the denominator into 10^n.\n\nThe denominator currently is 2⁵ × 5¹. To make it a power of 10, I'll multiply both numerator and denominator by 2⁵ to get rid of the 5 in the denominator.\n\nSo, the new fraction becomes:\\n(57 × 2⁵) / (160 × 2⁵) = (57 × 32) / 1000.\n\nCalculating the numerator: 57 × 32 = 1824.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is now 1824 / 1000.\n\nFinally, I'll divide 1824 by 1000 to convert it into a decimal.\n\n1824 divided by 1000 equals 1.824.\n\nThe decimal terminates after four places, so 57/160 as a terminating decimal is 1.824.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the Denominator**:\n   - The denominator is 160.\n   - Prime factorization: \\(160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\\).\n\n2. **Adjust the Fraction**:\n   - To make the denominator a power of 10, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \\(2^5\\).\n   - \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = \\frac{57 \\times 2^5}{160 \\times 2^5} = \\frac{57 \\times 32}{1000} = \\frac{1824}{1000}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert to Decimal**:\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n   \\[\n   1824 \\div 1000 = 1.824\n   \\]\n\n4. **"
