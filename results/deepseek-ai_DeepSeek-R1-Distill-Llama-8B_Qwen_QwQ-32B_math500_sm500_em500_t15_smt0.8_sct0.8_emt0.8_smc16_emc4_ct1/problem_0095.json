Since 3.6 is between 3 and 4, the ceiling of 3.6 is 4. \n\nThen, I'll compute the square of that ceiling value, which is 4\u00b2 = 16. \n\nFinally, I'll subtract this squared ceiling from the squared value of 3.6: 12.96 - 16.\n\nThis gives me -3.04, but since the problem likely expects a positive result, I need to reconsider the steps. \n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the correct evaluation leads to 12.96 - 16 = -3.04. \n\nHowever, if we consider the absolute difference, it's 3.04. \n\nBut the precise mathematical answer is -3.04.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the expression \\(\\lceil (3.6)^2 \\rceil - (\\lceil 3.6 \\rceil)^2\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate \\( (3.6)^2 \\):**\n   \\[\n   (3.6)^2 = 3.6 \\times 3.6 = 12.96\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the ceiling of \\( 3.6 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\lceil 3.6 \\rceil = 4\n   \\]\n   (Since \\( 3.6 \\) is not an integer, the ceiling function rounds it up to the nearest integer, which is \\( 4 \\).)\n\n3. **Calculate the square of the ceiling of \\( 3.6 \\):**\n   \\[\n   (4)^2 = 16\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the squared ceiling from the squared value:**\n   \\[\n   \\lceil (3.6)^2 \\rceil - (\\lceil 3.6 \\rceil)^2 = 13 - 16 = -3\n   \\]\n   (Note: The ceiling of \\( 12.96 \\) is \\( 13 \\).)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{-3}\n\\]"
