            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about bus riders at Central H.S., and I need to figure out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the table gives me the percentage of males and females who are bus riders for each grade. They've also mentioned that 300 males and 300 females were surveyed in each grade. That's helpful because it tells me the sample size for each grade, which is 600 students in total per grade.\n\nSo, my goal is to find out for each grade whether the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders. That means, for each grade, I'll calculate the number of males and females who are bus riders, then see what 135% of the female number is, and whether it's closest to the male number.\n\nWait, but hold on. Since the percentages are given, and the total number surveyed is 300 males and 300 females in each grade, I can calculate the actual number of male and female bus riders for each grade.\n\nLet me write this down step by step.\n\nFor each grade, the total number of students surveyed is 300 males + 300 females = 600 students.\n\nSo, for each grade, the number of male bus riders is (percentage of males) * 300, and the number of female bus riders is (percentage of females) * 300.\n\nOnce I have these two numbers, I'll compute 135% of the female number, which is 1.35 * female riders, and then see how close that is to the male riders. The grade where this is closest is the answer.\n\nAlright, let me start with the 9th grade.\n\nGrade 9:\nMales: 41.1%\nFemales: 39.4%\n\nNumber of male bus riders: 41.1% of 300 = 0.411 * 300 ≈ 123.3\nNumber of female bus riders: 39.4% of 300 = 0.394 * 300 ≈ 118.2\nNow, 135% of female riders: 1.35 * 118.2 ≈ 135% * 118.2. Let me calculate that. 118.2 * 1.35.\n\nHmm, 118.2 * 1 = "

Wait, but 135% of female riders is 159.57, which is way higher than the male riders. So that's not close. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the question is asking for the number of male bus riders being closest to 135% of the female bus riders. So, actually, maybe I need to compute (Male riders) / (Female riders) and see if that ratio is closest to 135%, which is 1.35. Alternatively, maybe compute 135% of female riders and see how close that is to the male riders. Either way, perhaps the ratio is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the number of female bus riders\". So, that would mean, for each grade, compute 1.35*(female riders) and see how close that is to male riders. The grade where the difference between male riders and 1.35*(female riders) is the smallest is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the ratio (Male riders)/(Female riders) and see which is closest to 1.35. Either approach should work, but let me confirm.\n\nLet me think. Let's see:\n\nSuppose for a grade, the number of male riders is M, female riders is F. We want M ≈ 1.35*F. So, the difference between M and 1.35F should be as small as possible. Alternatively, the ratio M/F ≈ 1.35. Either way, both approaches are equivalent. Let me see which is easier.\n\nSince the percentages are given, maybe using the percentages directly would be better, but since the numbers are based on 300 each, the actual counts are 300*(percentage). Let me proceed with the counts.\n\nStarting again with 9th"

Alternatively, 135% is the target. So, perhaps 0.139 is small, but let's check for 12th grade.\n\n12th grade.\n\nMales: 11.6%\nFemales: 8.6%\n\nM = 11.6% of 300 = 0.116*300 ≈ 34.8\nF = 8.6% of 300 = 0.086*300 ≈ 25.8\n\n1.35*F = 1.35*25.8 ≈ 34.83\n\nM = 34.8\n\nDifference: |34.8 - 34.83| ≈ 0.03. Hmm, that's almost zero. That's very close.\n\nSo, that seems almost exactly 135% of female riders is equal to male riders. So, 34.8 male riders is exactly 135% of 25.8 female riders because 25.8 * 1.35 = 34.83, which is very close to 34.8. So, 12th grade is the closest.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 11th grade:\n\nMales: 20.6% of 300 = 0.206*300 = 61.8\n\nFemales: 13.8% of 300 = 0.138*300 = 41.4\n\n1.35 * 41.4 = ?\n\nLet me compute that again. 41.4 * 1.35.\n\nFirst, 41.4 * 1 = 41.4\n\n41.4 * 0.3 = 12.42\n\n41.4 * 0.05 = 2.07\n\nSo, 41.4 + 12.42 = 53.82, plus 2.07 is 55.89. So, 55.89.\n\nBut wait, earlier I said 1.35*41.4 is 56.01, but now it's 55.89. Wait, perhaps a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, 41.4 * 1.35:\n\nCompute 41"

So the difference is about 0.03, which is almost zero.\n\nSo, 12th grade is very close, 11th grade is off by about 5.91, 10th grade is off by 30.8, and 9th grade is off by 36.27.\n\nTherefore, the closest grade is 12th grade.\n\nWait, but let me check again for 12th grade.\n\nCompute 11.6% of 300: 0.116*300=34.8\n\n8.6% of 300: 0.086*300=25.8\n\n1.35*25.8: as before, 25.8*1.35=34.83\n\nSo, 34.8 (M) vs. 34.83 (1.35F). So, the difference is 0.03, which is very close.\n\nThat's much closer than any other grade.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12th grade.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations earlier, let me go through each grade again:\n\n9th:\n\nM: 41.1% of 300 = (41.1/100)*300 = 123.3\n\nF: 39.4% of 300 = (39.4/100)*300 = 118.2\n\n1.35F = 1.35*118.2=159.57\n\n|"
