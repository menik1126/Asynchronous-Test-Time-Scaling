            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about bus riders at Central H.S. The data is given in a table with males and females for each grade, and I need to find out for which grade the number of male bus riders is closest to 135% of the female bus riders. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are four grades: 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th. For each grade, the percentage of males and females who are bus riders is provided. The total number of students surveyed in each grade is 300 males and 300 females. So, in each grade, there are 300 males and 300 females surveyed. That means the total number of students surveyed per grade is 600, right?\n\nWait, but the question isn't asking about the total number of bus riders, but rather the ratio of male to female bus riders. Specifically, for each grade, I need to find out how many male bus riders there are, how many female bus riders there are, and then see what percentage the males are of the females. Then, check which grade is closest to 135%.\n\nWait, but the percentages given are already the percentage of each gender in each grade, not the actual counts. So, for each grade, I can calculate the number of males and females who are bus riders by taking 135% (or the given percentage) of 300.\n\nBut wait, actually, I think I need to calculate the number of bus riders for each gender in each grade first. So, if 41.1% of 9th grade males are bus riders, then the number of male bus riders in 9th grade is 41.1% of 300, right? And similarly, the number of female bus riders is 39.4% of 300. Then, I can find the ratio of males to females, and see if that ratio is closest to 135%.\n\nWait, 135% means that males are 135% of females. So, if I have M as the number of male bus riders and F as the number of female bus riders, then M/F = 135%, or M = 1.35 * F.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate M/F for each grade and see which one is closest to 1.35.\n\nLet me lay out the data:\n\nGrade | Males"

Because the 300 cancels out. Oh, interesting! That simplifies things. Since the number of males and females surveyed is the same (300 each), the ratio of male riders to female riders is just the ratio of their percentages. So I don't even have to compute the actual numbers; the ratio is simply (Male %)/(Female %). \n\nTherefore, for each grade, compute Male% divided by Female%, then see which is closest to 1.35. \n\nThat's a big simplification. So let's do that for each grade:\n\nStarting with 9th grade:\n\nMale% = 41.1%, Female% =39.4%\n\nSo ratio = 41.1 / 39.4 ≈ let's calculate that. Let me get my calculator. 41.1 divided by 39.4. Let's see, 39.4 goes into 41.1 about 1.043 times (since 39.4 * 1.04 is 41.0). Hmm exactly?\n\nWait, 39.4 * 1.043:\n\n39.4 * 1 = 39.4\n\n39.4 * 0.04 = 1.576\n\n39.4 * 0.003 = 0.1182\n\nAdding up, 39.4 + 1.576 = 40.976, plus 0.1182 ≈ 41.0"

            "output": " + 0.1182 ≈ 41.0942, which is about 41.0942, which is close to 41.1. So 1.043 is a good approximation.\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 1.043, which is about 1.04, which is a bit less than 1.35. So 9th grade is giving a ratio of about 1.04, which is lower than 1.35.\n\nNext, 10th grade: Male% =34.4, Female% =33.1.\n\nCompute 34.4 / 33.1 ≈ let me do that. 33.1 times 1.04 is 34.444, right? 33.1 * 1 =33.1, 33.1*0.04=1.324, so 33.1 + 1.324 = 34.424. That's very close to 34.4. So 34.4 /33.1 ≈ 1.04. So again, approximately 1.04, which is about the same as the 9th grade.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So 10th grade is also about 1.04, not too different.\n\nMoving on to 11th grade: Male% =20.6, Female% =13.8.\n\nCompute 20.6 /13.8.\n\nLet me compute 13.8 *1.5 = 20.7. So 13.8 times 1.5 is 20.7, which is very close to 20.6. So 20.6 /13.8 ≈ approximately 1.5, but just slightly less. So 1.5 is 20.7/13.8, so 20.6 is 0.1 less, so maybe 1.5 - (0.1 /13.8). Wait, but perhaps more simply, 20.6 divided by 13.8 is approximately 1.499, which is about 1.5.\n\nSo 11th grade ratio is approximately 1.5.\n\nNow, 12th grade: Male% =11.6, Female% =8.6.\n\nCompute 11.6 /8.6.\n\n8.6 *1.35 = let's see: 8.6 *1 =8.6, 8."

Because 8.6 *1.35 is 11.61, which is 11.6, which is the male percentage. So that's exactly 135%. So in 12th grade, the number of male bus riders is exactly 135% of the female bus riders. So that's the grade.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So male riders are 11.6%, female riders are 8.6%.\n\nSo, 11.6 /8.6 =1.35 exactly. Yes, because 8.6 times 1.35 is 11.6.\n\nSo that's perfect. So 12th grade is exactly 135%. So the answer is 12th grade. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again because sometimes, when a grade is exactly 135%, but maybe another grade is closer in actual numbers because of rounding in percentages. But in this case, 12th grade is exactly 135%, which is what we're looking for. So that's the one.\n\nWait, just to make sure, for each grade, I should calculate the exact ratio to check where it's closest.\n\nWait, let me do exact calculations for each grade.\n\n9th grade:\n\nMales:41.1%, Females:39.4%\n\nRatio M/F =41.1/39.4 ≈ let's compute 41.1 ÷39.4.\n\nWe can do long division:\n\n39.4 | 41.1\n\n39.4 *1 =39.4, subtract that from 41.1, we have 1.7\n\nBring down a zero (though it's decimals), so 1.70.\n\n39.4 goes into 1.7 approx 0.043 times.\n\nSo 1.043, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo 1.043.\n\nSo the ratio is about 1.043, which is 4.3% higher than 1 (male riders are 4.3% higher than female riders).

So 34.4 /33.1 ≈1.04 - (0.024/33.1). Wait, actually, 33.1*1.04 is 34.424, so 34.4 is 0.024 less. So the ratio is 1.04 - (0.024 /33.1). Wait, maybe better to do division:\n\n34.4 ÷33.1. Let's see:\n\n33.1 goes into 34.4 once, with a remainder of 1.3.\n\nSo 1.0 + (1.3 /33.1). 1.3/33.1 ≈0.039. So total ratio is 1.039, so approximately 1.039. So about 1.04. So difference from 1.35 is 1.35 -1.039=0.311.\n\nSo 10th grade is a bit further away than 9th grade? Wait, 9th was 0.307, 10th is 0.311. So 9th is closer.\n\n11th grade:\n\n20.6 /13.8. Let's compute this exactly.\n\n13.8 *1.5 =20.7, so 20.6 is 0.1 less. So 1.5 - (0.1/13.8). 0.1/13.8≈0.00725. So 1.5 -0.00725≈1.49275. So approximately 1.4928.\n\nSo the ratio is about 1.4928.

Therefore, the answer is 12th grade.\n\nWait, but let me verify that I haven't made a miscalculation in the 12th grade.\n\nSo 11.6% male, 8.6% female.\n\nSo 11.6 /8.6.\n\nLet me compute 8.6 *1.35 =?\n\n8.6*1 =8.6\n\n8.6*0.35 = 3.01\n\nAdding up, 8.6 +3.01=11.61.\n\nBut the male percentage is 11.6, which is 0.01 less than 11.61. So the ratio is slightly less than 1.35. So, 11.6 /8.6= (8.6*1.35 -0.01)/8.6=1.35 - 0.01/8.6≈1.35 -0.00116≈1.3488.\n\nSo the exact ratio is approximately 1.3488, which is very close to 1.35, but just slightly less. So 1.3488 is about 1.35 when rounded, so that's exact to three decimal places.\n\nTherefore, 12th grade is the closest, as it's just 0.00116 less than 1.35, which is negligible.\n\nSo, the conclusion is 12th grade.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to 135% of the female bus riders. Each grade has 300 males and 300 females surveyed, so the ratio of male to female riders is the same as the ratio of their percentages."
