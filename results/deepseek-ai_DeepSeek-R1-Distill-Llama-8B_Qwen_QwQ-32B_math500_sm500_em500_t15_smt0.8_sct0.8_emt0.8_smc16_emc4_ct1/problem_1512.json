I'll calculate the number of ways to arrange these digits using permutations.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of unique license plates, I'll multiply the number of possible letter combinations by the number of possible number combinations.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of possible license plates, we'll break down the problem into its components:\n\n1. **Letters (A-Z):**\n   - There are 26 possible letters.\n   - Since the two letters must be different, we use the permutation formula:\n     \\[\n     P(26, 2) = 26 \\times 25 = 650\n     \\]\n     So, there are **650** ways to choose the letters.\n\n2. **Numbers (0-9):**\n   - There are 10 possible digits.\n   - Similarly, since the two digits must be different, we use the permutation formula:\n     \\[\n     P(10, 2) = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n     \\]\n     So, there are **90** ways to choose the digits.\n\n3. **Total Combinations:**\n   - To find the total number of unique license plates, multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations:\n     \\[\n     650 \\times 90 = 58,500\n     \\]\n     Therefore, there are **58,500** possible license plates.\n\n\\boxed{58500}"
