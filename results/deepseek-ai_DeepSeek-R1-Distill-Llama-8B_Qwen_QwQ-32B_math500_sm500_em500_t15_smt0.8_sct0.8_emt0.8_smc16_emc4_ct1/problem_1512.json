This accounts for the fact that the second letter must be different from the first.\n\nFor the digits, there are 10 possible choices (0 through 9). The second digit must be different from the first, so the number of digit combinations is 10 multiplied by 9.\n\nTo find the total number of license plates, I multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.\n\nTherefore, the total number of license plates is 26 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 9, which equals 65,000.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many different license plates can be formed under the given conditions, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n- **License Plate Structure:** 2 different letters (A-Z) followed by 2 different one-digit numbers (0-9)\n- **Total Length:** 4 characters (e.g., **AB12**)\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Possible Letters for Each Position:**\n   - There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.\n   - Since the two letters must be different, the number of combinations for the letters is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Letter Combinations} = 26 \\times 25\n     \\]\n     - **Explanation:** For the first letter, there are 26 choices. For the second letter, there are 25 choices remaining (as it must be different from the first letter).\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Possible Digits for Each Position:**\n   - There are 10 digits (0-9).\n   - Since the two digits must be different, the number of combinations for the digits is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Digit Combinations} = 10 \\times 9\n     \\]\n     - **Explanation:** For the first digit, there are 10 choices. For the second digit, there are 9 choices remaining (as it must be different from the first digit).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of License Plates:**\n   - To find the total number of unique license plates, multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations"
