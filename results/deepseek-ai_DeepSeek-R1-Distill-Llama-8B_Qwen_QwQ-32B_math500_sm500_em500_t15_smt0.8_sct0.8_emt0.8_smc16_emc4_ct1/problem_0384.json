Simplifying (3)² gives 9, so the equation becomes 45π = 9πh.\n\nNext, I can divide both sides of the equation by π to eliminate π from both sides, resulting in 45 = 9h.\n\nFinally, I divide both sides by 9 to solve for h, which gives h = 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder when the volume is given as \\( 45\\pi \\) cubic centimeters and the radius \\( r \\) is 3 centimeters, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Recall the Volume Formula for a Cylinder\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is calculated using the formula:\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the base,\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\n### Step 2: Plug in the Known Values\nFrom the problem:\n- \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cm³,\n- \\( r = 3 \\) cm.\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Equation\nFirst, calculate \\( 3^2 \\):\n\\[\n45\\pi = \\pi (9) h\n\\]\n\\[\n45\\pi = 9\\pi h\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( h \\)\nTo isolate \\( h \\), divide both sides of the equation by \\( 9\\pi \\):\n\\[\nh = \\frac{45\\pi}{9\\pi}\n\\]\n\\[\nh = 5\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe height of the cylinder is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
