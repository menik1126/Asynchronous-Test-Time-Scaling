We can only add parentheses, not change the order of operations or introduce multiplication.\n\n2. **Goal: Minimize the Total:**\n   To minimize the result, we should aim to subtract larger numbers or group them in a way that their subtraction has the maximum impact.\n\n3. **Possible Groupings:**\n   Let's try different placements of parentheses to see which yields the smallest result.\n\n4. **Attempt 1: Group Positive Numbers Together**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 2 + 3) - 4 + 5 + 6\n   \\]\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     (6) - 4 + 5 + 6 = 6 - 4 + 5 + 6 = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\n     \\]\n   - **Result:** 14\n\n5. **Attempt 2: Group Subtractions Together**\n   \\[\n   1 + (2 + 3) - (4 + 5) + 6\n   \\]\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     1 + 5 - 9 + 6 = 6 - 9 + 6 = 3\n     \\]\n   - **Result:** 3\n\n6. **Attempt 3: Another Grouping Strategy**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 2) + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6\n   \\]\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     3 + (-1) + 5 +"

To group \\(4 + 5 + 6\\), we would need parentheses around them, but the \"-4\" is already part of the sequence. Let's re-express this correctly:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\n   \\]\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     6 - (15) = -9\n     \\]\n   - **Result:** -9 (This is valid because we can add parentheses around \\(4 + 5 + 6\\) without rearranging terms.)\n\n   Wait, but the original expression is \\(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\\). To group \\(4 + 5 + 6\\), we need to consider the operator before 4. The expression can be written as:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\n   \\]\n   Here, the subtraction before 4 applies to the entire group \\(4 + 5 + 6\\), which is valid. This gives:\n   \\[\n   6 - 15 = -9\n   \\]\n   This is a valid grouping and results in -9, which is smaller than 3.\n\n8. **Rechecking Validity:**\n   The problem states we cannot change the order of terms. The grouping \\(1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\\) maintains the original order and only adds parentheses. Thus, this is valid.\n\n9. **Final Check for Lower Values:**\n   Trying other groupings like:\n   \\[\n   1 + (2 + 3 - 4 + "

    "question": "The expression $$1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6$$is equivalent to 13. If we add parentheses in various locations, we can change this value. For example, $1+2+3-(4+5)+6=1+2+3-9+6=6-9+6=3$. If we only add parentheses (and not rearrange the order of the terms), what is the minimum possible value this expression can obtain? (For the purposes of this problem, we cannot change addition or subtraction into multiplication. For example, $ (1+2+3)(-4)+5+6 $ is not a valid placement of parentheses.)\n\nEnter your answer as a single value.",
