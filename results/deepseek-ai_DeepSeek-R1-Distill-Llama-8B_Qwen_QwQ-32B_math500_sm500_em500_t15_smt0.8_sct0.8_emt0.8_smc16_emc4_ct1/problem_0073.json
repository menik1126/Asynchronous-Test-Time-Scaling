I need to find the largest possible greatest common divisor of these two numbers, \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). \n\nAlright, let me start by recalling what a gcd is. The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\nI remember that one of the ways to find the gcd of two numbers is using the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe I can apply that here. The Euclidean algorithm involves subtracting multiples of the smaller number from the larger one until I get a remainder, and then repeating the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.\n\nLet me denote \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). So, I need to compute \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\). Using the Euclidean algorithm, I can subtract appropriate multiples of one from the other to simplify the expression.\n\nFirst, let me see if I can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( a \\). So, \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). Let me express \\( n \\) in terms of \\( a \\). Since \\( a = n + 7 \\), subtracting 7 from both sides gives \\( n = a - 7 \\).\n\nSubstituting this into \\( b \\), I get \\( b = 2(a - 7) + 1 = 2a - 14 + 1 = 2a - 13 \\). So, \\( b = 2a - 13 \\).\n\nNow, using the Euclidean algorithm, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, b - 2a) \\) because \\( 2a \\) is a multiple of \\( a \\), and subtracting it from \\( b \\) gives the remainder.\n\nSo, \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(a, b - 2a) = \\gcd(a, -13) \\). But since gcd is always non-negative, \\( \\gcd"

            "output": "(a, -13) = \\gcd(a, 13) \\). So, the greatest common divisor of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is the same as the greatest common divisor of \\( a \\) and 13.\n\nAh, that simplifies things a lot. So, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\). Now, since 13 is a prime number, the possible divisors are 1 and 13. Therefore, the gcd can only be either 1 or 13.\n\nSo, the greatest possible value of this gcd is 13, provided that 13 divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). So, I need to check whether there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) for which both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13.\n\nLet me set up two congruences:\n\n1. \\( n + 7 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\) => \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\). Since -7 mod13 is equivalent to 6 mod13, because 13 - 7 = 6.\n\n2. \\( 2n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\mod 13 \\) => \\( 2n \\equiv -1 \\mod 13 \\) => \\( 2n \\equiv 12 \\mod 13 \\) (since -1 mod13 is 12).\n\nSo, from the first equation, \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\). Let's plug this into the second equation to see if it holds.\n\nIf \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\), then \\( 2n \\equiv 2*6 = 12 \\mod 13 \\). Indeed, 12 \u2261 12 mod13, so \\( 2n +1 \\equiv 12 + 1 = 13 \u2261 0 mod13 \\). Perfect, so if \\( n \u2261 6 mod13 \\), both congruences are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, there exist positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying these conditions. For example, the smallest such \\( n \\) is 6, since 6 mod13 is 6, and let's check:\n\n\\( n = 6 \\):\n\n\\( n + 7 = "

So, that's the maximum possible gcd.\n\nWait, but let me test another value just to be sure.

But since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, we can't take -7. So, the smallest positive integer satisfying the condition is 6.\n\nSo, it seems the maximum gcd is indeed 13.\n\nTherefore, after all these steps, the greatest possible value is 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible value is \\boxed{13}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\), we start by denoting \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\).
