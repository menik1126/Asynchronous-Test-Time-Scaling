I need to find the maximum value that the greatest common divisor of these two expressions can take. Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, \\( \\gcd(a, b) \\) is the largest number that can divide both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Here, \\( a = n + 7 \\) and \\( b = 2n + 1 \\). So, I need to find the largest possible number that divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\).\n\nMaybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here. That's the method where you subtract multiples of one number from the other to find the gcd. Let me recall how that works. The Euclidean algorithm states that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b) \\). So, if I can express \\( (n + 7) \\) and \\( (2n + 1) \\) in a way that allows me to subtract multiples, I might be able to find their gcd.\n\nLet me denote \\( d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\). So, \\( d \\) divides both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\). That means \\( d \\) must also divide any linear combination of these two. Specifically, I can write:\n\n1. \\( d \\) divides \\( n + 7 \\), so \\( n + 7 = d \\cdot k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n2. \\( d \\) divides \\( 2n + 1 \\), so \\( 2n + 1 = d \\cdot m \\) for some integer \\( m \\).\n\nMaybe I can subtract or combine these equations to eliminate \\( n \\) or some multiple of it. Let me try subtracting twice the first equation from the second. That might help me get rid of \\( n \\).\n\nSo, if I subtract \\( 2(n + 7) \\) from \\( 2"

But since \\( d \\) is a positive integer, \\( d \\) must divide 13. So, the possible values of \\( d \\) are the divisors of 13, which are 1 and 13 because 13 is a prime number.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the greatest possible value of \\( d \\). Since 13 is larger than 1, the maximum possible value is 13. But wait, I should verify whether 13 is actually achievable. In other words, is there an integer \\( n \\) such that both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are divisible by 13?\n\nLet me try to find such an \\( n \\). If 13 divides \\( n + 7 \\), then \\( n \\equiv -7 \\mod 13 \\) or \\( n \\equiv 6 \\mod 13 \\) because \\( -7 + 13 = 6 \\). So, let's set \\( n = 13k + 6 \\) for some integer \\( k \\geq 0 \\).\n\nThen, let's plug this into the second expression \\( 2n + 1 \\):\n\n\\[\n2n + 1 = 2(13k + 6) + 1 = 26k + 12 + 1 = 26k + 13 = 13(2k + 1)\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( 2n + 1 \\) is equal to \\( 13(2k + 1) \\), which is clearly divisible by 13. That means when \\( n = 13k + 6 \\), both \\( n + 7 \\) and \\( 2n + 1 \\) are multiples of 13. Therefore, \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13 \\) for such \\( n \\).\n\nTo double-check, let me pick a specific value of \\( k \\) and compute both expressions. Let's choose \\( k = 0 \\), so \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nCompute \\( n + 7 = 6 +"

Well, 39 is 13*3 and 65 is 13*5, so the gcd is 13 again.\n\nOkay, so I see a pattern here. For \\( n = 13k + 6 \\), the gcd is always 13, which is the maximum possible. So, is 13 the greatest possible value? It seems so because we've found that 13 divides both expressions when \\( n = 6, 19, 32, \\) etc., and earlier reasoning showed that 13 is the highest possible divisor.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me think if there's any way the gcd could be higher than 13. Since in the process above, we deduced that the gcd must divide 13, and 13 itself is prime, it can't be higher than 13. So, 13 is the maximum.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about if \\( d \\) could be 13, and if that's achievable. I already checked for specific \\( n \\), so that's fine.\n\nTherefore, I think the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) is 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible value is \\boxed{13}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) for a positive integer \\( n \\), we start by denoting \\( d = \\gcd(n + 7, 2n"
