Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) \\) and figure out its maximum possible value.\n\nMaybe I can use the Euclidean algorithm here. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the gcd of two numbers by repeatedly applying division. The formula for the Euclidean algorithm is \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b) \\) until \\( b \\) becomes zero.\n\nLet me denote \\( a = 2n + 1 \\) and \\( b = n + 7 \\). Then, applying the Euclidean algorithm, I have:\n\n\\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) \\).\n\nThe first step is to compute \\( (2n + 1) \\mod (n + 7) \\). Let me figure out what this modulo operation gives.\n\nWhen I divide \\( 2n + 1 \\) by \\( n + 7 \\), how many times does \\( n + 7 \\) go into \\( 2n + 1 \\)? It goes 2 times because \\( 2 \\times (n + 7) = 2n + 14 \\). But \\( 2n + 1 \\) is less than \\( 2n + 14 \\). So, the remainder is \\( (2n + 1) - 2 \\times (n + 7) \\).\n\nCalculating that: \\( 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\). Wait, the remainder can't be negative. So, actually, I should take the modulo after division. Since the remainder is negative, I can add the divisor \\( n + 7 \\) to get a positive remainder.\n\nSo, the remainder is \\( (2n + 1) - (n + 7) \\times 2 + (n + 7) \\times 1 = n + 1 \\). Wait, that might not be the right way"

            "output": ". Let me recast it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to express \\( 2n + 1 \\) as \\( 2(n + 7) - 13 \\). Because \\( 2(n + 7) = 2n + 14 \\), so \\( 2n + 1 = 2(n + 7) - 13 \\). So, when you divide \\( 2n + 1 \\) by \\( n + 7 \\), the dividend is \\( 2n + 1 \\) and the divisor is \\( n + 7 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 2n + 1 = 2 \\times (n + 7) - 13 \\). Therefore, the remainder is \\( -13 \\), but as per modulo operation, the remainder is the positive equivalent, so it should be \\( n + 7 - 13 \\) or something?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's compute \\( (2n + 1) - 2 \\times (n + 7) \\).\n\nThat would be \\( 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13 \\). So, the remainder is \\( -13 \\). However, in modulo arithmetic, remainders are non-negative and less than the divisor. So, in this case, the remainder should be \\( (n + 7) - 13 \\). Wait, that might not be accurate either.\n\nWait, no. The modulo operation gives a remainder between 0 and the divisor minus 1. Since \\( (2n + 1) \\) divided by \\( (n + 7) \\) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of \\( -13 \\). So, we can adjust it by adding the divisor \\( n + 7 \\) to get the positive remainder.\n\nSo, \\( -13 + (n + 7) \\times 1 = n - 6 \\). Hmm, but \\( n - 6 \\) could be positive or negative depending on the value of \\( n \\). Since \\( n \\) is a positive integer, if \\( n > 6 \\), then the remainder is positive; if \\( n = 6 \\), the remainder is zero; if \\( n < 6 \\), the remainder is negative.\n\nBut actually, \\( n \\) is a positive integer, so \\( n \\geq 1 \\). Therefore"

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the property that \\( \\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a - k \\times b) \\) for any integer \\( k \\). So, let me apply that.\n\nLet me compute \\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) \\). Let me subtract twice the second term from the first term:\n\n\\( \\gcd(2n + 1, n + 7) = \\gcd(n + 7, (2n + 1) - 2 \\times (n + 7)) \\).\n\nCalculating the second part: \\( (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n +1 -2n -14 = -13 \\).\n\nTherefore, the gcd becomes \\( \\gcd(n + 7, -13) \\). Since gcd is always non-negative, this is equivalent to \\( \\gcd(n + 7, 13) \\).\n\nAh, that's a key step. So, the gcd simplifies to the gcd of \\( n + 7 \\) and 13. Therefore, the gcd can only be 1 or 13, since 13 is a prime number. Therefore, the greatest possible value of the gcd is 13, provided that 13 divides \\( n + 7 \\).\n\nTherefore, to maximize the gcd, we need to have \\( 13 \\) divides \\( n + 7 \\). So, \\( n + 7 \\) must be a multiple of 13. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nSuppose \\( n + 7 = 13k \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive integer. Then, \\( n = 13k - 7 \\). Since \\( n \\) must be a positive integer, \\( 13k - 7 \\geq 1 \\), so \\( 13k \\geq 8 \\), so \\( k \\geq 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, for any \\( k \\geq 1 \\), such an \\( n \\) exists. Let me check if when \\( n +"

Then, I subtracted twice the second term from the first, resulting in -13, so the gcd is \\( \\gcd(n + 7, -13) \\), which is the same as \\( \\gcd(n +7, 13) \\).
