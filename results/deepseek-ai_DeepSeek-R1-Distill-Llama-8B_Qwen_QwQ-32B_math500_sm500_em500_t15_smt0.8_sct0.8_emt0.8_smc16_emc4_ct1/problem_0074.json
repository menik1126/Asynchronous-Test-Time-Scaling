Hmm, gcd problems can sometimes be tricky, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference. So, maybe I can use that property here. Let me denote the two numbers as A and B, where A = n + 7 and B = 2n + 1. Then, I can compute B - 2A, because that should give me something divisible by the gcd.\n\nSo, let's compute B - 2A:\n\nB - 2A = (2n + 1) - 2*(n + 7)\n= 2n + 1 - 2n - 14\n= 1 - 14\n= -13\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the difference B - 2A is -13, which means that the gcd of A and B must divide 13. Since 13 is a prime number, the possible divisors are 1 and 13. So, the gcd can either be 1 or 13. \n\nBut the question is asking for the greatest possible value, so I guess 13 is the maximum possible gcd here. Now, I need to check if there exists a positive integer n such that gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13.\n\nTo do that, I can set up the equation:\n\ngcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = 13\n\nThis implies that 13 divides both n + 7 and 2n + 1. So, let's write that down:\n\n13 | (n + 7)  and  13 | (2n + 1)\n\nWhich means:\n\nn + 7 \u2261 0 mod 13  --> n \u2261 -7 mod 13\n2n + 1 \u2261 0 mod 13  --> 2n \u2261 -1 mod 13\n\nLet me solve for n in both congruences and see if they are consistent.\n\nFirst, n \u2261 -7 mod 13. Since -7 mod 13 is equivalent to 6 mod 13 (because 13 - 7 = 6), so n \ufffd"

            "output": "\u2261 6 mod 13.\n\nSecond, 2n \u2261 -1 mod 13. Let's solve for n here. Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 2 mod 13. The inverse of 2 mod 13 is 7 because 2*7=14 \u22611 mod13. So, n \u2261 (-1)*7 \u2261 -7 mod13. Which is the same as before, which is 6 mod13.\n\nSo both congruences give the same condition: n \u22616 mod13. That means n can be written as n =13k +6 for some integer k \u22650.\n\nNow, I need to choose the smallest such n to see if this works, but actually, I just need to confirm that for n=6,13,26, etc., the gcd is indeed 13.\n\nLet's test n=6 first:\n\nA =6 +7=13\n\nB=2*6+1=13\n\ngcd(13,13)=13, which works. So, n=6 gives gcd=13.\n\nWait, but n is a positive integer, so n=6 is acceptable.\n\nLet me try n=13:\n\nA=13+7=20\n\nB=2*13+1=27\n\ngcd(20,27). 20 factors are 2^2*5, 27 is 3^3. So, gcd is 1. Oh, that's not 13. Hmm, interesting.\n\nWait, but n=13 is also 13*1 +6=19, but wait, n=13 is 13*1 +0, which isn't the form we expected. Wait no, n=13k +6, so when k=0, n=6; k=1, n=19; k=2, n=32, etc.\n\nWait, earlier I thought n=13 is 13*1 +0, which is different from n=19, which is 13*1 +6. So, let me compute n=19:\n\nA=19+7=26\n\nB=2*19+1=39\n\ngcd(26,39). 26=2*13, 39=3*13. So, gcd is 13. That works.\n\nSimilarly, n=32:\n\nA=32+7=39\n\nB=2*32+1=65\n\ngcd"

            "output": "(39,65). 39=3*13, 65=5*13. gcd is 13. So that works too.\n\nSo, when n is of the form 13k +6, the gcd is 13. So, the maximum possible gcd is 13. But let me check if there's a higher possible gcd. Wait, since 13 is prime, the only divisors are 1 and 13, so 13 is the maximum possible. Therefore, the answer should be 13.\n\nBut let me just confirm with another example where maybe the gcd is higher. Wait, but since the difference was 13, the gcd must divide 13, so it can't be higher than 13. So, 13 is the maximum possible. Therefore, the answer is 13.\n\nWait, but let me check another n where maybe the gcd is 13. Let's see n=6, which gives 13 and 13, so gcd 13. So that's valid. So, yes, 13 is achievable, so that's the maximum. Therefore, the answer is 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest possible value of the gcd is \\boxed{13}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest possible value of \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) where \\(n\\) is a positive integer, we start by noting that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference. Let \\(A = n + 7\\) and \\(B = 2n + 1\\). We compute the difference \\(B - 2A\\):\n\n\\[\nB - 2A = (2n + 1) - 2(n + 7) = 2n + 1 - 2n - 14 = -13\n\\]\n\nThis shows that \\(\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)\\) must divide \\(-13\\). Since 13 is a prime number, the possible values of the gcd are 1 and 13. To determine if 13 is achievable, we check if there exists an \\(n\\) such that both \\(n + 7\\) and \\(2n + 1\\) are divisible by 13.\n\nWe set up the congruences:\n"
