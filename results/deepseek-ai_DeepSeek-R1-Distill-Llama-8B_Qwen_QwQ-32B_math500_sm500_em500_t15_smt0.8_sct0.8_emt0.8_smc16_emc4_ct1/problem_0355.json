Let \\( b \\) represent the number of blue marbles and \\( y \\) represent the number of yellow marbles initially in the bag.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow marbles. Therefore, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b}{y} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nFrom this equation, I can express \\( b \\) in terms of \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{4}{3}y\n\\]\n\nNext, the problem states that after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio of blue to yellow marbles becomes 7:3. This gives me another equation to work with:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b + 5}{y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\nUsing the expression for \\( b \\) from the first equation, I can substitute it into this equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}y + 5}{y - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by \\( 3(y - 3) \\):\n\n\\[\n3(\\frac{4}{3}y + 5) = 7(y - 3)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[\n4y + 15 = 7y - 21\n\\]\n\nNow, I'll solve for \\( y \\) by isolating it on one side:\n\n\\[\n15 + 21 = 7y - 4y\n\\]\n\\[\n36 = 3y\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 12\n\\]\n\nFinally, I'll substitute \\( y = 12 \\) back into the expression for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 12 = 16\n\\]\n\nSo, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before any marbles were added or removed.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let’s Define Variables:**\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of blue marbles initially in the bag.\n- Let \\( y \\) be"
