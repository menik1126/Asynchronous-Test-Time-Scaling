            "output": "First, I need to define variables for the initial number of blue and yellow marbles. Let's let B represent the number of blue marbles and Y represent the number of yellow marbles initially in the bag.\n\nAccording to the problem, the initial ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles is 4:3. This means that B divided by Y equals 4/3. So, I can write the equation B/Y = 4/3.\n\nNext, the problem states that after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles becomes 7:3. This gives me the equation (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n1. B/Y = 4/3\n2. (B + 5)/(Y - 3) = 7/3\n\nFrom the first equation, I can solve for B in terms of Y: B = (4/3)Y.\n\nI'll substitute this expression for B into the second equation:\n( (4/3)Y + 5 ) / (Y - 3) = 7/3\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 3(Y - 3):\n3( (4/3)Y + 5 ) = 7(Y - 3)\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n(4Y) + 15 = 7Y - 21\n\nNow, I'll solve for Y:\n4Y + 15 = 7Y - 21\n15 + 21 = 7Y - 4Y\n36 = 3Y\nY = 12\n\nWith the value of Y known, I can find B using the expression B = (4/3)Y:\nB = (4/3)(12) = 16\n\nSo, there were 16 blue marbles in the bag before any marbles were added or removed.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( B \\) = Initial number of blue marbles\n- \\( Y \\) = Initial number of yellow marbles\n\n**Given:**\n1. The initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 4:3 \\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3} \\quad \\Rightarrow"
