So the x term is -34x, which is not -1x.\n\nSo A=2, B=5 is incorrect.\n\nBut when A=5, B=2, we get:\n\n(5x -8)(2x +3)=10x² +15x -16x -24=10x² -x -24.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo A=5, B=2.\n\nWait, but the question says (Ax -8)(Bx +3). So perhaps the order is A first, then B.\n\nSo with A=5, B=2, we get: (5x -8)(2x +3).\n\nSo that's correct.
