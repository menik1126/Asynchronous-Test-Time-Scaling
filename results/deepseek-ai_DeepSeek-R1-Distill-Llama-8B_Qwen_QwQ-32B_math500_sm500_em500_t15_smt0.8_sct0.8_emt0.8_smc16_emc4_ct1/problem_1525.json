Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nThe problem says that we have a sequence \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\) of positive real numbers. We are given three sums:\n\n1. The sum of the first powers: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\).\n2. The sum of the squares: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\).\n3. The sum of the cubes: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\).\n\nWe need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\).\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to relate these sums in some way to find possible values of \\( n \\). Since all \\( a_i \\) are positive, maybe some inequalities or identities can help here.\n\nI know that for positive real numbers, there are relationships between the sums of powers. Maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of variance or moments.\n\nLet me think about the relationship between the sums of powers. Let's denote:\n\n\\( S_1 = \\sum a_i = 96 \\),\n\\( S_2 = \\sum a_i^2 = 144 \\),\n\\( S_3 = \\sum a_i^3 = 216 \\).\n\nI recall that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that \\( (S_1)^2 \\leq n S_2 \\). Let me check that:\n\n\\( S_1^2 = 96^2 = 9216 \\).\n\n\\( n S_2 = n \\times 144 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 9216 \\leq 144n \\), which gives \\( n \\geq 9216 / 144 \\). Let me compute that:\n\n\\( 144 \\times 64 = 9216 \\), so \\( 9216 / 144 = 64 \\). Therefore, \\( n \\geq 64 \\).\n\nSo, \\( n \\) must be at least 64.\n\nBut wait, is this the only condition?
