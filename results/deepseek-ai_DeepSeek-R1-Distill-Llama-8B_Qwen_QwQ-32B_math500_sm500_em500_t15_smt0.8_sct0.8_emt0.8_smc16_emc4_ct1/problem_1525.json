The sum of the numbers: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96 \\)\n2. The sum of their squares: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144 \\)\n3. The sum of their cubes: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = 216 \\)\n\nAnd we need to find the sum of all possible values of \\( n \\). Hmm, okay. I remember that when dealing with sums of powers, sometimes it's helpful to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Maybe there's a more algebraic method.\n\nLet me think. Since all the \\( a_i \\) are positive real numbers, perhaps they are all equal? If they are, maybe we can find \\( n \\) by dividing the first sum by the number of terms. But wait, let me check the sums:\n\nIf all \\( a_i \\) are equal, then \\( a_i = \\frac{96}{n} \\). Then the sum of squares would be \\( n \\left( \\frac{96}{n} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9216}{n} \\). But the given sum of squares is 144, so:\n\n\\( \\frac{9216}{n} = 144 \\) => \\( n = \\frac{9216}{144} = 64 \\).\n\nWait, but if \\( n = 64 \\), then the sum of cubes would be \\( 64 \\left( \\frac{96}{64} \\right)^3 = 64 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^3 = 64 \\times \\frac{27}{64} = 27 \\). But the given sum of cubes is 216, which is much larger. So, this approach doesn't work because the equal case doesn't satisfy the sum of cubes. Therefore, the numbers aren't all equal, so we need another approach.\n\nHmm, maybe the numbers are not all equal, but perhaps they can be grouped into equal terms. For example, some terms are x and"

Since x > y (because the sum of squares is larger when x is larger than y, but I need to think if this is necessarily true). Alternatively, if x < y, the same approach might still work.\n\nWait, actually, maybe not necessarily. Perhaps I should let t = y/x or something like that. Maybe scaling variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about the ratios between the sums.\n\nLet me consider the sums:\n\nSum: S1 = 96\n\nSum of squares: S2 = 144\n\nSum of cubes: S3 = 216\n\nI know that for positive numbers, the sum of squares is related to the square of the sum and the sum of products. Similarly, the sum of cubes can be related to the sums and products.\n\nWait, let me recall that for two variables, there's a relation between S1, S2, S3.
