Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in its prime factorization.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!. This is done by dividing 42 by 5 and taking the floor of the result, then dividing by 25, 125, and so on, until the division yields zero.\n\nCalculating the number of 5s:\n42 ÷ 5 = 8.4, so there are 8 multiples of 5.\n42 ÷ 25 = 1.68, so there is 1 multiple of 25.\nThere are no multiples of 125 (125 > 42), so this step contributes 0.\n\nAdding these together, there are 8 + 1 = 9 fives in the prime factors of 42!.\n\nNow, I'll count the number of 2s in the prime factors of 42!.\nSince there are more multiples of 2 than 5 in the range from 1 to 42, there will definitely be more 2s than 5s.\n\nCalculating the number of 2s:\n42 ÷ 2 = 21, so there are 21 multiples of 2.\n42 ÷ 4 = 10.5, so there are 10 multiples of 4.\n42 ÷ 8 = 5.25, so there are 5 multiples of 8.\n42 ÷ 16 = 2.625, so there are 2 multiples of 16.\n42 ÷ 32 = 1.3125, so there is 1 multiple of 32.\nThere are no multiples of 64 (64 > 42), so this step contributes 0.\n\nAdding these together, there are 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39 twos in the prime factors of 42!.\n\nFinally, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is the minimum of the number of 5s and 2s, which is 9.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many zeros are at the end of **42!** (42 factorial"

            "output": "), we need to find the number of times **10** is a factor in the prime factorization of **42!**. Since **10 = 2 × 5**, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of pairs of **2** and **5** in the prime factors of **42!**.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!:**\n   - Divide 42 by 5: \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 8\n     \\]\n     So, there are **8** multiples of **5**.\n   - Divide 42 by **25** (since higher powers of 5 contribute additional 5s):\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 1\n     \\]\n     So, there is **1** additional multiple of **25**.\n   - Higher powers of **5** (like **125**) exceed **42**, so they don't contribute further.\n   \n   **Total number of 5s = 8 + 1 = 9**\n\n2. **Count the number of 2s in the prime factors of 42!:**\n   - Since there are more multiples of **2** than **5** in the range from **1** to **42**, we count them as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 21 \\quad (\\text{multiples of } 2)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 10 \\quad (\\text{multiples of } 4)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{8} \\right\\rfloor = 5 \\quad (\\text{multiples of } 8)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{16} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\quad (\\text{multiples of } 16)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{42}{32} \\right\\rfloor = 1 \\quad (\\text{multiples of } 32)\n     \\]\n    "
