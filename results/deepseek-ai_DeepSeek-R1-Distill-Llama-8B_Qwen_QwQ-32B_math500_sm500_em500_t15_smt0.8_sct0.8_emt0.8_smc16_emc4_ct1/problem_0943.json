            "output": "Alright, so I need to figure out how many zeros are at the end of 42! Hmm, okay. I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I think each pair of 2 and 5 in the prime factors contributes to a trailing zero. But I've also heard that there are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial's prime factors, so maybe the number of 5s will determine the number of trailing zeros.\n\nLet me start by recalling the formula for trailing zeros in n!. It's something like dividing n by 5, then dividing by 25, then 125, and so on until the division yields zero. Then you sum all those quotients. Yeah, that sounds right because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, every multiple of 25 contributes an extra 5, and so on.\n\nSo, applying this method to 42!, I should calculate the number of multiples of 5 in 42!, then the number of multiples of 25, 125, etc. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 42 by 5. 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, but since we only take the integer part, that's 8. So there are 8 multiples of 5 in 42!.\n\nNext, I need to find how many multiples of 25 are there because each contributes another 5. 42 divided by 25 is 1.68, which means there's 1 multiple of 25 in 42!.\n\nMoving on to 125, but wait, 125 is larger than 42, so 42 divided by 125 is 0. So we can stop here because higher powers of 5 will also be beyond 42.\n\nNow, I'll add up the quotients from each division: 8 (from 5) plus 1 (from 25) equals 9. So does that mean there are 9 trailing zeros in 42!?\n\nLet me double-check. So, each multiple of 5 gives one 5, and each multiple of 25 gives an extra 5, making it two 5s per 25. Since 25 is 5 squared, it adds an extra 5. The same logic applies"

            "output": " to higher powers, but since 125 is more than 42, we don't have to consider that here.\n\nLet me count the actual multiples. The multiples of 5 up to 42 are 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40. That's 8 numbers. Among these, the multiples of 25 are 25 and 50, but 50 is beyond 42, so only 25. So that's one more 5. So total 8 +1 =9. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but why do we add the extra 1 for 25? Let me think again. Each multiple of 25 has two 5s, so the first division by 5 counts one 5 from each multiple of 5, including 25. But since 25 has two 5s, we need to account for the second one. So dividing by 25 gives the number of those that have an extra 5. Similarly, 125 would be for numbers with three 5s, but since 125 is beyond 42, there are none here.\n\nTherefore, adding those gives the total number of 5s in the prime factors of 42!.\n\nSince there are definitely more 2s than 5s, the number of 10s (and hence trailing zeros) is determined by the number of 5s, which is 9. So the answer should be 9.\n\nHmm, but let me confirm with an example. Let's take a smaller factorial, like 10!.\n\n10 divided by 5 is 2, and 10 divided by 25 is 0. So total 2 zeros. 10! is 3628800, which indeed has two zeros. That works. Another example: 25!.\n\n25 divided by 5 is 5, divided by 25 is 1, so total 6 zeros. Let me check 25!... Well, 25! is a big number, but I can recall that the number of trailing zeros is 6. So that seems correct. So applying the same method to 42 gives 8 +1 =9. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 9. I can"
