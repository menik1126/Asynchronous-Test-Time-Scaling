            "output": "First, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all positive divisors of a number that are less than the number itself.\n\nI'll start by determining the prime factors of 284. Since 284 is an even number, it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives me 142. I'll continue factoring: 142 divided by 2 is 71. Finally, 71 is a prime number, so the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71, which is \\(2^2 \\times 71\\).\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of divisors, which is \\((1 + p + p^2)\\) for each prime factor \\(p\\), I calculate the sum of all divisors of 284:\n\n- For \\(2^2\\): \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\)\n- For 71: \\(1 + 71 = 72\\)\n\nMultiplying these together gives the total sum of divisors: \\(7 \\times 72 = 504\\).\n\nSince the sum of the proper divisors is the total sum of divisors minus the number itself, I subtract 284 from 504: \\(504 - 284 = 220\\). So, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. I'll start by determining the prime factors of 220. Dividing 220 by 2 gives 110. Dividing 110 by 2 again gives 55. Finally, 55 is divisible by 5 and 11. Therefore, the prime factorization of 220 is \\(2^2 \\times 5 \\times 11\\).\n\nApplying the sum of divisors formula again:\n\n- For \\(2^2\\): \\(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\\)\n- For 5: \\(1 + 5 = 6\\)\n- For 11: \\(1 + 11 = 12\\)\n\nMultiplying these together: \\(7 \\times 6 \\times 12 = 504\\).\n\nThe sum of the proper divisors is the total sum minus the number itself: \\(504 - 220 = 284\\).\n\nFinally, I'll sum the proper divisors of both 284 and 220. That means"
