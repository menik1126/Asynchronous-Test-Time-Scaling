Once Yann has chosen, Camille cannot choose the same dish, so Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\nBy multiplying Yann's choices by Camille's choices, I get 10 multiplied by 9, which equals 90 different meal combinations.\n\nTherefore, Yann and Camille can order from 90 different combinations of meals.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Total Dishes:**\n   - There are **10** different dishes available on the menu.\n\n2. **Understand the Restriction:**\n   - **No Two People Can Order the Same Dish.** This means if Yann chooses a dish, Camille cannot choose the same one.\n\n3. **Determine the Choices for Each Person:**\n   - **For Yann:** He can choose any of the **10** dishes.\n   - **For Camille:** After Yann has chosen, Camille has **9** remaining options (since one dish is already taken by Yann).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Combinations:**\n   - Use the **Multiplication Principle** to find the total number of distinct meal combinations.\n   - **Total Combinations = Number of Choices for Yann \u00d7 Number of Choices for Camille**\n   - **Total Combinations = 10 \u00d7 9 = 90**\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - Yann and Camille can order from **90** different meal combinations.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what---Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)"
