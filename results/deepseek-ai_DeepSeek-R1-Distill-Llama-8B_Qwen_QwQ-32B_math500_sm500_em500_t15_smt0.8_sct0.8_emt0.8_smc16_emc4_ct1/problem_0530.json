Since there are 10 items on the menu, Yann has 10 different options.\n\nNext, after Yann has placed their order, Camille must choose a different dish from what Yann ordered. This means Camille has 9 remaining options.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of different meal combinations, multiply the number of choices Yann has by the number of choices Camille has: 10 * 9 = 90.\n</think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nYann and Camille go to a restaurant. If there are 10 items on the menu, and each orders one dish, how many different combinations of meals can Yann and Camille order if they refuse to order the same dish? (It does matter who orders what—Yann ordering chicken and Camille ordering fish is different from Yann ordering fish and Camille ordering chicken.)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Determine the number of choices for Yann:**\n   - There are 10 different dishes on the menu.\n   - Yann can choose any one of these 10 dishes.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Choices for Yann} = 10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of choices for Camille after Yann's choice:**\n   - Camille must choose a different dish from Yann.\n   - Since there are 10 dishes in total, after Yann has chosen one, there are 9 remaining dishes for Camille.\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Choices for Camille} = 10 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of different combinations:**\n   - For each choice Yann makes, Camille has 9 possible choices.\n   - Therefore, the total number of combinations is:\n     \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total combinations} = \\text{Choices for Yann} \\times \\text{Choices for Camille} = 10 \\times 9 = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"
