            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a complex number z equals 1 plus i, and another complex number w which is (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). I need to find the absolute value of w, which is denoted as |w|. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for complex numbers, the absolute value or modulus |w| is the distance from the origin to the point represented by w in the complex plane. To find |w|, I think I need to express w in terms of its real and imaginary parts and then use the formula |w| = sqrt((real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2).\n\nSo, let me start by computing the numerator and the denominator of w separately. The numerator is 3z + 1, and the denominator is 5z + 7. Since z is given as 1 + i, I can just substitute that into these expressions.\n\nStarting with the numerator: 3z + 1. Substituting z = 1 + i, we have 3*(1 + i) + 1. Let's compute that:\n\n3*(1) = 3\n3*(i) = 3i\nSo, 3*(1 + i) = 3 + 3i\nAdding the +1, we get 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i\n\nOkay, so the numerator is 4 + 3i.\n\nNow, moving on to the denominator: 5z + 7. Again, substituting z = 1 + i:\n\n5*(1) = 5\n5*(i) = 5i\nSo, 5*(1 + i) = 5 + 5i\nAdding the +7, we get 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i\n\nSo, the denominator is 12 + 5i.\n\nNow, w is the numerator divided by the denominator, so w = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i). To find |w|, I can compute the modulus of the numerator and the modulus of the denominator separately and then divide them, because |w| = |numerator| / |denominator|.\n\nLet me compute the modulus of the numerator first. The numerator is 4 +"

Alternatively, maybe I can compute w by rationalizing the denominator to find its real and imaginary parts, then compute the modulus from there.\n\nLet me try that method as a cross-check. To rationalize the denominator, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i. So:\n\nw = (4 + 3i)/(12 + 5i) * (12 - 5i)/(12 - 5i)\n\nMultiplying the numerator: (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i)\nLet's compute that using FOIL:\n\n4*12 = 48\n4*(-5i) = -20i\n3i*12 = 36i\n3i*(-5i) = -15i^2\n\nCombining these terms:\n48 - 20i + 36i - 15i^2\n\nNow, i^2 is -1, so -15i^2 is +15.\n\nSo, 48 + 15 = 63. The imaginary parts are (-20i + 36i) = 16i.\n\nThus, the numerator becomes 63 + 16i.\n\nNow, the denominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i) = 12^2 - (5i)^2 = 144 - 25i^2 = 144 + 25 = 169.\n\nSo, w = (63 + 16i)/169 = (63/169) + (16/169)i.\n\nNow, let's compute |w| using the formula sqrt((real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2).\n\nReal part is 63/169, imaginary part is 16/169.\n\nSo, |w| = sqrt( (63/169)^2 + ("

            "output": "16/169)^2 ) = sqrt( (3969 + 256)/ (169)^2 ) = sqrt(4225 / 28561 )\n\nNow, 4225 is 65^2, and 28561 is 169^2, which is (13^2)^2 = 13^4. So sqrt(4225) = 65, sqrt(28561) = 169. So sqrt(4225/28561) = 65/169.\n\nSimplifying 65/169: both are divisible by 13. 65 ÷ 13 = 5, and 169 ÷13 =13. So, 5/13.\n\nHmm, so that's the same result as before. So, that cross-check confirms that |w|=5/13.\n\nWait, but in the first method, I just took |numerator| / |denominator|, which is |4 +3i| / |12 +5i| =5/13, same result. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think if there's another way to compute |w| directly without expanding. Since w = (3z +1)/(5z +7), then |w|=|3z +1| / |5z +7|.\n\nSo, |w| is the modulus of the numerator divided by the modulus of the denominator.\n\nSo that's |3z +1| / |5z +7|.\n\nSince z=1+i,\n\nCompute |3z +1|: that's |3(1 +i) +1| = |3 +3i +1| = |4 +3i|=5.\n\nCompute |5z +7|=|5(1 +i) +7| = |5 +5i +7|= |12 +5i|=13.\n\nSo, |w|=5/13.\n\nOkay, so all the methods confirm that |w| is 5/13.\n\nI think that's the answer. 5/13 can't be simplified further, so that's the final answer.\n</think>\n\nNow, let's go through the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Given**: \\( z = 1 + i \\).\n2. **Compute numerator**: \\( 3z + 1 \\).\n   - \\( 3z = 3(1 + i) = 3 + 3i \\).\n   - \\( 3"
