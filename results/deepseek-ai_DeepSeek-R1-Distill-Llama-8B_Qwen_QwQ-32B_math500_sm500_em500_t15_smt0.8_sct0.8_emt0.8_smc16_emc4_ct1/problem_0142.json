The superfactorial is defined as a tower of factorials, starting from n and going down to 1, connected by exponentiation. In this case, n is 4, so it's 4!^4!^...^4! with 4 levels. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should remember how the superfactorial works. For any number n, the superfactorial is n! raised to the power of itself n! times, but with the exponents stacked as factorials as well. So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}} with n levels. So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^4!)). So that's three levels of exponentiation starting from 4! at the top. Wait, no, the notation shows that there are n levels. So for n=4, it's 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}} with four factorials, right? Or is it four levels? Let me count: the top level is 4!, then the next is 4!^{4!}, then that raised to 4!, and then that raised to 4!. So four layers in total.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted. Let's see: the notation is n!^{n!^{...^{n!}}}} with n factorials. So for n=4, it's a tower of four 4!s. So, the structure is 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}. That's correct. So the superfactorial 4\\$ is 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of 4! raised to the power of 4!.\n\nNow, I need to find the units digit of this very large number. Since directly computing it is impossible, I should look for patterns in the units digits when dealing with exponentials, especially factorials"

So all the 4!s in the exponent tower are 24. So 4\\$ is 24^(24^(24^24)). Hmm, that's a tower of 24's, with three exponents? Wait, hold on. Let me confirm again. The problem says \"n\\$ = n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}\", so the number of levels in the exponent tower is equal to n!.\n\nWait, that might be a misinterpretation. Wait, hold on, the question says \"underbrace_{n!}\", meaning that the number of terms in the exponent tower is n!? That changes things. Wait, the notation might not be n levels, but the exponent tower has n! instances of n!.\n\nWait, this is critical. Let me re-read the problem definition.\n\n\"The superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}. What is the units digit of 4\\$?\"\n\nAh, okay. The underbrace specifies that there are n! copies of n! in the exponent tower. So for n=4, since 4! =24, so the exponent tower has 24 copies of 24? Wait, that would make it a tower with 24 terms? That's way too big. Wait, but the question says \"underbrace_{n!}\", meaning that the number of layers (the number of exponents stacked) is n!? That can't be, because that makes the number of layers extremely large. For n=4, the tower would have 24 layers? But the question asks for the units digit of 4\\$, which is a tower of 24 exponents? That's going to be almost impossible to compute directly, so there must be another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the underbrace is indicating that it's the number of n! terms.

Or maybe it's the exponent itself being n!.\n\nWait, perhaps I should interpret the notation more carefully. The superfactorial is defined as n!^{n!^{...^{n!}}} with n! exponents. Wait, that would mean for n=4, 4! is raised to the power of 4!^{4!^{...}} but with how many exponents? If it's n! exponents, that is 24, which is a very tall tower, but how does that work? Because it's written as n!^{...}, but the subscript says n!, which is 24.\n\nWait, maybe the superfactorial is a tower of n! exponents, each being n!. So for n=4, it's 4!^{4!^{...}} with 24 copies of 4! as exponents. But this is getting too confusing. Wait, perhaps I should check the standard definition of superfactorial.\n\nWait, upon a quick recall, the superfactorial is a tower of factorials, but more precisely, it's defined as n\\$ = n!^{n-1\\!} which is n!^{(n-1)!}. Wait, no, that's the standard superfactorial sometimes used in mathematics, but perhaps the problem is using a different definition.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, it's n!^{n!^{...^{n!}}} with n! in the subscript. So maybe the number of exponents is n! So for n=4, it's 24 terms of 4! as exponents, but that seems unwieldy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a tower whose height is n!, meaning the number of layers is n!. So for n=4, it would be a tower of 24 layers, each being 4!. But with 24 layers, even starting from 4, just as exponents, that's still hard to compute. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe I should think step by step, compute the tower by breaking it down into smaller parts, using modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 10, because we're only interested in the units digit.\n\nSo, since 4\\$ is 4!^{4!^{"

So for n=4, the tower has 24 terms of 24. But that's a tower of 24 24s. That's a tower of 24 exponents. So the expression is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24. That's an astronomically large number, but we can compute its units digit by using Euler's theorem or patterns in the units digit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a tower of n terms, each being n!.\n\nWait, maybe the problem's definition is different.

The underbrace is labeled n!, so that means the number of terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nTherefore, for n=4, the tower has 24 terms of 24.

To find the units digit, we can compute the value modulo 10. Since the units digit is the remainder when divided by 10. So we need to compute 24^(24^(24^...^24)) mod 10, with 24 exponents.\n\nBut even so, this is a tower of exponents, so we can use Euler's"

But 24 and 10 are not coprime because 24 is a multiple of 2, which is a factor of 10. So Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly here. Instead, we can look for patterns in the units digits of powers of 24.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the cycles of the units digit of 24^k.\n\nLet's compute 24^1 =24 → units digit 4\n\n24^2=576 → units digit 6\n\n24^3=13824 → units digit 4\n\n24^4=331776 → units digit 6\n\nSo the units digit cycles every 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nSo the pattern is period 2: 4,6,4,6,...\n\nTherefore, if we can find whether the exponent is odd or even, we can determine the units digit.\n\nWait, so in the tower 24^(24^(...)), with 24 exponents, the topmost exponent is 24. Then the next layer is 24^24, and so on, until the 24th layer.\n\nBut to compute the units digit of 24^(tower below), let's denote the tower's exponent as E, so the units digit of 24^E is determined by whether E is odd or even. Because the cycle length is 2.\n\nSo 24 has units digit cycle length 2: when the exponent is odd, units digit is 4; when even, units digit is 6.\n\nTherefore, if we can determine whether the exponent E is odd or even, we can find the units digit of 24^E.\n\nSo, let's compute E = 24^(24^(...)) with 23 more layers. So E is the result of a tower of 24 exponents starting from 24 down to 1.\n\nWait, no, the tower starts at 24 and goes down to 1, but in the problem, the tower has 24 layers of 24s.

So to compute the parity (even or odd) of E, since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so E is even. Therefore, the exponent E is even, so 24^E will have units digit 6.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the exponent E is 24^(24^(...^24)) with 23 copies. Since 24 is even, any exponentiation of 24 will still be even. So E is even. Therefore, 24^E mod 10 is 6.\n\nWait, but is that the case? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the exponent E is 24^(something). Since 24 is even, and any exponentiation of 24 will be even, so E is even. Therefore, the exponent is even, so 24^even has units digit 6. Therefore, the units digit is 6?\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller tower. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the tower is just 24^24. Then the exponent is 24, which is even, so units digit is 6. If the tower is 24^(24^24), then the exponent is 24^24, which is even, so again, 24^even is 6. So regardless of how tall the tower is, as long as the exponent is even, the result is 6 mod 10. Since all exponents in the tower are 24, which is even, so the exponent is even, so the result is 6.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again.

So T(1) = 24.\n\nT(2) = 24^24.\n\nT(3) = 24^(24^24).\n\n...\n\nT(24) = 24^(24^(...^24)) with 24 layers.\n\nWe need to find T(24) mod 10.\n\nTo compute T"

So instead, we can look at cycles in the units digit as I did before.\n\nAs observed earlier, 24^1 mod10=4, 24^2 mod10=6, 24^3 mod10=4, 24^4 mod10=6, etc., so the cycle is 4,6,4,6,... with period 2.\n\nTherefore, for any exponent E, 24^E mod10 is 4 if E is odd, and 6 if E is even.\n\nSo, T(k) mod10 depends on whether T(k-1) is odd or even.\n\nWait, T(k) =24^{T(k-1)}.\n\nSo to compute T(k) mod10, we need to know if T(k-1) is odd or even.\n\nSince T(k-1) is a tower starting with 24, which is even, and any tower built from exponents starting with an even base will result in even numbers, right?\n\nBecause 24 is even, and any power of an even number is even, so T(k-1) is even for any k.\n\nThus, T(k) =24^{T(k-1)}. Since T(k-1) is even, then 24^{even} will have units digit 6.\n\nTherefore, regardless of how many layers there are, as long as the exponent is even, the result is 6 mod10.\n\nHence, T(24) mod10=6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4\\$ is 6.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller n to see if this reasoning holds. Let's test n=1:\n\n1\\$ would be 1! =1. Units digit 1.\n\nn=2:\n\n2\\$ is 2!^{2!} =2^2=4. Units digit 4.\n\nn=3:\n\n3\\$ is 3!^{3!^{3!}} =6^{6^6} =6^{46656}.\n\nNow, 6 raised to any power is 6 mod10.
