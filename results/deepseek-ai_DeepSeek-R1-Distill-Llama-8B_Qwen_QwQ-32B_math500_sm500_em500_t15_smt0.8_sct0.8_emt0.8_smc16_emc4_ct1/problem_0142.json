Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that the units digit of a number is just the last digit of that number. So, for 4$$, I need to find the last digit of this huge tower of factorials. Let me start by understanding what 4\\$/4\\$/... means.\n\nWait, 4\\$/4\\$/4\\$... no, actually, according to the definition, 4\\$ is 4! raised to the power of 4!^{{4!^{{\u2026^{4!}}}}} n! times. Since n here is 4, it's 4!^{{4!^{{4!^{4!}}}}} with four 4!s. Wait, but n! is 24, so it's 4!^{24^{24^{24}}}? Is that right?\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check the definition again. The superfactorial n\\$ is n! raised to the power of n! raised to the power of n! and so on, n! times. So for n=4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!))) with four instances of 4!.\n\nSo that would be 24^(24^(24^24)). That's a huge number, way beyond what I can compute directly. But I just need the units digit, so maybe I can find a pattern or use properties of modular arithmetic.\n\nI remember that for units digits, we can compute modulo 10. So the units digit of a number N is N mod 10. Therefore, I need to find 24^(24^(24^24)) mod 10.\n\nBut 24 mod 10 is 4, and powers of 4 cycle in their units digits. Let me recall the cycle of 4: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc., every 2 steps. So the cycle length is 2. Therefore, if I can find the exponent mod 2, that will help me determine where in the cycle it falls.\n\n"

Since 24 mod 10 is 4, this is equivalent to 4^E mod 10. To compute 4^E mod 10, since the cycle length is 2, I need to find E mod 2.\n\nWait, but 4^1 mod 10 is 4, 4^2 mod 10 is 6, 4^3 mod 10 is 4 again, so the cycle is indeed 2. So if E is even, the result is 6; if odd, 4. Therefore, I need to find whether E is even or odd.\n\nBut E is 24^(24^24). Since 24 is even, any power of 24 is even, so 24^anything is even. Therefore, E is even. Therefore, 4^E mod 10 is 6. Wait, so does that mean the units digit is 6?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check again. Let me go step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem is 4\\$, which is 24^(24^(24^24)). Let me denote the tower as follows:\n\nLet me write the superfactorial as:\n\n4\\$ = 24^(24^(24^24))\n\nWait, actually, the definition says the number of exponents is n! which is 24. Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the problem says \"underbrace{n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}\" so the number of n! terms in the exponent tower is n!.\n\nWait, so for n=4, n! is 24, so the tower has 24 instances of 24? Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, so the superfactorial is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 copies of 24 in the exponent tower. That's way bigger than I thought. So my previous approach was wrong because I thought it was 4 instances"

That changes everything.\n\nSo let's correct my approach. So it's a tower of 24s, 24 levels high. So the computation is:\n\n4\\$ = 24^(24^(24^(...^24))) with 24 24s.\n\nSo, the number is huge, but to find the units digit, I can work mod 10.\n\nSo, first, 24 mod 10 is 4, so I can write 4^E mod 10, where E is the exponent tower starting with 24 and having 23 more 24s.\n\nBut to compute 4^E mod 10, I can look at the cycle of 4.\n\nAs before, 4 has a cycle of 2: 4, 6, 4, 6, etc. So the units digit cycles every 2. Therefore, to find 4^E mod 10, I need E mod 2.\n\nIf E is even, the result is 6; if E is odd, it's 4. So the problem reduces to finding whether E is even or odd.\n\nNow, E is the exponent: 24^(24^...24) with 23 more 24s. So E is 24^(something). Let me denote F = 24^(24^...^24) with 23 24s. So E = 24^F.\n\nNow, 24 is even, so any power of 24 is even, so E is 24^F, which is even, since F is at least 1 (as 24^1 =24). Therefore, E is even. Then, 4^E mod 10 is 6. So the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but let me be more precise. Let me try to apply Euler's theorem to find 4^E mod 10.\n\nEuler's theorem states that if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n, where \u03c6(n) is Euler's totient function. Since 4 and 10 are not coprime (they share a factor of 2), Euler's theorem doesn't apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, I"

So exponent mod 2.\n\nTherefore, since E is even, exponent is even, so 4^even mod 10 is 6. So the answer is 6?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me see if there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider the exponent tower more carefully. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote the tower as follows:\n\nLet me define the tower from the top down. Let me denote the tower with k levels as T(k). So T(1) =24, T(2)=24^24, T(3)=24^(24^24), and so on up to T(24).\n\nWe need to compute T(24) mod 10. Since T(24) =24^T(23). So to compute T(24) mod 10, we can compute 24^{T(23)} mod 10. Since 24 mod 10 is 4, so it's 4^{T(23)} mod 10.\n\nTo compute 4^{T(23)} mod 10, as before, since 4 has a cycle of 2 mod 10, we need T(23) mod 2.\n\nNow, T(23) is 24^{T(22)}. Since 24 is even, any exponentiation of 24 will be even, so T(22) is some exponent, but 24^{anything} is even, so T(23) is even. Therefore, T(23) mod 2 is 0. Therefore, 4^{even} mod 10 is 6. So the result is 6.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller tower to see if this holds.\n\nSuppose I have a tower of 2 levels: 24^24. Then mod 10, that's 4^24 mod 10.

But 24 is even, so 24^24 is even, so exponent is even, so 4^even mod10 is6.\n\nWait, but in the 3-level case, the exponent is 24^(24), which is even, so 4^even mod10 is 6, so 3-level tower mod10 is6.\n\nSame with 4-level: 24^(24^(24^24)), mod10 is 4^(24^(24^24)) mod10. Let's see:\n\nCompute exponent: 24^(24^24). As above, 24 is even, so any power of 24 is even, so exponent is even. So 4^even is6.\n\nWait, so in general, for any tower of 24s with height >=2, T(k)=24^(T(k-1)), and since T(k-1) is at least 24^24 >2, which is even, T(k) will be even. So T(k) mod2=0, so 4^T(k) mod10=6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of 4\\$ is6.\n\nWait, but let me test with an even smaller tower to be absolutely sure.\n\nSuppose we have a tower of 1: 24.
