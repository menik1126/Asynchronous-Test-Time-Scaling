            "output": "First, I recognize that the given series is the sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 and ending at 199.\n\nThe total number of terms in the series can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an odd number sequence: \\(a_n = 2n - 1\\). Setting \\(a_n = 199\\), I solve for \\(n\\) to find there are 100 terms.\n\nNext, I recall that the sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is given by the formula \\(S_n = n^2\\). Applying this formula with \\(n = 100\\), the sum is \\(100^2 = 10,000\\).\n\nFinally, to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 7, I calculate \\(10,000 \\div 7\\). The division yields a quotient of 1,428 and a remainder of 1. Therefore, the modulo 7 remainder of the sum is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo find the modulo \\(7\\) remainder of the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**:\n   The given series is the sum of the first 100 odd numbers because:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 2n - 1\n   \\]\n   Setting \\(a_n = 199\\):\n   \\[\n   199 = 2n - 1 \\implies n = 100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of the First \\(n\\) Odd Numbers**:\n   The sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is a well-known formula:\n   \\[\n   S_n = n^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(n = 100\\):\n   \\[\n   S_{100} = 100^2 = 10,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Modulo 7**:\n   Now, find \\(10,000 \\mod 7\\):\n   \\[\n   10,000 \\div 7 = 1,428 \\text{ with a remainder of } 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   10,000 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
