            "output": "To find the remainder when the sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 199 is divided by 7, I first recognize that this series forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n\nNext, I determine the total number of terms in the sequence. Since the last term is 199, I divide by 2 to find that there are 100 terms in total.\n\nThen, I calculate the sum of the first \\( n \\) terms of an arithmetic sequence using the formula \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_n) \\). Substituting the values, the sum is \\( \\frac{100}{2} \\times (1 + 199) = 50 \\times 200 = 10,000 \\).\n\nFinally, I find the remainder when 10,000 is divided by 7 by performing the division. The division of 10,000 by 7 gives a quotient of 1,428 and a remainder of 4.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the sum is divided by 7 is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when the sum \\(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 195 + 197 + 199\\) is divided by 7, follow these steps:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the Series:**\n   The given series is the sum of consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 up to 199. This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a = 1\\) and a common difference \\(d = 2\\).\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Terms (\\(n\\)):**\n   To find the number of terms, use the formula for the \\(n^{th}\\) term of an arithmetic sequence:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a + (n - 1)d\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(a_n = 199\\), \\(a = 1\\), and \\(d = 2\\).\n   \\[\n   199 = 1 + (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n   198 = (n - 1) \\times 2 \\\\\n   n - 1 = 99 \\\\\n   n = 100\n   \\]\n   So, there are 100 terms in the series.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum of the Series (\\("
