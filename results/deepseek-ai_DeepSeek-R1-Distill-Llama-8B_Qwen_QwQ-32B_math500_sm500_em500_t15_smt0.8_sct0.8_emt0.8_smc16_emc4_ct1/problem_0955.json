The coefficients are 10, 4, and 8, while the variables are r raised to different exponents: r³, r⁶, and r⁴.\n\nNext, I'll multiply the coefficients together: 10 * 4 * 8. This gives me 320.\n\nThen, I'll combine the variables by adding their exponents since the base \\( r \\) is the same. So, r³ multiplied by r⁶ is r⁹, and then divided by r⁴, which simplifies to r⁵.\n\nFinally, I'll combine the simplified coefficients with the variables to get the final expression: \\(\\frac{320r^5}{1}\\), which can be written as 320r⁵.\n</think>\n\nLet's simplify the expression step by step.\n\n**Given Expression:**\n\\[\n\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Multiply the numerators.**\n\\[\n10 \\times 4 = 40\n\\]\n\\[\nr^3 \\times r^6 = r^{3+6} = r^9\n\\]\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n\\[\n40r^9\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Divide by the denominator.**\n\\[\n\\frac{40r^9}{8r^4} = \\frac{40}{8} \\times \\frac{r^9}{r^4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{40}{8} = 5\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{r^9}{r^4} = r^{9-4} = r^5\n\\]\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n5r^5\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5r^5}\n\\]"
