            "output": "Okay, so I have this equation: (x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3. Hmm, I need to find the roots of this equation. Alright, first, let me try to understand what's going on here. Both sides are cubic terms, so maybe there's a way to simplify this. \n\nHmm, on the left side, I have two cubes being added, and on the right side, another cube. Maybe I can factor this or find a common term. Let me look at the terms on the left: (x - 3) and (x - 7). Hmm, if I add those two binomials, maybe something will cancel out. Let me try that.\n\n(x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10. Oh, wait a second! That's exactly the same as the term on the right side of the equation. Interesting. So, the sum of (x - 3) and (x - 7) is 2x - 10, which is the cube root of the right side. So, maybe there's a relationship here between the sum of cubes and the cube of the sum.\n\nI remember that there's a formula for a^3 + b^3, which is (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2). Maybe I can apply that here. Let me try that. So, the left side can be written as (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2), where a = (x - 3) and b = (x - 7). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, a + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10, which we already saw. Then, a^2 = (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9, and b^2 = (x - 7)^2 = x^2 - 14x + 49. Next, ab = (x - 3)(x - 7) = x^2 - 10x + 21. So, putting it all together, the left side becomes:\n\n(2x - 10)[(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21)"

That is:\n\n(x^2 - 6x + 9) - (x^2 - 10x + 21) + (x^2 - 14x + 49).\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n= x^2 - 6x + 9 - x^2 + 10x - 21 + x^2 - 14x + 49.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. The x^2 terms: x^2 - x^2 + x^2 = x^2.\n\nThe x terms: -6x + 10x -14x = (-6 + 10 -14)x = (-10)x.\n\nThe constants: 9 -21 +49 = (9 + 49) -21 = 58 -21 = 37.\n\nSo, the entire expression inside the brackets simplifies to x^2 -10x +37.\n\nTherefore, the left side is (2x -10)(x^2 -10x +37).\n\nSo, the original equation becomes:\n\n(2x -10)(x^2 -10x +37) = (2x -10)^3.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, both sides have a factor of (2x -10). Maybe I can factor that out. Let's subtract (2x -10)^3 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n(2x -10)(x^2 -10x +37) - (2x -10)^3 = 0.\n\nFactor out (2x -10):\n\n(2x -10)[x^2 -10x +37 - (2x -10)^2] = 0.\n\nOkay, so now we have a product of two terms equal to zero. That means either (2x -10) = 0 or the term in the brackets is zero.\n\nLet's solve each possibility.\n\nFirst possibility: 2x -10 = 0.\n\nSolving for x: 2x = 10 → x = 5.\n\nSo, x = 5 is one root.\n\nNow, let's consider the second possibility: x^2 -10x +37 - (2x -10)^2 = 0.\n\nLet me expand (2x"

Let's write it as:\n\n-3x^2 +30x -63 = 0.\n\nI can multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficients positive:\n\n3x^2 -30x +63 = 0.\n\nNow, let's see if we can factor this or use the quadratic formula. Let me check the discriminant first.\n\nDiscriminant D = b² -4ac = (-30)^2 -4*3*63 = 900 - 756 = 144.\n\nSince D is positive, there are two real roots.\n\nSo, x = [30 ± sqrt(144)] / (2*3) = [30 ±12]/6.\n\nSo, first root: (30 +12)/6 = 42/6 =7.\n\nSecond root: (30 -12)/6 =18/6=3.\n\nSo, the solutions are x=7 and x=3.\n\nWait, so from the second factor, we have x=7 and x=3.\n\nWait, but in the original equation, plugging x=3:\n\nLeft side: (3-3)^3 + (3-7)^3 = 0 + (-4)^3 = -64.\n\nRight side: (2*3 -10)^3= (6-10)^3 = (-4)^3= -64.\n\nSo, x=3 is a root.\n\nSimilarly, x=7:\n\nLeft side: (7-3)^3 + (7-7)^3= 4^3 +0=64.\n\nRight side: (14-10)^3=4^3=64.\n\nSo, x=7 is a root"

When I factored the equation, I had (2x -10) times (x^2 -10x +37 - (2x -10)^2) =0, leading to roots at 2x-10=0 (x=5) and x^2 -10x +37 - (4x^2 -40x +100)=0, which we solved as x=3 and x=7.\n\nBut let me think: does this imply that all three roots are 3,5,7? Let's check if these are all distinct.\n\nYes, 3,5,7 are distinct, so that's three roots for this cubic equation, which makes sense because a cubic can have up to three real roots.\n\nWait, actually, when we factored, it looked like we had a linear term and a quadratic term, each giving one or two roots, so that adds up to three roots in total.
