I remember that when dealing with cubic equations, there are some identities that might help simplify things. \n\nFirst, I notice that both sides have cubic terms, so maybe expanding them could lead to some cancellation or simplification. Let me write down the equation again:\n\n\\[\n(x - 3)^3 + (x - 7)^3 = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nHmm, maybe I can let \\( a = x - 3 \\) and \\( b = x - 7 \\) to make it easier. Then the equation becomes \\( a^3 + b^3 = (2x - 10)^3 \\). But what is \\(2x - 10\\) in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Let me calculate:\n\nSince \\(a = x - 3\\) and \\(b = x - 7\\), subtracting them gives \\(a - b = (x - 3) - (x - 7) = 4\\). So, \\(a - b = 4\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nWait, I remember that \\(a^3 + b^3\\) can be factored as \\((a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\\). Maybe that could be useful here. Let me try that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (2x - 10)^3\n\\]\n\nSo, I need to find an expression for \\(a + b\\) and \\(a^2 - ab + b^2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(a + b\\):\n\n\\[\na + b = (x - 3) + (x - 7) = 2x - 10\n\\]\n\nOh! That's interesting because the right-hand side is \\((2x - 10)^3\\). So, \\(a + b = 2x - 10\\), which is the same as the base of the cube on the right side. Let me denote \\(c = 2x - 10\\), so \\(a + b = c\\) and the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nc \\cdot (a^"
