            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this equation: 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky because it has exponents with different bases. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that 3^{2x} can be rewritten as (3^2)^x, which is 9^x. So, the equation becomes 9^x + 19 = 10^x. That simplifies it a bit, but I still have two exponential terms. Maybe I can find a way to make the bases the same or find a substitution.\n\nLet me try substituting y for 10^x. If I let y = 10^x, then 9^x can be expressed in terms of y. Since 9 is 10^(log10(9)), which is approximately 10^0.9542. Wait, that might complicate things, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the logarithm of both sides, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here because of the addition of 19. Logarithms don't handle addition well. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I can rearrange the equation to isolate one of the exponentials. Let's try moving 9^x to the right side: 19 = 10^x - 9^x. That gives me 19 = 10^x - 9^x. Now, both 10^x and 9^x are exponential functions, and their difference equals 19.\n\nI know that 10^x grows faster than 9^x as x increases, but I need to find when their difference is 19. Maybe I can test some integer values of x to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet me try x = 1: 10^1 - 9^1 = 10 - 9 = 1. That's way less than 19.\n\nx = 2: 100 - 81 = 19. Oh, that works! So, x = 2 is a solution. Let me check if there are more solutions.\n\nWait, is there another x where 10^x - 9^x = 19? Let me test x = 3: 1000 - 729 = 271. That's much larger than 19. So, between x=2 and x=3,"

What about x less than 2?\n\nWe saw that at x=1, it was 1, and since both functions are increasing, 10^x - 9^x is also increasing. So, it only crosses 19 once at x=2. Therefore, the only solution is x=2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x \\):\n\n1.
