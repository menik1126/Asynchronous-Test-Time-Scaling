I'm not super confident with exponential equations, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I remember that \\(3^{2x}\\) can be rewritten as \\((3^2)^x\\), which simplifies to \\(9^x\\). So, the equation becomes \\(9^x + 19 = 10^x\\). That seems a bit simpler, but I'm not sure where to go from here.\n\nMaybe I can rearrange the equation to get all the exponential terms on one side. Let me subtract \\(9^x\\) from both sides: \\(19 = 10^x - 9^x\\). Hmm, that gives me \\(10^x - 9^x = 19\\). I wonder if there's a way to solve for \\(x\\) here.\n\nI know that equations with different bases can sometimes be tricky. Maybe I can take logarithms of both sides, but I'm not sure if that will help directly. Wait, logarithms are useful when you have variables in exponents, but here I have both \\(10^x\\) and \\(9^x\\) in the same equation. It might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express both sides with the same base or find a substitution. Let me think about possible integer values for \\(x\\) that might satisfy the equation. Sometimes, exponential equations have integer solutions, so testing small integers could be a good approach.\n\nLet me try \\(x=1\\): \\(9^1 + 19 = 9 + 19 = 28\\), and \\(10^1 = 10\\). So, 28 ≠ 10. Not a solution.\n\nHow about \\(x=2\\): \\(9^2 + 19 = 81 + 19 = 100\\), and \\(10^2 = 100\\). Oh! 100 equals 100. So, \\(x=2\\) is a solution. Wait, is that the only solution?\n\nI should check if there's another possible solution. Maybe for a negative \\(x\\) or a non-integer value.

Let's try \\(x=-1\\): \\(9^{-1} + 19 = \\frac{1}{9} + 19 ≈ 0.111 + 19 = 19.111\\), and \\(10^{-1} = 0.1\\). 19.111 ≈ 0.1? No, that's not equal. So, \\(x=2\\) seems to be the only solution.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another positive solution. Let me think about how the functions \\(9^x\\) and \\(10^x\\) behave. Both are exponential functions increasing as \\(x\\) increases, but \\(10^x\\) grows faster than \\(9^x\\). So, as \\(x\\) increases, \\(10^x\\) will surpass \\(9^x\\), but they might intersect at some point.\n\nWait, at \\(x=2\\), we have equality. For \\(x > 2\\), \\(10^x\\) is greater than \\(9^x\\), so \\(10^x - 9^x\\) will be increasing. For \\(x=1\\), \\(10^1 - 9^1 = 10 - 9 = 1\\), which is much less than 19. At \\(x=2\\), it's 100 - 81 = 19, which is exactly the value we need. So, for \\(x > 2\\), the difference \\(10^x - 9^x\\) increases beyond 19, meaning \\(x=2\\) is the only positive solution.\n\nWhat about for \\(x < 2\\)? Let's check \\(x=1.5\\): \\(10^{1.5} ≈ 31.62\\) and \\(9^{1.5} = 27\\). So, \\(31.62 - 27 ≈ 4.62\\), which is less than 19. Hmm, so between \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=2\\), the difference goes from 1 to 19.

So, their difference is about 4.62, which is still less than 19.\n\nWhat about \\(x=1.8\\): \\(10^{1.8} ≈ 10^{1} \\times 10^{0.8} ≈ 10 \\times 6.3096 ≈ 63.096\\), and \\(9^{1.8} = 9^{1} \\times 9^{0.8}\\). \\(9^{0.8} = (3^2)^{0.8} = 3^{1.6} ≈ 4.655\\). So, \\(9^{1.8} ≈ 9 \\times 4.655 ≈ 41.995\\). The difference is 63.096 - 41.995 ≈ 21.101, which is more than 19. So, at \\(x=1.8\\), the difference is about 21.101, which is greater than 19.\n\nSo, between \\(x=1.5\\) and \\(x=1.8\\), the difference goes from ~4.62 to ~21.101, while we're looking for the difference to be exactly 19. Therefore, there must be another solution between \\(x=1.5\\) and \\(x=1.8\\).\n\nWait a minute, that complicates things. So, maybe \\(x=2\\) isn't the only solution. Hmm, maybe I need a better approach, like using logarithms or graphing.\n\nLet me try taking natural logarithms on both sides of the equation \\(10^x - 9^x = 19\\). But that seems difficult because it's a difference of two exponentials. Maybe I can write it as \\(10^x = 9^x + 19\\), and then take the natural log, but it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let \\(y = 10^x\\) and \\(z = 9^x\\"

Plugging that into the first equation: \\((10/9)^x \\times z - z = 19\\). Factoring out \\(z\\), we get \\(z \\times [ (10/9)^x - 1 ] = 19\\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps. It introduces another variable, but since both \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are functions of \\(x\\), maybe I can express this in terms of \\(y\\) or \\(z\\). Hmm, perhaps not the most straightforward approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can divide both sides of the original equation by \\(9^x\\) to normalize it. Let me try that:\n\n\\( \\frac{10^x}{9^x} - 1 = \\frac{19}{9^x} \\)\n\nSimplifying the left side: \\( \\left( \\frac{10}{9} \\right)^x - 1 = \\frac{19}{9^x} \\)\n\nHmm, that might not help much either, but perhaps I can set \\(t = \\left( \\frac{10}{9} \\right)^x\\), so that the equation becomes \\(t - 1 = \\frac{19}{9^x}\\). But since \\(t = \\left( \\frac{10}{9} \\right)^x\\), then \\(9^x = \\left( \\frac{9}{10} \\right)^x = \\left( \\frac{10}{9} \\right)^{-x} = t^{-1}\\). So, substituting back, \\(t - 1 = 19 \\times t^{-1}\\).\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(t\\) to eliminate the denominator: \\(t^2 - t = 19\\), which becomes \\(t^2 - t - 19 = 0\\). Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of \\(t\\), which I can solve using the quadratic formula.\n\nSo, \\(t = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 76)] / 2 = [1 ± sqrt(77)] / "
