I'm a bit nervous because it's been a while since I did algebra, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an equation with a square root, a common strategy is to isolate the square root term and then square both sides to eliminate it. That makes sense because squaring can sometimes get rid of the root, but I have to be careful because squaring both sides can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. So, I need to check my answers at the end.\n\nSo, starting with the equation:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\]\n\nI think I should subtract 4 from both sides to get the square root by itself. Let me do that:\n\n\\[ x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\]\n\nOkay, now the square root is isolated. The next step is to square both sides to get rid of the square root. But before I do that, I should make sure that whatever I'm dealing with is valid. The expression inside the square root, \\( 11 - 2x \\), has to be non-negative because you can't have a square root of a negative number in real numbers. So, I should note that:\n\n\\[ 11 - 2x \\geq 0 \\]\n\\[ -2x \\geq -11 \\]\nDividing both sides by -2 (and remembering to flip the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number):\n\\[ x \\leq \\frac{11}{2} \\]\n\\[ x \\leq 5.5 \\]\n\nSo, whatever solution I find, it must be less than or equal to 5.5. That's good to know because it might help me later when checking if my solution is valid.\n\nNow, back to the equation:\n\\[ x - 4 = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} \\]\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\\[ (x - 4)^2 = (\\sqrt{11 - 2x})^2 \\]\n\\[ x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x \\]\n\nOkay, so now I have a quadratic equation. Let me bring all the terms to one side to solve for x. Subtract 11"

            "output": " and add 2x to both sides:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0 \\]\nSimplify the left side:\nCombine like terms. The \\( -8x + 2x \\) is \\( -6x \\). And 16 - 11 is 5.\nSo,\n\\[ x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 \\]\n\nHmm, now I have a quadratic equation. Let me factor it.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add to -6. Well, factors of 5 are 1 and 5. So, 1 and 5 add up to 6. Since the middle term is -6x, both numbers will be negative.\n\nSo, factors:\n\\[ (x - 5)(x - 1) = 0 \\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the potential solutions:\n1. \\( x - 5 = 0 \\) => \\( x = 5 \\)\n2. \\( x - 1 = 0 \\) => \\( x = 1 \\)\n\nNow, I have two solutions: x = 5 and x = 1. But remember earlier, I noted that x must be less than or equal to 5.5, which both 5 and 1 satisfy. However, I must check each solution in the original equation because squaring both sides can sometimes introduce solutions that don't actually work.\n\nLet's check x = 5 first:\nOriginal equation:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{11 - 2x} + 4 \\]\nSubstitute x = 5:\nLeft side: 5\nRight side: \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2*5} + 4 \\) = \\( \\sqrt{11 - 10} + 4 \\) = \\( \\sqrt{1} + 4 \\) = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, 5 = 5. That works. So, x = 5 is a valid solution.\n\nNow, check x = 1:\nSubstitute x = 1 into the original equation:\nLeft side: 1\nRight side: \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2*1} + 4 \\) = \\( \\sqrt{11 - 2} + 4 \\) = \\( \\sqrt{9} + 4 \\) = 3 + 4 ="

Therefore, we must discard it.\n\nWait, so even though x = 1 satisfies the quadratic equation, it doesn't satisfy the original equation. So, that's why we must check solutions after squaring both sides.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake when substituting x = 1. Let me double-check:\n\nIf x = 1:\nLeft side: 1\nRight side: sqrt(11 - 2*1) + 4 = sqrt(9) + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nYes, 1 is not equal to 7. So, x = 1 is definitely an extraneous solution.\n\nWait, but let me consider if I did everything correctly when squaring both sides. Let me retrace my steps.\n\nOriginal equation:\nx = sqrt(11 - 2x) + 4\n\nSubtract 4:\nx - 4 = sqrt(11 - 2x)\n\nSquare both sides:\n(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x\n\nExpand left side:\nx² - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x\n\nBring all terms to left side:\nx² - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0\nSimplify:\nx² - 6x + 5 = 0\n\nFactor:\n(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSo, the process seems correct.\n\nWait, but when we square both sides, the left side was x - 4, so squaring gives us x² -8x +16. The right side was sqrt(11 - 2x), squaring gives us 11 - 2x. So, that seems correct. Then bringing all terms to left:\n\nx² - 8x +16 -11 +2x = 0\n\nSimplify:\nx² -6x +5 =0, which factors correctly to (x-5)(x-1)=0.\n\nSo, yes, x=5 and x=1 are roots.\n\nBut only x=5 satisfies the original equation.\n\nSo, final answer: x=5.\n\nWait, just to make sure, is there another step I missed?\n\n"

            "output": "Alternatively, maybe I should check the domain again. The original equation has sqrt(11 -2x). The expression under the square root must be non-negative, so 11 -2x >=0 => x <=5.5. Also, the left side of the original equation is x, and the right side is sqrt(11-2x) +4. Since sqrt(11-2x) is non-negative, the right side is at least 4. Therefore, x must be at least 4. So, the domain for x is [4, 5.5].\n\nWait, that's an important point. Let me think again.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is sqrt(11 -2x) +4. Since sqrt(11 -2x) is non-negative, the smallest value RHS can take is when sqrt(11 -2x) is 0, which would be when 11 -2x =0, so x=5.5. Then RHS would be 0 +4 =4. So, the RHS is always >=4. The left-hand side (LHS) is x. Therefore, for the equation to hold, x must be at least 4. So, the domain is actually x >=4 and x <=5.5. So, x must be in [4, 5.5].\n\nTherefore, x=1 is not in the domain, so it's invalid. x=5 is in the domain, so it's valid. So, that's another way to see that x=1 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=5.\n\nHmm, so that's the conclusion. Let me just recap all steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Start with equation: x = sqrt(11 -2x) +4.\n\n2. Subtract 4: x -4 = sqrt(11 -2x).\n\n3. Square both sides: (x-4)^2 = 11 -2x.\n\n4. Expand and simplify to quadratic equation: x² -6x +5 =0.\n\n5. Factor to (x-5)(x-1)=0, so x=5 or x=1.\n\n6. Check domain: x must be between 4 and 5.5, so x=1 is out.\n\n7. Check solutions in original equation: x=5"
