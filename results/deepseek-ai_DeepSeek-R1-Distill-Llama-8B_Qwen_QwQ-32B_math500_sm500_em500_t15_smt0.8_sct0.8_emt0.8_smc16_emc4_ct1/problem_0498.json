Therefore, the number of students taking at least one subject is 360 - 15 = 345.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets:\nC \u222a P \u222a Ch = C + P + Ch - C \u2229 P - C \u2229 Ch - P \u2229 Ch + C \u2229 P \u2229 Ch\n\nGiven that 75 students take both Calculus and Chemistry, 75 take both Physics and Chemistry, and 30 take both Calculus and Physics, and assuming no one takes all three subjects:\nC \u222a P \u222a Ch = 180 + x + 2x - 30 - 75 - 75 + 0\n\nSo, 345 = 180 + 3x - 180\nThis simplifies to 345 = 3x\nTherefore, x = 115\n\nThus, the number of students taking Physics is 115.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to find the number of students taking **Physics**.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Total students in the school: **360**\n   - Students taking **none** of the subjects: **15**\n   - Students taking **Calculus (C)**: **180**\n   - Students taking **Physics (P)**: Let's denote this as **x**\n   - Students taking **Chemistry (Ch)**: Since twice as many take Chemistry as Physics, this is **2x**\n\n2. **Calculate Students Taking at Least One Subject:**\n   - Total students taking at least one subject = Total students - Students taking none\n   - \\( 360 - 15 = 345 \\)\n\n3. **Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for Three Sets:**\n   \\[\n   C \\cup P \\cup Ch = C + P + Ch - (C \\cap P) - (C \\cap Ch) - (P \\cap Ch) + (C \\cap P \\cap Ch)\n   \\]\n   - \\( C \\cup P \\"
