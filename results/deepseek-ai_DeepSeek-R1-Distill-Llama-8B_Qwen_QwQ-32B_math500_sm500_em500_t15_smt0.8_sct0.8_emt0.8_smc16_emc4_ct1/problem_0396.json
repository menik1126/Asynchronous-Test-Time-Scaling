            "output": "To find the height of the cylinder, I'll start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = πr²h. Here, the volume is given as 45π cubic centimeters, and the radius r is 3 centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll substitute the known values into the volume formula. Plugging in the numbers, the equation becomes 45π = π(3)²h. Simplifying further, this simplifies to 45π = π(9)h.\n\nI can cancel out the π from both sides of the equation, which leaves me with 45 = 9h. To solve for h, I'll divide both sides by 9, resulting in h = 5. Therefore, the height of the cylinder is 5 centimeters.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the height \\( h \\) of the cylinder, we'll use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the volume,\n- \\( r \\) is the radius,\n- \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nGiven:\n- Volume \\( V = 45\\pi \\) cm³,\n- Radius \\( r = 3 \\) cm.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Plug the known values into the volume formula:**\n   \\[\n   45\\pi = \\pi (3)^2 h\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the equation:**\n   \\[\n   45\\pi = \\pi \\cdot 9 \\cdot h\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\) to cancel it out:**\n   \\[\n   45 = 9h\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides by 9:**\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{45}{9} = 5\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
