            "output": "First, I need to find the proper divisors of 284. Proper divisors are all the positive integers that divide 284 without leaving a remainder, excluding 284 itself.\n\nI'll start by identifying the prime factors of 284. \n\n284 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 284 by 2 gives 142. \n\nNext, 142 is also even, so it can be divided by 2 again, resulting in 71.\n\nNow, 71 is a prime number since it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71.\n\nWith the prime factors known, I can list all the proper divisors of 284 by combining the prime factors in different ways.\n\nThe proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the sum of these proper divisors.\n\nAdding them together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220.\n\nSo, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of this sum, which is 220.\n\nTo find the proper divisors of 220, I'll start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n220 can be divided by 2, giving 110. Dividing 110 by 2 again results in 55.\n\n55 is divisible by 5, providing 11.\n\nSince 11 is a prime number, the prime factors of 220 are 2 squared, 5, and 11.\n\nUsing these prime factors, I can list all the proper divisors of 220 by combining the factors in different ways.\n\nThe proper divisors of 220 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the sum of these proper divisors.\n\nAdding them together: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 273.\n\nSo, the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 273.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of"
