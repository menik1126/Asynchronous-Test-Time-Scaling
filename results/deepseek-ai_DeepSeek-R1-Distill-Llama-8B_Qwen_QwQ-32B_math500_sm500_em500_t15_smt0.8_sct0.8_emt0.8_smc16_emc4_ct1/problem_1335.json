Let me see how I can approach this. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with equations involving multiple fractions, sometimes it's helpful to combine them over a common denominator. But this seems like it might get really messy because each term has a different denominator. The denominators are \\(x^2 - 1\\), \\(x^2 - 2\\), \\(x^2 - 3\\), and \\(x^2 - 4\\). Each of these is a quadratic, so their denominators are quite distinct, which probably means finding a common denominator would involve a lot of cross-multiplying.\n\nBefore I dive into that, let me consider if there's another way. The equation is set equal to a linear term on the right side, \\(2010x - 4\\). On the left, each term is a rational function with a quadratic denominator. So, maybe I can manipulate the equation such that I can express it as a polynomial equation, which would make it easier to find the solutions and sum them up.\n\nI recall that sometimes, when dealing with equations involving fractions, multiplying both sides by the common denominator can help eliminate the denominators. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, denote the left-hand side as \\(LHS\\) and the right-hand side as \\(RHS\\):\n\n\\[\nLHS = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4},\n\\]\n\\[\nRHS = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation is \\(LHS = RHS\\). To eliminate the denominators, I can multiply both sides by the product of all the denominators. That would be \\((x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). But that seems like a huge multiplication. Wait, maybe"

            "output": " it's manageable? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can simplify this equation in another way. Let me see if the denominators have any relationship. Each denominator is \\(x^2 - k\\), where \\(k\\) is from 1 to 4. So, each term in the LHS is \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\) for \\(k =1,2,3,4\\). Wait a second, actually in the problem the numerators are 1,2,3,4 respectively, and denominators are \\(x^2 -1\\), etc. So actually each term is \\(\\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\). Interesting.\n\nTherefore, the LHS is \\(\\sum_{k=1}^4 \\frac{k}{x^2 - k}\\). Hmm, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can exploit? Maybe we can rewrite each term as something?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is asking for the sum of all complex solutions, maybe we can consider Vieta’s formula once we get a polynomial equation. Vieta's formulas relate the sum of roots to the coefficients, so that might be a way to go. But to use Vieta, we need the equation to be a polynomial equation. So, even though multiplying through by the denominators will give a polynomial, but the resulting polynomial could be of high degree, making it difficult to track the coefficients. But maybe there's a trick here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can substitute \\(y = x^2\\). Let me see if that helps. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet \\(y = x^2\\). Then, the denominators become \\(y - 1\\), \\(y - 2\\), \\(y - 3\\), \\(y - 4\\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{y - 1} + \\frac{2}{y - 2} + \\frac{3}{y - 3} + \\frac{4}{y - 4} = 2010x - 4.\n\\]\n\nHmm, but \\(y = x^2\\), so on the right side we still have an \\(x\\) term, which complicates things because \\(x\\) is related to \\(y\\) through a square root. So this substitution might not help directly because we still have both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Unless"

Let me think again. D is a quartic in x^2, so it's degree 8. Then, when we multiply D by (2010x -4), it becomes degree 9. So, the RHS is a degree 9 polynomial.\n\nThe left side, 9x^6 -61x^4 +124x^2 -72, is a degree 6 polynomial.

Wait, complex roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs, but the equation is not necessarily with real coefficients because the original equation had a RHS with a linear term, so when moving terms over, the coefficients might not be all real? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, all the coefficients in the original equation are real. Because the LHS has real coefficients, and the RHS is 2010x -4, which has real coefficients. Therefore, the polynomial equation we get after moving everything to the left should have real coefficients as well.

Therefore, the sum of the roots in the polynomial equation, which is 2/1005, is equal to the sum of the solutions of the original equation.\n\nWow, that's smart! So, despite multiplying by D, which introduces extraneous roots, their sum is zero, so we don't have to worry about subtracting anything. Therefore, the sum is 2/1005.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2/1005.\n\nI should double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nFirst, when I expanded D, I correctly expanded each term step by step. Then, I correctly identified that D*(2010x -4) gives a leading term of 2010x^9 and a coefficient of x^8 as -4. Then, in the equation, the LHS is a 6th-degree polynomial, and after moving everything to the left, we get a 9th-degree polynomial with leading term -2010x^9 and x^8 coefficient +4. Then, applying Vieta's formula, the sum is -4 / -2010 = 2/1005.\n\nAdditionally, the sum of the extraneous roots is zero, so the sum we found is correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 2/1005.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of all complex solutions is \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{1005}}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} + \\frac{2}{x^2 - 2} + \\frac{3}{x^2 - 3} + \\frac{4}{x^2 - 4} = 2010x - 4,\n\\]\n\nwe start by multiplying both sides by the product of all denominators, \\(D = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 4)\\). This gives us:\n\n\\[\n2(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 3)(x"
