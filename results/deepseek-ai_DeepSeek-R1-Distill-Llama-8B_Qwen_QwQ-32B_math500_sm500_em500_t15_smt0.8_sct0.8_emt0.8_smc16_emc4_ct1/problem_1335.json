Each term is of the form \\( \\frac{k}{x^2 - k} \\). That reminds me of partial fractions or harmonic series.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps noticing that each term can be written as \\( \\frac{k}{(x - \\sqrt{k})(x + \\sqrt{k})} \\). But I'm not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps suppose that the left-hand side can be expressed as a function, and the right-hand side is a linear function in x. So, if I can find a function f(x) such that f(x) = left-hand side, and set it equal to 2010x -4, then maybe the solutions are the intersections of f(x) and the line 2010x -4.\n\nBut without knowing more about f(x), that might not be helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that for large x, the left-hand side behaves like 0 because each term is O(1/x^2). While the right-hand side is a linear function, so for large |x|, the equation would be approximately 2010x = 0, implying x=0, but that's not necessarily the case because x=0 isn't a solution here, since plugging x=0 into the left would lead to division by -1, etc., which is defined, but the right-hand side would be -4, so perhaps x=0 is a solution? Wait, let me check.\n\nIf x=0, the left side is 1/(-1) + 2/(-2) + 3/(-3) + 4/(-4) = (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -4. The right side is 2010*0 -4 = -4. So x=0 is a solution.

The denominators are the quadratics (x^2 -1), (x^2 -2), (x^2 -3), (x^2 -4), and the term -2010x +4 is a polynomial. So, the common denominator would be the product of all the denominators: (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4). \n\nTherefore, I can write the entire equation as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\cdot (x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 2 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4) + 3 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -4) + 4 \\cdot (x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)}{(x^2 -1)(x^2 -2)(x^2 -3)(x^2 -4)} - 2010x +4 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut this is going to be very complicated.
