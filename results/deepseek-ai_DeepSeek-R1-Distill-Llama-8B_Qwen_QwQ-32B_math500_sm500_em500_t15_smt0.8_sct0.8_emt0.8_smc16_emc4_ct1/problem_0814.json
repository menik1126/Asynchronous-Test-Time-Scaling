The polynomial is given as:\n\n$$f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$\n\nWith some specific information: the leading coefficient \\(a_n\\) is 2, the constant term \\(a_0\\) is 66, and all the coefficients are integers. Plus, the polynomial has distinct integer roots. The question is asking for the least possible value of \\(|a_{n-1}|\\).\n\nOkay, so first, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and distinct integer roots, it must be monic or have some integer scaling factor. But here, the leading coefficient \\(a_n\\) is 2, so it's not monic. Hmm, that means the polynomial can be written as:\n\n$$f(x) = 2(x - r_1)(x - r_2)\\cdots(x - r_n)$$\n\nwhere each \\(r_i\\) is an integer, and all the \\(r_i\\) are distinct.\n\nExpanding this, the constant term \\(a_0\\) is the product of the roots times \\((-1)^n \\times 2\\). Since \\(a_0 = 66\\), we have:\n\n$$2 \\times (-1)^n r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n = 66$$\n\nSo, simplifying that, we get:\n\n$$(-1)^n (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = \\frac{66}{2} = 33$$\n\nHence, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether \\(n\\) is even or odd. So, I need to find a set of distinct integers whose product is either 33 or -33, and then figure out the coefficients, especially \\(a_{n-1}\\), which relates to the sum of the roots.\n\nWait, actually, in the expansion of the polynomial, the coefficient \\(a_{n-1}\\) is equal to \\(-2(r_1 + r_2 + \\cdots + r_n)\\). So, to minimize \\(|a_{n-1}|\\), I need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Since each root is an"

Then, among all such possible sets of roots, find the one where their sum is minimized in absolute value.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 33 to see what integer roots we can have. The prime factors of 33 are 3 and 11. So, 33 can be broken down into 1, 3, 11, 33, and their negatives. So, the possible integer roots can be any combination of these factors, but they must multiply to 33 or -33.\n\nBut since the roots need to be distinct, we can't repeat any numbers. So, let's list all the possible sets of distinct integers that multiply to 33 or -33.\n\nStarting with positive roots, the factorizations are:\n\n1. 1, 1, 1, ..., 33. But since they must be distinct, the maximum number of terms would be limited. For example, 1, 3, 11, 33 is four distinct factors. Any more than that would require repeating a factor or introducing fractions, which aren't allowed here.\n\n2. Similarly, for negative roots, we can take -1, -3, -11, -33. But products here would be negative if the number of negative roots is odd, so it's important to track that.\n\nSo, let's look for the minimal set of distinct integers whose product is 33 or -33. Let's try to find the smallest possible number of roots, but I think since we have 2 as the leading coefficient, it's the number of roots. Wait, the polynomial's degree is \\(n\\), so if we have more roots, the degree is higher. But to minimize \\(|a_{n-1}|\\), maybe fewer roots could help, but actually, more roots can allow for cancellation in the sum.\n\nWait, but actually, the sum is the sum of all roots. So, if we can have positive and negative roots, we can have their sum being smaller. For example, having some positive and some negative roots would allow the total sum to be smaller, as they could cancel each other out.\n\nSo, let me think about this. Let's say we have both positive and negative roots such that their products result in 33 or -33"

Alternatively, if the product is -33, then there must be an odd number of negative roots.\n\nBut since the product is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n. Wait, actually, the equation was:\n\n$$(-1)^n (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 33$$\n\nWait, actually, let me re-examine that step. The original equation was:\n\nThe constant term \\(a_0 = 66 = 2 \\times (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n)\\). Therefore,\n\n\\( (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 33 \\).\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots times \\( (-1)^n \\) is 33. So, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on whether n is even or odd. Wait, actually, the product of the roots is \\( (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = 33 \\). Wait, no, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, the constant term is \\( a_0 = 2 \\times (-1)^n \\times (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) \\). So, rearranged, the product of the roots is \\( (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = \\frac{a_0}{2} \\times (-1)^n \\). Since \\(a_0 = 66\\), that gives:\n\n\\( (r_1 r_2 \\cdots r_n) = \\frac{66}{2} \\times (-1)^n = 33 \\times (-1)^n \\).\n\nTherefore, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n. So, if n is even, the product is 33; if n is odd, the product is -33.\n\nTherefore, the roots must multiply to either 33 or -33. So, the problem is to choose a set of distinct integers whose"
