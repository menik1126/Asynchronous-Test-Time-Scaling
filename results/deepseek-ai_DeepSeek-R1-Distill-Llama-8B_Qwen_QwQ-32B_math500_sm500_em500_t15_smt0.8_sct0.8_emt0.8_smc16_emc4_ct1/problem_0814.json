            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least possible value of |a_{n-1}| for a polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients and distinct integer roots. The polynomial is given in the form f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0. I know that a_n is 2 and a_0 is 66. I need to figure out what the smallest possible |a_{n-1}| can be.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a polynomial with integer coefficients and integer roots, the roots can be expressed as factors of a_0 divided by a_n. But wait, no, actually, the integer roots theorem says that any possible rational root, when written in lowest terms p/q, p must divide a_0 and q must divide a_n. Since our polynomial has integer coefficients, and a_n is 2, any rational root must be an integer because q can only be 1 or 2, but if q is 2, the root would have to be a half-integer. However, since all roots are integers, that means all possible roots are integers dividing 66. So the possible roots are the divisors of 66.\n\n66 has prime factors 2, 3, and 11, so the divisors are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±11, ±22, ±33, and ±66. Since the roots are distinct integers, we need to choose distinct divisors from this list.\n\nAlso, since a_n is 2, the leading coefficient, the polynomial can be written as f(x) = 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_k), where each r_i is an integer root, and all r_i are distinct.\n\nOur goal is to find such a polynomial where |a_{n-1}| is minimized. So, I think |a_{n-1}| is related to the sum of the roots and the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time. Wait, let me recall Vieta's formula.\n\nFor a monic polynomial, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is - (sum of roots). But our polynomial is not monic; it's leading coefficient is 2. So we need to adjust Vi"

Then expanding this, the coefficient of x^{n-1} would be 2*(- (r_1 + r_2 + ... + r_n)). Wait, actually, let me check:\n\nIf the polynomial is 2*(x - r_1)(x - r_2)...(x - r_n), then expanding the product (x - r_1)...(x - r_n) gives x^n - (sum r_i)x^{n-1} + ... + (-1)^n r_1...r_n. Then multiplying by 2 gives 2x^n - 2(sum r_i)x^{n-1} + ... + 2*(-1)^n r_1...r_n. Therefore, the coefficient a_{n-1} is -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, |a_{n-1}| = 2*|sum of roots|. Wait, so actually, the coefficient a_{n-1} is equal to -2*(sum of roots). Therefore, the absolute value is 2 times the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Therefore, to minimize |a_{n-1}|, we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the roots. Since the roots are integers, and their product (times 2) must be 66? Wait, no, the constant term a_0 is 66. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the constant term of the polynomial is 2*(-1)^n*(r_1 r_2 ... r_n). Since a_0 is 66, so 2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66. Therefore, the product of the roots times (-1)^n times 2 is 66. Therefore, the product of the roots is 66/(2*(-1)^n). Since the roots are integers, the product must be an integer, so 66 divided by 2 is 33, so the product of the roots is either 33 or -33, depending on the parity of n. Hmm, but actually, since (-1)^n can be either 1 or -1, so the product of the roots is 33 or -"

We know that's equal to 66. So:\n\n2*(-1)^n*(product of roots) = 66\n\nTherefore, (-1)^n*(product of roots) = 33\n\nWhich implies that (product of roots) = 33*(-1)^n\n\nSo the product of roots is either 33 or -33, depending on n being even or odd.\n\nBut how does this affect us? Well, not sure yet. Maybe it'll come into play later.\n\nSo, in any case, the product of the roots is either 33 or -33.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nr_1 * r_2 * ... * r_n = ±33\n\nAnd all roots are distinct integers.\n\nSo, the roots are distinct divisors of 33 (positive or negative). The divisors of 33 are ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33.\n\nWait, but in the earlier step, I thought the divisors of 66, but now I see it's 33. Wait, that's because the product is 33, so each root divides 33.\n\nHmm, actually, wait, because after factoring out 2, the product is 33 or -33, so the roots are the divisors of 33, hence ±1, ±3, ±11, ±33.\n\nSo we're to pick distinct integers from this set, whose product is 33 or -33, and find the set whose sum has the smallest absolute value. Because |a_{n-1}| is 2 times the absolute value of the sum of the roots. So our aim is to pick a subset of these divisors, all distinct, such that their product is either 33 or -33, and their sum has the smallest absolute value.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, since the product of the roots is 33 or -33, we can ignore the sign for now because we can just consider the absolute value of the sum.\n\nSo, if we take the absolute value, we can consider the product to be 33, and then figure out the sum.\n\nNow, 33 is a"

But the polynomial must have degree n, so the number of roots is n. Wait, but the problem says \"roots are distinct integers\", but it doesn't specify the degree. Wait, actually, the polynomial is given as a_n x^n + ... so the degree is n, so the number of roots is n, counting multiplicities, but since they are distinct, the degree is exactly the number of roots. So the number of roots is n, so the number of roots must be at least 1, but since the product is 33, which is a positive number, so the number of negative roots must be even.
