            "output": "I need to simplify the expression (10r^3)(4r^6) divided by 8r^4. First, I'll multiply the numerators together and the denominator together.\n\nSo, 10 times 4 is 40, and r^3 multiplied by r^6 is r^(3+6) = r^9. The denominator is 8 times r^4.\n\nNow, the expression is 40r^9 divided by 8r^4. Next, I'll simplify the numerical coefficients by dividing 40 by 8, which equals 5.\n\nThen, I'll subtract the exponents of the same variables in the denominator from those in the numerator. That means r^9 divided by r^4 is r^(9-4) = r^5.\n\nCombining these results, the simplified expression is 5r^5.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\frac{(10r^3)(4r^6)}{8r^4}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerators and the denominator:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{10r^3 \\times 4r^6}{8r^4} = \\frac{(10 \\times 4) \\times (r^3 \\times r^6)}{8r^4}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Perform the multiplication for the numerical coefficients and the variables:**\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{40r^{3+6}}{8r^4} = \\frac{40r^9}{8r^4}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Simplify the numerical coefficients by dividing 40 by 8:**\n   \\[\n   = 5r^9 / r^4\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Subtract the exponents of \\(r\\) in the denominator from those in the numerator:**\n   \\[\n   = 5r^{9-4} = 5r^5\n   \\]\n   \n5. **Write the final simplified expression:**\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{5r^5}\n   \\]"
