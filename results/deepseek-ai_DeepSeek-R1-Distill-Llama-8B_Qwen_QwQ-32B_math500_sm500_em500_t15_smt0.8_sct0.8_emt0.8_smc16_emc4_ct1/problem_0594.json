Hmm, let's try to visualize this first. The circle is centered at the origin with radius \\( \\sqrt{2} \\), and the parabola opens to the right with vertex at the origin. The Asymptote code provided draws the circle, the parabola, and some tangents, so I think this quadrilateral is a rectangle or something symmetric because of the way the tangents are drawn.\n\nFirst, I need to find the points where the circle and parabola touch each other, i.e., the points of tangency. Since both curves are symmetric about the x-axis, I expect the points of tangency to also be symmetric. So, if I can find two points, the other two should just be their reflections over the x-axis.\n\nTo find the points of tangency, I can try to solve the system of equations:\n\n1. \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\) (Equation of the circle)\n2. \\( y^2 = 8x \\) (Equation of the parabola)\n\nI can substitute \\( y^2 \\) from the second equation into the first one:\n\n\\( x^2 + 8x = 2 \\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\( x^2 + 8x - 2 = 0 \\)\n\nThat's a quadratic equation in terms of \\( x \\). Let me solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is \\( x^2 + 8x - 2 = 0 \\), so \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 8 \\), and \\( c = -2 \\).\n\nDiscriminant \\( D = b^2 - 4ac = 64 - 4(1)(-2) = 64 + 8 = 72 \\). \n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{ -8 \\pm \\sqrt{72} }{2} \\)\n\nSimplify \\( \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2} \\), so:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{ -8 \\pm 6\\sqrt{2} }{2 } = -4 \\pm"

Therefore, the solution \\( x = -4 - 3\\sqrt{2} \\) is negative, which isn't possible for the parabola. Thus, the only valid solution is \\( x = -4 + 3\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nCalculating \\( x = -4 + 3\\sqrt{2} \\). Let's approximate \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) as about 1.4142, so \\( 3\\sqrt{2} \\) is about 4.2426. Therefore, \\( x \\approx -4 + 4.2426 = 0.2426 \\). So, x is just a little positive, which makes sense.\n\nNow, let me find the corresponding \\( y \\) values. Using \\( y^2 = 8x \\), so \\( y^2 = 8(-4 + 3\\sqrt{2}) \\). Compute that:\n\nFirst, compute \\( 8(-4 + 3\\sqrt{2}) = -32 + 24\\sqrt{2} \\). Therefore, \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{-32 + 24\\sqrt{2}} \\).\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify \\( \\sqrt{-32 + 24\\sqrt{2}} \\). Maybe it's a perfect square. Suppose \\( \\sqrt{-32 + 24\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} \\).

But the problem says there are two common tangents, forming four points of tangency. Wait, maybe the points of tangency are not the intersection points but the points where the common tangent lines touch each curve?\n\nAh! That's probably the confusion here. The problem says \"forming four points of tangency\"\u2014so each common tangent touches the circle at one point and the parabola at another point. Since there are two common tangents, each tangent has two points of tangency (one on the circle and one on the parabola), so total four points. The quadrilateral is formed by these four points.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach was wrong because I was trying to find the intersection points of the curves, but actually, the points of tangency are on each curve where the common tangent touches them. So, I need to find the equations of the common tangents to both the circle and the parabola, then find their points of tangency on each curve, and then compute the area of the quadrilateral formed by those four points.\n\nOkay, so let's start over.\n\nFirst, find the equations of the common tangents to the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\) and the parabola \\( y^2 = 8x \\).\n\nA common tangent line must satisfy the condition that it is tangent to both curves. Let's denote the equation of the tangent line as \\( y = mx + c \\). However, since the parabola is symmetric about the x-axis, and the circle is symmetric about both axes, perhaps the common tangents are symmetric as well. Alternatively, maybe they have some other form.\n\nAlternatively, since the parabola is \\( y^2 = 8x \\), which is a right-opening parabola, and the circle is centered at the origin, the common tangents might be in the form of lines that touch both"

So, that's correct. The parabola at x=2, y\u00b2=16, but in the Asymptote code, the parabola is drawn as y\u00b2 = 8x, so at x=2, y\u00b2=16, so y=\u00b14. So, the points of tangency are at (2,4) and (2,-4), and on the circle at (-1,1) and (-1,-1). But wait, why are the points on the circle at (-1,1) and (-1,-1)?
