This will allow me to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation.\n\nOnce I have \\( x \\) isolated, I'll solve for it by dividing both sides by the original exponent of 2.\n\nFinally, I'll verify my solution by plugging the value of \\( x \\) back into the original equation to ensure it holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( 2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express both sides with the same base**:\n   \n   Notice that both 2 and 256 are powers of 2. The number 256 can be written as \\( 2^8 \\) because \\( 2^8 = 256 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the right side using exponent rules**:\n   \n   When raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents. Specifically, \\( (a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n} \\).\n\n   \\[\n   2^{2x} = 2^{8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the exponents equal to each other**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal.\n\n   \\[\n   2x = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\)**:\n   \n   Divide both sides by 2.\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   \n   Substitute \\( x = 2 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n\n   \\[\n   2^{2 \\cdot 2} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\\n   2^4 = \\sqrt{256} \\\\\n   16 = 16\n   \\]\n\n   The equation holds true, confirming that \\( x = 2 \\) is the correct solution.\n\n\\boxed{2}"
