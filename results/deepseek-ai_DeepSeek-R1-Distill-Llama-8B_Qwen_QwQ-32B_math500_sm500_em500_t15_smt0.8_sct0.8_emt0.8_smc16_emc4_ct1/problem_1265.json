            "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this equation: 2^{2x} equals 256 to the power of 1/2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with exponents, sometimes it helps to express both sides with the same base. That way, I can set the exponents equal to each other and solve for the variable. \n\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right: 2^{2x} = 256^{1/2}. Okay, that's correct. Now, I should try to express 256 as a power of 2 because the left side is already a power of 2. I recall that 2^8 is 256 because 2 multiplied by itself 8 times gives 256. So, I can rewrite 256 as 2^8.\n\nSo replacing 256 with 2^8 in the equation, it becomes 2^{2x} = (2^8)^{1/2}. Now, I need to simplify the right side. When you have an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply them. So, 8 times 1/2 is 4. Therefore, (2^8)^{1/2} simplifies to 2^4.\n\nNow the equation is 2^{2x} = 2^4. When two exponents with the same base are set equal to each other, their exponents must be equal. That means 2x must be equal to 4. So, I can set up the equation 2x = 4.\n\nTo solve for x, I just need to divide both sides by 2. So, x = 4 divided by 2, which is 2. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the beginning: 2^{2x} = 256^{1/2}. We expressed 256 as 2^8, so that becomes 2^{2x} = (2^8)^{1/2}, which is 2^{4}. Therefore, 2x = 4, so x = 2. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can plug the value back into the original equation to verify. Let's compute both sides when x = 2. On the left side, 2^{2*"

            "output": "2} is 2^4, which is 16. On the right side, 256^{1/2} is the square root of 256, which is also 16. Since both sides equal 16, x = 2 is indeed the correct solution.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes in the steps, and the check confirms the answer. So, the solution is x equals 2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^{2x} = 256^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\):\n\n1. Express 256 as a power of 2: \\(256 = 2^8\\).\n2. Rewrite the equation: \\(2^{2x} = (2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n3. Simplify the right side: \\((2^8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2^{8 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = 2^4\\).\n4. Now the equation is \\(2^{2x} = 2^4\\).\n5. Since the bases are equal, set the exponents equal: \\(2x = 4\\).\n6. Solve for \\(x\\): \\(x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{2}\\)"
