There are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, making a total of 11 members.\n\nSince the members are sitting around a circular table, the arrangement is considered the same if it can be rotated into another arrangement. This means that we can fix the position of one member to eliminate equivalent rotations.\n\nLet's fix the Independent's seat. This reduces the problem to arranging the remaining 10 members linearly around the table.\n\nNow, we have two groups to arrange: the 5 Democrats and the 5 Republicans. These groups must each sit together, as per the problem statement.\n\nIf we consider each party as a single block, there are 2 blocks to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these blocks is 2! (which is 2).\n\nNext, within each block, the members can be arranged among themselves. The Democrats can be arranged in 5! ways, and the Republicans can be arranged in 5! ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of seating arrangements is the product of the arrangements of the blocks and the internal arrangements within each block. This gives us 2! × 5! × 5!.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the number of ways the Senate committee can be seated around a circular table with the given conditions, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Members\nThe committee consists of:\n- **Democrats:** 5 members\n- **Republicans:** 5 members\n- **Independent:** 1 member\n\n**Total Members = 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 members**\n\n### Step 2: Account for Circular Arrangements\nSince the table is circular, arrangements that can be rotated into one another are considered identical. This means we can fix the position of one member to eliminate equivalent rotations. \n\n#### Fixing the Independent's Position\nLet's fix the **Independent** at a specific seat. This simplifies the problem because we no longer need to consider rotational symmetries.\n\n### Step 3: Arrange the Remaining Members\nNow, we need to arrange the remaining **10 members** (5 Democrats and 5 Republicans) around the table. However, the problem specifies that **all members of each party must sit next to each other**. This creates two distinct blocks:\n1. **Democratic Block:** 5 members\n2. **Republican Block:**"
