The superfactorial is defined as n\\$ = n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}} with n! in the exponent. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the superfactorial is. For a number n, the superfactorial is n factorial raised to the power of itself multiple times. So for 4, it's 4!^(4!^(4!^(4!))). That's a tower of exponents, each level being 4! So I need to compute this tower and find the units digit.\n\nBut calculating such a huge exponent directly isn't feasible. I remember that for units digits, modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 10, is really useful because the units digit of a number is the same as the number modulo 10.\n\nSo, my goal is to compute 4$$$ mod 10. Let's write that out:\n\n4\\$/10 = 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}} mod 10.\n\nI need to compute the exponent tower 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}} mod \u03c6(10), where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. Wait, \u03c6(10) is 4 because the numbers coprime to 10 below 10 are 1,3,7,9. So \u03c6(10)=4.\n\nBut Euler's theorem tells me that if a and n are coprime, then a^\u03c6(n) \u2261 1 mod n. However, 4! is 24, which is not coprime to 10 because 24 and 10 share factors 2. So I can't directly apply Euler's theorem here. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.\n\nMaybe I should compute the exponent modulo \u03c6(10) = 4, but since 24 and 10 aren't coprime, maybe I need a different approach. I recall that for exponents, if the base is not coprime to the modulus, we can still use Euler's theorem if the base and modulus are coprime. So perhaps I should consider breaking it down into smaller steps.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let"

Since mod 2 and mod 5, then combine them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see that the units digit cycles in powers modulo 10. Let's see, since the exponent is very large, but maybe the exponent tower reduces to a certain value modulo the totient. Let me first note the value of 4!.\n\nCalculating 4! first: 4 factorial is 4\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71 = 24. So 4$ is a tower of 24's, with the number of exponents being 24? Wait, hold on. The definition says the superfactorial n$ is equal to n! raised to the power of n! and so on, with the number of exponents being n!. So for n=4, the superfactorial is a tower of 24 exponents. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the problem says: \"n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}} }_{n!}\" So the tower has n! terms. So n! in the exponent, each level is n!.\n\nTherefore for 4$, which is 4$$$, the tower is 24^24^24^... with a total of 24 24's? That is, the first exponent is 24, and this continues for 24 layers. Wait, that's an enormous number.\n\nBut since we need to find the units digit mod 10, perhaps there's a pattern in the units digits of powers of 24.\n\nLet me consider the general approach for units digit of a^b where a has a units digit of d. The units digit of d^b cycles in cycles of 4 or 2 depending on d. So, for example, if the base modulo 10 is d, then the exponent modulo 4 might determine the units digit if d is 2,3,7,8. For digits 0,1,5,6 the units digit remains same regardless.\n\nBut here the base is 24, so the units digit of the base is 4. So 4's powers: 4^1="

If b is odd, units digit is 4; if even, 6.\n\nTherefore, to compute 4^b mod 10, only need to know if b is odd or even.\n\nSo, my next task is: compute b = 24^24^24^... with 24 exponents. So, the exponent is a tower of 24 24s. Let me denote E = 24^24^... with 24 exponents, so 4$$ = 4!^E = 24^E.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The superfactorial is n! ^ {n! ^ { ... }} with n! in the exponent. So for 4$, it's 24^{24^{...}} with 24 exponents. So E is 24^{24^{...}} with 24 exponents. But calculating E is difficult, but since we have to compute 24^E mod 2 and mod 5, and then use Chinese Remainder Theorem, maybe?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 24^E mod 10, which is the same as 24^E mod 2 and mod 5, then combine.\n\nBut 24 is even, so 24^E is even, and thus mod 2 is 0. But we need mod 10, so we need mod 5 as well. So let me compute 24^E mod 5.\n\n24 mod 5 is 4, so 24 \u2261 4 mod 5. So 4^E mod 5.\n\nNow, Euler's theorem: \u03c6(5)=4. So if E \u22651, then 4^E \u22614^{E mod 4} mod 5, but only if 4 and 5 are coprime, which they are. So yes, 4^E mod 5 = 4^{E mod 4} mod 5.\n\nBut I need to compute E mod 4.\n\nE is 24^{24^{"

So any power of 24 (except exponent 0) will be 0 mod4. So 24^anything \u22610 mod4, provided the exponent is at least 1. Since all exponents here are 24, which is \u22651, so the entire tower E is 24^{...} mod4 is 0.\n\nTherefore, E mod4 =0.\n\nTherefore, 4^E mod5 =4^{0 mod \u03c6(4)}? Wait, no. Wait, 4 and 5 are coprime, so Euler's theorem says 4^\u03c6(5)=4^4\u22611 mod5. So 4^E mod5 =4^{E mod4} mod5. Since E mod4=0, so 4^0 mod5=1 mod5. Wait, but 4^0 is 1, so yes. Wait, but 4^E mod5 is 4^{E mod4} mod5. Since E mod4 is 0, so 4^0=1 mod5. So 24^E mod5=1 mod5.\n\nTherefore, putting together mod2 and mod5:\n\n24^E mod2=0, and mod5=1. So we need a number congruent to 0 mod2 and 1 mod5. The numbers mod10 that satisfy this are 6 (since 6 mod2=0, 6 mod5=1). Therefore, 24^E mod10=6.

To find 24^E mod10, we split into mod2 and mod5.\n\nMod2: 24 is even, so 24^E mod2=0.\n\nMod5: 24 mod5=4, so 4^E mod5. Since \u03c6("

Therefore, 4^E mod5=1.\n\nSo 24^E mod5=1 and mod2=0. The number congruent to 0 mod2 and 1 mod5 is 6 mod10. So the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but 4 is the base, but in the problem statement, it's 4$, which is 24^E, so the logic above seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me cross-verify.

Let's compute.\n\n24^1:4, 24^2:6, 24^3:4, 24^4:6,... so cycle length 2. So 24^even exponent is 6, 24^odd is 4.\n\n24 is even exponent. So units digit is 6.

So the exponent is 24^24^24^... with 24 copies. So the exponent is a tower of 24 24s. So when calculating E mod4, since each exponent is 24, which is 0 mod4, so the entire tower is 0 mod4.
