            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem about the superfactorial of 4, written as 4$. The superfactorial is defined as this tower of factorials, right? It goes n! then on top of that, another n! factorial, and so on, n! times in total. So for 4$, it's 4! raised to the power of 4!, then that result raised to 4! again, and so on until there are four 4!s stacked.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what 4! is. 4 factorial is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which equals 24. So 4! = 24. That means each level of the superfactorial is 24. So 4$ is 24 raised to the power of 24, then that result raised to 24, and so on, four times in total.\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure. The definition says the superfactorial is a tower of n!s, n! times. So for n=4, it's 4! followed by three more 4!s. So 4$ is 24^24^24^24. Hmm, that seems enormous. Calculating this directly is impossible, but since we're only interested in the units digit, maybe we can find a pattern or use modular arithmetic to simplify.\n\nI remember that for units digits, especially for powers, Euler's theorem or cyclicity can help. Since 24 is even and ends with 4, its powers have a cycle. Let me first find the units digit of 24^k for different exponents k, and see if I can find a pattern or cycle.\n\nLet me compute the units digit for 24^1, 24^2, etc., and see:\n\n24^1 = 24 \u2192 units digit 4\n24^2 = 576 \u2192 units digit 6\n24^3 = 24 \u00d7 576 = let me see, 24 \u00d7 500 = 12,000, 24 \u00d7 76 = 1,824; adding up, 12,000 + 1,824 = 13,824 \u2192 units digit 4\n24^4 = 24 \u00d7 13,824 \u2192 again, the units digit would be 4 \u00d7 4 = 16, so units digit 6\n24^5 = 24 \u00d7"

So if the exponent is odd, units digit is 4; even exponent, units digit is 6. \n\nWait, that's a cycle of 2. So the key is to find whether the exponent on the last 24 is even or odd? But actually, the exponent here is a tower of 24s. Let's see:\n\nThe superfactorial 4$ is 24^(24^(24^24)). Because there's a tower of four 24s (since n! is 24 and there are n! = 24 terms? Wait, no, wait the original problem says the superfactorial is a tower of n! copies of n!.\n\nWait the problem says: \"n\\$ = underbrace{n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}}_{n!}\" So the number of exponents is n!.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"The superfactorial n\\$ is defined as n\\$ = underbrace{ n!^{n!^{cdot^{cdot^{cdot^{n!}}}}}_{n!} }\". The underbrace is supposed to indicate that the tower has n! terms. So for n=4, the tower has 24 terms? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the underbrace is indicating the number of exponents? Let me parse the notation again.\n\nThe LaTeX is written as \\underbrace{ n!^{{n!}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{{\\cdot}^{n!}}}}}}_{n!}. So the underbrace is below the tower, and the subscript is n!.\n\nHmm, so the tower has n! number of n! terms. So for n=4, the tower has 24 terms of 24. So 4$ is 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 copies of 24. Wait, that's a tower of 24 24s. That's way more than four"

Instead of four 24s, it's 24 24s. That's a huge number. Calculating this is impossible, but since we need the units digit, we can work modulo 10.\n\nSo, to find the units digit of 4$, which is 24^24^24^...^24 with 24 exponents, we can compute this tower modulo 10.\n\nFirst, note that 24 mod 10 is 4, so 24^k mod 10 is equivalent to 4^k mod 10.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the units digit of 4^24^24^...^24, with 24 exponents.\n\nSo 4$ mod 10 is equal to 4^(4^(4^...)) mod 10, with 24 exponents. Let me represent this as 4^(4^(4^...)) with 24 4s mod 10.\n\nBut wait, exponentiation modulo 10 cycles every certain number. Let's first figure out the pattern of 4^k mod 10.\n\nCompute 4^k mod 10 for k from 1 upwards:\n\nk=1: 4\nk=2: 16 \u2192 6\nk=3: 64 \u2192 4\nk=4: 256 \u2192 6\nk=5: 1024 \u2192 4\n... So the pattern is 4,6,4,6,... period 2.\n\nTherefore, 4^k mod 10 is 4 if k is odd, 6 if k is even.\n\nSo to compute 4^(something) mod 10, we just need to know whether the exponent is odd or even. If the exponent is odd, the result is 4; if even, 6.\n\nSo our main problem is: what is the exponent on 4? That is, the tower 4^(4^(4^...)) with 24 exponents, modulo 2. Because if we can find whether that exponent is odd or even, we can determine 4^(exponent) mod 10.\n\nSo let's denote E = 4^(4^("

Wait, but that would mean the exponent is even, so 4^E mod 10 would be 6?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the exponent is the tower starting from the top. Let me clarify the structure of the tower.\n\nThe original tower is 24^(24^(24^...^24)) with 24 terms. Since we're working mod 10, we first converted it to 4^(24^(24^...^24)) mod 10. Wait, but actually, the base is 24, so 24 mod 10 is 4, so the entire expression is 4^(tower) mod 10, where the tower is 24^(24^...^24) with 23 terms left. Wait, perhaps I need to be more precise.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nLet me denote the tower as follows:\n\nLet T(n) be the tower of n 24s. So T(1) = 24, T(2) = 24^24, T(3) = 24^(24^24), and so on up to T(24).\n\nThen 4$ = T(24). We need to find T(24) mod 10.\n\nFirst, T(24) = 24^T(23). So to compute T(24) mod 10, we can compute 24^T(23) mod 10. Since 24 mod 10 = 4, this is equivalent to 4^T(23) mod 10.\n\nAs before, since 4 has a cycle of 2 mod 10, we need to compute T(23) mod 2 to determine if the exponent is even or odd.\n\nWait, but 4^k mod 10 cycles every 2, so exponent"

Let's compute 24^T(22) mod 2.\n\nBut 24 mod 2 is 0, so any power of 24 mod 2 is 0. Therefore, T(23) mod 2 is 0.\n\nThus, T(23) is even, so T(24) mod10 = 4^(even) mod10 = 6.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. So according to this, the units digit is 6. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me double-check each step.\n\n1. 4$ is T(24) = 24^(24^(24^...)) with 24 exponents, which is enormous.\n\n2. To compute T(24) mod10, we note that 24 \u2261 4 mod10.\n\n3. Therefore, T(24) \u22614^(T(23)) mod10.\n\n4. Now, T(23) is 24^(24^(...)), so T(23)=24^(T(22)).\n\n5. Since 24 is even, 24^k for any k >=1 is even. So T(23) is even, i.e., T(23) \u22610 mod2.\n\n6. So T(24) \u22614^(even) mod10. Since 4^2=16\u22616, and 4^k cycles every 2, even exponents of 4 mod10=6.\n\nTherefore, T(24) mod10=6.\n\nSo the units digit is 6.\n\nWait, but hold on, is the structure of the tower correct?\n\nBecause the original tower has 24 exponents, which is even, each step is 24^(previous tower). So when we compute T(n), T(n) =24^(T(n-1)).\n\nWe need to compute T(24) mod10.\n\nBut in reality, when dealing with exponents, especially when the modulus is not prime, we can use Euler's theorem or look for cycles.

Wait, but in this case, since we're dealing with 4^k mod10, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the step where I considered T(23) mod2. Let me think again.\n\nWait, T(23) is 24^T(22). Since 24 is even, any exponentiation of 24 to any positive integer will be even. So T(23) is even, so T(23) mod2=0. Therefore, exponent is even, so 4^even mod10=6. So that seems okay.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller tower to see if the logic holds.\n\nSuppose we have a tower of 2 24s: T(2)=24^24. Then T(2) mod10 is 4^(24) mod10. Since 24 is even, 4^24 mod10=6. Which is correct, since 24^24 ends with 6.\n\nSimilarly, T(3)=24^(24^24). To compute mod10, it's 4^(T(2)) mod10. T(2)=24^24 is even, so exponent is even, so again 4^even mod10=6. So T(3) mod10=6.\n\nWait, so actually, for any tower of 24s with height >=2, the units digit is 6? Because the exponent is even, so 4^even is 6 mod10. So even if the tower is 24 levels high, it's still 6?\n\nWait, but let me see with a tower of 1: T(1)=24 mod10=4. So units digit 4. But for any tower of height >=2, it's 6?\n\nYes, because once you have 24^something, the exponent is at least 24, which is even, so the exponent is even, so 4^even is 6 mod10. Then, for the next level, the exponent is 24^(previous), which is even again, so the result is still 6. So regardless of how tall the tower is (as long"

So for n=4, that's 24 24s, so the height is 24, which is more than 2, so units digit should be 6.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the final answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the units digit of \\(4\\$\\), we analyze the superfactorial structure and modular arithmetic properties.\n\n1. **Understanding the Superfactorial**: The superfactorial \\(4\\$\\) is a power tower of 24s, 24 levels high.

Here, the exponent itself is a tower of 24s, so we need to check if this tower's exponent is even.\n\n5. **Evenness of the Exponent**: Any tower of 24s (with height \u22652) results in an even exponent.
