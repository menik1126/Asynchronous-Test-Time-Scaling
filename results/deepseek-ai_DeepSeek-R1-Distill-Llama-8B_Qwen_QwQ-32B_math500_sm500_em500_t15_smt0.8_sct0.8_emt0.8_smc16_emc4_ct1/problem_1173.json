The problem says that the solutions form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and we need to find its area expressed in a specific form. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, complex equations like this often have solutions that are roots of some polynomial. Maybe I can factor this equation to find the roots. Let me see if I can factor it somehow. The equation is a quartic (degree 4), so factoring might be tricky, but perhaps there's a pattern or substitution that can help.\n\nLooking at the coefficients, I notice that they might follow a particular sequence. Let's write down the equation again:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 -6 z^2 -4i z -i = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, the coefficients are 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. The pattern seems a bit like a geometric progression, but with some signs. Maybe it's related to expanding a binomial. Let me think about the binomial theorem. For example, \\( (z + a)^4 \\) would expand to \\( z^4 + 4a z^3 + 6a^2 z^2 + 4a^3 z + a^4 \\). Comparing that with our equation, maybe our polynomial is similar but with complex numbers involved.\n\nWait, the coefficients have signs alternating in some way. Let me check:\n\n- The coefficient of \\( z^4 \\) is 1 (same as \\( (z + a)^4 \\))\n- \\( 4i \\) for \\( z^3 \\) vs. \\( 4a \\)\n- \\( -6 \\) for \\( z^2 \\) vs. \\( 6a^2 \\)\n- \\( -4i \\) for \\( z \\) vs. \\( 4a^3 \\)\n- \\( -i \\) for the constant term vs. \\( a^4 \\)\n\nHmm, so if I suppose that our polynomial is \\( (z + a)^4 \\), but with some modifications.

The constant term is supposed to be -i, but (i)^4 is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAh, so there's a problem with the constant term. So maybe it's not exactly (z + i)^4, but perhaps there's a sign or another factor. Let me check the constant term again. The equation has -i, whereas if a = i, then a^4 = 1.

Let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose I take one of the roots. Let me compute one of the roots numerically and see.\n\nLet me compute (1 +i)^{1/4}. Let me compute 1 +i in polar form: modulus sqrt(2), angle \u03c0/4. So, the fourth roots will have modulus (sqrt(2))^{1/4}=2^{1/8}, and angles (\u03c0/4 +2\u03c0k)/4 for k=0,1,2,3.\n\nSo, for k=0: angle \u03c0/16, modulus 2^{1/8}\n\nk=1: angle (\u03c0/4 +2\u03c0)/4 = (\u03c0"

So, the square is not centered at the origin, but at (-1, 0) in the complex plane.\n\nTherefore, the area in the w-plane can be calculated, but since the transformation to z =i w is just a rotation and scaling, the area is preserved, so the area in the z-plane is the same as in the w-plane.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the coordinates of the square in the w-plane and then compute the area.\n\nIn the w-plane, the four vertices are:\n\nw0 = -1 + 2^{1/8} e^{i\u03c0/16}\n\nw1"

The distance from the center to each vertex is 2^{1/8}.\n\nThus, the square is inscribed in a circle of radius 2^{1/8} centered at (-1,0). Therefore, the side length s of this square is s = 2 * 2^{1/8} * sin(\u03c0/4) = 2^{9/8} * (\u221a2/2) )= 2^{9/8} * 2^{-1/2} = 2^{5/8}.\n\nWait, that seems correct because side length s = 2*r*sin(\u03c0/4) where r is the distance from center to vertex.\n\nSo, r =2^{1/8}, so s=2*2^{1/8}*\u221a2/2=2^{1/8} *\u221a2=2^{5/8}\n\nTherefore, the area is s\u00b2= (2^{5/8})\u00b2=2^{5/4}\n\nThus, the area in the w-plane is 2^{5/4}, so since area is preserved under rotation and scaling (as z =i w is a rotation by \u03c0/2 and modulus 1), the area in the z-plane is the same.\n\nTherefore, the area is indeed 2^{5/4}, which is 2^{1 +1/4}=2*2^{1/4}. So, expressed as p^{a/b} with p=2, a=5, b=4.\n\nThus, a + b +p=5 +4 +2=11.\n\nHence, the answer is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>\n\nThe given equation is \\( z^4 + 4z^3i - 6z^2 - 4zi - i = 0 \\). We need to find the area of the convex polygon formed by its solutions in the complex plane.\n\nFirst, we factor and simplify the equation by substituting \\( z = iw \\), leading to the transformed equation:\n\n\\[ w"
