The solutions to this equation form the vertices of a convex polygon in the complex plane, and I need to find the area of that polygon. The area is supposed to be expressible in the form \\( p^{a/b} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime, and then find \\( a + b + p \\). Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the equation. It's a quartic equation in \\( z \\), which means it should have four solutions in the complex plane. These four solutions are the vertices of a convex polygon, so probably a quadrilateral. Interesting.\n\nLooking at the equation, I notice that the coefficients have a pattern: the coefficients of \\( z^4 \\) is 1, \\( z^3 \\) is \\( 4i \\), \\( z^2 \\) is -6, \\( z \\) is -4i, and the constant term is -i. Maybe this polynomial can be factored in a clever way. It reminds me of a binomial expansion because of the coefficients 1, 4i, -6, -4i, -i. Hmm, that makes me think of \\( (z + i)^4 \\). Let me check:\n\nIf I expand \\( (z + i)^4 \\), using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\( (z + i)^4 = z^4 + 4i z^3 + 6 z^2 + 4i z + i^2 \\).\n\nWait, but comparing that to our equation:\n\n\\( z^4 + 4i z^3 - 6 z^2 -4i z -i \\).\n\nHmm, the coefficients up to \\( z^2 \\) don't match in the sign. The expansion has +6 for \\( z^2 \\) and we have -6 in the equation. Similarly, in \\( (z + i)^4 \\), the coefficient for \\( z \\) is +4i, but in the equation, it's -4i. Also, the constant term is \\( i^2 = -1 \\) in the expansion, but our equation has -i instead. So they’re not the same.\n\nBut maybe this equation is a"

Let me try to see if there's a rational root first, but since it's a complex polynomial, rational roots might be a stretch, but perhaps.\n\nUsing the rational root theorem, possible roots are factors of the constant term over factors of the leading coefficient.
