            "output": "First, I need to identify the prices of the stamps from the 70s. Looking at the Asymptote figure provided, under the \"70s\" row, the prices are 12, 12, 6, and 13 cents for Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain respectively.\n\nNext, I'll count how many stamps there are in the 70s category. There are four stamps with the following prices: 12, 12, 6, and 13 cents.\n\nTo find the average price, I'll sum all the prices and divide by the number of stamps. So, adding them up: 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 equals 43 cents.\n\nFinally, I'll divide the total by the number of stamps, which is 4. This gives 43 divided by 4, resulting in 10.75 cents. Rounding this to the nearest tenth of a cent, the average price is 10.8 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70's** stamps, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices of 70's Stamps:**\n   - **Brazil:** 12 cents\n   - **France:** 12 cents\n   - **Peru:** 6 cents\n   - **Spain:** 13 cents\n\n2. **Count the Number of 70's Stamps:**\n   - There are **4** stamps from the 70's.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Price of 70's Stamps:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Price} = 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Average Price:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Price} = \\frac{\\text{Total Price}}{\\text{Number of Stamps}} = \\frac{43}{4} = 10.75 \\text{ cents}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round to the Nearest Tenth of a Cent:**\n   \\[\n   10.75 \\text{ cents} \\approx \\boxed{10.8} \\text{ cents}\n   \\]"

The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
