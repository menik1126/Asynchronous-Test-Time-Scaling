From the chart, there are:\n- 12 Brazil stamps\n- 12 France stamps\n- 12 Peru stamps\n- 6 Spain stamps\n\nAdding these together gives a total of 42 stamps from the 70s.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the total cost of these stamps by multiplying the number of stamps by their respective prices:\n- Brazil: 12 stamps \u00d7 12 cents = 144 cents\n- France: 12 stamps \u00d7 12 cents = 144 cents\n- Peru: 12 stamps \u00d7 12 cents = 144 cents\n- Spain: 6 stamps \u00d7 6 cents = 36 cents\n\nSumming these amounts:\n144 + 144 + 144 + 36 = 468 cents\n\nFinally, to find the average price per 70s stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the total number of 70s stamps:\n468 cents \u00f7 42 = 11.14 cents\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth of a cent, the average price of Juan's 70s stamps is 11.1 cents.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the average price of Juan's **70s** stamps, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Prices and Countries:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\$12 each\n   - **France:** \\$12 each\n   - **Peru:** \\$12 each\n   - **Spain:** \\$6 each\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Stamps in the 70s:**\n   - From the chart, the number of 70s stamps for each country is:\n     - Brazil: **12** stamps\n     - France: **12** stamps\n     - Peru: **12** stamps\n     - Spain: **6** stamps\n   - **Total 70s stamps:** \\(12 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 42\\) stamps\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Cost of 70s Stamps:**\n   - **Brazil:** \\(12 \\text{ stamps"

    "question": "$\\textbf{Juan's Old Stamping Grounds}$\n\nJuan organizes the stamps in his collection by country and by the decade in which they were issued. The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France, $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each.
