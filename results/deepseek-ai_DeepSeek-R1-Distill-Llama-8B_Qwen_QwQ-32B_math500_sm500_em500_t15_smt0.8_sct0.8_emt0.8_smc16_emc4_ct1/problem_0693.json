Let me try to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in a triangle, the sides are related to the angles opposite them by the Law of Cosines. The formula is \\(a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A\\). Maybe that will come in handy here. So, perhaps I should express the given area in terms of sides b and c and the angle A.\n\nThe area of a triangle can also be expressed using the formula \\(\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A\\). So, the problem states that this area is equal to \\(a^2 - (b - c)^2\\). That gives me the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = a^2 - (b - c)^2\n\\]\n\nAlright, so if I can expand the right-hand side and maybe substitute \\(a^2\\) from the Law of Cosines, I can solve for \\(\\tan A\\). Let's try expanding \\(a^2 - (b - c)^2\\). That would be:\n\n\\[\na^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\n\nNow, let's replace \\(a^2\\) with the expression from the Law of Cosines. From earlier, \\(a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A\\). Plugging that in:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\n\nLet me simplify the right-hand side step by step. Expanding it:\n\n\\[\n(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\n\nThe \\("

So, that leaves:\n\n\\[\n-2bc \\cos A + 2bc\n\\]\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n\\[\n2bc(1 - \\cos A)\n\\]\n\nSo, putting it back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = 2bc(1 - \\cos A)\n\\]\n\nLet me simplify this equation. First, I notice that both sides have a factor of \\(bc\\). Assuming \\(bc \\neq 0\\) (which they can't be in a triangle), I can divide both sides by \\(bc\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sin A = 2(1 - \\cos A)\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = 4(1 - \\cos A)\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay, so I have \\(\\sin A = 4(1 - \\cos A)\\). I need to find \\(\\tan A\\), which is \\(\\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A}\\). So, maybe I can express everything in terms of \\(\\cos A\\) and then solve for it.\n\nLet me write \\(\\sin A\\) as \\(4(1 - \\cos A)\\). Then, I can square both sides to use the Pythagorean identity \\(\\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1\\). But before I do that, maybe I should consider expressing \\(\\sin A\\) in terms of \\(\\cos A\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = 4 - 4 \\cos A\n\\]\n\nSo, squaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 A = (4 - 4 \\cos A)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin^2 A = 16 - 32 \\cos A + 16 \\cos^2 A\n\\]\n\nNow, using the Pythagorean identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 A = 1 - \\cos^2 A\n\\]\n\nSo, substitute that in:\n\n\\[\n1 - \\cos^2 A = 16 - 32 \\cos A + 16 \\cos^2 A\n\\]\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\n\\"

Let me denote \\(x = \\cos A\\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n17x^2 - 32x + 15 = 0\n\\]\n\nTo solve for x, I can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{32 \\pm \\sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 15}}{2 \\cdot 17}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{32 \\pm \\sqrt{1024 - 1020}}{34}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{32 \\pm \\sqrt{4}}{34}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{32 \\pm 2}{34}\n\\]\n\nSo, the two solutions are:\n\n1. \\(x = \\frac{32 + 2}{34} = \\frac{34}{34} = 1\\)\n2. \\(x = \\frac{32 - 2}{34} = \\frac{30}{34} = \\frac{15}{17}\\)\n\nNow, let's consider \\(\\cos A = 1\\). If \\(\\cos A = 1\\), then angle A is 0\u00b0, which isn't possible in a triangle. So, this solution is extraneous. Therefore, we must have \\(\\cos A = \\frac{15}{17}\\).\n\nNow, since \\(\\cos A = \\frac{15}{17}\\), we can find \\(\\sin A\\) using the Pythagorean identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 A} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{15}{17}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{225}{289}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{64}{289}} = \\frac{8}{17}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(\\tan A = \\frac{\\sin A}{\\cos A} = \\frac"

Starting from the area expression and substituting everything correctly. Hmm, yeah, that seems right. Squaring both sides, substituting, and solving the quadratic gave me valid solutions, but the first one was impossible. So, the second one must be the correct value.\n\nSo, \\(\\tan A = \\frac{8}{15}\\).
