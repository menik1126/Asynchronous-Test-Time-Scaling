            "output": "Okay, so I have this problem where the area of triangle ABC is given as \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). I need to find \\( \\tan A \\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a triangle can be calculated using different formulas. The most common one is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\), but I also recall that another formula involving the sine of an angle is \\( \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are two sides and \\( C \\) is the included angle. Maybe that will come in handy here since the problem is asking about \\( \\tan A \\), which is related to the angles of the triangle.\n\nSo, let's denote the triangle ABC with sides \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) opposite angles \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) respectively. The area of the triangle is given as \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\). Let me compute that expression first to see if I can relate it to the standard area formula.\n\nExpanding \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\):\n\\[\na^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2\n\\]\nHmm, that doesn't immediately look like the standard area formula. Maybe I should express the area in terms of sides and the sine of angle A. The area is \\( \\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A \\). So, setting that equal to the given expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}bc\\sin A = a^2 - (b - c)^2\n\\]\nLet me compute \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\) more carefully. Wait, expanding \\( (b - c)^2 \\) gives \\( b^2 - 2bc + c^2 \\), so \\( a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \\), which is what I had earlier.\n\nHmm, maybe I can express \\( a^2 \\) using the Law of Cos"
