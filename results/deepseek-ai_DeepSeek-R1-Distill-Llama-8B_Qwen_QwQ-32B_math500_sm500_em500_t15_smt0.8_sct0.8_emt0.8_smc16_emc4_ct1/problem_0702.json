            "output": "Okay, so I've got this problem about triangle ABC. It says that the area of the triangle is equal to \\( a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\), and I need to find \\( \\tan A \\).\n\nFirst, I should recall the formula for the area of a triangle. There are a few ways to express it. The most common one is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\), but that might not be directly helpful here. Another formula is Heron's formula, which uses the lengths of all three sides. But that also seems complicated because it requires knowing all sides and computing the semi-perimeter. Maybe there's another formula that relates the area to two sides and the sine of the included angle.\n\nOh right, the area can also be expressed as \\( \\frac{1}{2}ab \\sin C \\), where a and b are two sides, and C is the angle between them. In this case, angle A is opposite side a, so maybe I can express the area in terms of sides b and c and angle A.\n\nLet me write down what's given:\n\nArea \\( = a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\).\n\nAnd the area is also equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A \\). So I can set these equal to each other:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = a^2 - (b - c)^2 \\).\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\( a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \\).\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \\).\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can express \\( a^2 \\) in terms of \\( b^2 \\) and \\( c^2 \\) using the Law of Cosines. Law of Cosines says \\( a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A \\).\n\nLet me substitute that into the equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A) - b^2 + 2"

            "output": "bc - c^2 \\).\n\nSimplifying the right side:\n\nFirst, \\( b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 \\).\n\nThe \\( b^2 \\) and \\( -b^2 \\) cancel out, same with \\( c^2 \\) and \\( -c^2 \\).\n\nSo we have:\n\n\\( -2bc \\cos A + 2bc \\).\n\nFactor out 2bc:\n\n\\( 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\).\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2}bc \\sin A = 2bc(1 - \\cos A) \\).\n\nI can divide both sides by \\( bc \\) since those aren't zero (they are sides of a triangle):\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\sin A = 2(1 - \\cos A) \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n\\( \\sin A = 4(1 - \\cos A) \\).\n\nNow, let's rewrite this equation. Let me bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( \\sin A + 4 \\cos A - 4 = 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\sin A + 4 \\cos A = 4 \\).\n\nHmm, this equation involves both sine and cosine of the same angle. Maybe I can express this as a single trigonometric function. I remember that an expression of the form \\( R \\sin(A + \\phi) = K \\) can be used, where \\( R \\) and \\( \\phi \\) are determined by the coefficients of sine and cosine.\n\nAlternatively, I can square both sides to use the Pythagorean identity, but I have to be cautious because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nLet me try that. So let's square both sides:\n\n\\( (\\sin A + 4 \\cos A)^2 = 16 \\).\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n\\( \\sin^2 A + 8 \\sin A \\cos A + 16 \\cos^2 A = 16 \\).\n\nI know that \\( \\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1 \\), so substitute that:\n\n\\( 1 + 8 \\sin A \\cos A + 15 \\cos^2 A = 16 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 8 \\sin A \\cos A + 15"

Let me go back to the equation:\n\n\\( \\sin A = 4(1 - \\cos A) \\).\n\nI can let\u2019s solve for \\( \\sin A \\) in terms of \\( \\cos A \\) and then use the identity \\( \\sin^2 A + \\cos^2 A = 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\sin A = 4 - 4 \\cos A \\).\n\nNow, square both sides:\n\n\\( \\sin^2 A = (4 - 4 \\cos A)^2 \\).\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\( \\sin^2 A = 16 - 32 \\cos A + 16 \\cos^2 A \\).\n\nBut since \\( \\sin^2 A = 1 - \\cos^2 A \\), substituting:\n\n\\( 1 - \\cos^2 A = 16 - 32 \\cos A + 16 \\cos^2 A \\).\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( 1 - \\cos^2 A - 16 + 32 \\cos A - 16 \\cos^2 A = 0 \\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( -17 \\cos^2 A + 32 \\cos A - 15 = 0 \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make the quadratic coefficient positive:\n\n\\( 17 \\cos^2 A - 32 \\cos A + 15 = 0 \\).\n\nNow, this is a quadratic in terms of \\( \\cos A \\). Let me set \\( x = \\cos A \\):\n\n\\( 17x^2 - 32x + 15 = 0 \\).\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{32 \\pm \\sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4 \\times 17 \\times 15}}{2 \\times 17} \\).\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n\\( 32^2 = 1024 \\).\n\\( 4 \\times 17 \\times 15 = 1020 \\).\nSo discriminant is \\( 1024 - 1020 = 4 \\).\n\nThus, solutions are:\n\n\\( x = \\frac{32 \\pm 2}{34} \\).\n\nCompute both possibilities:\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{32 + 2}{34} = \\frac{34}{34} = "
