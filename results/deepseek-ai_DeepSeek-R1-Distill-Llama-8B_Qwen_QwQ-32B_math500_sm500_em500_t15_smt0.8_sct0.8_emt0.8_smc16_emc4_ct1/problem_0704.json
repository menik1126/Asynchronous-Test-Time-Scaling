            "output": "To determine the number of y-intercepts of the parabola defined by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), I'll follow these steps:\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a y-intercept is. A y-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the y-axis, which is at \\( x = 0 \\). So, I'll set \\( x = 0 \\) in the equation and solve for \\( y \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation gives:\n\\[ 0 = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( y \\):\n\\[ y^2 - 4y - 1 = 0 \\]\n\nNext, I'll use the quadratic formula to find the values of \\( y \\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 4}}{2} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\n\\[ y = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{5} \\]\n\nSince both values of \\( y \\) are real numbers, the graph of the parabola crosses the y-axis at two distinct points. Therefore, the equation has two y-intercepts.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the graph of the parabola \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\) has \\boxed{2} y-intercepts.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of y-intercepts of the parabola defined by the equation \\( x = y^2 - 4y - 1 \\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the y-intercept:** A y-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the y-axis. At this point, the value of \\( x \\) is 0.\n\n2. **Set \\( x \\) to 0 in the equation:**\n   \\[\n   0 = y^2 - 4y - 1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation for \\( y \\):**\n   Use the quadratic formula \\( y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b"
