The fewest numbers would minimize the sum.\n\nConsidering different combinations:\n- 3 integers: 2, 3, and 14. Their product is 84, and their sum is 2 + 3 + 14 = 19.\n- 4 integers: 2, 2, 3, and 7. However, the integers must be distinct, so having two 2s is not allowed. Therefore, the next best is 2, 3, 7, and a new number. But since 2 × 3 × 7 = 42, we need another number to reach 84, which complicates the sum.\n\nAfter evaluating, the combination with the smallest sum is 2, 3, and 14, resulting in a total sum of 19.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the least possible sum of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 84**:\n   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify the Smallest Number of Integers**:\n   - We aim to find the smallest number of integers since fewer integers generally result in a smaller sum.\n   - **Option 1**: Use three integers.\n     - The factors are 2, 3, and 14 (since \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 14 = 84\\)).\n     - **Sum**: \\(2 + 3 + 14 = 19\\).\n   - **Option 2**: Use four integers.\n     - This would require distributing the prime factors into four distinct integers, such as 2, 3, 7, and another number. However, 2, 3, and 7 are already used, making it difficult to find a distinct fourth integer without increasing the sum significantly.\n   \n3. **Compare the Options**:\n   - Among the options, the combination with the smallest sum is **2, 3, and 14**, resulting in"
