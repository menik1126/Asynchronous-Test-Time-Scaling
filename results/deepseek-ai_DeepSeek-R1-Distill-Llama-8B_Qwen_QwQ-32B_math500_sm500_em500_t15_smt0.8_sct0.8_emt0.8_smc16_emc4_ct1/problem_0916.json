Next, I'll divide 21 by 3 to obtain 7, and finally by 7 to reach 1. So, the prime factors of 84 are 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7.\n\nNow, I'll list all the possible sets of distinct positive integers that multiply to 84 by considering the prime factors and their combinations.\n\nOne possible set is {2, 3, 7, 1}, but since we're looking for the least sum, including 1 isn't beneficial because it doesn't contribute to the product but increases the sum.\n\nAnother valid set is {3, 4, 7}, which multiplies to 84 and has a sum of 14.\n\nComparing the sums, 14 from the set {3, 4, 7} is smaller than the previous sum of 15 from the set {2, 3, 7, 1}. Therefore, the least possible sum of these integers is 14.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the least possible sum of a set of distinct positive integers whose product is 84, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factorize 84 into its prime components:**\n   \n   \\[\n   84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **List possible sets of distinct positive integers that multiply to 84:**\n   \n   - **Set 1:** \\( \\{2, 3, 7, 1\\} \\)\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 1 = 84\n     \\]\n     **Sum:** \\( 2 + 3 + 7 + 1 = 13 \\)\n\n   - **Set 2:** \\( \\{3, 4, 7\\} \\)\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 4 \\times 7 = 84\n     \\]\n     **Sum:** \\( 3 + 4 + 7 = 14 \\)\n\n3. **Determine the set with the smallest sum:**\n   \n   Between the two sets, the one with integers \\( \\{3"
