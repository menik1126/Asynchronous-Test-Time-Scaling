            "output": "First, I need to convert the decimal number 999 into base six. To do this, I'll divide 999 by 6 and record the quotient and remainder.\n\nDividing 999 by 6 gives a quotient of 166 and a remainder of 3. This means that the least significant digit in base six is 3.\n\nNext, I'll take the quotient 166 and divide it by 6. This results in a quotient of 27 with a remainder of 2. So, the next digit in base six is 2.\n\nContinuing this process, I divide 27 by 6, which gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3. Therefore, the next digit is 3.\n\nThen, I divide the new quotient, 4, by 6. This time, the quotient is 0 with a remainder of 4. Hence, the remaining digit is 4.\n\nSince the quotient is now 0, the division process stops. I'll now write the remainders in reverse order to get the base six number. Starting from the last remainder, the remainders are 4, 3, 2, and 3. Therefore, the base six equivalent of 999 in decimal is 4323_6.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the decimal number \\( 999_{10} \\) to its base six equivalent, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Divide 999 by 6**:\n   \\[\n   999 \\div 6 = 166 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   This means:\n   \\[\n   999 = 6 \\times 166 + 3\n   \\]\n   The first digit (rightmost) in base six is 3.\n\n2. **Divide the quotient 166 by 6**:\n   \\[\n   166 \\div 6 = 27 \\text{ with a remainder of } 2\n   \\]\n   So:\n   \\[\n   166 = 6 \\times 27 + 2\n   \\]\n   The next digit is 2.\n\n3. **Divide 27 by 6**:\n   \\[\n   27 \\div 6 = 4 \\text{ with a remainder of } 3\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   27 = 6 \\times 4 + 3\n   \\]\n   The next digit is "
