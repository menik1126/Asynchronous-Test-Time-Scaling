Half of (3x - 9) equals x + 37.\n\nHalf of (3x - 9) can be expressed as (1/2)(3x - 9).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n(1/2)(3x - 9) = x + 37.\n\nNext, I'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term in the equation by 2.\n\nMultiplying each term by 2 gives:\n2*(1/2)(3x - 9) = 2x + 74.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n3x - 9 = 2x + 74.\n\nNow, I'll isolate the variable x by subtracting 2x from both sides:\n3x - 2x - 9 = 74.\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx - 9 = 74.\n\nFinally, I'll add 9 to both sides to solve for x:\nx = 83.\n</think>\n\n**Question:** Half the value of \\(3x - 9\\) is \\(x + 37\\). What is the value of \\(x\\)?\n\nLet's solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Write the equation as a mathematical expression:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n   \\]\n\n2. **Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:**\n   \n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2(x + 37)\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n\n3. **Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to isolate the variable \\(x\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n\n4. **Add 9 to both sides to solve for \\(x\\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = 74 + 9\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   x = 83\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{83}\\)"
