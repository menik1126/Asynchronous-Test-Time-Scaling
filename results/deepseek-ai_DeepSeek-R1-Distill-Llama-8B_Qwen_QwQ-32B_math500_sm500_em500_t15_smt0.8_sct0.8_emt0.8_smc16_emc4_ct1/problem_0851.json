So, \\( Y = 3x - 9 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, half of \\( Y \\) is \\( x + 37 \\). Therefore, \\( \\frac{Y}{2} = x + 37 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( Y \\) with \\( 3x - 9 \\) in the equation gives \\( \\frac{3x - 9}{2} = x + 37 \\).\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2. This results in \\( 3x - 9 = 2x + 74 \\).\n\nNext, I'll subtract \\( 2x \\) from both sides to get \\( x - 9 = 74 \\).\n\nThen, I'll add 9 to both sides to solve for \\( x \\), which gives \\( x = 83 \\).\n\nFinally, I'll check the solution by substituting \\( x = 83 \\) back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = x + 37\n\\]\nLet's solve for \\( x \\) step by step.\n\n1. **Multiply both sides by 2** to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\frac{1}{2}(3x - 9) = 2 \\times (x + 37)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3x - 9 = 2x + 74\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract \\( 2x \\)** from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3x - 2x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x - 9 = 74\n   \\]\n\n3. **Add 9** to both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 74 + 9\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 83\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{83}\n\\]"
