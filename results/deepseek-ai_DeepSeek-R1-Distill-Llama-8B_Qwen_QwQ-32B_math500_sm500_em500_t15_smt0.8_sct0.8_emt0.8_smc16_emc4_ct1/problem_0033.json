Yes, since it's an even number.\nSo, 284 divided by 2 equals 142.\n\nNext, I'll factorize 142. Dividing by 2 again gives 71.\nFinally, I check if 71 is a prime number. It doesn't have any divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is prime.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 284 is 2 squared multiplied by 71, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 71\u00b9.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of proper divisors, which is (p\u207f\u207b\u00b9 - 1) / (p - 1) for each prime factor p raised to the power n, I'll calculate the sum for each factor.\n\nFor the prime factor 2:\n(2\u00b2 - 1) / (2 - 1) = (4 - 1) / 1 = 3.\n\nFor the prime factor 71:\n(71\u00b9 - 1) / (71 - 1) = (71 - 1) / 70 = 70/70 = 1.\n\nAdding these together, the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nNow, I'll find the sum of the proper divisors of the sum, which is 4.\n\nThe proper divisors of 4 are 1 and 2.\n\nAdding these, the sum of the proper divisors of 4 is 1 + 2 = 3.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the proper divisors of 284.**\n\n   - **Prime Factorization of 284:**\n     - 284 is even, so it's divisible by 2.\n     - \\( 284 \u00f7 2 = 142 \\)\n     - 142 is also even, so it's divisible by 2.\n     - \\( 142 \u00f7 2 = 71 \\)\n     - 71 is a prime number.\n\n   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 284 is \\( 2^2 \u00d7 71^1 \\).\n\n   - **Sum of Proper Divisors:**\n     - The formula for the sum of proper divisors of a number \\( N = p"
