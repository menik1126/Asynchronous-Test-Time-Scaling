So, 284 = 2² × 71¹.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the sum of the proper divisors using the formula for the sum of divisors function, σ(n), which is (2² + 1)(71¹ + 1) = 3 × 72 = 216.\n\nFinally, I'll find the sum of the proper divisors of 216. Dividing 216 into its prime factors, it's equal to 2³ × 3³. Applying the sum of divisors formula again, σ(216) = (2³ + 1)(3³ + 1) = 9 × 28 = 252.\n\nThus, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 252.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the Proper Divisors of 284**\n2. **Sum the Proper Divisors of 284**\n3. **Find the Proper Divisors of the Sum from Step 2**\n4. **Sum the Proper Divisors from Step 3**\n\nLet's go through each step in detail.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Find the Proper Divisors of 284\n\nA proper divisor of a number is a positive integer that divides the number evenly without leaving a remainder, excluding the number itself.\n\n**284** is an even number, so it's divisible by 2:\n\\[ 284 \\div 2 = 142 \\]\n\nLet's factorize 284 step by step:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n284 &= 2 \\times 142 \\\\\n142 &= 2 \\times 71 \\\\\n71 \\text{ is a prime number}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 284 is:\n\\[ 284 = 2^2 \\times 71^1 \\]\n\n**Proper Divisors of 284:**\nTo find the proper divisors, we consider all divisors except 284 itself:\n\\[ 1, 2, 4, 71, 142 \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Sum the Proper Divisors of 284\n\nNow, add the proper divisors:\n\\[ "

Let me correct this.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recalculate the sum of the proper divisors of 284 properly.\n\n**Recalculating the Sum of Proper Divisors of 284:**\n\nThe formula for the sum of all divisors (including the number itself) is:\n\\[\n\\sigma(N) = (2^{2+1} - 1)/(2 - 1) \\times (71^{1+1} - 1)/(71 - 1)\n\\]\nWait, no, actually, the formula for the sum of divisors is:\n\\[\n\\sigma(N) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\left( \\frac{p_i^{e_i + 1} - 1}{p_i - 1} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\( N = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\dots p_k^{e_k} \\).\n\nAlternatively, for prime factors \\( 2^2 \\times 71^1 \\), the sum of all divisors is:\n\\[\n(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2) \\times (71^0 + 71^1) = (1 + 2 + 4) \\times (1 + 71) = 7 \\times 72 = 504\n\\]\nThen, subtract the number itself (284) to get the sum of proper divisors:\n\\[\n504 - 284 = 220\n\\]\nAh, so my initial mistake was miscalculating the sum.
