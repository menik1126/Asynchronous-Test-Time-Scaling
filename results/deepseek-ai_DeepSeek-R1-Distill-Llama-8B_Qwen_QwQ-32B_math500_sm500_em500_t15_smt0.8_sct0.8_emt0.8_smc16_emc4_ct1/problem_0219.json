Since the problem asks for the positive difference, it's 3\u03c0.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, let's analyze each region step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the area of each circle.**\n- **Largest circle (radius 7):** \\( A = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi \\)\n- **Middle circle (radius 6):** \\( A = \\pi \\times 6^2 = 36\\pi \\)\n- **Smallest circle (radius 4):** \\( A = \\pi \\times 4^2 = 16\\pi \\)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the area of each region.**\n- **Region X (outermost ring):** \\( 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi \\)\n- **Region Y (middle ring):** \\( 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi \\)\n- **"
