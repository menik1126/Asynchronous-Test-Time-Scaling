            "output": "First, I need to determine the areas of each of the three regions labeled X, Y, and Z based on the given radii of the concentric circles, which are 4, 6, and 7.\n\nTo start, I'll calculate the area of the largest circle, which has a radius of 7. The formula for the area of a circle is πr², so the area of the largest circle is π×7² = 49π.\n\nNext, I'll find the area of the middle circle with a radius of 6. Using the same formula, the area is π×6² = 36π.\n\nFinally, the smallest circle has a radius of 4, so its area is π×4² = 16π.\n\nNow, I'll identify the regions. Region X is between the largest and middle circles, so its area is 49π - 36π = 13π. Region Y is between the middle and smallest circles, with an area of 36π - 16π = 20π. Region Z is the area of the smallest circle, which is 16π.\n\nComparing the areas, the largest region is Y with 20π, and the smallest is Z with 16π. The difference between these areas is 20π - 16π = 4π.\n</think>\n\nCertainly! Let's analyze the problem step by step to find the difference between the area of the largest region and the smallest region.\n\n**Given:**\n- Three concentric circles with radii of **4**, **6**, and **7**.\n- Regions labeled **X**, **Y**, and **Z**.\n\n**Understanding the Regions:**\n1. **Region X** is the area between the largest circle (radius 7) and the middle circle (radius 6).\n2. **Region Y** is the area between the middle circle (radius 6) and the smallest circle (radius 4).\n3. **Region Z** is the area of the smallest circle (radius 4).\n\n**Calculating Areas:**\nLet's compute the area of each circle using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi r^2 \\]\n1. **Largest Circle (radius 7):**\n   \\[ \\text{Area} = \\pi \\times 7^2 = 49\\pi \\]\n2. **Middle Circle (radius 6):**\n   \\"
