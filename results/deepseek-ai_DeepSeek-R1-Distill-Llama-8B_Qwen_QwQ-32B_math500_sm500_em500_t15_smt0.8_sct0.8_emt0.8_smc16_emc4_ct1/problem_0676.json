            "output": "To determine the number of possible values of \\( x \\) given the constraints, I'll start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that \\( x \\times y = 54 \\) because the total number of cards is 54 and each of the \\( x \\) players receives \\( y \\) cards. \n\nNext, I'll list all the factors of 54 to identify possible values of \\( y \\). The factors of 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54.\n\nSince each player must receive at least 5 cards, any factor of 54 that is less than 5 is not valid. This means \\( y \\) can be 6, 9, 18, 27, or 54.\n\nNow, I'll determine the corresponding values of \\( x \\) for each valid \\( y \\):\n- If \\( y = 6 \\), then \\( x = \\frac{54}{6} = 9 \\)\n- If \\( y = 9 \\), then \\( x = \\frac{54}{9} = 6 \\)\n- If \\( y = 18 \\), then \\( x = \\frac{54}{18} = 3 \\)\n- If \\( y = 27 \\), then \\( x = \\frac{54}{27} = 2 \\)\n- If \\( y = 54 \\), then \\( x = \\frac{54}{54} = 1 \\)\n\nHowever, the problem states that \\( x \\) must be at least 2. Therefore, the valid values of \\( x \\) are 3, 6, and 9.\n\nThus, there are 3 possible values of \\( x \\) that satisfy the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of cards = 54\n- Number of players = \\( x \\) (where \\( x \\geq 2 \\))\n- Number of cards per player = \\( y \\) (where \\( y \\geq 5 \\))\n  \n**Equation:**\n\\[ x \\times y = 54 \\]\n\n**Step 1: Find all pairs of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy \\( x \\times y = 54 \\).**\n\n1. **List the factors of 54:**\n   \\[ 1, 2"
