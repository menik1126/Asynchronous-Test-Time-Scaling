            "output": "Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the modulus of a complex number w, given that w is defined in terms of another complex number z. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that z = 1 + i, where i is the imaginary unit. So, z is a complex number with a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of 1. Then, w is given by the expression (3z + 1) divided by (5z + 7). My goal is to find the modulus of w, which is denoted as |w|.\n\nOkay, so I need to compute |w|. Since w is a complex number, its modulus can be found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts. But before I can find the modulus, I need to express w in terms of real and imaginary components. That means I have to simplify the expression for w first.\n\nSo, let's write down what w is:\n\nw = (3z + 1) / (5z + 7)\n\nGiven that z is 1 + i, I can substitute that into the equation:\n\nw = [3*(1 + i) + 1] / [5*(1 + i) + 7]\n\nAlright, so I need to compute both the numerator and the denominator separately. Let's start with the numerator.\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n3*(1 + i) + 1\n\nFirst, multiply 3 by (1 + i):\n\n3*1 + 3*i = 3 + 3i\n\nThen, add 1 to that result:\n\n3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to 4 + 3i. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's compute the denominator:\n\n5*(1 + i) + 7\n\nAgain, multiply 5 by (1 + i):\n\n5*1 + 5*i = 5 + 5i\n\nThen, add 7 to that result:\n\n5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i\n\nSo, the denominator simplifies to 12 + 5i. Got that.\n\nNow, w is equal to (4 + 3i) divided by (12 + 5i). So, w = (4 + 3i) /"

            "output": " (12 + 5i). To find the modulus of w, it might be easier if I express w as a complex number in the form a + bi, and then compute the modulus from there.\n\nSo, to find a and b, I can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. The complex conjugate of 12 + 5i is 12 - 5i. This technique helps in simplifying the expression by eliminating the imaginary unit from the denominator.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nw = (4 + 3i) / (12 + 5i)\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (12 - 5i):\nw = [(4 + 3i)(12 - 5i)] / [(12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)]\n\nNow, let's compute the numerator first.\n\nCalculating numerator: (4 + 3i)(12 - 5i)\n\nUsing the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\nFirst: 4*12 = 48\nOuter: 4*(-5i) = -20i\nInner: 3i*12 = 36i\nLast: 3i*(-5i) = -15i\u00b2\n\nNow, combining these terms:\n\n48 - 20i + 36i - 15i\u00b2\n\nSimplify like terms:\n\nThe real parts are 48 and -15i\u00b2. But since i\u00b2 = -1, -15i\u00b2 becomes +15. So, 48 + 15 = 63.\n\nThe imaginary parts are -20i and +36i. Adding them together: (-20 + 36)i = 16i.\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to 63 + 16i.\n\nNow, let's compute the denominator: (12 + 5i)(12 - 5i)\n\nThis is a difference of squares, so:\n\n12\u00b2 - (5i)\u00b2 = 144 - 25i\u00b2\n\nAgain, since i\u00b2 = -1, this becomes:\n\n144 - 25*(-1) = 144 + 25 = 169\n\nSo, the denominator is 169.\n\nTherefore, w = (63 + 16i) / 169\n\nWhich can be written as w = 63/169 + (16/169)i\n\nNow, to find |w|, the modulus of w, we can compute:\n\n|w| = sqrt( (Real"

So, 3969 / 28561.\n\nSecond, (16/169)^2:\n\n16 squared is 256, so 256 / 28561.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n(3969 + 256) / 28561 = 4225 / 28561\n\nSo, |w| = sqrt(4225 / 28561)\n\nNow, sqrt(4225) is 65, because 65^2 = 4225.\n\nsqrt(28561) is 169, because 169^2 = 28561.\n\nSo, |w| = 65 / 169\n\nSimplify this fraction: both numerator and denominator can be divided by 13.\n\n65 \u00f7 13 = 5\n\n169 \u00f7 13 = 13\n\nSo, 5 / 13.\n\nTherefore, |w| equals 5/13.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward.
