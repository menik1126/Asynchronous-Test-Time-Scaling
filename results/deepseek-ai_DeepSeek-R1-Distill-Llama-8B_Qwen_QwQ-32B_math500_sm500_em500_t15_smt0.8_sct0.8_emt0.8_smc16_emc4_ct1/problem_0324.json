This is a combination problem, so I'll use the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. For the boys, C(7, 3) will give me the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the number of ways to choose the girls using the same combination formula. Here, I'll use C(4, 2) to find the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4.\n\nOnce I have the number of ways to choose the boys and girls separately, I'll multiply these two numbers together to get the total number of ways to form the group. This is because each combination of boys can be paired with each combination of girls.\n\nFinally, I'll present the final answer in a clear mathematical format, showing the calculations for each step and the final result.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of ways Mr. Brennan can pick 3 boys and 2 girls, we can use the concept of combinations. The order in which the children are selected does not matter.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 boys out of 7.**\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7!}{3!4!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorial:\n\n\\[\n7! = 5040,\\quad 3! = 6,\\quad 4! = 24\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC(7, 3) = \\frac{5040}{6 \\times 24} = \\frac{5040}{144} = 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 4.**\n\n\\[\nC(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorial:\n\n\\[\n4! = 24,\\quad 2! = 2\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\"
