Mr. Brennan has 7 boys and 4 girls in his statistics class.\n\nNext, the problem requires selecting 3 boys out of the 7. To find the number of ways to do this, I'll use the combination formula, which is denoted by \"C(n, k)\" or \"n choose k\". The formula for combinations is:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 boys from 7 is C(7, 3).\n\nCalculating C(7, 3):\n\n7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n3! = 3 × 2 × 1\n(7 - 3)! = 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nC(7, 3) = (7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (3 × 2 × 1 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 35\n\nTherefore, there are 35 ways to choose 3 boys from 7.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the number of ways to select 2 girls out of the 4 available.\n\nUsing the combination formula again, the number of ways to choose 2 girls from 4 is C(4, 2).\n\nCalculating C(4, 2):\n\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1\n2! = 2 × 1\n(4 - 2)! = 2! = 2 × 1\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nC(4, 2) = (4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / (2 × 1 × 2 × 1) = 6\n\nTherefore, there are 6 ways to choose 2 girls from 4.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of ways to pick 3 boys and 2 girls, I need to multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girls.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is 35 (ways for boys) multiplied by 6 (ways for girls), which"
