The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height. Plugging in the given values, the volume of one beaker is \\( \\pi \\times 3^2 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is \\( V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 \\). With a radius of 6 cm, the volume becomes \\( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times 6^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\times 216 = 288\\pi \\) cubic centimeters.\n\nTo find out how many beakers are needed to fill the tank, I'll divide the total volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker. This gives \\( \\frac{288\\pi}{72\\pi} = 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, it will take 4 cylindrical beakers of water to fill the spherical tank.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Volume of One Cylindrical Beaker**\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is:\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the cylinder\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder\n\nGiven:\n- Radius of the beaker, \\( r = 3 \\) cm\n- Height of the beaker, \\( h = 8 \\) cm\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[\nV_{\\text{beaker}} = \\pi \\times (3)^2 \\times 8 = \\pi \\times 9 \\times 8 = 72\\pi \\ \\text{cm}^3\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Spherical Tank**\n\nThe formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( R \\) is the radius of the sphere\n\nGiven:\n- Radius of the tank, \\( R = 6 \\"
