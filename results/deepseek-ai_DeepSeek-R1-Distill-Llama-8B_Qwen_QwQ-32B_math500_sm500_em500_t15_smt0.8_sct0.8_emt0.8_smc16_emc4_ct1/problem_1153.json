Applying this to the left side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   (3^k)^6 = 3^{6k}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set the Exponents Equal**:\n   \n   Since the bases are the same and the equation holds true, their exponents must be equal:\n   \\[\n   6k = 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( k \\)**:\n   \n   Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to isolate \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{6}{6} = 1\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]"
