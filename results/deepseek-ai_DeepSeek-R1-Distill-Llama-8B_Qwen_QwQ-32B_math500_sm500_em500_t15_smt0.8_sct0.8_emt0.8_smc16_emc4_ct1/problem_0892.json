This occurs when the denominator, after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\nNext, I will factorize the denominator. The denominator is 160, which can be broken down into its prime factors: \\( 160 = 2^5 \\times 5^1 \\).\n\nSince both 2 and 5 are factors of 10, and therefore will not introduce any repeating decimals, the fraction \\( \\frac{57}{160} \\) is guaranteed to terminate.\n\nFinally, I will perform the division 57 divided by 160 to find the terminating decimal.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\( \\frac{57}{160} \\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand Terminating Decimals\nA fraction will have a terminating decimal if, after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms, the denominator has no prime factors other than 2 and 5.\n\n### Step 2: Factorize the Denominator\nLet's factorize the denominator \\( 160 \\):\n\\[\n160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^4 \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n\\]\nThe denominator \\( 160 \\) has prime factors **2** and **5**, which means \\( \\frac{57}{160} \\) will be a terminating decimal.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Division\nDivide the numerator by the denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n\\]\nThe decimal terminates after 5 places.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
