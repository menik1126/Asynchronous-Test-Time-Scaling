            "output": "I need to determine whether the fraction 57/160 can be expressed as a terminating decimal. To do this, I'll examine the prime factors of the denominator.\n\nFirst, I'll factorize 160. Breaking it down, 160 is equal to 16 multiplied by 10. The number 16 can be further broken down into 2 raised to the power of 4, and 10 is 2 multiplied by 5. So, the prime factors of 160 are 2^5 and 5^1.\n\nSince the denominator has both 2 and 5 as prime factors, it has no other prime factors besides 2 and 5, this means that the decimal representation of 57/160 will terminate.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to convert the fraction to a decimal by performing the division of 57 by 160.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the fraction \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Prime Factors of the Denominator**:\n   - Factorize the denominator \\(160\\):\n     \\[\n     160 = 16 \\times 10 = 2^4 \\times (2 \\times 5) = 2^5 \\times 5^1\n     \\]\n   - The denominator has only \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) as prime factors.\n\n2. **Determine if the Decimal Will Terminate**:\n   - A fraction will have a terminating decimal if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction to its lowest terms, has no prime factors other than \\(2\\) and \\(5\\).\n   - Since \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) is already in its simplest form and the denominator \\(160\\) only has \\(2\\) and \\(5\\) as prime factors, the decimal will terminate.\n\n3. **Convert the Fraction to a Decimal**:\n   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{57}{160} = 0.35625\n     \\]\n   - Perform the division step-by-step:\n     \\[\n     57 \\div 160 = 0.35625\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.35625}\n\\]"
