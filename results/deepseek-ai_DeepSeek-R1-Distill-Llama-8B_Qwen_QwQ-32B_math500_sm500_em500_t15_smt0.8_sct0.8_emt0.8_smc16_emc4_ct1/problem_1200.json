The direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). The line is parameterized, which means it's defined by a starting point and a direction vector. The figure provided is an Asymptote diagram, which I can't see directly, but based on the description, it's a grid with a red line drawn from point \\( L \\) to point \\( R \\).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how the direction vector relates to the line. The direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) tells me that for every 1 unit increase in the x-direction, the line decreases by 7 units in the y-direction. Wait, no, actually, the direction vector components indicate how the line changes as \\( x \\) increases. So for each step in \\( x \\), \\( y \\) changes by \\( b \\). But since the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), that means as \\( x \\) increases by -7 (which is a decrease in the x-direction), \\( y \\) increases by \\( b \\). Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the slope of the line. The direction vector can be converted into slope by dividing the change in y by the change in x. So the slope \\( m \\) would be \\( \\frac{b}{-7} \\). Alternatively, if the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), that means the line goes -7 units in x and b units in y for each \"step.\" So the slope would be \\( \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{b}{-7} \\). Got it.\n\nNow, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws a red line from point \\( L \\) to point \\( R \\). Points \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) are defined as extensions of line \\( AB \\) from the axes. Point \\( A \\) is at (-5,4), and point \\( B \\) is at (-1,3). So line \\( AB \\) connects these"

The red line is this extended line.\n\nTherefore, the red line is the same line as line \\( AB \\), just extended to the edges of the grid. So the direction vector of the red line is the same as the direction vector of line \\( AB \\). Therefore, if I can find the direction vector of line \\( AB \\), I can set it equal to \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\) (or a scalar multiple of it) and solve for \\( b \\).\n\nLet me confirm that. The direction vector between points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) can be found by subtracting their coordinates. Point \\( A \\) is (-5,4) and point \\( B \\) is (-1,3). So the vector from \\( A \\) to \\( B \\) is \\( B - A \\), which is \\( (-1 - (-5), 3 - 4) = (4, -1) \\). So the direction vector of line \\( AB \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nBut the problem states that the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). Since direction vectors can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, the given direction vector must be a scalar multiple of the direction vector of line \\( AB \\). Therefore, there exists some scalar \\( k \\) such that:\n\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} = k \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n\n1. \\( -7 = 4k \\)\n2. \\( b = -1 \\cdot k \\)\n\nSolving the first equation for \\( k \\):\n\n\\( k = -7 / 4 \\)\n\nThen substituting into the second equation:\n\n\\( b = -1 \\times (-7/4) = 7/4 \\)\n\nWait, so \\( b = 7/4 \\)?

The slope of line \\( AB \\) can be calculated directly from points \\( A(-5,4) \\) and \\( B(-1,3) \\).\n\nUsing the slope formula: \\( m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{3 - 4}{-1 - (-5)} = \\frac{-1}{4} = -1/4 \\).\n\nSo the slope \\( m \\) is -1/4. Therefore, \\( \\frac{b}{-7} = -1/4 \\). Solving for \\( b \\):\n\n\\( b = (-1/4) \\times (-7) = 7/4 \\).\n\nSo that's another way to get \\( b = 7/4 \\).\n\nAlternatively, since the direction vector is given as \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is a direction vector of the line, and the direction vector for line \\( AB \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), we can see if these are scalar multiples. Indeed, as I did before, \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) multiplied by \\( -7/4 \\) gives \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ 7/4 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is the direction vector given.\n\nWait, let me check direction vectors again. So if I have a direction vector, say \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), that means for each 4 units right, you go down 1. Alternatively, going in the opposite direction, you have \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which would be equivalent.\n\nBut in this problem, the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So it's 7 units to the left and \\( b \\) units up. So, the line is going to the left and upwards. So, the direction vector \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -"

So if the given direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), then it's a scalar multiple of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nTherefore, setting up the equations:\n\n-7 = -4k\n\nand\n\nb = 1 * k\n\nSolving first equation: k = (-7)/(-4) = 7/4\n\nThen b = 7/4.

So same answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the direction, whether going from A to B or the opposite direction, the value of \\( b \\) is 7/4.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more with the slope. The slope between points A and B is (3-4)/(-1 - (-5)) = (-1)/(4) = -1/4. The direction vector given is (-7, b). The slope would be b / (-7).

So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( b \\) is \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\), which is 1.75.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is by finding the parametric equations of line AB and then comparing it to the given direction vector.\n\nLet's parameterize line AB.\n\nPoint A is (-5,4). Let parameter \\( t \\) vary from 0 to 1 to go from A to B.\n\nSo the parametric equations:\n\nx(t) = -5 + 4t (since from x=-5 to x=-1, which is an increase of 4)\n\ny(t) = 4 - t (since from y=4 to y=3, which is a decrease of 1)\n\nSo the direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\nIf we set this equal to the given direction vector times some scalar \\( k \\):\n\n\\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = k \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nWait, but that would imply 4 = -7k and -1 = b k.\n\nWait, but that would mean looking for a scalar \\( k \\) such that both components are satisfied. But 4 = -7k implies k = -4/7. Then plugging into -1 = b k: -1 = b (-4/7) => b = (-1)/(-4/7) = 7/4.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent because the direction vectors would have to be scalar multiples, but in opposite directions. Hmm. No, actually, the direction vector can be scaled by any scalar, including negative ones.\n\nSo perhaps I can also think of the direction vector as a scalar multiple in either direction.\n\nWait, no, the direction vectors must be consistent. Hmm, maybe I confused the direction. Perhaps I should instead see that the given direction vector is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\), which is proportional to the direction from A to B, which is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).

So the key is that the direction vector must be a scalar multiple of the direction vector between A and B.\n\nTherefore, the direction vector between A and B is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), so any scalar multiple of that is a valid direction vector for the line.

The problem says the line is parameterized so that its direction vector is of the form \\( \\begin{pmatrix} -7 \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix} \\). So the direction vector is exactly that, so the line's direction vector is given as that vector. Therefore, the direction vector must be a scalar multiple of the direction vector between A and B.
