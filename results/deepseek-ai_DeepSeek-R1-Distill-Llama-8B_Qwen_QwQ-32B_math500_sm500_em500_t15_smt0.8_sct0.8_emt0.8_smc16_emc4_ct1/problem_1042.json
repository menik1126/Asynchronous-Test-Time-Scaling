The polynomial has integer coefficients and is of degree 4.\n\nFirst, I recall the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any possible rational root, expressed in lowest terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must have a numerator \\(p\\) that is a factor of the constant term and a denominator \\(q\\) that is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nIn this case, the constant term is 1, so the possible values for \\(p\\) are \\(\\pm1\\). The leading coefficient is 2, so the possible values for \\(q\\) are \\(\\pm1\\) and \\(\\pm2\\).\n\nNext, I list all possible combinations of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\):\n\n1. When \\(q = 1\\), the possible roots are \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\) and \\(\\frac{-1}{1} = -1\\).\n2. When \\(q = -1\\), the possible roots are \\(\\frac{1}{-1} = -1\\) and \\(\\frac{-1}{-1} = 1\\). These are the same as above.\n3. When \\(q = 2\\), the possible roots are \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{-1}{2}\\).\n4. When \\(q = -2\\), the possible roots are \\(\\frac{1}{-2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{-1}{-2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\). These are also the same as above.\n\nCombining all unique possible rational roots, I have \\(1\\), \\(-1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, there are 4 different possible rational roots.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of different possible rational roots for the polynomial equation\n\\[\n2x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + 1 = 0,\n\\]\nwhere the coefficients \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) are integers, we can use the **Rational Root"
