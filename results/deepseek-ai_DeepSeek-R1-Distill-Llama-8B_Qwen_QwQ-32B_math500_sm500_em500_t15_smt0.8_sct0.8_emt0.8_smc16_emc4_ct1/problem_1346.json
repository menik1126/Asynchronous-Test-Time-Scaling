I remember that when you divide one polynomial by another, you can use long division, similar to how you do numbers. But I also recall something about the Remainder Theorem, which might be helpful here.\n\nLet me think. The Remainder Theorem states that if you divide a polynomial \\( f(x) \\) by \\( x - a \\), the remainder is \\( f(a) \\). Wait, in this case, I’m dividing by \\( x + 1 \\), which is the same as \\( x - (-1) \\). So if I let \\( a = -1 \\), then the remainder should be \\( f(-1) \\).\n\nLet me calculate \\( f(-1) \\). The polynomial is \\( x^6 - 3 \\), so plugging in -1 gives \\( (-1)^6 - 3 \\). Calculating that: \\( (-1) \\) raised to an even power is positive 1, so \\( 1 - 3 = -2 \\). So the remainder is -2.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the quotient, not the remainder. Hmm, so if I use polynomial long division, I can find both the quotient and the remainder. Since I know the remainder is -2, maybe I can express the division as:\n\n\\( x^6 - 3 = (x + 1) \\times Q(x) + (-2) \\)\n\nWhere \\( Q(x) \\) is the quotient polynomial. But the problem is asking specifically for the quotient \\( Q(x) \\). So I need to perform the polynomial long division to find \\( Q(x) \\).\n\nLet me set up the long division. I'll divide \\( x^6 - 3 \\) by \\( x + 1 \\). \n\nFirst, I'll write down the dividend and the divisor:\n\nDividend: \\( x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\)\n\nDivisor: \\( x + 1 \\)\n\nI need to divide term by term. Starting with the highest degree term, which is \\( x^6 \\) divided by \\( x \\), which gives \\( x^5"

So the first term of the quotient is \\( x^5 \\).\n\nNow, I multiply the entire divisor \\( x + 1 \\) by \\( x^5 \\), giving \\( x^6 + x^5 \\).\n\nSubtracting this from the dividend:\n\n\\( (x^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3) - (x^6 + x^5) = -x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x - 3 \\)\n\nNow, bring down the next terms, though they are all zeros, so it's just -x^5 for the next step.\n\nNow, divide -x^5 by x, which gives -x^4.
