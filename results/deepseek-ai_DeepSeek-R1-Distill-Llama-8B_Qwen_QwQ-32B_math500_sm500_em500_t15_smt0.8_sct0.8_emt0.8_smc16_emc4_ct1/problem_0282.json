Since there are 100 terms in total, there are \\(100 \\div 2 = 50\\) pairs.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the total sum by multiplying the number of pairs by the value of each pair: \\(50 \\times (-1) = -50\\).\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo compute the series \\(1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - \\dots + 99 - 100\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Pattern:**\n   \n   The series alternates between adding and subtracting consecutive integers:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + (5 - 6) + \\dots + (99 - 100)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify Each Pair:**\n   \n   Each pair of terms can be simplified:\n   \\[\n   (1 - 2) = -1 \\\\\n   (3 - 4) = -1 \\\\\n   (5 - 6) = -1 \\\\\n   \\vdots \\\\\n   (99 - 100) = -1\n   \\]\n   \n   So, each pair equals \\(-1\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Pairs:**\n   \n   There are a total of 100 terms in the series. Since each pair consists of 2 terms, the number of pairs is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\text{ pairs}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Sum:**\n   \n   Multiply the number of pairs by the value of each pair:\n   \\[\n   50 \\times (-1) = -50\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{-50}\n\\]"
